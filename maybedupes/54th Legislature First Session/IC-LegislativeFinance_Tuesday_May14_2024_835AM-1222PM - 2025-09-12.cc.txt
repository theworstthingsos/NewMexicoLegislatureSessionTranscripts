improvements going on and I just
wanted to go ahead and make a quick statement
that I'm really
excited about the communities
as they continue to go and spend
the uh capital
outlay, the resources that we have
allocated for infrastructure
improvements throughout the state.
We're going to continue to go ahead and
do that and it's great to go
ahead and be here in the
Joe Fidel building. Uh
I will say many years
back, uh He
trained me to go ahead and work
on capital outlay and I
really hold
him in high esteem and of course
his family and the work that
he has brought uh
to all of us

unselfishness. And uh
we always think of him
in a positive way.

couple of pics on there.
If you know, just for information
wise, Mr Chair uh
grant in the 19 thirties
and forties was a car
capital of the world.

fifties, it became

But anyway, good to see

Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen.
>> Thank you. Good morning. I'm
Senator George Munoz. I
represent Sebola mckinley and
San Juan counties and Grants
is now part of my district and
I'm glad and happy
to represent them. And
uh is there a priest
in the audience? Because I think
Representative Garcia
needs to go to
confession
as we get started. This morning. So
thank you guys, appreciate guys
hosting us and having us here in
Grants and we're gonna start
running through some issues. Mayor
and city councilor, you guys
are up first, come
on up and then, uh
and then Emily Will
Thomas you an
intro. Ok. Emily,
go ahead. Fire away. I'm stepping
on your toes. Emily.
>> No, that's ok. Can you all hear
me? Ok. Good
morning, Mr. Chair members of the committee.
I'm Emily Hilla. I am
an analyst at the LFC.
I work in the general government
government block.
If you open up your binder and
turn to Tab A,
I'm just going to go over this
information really quickly with
you all. It's just some local
government finances for Sebola
County in the city of grants.
I do want to preface that. This
information is primarily coming
from the, um,
audits from the office of the State
Auditor, which was from,
um, June 30th
2023. So some of this
information most likely has
changed, but this is the most recent
information that we have.
So if you turn to the
first page
for Sebola
County, um, you can look at their
general fund balance.
As you can see that Sela
County, most of their general fund
is unassigned. And what that
means is that
the general fund money is not
committed to a specific
purpose like a road fund.
And so there's more
movement for Selo County to
use the funds as they
please. If
you look to the right there is the
residential property tax
mills that were voted by Sebola
County residents.
Tomorrow, we will be having
a presentation from our economist
Jennifer who will be going more in depth
about property tax with
much better information than what I could
give you all. But in
essence, Sebola County
residents are paying more in property
tax in relation to their property
value than the average
New Mexican.
The main driver of this is
special levies which constituents
vote on voted. Special
levies include levied property
tax towards hospitals, public
schools, local colleges,
etcetera.
For sela county
revenue. In Fy
23, there was a bit more
expenditure than what was brought in for the
revenue. Otherwise in fy
21 in Fy 22
revenues and expenditures
were roughly the
same.
And then if you flip to the next
page for the city of Grants and
their general fund balance.
Similarly, the city of
Grants General Fund is
primarily made of unassigned
fund, unassigned fund
balance. Um but there is a
bit of assigned general
fund balance which is designated
for specific
purposes.
Um The city of Grants
currently, well as
of June 30th
2023
700,000 from their
American Rescue Plan Act, their
arpa funding that they were granted in
2021. But again, this
number might have changed
since the OS A
report was from about a year
ago. And then if
you look at the bottom for the city of
grants revenue versus expenditure
revenues were
more than the expenditures in Fy
21. Fy 22
and Fy 23
as well. There is a little
packet
for further
information. If you are
all curious about law enforcement
protection, funding
and fire protection
funds on the first
page, there's the breakdown for the
municipality of grants
sla county municipality
of Gallup, as well as in Kinley County.
And then throughout the
packet, there's more breakdowns
or county municipality
level and exact
funding. If there
is a county or municipality,
you would like to see that is not
included on the list. Please let me
know. And as
representative Armstrong pointed out
on page two, I just want to make clear
that catching County there is
an extra zero for Fy
24 that should be close to
around 100,000 not close
to a million for the law enforcement
Protection Fund.
Otherwise that is all that
I have for you all this morning.
If you have any questions for
me,
>> the winning lottery
numbers,
>> I wish I could tell you.
>> That's good. You want to introduce our
panel for? Yes, >> of course.
So with us,
we had a couple of invited guests.
I don't know who else is with
us, but we have Eric Garcia,
the mayor,
Marlene
Chavitz, the campus
director for N MS U Grants. And we
also have Tom Whan, the
Chief executive Officer
for the Sela General
Hospital. And then is there anybody
else
and the crowd?
No,
>> we do have Mike Mas chief
of Fire
in Mexico.
>> Yeah.
>> Awesome. Well, I will turn it over
to you all. I don't
know.
>> Good morning everyone. Thank you mister
Chair
>> on these mics. So everybody knows
you got it one at a time.
So, >> all right,
good morning everyone. Thank
you, Mr chair chairman.
I'm Merrit Garcia, mayor of Grants
of New Mexico. I'm thrilled to
welcome you to. Our charming community
is often held the best kept secret
for economic development in
our state grants,
boasts a rich tapestry of
native cultures
and is poised for exciting developments
in outdoor recreation.
However, before we can fully
embrace this
future,
we must address our water and infra
water sewer infrastructure
with Senator Munoz
and Representative Harry
Garcia
in valuable support. We've secured
over $10 million in capital
outlay in the last two
years
for these crucial improvements,
showcasing their commitment to our
community improve. Uh well
being from upgrading
our first responders to supporting
vital services like Roberta's
place. Their
impact is undeniable.
I'm grateful for you all to hear
today as we continue
to work towards making grants,
the safest cleanest
city in New Mexico.
Thank you. Welcome
again.
>> Uh Chairman
Senator Munoz
Mr, director
uh committee members and
alternates
especially
our own. Mr
Representative
Harry Garcia
and represent
Representative Lee
Alcon staff,
friends
from grants,
Milan, the County
of Cibola and the
state.
Welcome and thank you for
selecting grants and
Gallup as a
as sites to carry
out the state's business.
Of course, we are so
grateful to be on this
ancestral and historic
land to be
able to care for
the natural resources.
Our great father has granted
us to use
and to be able to serve
people of this
community.
I'm Tom Whalen, the CEO
of Sebola General Hospital.
I've been here over eight
years and I
am proud to call
Grants and Sebola County
home. I'm proud
to work side by side
with lifetime
residents as well
as newcomers to provide
basic and essential medical
care through our critical
access hospital here
in town.
Recent accomplishments that
we've had include
expanding our behavioral
health services.
We started an
in-home sleep
studies program with
follow-up CPAP
machines to reduce the
chances of heart
issues, major heart
issues. We
replaced our MRI
with a larger bore
and a larger 1.5
tesla magnet
for better
images. And we brought
the unit in-house instead
of being a mobile unit,
we replaced our
CT
with an A
unit with updated
technology that
expands our service
options for our
patients.
And in
2023
we offered 3d
mammography
to over
1000 people to
have screenings
done
and almost
15% of
them required
further diagnostic
studies. And over
half of those
were be were diagnosed
with breast
cancer.
It is a sober, sobering
statistic
but caught at early
stages versus people
putting off screening
this service being
provided locally,
helps our community
significantly.
Two other pieces of information
about the hospital,
first, we have hired
and we start four
additional physicians in our
community in August
2 more family medicine
physicians, another
part-time orthopedic
surgeon and another
full-time general
surgeon.
Then second, this
little hospital has grown
from
$20 million
gross revenue
entity. When I
started to
$100 million
health care facility,
we make an economic
impact in Sebola
County as well as try
to make a difference in
our counties health
statistics
and that increase that
we've had over the years
didn't come from increasing
prices. We have not
increased our charges
to the community
in five years,
largely because
the Medicare and
Medicaid will
pay you what they pay you.
And the 15% of
insurance that we have,
they'll give us a 5%
increase, but that doesn't
really help the bottom line. We end
up writing off a lot of dollars
so it's just better for the
community not to
raise
prices.
Now, I have two deserving.
Thank you to share
in the legislative
short session.
The Senate and House passed
Senate bill 161
and Senate bill
17
which the governor signed
both Senate
bill 161 provides
a bridge of millions of
dollars
for a small
rural hospitals
to deal with the rising price
of the
rising price of
everything
including our medical
malpractice
insurance.
Um
There, there are certain
metrics that we
need to meet
as rural hospitals.
So it isn't just a
handout. The hospitals
have to meet certain metrics
have days cash on
hand.
Um Other
types of elements that we
have to qualify
for, uh,
in order to get those
funds,
75%
of the funds have
to stay in the state.
So it actually benefits our
community
twice.
So I thank
Senator Munoz
very much and Senator
Woods for
taking lead of that
charge and making
Senate Bill 161
become
Law
Senate Bill
17, the Health
Care Delivery and Access
Act, which if
approved by C
MS will bring
$1.3
billion of
additional reimbursement
to all the state's
hospitals, not just the
rural hospitals
to serve our
Medicaid
population.
Currently, hospitals are
reimbursed about
85 cents
on the dollar of cost.
So it's not covering our
costs and
this will move, move
it up to almost covering
our expenses, my
calculation and there's a
lot of calculations
involved, but we'll
probably be getting
close to 97
cents on the dollar of
cost. So it will
definitely help
the small hospitals and all
of the hospitals throughout the
state and there
are qualifying metrics for
that as well. We have to
show quality
that we are providing to
our patients in order to
qualify for those
funds. And the
really great thing
about Senate Bill
17 is that it
does not cost the
taxpayer or the
state any
additional funds
it kept at the the
current uh spending
level.
So both pieces of
legislation which help
hospitals stay
in business even
if some of our peers have had to
reduce some of their
services.
I thank you
all for passing
these saving
measures of legislation.
It helps all of the
hospitals. Thus,
it helps all of the state's
constituents. So you
came together and I'm
very grateful.
Finally, I'd like to give
a shout out to this community
as a whole Friday
night, graduating
seniors from grants
high school received
over
$130,000
of scholarship awards
from local businesses,
local organizations,
local individuals and
trusts at a banquet
in their honor.
These funds are to
encourage our Children
to take the next
step in their educational
journey to become
servant leaders
like you.
So I am proud to be a citizen
of the state of New Mexico
of the County of Sebola
and of the City of Grants.
Welcome.
>> Thank you. We'll go to
questions from,
oops, sorry, miss you. I'm
sorry.
>> Good morning, Mr, chair
member of members of the committee.
Thank you for being here today
on the New Mexico State University
Grants Community College.
On behalf of the N MS
U system, I would
like to welcome you. I
am Marlene Chavez, Toy
Bannon. I'm the campus director
and I would like
to share a few things about our
campus.
We are
about our, our enrollments
about 800 head count.
We are 40%
Native American, 40%
Hispanic, which
qualifies
us for the distinguished
designation
as both a Hispanic
serving institution
and a Native American
tribal non serving
institution.
And so we are 80%
minority. Most
of our students are
do not live in grants. They travel
great distances. So they're on
the rural frontier of Sa
County.
We offer 26
certificates and
degrees and we
have a small business
development center, an early
college high school, as
well as an adult education
center. Friday night,
we graduated over 100
graduates ranging
from bachelor's
master's
associate certificates
and adult education.
This, this community
needs our college.
As you can see,
Capitol outlay dollars
are at work on Martinez
Hall. We are
refacing
and insulating
the whole building. In
addition to roofing
the entire Martinez Hall
with capital money of over
$6 million. Thank
you so much. It really
needs it and
it's, and we're excited for
it on the inside.
One of our strategic goals
is to support economic
development with the workforce.
And so I'd like to thank
both representatives, Harry
Garcia and Leel Conn for
investing in New Mexico State
University grants
with workforce funds
to start different training
programs. What we
need for capital outlay at
our campus is to repurpose
space. What
I'm finding after the
pandemic students
are choosing to take
history online, but
they can't take HVAC online.
So what we need to do is repurpose
space here on our campus
and convert those traditional
spaces into
labs and
places where students could
come and, and learn
about HVAC or
different medical allied health
programs.
And so our next ask will
be to help repurpose space
in Martinez Hall as well
in mcclure Hall.
We have, we we do
this all with the staff of 40
people. We have 15 full
time faculty, about
25 adjunct
and the rest are staff.
Uh NM two grants is
very creative when it comes
to being able
to provide
the service that we need to
our, our stakeholders.
If you didn't know our
local mill levy, our
operating mill only
generates $300,000
annually as
compared to Carlsbad,
who is no longer part of the intimacy
system generates
their windmill generates over a
million dollars. So
we have learned
to use our resources
efficiently and effectively
to provide programming
to, to the people
of Sila County.
Again, I'd like to
welcome you to our campus. If
you have any questions or
concerns, please feel
free to ask. I will be in the audience
all day long and
thank you for being
here.
>> Thank you. We'll go to questions
from committee members, Senator
>> Campos.
Thank you very much, Mr
chair members of the committee and of
course, the uh the panel,
thank you very much for the
ongoing efforts and the work that you're
doing here in grants and of
course, of this whole area,
Insula County,
uh a few questions
and I'll let you all decide how you
all want to respond.
Uh The first is as
we continue
to work
closely with you to bring
uh capital outlay
and programmatic dollars
to the community.
Do you all have a
concerted effort when it comes
to developing a
strategic and master
plan um
for as an example, the
entities that you all represent
and what does that mean
to the overall future
of grants? And of
course, Cibola County
and of course, uh the medical
field and I'll be talking about a
few other things in a couple of minutes.
But if you can all help
me and, and answer that in brevity,
please.
>> Mm
Thank you
to our overall master
plan. What we're trying to do in
Gras, New Mexico is
uh one
is
work on our water
infrastructure. Our water infrastructure
is,
it's poor. It's 80 years
old. You see as you coming
in that 1st
$10 million that
we
initially put into the city of
grants. You've seen that on route 66
we're replacing old water
sewer lines and we're actually
developing it where we can get it across
the highway, across the railroad
tracks as you, as you
seen coming in.
Uh that was a USDA
loan that we took on
ourselves and then
with the help with
Senator Munoz and, and
Senator Representative Harry Garcia.
Uh Garcia,
we've secured over $10
million in capital outlay in the
last two years to add to
that $80
million goal that
we're trying to get you to do
improvements with
working with the Council of Governments.
We're actually uh
working on our comprehensive
plan to work on our eide
development. We've noticed
that I 40
is
pretty beneficial to us at
that, you're, you're seeing about
80 cars a day fourth
and back on that, we want to capture
at least 2% of that
with the eide development. Of
course, you see on as you, you can
leave on the east side, it needs a
lot of infrastructure, but
the key is the real estate is
prime because it's right
off of I 40.
Um So we're working
with that towards the, with the C
to get our comprehensive plan.
The other thing that we're working with in
Graton Mexico is our outdoor
recreation. We're actually
working on our master trail system
here in Grant so we can have
that next
economic boost
of uh recreation in our
state to have in
trail uh trails in,
in our, in our community
and then go on to tie
into the Continental by trail
on our outskirts.
Um Overall plan
of what grants is trying to do.
I uh we are all
working together uh the
panel up here to everyone
else in our community to try to
make us the next
big thing as the
lady rep uh showed
earlier, our finances are,
are pretty stable.
We're actually uh doing
well in our, in our general
funds and
we'll continue to
look for opportunities
to match funds with the
state so we can keep
gathering that uh tax
dollar or the dollar so we can
continue to improve.
Um Our grower
CS taxes is
continued to climb. We had
a pretty big climb during
COVID for some reason,
it was good and then it kind of leveled
off. But now we're still,
we're about 18%
better than the previous years on
our grocery CS tax.
So we are continuing to
grow every year. We're looking for new
businesses to come into. Our
community representative,
Harry Garcia is working on
a $30 million
road that's working with
uh uh water
infrastructure, uh
drainage control,
uh lighting all
the infrastructure is $30
million. But what it does is going to
release
400 acres to
developers to come in
and bring, bring that extra
dollars to grass New Mexico.
So with grants, the
overall everything
from the college
to the our hospital, he
even said that his
revenue in the last eight
years has increased
by
5450
some percent. Um
So which is nice. Uh
College over here
in grants is
the the enrollment is
getting up. She just, we just
graduated over 100
students the other day.
Uh It's very exciting.
Um Our community after
COVID is actually
worth, worth, worth thriving. And
it's due to you guys giving us
the, the guidance and some
dollars, you guys can
fight whoever gives us the
most.
But uh thank you very
much. >> And
if I if I may
as we go along and,
and please tie to
these kind of questions
uh you mentioned and of course,
uh we're very grateful because we
are looking ahead when it comes
to the vision of our of
health care. Of course, of our
community infrastructure and over
all our programmatic issues.
So you, you talked about one
Senate Bill, 161
Senate Bill 17, but there's a
couple of others, Senate
Bill 151 where we're using
the premium tax to have
more resources go into our
ems services.
Uh Please utilize
that tie that into uh
providing if you will the
emergency services
as we move forward. And then there's also
Senate Bill 159
which will put
$959
million into uh
if you will a trust
fund that's going to be used for
long term tuition and
scholarship opportunities.
And I bring that up because as you
all work together,
the key for us is how
are we going to rebuild,
how are we going to strengthen
and how are we going to move our communities
forward? And it's highly
evident that that's exactly what
you're doing and I know that
uh you still have uh some
responses. But if you could
uh Mr Chair as we move
forward, just uh in
brevity tie that in
because II I want to see the
evidence that you have the master
plan and that you're
fully working together because
that's gonna be the success of New
Mexico where our communities
are working with each other.
So please continue
>> Mr Senator Mr
Chair,
the in the gallery.
We have representation
from the village of
Milan as
well as the city
and the, the county.
And then our economic
development director
is here in the in the
gallery as well.
And we just
had our annual
Economic development annual
report
and there it does
show not just
the elected officials
but also
residents and citizens
working together to
move things forward. Uh
As the mayor
said, uh outdoor
development is
a great opportunity
for Sebola
and grants to, to
shine. There's
a crossroads, the
Continental Divide trail
comes through here, of course,
route 66.
And there's two others
that I, I know Les Gaines
talked about, but I can't remember what
they are, but I'm on the
mountain often
uh seeing people
that come from Albuquerque,
come from Colorado
to spend their
dollars here
in the community. And
the, the
plan, the
Comprehensive Plan that you
talked about is
involving all of the
those entities and
citizens so that we work
together to
make this a great place
to come and visit and
spend your
dollars.
>> Senator Mr Chair. Thank
you.
Um
One of the biggest things that
we, we're, it's, it's
hard to deal with and, and
we really need your guys'
help to help us
in our community. And I think
every entity deals with it is
the, the mental health.
We would really love
to find a way
to bring
a stage, one
stage, two mental health uh
facility into our
community. We're kind
of centered here with
um and we have four
different tribes that surround us, but we're
the hub, right? And,
and it, it doesn't matter who you
are, we, we all have mental health
problems and we all look for
that
uh
service to,
to go to a little
story of mine. I, I went to rehab,
I went to rehab right after COVID
I mental
health, I lost it. I couldn't,
the hard part was, is it was
hard for me to find something, you know,
I was barely just stage
one. but
there's people just like me that need
that care and then there's people
that need that stage two care
because of, you know, the,
the fentaNYL crisis, the,
the heroin
and meth crisis that we have
here. There's
a, a lot of chances
what I've seen in, in
my
um path
was, there's a lot of people that can
be saved. I was saved,
you know, and mental health of a
facility
would be vital to us in our
community. And we're currently
working with anybody we can
with the hospital to look for
resources. Mr Garcia,
Senator Munoz.
Um, we do have
a facility in here that used to be an
old, well, it's not
old but it, it was a jail
and it's, it's relatively
new. It's like 20 years old but
needs upkeep. That
was 11 thought that the county
would give it up to us
or, or somebody to,
to, to turn, they want to just
give it to somebody so then they can
put the the, the money
into it, but it could hold
quite a bit of beds.
Um So going
back to the
overall
game plan of grants,
that's a big part of
it, of trying to do
mental health and
try to figure out that for our community
because I can build
roads. I can build,
we can get water for pipes,
we can get playground
equipment, we can
do $8 million
road arena that we're putting
up right now for economic
development. But
mental health is
big and, and
that would probably be on the top
of
our
hopefully plan at some time
to figure out how we can bring
that type of resource to us.
That's part of our plan. >> Thank
you very much, Mr Chair. And if
we could just hear briefly on
what the college is doing,
how you're tying in with
the uh education
for those people
that are in health care, those
people that are dealing with infrastructure
with business. The other
aspects of what the priorities
are for this particular
area.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair,
Senator Campos,
New Mexico State University grants
community colleges is heavily
investing in workforce
trading. We have
allied health programs in the
area of
CN A
phlebotomy,
medical billing and
coding. Um
We're ems
however, we are struggling to
find an instructor who wants to
relocate here, but we do
have those degrees and we
have adjuncts who teach
them um for
the health care. We also host
a Bachelor of Science of Nursing
here on our campus.
So they students
can enter our campus,
receive an Associate of
Science, stay right here in grants
and get their nursing degrees.
An example of a beautiful
partnership is between the
college and the hospital.
They provide the clinicals.
Um They also
sometimes even provide
some of the um
instruction for our
students and upon
graduation, most of them
are extended job offers.
So we are growing our own
nurses here in Grants, New
Mexico and most of them
stay and, and are
able to work in our community
in different capacities
on the other spectrum
with the skilled workforce
um community.
We work, we have an economic
development foundation
board where it brings
different entities
together. I'm
on the board, there's
a school, um a school district
representative we
have currently
represents from the city.
Um I
know we
do today
um and the village
and we, we do
have um
someone from the county who's
not a voting member. But they are,
they do come to, to get
the information as well
as some private
um participation
from private industry.
That board actually
looks out for the entire
Cibola County community
and I enjoy
being on that board because it
gives me firsthand
information about
what the college needs to be
providing as
our director goes out and
tries to recruit businesses
and industry for Sebola
County. So she
comes back and says,
Toy Bannon, I need,
you know, we need
construction
traits.
So
I
turn
around
and
say, ok, well,
are we going
to do
it? It's the job of
the public schools to have a
prepared graduating
class who can go to college
or are job ready, job
ready. One of the things
that I've done since I've
taken this position over
four years ago
was develop
micro credentialing
within our degrees.
So I have ways
to off-ramp our students
at any time
when I
understand, not all students
want a bachelor's degree
that that's our generation.
They don't want to spend four years in
school. I recognize
that. So we have to
come back and say, what
can we do to make sure you get a
good paying job, make
a good living wage. And
those are
certificates,
quick certificates that get
them out in
making good money.
They, everyone
wants to make a good living wage.
And so recognizing
that my campus
needs to really be all things
to all people. Some want
to go and get that,
that Bachelor's
some just wanna come get a
degree and get a job and
start their lives. And
so as we
work with our Economic Development
Foundation, um
it, it really does bring
the director, brings everybody
in and tries to
work and develop a
plan. So for
Siba County and
grants,
>> thank you very much, Chairman
Munoz. And I want to go and thank you, I
want to thank Representative Garcia,
Representative Alcon,
the members of the LFC
working very closely, of
course, with the people from
this area. Most
importantly, it's always
important that we bring in
the other stakeholders
and whether it be the native
American people that are from the
area, whether it be
uh tourist visitors
that are coming to this area, the whole
key is we're making New Mexico
strong. Lastly,
I would just say uh Chairman Munoz
that we work on transparency,
the information. If
people want to talk about
programs or capital
outlay, it's all available
and that's going to be the future
of New Mexico, all of us working
together. Thanks again, Chairman
Munoz. Thank you very much for the
opportunity to talk. >> Thank
you, Senator Campos Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank you
for your presentation. Um
I uh last time I saw
Marlene, we were at the zoo
together, so uh
hurting Children.
Um Anyway, uh
good to see you guys again.
And uh I'm, I'm impressed
that um of, of
your 40% Native American,
40% Hispanic
um entity
here at the, at the college.
And so I just want you
to know that you, I know you
know this, but I need the
panel to know that there's
people that come from Kamado,
New Mexico to go to school
here.
Uh My sister-in-law was one of them
and she is now a special ed
teacher and
um and she's not in that
percentage there. So she was
in the other 20%.
But you
don't only serve
people that are just right
here. Your
service reaches
into a lot of rural New
Mexico aspects
and for you to be able to offer
it to people like my
sister-in-law and
others, I'm sure there's
others. Um, and, and
to be able, I mean, she drove an hour and a
half to
get here one
way.
And so
hence I have to bring
up four day school week
so they can look
at how, what works best for
their schedule. How can they get here?
How can they further their
education? And,
um, and I appreciate
you being here so that
people like her and others
can have
access.
Um, as far as,
um, the
madm, let's just
fix it. Why
don't we just fix it instead
of putting a band-aid on it, let's fix
it and everyone
sitting at this table
have the ability to help
fix it. So let's just fix
it. Um,
mental health. Thank you for sharing
your story
there. It's, it's the truth.
You know, we can't, we
all live in glass houses,
we cannot throw stones.
And, um,
the problem with
building a facility is
the providers.
We don't have enough providers
and we need to be able
to, I love grow
your own. My husband
and I own a company that we grow a
lot of our own and
we feed our company with a lot
of people that we grow fresh
out of high school,
uh, re recruit at high
schools and,
uh, and the certificates that you're
talking about.
Um, I
noticed when I drove in, I mentioned
it to Representative Garcia
that, uh, there were some empty
hotels, some
pretty big ones. A pretty nice one
right off the freeway. And I was thinking
that's a facility you could use
for, for that as
well. Uh, you know,
if the other one is too large,
but there's a lot of ways, but the biggest
problem we have are the
providers. And
so until we fix our
medical malpractice
situation,
people don't want to come to the
state.
And so, uh, that's
one of our biggest problems that we've
got to fix so that we can help
communities like you, the
hospital, the village,
the, the city, the
county, the,
the, uh, education
part, whether it starts
it in preschool,
pre K, um,
all the way up through higher
education
to grow our own and keep our
own and, and bring more
economic development to New
Mexico. There's things we
have to fix that people don't
realize, you realize, but
a lot of people don't realize
the, the menace
behind the problems
that, that are fixable.
And so I appreciate you bringing all
of those aspects up, but I needed
you to know that you support a
lot of people outside of just
your general vicinity
area. And, um, and
we're, we're had proud
to be here and appreciate you.
Thank you, Mr Chairman
>> Senator Woods
>> real quickly, real
quickly,
Mr um
Will,
what is your >> insurance
mix?
We, um, Medicaid
and Medicare make up about
85% of
our
population
on the inpatient side
and 15%
commercial and
then on the outpatient
side is
more like about 40%
but we still have
60% that is covered
by Medicare and Medicaid
and the Medicare program
and Medicaid
with the
managed care programs
that doesn't
really help critical access
hospitals that
drains the reimbursement
that we get from Medicare.
>> Just kind of give me an
idea of the
backlog that it takes
once you turn in a
claim
for Medicare and
Medicaid, how long does it
take you to get that?
Get
that
>> Mr Senator and
Mr
Chair,
we get the bill out
within 4 to 10
days and then
it takes by
law, Medicare and Medicaid
are supposed to pay within
60 days.
Uh The insurance
companies, uh
don't they
have a law that they're supposed to
do that? But they find reasons
not to reimburse
uh whether they, there's
a form that they said they
still need, but that
pushes out. So
it is very often that
we're not getting paid
for services
over 100 and 20
days before we get
money coming
in
>> and thank you for that.
Um,
on the, on the
uh New Mexico State
campus.
What kind of uh
adult education
programs do you
have,
uh, you know, statistically
we've got about 25%
of our adults
that can't read in
the state.
What kind, what kind of
services are you providing
to that
group?
>> Mr Chair,
Senator New
Mexico State University
Grants Campus has
a, an established
adult education
program through the state
through the higher education
department. And so
you are correct. In
Sla County, 25%
of our students do not have
a high school equivalency degree.
And so
she, we have a new
director and so we
have um
54
full time instructors for
one full time, three
part time, excuse me,
plus tutors to help
with um bringing
in those students and
working to remediate them and
bring them up to proficiency.
She's currently exploring
the IET. If you're
not familiar with that, it's
integrated
education
training. So
essentially what this is,
is these students who
decide to earn
their high school equivalency,
but they also want to, it's
kind of like dual credit for adult
essentially, but they
want to also earn a
skilled trade. They
simultaneously
take classes. And so when
they earn their high school equivalency,
they're also training
to be
um in,
in a program, the program
we've selected is
phlebotomy. And
so we're working, she's um
this is a new program within the
state called IET.
Any support you could provide
that, but it's supposed to get
these students workforce
ready just as it would, they
would in high school if they take
dual credit classes towards
certificates?
>> One other question on
that. Do you have
any kind of social worker
type trading going
on,
>> Mr Chair? Senator?
Yes, sir. Yes, we do. We
have an associate in social
work that feeds
100% into the
Bachelor's at New Mexico
State University and
Mo and most other, um,
campuses in the State
of New
Mexico.
>> And one last question to
the mayor,
what uh what is your
vacancy rate on
your workforce
within the
city?
>> You know, II I don't
know if I could answer that. What like what
the percentage would be but we
struggle with workforce here.
The hard part about workforce
here is housing.
We housing
here in grants
is well, we really don't
have anything. Everything is
dilapidated old.
Yeah, they do have people that come here.
Some investors that are trying to,
you know, flip homes and start
to put some money
into some capital
into some of these older homes.
But as far as new
development, we we just don't
have that new development of
a of a land of a
developer to come in and
you know, develop 30
homes. One of the
biggest projects that we're working
on now with
representative Harry
Garcia, he just secured
$3 million for the
design phase for
the road I was speaking about
earlier. It's a three mile road that
would add all the infrastructure
and that would allow
uh
developers to come in and it
will be a plug and play. So
our biggest thing is developing
infrastructure. So we
can be welcoming to these
developers to come in
developers right now. They come
in and they're like, it's beautiful. Wow,
it's great. It's clean,
uh relatively, very
safe and then they look
around and it's hard to plug
in. So that's one of our
biggest struggles, but we are working
with Representative Harry
Garcia
to
alleviate some of
that.
>> Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr
Chairman,
>> Senator, I represent
Garcia.
Thank you, Mr Chairman
uh to the mayor.
Uh You're right about what
you said about uh
infrastructure. If
you look around town right now,
Mr Chairman, you know,
there's a lot of construction going
on everywhere
and you know, people complain about
it, but
that's the start of what we got to
start at because you come
in here and every
time you turn around the waters
off because the water line busted
somewhere or something
backed up. You know, and
that being
said,
once we get the infrastructure
that we're working on,
that will draw people into the
city because right
now, like I said, you know, if you look
at it,
well, you know,
there is none
and we really need to work on
that.
And you know, I appreciate what you're doing
for the city because, you know, there
is a lot going on in this city.
You know, there's a lot of money being
put into this city right
now. And, you know,
with the Senator
Representative Alcon myself,
you know, it's, it's a challenge
but we're trying to do the best that
we can and we're gonna continue with
that. Uh Next
thing I got, uh, you
mentioned mental health.
You know, I've been that we have that
facility and the old
66
that 20 years old
and I talked to the state
county manager
and actually the building
is structurally
sound.
You know, we're trying to work to
get uh
for a, for a rehab center
or something of that nature.
But uh Mr
Chairman, what uh
represent Armstrong said
to uh to
uh feel
the positions that we need.
That's a challenge and it
comes back up to what
uh Mr Thomas said,
you know, malpractice
insurance that,
that hurts, that really
hurts. And as a committee,
we need to address those
issues
to see how we could
fix that problem. That's a big,
big problem.
Um You know,
and housing is a big problem.
It's a big issue and
it comes back to the same question,
infrastructure,
you know, people don't
want to build because the,
the body, everything in the bottom of
the, of the dirt
here is so old and
dilapidated that
they don't want, they don't want to deal with
until we fix our problem.
And we're, we're working on that.
Uh
Another problem that we have
is the drug problems and that
comes back to mental health
also. You know, we're losing a
lot of our kids
and young adults
on, on, on these drugs that
are out here that we need to control.
You know, we really need to look
at that stuff, you
know, like right now I'm,
I'm working on, uh,
getting a new homeless shelter
for battered women
here in grants. You know, the
money is there. We already put that
money in there. We
just need to get on the,
the bandwagon and get it
done. You know, I, I really
don't have any questions. It just
comments of, uh, what we're
doing in our community
and, you know, if you
look at a community, you know, we
took a beating on the power
plant, we took a beating on
uranium. Uh we
lost the oil, uh
the refineries, you know,
we just uh we just keep
on getting beat all the time.
It just seems that way.
But the
whole uh
purpose of this
conversation is if
we work together,
we can get things done. We
really can, it's a little
process but we can get things done.
Go ahead.
Mayor.
>> Thank you, Representative
Garcia Mr
chairman.
We
uh
we're working pretty good uh as
a team here in, in Granton,
as representative Harry
Garcia said we were,
we were a mining community. We
were a care farm community.
We were
uh we were
mining community. I
said that um but
it the flows like this,
right? So one of the biggest
things, what why we're starting to
push is, is to
be the cleanest, safest
community in New Mexico, right?
Where it's a big
uh push to start
cleaning it up and being
safe. Meaning our first
responders, Representative
Harry Garcia and
Senator Munoz has been helping
us big time to uh
upgrade our EMS
services. We, we, we just
recently took over
uh superior ambulance
uh where we're starting to
our firefighters. We're
hiring EMTS. We're
expanding that because
we wanted to invest into
ourselves with
that said we
are working with the hospital now
uh to try to find some buses
so we can offer those services
to the hospital working as
a team.
We recognize that
grants is a
business of the
state. We want to
create that G RT for
you guys. So we can get our initial
cut. Outdoor
recreation is where it's at.
One of our biggest
dreams that we,
we do have, but we
don't the the
pathways hard.
We would love to pave
the highest paved road
in New Mexico. It would
go all the way up to La
Mosca. It's not to the very
tip as you guys are driving out. But,
but to the radio towers,
it would be the highest paved
road, a 45
minute scenic route because there's already
a dirt road there. It just needs to be
paved. It would be
like uh
pikes peak
in, in
Colorado, 45 minutes
for a senior crowd. As people come
off the freeway, the 80,000
people that pass by
1% come off,
spend your, spend your
gas eat,
stay for a while,
generate tax dollars as
we start to get
people from California
new money,
Texas.
Um but that's, that's one of
the past and we, we're
currently working with uh
talking with Terry and, and
Senator Munoz, but we
would love to make
grants, the cleanest
safest community grants
because new development is
coming. What I said earlier in our
speeches, uh My
opening comment was we're the
best kept seeker to economic
development like it's coming.
Eileen Yarbro and her team
are constantly picking
at the different areas
to start to attract people
in here. Representative Garcia
has upgraded our airport,
our infrastructure is getting
improved, our hospitals getting
improved. Our
our uh college
campus is getting
improved.
Overall life in
grass, New Mexico is improving
and it's because we have a very
good team of people. It's
just not one person, it's
like our community is
amazing. So thank
you Mr Garcia and
thank you chairman.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you, Mayor.
Uh just a comment from Mr
Thomas. You know, I
hear and I heard
from Senator Munoz,
he'd rather come to the hospital
here, the doctor here because it's a better
location. And then I
believe that, you know, I
don't hear just from him, but I
hear from other people.
You know that this
hospital is
one of the best hospitals in the
city of New Mexico.
And you know, I hear quite often, you
know, and not just a comment
and uh
Doctor Truva and for
you, uh what
you're doing for the community
is great. You
know, you took the initiative
to, you know, because not
everybody wants to be a
college professor or
a nurse. People want
jobs that pay
good money. And I, I thank
you for taking that lead on that.
And, you know, I'm glad we could be a
part of helping you get
to that point and we'll continue
doing that. You know, as long as
we're in office, we'll continue doing
that because at the end of the
day, if you
produce good people,
you know, it brings
economy into the, into the,
into the district, you know.
So with that being said, Mr Chairman,
that just comments that I have. Thank
you. >> Thank you, Senator
>> Gonzalez.
Thank you, Mr Chairman
and thank you to our panel
and I just have a couple of
follow-ups and uh
and one of them is more to
uh the follow up of uh,
Senator Woods,
uh for
our N MS
U director
on your numbers that
you mentioned for graduating
this year. Uh,
and, and within those numbers,
does that also includes
all basic
education,
>> Mr Chair, Senator
Gonzalez.
Yes and no, no, we
have over 100
certificate and
associate degrees
that does include
fall and spring.
In addition to that,
we had as of last
Friday, 17 adult
education students
receiving their high school
equivalency. So really,
we had about 100 and 17
students.
>> Ok. Oh,
Mr Chairman
and uh yes,
we know you're
part of the rule
new Mexico
and I always look at
them this
17 individuals
would have never had an opportunity
if you wouldn't have been here,
you know, and call it a
second chance or call it
whatever, but it gives them that
opportunity.
And, uh I just
recently also
participated with
the ceremonies with
U and M Taos
and they had like maybe
60 you know,
individuals
and I always look at uh these
individuals who have never made
it and they don't
have the access
to a bigger
campus or
to the
financial part, you know, to
be in
another area setting
with education. So
I always look at this and it
would be nice to see um
like a very strong follow
up with the 17 individuals.
How many you can really
get them into a much
more higher
program, you
know, what becomes of them,
you know, because those are the ones
that are in
the other hand, if we didn't help
them, we probably would support him
forever. You
know. So to me that's a
very important.
Uh So thank you for
that and, and
that part to
our hospital
to
uh our,
so what is
your thought,
we hear of
malpractice
and improve malpractice
to our state?
But what is your thought that you
would see that would
work?
>> Mr Chair, Mr
Senator.
The there are a number
of factors
that
come into play
that are keeping a lot of the
insurance carriers from coming
into the state and
writing policies.
They're concerned about
venue shopping.
Uh they're concerned about
not having caps
on, um,
settle on
payout
and concerned about
punitive damage.
And from what I have picked
up from the
New Mexico Hospital Association
Director and
from our
brokers,
probably of those
three, the biggest
challenges, punitive
damages. And
if you watch any television,
you see the commercials
from the attorneys
saying we
had a $62
million verdict. We want a
$70 million
verdict and
this, this is a great
state
but, and the cost
of living is wonderful.
I don't think any one
family needs
$70
million
that could be spent
on health care
and on infrastructure and
on anything else.
Uh So I
think punitive damages
would be the, the biggest
thing that if,
if the
Senate and House were
able to do anything
with malpractice,
I, I personally would like to
see the caps because
we see that in, in
the States
around us that do
have insurance carriers writing
policy. Um
But either one of
those would be
very beneficial to the
state.
>> Thank you for the response.
And I guess part
is so would you be
willing to provide us with some
of those pointers,
you know, through an email to our
staff or to myself
and uh and we can work
because this is the time,
you know, the interim part,
this is when the committees have
discussions and
following up towards
uh potential
uh you know,
legislation for the
upcoming 60 day
session. But
that, that definitely will
work. The last part of
Mr Chairman is
um and
this would be
to
uh it was mentioned
several times
about outdoor
recreation
opportunities for that.
There's also outdoor
education
that we have had uh programs
that we can go through our
public schools,
you know, and, and build
that now. Uh,
I've always been
a believer that if you want
to, if you want to build
capacity,
it has to start with
education,
you know, and if you have that
awareness and if you have that
program, if you have a scoping
sequence program
that can take you to that.
Well, uh, the department
has had now for
a couple of years, we have
had the outdoor
education
funding. It's not
very large amount but it's
there and,
and it's wide open, you know that
if you work to that, you know, that
will lead to you outdoor
recreation, you
know, so that's really
just
bringing from your own,
growing your own.
And I think New Mexico
is just so
open to that, you know,
that there's so much that can
be developed and done with
that. So I just
encourage you to look into that
and if you need a
maybe a little bit more
of help, we can have a
staff or myself,
you know, have a further
conversation with you on
that.
Oh,
thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you. >> Thank you, Representative
Chatfield.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman, Mr
Chairman. We're talking about infrastructure
and paving. I just
couldn't help but
uh want to comment
on that nice black
pavement smooth and
sweet that I drove,
drove here on. And I'm
looking forward to the day when
it makes it all the way to
Texas on the east side of the state.
Thank you, sir.
>> Thank you. And just to kind of wrap this
up where we are
at when I know the school districts not
here, where are we at with our
CTE program
or building? Right?
Annoy
>> Mr Chair. Um
Well, I'm not an employee of the
school district. I do know
that they have purchased
property for
um building AC
TE program.
Um I do know that still
part of their strategic
plan is is to
provide additional
CTE programs.
And I know this because what I
want is to offer our
programs over there so that
they can come out with
credential transcripted
credentials. And
so I do know that
the school district is still moving
forward in that area.
>> And let me ask you this, where
are you at with the CT
program? And, and you
have to be honest with us, where are
you at with N MS U
giving you support for what you
need to do here? Do
they give you enough support or we lacking
support from N MS U?
And you gotta be honest because I mean,
we got no president right now
and they're gonna do a search.
So
>> Mr Chair
N MS U provides
very good support
to our campus. Now,
as you know, our
campus is
we have to sustain
ourselves. That's in the Branch Campus
Act, we have our own budget,
we generate our own revenue,
we have to be self-supporting.
So in the,
in,
in regards to support
financial support. N
MS U does not provide
financial support. We have to be
self-sustaining. But what they
do provide are all the things
that we've been, wouldn't be able to
do on our own. For
example, hr
legal facilities,
you know, as we're getting ready for a
capital outlay submission,
they have a team of engineers
and architects that assist
our campus with
those submissions.
When we have issues with
legal, they have a team of
legal that supports us. So
while they don't provide
financial
support, they do provide
all the different support like
that. I
have never felt more supported
by New Mexico
State University. They provide
great support.
I know we are in the
middle of a presidential search.
I have the privilege of serving
on that committee as
a community college representative
to advocate for
the rural campuses and
community colleges. And
right now we
have while they're
interim, we have very
good leadership within the N MS
U system with Dr Monica
Torres and Redi
Lakshmi as
Provost
where we at with
CTE part
of our strategic goal is to
expand and like
I mentioned earlier,
we need space
but I don't want additional space.
I don't want to build a new building.
We have space that we
could better utilize
and with proper capital
outlay and renovation,
I'd like to repurpose
part of those spaces to
expand. We
do have some grow
money that we can that was
afforded to our campus
by Harry Garcia
and, and repre representative
Harry Garcia and Leo
to establish new
programming.
Um We
are now working with
the economic development.
We have to be very
intentional with this,
these resources
because to me,
it's a one time, you know, we
got to get this right. And
so we're looking at what the
community needs for
economic growth, to
support industry
and to get to get a
good workforce in
place.
>> So what we don't want to do is
duplicate that. So we're going to get the
school district on board with
you since you already
have the space, right? And
then we got to figure out how to completely
fund that. I don't think
it matters to the kids where they get
their CTE training,
right? But, but you
know, TLC is working in
grants everywhere.
And so, I mean, if they
had local hires,
they'd probably hire local
guys to work on that job
left and right, and then they probably
lead to a job
wherever they went next.
Right. So I think that's
critical that we get that stood
up as quick as we
can. We'll have to look
for some funding for remodeling,
but N MS U should be able to
provide more resources
to you,
not only
in,
in your employment
sector, but it throughout
even through CTE, but I
know CTE has to happen.
I mean, the certificate program,
whether you want to be a welder, a plumber,
right. Electrician,
if you don't get those certificates
and start getting adjournment and
then getting the license and owning
your own plumbing company. I mean,
electricians and plumbers
are on the shrink
and, and they
got to get them into the
construction world and, and
get them moving. A lot of kids want to do
that. A lot of kids just want to weld a lot
of kids just want to be electricians
and it doesn't really matter what
they want to be as long as they got some
education in their
ability to earn a living.
Because those right
now are really high paying
jobs. Let me ask one
question. I don't see anybody from Roberta's
Place here.
Um I know
we're going to talk about capital, that's going to be
very key because they have some
capital. They need to get moving
for the, for their place
capital that I think
everybody's given them here
from the local area, but
we got to get that place fixed up
and moving forward. So that's kind
of tasking the city with
that. Um
We're gonna kind of move on but
you know, Thomas, I
can't tell you how much I appreciate
that hospital at some point now.
So people know the
difference between Gallup and
Grant me and my
son both had knee
surgeries, right? He
chose to go to R MC
H and gallop for his MRI
for his knee. I chose
Grants. Mine cost
me my, my copay, I think
50 bucks or something like
that. He got a bill
for $3000 then they
couldn't read it. So then he
still had to come to Grants to get
it done. That's the
difference in the hospital service. I
mean, and that's why if
we don't keep a hospital
in, in a local area,
I mean, I hear it all the time
in Gallup is
just go to Grants. They get
you in, they get it taken care
of. It's not
a four week or six week.
Wait, they get you in and they get
it done and they can take care of.
So as we move forward
in the, in R MC H, you know,
we're trying to fix that problem
over there, but there is
pushback. Now, I hear
that people want to move to the
hospital and combine it with
IHS. Well, IHS
can't even manage what they got
and gallop. But I mean, how are they gonna
manage another 20,000
people? And
so I
caution if we're going to spend that kind
of money that people want to push that
hospital and combine it. It's
just, it's
a good idea and it's a good thought, but
in the end of the day doesn't work,
but we're here to help
you and we're here to support
you.
Um, we're going to hear about capital
outlay next. So I kind
of and then economic development
next. So I mean, it's pretty
full agenda this morning just
for, for grants.
I think we need to touch up
on. I think this
legislator needs to know because
that bill came out of the House
or no, came out of the
Senate,
you know, those 300 jobs
in that prison in Grants,
right? May not mean
anything to anybody anywhere
else, but it means a
lot to us here
and, and people want to
target certain areas. If they want to
target Otaro, then they ought
to just sole source Otaro and
not target this area.
But you think about
those people, immigrants
that are there compared
to what they're getting in Texas.
If that they close down,
those immigrants are gonna get
treated 10 times worse in
Texas than they
are here. And
that was a reason they pushed that
bill because treatment for,
for the immigrant population that
was being held there. I
mean, you, you're,
you're dealing with people's
lives that have nothing
coming to America
and they're in a place where
they're in a better place
than they would be in a tent
in El Paso
and wherever they would
be there. And
so you, the
legislature wants to
keep targeting that. My caution
is, it's 300
jobs that you think
we get hit again. This
community Gallup gets hit
again because they,
the employees are really
some work in Grant, some work in
Gallup, they drive back and forth.
They can probably list 10 off the top
of my head that do
that. But if, if the
legislature wants to keep
targeting that, we're gonna have to really
watch that. Representative Garcia and
Representative Alcon that,
that the treatment
is better inside a heated
and cool facility than a
tent facility in
Texas. And the food quality
is probably 100 times
better. And, and
so we need to really
start being vocal about that
as we move forward because if they
keep bringing that bill, they don't
know what the detriment is to those
300 jobs.
Um, anything else you want to
kind of wrap up? I know people
have talked a lot about a lot of
things and, and
this is the committee with the money.
So
you better ask for
the, I do
like the mayor's idea of the paved
road to the mountain and outdoor wreck.
I mean, we, I did
contact re I this this
week and and they said, yeah,
let's go whenever you guys are
ready, they're ready to go.
So >> Mr
Chair, uh the
county I know has
a infrastructure plan,
paving roads
and stuff like that. Capital
outlay could be very beneficial
to them. Of course, the city
and the county or, or
the village,
they report to the community
on a monthly basis
on what they're doing.
And again, infrastructure
is a, is a major
player in that regard.
So the, the funds
that the State
or the Senate and the House
have available uh
could be very beneficial
and that starts that foundation
for everything else, including
the university and the
hospital and others.
And >> we are going to
take on the insurance companies
this summer over this
session. I mean, II
I don't know about every, every
single house member in the State
of New Mexico is getting a policy
increase based upon
the fires in
northern New Mexico
and they're throwing this in a
poll and everybody's paying
right. But for someone that's
elderly that really says, OK,
get $100 increase
or $200 increase on my
insurance. But there's no
reason why maybe
they had no claims
but the insurance game and I'll
give you my personal story
in a, in a commercial property.
They told me they were, we're gonna
deny the policy because I was
in a fire zone and into the middle of
town, 50 ft from a
fire hydrant and I said, oh, you guys
are just full of, you know what?
And so we're going to look
really hard at those insurance
companies, health care
insurance, uh,
commercial insurance,
housing insurance
and, and see why these
guys, if we don't get
these, they're all run by hedge
funds. If we don't get these rates
under control
and, and people,
these increases for no
single reason don't
happen. We're, we're gonna
have to, we're gonna do
that. So we're gonna target them.
I had an interesting conversation
last week in Farmington and
Senator, she and Senator Novell with a
bunch of doctors about
caps and,
and how we do that during
COVID, I didn't know that the state
took on the liability,
uh, for anything that
happened. That's an
interesting perspective
to me. I mean,
there is a cap and you
don't think the cap is low
enough right now.
Thomas.
>> Uh, yes, the
cap is invisible
if, if we have a cap
here, if we compare
to the States around
New Mexico, uh,
even a, a cap
of 750,000
or I'd
say even a million dollars
that would set it
right with a family who has
been wrong. Uh, and
yet allow the
organizations to keep
on.
>> I, I, on the, on the cap,
it's a long conversation. I
mean, what is a life
worth? Right?
And, and people make mistakes
and that will happen, right. But what's
a life worth at the age of
18 and what's a
life worth at the age of 80?
I mean, there
is a different in value of
a life in there. And so I think you got to
think big about that,
but I know Gallup is not
in the caps and they got a
$64 million judgment
against him the other day.
And so it's like
why save a hospital
when you get $64
million judgment?
And they're already
in bank, they're pretty much in
bankruptcy. And so, I
mean, how do you realistically
do that? I don't know if you have the cap
on yours or if you applied for the
cap, but I know you have to apply
for the cap in the state to be under
that. >> We are not in
the patient uh
compensation fund.
At this point in time, we
looked at it a couple of years ago
and it was a, the,
the buy-in was
expensive and weren't
able to afford that
at the time. So I think
it, and I didn't say a whole
lot about malpractice
here because I look around the
table and I believe
that the representatives and the,
and the senators that are
here, understand
the problem that exists.
There are some of your peers that
need to, to wake up to the
fact that
something does
have to be done if we're going
to keep the
physicians that we have
and attract other physicians
and nursing and
other professions in
health care.
>> Yeah, I, I, that was an interesting
conversation and I think
they're gonna send me that powerpoint
presentation but 500
doctors left the State of New
Mexico last
year. And,
and I think in the
survey their, the reason was
because the insurance costs
and, and so that's going to be
interesting. But the
cap uh Charles, we need
to put that somewhere
that rural hospitals need
to get into the patient's compensation
fund at no
cost or lower
premium. So we
can kick out the private
sector hospitals
and are the pub
private sector hospitals and
allow them in. That was
I don't really like the way that was created
because it was created
for the big boys Presbyterian
and all them and they
are corporate income and,
and they don't need
that amount of dealing
and we're subsidizing a
corporate income hospital
that needs to, we need to change
that patient's compensation
fund. So make sure we're tracking that
to change that. So,
thank you guys. I appreciate your time
this morning.
Anything you need, we're here to help
and more than welcome to stay
with us and join us for lunch
if you want. I think Harry's,
I don't know what Harry's making for lunch,
but we'll find out
since he made breakfast, we'll make him
make lunch. So
thank
you.
>> Took Callie's up.
She shorten her
presentation out to get us back
on
>> uh mister chair. We're behind
Tab B
now,
Mr chair members of the committee,
I'm Kelly Carwell. Um
This is Antonio Ortega.
We work on capital
outlay analysis for
LFC.
Um We'll try to make it
quick this morning since we're a
little behind schedule.
Um We're here to present
you with a new uh
staff work products for this
interim that you'll
have for every one of your
meeting locations.
Um And what we're trying to do
with this is
um spotlight
local capital outlay
projects and
funding in the communities
you're traveling to
over the interim.
So we talk a lot
big picture when we do our quarterly
reporting to you all um
about the big picture challenges
with local capital outlay.
And what we wanted to do is
give you a more specific
sense of what
needs these local
dollars are targeting in
the communities. You're traveling
to um
what their outstanding UN
funding needs are
and also
especially focus
on um the
outcomes these investments
are having by
taking kind of a deeper look
at specific projects
in those communities.
So, um the first couple of
pages of this memo,
we gonna kind of give you an overview
of local capital outlay
um in these counties. And
then we have a couple
um local projects
for Sila County in the city
of Gallup that Antonio
will present that we kind of took
a more in depth look
at.
Um So starting in the
bullets on the
bottom of the first page,
you'll see that from 2019
to 2023 local
and tribal tribal
entities in Sebola County
um received uh
just nearly
70 capital appropriations
totaling about $38
million and balances
on these
um
uh consisted of about
67% as
of March 2024 of those
total appropriations over
that four year period.
Um In mckinley County,
local and tribal entities
received more than 300
capital outlay appropriations
totaling over 100 and
$40 million
and balances on those
projects totaled
66% of those
appropriations again as
of March,
um communities
around the state, of course, also
receive state
agency and higher
education appropriations
um in these counties, those
are a smaller portion of
their overall capital outlay.
And you can see those numbers
and the bullets just below
each local bullet on the
counties
if you'll turn now to
page
two.
I also want to say that both the memo
on top and the project
templates in the back of this
packet are kind
of how we're thinking.
We're gonna standardly present
this information
in the different communities to
you. Um But
we're happy to take feedback from
you if there's different things or
additional things you'd like to
see. Um You
know, like I said, this is our first time
doing this. So we're
happy to make it a work in progress
that best suits your needs
and interests.
So, um in table
one, you can see the
counties IC IP
priorities, the top
five projects totaling
$10.2 million.
Their IC IP overall
includes 19 projects
with cost totaling
$66
million. Um
The county itself is I would
say a relatively small
recipient um of
the overall capital outlay
um to all local and
tribal entities in the county
from 2019 to
2023.
Um The county as the fiscal
agent received $5.4
million and
um most of those
appropriations, 4.3
million of that went
to um a public safety
complex project that
Antonio's gonna highlight in just
a minute
in table two.
You can see how
overall local capital
outlay to
entities in this
county breaks down
by fiscal agent
with um the major
recipient being Amo
Pueblo,
followed by Laguna
Pueblo. Um
And then grants
and SA
county
if you'll turn now to
page
three
um highlighting the city of Gallup,
which is gonna be the other local
entity whose project we're gonna
highlight. Uh the
city received 29
capital outlay appropriations
totaling about $25
million from 2019 to
2023. In
table three, you can
see um their
top five IC IP
priorities with
total project costs totaling
more than $33
million. And
most of that cost is made
up by one big project
um to replace lead pipes
for the water system
um which has received
some state funding outside of
the capital outlay process through a
special
appropriation.
Um In the second
bullet on this, it says the county's
IC IP, but it should say
the city's IC IP. Sorry
about that Typo.
Um In total, their IC
IP includes 43
projects with total
costs nearing
$300 million. So
quite significant.
Um and quite a bit more
um than Sla County
which we just talked about.
And then in table four
here again, you can see how
local capital outlay to
entities in mckinley
County breaks down overall
over this fouryear period.
Uh with a major recipient
being the Navajo nation
at more than $70
million followed by
the city of Gallup and mckinley
County. And
um now I will turn
it over to Antonio
to present the
projects we looked
at um which
start on page
four.
>> Good morning, Mr Chair and
members of the committee.
Let's begin with the recent achievement
in Cibola County, the
renovation of a decommissioned
armory into their new public
safety complex.
The county undertook this project
to consolidate three key
public safety functions into
one facility. Those
being the Sheriff's Office
Office of Emergency
Management and 911
dispatch.
The 20,000 square foot
armory built in 1991
for the National Guard was donated
to Sebola County in
2019.
The complex now supports
daily public safety operations
and serves as a regional training
hub and resource for the public
safety agencies in small
communities and neighboring
counties.
In terms of financing, the
total project cost amounted to
5.5 million.
This comprised state capital outlay
grants totaling 4.3
million.
We noted that although planning
and design were not finalized
before receiving state funding,
the project was completed within
about a three year time
period after initial funding
was received.
Additionally, while the county
contributed discretionary
arpa funds and E
911 and fire funds
to the project to close funding
gaps. It did not
put any county general
funds to the project or incur
debt to complete
it. The
availability of the discretionary
arpa funds as well as a relatively
large capital outlay appropriation
in 2022 were key to
completing this project in a
relatively short time
frame.
In today's cost environment.
The project was relatively cost
effective at under $300
per square foot, which stems
from it being a renovation rather
than construction of a new
building.
If you guys will turn to the next page,
we'll move over to the city
of Gallup which is currently
finalizing construction of a
new 43,000 square
foot public safety
building.
The new facility aims to provide
a safer and more modern
environment for law enforcement
court, staff and the
public.
The existing building which houses
the police department and municipal
court is over 50 years
old and suffers from longstanding
mold and structural
deficiencies.
Structural issues include in
addition, separating from the main
structure, a failing
roof and insufficient
functioning bathrooms, forcing
staff to leave the building during working
hours.
The new building will offer expanded
operational space and increase
the capacity for evidence
storage. It will
include modern testing space
and equipment for the narcotics
unit as well as modern
interview rooms, holding
cells and a
courtroom.
Furthermore, the police department
hopes the new facility will bolster
recruitment efforts by providing a
more appealing work
environment.
The major challenge for this project
was construction costs which
doubled over the city's original
estimate before the project went
to construction,
significant contributions
from local funds help the city
undertake the project despite
the increase in cost with
more than half of the overall cost
coming from local
funds.
Local funding included a
12.8 million bond
supported by the city's gross
receipts tax revenue and
$3.4 million
from the city's general
fund.
Three capital appropriations
totaling approximately
11.5 million
completed funding for the
project.
And as you can see from the funding
sources and balances chart,
there's a minimal balance amount
remaining as the project nears
completion.
Overall, the project was a major
necessity to the community
due to the extreme deficiencies
of the existing building and the
critical functions it
houses.
Unlike the Cibola County
Complex, this project
leveraged debt to fund a new
facility.
The project is expected to be
completed in June of
2024.
Now I'll turn it back to Cali for
some ending remarks. Thank
you. >> Thanks
Antonio, um
Mr Chair. So just a
couple of things I want to say to
wrap up. Um
One of the things we hope
to do with the spotlights
is both look at completed
projects and
understand what
kind of challenges they may have
had to overcome how they did
it and identify the
factors that support
project success
um which can kind of be useful
as we look at
funding future capital
outlay. Um The other
thing we wanna understand
more is uh
we'll be looking at projects
that aren't complete yet that are in
progress. You know, maybe some
of the reds on our million and
greater report
um to give
you a more specific and
concrete sense
of what is
holding some of these projects
back and contribute
to those really high outstanding
balances we've been looking
at. Um and
the just kind of huge
number of local projects that
we've got in the system now.
Um So that, that might
inform, you know, ways that
we can uh improve
either the appropriation or
kind of support process for
executing these projects going
forward. So
a couple kind of big picture
things I want to say about
um these
projects
um which we chose
partly because they were recently
completed and
um they were among the
biggest, if not the biggest
recent capital
appropriations to the communities
we chose to highlight.
Um Also, you're gonna
hear tomorrow a
um policy
spotlight from the program
evaluation team
on the Recreation
grant program that you all
started with D FA
recently. Uh One
of the things we
heard in working on that
report was that those
projects are also often
difficult to fund through
capital outlay
because um they
kind of fall down the priority
list behind public safety
projects. So we wanted to look at some
of those public safety projects
and you know, see what sort
of needs they were filling in the
community. I think
what we kind of concluded about
these two projects in
particular um
that appear to have been successful
in meeting the need, they were meant
to address in the community
over a relatively
short time period.
Um where I would say
two things stood out.
Um One, both of
these communities had
local capacity at
the staff level uh
to manage the grants,
put the funding together and
execute the projects.
Um Also
local contribution
of local funds to
complete the project budget
was key in both of these
cases. As Antonio
mentioned in Gallup,
um the city
through a couple different local
funding sources
um took care
of more than half of the project
cost. That was true
to a to a lesser degree
in the in Sila County.
Um But they still
used um local
funds including their
discretionary arpa funds
to, to complete
funding for that project.
And, you know, in this current
environment we're working on,
we're working in, I would say
neither of these things would have
been able to get
done without that
local funding coming to the
table as well.
Um
And
getting the budget fully realized
basically. Um I also
wanted to acknowledge that Judy
Horacek um is here from the
county. She uh
manages infrastructure
projects and grants
for the county. And if you have any
specific questions, she can probably
answer them. And then I wanted
to also point out that you'll have
an opportunity to tour
the Gallup Police
Building and municipal
court uh that we
highlighted tomorrow and I
would really encourage you to
come um
to start out, you'll get to go through
the old building and I think the
police chief is gonna try to
be there to guide you through that.
Um It might sort
of shock you what condition
it's in. Um, and
it's a really great example
of some of the needs that are
out there that really need to be
addressed. Um, and
it provides a, a
really stark
contrast to the new
facility. Um, so
it'll be quite interesting if
you can make it and that's
all we're happy to take questions or
move on whatever your
pleasure >> before
and we move on a little bit. You don't
have Milan in here,
the village in Milan right
there, Caple is completely
missing out of Sebola
County.
I don't know if you can put it accounting, but the
village is completely missing.
So that's >> Mr Chair. It's
right in the table
on page two. It's right
below Laguna
Pueblo.
Thank goodness, but we
didn't highlight it specifically. That's
right.
So it's just showing the total they
receive from 2019 to
2023. And what's
outstanding
>> in
2023
2024 is not in here.
So this year's capital is not on this list.
>> We don't have Mister Chair, we don't
have 2024 in our data
set yet, but we should in the
next quarter.
>> Oko,
>> thank you very much, uh Chairman
Munoz. It's
great to go ahead and see
the uh the system as you
continue to improve the
transparency of
providing uh the
information and the
accountability.
Uh a few questions
that I have when it really comes to the
spotlighting as we
deal with this in
detail, a couple
of things, particularly
within all of our
areas, a lot of the
smaller projects
are also
very important and a few things
that I would like to highlight would
be that we
do have and not to go and
create more work for us. But
as we move forward with the
CS, we want to
ensure that there's going to be stability
in terms of what that is
going to entail.
And then also, I believe that
we're going to need additional
resources uh
and to channel those to the
state auditor because I also
understand that as
we move forward, many
of the smaller entities, particularly
a seia um
do not have their
uh their audits in
order. And we want to make sure
that uh that those are
going to be in order so that they're gonna
have the ability to
expend those resources
that uh that are sent to
them. And then
also in terms
of the smaller
amounts and maybe
what you can do in
spotlighting uh the
projects, maybe
pick a few to go ahead
and help us so that we can
better understand
what the smaller entities
continue to go ahead and go through
as they seek
to, to expand those
resources, the key as we move
forward. And I'm not going to get
into the number of projects
that are held in abeyance and the
resources that we have
that that aren't being
spent.
What I am going to go ahead and do
is indicate
that across the
board at all levels,
in order to create
sustainability for
communities, we
need to have that information
on the smaller projects
as well. So maybe
there can be a tool that you can
work to uh finely
tune how we can
see some of those examples
as we travel around the state.
And then lastly, I just want to
commend you MS Carr as well. And of
course, uh Mr Ortega
for the ongoing efforts that you
put forward in
capital outlay as
we deal with this. It's
accountability. We
know that our infrastructure
is deplorable in many
parts of the state
with these projects. We
want to ensure we have clean
water. We
have a good source
system that we have great
roads. And so
Mr Chairman, as we move forward,
the other issue is going to be,
how do we continue to set the
priorities as we
move forward or, or madam
chair as we continue
to go ahead and set the priorities
to move forward. New
Mexico has great
opportunity, but it's
definitely gonna be up to
us to, to move that
forward. And so if I may
madam chair, just a
question again,
how can we incorporate
and spotlight some of those
smaller uh
entities because
they too have serious
issues in complying
with and fully funding their
projects as they move
forward.
>> Um Madam chair
Senator, um yeah,
we fully intend over the
course of the interim to
really incorporate
a mix of
communities and
project types and appropriation
levels um into
these local highlights.
And we'll definitely be
sure to include both
smaller entities and
also those smaller
appropriation levels
which to your point
are important that we pay
more attention to even
though it's maybe not where
a majority of the money is
because it is where a majority
of the projects are
just in terms of
volume and number of
appropriations
>> and madam chair
if I may just enclosing again.
Thank you very much for the ongoing
effort in the vision.
But the key with all of it is
the transparency and we want to
ensure that people at the local
level, understand
and have the public
confidence in what we are
doing because we
do follow a process. We
do continue with the accountability
and most importantly,
thanks to our staff,
you continue to ensure
that that information is there
for full compliance.
Thank you very much madam chair.
>> Thank you, Senator and thank you
to our staff for that. We've
got Senator Gonzalez
and we have Representative Harry
Garcia and then we've
got, I don't have anyone else. We
have representative and
thank you, Senator Gonzalez.
>> Thank you madam, chair,
Mr Chairman. And I
really don't have a question but
maybe more of a
clarification.
So on page four
on the National Guard
building.
So did they
replace it with a new
building or
it's
>> um madam chair, Senator
Gonzalez? No,
they just did basically a
gut rehab
of an old
armory that was donated to the
county and repurposed
it to house
all their public safety and
emergency operations
agencies for the
county
>> madam chair. Maybe
this question is not
for this presentation,
but so
does the National Guard
exist or they're
gone,
>> Mr Chair, Senator,
they're gone from
that facility
and the community. We don't have
regrets.
>> Yes.
Uh
Mr Chairman,
wait, come on up, >> come on
up, you can come
up here.
You, you just got state your name
for the record because the Worldwide
Web wants >> to
know.
>> My name is Judy Harris
County projects
person.
The question was,
is
the,
they're no longer
here and that's actually
why they, they were building.
At the time when they wanted to
donate the property to the
county, they
were building a
new armory and
they needed to,
um they needed to
give us or give the
community this, this
armory in order to be able to
do that.
>> So Mr Chairman, they do
have a new building here.
>> They do not
in,
they have left.
>> I know that this is not
on the presentation and I did
mention to staff, but
I really have a concern
because if you don't
have one here, you don't have a
program here.
And then the one in to just
closed up to.
And you know what, I've
been told
that it's not so much
not having a program.
It's that uh our
recruiting has really
gone very
differently
and the numbers are not
there, but it
is a concern because it
is something that the state needs,
you know, and uh
to have these many closures.
So if we are
in a position that we need this,
so, you know, we're not gonna have
it. So
that's just my thought and
we'll work with staff on
this. Thank
you. Thank you. Thank
you,
represent
Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I on
page four on the
complex here in Grants is
$275
per square foot.
And yet the one in
Gallup is $642
a square foot. That's a
$367
per square foot. Difference. Why,
why is so much difference on
that?
>> Um Mr Chair Representative
Garcia, um I think
the main reason is that one
of them was a renovation of a
building that was
in pretty good shape.
Um So they had to
do, you know, kind of full
interior work, but they didn't have to
build a new structure from the ground
up. Uh The one in
Gallup is
um is
full new construction.
So I think that's the cost
difference you're seeing. Um
There's also a demolition
included in that project costing
Gallup as well.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Uh The next question
will be, I don't know if it's a comment or a
question but, and your
cato loudly,
I think the system is
broken
because you know, if you live
in Albuquerque, the
metro, you got
30 representatives in
the city of uh the
metro here.
You know, I got 400 miles
of
distance that I got to cover
and my capital loudly does
not match
what we need to do for our
communities
comparing to what's happening in the
city of Albuquerque. You
know, the city of Albuquerque, you can get
five or six representatives
and then do one project.
You know, they
get two, I got 2 million
and 800,000 last
year and they all get
the same amount of money and
yet
I have to uh
represent six
counties. So
the system has to be
looked at to be
fair for everybody in
rural New Mexico right
now. What's happening in r,
in urban New Mexico?
They're getting the bunt of
all this money and rural
New Mexico is being completely left
out. You know, I'm looking
at projects here. We got
three projects, one blue
water,
the other one is Cubero
ditches and,
and Sander fell.
They haven't even spent their
money for probably because of
compliances issues,
but these
people are not getting enough money
to do anything with it.
You know, I have to divide
$2 million in six
counties and that
comes down to being hardly
nothing. You know, I
have to short change the city
of Grants. Cubero
everybody. And right in my
district has, have
very little money in, in
comparison to what
the Albuquerque Metro
gets. You know, we
really need to look at
the, the system
because it's, it's not, it's
broken, it's not
fair on what's happening
because our communities are being left
out. Thank you, Mr
Jim, if you have an answer to
that,
>> um Mr Chair
representative,
I don't know that I have
much of an answer although,
you know, completely
recognize the problem and
challenge that you're highlighting.
I think, you know, with this county
project that we highlighted in
particular, you
can see on the funding
sources on that sheet
that there is really
one big appropriation that
helped get this thing done, which
was a 2022
capital outlay appropriation
for $3.5
million.
You know, that is
even getting an appropriation of
that size which for
many significant
projects doesn't
necessarily go a long way
anymore. Um is a
challenge in this kind of
community. Um
And I, you know, I believe
this one is
large because it came from the
governor who has a larger
pot of money to work with.
Um So,
you know, you're, you're right,
but it's a challenge
>> Mr Chairman with that being
said, maybe as a
committee. We really
need to uh
visit
capital all the way it's
structured because it is
just not right
for rural New Mexico to
be being left out all the time.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Um You might want to sit
with Senator Campos and
how many years we've tried
capi reform and it just doesn't
seem to work uh
represent.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you for the presentation. I'm
going to just continue
on the line of that those questions
and kind of put it together with
what we are, what
we did accomplish this last
session and creating the infrastructure
office with D FA
and in putting that
together.
Um What
do you think? What do you think
that we, how we can move some
of the, the
divisions
priorities if they have
them, if they're going to, you know,
address the milestones
that we need to, to
capture, especially through this
committee and how we
improve those policies
for capital outlay to
make it more equitable
as we're talking about
our rural parts and our
sovereign parts of
our, our state. How are
we uh working
or what is D
fa in this office or this
division coming up
with to, to
meet those
milestones,
especially when
we're looking at
matching funds and
federal funds that are out there that
are very specific
to the populations
in New Mexico. How
are we creating
a plan or strategy
to take all those fundings?
I really appreciate the way you did
this and you showed the opera funds,
showed the local government
uh through your, your
charting and
um presentation
today. But I think we're missing
some other parts that
we are responsible
to, to put together,
help put together because
there are many buckets of
money, the money with
grants and so forth.
And
specifically, specifically
working with our sovereign nations
and our, and our rural
communities where
we, we are addressing
the issue of, of
equity. And what does
that mean? How are we
working with D fa
to kind of
make a, a
complete
um presentation of
what they are prioritizing?
I think we talked about this last month
and what are those milestones they're
looking at? Have they reported anything
to us, Mr Chair
>> um Mr Chair
representative.
So they won't be
officially up and running
until July 1st. So I would
say no at this point.
And I think you're
raising great questions
and the answer is that
at this stage, at least, you
know, that course is
largely still to be
charted. Um
What I would hope to see
and, you know, from
what I understand from them
so far, I think they're very receptive
to is that
that division could
be a resource for
you all um
for, you know,
whatever path
you want to take and
whatever needs
or specific project
types or um
communities
that you might want to
prioritize in a different
way in the future.
Um For you know, identifying
funding gaps
um that
capital dollars could be used
towards in some way.
>> Thank you, Mr Mr Chair.
I, I think that, that that's really
the path of this. If we're,
I mean, if we were to
look at a business model, for
instance, we would look to see where the
capital is already raised
and you know, where the investments
are already are moved
and then fill in those
gaps and work from that, that
kind of uh modeling and
positioning. I think that we have
just um
started uh
in a good way to
um adapt and
change the way we're, we're going
to use our capital
funding. Uh And
you did mention Mr Chair that the
governor um put
in a certain amount of money.
Um It was that
in regard to our,
our sovereign nations
and sovereign communities,
did that is that
directed to um Indian
Affairs or how is that,
how is that being
um
Chairman >> Mr Chair?
Sorry, Mr
Chair Representative.
Um So what I was highlighting
was not for um
tribal nations, but just for
this particular project, sort
of what enabled them to get
a larger appropriation
for it was that it
was coming from a larger
pot, you know, to
Representative Garcia's point
than individual.
Um legislators have
to work with um
the the recent
tribal packages through the
capital outlay bill.
Um Yes, have
been um
sponsored by the
governor um with
support in
identifying projects from
DF I AD
um and I, I
believe the legislature,
um and
those are
administered as normal
capital
appropriations
um through I
ad.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Those, those are, I
think this is such a huge
topic and, and a very
important one as we
are having all these, these
funding needs
and
with the,
with the industries and
everything, having
the,
the increase in inflation and all
putting all those things together. I'd, I'd
really like to see what, what
the infrastructure office is going
to produce as
far as creating a
plan and a strategy
and putting all these types of fundings
together. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you.
Um You
know, K out like
goes
Senator Campos and those of
us have been here quite a long time.
I mean, in 2009,
2010, we really
didn't have any Kappe,
right? Until
2011,
right? I think I got
200,000,
right? And that,
that's
really isn't much to talk
about and, and
now people talk about, I got
2.8 million.
Well, I mean, and
look where we're at with Caple
right now. It's $6
billion sitting in capital
projects, right? That
are not moving.
I think that's our latest number, right?
Around 6 billion
Kelly, maybe >> Mr
Chair. I think it was around 4.5
but we have another
2 billion coming
online in the next two months.
So it's going to rise to
around right around there
probably.
>> Yeah. And, and I
mean, I
don't know how, how
we're gonna get there, but we're
gonna also
work on Kabal Outlay because if we
take that capital outlay
number and,
and how much blended do
we have coming in this next
year that we had, we did so
much in bonding and so much in
cash is this the year that
we're still in
that mix and then this next year
we're gonna go straight to
cash.
>> Um mister chair.
So yeah, there was a mix
of bonding,
severance tax, bonding General
Fund and
uh general obligation bonds
this year and partly
at being a GB is,
you know how you got to the 2
billion overall number.
Um So
next year, you know, I
would say those are
decisions that you got, you
all can start to think
about and that will be before
you. Um
likely
my understanding
um from
our economists is, you
know, at least what they're looking
at right now,
the general
fund that may be available
um isn't going
to be as great as it's
been the last couple of years for the
capital package, but
likely you'll still have
um
you know, a fair amount
and uh
that we could look at doing
some kind of mix of bonding
and general fund.
But, you know, really that
all depends on um
the fiscal policy choices
you wanna make and where the revenues
come in >> in,
in that blending though.
But if we got, if I'm
just looking at the at the realistic
picture, our reserves
are at 32% which is
$2.3 billion
right? We know the biggest
strain on the budget in the next couple of
years is going to be Medicaid,
right? And so as we look
forward in, in offsetting
revenue cost to the general
fund with Medicaid
and, and the
$6.5
billion just let's just
call it six
and, and say
$6 billion in
capital. That's not
moving. Right.
We're gonna have to figure out how
to, how to appropriate to
cities and counties. And I'm gonna use
Sebola if
we put you in for a planning
money. Right. And you're allowed to
get planning money, say I
appropriated planning money to
Sebola for
whatever.
Uh, and you did the
planning money, you got that done
and then you're allowed to move to
the next deal of build
money, right? As
we do that. And
because we got so much tied up
in cash in
capital that we
need to offset and change
that and, and I'm looking
at that. If anybody hasn't
had the chance, maybe we have a presentation
on the state's financial
statement,
right? If you
haven't been through one of those, it's
about four hours
to get through and look at at
the financial statement. And the first
thing that sticks out is,
is the retirement funds and the
debt that's on the front page
and, and your, your debt
and your cash balances on your financial
statement. And if we can
improve that over the next year or
two, I mean, it reduces our bonding
cost. It reduces a whole
lot of things for the state.
But let me ask the county
and I think the mayor is still here
is how much
more capital outlay can
we give you guys
that you can really
manage?
>> Mr Chair
committee members?
Um We,
we have the capacity to manage.
Um We have
uh right now we have one
grant for
$650,000
for the above ground
fuel tanks. Um
And it's, I
am the projects person for the county,
but we have a great
team um
procurement. Uh
We, we have a very
strong staff of
procurement. Our finance
director is here,
Paul Ludy, if you could
come up, please. Um
He uh
so when we were using
ARPA funds for this
project for the public safety
building, that was a
decision made by
our,
by the, by
the county manager, Kate
Fletcher and Paul
Ludy, uh
also procurement.
Uh all
the whole team in the manager's
office really works together.
So we do have the capacity
for planning
and for building.
But >> what is your capacity? I mean,
if you said we
drop $5 million in
20 projects, could you handle
those 20 projects? I mean,
that's a capacity we're talking
about >> Mr
Chair members of the committee,
we're projected to end up with
the general fund of about
$6.5
million.
Um
You know, right now, we
don't know what our last detention
cost is gonna be. So
it could be, I'm
guessing 5.5 to
$6.5
million >> annually
that you can handle the amount
of project.
>> Yes, and
we've, yeah, so our, our
growth with
our between our
revenue and expenditures
and our transfers out.
Um Again,
I'm still projecting about a
$500,000
growth this
year.
>> Yeah, because uh
mayor, do you know
how many more projects the city
could
handle?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Well,
right now for the last
two years, you, you guys
uh through capita A
have given us $5
million for water
infrastructure. And then this year
went for water infrastructure,
sewer. If
before, before
we, we didn't have a
game plan. We didn't have a
business plan right
now with the money that you, if
we're continuing to ask for water
infrastructure funding.
We're right now setting the
pace for uh
starting these projects
here all over town of this
8080 year old infrastructure,
we have to continue
to use that money. If you
came now and gave us $20
million to spend,
we're on the path to, to
get that and show you that we can
spend it because we are doing our,
our diligence before of our
homework to get your,
your, your, your engineering
done first, your construction,
everything done with our
engineering companies. And we,
we work with Wilson and company
and they're a topnotch engineering
firm here. But
if we, if you guys keep
giving, if you keep giving us
the, the, the capital outlay
for water infrastructure,
we're proactive in getting it done
and we can give us 20 million.
I'll show you we'll spend 20
million.
>> Hey, Representative
Garcia.
>> Uh thank you, Mr Chairman. I have
one more last question
of all we have like over
$5 billion
that has not been spent.
How much is, how much of this
money is reverting
due to the lack of
enough? I
mean, let me rephrase
it how much money is getting
reverted from capital loly
due to the fact that they don't
have enough money to do
the
projects.
>> Um Mr Chair
representative,
I don't have a figure
for you on reversions for
that specific reason.
Um But in our last
quarterly report, we
did identify
that there was
in the ballpark of
$200 million
that was set to revert
on June 30th
of this year that had
not yet been
spent,
which is a lot
more than
usually reverts and the
big caveat is there
there is that, that
doesn't mean all of that money is
actually going to revert like
we don't know what the number
for this year is yet,
but that is a concerning
figure a couple
a few months out
from the deadline for
spending. >> And the,
the Mr Chairman, the reason I
brought that up is what
I brought up in the
beginning. You know, we're so
underfunded of what we're trying
to do. And R New
Mexico that at the end
of the day, we're winding, we're
losing all this money. That's what's
happening in, in real,
in real life, in my
district, in real
life. We're losing more
money or we can than we're
spending due to the
fact that we just
don't have enough money to do the
project. If we
have a million
dollar project and you fund it with
$100,000
might not leave it funded. And
that's what happened. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. >> Thank
you. So, I, I,
I'm just trying to get, I
mean, the city and the
county here seem like there's a
maximum that you can
do. Right
if we, if we, if we gave
you and I'm just,
because this is, our problem
is the legislature
shows up with Capa out lady.
And now we have so much money, it's
like we show up by the dump truckload
of money and we say, ok, we're gonna dump
this at your front door
and you say, well, we
don't have the engineers, we don't
have the architects, we don't
have the back management,
right? And it takes you
2 to 3 years to kind
of build that
infrastructure.
And then we got this inflationary
cost that's hitting everybody right
between the eyes. And
so, I
mean, the dump trucks
there and the money is sitting there
and nobody can
move the money
because
there's too much behind the scene
stuff. And I don't know how we're going to fix
that. You're shaking
your head. Yes. And
so
>> Mr chair
committee members,
uh so that, that
is an issue of
how we spend the money.
So as soon as
on, on my end
from my part of the
project, uh
what I do is as
soon as I know that the,
the funding that
there is, um
even before we get the grant agreement,
my planning starts.
So as soon as I know that
there is a chance that I will be
funded, that the county will be
funded, I start
the planning process right
then. Um And
usually when we
do request capital
funding, I know that I
can get it started. I
know that I can um
spend that money within
that time frame. Uh
I have, we,
we as a
team, we've all figured it
out. We have the
council governments helping
us as well. So I
know that
um
we're gonna
get the RP.
I've already probably
talked to the procurement officer
letting her know. We're
probably gonna need an RP
for engineer. We're probably
gonna need an RP for architect
depending on the project.
Um If I, I will
go look at the building, if
it is a building that we're
renovating, and I
will try to
see what
is needed prior to
architect even coming on?
Is there Asbestos in the
pro do I need to get that
abated? Do is there
any issues with
plumbing? I will
have maintenance come out
there. I will
have initial inspections
done if
I know about the project, even if
the project is on IC I
and I know that it's a pretty solid
project. I I will
request some of those inspections
to be done ahead of
time
>> and then, well, just to go back
to your list. And I, and I think you're
the, the agent
for San San Rafael
and San Mateo, we
look at San Rafael on page
two out
of the
325 0 has
been spent.
And I see that's the
issue. I mean,
you don't want to see my caballe
list because it's all in
red when it hits the Navajo
Nation, right?
And, and, and we just
read and, but
we're trying to figure out
this,
like, tell me why those two
projects are not moving
in, in,
in the county. >> I'd be happy
to.
So with
UHS
Rafael, uh and
what was the other one?
>> Mateo >> San Mateo
Ditch. So with both
of those projects, unfortunately,
they were not brought to the county
and they were funded prior
to the county even
knowing that it was a project.
Um So it was not
brought to my office, it wasn't
brought to the projects, it wasn't
brought to my table.
Um So withs
Rafael, we are working
with them. Now, we're communicating
with them. The county
manager is, and once
that project,
once
we are put in
as fiscal agent, then I take
over. But at this
time, Sel County is
not the fiscal agent for that
project as far as
the county's paperwork
is concerned,
>> Mr Chair members
of the committee.
So we did contact D
fa about this and they had
automatically assigned
these us as fiscal
agent without reaching
out to the county as well.
So I think they're looking
into
um,
how they're, you
know, about asking counties
or other municipalities
that can be a fiscal
agent working
out a new system so that
it's, you know, so the
counties are aware, so the
municipalities are aware
and so forth.
>> No, we understand that. Yeah, same
thing with the Cabrero Ditch. So,
I mean, that's part of the problem
is, and you can
to send Rafael is, you can
blame that on me because they said, oh,
we need help, right.
So we're here
to help. And so
that's the problem is we,
we put money where
they can't get it and they can't
move it. You're
unaware of it.
And, and
so that's our problem
in Kab Valley is sometimes
we as legislators
get off the IC IP
list and say,
ok, well,
they know we need, that's a dam,
they need to fix out there. We
know that needs to be fixed
because that helps irrigate
and control floods and everything
else. And we say, ok,
it's a priority for those
people in the area. Let's fund
it. But then you guys are
kind of blindsided by it and this
happens a lot throughout the entire
district, throughout the
entire state.
And then all of a
sudden you guys
are throwing at your lap and it's sitting there
three years later with no movement
and that's the problem
where we need to try to solve.
Representative Ellison. You had one quick
question.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um I really like
the idea of this uh
uh Capley
spotlight. I want to ask
you if you can print me one for
San Juan County.
Uh My
question is
most my comment
and question is, most of my projects
are really lagging
because of
what the chapters of
that requested capital
outlay they have to go
through Wind Rock. Is
there any way that we can
change the fiscal
agent? My
fiscal agent is listed
as Navajo Nation
in some big
projects. Is there
a way that we can change it so
that we are dealing directly
with the chapters themselves?
I think it used to be that
way. Uh Any
time that I question
why the capital
outlay projects in
my uh chapters
are lagging. The the
comment is always
we're waiting on Winder Rock. We're
waiting on Winder Rock. Can
we eliminate that? So
that we're not waiting on Winder
Rock and is there a
way that we can change our
fiscal agent
to Indian Affairs Department
of New Mexico.
>> So, Representative Allison
before my time
and and Senator soI
was here, he passed a bill
where certified
chapters could receive
capital directly.
And I only know of two
certified chapters
in my district and that's uh
Baja and
cil. And
so those are the only two certified
chapters. But we, the
Navajo Nation is always
pushed back when we sent
money directly to them
because the Navajo Nation takes
a five or 6%
off the top of
the capital project to manage
it. And so it's an
internal Navajo nation
thing. Indian
affairs does not have the
staffing
to
manage,
complete
the construction. They only
have maybe Indian Affairs,
maybe only has 20
employees. I
think we'll find out the
number, but they're not a
large agency that so they don't
have the staffing.
And I think that Seth Damon
is going to have some type of
roundtable pretty soon
about how we move those
capital projects.
But the on that
law was passed in statute that
certified chapters could receive
the money and that's the only way they can
get in directly.
>> Ok. Thank you for that Mr
Chair. The, the reason
for my question is
I have quite a bit of money
tied up in
building a public
safety complex in
Shiprock and
that's not moving at all
because uh
when I talked to the chapter
officials there, they say they're waiting
on wind rock. Would
it help if we changed our
fiscal agent to
even perhaps, uh, San
Juan
County?
>> Um, so Indian
Affairs has 16 employees.
Right. And
so I don't understand the
juris jurisdictional
issue with,
uh,
with the public
safety building because someone
has to man it and it's not
the state police,
it's the Navajo Nation
Police. And I do
believe they have an office
already towards the hospital
in Shiprock. If I'm
correct. Right.
So, if they want a new building,
then they'd have to transfer out of
that building into a new
building. But the
Navajo Nation has to
agree to, to do that.
Right.
And, and to get the officers
because there's only what, eight
or nine officers on
duty to cover the entire
Navajo Nation
from Flagstaff
to,
um, pretty much
grants
to baca is a line.
Right. And, and
so I, I don't
know how they handle that.
So, the one at
Crown Point is like, half
empty, three quarters empty.
Right.
And so I, I, that's, I don't
know how you fix that problem.
It's
thank you for that Mr
Chair.
My
ok, I think just to kind of
wrap it up, I mean, we just,
I mean, we can show up with two dump,
truckloads of money, but how much can
you use, right? How
much can you really manage
in your staff and say, ok, let's
keep moving. This, the
other thing I think you need to focus
on in, in the executive
and had a conversation
with them is really
tell us what your shortfalls
are on projects,
right? Because
now we're going to have the opportunity
and, and if we pick one off the
list here,
um these
are all, you know,
grants and the
5 million appropriation only
33%
has been expended. How much
in shortfall are
we? Right? Where, where's
your shortfalls at? Does that
fuel tank that you
quoted last year?
Is that the same price as this
year? And,
and what the shortfalls?
Because I think if we come back and
fix shortfalls
in in budgeting process
that will help it move a little bit
quicker, >> Mr
chair committee
members. Thank you. That's
a great question.
Um We actually
already got an estimate
for the, for the
underground fuel tank
and it actually came a little
lower with
um more
we
uh the
county manager, Kate
Fletcher was able to
negotiate and
get the cost a little
lower than
even the 650.
And it includes more
than we had originally
received a quote
for. So
we do have that
capacity
within the
finance department with the
county manager, like
I said, procurement
and projects and other
finance
departments.
>> Ok.
Thank you guys. I, I think that
helps with our presentation but
always keep us aware. And I
mean, I know that the
fire chief back there got a hold
of someone in the governor's office
and there's an ambulance on its
way.
Uh So I, I
think that I know the
county and the city were in
this little tiff of
who wants to provide service.
Well, we, we fix that
problem so you can keep your service
and the city can, can
kind of start their own so we can
end that.
That will be so one of
the things that uh
just keep us informed
and thank you guys and thank
you for the questions. Thank
you, Representative Al Cohn had
one question. I'm sorry, I wrote him
down and >> thank you,
Mr Chair. Uh forgive
me for not
being
earlier.
However, I
just have to ask in order
for me to be
aware that an
entity in the
county is
asking for funding
the county has to
put this
entity and their
request on their IC
IP list. Am I
correct,
>> Mr Chair Representative
Alcon? Um
We, if
what we do and
I, I'm also the one who does the
IC IP for the county.
Um And what I do is
I do reach out to different
entities. Um
I normally
do also have a public
meeting which isn't required
any longer. Um But
I still try to do that.
And if an entity
has reached out to me
and it has been approved by the
commission then
and the county manager,
then I do add that entity
on to the
IC Forsa
County. But that approval
does have to happen through the county
manager and the
commission.
I hope that
>> back to my question
in order for me to be
aware that an
in
in the county
has asked for this funding,
it has to go on your
IC IP list
because a entity
like uh San
Rafael cannot send
the the legislature
an IC IP list.
Am I right?
>> Representative al
anybody can get on the
IC IP list,
>> excuse me, they can get on the
IC IP list, but they got to go
through the county or the government
entity that they represent.
>> No, that they, they
have to. So
San Rafael may have went,
they can get on the list
by themselves.
I can go
apply and put on the IC
IP list to build a cloud
over grants. But I
have to list an
agency that's
willing to accept the money.
That's a governmental agency
that's willing to accept the money and
make the transfer.
So nonprofits
can get on the list, but they have to
go through that third-party
agency. So like
the, what do we call it this year?
The grow money, right
has to go through a governmental
agency to be
distributed. And so
that's why grow
is going through the cogs
and the parents where you placed
it, right? It has to
go through that. So if, if
San Rafael would have went through the
soil and water conservation
district, they could
have appropriated the money for that
service, but anybody
can get on the IC IP list.
It's who
there and
Kelly and for
their fiscal agent is gonna
be is
key to them spending
the money.
>> Ok. Thank you. Thank you for the
clarification Mr Chair.
I mean, the example of
course is in San
Rafael, uh
100 and
$25,000
was requested first for
water meters
and uh the funding
went to the uh waste
management in uh
Gallup
instead of the county.
And then
uh
after doing some change
around the, the
said Rafael bought the water
meters on, on their
own and them
themselves without
spending any government money,
any state money, they just use their
own money. So now
we had 100 and $25,000.
Now, we are reallocate it
to equipment and
I believe they went before
the county
and asked you to be their funding
agency for this equipment.
Am I
correct,
>> Mr Chair Representative
Alcon? Yes, they did
put in a process because
of the counties not being
aware of the
special districts
um requesting
capital outlay and
requesting the fiscal
agent.
So San Rafael did
come before the governing
body and the
county agreed to be their fiscal
agent moving
forward.
>> So, but before that, so Mr
Chair, so before
that, you had no idea
that San Rafael had asked
for this funding at all. The
county did not have any
idea.
I'm
>> uh Mr
Chair Representative
Alcon, that is correct. We
did not have any idea.
So what happens with
IC IP um
As, as
Senator Munoz
stated is
that the,
the water districts can
put in on their IC IP
their request and they can also
submit a capital outlay
request, but they
do not have to let us know,
unfortunately, because they
can be their own fiscal
agents. Uh These water
districts can be their own
fiscal agents, but
because of the auditing rule
of 2013, um
they're unable to be their
own fiscal agents right
now. So
without requesting
um any
for the county to be the fiscal
agent, they put in a capital
outlay request and the county was
not aware of it
until the request went
through
>> that.
Thank you guys. Thank you for your
presentation. We're gonna
move on next
to Brendan
and we're gonna speed up this presentation
a little bit and catch up on
time,
Senator Novella and, and them
do have a caucus today, so they're
gonna be leaving shortly.
So let
me,
>> all right, Mr, chair
committee members, we're gonna be behind
Tab C.
Um I'm gonna be presenting
off a report that looks
like this
and kicking off our conversation
about economic development
with a deep dive on
new Mexico industry
clusters.
I forgot to introduce
myself. My name is Brendan Gray
economist at
LFC.
Um
And
so you've probably heard
of industry clusters
before. Uh There are
obvious big examples
like Silicon Valley, the auto
industry. Uh but
there's also lots and lots of small
examples of industry
clusters across the US,
non non-woven
textiles in North Carolina,
furniture manufacturing
in Mississippi boat
manufacturing in Maine.
They're very well documented and
well understood part
of modern economies.
Um And they can really be engines
for economic
growth.
Uh Clusters are
defined as groups
of businesses related
by business inputs
knowledge, skills demand,
labor suppliers,
distributors that
concentrate in a region
and by concentrating there
give themselves a
competitive
advantage
and that competitive advantage
then attracts
other related
firms, other suppliers,
other distributors.
Um and can be
an engine of economic
growth. But, but
more than just
the outcomes of
clusters cluster
framework can help us think
more strategically about
our economic development
ecosystem. We
can zoom out look
at the economy at a
30,000 ft
level, identify
some strengths and some
weaknesses and then
design our policy
interventions accordingly.
Really, it helps us get away
from smokestack
chasing or just trying
to lure the next big
thing and instead
maximize the impact
of our economic development
dollars.
Of course, New Mexico has lots
of economic
challenges. I think the
biggest is our per capita
income. If you look on
page one, the
chart on the top shows
per capita income across
the US. In
2023 we were
46th lowest
in the US and that was really
little change from 10
years ago when we were
48th
lowest.
There are lots of, lots of challenges,
lots of causes of
our low per capita income
diversification,
things like that
one big one is regional
disparities. We've
talked about that some
today already and we see that in
the economy as well
over the last five years,
private employment
in Albuquerque and
in Las Cruces has actually
outpaced the US as
a whole and has beat
some of our peers in Colorado
and in Arizona. So if the
rest of the state could keep up with that, that
would be great. Um But that's
not what's happening in
Siba County. Uh
Here, private
employment over the last five years
has actually decreased by
over 9%.
So there's broad economic
disparities and
that has, that holds
back our growth
overall.
One of the insights from
economic development research
is that we're going to accomplish
our economic development goals
based on our existing
strengths. We're not
gonna land some brand
new business that we've never seen
before. We're going to build
on what we have now.
And if we're going to do that,
then we have to start by
understanding what we're
made of what's making
the new Mexico economy work now.
So that's where we'll transition
to now. If you turn to
page two
on the report
table, one on the
left, this
is that snapshot of
the new Mexico economy,
our industry clusters,
these are um
defined by
Michael Porter and
other researchers at Harvard
University that are national
clusters that have been
tailored to New
Mexico.
And you'll see on that table,
local health services,
hospitality establishments,
those make up almost 30%
of our employment.
And then you can go down the list on the
other clusters that, that make up the
economy. One
thing to point out here is that
you'll see some clusters have
the word local
in front of them. A
local cluster is one
that primarily serves the New Mexico
economy. And
then in contrast, education and
knowledge creation, the
third one down on the
list or business
services that is a
trade-in cluster
and a traded cluster also
serves the New Mexico economy,
but also does business
nationally. And when it does
business nationally that brings in wealth
creates jobs.
And so generally economic
development focuses on those
traded clusters and
this report will dive
deeper into those traded
clusters
uh to do that if you'll
turn with me to page three
of the report table
two on
the top, right. Hand corner.
These are New Mexico's traded
clusters. So we're still at that
30,000 ft level.
This is what our traded
economy looks
like.
And you'll see there are really three
big clusters.
First is education
and knowledge creation.
These are our universities,
our national labs
and then other private
firms in research and
development.
Business services is
the second largest.
These are engineering
firms, our
consultants, uh
professional employer
organizations, things like
that. And then
the third largest is hospitality
and tourism. These are our
hotels, our
museums, this
is where our outdoor recreation
economy is
in. This is the cluster it's
in.
So those are the big
three. This is what our traded
employment looks like. Uh
This is the
ingredients if you will
that we're going to use to accomplish
our economic development
goals.
But of course,
our resources
aren't unlimited. We have
to prioritize
across these and
we should likely do
that based on
which of these is going to have
the highest
impact.
And so this report
tries
to
offers a framework on how we might
prioritize those.
And we use three
quantitative measures
to prioritize these
clusters.
First, we
look back at regional
diversity. Um
If you turn to page four
on the report,
uh the chart
on the left
shows the 10
year employment growth by
county in New Mexico. So this
is revisiting the point I made earlier
where there are really wide regional
disparities.
Um Los Alamos County
jumps off the page, over 30%
growth over the last 10
years, statewide was
about 6%. Most
counties had positive
growth. Um But 11
counties had negative
employment growth over that
period.
And there are three reasons why the
regional diversity of our
industry clusters
matters.
First,
economic development, research
tells us that a
job created in one
of these distressed labor
markets where employment
is decreasing, where
there's not all that many folks in the labor
force, a job created
in those areas is going to have
80% more impact
on long-term employment
rates than a job created
in a booming labor market like Los
Alamos or Burnley of
County.
The second reason
is an
equity
case,
labor force statistics
are correlated with social
outcomes and
public dollars should
prioritize those communities
that need it most.
And then the last
and then the last reason that we
focus on regional diversity
is that New Mexico is not
one economy, it's
10 or 12
different regional economies
and each of those different
regions have
different um
needs and have
different things they're competitive in. And
so we're focused just
on the I 25
Corridor. Well, then we're
gonna miss out on lots of
opportunity.
The second measure we
look at is competitiveness.
I talked earlier about
how clusters create a
competitive advantage
for their firms. We
can also look at competitiveness of
New Mexico as a
whole. We can
say we can estimate what
growth would have been in that
cluster had we
followed national trends,
we can compare what actually
happened to that
expected value. If
we're above it, great,
we're likely more competitive in that
cluster.
And if we're below it, then that's,
that's a red flag
that for some
reason, those business
inputs in New Mexico
are more expensive
than they are elsewhere.
Um And that might be a good, good
opportunity for a policy
intervention.
And then the last measure
that this report looks at is
wages because we're trying
to increase per capita income, we
want to be investing in
clusters that are,
that are high
wage.
So those are the three measures we looked at
to prioritize our industry
clusters. And if you turn to
page six, this is really the
heart of the
report.
And at the top of that page,
there is a prioritization
matrix. So
based on those three measures,
we've mapped out all
the different traded clusters
that the New Mexico economy is made
of. And we can
identify then our strengths
and our weaknesses and say,
which are likely going to have
the highest
impact.
The first overarching
takeaway is that those
clusters in the upper right
hand corner, these
are those that are likely
driving a lot of growth
at this point. And
especially
um let me
pause and take a step
back. Let me describe what this
table is, is
um
saying,
so in the upper portion
of the
matrix, those are
clusters that are more
competitive in New
Mexico. So they're growing
faster than they are
growing nationally.
They're growing faster in New Mexico than they
are nationally on the
bottom. Those are growing less fast
here than nationally
on the right hand side of
the table, these
are higher wage,
industry clusters,
left-hand, lower
wage and
in those clusters that are
bolded, those
are regionally diverse
industry clusters, meaning
they have a substantial presence
in three of the
state's 10 economic
regions defined
as commuting
zones.
So one of the
first takeaways from this
prioritization matrix
is those in those
clusters in the top right hand corner
are driving growth right
now and especially
those bold
clusters, education
and knowledge creation
and transportation and
logistics. So
investments in those
clusters is likely going to have
some of the highest impact because
they're already working.
Now.
In addition to looking at our strengths,
when we're zoomed out, looking
at the 30,000 ft level,
we can also identify
our weaknesses.
So for example, in the
upper left hand corner of
that chart, uh you'll see
the hospitality and
tourism cluster,
that's a competitive
cluster that's regionally
diverse, but
it's low wage.
Um And so interventions
into the hospitality and
tourism industry should be
focused on growing high
wage employment.
The good news there is that our
outdoor recreation economy
actually has higher than average
wages. And so if we're trying
to grow the hospitality and tourism
cluster, then we might
focus on outdoor recreation
economy because that's gonna
also have the benefit of having
higher than average wages.
Similarly, with business
services,
that's a high wage cluster
in the, in the bottom right hand
corner, that's a high wage
cluster. That's a regionally
diverse cluster, but it's not
as competitive in New
Mexico. So we don't have
the workforce that, that cluster
needs. We don't have the infrastructure
that there's not enough
capital. There's, they
don't have enough access to markets,
some business inputs, not
working in New Mexico.
So we might dig in
a little bit there and we might say,
hey, uh our engineering
firms, they don't have
enough engineering grads.
And so we could focus on graduating
more engineering students.
That would be a policy intervention
targeted towards
one of our
weaknesses.
And then the global takeaway
here is that overall,
the biggest weakness in the New
Mexico economy is our
competitiveness.
40% of
employers, 40%
of the jobs in our
traded industries are
not competitive in New
Mexico. So they're in
businesses that have
higher costs
here than they do
elsewhere. They have
less of a workforce,
not enough infrastructure,
site, site readiness,
roads, etcetera,
um or other business
inputs. And so
overall, um
the highest impact intervention
is going to be improving those
factors.
This is, of course, just one way of thinking
about it. Uh There's lots
of opportunities uh that
we can um think
strategically about how we're
prioritizing our clusters.
Um But this report
uh used those three measures and
had these findings
to close. I want to
talk about what we're doing now
and next steps.
So if you turn to page
seven on the
report at the top,
there's a table that
shows the state's
current nine
target industries,
these are identified by E
DD and the
governor. And
then it also shows the
share of total employment that
those target industries make
up.
The first thing that stood out to me
is that there's a lot of overlap
between these
target industries and what
I was just talking about.
So aerospace
cybersecurity
Biosciences, those
are squarely
within or likely pretty
closely related to the
education and knowledge creation
cluster. So that's a good
thing. There's some data to
support that. These
are our target industries,
some things that stand out. On the other
hand, uh these
are relatively
small, they make up a
relatively small part of the state
economy. Um
And then lastly, they're,
they're regionally isolated.
Um 70% of
jobs and the nine target
industries are
in Bernalillo County
alone. And
as I talked about, there are some
tradeoffs when we're
creating jobs
primarily in one of our
strongest labor markets
versus more
statewide.
And then lastly, table
five on
page seven. This
is our fy 23
state economic development
incentive spending.
This is where we're putting our money
now and we're a
bit top-heavy. You'll see
the film production tax credit.
That was 40% of fy
23 spending the
manufacturers, corporate income
tax apportionment election
and incentive for
manufacturers. That was
13%.
So, just in those two industries
alone, we're spending almost
half of our economic
development dollars
and even though they make up about
4.6%
of statewide
employment and
you have to go pretty far down
that table. About halfway.
You'll see the technology jobs
and research and development credit.
That's the state's
flagship incentive
for education
and knowledge creation.
And it made up
2% of fy
23 economic
development
spending.
And so one of the highest impact
industries that we likely have
is not getting very
much support from
these incentives.
What are the next steps? Where do we
go from here?
One of the encouraging things about
this report is we were able to
speak with the economic development
department. Uh Secretary
Roper, um
He indicated that the department
is intending to continue some of
this work looking at
the strengths and the weaknesses
of the science and technology
clusters in the state's nine
target industries, that's going to be a
great continuation.
Um If the committee is interested
in it, we could continue
down, there's a lot of work
still left to be done on
uh cluster thinking cluster
development, working
with our economic, our executive
partners um in building
that I think that's the next step.
Um And then lastly start
thinking about the the
policies we can use
to do to do cluster
development. That's a big
question, maybe a whole
report in and of itself.
Um But three
themes from case
studies of successful cluster
development. First,
it's a it's a private driven
activity. The private sector
is going to be the lead in
cluster development and the public
sector has a role to play.
Um but it's going
to be following the private
sector. The
second major insight
is the importance
of infrastructure.
Infrastructure is very
important both at the micro
level, got site
readiness, you know,
electricity, broadband,
things like that. Um
You also have at the macro level
quality of our roads, our
airports, things like
that. And then lastly
is people,
um strong leaders make
cluster cluster
development work, mayors,
business leaders, state
leaders, policymakers
and our workforce.
At the end of the day, our most
valuable asset in this
is our workforce. And
so uh kind of the bread and
butter of state government,
improving our education,
that's going to be um
one of the highest impact activities
we can do
uh Mr Chair with that
that covers the content of
my presentation and I'll
happily stand for
questions.
>> Thanks.
Thank you Mr Chair.
Mostly I just got to go on a
short rant because we have to
leave. So the very
first sentence over reliance on
oil and gas is a major economic
headwind. Ok,
great.
But we continue
to destroy everything that's not
oil and gas.
And I don't
understand,
I don't understand. So
a couple of years ago, we
had a chance to, to
be a world leader,
not a not AAA
American
leader, but a world leader in
carbon capture and
sequestration,
it was a developing thing.
Now, there's industries all
over the world that are doing it, they're
buying into it, they're
preparing to do it.
And we could have led the
way,
we could have led the way because San
Juan County has
the right
geologic formations.
And before we
decided to vote to destroy
San Juan County and mckinley County
and, and Sa County all at
once,
we had the uh with
power plants. We had
the, the, the things that we could
do that would have in fact
been economic
development for the state of New Mexico,
a whole brand new
world-class industry and we
voted to destroy
it.
Not only did we destroy that
industry, we destroyed power plants
in all three counties.
We destroyed jobs in
all three counties. We gutted
the Navajo middle
class
when we could have had
economic diversity
when we could have put more
people to work, not
fewer. So
we destroyed 1500 jobs.
We gutted the Navajo middle class
and we turned our back on
diversity.
Hydrogen.
We can do hydrogen now
too. All
of those trucks on I 40 they're getting
ready to turn them into hydrogen
trucks.
Toyota now has a
retrofit that they can put
on diesel trucks.
They're just looking for a hydrogen
infrastructure
and all of a sudden you take the, the,
the diesel trucks off the road, you
replace them with hydrogen. And
you know, who could make that
hydrogen? San
Juan mckinley, Insa County.
That's who would make that
hydrogen.
And yet we
voted not to do it.
Diversity. We don't
want
diversity.
I don't understand.
These were also all high wage
jobs. These
weren't minimum wage jobs.
After you build a solar
farm,
you get some pretty low jobs
and few of them.
Yeah, it takes a lot of people to build
it, but after it's
done, it's
few jobs
and not high wage and
we had a chance to make serious
high wage jobs here.
Infrastructure
right now, we're looking at how do we get
freight rail from Gallup
to Farmington
for the first time ever?
There's significant Navajo
cooperation and there's
also significant pushback
from what I call the cave people.
They're citizens against virtually
everything
that would be economic development
and that would also be ag economic
development in case you had noticed
Farmington is
Farm
Bloomfield
Flora vista water
flow. That was an AG
community. And
then people found out that they
could plant an, a natural
gas well, and make a
lot more money than if they
planted an apple
tree.
But you put rail in there
all of a sudden, all of that
ag comes back to life,
including southern Colorado
ag and south
East Utah
ag as well as
Navajo ag from
Nappy
huge.
If we would stop getting
in the way
it's us to get in the
way.
Do you know the
cleanest, cleanest
barrel of oil produced anywhere
in the world comes from New
Mexico.
The cleanest coal fired power
plant anywhere in the world used
to be in New Mexico,
the cleanest coal
in the world comes from New
Mexico. So if we want to
clean up the world, we
would ship New Mexico coal
to China. They're willing
to buy it by the way.
And that would be a lot cleaner than the
Indonesian coal that they're
burning right now. If we were
truly interested in cleaning up
the planet, we would produce
oil gas and coal. In New Mexico,
we wouldn't shut it down
and we would get out of our own way
with carbon capture and
hydrogen and,
and, and uh
uh infrastructure,
we just get out of our own
way.
You know, the carbon capture company
didn't want any of the incentives
on, on page seven, they
were going to pay
us,
they were going to pay taxes. They asked
for
nothing.
That first sentence is just
not
over reliance on oil and
gas. Ok.
Do something else. But
if we're not going to do something else,
rely on oil and gas,
that's fine with
me.
But I'm all open to something
else,
but the cave people have to
be
moved out of the way so we can
do something else. Thank
you.
>> I didn't think I voted for any
of that stuff. Maybe some of it,
but not all
of it. Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you. Mr Chairman
and, and thank you for the presentation.
Um I was, I would be curious
to see this 10 year employment
growth by county on page
four because
Kathryn Counties is at the
top
and I just want to know what have
we done?
I mean, I've lived there
in the area for 40 year,
57
years. Uh,
I, I wonder
what kind,
why were we, why is Capron
County at the top? So I would just like to
see a, a better
analogy of what
have we done to create jobs
there. But, uh, along
that line, Mr Chairman,
uh, is, is
the same thing a little bit
that Senator Sheer was talking
about is, uh, or
madam chair whoever.
Um, you
know, we keep,
we talk about
things happening in our
own districts.
We talk about the, the
prison here and we
talk about the,
the, the coal plants
in San Juan County.
I talk about in,
in Kathryn County, New Mexico.
We have a large,
um, hunting.
I mean, because we've shut down
the logging because
of the spotted owl. We've
reintroduced the wolf. So the
ranchers aren't having the best
time over there. Uh, we've
had fires.
Um, the, the,
the,
uh,
Gila wilderness
is an issue for
a lot of the locals.
And so as a state, we
keep putting up barriers,
but we keep whining about, we
need to economic development.
So I, I'm just curious
where I'd like to see more information
on that chart.
Um, the
other thing is I'm really happy
to see live leave, see,
livestock processing on
there. Boy, we worked
hard to finally get that bill
passed. And,
um, and so,
but I see the problems
with all of these
things that would be great
for more economic
development and high
wage
is
and, and you're calling them clusters.
Well, boy, New Mexico has a
cluster. I'll tell
you for sure
because we've got
pyramid taxing
on businesses. We've
got regulations that we
regulate people out of
business. We've
got higher
costs. Well, let's
reintroduce the paid family medical
leave. Let's reintroduce
more taxes
on and we can't get people
to come here because
they do business in Texas
and Arizona and Colorado all
around us
because they don't have
all of those things
in the, in the way that we want
to implement them and the things that we
are doing now,
um,
I wanted to know what is
intelligent
manufacturing.
It's on page seven
in the, in table
four,
>> Mr chair representative.
Um, so I'll start from
your last question. Um, intelligent
manufacturing. Uh, page
seven, table four. That's one
of the target industries
defined by, um Edd
and the governor's office.
My understanding primarily
that's Intel. Um,
that's what's really driving most
of that. Uh, but
there are a variety
of other
smaller manufacturing,
uh, firms in there. I
have to take a closer look, but Intel
is the big one there. Um
And then to your first question
about, uh Cathryn County,
um, the growth rate that, that,
that's a good find, of
course. Um,
the one thing I'd say is
with the smaller
counties, it's very sensitive
to outliers. And so
one employer that
opened up, right,
as the survey was being
collected, that could have a big impact,
swing it, you know, a couple
percentage points. Um So I'd
have to take a closer look, but I have
the data be happy to, to
show it to you. Um And
follow up.
>> Uh Thank you for that.
Um
You know, I I own a manufacturing
plant, Bosky Farms,
New Mexico,
where regulations
have about killed us.
Uh where the
Gacha Factor
instead of,
let's look at how can we
help you do business
better? Let's
find you for mistakes
that you make not
purposely.
Uh Let's wait to do an
inspection for
uh 16
years
between inspections, 16
years.
So those are the kinds
of things that I think
economic development would
be uh for the
state of New Mexico is having local
businesses.
Let's let's build up
local businesses that are already here.
Why do we have to
attract?
We have a lot of good
people here in New Mexico that
try to start up businesses.
But we, as
Senator Scherer would say
we put up
roadblocks. We don't hold
um the, the state
entities accountable. We don't,
the regulations are through the
roof. How do you open a
business? My husband and I bought a gas
station, Mr Chairman in Magdalena,
New Mexico because it was gonna go
under. So we
bought it there was no
helpful, anything
to try to figure out the regulations.
Where do, what do we need to get
inspected? How do we do
this? No, we had to
put like, figure it
out and
we did it because the locals
needed it.
And so there's
people in the state that want
to do business in New Mexico,
but the legislature
and the government keep putting up
barriers for that.
And so,
um
there's a lot of other things
that as I
stated before, that are,
are factors
in economic development other
than let's just have more
economic development. Well, let's remove
the barriers. These are all
barriers that I'm talking
about. And
so I, I appreciate
all that you do. Oh my
gosh, you guys are
amazing to give us
all this information and I really
do appreciate it, but
I would, I'm, I'm also just
gonna make a little comment on
the, the uh so
economic development and the
executive did
table four.
What about the people that are
really the boots on the ground?
Why don't they have any input,
which I guess is us? So
my input would say
let's get the local
people
remove barriers to
help them grow the businesses that they
already have in
place that are struggling.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative
de la Cruz.
Thank you, Chairman,
Representative Chatfield
brought to my attention.
Page eight, the the table
at the upper
left corner
and there's a pretty
daunting number
there of almost
300,000
to create a
job based on business
tax incentives.
But what I'm curious about,
obviously, that's a daunting number.
But what I'm curious about is,
is there a positive
multiplier effect
in response to that number? In other
words, we invested that amount
created a job,
the life of the
job, the house they
bought the groceries they buy. Is there
a multiplier that you can cite? That's
not here,
>> Mr Chair representative?
Great question.
Um You're,
you're, you're getting on to
the, to, to
one of the one of the key points
here. So the chart
on page eight,
that's the costs.
This doesn't have anything
to do with the benefits.
And in fact, those
benefits can be
quite large. You can have a
very well time tax
incentive that has
lots of, lots of
um
positive effects
across the economy.
In terms of the multiplier
effect, you can look at
how many jobs are created.
So for every one created
job, you get probably
two jobs
created elsewhere in the economy.
You could look at the economic
impact that could be anywhere
from, for every $1
invested. It's $10
created in an economy to
$50 created in an
economy. Um So
multipliers, the benefits
um is a bit of a different uh
conversation. But I think
you're, you're getting at um
a key policy consideration,
which is that looking at the
benefits is also
important,
>> Mr Chairman
I think it's
important to have that
almost side by side because
it's the other side of the
coin. And so
if I just see that one
number, I'm like, we're spending
a lot of money, but I don't see any
benefit, but that's not
reality. And I know
that from economic development
that there's always a multiplier
effect if it's working
and I suspect that it's working
if you're creating a high paying job. Thank
you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank >> you, >> uh
Senator
Gonzalez.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Thank you, Brennan. It was very
nice and very
um on
your presentation.
Um I have two
things. The
first one is on the,
on the 10 year
employment growth by
county. That's
page four
and
so
on. Any of the information
that you provided to
us
does population
within that county
matters.
>> Mr Chair, Senator,
great
question.
Population drives a lot
of employment. So the
demand for employment
is gonna change as the population
changes. I think you're,
you're absolutely right that population
changes is, is likely a
contributor at least
to some of these
uh disparities that we
see.
>> And uh maybe
to give you a little bit more
of a, an
example like it shows
Los Alamos being so
high,
but a lot of that
workforce, they don't live
there, they don't live in that
county,
you know. So is so
is it an accurate
number
to
say by county
or?
Well, I guess
going back to my question where
does the population fit
in? >> Mr
Chair, Senator? I see. Now, where your
question is that these are
jobs, the location
of jobs. So, you're
absolutely right that, um,
there could be a job created in the Los
Alamos County filled by somebody
who doesn't live in Los
Alamos and commutes
in.
>> Ok. Well, thank you. Um,
the other part
is
just right now, this
month
we're having all these graduations
statewide
and where does it show
anywhere about
retaining our big
investment that we put into all
these students for
keeping them in New
Mexico?
>> Mr Chair Senator,
um where
that's reflected here is in that
competitiveness. So
when we graduate
more students,
when they're higher educated
and when they have better outcomes,
that's reflected in statewide
competitiveness across the board. So
that's where that's reflected
that this wasn't that
uh specific question
wasn't included in this
report, but I know my colleagues
at LFC are preparing um
some other work in the
future specifically at
workforce credentials.
Um and the
connections with the higher
education
ecosystem that maybe
can dig into more of that
question
>> very well. Well, thank you.
Thank you, Mr Sherman. Thank you,
>> Representative
Chatfield.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
I just want to rant
a little
more
about page eight that we didn't look
at very closely.
Uh And uh the
uh representative, our
uh de la cruz
was speaking
about. Um I'm,
I'm looking at a several
classes of the two
highest cost
for per job is
296,000
for jobs created
by business
tax incentives
and over 300,000
per job.
Uh
in the manufacturing
industry.
Not too many jobs in
New Mexico pays $300,000
a year.
Not too many jobs in New
Mexico pay
$300,000 in
two years. Uh
So I would, we're
talking about a cost-benefit
ratio. I think
we need to, we need to
see a little more on these
numbers. How
long did the job last
that we created?
How much
did it pay?
And what, what
was the benefit?
How long did we
take to get our 300,000
back? Because we
spent 300,000
right away? Right.
And
maybe
when we have all those numbers
together and we look at
them, we would make
different choices
of where we put that
job creation.
And II, I believe that
is the point of
this uh graph.
No, we didn't talk about it too much.
But uh maybe
the point is that
we are not making the
best choices in
where to put our money.
Is that true? And are
there other numbers that you can
bring us in the
rest of the year coming
forward that would
help us talk a little
more wisely
about this
>> Mr Chair representative.
Great question. I think you hit the
nail on the head.
First thing is the chart
is uh national research.
So that's not um new New
Mexico numbers. These are
estimates from a
prominent economic development
researcher nationally.
Um But you're exactly
right that the tradeoffs
across the different
policy types are
really quite large. So
a job created through
business tax incentive, a
job created through specific
infrastructure, those are going to have
the same benefits,
but they might have really dra dramatically
different costs. And so the
benefit cost ratio is going
to be different and we might
consider putting our
money money toward the one
with lower costs. I think
your point is exactly right
in terms of the data available.
Um I think that is
something we could look at the
types of uh programs,
we have estimated
costs, estimated
benefits, put them side by
side um and
have a conversation like you're
getting at >> Mr
chair. If it's
possible, I would
love to see a little deeper dive
so that we know
where our money is most well
spent.
Thank you, Mr >> Chair
Representative Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Just
a comment. You know, everybody's
touched on it in this committee
today. You know, we're
our own worst enemies.
You know, we have too many rules and
regulations
and people who want to come into
our cities or our state
that we're just, you know, we're
running them out of here, you
know, Representative Armstrong touched
on that a little bit ago and,
you know, you can't open up a small
business in this, in this, in
this state because, you
know, the taxes are too high.
Uh There's too many rules, too
many regulations on anything
we try to do it just
did not work. And, you know, and
if we don't open our eyes to what's
happening, you know,
we're, we're slapping our own
hand, you know, where
this had to feed you, we're
cutting the hand off so you can't
feed each other anymore. And,
you know, we really, really need to look
at this, you know, all these
numbers that you're putting out here are
fine and, well, you know, but
uh, you know, like an oil
extraction there at 9
9%. You know,
that's the, the bread
and butter of the city of New Mexico,
take oil away from us to
see what we have. You know,
everybody wants clean air,
fresh water. I do just
as bad as everybody else does.
But the reality of it,
if we take it away,
we're not gonna have that bread and butter
anymore. And they were gonna be saying,
what do we do now? And you know, we're,
we're, we're hurting ourselves.
We really are. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you Brendan.
You know, you did this report
by yourself,
>> Mr Chair,
the econ team. Um
did it, I was the lead but the econ
team I helped as well. >> That's
good, pretty, pretty good report.
If you, you really have
to look into there and,
and I'll just kind of lead some people
if you look in and you look
on page five and you look
at film, tax
credit, video production, right? What
the cost for job is
and then you look on start
on page 32 and three
and you look at where video
production is only 2/10
of our 2/10
of a percent
of
the industry
cluster. And then the
traded cluster, it's only
1%. And you
look come back and you look at the film
tax credit on page seven.
We're investing 100 million,
not even to get 1%
in growth, That's a
large number to invest
in something that we're not getting that
growth instead of investing
in, in the target
industries that you have here,
like
outdoor recreation,
intelligent manufacturing,
I mean aerospace.
Um
then my new word for the name
is knowledge
creation,
right?
Where where should we target
our money? Right? And, and
those are where we should target it.
When, when you look, when
you spend our money on page
seven,
those aren't targeted in industries
that we're spending the majority of our
money at. So we really
gotta put each piece
of the puzzle in and look into each
industry I think and
then the cost per job,
right? And then you look
at the, the report on
Lida and where Lida
went, 60% went to,
to Albuquerque
out of Lida. And Lida is really not
functioning in rural
areas,
but that's where the
population growth is and that's
where people have to employ.
People.
Probably want to take another deeper
dive in
there
and really look at what our
cost
is
look at our cost is
Representative Lujan. You had a real quick
question. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. Yes,
I just wanted to
get into some of the the
prioritization matrix.
And I'm glad you
said
that you're still
developing this this
cluster thinking method.
Are there other states that are
have implemented this type of model
Mr Chair,
>> Mr Chair representative? Absolutely,
I would say it's one of the
most successful
overall strategies
that's been implemented in cities
and in states. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair and does
this does this
correlate with the 20
year
plan, the state's plan for
economic development,
which in and of itself
being 20 you know, where
are we with that? And with the updates with that,
Mr Chair,
>> Mr Chair representative,
I won't speak to
the uh status
of the 20 year plan.
Um I'm
happy to dig into that more.
This, this report was
I would say started with
the strategic plan
in mind, started with
that from square one built off of
that. Um So it was absolutely
considered uh
and happy to follow up with you on
the more specific
updates. >> Thank you. I really do
appreciate that because I do
see some really
gaps in here and where
New Mexico is going with economic
development, particularly
with climate tech economy.
And that that is a huge
focus for our state and our
executive right now
and, and as legislators
ourselves, you know, we
have, we have an
eta in place. We're looking
at how we are diversifying our
economy and how we are
developing that economy. And I don't
see this really represented, we
have some other parts of it and some of
these other tables you
have, but to really take a
deep there,
I'm not seeing
and really tying that to the benefit
of economy with that multiplier
effect as mentioned by others
today, Mr Chair, I think
it's really where we need to be focused
as infrastructure,
state and talking
about big infrastructure with
broadband, with transmission
lines and all of those
effects, how our
economy is building up
and where are we in that plan
and strategy? Because we
keep talking in silos,
we keep talking in
yesterday ISMs
if you will, Mr Chair and we're not
talking about where we
are today where we are in the future
because we are
in a critical place
where we are building
our economy and our economy
future. And that is in, that is
in that climate, tech economy.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Appreciate the
time. >> Thank
you and, and Brendan. So as we
go back in there and we really
look at some of these, maybe we're gonna
start targeting, but if you look
at the target numbers in, in
economic development,
right? Targeted
industries, those aren't our
drivers other than
outdoor wreck is on the, on
the drive.
Intelligent manufacturing is
really not a job creation
industry that takes away
from jobs.
That's just mobile
operation. That's why everybody's gonna
see a kiosk at every restaurant
and every time we go through mcdonald's or
you have the mobile app,
right? And
uh, so that's some
something that's not, it'll
create jobs in small
amounts but not large. So
in Phoenix, there's some guys
down there right now, they're looking
at all this from
bio, from the Biosciences.
And it's amazing to me to
see the university.
I see it all the time because we're,
I live closer to Arizona. It's quicker
to go to Arizona than it is to go to Santa
Fe. And you see
how a SU
is building building next to
Mayo, right? You
see how the city of Phoenix
and Scottsdale are all holding
hands in that whole area for
chip manufacturing.
That Intel plant
in, in Chandler.
It is
the largest plant in the world,
I think now. And it's, it's
just amazing to see the amount of
cranes. And then you go to the north
of, of Phoenix to
Happy Valley out there and you see
that other chip manufacturer
and the driving economy,
but they're all linked to each other
and they're all linked through
highered institutions.
Right? How has a
su succeeded to
become a university of
50,000 to a
population of 100 and
30,000? I
mean, our, in our, our highered
universities in New Mexico
are still, still
digging for dinosaur bones
and, and we're living in the A
I world competing
against that and those universities
have got to start stepping it
up. I mean, the
population growth in
universities are just
on the decline. If you look
at the, your
population growth in here.
Right. It's very
interesting in that
number to see a only 800
people swapped, right?
I don't know. What, what page is that
on
>> Mr Chair? I believe that's in
the newsletter.
>> It's in the newsletter. I
read it somewhere this morning,
but the population growth is
very interesting in how that
swabbed and
895
people moved in, right?
But 1600 people
died
and 1000
1100 more people moved
out of New Mexico
and the immigration
population increased by
3600.
I mean, that's a telling tale where
your population is going, right?
If you have 1000 people moving
out. Uh
and 1600 people
died. Right. That's
26 2700
job people and only
895 people
moved in. So
they're moving out for a specific
purpose. And so
we got to figure that out as we move
forward. But when
we come back and maybe not
in June, but maybe in
July, I don't know where we're at in
July, but let's
really pick
some three focus
factors. I really want to work
on this session. Or maybe it, it
may have to be six or
10 with a
60 day.
But I mean,
you really have to, for
me, I really have
to go from page one to
page
page six
to put the film numbers
back together to see how much
we're investing to get
1% of job growth
and, and how we target
those numbers. I
think
maybe if you could wrap those three
charts into three different charts
and then, and get
numbers in mckinley
County, like in mckinley County
on the job growth,
I don't know what number that is,
right.
I'm old and my eyes are
fading and so
is the bar graph
in, in job
growth. So, I mean,
that's really hard for me to comprehend.
I mean, I can
tell you in, in our
businesses, right?
They went from zero to
about 50 employees.
And so, I mean,
that's a lot of job growth in mckinley
County. And then I see the amount we
invested in certain places in mckinnon
County was zero job
growth, right? Tons
of money and zero job growth
and no economic
growth. And then I see the leader
that was put, I can only speak
from my county that was put
in that really never
came to fruition
and and never got to the
job creations that happened.
And so, I
mean,
growth is driven by
private development and
private developers, right
to move in and to move into
those sectors.
Um But we
got to figure that out as we move forward,
especially if we want to retain
people and not
have a 1100
move out
of state. That's probably all
job related,
maybe a little bit of health care,
but only 895
move in.
So in, in the
page seven is, is really
a talent tale, but that's
you gotta kind of put it all
together in one single page
for us or two pages
where we can look at the charts in
comparison, job
cost job growth,
largest job sector
growth, right? And
where where money should really be
targeted.
So
Mr Chair, happy to work on that. All right,
good job to your team.
Thanks.
Next, we
have
our economic development
panel.
I'm gonna let you guys in. We're gonna
try to get to lunch,
maybe a little bit
late
Evan, who's gonna start
us off?
>> I am Mr chairman.
Um
So for the record, my name is Evan
Williams. I'm still the
executive director at the Northwest
Mexico Council
of Governments.
Um Today, we were asked
uh by LC
staff uh Mr
Chairman to come in front of you and
present on kind
of the the correlation
between infrastructure and
economic growth.
Um I know some of the comments
earlier in the welcoming
address, really set
the stage for this, this
conversation.
Um
Mr Chairman, I'm just gonna give you a
little bit of background on
what what's called councils of
government. >> Hold on
one second for me. Uh
for this afternoon's
tour to the prison, there's a sign
up sheet mayor. I mean,
if you got ws wanna go, we need to
kind of know who's going to the
prison. If
somebody else want to go with us, we
just kind of need to have a head count
when they go in there. So we're
gonna pass this around, make sure everybody
signs that sheet.
>> Yeah, no problem. Um
So just a little bit of background on
what cogs and economic
development districts are in the
state of New Mexico.
Um For those
probably not familiar with
us. Um We've
been around for about
50 years
um created kind of
under the the New Deal
programs to help rural
communities kind of
bridge gaps and planning
and resource development
um throughout the nation.
Uh New Mexico, uh
we were founded by
Executive order and
then most of us were put into
action through joint powers
agreement of local
entities. There's seven
of us in the state
um that cover the entire
state. Um
The State Association
on the loose association
of all of us is called Newmark,
the New Mexico
um Association
of Regional Councils. Our
chairman is Priscilla
Lucero, um
who runs the Southwest
Council of Governments. I
always joke with Mr Chairman
and, and the folks from my
region. Unfortunately,
we're district one but you probably
have the worst executive
director of the seven.
So I do apologize
for, for not being
the best of the the group.
But in the state, we
have really seven strong
uh councils of governments economic
development districts.
Um We lost
two of them this year.
Um uh Hubert
Quintana and uh
just recently, Lee
Tilman were former
cog directors uh that
folks would know around the table.
So hearts go out to their
families. Uh We did
provide an impact of the
funding that we received from the
state. So there's one appropriation
for about 700,000
in house built two under
kind of uh
membership and special
services under D
FA. Uh We all
receive 1/7 of
that. So we put a return on
investment report of what we did
last year, we return
about 300 to 1 on
those dollars. Uh We
provided that to the LC
chairman last year and we'll
update that and provide it
again. Uh We
think we're a pretty good investment
for New Mexico
uh helping communities.
So for my
Council of Governments going
into page three,
I did want to recognize some
of the, the board members
that I have in the room. Uh
You saw Mayor
uh Garcia this morning.
I also had Councilor Beverly
Beverly Michael, both
representing the city of Grants
uh for Sebola County,
Judy Hora, who helped
you understand how they do
capital outlay. And
then for the mill village of
Milan, I have uh manager
uh Candy Williams. So
I just wanted to recognize uh
some of my local board
members who are here to
make sure I don't act up or
get out of line. Uh We
do represent the best district
in the state uh Northwest
New Mexico with our three
counties of San Juan mckinley
and Sebola.
Um On
slide number five,
it's kind of a snapshot of our
region. Again,
we've got 10 local governments,
five tribal governments
which includes Raymon
Navajo. Uh but
Popo is a Akima
Laguna
um
uh Zuni and
the Navajo Nation.
Um We cover about
15,000 square miles.
So about the state
state size of New
Jersey serve over
200,000 people
and have a high population
density throughout our
region. Um
the uh map uh
if it was in color
would showcase that some
of the issues related to
infrastructure are
lack of public lands.
So like in San Juan County,
for instance, only
10% of the properties
there are private, most
of it's held by the federal government
or other uh government
entities, including
the tribal entities. So
that makes development really
hard when you don't have lots
of private land to work
with. Uh We also have
checkerboarding, which is
kind of the jurisdictional
overlapping of, of things.
So when you're building a transmission
line, you may go through
six different jurisdictions,
all with their own specific
rightway processes.
So you'll see projects slow down
in our region because
of those jurisdictional
challenges. And
then um
the other complication with
economic development. As you heard
from the cluster analysis
is we have three
distinct economic
regions according to Michael
Porter. Uh San
Juan County relates to the
four corners and really
is the engine of that
economy mckinley
County, as Senator Munoz
mentioned is part of the
Phoenix MS A
uh most people
travel there um
to get their needs
met. And then Sebola
County is actually in the Albuquerque
Metro. So when it comes
to regional planning, I've got three
very distinct
economic regions
which makes it a little
challenging just from a
cog structure on page
six. This
is, it's
taken me 20 plus
years to, to be able to
do this, but we're, we're
created by the State of New Mexico
as a state planning and development
district. So our
challenge is to go work with our
72 communities
and help them with
infrastructure, strategic
planning, resource
development. And
so we work with the
IC IP S the capital
outlay process,
uh grant
writing, supporting
them on projects,
basically just trying to make
their community vision
happen. That's the
bottom line goal while
trying to link our,
our communities together because
we know we're stronger and
can speak louder with one
voice. We're also a
federally designated
Economic Development
under the US Economic
Development Administration.
So we're responsible to
kind of put the global
regional strategy
for our region and create
portfolios of
projects uh
and strategies for
communities to follow
um to meet their
economic challenges.
So we've been around about
50 years, we really have
three base programs, the state
grant aid money, we receive
the ed A uh
partnership planning
grant that we receive
and then New Mexico
dot Our members
are, what kind
of sustains us.
Each of those programs has a
match. So like the state money,
we have to match 1 to 1.
So we use our member
uh contributions to be able to
come up with those matches.
Our members have been very
generous and we have a different
relationship than most
cogs. We actually have work
programs for them.
So based on the dollar amount
of what they pay in, they can
expect, Xy and Z
services. So
you'll find that to be a little different
than, than other cogs around the
state. Um
Again, I'm not the
cog uh I have a
very strong team
that's represented on page seven.
I'm the only one not from
the region. So I'm
really an anomaly
within our,
our history. Everybody
has kind of been uh
from the area. So
we've grown our own, we've
brought people back home.
Uh We're very proud of our
team because they serve uh
the communities they come from.
Uh And that's what makes
them get up in the morning. It's definitely
not the paycheck, our
annual work program, just kind
of showing the diversity of things
that we do. Um
You know, from what we call
project tier, which is
taking an idea
all the way to design,
to construction, to
funding to
asset management. We'll talk
about that in a second.
On page nine is
our uh what's
called Comprehensive Economic
Development Strategy
and it's built on
the foundations
of good economic development.
We, I'm a certified
economic developer. I
think there's three of us in my
region. Currently, there's
about 1000 na
nationally
through the International
Economic Development Council.
So we not only use the cluster
analysis that was provided to you
before, but we overlay
it with location quotients
uh input output
analysis,
the potential
recruitment opportunities coming out
of the partnership, what deals are
trying to be made
and then we actually look
at deals that have been done
within the last couple of years
in the four state area.
If deals aren't getting done,
then they're probably not
targets for us
in, in the near
term. Uh Again,
we kind of manage and
break down our strategies
into a portfolio of
projects.
Um The next
slide that is on
10. Um
If you, if you just boil
our strategy down to the
basic is energy
plus logistics
equal manufacturing.
That's the whole strategy
for Northwest New Mexico.
We have energy
assets, everybody's
looking for baseload, dispatchable
energy. We are
the energy region,
energy innovators
that you heard. Senator Shar
always speak passionately
about, but we're all
the above. Uh we just
want to provide energy for
world stability and
for our local economies.
So we don't want to turn our back on our
energy assets. We need to be looking
for the future of energy.
The economics
of heat is really
an important thing
happening across regions
with regard to energy
areas. We think
we have a competitive
advantage in energy
and we'll continue to have a
competitive advantage in
energy. So,
again, short term, we're really
looking at those energy assets
and how we maximize
those.
But we also see
that we're on I 40
that we have the Burlington
Northern Transcom Line.
Um And so we have logistical
advantages, especially in these
two counties that
exist that can
be added to. So if you're
a business, you're looking at inputs,
right? What, what's the
cost of energy, what's the cost
of shipping? Uh And
if we can do a better job than
anybody else in those two
categories, we
feel like we can get to advanced
manufacturing.
Um And there's a lot
under that events, manufacturing
strategy. Most of
it's centered at Navajo Technical
University and their center of
events. Manufacturing. There's
a new paradigm of
manufacturing that
talks about um not
having to put out millions and
millions of widgets and needing
m millions and millions of square
foot buildings, but producing
high-value products
um based on technology
with people like good paying
jobs in
communities that probably haven't
had economic development
before because they've had
limited infrastructure
but being able to sell those
products to people like NASA
that will pay a high dollar
because of all of the
Q A QC that goes into
those products. So we're looking
at more of a niche, advanced
manufacturing. And
so for us, our work breaks
down into two real
buckets which is
strategic infrastructure,
um and shovel ready
sites. Those are the two things
that we feel like we've
got to do a better job than
anybody else to
compete and that the
cog can help lead
with our partners. A
lot of them are in the room
today. So when I use the
wii it's the rural
we or it's the
rural
r we uh
sorry. Um
But talking about the team
because economic development is
not only a team sport, it's a blood
sport. Uh And if you're
not real willing to play like
that, uh and play
together and have a
really good Moneyball type
team that's willing to work
together with all our quirks.
You're not, you're not gonna be very
competitive. So slide
11 is Aragon National
Labs that basically
started rolling down into
scoring communities
on, on some of the
assets. So we talk about human
capital, financial capital,
industrial composition,
infrastructure,
capacity, and
partnerships. And
I just grabbed a, a
county in New Jersey
to compare to because I felt
like it was as different as anything
else. And I, I
didn't, I did
know, the economic developer
there for about 21 years,
uh who went on to be the county
manager for about 19 years.
So got a little
familiarity. But when you're looking
at mckinley County, just
in terms of human capital,
you can see,
um there's,
there's a very limited
amount of
skilled
workers, uh
high degreed
individuals. Um
And so you're, you're already in a
disadvantage there.
Um financial
capacity there, there's no
access to capital.
Um very
limited. Um
Industrial composition is
actually pretty good.
In comparison,
infrastructure is
0.01
meaning we
need it all. So
I know you heard that today, you'll
hear it again from me, but
we're so far behind the power
curve on infrastructure
even though we have some
strategic assets.
Um um
That's really where
um this presentation
leads, you can see in Sebola
County, they have like
89%
uh competitive advantage
in institutions and
partnerships. And I think
that's represented today,
I think in communities where you have
to partner, you do uh
communities where you don't have to
partner, you don't. And so
Kudos to Sebola County for
always working together.
Next slide project
12 is, is really how our
cog does our work,
we call it projecting. I
think we coined that phrase.
Uh Basically, we
try to create project tiers,
someone that in our office can
take a project from. I've
got a wild idea
all the way to let's do the
feasibility around it.
Let's start getting the master
planning around it. Let's
start working on some design
funding. Let's figure
out a portfolio
of funding strategies
that you could choose. Let's put
you on a timeline to start knocking
those out and then let's
get your project constructed
and let's not forget about asset
management. So that's
really a lot of the work we
do is full
um cycle planning,
full circle funding
is what we call that.
Um And that's really our project
tier hat. Um There's
an example of how we've worked with the
tourism department to help
them identify
catalytic projects in
IC IP S in our
communities and then
translate those into
destination forward
investments. I think it's a
good uh example,
I'll just leave it with you there.
I think if we're doing that kind
of in economic development through the
fund it um
initiative um
that would really superpower
the linkage between infrastructure
and economic development.
On slide 14, these were
some infrastructure needs. I'd
put together a couple of
years ago for the rural, a
rural committee. And
so what I wanted to explain
um is we
look at infrastructure through
four lenses,
we need basic
infrastructure.
Um We've got folks
without running water. Uh
never had electricity
um need
sanitary survey, bathroom
additions in their houses.
Um I remember presenting
years ago to the sub-committee on
Capitol. A most of you
probably don't know that existed,
but I used to take a,
I would say a whip
by Ed Sandoval.
Representative Sandoval and do
Whitaker and they put me
through the ring and asked me what my
bonding capacity,
why your community be
paying for this and yourself?
Why do you need capital L A?
What's the purpose? What's the
mission? Are you gonna be
on time? Are you gonna deliver
those dollars? I think
people like at that time
represent Gonzalez.
Representative Nunez helped sneak
me through that process
because I didn't know anything.
Um But I remember
presenting uh behind the
Albuquerque zoo who
was asking for a capital outlay
for a penguin, which
we're not against penguins in
Northwest New Mexico.
We all want to go to the zoo
and we all do. But we were
asking for, for running
water for people who've never had
it. So those are
stark differences
and needs for communities.
Um And that always stays with
me because that's what
we're looking for. Just getting
people up to the basic
infrastructure level can't
have economic development, community
development without taking
care of those things. First, you
heard about traditional infrastructure
this morning, we've got 80
year old pipes, we got cast
iron lead iron
pipes um that
have to come out and it's all hitting
us right. At the same time,
a lot of the investments were made
in the sixties and seventies
through great federal programs
that weren't low loan programs
like they are today. Um
So communities took advantage of
those. So uh the great
thing was we built 80 years
worth of infrastructure. The bad news
is now we got to replace
it and it's gonna be
100 eggs. The cost of
what we put it in for. So
that's where we're at. With traditional
infrastructure, water
wastewater, all
across our communities need to
be replaced uh
in in a massive way.
And then we talk about strategic
infrastructure. So taking
an economic development
project and understanding
from either a housing
project all the way to an
industrial park. I need
broadband, I need three phase
power, I need sewer
investments. I need
everything to that site.
And then from there, the developer
can build out the
remaining infrastructure.
So it's really targeted
infrastructure that gets
you private investment.
Like Senator Muil said,
the dollars, the public
dollars that lead to the
major private investment.
And so you all have helped
through through kind of the
flexible leader to
allow us to
invest those dollars
into infrastructure
that leads to those and
infrastructure that doesn't leave with
the business, it's community
infrastructure. Um
and then there's vertical infrastructure
and I know you guys have heard about
spec buildings and
and a number of those
things. So I
just wanted to close
by walking through kind
of a quick example
um
that
um drills
into the shovel ready site.
So what we noticed
is when developers
come down, they have two
questions. Uh
where are you gonna put me
and how much is it gonna cost?
Uh And if you don't have any
answers to those questions,
you ain't in the game.
After that, they typically
ask you two more questions.
Where is my workforce gonna
come from and where's my
workforce gonna come from?
Uh Workforce is
where we used to
chase businesses,
the businesses are now chasing
the workforce. So the
paradigm is shifting. And
so again, it's great
that we're doing kind of cradle
to careers or career pathways
across our region
that switch that,
that alignment
of K through
12 college
and workforce programs and
the economic strategies
at the end of the day, that alignment
is going to really
propel our communities
into success.
Um But what we looked at was
what was going on in Las Luna.
You know, we get jealous of people
outside our, our area
and also what was going on with San
Teresa. We said, you know,
what are these guys doing
that are making them successful?
And they really were building
from their assets,
which is the same approach
we take, we don't try to
create something new, we try to
build on what we have.
So we looked at Las Luna and
said, man, they're a certified site
with, with BNSF Railway.
How do we start developing
rail served industrial
parks? Because when we see
the potential recruitment
opportunities, not only
do they want a spec building,
uh not only do they want lots
of water and power that we might
not be able to provide, but
they want rail serve.
And so we looked at what
was going on in Los Luas. And the
vision we had was you get
off in a plane in
Albuquerque where
your business looking to really
expand and you
get off in Albuquerque, go down to
Los Luas and maybe say they're
too full. What else do you
got? And then we
wanted the hope was we
would go to grants and
have an industrial park to
Milan, have a certified
industrial park down to
Pruitt uh for
an industrial park and then
gallop and have four
Burlington Northern certified
sites um that we
can market as a region and
again, as a state, you
know, anywhere they land is good
for us. So we were
trying to get in the game.
So again, we looked
at four sites kind of in
this area that this will
Industrial Park, um
the Milan Industrial Park, the
Milan Business Park and then
the Pruitt Industrial Park.
The, the story I wanted to give
you today was the Milan Industrial
Park.
Um
uh So there's,
there's, there's been
a lot of work um
over the years and
it just refines what
we have learned in economic
development. There's eight steps to real
estate development.
So you have a preve
process basically
making sure the land is
not, um is
appraised, is not in the
floodplain, it's gonna be
suitable uh
purchasable
um doesn't have any
brownfield uh issues
on it. Um And
then you start working down
that that development list.
You do a market feasibility
analysis to make sure
you're not just building it and they will
come, you actually
know that it's feasible,
businesses want that
asset. Then you start
doing site and engineering
analysis. Um
you get financing
and then you uh
get involved with
a contractor to,
to negotiations.
If it's coming from the public
private partnership
standpoint, then you
construct your project,
then you start marketing
your property, which
I know we love doing the marketing
first and then we
start talking about kind of the
building and occupancy
management. What are they gonna
pay? How long are they gonna
pay it? What are the
incentives uh to give
them? So, on
slide number 16,
um this is kind
of the steps that have happened
and it shows you how long these
projects can take.
But the village of Milan
acquired uh the old Mormon
farm in 2003
came with some
agricultural and other water
rights, which is really
the purpose was uh
as you know, to lock up
water rights for the future of the
community. Um
There was uh several
kind of master planning
processes
um that happened.
Um We had
not done a brownfields
analysis. So, but
cog actually helped uh get
some money from Environment department.
Shout out to the Brownfields
Unit uh for always
being there for us even
when we don't follow our
steps. Um
And they invested heavily. This
site is just downstream
from Super Fund site
uh for or Uranium
Mill. Um So we had
to put a lot of money
into groundwater
monitoring and testing.
Um Luckily, it came
back that for industrial use,
this property would be suitable.
There were a couple of minor things that
have to be remediated
but um the
environmental didn't stop
us. We also had
certain portions of the
property and the drainage. So
we had to do recanalization
of the Rio San Jose,
which meant working with Army
Corps and a number of
others to get that done.
Uh Not an easy process,
then we did our market feasibility.
We went to New Mexico Finance
Authority, got two planning
grants, one from each
county to actually drill
down on our specific target
markets. So taking those
cluster analysis
and actually finding the next
codes of the businesses
that we're looking to attract
and who would move there.
Um Again, we
did uh get
some funding from Representative
Garcia um to
do 30% design
to build out this property.
Um
We also got some funding
from Ed A to do a
spec building. So we have 100
and 20,000
square foot spec
building. Uh If you're ready
to build and have $50
million we're ready to do it
tomorrow. Um But
we wanted, we knew we wouldn't
get a spec building, but we wanted
to be able to show developers.
We had one that could be
tweaked and, and
uh redesigned around
their, their needs,
but that we had already invested
$100,000 into that
design. Um
We move to 60%
design and then we got a big
chunk from Economic
Development Administration to do
final design. So we
have a shovel ready site, not
just for phase one but
for the entire property
um that, that
we can build infrastructure all
day long. So back
up those two trucks
and uh we'll go to
work.
Um
um We did a couple of lo
applications uh under
that flexible program. I think
you call it the municipal program.
Um We were denied a
couple of times. Uh We won't
get into that. Um
We applied for a huge ed
a grant, $25
million.75 million for
the entire region.
Uh Two communities
in New Mexico got through the first
round Albuquerque, Santa
Fe. We didn't get even
in the first round. So we were a little
disappointed, 25
million would have built out this site at
that time. Of course,
the prices have gone up. So
again, we don't stop.
So we just keep going. We,
we applied to Ed A for $8
million. I said, we, that, that's
way too much. You need
more local and state match.
We said, ok, uh we
got to figure that out. Of
course, the village of Milan was
telling us, you know, you
guys can't target other
basic and traditional
infrastructure funds. You have
to gound economic
development purpose
funds because we have needs
our village have to be met
at the same time that we're
growing. So we
were able to put a couple of things
together recently.
Um We hit your
uh your new Match grant
program uh when it
was in its infancy
last time. Now, I think
you've capitalized it at
75 million. We
were able to get 600,000
out of that. Able
to take that
600,000.
We got about 84,000
of local funds
um able to leverage that
2.7 with
Ed A and then
able to go after a special
recovery program,
uh economic
recovery funding for a million.
So we've been able to raise
um close to $4
million. Our intention is to put
that into the access road
show people we're open
for business. Um
But that's just kind
of the first stack that we've been
working on. Um
Shout out to the village
and, and Sebo communities
economic development.
Again, we help with kind of
that global strategy. But those
are the folks on the
frontlines every day doing
economic development.
So that's where you know, we
can start doubling down on this
strategic infrastructure,
start building these sites.
I know there was funding
in the budget for the,
the, the state Economic
Development Department to do some
site analysis. We
would love them to come and look at the
work we've done. Um
We think we have some great
sites with great potential
um that
we want to be motivated
um and ready
to build on. So with
that, Mr Chairman, I would turn
my uh the rest
of the presentation if that's
OK with to
Donald.
>> Good morning. My name
is, you gotta turn
on the mic uh Good
morning. My name is Don Jamil.
I am the Executive Director
of the Grant Sebola Chamber of
Commerce and the New Mexico
Mining Museum.
Um The
way we are set up is
uh we actually
partner with the city of Grants
uh with their
promotions, uh uh
billboards for
the area and we've done
so that for a long time.
Uh So the Chamber is housed
in the New Mexico Mining Museum. So a lot
of tourism uh tourists
to the area and it's on route 66.
And route 66 right
now is quite the hot topic. So,
we're getting a lot of, uh, travelers
in the mining museum. A
low hanging fruit. Ours,
um, such as the state, uh,
is focused on
outdoor recreation.
Uh, outdoor recreation in Sebola
County is growing. It's
thriving. I'm a hiker
myself. I go Mount
Taylor Gooseberry trail all the time
and everyone
that I see up there, they're not
from the local area. They're
from afar.
Albuquerque, Taos,
Colorado. So
that's encouraging.
And that's on a weekly basis.
Yeah, I live on the road
up to the Zuni Canyon Mountains.
The traffic in, on
into Zuni Mountain is just
growing and growing
and it's it. And I could tell,
I could tell who could afford those
nice jeeps. A lot
of local people can't just afford
those types of jeeps. So I know it's a lot
of, a lot of towners, a lot of
motorcyclists are
coming through the area. So
outdoor recreation
is, is huge for us and,
and it's growing in
our area. The route 66
centennial we're focused on
that. I mean, it's a
big thing. We're getting
tourists from all over
the world today because they're
trying to beat the rush.
We hear that on a regular
basis at the New Mexico Mining
Museum we're in here this
because we don't want to do it
in 2026 when everyone else
is doing it. So that's
very encouraging. And
the state with the state support
because I know there's a committee, I just was
at a conference yesterday in
Albuquerque where
the Route 66 centennial
is a big focus. Our,
our Chamber of Commerce also
hosts events for the area.
So all this infrastructure,
it's orange barrels
all over the place in grants. I
think there's a couple
bridges being built
USDA project on Santa
Fe Avenue. Verse 66 is
getting a face lift.
It's amazing. The tourists
understand that the orange
barrels, that's a
positive sign. So
thankfully that uh
there's a lot of work being
done. And that
basically just means in short
for the Chamber of Commerce, quality of
life, quality
of life in our town.
Um Formerly
I was a project coordinator for
the for the City of Grants
and Evans. Correct. It does
take a team. You need good
engineers, you need
a good cog
behind you because a
lot of times in small towns,
even when I started doing projects,
um even though I ran a
newspaper for 20 years and I
knew all the problems, but I didn't
know how to fix them because that's usually
how newspapers are the media,
they point out all the issues,
but few people
offer uh uh answers.
But anyway, there were a couple
of projects but today, the
city of Grants
currently has
today and that's not the plan
projects in the future 20 to
$30 million
in the ground today.
That's encouraging, that's
huge for a small
town of 9000 people.
And, and that's with the
assistance of a
good engineer, a good
cog and a good
uh admin at City
Hall and good
uh elected
official support. So it all
ties to quality of life.
Um The the infrastructure,
it's a there's a plan in
place. Um you
know, there was a time that the city of grants,
we just didn't have a
plan. Currently, there
are projects in place
just like Evan said,
two trucks back
them up the USDA
project on Santa Fe Avenue.
Today is phase one.
There are plans for phase
234 and five.
So that, that's a true
statement. You got
$20 million bring it here because
there are several plans
in place. Uh
you know, that
are shovel ready, I mean, find
a little fine tuning. I you
guys are probably with engineers.
You have a good engineer. You could only go
so far
until uh
you have to do
it all over again because it's, it's
shelf life is only so
long. So um
uh currently the
city of grounds probably has projects
for the next 5 to 10 years.
Thankfully, because it took a good
engineer. It took a good
co cog a
good administration at City
Hall and elected official
support. Um
Let me see uh a good
example of a project that
we collaborate with.
You know, you, you get the bang for
the buck is
uh the uh
with the schools,
the, the city collaborates
with the school district
and we both apply from
the same pot of funds
for the same projects. So
we've been able to double the
money for particular
projects because we've worked,
worked with the school district
more and more. That's,
that's uh how you get
some projects. Then you, you work
with the school district, you work with
the neighboring community or,
or you work with another small uh
government agency in
town. Um
uh A lot of our
trails. Uh
Our trail initiative is
huge. Uh
We, we, I think we're building
our third trail. Now. We
built our first trail about five
years ago and these local
trails are connecting to the
outside trails. The Continental
Divide trail, the,
there's another trail, I
don't quite remember
the name of it, but it's nice
because it's, it's about quality
of life because so you get these
locals
from their front door,
they can walk out the door,
walk
into a local
trail and end up
on the Continental Divide trail that's
going through town and you end up on the
mount on top of Mount
Taylor and looking
at the whole vast region
and you don't even have to drive a car.
So that, that's the
strategy. That's the plan. It's
taken us
56 years to
get to the point to where, where
we are at now. But actually
our, our current trail that we're
building now, it's going
to connect to a trail that's going through
town and we'll take you
on to Mount Taylor
and it's all planning
strategy.
Um A good
engineer, a good
cog and
administrative support. I know I've
repeated that several times,
but that means so much. I've
always thought that if you could get a
community after I was
in projects for so many years,
if you could get a community
to support
design and
planning, the state
will provide
construction funding or
the state or federal government will
provide uh
construction funding
because you have fight in the
game already. You've planned
it, you've designed it,
apply for
construction funding in a lot of
cases. That's how a
lot of our projects
have gone to where
they're at. Uh
Let me see if there's anything
else
grants bio park.
It's a part of
a, it's part of the trail system
right in the center of town.
We all see the river walking
downtown grants. There's a
plan for a bio
park that has an economical
uh aspect to it.
Um uh
stores,
shops and such.
And another good example
of a partner project is Mesa
Elementary School, the school
district, we received
funding for a new elementary.
However, the the roads
and the water
challenges
around it weren't there. So,
in collaboration and working with
the schools 56 years
ago, now,
today they're building a new mesa
view and there's new roads going
all the way around it, the roads the
city is doing the
schools uh is
obviously the school districts doing.
So that's another project that we
work with another
agency. Um
And just something
II I think
means something. It means a lot to
me is we built,
oh, I, I think we build like
78 in five
years. Anyway, the bridge that's
getting completed now,
it's just not another Box
Culvert bridge. It's a
bridge that has brick
on it. There's some flavor to it.
You know, it looks nice. It's, it's
actually gonna be a landmark
I would consider for the city
of grants.
So
projects like that, they mean a
lot to the community. Anyway,
bottom line is with
uh with you guys
support and
uh with people pushing
the projects
at the end of the day, it's a
quality of life issue
and we appreciate
that.
Um That's
pretty much it. I stand for
questions or
both them and I >> thank you. Do
you know if they stock the
the riverwalk
>> stopped it, >> stocked it
with fish yet. >> Oh,
yeah, about a month ago I
saw G and fish out there.
>> Representative Da La Cruz loves
to go fishing.
So you may, you may see
him over there in the evening or this
afternoon with his fishing
pole. Uh
I don't see any questions from committee
members. Let me ask you one
thing in,
in,
I'll think of her name for just a
second if we built
you a $50 million
building,
how quickly would someone occupy
that?
You don't have to step up to the
mke and
room?
Yeah, Matt, what's her name?
>> Senator Munoz
and um, committee
members, we would be able
to fill it
very quickly.
We don't have
any uh existing
buildings that are available
to occupy
immediately. And
so that's why that spec building
design is so important.
100,000
square feet spec
building and
the requests are
obviously much larger
than that, but that one can be
expandable.
You put a building on the ground and
I'll get somebody in there
quickly.
>> That's what they all say right
at the end of the day.
And, but I mean,
you'd have to have a contract
in place like a contingency.
If you furnish this or you get
this, then we'd be
able to do
come. Right? >> Is
it, is this, does this
have to happen within one
fiscal year?
>> No, there's no way to build that size
of building within one fiscal year.
But I'm just saying we
all talk about, oh laying the
infrastructure and lane and development,
right? And then we
get to the end point and we say, ok,
we laid all this infrastructure and
development. Well, well,
where is the contract
that puts somebody in
that building? Because
at the end of the day, you can
build a lot of empty buildings
across the state. And
everybody's saying no, they're gonna come, they're
gonna come. But
that's not our goal. Our goal is
job creation. You just in the
previous report, if you just look
at the, the job
creation cost $300,000
per job. Right.
>> So, what I do is
when I, I
travel or when I
recruit out of state
or even, you know,
doing a bre
in state, I keep a
list of those
companies who
obviously are
looking. But
that Milan or Sila
County or Grants was
ideal for them,
but for
the building.
Right. And so,
um, it's not a very
long list, but
it is a list of
customers who are
interested in locating
in those parks. And
we get the comment
when you get a building on the
ground, give us a call
when you get the rail spur
completed, give us a
call. So
we're working on
foundational
uh issues now,
gas, water,
electricity on
site, not just at the
perimeter and
broadband as well,
but yes, I
have a list that I
can call and say, ok,
we have what you need. Now,
are you ready to come?
We're gonna have what you
need in three
years when you sign the
contract income.
So >> I
think that's a quick question.
I mean,
I mean, they're looking
for, they're looking for a little
more than what Evan said. Number one, they're
gonna look at your educational system,
their health care system, how many
employees are available,
right? And the numbers
that I quoted out of the report and
you guys are more than welcome
to. I think it's online,
but you can also get a copy of
that number moving
in and out of state, I mean,
that's a big question.
And then,
I mean, you're able
to, to rail
your, your product
back out, but
rail it in,
but the problem becomes what,
what metropolitan
area we're going to serve for that
product because that's the
shortline
destination
because you build that. So, I
mean, >> so
we know that we have as
much in migration as we
do out migration for
workforce. So we
know we can handle
a company coming
here with
say 50 to
100 jobs
conservatively.
Uh we would be able to
manage that as
far as
um what, what was the second
part of your question? I'm
sorry.
>> Uh So as as
we, if we build these right
and, and we come in and say,
OK, we can do 50 100
jobs. What does that spec
building? I mean, really look like,
I mean, >> it
it depends on the
customer. I mean, what
kind of, what kind of
industry is it? If it's
going to be an energy industry,
are they going to be doing solar
or traditional energy? Do they
have traditional needs?
If it's a creative
industries
company, do they need
farmland? Do they need
equipment? Do it just
really depends on
uh the industry
sector that we're
trying to recruit.
Obviously, we're looking at
transportation, heavily
logistics, coal storage,
warehousing those
kinds of things, but
also manufacturing,
we want to be able to
have some type
of manufacturing
that we can
export out of
new Mexico for those
economic based
jobs.
>> I don't see any other
questions.
I appreciate your time and,
and being here and,
and your information and
so I know how we can
help you moving forward.
Thank you. So,
for members there is a
reception tonight, right?
And it's for Telly's, they're
going to get you the information.
Uh, the place that we thought we
had is closed today,
so we have to change it at
the last minute.
Lunch is gonna be at the teacher
health center up
this way. Correct.
>> I'll be taking
everyone in the room is
in to join for
lunch today. It will be
held in the teacher education
center and I will guide you that
way. There's
two
Pazo figures.
It's the
right
will be served.
>> Ok. And
then we'll come back at
125 right now.
Let's just come back
at
1115.
Give us a good 45
minutes an hour for lunch.
Thanks
>> here.
All right,
you still
there.
One.
I just wanted to.
