Representative says.
Representative in.
Representative Roybal Caballero
Representative of fund deal.
Six it would not work that
needed to be that are those ones
we got here
welcome to have a preventative
military affairs hot see these
years whenever you're ready good
afternoon Mister chairman
members of the committee
I knew house bill two eighty
nine the elevator safety at the
bill has been around for awhile
but I think we have a solid bill
this year have a great amount of
work this bill is all about a
leader safety for constituents
in New Mexico House Bill doing
services L. is in our regular.
More.
All of the the New Mexico will
be registered as will you L. the
RLD will establish stand for
inspections inspector.
A little more mechanical be
certified entertainment
standards and practices are set
in this bill and by the
department of Mr chairman I have
more regular.
With me today my expert witness
was a business manager for the
I. U. the CEO of one thirty one
and it's just got done with
working with the bill.
What is the right now the
gentleman with that we staff for
questions.
Recurring revenue the lead of
the human yes I do.
Excuse me
we are one of twelve states in
the United States that does not
enforce.
Elevator safety.
This presents a real these
situated here we don't know how
many elevators we have in New
Mexico and we also more
importantly I don't know how
many elevators do not get looked
at by a qualified person in the
most catastrophic situation the
elevator will hurt somebody and
maybe rate and it's happened
quite a bit.
Of.
I think this bill you know as
Mexico City said I think this
bill will greatly improve you
know the safety of all our
citizens and the people to come
into.
This and this bill is going to
produce concrete standards for
mechanics premises and contract.
There is already elevator safety
codes written there developed
frequently they change.
Every time the American society
of mechanical engineers the
state needs to change the state
may be improved.
And the this bill will also help
time
the elevator coach to the fire
marshal codes because currently
we have trouble.
The elevator doesn't work
correctly in a fire or when it's
tested we have no way of
A compelling business owners
building.
Six years appropriate.
And I think this bill will will
greatly improve the safety of
elevators and the and the.
and the safety for the people
work later submitted with fixed.
It's still.
I I am very passionate about
this bill my whole entire
working life I work in the job
you know where safety is
paramount and
As I returned the Mexico six
years ago now I I I saw this is
one of the things I'd like to
try and get to.
Thank you it would go to the
audience and see who's here with
legislation.
Anybody anybody in opposition I
used for Mr Chairman.
Committee money if you services
all the I want to thank the
sponsored.
It the industry we've been
working our.
recently we still have things
they agree to that we work for
so at this time.
Decision.
The official.
This is the way the body on the.
Screen there is part.
The associated with their
changed you the.
Okay we know anybody in
opposition right.
Okay members of the committee.
Representative.
You Mr chair representative so
is there federal law requires
no maintenance are expected or.
If we so there's a lot of this
what the federal law that I'm
aware of these for federal bill
share of the.
There's a lot of those.
All of the legislature.
Okay Mr chair.
Mr chairman Representative Mr
Chairman representative yeah.
Of course okay
the current the the only law
that I'm aware of is for.
Federal buildings up of the that
the.
Hospital in Albuquerque every
year brings in a third party
specter.
And Mr chair representative
experts have how often do you
have any idea how often these
elevators inspected only.
I I first let me ask you Mr
chair how many older history
talking about.
Sorry.
Mr chair.
Representative.
the elevators.
Mr Chairman representative the.
Frequency of elevator
inspections are here the four
hydraulic elevators and yearly
and every five years significant
tests done on traction.
Which
Which operating we still.
Mr chair representative of
expertise said something to the
fact that you're trying to put
this in line with this fire
departments.
Requirements Mr chair
representative it will help the
fire.
Enforce the codes that they have
for all the.
Mr chair of thank you.
By that out to me maybe on the
expert over here on our state
will have a lot of questions for
the seller thank you.
That.
Representative is Mr chair
representative.
Although we do have to that on
because I like to build and I
think that they should be taken
care of because so right now
you're saying that the fire
marshal's in the city does not
do for inspections.
Chair representative of the fire
marshal has no way of compelling
the building because the
elevators they still do the
inspections they just have
really know what compelled to.
Correct the discrepancies.
So the thing that I would bring
up Mr chair representative is.
You know there's all kinds of
inspectors.
And if you have a settlement
comes in and gives that
inspection is an appeal process.
Mr chair representative not to
my knowledge on this.
We have the the the reason I say
that we have that happen and
we've had to bring a third party
and the respect we're wrong.
And the shut the elevator down
down and they was they were
compelled to get a third party
and the K. to location and the
hello that was okay.
And the inspector was wrong
I just didn't know if there
would be kind of a process there
two years making sense of the
need to.
If they deem it safe and if
there was a third party who can
come in right away so there is
this Mr chair representative I
think of yeah he has that
process in place so that would
probably follow their guidelines
time Mr Chairman representative
thank you.
Representative.
Questions Mr chair hi there
seems pieces of the bills Mr
Chairman representative that are
in licensing for the federal
right section were.
In other words is this.
To establish the section that
says operate is.
What.
The and then there's always
usually another section where we
go from here it's just standard
legislative language but it's
not in here and it is kind of
important and I think there was
another section sections.
Well there's no reference to
specter but.
The sentences about.
Rules for seventeen the criteria
qualification for inspectors and
for the five and seven I might
have missed it.
But I'm sure that.
It was mentioned in one
analyses.
I think the committee announces.
The if necessary
tools are being important pieces
that need to be added to fill.
Mr chair I agree with the
premise of the bill that this is
a safety issue we have to deal
with the act don't think this
bill is done.
Did that make sense.
Mr chair for that to stop us
Mr chairman and Representative
thank you
scouts can registered lobbyists
for the elevator industry work
preservation fund and
Representative you you're
absolutely correct and when Mr
Bailey was
was testifying there's about
four or five issues that we
still need to complete were
about eighty five percent I
guess of their
there's some consistency issues
I and they
To
to discuss the well a.
I the adoption I need to do to
clean that up
the HSD Dobson rules of to work
on the schedule
fans of we need I think one of
the analysis identified that we
need to provide the funds
and the superintendent
communicate with the little bit
earlier this morning that we
have that so so those would be
four five six amendments that we
would need to
we we need to finish our our
discussions with our but we have
within those we appreciate very
much the profits to attention
that just say.
Chairman she was to what I was
looking earlier earlier versions
of this bill for like thirty
seven thirty eight thirty nine
pages and now we're down to
about what is it seven or eight.
And and we couldn't have done
that the south hello of the
support it's been absolutely
fantastic the superintendent has
been fantastic Mr Bailey.
Thank you Mr.
Mr chair with added maybe on
your list of things that need to
be we're going back to the
previous representatives
comments there might be a
section on an appeal process.
Mr chair representative Mr chair
on the that is part of the U.
L..
Okay thank you.
The.
Thank you Mr chairman there from
my expertise that they're gonna
ask you chairman Terry
somebody's.
The.
The elevator shaft that but I
have good people that fall down
the stairs.
Mr chair.
Committee.
So Mister Representative
Michael.
Quick question is exemptions
personal visions of those in
this.
Because you could have right.
People from all over forever and
I after most people have that.
Mr chair representative
I am aware of four homes north
of Santa Fe that currently have
full size elevators in them so
you right there is
there is home to have a full
size element here of those four
homes they all paid for a
service contract I got a service
Mr chair representative does
that mean they're expected those
are due to get out of of
Stafford special Mr chair
representative in New Mexico we
do not get a chance for a.
A certificate but if you paper
service contract it's the right
service contract you do get the
inspection Mr chair
representative do you so.
Because we offer in that we
actually chair representative of
you guys give a certificate in
the elevator if it's commercial
however to not show like when
you Mr chair representative to
get your fire extinguisher a
service store no one.
For us to the okay Mr chair
representative
No the answer's no we it used to
happen in the City of
Albuquerque but they closed
their expecting program I
believe July thirty first twenty
twenty Mr Miller that that does
bother me I think the you know I
mean if you have your there and
this is maybe chair
representative maybe
I think we're something that I
have seen all of
the minister of the questions
Representative is
Can this be done through city
ordinances or or ordinances or
each individual fire department
is required to do this at the
like the doing of the empire
spectacles to mind my placing
checks me.
Mr chairman Representative the
City of Albuquerque had a at
their own inspection programs.
A few years a number of years
they got rid of it last year and
so at this point this time no
local government has a.
So Mister chair representative I
guess the question I have is
they have the is there ordinance
that requires.
And or is it just a department
that was required by rule.
Mr Chairman Representative my
recollection is that they have
they have the.
Division within the city
department and.
If they created the vision they
must've had a local ordinance so
Mister Johnny the City of
Albuquerque is not in
compliance.
Mr Chairman representative
The city that.
Chooses not to have their own
local but will the chief program
Mr Chairman representative
reason I'm saying that is
consider ordinances are rule
they should be required to.
Our own rules this and I would I
would chair just stretch a
little bit here Mister chair
representative I would imagine
they are quite a few of those
elevators and selves.
It.
Thank you Mr chair
representative.
Those the City of Albuquerque
doesn't chair representative I.
Click on that at all but if I
can.
Step back to the certification
if a business owner or hospital
Seneal or building pays for
third party inspector they do
get.
Please repeat that I'm sorry yes
I chair representative if a.
If a business entity of casino
hospital which frequently
happens here if they choose to
pay for a third party inspector
to come in thank you get our
state Mr Perot's publicized
referring to public home of our
own properties for two.
Mr chair representative I didn't
read a word here in the on the
bill and this just kind of.
With this one escalators
possibly fall under this.
Mr Chairman representative yes
so it may.
Representative within this bill
Mr chair representative
commences our references and
they are not exempt in.
A section on exit and I'm going
to Mr chair representative.
Press also for your
Representative up to us at
concerning inspections in the
and and my friend up
Representative Representative
saying that we do have an
inspection process if there were
how do we ensure the wrong a
quick process because I could
hinder
the ability for the cessation
people that are on.
The needs special that special
needs to get to two or four and
so maybe it's a doctor's office
Mr chairman maybe it saw
something more vital and it shut
it is shutting down so do we
have language that will come so
we can get a second opinion when
they do fill up stations for a
provider.
Mr chair.
Representative all.
Over the years as leaders for
movers.
Any command to most people is
designed and built for the
safety code
that imply.
There is there is a way to up.
Insure that.
All the elevators we currently
have in the state all the people
we have to the state.
Are they are designed inspected
per the codes that they were
built it's good that that's
already in place in New Mexico
Mr chair representative I think
maybe I've been asked by
question.
I think my question was more if
there's a failed inspection on
the elevator I can be in a
public forum.
The commercial building.
Question if they fail them and
the this Michael auspices I I I
I went to the doctor of the
doctor Los crucis Francis Mr
chair representative and those
are all elevators are five six
story buildings and so if
missiles people are made to be
the special system I can go up
the stairs and so if it's shut
down this is that the only
dollar tree.
What do we have to ensure and I
know you for to the U. L. A. but
what do the what does that mean.
For that elevated because as my
to colleagues here expressed
that that could keep it shut
down for their ability to meet
their appointment in this case I
about women and so my wife how
can we read or write in here
that within a short amount of
time someone else's second
respond or for a second dot
right second opinion doesn't
make sure that that hinders that
business for that or that soft.
Mr Chairman representative that
that I encounter that in my
career.
And usually is worked out
between the building and the.
Contractor they have a the
service contract with and it's
using they pay a premium when
you get that elevator up to.
But in the bill there's nothing
Mr chair representative you get
to come in and what if they
disagree with the I think that
I'm sorry I'm not trying to be
you know the inspector comes in
red hat to.
So just you called and what
which is what we did and he says
was gonna pass it to the back
that we have something that can
fix.
My friend preserve part of this
it was referring to and I think
also might by of your
Representative that's that
system.
I kind of was trying to clean up
if that makes you so Mister.
Mr Chairman.
President of the shale can
explain to you all and what it
covers maybe the last two years.
Thank
you thank you Mr Chairman
representative so under the U.
LA there are very strict
limitations on what the
department can do we have to
give notice we have to give an
opportunity to be heard right
now we've got some fuel a
language going through give us
the opportunity to summarily
suspend in this case the.
Person would have an opportunity
to discover if they disagree
with it before its reputation
shut down in less the summarily
suspended out of left language
goes to the Senate and comes
back over here goes through
here.
That language will be important
but will also have a quick due
process tied to it so currently
the processes in the front side
in other law passed it will be
on the backside under extreme
vertices for public health and
safety thank you Mr chair
representative would imagine
that
The representative would take
all.
And all.
In all fairness to to to
keep those take note of that.
And the work on that and just
bring those things up thank you
Mr chair representative.
This is the.
Representative and thanks for.
Thank you a little bit late but
I I did review.
Make notes on thank you to
Representative.
And for experts to staff I so.
But I'm not sure I heard the
question and the answer to that
so that we know if it's a repeat
that.
So my concern is
If.
If there's a problem.
Will give you a scenario of what
happened to me and the.
To see how we can address so
step on the scale of it
In between our.
At the university.
Are you.
It was a ninety.
The wait Mr chair I'm
claustrophobic.
And I was by myself.
And had my screen bankrolling
hard I was fully look at.
And then between and I I would
look at the you know the
information that the person of
interest which has to have
several posi vision emergency
number of the call and then it
tells you who signed off on it
how we got with the mechanical
or whatever support is.
And all that information so by
the time they got to me the
number I called was very kind.
Of it was some kind of number I
know we're led to the chief I
explained to her that was close
focus so she stayed on the line
talking talking me through until
we could get somebody there and
the university responded right
away Mr chair however they were
not the.
They were not the mechanical
phone repair persons they were
just the university I should
just for the university
Building services folks.
And so.
They.
Will be out later the the.
Pry open the doors and then they
got some stuff in there to get
on the elevator.
Only on the list.
Anyway one of the things like to
share of the information given
by the.
And because we find out.
That it is a third party.
Contractor is that services for
the.
And they don't for whatever the
fifth commitment for procurement
processes and so on to get
contracted.
So the the building services
then though indicated that
they've been having distantly
with the celebrated in this
particular building the
humanities building.
And
so.
The question arose well who
signing on for who right the
university contracts but there.
According to Building services
at UNM there wasn't there there
wasn't there wasn't any one
thing attention to the
contractor and what their
obligations for to keep the
service in building services.
Persons estimation was they're
not basically he said this is
happened far too many times
we've called them they're not
they're not doing their job
basically and we are our hands
are tied so my question is.
Does have oversight.
How can we ensure that who we
are licensing or or certifying
I don't know what the languages
to to do the
maintenance and.
With.
How do we.
Hello this is in this case the
university or that there are.
Of formidable
I'm sure if they go through the
process right through the
through the department or
whatever they have to file with
the with this film that they've
checked off right because
they've been given this that
this question still arises who
have.
On.
Mr
Chairman representative.
Representative the state that.
So see I will be regulate.
Waiters.
And inspectors as well so Mister
chair representative so.
Inspectors that are associated
with the certification process
C. eighty taxes under is this
bill gets passed the.
Yes ma'am thank you Mr chairman
thank you for.
Thank
you know I want to share this.
They understand that but those
bills.
This gives added Mr chairman.
Yes.
I.
Mr chair Madam.
Representative your situation
your condition.
Most of the population in the
United States is claustrophobic.
The fact that we do not
implement.
Elevator safety code we can see
elevator mechanic in compelling
the building to fix those
elevators property.
That would and then it goes
between.
The building which in this case
to the U. N. M..
And it would be called may
elevator that to services the
elevators at UNM and.
The mechanics that work for
County I represent.
And we frequently have these
conversations how.
I do is to compel the field if
you know the building owner our
customers we care about.
We're frequently talking about
ways to.
Compel them to do things and
bring up these elevators to cope
and it but your situation it
happens a lot it is scary for
people.
For me I'm not claustrophobic so
I'm stuck in the elevator
hundred times.
Using this taken.
Mr Mr Chairman representative.
I was literally climbing the Mr
chairman members I thank you for
your among the millions and
millions of people it's not
uncommon and and it is right.
Thank you Mr chair the groups in
question I have Representative
there were no but rather than
the thing that was on my.
In my it is why.
The correct everything that was
addressed here before we brought
the bill forward.
The committee set up in Texas
before we end up spending this
time on
are you honestly I think the
the.
I think there is committee to
send the bill is not ready to go
forward.
The committee.
Mr Mr chairman
that is a outstanding point
we had some.
illnesses between the some of
the folks that we're talking and
and that messed up the
communication but you Mr.
I feel comfortable sending this
to Congress.
The problems in the bill.
I don't know how to dress I I
never have really spending bill
forward.
That is a would be
questions brought up in the
analysis that are not into.
Representative.
You can.
You're not you'll.
So.
A lot of the codes that they're
going to have you really can't
spell out and put it in the bill
they're all the codes are going
to be spelled out either in your
international fire code or
whatever so that the costs that
the city is going to end up so
they're gonna have their own
standards and I think this bill
would just almost look like that
H. B. to bill that we had this
morning if you put everything
down in there because it would
be very matter of fact.
If that helps.
The the question is.
There's gotta be some kind of
funding in order to do this.
Where are we are we going to
pay.
For the person that.
Mr chairman.
on.
You.
the the enactment date is on the
very last stages of life for
twenty twenty five.
So
The whole
plan was if we could
have built we come back in the
next thirty day session that
would give the department time
to to.
To do the calculations on what a
budget you should look like
would look like and then we come
back in thirty day session for
the fund.
so basically you're telling me
that I will be passing bills.
This is really questions and
pick it up for questions Senate
they would get sent to the
governor.
Mr chairman if there's a lot of
issues and we can maybe take
this bill that and maybe resolve
the issue of questions that you
all have and hopefully get it in
before I hope you don't know to
what Representative is that I
gave.
Okay with the like to go over.
The TV guide.
Come up with.
There's something that we can
send forward thank you really
both of the books in the.
So where did not eight.
Chairman or well taken
you know.
Before we go on I want to really
thank
director Bailey and
superintendent Trujillo they
really worked hard as well as
with these guys on this bill and
if we need to go back and fix it
every year rollover Mr chairman
we will do that for you
the things there's.
Yes hello provided the committee
you can and see if we can get
this done get all those
questions answered.
And
look for the other.
But the Mr chairman for well
taken.
The.
I don't want to table.
Those in the forward with the
the and we thank you for that.
Thank you for questions and will
work with the.
Thank you thank.
Okay.
One of them just to the right.
As I have all.
If we were going to roll.
I
be eligible for these.
In the morning.
Did you respond.
Thank you for.
So you ready Mr chair are we
really the.
Representative Dalton how do
this year's okay thank you.
So I am here with health bill
two fifty seven it was brought
to me by firefighters and and
basically what they said to me
is if you don't have PTSD the
first year teacher to the fact
that so this is a bill to set up
I'm sorry we were going to have
an amendment do you have that
amendment.
The state.
The expected real first.
Okay thank you so essentially
what this is is to allow
Fire from fire departments to
set up your support group so
that they can be they can
support their peers through
these but must be awful awful
occurrences and then there's two
hundred fifty thousand from the
general fund and to the state
fire marshal's office to enact
the firefighter and emergency
service provider peer support
act and if they will have the
fire can
we set up a curriculum to train
the the folks who are going to
be.
The amendment is.
Thank you Mr Mr chair we just
all we did was at volunteer so
if someone brought to our
attention that that we have left
off volunteer firefighters and
that was our intention so it's a
simple a simple amendment that
just ask I volunteer fire
departments as well.
Reduced by.
Department here.
I have a.
In this.
He said the.
The second.
Is that.
Amendment.
Okay your bill's spending.
That is that everything in order
to extend the questions yes.
To do that the the the the
service sure
Representative thank you for
having me have me my name is we
ought to Representative I
personality and County
brothers bill to reinforce the
importance they are often far
service.
Very important to us is one way
that we can address and it's
approved and approved support
system we have a fairly formal
worked out pretty there's a very
good one and really County as
well as a brother Santa fe's and
behind the but really this bill
is to support all of the
fire fires and also for the
state and everything we because
lots of of including volunteers
thank you for for Representative
agency for bringing that to our
to our attention
really what this does is is
allows not only the support of
these teams but allows them to
have legislation that that kind
of leads to their
confidentiality and their
ability to to be to work with
other firefighters and not be
compelled to
to testify in certain certain
situations so really this page
allows them to be entrusted
which is the most important part
of having a person fourteen in
in the fire service and on top
that procreation is portion
would allow us to say farmers
who was on board with this to to
create the curriculum how the
curriculum at the state fire
academy or to outsource it to
satellites if need be so that we
can expect as many many
firefighters have this very
important
modality along with the number
one to the other stuff that we
use
At their disposal question is
the most important part.
So there's about twenty one
hundred paid fire fighters in
the state many more thousands of
volunteer firefighters in the
state of my particular local
representative about nine.
Firefighters so we would be very
closely in tune with this with
this bill and with the
curriculum and with the training
and with the the fight fires at
the need to support and like the
representative Representative
said before in the fire service
you have a twenty twenty five
year career now you are exposed
to trauma saturation
But we on the other
profession.
Amongst all the other regular
life instances you sprinkle that
strong that the trauma in there
and it's a recipe for disaster
so this is just one more thing
that we can we can create to
support those firefighters say
what thank you for your time.
The ideas unibody here is for
this legislation.
There is nobody here in
opposition.
Is it anybody who wants to speak
in support of the legislation.
Though it good Mr chair the
Representative those are are for
this for more support.
Religion Mr chair members of the
committee my name is in Lopez
and president of Santa Fe
firefighters association I
represent a hundred sixty
firefighters in Santa Fe
properties tools.

State University I would also
like to thank the sponsor

building is.
Of it's going to the fire
marshal's office.
And then it's going to I.
And if you've ever been in front
of the critical incident stress
debriefing team and you have a
bunch of strangers come in.
If it's not is it is it just
don't feel as rye as maybe
somebody enough.
And with you guys.
Teaching you know other
firefighters in the in the
business.
It is it's a small business so
we all kind of know each other I
would rather you know not only
known you now for thirty days
but now that I know you if I was
having a problem I would feel
good about to come talk to me
but somebody that I don't know
telling them what's wrong with
me it doesn't hit the same so I
love this bill and is.
Have you had any any.
Chair representative have you
had anybody that wants to take
the course.
Once you get the curriculum
built Mr participation of Mr
chair representative thank you
for the question is a good one
yes people are interested in
support people firefighters have
a tendency to want to help
that's kind of in our nature
right so to help your own there
is a there's people that are
really really interested we've
been able to capitalize the in
my apartment fire rescue we have
a team it's almost forty five
people Santa Fe has a team is
about twelve fifteen people the
really the ratio you still have
to offer support for every
hundred firefighters so yes
there are people asking to get
trained training is there we
have there's a there's a company
called PS PC now occur to that
that does appears training
there's different get them
coordinating with the state fire
marshal there's of the I FF has
a peer support curriculum these
the the the fallen firefighters
foundation the enjoyable F. as a
support curriculum so it's it's
once we get the curriculum there
will be people that want to
training we have allocated
resources to do that as is going
to be a well attended venture
thank you Mr chair and
representative.
How long does it take to put
together thank you Mr chair
representative the curriculum is
already there so long it's not
gonna take long the ordination
between this the state fire
marshal says are on board and so
the powers that be that already
have a curriculum it's it's
already there we just have to
get the teachers and the
location and the logistics of
once we have the money
then we can do it thank you Mr
chair representative I hope that
you're.
Rating low stretches out
throughout the whole state and
you can strategically set peer
groups of around the whole state
where the money's coming cover
it is very the case Mr chair and
representative so that's not
finalize and one of the
conversations to have a state
care support team there is a our
our local our our department has
a peer support team from casters
fourteen and then amongst the
metro Department as a medical
care support team as of right
now there's not state fourteen
so yeah one of the ideas is once
we have this up and running we
have support teams at all there
is the of the state if there is
a a mass shooting event or an
active shooter van or a a
tragedy that we can deploy these
resources whether they could
also stress reading with repairs
quality chaplaincy to all part
of the state.
And Mr chair representative.
You know a lot of the colleges
now or do we.
Associates degree in fire
fighting and I would love to see
that put into that curriculum to
wear when all these new folks
are coming in our fire training
that they at least get just a
little bit of peer support to
where they understand and and
that might even help you you
know gets more people to thank
you that's all I have Mister
don't.
Mr chair and would you pass.
Representative.
Was there.
Thank you.
And thank.
I have a question.
And the.
One through four.
So.
But in my.
But so.
When we we're looking at some of
the construction Representative
substance abuse substance use
and abuse and then all of the
ones that are listed in critical
incident stress so when you
mentioned that there was already
curriculum.
I'm assuming that when we talk
about here support we're talking
about just a very basic level.
Of.
Just offering each other
comfort.
knowing how to say the right
things
knowing.
Where to direct your fear and
distress where they can go that
that basic level of your
addressing in this section is
that correct Mr chair.
Mr Chairman representative but
coming into so essentially I
learned this this year I'm
sharing my new wisdom that when
it says include because I've
asked them to do including but
not limited to in the council
services no no no so include is
just if this is necessary all of
it this is just part of it is
something else that that can
fall under that there they are
able to at it yet.
So Mister chair representative
thank you I I yes I understood
that I put my question is more
in line with all of these from
one some of the numbers one two
seven.
Ready
Pretty intense experiences and
situations that I would say
probably that lead to what
someone that.
A new.
Presentation yes.
to automatic stress so.
Some point.
Referrals will have to be made.
So my question is will the
appears to be trying just a very
basic level.
Of curriculum to know how to
like to your first point of
contact will be appear rather
than.
Right to your employers
employees.
Correct that this is just to
give.
The training requirement
guidance on what how the
healthier here in the event they
experience any of these.
And more whatever happens to the
Mr Chairman representative.
The chairman vice chair and
representative it's a great
question I think to start off
with the the fire departments
that don't have any training yes
that would be the directions
there's a basic pair support
class which is a five day class
but I don't think we need to
limit to that because for
instance in Albuquerque we've
been we've been doing this for
quite a long time to the point
where we have a clinical network
we have clinicians fifteen that
we refer to our support team
refers to and we've taken basic
classes and taking advanced
classes and we also take a
critical incident stress review
classes and also taken some of
us have taken chaplaincy classes
so I think the idea is that we
have a robust program statewide
but to start with it would be a
bit basic care support class for
those that have zero training is
a fantastic question not
question Mr chair and
representative it does because
basic as well I'm associating
with that first contact here
that would then lead the
shoulder but also keep.
I.
The importance of that obviously
for a full high next and final
question is here is here you
contracts do not call for on
this.
a contract negotiator so that
would be something that I would
have included in my contact.
Absolutely four.
The training plus the advanced I
mean the basic for finance and
all that would be provided
through.
With the are in the contract.
So I notice if you said that we
have.
Number of twenty two thousand
one hundred firefighters.
And I'm assuming they're covered
in the contract based on.
Mr chairman vice chair
Representative that's to answer
your question we do not have the
code the cost of training peer
support teams in our contract
what we have been able to do and
I'm very proud of this and
Albuquerque which is more unique
that we've done this since two
thousand four we negotiated with
the city and county to allocate
allocate money for
for for us to to clinicians to
cope to cover copays to bring
down stigma of going to seek
help so over the over the past
twenty years we've been able to
build that program to
negotiating with the city and
continue to allocate more funds
but I'm pretty sure the only
local that has that in our
contract in terms of training
for peer support I don't believe
and the locals have that in the
contract so this is all usually
paid for by the city or the
county and to be honest
Representative
behavior health is usually put
in fact ordered priority when
working when we're budgeting.
so thank you for that Mr chair
and representative and
Thanks for so that's really
important point and I think that
the fight fires firefighters do
is our.
Yes Representative come they
really do so if we could use the
budget model.
And that the state that.
It shouldn't be brushed off.
To the state with employer which
will member is should be
entering into that automatically
I would imagine
in the contract so I would look
at that down the road you know
there's other locals other areas
represented here today.
But I think that it's an
important point to put in there
and I'm not saying that we
shouldn't the state intended to
to what is being proposed.
But I also think that it's a
responsibility in the context of
push for as much.
Or.
For behavioral health mental
health should be pushed support
for.
because we already have known
that.
The frontline workers.
The most important.
Whether.
I just it was all it was curious
about.
Chair representative.
Of.
What.
Without the proper second go
ahead with the offices into that
mode.
Show all members present voting.
Maybe that's the flip phone.
If
you want us.
The shares for the care of thank
you all.
It is hard for.
Whenever you're ready the hot
seat is here.
Mr chairman I think our our
servers yes funded he was.
That we.
Offs.
Representative Harper how to use
your love it use it.
Incidents.
Thank you chairman and committee
members it's a privilege to be
here.
Representative tells will to
seventy seven.
For you today this bill two
things.
And the those of you who were
here last year recall that we
pass.
A.
Increasing the survivor benefits
for peace police officers their
families if their kids want to
do.
We it was two hundred fifty
thousand dollars about twelve
million dollars.
We should included fire match.
We did not so the first thing
this bill does is it right to
fire those their families of
firefighters.
Providers we want duty.
The same benefit as are other
first responders the second
thing is last year we passed a
bill I don't think any of us
could have imagined that we
would have that tragic
helicopter crash and sadly that
happened before the effective
date that bill went into place
and so our families benefit from
the actually took last year and
so the second thing this bill
does is it makes it for police
and fire everyone who
discovered the current statutes.
It goes back to January first of
twenty twenty.
Good and so
I think that'll through remote
coastal through to add anything
I was and you know.
Mr chair.
Members of the committee.
We saw the other day whenever
they honor Montoya came.
And whatever said on the
audience and I see a young life
and I see a young child.
And their whole courses been the
trajectory of their whole
courses.
They're they're lost.
Because.
Husbands not coming home the
dads not coming home and.
I can't imagine you know having
to put my family in that
position.
And just knowing that there's
that there's people like us
that are passing legislation to
we're gonna take care of those
families.
Makes me.
I'm super proud to be on this
bill so that's all I have Mister
chair.
Representative I think the last
thing this mention
what we are supposed to know if
you're.
Why a my son when my son's.
Is a yes friends with Daniel.
And has for years there's
actually twenty.
and
His father was on that
helicopter.
And so we see more practice.
I think it just it just makes
sense that
we make sure that everyone
When they made the apple to
sacrifice for the state that
that we make sure that we thank
them this way so that chamber
staff questions.
Early this body here is for this
legislation.
Anybody in opposition.
In support of the legislation go
ahead Sir.
To share.
Representative the local
Senator.
was part of I want to thank the
sponsor Representative Harper
Representative this is for
bringing this to
To to legislation it's it's
super important not mostly for
the widow of our team.
Thanks thank you to that the
pharmaceutical center to check
part of that is it just the
other day she was very
appreciative but I know this use
of fully aware of the unfairness
of life be worth two hundred
fifty thousand dollars when law
enforcement officers life
workforce million released on
paper and legislation form
so.
Personally this this is the
state's economy says this is one
of our members I know the family
very well I've talked about with
low monthly hi Sir.
The all of the Legislative will
will will hear our voices in
this hall on the floor
and you for your support for
this legislation thank you.
The
next what else this is a way
that Mr chair representative the
staff on the.
Prototype fire rescue and I have
the a very fun experience of
patented
this late today like never.
All
we
support this really important
legislation to make sure that we
recognize that.
And all the families of
firefighters in the state at
least the same level that that
we recognize their law
enforcement brothers and sisters
thank you anybody else.
Federal twenty fifty nine
agent in a representative of
hundred sixty men and women in
cities and.
Thank the sponsors for this that
we are most definitely.
The.
That we would have.
But in favor of that is about
three.
The.
The committee.
Representative are a I'm on
technical today Mr chair there's
no piece of legislation statute
that you need to change in order
to happen was identified in the
FIR folded up online thank.
It is section fifty eight dash
fifty three dash seven.
And we've got to fix that to
make sure the money is in the
fund in order to this fusion it
added in the.
So the gentleman thank you for
that I did see that and I'm
happy to do that I.
What was just a committee
understand focuses that relief
statute.
Both will.
W. thousand dollars this
provision to make it
Operation to.
so yeah that should definitely
fix what right now on house bill
two of all four and set off for
there is an appropriation for
four million dollars built into
that.
Into that right now and actually
work with.
The governor staff to make sure
that that was in there and so
that even if we didn't make that
change would still be still be
okay.
Mr chair and representative I
don't doubt the money's there
but if we don't make that
changes literally says the child
is to be.
So that the balance is two
hundred fifty thousand we needed
to be considered a more than
that so don't forget to add that
amendment is on their own this.
Mr chair representative thank
you for this legislation thank I
know first hand what with that
is director I know first hand
and I've seen it many many times
what is not expected to.
You say goodbye here well one

Horrible news whether it's on

the so we are.
And so I appreciate you doing
this I wish we could do this
will help people and I'm so glad
that we're able to at least look
at them into the pool so I'm in
full support of this legislation
thank you thank you Mr.
Thank.
I.
Hello
Mr chair this is a question of.
Because I've been from Clovis
and I'm just looking at that
since that would this cover in
cover police officers to.
Yeah so so chair representative
right question so if you look at
the the bill.
Our.
page three sections correspond
Greece office using online
fifteen.
One million dollar budget that
was passed.
Winds alleged twelve
the how it affects police
officers is now practiced you
are at this.
I'm more curious because
there's.
There is a W. from Clovis that
he died COVID was on the job and
and I knew he could get paid out
because of that with this impact
this case or is this more of
some something that's going to.
Be in the yes.
Orders to hard Representative
yes so so the chairman
Representative I I'm not sure of
the exact dates in the details
of how it's actually.
Process to what we have here is
that the statue that corresponds
to the benefit that's what I
want to change so I don't have a
good Mr chair representative of
this is going to be up to them
to decide if that's that does
cover police officers yes.
But I just needed to Mr chair
clarification.
I had already made no phone in
my review.
What Representative all of those
different I just wanna make sure
because it says that the
technical issues.
That is an increase.
H. we will not increase the
minimum balance of the five.
Survivors fund or the bottom of
the page to.
So.
But we're not we're not going to
have the balance less than two
thousand because Mr chair as you
mentioned Representative Harper.
You make sure that in the funds
come there he met with the
governor and the funding is
coming.
So the chairman and vice chair
yes thank you for that if you
look.
FY are under significant issues
if you look one paragraph above.
It mentions that the house
appropriations and finance to
substitute also students two or
three foods four million dollars
appropriation.
To respond respond and four
million dollar corporation
firefighters.
so I so eight million dollars
total and those funds or you
have balance.
So there is going to be a lot of
money you put in there this
technical issue.
Really it's like a safety valve
right if if we did more.
Go below two fifty thousand
dollars to be an automatic
appropriation the Senate which
is.
Well now you're raising a twelve
million probably have that
safety valve threshold and.
And so yes I think this issue
that we can
but is to if this is the
document that.
Thank.
That was my Mr chair is that I
don't I don't think it needs to
know was that.
You have to be.
For what anyway
because you already are.
And and also referring to the
treasure that is responsible for
making those transfers at this
point once the treasury has
those funds rate and the
recurring because that's what
there's going to have that
happen right Mr chair will they
be recurring to the fund or is
it just feels that the fund will
grow.
It's for this.
Yes Representative so so
chairman and vice chair of yours
are spot on page actually right
these are one time distributions
for our food flows to those.
I don't know the details of
mandatory.
Representative I just want to
make clear so you wouldn't have
to go and jump through hoops to
do.
Because
that's not something.
With all of the
bill in my opinion and you know
if this is a life is out.
Out of.
Is that those plans so thank you
very much.
Mr chair I just.
Motion produce okay also
chairman whose second.
So I have a small question.
Representative Harper.
And.
That that sponsorship of
fighters.
We go to the
two for nine ninety.
they're
I.
Firefighters.
You're you're you're right that
that at the thousand children
put the bills you are improving
hi or.
Order yes.
As a that's a great question
that's a existing language for
this.
Not changing up the title you're
correct dosing increasing the
tax benefits for spreading
spouse or children firefighters.
And when you look at that
firefighters section it says.
It's a sliding children first of
tirelessly to the spouse and
section six or section see I'm
sorry what.
There's also a spouse benefits
are distributed he could have
just surviving children and if
there are starving children it
would go to the parents so
you're right there total
production and for parents and.
Okay.
Questions.
Thank you care.
So the question is what do we
have children are spaz or
Or paired.
It nobody gets paid on.
Sisters or anything like.
That that's a that's the
existing laws for correction.
Those were the.
I think that some of the
internet state include that it
had surviving very.
So I think that this is going to
fly home your way to the
government
Committee amendment.
Is that I think we should be
okay I have a proper motion
Representative.
So I had in the offices that.
All members present voting in
the for.
Madam we're going to be.
One of the.
The date.
