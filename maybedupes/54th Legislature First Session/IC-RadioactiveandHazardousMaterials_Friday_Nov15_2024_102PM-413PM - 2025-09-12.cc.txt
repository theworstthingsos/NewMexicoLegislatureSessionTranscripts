Heal. Trujillo.
Aliha, I'm sorry, I knew I was
saying that incorrectly.
And you're the program manager
for radioactive waste
consultation task force and
bureau chief of hazardous waste
Bureau.
Uh, energy, minerals and natural
resources department.
Emer
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee.
I am here once again on behalf
of the radioactive waste
consultation task force.
I have a very quick presentation
for you today, which I'm sure
you love because you're busy.
So the very first thing on my
presentation.
I
quick discussion about
Department of Energy's legacy
true waste disposal plan.
That was submitted to enemy D.
In November, I believe November
4th or November 3rd.
And
There's a 60 day comment period
within that plan or that um.
True waste plan is the
definition of legacy true waste
and my recommendation to the
committee.
Is that you take time to review
it because some of the
definitions that are included in
this plan.
Come from every site.
That has radioactive waste, so
it's not specific just to the
Manhattan Project, for example,
surplus plutonium is included in
the definition of legacy true
waste.
And
From my perspective.
Surplus plutonium is not legacy
true waste and the true
definition of what legacy is the
very basic definition of legacy
waste.
So my recommendation is that um
the committee take time to
review that plan and submit
comments to the Department of
Energy.
Um, the comment period ends on
January 3rd of 2025.
And there's an email address
there and a website that you can
submit.
Your comments on that plan.
I will be submitting comments on
behalf of the radioactive waste
consultation task force, and
then, uh, the Western Interstate
Energy Board, high-level
radioactive waste Committee and
the technical advisory group
will also be submitting
comments.
On behalf of the Western
Regional group.
And those that includes the 11
states within that regional
group.
My next slide is shipments that
have.
Been received at the website
from January 1 to November 6th.
Los Alamos is at 40 shipments.
So one of the, the concerns for
this committee and for our
program is.
The lannel cleanup.
Do we slowly moving to get waste
off the hill.
Um, we're, I believe we're on 2
shipments.
Up to 2 shipments a week, but
for sure we're doing a shipment
week. um, so we are moving, we
are getting Dewey to move the
waste, but probably not at the
speed that we would prefer, and
I think part of it again is just
because of the type of waste
that they're moving. I don't
know how to correct that
process, but I'm sure Lane does
and Department of Energy does,
and they probably have.
A better idea than any of us in
the room, um, because the
sciencey stuff behind it, but.
Nevertheless, we have 407
shipments total received at whip
from January 1 to November 6.
And we did have a site to site
shipment from Sandia.
National labs to Los Alamos that
we participated in the
Shipment inspection.
And that waste will eventually
make it to the website.
Some other items of interest, my
last slide besides questions.
I
Is as you're aware,
The Roswell area was impacted by
flooding a few weeks back.
We paused shipments.
Um, uh, my office asked.
Do you eat pa shipments until
New Mexico DOT could do a full
assessment on the 285, they shut
down 285 and we did a detour on
New Mexico too. We moved two
shipments during that week
because they were already loaded
from IN Allen on the road.
And if we would have sent them
back, they would have needed to
be vented. It was easier to put
them on NM2 on the detour route
and get them to the site.
And dealt with and then we shut
shipments down again. We pause
shipments down again until.
And MDOT was able to open up
Highway 285 on a two lane. So
we've restored shipments, trucks
are moving again. Lano, um, is
shipping. We had a shipment this
week.
And the shipment last week, so
we've got two lane highway on
285 South and
Working with the Raton port of
entry manager.
Um, Mr. Salazar to.
Manage the many shipments that
were backlogged from INL on the
pause of shipment. So we've got
that moving again and we're back
to normal, 10 shipments a week
so far.
So working with the team to get.
Um, shipments flowing.
And working around the events
that take place. And that's my
presentation.
Quick, fast.
Questions?
Uh, Senator Steinborn.
Thank you, madam chair, Lia,
good afternoon. Good to see you
as always. Thank you all your
good work.
Couple questions. um.
Number one about the true way,
who is who is submitting this
new
True waste
Disposal plan
Do we with, uh, Madam Chair,
Vice Chair.
It's part of the requirement of
the new permit. Do we have to
define legacy waste, so DOE whip
submitted the plan.
to enemy D. It was a requirement
of their permit. OK.
And
Madam Chair, the uh
So this new
Um, definition, does it include
different kinds of waste that
they're calling true and that's
why you're concerned or that
it's just coming from so many
more places, Madam Chair,
Senator, the concern is each
site, so Hanford has its
definition of lazy waist, INL
has its definitionvanna River,
Oak Ridge, Argonne, all of the
facilities and DOEs.
Uh, portfolio have a definition
of true waste. And so,
Of legacy waste, what they
define as legacy waste for us in
the West, our definition of
legacy waste is
Any type of transuranic waste
that was produced.
During the development of the
Manhattan Project.
So during the the making of
The atomic bomb. That's our
definition of legacy to waste.
The comment that I've made to
DOE in meetings back was that
They had to be careful about how
they define legacy ways and the
time frame that they define
legacy waste in what they define
or determine as a legacy.
Because
It could include the Cold War
era, so any
Nuclear weapons that may have
been produced during the Cold
War era could be defined as a
legacy waste or
They could look at the Manhattan
Project specifically and what
was produced during that period
and define that as legacy waste.
In my opinion.
That is what legacy waste is.
I'm not the expert, but when I
think of legacy to me, it's the
Things that were left to us from
our ancestors. And so again,
being very careful of how we
define ancestors and time period
that we're using.
We're at some point going to be
somebody's ancestors. So what
we're doing today.
100 years from now could be
defined as legacy, right? So
very specific to transuranic
waste and how we define that.
The focus should be on what is
existing today and, and do we,
do we determine
Is there a
era a period, a time period, is
it 1940s to the 1950s. Is that
the definition that we're
looking for anything within that
period? Are we including the
entire Cold War era? Are we
including what's being produced
today as legacy waste. So those
are some of the things that.
We need to look at, and when you
look at the definition, surplus
plutonium is included in that.
Some of that surplus plutonium
could very well have been
produced during the Manhattan
Project, but there's no way to
determine specifically what part
of that waste was produced in
the Manhattan Project or,
sorry, um, so, but tell me if
I'm wrong, but where?
Takes more than
This legacy waste, don't they?
They take anything that's
determined defense related
transuranic waste. Right, so why
the hang up on.
What's legacy and what's not
since kind of it's really about
waste classification that we're
accepting there, right? Because
it's specific to panel 12. So
panel 12 in the permit is
designated specifically for
legacy waste is one of the
panels at and maybe future.
Panels at the whip. So what is,
what is the position of the
radioactive consultation task
force on this.
Federal proposal to New Mexico.
So we've not had an opportunity
to look at it because it was, it
came out after the task force
meeting in October. So it was
submitted in.
On November 3rd or November 4th
to the NMED.
So the task force itself has not
had an opportunity to review.
The plant itself, but from my
perspective,
We have legacy transuranic waste
at various sites, specific to
the Manhattan Project is.
Is my definition of legacy
waste.
Elitha Trujillo's.
New Mexico, New Mexico. I get
it.
All right.
OK, so.
That's helpful. So do you think,
do you anticipate
Different state departments NED
M nerd, maybe the task force
independently, giving feedback
or will you do it on behalf of
all of them?
Station task force Madam Chair,
Senator, the intent is, I
believe NMED will probably
provide comments as well. Mner
will provide comments and then
I'll provide comments on behalf
of the task force.
And then again, the weave, the
Western Interstate Energy Board,
high-level radioactive waste
Committee.
And the technical advisory group
tag will also provide comments
on behalf of the Western states
and what we determine or what we
Believe the definition of legacy
true wastage. Mhm.
This enemy, madam chair, Alicia
does enemyD get veto power over
this in their permit or is just
they get consulted on it and
they get a kind of
Negotiate a little bit.
Madam Chair, Senator, our hope
is that with the comments that
are provided to the DOE.
That they take in good faith,
um.
action in response to the
comments that are received and
that the final definition of
legacy waste incorporates the
some substance of the comments
that are provided to them and
not just
What the federal government
determines based on their
opinion, what legacy waste is.
Thank you. And Madam Chair, just
one more question for you,
Alita, um.
So the new radioactive
consultation task force. So
committee members you know are
you refresher in the bill that
banned the storage of high level
nuclear waste in New Mexico, the
whole tech bill.
It, uh
Although it could be any
company.
Um
We, uh, strengthen this
consultation task force that's
made up of state agencies
requiring them to have to report
to us annually, also adding.
Different state players that
were in existence like the
Homeland Security Department.
I guess my question, do you Alia
since.
How's it working now, the new
Mandate of the task force, are
you meeting regularly?
I think it's working.
Madam Chair, Senator, we, um,
the task force has met once this
year.
The challenge is
Everybody's schedule, so trying
to get
All of the cabinet secretaries
or their designee into a space
where we can where they can meet
and have that collaborative
discussion. It's still a
challenge just because of their
schedules, but.
We've, I have good communication
with all of them. Um, I, I
communicate with their designees
specifically and then they take
that up to the secretaries or
they have the authority on
behalf of the secretary to
Make decisions as as necessary.
The challenges for me in where
I'm communicating with them and
not in a quorum fashion.
Which would be a violation of
the Open Meetings Act, so it's
multiple emails or conversations
individual conversations so that
I'm not having one large
conversation with
With, with the task force and no
and and a violation of the Open
Meetings Act. I remember before
we passed the law doing this
kind of in the spirit of it.
Under the former secretary, you
probably arranged the meeting.
There were some meetings, the
public was invited. You invited
the chair and vice chair. It was
really kind of a cool new
stepped up transparent way as a
state government of talking
about some of these issues. So I
want to encourage that. I mean,
and not to create more work for
the sake of creating work, but I
think, you know, just to go
through the exercise of
Talking about these issues that
are important to this day.
An opportunity for the public.
Some of maybe the legislators,
so.
Once a year sounds pretty
scarce, you know, honestly, but
if that's all you needed, that's
all you needed cause issues kind
of come up.
So anyway, I'll just throw that
out there. I think it's really
important and
Valuable, but
Not if it's just make work, but.
Medicare Center we do open, we
do a public notification we
invite the public. We have a
public comment period. Um, we've
had representation from the
public in our last meeting, um,
and so as we move forward, the
intent is to at least to get at
least 2 meetings down a year,
the challenge in this instance
with this.
Legacy true waste definition is,
it happens at a time when we've
already had our meeting, so
having to call a second meeting
or do the individual
communication.
is
It seems to work out easier for
me with the secretaries and then
process the comments and
disseminate them and then wait
for feedback.
Sure, fair enough. It's busy,
but I appreciate it. You got it
good work.
Senator Pinto
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for the presentation.
The federal level.
The defining legacy was, do they
have any dates on it or they
say.
to
Madam Chair, Senator Pinto,
they.
Didn't place any dates in the
definition itself, they pretty
much just looked at all of the
sites across the DOE complex and
incorporated all of the
definitions of what legacy waste
is and each one of those sites
into a big definition. So if you
see when you look within the
planet itself, and you see what
the definition is, it includes
things like transuranic waste
is, you know, and it'll give the
definition greater than classy,
blah blah blah.
Or whatever, and then it says
and surplus plutonium. And so
the challenge for me is how much
of that surplus plutonium was
actually Manhattan Project era.
Waste
Where did it come from?
And
Doesn't truly fit the definition
of legacy true waste.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee because when I was in.
Now the periodic table, the
additions to it.
And even as we move forward.
Yeah I can see this.
Being a problem.
We don't know.
to come up.
Um
that
It probably does need to be.
That
Having that oversight
Shing up to know they're saying,
well, this is the best thing now
where we're putting it down at
whip and doing that, but I don't
think it's gonna really fit for
any kind of future.
Whatever they develop whatever
is possible.
Evers manmade next.
Um
Right
On the basis or just the basic
foundation.
Cause I think a lot of what we
have is tied to federal
definition, but if they're not
going to define it.
Nice and
I'll be categorized.
Dates.
Or anything
Madam Chair.
Senator, I think one of the, the
bigger concerns for New Mexico
in this definition in this draft
definition that they have is
that it doesn't help clean up
lossallamos, and it doesn't make
room specifically for lateral
waste. If we incorporate all of
the definitions from all of the
sites and it includes all of
their definition of what their
legacy waste is.
Then
It leaves room at whip and
specifically in panel 12 for
waste to come from everywhere
around the nation that from Lano
or or from INL from Savannah
River, Oak Ridge, Argon versus
Specifically,
Just legacy waste, and there is
legacy waste from the Manhattan
Project at Hanford, there's
waste to Oak Ridge, there's
waste to INL.
The issue is,
Are we going to also include
surplus plutonium as as legacy
waste and take up the space in
panel 12, that should be
specifically for.
What is truly Manhattan Project
Aero Waste lannel, Idaho.
Oak Ridge, those facilities, and
not
Tie it up with surplus
plutonium, which is a lot more
waste than
What
Panel 12 can hold.
And so one of the other issues
that DOE is required, one of the
other requirements of DOE is
they have to report to the NMED
every year on their process,
their their current, um,
process or position and where
they are in defining a site
outside of New Mexico comparable
to WIP.
So WIP2 outside of New Mexico,
that requirement is coming up as
well. It's part of their permit,
so they have to find a site
outside of web so that when
we're done with WIP New Mexico,
they can take whatever legacy
was they want or however they do
find legacy true ways to some
other facility outside of New
Mexico.
I just add a little color.
There's a lot of pressure.
Within the state to get rid of
the waste on the hill from Los
Alamos. That's what this is
about. There's only so much
space if they change this
definition, then you're going to
have waste coming in from all
over, and it's not going to move
the waste in New Mexico to the
site any quicker, and there's a
lot of frustrations over the
years that they have not moved
that way quick enough. That's
what.
This is about, but NMED just
approved a new permit, operating
permit for WIP if I'm using the
right term.
Um
That's the right way to put it.
Lia
Um
And it's really great. Our
environment department did some
incredible work because among
other things, I think they said
that in the feds have to give a
plan on what they're doing to
find a new waste repository.
Is that
The case, and right now, even
though this site was only
supposed to be permitted for a
certain length of time, was
never viewed as, OK, this is
going to be the end all be all
of our nation's throughway
solutions because it just
doesn't.
That they were never looking
actively working on another
site, and now we are saying as a
state where, which is something
done to your credit, you were
always advocating for us to
So 2, and then the state did it,
um, he said, OK, no, you, you,
we want you to start doing this
work, so it's good. I think a
lot of what Eli is talking about
or
These variables that are coming
into play and
You know, it's an interesting
thing, the federal government
will get away with what it can.
I think that's the moral of the
story, and it's just incumbent
on, you know, Lisa and us and
advocates to just keep the
federal government doing the
right thing and I don't know
it's anything we can mandate
through a bill.
But you'll let us know if it
can, right? I mean we can't
compel the federal government to
do anything, but I guess we can.
Set terms on what we're willing
to accept for ourselves.
Anyway, I just wanted to share
that.
It can be years to accumulate
that arcane knowledge.
Thank you.
So it sounds like we need to
keep the guardrails.
Yes
And um that was an interesting
picture of the guardrail that
had eroded the base of it. My
question is just as we're
talking about the different
definitions, um, some countries,
um with radioactive waste.
You know, going through their
countries or different places,
um, they also um evaluated
whether it's low, medium, or
high level.
And, you know, I guess there's
different routes or something
like that that's not something
that we're considering, is it?
Madam Cha no, so the website is
specific to transuranic waste.
There's a waste acceptance
criteria that always has to meet
in order for it to come to the
website. Um.
They don't have the federal
government doesn't have a plan
for high-level waste. They don't
have a plan for spent nuclear
fuel. Their plan for spent
nuclear fuel is to move it from
the various nuclear power plant
sites to a consolidated interim
storage somewhere in America.
New Mexico is not interested,
um, and
and somewhere in outside New
Mexico, America.
And, and the
The challenge for me is we're
spending a lot of money to move
waste twice when they could
spend the money to build, to
find and build a repository for
spent nuclear fuel.
I didn't win for president.
Well, thank you for that, we are
pretty much in agreement, um,
anything else? OK.
Well, thank you, uh, appreciate
your hard work and um.
You know, protecting, uh, where
there were the floods and the
detours and uh coordinating that
so well. Thank you.
You're very welcome. Thank you.
OK, next we'll have the state
emergency response commission
report.
Um, we heard earlier in the.
Summer and.
Now we're ready for a report.
Thank you, Mr. Zack.
Watcher
Wachter, thank you.
Um
You're the local preparedness
program manager, homeland
security and emergency
management department and
Raymond G, is he able to be
here?
OK, so you have the floor, thank
you.
Let's start with the
like
And, uh, you know, how how
pretty it is and and there's
also a few in here that are
intended to add to levity
because, you know, this is kind
of a heavy topic, so I hope that
it'll.
Uh, read that way to, to the
committee.
Um
Couple of couple of things that
we'll cover today, uh, will be
emergency planning committee
right to NOAC, which I know you
guys are pretty familiar with,
um, activities of the state
emergency Response commission,
um, as well as some of the
activities of the New Mexico
Homeland Security program.
Uh, so in, in brief, the
emergency planning community
Right to Know Act is a federal
law. Uh, it was reflected in
state law and the hazardous
chemicals Information Act, which
requires that Hazmat uh being
stored by certain facilities
over uh over a certain quantity
can be, uh, has to be reported
as that responders and and
communities know what's in their
backyard.
Um, this is, uh, specifically
established in chapter 74 of the
uh New Mexico statute this uh
law we've talked about
previously, also establishes a
fee structure, um, for uh fees
to to.
That industry pays for the
storage of these chemicals is
used to fund hazmat preparedness
in New Mexico. Um.
We'll, we'll talk a little bit
more about that.
Uh, tier 2 reporting, um, this
past, uh, reporting year we had
over 20,000 tier two facilities
reported within the state of New
Mexico.
And
The uh
That information is available to
our emergency managers and
firefighters um through Web EOC,
which is a platform in the
state, um.
New Mexico Department of
Homeland Security and Emergency
Management uses and provides
access to, to all these
emergency managers, so that
information is broken down by
county is available to the
jurisdictions that.
Uh, moving on to, uh, cirque
activities, uh, we've had a
pretty busy year. The commission
uh has met, I should say, not
we, I, I just served the the
Commission, I don't actually
belong to the commission, but it
has been very, very busy. Um,
one of the first things this
commission did are the circ did
was update bylaws to allow for
continuity in the event that uh.
voting majority or quorum of
commissioners, commissions
expire without being reinstated,
uh, or new commissioners being
appointed by the governor so
that we can continue to carry
out activities of this
commission that occurred during
COVID-19. So, you know, lesson
learned from that was to update
the bylaws to allow business
that still continue in the
interim.
Uh, we were able to bring New
Mexico into compliance with
America's water infrastructure
Act. Uh, this was an amendment
to APRA or a Title II, uh, that
was passed in 2018 as a result
of the Flint, Michigan crisis
and the part that specifically
applicable to the circ was that
there needed to be a formalized
um
Procedure or policy for the
notification, um, between the
cirque and the drinking water
primacy agency of the state,
which would be the Drinking
Water Bureau. Uh, if the circ
became aware of contaminants,
uh,
Pollutants going into a drinking
water source within, uh, within
the jurisdiction. And in
reality, the drinking water
bureau would likely have that
information prior to the
commission, but this kind of
closes that information loop and
makes it formal, uh, so that
there is a policy and a
procedure for that to occur and,
and brings us in compliance with
that law as a state.
Uh, the commission also passed a
resolution to collaborate with
the RHMC, this, this committee
here, um.
To ensure that we're we're
inviting the committee to
Uh, future circ meetings that
we're uh sharing any
documentation that's requested
and that the state hazardous
materials coordinator, which is
a position that is within my
program and is currently vacant,
so I'm serving that capacity in
the interim, uh, we'll
collaborate with the, uh,
With the uh RHMC and this is um
intended to prevent kind of a
distance relationship, which I
feel has been
Um
We should be collaborating and,
and not, uh, and not in any
fault of the commission, the
CERC. I feel like in the, from
what I understand, the past has
not always been as responsive as
it could have been, and this is
intended to remedy that, set the
policy forward and, and make it
clear that, uh, the circ is, uh,
Go to collaborate and do as it's
supposed to and as is written in
law, uh, and, and, uh.
Answer to the RHMC.
Uh, we also, uh, put out several
policy interpretations regarding
EPRA to, to clarify, um, it's a
very big law and there's many
parts of there, they're pretty
ambiguous. uh, we can go into a
little bit more detail on that
and a further slide.
Uh, we've also, uh, this is
actually kind of exciting. We've
allowed for uh uh created an
opportunity for local emergency
planning committee districts to,
to uh voluntarily associate to
form regional planning
committees uh to allow the state
to better comply with EPA more
fully comply with EPRA.
Um
And we've had some, some uh
committee appointments
subcommittee. So moving on to um
The next slide, I think we can
actually move past America's
water infrastructure Act. We've,
we've pretty much covered that
already.
Um, with the policy
interpretations, the cir has
clarified a meeting uh frequency
requirements for local emergency
planning committees, which are
kind of like county level
cirques.
Um, this isn't explicitly
defined in law, so technically,
uh LAPC could form meet one time
and never meet again since 1987
and not be breaking the law. Um,
in, in that regard. Uh, we've
also developed a policy for LAPC
membership confirmations, uh,
and then that voluntary regional
planning district, uh, which
we're, we're
Working right now with Union
County.
Um, Quy County and Harding
County to uh
Facilitate a voluntary
association amongst them so
that.
Two of the 2 of those three
counties don't currently have an
LAPC and this is intended to
allow them to pull their
resources so that they're able
to build more planning capacity
and preparedness than they would
have if they had to do it
individually, especially because
they're very rural and and low
population.
Uh, we ran into, uh, kind of an
interesting situation. Um, we
have had members of the public
attending the uh commission
meetings throughout the year and
uh it was brought to the
attention of the commission that
Santa Fe County did not have an
LAPC and unlike some of the
other counties in New Mexico
that
Well, it's not ideal, it's
understandable because they're
very low population and the
staff there, personnel don't
really have the bandwidth. Santa
Fe County is, you know, fairly
well resourced and, and should
have the, the ability to do
that.
Uh, the circ did contact the
county commission. The county
has established an LAPC now, um.
That has
Put the cirque in a position
where it's kind of having to,
um,
Learn how to follow the letter
of the law and go through
appointments while respecting
local autonomy with the
appointment of commission
members to this newly formed
LEPC which
Hasn't really happened since the
1980s. So, because that was
when, when this law went into
effect. So we've been uh kind of
Working our way through that. I,
I think we're
We're making good progress on
it.
Uh, moving on, uh, LEPC meeting
in emergency plan review. Uh, we
outlined in a, in a policy
interpretation that the LAPCs
are recommended to meet at least
quarterly but are required to
meet at least annually. Uh, we
defined what needed to be
covered in their emergency plans
to, um, make sure that there is
a focus on hazmat, not
necessarily limiting it, but
making sure that the elements um
of a hazmat preparedness plan or
a hazmat emergency response
planner included because again,
um, as, as time.
has gone on
The, the focus of LAPCs is
sometimes shifted and we want to
make sure that the intent of, of
ECRA is being
Conducted and also clearly
delineate to between the
emergency plan for a hazmat
incident versus a comprehensive
emergency management plan or
emergency operations plan which
would typically be outside the
scope of a local emergency
planning.
Uh, continuing on
Uh, this just outlines the
emergency plan components. I
think we can, we can move past
that slide.
Uh, committee membership
recommendations. This has been,
um,
kind of a, I don't want to say a
hot button issue, but uh
an issue that's led to some
lively discussion, um.
The, the EPO law is written in
such a way that it states many,
many different offices and
groups should be included on an
LEPC and it goes into such uh
language where it's, it's pretty
vague, uh, in, in any individual
member of the public potentially
could serve on an LAPC. It also
says that owner operators of
private industry should be on
LAPCs and, and, uh.
That's simply not achievable
because you can't compel a
private employee of a private
industry to sit on this
committee, uh, if they don't
want to. Likewise, if you have
uh no requirements or minimum or
reason for qualification, you
could have a committee of 50,000
people, you know, in theory, and
that's never going to work
either. So we've been trying to
find a way to ensure that
there's equitable
representation uh from the
community and industry as well
as, you know, government, uh,
but in a way that businesses
still be able to.
be conducted effectively.
Moving to the next slide, uh,
this is a section 301C of EPRA,
and this is a piece of law or
the piece of the law that
enables the state of emergency
Response commission to draw.
LEPC districts, most states have
them uh drawn as counties, uh,
New Mexico has done that. Um, it
makes a lot of sense, but it's
also sometimes not the most
practical when you do have very
rural and remote areas that are
not able to stand up a committee
easily.
Um, based on that language and
then the following section,
which is Part D, um, oh, I'm
sorry, this, well, this is
applicable to both, but this
goes into the appointment and
nomination process. I think we
can move past.
Pass this to the uh voluntary
regional planning districts, uh,
slide.
Um, so that, uh, previously
quoted section of ER 301C as
well as um
301A and 301D, uh.
Give the commission the ability
to, to draw those districts and
also redraw them in the future.
And that's the language that
we're leaning on to a lot of
these counties to voluntary
voluntarily associate.
And I was asked the question by
one of the county emergency
managers, why not just dictate
from the commission, this is the
new district and I think it's
more likely to succeed if uh
If this comes from the ground up
rather than the top down.
So, um,
We've we've covered this pretty
well too.
Uh, we can
Continue on to the next slide.
State Emergency Response mission
is tasked with establishing
hazardous materials training
standards for state uh hazardous
materials responders, um, the
port is met, I believe once this
year, uh.
We had uh we had a chair
appointed, uh, he, he wound up
moving out of state. So that
kind of um slowed us down a
little bit, but we are, um.
We are still very much have, we,
we do still very much have eyes
on the hazardous Materials
Safety Board, and we're hoping
to, to kind of build a little
bit of synergy between the HMSB
and the state's qualification
review and governance committee,
which is our, our
Qualification review board under
the National Qualification
System, which is a federal
mandate for emergency managers
and responders to, to establish
training qualifications. So
there's, um, I think an
opportunity for us to, to
leverage the QRGC to
More fully implement the the.
Training standards that the HMSB
is intended and required to
establish for hazmat responders.
Uh, the hazardous materials
response plan on the next slide,
um.
So we've, we've got a little bit
of an issue with this, um, the
hammer plan.
Uh
From, from what I can tell, and,
and we've talked with our
counsel a little bit about this.
This law appears to be
Broken in a section, um, there
is a task force that was
established in the statute and
repealed in in 2007.
And that task force was one of
its jobs or its primary job was
to establish the hammer plan,
the hazardous materials
emergency response plan. The
HMSB was intended to create
training standards that mirrored
what was established in the
hazardous materials emergency
response plan and this task
force as well as the HMSB would,
uh, report to the State
Emergency Response commission,
but this task force was repealed
and no language was added to.
Delegate that authority to write
the plan to another body. Um, so
the plan is kind of
Drawing authority from itself is
the plan.
Um, so I, I think this is
something that um
Probably we, we would either
need to re-establish the task
force or do cleanup language to
uh assign authority to
Another body or another position
to, to create that plan at some.
So I'm, I'm working with our
general counsel on that at the
moment. Uh, moving forward, uh,
hazardous materials, um,
Excellent response training. Uh,
so this is also a kind of in the
same realm, there was an update
to uh
Some of the, the hazardous
materials training standards
and, and I, I'm careful to speak
to you specifically because this
is getting to kind of the the
edge of my knowledge. Uh, but
there has been
Nationally updates the training
standards. We do have training
centers established and
administrative code and I'm
working with some subject matter
experts right now to determine
if we need to do updates to that
code to make sure that we're
still falling in line with best
practices nationally on hazmat
training standards.
Um, the hazardous materials
emergency preparedness grant,
uh, this is not directly under
the purview of the circ, but it
is under the state hazmat
coordinator, uh, this grant is
about $225,000 a year. Uh, it's
an 80/20 match. We use it
typically to fund hazmat
training and hazmat preparedness
activities for local
jurisdictions. And this also
funds the hazmat coordinator
position uh at DHSEM.
It
Uh, we did support, uh, the Los
Alamos National Labs hazardous
Materials Challenge, uh, this
year. Uh, we're trying to grow
our collaboration with them, uh,
they invite hazardous materials
emergency response teams from
across the country to train and
compete with each other.
Uh, we've also, uh, going on to
emergency response guides, um.
The Department of Transportation
pipeline and hazardous Materials
Safety Administration collects
fees from private industry that
transport has met across the,
across the nation, and they use
that money to print and
distribute hundreds of thousands
of these orange books, these
emergency response guides, which
give first responders
information on how to
Um
How to respond if they're the
first on scene for a hazmat
incident. And uh this gets
updated every 4 years. We have
successfully distributed, uh,
ERGs to all 33 counties in New
Mexico. So we're good for the
next 4 years on that.
Then, uh, coming up on the last
slide, some of the challenges
that this position in this
program are, are facing the
hazmat coordinator position is
grant funded, um.
That is a challenge because it
takes away from, from kind of
the limited pool of money that
we're able to use to fund local
jurisdictions and like volunteer
fire departments and things to
hazmat training or to do
commodity flow studies, these
different things to increase
their preparedness. Um, I am
getting traction right now on
reclassifying this position is
classed as an emergency
management specialist, which
adds a lot of kind of a litany
of experience requirements to
it, and it's really an
administrator rather than an
emergency manager position and
it's also a pay band 65.
which traditionally have been
difficult to fill because they
require 6 years of either
experience, education, or a
combination of both, but, and,
and it's been, it's been better,
uh, where, where the pay is on
them now, but they used to be
kind of low paying. So if, if
you had somebody with a master's
degree, they usually weren't
gonna take those payments 65
positions. So they're, they're
always a little bit tricky to
fill. But I think we're moving
in the right direction on that.
And that's relevant because
that's the, the classification
for the hazmat coordinator
position, which is vacant right
now.
Uh, the hazardous chemicals
Information Act, um, you know,
we talked, um, in depth about
this previously, uh, that is
still an objective, um, for my
program and, and also I, I, I
think I'm safe to speak for the
circ on this one for, for the
circ as well to uh modernize
that and update it um because
that will have a cascading
positive impact on, on hazmat
preparedness in the state.
Uh, we are using a very
antiquated tier 2 reporting
system. Uh, we received tier 2
reports uh by email, as I
mentioned, there are 20,000
sites, uh, that doesn't
necessarily mean 20,000 emails.
Many of them are one owner
operator with several 1000 sites
in some cases, but we will get a
couple 2000 emails every March,
um, of all these reports, and
then we get paper checks to go
along with them for the fees.
Uh, I'm trying to work with my
department to create a web
portal where that can be
done online that'll um
One, lower the amount of effort
that goes into it too enable
much easier accountability and
accuracy and and record keeping
with that. Um.
But having that kind of
antiquated.
Process is, is a bit of a
challenge and then um another
challenge, uh, that's been on my
radar is a lawsuit called um
communication Workers of America
versus Middlesex County that
occurred in New Jersey where um
Uh, this union asked for a copy
of the county's uh
hazardous materials emergency
plan that an LAPC would create
the county, Middlesex County did
not have an LAPC, um.
And then a lawsuit occurred and
the state was found at fault for
not ensuring that that county
had an LAPC.
And this is a challenge because
there's no teeth written into
either the hazardous chemicals
Information Act or EPRA. So the
best that the state or the CERC
really I should say, can do is
say you really should have an
LAPC. It says you have to have
one. And they, you know, the
county could go great, thanks
for letting us know and that's
the end of it, right? There's
nothing to make them comply. And
that's been one of the big
driving factors behind that
regional emergency planning
committee, um, opportunity was
that we do have these really
small counties where even if
they want to, it's, they're not
really able to.
Instant the intent is to be able
to bring the state ideally into
a 100% compliance where all of
our counties are covered under
uh an LAPD or a regional
committee.
And then going on to our 2nd to
last slide, um.
Some of the outlook and
objectives, uh.
Kind of already talked about
compliance with EPRA, uh,
regional planning committees. I,
I do want to integrate now that
we're complying with the
America's water infrastructure
Act. I want to make sure that
we're, um,
Not just creating this document
that says we have a process now
and then never testing that
process. So, um,
Every year the our department
does what's called the
integrated preparedness plan,
uh, where we, we
Plan out ideally what the next
36 months will look like as far
as training, exercise, and other
preparedness initiatives, and I
want to integrate that into it
so that when we do have these
different trainings and
exercises that we're we're
testing that process and making
sure it works and making sure
that people are, are aware of
it, right?
Uh, potentially updating MAC to
comply with the current uh
current hazmat standards, uh, I
want to collaborate more with
this committee, um,
You know, tier 2 portal, kind of
the stuff we've already talked
about. I think I'm, I'm kind of
beating a dead horse at this
point, so.
Um
That is
That is the end of my uh my
slide show here, Madam Chair,
and, and this committee, um, I'd
be happy to answer any
questions.
Mint and pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
For your presentation. I think
I'm more distracted by the um
sites here in the pictures.
Um
So this is your presentation.
Uh,
madam chair, Senator Pinto, yes,
I I actually initially created
this for an emergency management
conference. So, um, I, I
probably could have made it a
little bit more serious. I hope
that, uh,
I hope that
I think this is Pope right here.
Yeah, that's what I think.
You pick Thursday the page
number for
um the
the town hall meeting and um I
think this young gentleman was
one of my students too. He's a
champion deer wrestler Rooster
Yazi.
Uh
Yeah, yeah, it's, but well, I
guess in some sense, the, the
These, uh, the local places.
Will they have a place to be.
Um, madam chair, Senator Pinto,
that's, that's a really great
question. So, um, the, if I
understand correctly, the local
emergency planning committees,
where, where do they kind of
fall into government and, and
what
Uh, yeah, so they are.
How would they be housed so
Available meeting spaces,
Sandoval County uh meets at the
firehouse, um, they, uh,
Farmington, uh, San Juan County,
they'll have it at their
convention center, um,
occasionally, just different,
different meeting spaces and,
and the committees, um, again,
they're, they're only
Required to meet once a year
with this new interpretation
letter, recommended quarterly,
um, and much like the circ,
they're made up of some
full-time employees that this is
an additional, you know,
collateral duty, uh, but also,
you know, volunteers, members of
the community, different
industry partners. So, um, it's
not something that necessarily
needs like a, a permanent space
in the community, but just the
place they can use as needed.
So not that church or the
launch.
Representative Saraanov, thanks,
Madam Chair. I just have a quick
question on, um, when you were
talking about the LECPs.
Um, you don't have a 100%, yeah,
well, you have 13 districts
without active LEC.
Do you need teeth? Do you need
something in, in.
Statue or or with an exception
to the small districts that
can't do it, what?
Uh, Madam chair, uh,
representative.
It would, it would be helpful.
That's, you know, my ideal
solution isn't, I, I don't like
going in and, and being like, do
this or else, right? No, nobody
wants that to happen and having
these LAPCs are inherently a
good thing, like the, the work
they do is important. Having
that planning and having that
community awareness matters. So
I think
Part of it is awareness. Part of
it is
Capability, it usually falls to
the county emergency manager to,
to kind of run that, and they're
often only a 1 or 2 person shop
and, and
Do had it at the, at the
minimum. Um, so I, I don't
Yes, it would, um, but I'd like
that if, if that was an ability
that we had, I'd like it to be a
sparing, you know, kind of a
last resort thing rather than
the default because I, I think
Uh
I'd rather approach it as how
can I help you achieve this
rather than if you don't, here's
what's going to happen to you.
But
You know, having a stick is, is
helpful.
Yeah
how we could maybe.
or something so that they have a
but they we have to show it to
someone, but
You know
Senator Steinborn.
Thank you chairs Zack, um, first
of all, good job, um, yeah, it
is.
Definitely wins an award is the
most entertaining and engaging
presentation.
Um, PowerPoint of the day,
including all the cool images
which.
There's a couple I'm pretty sure
called AI concoctions cause like
you've you've mashed up several.
Closing I know we.
It's really good, good job on
that. Um.
But I, I, I really want to thank
you for, for doing good work.
Like, not only getting the
commission going to be able to
talk to us, which
have been an issue, but also
just getting the state where it
needs to be and all the little
communities. I mean, it's one of
those things that you don't
think you need it until
Things go south, then suddenly
these relationships in this
network will save lives
potentially, so
You know, being prepared and
drilling and all these things
are important, super important.
So thank you for your work and
uh recognize it. I just have one
question for you. Um,
The grant money that's coming
in, the $250,000 is that federal
money that comes to the state?
Yeah, uh, Madam Sheriff Senator
Steinborn, it is, it's a, it's a
Department of Transportation
grant, um, that has a 20% cost
share from the state of New
Mexico, which we fund out of the
money we collect from the, the
tier 2 fees, which is typically
$50,000 to $60,000 a year.
OK. And then, um,
What kind of demand do you get
from
Mes around the state for that
money.
Uh,
there's, there's not a, um,
Madam Chair, Senator Steinborn,
uh, not, not enough is, is the
short answer. Um, it's in
One of the, I, I feel like the
easiest things we could do would
be.
To, to fund the state hazmat
coordinator position out of
general fund, as opposed to out
of this grant because that will,
because that takes that whole
total compensation package and
almost doubles the amount that
we can flow through to local
jurisdictions that they can use
to, to attend trainings,
maintain certifications, things
like that.
It, it would, uh
It would have a tangible impact.
Interesting.
So right now,
Um, and this is money, this is
money that creates a position in
the Homeland Security
Department.
Yes, sir.
Your point
And
uh Steinor part of it too is, is
the position is not optional
either. It wasn't created
because of the grant, the
positions mandated and statute
to exist under DHSEM, but it's
unfunded, which is created in
state statute. Yes, sir.
Interesting.
How much demand do you have for
these grants every year?
We've been uh man Steinbor,
we've been working to increase
um interest in the grant. I, I,
I think some of the recipients
got kind of frustrated with some
of the hoops they had to jump
through in the past and, and so
we've been trying to manage it a
little bit better.
Uh, we
Oh, gosh.
Typically, typically 3 to 4
departments will apply for it.
They will ask for, we never have
enough to fund every project, so
then we have to go through like
a prioritization in a
competitive grant award cycle.
So I think we were short.
And I don't quote me on it but I
want to say about 90 or $100,000
on this past cycle, and we're
actually going through an award
cycle right now. We have
application, uh, application due
date coming up on the
twenty-seventh. What are, man,
I'm sure, what are the kinds of
Steinborn, um.
A lot of airport firefighter,
uh, training is a big one that's
very popular, um.
We get, uh, we typically get,
uh, San Juan County Farm
Farmington Fire Department in
City of Santa Fe, um, or it
might be Sanit County, I
apologize. Um.
I think it is county because
they use it for airport
firefighter training as well. So
these firefighter teams have
certain qualifications they have
to maintain and they have to go
through typically annual, uh,
airport uh firefighter response
is a very specific one and
that's been a popular one that
they use uh this grant for to be
able to maintain their
certification so that they can
respond to like aircraft and
airport accidents. Uh, we also
funded a project I'm I'm pretty
excited about through uh with
Doniana County, um.
They're uh doing a commodity
flow study, which is where you
Look at all the traffic that's
going through your community,
uh, your commercial traffic,
potentially pipelines real, but
a lot of semi trucks and things
like that and figuring out what
hazardous chemicals are being
transported most frequently in
what areas so that you know how
to train and what equipment to
get for your responders and for
your hospitals and everything.
So, um, that's uh one of the
more recent projects we funded.
He is this um getting funding as
a general fund, is this a
priority to the department.
Something you guys have asked
for. It's a priority to to my
program
um, I would love to see it be uh
uh be a bigger priority within
New Mexico's emergency
management.
System, um.
I, I don't need to tell anybody
here that, you know, hazmat has
very
Far-reaching and cascading
consequences and it's very easy
to forget about that until, you
know, as you mentioned before,
until that bad thing happens and
then all the things that you
should have done become crystal
clear and
Um, I'm always trying to
champion more interest in this
program and more support, uh,
you know, internally and, and
within the whole state.
Thanks for making the case
today, and I think that'd be a
good thing.
To do so maybe.
And we can explore it.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator.
Uh, thank you and um.
We welcome and um yes, um.
We have all committees should
champion, you know what you're
trying to do, and, um, are there
any things that you?
Uh, I mean, besides supporting
all these things
Madam Chair, thank you, uh, and
thank you for giving me the
opportunity. I I wish I had
thought, thought.
Thought about that before uh
being up here, but
Um
Uh, you know, because, because
everybody here represents local
communities and, and so I think,
you know,
It's
It needs to be both top down and
bottom up, right? And so,
Pushing for support in local
government for hazmat
preparedness, um, you know, for
having an LAPC if, if your
jurisdiction doesn't currently
have one, that's going to be
like a huge step, right? If we
can get to where all 33 counties
are covered under an LAPC or
regional committee, that's going
to protect us from liability,
and 2, it's just going to make
our community safer and more
prepared, um, as people become
more aware and they're thinking
about it and they're looking at
these things. I I think that's
going to help drive demand for
our HMEP grant and if we can
show that
We are continuing to get
increased and increased demand,
we can make a case to the
Department of Transportation to,
to give us a larger award, um,
in the future, so.
That would be um those things
would be helpful.
I, I hesitate cause I, I have a
couple layers above me, um,
where I have to get, get
approval to pursue different
projects, but um I still am very
passionate about updating the
hazardous chemicals Information
Act, um,
With a specific interest in
In uh updating the fee
structure, um, you know, we
talked about last time that,
that fee structure was
established in 1987, adjusted
for inflation are hazardous
materials, our tier 2 fees that
we collect each year would be
worth about
2.5 times more than they are
right now. And, and that would
Again, those seem like such
small numbers, but by being able
to like fund the hazmat
coordinator out of general funds
instead of a grant or being able
to, um,
Update these fees for inflation.
That extra 20 or $300,000 a year
can be the difference between,
you know, 5 rural volunteer fire
departments getting hazardous
materials training or not, you
know, and those are going to be,
those are the people that you
want to make sure have that
training cause, you know, most
of New Mexico is rural and most
of New Mexico is, is, um, you
know, depending on these
volunteer fire departments and,
and making sure that we're able
to train and equip our
responders, um, to handle any
situation.
That's, that's a good list, um.
And as different committee
members or um.
Art of LFC and looking at those
um budgets um that might be
something that they could put in
a good word, if not our
committee also, um.
So, um
And you do get your award
through DOT.
That's correct, Madam Chair, uh,
specifically the pipeline and
hazardous Materials Safety
Administration under desertous
materials Safety Administration.
Any other questions?
OK.
Thank you very much. I
appreciate it for the madam
chair and thank you for the um.
The pictures that were.
So entertaining.
Uh, next on our agenda, we have
the Defense nuclear facility
Safety Board report, Mr.
Jonathan.
How
All right, good afternoon, Madam
Chair, members of the committee.
My name is Jonathan Blowy.
I'm
pleased to be here in Santa Fe
to uh provide an update on the
good work the defense nuclear
facility Safety Board is doing
in the communities surrounding
Los Alamos, uh, Sandia and the
waste isolation pile of plants
and just a bit of my background
before I took my current
leadership position. I was one
of the board's on-site resident
inspectors at Los Alamos for 9
years.
I've previously come before this
committee to brief you on the,
the work of the defense board
and I look forward to getting,
giving you more information
today.
Next slide.
So quickly just an overview, uh,
for those that are unfamiliar
with the defense board both on
the committee and the members of
the public watching here today.
I wanted to give you a bit of a
background on the safety board
with the safety board does in
our role, um.
Across the daily nuclear
complex. I wanted to talk a
little bit about two of the big,
more prominent initiatives the
Safety Board has that impact New
Mexico, but also some of the
other sites, and I want to get
into the specifics of what the
safety board has been working on
at the three sites within New
Mexico.
So next slide.
So just a brief overview of the
safety board. So the safety
board is an independent agency.
That means we, we do not work
for the Department of Energy. We
are our own small agency, uh,
the board is composed of
5 presidentially appointed
experts that are confirmed by
the Senate. Currently we have 3.
I'm happy to report, Doctor Lee
just came on board within the
last few months after her
confirmation. We also have
another board member that has
passed through his committee
vote. He's waiting for a floor
vote at the Senate to become a
board member. That's Mr. Ike
White. You may recall his name.
He's been uh prominent in the
DOE environmental management
leadership.
Um, also previously a board
staffer once upon a time, uh,
overall, the role of the board
is to provide advice and
recommendations to the Secretary
of Energy about safety at the
Defense nuclear facilities. Uh,
so we are a health and safety uh
tied to nuclear materials is
essentially the role.
Mala.
So I'm happy to report to the
board is celebrating its
thirty-fifth anniversary, so the
board was set up in the late
1980s, uh, the Department of
Energy sites were having some
problems, particularly the Rocky
flat flats plants in in
Colorado. Congress was concerned
about this and wanted to
establish an independent
oversight body of the Department
of Energy is self-regulating and
so it's a little bit of the uh.
Wolf guarding the hen house.
So they wanted some, some
independent watchdogs, uh,
composed of experts that could
provide advice to the secretary.
Next slide.
Uh, this just shows the defense
nuclear facilities across the
country of most interest for you
all to hear today. You have 3 in
the state of New Mexico. Uh, the
other point of interest, some of
these defense nuclear
facilities, the board has
stationed on-site resident
inspectors, and we have on-site
resident inspectors here at Los
Alamos. I'll talk a little bit
more about that when we get to
Liz I next slide.
A little bit about what the
safety board does, what, what
our scope of the safety
oversight is. So we look at all
aspects of the Department of
Energy, the National Nuclear
Security Administration's
defense programs work. So this
is the nuclear weapons program.
We also look at the DOE's
environmental management
program, so cleaning up the
hazards and the wastes from the
legacy of weapons production. So
for example, at Los Alamos, we
look at both the operations by
triad and by N3B.
Uh, we look at design and
construction projects. We look
at DOE standards we evaluate the
operations on a day to day
basis.
Next slide.
Some of the board's oversight
activities, um, I, I just kind
of briefly summarize some of
that is to look, look through
the departments, uh, safety
standards and directives, the
regulations, comment on those,
uh, we do investigate abnormal
events and safety issues along
those lines and look at data
operational events, you know,
like that. And my current role
is to look at design and
construction and in the large uh
capital assets that are being
constructed across the across
the.
complex. So in particular out in
New Mexico, we're looking at uh
the large project to installment
system at the WIP facility and
the activities to install
significant amounts of equipment
into the plutonium facility at
Los Alamos.
Uh, some of the board's
authorities.
uh
The most significant of the
board's statutory authorities is
to issue a formal investigation
of a formal recommendation to
the Secretary of Energy, uh,
recommendation compels the
Secretary of Energy to respond
to either accept or reject the
safety advice, um, and if they
accept the safety recommendation
they issue a implementation plan
which essentially states what
the department is going to do to
resolve the same beneath that,
the board can issue a reporting
requirement compelling the
Secretary of Energy to provide
more
Information, it could be in the
form of questions, it could be
more data on a particular topic,
uh, but they're statutorily
required to provide that
information.
Uh, the board can conduct open
or closed hearings. We've done
that several times in New
Mexico, most recently in 2022 in
Santa Fe talking about
activities at the plutonium
facility for Los Alamos.
Uh, the board also has the power
to subpoena witnesses if needed,
um, and conduct investigations
and special studies.
Next slide.
So one of the boards
Or prominent
Activities recently is a
campaign on aging infrastructure
management.
And so some of those activities
involve a public hearing at the
board's headquarters in August,
uh, the board brought in.
Experts from external entities,
so they had representatives from
NASA, the Government
Accountability Office, nuclear
regulatory Commission, US Army
Corps of Engineers and the
American Nuclear Society, the
point was to gain best practices
from these organizations, uh,
that could be applied to the
Department of Energy's
operations.
The board is also putting
together and is stood up by
website repository of
information on aging
infrastructure. This includes
information from, you know,
international sources and on
best practices uh to do things
like monitor concrete,
degradation with time, things
along that line. And on that
point, I, I should take a minute
and explain why, why should we
care about aging infrastructure
management here in New Mexico.
Uh, so you can look at two
examples. You've got what I
characterizeized as a middle
aged facility.
Take a look at the whip facility
and the plutonium facility at
Los Alamos, uh, both foreseeably
have many decades more of
operations in place. DUE
currently does not have a set of
requirements or a standard that
uh compels the contractors and
site offices to take a look at
at a certain point in time.
And go through a life extension
process, something that would
take a look at this building or
this facility was constructed
under these standards, and
here's what the modern standards
say. Here's what the difference
is, are there's gaps that are
important that should be
addressed through things like
upgrades or enhanced monitoring,
things along those lines. And so
the board is engaged with the
department. We've got a series
of workshops at the staff level
to try to see if uh.
The department can adopt the
standard to do that. For
example, the American Nuclear
Society has a standard that
covers aging infrastructure
management includes uh
activities for extending
facility life. So we're working
with them to try to get that
into their requirements set.
Next slide.
So the board issued a
recommendation. It's 2.
23-1 it's regarding on-site
transportation safety. Uh, what
that means when you're
transporting nuclear materials
at a facility on the DUE
property. They follow DUE rules
as opposed to Department of
Transportation regulations which
are followed when it goes off
site on public highways and
roads.
And so the board had been
studying the transportation
safety document that was used at
Los Alamos and identified a
number of weaknesses with that
document. We've, uh, the board
has been able to get those
weaknesses, uh, initially
addressed through some companies
measures, but they also found
that these weaknesses likely
derived from um some pretty
fundamental weaknesses in the
underlying directives that DUE
has to create these
transportation safety documents.
And so the board recommended
that the transportation safety
document that was
almost get fixed and then those
underlying directives get
updated to reflect best
practices and doing safety
analysis in a transportation
environment.
Uh, they also recommended that
DUE perform a causal analysis to
figure out how this situation,
uh, which appears to have lapsed
for for many years to persist,
uh, where one safety regulation
did not get the same level of
update as as others.
Uh, so he did accept the
recommendation and delivered its
implementation plans to the
board back in October. The board
and its staff are looking
through that implementation plan
as we speak and we'll be
actively monitoring that,
particularly the, the actions
taken out with Alamos.
So PF4, the plutonium facility
at Los Alamos. I've I've spoken
about this many times before,
just a bit of background. PF 4
is the only facility the
department has across the
complex that can perform um
really work with all forms of
plutonium in large quantities
and so there was some discussion
this morning about the pit
production mission that is
clearly one of the missions in
the facility. I think we all
know that they're undergoing the
transition from a research and
development facility to a
production facility, uh, but I
do want to emphasize.
That is not the only mission in
the facility. The the other
emissions, including heat
source, plutonium processing and
surplus plutonium disposition
that also pre uh present hazards
to the workers and the public,
and that's something we're,
we're concerned about and
watching that's adequately
covered in the safety analysis.
Um, I mentioned earlier.
PF4s midlife it's approaching 50
years in its life and it has
many years to go, um, next
slide.
Some of these topics we've
talked about in the past, there
are some long-standing safety,
uh, areas that the, the board
has been pushing dearly to make
improvements. I will say
progress continues, um, the
board, while the board continues
to evaluate sort of what the end
state looks like and the
adequacy of that end state, uh,
a lot of that depends on the new
safety analysis that Line is
conducting. Um, they're using
the most modern standard to
provide to to perform that
safety analysis, and we have
staff looking at that.
The analysis and ensuring the
safety control set that is
derived from that analysis is
appropriate. Uh, we know that
some of the existing safety
controls already have
weaknesses. Uh, the board has
been following the resolution of
those weaknesses. I can report,
you know, one of the problems
had been with the fire
suppression system in PF4. I was
at PF4 yesterday. They are
actively digging a trench to
bring in a dedicated water line
that will help improve the
seismic robustness of the fire
suppression system. So
continues, um, that said, there
are many challenges ahead and
we, we have our work cut out.
You all know the facilities
undertaken a production mission,
taking on a lot of new
workforce, um, and has a
complicated, hard, important
job.
Next slide.
So as I mentioned, the board
also oversees RAG.
Um, the regime.
Some things we like to
highlight.
Uh, and 3DB did just recently
developed and it was approved
actually earlier this week, a
new documented safety analysis
and the safety analysis was
developed using the most modern
standards, so that, that's a
very good thing. They'll be
implementing that safety basis,
um, in the coming months, we
have staff that will be
following the implementation of
that safety basis and what that
really means is the safety
controls are the, where they're
supposed to be.
Um, some other positives, uh,
you heard the report this
morning from the, the manager of
EMLA. They've made great
progress with the corrugated
metal pipes have removed those
from the, their, their
underground status, uh, which
you did not hear previously
earlier in the year and last
year, uh, let's go through their
waste inventory and look for
potentially reactive waste. They
did find some of that, they took
appropriate action to segregate
that and
Provide additional controls, um.
Some challenges, the new safety
basis looks at fundamentally
most of the, mostly the existing
storage mission, um, there's
Clearly gonna be more
complicated, hazardous retrieval
activities in the near future,
the safety analysis and the
controls to support that remain.
Um
Likewise, the N3B team is still
relatively
Immature and it's, it's, it's
process of you know conducting
nuclear operations and the
forthcoming operations will be
significantly more hazardous
than, for example, the Kirgga
metal pipe. So they have some
work to do. I think they
understand they have some work
to do with their workforce, but
those are some of the challenge.
Next slide.
So I'll just talk a little bit.
I won't go through all this in
detail, but the, the review
plans for Los Alamos, and I'll
note the board has an annual
work plan. Uh, they recently
approved that work plan, and it
will be posted to the board's
website. Uh this talks about the
the safety reviews that the
headquarters staff will be
conducting at each of the sites.
Uh, if you look at some of the
things that are safety reviews
that were conducted at Los
Alamos.
Uh, they completed a review on
glove box safety also completed
a review on chemical
compatibility program for
transuranic waste.
Those were both the board
letters that were issued on
those with the dates listed on
the slide.
Looking ahead to the rest of
this year.
I mentioned the safety analysis
for both PF4 and AG or will be a
focus of work uh believe you all
understand that.
Flannel is actively removing
lots of glove boxes and
contaminated equipment from the
plutonium facility. We've got a
team looking at how that work is
conduct, you know, planned and,
and conducted.
Um
Likewise, they're buying and
installing many new glove boxes.
We're taking a look at the
design for those new glove boxes
to ensure that they are, they're
adequate.
So, excellent. So I mentioned
earlier, the Los Alamos was an
inspectors. I wanted to
introduce Eric Freeman. He's one
of our newer resident
inspectors. Uh, we've actually
staffed up to 3 resident
inspectors, which is our target.
And so,
Yeah
Possibly we're going to get 11
other visitor here, but we do
have 3 now and uh that we do
annually assess whether, you
know, our current staffing meets
the needs by looking at things,
uh, the current tempo of
operation, uh, you know,
frequency of issues, things like
that. So 3 is what we believe is
adequate today and we're happy
to have Eric and then Jason Kemp
on board. You've met Mr.
Gertovsky in the past, so.
Next slide.
So I understand the committee
wanted to understand, uh, learn
more about some of the concerns
that the board identified in a
letter back in May concerning
the safety significant
confinement ventilation system
at WIP.
And so I can, I can speak to
that in great detail, uh, the
safety significant confinement,
ventilation system. It was a,
it's a large project, it's a
corrective action from the 2014
release, uh, basically what the
system is composed of is a set
of continuous air monitors that
detects airborne radiation and
upon detection of the radiation,
switch the ventilation system to
a HEPA filter. So HIPA is a high
efficiency particulate air
filter, and that's what's
typically
for nuclear air cleaning. And so
the idea is if there is a
release ventilation is switched
through these hepa filters to
prevent uh radioactive material
from reaching the environment.
And so the board's been studying
the design for this and what the
board communicated back in May
were concerns regarding the
continuous air monitors and so
those are the devices that need
to detect the airborne
radiation, the type of radiation
radioactive material that we're
most concerned about here is
alpha emitting radioactive
material, alpha radiation can
easily be stopped, for example,
a piece of paper, and so the
concern here was whether salt
dust from, you know, mining.
just transport in the mind would
build up on the detector and
prevent it from from uh alpha
radiation from hitting the
detector and then activating the
system. So that was one concern.
The other concern was the
location of where do we want to
place these continuous air
monitors within the mine, uh,
relative to where postulated
accidents could occur, uh, what
the board found was there was an
area of the mine where active,
you know, waste transport
activities occur.
that if there were a release in
that section, uh, the CAMs would
not in fact detect the release
and so the board raised those.
next slide.
This is kind of a diagram that
It's meant to illustrate that
that last point, but I'll try to
just do it in more simplistic
terms rather than doing that.
You just take this room, if you
were to envision we had another.
Exit
To my right, and that exit to my
right where the, you know, the
exhaust out of the underground.
We'd have a camel arm over
behind at the podium there
detecting any material that came
from that back room, but we
would not have a came alarm for
any radioactive material may
have been released from the
front door, the location issue
and uh
Yeah, the board raised those
concerns. Uh, the board was
briefed by DUE back in
September. I'm also happy to
report that DUE finally
responded yesterday formally in
writing, so that'll be on the
board's website, uh.
In essence, the concern about
the environmental
qualifications, so this is the
salt and soot build up on the
detectors,
uh, DUI, I think understands the
problem. They are going to be
taking a phased approach to
starting up the ventilation
system. And so what this means
is you can view it as they're
starting in safe mode. So when
they start up the system, all of
the the ventilation flow will go
through the HEPA filters. So
they're not relying on the
continuous air monitors to, to
perform its safety function, and
they're going to take that
opportunity.
To do some additional testing on
the continuous air monitors, see
how much salt they build up, see
if some of the uh engineering
they built into those monitors
actually works in the in the
mine environment. So I believe
that's a good thing, a positive
development there on the other
concern as far as the location
of the CAMs, uh, the department
committed to re-evaluate some of
those postulated accident
scenarios in that location and
determine what the appropriate
control set is. So, well, that's
not an immediate, uh, yes, we're
going to move the cams.
That is a commitment to go look
at whether they have the right
and I can assure you the board
will be excellent.
So just, here's another wrap up
of, of some of the activities at
WIP. What, what's been performed
and what, what's planned, uh,
the main action has been worked
on the safety
significantfinement ventilation
system over the last few years.
We have some additional reviews
planned on that and the startup
of that system, uh, there's some
reviews on the ventilation
system for the confined uh for
the waste handling building,
call it more whip adjacent, but
we do have staff that follow
the, the National Transatic
Waste Program, and those are the
folks from Carl.
bad that go to the generator
sites to ensure the generator
sites, places like Los Alamos
are creating their waste and
packaging their waste
appropriately. Uh, we also are
monitoring the disposition of
the remaining, uh,
inappropriately remediated
nitrate salt containers that
reside across the border in
Andrews, Texas.
Uh, next to Sandia.
Uh, Sandy has got a bit of a
smaller footprint than the two
other facilities. We do have
some ongoing work. We did have
our vice chairman visit last
summer, or actually this past
summer to observe it uh
emergency exercise, and then
this year we've got a team
that's investigating some
characterization data on the
reactor fuel coming out of the
annual core research reactor,
uh, that's an old reactor.
There's some indication that
the, the reactor fuel is aging
in a manner that was unexpected.
We have some experts.
Taking a look at the the
information on that fuel, uh, to
ensure that it can maintain its
uh it's integrity.
Uh, also not, not listed here,
but uh we'll likely be
commencing a review of the
design for the Crest Project,
and this is the combined
radiation environments for
survivability tests. This is
really the replacement
capability for the ACRR reactor
and so that's a design and
construction project that I'll
be heavily next slide.
So just a bit on public and
worker engagement, uh, part of
the board's mission is, is to
provide transparency and
information to the public, um,
along those lines, one of the
initiatives the board took this
year was to bring on Kyle
Johnson.
You're with me today, so he's
our director of congressional
and external affairs, and his,
his role is to improve our
outreach to governments and
communities around the defense
nuclear facilities. So in fact,
I took him out to the Defense
nuclear facilities in New
Mexico. We were in Santa Fe, or
I'm sorry, Sandia and Los Alamos
during this trip. Uh, the other
development I'd want to
highlight is the board has uh
implemented a safety allegations
program and so workers, members
of the public, anyone that's got
a concern and a nuclear
the concern at a defense nuclear
facility and email uh use that
email address, send in their
concern, and we have a, a formal
process to evaluate the concern.
So those are, are two new
developments, and uh with that
just my last slide. I'm happy to
take your questions.
We'll just go around.
That
Yes, Representative Sareane.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you for your presentation. And
you went a little fast on slide
19 about Indian National Labs,
could you just do that one more
time for me.
Sure.
So things recent.
Recent activity, so our vice
chairman, Mr. Summers was out
here, I believe it was in July
to observe an emergency
exercise. Uh, so all the DOE
sites are required to have an
annual emergency exercise where
they, you know, go through the
motions of a postulated accident
and and basically practice or
test themselves, um, test their
level of preparedness. So we had
a board member and some staff,
um, observe that as far as uh
activities moving forward. We
have a review plan taking a look
at the, the fuel health we're
calling it.
For the annual core research
reactor. So there's been some
recent uh characterization
information that suggests the
fuel is behaving, maybe not in
the expected manner. It's old
fuel and so our folks with uh
the other thing I, I added I
should put a, put a bullet on
it, but there's a large design
and construction project that's
the Crest project. It's, it's
the replacement capability for
the ACRR, it's combined
radiation environment for
survivability testing and so
we've gotten package the initial
conception.
design.
OK, ma'am, so is it safe, you
said the fuh fuel, um.
Is it safe? That's what you're
looking at?
Yes, Madam Chair, Representative
will be taking a look at the,
the fuel, how it's aged, and
whether it can continue to meet
its know yet we we have some
indications that behave
differently, but different
doesn't necessarily mean unsafe.
We need
Steinborg.
Thank you, ma'am, and thank you
all for coming today. It's
always uh special when you come
and brief with Jonathan and now
it's just really awesome to meet
your whole team and, and welcome
to the committee.
All of you and
Huge thank you to the work you
do, um, know that. I mean, this
is a committee we we love the
defense.
Nuclear Safety Board, if I got
that right, but your mission is
so important to protecting.
Um, people that work there, the
community.
Ultimately the mission
But, um, but in that order, I
mean, it's really about
protecting people and workers in
the community. So thank you for
what you do and
Um, I want to ask a few
questions and I hope you extend
to your leadership, Jonathan. I
mean it's just a huge thank you
all the way up and down the line
from the, from the committee. We
could write a letter, we can
make it official, but these guys
have enough work, so I will save
Tom that particular letter, but
please extend the appreciation,
um.
And on that note, I want to talk
about the future of the DNSFE,
but real quick on the safety
issues here in the state.
The um plutonium releases with
the radiological releases. I
don't want to mischaracterize
it, that we read about from time
to time in the Santa Fe paper
does a good job covering lannel.
Seems like there's continuing
issues, maybe there always are,
but we're just hearing about
them.
But
How do you, I mean, I, I noticed
in in your briefing you were
talking about the boxes, the
plutonium boxes, and looking at
site designs, seems like every
time they show a picture of that
box, it looks like something
built in a shop class. I, I'm
just always kind of like
perplexed by that. No offense,
forgive.
Hopefully, it's much more state
of the art than what's show in
the paper, but like, are you?
Tell us about your candid
feelings about the state of
safety as regards to handling of
plutonium and.
And then I guess, are we ahead
of the curve? Are we behind the
curve, considering the ramp up
the mission.
Sure. So, Madam Chair, Senator,
uh, on, on the issue of glove
box safety. So I will point out
the board did, we had a staff
team.
Uh, that investigated
investigation into the, you
know, the breach of the board
did issue a letter to the
department improving the, the
monitoring of the glove boxes,
so the glove boxes as they exist
today, they have a, a pressure
gauge that shows whether the
Fox is the appropriate pressure,
so these boxes are supposed to
be under negative pressure. So
if there's a breach, the idea is
the flow is inward away from the
worker, uh, these gauges are
passive. They're not always
necessarily in a convenient I'm
a tall individual so I can see
them, but some of the work, they
can't always see them as easily.
There's no active alarm, easily
alert the the glove box worker
that hey this this box is
falling out of specification. So
there's some improvement ideas
that the board captured in that
letter that our
along those lines. I will say
that, you know, you use the the
term uptick, uh, I don't know,
I'm not studied, I'm not
studying the data as much as I
used to when I was at Los
Alamos. I will say Los Alamos,
the number of operations has
increased and so it's likely
you'll see some more of these
breaches. The question really
is, are the workers doing the
right things when the breaches
are the systems doing everything
they can to help the workers and
so the systems we kind of
address that in, in response to
how are the workers doing?
I think we can ask Mr. Freeman
here or others, but I think
we've seen a trend of ups and
downs in terms of are the
workers taking the appropriate
steps? Do they check their
gloves before they come out of
the glove box? Are they
monitoring when they're required
to monitor or coming out of the
glove box, leaving the and
that's an area that over my 9
years at Los Alamos had ups and
downs. I have seen this current
workforce, the current
leadership team at Los Alamos
emphasized that it will be
something that Eric, David, and
and Jason just have them on. And
uh David, is that your name?
Eric Eric, Eric, Eric, is it OK
if I ask you a question?
It's a
Jonathan suggested I ask you a
question.
Yeah
But, um, since you're there,
what are, what are the issues
that um
I don't know that you'd want to
flag or like.
The most important safety issues
moving forward at the last
Certainly. So thank you for the
question and I would offer uh
Madam Chair and senator that
From what I've seen so far, I'm,
I'm certainly bringing my
previous life experiences to
bear into this new role and so
some of the things I'm most
interested.
In looking at or as the facility
undergoes major transitions. One
of the things that we always
look at. I have a
History and inspection. Are you
want to focus on when things
change, you want to focus on new
things. And with that in mind,
obviously the facility will be
undergoing some changes in the
coming months and years as it
goes from first production unit
forward and also as the mission
for Asian site also continues
forward.
So you heard from our colleagues
our um
Government counterparts earlier
today that uh in the future that
they are going to be looking at
remediating PI 9 and um that is
a significantly more hazardous.
Material to remediate than the
curr CMPs. So on some of the
slides you see here, workforce
is still relatively
inexperienced nuclear work,
that's something that we are
paying very close attention to,
that's the contractors on site
doing the work have the
appropriate training, experience
with that.
And then as on the um weapons
side of the house, one of the
things we're definitely
interested in focusing on is the
change in the tempo before as
that changes, what are some of
the things the, the pinch
points, if you will, that we
need to use in smooth
operations. So I would say those
are the two main issues right
now.
Cool. Um, thank you. Shipped
into um
Shifting to whip real quick. Do
you feel, Jonathan Ma chair the
ventilation issue.
Has been addressed
Madam Chair, Senator, I think
for the near term, the, the
approach GE is taking the
startup in that safe mode, um,
how long they can stay in that
mode is a question, right, that
there's some limitations on the
amount of mining and waste in
placement that can occur under
HEPA filter ventilation, uh, but
there, that is their commitment
to start up in filtered mode
while they complete the
additional work necessary to
really ensure that the safety
system. OK.
All right. Well, good work.
Yeah, keeping an eye on all
these things and
Just all the
collaboration you're doing to
try to figure out the best
practices and help bring those
into the labs and bring them
into these environments to help
get them where they need to be
and.
Kudos to Senator John Glenn. I
didn't realize he was there.
It's a, but God, what a, what a
great.
Right, um
Development.
Moving forward, I, I remember
cause I was on the committee,
you know, during the last
administration prior to
President Biden
There was an effort to silence
in a way, forgive me if I
misstate this, but
I think it's super important
that the committee knows this
because now we're
Getting some of those same
officials now in charge for a
federal government that
There was an effort to in a way,
I think some even recommended
doing away with the DNSFB.
Um, including, I think one of
the commissioners, maybe even
the chair of the commission.
There was an effort by the
Secretary of Energy. In fact,
they promulgated a policy to
force you.
I think it's important for
people to know this is an
independent agency created by
Congress.
Whose job it is is to review all
safety issues that these nuclear
facilities if
Defense facilities
And, and then they get a
published recommendations on
safety issues that go public
with them.
And then
Generally speaking, the labs
will accommodate most of these
recommendations. I mean, it's
And that is probably saved
lives.
So it's so crucial they have
independence and that they're
able to publish these things and
I think there was, there was an
order, maybe I'm using the wrong
term in the previous
administration to require that
these reports that they
published with the safety
findings that we just heard
about, several of them.
Would have to go through the
Department of Energy first
almost to be approved by them.
And we as a committee actually
raised a lot of issues in
But Senator Heinrich and Lujan,
I think that ultimately.
I think there was federal
legislation and amendments to
say they wouldn't fund that
order.
Super important
So moving forward.
I think, especially given the
increase of the nuclear
emission. It's so important that
we keep an eye on.
You know, our committee
Keep an eye on your agency.
That your independence be
maintained.
Your vigorous, robust funding
level, um.
And that uh you're, you know,
that you're not censored in any
way, shape or form.
Um
Be on the lookout based on past
history. So
Just wanted to say that. I think
you're, you're one of the most
important.
People that we hear from.
And probably the most, one of
the most.
important people that entities
and officials that no one knows
about.
But the work you're doing is so
bloody important and so thank
you and
We have your back and
We're allies and
I know all of us are here today,
so, anyway, good work, and
that's all I have on the chair.
Very much
Thank you.
And
Um
I second that, everything you
said it's great, um, we do have.
Thank you, ma'am
and thank you, Senator
Steinborn.
So that's more of an internal.
Are there any external monitors.
Detecting air or any kind.
outside
Madam Chair, Senator, um, just
to clarify, are you talking
about the what facility or other
facility just facilities in
general.
So, so there, there are, um,
there's a a range of different
Detection equipment, uh, the
focus of the board is, is
nuclear safety. So those are the
like typically the things that
are most close to the facility.
So if we take the glove box
example, there's a right like
the glove box is the safety
control. There's monitors near
the glove box. There's a monitor
in the ventilation system.
There's a monitor on the stack
before it gets released. Then on
the environmental side, uh the
folks at the laboratories and,
and different facilities have a
range of their own sets of
requirements to monitor for
those releases.
We focus on the ones um that are
closest to the hazard, and I
will say in nearly all cases, I,
I can't think of a case where
there is not some sort of
monitor. It's a release path of
the nuclear material. OK, thank
you.
Any
Thank you again, um.
We appreciate, you know, the
concerns that we have are yours
also and um we will continue to.
Uh, support
You, you're bored, uh, in any
way we can. So thank you very
much.
Good work.
Next we have um.
Cia Wheeler co-chair of 285
Alliance. We're going to be
discussing weapons grade
plutonium transport.
um, Don Hancock.
Oh
Yes, yes, because we have corn.
Would you excuse us to do bill
endorsements really quickly, um,
but we do have to come down to
that podium.
To do that.
Thank you, flexible, I hope, and
understanding.
We have 3 bills, um.
Let's see, the Green amendment
for the House and the Senate and
Senator, um, uh.
Pinto and I will be presenting.
We do need to go down there.
And we'll get copies of the bill
to.
There.
The floor is yours.
Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. Um,
what
OK.
Um
This is the Green amendment that
you've heard many times, many
years, um, this is um uh is
229121.1.
And how this is different um
from last year is that we have
um for the Green amendment to
have clean air, water, soil,
and.
Environment, um,
Protection for everyone in our
state, um.
We have added um uh flora and
Fawn uh description of the
environmental rights.
And servation of the natural
cultural scenic and healthful
qualities of the environment,
and this directs the state,
county serve as trustees of the
Natural Resources of New Mexico
and for the benefit of all the.
People.
So we have also um.
This section where um.
Have Article 20 section 21.
Being uh protected.
So that we exclude it from this
bill.
And so that's pretty much all of
the changes for this bill.
And
want to look in the Senate bill
and the House.
Go ahead. If you want to add in
it's the same, you don't need to
reexplain it.
Unless you want to add anything.
No, not really. I mean, well,
all right.
Committee. Any discussion?
The motion to endorse.
You have a second
Anybody opposed to that motion?
OK. Um, why don't we'll do them
individually. So that was on the
House Joint Resolution and then
anybody opposed to that?
Yeah, that goes into ours,
moving on to the Senate Joint
resolutions exactly the same.
I'm sorry, Mr. Chair, the one
she read was the Senate. They're
the same.
But the, the, as far as the
numbers on the bottom are
different.
OK.
And then, um
Is that motion?
Yeah, maybe we should do the
number, OK. So can we amend the
last
Ocean or or.
Yeah, amended to say, you know,
yeah.
So that.
229059.1.
All that good stuff. OK, that
work for you, Tom?
OK, cool. OK, so.
Uh, endorsed moving on to.
The Senate joint resolution.
0.229121.
Does everyone have that?
OK. Is your emotion.
Yes,
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Mr. Chairman, sorry, I
just walked in cause I was in
another meeting and I just
wanted to see, make sure I'm on
the same page on this on the
right bills here, so this one is
229.
121
one, yeah, and I'm sorry, I had
my eyes dilated and I'll never
do it again. I went to the to
the eye doctor and I'm not doing
real well.
I just deniability,
this is not good.
So, so please tell me you're
wage.
Yes, thank you.
Uh, joint resolution, that
number.
OK, yes, and, and I moved, Mr.
Chairman, I move a due.
OK.
OK with that? And you want to
second it?
Anybody opposed to that motion?
OK. That is endorsed.
rats. Thank you committee and
Mr. Chair.
Got it.
Does everyone have the bill?
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair and
committee.
Um, this is, um, house bill, um,
202 number is um 0.229128.
And this is um relating to the
environment, um, enacting the
per and polyfluorinate Phos.
A products restrictions Act, and
it prohibits certain products
that contain an intentionally
added per or polyflora alkalol
substance, uh, requiring
disclosure of information and
testing of products sold,
offered for sale or just.
Distributed for sale in this
state that contained an
intentionally added per poly.
And substance, providing
penalties. I'm gonna have to
practice that, um, making an
appropriation and um I will have
my expert.
Uh
Explained the bill.
Uh, Mr. Chair, members of the
committee.
Hi, my name's Tom Kirker. I'm
from Legislative council
Service, uh, just the
disclaimer. I'm here to provide
technical assistance. I do not
appear in support for opposition
to this bill.
Uh, so I'll just go through the
different sections pretty
quickly. Um, so it creates the
POS products, restrictions Act,
Section 2 provides some
definitions of some of the
products that are prohibited.
Um, and this is for, um,
products that contain
intentionally added PFOS, which
is kind of what it sounds like.
So it's deliberately added in
the manufacturing process to
produce some desired function of
the product.
Uh, section 3 requires the
manufacturer of a product that
contains intentionally added
PFOS to report information to
the Environment department.
Describing the product, what the
product is used for and the
amount of POS in the product.
And um it requires this
information, um, before 2028.
And then uh section 3 also um
prohibits
Manufacturing, selling, or
distributing product that
contains PFOS before that
information has been submitted.
Um, by 2028.
Section 4 has the list of
products that are prohibited.
Um
And this prohibition begins in
2027.
And it also has another
prohibition which starts in
2034.
And those are products that the
environment department has not
designated as an unavoidable
use.
So an unavoidable use.
Is defined as um a product that
contains PFOS that is essential
for health, safety, or the
functioning of society.
And for which alternatives are
not reasonably available.
So I think like a medical.
Uh
s for example.
Uh, section 5 allows the
environment department to
require testing if they suspect
is a product on the market that
has POS, they can require that
manufacturer to do tests.
Um, and medical devices and
drugs are exact.
Section 6 provides for rules.
Uh, so the Environment
Department is authorized to make
rules um about reporting the
amount of PFOS and also to
identify those currently
unavoidable uses.
Section 7 has a penalty for
violation of the act, and this
is going to be enforced by the
Attorney General.
And section 8.
Um, provides an appropriation
for the environment department.
That's about it.
I'd just like to add that.
This follows what many other
states are, um, adopting.
Um
And
to protect their citizens from
products and also that. Very
good.
That's it.
Anybody from the committee have
any questions or comments with
this,
Mr. Chairman, we are, I think
most of us, if not all of us are
familiar with this we've
discussed it not only in the
interim, but other years, um,
also, and so unless others have
any questions, I'm gonna move it
to pass.
I think um
Sure, that's fine.
Thank you, Chairman. Um, bravo
for this bill, um.
I've been learning more and more
about PFOs and how we probably
all of us in this room have some
with us.
Um, pretty dangerous stuff. I've
got a question about section 8
on the appropriation.
Um, Chairman and representative.
How did 100,000 be identified as
the appropriation.
And the reason I'm, I've got a
follow up question for that is.
Um
There doesn't seem to be any
language in there to adjust for
inflation as we
As the as the incoming years
come on.
Um, and I thought about this
because of some other
legislation that I've prepared
in the past. Does that make
sense?
Thank you, Chairman. Thank you,
Representative.
Um
Thank you, um, Mr. Chair and
Senator.
Um, for that question, the um
100,000 is to more than
accommodate what the um.
Uh,
attorney general's office would
need and um.
And that would also include, you
know, adjustments for inflation
and then um as years go on,
they, you know, could have.
Apply for more, just have it.
Chairman Representative, OK, so
thank you because um there was a
previous bill where
been locked in to a certain
amount, and that is for
penalties, uh, violators,
contaminate our lands and water
and etc. and.
We have to, we're having to go
through statute change because
it doesn't allow for.
Increases because of inflation
and like, so I'm glad that
that's been thought of.
Um
So you don't have to bring the
bill back.
for such an adjustment. Thank
you, Chairman. Thank you,
Representative.
OK.
Anybody else?
OK.
Rodriguez on the table for a due
pass. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Uh, most passed to endorse the
bill by Senator Rodriguez, a
second by Representative Serana.
Anybody opposed to that? OK.
Your bill is endorsed.
Mr. Chair and committee
We
I need to approve some minutes,
manager.
Sure do pass, Mr. Chairman on
the minutes.
I have had a set of minutes in
here to distribute to
I I think there were 2 sets for
2 meetings, so
we need to do you want me to do
them individually or can we do
them all at once?
Mr. Chair.
OK.
That's OK, so sorry.
OK, so we have two sets of
minutes in your folder that
we're going to vote on real
quick.
All right, so
Look in your folder we have.
One for September 13, 2024.
to look it over, otherwise
someone feel free to make a
motion.
I made sure, OK.
The Senator Rodriguez made a
motion seconded by the chair.
Anybody opposed to approval of
the September 13 minutes?
That approved, so the October 15
minutes, you want to look that
over.
OK, we have a motion to approve
the in by Senator Pente. We have
a second?
yes by the chair. Anybody
opposed to approval of the
minutes?
October 15th approved.
Thank you.
And I'd like to do something
before people start leaving, um,
we would just like tore.
Recognize, um, senator Nancy
Rodriguez is extreme.
Help, um, and participation
coming across state many times
to help us get quorum and even
when we're in Santa Fe, be sure
to be here, I'm blinded by the
light, but.
Um, so with that, I just like to
thank her so much and um
throughout the years that you've
chaired and then I've chaired
and um so we just have a little
something. Oh, come on you
again. Oh my goodness.
I got
Uh
Thank you, Senator.
Sure
You have been above and beyond.
With your service all these
years and we're really gonna
miss you.
Wow.
All right. Congrats.
Oh, it's beautiful. It's called
the.
It's called a boomerang bowl,
and so we hope you come back to.
You can't it.
OK, you may want to, but it's
not.
Yeah
Thank you, Senator, I just want
to say cause people in the
audience may not know, but
Senator Rodriguez, Scott, how
long have you been in the
legislature?
29 years and this may be your
last committee, one of your last
committee meetings.
Have LFC next week and then in
December other than, oh, and
science and technology, I still
have,
yeah, this is the last the last
one of this one, yeah, and then
Senator McKenna, this is also
her last one, and I, I can, I
can tell you all.
You know, having served in the
house, but in the Senate.
You know
Senator Rodriguez really is.
And has been one of the
Biggest champions of
The things that maybe the
environmental issues that maybe
no one paid attention to or
didn't care, but she cared, and
she fought to make sure that the
legislature cared and that the
finance committee chair, she's a
longtime vice chair of the
Senate Finance Committee, the
Budget Committee, and she really
was the voice for the
environment on on that committee
and um at a time when the
commit, you know, the
environment was kind of a
Uh
Not always a priority, let's put
it that way. And so, but both of
you are serving with you,
Senator McKenna in the Senate,
um, two great champions that are
leaving the legislature, but
Thank you all.
You really words can't say
enough. I appreciate.
Thank you, Senator McKenna too.
I appreciate it very much.
Thank you. OK. Representative
Serena has.
Um
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. Um,
I'm here with Colin Cox from the
Center of Biological Diver
Diversity, um, to the oil and
gas, oil and gas children's
health program it's uh HB the
202 number is 228818.1, OK.
This bill modifies the Oil and
Gas Act to add setbacks from
schools. The setback area is
officially called the Children's
Health Protection Zone.
Which is an area extending 1
mile or 5000 line of a school.
School means elementary, middle,
junior high, high school, public
charter private schools, the
students attend in person,
including daycare centers,
parks, playgrounds, or sports
and recreation facilities
associated with, um, the other
definition we have is operator,
a person with a legal right to
conduct oil. So the bill.
Restricts any new oil and gas
operation in the Children's
Health Protection zone.
The bill requires requires the
oil and gas operators located in
the Children's Health protection
zone.
To create a protection zone,
inventory, and map.
To develop and implement leak, a
leak response and detection
plan.
And to develop and implement
alarm response protocol and
conduct water quality sampling
and.
Our, our kids are important
though um industry must do to
keep them safe.
Um, we're adding a new section
to the air quality control Act,
we will suspend oil and gas
operations in the children's
Health protection zone that are
in violation of the air Quality
Control Act until compliance and
we have penalties and why we're
doing this, Colin will take.
I'm Colin Cox of the Center for
Biological Diversity. This
presentation in Hobbs earlier,
um, but then this bill is
necessary because right now in
New Mexico, about 34,000 school
children attend school within 1
mile of oil and gas wells.
And
And this is, you know, in the
San Juan and Permian Basins
talking about less than 100
schools, um, have as many as 161
wells within 1 mile.
Um, that's Jefferson Elementary
in Hobbs.
Um
So that's about 848 wells, about
1% of active oil and gas wells
in the state are affecting.
More than 11%. I mean, and why
this is a problem is that oil
and gas production releases a
lot of pollution and, and here
we're focused on air hundreds of
different air pollutants, um,
don't have time to name them
all.
Um
And there's a lot of a large and
growing body of research, more
than 50 epidemiological studies
showing that living and spending
a lot of time within
You know, in a close proximity
to oil and gas wells is, is
associated with a range.
Of health problems, you know,
just.
Childhood cancer.
Asthma, birth defects, preterm
births, high-risk pregnancies.
Low birth weight in babies,
higher hospitalization rates,
upper respiratory problems,
rashes.
Um
Children are and that's, that's
children and adults. Children
are particularly susceptible to
a lot to many of these air
pollutants, these air tire rates
of respiratory disease, uh,
asthma, neurodevelopmental
disorder, and pediatric cancers,
um.
And there's evidence of these
increased effects within 1 mile,
2 miles, 3 miles, 4 miles of
wells. Um, I've got a health
science summary um that I passed
around to committee members and
um it goes over some of these
for compiling a new one right
now with some of the new 2024
studies that corroborate this,
and these are from studies
across the countryhoma,
California, Colorado,
Pennsylvania.
Um, they find health problems
really the need for this bill,
um, is that well these 34,000
schoolchildren are going to
public school while they're in
the state's care, and they don't
have a choice but to be there.
Um, they're being exposed to
toxic air pollution from oil and
gas production.
Um, so we're proposing just
moving that production further
back from the schools.
The bill would not shut down the
existing wells that are within
this zone, but it would prevent
new wells, uh, within the zone,
within 1 mile of public schools.
I won't completely eliminate the
risk of the health problems that
I'm talking about, but it will
reduce them significantly.
Um,
Provision in the
In the ban on new wells for an
administrative process, so
companies could apply for a
variance if they have, you know,
a property right, but really,
and they should be able to reach
the oil with horizontal drilling
anyway, these aren't huge zones.
We're talking about, you know,
less than 100 structures, um,
public schools that this is
around.
Um, and now it's really about
protecting kids from. And I'll
just I'll add one more thing,
um, the EPA recently did an
inspection of of wells and 60%
of them were polluting. When we
have the, the numbers are always
changing, but close to 70,000
wells out there, 60% is 42,000
whales polluting. So obviously
we need something to help our
kids because right now
that I um that that that study
100% of them.
are polluting and they found
that more than 60% were
violating their pollution
limits. We're actually polluting
beyond their legal limits, even
the goodwills once following the
law, releasing toxic air
pollution and exposing people to
increased risk of disease, but
we've got a real compliance
problem also in New Mexico, 60%
aren't even following the laws
that we already have.
Yes, Senator Rodriguez, thank
you, Mr. Madam Chairman, and Mr.
Chairman, co-chairs. Um, we have
heard this discussion, we heard
it at the LFC, I think
legislative Finance Committee
and and um you know, the
information being submitted here
by Representative Saana it's,
it's just very, um, it was just
appalling.
actual
Because you actually went there.
I didn't get to go to that
particular walkthrough and tour
that you gave, but I did see all
the facts, the information
submitted, and it's very
credible information.
At the same time, I think we
need to take it serious, that
this is something that is very
far reaching for children and
families, and we need to take a,
we need to bite the bullet and
do something to try and curtail
and and hopefully some days stop
all this uh.
Contamination altogether, but um
I, I think I, you know, it's a,
it's a good.
Way to do it. I fully support
this and um if there are no
other questions, I don't want to
jump ahead of anybody, but if,
if there I can make a motion for
a due pass or discussion, and
then if you want me to pull that
back.
I will for some more discussion.
Um
Uh, Senator, we do have 2
questions. Senator.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative.
Um
Thank you for
Be a champion for this bill.
Long overdue
You mentioned um the schools in
Hobbs.
How they're being affected, is
there, for instance, the
Department of Health, or is
there another agency within the
state that's capturing.
What
Health providers have observed
with kids and their families.
Um, Madam Chair, thank you for
the question, Senator. Yes,
there is a uh a company called
Synchronous, and they have a
database that we have been
working.
Um
Director Seli and LFC has been
working to get the information
and finally, he said we've
broken through, looks like they
will give us the information.
It's information from all the
hospitals and clinics around the
state and I, they invited me to
the rollout and I saw it it the
the dad is there and it also
showed the cost to the state,
you know, it's, it's a big, it's
coming, Madam Chair, thank you,
representatives, because I, I
think.
Those of us in this room and
those on webcast would really be
interested to see.
What kids and their families,
probably even write their
livestock.
And their pets.
How they're being affected by
this pollution. So thank you,
way to go.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, any other questions?
I just had one,
Would this also prevent a school
from.
Uh, locating a new school, as a.
District superintendent and the
the school district from placing
a school within 1 mile of an
existing.
Oil, uh, facility.
I don't believe so, Madam Chair.
OK.
I guess we'll just have to um
rely on their common sense that
we have this bill not to have
one within.
Are there is there a motion for
the.
Oh, that's right, I'm sorry,
senator, um, is there a second?
We have a motion in the 2nd for
adopt for endorsing um house
built.
0.228818.1.
Are there any objections?
Seeing none,
You have your endorsement. Thank
you.
OK, now that we're caught up on
the.
business of the committee and um
we're still a little bit ahead
of time for the weapons grade
plutonium transport
presentation.
Um, Mr. Don Hancock, your
director, nuclear waste safety
program and administrator of the
Southwest Research and
Information Center.
Cynthia Wheeler, um, your
co-chair of 285 Alliance.
So if you'll go ahead, thank
you.
Thank you for your interest
in the public safety about the
transport of nuclear waste.
Yeah.
That's that's OK. You do such
good work and I have to
apologize because my statement
may differ from what you have in
front of you and it's not Tom's
fault, it's my fault because I'm
always feel really privileged
whenever I can speak redoing
things like at the last minute,
so.
Um,
I have added in notes and
they're updated on the last page
so you can verify facts and I uh
sent just click on them.
Um, these comments are broader
than the more technical ones
presented today. I was a little
worried because I thought this
is such a.
Uh, a 10,000 ft view and then
Uh, Senator Pinto's comment
about the periodic table and I
just, I got goosebumps because I
love the periodic table and
because of what it tells us
about the universe.
So I thought maybe some get way
up above things and and not so
technical, so let me with
apologies, let me start with
this.
Plutonium 239 is the main weapon
and, and let's just call it what
it is.
And produce this stuff.
Humans did
It's only existed since 1940 and
there's a lot with the
environment.
If we're gonna make sound policy
at risk.
We have to know all we can.
Plutonium's deadly in many ways,
it's a heavy metal. It can
spontaneously burst into fire
when it's in the air.
Just placing too much in one
place creates a spontane which
almost happened at Lane a few
years ago, and it's very
radioactive.
The kind of radiation it
produces can't penetrate the
skin, although I, I wouldn't
recommend it.
But when it gets and how it gets
inside is important.
If you ingest it, it can go
through your digestive system
and out, again, I wouldn't
recommend.
But when it's inhaled, it enters
or enters through a wound. It
gets in the body and it doesn't
let go.
And I'll come back to that in so
plutonium is a threat when it's
used to detonate bombs, but it's
also a threat for those along
the route when it's being moved.
None of us thinks every
transport will end in disaster,
but we're adults and we know
that over time, distance, and
many transports and accident
becomes an inevitability and for
the community where that
happens, it will be devastating
and permanent.
If New Mexico allows the
Department of Energy to start
new missions for with.
The next 60 years at least will
see shipments increase many
times over. Next slide, I guess
it's not the power.
So this element is is
essentially new to Earth. I, I
hope this completely amazes you.
Um, the subjects that I taught
for 25 years, astronomy and
chemistry tell us that all
natural elements are made in
stars as they die. Everything in
your body, everything elements
that were first formed in stars.
All except the ones that make
nuclear waste.
They're man-made and recent.
Plutoniums only existed 80
years. Natural elements have
existed on its billion years.
Life grew up with those natural
elements and needs them to
survive.
But we're still working out the
bugs with lu buy a new model car
the first year it came out on
the market. You have to wait and
see what kind of problems, um,
will need to be fixed when
something is new, you don't know
which concept you have to learn
what it can and can't do
piecemeal and by trial and
error.
So I want to clarify some common
um
Some common, uh, sorry, where am
I some common misunderstandings
by looking at 4 facts about
plutonium through the lens of
common sense.
It makes it easier to choose
transportation policies that are
safe, and I would say next
slide, but I guess we're not
there.
Fact one, plutonium being new
has unique properties with risks
properties have already heavily
damaged the environment and
transporting them adds to the
risk. Common sense tells us that
some 24 years hasn't taught us
everything we need to know about
how to do it safely.
CEO treats nuclear waste
transport as if all its risks
are known. They aren't.
And fact too plutonium lasts
half a million years.
The whip repository promises to
dispose of it safely for 10,000
common sense tells us des.
Neither can nuclear physicists
or engineers, and they know it.
Whip is a 10,000 year
experiment, that's why it's
called a pilot plant in 80 years
we've made way over 100 tons of
plutonium and we still have the
first it'll take 480,000 years
before all of it's gone, and
even if Whip could safely hold
that was for 10,000 years.
No one's even thought about what
to do with it for the remaining
470,000 years.
The last plutonium to decay will
be as deadly as it was on the
day it was made, and we keep
making more of this deadly thing
that we don't know our solution
to this half million year
problem is to unforgivably pass
it on so that our problem
becomes someone else's DOE has
the world embarking on an
experiment that we won't know
the answer to.
Ever.
Fact 3 transuranic or true waste
is not low level waste.
Some countries consider
plutonium high-level waste,
none, including the US, consider
it low level waste.
The US calls plutonium high
level when it's made in nuclear
reactors, but transuranic or
true when it's made for weapons,
common sense tells us that
plutonium atoms are plutonium
atoms.
They aren't magically less
dangerous because the US
classifies them as transuranic
or true.
Whether as bomb triggers or fuel
rods in nuclear reactors, the
radioactivity and heat are the
same for all atoms of plutonium.
Plutonium from both sources has
to be dispositories, which tells
you how dangerous both are. Only
the US uses the innocuous
sounding category true or
transuranic for weapons waste
mixed with contaminated
materials. This confuses instead
of clarifies and it leads the
public and policy makers like
yourselves to think it's safer
than it is.
Powder, this is the last fact,
powdered plutonium when inhaled
causes cancer 100% of the time.
This is from the Nobel Prize
winning physicians for the
prevention of nuclear war.
Inhale powdered plutonium.
Isn't exhaled
But lodges in the lungs.
And keeps on irradiating tens of
thousands of nearby cells for
decades. DOE is transporting it
past unsuspecting communities
that have limited emergency. So
plutoniums inhales.
And that happens in explosions
like the one in Whip, traffic
accident fires, um, forest fires
or when it's purposefully
powdered at lannel, which it
will be if they decide to accept
surplus. One of DOE's new
missions is to ship 26 tons of
plutonium pits from pantex to
lannel, so it can be powdered
and then ship it go communities
twice.
I had had on the PowerPoint
given you the maps showing these
neighborhoods and I'd be happy
to send them um later to make
sure that you have them.
Um
Northern New Mexican routes
include 5 pueblos and their
farmlands.
More than 60 neighborhoods in
and around Santa Fe.
And 25 neighborhoods along
Highway 285.
The southern New Mexico
communities will mostly become
major shipping lanes from the
waste of the 2nd DOE new mission
plutonium pit production, so
Dexter Artesia, Roswell, Klein's
Corners, Vaughan.
Both missions will affect the
northern route. Once it's
shipped back to Panix, it will,
will, um, cross the country to
South Carolina and then back
again to whip.
That's a lot of property and
lives. This is playing Russian
roulette with people who don't
know their um DOE knows these
facts. It doesn't want us to
know them because we just and
and see how dangerous this
mission is. Um, not only does
the public need to be educated,
but first responders, a former
fire chief flatly stated that he
learned about the when he heard
it from me as a community
presentation.
He should be hearing it from
DOE. So, the facts tell us what
the problems are. Common sense
tells us how to use them.
And some sound policy which
would be to limit its transport.
Informed communities being put
at risk about the risk.
And have robust emergency
procedures in place. Of course,
something that is not my
decision or yours is.
To also stop making more.
We recommend that DOE complete
its mission and closed.
And clothes. It hasn't finished
the one mission it was given
when Whip opened, which was to
dispose of waste from.
And even though a whip isn't an
adequate repository this old
waste will be safer there.
Than where it is.
Um, some sits in drums and
canvas tents at lannel in a
forest where wildfires have
almost times in recent years. If
that happens, it would vaporize
the plutonium, blanket northern
New Mexico, make it
uninhabitable.
Forever like Fukushima, Japan.
No new way should be put in
whip, and Don Hancock will talk
about that new waste violates
with DOE and increases all the
risks common to avoid.
Um
I am able to uh make suggestions
m might take his actions.
Thank,
you, Madam Chair and members of
the committee. I'm Don Hancock,
as you said, from Southwest
Research and Information Center
in Albuquerque. I've appeared
before you several times, and I
want to follow up on some of the
things that you, um, addressed
earlier today, um, and thank you
for doing that. Thank you as the
committee for addressing,
looking at very difficult issues
that um as as Wheeler just said,
Sometimes people either don't
know about or don't necessarily
want to hear about.
Um
So we, we can go to the next
slide, please.
Now it's working. I, I want, I
want to um
There was a mention,
particularly with Ms. Trujillo,
there was discussion about the,
the new whip permit that was
approved last year in 2023, a
little over 16 months ago. Uh, I
always like to remind people
that that permit and the
provisions we're gonna be
talking about today were agreed
to.
By everybody who participated in
those negotiations, and I list
them on the slide, includes the
Department of Energy itself, the
Simco, the contractor at WIP,
the Carlsbad Department of
Development, which is definitely
uh supportive of, of WIP and
then a number of community
groups and one individual and
you can see my organization was
one of those who participated in
that process, which is among the
reasons why I think I'm pretty
knowledgeable to talk about some
of the provisions that we'll be
talking about today.
day
Next slide, just a quick
reminder about WIP's mission.
Um, the Department of Energy has
gotten very fixated on the
number, the volume amount.
Congress didn't say you have to
put exactly that amount of waste
in. It said up to. Congress
always knew.
That there was more transuranic
waste than what would fit into
whip.
So, um, that's a very important
point. Um.
DOE originally said, in fact,
they're sworn testimony in 1999
at the original whip permit was
that the total whip capacity
would fit in 8 panels and would
be there in 25 years, which
would be 2024.
They've now decided that oops,
we made a mistake, um, and we
want to keep WIP open for
decades longer, um, from our
perspective, uh, that's why we
say stop forever because that's,
uh, in our view, kind of what
they're planning to do.
Uh, the next slide, please.
Let's go on to, yeah, OK, thank
you. Um,
So again, um, Ms. Wheeler just
talked about the transportation
issues to remind you of the 6
major sites.
That sand ways to whip or have
sent waste to whip and except
for one case, uh, I plan to send
waste in the future. There are
the 4 sites in the West uh that
are uh in yellow squares, uh,
rocky flats in Colorado, which
is now sent all of its waste to
Whip, so it will not be sending
any more, but the Idaho National
Lab in Hanford and Los Alamos,
as people know, and then two
major sites in the Southeast,
Savannah Riverside and Oak.
Bridge in Tennessee.
So next slide, um,
So going on to key provisions
of, of the permit. These are 3
new provisions that had not
before been in the whip pyramid,
They came about because of a lot
of concerns, some expressed by
some of you all as members of
the legislature expressed by a
lot of members of the public,
and to the environment
department's credit, they said,
yeah, these are important.
Because as we've discussed, is
not meeting its mission, is not
being able to be closed up on
time. There's a need to a new
need to get the Department of
Energy focused on what they can
and cannot do at whip.
Um, and so these 3 new
provisions, there's a priority
for disposal of Cold War legacy
waste and all sites but
specifically at Los Alamos. I'm
gonna come back to that, uh,
that was mentioned again by Mr.
Trujillo earlier.
Second,
uh, which I will be talking more
about the legacy waste disposal
plan, and you all had some
conversations about that with
Ms. Trujillo. The requirement
there is that Department of
Energy needs to
Define and if they want.
The Mexico Environment
Department needs to define what
is legacy waste, and that is the
priority. That's the waste that
should be going in first, and
insofar as then there's other
waste that isn't legacy waste
that.
Needs to be discussed, but the
priority is to get all of this
legacy waste into whip as soon
as possible. And thirdly, uh
provision again that was
mentioned earlier. Um, the
Department of Energy, when I and
other people have asked them for
several years, what's the plan
for another repository in
addition to the pilot plant in
New Mexico, the answer is we
have no plans.
Very top level people in DOE
said this publicly.
And many occasions. So what
people in New Mexico say and
what's in the pyramit is that's
not OK.
Every year from now on, you have
to do a written report.
That will be coming out. This is
Coming event by December 31st,
so in the next six weeks, DOE is
required to put out this report
and I'll have to update it every
year annually of what their
progress actually is making.
OK, next slide. Let's talk
specifically about legacy waste.
Uh, unfortunately, I'm a numbers
guy, so I always like to include
numbers. So if you look at the
the the slide shows how much up
to now from 1999 up to now. You
can see 52.4% of all the waste
that's come to whip is from?
I don't know
The next most is from the
Savannah River site in South
Carolina. The next most is from
the now closed Rocky Flats plant
in Colorado, 14.6 and 14.7.
So, if, you know, quick uh
addition, that's more than 80%.
has come from other places.
Where is Lane? Lane has had 10%
up to now. Hanford 5, Oak Ridge
2, and some other sites, less
than 2% cumulatively.
Unfortunately, um, what we, one
of the things we were trying to
do in the environment
department's trying to do in the
permit is to say, OK, you got a
really prioritize this legacy
waste. Well, the next slide
shows in the last 16 months
since DOE agreed in the permit
to prioritize waste, uh,
including from lan and in New
Mexico, you can see 85.4% of the
waste in the last 16 months is
from Idaho.
So I think common sense tells
you.
Regardless of what they say and
regardless of what you heard
today, this morning from Ms.
Kunkel from Los Alamos. Their
actions do not show.
Atlanta is a priority. It shows
that Idaho has been the
priority. Lanel in the last 16
months is 66% of the waste to
whip, even less than what it's
historically uh done.
So then that gets us to the
plan. They, they need to
So talk in detail about what
they're going to do. Well, the
next slide is my conclusion, uh,
and lots of other people's
conclusion is the plan that DOE
submitted is unacceptable. Um, I
I think lots of people will be
saying that in the next uh few
weeks.
Um, I want to focus on 3
particular types of non-legacy
waste that shouldn't be coming
to Whip, that WIP was not for
that under the plan they want to
bring. First is that down
blended surplus plutonium.
You've heard about that from
several speakers and as Wheeler
talked about that.
Secondly, they themselves say in
the plan that they want to
submit, send non-legacy
plutonium pit production.
Ways to whip. So even though
they themselves admit it's
non-legay waste, they still want
to be able to ship it.
Um, and, uh, so these things are
not OK.
So
The legacy waste plan should
have said that all of the legacy
waste will fit into the existing
permitted facilities at Whip.
Panel 8 that they're using now,
panels 10 and 11 that they plan
to use in the future. It doesn't
say that. In fact, the legacy
plan states that legacy waste
will be disposed. That's words
will be disposed in future. So
that's also very likely to
include Los Alamos waste, so
rather than um focusing on Los
Alamos waste, they're not doing
it.
Next slide
Uh
We don't have slides. OK, well,
you can, you can see if you're,
if you're looking at the um the
handout, if you go to slide 10,
new pits. I mentioned that
Department of Energy wants to
produce 4000 new plutonium pits
over the next 60 years creates
waste.
Importantly,
The number at the bottom of that
slide, DOE has now admitted that
25% of the total volume of all
the waste.
That they want to put in web
would be from these new pits
that don't even yet exist.
The pits that are supposed to be
manufactured over the next 60
years. That's not what we're
slide 11, surplus plutonium,
we've talked about that is uh
Wheeler talked about uh how a
lot of that would be from Panex
to Los Alamos to Savannah River
tohip
number very important for you
to, again, understand 41% of all
Of the radioactivity that DOE
wants to put in WIP would be
from the surplus plutonium.
OK. So it's a huge issue. And
then thirdly, and this is pretty
shocking as well. Um, whip by
law.
is only for transuranic waste.
Um, 25 years ago, not long after
WIP opened, DOE started floating
the idea of sending some of the
high-level waste.
From Hanford specifically, but
from making nuclear bombs,
making plutonium and uranium,
highly enriched uranium for
nuclear bombs, would come to
whip. Citizens of New Mexico
said no to that. The Environment
department said no to that. And
in fact, for 20 years, since
2004, the pyramid have said that
kind of waste is excluded. Guess
what's in the plan.
The explicitly says this is
legacy waste that we want to
send to whip.
So that's yet another uh
inadequacy of the plan that
can't be accepted.
So slide 13, um, other
repositories I've talked about
this before. Uh, I've mentioned
already by the end of the year,
they have to submit the first
annual report. I will and I will
be looking at it. I will
encourage people, members of the
committee to take a look at it
to see how they're doing. OK, so
finally, quickly,
We've been asking the public, I
made these requests two months
ago, uh, at the committee
hearing in Hobbs, unfortunately,
DOE is still not responding, but
that's no need not to reiterate,
DOE needs to fully comply with
these conditions of the permit.
They agreed to them. They should
comply with them, not just say
they'll comply with them, but in
fact,
They need to provide a
comprehensive description of
what they actually want to put
into whip long term.
Let people know. So as Ms.
Wheeler says, we're not.
Here, we're not hearing about
things from citizens, they
should, we should be hearing
about them from DOE. DOE should
be explaining them and defending
them. They need to cooperate
with the state of New Mexico on
a public engagement plan.
Slide 15.
We also need the state. And
that's not just the environment
department, but you folks in the
legislature and other people to
also keep reminding DOE that we
expect them to uh
Comply with the permit
provisions that there needs to
be this very robust public
engagement program.
The we needs to do it, but the
state needs to be involved with
it as well.
And it needs to be discussing on
a regular basis how they're
doing.
With actually implementing once
we have an approved uh legacy
plan, how they're doing with it,
because again, they will say one
thing and do something
different. And then also the
state needs to be providing
regular updates to the citizens
about
This um uh annual repository
report, because it's very
important to the people of New
Mexico that
Regardless of what DOE is saying
now, the state of New Mexico is
going to say, no, it's not all
coming to whip, you need no need
to have another repository, but
if there is no other repository,
there's no other place for it to
go. Thank you.
I appreciate you all's interest,
continuing interest in expansion
and these uh safety issues uh
we're both glad to answer
questions that you.
Thank you, um, Senator
Rodriguez.
Sorry, I misunderstood. Oh, no,
I had just indicated about the
quorum on the last intend to
intently listening. Thank you.
OK, thank you. um, Senator
Steinborn.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you both. Um, question for you,
Dawn.
The um
So these other forms of waste
that they want to.
Redefined
Legacy waste.
Um
The original contract with the
federal government on is it
define
Me
The type of waste in a kind of a
legal way, whereas what they're
trying to do now is in violation
legally speaking.
With the original definition of
a waste that was.
So, if you look at the legacy
plan, the Department of Energy
argues strenuously that they're
But no, they're there, there's
not a statutory definition. Uh,
unfortunately, I've been around
so long that I was an active
participant in the 6 years of
discussions that Congress had
testifying before Congress
numerous times about the land
withdrawal Act. At the time,
remember, what happened in 1989.
Rocky flats was shut down, so
there was going to be no new,
there was no ability to produce
new plutonium.
In 1989 also, the was declared
the end of the Cold War. Some of
us were around then, the Berlin
Wall fell, um, Soviet Union was
dissolved, so the Cold War was
over. So Congress knew all that
when they passed the land
withdrawal Act in 1992. They
knew that DOE had already agreed
that not all the waste would go
into whip, so in retrospect, we
should have put some additional
language in.
That to make it explicit, but
what everybody understood, and
we have lots of congressional
discussion about the fact that
WIP is the first of several and
there will be other ways that
can't fit into WIP, etc. So
where we're going here and one
of the important points about
having a date.
For legacy waste now that the
state can have.
Since DOE doesn't want to have
it no later than 1999, then the
state can say, OK,
That New Mexico and all the
other sites where you're gonna
focus on putting pre 1999 was
into whip.
Everything else, guess what?
You're working on another
repository. Guess what that
other repository can be for.
waste that was not supposed to
go to whip. So the state, I'm
sorry for the long answer,
Senator. This, the state is
gonna need to push the point,
but you can. One of the, one of
the not um one of the secrets
that's not really a secret that
DOE doesn't like to talk about
the state of New Mexico and the
Environment Department has the
authority to shut down whip any
time.
Has to be for cause. There has
to be reasons for it, but the
state of New Mexico can say, OK,
this is what you've got to do,
and if you don't do it, hm.
No more.
Thank you. Um, not sure I
understand what I was asking,
but.
But I'm sure it was there. It's
just been a long day.
And I'm, I'm sorry that's OK. So
it sounds like not necessarily
is the answer, like.
It wasn't
They gave themselves enough
wiggle room it was ambiguous
enough that, but, but there's
that cutoff date and you feel
like that the state, the state
now can put requirements in and
as I say, right.
Under
Both federal law and state law,
the state has the authority to
require closure of the whip
facility for a cause. One of the
causes, in my view, should be if
they want to say they're gonna
be putting a lot of non-legay
waste and a whip that shouldn't
be going. The state can say no,
you can't do that.
Let me ask you this, Don, Madam
Chair, um, the, the permit
renewal that the state just did.
That that that.
Specified what was to go in
panel 12.
Was that
it, it uh it says that to the
extent practicable, DOE wanted
to insist on that language, but
yes, panel 12 is reserved.
Word in the permit is reserved
for legacy waste.
That's why it's important to
know what it is and what it
isn't. So that when DOE wants to
in fact, which they'll try to
do, but non-legay waste into
panel 12 that
Then would be a violation of the
permit.
Thank you.
I am.
Thank you
for your presentation.
So when we talk about public
engagement at this moment 0
public. Well,
Keep going.
I'm just I don't think from our
end.
Action taken as far as I know
we've written letters.
Oh
And I don't remember who they
were addressed to.
Um
That we
Encouraging
That kind of thing.
Good
This is new for us.
This particular
So I'm that because this is the
last meeting.
Great.
But it seems like that that
they're.
that
To DOE
advice
Um.
So the.
The New Mexico Environment
Department did a great job in
working on the permit.
And part of that great job is
all the NGOs that were there
making sure that these things
happened. One of the things that
um they they.
Insisted on was that the DOE
have community meetings. I think
4 a year, 3 a year.
And they're doing that, they
don't get a whole lot of people
out, primarily the people who
are learning about this are
learning about it from
volunteers like me, which is
not, not ideal. They should be
hearing about it from DOE.
And yet DOE's not doing enough
to make that happen.
Um, and you're, you know,
you're.
Committee has a great ability to
do something here, I think,
because you, your voices are
important, and you can talk to
enemy D and and encourage them
to be following up on this stuff
because we're pedaling as fast
as we can, we meet with DOE,
certain DOE people um that are
local at in Carlsbad once a
month. I mean, we're doing
everything we can, but we need
people who will back us.
up if they can, and say, hey,
are you know NMED are you.
Because we do not have quorum,
um, we couldn't pass MIDI
So you don't mind drafting that
and then we would personalize
it.
Is that right? Is that what
you're asking?
So, Madam Chair, yes, I'm glad
to help with that. Just
logistical matter, how is the
best way when we have a draft
out to each of you individually,
to Tom, I, I'm just trying to
mechanically understand what,
what's the best.
So the best, uh, yes, go ahead.
It's probably best. I mean, I
think it's pretty simple letter
if, if, um, in staff draft a
little letter.
If a member wants it.
You know, I think that's
probably the best thing.
Otherwise, you could certainly
work with anybody on anything.
You know, but, um, well it
can't.
Because we don't have a corn to
endorse it, but.
You could do it individually,
and I, I don't want to speak for
Tom or you, but that might be my
suggestion.
OK, let's I mean it could be a
simple letter.
You we just urging.
You know,
public meetings on this.
And then, uh, Tom can share that
with the committee members and
then they can do with it as they
wish.
OK
Madam Chairman, um, I think, um,
not long ago we saw a letter, I
think it had to do with the last
radioactive and hazardous
materials Committee meeting we
had, um, um, drafted a very nice
letter and then sent it out to
us to each one of us to see who
would want to sign off to that
one letter like instead of
individual letters yeah, is that
what you were talking about just
doing like one whole letter with
signatures depending on who
wanted to sign on to it or to
have one individual letter per
legislator of this committee,
just wanted to make sure I
understand, as I recall we voted
on that letter, so that was
something that we did as a group
and signed on. I would have to
be different because we didn't
have enough votes to vote here
today. I get it. Thank you.
OK, no, no other questions.
Thank you very much for this
information, um, I'd just like
to add that um.
Yes, we need to um have um
people attend or go to those
meetings and make public um.
Through the differently.
But also to make sure that.
NMED with our letter of
encouragement to DOE.
will get people to go.
So thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you
So, um, we had 7 members present
today, but, um, since everyone
wasn't here at one time, uh, we
don't have a quorum and all
motions that we made today, um,
have to be rescinded.
So I apologize we tried very
hard to get other people that
might be able to be here.
So, um, I appreciate the
discussion on the bills that um.
Hopefully we can get
endorsements from other
committees that might be meeting
in the near future.
So, um, with that.
I think we are
Caught up and we should do
public comment.
We are a little early for public
comment, but not a whole lot,
um, is there anyone on online?
Yes, um, if you are online and
would like to make public
comment, please raise your.
And while here is doing that, is
there anyone here that has, do
you wanna go ahead and come up
while we, oh, Sis getting the
list. I'm sorry.
I know, because I need to thank
the Sierra Club for providing
lunch for us. That's why it was.
Sorry, Sara.
Um
So
Yes, um, do you want to go
ahead, Miss Earns? Yes, um,
thank you, Madam Chair.
I, I would just like to tell my
story about how many hours I
have spent in legislative rooms
like this.
Since 1988 when I first got
involved, um.
About my concerns about whip and
we co-founded Concerned Citizens
for Nuclear Safety here in Santa
Fe.
I can't tell you how many DOE
officials and contractors that
spoke and said,
We're gonna clean up all of the
transuranic waste throughout the
entire DOE complex.
In the next 25 years, and then
we're gonna close whip, and at
the time it seemed like an
impossible task.
But over the years as they were
making progress,
It seemed like it was something
that they could accomplish. Of
course, there were problems with
them shipping Dan drums, there
were problems with um
over
over the years and then whip
blew up and it was um a whole, a
whole different environment that
we were in.
The
The level of abuse that's going
on right now with DOE not
fulfilling what it's.
Promise number one.
How it's manipulating.
The promises that it made to the
people of New Mexico and the
state of New Mexico.
I, I don't have a word to
describe it. I have
heartbreaking. I have.
Words that um.
Being a bad guest, it, it just,
it just keeps compounding and
now with this new legacy waste
disposal plan and
How they they.
Put things in of what they want
that they didn't agree to so the
um
The states
Ability
To take the power that it has
and because if they're able to
keep whip open for another 50
there's a whole set of other
issues.
That raises a huge.
Um, besides the transportation,
a huge number of other issues.
So, um, your support in terms of
um the letter in terms of put
down is, is really important.
Collectively that for that.
Thank you.
Sophia
OK. Thank you. And if you could
keep it to 2 minutes, 3 being
here and listening to this
issues, uh, that's your job too,
so I guess, uh, thanks and um.
And again, um making sure that
you know that that's your job,
right? Uh, my name is Sophia
Martinez. I'm co-coordinator of
Los Jardinas Institute. I'm also
retired educator and uh I'm
originally from northern New
Mexico from Wagon mound, but now
I live in Albuquerque.
And just uh with Los Jardines
Institute we have decades of
work work within an
environmental, economic, and
food justice issues and um
We have a little farm in
Albuquerque. I also um help
Courtney a little community farm
in Wagon mount so that the kids
can eat organic foods, right?
And I won't go through any of
the things that were said today,
I think some of the most
important things are the fact
that DOA doesn't care about New
Mexico. The fact that DOE
doesn't live up to its
commitments, right? Recently in
Albuquerque went through an air
quality hearing aid, hearing,
uh, hearing, and it was a
disaster, right? There were 2
environmental justice groups.
In 19 industries against
environmental justice and
cleaning up the air in
Albuquerque, which has an F and
better days is a D minus from
the American Lung Association,
all right, 19 groups against two
environmental justice, uh
organizations and the disaster
of air quality in Albuquerque,
and among those groups was DOE.
Kirtland, Sandia Labs, and UNM,
which is kind of sad when you
think that we go send our kids
to the university in me to get
educated, but in reality,
they're being contaminated.
In North campus, right? So those
are issues and we, we don't
trust any of the government
officials that came on today,
even ONT right, gave a good rap
today. I'm from the Mountain
View community a few years, um,
not a few years, well, a few
years ago, it was presented to
us at the Albuquerque wanted to
take or the office uh ONT want
to take basically moneys from
two superfund sites in
Albuquerque.
And basically in the Popoloco
area and Mountain View and uh
basically it's in the local area
just um north of Rio Bravo.
And this basically this uh money
was used with other monies to do
an outfall project that that
Pueblo Vile as well as our
organization and other
organizations basically
challenge the NRT using that
money for that outfall water
project, they impacted
communities didn't even get the
opportunity to listen, to have a
say, and when we did have a say
in it, we were completely
ignored. We ended up calling um
um Superfund from Region 6 as
well as the state and quite
frankly, they don't care. They
don't follow up in a wagonmoun
most recently, the big, the
hillbilly oil uh family of New
Mexico, the Yates Company,
bought some land just about 1
mile out of this, uh, the
village of Wagon Mount and
within half a mile of the Santa
Clara Springs our water source
dynamited at least 4 times for
NMED even moved. They finally
did go in and said it was a,
there was nothing that had been
done. It hadn't affected the
geological the geology of our
water source and we don't.
necessarily believe that they
didn't even have the courtesy to
contact the mayor and the
council when they went in there
they just went in there and
split.
So we have no reason.
To trust DOE and to trust NMED
maybe they've been responsive to
some 501c3s, but they have not
been
responsive to impacted
communities. The issue of
community engagement or public
engagement has become kind of a
dirty word for us.
Because especially now under
this administration with the
Justice 40 money and the revival
of environmental justice with
new executive orders. We know
that this justice 40 money that
was supposed to impact
communities of color
disenfranchised communities,
legacy contaminated communities
is basically going to um the
institutions and the all trickle
down effect is not working for
us. Most of these people that
are getting monies including UNM
have to basically say that
they're dealing with
community-based organizations
and that has become a lie.
Uh, basically there are basic
advancing their particular
departments in this case of New
Mexico State University, which
is one of the tic tacs that is
supposed to address this region,
Region 6 with with um with
technical assistance, right?
What we have seen is basically
that tic tac which should be
reaching out to environmental
justice communities reaches out
to Los Alamos. Los Alamos
doesn't need to reach out to.
They're getting billions of
dollars every year to continue
to contaminate it.
And uh
You have had people today
talking to you about what
regulations need to be in place.
We need to stop talking about
how we're going to clean up
dirty water that industry has
polluted and figure out how
we're going to protect the clean
water that we do have in New
Mexico, and that means that we
do not support this idea of
produced water that will
basically bail out the oil and
gas industry and basically
provide just an alternative
source of energy for hydrogen,
which the legislature did not
approve several years ago, but
our governor.
been across the world trying to
get money for that, and we have
facilities already been um built
where?
And Pruitt
OK,
Native American and Molior.
So we want you to protect those
communities that are not here
and in terms of economic
engagement, we want them to put
some money into economic
engagement so that they do more
than just put things up on on a
website because even if we look
at the native nations in our
community, they don't even have
access so please please listen
to what the folks said today.
OK, thank you very much.
OK. Is there anyone else in the
audience?
Yes sir.
I'm gonna have to time this
time. Thank you, Madam Chair.
And members of the committee. My
name is Scott Kovac with Nuclear
Watch New Mexico.
And I just have a quick point
here, um, earlier today, one of
the earlier today we were
talking about Acid Canyon.
And you know, the, the
laboratory was stating that it
was safe.
But what, what they don't
clarify all the time is that
some of the uh
There's different levels of
risk.
That they that they address and
they have recreational risk.
Industrial risk and residential
risk. So if they say something
is safe.
You have to ask, well, is, is
it, you know, for residential
when when people are living
there or industrial when they're
just working there during the
day or
Recreational when they're just
running through or spending a
short period of time there.
So I just wanted to clarify that
and uh.
Just so we don't, we don't know
if, if, you know, acid canyon is
a residential.
Cleaned up the residential
standards, probably not. It's
probably cleaned up the
recreational standards, so.
Yeah
Therefore, the laboratory can
say that it's safe, even though
there's still plutonium there.
And so that that's a higher
level, you know, then there's
industrial industrial cleanup
level and residential clean up
levels.
And so we have to be careful and
say, well,
It's safer
For recreation, but you know,
it's really safer.
For residential and the uh is is
still there. Thank you very
much. Thank you. Um, anyone else
in the audience?
OK, thank you. We'll go to um
Zoom.
Uh, we have, 03 people now, um,
So we will um limit everyone.
And we'll go with Alison Riley
first.
OK, thank you. I'm Alison Riley,
director of public policy with
the New Mexico Chamber of
Commerce, addressing our
concerns with the Green
amendment. First would be the
impact.
The economic impact on
businesses, higher operational
costs, leading businesses and
vital industries to reconsider
expanding or even investing in
New Mexico, thereby negatively
impacting job growth, as well as
regulatory uncertainty, adding
environmental standards to the
Constitution may create
uncertainties. Courts rather
than lawmakers could end up
interpreting terms like stable
climate, leading to inconsistent
standards that may complicate
planning and regulatory clarity.
We are also
Concerned with increased
litigation due to vague
standards that will open the
door for more, for more lawsuits
on an already overburdened legal
system, but also delaying
projects that are vital to the
economy. Thank you for letting
me speak today.
Thank you. I'm sorry that went
off prematurely. Did you get to
finish?
Uh, yeah, I was. Oh, OK. Thank
you.
Uh, next we have.
Admin
Someone who is
Identified as A.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair, uh,
members of the committee. My
name is Nat Dean. I'm a person
with multiple disabilities and I
am also a disability advocate,
and I just wanted to know the
appreciation for the many years
of service of Senator Nancy
Rodriguez, and I noted the
celebration earlier and I was
unable to be there in person,
and I wanted to say thank you.
And I also appreciate the
efforts and the heavy lift of
the committee, and if we don't
remember to say thank you, we're
not
remembering how hard it is.
Thank you very much, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
members of the public.
Thank you.
OK, next we have Alexis.
Good afternoon. Members of the
committee. My name is Alexis
Perez, and I am an environmental
justice fellow at the Southwest
Organizing Project. I am also a
young concerned citizen of New
Mexico, and I want to urge
decision makers to reconsider
the proposed plutonium
production. Doctor Michael
Ketter's testimony presented
extreme plutonium contamination
in a canyon water during July
2024 Mosu season that contains
788.
6
Pickle curries per liter, which
exceeded the federal gross alpha
primary water quality standard.
Everything that was contaminated
will be released into the
environment and downstream to
Cochi Lake and the Rio Grande.
2013, the PF4 facility was shut
down for 3 years due to severe
safety violation. A repeat of
this with larger quantity
production will directly impact
not only my future but
generations with health risks.
New Mexico was labeled a
wasteland in 1940s during the
Manhattan Project, but to us,
this is sacred land where we
raise children, work, and hunt,
local community members and
tribes need proper regulation,
tribal consultation, and
government transparency of Los
Alamos National Laboratory
radioactive waste treatment
facility under the New Mexico
hazardous Waste Law. It is
important to consider the
national environment policy,
which requires the federal
government to
carefully consider the
