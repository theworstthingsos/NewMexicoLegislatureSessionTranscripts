Or maybe little has changed.
But um
we're looking forward to celebrating
with all those alumni,
but also with you, I think
uh Wednesday evening, tomorrow
evening, we've got the
dinner rouge at the School
of Law and I'm hoping that many
of you will be able to join us
for an annual
celebration that we have
around homecoming week.
Um
uh
I have to tell
you, we do have a lot to be excited
about here, a lot to be optimistic
about. So I do have some things to
share.
Um you
know, slightly feeling
a cough coming on.
You never know when you're speaking
in public, whether you should reveal
the truth of things or
not. But,
you know, just in case
I am needing to turn
this over to someone else,
I'll let you know I am
not contagious
no matter what you hear.
I've been assured I am not
contagious, but I am
recovering from bacterial
pneumonia. And
so there are some
leftover things
and hopefully you
won't get to witness what
some of my colleagues have been witnessing
lately when I try to have
meetings with them. So,
but you know, having said that maybe
nothing will go wrong and that's
part of the reason for doing it, like
carrying an umbrella
when and then it doesn't
rain.
Um, so,
uh, I said there were some
things to be optimistic about and
to share with you. Um,
I would say, you know, one of
them is really our enrollment.
Uh, we continue to see
steady increases over
the last three years and our current
phone numbers are up
again.
Um, Our
total enrollment across
all of our campuses now,
more than 27,000
lobos. Um
Our students continue
to look to
uh to look like New
Mexico. Um A
large Majority come from
traditionally underrepresented
populations and
Encouragingly, we're also seeing
more and more first time
students. Um This
year's group is our largest
ever uh including
many who have transferred from
other
institutions.
In fact, with
43% of all
new UN M
undergraduates coming in as
transfer students,
we're preparing to open our
UN M Transfer and
Transition Student
Center. Um
It's intended to assist
students coming
into UN M from other four year
institutions. It's
an often a population
that we tend to
overlook and
yet intervention
and work with them is essential
to their success.
So it's part of our ongoing
effort to meet the needs of students
where they are.
Um And we're providing these
new belo bows hopeless,
hopefully with a
seamless transition to a
four year degree and
giving them the support they need
to uh attain
it. We'll be formally
launching the center in October.
So we'll be inviting you to
attend. I hope we'll be able to
see some of you
here. Um I
think one of the many reasons
that students do choose the
University of New Mexico is
because we try
to make the research we do
here accessible to our
students. Um
We frequently say that
research is
education and
research provides our students with
the opportunities to engage
with faculty as part of
the research teams
to be able to conduct hand
on hands-on research under
their supervision, often
for colledge credit. Um
It's really the kind of on the
job training that helps our students
be successful,
um at least to
higher persistence, higher
graduation rates.
Um So I want to tell you
a little bit about the research and I've been
in front of this group before and I have
mentioned uh a couple
of the things that we've been doing related
to our grand challenges.
You might remember that
I spearheaded this in
2018 and we officially
launched them in 2019
and they are in tended to focus
on big issues
that impact New Mexico.
Um uh
And at the time, we
selected three big issues
that affect New Mexico,
sustainable water
resources, substance
use disorders and successful
aging. Six
years later, we've turned
a $22.25
million investment
into more than $100
million in grants and
awards and with
that success, we recently
expanded our grand challenges
and I know I've had an opportunity to meet
with some of you individually to share
with you that these new
areas of grand challenges
we call them. Now, level two
teams are focused
on sustainable space,
research, child
health and a
just transition to
green energy.
And in a short amount of time, we're
already seeing some
um some uh successes
related to these new teams
as they bring in resources,
grants awards,
congressional appropriations,
uh more than 800,000 for
child's health,
840,000 for
sustainable space research.
And we're very proud of the work that
we do with our grand challenges
because it's good for our university.
It's also good for the State of New
Mexico. But I think
one of the things I'm proud
of related to our challenges
is the extent to which we have
so many students involved.
This is not something that
is just our
faculty Members who are crucial
to our research efforts,
but these are things that our students
have um
are directly
involved in hundreds of
them have been able to
participate uh
some of the time
in related to
classrooms,
etcetera,
whether we're examining
alternate sources of
drinking water, developing
innovative substance abuse
treatment in rural communities
or studying uh
um aging
in our native American populations.
Our research has a direct
impact on New Mexicans
and beyond our grand challenges.
Our groundbreaking research continues
to be a foundational part of who we
are as a research.
One institution
among our most exciting new
initiatives is partnering with
Sandia National Laboratories
to launch Un M's 11th
research Center, the Quantum
New Mexico Institute.
We're making New Mexico a
destination for quantum
companies, nuclear
technologies and scientists
around the
world.
There is also our new Arid
Institute
accelerating resilience
innovations in
drylands.
That's quite a mouthful. Would you
agree? So
it's nice to just cut it short,
to arid.
Um We're working to ensure
that human societies can
sustainably thrive
and grow food and other
crops in some of the driest
places on earth.
We're also leading research in
artificial intelligence
um and its implications in
teaching and research
and learning across
disciplines. Um This
is led by our dean
uh uh Leo Low of our College
of University Libraries and Learning
Sciences. And we're one
of only 18 institutions
taking part in a
twoyear study to
unlock the potential of A
I to advance higher
education.
So where we end up, it's
hard to say, do we even know
where we're all gonna land with
regard to artificial
intelligence? So I guess
we'll just have to say, stay
tuned. Um
But research is one of uh
one of the only one of
the many ways that we advance
New Mexico. We
also value our role as an
economic leader and
motivator, providing
intellectual and financial
capital needed to spark
local businesses and
grow our economy
in the most recent economic
impact report prepared by
lobo analysts. We
learned that the University of New Mexico
accounts for more than 47,000
jobs, 1.9
billion in labor income
and 5.2 billion
in economic
output.
And that's a powerful impact.
Um And you can count on us to
continue to leverage our
resources, whether
they're financial, physical or
intellectual, to work
with you to help build our local
economies.
We want our local economies
to succeed.
I do want to talk briefly about
one of the unique projects that's
underway, but it wouldn't
be underway if it hadn't had
your support in that of
the, of the Governor. And
I'm talking about our south campus
tax increment district.
Uh Development district is
clustered along our
athletics facilities
near I 25 in
Gibson is a
public, public, public,
public collaboration
between U and M, the city
of Albuquerque Burn, Leo County
and the State of New Mexico.
Uh Plenty of work is already
underway in the southernmost
section of
our tax increment district.
Um There are two major
chain restaurants that will be coming
soon. Some people are really
excited about the
long-awaited In and Out
Burger. Um
I understand there might be a couple who
are not as excited, is it because
they don't serve mayonnaise on it?
I can't remember what I heard
but um we're
also in the planning stages
for a sports and entertainment
district near our athletics
facilities, bringing more
people to the area on game
days where much of the money
they spend will stay in the
district. The tip
does more than just revitalize
an underutilized portion
though of the city,
it should also spur the
creation of some 4000
new jobs with over
4 billion in wages.
And we're grateful for your
support in this investment
in our community.
Many of you also know about Un and
Rainforest innovations
uh which serves as one of the
state's leading catalysts
for similarly creative economic
development. We know
that entrepreneurial endeavors are key
in supporting job growth in New
Mexico. Um
And the more we can support them, the
better the outcomes for
our communities,
we also know that innovation
isn't an urban
phenomenon
um which is why
we really work
hard from our place here
in Albuquerque to
reach the communities that
exist all over the State,
the ones that need our assistance
and resources the
most. So I'm really
pleased that UN M Rainforest
Innovations was
awarded a New Mexico
Tribal
entrepreneurship grant to create
broader opportunity and
mitigate the barriers
that impact tribal
entrepreneurs.
We're also pretty happy to hear
that the Association of
Public and Land grant
Universities has
extended Un M's
designation as an Innovation
and Economic Prosperity
University. This
is a designation that
recognizes
universities in the
country that are
exemplary in their institution
wide commitment to regional
economic engagement.
So when we say we're committed to
tending to, to the needs of all
New Mexicans,
we mean it
um it's our obligation.
It's our privilege
to share our people,
our expertise, our
skills to help
our State be
smarter,
stronger and
healthier for
everyone.
So speaking of
working with great partners,
I want to thank you and your colleagues
for your leadership
and support for the investments
and collaboratives that make
such a difference at our
university, but also in
the greater New Mexico
community with your
help. We're in the process of building
a new home for our
uh College of Fine
Arts um which
presently has its program
sprawled among 13
of some of the campus,
oldest buildings,
you know, sometimes those beautiful
buildings on the outside don't
have the same look on the
inside.
Sometimes they do. But
um but
thanks to the 2022
GEO Bond, we'll be
starting work this fall on the Center
for Collaborative Arts and
Technology.
Um And it will not
only house our College of Fine
Arts, but it will serve as a
hub of the Albuquerque art
community and the
creative economy throughout the
State and region. We know
what an important component,
creative arts are
to the economy of New
Mexico and
it's an idea
um uh if
you see it and there's an idea
of what it will look like cause it
anchors our campus on
Central and
Stanford.
Finally, I often say
that a healthy New Mexico
is a more prosperous
New Mexico. And
this is something we take to heart
as the state's only academic
health center. Um
As you came here this
morning,
how many of you drove past
or walked past that critical care
tower? You know, living
at University House. I've been watching
that critical care tower
go up. Wow
for quite some time.
And right now it's nearing
compu completion
um over on
lous. This is a key
addition to UN M Hospital
along with our inpatient
expansion at Sandoval
Regional. And it will help
us meet our state's growing health
care needs over the next
decade. As we add
more inpatient beds
serve more patients,
train more providers
and create more than 700
new health sector jobs.
We're truly, truly
growing opportunities for
improved health care
and stronger, more inclusive
economies for the benefit of New
Mexicans, we're
proud to be providing health
services in every
corner of the
State.
Unfortunately,
there are just not
enough people
available
to do it.
And we're
seeing amazing,
incredible shortages of
health care workers in
nearly every
field. And
it is especially
problematic in our rural
communities. So,
one of our priorities as an
institution is
to help our State fix
that we're
undertaking an ambitious
effort. One that I would
characterize as a paradigm
shift to build our
state's healthcare workforce.
We want to expand nearly every
colledge and school under the
umbrella of Health
sciences
and invest in a new home
for our School of Medicine,
which has been in the same building
since 1967.
This is an effort that we will
be initiating
in collaboration with
extensive networks
of internal and external
community partners.
It is an exciting
and hugely important
initiative for the
State and I'm
delighted to have recently
appointed our
Executive vice President,
who's exactly the kind of leader
we need to mov'e
forward on this ambitious new
challenge.
My pleasure to have
him with us today, we will
talk a bit more about this
initiative.
So, Chairman Munoz,
Members of the Committee, I'm delighted to
introduce uh Mike
Richards as our
um Executive VP for
um health sciences.
Mike. >> So thank you,
President
Stokes.
Good morning Mr. Chair and Committee
Members. As President Stokes
said, my name is Michael Richards
and I'm very pleased to be the
new interim Executive Vice
President of Health Sciences.
And I was most recently
the senior Vice President of Clinical
Affairs, which is, I think
probably best described as like the
clinical or the
chief operating officer for
Clinical Enterprise.
But I've been at UN M since
1997 and a
faculty member since
2000. And
I'm a professor of Emergency
Medicine in the School
of Medicine. And
I've served as
the interim Executive Vice
President of the Health Sciences.
In the past, I've also served
as the interim dean of our School
of Medicine and have worked
with the Executive branch on
some of our statewide response.
So I'm very pleased to have this
opportunity to serve
again in this role as
President Stokes
noted. Um we,
we have a significant healthcare
workforce shortage across
all of the United States and New
Mexico is not different.
Perhaps our challenges are a little
greater because of the rural
nature. Um while those
numbers May not be bigger, there's
sometimes a harder
task in terms of filling
those roles. And,
and one of the things that the regents
and the President have asked us to do
is to think about what
more can we do
to help close that gap.
Now, obviously, as a health care
training institution, this is
what we do. It's what we did
last week. It's what we'll do
tomorrow. But what
more can we do to help
New Mexico with this
healthcare workforce shortage?
And so one of the things that, that
President Stokes talked about
was the clinical delivery
system. And this actually
creates a very exciting
opportunity for us.
One of the of the things about health care
profession, education
is that those learners
and those learners of all
types physicians,
nurses, pharmacists
actually need more than a
classroom. They need a
clinical delivery system for
them to complete their training.
And over the last decade,
we've actually saturated our
current clinical platform
with learners. And so
we really have not had the
opportunity to
significantly grow these
health professions programs.
But with this new
clinical expansion that
you've heard about, such as
the new Critical Care Tower
or our plans to grow
um the inpatient platform
at SR MC or
all of the other kinds of things
like our crisis triage
center, you know, and with your great
support, the children's psychiatric
center, you know, we've got
tremendous amount of
clinical growth underway
actually over a billion dollars
worth of capital projects right
at this moment. And when we look
out over the next 10 years,
we can actually see that the
adult inpatient
platform for the UN
M health system
almost doubles our
surgical capacity
doubles. And we start
to see like 50 to
60% increase in
our outpatient platform
that creates tremendous
opportunity for us to
now be able to grow our
educational programs.
And so when we look at at
where we are, we've now
are asking all of our
deans to think about
how we start to project
what we can do to, to
make an even bigger
contribution to that workforce
need. You know, I want to thank you
for the great support that we've had for
like our College of Nursing and
College of Population Health.
They are now moving to their
new contemporary
educational facility.
Um We are also
advancing some
modifications to our College
of Pharmacy building,
but at the end of the day, those buildings
are only buildings, what really
matters are the programs
that we will be able to put in those
physical plants to be able
to then train the workforce
that New Mexico needs for
tomorrow. And as President
Stokes noted though that one
of the biggest things that we'll, that we'll
have to face is that the current
School of Medicine Physical
Plant and that primary
building is Fitz Hall
is actually at end of life.
And so we're now doing the business
planning and the programming
to understand what we
will need in terms of a
physical plan to
support the School
of Medicine and
their desire to double
the size of their undergraduate
or medical degree program.
But also all of the other
programs which are in the of
medicine over this next
10 years. And so we look
forward to kind of bringing that back
because, you know, I don't think that
many states are actually
in academic institutions
are at this particular
unique opportunity where you
have such a significant
growth of the clinical platform
to support a growth of all
of our educational programs.
And so we look forward to working with
you as we, we bring those
plans forward this
fall. And with
that Mr. Chair, we'll stand
for questions.
>> OK. Thank you,
Representative La Cruzio
>> first.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. It's a pleasure
as, as we
said earlier to be here at U and
M, you know, one of the things
about being old, Mr. Chairman is
that you've seen things and when
I started U and M in
1975
this building
was downstairs
where the eating area
is, the, the fast food restaurants
are located. It was just
a big room. It was like a
big high school
cafeteria setting
and it was cafeteria
style food.
Uh, so it's pretty cool to have seen all
of that, but having
been around this community in my
entire life, it's, it's, it's
wonderful to see them,
the changes, the
growth, uh the
credibility of this particular
institution and it just gladdens
my heart because I believe
that UN M as a treasurer in New
Mexico. So Mr. Chairman,
I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate
Un M on their hard work.
And of course, to President Sto
Stokes, I hope she feels better.
Thank you,
Chairman.
Thank you, Senator
>> Woods,
sitting in a corner here, Mr.
Chair.
What I want to
ask a question
about is
how many students do you
have enrolled at
four physicians?
How many, how many do
you train
or graduate out of
your program? You was talking about
the residencies and,
and having trouble you, you,
you say we have filled
up all of the
spots and we can't
expand that until
we find
someplace to further
their education.
But how many do you turn
out a year?
Uh, to
that point? I
guess
>> so, Mr. Chair Committee Members
and Senator Woods. So the School of
Medicine total
enrollment for
undergraduate medical education,
which is that medical
doctor degree
is a, is just over
400. Um, we bring in
about 100 and three
students per year.
And so our, our, our
goal and what Dean Finn
is working on now is to
double the size of that school
of medicine class
in addition to that. Um And
as you had mentioned, Senator, our
graduate medical education,
which is our residents and
fellows. We're at about
750
residents and fellows.
And as we grow
our clinical um delivery
system, um we will
uh expect to add another
250
residents and fellows which
will take us to over 1000
residents and fellows which
will actually make us one of the
largest graduate medical
education training programs in the
United States.
>> Is, have you got any idea,
Mr. Chair? Have you got any
idea how many
of them stay in State
to become
practicing
here? >> Yes.
Um Mr. Chair and Senator Woods,
we do track the placement
of our, of, of, of our
graduates from both medical
school and our residency
programs. And so for
residency programs, we're
right at the national
average for retention,
which is about 48%
stay immediately.
And if you're a medical student,
it's a, it's about a
30 to 40%
stay depending on whether or not
you do residency. And
so what we really hope to do
is to have New Mexicans
um who do medical
school here and then
also do residency
here because that gives us the
most likely um
opportunity for them to stay
here.
>> Is there any truth to the fact
that we've lost 500
doctors over the last year
residents in the
State?
>> Um, so Mr. Chair and Senator,
I'm, I don't know that I could
verify that number.
Um, but
I, I do know that we talk
about, um, you know, whether
we're able to retain the kind of
healthcare workforce that we
need. And I, and one of
the things that I'll also kind of point
back to is that one
of the things that we have to have
in order to be able to retain
health care professionals is
that we need a place for them to
work. And so one of the
things with this growth of our clinical
delivery system is that
we know that, that we'll
be bringing on between
350 to
400 more
physicians in
just the UN M health
system alone as we
add this new capacity.
And I think that that's a, that's
not the only reason
why people leave,
but you know, but we have to have job,
we have to have places for them to
work, which means that we have to have the
infrastructure. But I also
appreciate that in some areas
that, that having a, you
know, an adequate practice
environment and and
colleagues are also very important
to, to where health professionals
make a decision to ultimately live
and work
>> shifting gears. Just a
second Mr.
Chair,
how about your, your law
program, your law degrees.
How many students do you
have in that,
>> uh, Mr. Chair
and Members of the Committee? Just
quickly let me introduce myself.
I'm, uh, James Holloway
Provost and EVP for
academic affairs here at UN M
and President Stokes
apologizes for having to
have, have left but the,
uh, the cough did
get her. Um, uh,
so to
answer the question, we have about 100
students,
uh, in, in a law school
class. Uh, and so
about 300 to in the
law school.
>> And that is a four year degree,
right? >> It's
three years, >> a three
year degree. And
how many of those stay within
the State? Do you have any
idea? >> I
know that the >> Majority,
>> I know that the Majority stay within
the State. But I can't, I don't know a
precise number we could get that
for you.
>> Yeah, I was just
wondering what the contrast
those
and, and the other school that
I worry about is, is the
pharmacy school because
that is a, a degree
that is ever
hometown needs.
And we're such a shortage
of pharmacists also.
So, what kind
of numbers are we talking
about in the pharmacy? And this is
my last question, Mr. Chair.
I know you're a
stickler.
>> So, um, so Mr. Chair
and, uh, and, and sort of woods.
So, um, right now
in our school, um,
we, uh, we have about,
uh, 212 total
pharm D students.
And we have um right
now about
482
practitioners we believe are
needed in the State. Um
So, one of the things that I think that we're
very proud of is that our current
College of Pharmacy actually is
one of the best pharmacy schools
in all of the United States.
It's one of the the highest
funded in terms of research.
And I'll also say that that,
that New Mexico has
really embraced the idea
that, that we have these
healthcare professionals that
could in fact be part of our
solution to delivering health
care in rural areas.
And so I um thank
you for the support that you had
for our pharmacist to try and
expand their scope of
practice. Um um
as you did last year
because I think that will do
a couple of things. One,
it will help us address some
workforce needs, particularly
in rural areas. I also
think it makes New Mexico a
more attractive place for
clinician pharmacists to
work. And so
that's one of the reasons why we're
very enthusiastic about
um the the renovation of
the current College of Pharmacy
building.
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
I didn't ask about
the uh office
of the Medical Examiner.
Uh you know, how
I feel about
that, this is the
only place in the State
that, that
has that and, and how
critical that office
is, uh, to
so many, uh,
in an area
where there's a, a crime
and, and, and
we have to,
to determine certain
things and
anyway, I, I won't go into
that any further. It's as,
you know, I'm very concerned
about that particular
office also.
>> So Mr. Chair, if I
can and Senator Woods, so let me just
say that. So thank you very much
for your ongoing support for our
office of the Medical
Investigator. I am, I
think this is also one of the
places where New Mexico
really shines our
office of the medical investigator
model that we have in this
State is really
um a leading edge.
In fact, we are the largest
trainer of forensic pathologists
in all of the United States. In
this partnership that the university
that has with the State of New Mexico
allows us to do
very unique things
like the discovery and
identification of hon virus
is just one small thing.
I do appreciate that
that um our office of the
medical investigator needs additional
support and working with
Secretary Rodriguez. We will
be advancing an RPSP
this year that will
um provided with
a request for additional financial
support for the Office
of Medical Investigator to be able to carry
out those essential public safety
services.
>> Thank you Mr.
Chair.
>> She
um thank you Mr. Chair.
I also want to talk just a little bit
about the medical medical
school. Uh We
hear anecdotal evidence
that New
Mexicans
don't get into New
Mexico Medical
School that, that most of them
are from out of State and
that a small portion of,
of course, it's always
anecdotal.
But
what do you think?
>> So? Um Mr. Chair
and Senator, she, so
um our, our commitment
at the School of Medicine and actually,
sir, across all of our health
profession programs is
is to create opportunities
for New Mexicans to have
health profession careers.
And um and that's important
to us because because that
gives us the workforce that will look
like New Mexico. And your
specific question is about the
School of Medicine and our priority
in the School of medicine is
to offer up that medical
education to New
Mexicans. Um So
we really only accept
in-state students into
our school of medicine. There
are a couple of rare exceptions.
So for example,
um we do um
accept some out of
State students who are
connected with uh with an
agreement for Native
American um students.
But um we generally
have about 97%
of all of the medical
students in our program
are from New
Mexico. And but
sir, your point about
there are New Mexican
um um students and colledge
graduates that would like to go to
medical school here who can't
get in. We understand
that that is one of the reasons
why we're aggressively
working towards doubling the
size of our medical
school?
>> Ok, thank you.
I the
97%.
Thank you.
Um
One of the things that does concern
me this probably for the Provost
instead. Uh So there was
a comment that
um transfer
students. So the
implication was that you were
bringing people from eastern
Western and New Mexico
State.
Is that true? Or are they coming
from Wisconsin and
Nebraska and
California,
>> Mister Chair and
Senator Scherer, the Majority
of our transfer students are actually
coming from twoyear schools.
So they come, our
largest feeder
of students is
CNM um
San Juan Community
College, Santa Fe Community
College, our own branches. Uh
We also do have transfers
from out of State as well
into New Mexico, which we think
is a good thing, bringing talent
into the State. Um
But the Majority of the transfer
students are actually coming from twoyear
schools, not the other four
year schools. >> All right, thank
you.
And what
has tuition
done since the opportunity
scholarship became
effective?
>> So
Chair Munoz Senators
Shearer, our
tuition has been
hasn't changed in the
last two years
which which aligns
with the opportunity scholarship
came into being. And
so our tuition
has actually been fixed for
those for that period of
time since opportunity
began. >> Ok. So
Mister Chair and this is
just a comment. One of my
concerns
has been that
somebody from Wisconsin can
mov'e to mov'e to
Albuquerque, get
an apartment, get the utilities
in their name, come to UN
M for free.
Um Do we
see any of that or, or are
they really New Mexicans?
Uh >> So we about
80% of the
uh Mr. Chair and, and Senator
share about 80% of the students
at the University of New Mexico are
New Mexicans are from New Mexico.
About 20%
are from out of State that's
both undergrad and
grad students.
So a big
chunk of that 20% out of
State are actually the graduate students
as well. So the vast
Majority of the the
students at UN M and
receiving the opportunity
scholarship are
really from New Mexico. They went
to a New Mexico High school and,
and so on. >> Ok.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you,
Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and thank you
to,
to the presentation
and to the information you provided
to us. So
just a few things
on the 27,000
enrollment. Does that
include also the two year
colleges,
>> Mr. Chair,
Senator Gonzalez? Yeah,
the 27,000 is
all in all of our branches
and Albuquerque. >> Ok.
Very well. And
uh in seeing the the
numbers that you're seeing
for the need
on the medical within
the next 10 years.
Uh Is there any
plan or
anything to increase the
B A MD
program?
>> Um So I'll let Doctor Richards
add to this as well. But
Chair and Senator
Gonzalez, that's certainly part
of the discussion because
that has been a very useful
program for
encouraging New
Mexicans, especially rural New
Mexicans to mov'e
into the medical
field. And so that's certainly part of
the discussion. I don't think a
decision has been made about
that.
>> Ok. Very well.
Um I just want to
mention that the
support that you provide
to the two year colleges
and the UN
M Taos, I mean, there's not enough
words to explain, you know, what
it's done to that community,
you know, and the growth.
But the most important
is like
the last,
just last week, there was a graduation
of the emergency medical
program and then
also with the nursing
program, what is
very
fascinating is
that these
individuals are hired
immediately, you
know, and that's really
building the capacity
into the community
and also building capacity
to the need that we
have that we're
facing the
last part of Mr.
Chairman.
I was very fortunate
to, to spend so
much time as I did with
the late Nni
Salazar representative
Salazar.
And he was one of our
longest standing
Members
in the legislature.
And he introduced me
to the portion of
research and
the value of it and
you know how it works. And, and
he did that from Los
Alamos and
his story was just
unbelievable, you know, like
he would tell how
he started as a dishwasher
and ended up as a nuclear
fusion scientist.
And also, you know,
what they did to
retain him after he
retired.
And uh but just a
wealth of
there's no end to
research, you know,
and, and it
just by
the way, we're growing
as far as
the advancements on
technology,
you know, that just
there's more and more
of a need for that.
But, you know, if you're there,
you're in the, you're
in and you can
participate versus
so with that um
for the University of New Mexico,
I mean, that's a big plus and I
hope that we can just expand
and really, really build
more on that part on the, on the
research part. Thank
you, Mr.
Trim,
Senator >> Rodriguez. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Good
morning to everyone.
Thanks for your presentation for
your work and just
everything persevering
through this, these hard times that we
have with such a great shortage.
Um And Doctor Richards,
um, Doctor Stokes
spoke a little bit before
she left about the
State, uh the
workforce health
care shortage she called
it. And you've continued to
elaborate on that.
Um The only question I
had for clarification
is um
when, when she
mentioned, if you can speak for her
here, the that
she would be working or
U and M would be working at
increasing the workforce
through external and
internal community
partners. My only question
in my mind is um
how I can see
internal, how you would do
that but externally
um community
partners, I didn't understand
that. Can you just explain how is
it for bringing people from out of
State or
external meaning out of
UN M? Just tell me a
little bit for the sake of time.
Thank you. >> So Mr.
Chair and Senator Rodriguez,
when we think about the
internal piece, I believe we were
really talking about
the students that we would directly
train and, and
then those individuals would
mov'e into the community and
workforce. When we think about
the external partnerships, there are
things that we can do as an
academic medical center
that might support other
educational programs around
the State, particularly like the
GME and the residency
programs where we don't necessarily
do all of this by ourselves.
And so an example of that might
be the, what we call the one
plus three GME program
that we have with Christa Saint
Vincent, where, where
we share that program with
that hospital the first year
here, the next two years
there. Or for example,
the program that we just built
with the um at
Shiprock, which was the
first Indian Health
Service residency
program of its kind
in the United States. So
there's an example of how we can
directly participate in
education. But as
the university and as
educational leaders in the
State, we can also be
important partners with our
policymakers as we think
about, you know, what are the right
policies that might help
us with retaining the
workforce? And that's some of the things
that we've done in collaboration
with both Members here today
and like with the Executive
branch. So last year,
maybe about one year ago,
we helped with the um
the Governor host a
summit on healthcare
workforce and um
where we looked at what are the
kinds of policy initiatives
that might help us
retain more healthcare
professionals in the State of New
Mexico. So those are some
examples of what an internal
like partnership would look
like.
>> Thank you, Doctor Richard for that. And
just quickly, Mr. Chairman
um on the
um on your priorities
to increase this workforce.
Are you um
endeavoring in
building from within in
New Mexico before you go
out of State or because of the great
shortage, you're just doing it all
together.
>> So, Mr. Chair and, and
Senator Rodriguez, our, our
first and foremost
commitment is to New Mexico
and we want to create these
educational opportunities
for New Mexicans.
And um and so that will be our, that
will be our top priority. And that
will mean that when we think about
how to grow these programs,
to ensure that we have the right
pipeline, we talked about the B
A MD program as an
example or that we build
the right support services
so that so that our students
are going to be successful in these
rigorous health professional
educations. And,
and so that will be our
primary commitment. Um
But I do think that we have to also
be willing to accept that,
that the states around
us are starting to redefine
what, what in-state
tuition or in-state
residency means. So for
example, Oklahoma
is now considering the
State of New Mexico in-state
for medical school applications.
But I do believe that we've
got a lot of
capacity to be able to create
these opportunities for
New Mexicans first and
that that will
remain our top
priority. >> Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Doctor
Richards. I appreciate your
mindset on that
because it is true. We do have a
lot of good
um qualifications,
qualified people in New Mexico
and we always endeavor to try
and do it from within if we
can. So. Thank
you very much and that's
all I have. Mr.
Chairman
>> Senator
Shino.
Mm
Here we go.
All right. Thank
you.
That's right. There you go.
Technical stuff. So Metro
Grady
uh thank you again uh
for the information.
Uh Doctor Richards.
Can you speak a little bit about
the relation? I know that we have the
historical agreement between
in health service and the tribes
1952 agreement and there are
certain guarantees
with the tribes and
pueblos around beds
and, and access
to health care at the UN M
facility. Can you speak to that?
And what's the current State of
that?
>> Um Mr. Chair and
Senator Shindo. Um
I think that our
relationship um
with um with that
particular 1954
contract, it isn't
just a historical agreement,
it actually is who we are
today. I think it's one of the
things that makes our U and M
hospital a very special
place we always talk
about, you know, whatever
institution you're at about how you're
different. But, but in
this particular case,
our legacy of
our U and M Hospital and the land
that it on is
connected to that 1954
lease. It's also
connected to the idea that
we started off as Bernalillo
County Medical Center after
we were the Indian Hospital.
And so we're not only
uh uh the
equivalent of the IHS
hospital for this community,
we're also the community's primary
safety net. And we're also
the community's tertiary
Quain care referral center.
And that by that, I mean, the
highest complexity of care
and we're the state's academic
medical center. So we
are very unique in that
regard. Um And as
you pointed out there is a bed
commitment um as part
of that 1954 lease.
And so we continue to work
very closely with both
IHS and the All Pueblo
Council of, of Governors
um on all of our clinical
and strategic initiatives
because um we
believe that it is
essential to, to being
faithful to who we
are. It's not just legacy,
it's kind of the way we think
of our clinical delivery system
today. >> I
appreciate that.
And so, so what
does that mean with the Hunter bed agreement?
And how does that work?
>> So we have, we actually have a
bed, we actually have a bed
agreement with, with
IHS for those,
for those particular beds.
And um, and so they're, they're
part of the overall
um way that we
manage the beds. And so
it's a an agreement to have
at least 100 beds available
for Native American
services. But I do believe
that we are, we go above
and beyond that. Um
in terms of things like our
partnership with the Native American
community or like, I
guess a few minutes ago, the
example of, of how we've
kind of created a
residency program
at Shiprock, which is the
very first of its kind in
the United States um
to create that residency
program within an IHS
>> facility. Ok,
appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One more
question. Uh I was
at a cross country in north
campus uh this
past Saturday and
I kind of illegally
parked in the law school and then I
went around and I drove
to the by the old
IHS facility
and I know that's a
gate. Do you
know Doctor Richards? What's I
mean, I haven't talked to anybody from IHS,
but I know it's a pretty old
facility. Are there any
ideas or anything
that's gonna be happening on
that property or is it still active
or is it closed?
>> So, so Mr. Chair and
Senator Sindo Yes, it's
still an active clinic right
now. And so we've not
been in any negotiations
with them for any,
any change in the plan of the
use of that facility.
>> Appreciate it. Thank you, Mr.
Chair,
>> Senator Campos. Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman. And of course, uh to
Vice President Richards, I
just really appreciate the ongoing
work on behalf
of health care here in New Mexico. You
know, we've had those extensive
discussions in regards
to where we're headed
with that. Uh One of the
questions that I have and it doesn't have
to be answered right
now. But uh with the
outreach that you've provided,
I'd like to go and meet with you
after. And that's in
regards to the uh
SYN A AD T I
uh system. I understand
that it still hasn't been
set up and that of course,
is to continue
to go ahead and do some
of the brain work that is essential
if you will to the
people here in New Mexico.
So that's one
of my interests
and there's quite a few more,
but if we could maybe
visit on the offline so that we
can continue with that. That's all I have.
Mister Chairman.
Thank you, Representative
Baca,
>> thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank
you um,
Committee Doctor Richards.
I just want to publicly
commit and tell about my pool
and undivided support
for our health care
systems. I
think that as we, we
stood about there and we talk about the
challenges we face. I do believe
that we in this opportunity,
time need to make an investment in our
health care, the expansion
of our um
our medical programs for
all, for all of our,
for all of our citizens. And
so we have this
opportunity and just like you said, you're
building from 1964
just like us. Many of us,
we're, we're still useful, but we have
some years on this and the,
the the plaster May be a little bit cra
cracked and, but we're still
useful. So I just want to communicate
my support. And so
I also I encourage my
colleagues to also take a look
and see how we can make
that investment expanding. Does
Senator uh
Gonzale said, I want to see
the, the B A MD program
expanded, keep more students,
keep more doctors here.
Uh You know, we talked about Medicaid
reimbursements increasing that
we talked about reducing the medical
malpractice. We
talked about tuition
reimbursement. We
also need to look at how do we
get doctors? Because one of the other ways to keep
docs in the State is help them
set up their practice. And that
came from a doctor that I talked,
Doctor Royal said,
help us to set up our
practices because a
doctor that sets up a practice in your
community will likely
stay in that community.
So I
just wanted to encourage us to,
to look at that. And so
doctor Richards. I'm gonna ask
you the question that you know, want to be
asked if you were
sitting over here
knowing what we're talking about.
What is it that we need?
What investment do you
need
to help improve
our health care, citizens for
all students, both in the
urban areas and the
rural
areas?
>> So, Mr. Chair and
Senator Baca, Representative
Baca, so thank you very much for your
comments. So, um
let me just start by
saying how appreciative we are
with the support that we already
have. Um we would
not have the clinical
facility growth um
that you see out there, which
creates this unique opportunity
if we did not have the support
of the State that includes
both the direct support of the
legislature, but also the
incredible partnership that we've
had with the new Mexico
Health Care Authority with
Medicaid. And so that
has allowed us to be able to
deliver essential clinical
services but to also
grow. So that's
not something that all academic
medical centers have that
access to. So,
um I believe at this moment
we've got uh the
right reimbursement model,
the State has really supported
the university in terms of being
able to grow its graduate
medical education programs.
The single biggest thing that we
need on the
health care delivery system
side, from the perspective of the
university is to be able
to replace the physical plant
for Fitz Hall. That building
was built in 1967
it no longer represents
contemporary medical
education. And so
we do need a replacement
facility, but we also
need a facility that
expands our capacity.
The School of Medicine is not
just the undergraduate medical
education or MD
program. It's the primary
school where we also house
all of our other health
professions, physical
therapists, occupational
therapists, respiratory therapists,
EMTS. It's
also the place where we house
our basic medical
scientists both at the
graduate and phd
level. So there's over
1000 students there,
not just physicians. And
so what we need and are
hopeful for to get the board
of is to be able to
replace that facility,
to be able to create a modern
contemporary facility that will
support health profession
educations over the
next two or three
generations, the next 50
to 60 years. And
I mean, we're working on that right
now in terms of, you
know, understanding what the
size of that building would need
the business plan for the school of
Medicine, but for,
for the university that is
on healthcare professions,
that's the would be the number one
ask.
>> Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you, Doctor
Richards.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Richards.
Doctor Richards. Thank you for being
here, Mr. Provost.
Uh Thank you for the presentation,
uh very exciting
work happening at the
medical school and, and
um I appreciate
you taking the time
to walk us through
it. Um Also
individually, right, as
you've met with, with a number of us.
Uh My question really
has to do with
the Mill levy with Berlo
County
um for,
for the, for the, for the
benefit of the body of the
Committee.
Uh UN M has a
longstanding
relationship with the county.
Every eight years of voters in
this county are
asked to approve a mi levy
that goes to
um to run the hospital in
part. Um A
lot of us have done a lot of
work uh alongside
with you all at the,
at the me at the
hospital to
build a financial
assistance program for indigent
patients. Um
Obviously, we all pay into
that property tax, whether you're in
your home or whether you rent.
Um And so, one of the things that
collectively we
built, I want to say
now going on 20 years
is this concept of UN
M care, which
kicks in a
little bit of support for people
who might be uninsured or
underinsured. Um
And it is open to all residents of
Beo County. That's something that we
really worked hard to achieve,
including undocumented people
who live here, pay
taxes and
sometimes have to use our health care
facilities. Um I know
the mill levy is up for renewal.
Um Now in
2024
I believe uh
in November. Uh what
is the status of the financial
assistance program within
the hospital? Uh How
has it changed from
eight years ago? And where
do you see it going with
the um you know, with
healthcare becoming perhaps a little
bit more affordable through the
Affordable Care Act and
through the New Mexico Based
Exchange, but also
in light of some of the shortages
that we're seeing in health care
professions.
>> So Mr. Chair and Mr.
Speaker, um so thank
you very much for noting the,
the Mill, the Bernal Leo County Mill
Levy. So I think that that
represents an incredibly
strong uh partnership
that we've had with Bernal
Leo County. That particular
mill levy is a little bit
different than the mill levies that
might be in place in other
counties. That one is
specifically for the
operations and maintenance
of the hospital and it
is on the ballot um uh
this November and
so um we are
encouraging people to, you
know, to make sure that they
voice their opinion.
Um It is essential for our
operations because it does
provide uh over
like about 100 and $10 million
or so of resources
for operations and maintenance of
the hospital, but it's actually
not a indigent care
fund. We actually
um you, you specifically mentioned
Mr. Speaker, our U and M Care
program, which is our
Indigent Care Fund
and, and we pay for that
UN M care program directly
out of our hospital operating
revenue. It is an
incredibly essential program
in this community. We have over
12,000 patients
who are in U and M care
and probably the most exciting thing
that we're doing right now with
U and M care is that
we're starting to manage those
patients as
if they were in an insurance
product. So we've now
partnered with a company out
of Florida that specializes
in creating these kinds of
programs. And so for
the perspective of, of
the UN M care patient,
you know, they will feel connected
to us and we'll be able
to receive basic health
care services and we will start
to track and manage them
as if they were in an insurance
program. But they're not in
an insurance program. They're actually
in a completely self funded
indigent care program.
And one of the things that I hope that we'll
be able to do, um at some
point is to talk a little
bit about the Health Care Affordability
Act, which had three parts
to it. One part was
how to be able to provide
insurance resources for
individuals who didn't qualify
for the healthcare exchange
or didn't qualify for
me. And so that is
like the UN M care patient
population. And I think
they exemplify what the
intent of that was. And
so there May be some opportunity
for us to show that
as we manage these
patients, it could be the
kind of program that was envisioned
under that Health Care Affordability
Act.
>> Great. Thank you Mr. Chair. And just
to follow up, um how long has
his relationship with
the Florida company been in
place? And
um does
that mean that a patient
now has to call somebody
in Florida? It used to be that
you walked into your office
here a few
blocks from here.
>> So um Mr. Chair
and, and, and speaker
Martinez, no, that
from the perspective of the patients,
this has this will not
look or feel any different
except that we will now
start to manage and
track them. You know, the
same way that as you
as a someone who is
in an insurance plan,
know that you have access to
basic services and,
and then as part of the concept
of health maintenance insurance
companies follow those
patients and they try and
pull them into the
delivery system for things
like like health maintenance
items, like checking, checking
for labs or doing
routine checkups
in traditional Indigent
care programs
that's not done. You know,
maybe they're there to kind of
offset the cost when
individuals come in and seek the
care. What we're wanting
to do is to be very
proactive in managing
these patients so
that we can help improve
their health and and ideally
bring down the cost of
that too, but the real goal
is to improve their health
and we'll do this with a Medicaid
like benefit package.
And so no, this is not
intended to create any
barrier to delivering the
care. It's ideally
intended to help
facilitate getting that
care for patients who
otherwise don't have
access to it. >> Got it. Thank
you Mr. Chair and is, is,
is that program already set up
or is that something that's coming
later? >> So, um
Mr. Chair and speaker Martinez
U and M care is already
here. The idea that we're
gonna start creating the analytics
and the more intense management
of that's something we're starting
right now. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Doctor
Richards. >> It
was small.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Uh great to see you.
Uh Mr. Vice President, Mr.
Provost, Mr. Vice President. Thank
you for reaching out
um Mr.
Chair first for uh
Provost uh
on Friday. We're
gonna have a joint meeting with
the legislative education study
Committee with LES C.
Of course, one of the key issues
for us as a legislature
as a State is our
response to the Yazzie
Martinez lawsuit.
I don't necessarily expect
it now would love to
see feedback on
Friday for
how UN M is
engaging its role in
training the
bilingual and particularly
the tribal uh
educators who
are central for the State
making progress there
and would offer if you
have anything to sort
of share in that space
would offer if you want to do that.
Now, that'd be great
too.
>> So, Mr. Chair
Representative Small, um
thanks for the question and, and I
think this is something that
certainly University of New
Mexico thinks is a
very important part of our
service to the State.
Uh And our College of Education
and Human Sciences has been
very proactive
in um trying to
address the issues that were
raised by the Ozzie Martinez
case and uh
and more generally to improve
education for the
uh uh for the State of New
Mexico. And
so that colledge
has undertaken a
number of activities
specifically in response
to Yazzie Martinez and
continues to do so
and we'll
see if we can get
some, some more detailed
response for you um
over during the
week, Mr. >> Chair.
Thank you, Provost. Thank you.
And perhaps we can share
and director Sali we can work
with um I guess
interim director
at LES C to
maybe get the the needs
as we see them as a
State and see
sort of what that, you
know, how, how that
interface is working and
how the needs are being filled
very well. And if there's any challenges
and also any particular bright
spots that folks want to highlight
and share. Thank you. Uh
Excellent. Uh Secondly,
Mr. Chair
um Mr. Vice
President uh for
the graduate medical education
central to
growing health care
providers. And you
describe it well, that
clinical practice.
Um
My question
is sort
of around how,
you know Albuquerque
is our population
hub, New
Mexico to do
well needs
Albuquerque and the metro
area to be
in a strong place.
At the same time,
residents down
in my neck of the woods,
down in Las Cruces or
maybe uh in
Silver City in
Deming in
Southeast New Mexico, other
parts
they, you know,
those residencies
are perhaps
even as
or more important to those
communities and
to replace an aging
health care provider
population.
How does the balance
between funding
graduate medical education,
directly affiliated
with uh
UN M
and funding graduate
medical education
slots that maybe aren't
affiliated?
How do you see that
balance?
>> So Mr. Chair Representative
Small. So let me
first start off by saying that
the way we've been able to
grow our graduate
medical education so
dramatically at the University
of New Mexico is actually
because of the State
Medicaid support.
Um As you know, the
federal government has capped
the number of Medicare
resident slots
and they've capped the payment on
those. And so that has
been in place for
well over a decade.
So our growth of our
graduate medical education
is specifically the
result of State support through
Medicaid and and
really it's connected to
the number of hospital
beds that we have.
And so as we grow our hospital
beds, it creates the opportunity
for us to grow the numbers.
And then the second rate limiting
step for us in many of these
cases is we have to
have the right kind of patient
experiences to be able
to meet the accreditation, to grow the
residency programs. So
those are two really kind of
important considerations.
So what makes this really
successful for us is the State
support which we are incredibly
grateful for and does
distinguish us as an academic
medical center in the United
States. And the second
is that the growing of the clinical
platform just to be able
to see more patients, lets us grow
the programs. But um
representative small, you also bring up
the importance of being connected
to the rural
communities. Not all
of the residency programs have
to be hospital based.
There's a certain amount of that, that,
that educational training which
needs to be done in a in
a hospital and that
we can do with like I described
earlier, what we call our one plus
two programs where one
year is done in the hospital
and then the remaining years are done
in the community. I think
you heard me mention that our
IHS family
community residency training
program that is the kind
of thing that we need to also
expand as we're thinking about
expanding the school of medicine.
Um But there are other programs that
also are appropriate to mov'e into
the community other than family
community medicine Psychiatry
is maybe one that might also
fit that kind of one plus two
model. So we look forward
to being able to grow
um not just you and me,
but as we grow our graduate
medical program, creating
those opportunities to both create
stand-alone our partnership
program um but
also to be able to create
the kind of rotations that
let these learners
spend some time in the rural
communities. And, and as
I mentioned that the funding for
this is connected to the hospital
and hospital beds. The
other thing that the State legislature
and I thank you for is
that you have actually created a separate
direct appropriation
that lets us pay
for residents to
go to these rural
rotations. Um
And, and to be in hospitals
or clinics that otherwise couldn't
afford to pay for them
because that's the, the model
by which it on. So that State
support that we have right now through
that direct appropriation
does allow us to be able
to put the residents and learners
into the rural communities.
>> Uh Thank, thank you very
much. I'll, I'll probably have
additional um
more detailed
questions but appreciate
very much sort of the overall
perspective. I
do want to learn more
about sort of
the, you
know, how
we serve all corners of the
State. Uh
RFQH CS. And
again, things that I'm
familiar with from down in
Southern New Mexico.
Um And
so starting from
the sort of central
uh commitment
to
our State, having
to vastly grow our
workforce very quickly
and interesting.
I if there are sort of
ratios between
undergraduate, between
the proposed investments,
uh both capital
and faculty
in undergrad, sort
of if you translated that into
a perfect world into
what the
clinical
graduate um
investments might be
over, say a 5 to 10
year period, would be very
interested to see that
um
moving forward
and, and I want to be very
respectful and I know
that, um
you know,
at all institutions,
governance is
of the utmost
importance personnel
matters are, you know,
of that
are very, you
know, closely held for
very, very good reason.
Um Is there any
sort of color that you
might add to
sort of the change
in leadership at health
sciences?
And I, I know
you've sort of shared from your
end, but sort of,
it sounds like your focus
is um
uh very much
growing the workforce
is, would you say, is that like
a central change, is that a central
difference?
>> Um So uh
Chairman
Muez Representative Small,
thank you for the question. Um
Yeah, this, this really,
you know, the the change in leadership
really is driven by this moment of
opportunity.
Um We, we
recognize that
um with the, the
new Clinical Care Tower coming
online, this CRE
incredible increase
in our capacity to
provide health care, we
have to staff that tower
that's a heavy lift.
Um We also
then have this opportunity
to grow medical education and,
and, and grow the health care
workforce in this State. That's a
heavy lift. Both of those
are things we really need to mov'e
quickly on. Um
And with those becoming
the focus, President
Stokes really recognized
that Doctor
Richards is a key
player in helping us make that
happen. Um
And, you
know, we're very very proud of the
accomplishments of
prior leadership. And Doctor
Zid Onis, he did a
terrific job
and, and moved us along in a
very positive and forward
direction. But for this
moment, President Stokes
really saw that in order to mov'e
quickly. Um we
needed to make a change in that
>> leadership. Understood Mr.
Chair. Thank you. Thank you very
much Provost. And
there's no, we're
in such a unique
and really one
of the most exciting times
in New Mexico's history. I
mean, we've just made
very large commitments
you talked about on the Medicaid
side, we're
working to see if we
can sustain
that 150%
of Medicare goal.
It's very difficult.
But as you said,
Doctor Richards, uh
it helps distinguish us
nationally
and workforce
is our core
sort of bottleneck in
implementing the
resources that we for
once as a State have available
now. And illustrated by
the billion dollar endowment
last year for the opportunity,
scholarship and other
uh and continuing
new investments and big
credit to director Sali
LFC staff and the
Committee for
um you know, so school
of Social work, the endowments that
are going there that you all
mentioned.
Um
Finally, just
uh and this can be follow
up on the
um uh
sort of where
are uh
um
the residents
and undergraduates
where they go. I if
and as that's available,
even by region, I
think it'd be very welcome to
see and then a
specific question that I've
been asked to sort of raise
again with the
office of the Medical
Investigator. It
seems like there May be a critical
shortage there.
Do you have by
chance a sense of the vacancy
rates that exist
now?
Um
And, and I think the
impact, at least what we're
hearing in some parts of the
State is sort
of uh law
enforcement, first
responder resources
needed, maybe to
respond to calls
that are unable to do
so sort of because
of the the vacancies which
obviously there's, you know,
comes back to
workforce.
>> So Mr. Chair and
Representative Small, yes.
So there's a, so one
of the, one of the key issues
and our and our office of the
medical investigator is the number
of forensic pathologists.
And so we had ideally would be
at about 11 forensic
pathologists. We're at six
right now, there is a
plan to use
um temporary um
forensic pathologists
as we do our recruitment.
Um the rpsp
that is going to be submitted this
year has the funding to both
support om I
as they use the temporary
workforce for forensic
pathologists, but also for us
to, to bring the
compensation up so that we'll
be able to recruit nationally.
We're I think that we're a very
competitive um
organization
and we'll be able to
be able to do that recruitment.
You also mentioned representative
a small the field response.
And so obviously, we
have a large contingent
of uh field
medical investigators.
And as part of the RPSP,
there is an expansion of the
infrastructure to both support
those field investigators
and um to and to grow
them. Um And so there's
about 100 of them. And so part
of it is adding to that
group, um we are, we
know that that volume of work has
significantly gone up, especially
in the southern part of the State.
>> Great, thank you that
uh that's very helpful
and great that that's part of
what is being submitted
in the RPSP. Thank
you both very much. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. >> Thank
you. I I'll kind of go quick
and, and, and
so we can kind of get through. But I think
Doctor Richards, I mean,
Majority of the questions were
directed towards you.
I mean, the key thing that I'm taking
away from today is
8000
physicians are, are are
need by professionals in the
medical field today,
right? And how we
gonna accomplish that field? I mean,
you don't have the building,
buildings are 3 to 5 years
out of facilities, right?
That just puts you further and further
behind. But I mean, the
8000 professionals,
nobody in New Mexico can get a
doctor's appointment, right?
68 weeks, two
months, even longer
than that. And sometimes
when they're a critical need
those days
matter. And
that's that we've come to this
point. But I, I think we got to figure
out how we're going to do that.
Let me ask you one question
that I think that I really want to
know in,
in, in teaching this
medical profession. Do you think
that just having one
colledge that does
it solely in New Mexico
has strangled our
ability and
in, in creating
physicians and creating
nurses, we have
nursing programs at, at some
of the other colleges. But
8000 shortage,
I mean, you look at Arizona
and they have two medical
schools maybe three in, in, in a
U. I don't know. Right.
But, but New Mexico only
has one. So
have we strangled ourselves
by not allowing N
MS U to have a medical
school and,
and do
that.
>> So um Mr. Chair.
So I, I do believe that
there's multiple ways that we
could create the right infrastructure
for undergraduate
medical education or that's
the MD degree,
you know, the, again, one of
the, the rate limiting steps
for us has been and
would be for any medical
school, whether this would be UN
M or another entry
into the market is
that you actually have to have a clinical
delivery system for those
learners. And um
and there are models where
um where medical schools
can enter into a
community and be community-based
and use someone else's
clinical delivery system. And in
some cases, those are even out of
State clinical delivery
systems. But what we
believe and we think
our data shows is
that that a State
institution like the University
of New Mexico, which is committed
to New Mexicans
for bringing into the medical
school and uses its
own clinical delivery system
for that education
does actually give us,
you know, a very high quality education
product and the most likely
opportunity for them to stay in the
State. But uh
Senator, you, you, you, you clearly
bring up that, that we have
not kept pace for that.
And the rate limiting step in
our case has been having enough
infrastructure and enough patient
volume to train them
that would have been there regardless
of who was here trying
to, to grow the programs.
What we, what we've talked about
today and what I'm
incredibly excited
about is that, that
this conversation is changing.
We now have a payment
model for our clinical delivery
system which supports us growing
access to care that
has supported us growing the clinical
delivery system. We
have, we have this
unique opportunity now
to really make a
significant change in the
number of those medical
students that we could train.
And we're well on our
way and the easiest way for the
State to get there is to
let the established
uh organization and
our school proceed
down this path because we'll
be adding to the infrastructure
that's already there and the accreditation
that's already there. And,
and we're very excited to be
able to do this with
you. >> Yeah, but what
does that timeline look like? I
mean,
>> so, um Mr. uh
Mr. Chair, so
that is part of the business plan that
we're working on right now
that we'll be, be able to bring
back. But what we're,
but what we're hopeful is
that that over this
next 5 to 10 year
period, we will have fully doubled
the size of the School of
medicine.
>> OK. And
uh well, you're gonna come back at
some point because we're gonna have to figure out
where we're really gonna have to target,
target this uh on
the School of Population Health,
on the executives vetoes.
Did we lose any faculty
over that?
>> So, um Mr. Chair,
so the College of
Population Health
originally um
had uh 41
faculty Members, they're
now down to 38
faculty Members. That
reduction was um
was from normal
attrition and retirement.
And, um and so we uh we
also have an RPSP to
support the on for the
ongoing faculty at the
College of Population Health.
Um And uh
we hope to be able to
maintain, you know, the
appropriate number of faculty
for the College of Population
Health. We still remain committed
to having not just accredited
programs but an accredited
school and working with
Dean Collins to get that
ideal size of the faculty.
Um But the direct answer
is um we, we
are at 38 faculty
Members at this moment
um uh down from
a total of 41 but from
attrition's.
>> OK. And,
and why are we doing that in the
RPSP? Why aren't we just
asking for a general
fund request like we
placed before?
>> So Mr. Chair, um we,
we um we took the direction
for which mechanism
to uh seek funds from
that directly from
uh from HED.
>> OK. And then
uh for the Office of
Medical Investigator that you said
you're gonna put that in the RPSB,
but that's operational that should be
in a general fund budget, not an
RPSP. So
plan on moving that to general
fund budget line item
because it's going to be continuing,
not in an RSRPSP.
>> So, so Mr. Chair, um
I think that that the
university would be open
to whichever mechanism
the State thought was most
appropriate to support
the office of the Medical
Investigator. >> And
then do you think that
paying students
in the, in the medical
field to
get their degrees and, and paint
them during that time. Do you think that helps
increase the numbers that we'll be able
to get? A?
And
>> so Mr. Chair,
if you're referring to
providing stipends for
medical students, um I
do believe that that
reducing the debt of
medical students,
does we believe it does help
change the, the kinds of
careers that they May
pick? Um because
there are some medical professional
careers that have much higher
reimbursement than others.
And there is the thought that leaving
medical school with an enormous
amount of debt pushes
individuals into picking career
choices that have higher
reimbursement. And so
by not having as high
debt, that individuals are more
likely to pick the kinds
of other kinds of career choices
so that it won't be as financially
driven. Um because of their
debt, I don't know that it
changes the the
interest in medical school
or the number of applicants. We
have lots of people who are interested
in medical school. Our current
school of medicine has about
a 7% acceptance
rate. Um So there's lots
of individuals that, that are
interested in coming.
Um And so our, our
real goal is
to, to make sure that we give
them the opportunity.
>> So 7% of how
many applicants,
>> um Well, we, well,
we, we accept uh
about a, we accept
100 and 3 to
100 and seven per
year. So I, I don't,
I would have to do the math on that,
but it's
hundreds.
So, and, and, and, and that's,
I'd also like to say Mr. Chair,
that another item that comes up is
our graduate medical education.
So we um again,
it just kind of demonstrates that we
have, we're a very competitive
program nationally.
We accept about 100 and
75 to 100
and 80 new
residents and fellows
into that total
750
we have over 12,000
applicants a year for those
170
spots.
>> Mm
And and so you
think that fixing
a tuition issue will increase
where we put our
doctors, right? What they'll see
in their career if we came back with a
program and said
we're going to expand opportunity
and say, OK, for these
175
and 100 and five,
we come back and we'll pay
that tuition number, but
we're going to tighten some requirements in
some shape or form,
right? So
>> um Mr. Mr.
Chair, yes, I believe that that
could be a very effective
way to help retain
workforce in New Mexico to
create the opportunity to
say um you'll
get reimbursed for
your, your educational
expense in exchange for
service in in
the State of New Mexico.
>> OK. Charles will have to look
at that. Um James,
let me ask you what's the mix of
online student population
in, in in classroom
population at U and
M >> so
Mr. Chairman, um this
is a rough number. We have
about 20% of our
credit hours are delivered
online and, and the
remainder through
um through in person.
>> Why is that number so low?
I mean, nationally
we're seeing 30 40%
of students blended right
half online, half on campus
and we're not seeing that
here. >> Yeah. And, and
of course, the the national number is an
average over many different kinds
of institutions and many
different kinds of learners.
Um And uh
uh if we look
at um certain
degree programs here, for example,
they're fully online, other degree
programs are really
um a mix but are are
blended. We do have
a lot of students who
will um
they're really doing a in-person
undergraduate program, but they'll
take an online course from Yon
A Los Alamos, for example, or
from CNM, whatever
it May be. Uh really,
it's the students making the,
the, you know, selection
based on
what they see as,
as, you know, kind of
best for them. Um
But the other factor that, that
plays in that we want to be really
careful about with our
undergraduates is
that for our student population
coming into UN M
um for the lower level
students, the, the first
year students, the second year students,
um the the
fail rates in online
courses are higher than in
person. Um And
so we really want to be very
careful with our
younger online students,
our less experienced learners
to make sure that they're getting an
experience that allows them to pass
and continue to, to progress
in their degree and also
retain their scholarships. So
scholarship retention
has become a um
a really important metric for
us. Um And,
and so again, what we, we
do see growth in online
uh course taking, it's the
fastest growing
proportion of our, of our
portfolio if you will.
But it's starting from a, from
a smaller base.
>> Yeah, intimate shoes online. It is
just
blowing up and it's the
fastest growing population
they have in that, in that
facility. So >> yeah, the
NMU has been very
aggressive in this space.
>> Totally >> agree. Ok.
>> Thank you guys. Appreciate your time.
Appreciate you, Doctor
Richards. We're going to see you back at some
point. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you.
We're running behind. So
I, I don't want to do like Senator Cervantes
and put a five minute time limit for
questions. So we're
about an hour behind right now,
Charles.
So we're gonna have to play catch up
over the time
frame.
Who's gonna start us
off,
Jennifer? Are you starting
us?
Ok.
>> Good morning, Mr.,
Chair Members of the Committee.
I'm Jennifer Fabian. I'm
one of y'all's economists at the
LFC. I
have a slew of chief,
chief economists here with me.
We have Deo from
tax and Rev Leo Delgado
from D FA and
Michael Morrison from
dot and we're gonna be going
over a long term revenue forecast
with you. We're gonna try to go
fast. Um I'll cut
my portion short. I want to make
sure the Chiefs have a lot
of time to get into the
numbers. Um This a
mountain of work. Um
So I just want to commend the
Craig. We have the Chiefs
here. There's a handful of other economists
here. There are eight other
economists that are not sitting here
that contributed to this work
as well as the forecast last month.
So I just want to give a little
shout out before we get going. But
without further ado, I will pass it
over to, I think
Lucinda is starting us.
Oh, just kidding. It's
Leo.
>> Good morning, Mr. Chair and Members
of the Committee. Thank you for having
us here this morning. My name is Leo
Delgado. I'm the chief economist
for the Department of Finance and
Administration. And
as Jennifer mentioned, we'll be
speaking to the slide deck
titled um
Long term Revenue
Outlook.
And as uh
Jennifer mentioned on
the first uh page
page number two, we'd
like to recognize the effort
of the consensus
revenue estimating group. This is
a joint effort from the
Department of Finance Administration,
the Taxation and Revenue
Department, um
the Department of Transportation
and the Legislative Finance
Committee.
So just to jump in right away
on page three,
we have an introductory
slide and this is
a long term outlook
and it's built on
Moody's and S and P
data, economic
demographic and industry
indicators. And
um it comes with a couple caveats
because it is a very
long term.
Um It's got a long
horizon uh
estimate. So
this estimate does not
include future
recessions, fiscal
and monetary policy
actions, technical
innovations, um
financial energy or
other market
shocks,
geopolitical events,
as well as future State
and federal Legislation.
There's just no reasonable way
to build that into our models
and into our estimates.
So just putting that out
there um right
up front, it is
absent uh
these uh these
events. Uh an
another highlight
here is the forecast
is a long term forecast
and the possibilities and
the volatility around the baseline
grow. Uh The farther
out uh we take the
forecast with that being
said, it is an important
tool um that
we can use to have uh
for leadership to have
discussions uh
about budget and
policy and
for planning purposes.
And the main objective here
is to look at
the most current available data
and surmise. Where is the State
headed? Looking at
long term trends,
the big picture for
the State and I'll be
covering uh economic
indicators as well as a couple
of energy slides
uh on this slide
deck,
moving on to slide five.
This first
slide here is a
US real Gross domestic
product. And
before I uh give
a couple highlights of this
uh this slide,
um I'd just like to say, the
group built a
baseline forecast
and also a high
and low scenario.
The charts here illustrate all
the baseline indicators
and how we constructed the high
and the low is we have
on the high, a better performing
economy than the base.
And on the low side, we
have a um uh
recessionary event
in the near term as
well as some depressed
energy variables built
into the low low
scenario. Uh A
couple of highlights on real
GDP. The national
forecasters, Moody's
and SNP
do not include a recessionary
event in the baseline
and expect moderate
growth for
the country
moving on to slide.
Six. This is uh us
national employment uh
key highlights here is
the um the labor market
has been very resilient for
the country. Uh but
we are seeing
in the data, the moderating
of the labor market
uh as was anticipated
some some time
ago,
moving on to slide
seven here. Now
we're looking at New Mexico
real growth State product
and you have um
uh both data
from Moody's analytics
as well as Un M's
Bureau of
Business and Economic
Research. And both
forecasters expect slow
to moderate growth
in real growth
State product for the
State.
Moving on to slide eight.
This is now a uh a
look at
New Mexico's employment
forecast in the long
run and you have
two
trendlines there. You have a
Moody's analytics trend
line as well as a UN
M Bieber trendline.
The difference why they are
a little different is the
technical one. It's based
on um the the
data sets, both forecasters
used to build the forecast,
their respective forecast.
And so that's the reason
for the differences in those
trendlines. But the
key highlight here are
new, New Mexico has
recovered uh
the employment from the
pandemic as you see the big
dip there and has gained
employment on top
of that. Uh
But the second key highlight
is as we look out towards
the long run of
this uh forecasted
variable. We do
see new Mexico
employment plateauing
and slowing and even
declining a little bit
in the very,
very far out years
of this forecast. And we have
some additional material
to explain what's
influencing that
long term
employment
outlook.
So moving on to slide
number nine, this is a
new Mexico unemployment
rate tracking against the
national
unemployment rate. You can
see it's down from the peaks
of the pandemic
and has been stable for
quite a while and it's projected
to remain pretty
stable in this
um long
term
outlook
on slide. 10.
We have uh us
and New Mexico wages and
salaries forecast
and
uh
the forecasted wages
and salaries have been influenced
by both. Um the recent
pandemic impacts
demographics and
labor market dynamics that
have occurred over
the last couple of years. And
we can see both um uh
the national and
the State wages and
salaries uh
forecasted variables
projected out uh
both with moderate
growth
and um
be before moving on. I I
forgot to highlight one
of the other caveats in my
introductory slide before I mov'e
on to slide. 11 is
one of the other caveats
that we'd like to add to. This
long term forecast is
forecasts do
change. The data
is updated. It's
benchmarked and revised
as new data comes in
as events um
unfold. So
that is another caveat
that goes along with this long
term forecast.
Uh So now moving on to
slide 11, this is something
new we'd like to present to
the Committee and
it goes along with that
long term employment outlook
for the State.
So the long term
outlook, employment for the
State is influenced not
just by the industry
mix and uh the
employment in the specific
sectors of the State,
but it is also influenced
by the long term
demographics of
the State. And there's
uh quite a bit to unpack here
on this slide. So if you bear with
me, I'll go um
uh through a couple of the
variables. And so the
visual on the left is
depicting for you from
Moody's analytics
uh for the State, the
trend for births,
deaths and
migration as
well as uh projected
resident population
growth. And you
can see that in the
near term through the end of the
20 twenties, births
outpace deaths
for the State. But when we get
to the end of the
decade, deaths
outpace births. And
so we get a
um uh uh
net negative
natural increase for
the State. Um
uh The additional
trendline there is
migration and
this is uh uh derived
by historical
patterns, it ebbs and
flows. But
you can see it's pretty
flat and
slightly on the negative
side. And what this
culminates for the State is
those green bars
that in the long
term outlook for the State
stay
flat and
then negative
with um year
over year, uh
population decreases
of less than half of
1% in the out
year for the State.
And this is a
major component
of what influences the
long term outlook for the
State. And
um uh in putting
this together. We also looked
at a uh uh
UN M study,
recent study done
uh for, for
population forecasted
and uh that
UN M study's um
outlook is very,
very similar to this moody's
data for the
State.
Now moving on to
slide 13,
I'll cover a couple of energy
slides. Uh The
uh first slide that you see
here is uh national
um uh wt I
prices from Moody's
S and P and Reist
energy.
And the key highlights on this
slide is oil prices
are very challenging
to predict
they're fickle.
They uh um
mov'e based
on um
oil demand, the new
cycle OPEC plus
inventory, inventory
level changes. And the
group just wants to recognize
that um uh there's
a lot of volatility in
the oil
prices. Um
A couple of other highlights on
this slide uh in the near
term, when we construct
the regular uh
Craig estimate,
the group goes through a um
awaited averaging
process. And we look at where prices
are to build that into
the forecast. And then we
build in reasonable
assumptions in the long run
for this um long term
outlook. Um uh
Most notably
on the long, long term
low low
scenario, uh prices
are depressed down to the
$40 per barrel
range
moving on to slide.
14.
Excuse me,
what you see here is
national production from
both forecasters, both
Moody's analytics and
S MP.
And you can see the
changes here from
um the
forecasters from this year
compared to last year
with both forecasters
estimating national
production for oil
peaking in
2024
and 2027.
This represents an acceleration
of that peak from the
last long term forecast
we presented to you
and
um the
main reas the main
drivers for these peaks
are the same as last
year is the uh
uh current conditions
in the market as well
as the movement towards
more um decarbonisation
policies um
across the
world
moving on to slide
15. And now what you
have here is we're drilling down
to a forecast for New
Mexico oil production.
And what you can see
here is both uh a
trend line for
oil production in New
Mexico as well as
natural gas production in
New Mexico. The
State is currently on
the upslope of these
curves,
but we do see that
there is a leveling
off and a plateauing towards
2029 or 2030
for New Mexico oil
production. This
is in line with the
national forecast
the data, but it
is um uh lagged
a little bit. And the reason
for that is New Mexico
production is has become
a greater share of natural
national production and
much of the growth for
oil is occurring in
the permian. So
the, the the State doesn't
experience that plateau
and peak until a little bit
later.
Moving on to slide.
16 here would like to
add a little bit of context
of what's um some
driving some of these long term
expectations
in the permian you've got
on slide 16 2
charts. Uh The
Permian basin is now
considered a uh a
mature
basin. It's gone
through several phases of
growth um referred to as
shale 1.02
0.0 etcetera.
It's currently in
4.0. The
uh first couple
of um
uh phases were
driven by high production
growth. We saw that
with double digit growth
rates um in production
in the area then
came shell 3.0
which was um
where the industry
shifted and the
focus was on return to
shareholders, mergers
and acquisitions and
the financials um
over the next couple quarters.
Now with the shell
4.0 in the more
mature sector, more
mature basin, uh
what we've been looking
at is much,
much heavier mergers and
acquisitions and consolidation
by the super majors in the
area. And what you
can see on the chart on
the left is the
percentage of
um uh
shell research
resources uh
controlled by these
la the largest
producers. If we look
back at the middle of
the 20 tens,
that share was around
1617
18%.
Now that is
at 33%.
And that's important because
the super majors and the
largest producers
in this shell 4.0
more mature
um phase
have a very
strategic goal of managing
their resources and
inventories over the
long run.
So ensuring those
assets can deliver
both production and
returns for years
and years to come.
The uh
chart on the right
side um
is an update
of the remaining years of
production as estimated
by Ryad
Energy. And
you can see that at
the, at the drilling
pace of 2023
producers could continue to
produce at that pace
for up to
12 years and
even more. So if they
went into
uh some of the uh
different tiers of
acreage
production,
uh moving on to slide
17. And
here, what we have is an update
of this uh second
component that is driving
a lot of the long term
outlook specific, the the
energy variables
from um
reat energy.
And this is the uh
global energy transition.
And what reat Energy and
Analytics Company from
Houston uh derives
is three different
scenarios for
um the path of oil
demand depending
on the path
of uh
decarbonization and
moving towards those
renewables.
In the trendlines, the
higher the trend line,
the slower the
adoption or movement
towards um
away from
fossil fuels
and decarbonize
and slower pace
of decarbonization.
And on the uh the
the lower more
aggressive curves, that's
a faster movement towards
that and a greater pace of
decarbonization
and rice that highlights these
are mainly driven by
a couple of components.
That's the demand
for the oil
demand uh from
global passenger
vehicles, uh
commercial vehicles,
uh demand for
chemicals and of
course government
initiatives for
um uh
uh
this
transition.
And I believe with that, that
concludes my part of
the presentation and I will
pass it to Mr. Morrison
for the State Road Fund.
Thank
>> you.
Thank you. Thank you. Good morning.
My name is Michael Morrison, the
chief economist with NM
dot um
I think most of you have seen this
from last year, so I'll go a little
quick through the introduction.
Um On slide
19, just give a
quick overview of the
State Road Fund. Uh State
Road Fund gets approximately
$550 million a year
in revenues. Uh The
major revenue sources
are going to be our
diesel or special fuels
tax, gasoline
tax, um,
weight, distance tax and
vehicle registration,
but the special fuel and weight
distance tax kind of mov'e together as
commercial traffic.
Our gasoline
tax and vehicle registration
are more tied to
State activity rather than
national commercial
traffic.
And if we mov'e to,
um, slide 20
we have a long run outlook
for the new
Mexico State road fund. As you
see that there's a pretty dramatic
decline in
both our gasoline on
the chart on the left,
there's a dramatic decline in
our gasoline tax and special
fuel tax revenue or diesel tax
revenue. That's main
uh in the short term. A lot of
that is driven by
the increased
adoption of
more fuel efficient
vehicles. Although we're
expecting as the
increased adoption of electric,
electric vehicles to
um accelerate
that decline
in uh fuel
revenue
on the left that actually
translates to a pretty
or on the right. I'm sorry, translates
to a pretty significant decline
in in State road fund
revenues overall.
Uh We're looking at, I
believe
it's actually on a later slide
going into the uh
declines. On
the
next slide, we have a slide
21. We have the compounding factor that not
only we're expecting road fund revenues
to decline quite
dramatically. We also
are expecting road fund uh
construction costs to
increase pretty dramatically. Uh
Looking at about 100 and
38% between
2024 and
2050 for increasing road
costs pair that
with the decline in road fund
revenue of about 14%.
Um So
that uh the
combined effect is looking
uh pretty dire
for road construction going
forward.
Um
Looking uh to the next slide in
slide, 22 kind
of highlighting some of the major
issues. Uh The major
one or the biggest issue is the
road funds reliance on
um fuel taxes
for a major revenue
sources. That's over
40% of our State road
fund is uh both
on, on fuel taxes
itself.
That's
the decoupling
between, um,
fuel consumption and road
use is becoming
a major issue for
the road fund going forward.
Um Right now, mainly
driven not by electric vehicles
but by increased fuel efficient.
So it's 40 mile per
gallon vehicles and 40 plus
mile per gallon vehicles are really,
what's the
major impact at this point?
Um New Mexico
also is worth pointing
out, we have the fourth lowest
uh gasoline
tax in the nation. The
average with our tax
at 17 cents per gallon. The
average for the US is
32.4 cents per
gallon. And that is
set to increase. The
average is set to increase every
year as several states have
indexed their gas tax
to the
inflation rate. If we
look at diesel taxes at
21 cents per gallon, we're the ninth
lowest in the nation. Again,
the average is 34
cents per gallon and that
increases every
year as many
states have indexed their
taxes to inflation.
In addition
to the gassing tax, our registration
fees are also
among the lowest in the
country.
All of this has a large
impact on our road
fund revenue and our ability to fund
uh future road construction,
maintenance and
repair
and as to mitigate
that, we're looking at several different
options. There's ideas
of additional registration fees on
electric vehicles or
other um
different types of charges as well
as we're
investigating the
use of uh road user
charges which are been
adopted in
Hawaii,
um
Oregon, Utah
and Virginia. And we're looking at
those programs to see how they operate
and evaluate whether or not
they are successful or something that would
be beneficial to New
Mexico at this time.
And I believe that
is it for my portion of the
presentation. So I'll pass it up to
Lucinda.
>> Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Members
of the Committee. Thank you so much
again for having us here this
morning. I am Lucinda
Sito, the chief economist
at the Taxation and Revenue
Department. And I'm gonna
take you through the General
Fund impact distilling
what my colleagues have been sharing
with you into what that means
at the general fund level.
So if you will turn with me
to side
24
we have here the
General fund outlook out to
fiscal year 50
we have this in levels
and I will
reiterate what my colleague
um Leo Delgado said, which
is, don't, don't
be held to these numbers.
These are, this is just to
look at the trajectory
where we, we see
um the different
components of General Van
Gog. Um
And you'll see there are the three
scenarios that
um doctor um
Delgado laid out
and I will not um
reiterate that here,
but I will point out
um some differences from
last year, which is,
we are now benchmarked to
our fiveyear forecast that
we did in August. And I want to thank
Ishmael Torres working with the
LOC to do
this presentation after that
forecast because that makes our
job much
easier to build off
that fiveyear forecast.
So that's one change from last
year. Um
And to reiterate
that the a lot
of the driver of this long-term
forecast is the oil and
natural gas forecast,
which we did in collaboration
this year with the State Investment
Council and
underlining that is a
lot of the work that
Ryad our national
input has
pointed out. And
again, we're looking at a
turning point for oil
and natural gas production,
turning in fiscal year
2030
we will talk about the impacts of
that as we go through the
slides
while we have the direct impact
to our severance taxes
and to our federal and State
royalties, we also
have an impact to Gross
receipts tax and personal income
tax and corporate income
tax with any change
in oil and gas production.
Those have also been
um mild into this
long term forecast.
So on side
25 I'm not
gonna detail this too
much, but we've laid out that
the important point is we
assume no changes to the
tax code, both at the State
and the federal level.
And we assume no changes
in the population outlook
or labor
participation.
If you'll turn with me to slide
26
we'll get into a little bit
of a deep
dive in what the general
fund scenario outlooks
mean. And here
we're showing the growth
scenarios
and one
change that we have
from last year is we
have a trendline
that centers the
scenarios around
what has the general fund growth
been like? Um In
the past years?
This year, we're doing a 25
year trend line. Last
year, we did a 22 year trend
line and why we did that
was we're looking out 25
years. So this trend
line looks back 25
years to to center
where, where we've been and
where we're going and
you'll notice that trendline in
red on the top graph
is at 4.6%.
And except for
the high scenario, none
of the scenarios
are touching that
um growth rate.
Now, part
of the growth rate being so high
is the growth rate from fiscal
year 2022 and
2023 being so
high as we recover
from the pandemic.
But the point here
is that
in the long term >> forecast, Mr.
Chair, can I just sorry,
I apologize. Can you just
remind me of the page that we're on again,
please? >> Absolutely,
Mr. Chairman Representative
Small. We're on slide
26.
>> I was one behind
I a
thank you. Thank you Mr.
Chair.
>> So
we are not looking at a
growth rate
in out to 2050
that matches our
past 25
years.
Now,
I'm gonna center on the
blue line on the top graph,
which is the baseline
scenario.
It, even though we're
not at that trendline, we are
still at a very strong growth
at 3.5%
going into the, the
20 forties.
But then you'll see
this dip in fiscal
2046
that is attributable
to the fact
that with the change in
oil and gas production,
we no longer meet the
fiveyear averages
with the emergency school tax
and with the federal loyalties, and that
dip is exactly when
in this current forecast,
given the current situation of
the data we have, that would
be the point where we drop
below the five year
average.
The second graph on the
bottom. We also want
to highlight that
when we adjust for
inflation and we
look at the growth rates in real
terms, the
high scenario on the baseline
say above 0%
there's no contraction
until the very
later years which we would
we would not hold to as,
as Leo Delgado pointed out
much will change. And
only the low scenario would
we see
contraction
if we turn now to slide
27.
This is a deep dive into the
components of General
Fund.
And last year, we,
we reiterated that we
have this drop in severance
tax, direct
revenue and
offsetting what that is
the growth in investment
revenue. And you'll see
that in the top graph,
the yellow represents
revenue from investment
income and
severance tax is in
gray. But
what we taking that
out further is when
you look at the growth rate of investment
revenue, it not
only
absorbs the job in severance
taxes, but then it starts
to exceed
income taxes
in 2030. That's
the orange line. And
then by 2040
this forecast would have
it exceed
Gross receipts tax revenue
becoming the
number one source of
revenue for the general
fund.
Now,
there are of course
with any revenue source
subject to volatility.
But importantly that
revenue source because of
the five year average
structure of the market value of
those funds that has
helped to insulate the general
fund from that revenue
source. So
after years of
investing in these funds,
the general fund is
now benefiting
from the stability of having
that be the
number one revenue source.
Um in this
outlook,
another important point is investment
income is not, it's not
tax direct tax
revenue. So it's another
buffer for the tax burden
to New Mexicans by
relying on a source that has
been built on years
of of investments by
the State.
Finally, the bottom
graph, we just want to highlight
that again, the yellow
line is the vest growth
income. It
will, it's very strong
right now. It does
have a declining positive
growth rate. And
that's because a lot
of the inputs into
the core of these funds
is oil and gas. So
that um
contributes to that declining
um, growth rate, but it
is still positive
and still strong. It
averages right now in this
forecast in the 20 thirties
at 8% in
the 20 forties, we would have it at
4%
on sign 28. Just
to conclude
again, we show the levels here
compared to the trend.
And um
I'll reiterate that we have
no recessions in
this long term forecast.
The graph here shows
previous recessions in the gray
bars. We know there's going to be
recessions. We know there's going to be other
shocks, both positive
and negative and
to remember that there will be
volatility around the trend
line. But
as I turn it over to my
colleague, we feel
this is very important to
show the trajectory
of State General Fund
revenues for for the many
decisions on policy
and budget that need to be made.
And with that, I will turn it over to
my colleague,
Jennifer.
>> Thank you, Mr., Chair Members of the
Committee. Thank you to the Chiefs.
I'm gonna kind of pivot us
into a little bit of a conversation
about putting this
revenue forecast into
a policy lines, putting this
revenue forecast that they just went
over with a little bit of
budget discussion and talk briefly
about why we do these long
terms um for
you all as as
the budget makers of the
State. So
we're gonna be on um Tab
B and your binders. Now we're shifting
over to the LFC presentation.
Uh Tab B. It looks like
this
balancing mid to long term
revenues and
expenditures.
So on page two
of that presentation,
just
kind of an overview of why long
term planning is so important. Some
of the uses of it, it's touted
as the best practice
from fiscal
policy groups um
kind of budget watchdogs
throughout the country such as
pu charitable trust, State,
fiscal health project, Government
Finance Officers Association,
Moody's and others
in New Mexico has really been touted
as a leader in this
practice. We
have a
Craig that is
across um branches of
government. We do
short term stress testing, we
do long term, we're really kind of
leaders in this long
term um
kind of budgeting and revenue
forecasting uh
practice.
So why do we engage in long term
planning for both
the budget and for
revenues? When you guys
only budget for one
year, there's a lot of
reasons for this. Um A
couple are here laid out
here for you. We're
trying to avoid
budgeting by crises
and by surprise.
So while we hope
the kind of low scenario
that was laid out by the Chiefs
does not occur, you
at least know now what
is in the realm of possibility.
So if something like that were to occur,
it's not a surprise. We
have contingency plans,
there are things in your back pocket you
can do to help hedge against
those things and hopefully
invest in things that will avoid that
altogether.
We can strategically implement
services or tax changes.
So knowing revenues might
look like in the long run, be
able to phase in tax
cuts or phase in tax
increases. Should we need
them also looking at
budgeting, how do we
match budget needs
to the revenue
forecast?
We can also try to
avoid uh
committing to unsustainable
funding levels. And Charles is
gonna go into this a little bit later,
looking at the full scope of
liabilities and competing
priorities into the future,
such such as Medicaid prison
population, school enrollment,
stuff like that, that kind
of outside of the legislators
control but impact the budget
in really large
ways.
And all of these kind of prompt questions
that are integral to solving fiscal
problems is the
is the budget balance now,
is it gonna be balanced in the future?
That's a constitutional
requirement that the the
budget is balanced. So looking
at future revenues,
balancing them with budgets
and what does changing our State
trajectory actually look
like and require,
how do we try to
set ourselves up to achieve the
high end of this
revenue forecast? How can we
encourage higher wages? How can
we encourage the economy
um to grow at the
rate that would bring us closer to
that high-end trajectory
versus the baseline
or the low
scenario?
So moving on to page
three, it's
not an LFC
econ presentation without
the roller coaster graph.
Um So this is our revenues
and our budget growth year over year
for the last 20 years.
And this really illustrates why this
planning is so important for a State
like New Mexico, you
can see our revenues going
from negative to positive in one
year, multiple times in this
forecast or in this
history and why
it's so important that we
start to plan for these
swings going
on to page four. This is the
same graph just
expanded out to 60 years.
We've recently compiled a 60
year for or history of
both budget and revenue
growth. And I want to point
out a couple of things on this
graph.
If you go back to kind of the late sixties,
early seventies into
the eighties, this would have been a wonderful
time for you all to be legislators.
We were looking at double digit
growth in revenue and budgets
year over year, over year for about
15 years. Then
we had a dip in fy
83 and this
is kind of a, this
is an example of that budgeting by
surprise, they went
from having over
20% revenue growth
to negative growth and had
to cut budgets the very next
year. I don't think
we're in that position now, this is
because there was not enough reserves
to cover a downturn
even though it was temporary, they
rebounded to double digit growth the
very next year, they still
had to cut budgets back
then. I think
a lot of the things you all have been doing
and we're going to talk about this in a little bit
have avoided this type of
situation in the future. So
I just wanted to point that out
then we kind of enter into the eighties and
nineties where it's pretty stable.
This is kind of this regular
churn that most states experience
where revenues are pretty stable
between five and 10%.
Uh relying on pitt G
RT property taxes.
If you're another State and
you're kind of spending what you're earning.
It's very consist, those growth
rates are matching each other.
But then you see our State enters
into the two thousands and
this is where Permian
oil kind of explodes.
Fracking is introduced. Some new
technological advancements really
bring the Permian online
and our State becomes more
reliant on oil and gas in this
period. And you can
see that the roller coaster is
much more volatile in the last
20 years than we've seen in the
last 60.
You can see a couple more budget
cuts. Four out of the
five in this entire history
are in the two thousands.
And I think this is really what brought
to to light this need
for long term planning, this
need for contingencies, this
need to income smooth
across these
bumps across these peaks and
troughs um to
really avoid that budgeting
by surprise. Um
scenario, I do
want to note in fy 25
we do forecast negative
revenue growth. It's negative 0.2
it's very, very small
but you all have avoided
um having to cut budgets.
A lot of this revenue decrease was
also by design, you cut a lot
of taxes, recognizing
the surplus that you all have.
Um But I do just want to point that out
that it's one of the only times
we see negative revenue
without a budget
reaction.
Moving on to page five. I'm not
going to spend a lot of time here.
Um This is just
showing what oil and gas revenue
looks like in the State right now.
Um 15.2
billion of taxes
is generated out of New Mexico, oil
and gas. Um
Almost 3 billion goes to the feds
a small share about a billion to
locals. And the rest gets
kind of div divvied up between
State um funds
and this is really a strategy you all have
implemented by not putting it all in
the general fund, putting it in other
places, building the early
childhood trust fund, um
putting it into the permanent
funds that's really gonna help
in the long run.
Moving on to page
six. I
pulled out our short term stress
test just to show
again that in a short term
shock, the State is
in a really, really good position
to weather a storm
that lasts a couple of years.
The reserves are really high
budgets haven't matched
revenue growth,
nonrecurring spending has,
has ticked up to kind of
um fill in some, some gaps
and some critical needs so
that might be eroded in different
scenarios. Um
but in a really good position in the
short run. However, the
one of the reasons we do the long run
is that these types
um of
shocks could last a long
time and we look kind
of in the long run to see what
if it's not just a storm.
What if the economy just
doesn't match our expectations,
then what do we do? And I think
this is the real key to
these long term estimates
is how do we match budget
expectations over
25 years?
Uh Not just in a couple of
years in the short
run on page seven,
there's a couple
um kind of
playbook options. You all
have to weather a short term
storm such as
seeking federal relief if,
if this is a nationwide crisis
like COVID um
canceling fund transfers,
swapping revenues, sweeping cash
balances and you really
have set yourself up
to not have to cut agency
budgets in a short
term um scenario.
If, if something hits, if
something is is not great,
you've built yourself a really,
really nice runway
to make decisions to change
some things, to use
reserves to cover any
kind of downturn or to cut
nonrecurring budgets without
hitting agencies. And
it's really, it's been very, very
successful. However, we
have to look long term at budget
obligations in light
of the revenue forecast in order
to um set
the State up for for future
generations
quickly. On page eight.
I wanted to compliment what
Lucinda had already kind of gone
over. Um
but kind of the
rise of investment income and
how that's come about
Senate Bill 26 a couple of
years ago, basically
capped oil and gas revenue to the
general fund and stuck a
lot of it in the permanent fund
which then spins off revenue
that comes back to the general fund.
So I put two scenarios
here. The one on the, on
the left is our current
outlook of just
oil and gas revenues plus
that investment earnings
and what that looks like. And
in the middle graph is, if
you had not passed Senate Bill
26 what we would look
like. And I want to point out
that in the low scenario,
both would be declining,
that insulating effect from the
general fund
would be eroded very quickly in a
low scenario. And that
mechanism of putting money
away, um,
doesn't work as well when there's not
excess revenue to put
away. So you see there's declines
in both low scenarios.
However, if you look at the high
and the baseline, we've bought
ourselves a lot of
time, um,
oil and gas is going to decline, it
will eventually hit the general
fund.
However, you buy yourself about
15 years before seeing
any declines and even
then those declines are offset
by those increased interest
earnings flowing into the general
fund. Something
to point out in that middle graph in
all three scenarios. Had you
not passed Senate Bill 26?
You would be looking at revenue
declines by
the forties by 20
forties. That would be a
very, very scary place to be sitting
here looking at right now. So
I commend you all for passing that
and I think it's already been
showing uh
reward and you're reaping the
benefits of that. Now,
um on the right hand side, this
is just general fund growth
adjusted for inflation.
Um With those
two scenarios kind of laid out for
you. The blue
is the current situation.
Post Senate Bill 26.
The red lines are if
you had not passed Senate Bill
26. And again, you can
see those solid lines. The
blue one, we have a lot more positive
growth. You've really extended
the life of these revenue streams
into the general
fund.
And then lastly, um
an issue that's been uh kind
of brought to light by doing these
long-term forecasts is
the erosion of personal income
tax really all tax
revenue by an
earmark to the retiree health
care distribution. Um
Retiree health care fund
distributions from the tax dispense
fund grows at 12%
a year. As Lucinda
mentioned, none of our revenue
streams are growing at 12% a
year. Um So this is
quickly going to overtake other
revenue streams by
2072.
All personal income tax
will be going straight into the retiree health
care fund if this is not
addressed. Um
Another kind of
interesting tidbit is by
fy 50 the end of this
forecast period. This
distribution, this earmark of
revenue to the retiree health
care fund will be 5%
of all general fund revenue.
So this isn't really a pressing
issue at the moment. It's a very
small amount of money right
now. Um
But 12% a year, it's gonna
compound fairly quickly. And
you can see in that graph, it really picks
up pace near the end of
this forecast period.
Um It becomes a problem.
So definitely something we want to be
looking at shoring up.
Um This
growth rate essentially in figuring
out how to preserve
these revenues in the
future.
So with that, I'll pass it over to Charles
to talk more about budget
scenarios.
>> Thank you. If you could turn to slide
11.
So if the the long
term revenue
growth scenario calls
for uh projects
about a 3% growth,
what if you kept spending
growth in line with that over
the long term,
and what we
modeled out here is you would have
continued uh
surpluses that you
could use in a very significant
way for nonrecurring
um investments or
for savings.
Um You
know, overall we don't
have a lot of uh
major budget
pressures. When
you think about other states that
are growing in
population.
We've got a declining K
12 enrollment. Uh We've
got a declining early childhood
enrollment um
at a pretty significant level in
terms of the number of kids.
Um We, we've
got a flat
if modestly
maybe turning the corner
uh higher education and
enrollments uh but
still down significantly from
where they were um
within the past 5 to 7
years. Uh
Medicaid, long
term is going to be a
budget Packman in my view,
under any scenario,
whether you're doing well
economically. And the
federal government says that it's great,
you can help pay for more of
this. Um And
that's not enough uh to
be offset by uh
lower uh
enrollment in Medicaid
because uh we've got
coverage policy initiatives
to try to keep everybody who's
on even if they don't qualify
on Medicaid that's going on
right now.
Um
Or if we're not doing well
economically, then those roles
will continue to swell. And
under any scenario, the long
term demographic
forecast is for a
continued aging population
that is of low
income and that is a very
fast growing portion
of the overall Medicaid
budget. Uh those individuals
will cost, you know, 20 or
$30,000 to cover a
year. Whereas kids or
family uh
working age, family Members
May be five or $6000
a year in terms of cost.
So this
low budget growth um
scenario is
potentially realistic.
But that means Medicaid takes
up like the 3%
or 2.5% of
it and there's nothing left for
anybody else. And you're likely going
to be looking at um
needing to reduce other
budgets in order to afford
to pay for that. You wouldn't be
in a position to be able to reduce
K 12 for obvious
reasons. Um
So a real crowding
out of other potential
um budget priorities
that the, the Committee and the legislature
May have.
Um
as I've told many of
you, uh
lots of stuff is affordable
today and what's important
about these next couple of graphs
is um
if the long term forecast
is for 3% the
question is, do you want to spend
it all now and
accelerate the date that you're
building budgets that grow at
only 3% or
are there strategies and ways that
we can forestall
that and spread this surplus
out over a longer
period of time? And
you know, a 6%
growth rate allows you
to, to
carry that out through,
you know, fy
32 fy
33
Fy 34
smaller growth, uh
smaller gaps
um in spending. But
if you turn to
slide
um
813,
uh we would be in
that scenario very
soon, you know, starting and
really building a budget for
fy 27.
Uh And what's important about this
scenario of only 14%
growth is
that agency
budget request that you can see on
slide 14 that have come
in on September 1st,
remember this excludes
the seg and
categorical in schools and
excludes
uh instruction in
general and RPS PS in higher
education. That's like
most of the budget.
Uh those requests
came in at
a $790
million increases that agencies
wanted or about
18% increase.
So not even
affordable under the high spending
scenario,
which means we've got a
challenge this fall to figure out
how to come up with a more
manageable uh growth
slide. 15, we're
starting to try to model
out um
different uh long
term or midterm. I
call it uh
liabilities.
Um and also scenarios
what if you were to have a more
sustained
um growth
trajectory for
compensation that
everybody could rely
on of like maybe
4% um
over the next couple of years. How much
does that cost?
Um What are some
things that we're seeing over the
horizon
for uh liabilities
like uh K 12 plus
within the the public
school budget uh where
districts are taking up the State
on a longer school year at a higher
level than was
an was anticipated.
Um
continued investments
in DD waiver, do another
rate increase. And then how much will
that cost on a compounding
basis over the next
couple of years? That wasn't
part of the Medicaid request
this year. But there's a lot of
discussion about the need
to continue that
uh the ongoing cost
of eliminating the DD
waiver. Um And
what we're seeing in terms of
utilization and cost with
that important uh priority
population going over
time and then
just basic
Medicaid uh
medical inflation.
Um And
then, you know, as a policy,
the states jumped into
indexing our
me some of our Medicaid
rates to Medicare,
which means that when Medicare
increases theirs, there's
gonna, if you want to maintain that
100 and 50%
uh ratio, then
you're gonna have to be putting
more dollars into
the system as well as
putting more money in because
uh a good thing is
happening is our per capita
income is growing at a faster
rate than, than the rest of the
country. But the federal
government's telling us we need
to, to pay more for
Medicaid. So we've modeled those
things out and you can see very
quickly uh almost
hitting that 6%
cap right out of the gate
um for fy 26.
And, and they're growing
pretty significantly in terms
of the overall cost
um in the out
years.
So the real
question that I
think the Committee
should start um And you
have been this interim and last
interim, really thinking about
is long term, 3%
seems to be a little bit on the,
the low end of
being able to afford the things
that we might need
to do and the things that you might
want to do. So the
question is, how do
you create an
environment, an economic
environment for growth
above that, that
could be underwind
um Tax policy
changes that you've done over the
past 30
years, um which would
be uh challenging.
Uh But it also could
be making sure that
in the investments that you're making
are in fact making
our economy grow at a much
better rate that we're not
losing colledge
educated uh
young people to our surrounding
states. They're actually staying here
working starting new
businesses. Uh You
have more of their, their
peers become uh
highly educated
uh whether that's uh from
the trades uh to
other post-secondary
um types of investment.
So those types of
investments in making sure they
count and they really work
are going to be a key midterm
to long term strategy
um for not building budgets
that are a percent lower than
what they were under the Martinez
administration during good
times. The
other is to resist
spending all of the much
surplus that you've got right
now. Uh that acts
as a first buffer
uh for uh
any economic shocks.
Uh If you're not spending at all, it's
not even in reserves, it's just
you don't have it.
Um And then use
some of these uh short
term surpluses
uh to invest in
things like the grow
where you're investing for
the, for the
midterm uh as
opposed to the severance tax,
permanent fund, which is investing
for the long term. The grow
allows you a new strategy
to make sure that those
um appropriations
count that the agencies
are, in fact demonstrating that they
can get better results and
deserve recurring um
appropriations to
get into the base budget
um going forward.
And then there's other opportunities
through uh
investing uh
this surplus in
things that can set us up.
Um For other types
of successes, those
growth rates that you saw in the
19 seventies.
If you go around the State, there's
a lot of infrastructure built at
about that time that's
coming to end of useful
life. So that's gonna be an
important conversation
in terms of using some of the
surplus for uh
replacement of our
medical school building as a really
good example of that.
Um And it's a, that's
a project that needs to happen.
But we also need to be
strategic in thinking about
uh what do we want that middle school
school to look like um
for the next 40 years and
what do we want it to, to produce?
So a lot of uh
really solid opportunities
and a lot of opportunities
for uh still pretty
healthy uh budget
growth uh to meet, meet
the plans uh as
well as test out new ideas.
Uh but make sure that they're going to work
before building them into
base budgets and do a
lot of other
capital outlay um
investments in
the short term with that Mr.
Chairman. We'll be happy to answer
any questions,
ok. We'll start off uh Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and thank you to all of you for
the information. And uh
uh one
concern that, that
I do have
is uh we
have seen
what we have with the additional
revenues, but also
with uh some of
the safeguards.
But the one that really concerns
me is the State Road
Fund
and
one of the parts
that is we
need to come up with
somehow a way
that we can improve,
you know, the funding to this
program plus also
keeping the higher
recurring revenue
and it really needs
it. And if you
look at that pie
chart that
you have on
the
what, what's the page in
that 1919.
Ok.
Um If you could expand
a little bit more on that
other.
>> Certainly. Um Mr. Chair
Senator uh for
the other sources,
the, a lot of that is gonna
be
um
miscellaneous transactions associated
with registration
of um and other
MBD uh
transactions. I believe that
also includes our interest
revenue
um
oversize, overweight
taxes. Um Our
trip tax, which is kind of
the alternative to the
weight distance tax for those who
aren't registered with
the national
registration plan.
Um
I'm forgetting others. I'm trying to remember
all the other revenue streams.
We had the,
um,
I
overweight.
>> It's, it's all right.
We
can,
I think the, the point
here is that
we have hit a roadblock
when it comes to the special
fuel and to
gas, we have
tried many
initiatives
and uh so if
we're going to do something
else, I guess we would have
to look at some of the other
components of the pie
chart, you know, to be
able to build on
revenue.
Now, the other part
that I might be
missing some is on the next
page
is so,
uh in
1995
we had a
66
cent gas tax
repeal.
And then here you're showing in
1996 that, that was
the last time there was
an adjustment for fuel
adjustment. I mean, for
inflation adjustment.
Oh,
I'm, I'm not understanding that
part.
>> I guess that I apologize
for the
confusion. That was just the last
time that we had any adjustment at
all to the gas tax
was in 1986 with
the repeal, but
it hasn't been changed
as a rate, um,
at all since
then.
>> Uh, well, Mr.
Chairman and Members, we
lost six cents and
we haven't recovered that at
all, you know,
since we were at that
base. And,
uh, throughout the years,
uh, you know, uh, looking at
what that would have generated
from, uh both
special fuels and also
from the regular gas
tax. It's a
lot of
revenue that has been
not there because
of that. And
the other part is
so just
what we're facing today,
of the cost of
construction
and the cost of
maintenance and
even with equipment,
we're, we're
gonna have problems,
you know, we really need to look
at this and whatever it
takes. You know, if it
is Mr.
Chairman and Charles, if we
need to put a group
together to
come up with even more
of a
another think tank
of what New
Mexico citizens will accept
and not accept. But um
the important part is that
the need is there,
the other part that really
worries me about is
um as our conditions
of our freeways
and State
roads, you know,
that increases liability
to the State.
So with that in
mind, uh you know,
I don't mind
putting some time into
it and working with anyone
or, you know, from the
Transportation Committee, but
we really need to come up with
something that eventually
and we have tried by
all means, we have
tried a five cents gas
tax. We have tried a four cent.
We have even tried a one
cent with a sun
cent fire and
just for some reason or
the other, the
RJ.
But we're beyond that,
the need is there that we
do need to have that revenue
for just
to be safe, you
know, and that's all
I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, >> Senator
Sheer.
>> Thank you Mr.
Chair.
So
I just started writing me some notes
here. Uh But
the big thing
is for us more than
them.
Um
So an increase in, in electric
vehicles yet New
Mexico clearly doesn't have the
infrastructure for that
clearly. And we're not
gonna have it unless we spend
a heap of money. And
even if we do that, I don't think
there's enough copper in the
world
to deal with
that.
So I know that both
Ford and Toyota
have have, if they
haven't stopped, they've dramatically
cut back on their ev
production A,
they can't sell them b
even if you can sell them, they can't
charge them, ok?
Especially outside of
Albuquerque, ok.
And you get outside Albuquerque,
downtown Broadview doesn't have
any charging stations.
Um Neither does
Shiprock. So I think
those are, those are things
that we've built into
here.
That, I don't think are going to
happen
because they
can't. All right.
Now, will there be something else?
Maybe Toyota's talking
about a whole another
fuel
hydrogen for, for
everything
and whether
that happens or not, I don't
know, but that's where they've turned
their, their resources
to. If it's hydrogen,
you get hydrogen, the, the most
efficient way to get hydrogen
is from natural gas. Yes,
you can break up water
molecules.
But that's expensive.
Uh So
is, is natural gas
really going to go away?
I don't know, did we even
consider anything
except for reducing
the temperatures which I can't find
here now?
Ok.
OK.
But
there could be a lot of other ways.
Uh for example, uh
technologies, technologies
always change,
always change. We
have, we,
we could have been the center
of the universe for carbon capture
and sequestration.
We intentionally
chose not to do
that. That's going to happen in other
places. It's not going to happen in New
Mexico. So
we have decided
that we don't want a new industry
that we want to live on oil and gas until
oil and gas dies
when we had an opportunity to
do something else,
carbon capture. The the
goal appears to be
to reduce the, the the carbon
in the atmosphere.
In words,
in actions, the goal is to
destroy oil and gas.
Well, we don't have to destroy it.
We can deal with it because new
technologies are always coming,
always
um and
yet
we're getting in our own
way.
Um,
part of what gets in our own
way is that
I believe we overregulate
ourselves. I don't think we overtax ourselves.
We tax ourselves in such a confusing
way that most,
uh, uh, location
people that are trying to figure out where to put their
new business. Look
at our tax code and go,
I don't know what that even means.
Yes. The economic development
department can tell us about all
of the cool things that they'll give
us. But
not,
but they're not going to do it.
So,
um,
and then the last thing that I have
here is
so
revenues coming off
investments is going to be
great, be our biggest thing.
Yay. But as soon
as we get anywhere near that,
we're gonna raid the permanent fund again
because that's what we always do again.
Not y'all. We
raid the permanent fund
and then we destroy
the power of compound interest.
And so these are really warnings
to us. There are
things that we can do to
avoid
this,
this scenario where we don't have
any population and we don't have
any industry at all because
we've destroyed oil and
gas
and so
warning we can do
it. We don't have to shut ourselves
down
>> all good.
He shut himself down. I
guess
we're running about 30 minutes
behind. So we're gonna have to play some catch
up. Representative
Sarana.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for your
presentation. I have a
question. Um I'm looking
at slide 14 for
LFC.
So,
um
we have
on the left side,
um
All other agencies
is that's where our AG
ed I falls
under, right? It seems
kind of limited there when we think
about all the things
we're looking at, especially for
water. You know,
we are in a drought.
Climate change is
hurting us everywhere.
Um Our quality of groundwater
isn't great. We don't
have mapping, we don't even know where all the
water is. It seems like
we need to be putting more, more
money into that area.
Um Is,
is this,
it, it doesn't seem like we've
ever really funded them
well enough, but I
mean, water is critical,
right? Um Right now we
have, we're using a lot of water with
ag but that goes back into the
water cycle produce. We're using a whole
lot of water with produce, but that doesn't
go back into the water cycle. So we're,
we're leaving a whole section where we
can't ever use that water. So
I, I just worry about
water and what's gonna happen in our
State with all these new
regulations coming down from the federal
government. Is that something
we can look at or?
>> So, Mr. Chairman
Representative, you have
grown those natural resources
budgets at a disproportionately
high rate compared to the
general fund growth overall.
It's hard to see it in
this graph, but we've
got other ones that where we can show
you. But,
um, you know,
in the out years, if
we blow through this
surplus too fast,
then it's gonna be harder
to make those a priority.
Uh, when you've got like
Medicaid and schools
kind of being held harmless and
they're like the biggest part
of the budget. So that's,
that was my point about the date
at which we kind of cross
that threshold of
needing to live off of the
uh just the revenue growth
of only about 3 to
3.5% a year
um and figuring
out how to spread the surplus
out. >> All right,
thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
>> you. Just remember that slide is
agency requests, not
LFC recommendations.
Representative Dixon.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Um I will,
I'm just trying to keep my
questions to a few.
Um
what
um
what on page
14 of the
LFC
uh presentation,
there's a table
um And I'm wondering
if you could fill
me in on what is
encompassed in the commerce and
industry
uh line,
>> Mr. Chairman. So this would be
like tourism and economic
development would be the two big ones
there.
>> And then um Mr.
Chair and, and director
and I noticed that the largest
percent change
um is health care and
communities.
And what is the,
the number one driver
in the health care and
communities?
>> Two of the, the biggest
request in that particular
arena are from the Health care
Authority at uh
250
to 260 million, I
believe. And you're going to hear
a preview of their budget
request uh this
week. Uh and the other
big one is actually from the early
childhood um
department that requested
about 100 and 63
million from the general fund in
addition to all the money that
it gets from the trust fund and from
the school permanent Fund
um primarily for childcare
assistance.
>> Um Mr. Chair and
director, I'm sorry. So,
um
E ce CD is requesting
an additional
160.
Ok. And that's in the
health care and communities line.
That's correct.
Thank you. Um
The other questions that I
had um are
related to
options for growing
revenue. Um
And I think on page
16,
uh there's a, there's a
line about
uh or the first bullet
is foster economic
growth to be current
expectations.
Um And I'm just
wondering if
that
is the
main way
in which or sort
of the main other option that
we have for growing
revenue or if there's
something else that we're looking
at?
>> I mean, the other option is
to undo some of the
tax code changes that you've done
in terms of growing revenue.
Uh The other option is to
not save as much for tomorrow
and become more reliant
on oil and gas is a
revenue
strategy.
>> Um And Mr.
Chair and director
and in terms of
um fostering economic
growth and, and going in that
direction, do we
have
um
models that we can look
at,
>> Mr. Chairman? Um
I can't think of any specific
models other than
investment strategies
to basically boost
the educational attainment
of our um
population.
Um Again, through retention
strategies, we're exporting a lot
of, of folks as
well as, um,
answering those, what if scenarios
that we've talked about, what would it take
to get our K 12 to
the national average or
uh, bachelor's degree,
uh, degree production to the national
average? We haven't looked
into, um, some
of our graduate, uh, type
of work, but I think that's
important as well. Uh,
in addition, you're going to be hearing
uh, about the investments you've
been making to upskill
our workforce um
through everything from
trades to certification
uh type programs.
>> Ok. Um Thank
you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Hochman Vhi.
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I know
we're short on time. I just
wanted to echo
the comments of my colleague,
Senator Gonzalez as
it relates to the
road fund and dwindling
revenues from the gas tax.
However, all
hope is not lost. Mr. Chairman,
we have presented the legislature
with multiple proposals
that would allow us to make
up for some of those revenues, whether
it relates to excise tax,
percentages, to
uh registration fees
for electric vehicles, to
surpluses on charging
fees and times. There's
lots and lots and lots
of ideas
out there that we will
and should be considering
um as it relates to
uh my colleague
from the Senate, Senator Scherer,
I I believe
Senator we can actually walk and
chew gum at the same time,
it's going to take a combination of
many of these industries to solve
these issues that we have as it
relates to infrastructure and
transportation. Um
We are capable of doing
all of the above. It's
just gonna take
a 60 day,
a very, very busy 60
day policy,
legislative Session
and uh openness
by our colleagues
to really dig
down these proposed
and figure out a way to make up for
this revenue. It can be done.
We also have a lot of help
coming from the federal government is it relates
to electric vehicle charging
infrastructure and we
need to set up our communities to
take full advantage of both those
discretionary grant funds
and also the formulaic funds. So
thank you Mr. Chair
>> and we're going
to have to
push.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be
really quick. Uh
The electric charging station
in Socorro, New Mexico cost the
taxpayers the city of
Socorro over
30,000
uh because the
revenue
for every dollar
uh they brought in it cost them
three.
So
I don't know what the answer is
except it's not working
in rural New Mexico because
of the cost of electricity.
So that's one thing.
Um Mr.
Chairman,
when we look at the
personal income tax
2.2
billion
uh coming in
personal income tax, 14%
of that is from oil and
gas,
uh G RT 4.5
billion,
uh 35%
of that is from oil and
gas. So when we're
talking about this
transition
that everyone talks about, we
need to take that into consideration,
we are going to be losing those
revenues.
And so, you know,
we need to make sure we're, we're
talking about that.
Um
And at the same time, we want to
put reserves down to
25%
and we, we, we see the
chart
so I'm, I'm concerned about
that goods and services
inflation.
Um
That's why it costs us so much to
build
because we have to, we're paying the
transport trucks to get the
materials to the
remote locations or to whatever
locations just to get it into New
Mexico.
Um
I want to make sure that
that people
understand the
impact of
the negativity.
Talked about with oil and
gas infrastructure
in the State of New Mexico
roads.
People are not going to come to the
State if we don't have good
roads, we've
got to uh I
echo what the call my
colleagues have said in the past about
that.
Um
My biggest concern is
that we, we
talk about it. We've seen a
lot of different
things where
electric vehicles are
paving the way and doing
all they're not actually paying for
any of the paving.
So we need
to find
an answer for that, not against
electric vehicles, that's
fine.
But let the
let the market
choose
not a mandate. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you,
Representative Garrett
and then Louhan. And so let's get
like three minutes and ask your
question and
let's wrap it
up. >> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Who in this State is
closely tracking demographic
growth because the base of
everything we're talking about is
people, people coming
to our State leaving to our
State growth
industries that are going
to, I optimistically
believe attract
new populations to our
State. So who's doing
that work? That's my
only question. >> There's a
group here at UN M that's
affiliated with Bieber that
does those population
tracking that we work >> with
and they do it on behalf
of all the
departments and everything?
Ok. Thank
you,
Representative Lujan. >> Thank you Mr.
Chair,
just taking everything in.
So um I'm gonna get
into the modeling uh and
trajectories and some of the graphs
that we have uh produced. How
do we have any
modeling or graphs that
you've looked at where you're overlaying
how the, the new
renewable industries
and give you a
projection of how those
come into play with our
economic development and
growth. And
when in modeling,
do we start as we hear about
this, the taxing or
bringing in those those
revenues through those
streams? Mr.
Chair,
have you looked at those or do we have an
Novo lay or do we have modeling of
that
>> Mr. Chair? Representative,
some of that is included
in some of the underlying indicators
that we get from Moody's and
IHS but it's not
as specific as a, a
specific
tax increase here
or on wind or anything
like that because there haven't been
much of that come online
yet. So it's not as specific
as you know,
this tax is gonna come online in
this year in New Mexico.
But there are
some, you know,
understandings of the shiftway from oil
and gas increasing. For
example, EVs you saw how
that played into the road fund
forecast, some of that is
underlying in our underlying forecasts.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think it would be really
incredibly important
for us to be looking at those type of
models because they do
exist and it's
it's producing the
timeline planning for us
so that we can be more
strategic in how we're going to
develop our budget in the future.
That's our future. If
we are working towards a really
decarbonisation and a
carbon economy,
I don't see any of that information
through our budget planning. I
think that is extremely
important for us to be looking at
that Mr. Chair and
I would ask that we start
getting some of that information
in front of us because we
are going to run into problems. We
are, we have finite
resources. We need
to know when we need to implement
uh new
track tax structures or
when we need to pull back and
where those investments are
because we are going
to continue to go back and forth
and back and forth in this
conversation and
not really getting to where
we need to be comprehensive
and have a comprehensive plan
because nothing is perfect.
But I do agree with a
representative Hochman Vhi,
we can chew gum and walk
at the same time and we
have to because
that is what, what is being
directed to us through the
federal budget
and economy and that's what
we have the opportunity as an energy
State to do. And if we're
not doing that, I think we're shooting
ourselves in the foot here, Mr.
Chair. There are so
many things that are included
in how we get to where we need to
with our carbon goals
and I don't see it
reflected in how
we can. We're planning that.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the
time. >> Thank you.
Just to wrap this up. I think
pages 26
and 11 are the most important
presentation, right? We
see a declining population,
right? And we see an
out migration
and we see a low birth rate.
So, where's your workforce gonna come
from? Right. And where's
your tax base gonna come from in
New Mexico?
On page
26? I don't know where I
put
it.
Page 26 is also pretty
revealing to me. I mean,
we're, we're deciding where we want
to go in New Mexico over the next couple
of years, right? Do we
wanna overspend this
year and then have to really
pull back in the next year or do we
want to just
have a steady growth and a
steady stream? We've grown those
budgets and demographically
quite a bit. What do we grow
30 some percent over
the three or four year period?
Charles?
Yes, sir, Mr. Jim.
And, and so,
I mean, that's a decision the
legislature we need to make,
right? Where do we want
this to go? You
set things in
motion. So if
oil and gas does go away,
our investments are going now
be our main source of
income in New Mexico.
So we've set ourselves and we're not
quite there in direct you
yet. To, to get those
scenarios in place
with steady growth.
I mean, the agency's
request
is pretty much up
18% across
the board. Right.
How much unspent money do
we know agencies have not
spent? Do
we know that in any way, shape or
form Charles over the last three year
period? How much money they
haven't spent in the three
years? >> Uh, we
can get that information, Mr.
Chairman, the reversions have been
coming in at pretty elevated
levels. Those reversion
numbers that you'll see in our
um volume three,
a greater percentage
of them are going to start being
coming from the nonrecurring
appropriations that you've been
making, um,
than the recurring. We've
seen a major
shift this last year
in agency operating budgets
giving out uh
significant
um, salary
increases to staff that are
sopping up a lot of
vacancy savings. You'll see that
as a theme throughout
the fall. So that May have decreased
some of the recurring
reversions that we're seeing,
but definitely outsized
raises beyond what you
appropriated
for.
>> And, and, and so that's
how we're gonna get some controls. We know we
have a pay study that's coming.
We know that's going to be
100 to 100 and $50
million fix
an estimate. So put
100 and 50 million out of the
600,000 out of
there and,
and we got to
decide where we really want to hit
within this budget in order to
plan for 25
26 28 29.
We know we have an Executive
leaving in two years,
executives leave. They don't care
what shape the budget's in. They're
out of here. Right.
We, we have
a long term goal as legislators
saying, ok, we're going to be here for the
next four years for
myself. Right. And,
and reps are here two
years. How do we
control that over the time
frame? And how do we not go to
those cuts? I mean, I
counted and there's only four or
five of us in this room that have
been here since I came
in in 09 and
seen those two years of cuts and
seen those 16 year cuts
in 2016 and,
and watched how that has to
be done. I mean,
um I,
I think New Mexico
and we're gonna hear economic development
later on today, right?
And those are the modeling that I think
that department has to do
LFC is not a modeling
for economic growth and what should
happen in New Mexico.
Um
That's what, what agencies
are for and we're gonna have to really push
those agencies to get that stuff
done for us
as we, whatever
workforce we mov'e
to.
I think it was in, I can't
remember where it was in, but the guy
presented that, but New
Mexico is
now, the Permian
Basin is now the
major source
for oil in the United States.
That reliance is not going to
go away. I don't care how many
electric vehicles and how many
solar plants and everything
you put in. I, I
don't know about you but
I know Representative Armstrong May not
be in the room, but I
ordered 15,000
gallons of fuel the other day.
Right. That's how
much fuel we have to burn
to, to mov'e equipment around
and to mov'e stuff around. That's a
large chunk. And,
and when you order that amount of fuel
that, that's not going away, do
we need to fix that? Sure. But
the legislature has never
had
the temperament to
increase the gas
tax and
we have to decide, right.
Are we going to increase the gas tax
or are we gonna do? Like my
wife did the other day at the
exit is hit a pothole and
knock your vehicle out of alignment,
right? How many
times are we going to hear that story
on the roads? And,
and we
got to decide what's our priorities
and, and how to do that? I
mean, we can set up trust funds for
the road, but we fund at a
higher level and
then setting up trust funds
to do to, to
dot Let me ask you
something that interests me real quick
is the interest
revenue, you mentioned interest
revenue in dot Where is
that interest revenue coming
from? >> Uh,
it's short term interest on the road
fund and, and this
report is mainly road fund, but we
also collect interest on
the local
government road fund, transportation fund,
some of our other uh
restricted funds, but
that's um
interest on the revenue uh when
it comes in, it's
invested while
it sits for waiting for us to spend
it. >> That's not a large
number though, is it, >> you know,
it has been, it, it's
been an abnormally large
histo over historic
trends the last few years
because of the success in the
market and um
success of the
Stowe but
not as far as our overall
budgets,
>> right? I mean,
this is, this
is, this should
be telling everybody where New
Mexico needs to head,
right? And,
and if I ran New Mexico as my
business, I'd be saying a
declining population,
a low birth rate
and a lower workforce,
right? I have to look to
somewhere else to recruit, right?
So you have to bring that in
migration into New Mexico
to gain that workforce. And
what does that look like? Is it solar
technology? Is it, what
is that in migration
that you have to draw into New
Mexico? Right?
That's where I think we really
struggled. Otherwise
you're gonna see uh other
companies and people say
I don't have the workforce. I
mean, A I
is going to drive a lot of
demand in the workforce. I
mean, it's
incredibly
crazy what it can do
for a workforce and
the number of employees that you
can drop off
in A I, I
mean, you
can, you can do anything
you really want to do in a I, in
an app today and not really
have to hit the computer
at all except to cut and
paste.
And so,
um,
I don't know where we're gonna get, but
I, I'm gonna be interesting
to see what the new economic development
Secretary says. How do we drive
in migration and what are those
forces that drive in migration
in New Mexico to get
those tax bases
up our tax
system over the last
three years we've given away. And I
know this is not the number, total
number because it's needs to be
separated out. But 2.5
billion we moved around,
right. We have
to replace that base in some
way, shape or form to
get stability. So if
there is a downturn, we don't have to
hit those funds. That's the
goal of, of
that is to, to
create an economy
that doesn't have to hit funds that
they keep growing and keep
growing. Uh Even
if we don't use them and we
stabilize and generate our
own revenue in order to
operate
business modeling
101.
And, and so how do we do
that? I mean,
that's gonna be the word question and,
and I'd love to see what
dot Says,
what is the number that the gas
tax has to be in order for you to
be operational
with A with
AC P I increase in
3 to 5 years or
some triggering that system,
right? What is
electric vehicle tax have
to be in order to
offset the number of cars going
across the road? I mean,
those are numbers that we'll need
to see in order to understand that
those possibilities. So,
thank you guys. I thought this was
a very good presentation
and I guess it's kind
of a warning to agencies.
We know where we're at, we
can see where we're at so we
better start getting to
where we need to be. So, thank
you guys.
Let's see,
Sarah.
We're running late,
so
perfect.
>> Ok,
good morning, Mr. Chair. Members
of the Committee. My name is
Dr Sarah Roving and I'm a program
evaluator with the LFC.
Today, my colleague, Sam Leman
and I will be presenting an LFC
evaluation focused on
post text and dairy certificates
which should be in your binders
under tab C. Looks like
this.
First. I'd like to thank
uh Secretary Stephanie
Rodriguez, Deputy
Secretary Patricia
Trujillo and the rest of
the A ED team for their collaboration
on this project.
Additionally, the state's twoyear
colleges were key partners
in this report.
We're all thankful to all of the
administrators, faculty
and institutional researchers
who have provided support and
data throughout this process.
We're also thankful to the workforce
Solutions department who provided
us with key data and
our LFC colleague, Josh
Chafin, uh
Chaffin, sorry in the
earlier stages of this
report.
Now, before we jump into the
Executive summary, I want to
start today by defining
the scope of this report.
What exactly is
a post-secondary
certificate?
If you'll flip ahead with me
to page
six,
figure two shows
how post-secondary certificates
reside within a broader
universe of non degree
credentials.
These can be anything that
vouches for one's
occupational expertise
outside of a conventional colledge
degree, including
badges, diplomas,
industry certifications,
State or federally endorsed
licenses and
certificates for apprenticeship
completion.
The training leading to these credentials
varies as well.
Ranging anywhere from a
week long, online
continuing education
class to full-time
in-person coursework
completed over several
academic semesters.
There are currently over 100
and 40 entities in New
Mexico Public and
private that award
some form of non degree
credential
today. However, we are going to be looking
specifically at the credentials
awarded by New Mexico's
Twoyear Colleges.
The center darkest
blue circle in the diagram
that you're looking at, which we
will refer to as post-secondary
certificates.
All the states twoyear
colleges offer certificates
that come with colledge credit,
which students can then count
toward higher degrees.
Currently, the State two
year colleges produce about
80 of these 80%
of these credit bearing certificates
in the State.
Increasingly to your
colleges are also offering
certificates that do not come
with colledge credit,
sometimes called workforce
or professional certificates.
For the sake of simplicity,
we will use the terms for
credit and
nonrestorative
with that. I invite you to turn
back to page four
for the Executive
summary.
Today's report addresses
the effectiveness of post-secondary
certificates in New Mexico's
higher education landscape
focusing on the critical
need for better alignment with
labor market demands,
enhanced data tracking
and improved communications
about the value of these
certificates.
Post-secondary certificates
have become increasingly
important as flexible
alternatives to traditional colledge
degrees, offering
quicker pathways to
employment. As
you can see in charts one
and 24
credit certificate awards
have grown both nationally
and in New Mexico over the
previous decade,
more than doubling in the
State between 2012
and 2022
four credit certificates.
Now outpace annual
awards of two or
four year degrees in New
Mexico.
However, the financial returns
on these four credit certificates
vary widely
largely depending on how
well they align with high wage,
high demand fields.
While some certificates,
particularly those in
health care and manufacturing
lead to substantial wage
returns. Others
such as those in liberal
arts offer more
limited financial
returns. This is
a cause for concern as
liberal arts certificates account
for 90% of New
Mexico's fourre
certificate growth in
the past decade
as more students turn to
certificates. It is vital
to ensure that these programs are
structured to maximize
value.
While financial aid options
for students pursuing four
credit certificates have
expanded challenges
remain in ensuring that
students can access
and fully benefit from these
resources
for students in non credit
programs. The
fiscal year 25
government results and
opportunity or grow
appropriation promises
to break down financial
barriers.
However, to achieve its full
potential, the grow
appropriation requires
careful tracking of student
outcomes. A
key tool in this quest
will be the New Mexico longitudinal
data system
which once operational
will allow researchers to
gain critical insights
into the wage and employment
impacts of both for
credit and non credit
certificates.
The current lack of comprehensive
data on both the fourre
and non credit side
hampers informed decision
making for students
trying to choose the best
career pathway for
colleges determining
which programs to offer
and for the legislature
as it considers future
investments in workforce
development
by aligning educational
offerings with the demands of the labor
market, enhancing
data tracking systems
and improving communication
with students. We can help
ensure that post-secondary
certificates provide
meaningful pathways to
economic
mobility.
Please turn with us now back
to page six for the background
of this report
across New Mexico and
the nation. Students
pursuing post-secondary
certificates tend to be older,
more racially diverse
and more likely to come from
lower income backgrounds
than those pursuing two or four
year degrees
in New Mexico Native
American students, for
instance, are twice
as likely to earn a certificate
as they are to earn a bachelor's
degree. As
I mentioned previously,
many twoyear colleges in
New Mexico offer both
fourre and non
credit certificates.
Turning to page
eight
in table one, you can see
that each of these categories
offers benefits and
drawbacks for both students
and institutions.
For instance, four credit
certificates allow students
to easily build
toward higher degrees
and to transfer credit
between the state's colleges
Nonresistant
are easier for institutions
to pilot and shut down in
response to changing industry
demands. They tend to
be shorter and provide more
flexibility to nontraditional
students.
The state's investment in workforce
development including
post-secondary certificates
has increased significantly
in recent years.
Also on page eight,
you can see in chart four
that over the last five fiscal
years, New Mexico
has increased State investment
from $11 million
in fiscal year 21
to nearly $81
million in fiscal year.
25.
On page nine
table two provides an
agency by agency
breakdown of how these funds
have been appropriated.
As you can see New Mexico's
federal and State investments
and workforce development
are scattered across
programs and agencies
making it clear why there
is such a need for collaboration
and strategic
direction.
Given the piecemeal nature
of statewide investment.
How do higher education
institutions fund their
certificate programs?
Turning to page 10,
we read that the largest
and most flexible
appropriation is
provided through the state's higher
education funding formula
under instructional and general
funding more than
$800
million in fiscal year
25. The
funding formula is a base
plus model which protects the
current year appropriation and
only new money is directed
through the funding formula.
Additionally, since
2007 HED
has received less than
$1 million
to reward workforce
training in high demand
fields based on
student headcounts in workforce
training programs.
Colleges can also use
research and public service
project funding around
$9 million for the twoyear
colleges in fy
25.
In 2022
you appropriated $20
million from the American Rescue
Plan Act funds to support
work study programs.
In 2023
you expanded the uses
for this money to include
workforce training and
apprenticeships.
Earlier this year, you
established the government results
and opportunity or grow
fund. This fund
includes a $60
million.03 year
appropriation to fund
student tuition and fees
for non credit workforce
training at twoyear
colleges.
New Mexico's recent
investments speak to both
statewide and national
trends which show
that students are increasingly
finding new pathways to
entering or changing
careers. On
page
13,
you will see in chart 11
that more students nationally
are stacking certificates
on the way to a degree or
using certificates on top
of degrees to reskill
or upskill.
However, certificates are
riskier bets than conventional
degrees. Some
programs pay off quickly
in the form of wage
increases while others
produce no return on
investment.
Turning to page 14
chart 12 shows
that a bachelor's degree remains
the gold standard of
undergraduate education,
producing much higher
wage increases for New Mexico
students than associates
or for credit
certificates.
Finally, national
research shows significant
variation between
states when it comes
to how certificate translate
into employment and better
wages for completer
State funding
policy and
implementation can
mold student outcomes
helping to ensure that
certificates offered and
advertised are aligned
with high paying highman
jobs. And now I
want to turn things over to my colleague
Sam to address the first
two findings of this
report.
>> Thank you, Sarah.
Now, Mr. Chair and Members of
the Committee, please turn with me to
page 15.
This report's first finding
is that some certificates lead to
real real wage increases
but not all programs pay off
equally. And as a point
of clarification, this
analysis and all the others for which
we had substantial data relate
to four credit certificates.
Only most
four credit certificates are
associated with positive wage
increases with the typical
certificate outside of liberal
arts leading to a $7000
boost in annual earnings
significantly. Not
all certificates offer the same
financial benefits. Turning
to page
16,
the significant variability
in outcomes underscores the
importance of ensuring that certificate
programs are are
aligned with high wage,
highman occupations.
And you can see these in table
six
turning to page
17.
Conversely, certificates in
fields like liberal arts which
have driven much of the growth in
fourre certificates over the
past decade often do
not lead to as large wage
increases. These
certificates May serve as
launchpads towards higher
degrees, but on their
own, they generally do not
offer the same financial benefits
as those in more technical
fields.
It is critical to note that students
who earn certificates, even in
Highman, high wage
fields cannot expect
to make as much as the average
holder of a bachelor's degree
over their lifetime.
Based on the wage analysis in this
report, certificates should
not be seen as supplanting
traditional undergraduate degrees
but rather supplementing them by
creating alternative pathways
to high paying jobs.
Turning to page 18.
Another critical finding is the
value of stacking certificates
that is combining multiple
certificates or using
certificates to progress toward a
degree. Research
shows that students who earn multiple
certificates, particularly
in related fields tend
to see greater wage gains than those
who earn a single certificate
and turning to page
19,
you can see an example of this
phenomenon in chart
16.
Now turning to page
20
in New Mexico, the Majority of
certificate programs are designed
to incorporate stacking
ultimately leading to better job
prospects and higher
earnings
on pages
2122
and 23. The
report discusses that the ultimate
success of these programs
depends on improved coordination
between State agencies,
better communication, communication
with students about the value of different
certificates and
enhanced data tracking to ensure
that educational offerings are
aligned with labor market
needs by
focusing on these areas. New
Mexico can better support students
in achieving their educational and
career goals.
Please turn with me now to page
24 for this report's
second finding, the grow
appropriation offers new
access and accountability for
nored certificates
when it comes to financial aid
options available to students
pursuing fourre certificates.
Far surpass those available
to
students
in non-residents
have expanded dramatically in recent
years. As detailed in the call
out box in the middle of page
25
at the federal level, pell grants
which provide support to low-income
students can now be used for
more certificates than ever
at the State level.
The the legislature has
opened up eligibility for the
opportunity scholarship since its
inception in 2020
making it easier for students to use
the scholarship for certificate
programs and continue
their scholarship as they stack
one or more certificates towards
a degree.
Critically, not all
certificates are eligible to be
used with the opportunity scholarship
in collaboration with the workforce
solutions department,
HED identifies stem
health care and highman
workforce fields for which students
can use the scholarship.
However, turning to page
26
this restricted eligibility is
not adequately communicated
by either the department or
the colleges on their websites.
As shown in figure
three,
historically, students pursuing
non cred certificates have faced
financial barriers, often
relying on institutional discounts
and employer contributions to cover
program costs by
providing additional financial aid
for students. The fy 25
grow appropriation represents a
significant advancement in funding
for nonreverting
at New Mexico's Twoyear
Colleges.
Turning to page
27
the grow appropriation introduces
new accountability measures with
colleges required to submit implementation
plans and track outcomes based
on criteria outlined by
H HED
solicited and incorporated
feedback from LS CD
F and the Workforce Solutions
Department in drafting their performance
indicators as
detailed on page 27 and
figure four, these measures
align with national standards.
This report recommends that HED
also add student wage outcomes
to its list of performance
metrics. Turning
to page 28
an LFC survey of two year colleges
revealed that approaches to evaluating
the quality of non credit programs
vary widely across the
State. And you can see the
results of this survey in table
12
using the grow appropriation as an
impetus to improve nored
data tracking will allow the
State to tag priority
certificates and enable
HD to factor in performance
as part of its grow distribution
calculation calculation in
future years. Turning
to page
29
other states have found success
in tying workforce funding
program funding to performance.
Virginia's new economy
workforce grant has led to
substantial annual wage
increases and a 99%
completion rate for program
participants. Donan
Community College is currently exploring
using their growth distribution to pilot
a similar program.
I'll now hand things back over to Sarah
to summarize chapter three as well
as this report's major
recommendations.
>> Thank you, Sam.
Please turn with me now to page
31. For this report's
final finding,
improved data tracking could
address diverse challenges
for post-secondary
certificates.
The grow and other recent
investments underscore the
pressing need for robust
data systems that can track
student outcomes and
help ensure that these investments
are yielding positive
results. The
new Mexico longitudinal data
system or L DS
when operational will
combine the data of five
State agencies
providing a full cradle
to career picture of
how various educational
and workforce interventions
are paying off for New
Mexicans.
By leveraging the data currently
tracked on the four credit
side and new
plans to track outcomes
on the non credit side.
As part of the grow
appropriation,
we should be able to use the
L DS to gain an even
deeper understanding of
how certificates pay
off for students. In the
long run.
Over the last five years,
the State has appropriated
$13 million to the
state's L DS.
Despite this influx
of funding and ample
time, the system
remains underdeveloped,
leaving institutions to
rely on inefficient
and costly workarounds to
monitor student
success.
Another area where enhanced
data tracking and communication
can benefit students
is choosing between taking
a certificate at a public
colledge or one of the
state's numerous private
institutions. Think
P A Carrington
Brookline, any number of
small cosmetology
schools, these
private certificate programs
are more expensive than those
offered by public colleges.
And national research
suggests that they often yield
limited or even negative
returns on investment.
HED has been recognized
for its relatively strict
regulation of private
institutions. In comparison to
other states.
The agency can leverage
new federal financial
monitoring requirements in
re in coming years
to further ensure that
students are protected.
Additionally, enhanced
communication about the
financial and educational
advantages of public
colleges using the L
DS could help
students make more
informed choices
ultimately leading to better
outcomes for students,
public institutions
and the state's workforce.
Mr. Chair Members of the Committee,
if you'll now turn with me back to
page five of this
evaluation, you'll find
the key recommendations of this
report.
This report recommends
that the legislature should consider
pausing all future
appropriations to the new Mexico
longitudinal data system
until a usable platform
can be demonstrated.
This report also recommends
that higher education
institutions should award
liberal arts certificates
only as components of
transfer programs
and wherever possible,
award short for
credit certificates
only as part of stacked
certificate or degree
programs.
And finally, this report
recommends that the higher education
department should
collaborate with the Workforce
Solutions Department to
measure student wages as a
grow performance
metric and consider
adding additional performance
metrics and should
also collaborate with the
LFC staff to test
the new Mexico longitudinal
data system.
Thank you so much for your time.
This morning, Mr. Chair and Members of
the Committee, with your permission. We'll
turn things over now to
Deputy Secretary Trujillo
for the presentation from the higher
education
department.
>> Good morning chairmans
Munoz and small and
honorable Members of the
Committee. I am Doctor
Patricia Trujillo and I am the
Deputy Cabinet Secretary
of the New Mexico Higher
Education Department.
Secretary Rodriguez
was uh called away for a
last minute commitment
to the Governor and sends her
regrets. The
department has been asked to provide
a programs, a response
to the program evaluation that
doctor Roving just presented.
We appreciate the time and
effort that went into the legislative
Finance Committee's independent
analysis of post-secondary
credentials within the
higher education sector.
And I appreciate the
opportunity to
respond. The
higher education department
took an objective approach in
exploring undergraduate
wage data from our
agency and the New
Mexico Department of Workforce
Solutions. We looked
at the following items,
one median
annual wages for credential
awardees and
two variations
of student characteristics
by wages such as
gender, age and race,
ethnicity. I
will State that this analysis
allowed our department and the
higher education sector
the opportunity to better understand
the credit and non credit
certificate landscape
and provides a foundation
for discussing their value in
terms of wages for New
Mexicans and
moving into the future. Since
grow funds allow for funding
toward non credit certificates,
the higher education department
will now be collecting this
data. Traditionally,
the Department of Workforce Solutions
already collects this information
tied to their federal programming,
but since our
department
has not
funded these
um supported by State
funds, we look
forward to the first round of reporting
for non cred CRE credentials
to the department in
December. In
my presentation today, I will
focus on the department's key
findings in our analysis of
post-secondary credentials.
There are several items we noticed
in reviewing the data
and I will be re referencing
this report that you all should have
in front of you. Uh When
I refer to page
numbers,
median annual wages
really do vary by credential
type which you will see on
page two of our
presentation
aligning with findings from
the broader literature, longer
form credentials such as
associate's degrees and
bachelor's degrees
generally had greater rate
wage returns over time
than shorter form credentials
such as certificates.
Starting on page three,
we can start to break down what
median annual wages generally
followed these trends by student
characters sticks.
Although gaps in median age,
uh median wages were present
between peer subgroups.
For example, male
students generally had higher
median annual annual
wages than their female
peers. And on
page on the top of page
five, Native
American students generally had
lower median annual wages
than their Hispanic and white
peers. Please
turn to pages six and
seven labeled median
annual wages varied by
program area.
These program areas were
selected in our analysis
by using the same priority
areas as noted in New
Mexico's we O A
combined State
plan. Some
program areas such as
computer and information
sciences had notably
higher wage returns
even for shorter term
credentials. Other
programs like agriculture
and agriculture operations,
while still seeing growth in
median annual wages over
time had smaller
returns.
Now on page eight, we
observe that due to the
variability between
programs and how
credentials are leveraged by
students, some
shorter form credential
programs had median annual
wage wages that rivaled
and even exceeded those of bachelor's
degrees within and
across program
areas.
On the next page, you will
see that certificate programs
of 1 to 2 years in
length saw a sharp
increase in
20 in the 2022
2023 academic
year. While other credential
types continue to see
declines. And
furthermore, I will note that
the largest driver of growth
for 1 to 2 year
certificates were in the
Liberal Arts and sciences,
which is broken out for you to
see on page nine
on pages 10 through
11, the distribution of
credential types among student
subgroups varied. A
few notable examples
include male
students were less likely to
earn credentials overall
but had a higher likelihood
of earning certificates of
more than two years and
certificates of less than one
year than their female
peers. Native
American students were substantially
less likely to earn bachelor's
degrees than other
types of credentials
and pell recipients were less
likely to earn shorter form
credentials than non pal
recipients but made
a slight Majority of associate
degree earners and had
an even split with their non
pal peers for bachelor's
degrees.
Please note that our official
response which goes into
much more detail um
to the program evaluation
is in your packet provided
by the Legislative Finance
Committee and we also
printed and provided copies
with our presentation.
Today, we
the State of New Mexico
are working hard to develop
higher education policies
that ensure State higher
education institutions
offer post-secondary
programs that meet the
educational and career goals
of students and lead
to positive returns for local
communities and the
State. With new
sources of funding for non cred
certificate programs
via grow and continuing
support for students via the
lottery and opportunity
scholarships. Students
have access to more higher
education pathways than
ever before. And
with partners across the State,
the deport the department is
working diligently to improve
data collection and
analysis so we can
make better informed decisions
about where to allocate
resources with
your partnership. The higher
education department will
continue to support students
as they pursue their goals,
regardless of the type of
credential pathway they
choose. And by
making an honest assessment
of the credential offerings within
our higher education landscape
and the impacts these credentials
have on our students,
colleges, university
and workforce needs. We
always seek to better serve our
State through continuous
improvement. In
closing, the higher education
department will continue to collect
and review pertinent data
pertinent to post-secondary
credentials, both
non credit and credit
bearing, especially
with the $60 million
appropriation from grow
in House Bill two.
And as stated in the New Mexico,
we oas combined State
plan, New Mexico's
workforce system is a cornerstone
of the state's economic
vitality dedicated
to equipping its residents with the
skills and opportunities
needed for individual
success and providing
employers with access to skilled
talent to drive economic
growth. Therefore,
we will continue to refine
guidance and apply best
practices as the program
is implemented over the
next three years to
support colledge and
universities. But most
importantly to support
students to ensure New
Mexicans are ensuring
and pardon me, uh to ensure New
Mexicans are pursuing credentials
that allow for moderate
to high wage
wages in the workforce.
Joining me today is
academic affairs policy
um at, at the academic
affairs and policy director,
Mark Chisholm from our agency
and also our da data
analyst, Joseph leaks
and policy analyst Doug
Comis. We
also have a representative
and Secretary Nair from the
Department of Workforce
Solutions. And
last, I want to note that there are
higher education leaders and
other representatives in the
audience today um
to assist in the question and answer
portion of this program of
evaluations. Some
of those recommendations are tied
to their internal decision
making authority.
Once again, thank you
for the opportunity to
speak this morning
and I now yield the floor back to
you, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you for yielding
Representative
Maca.
>> Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you, I'll,
I'll be really brief, you know,
um Mr.
Chairman and and Committee, I I
do see very much the
importance of these type
of certificate programs.
I also understand that there's also
additional costs associated
with educating these students
in these programs.
So Mr. Chairman, my my
question, even though you can
go into depth about it
is the K 12
articulation because as we're
talking about
the certificate programs that
we're talking about
post-secondary.
There is opportunity, I think that
is missed with
our K 12 institutions
as well. When we talk about
engagement, we talk about
uh getting our students in
there, there's an
opportunity
to have its very
roots even having
some of these institutions like
CNM or some of these
others to go into our local
schools. Uh It's
very diverse because we
know we used to
think that
you had to go to colledge,
you had to get that bachelor's
degree. But
understanding is that if we
have our students and we give them these
opportunities in schools,
they are able to enter the workforce
prepared,
you know, by the time they get out of high
school. So I, I know
that that's probably an unfair question
because I know you guys and look at the K
12 high rate
articulation. But that
would be something that I'd like for you
guys to come back and report
to this Committee because
I think that is we're looking at
funding for both of
those entities and we're looking at
an opportunity
for the K 12
articulation with higher
ed. That's
something that's of
great interest to me. And I know many
of my colleagues here on this
panel. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
>> Thank you. I, I don't see any
other people on the
list. I
represent small. Uh
>> Thank, thank you very
much, Mr. Chair.
Um Thank you
to our uh really
excellent evaluations. Thank
you very much to the
department
as it relates to the
longitudinal data
system that seem
a core
recommendation.
And it seems,
you know, super important.
We've it pro
like the system promises
key data,
but there's not
necessarily sort of a
pathway. And this
several years now
going back
really to
um
2021
where this was identified
the core sort of thing
we need to progress.
Uh how, what's
the department's perspective
and why shouldn't we
sort of pause funding
until there's a
clear sort
of shared understanding
about a timeline, a
platform and an
approach,
>> Mr. Chair Members of the Committee.
Thank you for that question.
Uh One of the complexities of
working with the NML DS system
is just how nuanced it
is. One of the things
I want to make sure and, and
articulate to everybody here
today is that per
our own project
timeline, we are not behind
schedule. We just
completed phase one
of the L DS system,
which was really the technical
aspect of, of,
of making sure
that we could create the data lake
that we could in um
upload the 10 different data
systems from the five different
uh agencies.
And now as we are entering
into phase two of the
project, um we
are going to be working
on this access
piece of it and we are
really excited to be entering into
the beta testing section
of the NML DS
system. Um
Primarily uh our first
step in doing that
is that we are going to
grant the five
related um I'm
sorry, the five uh
agencies who
are uh a part
of the NML DS
to test it first.
Um And part of phase two is
also implementing something
called the data request
portal. And implementing
the data request portal is
essentially a web application
that serves as the primary
manner for stakeholders from
outside of the partner agencies
to request access to the
NML DS data.
Uh One of the things when I talk
about nuance that we have to
really um uh how
do I say emphasize
is that we have a lot of
responsibility obviously
for having um
10 different systems of State
data incorporated in one
place. And so we want
to make sure that we're always,
you know, at the same time
as we're thinking about
making, giving access
to the system. Um in
a timely fashion, we have
those that shared
responsibility of making
sure that there is
responsibility for
um the different types
of, of
um how do I say federal and
State laws that apply
to how we need to protect that
data? So I just really
want to emphasize and
say that we do have
plans. Um And
just basically to say IFIS
was granted to an entity
outside of the Executive right
now to test the NML
DS, there would need to
be clear conditions and
agreements um as to the
scope and purpose for of
access, for example,
NML DS data is not set
up for oversight purposes
directly. And when the
LFC works with Executive
agencies on it, evaluations
such as the performance
evaluation we're doing today,
the Executive agency staff
need to prepare data to
meet the needs of the LFC
staff and guide LFC
staff on the appropriate usage
of the data. And
so um that again,
is that like that? Now we're
in that interstitial space
of beta testing
and we want to make sure
that it is
as rigor rigorously
tested as possible
um before we make
it generally available, but we're
doing everything in our power.
Um Now as we go into phase
two to make sure that we're
getting closer and closer to
making it available to
LFC and to other
researchers who want to be able to
have access to it.
>> Thank you for the
detailed response. Thank you,
Chair. Um
What is the timeline
for phase
two,
>> Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee? Would it be? All right if
I deferred that question to my colleague
Joey?
>> Yes. Uh
Mr. Chair representative, I
am uh Joy Laaco.
I am one of the new Mexico
Longitudinal data system
project leads and a data
analyst at the higher
education department.
So right now we are
working on the scope for
phase two.
and the way
we are envisioning this is there's going to
be still figuring out terminology
inside of there but kind of multiple rounds.
So one of the complexities
of a system
like this, it's hard
upfront to say here are the 17
things we need. You need to identify
the three or four items first
and then say, OK, now we can guide the
next four based on
what we learned in those. So
where we're at is we have the technical
system up and really
the data warehouse where all of
the data that is anonymized
uh and is protected. Uh
personal information is stripped
out is available. A
lot of the work
in phase two is going to be figuring
out. How does that get aligned with
research needs? How do we
make sure it's usable in the right way
for um
analysts and researchers and
stuff. And so
once we start project
work, which we are hoping to
have start in the next couple of
months, ideally,
we have a proposed about
sixmonth plan for that
first cycle of work
in phase two. Um
All of this is a little bit up in the air at
the moment, but the goal would
be at the end of that, we've done
a thorough evaluation of what are
those following items for phase
two in detail in terms of
technical work and process and
such. Um
And that's what we go back to our steering
Committee to say yes, we're going to implement
these pieces, those pieces. It turns
out we're missing data in this area
or it turns out that we need
to develop a separate access
channel or something beyond there,
there will be future work. Um
After that in phase two,
such as expanding out public
facing visualizations and other things.
But really, I think the core of when people are
asking
um
timeline for that, we would get
that first six month batch, really
identify the key pieces. And then
when we set up the scope for the, how
do we implement those? That's where we're
starting to say. OK, now that's
matching all the researcher needs
and such. Um do
you want to call out the external
for external requesters? So
that's the data request portal
that will take a little bit longer
um that still has some
implementation layers to be put in
place. Um And so there's a little
bit more of a question mark on that one.
But that's something we would know when we finish
that first uh cycle of
work in phase two. >> Got
it. Thank you.
Um And
I'll have some
more questions to
share uh
electronically. I, I'd
welcome any sort of feedback
from our LFC analysts.
Before that, I guess I would
share my perspective
the,
as
the legislature broadly,
particularly as
the finance committees,
we have an integral
role in
all components
and this,
you know, in partnership
with the Executive,
obviously, we've grown our
investments
eightfold and
more. And
at the, with
director Sali and LFC
leadership set aside
a billion dollar
um
trust fund for higher
education.
I struggle to
see how
the legislature
is sort of
a foreign
part
I under and, and respect
deeply sort of the need
for data
security.
Uh We trust
and I trust
LFC
to Enga
to, to hold in a
very professional manner
and whatever sorts of
formalized agreements
need to be part of that
clearly, like that
needs to be done
for us to guide
investments and to make
big choices about
big new money.
But money that is quickly
sort of
plateauing,
it's super vital
that we have the best
information possible
because without the
information or without
confidence, sort
of in that
investment
money is either gonna be saved
or invested elsewhere.
And so I
think
before
going to the LFC
analysts, I would love
to see how
we can integrate
the data team
on the legislature's.
In this case,
LFC
with appropriate
protocols, safeguards
whatever things
need to be there
so that
we're
the data that's necessary
to hopefully make more
investments is available
because that's what it at the end of the
day, either we
invest more in a
targeted strategic way
that we have confidence in
or those investments
get shifted
elsewhere.
And we all I think acknowledge
that higher education and workforce
are one of the
biggest ways that we can
grow, diversify and
sort of strengthen our economy.
So it would be great to explore
how that could happen
on as timely
of a
scale as
possible.
Anything from the LFC
from our,
yeah,
>> I would just add to
everything you said, Representative Small
and Mr. Chair Members of the Committee
um
that we're kind
of at an exciting moment, the grow
appropriation
um
while
we're lagging the rest
of the nation when it comes to our longitudinal
data system and our tracking
of um um
for credit certificates
and degree outcomes,
everyone's kind of at the same
place when it comes to
tracking non credit
outcomes. So this is really
an opportunity for New Mexico
to lead by
piloting high
quality non credit
certificate data tracking
um by piloting
this and sort of pioneering
these high quality systems. I
think this is a really exciting
opportunity for the State to actually
be a leader in the nation among
the other states.
>> And then Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee. One additional note,
um access to
a longitudinal data system would
allow the types of analyses that
we conducted for this report to
be conducted much more efficiently
and much faster. Um Since
there will be linkages between the
data. And it's also worth noting
that we cited a report from
Virginia um on
their, the
Virginia analyst conducted
that analysis using
their state's longitudinal data
system. So there's clear
evidence that an existing
system like this can vastly
increase the speed at which we can conduct
this type of work. >> Awesome.
Thank you both Mr.
Ara. But I do want to, I
want to thank higher
education and
the team on the longitudinal
data side. I think
you're sharing sort of uh
progress and, and what
you're seeing we're
seeing from the LF that
there's more
opportunity and I think a
desire for
uh early stage
integration and
participation
so that we can inform our
funding decisions
uh in over, you
know, really the next two
years with this administration.
So exci I think
overall really appreciate a
very in-depth conversation.
Appreciate very much the
participation. Thank
you, Chair. >> Thank
you. You know, PD
allows us to use their system
right now. Charles is telling
me this, right?
So it makes it easier for
us. It's,
we're all in this together. You
guys cannot fight us on this
and you have to allow us to use that
system because if he can go to Sam,
can go to Virginia and
they're allowed to get into that
system, it just makes
it easier on everybody.
But if hire Ed
and the Executive wants to fight us
on this, then maybe we won't
fund it and we'll just
fund our own and do it through
LFC. But we got to
work together to get this done
instead of them chasing
Pixie sticks over here and
trying to get numbers out of this area
and then putting their, their
report together. It should
be as simple as you're gonna work
together and that's the end of the
story. Um
So that has to happen.
I, I understand the privacy
stuff. Um
We'll deal with that
but it has to be worked
together.
Um Let me
ask what is a liberal art
certificate
cost?
And there's some presidents from universities
they want to jump up.
And
now
Amazon
>> Mr., Chair Members of the Committee
um doing some back of the
napkin math from my
colleague, President Hartzler from
CNM. She
approximates
$3600
for the
degree
for an associate's degree.
So probably half of that
$1800
>> certificate
and some of these certificates have
no, no
accreditation for
any, anything else
for them to their
education. Correct?
>> I would suspect that uh for
credit certificate in the
liberal arts, that would be
under one of the academic
departments at an institution
which is governed
by the HLC or the higher learning
commission. And >> then
so tell
me
what,
that's a credited certificate
is roughly
$1800.
What's a, >> a non credit
certificate? So these are all of our
workforce and professional
certificates um can
range anywhere
um from
a couple $100 to a couple of
$1000
to over $10,000.
Um that
said students
typically do not bear
the bulk of those costs.
Typically. Um
our institutions provide
tuition discounts and
employers will also
um pitch in, especially if it's
for a customizer spec
training. Um,
some numbers we got from
CNM and, and
uh and correct me
if I'm mistaken, but
they deep dive coding
boot camps, um which
run 10 weeks, full
time, uh cost
about 10,000 or
$11,000. But
students who do pay out
of pocket will only pay about
$1000 typically
because most of the rest of the costs
are subsidized.
Um So the grow
appropriation is not, it's not
like it's eliminating tens
of thousands of dollars of costs
borne by students, but it is
still eliminating substantial
cost borne by students
at this point.
>> So on, on that cer on that
certificate, then
where's the $9000
is coming from?
Where
Mr. >> Chair, I
>> just Chair. So the source often
comes from we O A funding
G bill uh can
come from an individual pocket
comes from the HB workforce
high demand funding
from Mexico grow funding
for many
sources.
>> Mr. Chair CNM actually
provided a very helpful list
for us which we reproduced
for you on
page
um 12 in
table four that has sort of the
complete list of other sources
that are currently covering
uh non credit
training,
>> ok? I I mean,
I'm I'm looking at page 10
here and I'm looking at certificates
for vocational career instruction,
right? And I look across
the board and I can tell
how much we need to pump in
CNM is pumping 25
million in certificate programs,
right? And then we
go down and we look at the next credit
certificates, a higher ed formula.
CNM is still ahead and, and
the rest are far behind.
But the non non
on chart seven, the head
count for non credit
certificates in the workforce
that doesn't raise anybody's
income that doesn't
give them any credits
to go on or continue their
education. I mean,
that's the highest number
at CNM. And
I think that's San Juan College, but
I don't know what that is.
And
>> yeah,
part of the reason
that the grow
appropriation and the
performance metric tracking
that will come out of it is so crucial
is that we don't understand
the income increases
that are associated
with these workforce certificates.
Now, some of our
larger colleges such as
CNM have done some data
tracking and
the data does look pretty
promising for many of these
nored certificates.
I would also add that many
of our institutions are starting
to build credit
for prior
learning systems that
allow non
credit
uh learning that
students have done to
count toward degrees. So
there are now efforts to
bridge between the non
credit and credit side
um that this
report finds to be highly
promising.
>> Ok. I
mean,
II, I think in,
in higher ed, at some point, we're
gonna have to figure out some of these
vocational careers,
right? And, and
call them plumbers,
electricians, whatever,
right? How we're gonna
get them, their certificates or
their degrees and then
how do we get them through
C ID to be licensed?
Right? Because you have
to be a journeyman under C ID
and, and how do we do that in
institutions? So, when we come
out, you know, I, I
need a plumber
on a job and, and
not a journeyman today.
Right. And how do we
increase those numbers? I mean,
that's part of the high cost of
construction is because every
subcontractor is so
far behind and can only pick
and choose so many jobs to go
to, to try to get their
work done. And, and how do we
get that certificate along
with a license
as they mov'e out?
Right.
Is that the one
becomes troublesome where the workforce
gets tighter and tighter. And the workforce
in, in the prior
presentation just
told us we have a
declining, an aging
population and out
migration and
a decrease in
birth rate so that workforce
is slowing greater than everything
else. So how do we get those
done, uh
and, and get them licensed or get
them journey MS right away when they're coming
out of school? So they are at a
higher rate. I I
know like at U and M gallop
because she's here. I mean, our
nursing program is kind
of at the seams. Our
Welding program has been at
the seams for a long time.
Right. And those are good high
paying jobs that a lot of
Native Americans and
my kids have been to both
not nursing, but Welding
and have gotten those
certificates. Um,
but they go out and they,
they mov'e across the country
from Oklahoma to Texas
to anywhere to get welding
jobs that pay 45 to 60
an hour. And
so I, I think
that's how we increase the, the
wage income in New
Mexico.
Ok. Thank you
guys. We'll appreciate access to
that when in 45
days,
uh, our lunch is next
door in that
room
just right over there around the corner
to the left, I guess two
lefts
and we'll come back
at
115,
115, we'll be back 25.
