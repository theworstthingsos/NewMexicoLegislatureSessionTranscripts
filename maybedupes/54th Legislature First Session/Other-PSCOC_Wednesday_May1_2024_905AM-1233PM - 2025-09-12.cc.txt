around.
Um, the consolidation of and, um
Is this the best practice for

Um, that's my first question.
And my second question is been
in conversation with the
Had a meal. I guess my question.
Is it best practice from
The idea is that to have, um for
stat chair. I think I get it. So
this is one
That our teacher public schools
has been a part of this and and
we were for a
Hello. Sorry about that. Did you

Engagement.
We
Him.
A limited course offerings in AG

Uh, Mr Chair? Uh,
Superintendent, um, and your
team. Thank you, Uh, for the so
you're going to be consolidating
the three schools, will you be,
um, demolishing the existing?
Where would this new school site
be?
Um, I've I've lived in the
community gin, given the fact
that we're very I don't know
that it would be an easy sell
for us to get movement towards a
kind of
Presentation.
Um, I wanted to ask you had
mentioned that this project has
been
And under way for several years,
So I wanna ask
They were standing up and
Ah, sorry. This is for Hondo
combined. Um Honda is
But, um, I know we only have 15
just to start off.
Hodo is, um
I have been here for also works
for the district.
So
To get started. If you start on
page 125
When I came into the district in
2000 and affordable water
system, and, uh the, uh,
HVAC systems in the ripping, so
a little background, the
roofing.
Fondest memories.
And I'm being annually We have
our fiesta.
Dancing.
I have an invitation for
plumbing problems, but hopefully
uh
126
The oldest building that we
have, and a little more, uh,
with all the money you'd love
Shows you a little bit about, uh
Um
Long term drizzling tis at the
that are on most of the
A lot of our roots have this
white stripe on them, and and,
uh, we've tried to do our best
to
Technology.
Uh, especially in our high
school building. These
Um, as far as security
Bulletproof would be you know,
we have done some, um
We started a culinary and we're
utilizing all the space that we
can, uh, board meetings and so
blanket. There is a
A, uh
A hood there, blueprints and
things that we've had engineers
and other people out with.
Better be better be better to
Water tech.
38
We are very proud of our new
water tank work with all sips
before it became yes, way they
donated to pump
We have one more.
Played there for
A
Portable.
Is to provide flexibility for
the district.
Um
Yeah, I, I think that, um
Uh, now I'm caught
Public schools.
We actually have three requests
briefly through every through
each request and
So in
Which is
Because over time
Um
A student enrollment has
declined over the Stoos,
choosing to transfer
Years ago.
Truman Middle ST.
Even though right now we have
Uh, we are still asking lie.
35 programs.
94% of the students are in one
school strategy.
What which full inclusion, but
to do this, you have
Which is not so once we give
those families help
Initially so that services so we
either have them and specialized
facilities. All the specialized
needs for the lighting.
And, um, this is what we are
doing a hub.
The other issue that
When it comes to, um
Having the continuum of services
and care.
Some of these kids have to sit
in bus. These are the most
vulnerable of having them so
that you can get that
specialized needs, But this has
a price in general education.
PTR is
We find the student teacher
ratio goes to as low as eight.
Is, you'll find that speech
language pathology.
And so even though the
enrollment is so fine that the
103 110 110
Uh, special need
Um will Jen will generate an
extra 20 classrooms and as well
and so that is particular
school.
And then finally, for this
school it been, uh doing, uh
Working dress, overcrowding and
certain areas of the south were
school will then, uh, given that
it also apart from that, um, so
much for your presentation. Um,
I actually attended Harrison
Mill now.
Um, the questions that I have
are specific to a hub.
And, um
First. Can you tell me how far
our students traveling does this
just for the Rio Grande class?
Yeah.
Where are you? Where are you?
Bringing your kids from?
To this T.
Just the Rio Grande cloud. We've
learned a lot about, uh, you can
just have so much more.
Not only for the transport, uh,
the kids have issues and the
similar kinds of problems and so
what we've done we realize we
still need to have the
specialized. They have to be
closer. We would like if it
active to have all the diabetes,
we realized we realize that we
need a are these your highest
need. Students in
Are these all in the real? No.
Just just so the whole idea is
we do
So, um, mister Chair. I've I've
been to low
Um and so
I. I do have some concerns,
moving away from inclusive.
And so you know, I would like to
learn more about
8 P.m. and, um
So I'm I am very interested in
that.
Um I also would encourage
concept. Um, I mean, it's about
meeting students needs, um
I would like to
Thank you very much in
How they do it. The best way to
do it is to serve their act.
Given, um
Get a preview for some of those
So in terms of capacity, some of
the schools are either close to
cap the eye. Sanchez uh, K
through eight.
Uh, for 1200 caps K through,
When we go in and
Do
The
So, uh, we
Schools are getting rebuilt.
Um, just to follow up on my
earlier question.
Your description says that 35%
of the yes. And so that's 35%.
Are the highest need special ed
students?
Who given its and and it's
proliferate. One of the reasons
it's a hub is because
But it's not like we are.
OK, so again, uh, give a summary
Van Buren again, Um
Even older. The federal students
choosing to transfer to
basically
Um
This school is located in
seating 45%.
A PS is committed to pro school
rebuild. Um, it really reflects,
And you get these rebuilds in L
In this situation. We are school
as geo coded in its
Drive to a school that a space
like Jefferson.
Oh,
Yeah, not that the teachers and
to give
Those have to to show what they
can do if possible.
So this one the school because
it needs it.
And also because
And also in your
Van Buren, Where is it located?
It's in the international
district.
Um, thinking, uh, Van Buren, I
would just like to say that I
think it is, um positive, even
though APS has worked to
maintain the
So if you look at your the the
the the decline
Enrollment.
So
Anecdotal occupancy.
Schools.
We
Square footage wise classrooms
that were built in the seventies
and the sixties.
15 less classroom. You're gonna
end up with now. We didn't have
fiber optic HVAC refrigerated
air.
We didn't have all, uh, duct
work with age.
But almost all side spaces will
probably it's just that it's
being done
Probably
Um
Taking care of equity, but
balance is out
Old
Now that all goes out throughout
the window when you look at our
oldest, one of our oldest
schools.
But again very desirable real
estate.
Now is it fair is worse than low
is better than law right now,
because even Monte VSA, so just
just you,
You
And, uh, this
This is a totally different
So
The Duran is early childhood
center. Um let me just give up.
Following the state of new Plan
to design a 12 have facilities
in, um
This.
Um before the Constitution not
needs for programming based on
location.
So, basically if you looked at
OK, funding was done before the
amendment.
Was that you'll see. There was a
lot of print in Albuquerque.
Specifically, those are over 30
rate and, um
Schools and areas that were
elig, Uh, this resulted in a
service gap.
The northwest four years old.
Yet because of how pre amendment
They could came in and
And so that's how this was being
done.
So as part of which
Hardly. We are intending to
address
Yeah.
This will not only increase our
enrollment district wide, but
Southern
And inequity in service.
Um
Balancing
For universal, pre K.
The pre K example for the
majority of the population.
For now, most lately served
Now.
And the old re regime between
APS, the city of Albuquerque
County of we serve.
Who've looked at birth rates.
And the district 12,000.
Three and four.
And this is because in the past
there was
Now, if you get what public
schools are doing what we are
doing what the city is doing
what the county is doing.
What? What nonpublic capability.
Make a dent of what is a child.
So
What we have done with and we
got together.
UH,
But CNM
And we also involved in this
because the idea is
When we build the the operation.
what is lacking?
Is the facility. The fact that
we have the New Mexico early
child was formed.
It was a early childhood is not
that poignantly when it comes to
standards are different for
playgrounds.
The standards are different for
nutrition.
Ation and the equity for that
You don't just put kids in
buses. You don't just drop them
bringing kids.
And walking them into the
school.
We've gone out of state and
looked at examples.
You're talking about child seats
that are in into into vehicles.
So we're talking about staffing
where
Uh, you'll have to have staffing
if you have facilities.
And then
You're going to have to deal
with not just the education
part. There'll be the pre
Yeah, and the aftercare Because
the parents and I'm just talking
about three and four.
So
We have a lot to lick our
nonpublic providers talking to
them.
Our early constantly in state is
doing
And also what we have done is
that
We are applying, like this year
we are applying for 26 new
And the idea of that is that
we're not going to a
What we're going to do is
accommodate them as well as we
can. Neighborhood schools that
have the, um
Those store again, I said the
design committee included
partnering with agencies both
private and public.
Um what
And then various local
jurisdictional pro has to your
question.
This has the potential if we
just
Say a PSE
40 12,000, who are put to rate
This six years.
Just because of early childhood.
If we reach that
Um, the early childhood have
240.
And, um Duran is the
Third
School in five years. Um
In terms of gay
Uh, per
Next year
Going forward.
And, uh, we think
Um so so first off. Um, thank
you for statewide.
Um
Um, unique in that there are
many different
I encourage you to work with
hub.
Schools. There hasn't been
A lot.
About Duran in school, and so I
would really encourage you to
Um
To make sure that we're looking
at
All of I wanted to ask has the
day
Or sought out the the reason why
I ask
They want all their kids in L.
And so I wonder. Have you
thought
At all about having potential
DUP in to pre K of
There's AD, and you had
mentioned that something about
Um, bus transportation is the
district planning on burros? Or
is this still up to families to
transport? Um
So at this point in terms of
Um
The other issue, um, on
transportation. That was just an
example that Washington
And in New Jersey.
And it's very untenable. I mean
that, and right now, the
littering it will be.
Parents dropping off the gear.
Will that work, which is, um UN
M with to kind of we have to.
It's not being done before. What
is clear? What was very clear
was is
And hopefully some of the
community providers before and
after. Cares at our and the
food, you know, we we are
throwing out different kinds of
ideas and thank you very much.
We shall be work. We, our, our
early childhood team.
Is working close. We've already
found some, and it makes a lot
of
I absolutely understand the
district. It's important to, um
I would just
You know, I? I do think even as
a parent
As you describe who may not be
able to transport their three or
four year old, but they could
take him to a class in their
community by walking or just
really think about that. If
you're if you're moving your
entire that that doesn't become
a barrier for some families to
even
Um and and really thinking about
Not only how do we manage our
facility needs
Um, I think is something that
that we all need to do better,
including following up with you
all.
I
Just saying
So currently in regulation. Vans
are not
Now we can't do anything before
and after
Mr Chair. Um, we did.
Yes, mister Chair. Would you
like me to read the motion and
All right. So the EMS
subcomittee, um, has emotion in
front. Uh and that is move to
adopt the fiscal year. T Capital
Outlay funding cycle based on
the fiscal year.
Uh, So July opened the capital

provide notes from those
meetings. The
Just know that it would be
detrimentally impactful.
The A MS subcomittee
I will defer to staff on that in
just a
Uh, yes. And, uh, Mr Chair just
to clarify you're talking about
whether it would trigger a
second award cycle, right? I
believe that is going to be
based on. Um, uh, inquiries from
local schools or from school
districts to PS
Uh, yes, mr Chair, so we provide
an opportunity to discuss this
since we have, uh um Antonio
here. Uh, one might have but the
emotion that a MS is bringing
forth is that council approved
to utilize PE D certified 80 or
the facility? Master plan, PS
could go into this in in a lot
of depth was discussed at both
subcommittees, but I just wanted
to again, um provide,
particularly there's, uh,
questions going to have 80th day

Mr Chair.
On the current enrollment data
earlier, um lacked the equal.
Um
I could go through a host of
materials, but II I save as
Associated with enrollment.

Mr Chair. Um The reason being is
