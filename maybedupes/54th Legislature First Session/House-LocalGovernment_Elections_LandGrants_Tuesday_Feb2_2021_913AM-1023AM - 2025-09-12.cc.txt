Thank you for that opportunity
are are.
Mr by the M..
Identify yourself
and feel free to elaborate on
the legislation before us.
Eight thank you.
Mr chair Garcia members of the
committee my name is Robert
could be on the CEO of the
metropolitan court.
And has Representative Trujillo
mentioned we are proposing a
change to an S. and M. S. A.
nineteen seventy eight section
thirty five six dash one E. of
increasing the mediation fee
from five dollars to fifteen
dollars.
The main reason for this is for
us to fully set state
Our mediation program right now
the five dollars only allows
this to pay about a third of the
FTEs that are needed in the
program.
We're hoping that we can go up
that ten ten dollar increase
will maintain the entire program
so that's what we're looking to
accomplish over the last two
years a mediation program of
reviewed over eight hundred and
fifty basis.
Which did not have to go in
front of our three civil judges.
which is we're.
Huge of in the mediation program
we got sixty volunteers they
weren't paid that we're
volunteer mediators that were
able to resolve these cases with
within a timely fashion opposed
to going through the judicial
process one of the key things to
this is only going to be
affecting Bernalillo county
that's the only county that it's
going to be affecting.
and with that I'll stand for
questions Mr by the before I go
to the audience in terms of
those and support and those
against.
can you elaborate in terms of
the mediation process.
And also what triggers the
mediation process who creates
the process or mediation to
occur and and what does what is
the criteria in terms of of
Canada viable of qualified for
the mediation process so can you
elaborate on those points
Mr chairman of Garcia definitely
so when a civil case is filed
of.
That initially of the our our
first glances we always refer
landlord tenant cases to our
mediation process and then our
judges also re for a basis when
they get on like debt
collections as well to the
mediation process and
immediately once our mediation
program identifies these cases
and they get the parties
involved and a contact them and
within a few weeks set up a
mediation for them and this also
involves Colleen of the
volunteer mediators to set that
process up.
Currently we have three of our
we have three of.
US FTEs and our mediation
program which usually some of
them do mediate some of them of
the cases but the majority are
done by volunteer mediators.
Okay Mr Burciaga so in those two
cases then mediation triggers
is mediation is triggered in
terms of a civil case involving
landlord tenant issues and also
that echo actions is there
other.
Cases in which the mediation is
also triggered.
Chair Garcia members of
committee there are occasions
where some of our criminal
judges will refer cases to our
mediation program which usually
involves dispute between
neighbors some some cases like
that are referred to very few
criminal cases are referred to
our mediation program the
majority are all civil cases but
there is an indication.
Okay thank you very much for
that the clarification of the
opt I'll go to the audience and
the audience I'll be asking you
to fill in a survey.
In terms of posed and also
in support Gabby can you pop up
that survey so that we can all
stand.
And
Of course I had to Mr chairman.
So attendees at.
Want to see the survey there it
is and I think we have like so
many seconds is that right
Gabby.
I believe you have sixty seconds
to all we'll give you like
thirty seconds.
so start right now in terms of
the survey before you you could
see it see that it says are you
in opposition or support of
house bill ninety one
make your make your choice right
now.
In opposition or support those
of you in the.
Iranians in the attendee that

Okay we're done with the survey.
Gabby what what are the totals.
So I'm for the question of are
you in opposition or support of
HB ninety one to increase
measure Courtney deviation few
Max we have five showing is

Okay
I'll still go to those in
opposition that maybe weren't
able to access the all of these

Good morning Mr chairman and
committee some have chocolate
the administrative office of the
courts standing in support of
this legislation which is part
of the judiciary's unified
budget thank you.
Thank you for that agency budget
go that's all we see in terms of
support
We'll go to
Committee for questions.
Discussion.
And I see
Representative Lukhan with their
hand up Senator hi.
Mr chair thank you good morning
everybody good morning to our
sponsor an expert witness
I just want to more comments and
maybe a couple questions but
I fully support mediation and I
am a volunteer mediator myself
and I guess
my question is and I might miss
this is how many mediation cases
Mr chair I have a.
Have they say that they've
worked on their Bernalillo
county.
Yes
yes that over eight hundred is
that correct I want.
Mr I knew response to the
question.
Mr chair Garcia members of the
committee we reviewed an average
of over eight hundred and fifty
cases in all those cases of pre.
Pandemic we were resolving about
seventy eight percent of those
cases and then during the
pandemic we were not as
successful that was closer to
fifty percent of those cases.
Mr chair Mr Padilla thank you so
much for that and that that just
that just goes to show how
effective you know dispute
resolution through mediation is
and
I really support this much my
other question Mr chair is
are you looking at case blue
throughout the state or I know
that this is of.
Specific to Bernalillo county
but how are you looking to help
other other places in the state
other counties in the state Mr
chairman.
Mr chairman of Garcia members of
the committee.
This would only affect
Bernalillo county although we do
work with other jurisdictions in
the state to help them a start
up that mediation program we
work with a few other districts
just because we you know we are
very proactive here at the
Bernalillo county and that we
have such a robust mediation
program that everybody comes to
us to kind of.
Pick our minds on how we started
and where we went so we are
helping that west the rest of
the judiciary with the mediation
program.
Mr chair Mister president
Representative thank you for
that thank you for answer those
questions I think that
that is very important you
taking the the the leadership on
this and one last question so
are you saying to helping them
so you're so you're able to
spread your budget to help those
those other programs come about
Mr chair.
All.
Yes I for fund House
Appropriations so we've been
listening to all of the Courts
and the role of the state office
of the courts of budget and they
are really brain that this time
for this is a perfect
opportunity.
Who support for profit.
Rave reviews thank you.
Thank thank you Mr chair thank
you Representative Trujillo yes
and I think that just a comment
just for future as we're moving
out of COVID like we are on.
That we're going to see more
more chances more opportunities
for mediation just I think that
this is this is a an important
aspect of our court system and I
appreciate you bringing this
legislation forward thank you.
Thank you representative.
Okay
And it's good to hear the line.
Surname in that in that session
again.
You know we missed our good that
Fran the speaker vendor line so
much you know so it's it's it's
good at least to kind of hear
that surname again kicked around
in our in our session.
members I I don't see any hands
up from committee members for
questions or discussion I I
Representative a month earlier
questions discussion.
Mr chair and representative
Trujillo thank you so much for
this opportunity I have a
question about this well I
completely support the mediation
process I understand the
challenges that citizens face.
But many of our citizens that
are court involved are in
poverty's situations and so I'm
wondering what is the impact of
increasing even though it's just
seems from five dollars to
fifteen is that an impediment.
And will it costs more to
collect those fees than what it
will accomplish.
All Representative Montoya
Mr Stewart and I spoke.
About this as well.
Funds and this really will help
many people but there is some
support and I know that Mr PH
thank you for this so that.
Because the needs to be.
Of the food both.
Mr Mr Campbell who that money
after free to respond to the
question.
Mr chair Garcia members of the
committee
These these these are filing
fees also I just wanted to let
you know for those indigent
individuals we do have a service
for pre filing fee so they won't
be effective.
And we also have our self help
center that would help these
individuals bill bill out the
forms and follow the process so
we do have that and it is
current today and so we are we
are we do have an area where we
can definitely help those
individuals who are indigent.
Mr Mr chairman and
Representative Trujillo have you
done a an analysis of how much
money could potentially come in
and would that number be
sufficient to cover those FTE
positions.
Mr chair Garcia members of the
committee we have done the
analysis and we do feel that
increasing it from five dollars
to ten dollars would be able to
sustain our two and a half FTEs
at this time.
Thank you.
Are you back to the chair
Representative Montoya and and
also
Representative Trujillo the
mediation process.
It is of no cost also to our.
To the clients and in that
process if I'm correct
and
you know
This mediation process is is
very I think crucial.
I am very prudent.
In terms of resolving conflicts
short of having to go through
the court process
and I can attest to that because
I when I was going through my
divorce
we went through family court.
And that was such a I think of.
a very
important process in terms of
the emotions that we're still
very
And I met in terms of
myself and my ex wife in terms
of having to deal with these
issues of of a divorce and
so I could see the benefit you
know mediation in terms of what
the metro court has in place and
very much support these efforts
and I I really applaud the
efforts of a metro court brown
county to also reach out to our
our our rural communities
in rural counties in terms of
helping them initiate similar
models in their locales but I'll
I'll turn to Representative
Christine Trujillo
Senator he are
and you give you the bringing
amendment for and I have it
before me.
And the.
And I did not accept that in
terms of it coming from you know
because we have this twenty four
hour rule where we have to get
the amendment over to our
analysts
and then also
run it to the members but if
this amendment is not real
substantive in that it really
doesn't change the nature of
some of the concepts in the
legislation
and it's basically like a
clarifying
amendment let's see if we can't
it's gonna interacting that
through the the membership so
can you are and you read the
amendment and tell us where it
is on the bill.
Yes on the bottom of your page
it's one two one nine five one
seven point one.
Well we see the and it says
on page one.
All of.
On page five.
Nineteen and twenty.
Following news section.
Thank
you for effective date of the
provisions of this act the live
one.
When you twenty one if he does
that the effective date I.
You can.
And our Representative where did
this idea for the amendment come
from.
It from some analysis that was
done or where did it come from.
this idea and I will.
Okay
Analysts.
Chair
this is to be analyzed George
and Howard
What the **** your head.
it's in terms of how we do
legislation is this is this
amendment really needed.
In terms of us press one
effective date.
Because there's a protocol in
terms of the way we passed bills
if it doesn't have a an
emergency class the bill goes
into effect right.
What is it four months six
months.
Ninety days ninety days yeah
ninety days.
At the end of the session to be
clear Mr chairman members say it
is typical that are built.
More or fail to show a
projected date and yes there's
an automatic
affected day to take place
ninety days or so after the
session so basically anything
when the session finishes is
affected by July first anyway
are you have a specific the
relative to other legislation
rather statutory requirements
that process it takes a specific
date.
Omitting it makes no difference
now
right Representative Trujillo I
don't know if you want to.
We say that date for some
purpose.
An investigation yes it should
be used.
The agency that I think that
Because this is what we want for
I including that affect the
state so I felt that it was
important to include that but
not that that is that maybe days
if the bill is passed
by the absurd have enough.
Yeah.
Mr chair Garcia members of the
committee of the reason we
wanted to start on July one is
because it's beginning of the
fiscal year and it's easier for
us to track as far as revenues
concern and it's easier us for
us to.
Keep track of the revenue and
pay for our FTEs at that point.
Mr chairman I think that
specificity is is required in
this case.
Thank you for that.
Thank you for that cover do you
have anything to add.
No Sir I'm trying to get to
figure out how to unmute my
audio Eurosport as far as I see
it looks like the dating would
be important at this point.
Okay thank you are members and
I'd like to move an amendment.
And the amendment basically is
what was stated
on page five between nine
nineteen and twenty which is
which is the very last thing on
on the legislation which is page
five in in between lines
nineteen and twenty we would
insert the following.
Section two the fact that the
effective date of the provisions
of this act is July first twenty
twenty one and of course period.
is there a second.
The second Representative
Fajardo as requested discussion
on the amendment.
I see none is our opposition to
the amendment.
Seen on the amendment is adopted
Representative here you have a
and Amanda that
bill at do you wish to close on
the legislation before we go to
The vote.
Yes qualified for the dog in the
back.
But the issue is that this is of
Bill that is that I think
correct some some issues
regarding sufficiency in funding
from our.
For questions from the mediation
process
I think it's a good move forward
until we figure out how to pay
for increasing costs of even
with the courts in the state of
New Mexico thank you Mr chairman

the committee.
Do you pass.

questions discussion on the
motion I mean on on the on the
legislation as amended seen none

Give me a Jason is on there can

Of course Mr chair.
Is the on board Gabby.
Yes Mr chair is the Mr clock is
with us.
Okay thank you Representative
now we have a.
House bill one forty six.
Transfers and duties to district
courts Representative David not
to put on your legislation on
mute yourself.
Good morning Mr chair and
members of the committee thank
you for your time and
consideration I am here today to
present house bill one forty six
just for a bit of context in
April of two thousand nineteen
the New Mexico Civil of court
convened something called the
New Mexico judiciary leadership
summit in which together they
explored initiatives to improve
efficient and effective services
to our New Mexico Public out of
those meetings in the summer of
twenty eighteen they piloted a
program first in the twelfth
judicial district to moved the
the authority of the magistrate
courts from AOC directly under
the chief judge of of that host
District Court so they first
tried that approach in the
twelfth later throughout twenty
eighteen and early twenty
nineteen the expanded that pilot
into the night sixth my home
District Court the third and
eventually eleven District Court
finally issuing a Supreme Court
order on April twelfth of twenty
nineteen that did affect every
given chief judges of these
district courts the Authority
and administrative authority
over the district and magistrate
courts within their respective
judicial districts also Mr chair
today house bill one forty six
is about solidifying that order
into our New Mexico statutes one
last piece I want to offer
before we move over to my
experts is that the budgets
moved from these magistrates
into the district courts as well
as part of the Supreme Court
order beginning in FY twenty
also we're now the second year
of of of of the district court's
holding their budgets for this
responsibility Mr chair I was
especially invested in this
effort as I knew the third
District Court where I
Representative thing in a county
had been part of the original
pilot and in my mind if we can
find ways.
To make our systems of
government more efficient and
effective we absolutely should
explore those ways and
eventually move in that
direction I appreciated that
this decision came out of AOC in
the courts with a lot of
thoughtfulness and and and
preparation including this
expensive pilot before they
finalize their order in twenty
nineteen also Mr chair if it's
appropriate I'd like to
introduce Jason clack who will
be I expert witness today Jason
as I've named is the director of
court operations at the
administrative office of the
courts Mr chair.
Jason you yourself and feel free
to elaborate on the significance
of the legislation before us.
Thank you Mr chairman members of
the committee yes managers and
clack the director of the core
operations division for the AOC
and the corporations division is
what came after what was
previously the magistrate court
division of the AOC so when the
AOC directly oversaw the
administration of the magistrate
courts we had the magistrate
court Division after this
consolidation we transitioned
that Division into what's now
the court operations division so
we do still keep some
administrative oversight of the
magistrate courts and now
working with the district
court's more closely for example
one of my duties as I am the
legal adviser for the magistrate
courts so that is a rule that
the the AOC is still keeping in
house we also manage the
magistrate court facilities
and we also
do oversee internal auditing for
the magistrate courts so we we
are at the magistrates courts on
on our processes and we do that
kind of on a rolling basis where
we can audit each court every
five years or so and in addition
to that we manage the the
warning for sent fund which is
used to
to citation entry for up for the
quartz as well as run a customer
service unit for all the courts
so that we have a central number
that people can call they can
get information about their case
and on how to proceed so the HSD
is still of keeping those kind
of a broader responsibilities
regarding my district courts but
the purpose of the console.
Shin was to give day to day
oversight and management to
those local district courts
because they're they're in the
same communities as the
magistrate courts whereas AOC as
you know is operated essentially
out of Santa Fe with a few
offices and other parts of the
state but
But AOC can't be everywhere at
once like the district courts so
that's the reason that the
Supreme Court decided to
consolidate the day to day
oversight and administration of
the measure course into the
district courts
and.
I hope you'll have a copy of
those consolidation orders that
we sent out as a handout so
you'll see in those orders how
are the consolidations rolled
out we did the pilot programs as
Representative Cadena explained
and
then all the courts were fully
consolidated as of July first
two thousand nineteen
so the district courts have been
managing the magistrate courts
for about a year and a half now
and
As is also explained we did
transfer all of the the
operating funds that AOC had to
manage the magistrate courts we
can we transfer all those to the
district courts to to cover all
those responsibilities that were
transferred to the district
courts and
So that's why we're bringing
this legislation now because the
statue still require some
oversight
by the A. O. C. that is is
really more appropriate for the
district courts now under the
consolidation such as allowing
the.
Chief district judge to a point
the presiding magistrate judge
in those courts are allowing the
district courts to manage the
finances of the magistrate
courts and allowing the district
courts to directly hire and
manage staff we're magistrates
courts that way the district
we're still have to go through
AOC in order to accomplish those
Those those things that they
really need to manage the day to
day operations no that'll stand
for any questions thank you
Jason and Representative guy
then I.
It is that it on your
presentation on house bill one
forty six yes Mr chair thank you
thank you.
Do not go to the audience are
audience
we're going to valued to respond
to a survey in terms of support
or opposition it's it's on your
screen right now and so you have
about thirty seconds.
Those in support or those in
opposition to mark
you are
your your block your your your
square in terms of of opposition
or support of the legislation.
you've got the.
Fifteen seconds.
Five seconds.
Thanks.
Gabby what we show on on the
survey.
None in opposition.
At two in support I'll still
recognize those in opposition
if there's anyone that wishes to
speak in opposition please raise
your hand.
seen none we'll go to those in
support those wishing to to
speak in support please raise
your hand.
We have a Synthia project
both Cynthia can you identify
yourself and feel free to
address the committee in terms
of support for the legislation.
Good morning Mr chairman and
members of the committees and
have trouble with the
administrative office of the
courts again here rising in
support of this legislation
which is part of the unified
budget for the judiciary thank
you.
Others in the in support that
wish to address the committee.
seen none we'll go to questions
discussion from the committee we
have a Representative Serrato
and Representative lu Han start
off with Representative Serrato.
Unmute yourself into thank you.
Can you hear me.
Yes thank you Mr chairman and
thank you to the sponsors of
this bill I just had one
question purely out of curiosity
them I just want to kind of get
a better understanding of how
these things impact on how much
time do you feel it does that
does the sponsor and or witness
feel that this may impact like a
are we saying that this would
save months in terms of of you
know day today or is this more
like ours I'm just this is just
for curiosity's sake.
Mr clock it be my of share your
insight on to this question Mr
chair thank you Mr back on
yourself and and feel free to
respond to the question.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative Serrato it it
does depend on on on page
provisions some of the
provisions yes it could save
several weeks or appointing a
new presiding magistrate judge
for example
where the currently the chief
district judge has to
make a recommendation to the
director of the AOC then the a
and director of AOC has to.
you know communicate back and
forth and then you know make the
formal appointment whereas if
the chief district judge has the
authority they can just do that
right away for other things that
will save some time on
maybe a day or so for the
District Court to more
efficiently process and manage
the magistrate court financials
so one of the provisions will
allow the District Court to
actually
manage the trust accounts in the
magistrate courts where is now
each man District Court has to
have its own separate trust
account so that will save a lot
of time and processing of the
financials.
Thank you Mr chairman and thank
you for that that response was
to collect I really do
appreciate having that
guidance of what we're looking
at here primarily because I you
know when we're looking at our
modern world even towards the
future everything is moving so
rapidly in all of these hold ups
and ensure fifty years ago a
week is nothing couple weeks is
nothing and today I twenty four
hours really can go completely
up and that this works I really
do appreciate this the
sponsoring this forward I preach
that response I feel that my
time thank you Mr chairman.
Thank you Representative Serrato
next we have Representative of
the time.
I mean yourself there you go
good morning thank you Mr chair
and thank you for a sponsor and
our expert witness this morning
and I I just really do apologize
I had to take a call during some
of the the information was being
passed on and so I know that
this is the historical
perspective of this Mr chair
Representative Cadena and you
mentioned that that the we
already have a lot of this in
place it administratively in
place I do too at the Supreme
Court ruling and judgement knock
on wood I believe was the the
supreme justice you initiated
this and getting this in place
administratively
I guess my question is I I've
heard.
A little bit of concern for some
from some of some of are
magistrates and and they're not
completely happy about maybe
having that in the
administrative overhead for them
and that's okay I understand
streamline I know this and I
really appreciate that but I I
would like to ask on the budget
issue of this I'm.
A concern this calm and I just
want to work this out have a
discussion about the funding for
the for this and how this may
could affect
our rural
Courts specifically related to
our drug courts that this set
the budgetary early that this
would be more
this wouldn't lend itself to
help those those rural
communities like it did in the
past can you talk a little bit
about that Mr chair
Representative.
Mr chair representative Kevin I
think you Representative lu Han
thank you.
For that helpful question Mr
chair just Representative we
kind of look like related I
think but that's that's another
story thank you.
Yes there in the Mr chair
representative will not and then
we're just seeing these bears
more more images back of
ourselves every day certainly a
disconnect from real life when I
could be in front of you and and
speaking to you in a way that I
imagine would faster much more
community in connection so god
bless us as we work through this
virtual session Mr chair
representative lu Han and when
AOC approached me with this bill
I certainly had a lot of the
same questions and I think it's
really important that we have
rural voices that speak to the
impacts of some of the statewide
decisions in our home
communities every day also
certainly that the drug court
conversation is come up and I'll
have Mr Clark speak to that in
just a minute but I I did want
to offer.
in terms of budgeting I myself
do not have a seat on House
Appropriations but certainly I
know that when I'm in my
conversations with local courts
and and the third district that
we we need more resources that
this is our branch of government
that certainly continues to ask
for an investment that matches
their responsibility we
continue to hear about staffing
vacancies across our state both
on the court side on the public
defender side also any chance I
get I wanted to to continue
raising shout out how important
courts are especially in our
rural communities that's often a
place or you can hold the
essence of a community together
I know I will give a little
shout out to my small town judge
who is still with me in the last
sixty day session of his passes
that judge Fritz and and our
little tiny municipal court what
is US dollar of what our town
was I remember once I had a call
from him and he said I did a
California stop through a three
way this but it's between my
home and where he lives in our
tiny post office and certainly
he keep an eye on me and make
sure he calls me when AOC was
was presenting anything that
would change the way our courts
work in small towns also I
certainly first take this with a
grain of salt that that the
Supreme Court had already put
out this order that effectively
did move
the every day and day to day
operations into the hands of the
District Court and again this
legislation is is really
solidifying a couple of
remaining elements that we're
beyond the scope of that order
Mr chair representative I
appreciate the question and if
Mr clap might weigh in
specifically to the drug court
question and other pieces that
might be relevant Mr chair thank
you.
Senator Frida elaborate thank
you Mr chairman Representative
lu Han yes well I think that's
one of the reasons why
the court the consolidation was
a good idea because the district
courts are in the same
communities as the magistrate
courts
and and AOC is and we don't
always have the time and
resources at the AOC to get out
to all the courts and and really
see what their needs were on on
a day to day or week to week
basis but the the district
courts are there and we have the
district courts would be better
advocates for what the actual
needs are for the magistrate
courts and also another purpose
of this was a to kind of meld
the resources of the magistrate
courts with those of the
district courts
So you know we as a so we
transferred the budget the AOC
had to the district courts for
all the operating expenses that
that we were paying for those
operations that were transferred
but
the district courts now have
that combined with the District
Court resources which we of
course fully advocate the
district court's being being
fully funded as well but now
those district courts
Managing the magistrate courts
can use the combined resources
and hopefully make more
effective and and better use of
those resources then and the AOC
could
One of the provisions of this
bill is to mailed the
magistrate court drug court fund
into the district court drug
court fund so those Jr court
funds that are paid
to the magistrate court we'll go
into the district court drug
court fund so that the that
funds combined so that the
district courts can use that
money where it is most needed
and so those those a big reason
and so this consolidation and
also like to add that on this.
This change legislation should
not create any additional
burdens are responsibilities
about what what currently exists
under the consolidation orders
is just to make things work more
efficiently and effectively.
Thank you Mr chair Mr Clark
thank you for that so I'm also
human resources director.
And so.
I guess the questions that I
lie with me right now is if we
have an administrative
Policy in place.
Why does it have to be in law.
Senator and governor Mr chair
representative lu Han certainly
the US already of the Supreme
Court to issue the order that
they did in twenty nineteen is
pretty broad reaching and most
of the day to day operations as
explained by Mr Clark have
already been taken over and
fully executed as of July first
twenty nineteen these are a
couple of just the parts that
still remain in statute that
need that clean up as for
instance
as the district court's already
now hold the budgets and the
money they're still having to
run through AOC for official
approval or should one of our
magistrate judges
Leave a vacancy for whatever
reason they're still having to
come back to Santa Fe in order
to a point that new the
presiding magistrate judge also
it's mostly that if if we're
giving them the weight and
responsibility of overseeing the
stated a appropriations that
these are a couple of key
components that's that in law
other still having to come back
to Santa Fe and it it just
doesn't match the weight of what
we're asking them to do.
Mr chair and representative.
Mr chair Representative thank
you for the answer is very clear
financer appreciate that
so this really goes into the
budget
making that that making a
streamline to codify this into
law so that the budget is in
place for for these
misstatements rate of changes
and I I understand that what
were I'm still gonna ask about
is the drug the drug courts in
our rural communities Mr chair
and representative do you
foresee that this will have a
negative effect on on our on our
rural magistrate courts and
because now that this this
budget consolidation
Have you looked at that do you
have any information on that and
that being an issue because now
you're taking graduated from
local and putting into into a
bigger bucket so to speak how do
they have access to that.
Thank you Mr.
Mr chair representative will
hunt thank you I just want to
first affirmatively say I'm a
big big believer of the drug
courts I know and and I
understand that addiction in our
state as a health care issue not
a crime and certainly when
people become system involved I
know that this mechanism through
these courts means potentially a
pathway an opportunity said to a
different kind of safety and
stability for people I just want
to clear clarify again and then
I'll turn it over to Mr clock
the budgets have already moved
what this legislation does is
clarify that these budgets can
now be managed by the District
Court without having to turn
back to Santa Fe so so the
money's there the money has
moved from AOC where they used
to hold it for the magistrates
to these District Court as of
fiscal year twenty also the
money's moved this is doctor who
has authority and oversight to
finalize those budgets and in my
mind if we're giving
responsibility to a more local
body in in this case the
District Court and I AOC in
Santa Fe and I don't expect that
they should have to turn the
Santa Fe up to explain or
justify or name what they're
doing it is real that in
deciding to do so in twenty
nineteen and moving this money
we did move some
responsibilities out not me the
Supreme Court move.
Mr chair representative on some
responsibilities including and
out to finalize and solidify
this and this legislation the
drug courts my hope is and this
again was a big question for me
is that by brief by putting more
resources in the same pot
together we can expand the
efficacy of these courts to make
sure that they have enough
resources to to offer slots when
somebody needs it so that they
have somewhere in that district
room to to be open and to hear
and hear cases and and see folks
in a way that it's like the
timing and rhythm of their life
again this is a for me something
I can support because we're in
under resource state and we just
don't have enough to go around
so sometimes we have to make
those hard decisions is it
better for us a more strategic
to get a little bit out
everywhere or to do something
that's more resources and has
more support that can bring
people closer to the services
they need it's a hard call
certainly but I I hope that each
of our district courts is in a
place to manage these
responsibilities with the
integrity that our New Mexicans
deserve Mr chair representative
lu Han I would like Mr clack to
speak to that and hopefully be
able to reinforce what it's
going to look like for people
that need Dr point in New
Mexico.
Thank you president pro
freighter spot thank you Mr
chair representative lu Han
yes so well it.
I guess taking at
and putting it into the District
Court budgets is actually taking
it from one one big pot that was
managed by the AOC and putting
it into
more smaller local pots of money
that are now managed by the the
district courts
so previously the the drug court
Fund was was just one big fund
for the magistrate courts that
was managed by the AOC and now
we are giving more local control
through this legislation to the
district courts and and now the
district courts have that
I'm administrative to our
oversight responsibility just
like they do with with the
district courts to effectively
and efficiently manage the
magistrate courts as well so
they they were they wouldn't
show any favoritism to one
quarter over another because it
there it's all part of the same
system and they have a fiduciary
responsibility to all the courts
that they manage to make sure
that other managed effectively
and we so they're in a better
position to do that on a day to
day basis and AOC wants so no it
with this should help the drug
courts if anything and at least
on a local level least making
sure that they
have the budget that they need
to operate and AOC does still
have some oversight of the drug
courts we do have a drug court
coordinator who helps coordinate
of the the drug courts for the
district courts and the
magistrate courts
so.
that those courts are all
They're probably resource as far
as AOC can help make sure that
they're following best standards
and practices and of course you
know we advocate for for their
full funding.
Thank you.
The the Hon thank you Mr chair
and and thank you for those this
clarifying responses and the
reason why I'm I'm kind of just
hammering on this or focusing on
this is because for the same
reasons that Representative
could then you mentioned it is
you know these are serious
issues across our state and we
know that as we look at
statistics information.
Across the state our rural
communities are severely
affected.
And so I just want to make sure
that those that we're discussing
this and that this is this is
something that we're very clear
on and I don't
I say this I want to make sure
that our rural courts a rural
communities are are protected
especially with with what we
have going with this drug courts
because they're so important
integral and I do understand our
budget to and what we try to do
and make sure that our our
courts are funded and it's it's
hard to do that in a lot of ways
and understand you're the need
there and there is a great need
there as well so I I appreciate
the thoughtful and the the
explanations of.
That you clarified with me today
on this issue
And I just hope that this is
this is the effect of this bill
in regards to that that that
that part of the budget and how
that's come together I
appreciate your time Mr chair
Preciado time Representative
continued could and that and Mr
clack thank you thank you
representative on next we have
Representative a Este ano.
I'm.
But in a and Mr black and just
your date with Mrs to Hans and
you know I I'm really concerned
about our rural communities and
you know I know a OCD's budget
is kind of tight and there's a
lot of agencies because I am on
House Appropriations and you
know that's alarming because we
yesterday we had a committee and
and I and I think you know by
moving shifting over to the
District Court I think it helps
eliminate some of those those
positions are not filled and I
think we can maybe the.
Pay better attention from
magistrates that the you know
because we don't have the
entities that you guys are
lacking and I think it's a good
thing together responsibly
District Court but I'm my
concern was and I think I got
hazard like Representative Han
these rural communities what
effect is going to have on the
drug courts and and I think you
guys for clarifying that and and
I think it's a good thing the
way the budget is now and it's a
good thing for for you guys so
they can get the attention they
need throughout the state and I
think you guys.
Thank.
Stana I don't see any other
hands up from the members of the
committee
And you know I I kind of a.
Support the legislation terms of
its efforts I know the turmoil
that are administrative courts
have gone through.
Are you know in the twenty four
years I've been up here I I
serve on judiciary and even here
this local government committee
we do get some are legislation
regarding magistrates
and
so I kind of any empathize with
them and I think this movie
really kind of is a step forward
in terms of really addressing
those lack of resources that are
magistrates have Starkey had to
deal with I just want to share
one story I know that resent
that and not mentioned model
magistrate judge in our area and
the I I I I want to share an
experience that I had with the
magistrate and in my hometown of
to comparing New Mexico you know
I graduated from eastern and and
moved on here in my community.
Where I'm at right now not the
school on to some property.
that have been in the family
for centuries
but I still have connections to
mile down there into can carry
and I had some calls from a some
to contract of this that we're
looking at what they call the
hanging judge of a magistrate
judge.
And so I kind of moved up visit
with them and we set up we need
to establish a oversight plan to
where we we take turns going
into that court whenever he has
cases involving a Chicano
centric on us because he was
really kind of slamming
sentences on on the native
Chicano Chicana population there
to come by giving them the
maximum on almost every case
that went before him involving
these people but yet he was real
life with the I know
white individuals that went in
there many times
I've been there there
their their citations or
violations or giving them the
minimum that's why people call
them the hanging judge.
So it was my turn I offered at
take a day.
And of and and move and go down
there and see it in you know for
one day and a case came up with
the Chicano he had some citation
there was a the police officer
with them he forgot something in
the car the magistrate court
the magistrate judge told the
the gentleman to get the
document from the car and and
for the W. a police officer to
go with them.
And that naturally the judge
knew who I was because of this
issue I have been in the paper
where we had kind of question is
kind of racist acts towards G.
Kernan Chicana us so the the the
W. and the and and the
individual walk out of the
courtroom and we're we're the
only ones in there.
And so then he gets up and he
was a giant of a man you know
and
Maybe six for whatever two
hundred fifty pounds and I was
this skinny G. gonna unite a
hundred thirty five pounds you
know so then he gets up and he
says you there blabber.
Any charges that me was going to
beat me up so we're I'm we're
running around the benches of
the court you know and then all
of a sudden the W. and and the
final of the violation walk in
we just kind of freeze
and he wants to let me walk back
to the the judge the I walked
back to my pension.
That's a memorable experience in
a in terms of the magistrate
judge a but having said that.
Representative cannot do you
wish to close on the
legislation.
Mr chair thank you and for that
sorry we have to stay only in
New Mexico right I just wanted
to offer in closing I appreciate
the conversation today and
certainly my first chance to
come before your committee this
year and get to see your faces
and and meet your new members
I just lost also wanted to add
in my short term in the New
Mexico legislature it's been
really important for me to
understand the way I three
branches of government work and
we often hear a lot and invest a
lot in our what's happening up
stairs on the fourth floor what
they're up to but AOC is
important our courts are
important they certainly shape
the lives of our New Mexicans
every day
as a as a my laughter shared
with the member what AOC calls
and if I if it's a bill that
fundamentally I can agree with I
said yes because I want to build
better relationships with our
justices but actually justice
with our director port
operations of you'll have the
chance certainly I think just
continue to remember that these
are also relationships of course
we have our our separate Ortiz
and grandmothers to what we each
do out but for me I'm I take on
those like this and again
fundamentally I believed in it
but also that means that I I
know Mr cracked a little bit
better so I a question about
drug court in my district court
we know for sure I'm gonna call
and say and ask employers as to
why you know potentially there's
a question or concern with drug
court so I would just encourage
you all get to know mystic mac
Selena Gomez the general counsel
is outstanding as well remember
that we all have opportunities
like this to keep an eye on each
other throughout our different
branches and and when something
isn't as we expect or we have an
idea that could make it better
remember that we can have these
conversations between our
branches the hopefully show up
for our families in ways they
deserve I also missed with that
Mr chair I would ask for support
consideration of house bill one
forty six from you can.
Many here today thank you
Representative and then I
without the members what is the
wish of the committee.
I make a motion for do pass.
Listen
that what.
One billion and I saw
Representative the content go up
in the second.
So we have a second by
Representative on members is
there further questions
discussion on the legislation.
seen none is there opposition to
the do pass recommendation.
I see none.
Secretary let the record reflect
that all those present ordered
in the affirmative
Representative cannot.
You have a do pass.
Commendation on house bill one
forty six thank you.
Members that does that for our
committee today
are start up time is going to be
nine o'clock from here on out
not if unless we run into a
scheduling problem with a floor
session that might be wanting to
start up at ten.
Then we're gonna start a meeting
earlier than nine o'clock but so
from now on just going to keep
the nine o'clock time in mind
and will definitely work be a
little bit more adamant in terms
of the the link information to
you all so that you receive it a
day before and then also shortly
before the committee starts on
the day of the committee hearing
and no less than fifteen minutes
before the committee that way it
that that link pops up to the
top and also some of us will try
to kind of have the lean.
But on our tab where we can just
hit that tab and it'll
automatically take us to the
committee hearing and and and
kind of by passing the the email
a daily link to the committee
hearing some members that if we
don't have any other business we
stand adjourned god bless you
and that will be voting on the
on the virtual voting system
today for the first time because
we went over last time so and
the reason that and I want to
share this with the committee if
we ever go over and cut into a
floor session what I have my my
secretary do is excuse us.
So that we don't show up absent
on the on the board.
We were all excused and I also
excuse the bill sponsor so so
don't worry about whether you're
gonna be a excuse or not we
automatically do that as a as a
procedural
action on the part of our our
committee so and that's what we
did the other day we kind of
went that went late and we
barely missed the vote by like
maybe two minutes
but now you have a chance to
kind of hold on the new system
and we'll see you folks on
Thursday we have legenda.
Bless you.
