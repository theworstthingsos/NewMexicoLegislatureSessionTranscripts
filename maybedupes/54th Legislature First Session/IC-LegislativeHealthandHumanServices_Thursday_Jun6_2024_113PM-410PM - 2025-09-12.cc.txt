What that looks like in
family services and what we're
doing to meet families where
they are right now and not
waiting for them to be in
crisis.
>> Thank you, Mr., Chair Committee.
I'm thrilled to be here to talk
to you about our family services
division. We've been
able to bring
for, bring over from
CYFD, our in-home
services. We've also
brought together our
community-based prevention and
intervention and
reunification or it's better
known as CBPIR because
we love our acronyms and
everyone knows what CBPIR
stands for. Um
So we have that
service and that service in particular.
I just want to say that
when we look at the data from
fy 23 we had
97% of the
folks who receive services
did not have an entry into
foster care. So we're
looking at that and we know it's
working for that,
that and that's with our community-based
uh services.
We also have our children's
trust fund. We have keeping
families together, which is a
supported housing program
and intensive case management.
We have our family outreach
program which is
comes into us through
our sky. It May be screened
out and then it goes
over to family outreach to say,
hey, we understand it's
not abuse and neglect, but could you
use some resources? So
for instance, one of a call we
received is we had a young
lady, I think she was
nine and the family
was having difficulty getting a
motorized wheelchair for
her because the systems
are hard to get that
type of equipment. So we
supported that to be able to
help that family
just to get the, the school
was concerned that she didn't have a motorized
wheel wheelchair and we're
like, let's help you do
that. And so we did,
um we also
have our DV programming
has come over and
our youth m is coming
over from um juvenile
justice along
with our families in need of
services or fins cases
will also be coming over.
That should start by
July, that we should be
starting to implement
that from JJ.
Um We also have
Kara now under the family
services department
and we're building out our
differential response or
multilevel services. It's called
a lot of different things
here. Um
So that's when a case comes
in and it's screened
in as yes, but rather
than go into an investigation,
it's going to go into a different
response. And that means
we're gonna say, hey,
how can we help
you to get
the services that you need? Because
we know systems are complicated.
Generally, it's probably gonna
be what's um
considered like neglect,
whether it's medical neglect,
educational neglect could be
physical neglect if
there is an issue in those
cases. And we say
it does need to be an investigation
because there's a lot more going on than
what was originally said,
then we can link back to
investigations, but we're not gonna
start there with those
services. Um,
and we also will
have um,
our
a different family programs
and so what family
services has in it, we
have different contracts. So
we're looking at how do, how will
this work? So we have a
special contract with
like PB and J for
families who are
incarcerated, but they're coming
back, they're being released,
they're still going back to their homes,
they're still working with our
Children. And so we're trying
to link them to services,
to support that
reconnection with the
family. Um We're
looking, we have children's trust
fund and so all of those innovative
contracts that they have,
we're looking at what is working,
what is not working, what would
need, what would they
need
besides money
usually to be able
to elevate what they're
doing. Can other people
replicate this service
in a different community?
Um And sometimes
they can and sometimes they can't. So
we're just looking at them and that's where the
children's trust fund is super
helpful for us because
we're able to do that innovative programming
on a smaller scale to
see what's gonna work.
Um And we all, we have
our family resource
centers that we're in the development
for and
um we've requested
federal dollars to have two
mobile family
resource centers and one
would be in Socorro
and San Juan. And we're looking at
the, the data to
inform us on where we need
to have those centers. So
in a nutshell, that's
family, I could spend hours
talking about it, but that's
family resources.
>> And I think that
as I think as I mentioned earlier,
really, the goal is for us
to really look at families
as a whole
and try to figure out how do we
better support them
so that they're not coming into
an investigation or they're not
entering into our juvenile justice
system so that we can provide those
supports to them right
now today and figure out how
do we keep that family unit
together and to provide
them what they need to maintain
that. Um And that's really
the focus of family services.
I'm excited about the
people that Kathy has put
together on that team. Um
I'm super excited about bringing
Scott over from the administrative
office of the courts to be able
to help us to do this
across the State. We're
building those programs up, we're
hiring those staff.
Um And I think
we're starting to see that, you
know, we're, we're starting to
get people that are coming into
that system aside from
entering into an investigation.
I think just one example is the
end of the school year,
our numbers at the Sky Center
peak, you know,
educators who are leaving for the
summer, who have maybe been
worried about kids for a few
months, wait till
the end of the school year to call that
in because now they're not going to see
them every day and they're going to be
worried about what is happening
to them when they're not coming to school
and we don't have eyes on them. So
those numbers tend to spike
every May early
June. And
for us, that's an opportunity
for us to really reach in through
family services to
determine, you know, is
it that that child just,
they're worried about meals
during the summer because they typically
get fed at school. And
so really looking at how
can we provide those,
you know, through family services
and meet some of those
needs? Um I know that
yesterday there was conversation,
you know, about poverty and I
absolutely agree.
No family should be criminalized
because of poverty. You
know, it's, we have a high level
of poverty in New Mexico and
we need to figure out how do we
better support them.
And I think that it
could be wrong, but I believe
that they're looking at the definition
of neglect as they look at
the revisions for the children's
code. And I know
in a convening that I was at week
before last, um with
the Annie Casey Foundation,
there are several states that
have looked at changing that
definition and I think
it's definitely something that we should
look at and explore in New
Mexico. Um because
really it's our job to support
those families and help them and not
criminalize them or punish
them and it doesn't do us
any good to take those kids
into custody and then try
to, you know, provide foster
parents. And I've often
asked this question of my staff
is like, we're willing to pay somebody
else to make sure that those kids
are safe, but we're not willing
to help those families to make
sure that they can maintain. And
so it's really something that I
think that we need to look at and
figure out how we can do a better
job. Um
As Kathy, Kathy mentioned, we're
doing the family resource
centers. Um Those
are something that came out of a convening
of the, the children's
cabinet. Um And
many states have done those. It's
kind of a one stop shop
in communities where
individuals can come
outside of regular
business out. So they're
open, I believe ours are
gonna be 10 to 7
including Saturdays.
Um And it will be staffed
by private
contractors. And so
we have two that are already
doing soft openings that we're
really excited about.
One is in Valencia County and
one is in um
Dona and
then we have two that are in
the works right now. One is
in Rio Arriba and the
other is in
um Chavis County.
Um And so those two are,
you know, in, we're working
on getting those contracts finalized
and done. But this will
be a place where families
can really come to get
services, whether it be
from a provider or
if we're referring for services,
we have somewhere to refer them
to, but we'll have
all of our State partners
who can provide support
services under
one roof so they can
come in and maybe they just
need, um,
Caniff benefits or maybe
they need snap benefits.
But the co the worker
in that facility can
say, you know, well, you
have a young child
and you know, have you thought about
maybe working, can we help
you do your resume? Can we help you
look for jobs? And in the
meantime, let me walk you over
here and see if we can set you up
with childcare services. And
so really supporting
and doing wraparound services in
one location. Um
And I think that's going to be a
huge change for
families and a service that is
really needed because I don't
know how many of you try to navigate the
system, as she mentioned earlier,
you know, a young
individual who just needed
a wheelchair and it
is so hard to navigate
those systems.
And I often
ask myself, you know, if we
have trouble doing it and we
are the agency that's supposed
to be doing it, what does the
general constituent go
through in trying to reach those
services? And so I
think there are a lot of barriers
in accessing services for
State entities that
hopefully this can bust
through and we're going to do cross
training with the different agencies.
So, you know, AC YFD
employee will know about E
CE CD programs and what's
available. They'll know about
HSD programs. We'll
have workforce in there.
Um Department of Health is
looking to maybe every other Saturday
on a come in and
do immunizations
or different services that
doh can provide. And
so I think if we
can get these across the State in
different communities, um
it'll be huge. We
are using some of the arpa
funding for a start up
costs for a couple of
them. And
we are also um
redoing our plan,
our four E plan. We want
to make sure that these
four E services that we're gonna
be providing, um
which are four E
eligible for
reimbursement, but are
not currently in CYFD
State plan. And
so, um we are looking to
expand what is
eligible for reimbursement
as we rewrite our plan and
submit that for approval.
So we're looking for
federal dollars. We're looking
at uh Medicaid
reimbursement programs
and making sure that we're stretching
the dollars as far as we possibly
can as we set up these services
because I think they'll make
a huge difference for
families.
So I'm gonna switch from family
services and really kind of
talk about how we're tying
that to what we're doing in juvenile
justice. Um
You know, I think last year when I sat
before you, we talked about the
funding that
J Jack receives
for at risk
youth in those
communities. And so,
you know, there are a few barriers
with that that we're finding is
that you have to be a local
government to receive those
funds and sometimes the
local government is not interested
in setting up a board and being the
fiscal agent for that.
Um And so that's something that we're
really exploring is how do we get
those funds out the door
to communities so that
they can set up those programs
for the youth and their community.
We're also expanding
in our
narrow
interpretation of what
at risk means. So
I think the agency has
been very specific
about what an at risk
youth is and who we
serve through those funding
sources. Um
And I truly believe that
every youth in our community
is at risk. Um I
don't think you can say that
somebody is not at risk.
And so we're opening
that up so that we can serve
more youth in those communities.
We're opening it up
so that the communities
themselves can really
dictate to the agency,
what services they believe their
community needs.
Um I believe they should drive
that they should be telling us
knowing their population and
their community, what
they believe that should be
in their State and it shouldn't be
us driving it to say
no, that May sound like a great
program for your community, but
it's not in our current
plan. And so in
meetings over the last
nine months with J Jack,
we really talked about
in their new plan,
opening that up so
that communities have opportunity
to provide what's needed right
then and there and have
opportunity to shift.
So if something comes up mid
year and they really
see a need for a service that
they have opportunity to shift their
funding around and provide that
service. And so I think
that is going to work well with our
family resource centers in those
communities to identify
kids that need additional
services. And
working then with the
family services staff
working more with our J Jack
continuum to
really expand services.
So we currently have,
I believe 14
continuum sites across
the State. We're working on
expansion. I think San
Juan is ready to start
up. We've had several conversations
with them. Um
Fortunately, we were up in
Farmington maybe a month
ago and really had
conversation and got their county
commission to agree
to be the fiscal
agent and mov'e forward
with that. So,
but it is a lot of
work. We're looking at those barriers,
we're looking about whether or not
we can include
because the statute clearly
says you have to be a local
government.
Um We're
looking to see if
maybe we can
include the
um cogs
and see if the cogs can
be a fiscal agent for some of
those since they serve across the
State in different areas.
Um And if they would be willing to
help us to expand those
across the State. So that May
be something that you'll see during the
legislative Session if we can
get to that point.
Um But in
J Jack in juvenile
justice. We are
seeing an increase
in the referrals that are coming
through to the agency.
I think in the past four years,
we've seen about a
97.5%
increase in referrals
that are coming in.
And so that's hugely
concerning for us that doesn't
necessarily mean those all
become active cases
in J Jack, but those are the
referrals. So I'm hoping that
family services can help
with a lot of those,
but we really are starting to dive
down and look at why are those
numbers increasing so
significantly
in addition to that, the commitments
that we've had um are
also going up um by
about 35%.
And so our numbers
at our facility in Albuquerque
at YD DC, we
currently have 67
youth detained in Albuquerque
and we have 37
youth detained at the
John Paul Taylor Center down
in Las Cruces. So
those numbers are
continuing.
We're working with the
staff to make
sure that those individuals
are well prepared
for reentry. Um
I think it's critically important
that, you know, they,
we just, I think Valerie
um attended their graduation
week before last. Um They're
continuing to do,
you know, the GED program or the
graduation, the high school,
if that's what they choose to do.
Um We toured the John Paul
Taylor Center last week
um and saw all of
the curriculum that they have down
there in addition to,
you know, the Welding Program
the building trades program, the
horticulture program,
um so really making
sure that those individuals
are prepared,
but also that they're working with them
on workforce to really
determine, you know, and bring in
programming for them to
be prepared for the job
market when they leave those
facilities. I mean, that
is really what needs to happen.
They need to be prepared
for reentry into
um once
they leave those facilities.
And so those numbers
continue to grow, we're continuing
to look at that and we're expanding,
you know, the programming that we're doing
within those facilities to
meet their needs.
Um
So I think aside from the
continuum and the work that we're
doing there, um
I'll just stand for any questions that
you have on juvenile justice when
we get through this
presentation. But I think I'd like to
go through all of it and then give you
guys opportunity for questions
which I'm sure there will be
plenty. So I'll try to
get through this.
Um I think the last thing I want to
say on juvenile justice is
there has been questions about the
Executive order that was entered
last September.
Um We have
been working with our department,
you know, and law
enforcement on those
individuals that through
the Executive order are
ordered to be detained
if they are,
um if they
commit a crime
and are in possession of a
firearm, so they don't necessarily
have to use the firearm,
but if they're in possession of it
at the time of a crime.
Um Then we are moving
for detainment
and that has resulted
in, I have numbers here. Um,
since September, we've had
100 and 75
youth detained or
recommended for detention
that committed a crime
in possession of a firearm.
Um 54
of those required us
to do an override. So when
we do the scoring,
um you know, if they score
at a certain level, then we
recommend that they be detained.
So of those
175
100 and
30 my math
is bad but roughly
100 and 30 would have been
detained regardless.
But 54 of them, we
did do an override to
request that they be detained
because of the firearm
charge. We are
looking at changing
the, the scoring
system that we have and revising
the ray that that would
be an automatic hold for
those individuals.
Um The other change that we're
making or proposing to
make to the ray is
that individuals who
assault ac
YFD employee, whether it be
their caseworker or juvenile
justice, um That
that would score a 12
as well and 12 is what's
needed to be
detained. But
there are contributing factors
that can subtract from
that number if there are other
things that come into play
for the youth, if there's no prior
offense or just depending
on that, that could be
um deducted from that
score. And so that
doesn't necessarily um
trigger that, that youth
be detained. Um
And so that is something that they're
looking at, it's not
finalized. We're still in
conversations, we
are scheduled to meet with the
courts and we want to have those
conversations. So if any of you would
like to be a part of those,
um you know, we'll extend that
invitation when we're ready to have
those conversations when we figured out
all the changes that we want to
make.
Um
All right.
So,
um, I want to talk
next about our behavioral health
unit. Um, and I
think that there's,
um, maybe not
full understanding that
the behavioral health unit
at CYFD serves
all Children. It's the
behavioral health for kids
across the State. It is
not just for kids that are in State
custody or in the juvenile
justice system, they
set the standards and they set
up those programs for all
kids. And I think we
all know there are not enough
providers to meet the
behavioral health needs across
our State. And so
we've been working, um,
a lot recently with
the MC OS. Um,
I, I think the opportunity
for us to have a single
MC O that do
serve the kids
in State custody is gonna
be huge for us because it
gives us opportunity to have
those conversations about what
those needs
are. Um, and
some of those are really significant
needs that we do not
have in New Mexico when we
continue to send kids out of
State, you know, both
kids in custody and both
private pay are sending
kids out of State to meet their
needs. And so
conversation with
um providers
that are currently not providing
services in New Mexico are
happening to see who
we can bring into the
State to try to set up
additional services.
We're also having conversations
with the Department of Health who
as you know, runs two
facilities, one in Las Vegas
and one here in Albuquerque
at Sequoia um
to meet behavioral health needs
for kids. Um and
really looking how we can expand
the services that they provide
and make sure that they have the staffing
that they need to meet a higher
level of acuity.
Um So those conversations
are ongoing, we're working
to expand those services.
We're working with the MC
O si think there have been lots of changes
that have happened in the last year
about things that they're willing
to look at and consider.
Um I think one of the most significant
conversations that we're having
is really expanding the
different levels of
care that they provide. So right
now, it's either you're, you
know, in an acute facility
and then you come out and
nine times out of 10, you
come out of those facilities
and the step down facility is
our office. Um
and that's something that's hugely
concerning for us. Our
staff is not equipped to
deal with that and it sets
back the progress that those
individuals are making when they're
in that acute facility and
then they come back to an office. And
so they're working with
us on different levels of
care. We have a couple of
current providers that
are interested in providing
that subacute level.
And so it's really just a matter of
conversation that we're having right now
with the MC OS about how
do we increase the payment? Because
it really drops, it's either you're
acute or then you're paid for
this really just low
level and
the um, providers
cannot sustain that at that
low level to do a
subacute
um treatment. Um,
so those conversations are
ongoing um with providers
and hopefully with the
one provider, we can start to,
to change that and
then the others that provide
for the general public, we
follow suit and we'll continue
to build that out across the
State. Um
Behavioral health is
working with juvenile
justice and with
protective services
to really make sure that we
have those
um,
um behavioral health
individuals and their
expertise at the
table with us as we're
talking through the different cases
of placement for kids
and what their needs are and really
making sure that staff
is able to
have that conversation and have
that expertise as
they're really looking for decisions
on placement. So
I'm grateful for the relationship
that they forged with our other
areas across the agency.
Um and they're working really
strongly with them.
So I think then that
will take us to
um
protective services.
And I think that has been the
biggest concern that, you
know, the State, the
media. Um you
us me
have had with
what we do at
CYFD because it is
such a large part of what
we do. We currently
have about 3000
thir 3000,
um 2030
I got not 3000,
about 2030
kids in State
custody. Um,
and that's a large
number for a State
this size. Um,
it's a lot of kids that come into
our custody. We have
about 900.
I can tell you exactly because I have
the number somewhere here. Um,
we have about
maybe I don't have the number.
I think we have about 1000
maybe 1000 16
foster families.
Um, and obviously some of
those take more than one child.
I think when I last checked last
week, we had about 100 and
90 open
beds.
And so I think people ask
the question a lot if we have
open beds, why do we
have kids sleeping in
offices? And I think
the answer for that is that
we need to really work with our
foster families to
make sure that they
are prepared to
take kids that
have higher
needs.
They're not. And we are
working towards that.
But I think some of the training that
we need to do really needs to
prepare those families
to take kids with higher
needs. Um, they'll take
them, they'll disrupt,
we'll put them in another foster
family. They'll disrupt
and after two or three then
they end up in the office because
we have a really hard time finding
placement. And so for
us, one of the things that we're
looking at right now is we're starting up
an enhanced foster
parent program
where we will provide more
intensive training for
families who are willing
to take those kids with higher
needs and do wraparound
services for them. It would
be an increased rate of pay
for them and we would just
do more intensive training
to make sure that they're
trained and then that they
have um
access to
wraparound services and
staffing that can really
provide them,
you know, immediate
discussion or be
available to them immediately
because, you know, it's,
it's a difficult situation
for these foster families when they take
a youth in
and they escalate and they
are not prepared for that
escalation. I mean,
just last week, we had a
situation out of State where a
foster family had taken a youth out
of State and it escalated
there to the point where they called the
department and said, come
and pick up this youth. And so I'm
grateful to Kathy
for Friday night driving a State
vehicle to another State
to pick up a youth and return
them to New Mexico. And so
if we can do a better job
of preparing them
and then being available
to them to walk them through when
that escalation happens.
Um And that's something that we're looking
at right now, but
with respect to those office
stays, um, we
have opened up
a multis service home here
in Albuquerque. Um, that
is currently taking
any office stays that we
have for males
age 12 and
above. So
we've been working and trying to get
this set up. I believe
we started the process
in August of last year.
Um, we found a provider, we
found a location and
then they went through the
licensing process
which um, took
longer than I would have liked,
but I was trying to be
patient and um,
Liz can tell you I was
not. Um,
but it is open
and we have moved four
kids, I believe
four. As of today, we're,
we've moved four.
So there are nine
that are eligible to
go there right now. From our
office days, we're trying
to do it in a manner that
gives them an opportunity
to get there, get
settled in, get acclimated
and not just take all nine
to them on the first day, which
is something I would have loved to have done,
but would not have set them up for
success. And
So we're moving slowly
with those, we
anticipate that by
next Friday a week
from tomorrow, um, we will
have the rest of those individuals
there. I will say,
and we'll knock on wood that
so far. It's been great. The
four that they have, it has
worked. Um, we did have
one who walked away
from the facility, but then,
um, we're working
towards getting them back.
Um, I met with some
of the Guardian and items that showed
up. We did a walkthrough
um and talked with them about the
services that we're providing
there. Um But
we tried to make it as much
of a home environment as
possible. It will hold
12 youth, three
to a room. Yes, it's
a four bedroom. Um
It is the old girls
Reintegration Center
um over
near the Sequoia facility
off of Paner.
Um Ami is the
contractor who's running it for
us. Um They've done
an amazing job of staffing
that up. They've brought in an
educator, a nurse,
a chef. Um
And so are making it
as homey as possible.
It has a great outdoor area
for the youth, which I think we're
gonna try to do some gardening
for them back there.
Um They did work with
both CNM and
a local charter school in
Albuquerque. I don't remember the name
of it. Um to provide
educational services. They've
set up a classroom there.
Um So, you know,
the downside to that is youth
are leaving their communities. So
we have kids from Roswell
or Chavis County or Don Ana
who will be housed there
um while we find more permanent
place in it and working with them
on that. Um And so
some of them will be doing school
virtually. Um They're
working to see if they can
do an agreement with their local
school from where community they're
coming from so that they can
continue that relationship.
Um But they will be providing
um educational opportunities
for them. There are workforce
opportunities. We've worked with the
Department of Workforce Solutions
to do some pre apprentice programs
for those youth. So if any
of them are interested in
um a job
or workforce, um
we have opportunities
for them also to, to
work and so we're
excited about that opportunity.
Um We have said to the
youth and to
their um youth
attorneys, um that
office stays for that
population of males will
no longer be an option.
Um This is technically what
we're considering to be on office
day for, for males
12 and above. We're
in conversation with
a different provider to do
the same type of environment
for females, age
12 and above. Um
And hopefully that will not
take us um as long they're
already licensed as
a for a multis service
home. And so we're
hopeful that that can happen a little
bit quicker. We currently
have 21
kids in office days.
Um I believe
some of those are youth
that are at the receiving center.
So I don't typically refer
to that as an office day because
that's really what that was designed
for. And I just like to see
if any of you haven't been to our
receiving center while
you're in Albuquerque, you really
should come by and see it. We'd
love to have you come and
tour it. Um The staff
there do an amazing job.
I think that the kids
there do thrive. They have
really good staff that work with
them. Um We were
able to secure a
15 passenger
little minibus from
um Department of Homeland Security
that they bought during the fires
to transport people back and forth.
And so we now have that
at the receiving center. Um
They've been taking kids to the
zoo to the movies.
Um They took them on Saturday, there
was an incredible event
that um families first put
on for fishing
um at Tingley Beach.
And so they loaded them up in
the little bus and took them fishing
on Saturday. Um
So they are getting them out.
They are, you know, really
gonna be doing a lot of that during the summer
and recreating with them.
Um But would love to
invite you guys to come by and see
that facility.
So I think that will
address the issue that we've
had ongoing for
quite some time with office
days. Um You know, it
is really gonna take the work
of the Guardian
Lites and us to
really be on
board that this is where kids
will be as opposed to an
office because they are so
accustomed to being in the office.
And many of them, even though
we find them placement,
they are so comfortable with our
staff that they come back
and they disrupt and they just say
we like it here. We want to be here, we
want to be with staff and that is
such a hardship on our staff
that are expected to then continue
to do their regular jobs.
And so we're standing
firm when one of them showed back
up at the Albuquerque office after
he walked from
um the facility back to the
office, we said under no
circumstances, are you to
allow him to stay in the office tonight?
Because as soon as we open that door for
them to come back, we will
not be able to shut that again.
Um And fortunately,
we, his guardian at light was
one that had toured the facility
and was really um
united with us and saying,
you know, you need to go back over
there and this is really going to
be the same as
the office is just a better
environment with more services
for them. And so,
um there's,
that's kind of where we are. I
know last year I committed
to ending office stays and
this is where we are right now.
But I believe that as
we build out those foster
families and especially those
enhanced foster families that
are able to take um
individuals, you know, that have
different needs and higher needs.
Um We will be able to start to
transition some of those individuals
from this community
location to
um individual foster
homes. But my hope is
that we can do that transition
there at a
location where they feel
most comfortable so that
we're not taking them and putting them in
somebody's house and they're not
comfortable and then they're coming back and then we're
trying somebody else's house.
I'm hoping that we can transition
them there where they can actually start
to build a relationship with a
potential foster family.
You know, maybe it's a dinner or twice
a week for a couple of weeks or
maybe it's a couple of outings
until they can start to feel more
comfortable and then we can
slowly transition
them into a house where we
can really set them up to be
successful in those environments.
And so that is the
hope for that. Um
And that's where we, where we are
there. So
I think I mentioned, you know, the work
that we're doing with recruiting foster
families, we have somebody on
contract um to
do kind of a spider
web model that they
created um
in Oregon, um
that has proved to be successful
there. It's gotten off to
a slow start as we kind
of redid our
process
internally. Um
And, you know, we have struggled
a little bit with finding,
um, providers to do some of
the home studies. Um,
and so that's been a little bit
challenging for us, but
our, um, unit
is doing two large
events every
month in designated
areas really based on the
need. Um, and they're looking
at that data, um, to see
where they do these large
events and then they're continuing
just to do the smaller events
and the regular recruiting that they're
doing. And so,
um, you know,
I think I'm open to
ideas that people have on
how we can partner to really
bring in more foster
families. I know that it's an
issue across the
nation and it was a topic of
discussion at the forum that I
was at week before last with Annie
Casey where a lot of them
are really struggling and some of the
long time foster families that we've
had are really
now starting to exit and
some of them have been amazing, I will
say at the event on
Saturday, I met two families
that have been doing it for a really long time. I
think one had seven kids with them,
one had nine and they
were all, you know, in their little
yellow t-shirts and holding
hands and, um, you
know, just working
their way through the fishing day.
But, um,
you know, I think
just the commitment that
they have to doing the work that
they do um is
so amazing. And so,
you know, as an agency, we're
really looking to see how can
we better support the foster
families that we currently
have and make sure that we're
providing them the resources
that they need and the training that
they need. Um,
you know, we're looking
at
um a contract with
foster colledge to really
make sure that they can get access
and get online. Um
and then just different things
that we can do to support the
foster families. And
so, um there's a lot of
work that's still going on right there,
but we're continuing and I think we
have recruited 16
new foster families in the last
16 days. So I'm super
excited about that,
but we're also losing at
that about that same
rate. Um And
so that's really concerning
to me. Um And you know,
maybe some of them are just completely
done and I respect
that, but maybe some of them
aren't getting the support that they need
from us and I want to make sure that
we're changing that. So
um we're looking at that as
well.
Um
Did it cover
everything?
All right.
Um So yes, I
forgot. So I think
I did mention I want um
for um Deputy Secretary
Sandoval to just
kind of give a brief
overview of
what does it look like for
kids to actually come into
State custody? Right?
I know that, you know, there was
conversation
about whether that
happens due to
just poverty
and I just want to be clear
that CYFD
does not have the
authority to remove a child from
a home that is
never our decision.
We can make a recommendation
if we have concern,
but we do not have the
authority to go into somebody's
house and take their child
that is determined by law
enforcement or by the
courts and then they will
call us in and we will go and we'll
meet law enforcement there and we'll
do that removal. We'll
file for a 72 hour
hold and then we'll do
our assessment to determine if
in fact, there is abuse
or neglect that is of concern
to us and then we'll
mov'e forward through the judicial
process to get that hold
and get them into custody.
But, um,
again, we don't have the authority
to just go in and
take a child out of a
home. So val if you want
to just kind of walk them through what that
process looks
like.
>> Uh Thank you, Secretary,
um Mr. Chair and Members of
the Committee. Thank you so much.
Um I'm just gonna give a brief
overview of
how um a call
comes into our statewide central
intake and an investigation
is conducted.
Um Our statewide
central intake often referred
to as Sky again. We love
our acronym. So if you
um hear, please call
Sky, that's, that's what we're
discussing. Um Sky
receives anywhere,
approximately
45,000
calls every
year
and we never say no
to a call even if we
know that we wouldn't
have jurisdiction or
it wouldn't meet criteria. We
still take that report.
We take every single report
and call that comes into Sky
and every single report that
is received is
crossed to the appropriate
law enforcement, whether that would be
State police,
sheriffs or the local
jurisdiction. So every single
report is crossed.
Now, if it does
meet criteria,
it is screened in and
it's given a priority.
We have three different priorities,
an emergency where
CYFD staff has up to three
hours to respond.
A priority one,
which means we have 24
hours to respond or a
priority two,
which gives us up to five
days to respond.
Um So those
calls come into sky.
If it is a screened in
report, then it is
sent to the appropriate county
of the jurisdiction and
that county investigators
then respond. Now, what they
do is they have that, that
window of time that I just
discussed to make
face to face contact with
the victim. So if
that's in the home or
wherever, wherever
that child is located, the hospital,
wherever that child is located, we
have that time to make face to face
contact.
Now when we go and
do conduct the investigation,
right? We have a
safety tool
that we use
to assess the entire
situation and it's
not a checkbox tool. It's
a very comprehensive
tool where every single
danger indicator
has a specific
definition. And if
any of you would like to talk with me
about that at a later time, I'd be
happy to sit with you
and we can go through. Um
and you could read every
single safety threat or danger
indicator that we look
for. Now, if
there is even one danger
indicator, then that
child is unsafe
and we would
remove the child.
But of course, as Secretary
says, we cannot
remove, we have to either
request it from law enforcement
or file with the courts.
So we can never just go
in and remove a child.
Um, after that investigation
is done depending on
what occurs. We would
either receive a 72
hour hold from law enforcement
or we could conduct
a safety plan with the family
member. Um,
it all, it all depends
if we don't feel like,
um, there is any safety
threats and we're like this family just
really needs services.
The investigation doesn't stop
just then we help that
family and refer them to
services or do a warm
handoff And a warm handoff
would be our staff
going to the provider
with the family and
saying we're connecting
you directly. We're not just giving you a
piece of paper and saying,
here's a number, please
call at your convenience.
We're helping that family
connect.
Um If we do receive
a 72 hour
hold, then um
we have to find
placement for that child and
our first
um our first
priority is als is always
to place with kin or
family. And New Mexico
does a fabulous job of
placing the family. We are
above 50%
of our kids are placed in a
kinship family setting.
Um which is amazing
if we are unable to
safely place with family or
kin, then we, we
look for one of our amazing
resource, foster parents
um to try to place that
child in
um in a resource or, or
foster home.
Um And if we obtain
custody and, and we
file for custody after that
72 hour hold, then
the casework which
is the meat of the case
begins, right?
We need to assess the family,
say, what services do they need? What
do the parents need to do
if reunification
um is the way we go
and if we know that we can safely
not reunify the child
with the parents, then we,
we change the permanency
plan um
to proceed
with adoption at that
time. And that is a lengthy pro
process, it's not an overnight
process. Um And our
goal in protective services
is to speed up the
um permanency plan for these
kids. So they're not in foster care so
long.
Um but it's not
just this whole casework
and receiving these kids
on a hold is not just
CYFD, it involves
law enforcement, it involves the
courts, it involves family
and kinship, it
involves um resource
foster parents. It involves
hospital carts,
doctors,
um you know,
providers that help
um conduct visits between
parents and kids are,
are amazing staff
who um conduct
visits and help transport our
kids um to
and from appointments or to and from
visits. So there's
a wide variety
um that happens within
a case and, and I'm
happy to go in further
detail with you at a later
time. I invite you
to our county offices in
your respective counties.
Um I'm happy to meet you
there and you could do
um a day in the life of with
us um or
um visit with our staff
and I'm happy to meet you down there
to do that.
>> Mm.
So, I think, you know,
that,
I think that kind of gives an overview,
a quick overview of
kind of, you know what that looks
like for kids that are coming into
State custody. You know,
as she said, we do have
some kids that have been in State
custody for an
incredibly long period
of time. And so we're
really working on what does
that look like? And you know,
talking with staff about when
a child comes into custody,
um we should generally be
planning to track,
there should be a plan for
reunification that we're currently
working, but there are also
at the same time, should be a
plan
for permanency
outside of reunification
if that plan fails
to fall through because I think currently
we work on reunification.
Um And
sometimes that's just
not working.
Um And sometimes,
you know, that gets prolonged
because we go to court on a case
and they want us to give more time to the
family to try to figure that
out. Um And so
that's something that we're really trying to
find that balance. Like what
is that time frame?
Because really it should be the best
interests of the child.
And I don't think being in foster
care for 10 years is
in the best interest of any
child. And so
we're really looking at
how do we um
come to a hard and fast
spot where we're like, we're gonna
give the family every
opportunity and work with them
to try to work towards reunification
if it's appropriate.
But we're also gonna come to a
point at some point where we're gonna
say we've done everything that we possibly
could towards reunification and we're
going to mov'e towards adoption
so that that child has the best
opportunity for placement,
you know, at the youngest
possible opportunity.
Um And so
that is something that we're scheduled
to, you know, talk with the courts about.
Um we have a meeting scheduled
with the chief justice
and a couple of the other justices
at the court to really talk about
what should that look like
across the State
so that we have a uniform
practice and it's not,
you know, three years in
this county and 18
months in this county and,
you know, workers really aren't sure of
what that looks like. And so
that is something that we're working on
internally to make sure
that we're getting to that
point. We currently
have 366
kids that are freed for
adoption. And so really
starting to work those cases
on how do we get those
to permanency and what do we
need to do um to
get there. Um, you know, we
had 100 and 98
Children that were adopted out
in 2023.
And currently this year we've had
51 adopted out.
And so, you know, that
does happen simultaneously.
You know, we have kids in placement, we have
kids that are being freed for
adoption and caseworkers are working
those cases as well.
Um So I think that leads
me to really the last thing that I
want to talk about and that
is our Kevin
um litigation,
um because
that's, you know, first and
foremost on the mind of so
many individuals and what I say
to staff all the time is,
you know, we're not making changes
in the department. We're not
changing our structure,
we're not hiring people or changing
our training because of a
lawsuit. We're doing it
because it's the right thing
to do for kids. It
just happens to coincide at
the time that we're also
dealing with requirements of a
lawsuit that are very similar.
And so, you know,
they are changes that
definitely need to be made.
I mean, they're things that we really need
to look at. Um, and I
think, um,
we, they did
invoke their right for arbitration.
They notified us about
just in a week and a half ago, two weeks
ago, um, that they were
gonna go back to arbitration.
Um They don't feel like we're
making the progress that we need to
fast enough. Um,
but as I said, structural
change doesn't happen fast
if we were just doing this fast
and just worried about meeting those
numbers. Um,
you know, we wouldn't be doing all the
work that we're doing to make sure that
we're setting that strong
foundation. And for me, my
goal is when I leave in 2.5
years that the
foundation of
the department is so
strong that
the work that the good work
just can continue. Um,
and I think that's really the efforts
that we're making. And I think a lot of
people ask, well, is the department too
big to do that. And
I don't think it's too big. I
think all of the programs
that we provide for serv,
uh, for families are
so needed and they work
together. Our behavioral health
unit works every day
with our Protective Services, with
our juvenile justice
and with our family
services and there was conversation
as they were setting up health care
authority, you know, do we
mov'e behavioral health out
at this point
that would cripple some of the
work that we do on a daily
basis and those staffing
that they do and the ability to pick
up that phone and call and say, here's an
issue that I'm dealing with, with this child
and here are the behaviors and
have that person right there internally
to be able to do that.
And so I don't think it's too
big. I think it was
improperly structured
and I don't think it worked
well. And so that's really
what our focus over the last year has
been, is like, what is the
structure that needs
to be set for it to
work well together?
And now that we've determined that
structure now, it's like building
that back up to say, OK, here
are the programs and here's
how we're gonna build that
and we're doing it methodically,
we're doing it slowly and
we're doing it so that it can be
sustained. Um
And so I feel very comfortable
going to arbitration.
Um, you know, to show
some of the work that is
happening and how that
looks. Um, but
there's three things that they're
really gonna focus on during the
arbitration this round
and then we'll deal with the rest
of the issues in
litigation, I guess at a later
time. But the three things
that they are looking to talk
about right now are the
hiring, right? The
case count
for our permanency
placement and investigators,
um,
the well, child
checks. So
there's a requirement in Kevin
that every child that comes into
State custody custody
has a well, child check within
30 days. We,
when we started a year ago
looking at that measure,
we were at
somewhere in the high
20% that kids
were getting that well, child check within
30 days. Um
Right now we're at
about 50%
maybe 55% of
those kids are getting their visit within
30 days. That's
incredibly hard to do
right now with the lack of providers
that we have, especially in some rural
areas. I mean, I don't know
about you but I try to call and make an
appointment and they're like, well, we can see
you, you know, in
February of next
year and so calling
and demanding that a child get seen
within 30 days.
And for some of us it's even
less because as val
pointed out, you know, we have a
72 hour hold,
but that first moment
that they come into custody starts
that clock ticking. But for
some of them, we don't get a hearing
until maybe 10 days later
to say yes, they're going to remain in
custody. And now we've
lost 10 days of that
30 days to try to get them
in to see a primary
physician to do that. Well, child
check. And so we're
working really hard with the MC
OS. They're going to be assigning care
coordinators that will be located
in some of our offices to help
us navigate and get those set
up. We're trying to do
contracts with,
um,
what are they called physicians,
no nurse practitioners
to be able to see if they can
see some of those kids.
And so, but we are moving
the needle on that requirement.
Um We are just nowhere near
100% nor will
we ever be at 100%.
Um There sometimes are kids that
come into custody that run
or for whatever
other reasons. Um,
one of the barriers was
if a child came into custody
today and they had a well child
check in April,
their insurance wouldn't cover
another well, child check.
And so that was one of the barriers
that we've been able to remove. The
MC OS are now waiving
that and any child that comes into
State custody, regardless of
when their last, well, child check
was, um, that will
still be another covered expense
so the providers can bill for
that. Um,
so we're working towards that,
but that will be something that comes
up during mediation that we
will or arbitration that we'll be
discussing. Um,
the other is the caseloads and I
don't have things to pass out.
It's like a really large
document, but I think
you'll be able to see it and I'm
happy to share it if we
need to. But, you know,
one of the things is our case
counts and for
investigators, um, the
anticipated caseload
is 12
cases and that's not
investigations.
Sorry, I thought I had these in
order.
Um, so
for investigators,
the ideal
caseload is
12. What we're
doing is we're looking at that and
we're using that as a starting point,
but we also have to take into consideration
workloads. Some of the cases
are much harder than others.
And so it's hard to say
you can all have 12 when some
of the cases that they have May be
really high-level
cases. Um,
but they gave us two
different metrics that we're supposed
to meet and it is
getting all of our caseworkers
to 200% of
that was the first
goal and then obviously
100% of that.
So right now where
we stand today, um,
this chart shows
us for investigations, the
green is where we're meeting
that 200%.
So we are making progress
for some of our casework. We've
been really trying to do
hiring over the last
year. Um, you know, to
make sure that we're meeting that, I
think our field
work vacancy rate
right now is about
21.5%.
Um, it was much higher
a year ago. We've been, you know,
working on that. But
one thing that people need to
understand is just hiring
doesn't equate lower cases
because our staff,
we don't or we
shouldn't. And I can say we
don't because I think we might,
um, our staff
should not have a full
caseload until
they've been on the job for six
months. Right. It should be
graduated and we're really
working on what that looks
like. Um, but
as you can see to meet the
100% standard, this
is kind of where we are.
Um, so in order for us
to get there, we need to
hire, um, 58
more caseworkers,
more investigators. And that's
just based on the current number
of investigations that we
have, you know, divided
by 12 for each
caseworker. It's
even math that I could figure out.
But, um, so 58
more, um,
investigators,
um, and that is going to cost
the department about
$7 million 6.9
million dollars to get those
additional positions
filled.
Um,
and so as I said, you
know, we'll, we'll work on getting
those filled, but then
we're going to make sure that they're not
just overloaded with cases the
day they walk in because our
retention rate has
actually improved.
Um, and so we
want to make sure that we're continuing
to do that, that we're hiring,
we're training and we're retaining
those are really important to us.
And so, um, we'll be
looking to, um, ask
for additional funding for those
positions, um, in the next
legislative Session.
Um, and then with
respect to
placement
we're doing, um, I
think really good work there.
This is the chart that shows the
counties where we're currently meeting
the 200%
of cases for
placement. Um,
and this is what it looks like
for the 100%.
So we've still got some work
to do there. Um,
we need an additional
seven people to be
able to get to the
100% and distribute
those cases. Um And
that includes no supervisors
carrying case caseload.
Um So to
hire seven additional
people, um for placement
is about $800,000
when you look at um, salaries
plus benefits and
supervisors and office
space.
Um In
permanency,
um we need an additional
28 staff to
reach the levels there
and that's $2.8
million and this is where we are
right now. This is at the
200%
and this is at 100%.
So we do have some
counties that really are
meeting all of their
levels, albeit they are small
counties, but, you know,
they're in compliance
with respect to what we're
required to meet for Kevin
S. Um
And so, you know, I feel
like we can show the
requirements in Kevin
S were not that we would get to
that standard, but that we would
make good faith efforts
towards doing that.
Um And if you look at
where we were a year ago
versus where we are now
I think we can honestly say we've
made a lot of effort
um and a lot of progress
in meeting those
numbers. Um
you know, I guess it's up to the
arbitrator to determine if it's
enough effort.
Um Or if we need to go in a
different direction. And
Justin, what's the third thing that
we're talking about
>> in
arbitration,
health
visits,
uh
>> resource parents? Thank
you. Um The last
thing that we're having on the table for
arbitration is um the recruitment
of foster parents. And so,
um you know, I think
that the department
is working, as I said, 16 new
ones in the last 30 days, which I
think is huge. Um
And so we're really
concentrating on trying
to um have
those large events in two different
counties every month
and um really
increase those efforts to get
to those numbers. And so
those are the three things that they'll be
discussing. I think there's conversation,
I think there's actually tomorrow
conversation with Kevin Ss.
So I just kind of wanted to give you an
idea of where we are and let
you know that we will be going back to
arbitration. Um
But there's nothing
in those agreements that
we agreed to that
we disagree with as a department.
We really feel like those are all
measures that need to be
met. It's just
we're trying to kind of chunk
those out and do what we
can with them as
opposed to, I think
for the last year, we
tried to do everything
at once
and I felt like we accomplished
nothing at all.
And so we've taken a different
approach to really try to just
kind of chunk that out and measure it
and, and try to reach
those deliverables on a
smaller scale but
consistently.
Um And so I just
wanted to put that out there.
So with that, I'll go ahead
and stand for questions.
Um And hopefully, we have enough
time to um
get in all the questions that you
have. >> Well,
thank you very much madam
Secretary and, and all
of your staff.
Um and we
will have the Kevin S presentation
tomorrow morning by the
attorneys representing
it. Um
Everybody
should have a chance to ask questions.
So we're going to start with
Representative Vincent
and just work our way around
here and we
have enough time that we can give you
an extra minute. We're going to give
you four minutes,
four minutes,
but don't get
crazy.
Are you getting crazy
already?
>> I'm sorry, Mr.
Chair. I, I have a question.
Did these presenters
provide a handout?
So I
have a real problem,
not just with these presenters,
but anybody who takes this
committee's time to
tell an in-depth
integrate story
without willing to put it
down in writing.
And I would respectfully
ask our leadership
to not allow people
time who cannot put things
down in writing.
>> Well, yeah, I mean,
we would definitely prefer to have
things in writing. So possibly
you could provide,
for example, those charts at the
end to hold them up is
kind of useless. >> The
presenters, the numbers
that we have been given to them,
the org chart that you're
trying to tell a story that it's
complex and
that if you start the cog
here takes a while for
it to turn here and
yet nothing's in
writing to show
that.
>> So it, it would be good if
you, if you could provide us with,
with those data, that would be
very helpful.
And, and, and I would, I
would say
maybe, I mean,
I think a number of Members have questions
on Cara.
And could you possibly
do a presentation on
where the that particular
issue stands? Now? That was one of
the, the
most
heavily discussed
issues during the Session.
And, and I think a lot of Members
of this Committee would like to hear that
maybe before we go to
questions. >> Yes,
absolutely. So,
um as you all know, we
requested that Kra live within
CYFD during the last
legislative Session, um
It will be residing within our
family services division,
but we did not receive any
funding during the last legislative
Session to implement the K
A program. I believe funding
went to HSD for that
implementation.
Um And so we have
moved forward with setting
up navigators
within our department that
will still continue to
work out of our local
offices. Um They'll work
with the MC Os and the
hospitals to really
do follow up
implementation on
Cara services. Um
We're using TANF
funds at this point in
time to fund those
FTEs. Um And
I believe Kathy can correct me,
but I believe that we received
approval of those
funds for TANF
um for a period of two
years. And so,
um, you know, we'll be looking
to sustain those
or if it is still the
desire um of the
legislative body that, that not
that program not reside within
CYFD. Um
You know, then I guess that conversation
after the two year period,
um can be had about
where that needs to be, but
we are moving forward with the care
a manager. Um, those interviews
have taken place.
Um And they will be
overseeing all of the
navigators. Those
navigators will be working
very closely with the
navigators at the MC
Os. Um And they are
going to, as I mentioned
earlier, locate
some of their navigators in our
offices with our staff to help
with the well, child checks.
We're working with the
hospitals to determine
that plan of care
needs to look like.
Um, there has been
a lot of controversy over
the plan of care where
an individual can
just elect
to get
information about snap
benefits or TANF
benefits. And that's considered a plan
of care. So that is changing
considerably where the plan
of care will be, that
there has to be a
plan to,
um,
specific
to the situation
that is requiring that.
So, you know, whether that's
um drug counseling
or rehabilitation
services or
you know, some significant
plan that that is what
that plan of care will
entail. Um We
did um request from the
MC OS that the
hospitals
or
health care providers
are able to now bill
for that plan of care.
So for putting that plan of
care, um in action,
I think a lot of the providers
um were not taking
the seriousness of it and we're
just kind of doing it quickly
as somebody was leaving the
hospital. Now, it is
a paid service for them
and it is a requirement
that they go through a
more extensive form
and work with the
individuals.
And so that is
working Medicaid,
>> Medicaid is going to pay them
for that. >> They
will, that is
effective July 1st, that that
billing code should be
up and running for them to be able
to get paid for
that.
Let's see, they also,
um, so we're working with the
MC Os and the Hospital
Association, they're putting
together um a new
training that is being gonna
be rolled out to the hospital
associations um
for training. But
I think they've been really working
on building those relationships
with the hospitals.
And KA is one
of the issues that we have
submitted a
request to the governor's
office that we will be carrying
additional Legislation
in this next legislative
Session to really work
on the definition and what that
looks like as you all know, it's
a voluntary program.
Um Nobody is required
to take that
um to
do that plan of care and there's
really no follow up that we
can enforce because it's
a voluntary program. So
we're trying to
change what that looks like.
We're actually also
looking at, you know,
adding the definition
of fentaNYL um
as abuse or neglect.
So that would then take that
out of if
there's a child that's
exposed to fentaNYL,
um that would not be
included in the kera
that would actually be
um abuse and would
fall under an investigation
immediately. And so there are things
that we're looking at. We are looking
to run Legislation this next
year.
>> Yeah,
let's go to
Representative Vincent. We'll
give everybody four minutes
and we'll just mov'e
gradually in a
building crescendo of
concern and
questioning all the way to the
end
or we May stop halfway. We
May come here,
we'll, we'll conduct this
as we as we see fit. Go
ahead. Representative,
>> thank you Mr. Chair and thank you
madam Chair for that extra minute.
I appreciate that.
Um And
I deputy Secretary, I I
heard you uh
kind of mention and explain
the the screening in and
screening
out
and I heard that twice in
testimony or the presenters
yesterday.
And um
how do you screen out?
How do you make the decision to screen
someone out?
>> Mr. Chair, Representative
Vincent. Thank you for that question.
Um We do have
a screening tool,
evidence-based screening tool
at our statewide central
intake. Um
CYFD only has
jurisdiction over
parents gardens and
custodians. So for
an example, if
a coach was
abusing a child,
cyfd doesn't have
jurisdiction over that coach.
We would complete the
report and take that
report, it would be screened out,
but we would cross report that
report to law enforcement.
That's, that's just one
example. >> Thank you,
Mr. Chair and thank you Deputy
Secretary. So I
uh I do
appreciate that
and I'm gonna make
a commitment because I've,
I've listened to this
Committee for two years
now and I really
believe that this Committee has a
commitment to making you
better and
I hear your side and
then I hear presenter, the other
presenter side and
I'm trying to find out how to
balance it all out and, and
we want you to be successful
because our kids deserve
better. And
you know, I, I did some research
last night and I found a video
uh that Krqe
did a couple of years
ago and it was a
deputy
and he was so confused
of why,
um Cyfd
didn't want to take possession of
this kid. So
yesterday we were talking about
processes
and I think some, the
process is
the way you process something
in your process is and
I'm in the field, I
might not be processing it the
same way and we need to
have, we need to
streamline it to where
everybody is on the
same page.
And,
um,
that's why
if
and win and I'm not, I'm
not being, uh against
you. I want, I want to be
for you. But the
next time that,
uh, the ombudsman
comes up, I think
that would help you a lot
just to have some oversight
and, uh, fix
a lot of these
processes
because
when we were talking yesterday about
prevention
and the money that's put into
prevention, it's
hard to get a program started.
I get that and you
have CYFD
is so big and that's
why I want, I'm gonna make this
commitment to you right now.
I want to walk in
your shoes and
then I want to walk in your shoes and
I'm gonna come down and I'm gonna walk
in everybody's shoes until I figure it
out. Thank
you, Mr.
Chair
>> Representative >> Block.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
guess I start the clock.
I, I like to go all the way to the
four minutes. So Mr.
Chair. I just
want to, first of all say thank you for
the improvements that you've been making.
You know, you don't get. Thank you
enough. And I,
I'm usually one to ask you questions
like, why aren't you doing this or why aren't you doing that?
But I really appreciate some of the
things you guys are doing, such as,
uh, families, first
tingle things like,
uh, not allowing kids to come back to
stay in the office after you've let
them out. Things like that. That are true
improvements that I have seen so far.
So I wanna just give you guys
kudos for that and
then, uh, Mr. Chair, I just had a
few questions. Uh,
we've heard a few things
from different people about
certain situations
and with these
improvements that you've been making over
this last year
or so that I've been able to
speak with you,
do you think that
today
the outcomes are better
than they were in the
past
in any tangible way that
we can see because I don't, I don't have a
presentation in front of me,
but do we have any
tangible
results as
to the changes that we have
made, Mr.
Chair?
>> Um, madam,
Vice Chair, Representative
Block. Um, that's
a really hard question
to answer because
I'm really hard on myself and I
even said to them
earlier, you know, it's hard to
come before the Committee and
talk about things that we've done over
the year because I
like immediate
tangible change
and it has really been a
slow process. I mean, it's
really digging deep and
looking and I can honestly
say every time we dig,
we find something
horrible. I mean,
you know, I it's
true. I mean, there's a lot,
um, that needs to be changed in the
department and not just in the
programmatic work that we
do, but just in the
structure in the policies,
in the A SD
department and our finances and
our contracts, all of
that really feeds
into what we do in
policy. Um, and
it's a lot of change that we've
made there. So we're not really
seeing those results so
much.
Um
But I think yes,
and I think, you know, the new
multi service
center that we started for kids in
office days is a huge win
for the department, right?
Not just for kids will have
somewhere to stay, but
somewhere that really offers
them opportunity.
You know, we were adamant with the
vendor that has to provide
education, it has to provide,
you know, job opportunities,
we have to teach them
um financial literacy.
Like there's all these things that
we have to do to make sure
that we're um you
know, getting them prepared. So I
think that's a huge win for
us. Um I think the
hiring um for the
staff is really
huge. Um Right.
But I think if you talk to any
single staff member, they still
feel overwhelmed.
Right? And so that's something we're really
trying to work at because on one of the
charts that I showed, we're almost at
compliance with how many
workers we need. But
I can guarantee you if you talked with
any one of them, they
still feel like it's too much
work, right? And so
that's why I say we're working at
workload, not just
work numbers, right? What are
those cases really look like?
And so I think
the hiring is a huge win. I
don't think we're anywhere nearly
far enough on what we need
to do um
with respect to the training of
those individuals, we've had some
real hurdles with
that. Um, you
know, we're talking,
um, I believe Alaska
has done, um,
a Child welfare Academy
and it's something that I'm really interested in
doing here. And earlier
I was approached by someone and they were
wanting to talk to us about training and
I said, you know, exactly that
I want to partner with one of the
universities to do an
academy similar to the,
like the law enforcement academy. They
go and they have really
intensive training.
Um One of the other things that I
heard was that sounded
exciting to me is some of the
states are using
virtual reality for training
where they can actually, you
know, do the headset and
go in and do training.
Um and it gives them different
scenarios. It really works on
personal bias and
you know, different opportunities
there. And maybe that
>> thank you madam Chair. Was that four
minutes? I feel like that was quicker than
>> four. I'm
today.
And I just want to say because I really
feel like it's important to give credit
where credit is due. The
tingle event was not ac
YFD event. We
went, we participated,
but it was actually put on my
family first and I think Marilyn is
here. And I just want to say thank
you to Marilyn for the work that
she does. >> So thank
you, Mr. Chair. Shout. That
was my bill >> a whole bunch of
times.
>> That was representative Lords Bill
just to get on the record. >> So
anyway, I just want to say that,
you know, but it was,
>> it's good to see some improvements and
I appreciate it. And I think that it's
just important to talk about
these issues. I had a bunch of other questions,
but I'm sure I could talk to you
later. So
those handouts that you
had with the maps, I would just love to
see those. I try to take pictures with
my, >> I'll be happy to provide
those. Um So
yes, >> thank you. >> And we were
trying to get handouts prepared yesterday
when I was up in Farmington for a task
force and we got back late last night.
So I apologize for
that.
>> Thank you, Chair and, and thank
you presenters. I, I want
to also clarify that I
this is not
a for and against
Cydfd. We have
to be a team
for the Children of New
Mexico and there's
no way we're going to reach it
unless we are a team.
So just understand that
these, I have a
dozen questions
for you. And I'm gonna, and
you're not gonna answer them all
today, but I'm gonna give
them to you so that you can come back
to me later and answer them. And I'm
sure some of my brilliant colleagues
might uh might get
some of them. One is the
process I want to see
what is the written process
of whether or not something is
escalated, you know,
somebody doesn't have a co you go
into, you go into a home, they don't
have food. What is the
process? Do you give them a short
term food bank?
Do you give them a long term
income support
before you take
the Children out of the house? What's
the written process?
What's the workforce
safety process?
Not just a manager
saying, hey, if
you feel unsafe, you can leave
but have we written
down in CYFD
processes that
our staff
feels, their
feeling of safety
comes first to us
and if they do not feel
safe, they have the right
to be able to try to provide services
in another way. I like
that you mentioned, uh I do, I
have been hearing uh
issues
the MC OS
and so do you want,
I'd like to know, May maybe
not publicly. Um
Do you want one MC
O? Is that easier to have one
MC O to handle all
State custody Children?
Well, I know that Presbyterian I think is
the only one with the facilities,
juvenile mental health facilities.
So that would be a more logical
choice. Is that something
you guys want?
Um I don't understand
this. I know you didn't create this
but they're using your numbers.
It's telling me in protective
services, personnel,
appropriations and filled
FTEs are way down
by the hundreds.
Um You, you
only spent $100
of, of workforce money
last year, you reverted
10 million from this year,
you reverted 33 million
from this year. And then
yet it says in
February, your caseloads were
down to 10. And I'm
like, wow, if you can tell
me how you did that, I know
50 providers who want to
learn that magic trick.
So I don't like
numbers. I can't believe
in and I want to know what they
are. Um, what are the
barriers that you did
mov'e? And what are the ones
that you want to remove?
And what were the outcomes of
that? I, I thought that was
wonderful. Um
Cyfd, can we
get a contract to UN M
child abuse response?
Cart, we got to the,
the
pediatrician
um presented yesterday
and they provide services
for you, but you don't have a contract
with them. So they don't, they don't have a
way to budget to help
you and, and they are a
great community partner I think
could help you. Um
I'd love to have a handout
on this uh
futuristic
powerpoint. I'm gonna get from
you of what
exactly are the family
resources? What are
they, what are they providing in the
resource source centers?
Uh Would you support
change of the anti
donation clause? It sounds
like you would when I got that
pro but I would like to know
what kind of funding can
we provide or policy
we can provide
that will increase
kinship support,
foster families.
It sounds to me, I, I do
not like to hear that nine
kids are in one foster home.
That is not a positive
thing to me, even though
it was presented
positively, it
is not a positive
thing as a mother
and of a large family. I
know what that means.
So I
know that we're increasing
kinship foster families,
but then we need to give
them more support, not
less support in the way it's
written right now, we're giving them
less when they're kin.
So how can we as
legislators
change that
policy and then make
sure that it's adequately
funded? And
thank you very much. They
might under four, pick
one and answer
>> to
I have
an, so I'm gonna
try to address several of those
because I think they're important. Um
The first one that I can address is
the MC O and I think, yes,
going to one MC O
for us, I think is a positive
thing because it enables
us to have one place to
go when we have issues
that we need to implement change. And I have
to just convince one to
do it and then the others
hopefully follow suit with the
individuals that they're serving,
you know, in a different capacity for
Children across the State.
So I think that is a
positive for us and we've
seen really good response thus
far with Presbyterian, they're at
the table with us right now.
You know, we have issues with some of the kids
that we have out of State.
They're putting somebody on that team
with us to actually go out of State
and visit those kids. So
thus far, I think it's a
positive um
with respect to the anti
donation. Yes, I would love
to look at that and I think a
lot of times we in our own
minds, create barriers of what
anti donation consists of.
And I'm pretty sure
99% of the time
there's workarounds of that.
But I agree with you. I think that
we have families that are doing kinship
or grandparents, raising grandchildren
that we are not able
to assist. And even with
our family resources, if
somebody, you know, can't
pay their rent or buy groceries
because they car is broken
down and they can't get to work,
you know, isn't it easier for
us to help them get that
fixed and take those kids into
custody and put them in a foster
family while they get it
together. And so I
think there are so many
ways um
but also some private
partners that we are working with
and exploring private
funding to be able to do some
of those. So yes, I'd be interested in
talking about that.
Um And again, with
kinship support, I think we need to
do more. Um
Let's see, um with
respect to UN M child
abuse response with the cart.
Um I know that they provide a lot of
services. Um We'll look
into contracts. I think we're looking
at contracts as a whole. Right
now, we send a
lot of money out the door on
contracts and
I've asked this constantly,
are they the right contracts
is the work that these
entities are doing still the
right work? And is it providing
really good results for our
kids? Or is it just something
that we've been doing for 10 years
and we just sign it every year and the
money goes out. So, we're
taking a close look at that. We're
actually contracting with a
couple of people to come
in and go out and
visit those contractors
and really look at the deliverables.
And that's something that, you know, this
year when they give me the contracts to
resign, there's a sheet on the front
that talks about how many kids
did, did we or you know, what
were the outcomes of that? And
should we continue this contract?
And so I'm sure there will be
some that the answer will be
no. Um And then we'll
be able to redirect
that funding to some of those
that where we really do see positive
outcomes or can provide
services that are really needed.
Um
ok, I will get
back to you on the other with
respect to the written policies
that we have. All right.
Thank
you.
>> Thank
you.
Do you wanna do you wanna put
your four minutes up for a
bit?
The
ok. Representative Jones, you
and Harri, who's this for
a minute? You the next in line?
>> Thank you so much, Mr.
Chair and thank you all for
presenting. I have to say too
that I'm pleased with some of
the what I see are changes I
want, I want to focus
in on Kara that, that
is what I'm
familiar with having spent a
lot of years taking care of
Children as a registered nurse and
especially neonates in,
in IC U.
Um, weaning them off of drugs
when they were born addicted
and that sort of thing. So, I kind
of understand that process
and, um, I'm
happy to see that you've got
navigators from
MC OS working with
your staff. Your
navigators are
your navigators specifically
for Cara or
how, what, how,
what's their scope?
>> Um,
Mr. Chair, um
Representative Jones.
Um Yes, they are, but I'm gonna
let Kathy answer that because she's been
building out this program.
So
>> thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative. Yes, they're
specific to the
career program
and the idea is that they will be
going into the home, they will
be doing a family assessment
with the family, determining
what really needs to happen
and connecting
them to either
resources in their community
or, and sometimes
there is a waitlist for
substance
use treatment
but making sure that the child
is safe and family well being
are obviously key.
And so with that family assessment,
that's going to be much more
comprehensive, we can
really say, what is
your support system like? What
does it look like? What are your future
plans? What do you want to do? But
also make sure that immediate
safety for the child
is present. So
it's going to be, you know, we'll,
we'll see what immediately needs
to be done. But what also in the
future can we support you
with to ensure
that the child's well being
and, and the family's well
being. So that's,
it's kind of twofold.
>> Thank you. Thank you for that.
>> And I just really quickly add to
that, the one thing that I really want to
make sure that our navigators are
doing when she says, you know, it will be
a warm handoff is
the follow up. And I think that's
something that has really been lacking
is there's a plan of care and
then we give somebody a piece of paper
that says go get these services,
but then there's not really that
follow up to make sure
that they get them or if they can't
get in that, there's an
alternative. And I think that is
going to be really important
and we want to really make sure that we're
stressing that with our navigators
that it's not just
handing them off. Um It's
really following through with them for
that first year or 18
months, whatever that looks like to provide
that. So, >> absolutely, that's
standard nursing care. You
identify a problem, you come
up with a plan, you figure out how to
implement it and then you have to
re-evaluate. And that
was what disturbed me so much
about Cara. We, we were
handing a list of
resources with a signature.
People didn't even know what they were signing
if they did sign it. So
now engagement,
I, I'm confused about what
you said with, you're going into the
home, but this is
still a voluntary.
Kara is still voluntary. How
does that happen?
It's only if they choose to
have you in their home.
So, >> yes,
it's, it's like many of home
visiting or even fit
services where
they could say no, don't
come in. Um, we're
hoping that we're able to build
relationships and, and that's
really about hiring and making
sure that we have, uh,
folks who are really good
at, at that
part and not to be
so scary. You know, we
talk about, I talk about family
services in a way that it's
not protective services.
We're coming in to support you.
We're here to help. We
really want to make a difference
for you. And this is a way to do
that if they absolutely
refuse services and
we are concerned with anything
we see or, or
um information
that we've gotten because we've gone
to the house and we're looking,
we're gonna refer it back to
Sky for an investigation.
This is, it's,
we have to make sure that child
is safe. That's the,
the final thing.
But we hope that there
will take us up
on the
services. We're gonna
mandate referrals to
our family, infant toddler
programs. Now we
can't mandate services
but we can mandate the
referral.
So I think that
that's another key component
because our early intervention
agencies are
friends in the
community. They are seen as friends
for CYFD May not be.
So this is about us coming
together, like representative
case was talking about
is how do we do this
together to build
this really strong network for
these families? And if that
mom says, you know what, I really
can't take care of my
child right now,
then is there a kinship?
Can we help you get guardianship or
can we help you do those
things? So you're not coming into the
system?
>> That that is excellent.
I I really appreciate
this so much. I'm not going to lose
that much sleep over this
now. I have over
the last two years, but
I have a lot more to talk
to you about. I would love to get with you.
Yeah, and, and
shadow you or, or just
talk more about it because we've
got a really good start on this.
So or you know, you've
accomplished a lot I feel since
our last visit. So,
thank you so much. Thank you Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Deputy Secretary and
real quick thank you for bringing up Tingley
Beach in case everybody didn't hear
that the first time. That was my
bill.
We got to do something, right? Whatever
we can do and foster kids getting to fish
for free is awesome and seeing them come and
arrive. But I'm gonna do the same thing
that represent Kate did. I think
that's a really good idea.
Bombard you with a bunch of questions
we can come back and here's what I would like
to see for me
to know where something is
broken. I need the
schematic
child here, child
here. What is happening in
between? For example, when
you talk about the danger
indicators, what are
those? You know, how do, how
do the call goes in?
What happens? Who makes a
determination? What are the danger
indicators? Then
you're saying you don't go in which I
appreciate that because yesterday it was implied
like you guys just went in and take kids
out if there's no food and that's not
the case. So thanks for clarifying that,
but I need to
know what is this list look
like. So we're starting from there
because we, we as a
team, we want to
help you. We May have different approaches.
Someone May come up with the bill. I don't agree
with them. They May, I May come with the bill they agree
with. But somewhere between we're going
to cross paths and get some stuff
fixed for you. I
need to know from beginning to end
exactly what has happened. So a
child is removed, there's 72
hours you're requesting
that. Um
I need to know what is the criteria
to put them back because that's where we're,
that's too, I need to know what, what
is the criteria for putting them back in the
household? Because if something is
broken and you guys have to do it
this way, it's like with this damn
care thing. I'm sorry that just
pisses me off to know. It's been five
years,
not your fault. You, I've been here five years,
but it's been five years and we're just now
implementing everything. I don't
understand this and the plan
of care being optional is so
ridiculous. Please go get
care. It doesn't work that way.
But then if you're gonna, we're gonna mandate
care. How do we mandate the
care? This is why I need
to know and what I need from you is like, ok,
this is how things go,
I need you guys to fix
this and it's gonna cost
this and this is what another
State has done. This is
data driven science
based. This is what we can
do that another State has done.
We could do exactly as we just
copy the bill. Do it, pass
it all. Agree upon it and boom,
it's gone through. We
also need some sort of oversight. Where would the
oversight come from? I need to know
for you to say to me, well,
we have this issue. There's no
oversight. How do we get oversight with the
care? Where is the oversight in that?
What are the plans of care? How are we gonna
mandate them?
Um I'm gonna bring back fentaNYL
as abuse. I want to bring back
care mandated. But then you have to
explain to me, where do I get the money from
that where we put in? We don't have now
we know now we don't have enough behavioral
care. We don't have enough
rehab. So we're stuck in
this damn loop of oh,
you need help. We have nowhere to
put you, but we'll talk about it next
year. I am so
done with this and I haven't been here as
long as some people who have been here a
very long time who have
seen this repeatedly over and over
again. But I need that
schematic and you say this is what we're
doing right now. This is not working. This is what
other states do? Science based. This is how
much it's gonna cost? Boom, this
is how we get it done in this
special Session. This is
important. What
are we going to bring forward in the
in the special Session? You talked
about Carol Legislation?
What is the urgency? Are you
going to be able to come in and say we
need 58 more people at $7
million and get that money?
Are we going to be able to make that happen?
I'm talking about what could we
do urgently? Right this
second to fix all the
issues and then
what do we have to look at for the
next Session? Because
right now we've got too many kids
and situations
that are either being missing the
loop, they're getting too much
stuff, they're not getting enough stuff. I
understand you have the resources. What can
we do to make it all better?
The other question I have too for
you is um
OK, as far as the criteria,
OK. Are we, here's the actual
question you can answer if I still have
time. Are we
cutting the beds for the youth that are
aging out of the foster care? And
why?
>> I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Are we we the
beds, are >> we cutting the
beds for the kids that are
aging out of foster
care? Is that actual
happening? Cause I keep hearing that's happening.
Is that happening? And
why?
>> OK, all is that all the
questions. >> Yeah. Yeah, but I would like
I want you to come back and address
all the stuff that we have
though with this beautiful, like
a giant flowchart
because I need to know what's broken.
We want to fix it. We want
to help you want, we got a lot of
oil and gas and other money we want to
throw at you to a cause.
So if you just answer that one about
the >> youth beds. All right.
Um Mr. Chairman Representative
Lord, thank you for that list of
questions. Um No,
we are not cutting youth
beds. Um I think you're referring
to the Talaya program and I think there was
a lot of misconception
um from providers and a lot
of unnecessary panic caused
by my staff. Um, and
I'll apologize for that. Um
We are looking at contracts,
as I said, we're really making
sure that the contracts that we have
are sufficient and, you
know, there's a couple of reasons we're doing that.
We want to make sure that we're serving
kids, but we also,
um, you know, are
looking at our funding
and there's issues with that
that I'm happy to discuss.
Um But with
respect to that, we
internally were
looking at
25%
of the funding that goes
to um
falling colors,
um removing those contracts
from there and bringing them
internally to
really be able to
direct where that money
is going in the contracts that
we need. And I think that
when people heard a
25% cut to
falling colors, they thought all
of our contracts are being cut by
25%. And that
message went out to providers and
caused a lot of,
um, concern for them
unnecessarily. And so we've
been trying to do a little bit of damage
control on that. Um,
but we are just taking
that money and bringing it internal.
So as we're doing those
analysis and determining what
we need, we have the
opportunity to send
that money where we
feel it needs to go as opposed
to it just generally going through falling
colors and then making those decisions
on, you know,
when one isn't spending
enough and then they're readjusting
that funding and then we
don't get that money back
or we don't know who hasn't
spent it until the
end of June. And at that point,
we can't reallocate that
money and send it and it
ends up being reverted and
there's too much need out there
for us to be reverting
dollars. >> And thank you.
Thank you for that. Senator Pino
wanted me to say no
sorry
and all seriousness, please bring
us what you need with exact.
This is what's broken, this is what isn't
working. This is what we need. This is what we
need the money from
just help us.
So we're not just making up random
stuff and sitting here brainstorming
about things that we don't technically know if you
need. But then we're also gonna think of our
own stuff that we need to. Thank you.
Thank you,
>> Senator
Rodriguez.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um
good afternoon, um
Cabinet Secretary and your
staff. Thank
you for all your work, Mr. Chairman. I
just wanted to maybe
go back to something
that really stayed with me
yesterday. If I May call
you Teresa, please.
Thank you. Um
yesterday, this lady spoke
and talked about the Children that are
placed in offices and so
on. When you take them, when you
get them from a home.
And the first
question that came to my mind
then was
what happens to a child.
When you take the
child, you place them
in an office overnight. They've been
through this traumatic experience
to say the least.
Um And the next
day they have to go to school
was my first question
and um she
indicated that they would just
take them to school and like
normal, pick them up, take
them and pick them up.
But I ran out of
time and it stayed in
my mind here that
when a child
is picked up and
taken to this, to an
office, for example, and
then taken to school.
What is the system in
place for the child, for
example, does
a child I'm being traumatized.
I can't imagine that
we still expect a child to
learn in school and be part
of a classroom
within an environment
with other kids. And be able to
function, having gone
through that the night before
and not even slept.
I, I can't imagine
it. What is it that we do
to help the child through that day
get through. Is there a
support system?
>> Yes, we definitely have
support systems. And I'm gonna
ask my director of
Behavioral Health Liz to come up
and address that because I think that's
something and I think that really
speaks to how we're
working with behavioral health
within protective services
to really address those needs.
So, >> thank
you.
>> Good afternoon,
Mr. Chair Senator
Rodriguez, um Elizabeth
Hamilton. So what we
try to do within behavioral health
services, we have
um master's level clinicians
that are employed within
CYFD
and with, with it and they,
they are located, at least one
is located in every office
within our State.
And so when we
have Children that are
in crisis or in
need of behavioral health
services, we
deploy that
community behavioral health
clinician to engage
and check in with that child,
check in with the family member, check
in with the worker and to
work with that team to get them
connected to behavioral health
services and whatever support
that May be needed.
It could also be reaching out
to the school and
asking them for that support
because that school could be their
support system. They May have a
relationship with the social worker,
with the counselor, with the teacher.
You want to have them connected to
people that they are, that they're
known to and not a bunch of
strangers. Um
And so our goal
is to continue to grow our
community behavioral health clinicians
or CBHC. So that we have
more of them available
within
CYFD.
Um Majority of them currently
work with our juvenile justice
system. We also
have a handful that are working with
our protective services
and we're deploying more and
more to work with our protective services
cases as well.
>> Ok. Thank you very
much for that for that explanation.
I do have a little further question if I May,
Mr. Chairman, I don't hope my four minutes
are enough, but maybe
for you. Yes, thank you so much.
I'm gonna get a little bit deeper into
the weeds as I'm trying to visualize
Julie. I don't want to leave here again for a
second day, not
still picturing this.
Ok. So the child
goes to school the
next day. But remember the
night before the child
has been horrifically
abused
and much
more than what we can, I
can imagine right
now. And
so then it's
eight o'clock in the morning. The child
has to be in school
and I see your system
that you work with the,
with the people
you indicated you work with to
ensure the child can get support.
But how do you do that by eight o'clock
the next morning when the child shows
up in school
and you take the child or the
caseworker, whoever takes the child
to school and
drop some off there, there has been
no time to discuss
the situation and get the
support because
it's eight o'clock in the morning and the child
has to be in a classroom.
I don't understand. They
tell me. Thank
you.
>> So, Mr. Chair and Senator
Rodriguez, it is going to be
up to that child, whether they're going to go to
school in the morning, there's
going to be checking,
>> excuse me. But
the child to say is five or
six, how can the child
make the decision being traumatized
the night before and bruised?
And so
>> having been an
investigator
when I started coming in to
CYFD, um
I would be on those cases,
taking a child into custody on a,
on a, on a hold
until two or three o'clock in the
morning. The goal is to have that
child sleep and be as comfortable
as possible.
School is
very important, but
having them be
safe,
get their rest
and start to adjust
is more important at that time,
especially because they,
they just been through probably
the hardest time of their
life. And so it's really
about addressing the needs of that
child
coming in, whether it's a
clinician, our workers
should also be trained to know and
understand that and have the
ability to have that empathy with the
child and also be
able to make that
decision if a child is
asleep
that day in school can
wait. >> Yes.
Thank you for that. And, and
that's what I was
wondering if, if you see
the child going through so much, whether
you make a decision,
whether that child will really benefit
from that school day
um based on the
circumstances and how the child
feels, but the child stays
in the office, for example, that
day, the next day.
And so it's all these
questions as we visually try
to understand and help
that still come to our mind.
We haven't seen this in an
office or, or a
child sleeping
and so on, but we don't need to
see it to feel it and
that's exactly what we're going
through. But thank you very much for
that, Mr. Chairman.
Thanks and then I
don't think I have any more time for the other
questions I can reach offline.
Thank you. >> Thank
you, Senator. We'll go
now to Representative Johnson
and work our way back to
the middle from that >> end.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I would like to thank you
for your presentation.
Secretary and staff. My
question is
uh what is your
government to government
relationship like
with our tribes
and pueblos?
And how does
that work? How is that
going? And is
there a great need?
Thank you.
>> Um Mr. Chairman Representative
Johnson. Um Yes,
we do work. Um I don't
know if you've met Donna
Lynn Seino. Unfortunately,
she couldn't be here with us today,
but she is our director
of Tribal Affairs. Um
She has a team that she
works with um and works
across all of the
nation's pueblos and
tribes. Um She
does so many staffing
with them throughout the year.
Um I at one point and I'll
provide this graphic,
but she had a list of
all of the meetings and,
you know, the staffing that she does
with them to provide technical
assistance, to work with them on
their cases. Um
And has really worked on relationships
with all of those.
Um I was
up before the all
Pueblo Tribal Governors week
before last to just give
them a presentation on, you know,
what we do at Cy of
D really talking with them
about our new family Services division
and how we want to incorporate
that into the work that they do and
not just protective
services. Um And
so, and I will be up next
week, next week, no week
after next in
Farmington for the
G to G and the tribal
summit um to work with
them and provide information.
And so I think that we have
very strong relationships with
them. Um And Donnelly's
staff is out there, you know,
if not, um
virtually doing technical
assistance visiting um in
some of those locations.
Um You know, I think one of the
barriers that we did see, somebody asked
me earlier about barriers,
we did receive funding to
do cultural connected
activities with them. We
put out an RP or,
you know, a grant application for all
of those tribes to do that.
You know, we received, I think half
a million $500,000
and I think we spent
25,000
$30,000.
Um, and you know, so I think
that is something that, you know, I think
I'm gonna ask for that funding again,
even though it wasn't
spent because I think
that's so important for us to
be able to do that and have that
available. You know, we ran
into barriers about anti
donation um,
and different aspects
there on spending that
funding. And so, but it's something
that we're going to continue to do and build
those relationships.
>> Thank you. I'd
also like to take you up on
your um
invitation to
meet with you, your
staff at the Gallup
Farmington office
and I'll look at the calendar for the
Gallup Me uh Farmington
meeting. >> Absolutely. I'd
love that. Thank you. Thank
you,
>> Senator
Lopez.
>> Thank you very much, Mr.
Chair
and uh
thank you madam Secretary
for your presentation
today. And
I'd like to say thank you also
for participating with us
in the Senate Memorial Five Task
Force. I, I do
believe that um, we're gonna,
I think with all the meetings that we're
having that, you know, maybe there
will be, I think even
more um
positive outcomes that we
can work together between the
legislature and the
Executive, which is something
that is needed.
Um
Mr. Chair, um madam
Secretary, we, we've heard
some testimony
yesterday and this morning
and of course, Kevin asked tomorrow
morning and I know
that
um,
over the years, one of
the um
frustrations that I
feel and have
felt and have currently
feel too is because
um
we sit here and
we try to do the
best we can, we can introduce
Legislation, maybe put
some money in and such.
But the,
the act of implementation
of what happens is in your,
you know, it, it's in your Baily
rig, it's what you all
do.
And I know in speaking to many of
my constituents
um who have
Children that have been in
the system, you know, they're
working on issues on trying for
reunification,
talking to the grandparents
who are raising grandchildren,
not just in my community but
across the State.
Um There's always a lack
of a frustration of
information.
Um And I mean, the list goes
long. Um
So Mr. Chair, you know
what I again, appreciate you
sharing information, but a lot of
it um again, gets
back to the transparency issue
of what Cyfd does
and it's always a question that we
sitting here and I can talk about
myself because there's always questions
to ask. And um
again, with what Representative Kate
said, I'm a visual
person and
visual is always good to have
something in paper that I can go
back with my coffee in the
morning or something and, and review
to kind of get a better
picture
of and Mr.
Chair,
you know, for me, um
I also have concerns about
what's happening in our juvenile
justice system,
um, oversight of what
Cfcyfd
um, has with regards
to the, the,
um, um,
centers around the
State.
And I know you
noticed you mentioned that there was
something being transferred and I know
there's a lot of information but
what is moving over that you
talked about earlier,
um, in your presentation
today, something is
being moved from juvenile justice
into something. And I don't know
because I didn't, I wasn't fast
enough to write everything
down. Um But
you also talked about the
intake of I,
I'd like to be part of that
and see what your changes are going to
be um with
regards to intake
for um our youth
when they come in
and Mr. chairs.
Um I'm, I'm beginning
to educate myself madam
Secretary about what's going on
in Bernell County
um within our Youth Services
Center. Um I have
concerns and
I've been vocal on this Mr. Chair
about the Governor's suspension
of the JDA. I
um in her >> Executive
message last
year. Um
I believe there is a lot of positives
that were in there, Mr. Chair.
And yes, I know that
there are changes within our
youth, but it's a system
that we created as adults, Mr.
Chair and our youth
I believe are reflecting what we
have not been able to do as
adults,
um regardless of
what it is, they follow what we
don't do and what we
do. Um
So I'm just sharing
that with you on my perspective,
with regards to our juvenile
justice system, we've
done a lot of great reform
work over the years and I would
not like to see us go
back to where we were
before and
Mr. Chair that goes back again
to where we offer services
for intervention
with regards to
um our young people and their
families because
in, in conversing over the
years, many of those
Children um
do have trauma
and if we're still not addressing those
issues, Mr. Chair, you
know,
where do we go?
So those are some of my concerns,
Mr. Chair. Um and
just one final thing I know,
um I'll borrow a couple
of minutes from Mr. Representative
Garcia is when
we talk about an anti
donation and I
stress this with the just
before Session this last year,
but New Mexico did
the New Mexico works
program. So
we um we use
general fund dollars
to help families who are applying
for TANF, but they don't have
to get on the federal
system.
We use our tax dollars
to pay families, Mr. Chair and you
May remember this bill, I sponsored
it and it's there
where we actually use our tax
dollars to pay families
for cash assistance
if they're going to school,
you know, they have something else that they're
doing, but we utilize our dollars
and we figured it out Mr.
Chair. It's currently in
existence. It's still a line item in
the State. Budget.
So if we could do it for that program,
we can do it to find other
ways to provide funding
for resource families or for our
grandparents. I've talked
this over and over, but I'm
saying it here in public again,
we've done it. It's currently
happening and we can find ways to make
that happen. Thank you, Mr.
Chair,
>> um Mr. Chair Senator Lopez.
Thank you very much and I just want to
thank you for bringing forward
Senate Memorial five.
And I know, you know, I'm
gonna be honest, I grumbled about
it because I sit
on. So there are so many task
forces that my staff and
myself sit on, you know,
yesterday, we were in Farmington
last week, we in Las Cruces on
all these different task forces
that basically tell us what
a terrible job we're doing. And I get
super frustrated because
I'm like, you know, I know that we
have issues, but I really just
need solutions. And
so when I heard that there was
gonna be another task force and there
was gonna be all these Members.
I grumbled. I
was so pleasantly surprised
to sit on that. And
really, it was the first
time I think where I sat on a task
force and I'm like, people
really want solutions and
they really want to help.
So, thank you.
I'm really looking forward to
continuing that
and being a part of
it and actually being able to find
solutions to fix
this agency that,
you know, really has been troubled
for a very, very long
time. And so,
um I'm grateful for that. So I
just wanted to say thank you um
with respect to
JDA, I and the Governor's
Executive Order. Um
You know, I think it's
incredibly important that
we continue the prevention and
intervention work. You know,
I've met with J Jack
to really push them to be
more innovative in the way we
do that. Um It's
part of the reasons I created family
services because I feel like we
need to meet families where they are and
not wait for crisis
and really provide them
services to have
a Navigator in the office, to have
a care coordinator, whatever it
is we want to call them, but
to give them
support
to get through life because it's
hard. And so
I absolutely am not
saying that we're suspending
Jdai. I know the
Executive order said, you
know, suspension of JDA.
I, but really in
conversation that I've had with the
Governor and the way that we've implemented
at the department, the
only change that we are
making with respect to the
work that we do,
um for the,
you know, juvenile alternatives
is with respect to the
firearms. There is nothing
else that we're suspending in the
department. In fact, I believe
like we're really working to
make sure that we're enhancing
how we can support you. I
think it's important to do
that um, with respect to
the program that we're moving over,
you know, it's issuess that come
into the department like
truancy that can go to family
services to really feel
because a lot of times there's
underlying issues
why a child is truant, you
know, maybe they're home caring
for a younger sibling so the parent
can work. Right. So let's
get them,
um,
childcare services so that
older youth can go to work
and every, I mean to school.
Um So we're really
looking at ways to do that.
The other thing that's moving over
from um juvenile
justice is families in need
of supervision. And so that will
go over to family services
so that they can really have that
one on one time to
work with those families, connect
them with services and then do follow
up with them. And
I don't feel like a family in need
of services needs to be
in the juvenile justice
system.
So that are the changes that
we're making. And, you know, I don't
think that we're trying to eliminate any
of the work that we're doing on
JD. I,
so hopefully, you know, if you have other
questions, I'm happy for you to connect
with Kathy to talk about that.
Um
I think that answers the questions
you had.
>> Let's work on the money, Mr.
Chair. There's, there's
already >> a process to provide
resources that's already there.
We don't have to reinvented the wheel.
Thank you,
>> Senator Pope.
Thank you Mr. Chair,
you know, there's been some great questions
and great comments and
just want to reiterate that
this is really about us working
together
and really looking out for these kids
and supporting the families.
Uh I just came back
from a conference
last night
with some of the nekc
folks in N CSL talking
about youth and young adults
and um things that
we can do better and what's going
on in other states.
And so I guess the question I, I
have is dealing with
foster care and
we, you know, you mentioned, you know,
having a child in foster care for
10 years, right. It's
not, it's not
what we want.
And I guess if you
can explain to me, maybe some of the
barriers
um to
maybe make sure that that
doesn't happen.
One idea I heard from there
was, uh for
example,
you might have a
child and
the parents don't want to
relinquish their
rights.
But maybe, I think it
was in one State, they decided
to let that person go with maybe
another family member where they don't
relinquish the rights,
but they're able to still do that
and not go into the foster
system. And so
have there been any thoughts of anything
like that or are there any other
barriers or things
that maybe we can remove
to really, you
know, even if a child
leaves their direct
family can at
least get support from other
Members of their
family
without having to go into
foster care.
>> Um Mr. Chairman
Senator Pope. Um
so yes, I think,
you know, it's shocking to me
sometimes and I think, you know, when I
first got there, we were dealing with
an individual, um, you know,
who had disrupted, disrupted,
disrupted from several different
areas. And we were trying to find
placement and I asked
that question, you know, and I guess I'm
very naive in this world.
Right. And so I said, well, how long
has he been in our
care? And I think the answer
was like 12 years
and I about fell out of my Chair.
And so it does
happen quite a bit
more often than I would like
to say. And so it's really something
that we're looking at. But
we do have a process
where if we bring somebody in,
in invest in investigation
and there is another family member
who can safely
um work with that
child, you know, we can
do a safety plan where
that child is then
placed in that home and
we can close that investigation.
And so, um you know, I
think val can probably
address the issue more and
talk about what we do to do
that. And, you know, if there's things
that maybe we're not thinking of that,
we can change that system, you know, we
can have that
conversation.
>> Um Thank you, um Mr.
Chair Senator Pope.
Um We do have
the option for
guardianship for
family Members where we can
support uh
guardianship financially
also. Um And
so that's an option. I'm
happy to discuss that further
and provide um some
information to you that you
can distribute to
people in your community. Who I know might
be interested in that.
Um And, and like I said,
New Mexico does a fabulous
job in initially placing
with relatives or
kin. Um
And oftentimes
those relatives will say we'll
just, we'll just file on our
own for permanent guardianship
where those Children would not come
into foster
care.
>> Thank you. Thank you, madam,
Secretary and deputy Secretary. Thank
you Mr. Chair. So I
have
>> thank you Mr. Chair.
Thank you madam Secretary and
all of your staff who came
today. I'm just
going to zip through a few things
and you can respond to
what you want um
in small communities.
Um like I'm gonna use
Sam Miguel as an example.
My um J
Jack, my DW I
and my uh
County Health Council
all work together
because there are so few
people, they don't have
the time to go to three different
meetings a month.
So they have similar
interests. They meet
a little bit separately, they meet
together and they
work with the whole community. So
that might be another model
to look at.
Um We
heard several things
yesterday. So
uh some of what we
heard, in fact,
this was from a public comment
about rejecting Children
and not taking Children
into the system.
We heard
um
about
poverty and
I would encourage you
as Senator Lopez brought
up to look at
TF we used
to use temporary
assistance to needy
families for transportation
for um a few
months of rent for
extra food.
And um
there are options to do
this on a temporary basis
and not long term
through the
waivers or through the
State plan amendments.
And let's see
here,
transitional services. We
heard from some individuals
who actually were young adults
and were actually
homeless. They
came out of the foster system and
they weren't receiving
transitional services
and they were
in a bad way as they
came to present to us
yesterday. And there were two or three
individuals who
came to present
to us. And my
last question is, is
the department too big?
What should be
changed or transferred?
Thank
you.
>> Ok. Um Mr. Chair Senator
Stefani,
um
ok, let's see.
Um We will
definitely look at the town of funding,
um and make sure, and I think that's
something that, you know, Cindy has
really been doing as
she's kind of looked at all of our
finances at the department is
really looking to see where we're not
leveraging funding that we're
actually eligible to do
and being creative about
how we can, you know, look at
that differently. And so
that's something that we'll look at and
Kathy that would be helpful for her
in her programming as she's really
trying to find, you know,
ways to help
families um
with respect to re
rejecting Children that
are coming into State
custody. You know, I
don't think there's an, is
a time that I can think
of where we've gone out and
done an investigation and said
that a child is unsafe
in their environment, but
we're gonna just leave them at
home. Um I think
we take those kids into custody,
we work with law enforcement or work
with the courts. Um, you know, I
know that there's been a couple
instances where we felt
very strongly about it where we had
to really push for the
removal. Um And
so I think staff is making
those um calls
and working with, you know, doing
the removal when we feel it's
necessary. I think there
could be an instance and I think
Representative Vincent brought this up
earlier where, what's a
time when something might be
screened out? So there
could be a situation where
maybe um an
individual as deputy
Secretary alluded to, maybe
there's been allegations
that uh
maybe a coach has been
inappropriate with the youth.
That would be something where law
enforcement would get involved and
not necessarily the department.
So we would never in that
situation go in
and remove that youth from
the home and say that they're
unsafe. Um We,
we do allegation
of, you know, a caregiver
or parental abuse and those
are the cases that come into CYFD.
So that would be an issue between
law enforcement
and the courts to be
resolved. And so that's really the only
instance that I can think of
where maybe we're saying that we're
refusing to remove a
youth from an environment.
Um I don't know if you can think
of other
instances.
>> Um No, that's, I
wouldn't either. I would be
really curious if,
um for that
specific example, so I could
do a deep dive into,
into that
situation.
Um Also, um, Mr.
Chair and Senator
Stefani, um, in regards
to the meetings,
we do have
MDT S which are
multidisciplinary team
meetings almost
um in every county that
occur, which are
CYFD staff
Members from law enforcement
State, police sheriff's
providers. Sometimes
hospital staff come
together either monthly,
quarterly, depending on the
county. Um, and then they
discuss or review a couple
of cases and look at best
practices. What did we do? Great.
What did we not do so
well? Um, and lessons
learned. So there are
MDT S in almost every
county
>> and then Mr. Chair Senator Stefani
lastly to your question about is
the department too big.
Um, you know, I struggle with that.
I've asked myself that a
lot and I'm like, if it's
too big, what would make
sense to mov'e out of the
department and where would that
go? And,
you know, I really, I've sat down,
I've tried to, you know, map
that out and figure it
out and I
think that the programs
that we have in the department
benefit each other
and it gives our staff an opportunity
to work together.
Um, and I don't know what
would mov'e out, you know, would it be
separating out juvenile
justice and where would that
go? Would that be in corrections?
Because I don't believe that that's
the right place for that to be.
And I believe that you should be
within the department and have the
benefit of working with our behavioral
health services. You know,
moving behavioral health services
out loses that
opportunity for those
social workers to be
there with our staff when we bring
in that four year old at, you know,
two o'clock in the morning to
ensure that we're giving them what
they need. And so, you
know, moving that out, I think
would create more
harm um, than it
would good. And
so, um,
I can't honestly
think of if we broke
the department up, what
would leave that would
make the department better
because I think everything that's
connected works really well
together. I think it really
was just about structuring
that. Um, so
that we're more efficient and
effective in the work that we
do.
>> Yeah, I do.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um So I
have a ton of
questions.
So I, I it's
really hard for me to like pick
which one is most
important. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna read all the questions I have,
I can send them to you.
Um If we have time, you
can answer a couple of them.
But, um, what
I would like is a written response
back and we can share it with the Committee
as well. Some of the questions have
already been answered, but I already wrote them
down. So I'm gonna ask them again.
Um So,
um and they don't go in any
particular order,
but really in response to
some of the comments that you made
some of your presentation and then
questions from presentations
that we had um
yesterday and today as
well. So,
um you said that
there were 21 kids staying in
offices, I'd like to know
um the current
breakdown in terms of
ages and then also
where,
which county offices and
how many kids in each office
you mentioned that um
7 to 9 kids in a
foster family? I think that's
too many. Um Is it a
sibling group? Is one of my
questions? And my other question
is how well resourced is this foster
family? What kind of supports are they
getting um time
frame for kids in custody
beyond six months?
Um 10 years
is a long time for any
kid to be in custody?
Really? Act actually,
realistically, 1 to 2 years is the
way too long, especially
when you have a child who
is very young, who, who
begins to attach to
the foster parents and
you know, sending that kid back
home is again,
very traumatic.
Um
366 kids
are waiting for adoption.
How long have they been
waiting? And what
is the department doing to recruit
adoptive parents or relatives
to adopt these
kids?
Workforce development has been
one of the issues that I've been really
uh focused on, especially
at CYFD.
So um
also recruitment and retention,
I didn't hear any mention about
hiring social workers. I had
mention of hiring workers.
Um I think that hiring
social workers is crucial as it
to this department. And so
social workers are trained
to assess and respond
to uh families in crisis
and also to be able to,
you know, figure out what kinds
of um treatment each
family um needs.
You mentioned a tool,
an assessment tool.
I've always thought that as
assessment tool doesn't make any
sense. Um That's why
you need to hire social workers.
My own personal
theory in terms of the tool
was that this is something that was
developed because
there were a lack of social workers at
the department. So you needed something
for other workers who didn't have that
kind of specialized training
to go by in terms of determining
what kind of a change child was
in.
Um
sys you're right, systemic change
does take time.
But the department has been under
Kevin as for a very long
time years.
Um And I think part of the problem
is that every time we get a new
Governor,
Cyfd gets
reorganized, um
I remember when um
juvenile justice was not
part of CYFD, I
worked uh for uh
as a, as a uh
CPS social worker
from 81 to 91
back in the day under consent
decree. So that was a time when the
department had made some very,
very significant
changes and one of them was
um you know, hiring social
workers. But I, again,
every time we get a new Governor,
we get new ideas
and we get new changes
and reorganization, shuffling
the chairs, all that kind of
stuff. Um
I am also concerned about
the number of kids that are referred to the
general justice system.
Uh I don't like
the changes that were made last
year in terms of the
Executive order. I think
that we need to respond
to um especially
kids bringing guns to school in a
very, very different manner.
And in your report, I didn't
hear anything
about restorative justice.
We need to mov'e away from locking
kids up that doesn't help the
kids that doesn't help
um us
as a society.
Um I'm hearing that
some workers are not making court
reports on time
on. Can I borrow somebody's
time?
Um I,
I um a
and so that basically
results in cases being rescheduled
before the court again,
prolonging permanency
planning for these kids.
Um I'd like to know if that's
correct. Um I'd
also like to know uh what the
training plan is for
CYFD workers in terms
of trauma based care
and also the importance of treatment,
foster care.
Um One of the presentations
that we heard yesterday talked
about um title four
E plan for families
first prevention services and this
is at the federal level.
When will the department submit,
submit their plan?
Uh CYFD,
we, we got a little graph
yesterday. This
is a little graph.
Um, but basically
it talks about protected sort
of spending and from
fy 22 to fy
24
prevention programs are at
the bottom. They, they
barely, you can barely
see them on this graph.
My question is
what's, what are the,
how much is being spent
on pre preventative service
for fo I 25?
And then also what are the current
caseloads for investigations
and permanency planning? Uh
We heard a report yesterday
about aggregate numbers,
but those caseload numbers seemed
very, very low.
Um How many
cases are still backlogged? And
what's the plan for clearing up
that backlog? And what's the time
frame? Uh
Today we heard that
all faith
um,
would be cut by 20
or 25%. I don't remember
the actual number for
foster care and adoptive
home studies. Is this
correct? And if it
is, then who's going to pick up the
slack.
Um And then you
talked about family services
department. So how, what
I want to know is how many of how
many um services under
that department are actually new
services. I heard
about a contract with PB
and J um
that, that basically
provides uh services
to uh families
who one or more parent is
incarcerated. That,
that I know that that contract has been
in place for a very, very long time. It
was when I was there.
Um, and
then I, uh,
would like to
actually take you up on,
uh, shadowing would
like to shadow. I mean, I, I'm
happy to meet with management but I
really want to talk to workers.
Um, so I would love to
be able to shadow,
um, a
worker who does
investigations and
permanency planning.
I'd also be like to
participate in a, a staff
meeting if that's possible.
So we can talk and, and,
um, figure out schedules
and I can send you this list.
Thank you.
>> All right, Mr. Chair
Representative Chavis, let me see
how many of those I can answer and
then we'll get back to you with written
answers on those. So I'm gonna
start with the most
recent, um, the
PB and J is
actually new, that program
was established a long time ago.
It had stopped for a while and
then that's now restarted.
And so I think there's
also some federal funds that
we're receiving to restore that.
And so hopeful to
start getting that back off the
ground with respect to all
faith. That's the 25%
cut that I spoke to
about, um, the
money that was going
to,
what's it called
to, to my
home
falling colors. Thank you.
Um So the money that was going
to falling colors, that's the
25% cut that I
talked about that then providers
um, panicked that their
funds were being cut by 25%.
That is not true. Um And
all faces not looking at a cut,
the programming that they do
and the work that they do is
amazing, um, to the
department and we would not
be cutting their funding. Um
Let's see, the
backlog. So as
was reported in the media, you
know, we had a huge backlog of
about 1400 cases when
we started out the year.
Um We reduced that
significantly, um
through efforts with other
departments, I think
right now, we're running a backlog
of about maybe
between five and 600
cases. Um And
so that is
consistently
about where we
stand within the department.
Um It's cases that, you know, go
past the 45
days for closure and we're
really looking at, you know,
how do we do a better job? One?
Is that a shortage of staff?
Um, because they just don't have
enough time to get to all the cases
because they have such a high caseload.
Um, or is it
just a system
that we have that's not
closing those cases in a timely
manner or moving them
on to other services that are
needed? And so we're
at about, you know, between five
and 600 right now.
Um,
let's see, the case numbers
that were reported and I think you
guys were looking at that when I was
preparing to come and speak to
you, I looked at what we had
online and it is
really deceiving. It
confused me because I
think it shows that our investigators
have like an average,
an aggregate average of 10
cases. But if you look
down at the bottom, it says new
cases this month.
So each of them were
assigned 10 new cases for the
month, but doesn't take into
consideration the current
caseload that they're already handling.
And so we're looking at
changing that on our
website so that it's more
reflective of what
is actually their caseload
and not, you know, maybe we'll have a
separate line next
to it that says this is how many new
cases they got this month,
but this is how many cases they
have in total. And so I
think that was just really
misleading and so we'll work
on that. Um
Let's see with
respect to the plan
for title four E that has
gone back and forth. There's been a
couple of submittal and then it
comes back with questions.
Um Kathy is taking the lead
on that and we're working on
that, you know, as I
mentioned earlier, in addition
to submitting that pan,
we're really looking at how
can we leverage more
um reimbursement dollars
to four e for some of the
prevention and intervention work
that we're doing. Um because
a lot of that wasn't included
in our original plan.
And I think maybe it hadn't been
included because some of the
programs that we provide
through prevention and intervention
are not evidence-based
and therefore not reimbursable
in four year federal funds.
And the reason for that, and
I think, you know, there really
needs to be strong education on
what that looks like is, you know,
we use evidence
informed programs,
but if we strictly
only provided
evidence-based programs,
it would really limit some
of the programs that we can provide in
rural areas and we wouldn't be
able to provide prevention and
intervention, you know, to
some of our communities, including
some of our tribal communities
where we don't have the providers.
But we always look at
evidence informed programs.
We use the California
clearinghouse um
to look at those and some of
those are in consideration
at the federal level to
be included and
you know, are waiting for
the evidence-based
approval, but there's still programs
that we're using. So we're
including those in our
request in hopes
that when they do get approved,
then we will start to
receive
reimbursement for them.
Um, but we are
going back and forth with the federal
government on the plan
and I think right now it's in our
court to make some more revisions
that they've suggested. Um,
and we're hoping to have another draft
to them pretty quickly.
Um
I will turn to
Liz. Do you want to come up again and really
talk about the, the
training that we're doing for trauma
care and treatment,
foster plan. Um
You know, we are working across
the State to provide trauma
training. We did receive additional
funding this Session to,
to enhance the trauma training
that we're doing. Um But if
you want to talk about the who we're providing
it to and what it
is.
>> Um Sure,
uh
Mr. Chair and Senator,
our representative Chavis.
Um So
in regards to trauma responsive
care, um or trauma
informed care, behavioral
health services has been
sponsoring training throughout the
State since fy
23. Um
So we've been able to
uh send
national trainers
out
to different communities
to engage in training in school
systems,
asking for school systems to
come in and get trained law
enforcement. We
have um additional
training happening this year and we're scheduling
additional training for next year
in regards to uh
staff here at CYFD.
Our training department has
engaged in all staff
when they're coming in as new hires.
We're getting three hour training
on trauma introduction
and then we're currently working
on how do we
set up even more
in depth training for our
staff to have on a quarterly
basis. So, trauma training is
not just one and done,
it's a consistent
training that will happen throughout
the lifetime of their employment
within CYFD because
trauma doesn't stop.
Um And so
we really are looking at
how do we keep our staff
informed in the changes,
giving them the engagement
skills, the empathy skills
to understand what is happening with
our Children and with our families who have
experienced different forms of
trauma um
throughout their time and as
an employee with Cyfd,
>> thanks
Liz.
Ok, I'll continue on
your list with respect to the court
reports. Um
that is accurate. Those have
not been submitted in some areas
in a timely fashion
um
in talking with staff. I think
it's not so much that
um they don't have
capacity to doing it. I
think a lot of staff don't really
know how to do that.
And that's something that, you know,
um I've tasked my new
general counsel with is to
actually set up a training
for those caseworkers
that are required to go in and
testify in court so
that they understand, you know, what
does it mean
to set up a
report for the court? What needs
to be included? How do we
present that? How do we
communicate with the court? How do you
testify, you know, these
are caseworkers and I spoke with
one who said on her first
day, you
know, back from training, they gave
her, I think a couple of cases and
one of them was in court that
day where she had to present a
report and had no
idea how to do that. And
so we're
looking at better preparing them
to do that. Um
And then really working to make
sure that those are done in a timely
fashion. One of
the other issues that we really
struggle with and it is a barrier
that I'd love to really try
to figure out solutions is we do not
have enough children's court
attorneys. Um
I think, you know, we're looking,
I think we have FTEs
for 48
and I think currently we have like
14 or 16.
I'm some number that's
totally under what we
need. Um It's been a
huge struggle for us to
recruit attorneys.
Um We're looking
right now at the law school,
we've created um
additional opportunities.
We've created some law clerks
so that we can
bring individuals in maybe that
are LWS or L threes.
And as they continue, they
can just progress into those
positions. Um
And so we've created the law Clerk
positions.
We've created opportunities
so that, you know, we can bring
them in and they
can start as a law Clerk once they're
done with the law school
until they pass the bar and then
immediately roll into
a position to give them that
flexibility
so we're looking at other opportunities.
We did, um, increase
the, um, pay
for our attorneys,
um, you know, but
it still is really been a
struggle, especially when a lot
of young attorneys are
out and working and
able to telework.
And so that's
one of the barriers that we hear from them
quite a bit. Um, and
so we're really struggling in
some, especially in some of our rural
communities to try to find
um children's court attorneys
that then would work with
that staff that's preparing those
reports and preparing them for
court. So
we have, you know, been
trying to address that, but it is
currently a problem that we're
having um with time
reports to the courts
um with respect to restorative
justice. Um
that was a program that was
hu hugely successful in
juvenile justice. I couldn't
tell you why it stopped, but
it is something that we're looking
at funding and continuing
with the continuum in those
communities to
build that program back up and
start it again.
Um
I think I might have answered
all of them. What did I
miss?
>> Uh Mr. Chair Representative
Chavez. Um
we have always had a
tool, it wasn't anything
recent. Um
I have a worker who since
1997
has, has been with us and
since that time, there's always been
some sort of safety
tool that is used to
help make the assessment with the
family. Um And
then also in regards to office
days. Um,
we have,
um, five
males over the age of
12, um,
6 females over
the age of 12.
Um, six males under
12 and four females
under 12. Um, I don't
have a breakdown of exactly
how many in each county, but I do have
the counties. Um, and
that's Lee County, Santa
Fe County, Chavez,
Bernal, Rio,
Riba, Curry, Danna
and Grant. So those 21
are in those respective counties
as of last
night.
>> Um ok. And then I think the last
thing that I did not address is you
had a question about funding.
Um
And you said specifically
for the um
prevention and intervention
services. So I think
when you look at that graph of
the funding, it's at the bottom, but
it was commingled in with
protective services, juvenile
justice and behavioral health.
All did prevention and
intervention. And I don't
think we have a clear picture of what that
spending is. It's really
one of the reasons why now taking
it and
pulling it separate
and having, you know, it
won't have its own P code
because it didn't get approved during the
legislative Session as an
actual um separate
P code. But we are gonna
isolate that budget in our
budgeting so that we can truly
know what we're spending on prevention
and intervention and where those dollars
are going as we're
um consolidating that into one
division.
>> So thank you for the
responses. I I don't think
that you answered all the questions. So I'm gonna go
ahead and send this to you anyway.
Um and I would appreciate it in
response. >> Absolutely. Thank
you. >> Thank you,
Representative Representative
Ferrari. >> Um
Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank
you um madam
Secretary and your
staff. Um
So many of my questions
have been answered but
along the lines
of um the
uh numbers that
were given to us about,
you know, uh so
many
um
uh Children in
custody and different things.
I was wondering because
you were saying things are so much
better. We don't have
the numbers from what they were
before to be able to compare.
Can you provide those to
us when you're um
giving us, you know, other
information?
Um
And just,
>> just in connection
with that, does
the department publish
your quarterly
or monthly report
that we could all
have access to so that it would
be able to monitor on
an ongoing basis how things are
going. >> Um Yes,
Mr. Chair Representative Ferrari. We
do have a desktop
um website
where um it shows
the last 13 months on
the website and it kind of does a
comparison, you know, for kids
in care, for days in service,
for adoption, for
um caseloads, calls
to sky um that
all is available and we'll include
that link um for you
so that you have access to see
that. And you know, it's
usually
by the end of June,
the main numbers will be up.
So
>> Ok, thank you. And
also if you could
um include
um the
trauma trainings that were
just spoken about.
Um, how many
were um
given, how many were
scheduled and how many
attendees to
each? Because I know
sometimes you can have
trainings and nobody shows
up or know if it's
mandatory, it would be nice to
know. Um
Also, um
when we were um
listening to other
presentations,
um they were talking
about kids who
had to stay in the office
because there wasn't a shelter to
send them to or, you
know, it was like an emergency
case. When
kids over 14
are staying
in the office, we
heard that they are
not restricted from
leaving because of their
age and
also use of
cell phones.
So is there something we can
change in the law
or the can you adopt
rules that make it?
So, um, these
young people who aren't really
able to make, you know,
proper decisions
for themselves, um,
can't do that, can't
leave.
>> Um, Mr. Chair
Representative Ferrari.
So I think
it's a yes and a
no, I mean, I think there are
things that we can change in the law
where kids at the age of
14 aren't allowed
to make decisions for
themselves. Um, a lot
of times we find issues where they,
you know, refuse to go to school,
refuse to get
a, um, assessment
or treatment or,
you know, refuse to take their
medication and
basically, you know, they have
rights, um, that
we have to abide by.
Um, and so, you
know, we work really hard to
make sure that we're not violating
their rights, but,
you know, kids in
foster care are
not in custody.
Um, right. So we can't
prohibit them from leaving
the facility. I mean, I, I
know 14 is too young of an
age to make that decision,
but they're not in our custody,
um, or restrained
from leaving. And so,
you know, that would be a fine line that we'd
have to kind of figure out. It's like if we
place them in a foster home and
they, you know, they
don't lock them in the room until
they can't leave the house. And so
basically, it's the same for
us, they're just in our custody at the
office. And so really
something that I think would require
further, um, conversation
for us to figure out what that would look
like. Um, and with
respect to the cell phones
again, right. They're not in
custody, those aren't restricted
from them. They do have rights to be
able to contact, um,
you know, their family.
Um, oftentimes though, it's
not so much that there's not a
placement, it's not that there's
an appropriate placement because I said
it earlier, we have about 100 and
90 available beds
in the State. It's just
that some of the needs that these
individuals have, um,
are a higher need than some of the
families that we can support.
So our hope is really to
be able to train
more of those foster families
so they can take kids with higher
needs and then it will be a
home like environment
where you know, they're just like any
other 14 or 15 year
old and we're dealing with those
same issues that we deal with, with
our kids and their cell phones,
>> Mr. Chair and
madam Secretary,
why would they not
be in your
custody?
>> Um, Mr. Chair Representative
Ferrari, they are in State
custody as a foster
child, but I mean, like not
in a correctional
facility where they've lost
their rights and, you know, you're
incarcerated. Thank you. That's
the word. Um,
you know, they're just, they're in foster care,
they're foster kids and they
still, you know, retain
all of their rights
as a teenager. They haven't
been, you know,
um, gone through a
process where they're adjudicated
and they've lost their rights and
so they're just like any typical
1415 or 16 year
old
>> doesn't make sense. Right.
We, I don't understand
how that can't be.
I mean, I know they haven't committed
a crime but
they are
in, in the
care and custody
that needs certain
restrictions.
And so I don't know if
that's something legally
you can look into and
see if there's something that we can
do to change that Mr. Chair
>> representative for a Yes, we could look
into legally what that would look
like for those individuals,
but it would require
us putting restrictions
on, you know, foster
kids then. So.
>> Ok, thank you. Um
Just real quick, the
I'm concerned about
the hospitals being
given contracts. Are
you talking about
regular medical
hospitals or just behavioral
health hospitals or
behavioral health
clinics?
Um when
you mentioned about the contracts
and
um
the
bill,
>> um Mr. Chairman Representative
fri, are you referring to the
billing for being
able to fill out the care of
plan
or plan of care?
Yes, yes. So
that is there, it's not
a contract. It would be a new billing
code that they would then be
able to bill for. So
when their staff is
working to fill out
that plan, it's actually
a billable expense for the
hospital to build the MC
L >> and
that would be for providing
Mr. Chair and
Secretary that would be for
providing
behavioral health or
>> other that
was back to
a so
for completing
the plan of care for a
family where they have
a child who's born substance
exposed.
>> Ok.
And that's
something that
the hospitals will follow
up with. That's
what you were talking about. The follow
up.
>> Um, sorry Mr.
Chair representative. Yes. So
we're, they will,
the MC OS are going to be
partnering with us so that they
will be providing care
navigators that
can help the navigators that we're
bringing on to make sure that
we're following up on the
services when they elect
for a service that they're
actually having somebody who's
helping them to follow
up and ensure that they're
able to engage in those
services and that providers
are available or
that they can then make a
referral to a different provider
if the service is needed and the
providers not available.
>> Ok. Thank you. And
there is AC YFD
office um in
my district and when
I go by all the time
and I always wonder, you
know, how things are going. So
I would love to, you know,
come and meet. I'm
not sure if I have time to
shadow for a whole
day.
Ok. Thank >> you. Thank
you.
>> So thank you, Mr.
Chair. So some
of some of these I'm just
gonna ask and I don't
want to response because you
probably don't have it on the,
you know, on the tips of your
fingers. So I'd like
to know how many kids are out of
State, why
they're out is it that we lack
the facilities, we lack
the whatever and what
states they're in just to look
at how far kids are away
from their families. I
know in the autism world that
was a regular thing.
Um, and
then, um,
and then
throughout the, the,
these two days,
like disruption or
disruptor and that
just kind of,
it's like these are
kids with issues and to
call their behaviors
disruptions. It's
just, it's just that whole
negative. I mean, what, what
I learned in autism
is behavior
equals communication. They
are communicating
something they are
not. I mean, and
they May very well be
trying to disrupt but
it's too so
and I I'm
probably going against the
world on this but
in a different word than
disruption, just a
less negative
connotation word.
Um I'm, I'm big on
that. Um
and then um
also in kids
who, who are
in, in State
custody, I'd love
to see the demographics,
the gender, the
income, the
race and ethnicity, the
disability, what
counties they are. I mean,
obviously everything has
to be disaggregated. So
we don't know who was
who but so we can
start looking at, you know,
is there a counties that's
really, is there,
you know, is, or is it
only low income
kids who are being in place
is, you know, just
having, having all
those in front of us to
be able to start
um start teasing
things out and then of
course, um
Oh, I have a
question on my phone
in terms of domestic
violence.
Um
So last year, domestic
violence didn't get any new
money despite
continuing abuse
increases. What
is your plan to address
the ongoing needs of
families and the programs
that serve them in terms of
domestic
violence?
Um And you can, and you can
answer that or let me go
through the rest of them and then
of course, workforce
is always a
um, an
issue. So I'm
wondering,
is o a
problem still, is
the fact that you can offer
someone a job and not get them
in for six months or whatever?
Is that still a problem?
Because we're losing folks
and your new people.
What's the average length
of stay? And are
you doing exit interviews
with everyone who leaves to
find out
what, why
they left? And
I think that's,
that's all I have.
>> Ok, Mr. Chair
Representative Thompson.
So let's see. Um I'll
do the easy ones first.
Um spo for us
is really not a barrier.
Um When it starts to get a
little long, I call the spo
director and we kind of
shake things out and get
the positions done. So
we're able to hire a little
bit faster. We also
worked with the union so
that prior, we were required
to post a position for 14
days. Um We
worked with the union so now we
can post for three days
and that gives us an opportunity to pull a
list, see if there's anybody qualified
on there, conduct those interviews and
then if not get it posted for
three more days. Um
So that's been huge
for us in trying to
get people hired.
Um
So I don't really think
o has been a barrier for
us at least. Um I don't
know if other agencies are still
struggling there or not.
Um, with respect
to um
um exit interviews.
Yes, we do Exit
Interviews um with all of our
staff through our um
hr department. We
are also through Department of Workforce
Solutions doing stay
interviews because we want to figure
out, you know, what are we doing?
Right? Also, that's really
getting people to stay with
the department so that we can
continue or build upon
that and make sure that, you know,
if it's working don't
disrupt it. Um And
so we're also doing those interviews
through them, they're gathering those and we'll
get back information to
us. Um We've
also worked on a
pre apprenticeship
program through the Department of Workforce
Solutions because we
know how hard it is to get
social workers into the department.
I mean, I agree with you.
I think it's critically important
that we have social workers there are doing
this work. Um It's
much easier said than
done. And so
we've created this pre apprentice
program where we're looking
at first-year colledge
students who maybe aren't
quite sure but thinking about
going into social work
and we're bringing them in through a
program where DWS is
paying for it. So please continue
to support that. Um
And they're paying for
420
hours um for
them to come in and we're putting them
in positions like um
caseworkers where they can,
you know, work with investigators
or permanency workers be out
in the field, help drive kids
around. Um Just kind
of get into
that field to see what it's all
about. We have several of them
working in our receiving center
here in Albuquerque where we have
kids that, you know, at
the age of 12 that where they stay
and so they're working there.
Um And so it really kind of gives
them that look at what
does it look like to be in social
work and work in this field? And what
is that? And then our hope
is, and we just started this, our
hope is then we would mov'e
those kids as they progress
to maybe, you know, their sophomore
or junior years that we get
them into the Stipend program
where they continue to do that
work. And now they're getting a stipend
to continue with Cyfd
as they're working towards
that degree. Um, and then
we get them into the department
and we use our loan repayment
program, which has been hugely
successful to then
keep them there for a couple
more years while we
offer to repay their
loans. And we hope by
that point they're fully
hooked and on the
line and love Cyfd
and want to stay and continue that work.
And so that's something that we're
currently doing. We have
how many of those workers?
Eight, we
have eight and I think DWS is
going to fund 10 for us. So we're
looking for a couple more to
continue doing that. And,
you know, hopefully that will
prove to be beneficial
in trying to get people for our
workforce. But, you know,
we're looking at doing that. I mean,
I think we did run into some
issues, you know, we're really looking
at our funding and I'm happy
to have conversations with any of
you about what that looks like.
Um, but, you know, we talked about
reversions and,
um, I think last year,
CYFD as an agency
total reverted
$6 million
agency wide. And like
I said, a lot of that is because at
falling colors, we have so much
money out in contracts that if
it's not expended and we
don't find out till,
you know, mid June, there's no
way that you could then spend those
dollars. Um This year,
there will probably be more reversions
from them because we didn't approve
them to use that money
to, you know, buy furniture
or buy things like that where
it's not direct services
to individuals. So we're really
trying to get a handle on what's
needed and what's spent.
Um but we are, are
also looking
at ending this fiscal year
at protective services in
a deficit of what's
currently budgeted for
protective services. And
so, you know, we'll be
coming in next
legislative Session to ask
for a deficit, a
supplemental and an
increase in our budget so
that we can continue doing that
work. We have met with
leadership on both the House and Senate
side with the finance committees to
let them know to walk them through
that. Um We've
had LFC come over
and actually look through our
books and, you know, ask
any questions and explain that.
And so, you know, we made a
decision not to mov'e money
from other programs
to cover that because we really
want a clear picture of,
you know, what does it look like
in the current environment
to provide the services
that we do in each
of the different areas at the department?
So, um, you know,
just domestic
violence, can you just
domestic violence?
I'm gonna ask Scott to,
to speak to where we are
with domestic violence and what we're
doing. Um, and I think,
you know, first, I'll just say that we
pulled domestic violence
out from both
behavioral health
and I think
it was living in juvenile oh, in
protective services
and combine that into family
services so that we're
having eyes on it from one
specific
viewpoint.
>> Thank you, Chair and
Representative Thompson
to reiterate the question, the question
was, what are we
doing to have more
dollars come in for domestic
violence this
year
next year? And I, I think
that's
so bringing
domestic violence into family services.
We're really trying to
look at how can we actually
partner with
the coalitions
with the agencies doing the work
when it comes to
a funding? That is
also a legislative
task. So
figuring out how are we
using the dollars in a way that is
meaningful? And
if the budget is flat or
if the budget is less than flat,
how do we support any
requests from the
agency to
expand that? I think we've
had multiple
conversations with the coalition
themselves and with the
agencies who have been really
clear about uh folks
doing this really important
and difficult work who have not
been able to raise pay
for their people for 1015
years. So we're,
we're well aware
of the
challenges. Um
and part of the,
the work
and
working closer with the coalitions
and figuring out how can we use those
dollars that we do have in a meaningful
way while also
looking for? Is there
federal funding? Is
there private funding? Are there
ways to increase
that?
>> Thank you, Scott. Um, I
also just wanted to add that
as we're looking at the contracts.
Um, you know, if there's additional
funding out there that's being spent
somewhere that's not giving us the results
we need, we will look at
reallocating that money to domestic
violence. Um, there's
also several
appropriations in junior
money this year that are
specific to domestic
violence and we'll be making sure
that we get that money out the
door early. I think one of the
issues that we've had in the past is it
really takes us a long time to
get that junior money out
and it doesn't give those providers
sufficient time to be able
to, to spend that. So
what we're looking at making sure
that that money gets out the door
early
and then I think there was one more
thing. Oh, out of State
kids.
Ok. Sure.
But just so that, you know, we have
24 kids that are currently
out of State, but we'll get the information
as to where they are
and
just
24
>> they
could,
um,
I, I've got a few questions of
my own so I'll, I'll go ahead and
first just, I
think we're very encouraged by
the thought that,
that you all are
beginning to
um
reverse
the, the
perception that the
protective services is
the entree to
services that you have to go through
protective services to get
services. And,
and so that's, that's very
encouraging to, to hear you say
that, I mean, the,
the, the, the, the proof will
be in the actual carrying it
out, but even to hear
you put it into words is
encouraging. It's something
that the Annie Casey, the
Gentleman from Annie Casey this
morning emphasized
was key in turning
around uh New
Hampshire and New Jersey two states
where he had worked. Um
I I
and I really want to ask
about the Behavioral health
Services because
one of the points that he made
was when the, when
the department begins to
see its
role as all the
Children
of the, of the State,
not just the ones that
have come in through the protective
services portal
that you then
have a, a
AAA more robust
community network of
services that
can become allies
for
families. And that's
what we're really after
not just having a strong
department that has
contractors that serve
its needs, but
having
a, a network of service
providers, some of whom
are funded by you, some of whom
are funded by Medicaid,
some of you whom are funded by
local government or foundations
or private charities. But
that are all working for the good.
And so I, I would hope
that the um for
example, the $10
billion for
behavioral health services for
Children that I
understand the
LFC is
identified now
is coming
to you all just for Children.
Is that, is that the
case?
>> Um, Mr. Chairman? Yes, so
$10 million of the
20 original
allocation is coming to
CYFD for
children's behavioral health services
and we're working really closely
with health care authority
or I don't think they've changed
the name. Human services department
still on what that
looks like.
>> So will you be able to
find the contractors, the
providers, some of
whom might be individual
providers, some of whom might be
agency contractors,
>> Mr. Chairman? I think
that you have to give
to li and the work that she's
doing, she's working
with behavioral health to
look at, you know, bringing
new providers into
the State that aren't currently
here. I actually was
gonna go look at a facility to
do, um, office stays
for females and she's like, oh, no, no,
we have a behavioral health provider
who's looking at that same
building. And so, you know,
she's keeping me on track to make sure
I'm not interrupting that.
Um, but we're looking
at really building
that network, um,
outside of what we currently
have to include all
Children.
>> Yeah, I, I guess
as soon as you say, bringing
in people from out of State, it
brings up
traumatic memories
of Arizona companies
coming, >> I understand.
But, you know,
we're also looking at
increasing the services
that are provided, you know, really
talking to you and m to,
to step that up and figure out
what they can do in addition to
what they're already doing. And some
of our current writers, we do
have a couple
other down in Southern New Mexico
who are both interested
in expanding
services.
>> That's good because
nothing was more deflating
to the legislature than to
appropriate $20 million
for behavioral health service
expansion. And then
at the end of the year to find out that, oh,
gee, we didn't expand any
behavior. We didn't spend any of that
money. That
was really, you know, kind
of
awkward.
>> I mean, awkward. Yes. But I
think I'm grateful that I have an
opportunity to come in and have
a say in how that's spent. So
maybe that sounds selfish.
But I just,
you know, want to make sure that we're
directing it in places where
it's really needed. >> But if it had been
spent, we would have come up with more,
I think because that's something that this,
that this, first of all, we have
money,
we have 100 and 45%
reserves right
now. As I like
to say, every opportunity I
can 9
billion in the early
childhood fund, which I'm
hoping you're
negotiating to get a piece
of that
action.
Those purse strings are pretty
tight,
for example,
home visiting.
Uh I mean, it doesn't
uh it, it doesn't make any
sense to me that we have home
visitation services
that are going
largely
unutilized, un unutilized
families just aren't
hooking up with them. There's
something wrong there
that we've got a service
that's badly needed, it's clearly
needed and people
aren't using it.
And so
something about
that isn't quite right.
That's not your department. That's
that, but that's
a resource that your kara
families, for example, could
really >> a lot of our families
could use. And I know that is
working closely. Kathy
was at CYFD and then
went to CD
and now she's back. >> So
then this morning we
heard of the Samsa
Grant for
Behavioral Health
for the Oh man,
I'll get the, the abbreviation
CCBH
CS and
I'm hoping that
that you all are, are plugged
into those that you will have
a role in in the
creation of those
and the family resource
centers. So we're
on we're on the cusp of some
great expansion of
service for
all kids, not just for
kids that are
adjudicated, abused and
neglected, but
kids that could really
never get adjudicated
because these services
help their families out and
really excited about
that. Um I
had a couple of other quick questions
for you. Do we know how many
Cararra eligible births that
were in the State last
year?
Do we even have that basic
information,
>> Mr. Chair? It,
we average about
100 a month.
So roughly
1200.
>> Ok, 100
a month. So
if you're hiring 19,
is that to figure 19
navigators that you're
some 18? And, um,
and somebody in charge of
19 people, something like
that. That's
a doable number. I mean, that
really good. And I would imagine
that there's probably
only, you
know, one or two in a lot of the
hospitals
but dozens
in the big cities. So if you have
two or three Navigators there, you
could handle that workload. I
think that's a good plan. My
own personal reaction is
for you to hire people
to do it instead of
giving, you know, three
different departments an
opportunity to drop the ball
between the
hospital and the
MC O and
the, and the, uh,
providers
just
do it yourselves and,
and, and, and make sure it gets
done. I think that's a much better
plan. Thank
you.
Um, what was the
other? There was some of the
question?
Oh, Ami, what is
Ami?
You said that's the group that's gonna run
your, your residence
for the, the
12 young men who are
gonna be at the girl's welfare home
or wherever
>> Mr. Chair. I'm not sure that
Ami stands for anything.
It could be an acronym for something,
but they are a provider
that does services for kids
across the nation. They have
one RT C in
Farmington that
we use quite often.
And so they are
the vendor that is
providing the services
for, >> but they're in
the State already. So they're in the
State. So you have a
history with them. You
trust them. They're good.
Do we still have treatment foster
homes?
Yes, we do. How
many do we know?
I don't
know but we can get it.
>> So, and the individual
that's been running the Albuquerque
AMI and getting it set up
for us is probably a name that's familiar
to a lot of people here. It's Tom
Swistak.
>> Oh, that guy.
Mayor Swiss.
Representative Swiss.
That's
the probation officer of
Swiss.
All right. Yeah.
Well, he, I, I think that's a
good mov'e, although
he, he's a little long in
the tooth, isn't
he?
I mean, I mean, I,
he's almost as old
as I am and I don't
know.
>> Well, he's not doing the work
himself. He's coordinating
>> and >> has some amazing staff there.
>> So, older
wiser,
sagacious people are very
good at coordinating that.
Right.
Um,
so
the treatment foster homes, how many
do we have? Do we know
>> Mr. Chair? I don't have the
number right in front of me, but I can get
it to you pretty
quickly.
>> And, and do you,
do we contract for those
with agencies? Is that how you
go by? Which agencies
have the contracts?
>> Um, Mr. Chair, I
believe. Open Sky Red
Mountain.
Um,
hi, dessert.
Yes.
>> YD I has some
treatments.
>> I can get you the list and exactly
how many?
>> Ok.
Um
Four E was the last
thing I wanted to ask about,
um,
the,
the,
um,
the LFC staff person
that, that gave us a report
yesterday, I was talking with her afterward,
Rachel and, and she
said she's
still concerned that four E
money is not being drawn
down
to the extent that it, it
could, that it would be an extra
resource for the department if
you were able to fully draw
it down.
And I wanted to suggest that
possibly this
would be something that hiring a
consultant
who do, who does this
kind of work
uh uh to help States
fully
avail themselves of all the,
of all the four E possibilities.
There's some administrative costs
that could be covered. She said that
aren't and, and
then I was dis
discouraged to hear that not
all of the available four E
internships and,
and, and positions
are being
taking advantage of, is that, is
that still the case or are we gonna
fill them all up next?
Year.
>> So Mr. Chair, with respect
to four E, I think we are
looking at additional ways
to draw down funds. But I think a lot
of the opportunity that we have
to draw down um
isn't included in our current
plan. So I will
say, and I think you May have remembered
during the last legislative funding,
we did draw
down too
much in four E
funding and had to end up
paying some of that back. And
so we're really making sure
that we're being careful in how we're
drawing down those funds. So we don't
have to return money to them,
but we also want to make sure that if there's
opportunities for us to pull
down funds that we're aware of
it, we are bringing in a
contractor to kind of look
at some of, of that.
Um Did they start
our contractor to look at
that's facts?
Um So we are having
somebody come in and really look at that,
we brought a staff person
on that has experience with
federal grants and funding.
And so, um you know,
really making sure that we're looking, but
I will follow up with Rachel
and see if there's other
opportunities that they're seeing at
LFC, that we're not taking
advantage of and make sure that
we're having those conversations.
Um
And then with respect to the
Stipend program and the
drawdown for interns
for four E. Um As I
said, that's really something that we're
looking at enhancing.
I know that I couldn't give you the exact
number of stipend students that
we had this last year. Um
But we're continuing to
use that program. Um
but we do want to increase
the number of individuals that we're
bringing in on stipend
1415.
So currently 15 students,
>> 15, you have 15.
We graduated
who graduated? How
many did did
we attract
into the, the ranks
of the, of the
department?
>> Mr. Chair? I don't
know how many we currently have right
now enrolled in the Stipend
program. I know that we >> of
the graduates, how many stayed
on with the department?
>> We will find out for >> you?
Ok. Yes. Yes, I would hope
all.
But,
and then, and then you're
in the process of enrolling
others. OK.
Good. Last
question again,
I thought the other one was the last,
this is really the last
families
first plan.
I, I,
we, we understand that we,
we have not, we're one of
the five states that have not had a
family's first plan
uh accepted by the
Feds that we
tried and, and, and we
found wanting, but are
we resubmitting, what,
what does that look like,
>> Mr. Chair? We will be
resubmitting. We've
had a lot of discussion
with our federal partners
and when we get feedback,
we make those changes and
we send it back to them on
an informal basis. And
they're like, well, now we want you to look
at this. So we're
looking at, at trying
to meet what
we had a change in our
federal partners too.
And so what they want
is different than what we had
submitted, but they
also, they gave
feedback that they
wanted us to make sure to
include our restructure
that we're doing with family
services because it's so
strong with prevention
and they recognize that
we needed a
heartbeat to get that up
and going. And so that's
what we've done too. They're like
you're doing all this good work,
but you have to show the
infrastructure that you currently
have in order
to put it in your
plan. And, and
basically, instead of us
showing them what we're going
to build, they wanted to see what
we had built slightly
and then see how it would expand
over time. So
that's where we're at. And the
goal is to get that submitted
formally soon.
It's important to note though
that the foster care candidate
is important for us to be
able to draw down funds,
the individual,
our, our families must meet
that definition of foster care
candidate. And
we, our first submission
of what that definition was
was pretty broad
and they said, no,
we couldn't have it as broad as
we wanted it. So,
um we also use
family connections, which is
an evidence-based curriculum
and we have used it since I think
2020 or roughly in
there. And it's
not recognized in the four
E clearinghouse
yet, but it's in the
queue to be considered
to be recognized.
And so which
I know is it, it's a
long way of saying even
if it was accepted
and approved, we'd
still be waiting just
a heartbeat. I hope to
be able to draw down the funds
for those Children.
Right. Because for that,
because it would, it
would be a lot for us to go
back and, and learn a new
curriculum to be able to
retrain to get
that up and going.
We have all of our community
providers now using family
connections, we have our
in-home services, using family
connections. So and
the outcomes seem
to be pretty good
for us. And so I want
to continue building on that. We
know it's in the California clearing
house. So we think it's just a matter of
time.
>> Well, thank you and thank
you madam Secretary. Thank you for
all the staff and the time you all have
put in
your
>> question. I'm so sorry. I
I listened to Representative Ferrari's
question regarding the
kids being able
to not go to
school at the
age of 14 and older.
And I was just wondering about a
little clarification regarding the
Attendance for
Success Act
because I believe
it is up to 18 in the act.
So Mr. Chair
and Secretary
I'm wondering, can we,
can you just give me some information on
why they're allowed to
not go
if the act
says up to
18? >> Um
Sure, Mr. Chair
Representative Block.
Um You know, it's a really good question
and it's something that I struggle with and I
was actually at an office
one morning and it was a school
day and I tried to engage the
youth to say, why aren't you at school?
And um you know,
they got
incredibly
agitated is
putting it mildly.
Um and just
absolutely refuse
to go to school. And I mean, we
can't, you know, we're not allowed
to put hands on youth in
our custody. And, you
know, I'm gonna just say
honestly, aside from like
dragging that person out
into my car and driving them
there and dragging them in,
there was no way that that was gonna
happen. And it is really something
that we struggle with. And it's a question
that I asked my staff often like,
what can we
do? Because I
say like we're technically the
parent and if that
were my kid at home, I would handle
it differently, but I would make sure they were in
school and yet
we leave our staff with
really not the
tools that they have to
be able to enforce
that.
>> Ok? Thank you Mr. Chair and thank you for
that. I I just,
it's weird, right? Because it's
kind of a gray area for you
guys. So I'm just
wondering, can
we help you as a
legislature to help
clarify that or
give you more resources to
have shuttles or, or whatever it
is to ensure that that
child can go to school? >> I
mean, transportation
is not the issue. We have
transportation to get them
to and from. It is truly
just the fact that
they absolutely
adamantly refuse to
go. >> I
see. Ok. Well, I'd
love to talk with you more about
your ideas because
later. But thank you,
I appreciate it. Thank you >> very
much. I appreciate your time
today. >> I
know >> it's, it's
>> thank you. I know it's been a very
long afternoon, but I publicly
would like to wish our Secretary
a very happy
birthday.
>> Thank
you.
Thank you.
Thank you very
much.
>> Take an extra snack
on your way.
>> Thank you. I appreciate it very
much and really thank you for the
opportunity and I look forward
to getting back to you guys, the
answers to those questions,
um the engagement with you
guys as you kind of
walk this journey with us
of, you know, straightening
some issues at CYFD
and look forward to ongoing
conversation about how we can,
you know, make changes during the legislative
Session. So, thank you
>> and uh Members
with that, we will conclude
the agenda for today tomorrow.
We will hear from the
uh Chevin
settlement, uh
attorneys
and uh somebody
else I
forget.
Oh, some of the community partners.
Yeah. PB and J and,
and YD
I
and brainstorming.
Yeah.
Yeah.
OK. With that, we'll conclude today's
Session. Thank you all.
