You Mr speaker I certainly don't
want to add anything.
will get that for you and for me
thank you for asking for it I
can't get it here right now
though.
Thank you Mr I understand that.
seems to me that what this bill
will have the effect of doing is
actually.
Increasing the cost of public
project.
can you can you help me
that it would raise the prices
with labor being only about
twenty percent of an actual
the biggest ensuring cost over
runs in highway construction is
a shortage of skilled labor so
there shortages of highway
journey then and I might add
Your program would build the
capacity for everybody working

raised the idea of speculation
and and I do feel as though the
legislature it is part of my
obligation to speculate because
we are in fact.
Representative that's that's
such a good point and you know
sometimes we pass a law it
hasn't I'm dissipated
consequences and then we Amanda

the actual impact it would have
on companies and most of all the
cost of a road construction
throughout our state so I just
apprenticeship programs and the
structured career pathways for
young men and women but I also

results of our legislation so I
projects there has been no
adverse that.
Thank you Mr speaker and I I
applaud your commitment to all
through.
Occur on public projects and.
And my understanding credit may
be very simple.
I only own two businesses and so
I'm not familiar with many
Monetary contributions
essentially but that is gonna
get passed on somewhere down the
line and my fear Mr speaker that
that somewhere down the line
Yes thank you Mr chairman thank
you Representative remember that
companies have the option of
starting their own mentorship
Thank you Mr speaker that also
for fire is the state going to
pay for the cost of of private
companies building their own.
you're already doing some
training is not really an
additional costs and the
workforce solutions
apprenticeship board has experts
it's not an expensive process.
And Mr speaker I I president of
the Middle being expensive
people that are organizing
training and other things.
So it's it's not any kind of a
significant cost.
for that
Again I think the even if it's
some costs even if a cooperative
but I think that eventually
that's going to trickle down to
the taxpayers having to pay more
rationale Mr speaker gentle lady
is that this whole expand
apprenticeship training program
opportunities for entry level
workers is that correct.
entry worker and expanding
their training their capacity
their scales there is a salary I
think the benefit of providing
our young men and women with
this resume and skills that
expands their ability to work
and eventually own and operate
their own companies.
My my last concern.
Is that I'm afraid that the the
impact of this bill will
actually be to decrease.
But Mr speaker if if we are
again requiring employers to
contribute.
Financially the to a new
program.
And again based upon the canonic
so that the employer has
increased employee costs.
That means one of two things
either I have to hire fewer
employees.
Or I have to increase.
And so what I think that's going
to mean in a practical sense Mr
speaker is that you're gonna
find private companies in this
industry to in fact hire fewer
Mr speaker and hi
Representative.
That could happen some people
believe I believe based on.
they build capacity in our
employees build loyalty in their
employees and they build pride
in their employees so under
so your payment journeymen the
full price and then you're
paying the prince's half price
so I think the cost is going to
balance out excuse me and we're

you earlier this is something
that I'm personally committed to
tracking to see what happens.

Add up I've met one college
graduate at a at a training who
said you know what I would have
like we are in companies have
apprenticeship programs it's not
just a job it's a course of
learning and working and
developing skills I felt that
this was something that we
needed at that it would pay for
that that pays for itself and
benefits the state of New Mexico
as well as individuals and
families so to me it was a win
last apprenticeship council
meeting apprentices have
continued to register have
continued to work and get
trained throughout the last
eleven months some of the
where we have increased reliance
on technology and broadband it's
only kind of expanded things so
that's what motivated me was
I'm thank you Mr speaker thank
you kind lady
I know from experience that many
hasn't changed very much it was
a five year estimate for sixteen
to nineteen year olds was up
thirty nine point three percent
twenty two twenty four year olds
These are staggering figures and
for use in rural areas it's you
know not having a car not having
transportation to get to work
not knowing how you get a job of
state is what we do do is get
what we do is keep building
roads I mean that's just on the
horizon for as far as you can
see and to see apprenticeships
state I'm at gentle lady Mister
speaker
I can you tell me what what what
kind lady what I've heard from
some of those contractors say is
two things first of all the
people that they hire that have
been through apprenticeships
they they learn a trade but then
they see how they can expand
they see a pathway and they see
a vision so those contractors
who have worked with them find
that they're motivated they're
transcends just one specify job
that you come in and do when you
go home they they just have a
bigger vision and the other
thing is those contractors talk
about the fact because they're
their families their whole
situation they find that they
stay longer they work more years
they're they're more committed
so the partnership programs
of worker wholistic mentality.
Thank you for the question Mr

Mr speaker gentle lady I would

brings us legislation up here I
really have to tell you I'm in
conflict with this because I see
this from a very different into
the the effort in this I just
have reservations and I want to
start out was saying that I
don't understand what is the
income to transportation as well
I think this is an essential
of of of.
Technicality I see your
principles I understand the the
goals but I still have
reservations that we are
have these practices in place
now I I respectfully as I'm
understanding this I hope I
you'll correct we were wrong but
part to go to still pay six
percent and and you're trying to
go over the route of it lifting
it to the to the wages of and I
think what we have there's a
transportation a certified
training programs that meet the
specific needs of the
contractors and subcontractors
don't want to call you all right
every time they need above a
possible fix so I give that to
be the example the other concern
I have is that we spent a lot of
money in education to go to C.

part of this process to
insisting these kids coming
right out from high school into
these programs and and work
increase on our on our small
contractors as well I think
that's going to be a concern we
need to piecemeal certain jobs
so that's my question I guess
the metal and when you do that
small business is going to have
an effect around around our
state when they are the ones
that need to be employed
critically through our road
fairness that we should have a
chance in this get redirected to
transportation I think it is to
be brought out as I'm watching
and listening to everybody I
just have conflict right now so
I'll continue to listen and hope
to that Senate tax business and
transportation committee thank
you for your comments.
Thank you Mr speaker yes I are

Thank you Mr speaker

So I just want to start off with
so primary care physician is
somebody that some do go to if
they were having an issue it's a
preventative service they go in
there with the first having
So my deep concern that this is
usually a primary care physician
is.
The front for everything that's
going on right usually you go
see the primary care before you
that they are lower cost like
the lead in the two first is
your primary care physician and
they're going to refer you out
to somebody else so my question
have be the same rate as a
primary care physician are other
doctors are specialists then
going to want the same right.
may not want to do but I will
say that we already have in New

long time and I've dealt with
we going to stop I mean if we're
going to do this with my screen
to speak every single specialist
at the same rate as a primary
care physician unfortunately
from having worked in insurance
they're gonna do they're gonna
raise my premiums I pay for my
own health insurance and I could
see this as every single
specialist one in the same
dollar copay before and I'm not
saying that shouldn't happen I'm
just saying I know the reality
that is what about to happen is
that the insurance companies are
for profit they're gonna start

we're talking about a major
of people we have in this state

come down on the side of we need
to make it accessible and
repeated which is the insurance
companies have loss of ways to
back re balance the cost.
