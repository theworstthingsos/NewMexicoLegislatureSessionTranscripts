Good morning everyone. Uh
I've got the high
sign from our
technician and I guess we're
broadcasting, so we're ready to
go.
Um Just reminder
to the members um
that there is that reception this
evening from 5 to
730
or whenever we
adjourn
either earlier or later
than that uh at
El Monte Sagrado.
And I it's
pretty easy to find, but I'm
sure there are people from Taos who
will be glad to give you
directions if you're not quite
sure.
Um We want to welcome everybody
for coming this morning. We have a
very full agenda. I
apologize for being
tardy and getting
here.
We're going to start this
morning
with uh the New Mexico Medical
Board update. So if
uh doctor Karen
Carson, Amanda
Quintana
Debbie Dietrich and
Monique Parks would come
up and uh give us
their report. We would be very
interested in
that
>> good morning, Mr chair and
members of the committee. I am
Doctor Karen Carson
and I am the chair of the
New Mexico Medical Board
and we are very happy to have the
opportunity to present to you
today. And with me,
I have the medical
board acting executive
director, Amanda Quintana,
and also our investigations
manager, Debbie Rodriguez,
and our licensing manager,
Monique Parts.
And I think,
I don't know if we have the slides
up or are we just going through on paper?
Ok. So, um,
the first slide
we can go through from the medical board
members and the staff
and then moving
on to the mission of the
board. And
the first is a very important
one because it is
the mission of the medical board.
And we were established by
the state legislature
in the interest of the public
health safety and
welfare and to protect the
public from the improper
unprofessional incompetent
and unlawful practice of
medicine. And I did
include some of the
statutes
below. With
this slide, I do want to
reference the title of our, of
our presentation as
legislative goals
and I want to make sure that everyone
understands that we are a
licensing and regulatory
board. We are a board
of medical practitioners and
public members and
our goals are focused and protecting
the citizens of New Mexico.
Our legislative goals
are to educate and
assist you our
representatives as
you work on legislation that
regulates health care
so that we can ensure good
self health care for our
families, our friends and our
neighbors in this
state.
Next slide again is
informational. It goes through our
complaints and investigation
processes, how
we receive complaints, what we
do with them and our levels
of action which may start at
non reportable complaints
where there's no action all the way
to a suspension or a
revocation of a
license.
The next slide discusses
the New Mexico
Health Professionals Wellness
Program that we utilize for
health professionals who may may
be in need of services for
mental health issues, substance
issues, physical health
impairment or workplace
issues. And these
services include assessments,
treatment, referrals, treatment,
planning, monitoring,
and reporting.
The next slide discusses a
long example
of basis for
action from a complaint
coming into the medical board.
And so these are
actions that we may
or issues that we may act
on patient
abandonment, fraud, ethics
violation, incompetence,
practicing without a
license.
And now I'm going to
give the microphone to MS Quintana
who will be giving you some board
updates,
>> Mr chair members of the
committee. Um Thank
you again for having us. We
have a lot of great stuff
happening at the board
office. Um We
have a new upgraded salesforce
licensing licensing system.
It went live April of
2023.
The new system has reduced
the amount of time it takes to
process initial
applications and
renewals.
Um We have partnered with hospital
services Corporation to help
with to help our applicants
obtain all of their
supporting um
application documentation.
Um This relieves the
burden from the
applicant. This also
has helped to reduce
processing
times.
We just went live with our newly
designed website.
This website provides real
time information to our
licensees and to the
public, it's much
more functional and easier to
navigate. Our last
we, our last website was 15
years old.
And finally, the NMB
was just awarded a
$50,000 grant from
the Federation of State Medical
Boards.
With the money, we are going
to add a data
analytics package to our
current sales force
system.
With the, the goal
is to augment and inform
the board's decision making
processes
with um
with the data and
the analysis of the
data.
And now I'll turn it over to our
licensing manager, Monique Parks
to talk about our licensing
statistics.
>> Good morning, Mr chair and members
of the committee. As
you can see, we have a total
of 15,590
licenses. The
bulk of our licenses
are our physicians
and our physician
assistants.
Um We
are seeing a steady
increase in new
licenses and
um renewals
yearly on
the fy 24
total license, um
licenses renewed
as of today. It, it's actually
4308.
This um presentation
was created last week. So
this will continue to increase
through October 1st.
So we, we
um I see
that that
number being close to 5000
by, by um
October 1st actually
is total license
is renewed for fy
24
on the next. Uh
just, >> just, just
to, to explain
why
there are 15,500
I mean 13,000
physician or
all licenses, I guess
15,000. But
but, but there will only
be, are they, how
often are they renewed? Is what I'm
getting at every three years, every
three years.
>> And for our, our midle, our
midlevels, which
are um physician
assistants, po uh podiatrists,
genetic counselors, they
renew every two years.
So physicians are every three
years.
So, on the next slide,
um for application
processing time, processing
times now with our
new database, it really has helped
um streamline the application
process and once we receive
a completed application,
a license is issued
um in nine days or
less if it's
considered um
completed with everything
that is required,
our, along with our new database
as well, our licensing
renewal applications, we have
an immediate automatic
um renewal process. Now,
if the the
renewal application is
deemed complete with no red
flags, it's automatically renewed
and updated within real
time within
minutes of the
submission of the application.
If there are any red
flags, I'm usually um
reviewing those and those
hold are released within 24
hours. So it's, it's
a very streamlined process
compared to what it was.
It's very
um efficient and streamlined.
Now, um are,
and as of
November of 2023
our expedited licensure, we
have issued 72
expedited licenses
within the 30 days
required.
>> Just could you just explain about
the expediter, who are
they and who qualifies for
them? >> So,
the only qualifications that you need
for an expedited licenses?
um is that you
have to have one
good
license, a full license
in another state that's in good
standing.
Correct? Yes, sir.
And they have to have three years of
work experience.
Um So right now, uh
if they want to apply
for an expedited license, they
apply online and they
have to send me an email
requesting expedited
license. Sure.
Those are the, the basis and the
qualifications for that. Right
now,
>> mister chair members of the
committee, we included
a informational slide
on the investigations department
for fy 24. Just
some statistic
statistics
to show
you
in fy 24.
We, we did process
408 complaints.
We opened 408
complaints.
392 of
those were
received or initiated
by the board, received
by the public or initiated
by the board against our current
licensees.
One complaint we
received for unlicensed
practice and
15 applicants were
transferred into
investigations
um from our licensing
department because there were
issues. Um
I'm kind of focusing on
the applicants
in this slide.
Nine of those 15
applicants were transferred
into investigations
due to recent adverse
actions taken
against their clinical privileges
by their employer.
Usually a hospital
based on clinical
incompetency
which
in some cases resulted
in adverse license or
action by
another state Medical
board. Six
of those applicants
were transferred in
due to recent
adverse licensure
action taken by another
state licensing board
due to reasons other
than competency
could be substance
abuse,
disruptive conduct
and
conviction of a crime
that can bar them from
holding a license in New
Mexico. The
outcome of those applicant
cases in fy
24
7 were
licensed by the board
after further processing
by the investigation, staff
after the board reviewed
that and determined that they
were safe to practice
and to issue a license
to
five were not
licensed and that was
due due
to reasons because they were a
danger to
the public either
clinically not
competent
um
impairment by
substance use that made
them a danger to practice.
Um and
the conduct which was related
to the conviction of a
crime.
Three of those applicants are still
pending. They're going to the board in
August.
They, we're awaiting
results of competency
evaluations
that the board asked them
to
complete.
>> Mr chair members of the committee.
Today, I would like to discuss
three matters that the medical
board is examining.
And first, I'd like to start with the
Interstate Medical Licensure
compact. The
IMLC is a little
like TS a precheck.
It is an agreement among
participating us states
where an eligible physician
who has a full unrestricted
license in a compact
member state can then
qualify to practice medicine
in another state and
obtain licensure there by
completing just one application
within the compact.
And again, this is like TS a
precheck. You can skip
some of the additional steps like
taking off your shoes or taking
out your laptop. But you
still have to go through a rigorous
prior screening process
and you still have to go through the
screening at the airport and you still
have to follow the rules of TS
A. So the
licenses are still issued
by individual states and
the state retains autonomy
over the licensee.
This means that if a licensee
has an action in a state where
they receive a license under
that compact,
that state is free
to take action against the
licensee based on their
statutes, not in other
states. This
is not a nationally
recognized license,
it is not portable.
So this is not the same
as a license that's been used by
other healthcare
providers.
And this is a slide
showing
the um
states that are currently
participating in the
interstate Medical licensure
compact. As
you can see, New Mexico is
one of the little gray
spots that is not
participating. There are
37 states
participating along
with the District of Columbia
and the territory of Guam.
There are four states where
legislation has been passed
but the implementation is
processed or
delayed.
So there are conditions to
qualify to participate
in the IMLC
as a physician. And these
requirements include
holding a full unrestricted
medical license in a
compact member state that
serves as the state of principal
license. The
physician must meet the
licensure requirements of
that state. They must
have passed each component
of their training exams.
They have to have graduated
from an accredited medical
school or a school
is listed in the International
medical Education
directory and they
need to hold board certification
by a specialty board.
They also need to have completed
a certified
residency and they
can't have a history of disciplinary
actions, criminal history
or be currently under
investigation.
We do recommend that New
Mexico join the
IMLC.
I'm now going to move on to our second
matter which is the hot
topic these days. Artificial
intelligence.
And I want to point out
that at this time, we don't really have
true artificial intelligence
in many of our processes,
but especially in medicine,
what we have is augmented
intelligence. And
so we've all noted that
the system has been shown
to produce incorrect answers
when we ask questions.
And there was an article
recently in the New York Times
where somebody
asked um A I
overviews they queried
and said, how many rocks should I eat a
day? And A I
overview said you should
eat at least one rock a day so
that you can obtain the proper
amount of vitamins and minerals.
And when that source was
looked at, it was found that they,
the algorithm scraped that
information from the Onion
that's a satirical site.
And but the Onion had a
lot of views to
that. And so the algorithm
picked that as the
site.
And so
I went in and queried Gemini
uh A I Gemini.
The question is chocolate
healthy. And I
received this information about
chocolate. And it
also presented me to these
resources for more
information. And one of
the resources it gave me
that said this is a list of the
health benefits of chocolate came
from piedmont.org.
I looked that up and Piedmont
is a health care organization
in Georgia. So it runs
hospitals and has
clinics and, and
I thought this is really interesting.
It's it's leading, it's
getting its information
from a health care
website.
Um It's not really like the the
world expert in health
benefits of chocolate. The
the other source was the National
Institute of Health. So that's
good. But
it's really important
for everyone.
The users of Augmented Intelligence,
the consumers to understand
that the sources of the
information they're receiving
may not really be
intelligent.
And so the Federation of State
Medical Boards met this January
to discuss Augmented
Intelligence and regulatory
concerns. And at
this meeting, there
were a number of issues that we really
felt needed to be addressed. And
one of the highest rank issues
was education.
We need to make sure
that users of artificial
intelligence and medicine, know
how to employ this technology
safely and effectively.
We discussed accountability.
There are many questions
about where responsibility
lies for these users
of artificial
intelligence. So
the board licenses a
person to practice medicine,
not a machine.
And currently the practice
is by a professional
licensed clinician
autonomous A I
systems and medicine.
Really present us a lot of
novel and complex legal
questions regarding practice
and medical liability.
And we have to continue
to maintain appropriate
medical liability.
We have to be able to
maintain medical board
regulations to ensure
the safety of our
citizens.
Regulators really feel that
the highest risk is clinical
decision making. So
screening diagnosis
and treatment that still really
requires human interaction
and clinical judgment. So
we need to make sure that we
protect the health
and safety of our patients
while we're still allowing for
innovation.
A big discussion is that key
metrics are really important
right now, the companies
that are involved in artificial
intelligence are making up their own
benchmarks. So
Google says that
their artificial Intelligence
has passed the US Mle
the medical licensing exam that
it's passed the bar of certain
states. But
we don't know what questions it asked. Did it
really take the bar
or are they saying
that they took questions like the
bar? Um
So we don't have any
real way
of testing
those claims and we
really need to look at these key
metrics. One of
the
Artificial Intelligence
specialist said this is kind of like you
need FDA A labels, so like
our food, you can look at the label
and you know where that came from and you
know what's inside
and we need to know what we are
consuming.
Finally, we're really
concerned about consent,
data privacy regarding
patients, patients need to
understand when
our artificial intelligence
is being used and
what is being used
by A I and their
encounters
A I can data mine
information about an individual
and that can be sent on
maybe to an insurance
company and then
maybe that individual may not
qualify for a knee
replacement or a hip
replacement because the algorithm
finds they are at too
high risk because
obesity is in their
chart or their age
or their race. And so we
really have to monitor that bias
in A I, we have to make
sure that the algorithms are
equitable.
The Federation of State
Medical Boards released a policy
paper in April of this year
and you have a slide that shows
the summary um from that
paper and I referenced
the link to the paper at the, at the
bottom of the slide.
And the important
thing is that
the
part of what the FSMB came
up, two important things is that
we really have to avoid
overregulation
and regulatory overreach
because we don't want to
regulate what is not in our
purview.
But we really
believe that artificial
intelligence needs to be anchored
in ethics
and in
ethics, there
are established medical
uh princi or ethical
principles and ethics
and that is patient
autonomy, non
maleficence, beneficence,
and justice. And
those are our foundation.
And
that what is what works
for us in a variety of
situations, regardless
of treatment modalities or
technology. And we need to continue
to anchor
those
those governance
regulations and
ethics.
I did put a little portion
of Georgia House bill
887. Regarding
artificial intelligence, there
are lots of bills out there in
lots of different states that are
trying to put up guardrails.
And I think the important
thing with this bill is it's very
simple,
basically says it requires
meaningful review in accordance
with procedures created for
that review. It requires an
individual to have authority
to override artificial
intelligence or automated
decision tools and
it gives the medical board authority
to promulgate rules and
regulations regarding artificial
intelligence.
Now, I'm gonna move on to my final
topic in our presentation
and we call this additional
pathways to licensure.
So just a few weeks ago, MS
Quintana, our medical director and
me were able to attend
a symposium in Washington
DC given by the
Federation of State Medical
Boards regarding
additional pathways to
licensure. And I
want to start with some definitions
that I think are really important
and shouldn't be
interchanged.
So first is
the difference between an
IMG and an
FTP.
So when I MG is an
international medical graduate,
this is somebody who graduated
from a medical school in another
country but hasn't
practiced.
So an IM
needs to follow the
traditional pathway
applying to a US
residency and
going through an accredited
graduate medical education
program in the United
States.
But an FTP is a foreign
trained physician. So this
is somebody that has practiced
in a country other than the
United States.
And they have
clinical experience.
Now, we have to remember
that their practice model
can be very different
from the US.
They may
not have,
they may not
understand shared decision
making. They may not
honor social determinants
of health. They may not have the same
training for sensitivity.
Their practice and training
methods could be very different.
They may not be up to the same
standard as a US
uh graduate and
a physician who's graduated from a
US residency. So there
may be lower quality of
care. We have
concerns about
safety
and additionally, they may
have trouble assimilating to
normal activities of daily
living. So we have
to be very
cautious bringing
in foreign trained physicians because
they could be taken advantage
of by clinics or
hospitals
if they have nowhere
else to go, if they're
limited to practice in
one place, because that's the
only way they can stay in the
US. They may not
know how to use electronic medical
records. They certainly won't
be able to understand our insurance
system. Um and,
and all of the convoluted
health care
systems and referrals
and things like that, that we have in the United
States. So we have to
be very cautious
with foreign trained physicians when we
bring them in because we know
that when we have a healthy
and well adjusted adjusted
practitioner, that
person's going to provide safe and
effective health care to the
people of New Mexico.
So this is the next slide is just
a list of bills that
are looked at in other states.
And this is just a quick
short list of all
the bills that had come up at
this meeting.
Everybody is having
the same issue. Everybody
is looking at alternate
licensing models.
And so at this
symposium, we talked about
requirements. What
what do we really think is
required to license
a foreign trade practitioner at
baseline? And the
three largest criteria
is that we really think that
the training has to be
substantially similar
to a US residency or
postgraduate training.
There also needs to be some kind of
practice minimum. We really
can't
license safely.
Somebody who's maybe practiced,
graduated a medical school
and practiced for two months.
We is it two years, is
it three years there needs to be
a, a baseline
minimum and
then it's very important that we
know what kind of school
they've come from, they
have to be
certified
schools that are certified
by the ECFMG,
which is a credentialing agency
for medical schools that are not in the United
States. So we need to note
that their foundation is
satisfactory so that they can
practice safely.
On the next page is
the Washington State Clinical
Experience License. And
I wasn't familiar with
this. I don't know if, if you are,
this was passed in 2021
in Washington State
and it offers a limited
license for, they
call them international medical graduates.
But these are foreign trained physicians
to gain clinical
experience.
And so you can see
they're telling I MGS
to apply to a
residency or fellowship
program to follow that traditional
pathway. But if
you want to apply for this limited
license, you have to have lived in
Washington State for at least a year.
So you have to show
residency,
you have to have
BECFMG
certified, you have to
pass your training exams
and you have to complete a background
check, then
they have to find a supervising
physician and they have to have a
practice agreement with that
physician and the Medical
Commission of Washington, which is
the, the, their board
and the supervising physician
can't supervise any
more than two I MG license
holders.
And I think an important
part of this is that the
supervising physician
retains professional and
personal responsibility for
any act that constitutes
the practice of medicine
when that is performed by an
img under their supervision.
That may be a sticking point to get
some physicians to
um to
supervise
in some states because
that means that you would be liable
for any action that this, that
this physician
takes.
When we are looking at
licensing foreign trained
practitioners and regulations.
There's lots of topics we need
to keep in mind.
The most important is that we have to expand
access correctly. So
we don't want all these practitioners
going to places where there
are already a lot of health care
providers. We
want them practicing in areas
of need
and we need to
monitor these
practitioners. We
need to track and define
success. We
need to monitor them.
Are they having issues
with discipline, with
malpractice
issues? Are
they competent? Are they
remaining competent? Do we
need to have evaluations?
We'd also need
to give
these practitioners a pathway
to obtain board
certification right now. If
you don't go through an
accredited uh
us residency,
you cannot be board certified.
Hopefully, that's the
the board certification
programs are looking at that,
but that's kind of a
sticking point for some
people.
Um So we really need
to give the
these practitioners
tools. We
also need to make sure they're culturally,
culturally,
culturally, sorry,
competent so that they
can contribute to society.
We want to make sure we address
social isolation in the
rural communities.
Um, a psychiatrist friend of
mine told me that
social situations in small
towns can be really difficult
because like, if you're
treating a golf pro for
depression, it can be really hard to
take lessons from him.
Right. So,
um if you're single, it can be really
difficult to date
if you're the the family,
family practice doctor in that
town. So we,
we need to prepare these
practitioners. They've
also mostly trained in urban
environments and that sort of
training doesn't prepare a
practitioner for rural
medicine. So we
need to really train
and we also need to train the
mentors and the
preceptors,
Mr chair members of the committee.
We do appreciate the
opportunity to present this
information to you and
I thank you. And if
we can answer any questions you
may have.
>> So thank you very much, a
very interesting presentation.
The the three issues, then
are the three that you're, are you
actually proposing that
these be taken up by the
legislature? >> Mr
Chair members of the committee,
we would like to
discuss those issues
with the legislature? Yes.
And and would like those
taken up the >> compact,
the Artificial
Intelligence
and the
licensure. Now, I'm
not clear. Could you just
explain that last one a little bit
because you made a
distinction on an early slide
between an international
medical graduate
and a foreign
practitioner
and the Washington Law talks about
international medical graduates.
But you said it really would be for
foreign practitioner? Which of the
or is it >> both Mr
Chair members of the committee?
I believe when
Washington put together
this, this was in 2021
when this was enacted,
the foreign trained
physician wording was
probably not out there,
everyone was called an
img an international
medical graduate.
And so these pathways have
kind of split now
because
as we are looking for
practitioners in every
state because it's such an
access and a need
problem. People
are saying, why aren't we
allowing somebody who
has practiced safely
from Mexico,
who's been a surgeon for
10 years and never had an
issue. Why aren't we allowing
them to come to
the US and practice?
Why are we making them go
through the step of being
a resident of doing an
internship with five years
of residency? Uh
Why are we doing this?
And so these,
these alternate
pathways that, that
are that people are looking
at, they're kind of these different
ideas that are coming out. So the
nomenclature has changed.
>> But the the graduates
of foreign
medical school, the internationally
trained
medical graduates
who have not been licensed as
a physician yet, they
would even
under Washington Law, they would
still have to go through a residency
program. >> Mr Chair
members of the committee, I am not
sure but
what it it on
the, when I looked at the law,
it had kind of two
pathways and it
said you could as an
img you
could go through a
residency program or
you could apply in this
path. But my
understanding, looking at
that, I have to look at the little
fine points was that
they wanted somebody that
had already
some clinical experience.
And, and the goal was to give
more clinical experience
under a
trained physician
in Washington that
could say yes,
things are great or
oh no, you need more
training.
>> Ok. Very good. We have
committee members who are already
requesting. So we have
a senator. We'll start with
Senator Sio Lopez and then
Representative Jones.
Ok, let me make a list
here.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and thank you for the presentation.
It was, it was really
good and, and of
course, especially the, the
compact is something
that could expand care.
And so I'm, I'm definitely
supportive and it'll be
good to try to move that
forward.
But I have another concern
about a rule that was
passed by,
by you all.
Um, that seems to really
limit, um, care
and that's the telemedicine
rules that you did.
Apparently we're an
outlier
and well, and
I'll just ask you some questions and, and
see. So the
rules, the rule change
was passed, I guess in
2022.
And it
doesn't allow for
second opinions
by telemedicine,
um, in this,
in this state.
And so my, I have a
constituent who was
denied, um,
at UCL A
and Deni because they
said
of telemedicine
visits, visits
cannot be done at
all for patients in New Mexico
without an established care.
So this is somebody
with
AAA
A health problem that
cannot be addressed in New
Mexico, that
equipment does not exist.
She's already been told that
and yet she doesn't
even, she doesn't
have the resources
nor does she have
the money. I mean, she doesn't
have the money but also
the physical health
to travel
all the way to
the places she's been
denied. And we
told her it's because of New Mexico
rules, which are an
outlier. And so could you
tell me why
uh these rules are,
are, were passed?
What was the rationale? Because it
definitely limits care
and in this case is threatening
her life.
>> Yes, Mr Chair members of the
committee, Senator Lopez.
Thank you. The,
so what I can, I don't
have the rule in front of me,
but I can explain to
you that
the reason
that those
rules are in place
are because
we, we do
offer a telemedicine
license and
we require
anyone who is
giving care to
a patient in New
Mexico be
licensed in New
Mexico
because if that
person is not
licensed
and does not
provide good
care
or is
provide
a some
incompetent
care,
they would be number
one practicing without a
license in New
Mexico
and there would also
be no
legal
recourse for
us as a regulatory
board
to
act on
the, the care that they
gave.
>> This is um
to me this is really
shocking because
New Mexico is
apparently the only state
that does that and especially
uh during the whole COVID
period, the rules around
the country were
changed. And
um not, I
mean,
even if there's no
exception for
a second opinion,
there's no exception for
clinic, I mean, UCL
A is not appropriate
to get a second opinion because
the question is whether
somebody we
a if we don't have
the facility or, or
the medic, the,
the,
the knowledge in our
state or in this
case, the technical
capacity
to address this
particular issue,
how are they going to find
somebody else in another
state except by
traveling there and then
maybe finding out that that's not
appropriate. I,
I want to
share with you that I'm
working on legislation that would
reverse that, that
result. I
think it was shocking.
I'm not even sure it's
within,
you know, no, I guess nobody appealed
it when it passed, but
I'm not even sure that
closing the door like this is
consistent with the Tele
Telemedicine Act and
the purpose of expanding
health care. The purpose
of the act was to expand
health care in New
Mexico and this slams the
door shut. Um
So I'm, I'm really concerned
about it. Um
And I, you know, if you want to
talk with me out offline,
I'd be happy to,
but I am going to
introduce legislation that would reserve
uh reverse this rule
result and put us in line
with the rest of the country.
Um It's, it was shocking to me
to find that out and I'm very
concerned that patients right
now are suffering
because of this rule.
>> Yes, Mr Chair and
members of the committee, Senator
Sil Lopez,
I, I would
be happy to work
with you on that. I do know
that during the
COVID
um
emergency, we did
loosen some of those
regulations.
Um But I, I
would like to review that with
you because
I do not
believe that you can practice
any kind of medicine
in any state without a
license in that
state. And
so, for example,
if I was
to practice
telemedicine
by giving advice to
a pediatric patient
in Texas,
I would be practicing
without a license
in Texas.
And um so >> we
we establishing
a medical relationship.
She would, you know,
the patients in New Mexico right
now have to travel,
to establish a an
initial relationship.
The person
like we could design a
rule to talk about second
opinions, initial
contacts and what's
particularly galling is
our physicians in New Mexico
can do this, but
a physician just in Texas
cannot for our
patients. So
it just seems like a rule that
slams the door shut
on needed medical
care, especially
in a state that that
has a shortage of physicians,
especially specialist.
So yes, I'm happy to
work with you, but I am going
to try to reserve to reverse
that result. Um
It, you know,
honestly, um
I was shocked that you did that
and I was also shocked
to find out how out
of line we are with the
rest of the States and we were
identified it in
this
publication by UCL
A as the only state
in which they cannot do this
and cannot provide a
second opinion. That's an
embarrassment.
So, um anyway,
I, I'm happy to work
with you. Doctor
Doctor Quintana.
I'm happy to work with you,
but my goal is
to reverse that result
and, and like I said,
nobody appealed the rule when it was
passed. I'm not even sure it's
consistent with the intent
of the act. Thank
you. >> Thank you, Senator
Representative Jones. You're
next. You have a question.
>> Yes. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you for your presentation.
Very interesting.
Um, a lot
happening,
you know, our priority is
legislative health and
human services committee in
the interim is, well, we
have three priorities. The first one
is healthcare workforce
and, you know, we're desperately
in need of
um expanding
healthcare workforce.
Um So
not too long ago, we,
we passed legislation that would allow
nurse practitioners to
practice uh with
autonomy
and that being a need,
especially in rural areas.
Would you be supportive
of expanding?
Um Well,
of looking at
legislation that would allow
for physicians
assistance to practice
with more
autonomy.
>> Mr Chair members of the committee,
Representative Jones,
we do
allow um physician
assistants to practice with
autonomy,
but they do have
to go through
a series of steps.
Um
And
I don't want to
misquote, but
maybe MS Quintana
I think they have to
practice for. Is it three
years, three
years under a physician
supervisor and have
taken their, uh, P
A licensure test and then
they are allowed to
practice autonomously.
Um, I, we
do have a P A member
on the board who is our
representative, um,
from the P A Association.
And, uh,
that would be P A Kathy
Johnson. And
I can definitely have
you discuss that with,
with her. That
was something that the
board acted on
07
or eight years ago. And
um that was approved
with all of the pas they felt
that was a good way as a
pathway to
training and licensure
for uh
being able to practice on their
own. >> Thank
you. Thank you, Mr Chair. So, has
there, has there been any
conversation with,
with MS Johnson
about doing
that for so that, you know, we
would have greater access to care in rural
areas?
>> Mr Chair members of the committee I
am and, and Representative
Jones, I have not heard
a concern
about that
being a barrier
to, to
um the pas,
but I can bring it
up and, and find out.
Yes, ma'am. >> Would
you be uh, I
know, I know when
we, when we finally passed
legislation to
allow nurse practitioners to
practice with
autonomy, it was already
happening. And I think
a a lot of this is already
happening with the PAS as
well. I know
in our, our, our rural
settings were so
desperate for
physicians that
I, I think
um
maybe even a situation
where A P A
can practice with another P A
who's been well established
and has been practicing for
many years.
Um, you know,
with
meeting all the criteria
that, you know, would be
necessary.
Um, perhaps that
would allow
more, more
access to care
in a rural setting. I
think there are probably several ways that
we could look at making changes
that would just make
those mid-level people,
um, more available
to our patients because I, I
know for sure that there
are, there's just
such a need in, in our
rural areas, for instance,
in my district in
Lordsburg, you know, we do have
several pas practicing
there. And,
uh, is it true,
um, that they, they
are all practicing
under one
physician?
And I, and I wonder what would
happen if that physician
left the state
or, um,
if that physician for some reason
stopped practicing, we would
have basically
have no care. No, no
physician's assistant in
Lordsburg, which is,
that is the only care
available there. So,
do you have any thoughts about
that? >> Um,
Mr Chair Representative,
uh Jones II,
I would like to look
at that and maybe
see why they, if,
if they've been practicing a while, why
they haven't applied to
practice
autonomously. Um
And also I
do think that
having a, some
kind of oversight is
still a, a good idea,
but maybe trying
to make it
easier, especially in
those rural areas where there may
not be a physician
um one idea that
we had on the board was
perhaps the use of the
Echo program for
both the
um practitioner
and the preceptor
or mentor where
there could be regular
evaluations through
um regular meetings
that way. Um
We know that the school of
medicine is
very, is,
is, you
know, also the
access issue and, and
we don't have a lot of preceptors
that way. And so trying
to find a way to make it easier
for everyone
to practice safely
is what,
what our goal is, I
think just like yours.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair. And,
and so are you saying that that
after a certain number of our
clinical hours that
a physician's assistant
can apply to practice
autonomously,
>> Mr Chair. >> Ok.
I guess there's some things I don't
really understand about that, but I,
I think there's a way to improve
that so that we can
improve access to care
in rural areas. But thank
you so much for your answers. Appreciate
it. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Jones,
Senator Tallman and
he'll be followed by
Representative
Lord.
>> Thank you. Thank you Mr
Chair. Thank you panel for being here.
Thank you for your
professional and comprehensive
report. Two quick questions.
So accept
short answers
out of the,
you said you had 408
complaints. What's the most common
complaint you
get
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee, the most common
complaint we get
um from the
public is quality
of care and
patient interaction.
>> I thank you for that answer. And
second on
page
seven,
he said you for fiscal
year 2324 you have
408
complaints
and 15 were went to
investigation.
I know those 15
7
we
uh
um retain their license.
Three are still planning
it and five
were not licensed. So that's
roughly 1.2%
for one out of 100 complaints
resulting in the loss
of a license.
How is that compared with other
states? Are we below
or above
in the amount of doctors,
number of doctors that lose their
license?
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee,
New Mexico
is quite, this is
applicants again
um that we're speaking of. So
five were not licensed in fy
24. That's,
that's typically low
compared to other
states.
Um There are
many state medical boards
in the country that
are much stricter
than we are and will
not license for
minor issues
like
misrepresentation on
an application.
So, um
we're quite low compared to
other states as far as applicants
being denied
uh compared to other
states.
>> Well, thank you for that answer.
And
Mister Chair, do you, do you, do
you find that a
concern
that were below
low
compared to other
states?
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
Senator Talmon?
I, I
think that
um
our goal is
always to
have a, a physician practice
practicing safely or
any licensee practicing
safely. And I think what
we really try and do
is bring a
practitioner in
and I know that
we really use our monitoring
programs so
that we might, you, we
might have a physician or a
practitioner that
there might be concerns
about, but we're very
careful that we use
our monitoring programs
to make sure that they are
practicing safely.
We might bring them into the
board um
to discuss
every few months how
things are going.
And that's always
been the goal, especially
these last few years
is not to
deny licensure
if we believe that they
can practice safely in our
state.
>> Well, thank you for that answer
again. Thank you for being here. That's all I
have. Mister
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator
Representative Lord
will be followed by Senator
Stefanik.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair, uh
high experts. Uh
So my question is on
the Interstate
Medical licensure compact.
I was trying to do some research on the
actual website.
So it looks like looks like
at one point, somebody introduced
something that didn't go anywhere,
but I do have questions about
this. So I was trying
to read as much as I can. So they have to be
licensed in the state where they live.
They have to be go through all the
things like any other normal doctor
would do. So this is almost like
reciprocity if I'm kind
of understanding that correctly.
So
we don't have that. So then would
there be a board here
that would also investigate
to double check to make sure they went to
accreted college? Don't have any
issues, don't um
they're not under investigation
or is it just up to that
Interstate Compact? How does that
work here in New Mexico?
>> So, Mr chair members
of the committee representative
Lord, the way that this
works is that
the applic the
physician because it is only
for physicians
places their application
to the IMLC
and they pay a $700
fee. The
IMLC is the
one that has all of the
application information
and the
applicant has to
have a state of primary
licensure. There are some
states that won't be states of
primary licensure. I think there's
three states that
won't, won't do
that. You
have a say a state of
primary licenser,
Missouri
and
that is your primary
license state. That's,
and that is the state that
says that we
have, we have, we
have this applicant
that has passed, that
has a fully vetted state
license
when you apply
to another state
for licensure.
Um Texas,
the applica
the applicant is
given a letter from
the compact and from
the state of primary licensure
that says this applicant
is in good standing
and there are
no issues with this
applicant. And so
the license is issued
nearly immediately instead
of having to go through the
review
of
the of
like say our
applicant
process and
our entire agency.
>> Ok. Thank you. That thank you, Mr
That was the point I was trying to get to
is they're doing the betting.
They're saying they're in good
standing.
Is that updated in the
compact? Like for instance,
somebody had a license for 10
years and they decide to do this
later, are they or
are they who's rechecking
to make sure that there's no
issues when they're, when they're sending
the letter that they're in good standing. Is
there another check, >> Mr
chair members of the committee and Representative
Lord, the,
the state of primary
licensure keeps
that license
active. And so you would have
to follow those renewal
procedures. So generally
that's every three years,
your license is renewed
in that state of primary
licensure and
then through the compact, it would
be renewed in the other
states that you have licensure.
>> Ok. So Mr Chair and expert,
so are they doing
the same steps of somebody who would
be applying here? Like any
fees? Do they, is there any
testing or anything or they just
immediately get that the reciprocity
licensure?
>> Mr Chair member of the committee,
Stephany Lord. Um They
are not
required to do,
I, I believe
yes, I'm almost certain that they, they still
have to pay the state fee for
each license in the
state that they are applying
to. Um,
they do have to,
if, if there is a
test for licensure
in that state
that is required to
have licensure in the state,
they are replying applying
to, they still may have to take
that test.
So, um
the there still may be steps
that they have to do additionally
if they are applying to a different
state. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. Those come my question. I want to make sure
that they're not just getting this
and then that gives them carte blanche to go to
every single state and get, they still have
to follow the rules of each state.
So that also goes with malpractice,
correct. They have to buy malpractice
in every single state.
Ok. So
going,
so the, I
guess the
for the doctor to be applying
is that it's more streamlined, I
guess, is that the end result, it's
more streamlined for them. It's easier. So
they have to go to each state and apply and
get the packets this
interstate compact kind of, does that
work? Is that correct, >> Mr
Chair members of the committee? Yes, that
it's a, it's a more streamlined
and, um,
the
application is just a, a
faster and easier
process. Ok.
>> Thank you. Uh The, the reason I
was asking all those questions is
because when I look at
this, I want to do some more research, like
there's only
123455
states that don't have this. So
it's kind of interesting that we're one of the states
that doesn't have this. So,
going back to the
question that the Senator
Cil Lopez had asked early.
So, can you explain to me when
somebody goes in for
telemedicine,
they have to go in the
first time to
meet them first before they can get the
telemedicine. Because now
if we're doing this,
that if we sign
up for this interstate
compact, that kind
of takes that second opinion
out because now that's
non applicable because
this person's already in the
system, they are living in Missouri,
but that's my, my, my
doctor. So that
override what we
were what she was talking about earlier,
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
and Representative Lord, a
telemedicine license
is a
different kind of license
where you are allowed to practice
telemedicine in the State of
New Mexico.
You do not have
to live in the state
of New Mexico to
practice
telemedicine. You have to
establish care with a
patient, but that may
be through a
telemedicine visit.
So if you are
a psychiatrist in Missouri
and you have a telemedicine
license in New
Mexico,
you can establish
a telemedicine
visit, a video visit, a
zoom phone
with a patient
and you can provide care
to that patient.
>> OK. So
going back to the Senator's
question. So now,
OK, now that's totally different.
So now I have somebody's telemedicine
license.
Ok. I'm gonna have to ask you afterwards
because I need to know how
that works and what the regulations
are like. I'm fine with the interstate
compact, but now I don't know
what the telemedicine licenser
looks like. So
somebody's in Missouri, they
psychiatrist,
I decide I want to make an appointment
with them. They're going to be
out of network. My
insurance is going to pay
that.
But if I wanted to get a second
opinion with another doctor in
Oklahoma, I can't do
that the way the law, the
way it's written right now.
>> Uh Mr Chair and
members of the committee representative
floor. Uh again,
you the, I
think the issue
is is that
you have to be
licensed
in the state just in, in
every state. You have
to be licensed to
practice
in that state.
I don't know the telemedicine
laws of other states.
But if
you are,
but what we and it's
ours is very cheap. It's
$100
to prac to have a
telemedicine license in
our state. And
so the rule is
that you
need the license
to care for the
patient.
You have to establish
a interaction.
So we don't
want to have
a um
where it's like a chatbox
kind of thing. We want
a true patient to patient
interaction. So it
can't be a, you know, this,
these are my symptoms, click,
click, click and
then you you never interact.
Are you talking about a video?
Yeah, we're, we're talking about a video
or a phone
interaction. So
that establishes the
care
and then you're allowed
to practice. Our, our
concern is
if a
practitioner
does not have a license
to practice medicine
in the state and
they provide poor
care, we
have no
way of
helping that patient.
If um
if the psychiatrist
is, you know,
um inebriated
during the telemedicine
visit, which is something that has
we've seen.
Um
And that
person is
providing very poor care to
the patient. When a complaint comes
to us, we will
not be able to act. They are not
our licensee, we
cannot act. >> Ok.
So that, that leads to another
question, Mr Chair. I'm sorry, I'm going
to try to wrap this up, but
>> it's good because this is
a topic that I think everybody was
curious about. So pursue it,
please. >> Thank you.
So I'm kind of going through
my schematic in my head.
So somebody applies
for the
tele
telemedicine licenser.
That's $100
do they or do they not
have to be licensed in this
state for
that?
>> Mr Chair members of the committee,
they have to have a tele they
apply for the telemedicine
license. They don't have
to, it's, it's a diff
it's still license
through a board, but it's called a
telemedicine license.
It's not the
same
as the license
where they are
in the State of
New Mexico
practicing in a clinic or
a hospital.
>> So, you would really,
so you would really have no
oversight. The telemedicine
board would have no oversight over them. Correct.
Because if they're in Missouri, they're
not licensed here, but they paid
$100 and now they're doing
telemedicine. You.
This is a huge problem.
I'm sorry, this is a
ginormous problem
because they should have
to be licensed in this state to
get the tle
because
again, although as
fun as it would be to have
an inebriated
therapist
or maybe they're doing ayahuasca
at the time. I don't know, but I
think maybe we should
have some more
regulations because it seems a
little bit like the wild west
of, I get somebody applies
or not from here. We
have no,
we have no jurisdiction over
them and then becomes a problem with
the second visit because then
they could go see some in Oklahoma
who also is not the right person.
We have a problem with the whole tele
Mr >> chair members of the committee
representative Lord, I don't want to interrupt you,
but we do have that's why we
have the telemedicine license
that gives us our
jurisdiction,
>> right? But I think Mr
Speaker, I think they should have to be licensed
in the state of New Mexico.
Ok. So they're not licensed the
state. I think that's
something we need to work on because
we, I don't know if we necessarily
want to send our people
to get the telemedicine from
people that are not licensed
here. So OK, that kind of
concluded my questions. Thank
you >> or we could
pass the compact.
>> Yes, I like the compact
quite a bit and that includes the
telemedicine inside of
that. And then that takes care of
everything
>> Senator Stefani
followed by Representative
Chavez and,
and, and I would just mention
we are already way over time,
but this is a
crucial issue and we,
we, we will simply
skip lunch.
Ok.
>> Thank you, Mister chair and thank
you for the presentation. I'm I'm
sorry, I came in late.
I see in your handout that
you had issued
72 expedited
licenses under
the 30 day statute
in 2023.
And my question is, were there
more that weren't
considered? That's
one question. The other one
is, has the
board recently
discussed
the
policy of
any willing provider
um in our health
care systems around the state
and I'll wait for your
answers.
>> Mm Mr
Chair,
Mr chair members of the
committee. Yes,
we have issued 72
expedited licenses
um Since the role
went into effect in November of
2023.
Off the top of my head, I don't
recall any that were
not issued under the
30 days. We do
require a completed application
and background check prior to
any licenses
issued,
but I do think that that's a
really good number considering
uh such a new rule
for us
and I will pass
it to you for the second
>> question, Mr Chair members
of the committee and Senator
Stefani. Uh I,
are you referring for
any willing provider to like
emergency
care
treatment?
>> Not necessarily as,
as we all talk
about here, health care
access and health care
coverage is
dire around the
state. And if we have
some physicians that are of
some specialties
that aren't affiliated
with the health care system that
could assist people
in our state, but they're
denied privileges
somewhere.
Um That's
my issue when we
talk about any willing provider,
it used to be under the Medicaid
Medicare rules.
But now we're really talking
about the dearth of health care
providers in the state.
And I'm very
interested in
whether or not we need to
do something to
advance
further coverage
for our citizens
or our residents. Not,
not just citizens.
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
and Senator Stefanik. I
do not
um know
about that
kind of program
because we
only give, we
regulate the licensure
process. We really
don't have anything to do with
privileging
um or
um any of those other
processes through clinics
or hospitals?
>> Thank you very
much.
>> Thank you, Senator Stefani,
Representative Chavez, followed by
Representative Ferrari.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I just have
a couple of questions and one of the
things that I'm particularly interested
in is your slide
on page 13
that speaks to additional
pathways to
licensure.
Um Do you
have any excuse
me um data
on how many
in each of those categories
are um
currently
um for lack of a
better word enrolled
in either um
pathway.
>> Mr chair members of the Committee,
Representative Chavez,
I, I don't
have any
um numbers. Are, are
you speaking regarding the
Washington State
License or just in general
>> um in New Mexico
or any or any
um folks who have been
trained um as
an international medical graduate
or a foreign trained position. Are
any of them pursuing either of these
pathways in New
Mexico?
>> Um
Mr Chair members
of the committee, we the
the pathways are not
yet established.
So, so
right now, they have to just follow
our regular licensing
process. What
we're trying, what we want to do is
establish these pathways so
that they're able to come
in and we can,
we can facilitate it.
>> Ok. Do you have an idea of
how, what the numbers look like?
>> And I Mr chair members
of the committee, I'm so sorry, I don't have those
with me, but we can get
back to the office and run some numbers
for you and I can send
you an email. >> That would be great. The
reason that I'm asking is that
I hear
that we have
several doctors
who have been trained and practiced
uh from Cuba in
the Albuquerque area.
And if we,
you know, if it comes
to pass that we're able to do
this, then I think that that would
greatly enhance
um care in
Bernalillo County and probably other parts of the
state, especially since these folks
are Spanish speaking
bilingual, you
know, um and
they um can definitely
relate to, to
our, our um patient
population here in New Mexico.
So that's something that I think
is would help us in
terms of um increasing
the numbers of doctors
that we have. So then my
other question is um
once this gets passed,
um how
would you envision
reaching out to
those communities,
particularly, particularly
doctors who are already
here have gone
through school, have practiced.
What, what kind of
outreach do you envision
doing to let them know that this
is
possible.
>> Mr Chair members of the committee,
I have um have not
thought, thought that
far. Um We,
I, we would probably start
with U and M, go to U and M
and, and get the word out
through, through
them.
Um
I, I haven't thought about
it. >> I'm sorry for springing
that on you. I think probably, you
know, reaching out to the communities
themselves to the Latino
Chicano community and
basically, they would probably have a better
hold um handle
on it than, than maybe UN
M OK. Thank you,
Mr Chair. That's all I have.
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative Ferrari, followed
by Representative Herndon.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you panel. Um
Some of my concerns are
about the medical board members.
Why there's four
vacancies.
Um Does the governor
appoint um
or do we need to ask or is
it your responsibility to make
recommendations and ask the
governor for
um uh filling
those positions?
>> Mr Chair, representative
members of the committee, Representative
Ferrari. We um
the, the
New Mexico Medical Society
presents names to the governor
for appointment
to the board. And
what has happened is we've had
some um
board members go
off and, and
termed. So we
have some vacancies now.
Um I have heard that the
governor has appointed a
public member. I'm not sure
yet who that is
and um the Medical
Society has given her
names to
um hopefully appoint
so that we will have more
members. So we are, we
are waiting on those appointments.
>> Ok. And um I
noticed that Northern
New Mexico from
Albuquerque,
well, including
Roswell
yourself,
um, Doctor
Carson.
Um
is there an attempt to
get other members
from Southern New
Mexico?
>> Mr Chair members of the board
Representative Ferrari,
I have asked that
we um
receive
rural providers
and also
practicing providers
um on the board. But it's a,
it's a very
difficult position
and it does take, it's,
it's a volunteer position
that takes a lot of time
and so it can be
very hard for
some of these practitioners to
have to travel for board
meetings and
to leave their practices.
But I am hopeful
that we will have some more
representation from
further areas of the state
on our, on our board
soon. >> Uh Thank you, Mr
Chair and Doctor Carson.
Um Do you have
incentives for people
like, you know, giving them
per diem and maybe
some time they do get
that? Ok,
great. Um
Also
um is there a
tendency or do you
have members who
are affiliated
with hospitals such as
on their hospital
boards? Are they trying
to take
over
um or be included in
the medical board?
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee and Representative
Ferrari, I,
we've had um
usually the,
the membership on the board, the
the practitioners
are generally of
leaders in their community. And
so what I can tell you is
that um I
was the chief of staff for
many years on our
hospital
in Roswell
before coming into the
board. So I think it's
just something that is a
progression,
but I haven't seen
any kind of
maybe like an
agenda or anything from
um people who are on a
hospital board that are
applying to the medical
board. Um We are not
really a um
um I
guess what people would
consider super prestigious
to be on the board. It's a working
board, it's a regulatory
board. And so
this isn't something that kind
of pads your resume.
Um It's, it's
a hard working board.
>> Ok. Thank you
for that. Um
And
also,
um, when
you get complaints,
um I think that was on
uh slide 13,
you know, uh conduct,
you know, um
being
one of the things that are or
competency
evaluations.
Um Do you
get many
from hospital
boards themselves,
you know, trying to
um
eliminate a
physician.
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee, Representative
Ferrari,
we do um
hospitals are required to
report
um to
the board if they have taken
adverse action
um on a physician's clinical
privileges. And so we do
get quite a few
reports from
hospitals um
on
physicians.
>> And so if
you, um, you
know, you mentioned that there's
still three pending
and
um
five that are not
licensed due to
different um
complaints.
Are there,
is there an appeal
process or some protection
for the um you
know,
uh physician
or assistants or whoever it
is, the license
is in jeopardy?
>> Mr chair members of the
committee Representative
Ferrari? Yes,
there is a, there is a pathway
for these physicians
to
um
remediate their skills.
And so there are, there
are several
um clinics
throughout the United States. The
closest one is in
Denver C
PEP. The Center for
personalized education
for professionals
where they will
take a physician
and um
assess their clinical
skills and
provide a report to that
physician and to the board
and to the hospital where they
work and let them
know what kind of
remediated remediation
they need to
take in order to
safely practice.
And so that does not
always end up in lia
action. The board does not take
lia action against those
physicians. They're very
much willing to work with those
physicians and get them
uh to practice
safely. Um
There's a program in, in
Texas called Ktar,
they do the same thing.
>> So there is
a
yeah,
kind of a remediation
but is there
a process to,
you know, appeal the actions
that are, you know,
accusations I should
say against
them, Mr Chair?
Thank you,
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee and Representative
Ferrari. Um
you know, they, they're really,
we the board works with
them before
any sort of action is
taken against them.
If the board does
take action against them,
there is a
whole
legal process where
they can appeal
the board's
decision.
>> Ok. Um Thank
you, Mr Chair. Um Just
one more. Um You
also oversee the
veterinarian board.
Is that correct?
No, ok. They're
separate and
when we have Mr Chair,
when we have questions about
um expanding the
pharmacists scope
of work, you do
oversee or make approval
of that yet,
whether or not to do that. Is
that correct,
>> Mr Chair, members of the committee?
Yes, we will
review their
protocols and
so um they
will bring their protocols
to us and then
review, we review
those and give
approval.
>> Ok. Um Thank you
Mr Chair and doctor Carson.
Does that mean
um if we
wanted to pass a bill to expand
that scope of work,
um those
um pharmacists would uh
groups would have to work
with you and is
that something that you've done
recently so that we can
do that, >> Mr
Chair, members of the committee represented
Ferrari? Yes, we are actually
working right now with
the pharmacists. They've presented
a protocol to us that
we felt wasn't a safe
protocol and we've asked them
to go back
and, and revisit
that and then come to us
again to have
something that would be
safer for practice.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, Doctor Parson and panel.
>> Thank you, Representative Representative
Hernan to be followed by
Senator Sio Lopez for
the second time.
>> So I forgot my
home.
Thank you, Mr Chair and thank you
presenters. So
I am really impressed
that you've given us this
strategic plan,
so to speak about how
to grow the
number of physicians that are in our
state coup.
My questions are gonna center around
those and there are only three Mr
Chair. So I'll be very
efficient. So one
is with respect to the
IMG and the
FTP program.
I thought I heard you say
that if those, if individuals
come into that program, you did
want them to go through a residency,
for example, and then be
under the auspices of
a uh I mean of
a practicing position,
physician
position,
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
Representative Herndon. Uh
so the the
img the
that is just a
somebody who just graduated
from medical school,
that person should
go through a residency
program that would
be their pathway
and they should apply
to a US residency program
or a residency program
in their country. But they need to
go through a
training program.
First,
the foreign trained
physician is who
we're very interested
in because we
think that's the
type of
clinician that we can
bring in to New
Mexico that
we would be comfortable
with practicing
safely in,
in our state.
The the
international medical
graduate only graduated
from medical school, they've never
practiced. And
so coming from medical
school, going right
into practice in a rural
area with no help
we feel would be very dangerous.
Um But a
foreign train, me, foreign
trained practitioner
has practiced
already has
some experience
and
again, with
those guardrails
in place some oversight,
somehow we need to,
that's, that's always
the, the details or the
issue. Um
We, we think that would
be a good
alternative pathway
to licensure. >> Uh
Thank you. Thank
you, Doctor Carson. Uh The only
reason I was asking that question,
I was really concerned about the
number of residencies that we
have in the state in, in this
country already. And then
how would we go about expanding
them because that's what we would need to
do. And uh I have
been in contact with far too
many students who have
graduated from medical schools
here and are still waiting
on their residency programs.
So thank you for that
clarification.
And one of the
other aspects is with
respect to uh
the plan that you
presented. What I
didn't hear was how would
you grow uh
or help to grow
people who are going into the medical
fields. Anyway, I
hope the medical board is looking
at that. And so maybe you could tell
me I know that you and them being
one of the primary medical schools
having one of the primary medical schools
here does have several
programs and how do you
all work with
them or fit in with those
programs?
>> So, Mr Chair
members of the committee Representative
Hernan, I, I did
meet with Doctor Mike
Richards with UN
M um a few weeks ago
to discuss how the
medical board
can help
with
younger
um younger people
who are looking
at medicine and
trying to find
pathways that
hopefully can
interest them in medicine.
And also
trying to figure out
how we can
have
preceptors
and mentors
for the
students, even high
school students, but
also medical students
and residents that
are needed. So
that as, as we move
forward, um
we can grow that
population and,
and again, it's, it's just
something where everybody has to work
together and I don't
have any concrete
um ideas
from that meeting, but
we, we do have some other
meetings planned. So hopefully
we'll come, we'll come up with
something. >> Thank you, Doctor
Carson. Thank you, Mr Chair.
One program I would like for you
to consider is communities
to careers program at the
University of New Mexico,
run by Doctor
Valerie Leggett
Romero. And so that is
one pathway to get many
students involved as well
as um getting
them into a programs that
will allow them to practice
as candy stripers or
other things. So I share
that with you and then there's one last
uh item um
Dr Carson and members of
this panel as
four wonderful,
incredibly
credible women on this
program. There is one
problem that is
currently faced by
young women who are
in high school and
they decide to have a
child before
going into college.
And so if they want to go to medical
school, despite the fact that
they um
scored extremely
high on their
um MC A
TS are they scored
very high on their
um achievements in
school. They are
prevented from going into the
B A MD program.
So I am
asking you to make
that an item
that the medical board is
looking at because we need
to give every person
who otherwise qualifies
the opportunity to go to medical
school. Thank you, Mr
Chair and thank
you,
team
>> wrong button. Thank you,
Representative and Senator
Sil Lopez for the second time.
>> Thank you. I appreciate this
opportunity. I wanted to
clarify. I did
not mean that
anybody would practice in
New Mexico at any
time through
telemedicine. I
want to read to you what
UCL A
is. It's in their
brochure. It's not even just
like a personal letter to a
patient. Generally
acceptable video
visits,
video visits with new patients
in order to determine if they
should travel to UCL A
health for care
may be done.
Um if providing any
sort of medical advice, a
provider in the state in
which the patient is located
should also be on
the video and the
visit should be documented as a
physician to visit
physician consult.
And then second, if the patient is
seen without an in-state provider,
the provider should be careful
not to provide any medical
advice specific to the patient.
It should be limited to general
descriptions of treatment
and a confirmation that coming
to UCL A health could
benefit the patient.
Then it says, and so those
things like good guardrails,
right, that satisfied
every other requirement
of the state. But the next
line, it says video
visits cannot be done
at all for patients in
New Mexico.
That's why I mean we're an
outlier because
we don't have any kind of
exception. And
that's, it's not just UCL A
who's printing this material
because of that rule. And
that's, that's what I want to
reserve. Not
everybody just coming
in
guardrails, legitimate
guardrails, but not an absolute
prohibition, especially
for second opinions.
Thank you, Mr Chair I appreciate
the opportunity to >> clarify
senator members of the
committee. Senator Lopez
Lopez that is
allowed. I'm
maybe their
artificial intelligence that
printed their, their pamphlet
is wrong. But, uh,
>> Mr chair members of the committee,
there is physicians
are able to consult
with other physicians who don't have
licenses in the state.
So the second opinion
is not, we don't have
that, but we do
of the, our statute and our
rules allow for physicians to
consult with other physicians
outside of the state. >> Well,
the rules are being interpreted
because she, she tried other
clinics other than UCL A.
So around the country,
people believe that they cannot
provide a second
opinion in New Mexico.
So some
clarification of
your rules should be made.
I just offer
that. But I do
intend to also
introduce a bill that that would
provide guardrails.
I mean, not to open, not
to reverse everything
but to, to
make it clear that this is
allowed.
Thank you, Mister chair. I
appreciate that. Thank >> you very
much. And this has
been a topic
that the committee has a great deal
of interest in. Thank
you for the presentation
presentation. We look
forward to working on those three matters
with
you.
They didn't bring
up the other one, you did,
the three that they brought up. We look
forward to working with you on
them and we'll,
we'll, I'm sure
have another opportunity to discuss
them as, as the actual
legislation gets distilled.
So thank you very much for
coming. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank
you.
We'll move then to the second
panel this morning, which
is the higher education
department. Uh
Doctor Patricio
Trujillo.
Um
Yeah, Doctor
Jose Eli Frescas.
Good morning. How are you? Doctor
Frescas
and Veronica Sanchez.
Um Doctor
Sanchez is the Chief
Executive Officer of
Cornerstone to Excellence
and Doctor Eli Frescos is
also related to
Cornerstone for
Excellence.
Oh, and you have others?
Multiple others.
But, but are
they all going to speak?
Ok, let's get started.
Then.
My God, I
didn't know they were all going to speak with me
there. She said that they
would be there to answer
questions.
Good morning, Doctor Trujillo. It's
good to have you with us
and we eagerly await your
presentation.
You'd have to push the button.
Ok.
>> Thank you. Uh Good
morning Mr Chair members of
the committee. My
name is Patricia Trujillo and I'm
the Deputy Cabinet Secretary
of the New Mexico Higher Education
Department. We
appreciate.
>> Oh,
could you please take your
conversations outside
the
room?
Ok.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. We
appreciate the invitation to
present on the topic of
mental and behavioral health
degrees at twoyear institutions
in New Mexico.
Thanks to your generous
appropriation, Mr Chair,
the New Mexico Higher Education
Department was able to
contract a team of
eminent researchers from
Cornerstone to excellence.
A firm known for their
service to the behavioral health
fields of New Mexico,
the co pis of this study,
Doctor Veronica Sanchez
and Doctor Eli
Fresquez. Um
both are scholars of social
work and are active members
of the New Mexico Social work
task force. I would
like to thank the faculty and
academic administrators
who took the time during the
summer session to fill out
c and to meet
for interviews with our
researchers. Their
input is invaluable
to this effort to create
behavioral health two year
programs. So
certificates and associate's
degrees that track to
the workforce directly
or seamlessly transfer
to fouryear inst uh programs
at our universities.
Uh You will receive the final
report after this committee
meeting, it awaits final
design and approvals before it
can be distributed.
The panel before us
has um uh
and pardon me, the panel before us has
direct experience in New
Mexico and neighboring
States. From the New Mexican
perspective, we will hear the results
of the programmatic surveys
and interviews from our own
twoyear institutions
and from the regional and national
perspective, we will hear
recommendations from researchers
about best practice
practices and creating vertical
alignment from two year to four
year programs. The
need for the simplification
of academic pathways
to study behavioral health
fields, cross
higher education institution
collaboration to standardize
elements of curriculum
and cultural relevancy
in content and faculty
within behavioral health departments
across New Mexico.
As we move forward, please
note that each speaker will
introduce the following
presenter. Um
And I'll note that I, I
apologize that everybody's names
are not in the agenda. Um
but uh you will get to know them
as we move through. And
with that, I will turn it over to
Doctor Veronica Sanchez, who will
tell us more about the study.
Thank you, Doctor
Sanchez.
>> Yes. Good morning.
Good morning, Mr Chair and
members of the committee. Thank you
for allowing us to be here this
morning and
for us to share this time
with you.
We are grateful for your
interest in support of
conducting research with our
higher educational
institutions to better
understand our behavioral health
educational programs
here in our beautiful
state. So what
we did is we conducted
a mixed methods explorer
study which allowed
us to really understand the
key issues and
gather preliminary data
and also identify
key variables. And
so the
programs that we were focused
on were programs that
contain behavioral health
content in them.
And so we looked at
um its certificate
and AAA degrees and
those included CERTIFICATE
and AAA A of human service
degrees, behavioral
behavioral and mental
health, community, health
worker, criminal justice,
drug and alcohol abuse
studies, and
psychiatric nursing and health
care. So those were the
areas of
study and programs
that we
looked at through
the work that we did. And
so some of the
variables are factors
that we were looking at in our
study where what the
alignment was
between the certificate
to AAA to fouryear
and beyond. And then
also the
transitions that students
have so how they
transition from
one program into the
other and then what the
process of transferring
credits were as
well as what the behavior
health content
includes within those
different programs, for
example, in criminal
justice or the
community health workers
certificate, what
level of behavioral health
content are those
students receiving?
We also looked at
work based learning and
practicum and internship
opportunities. And so
how those are made available
within those programs
as well as preparation
of the workforce.
So how the programs
prepare our students
to be out in the workforce
within those behavioral health
fields? And then
we also did look
at uh culture, uh
the culture, awareness
of faculty
and um cultural
sensitivity and awareness
within the content
areas of
uh the programs that
were under study in the
behavioral health umbrella.
Um As you all are
aware, New Mexico has
a high need for
well qualified, well-trained,
highly competent and
credential behavioral health
providers. And so
once again, we appreciate
your guys' support
and us being
able to go through
and look at um these,
these areas that were
under study. And so I
will introduce Doctor
Eli Frescas who
will be our next speaker and
go through um some
of the specifics of
what our findings were.
So, Doctor Fresques is
an expert in social work
exam preparation with
over 35 years of
experience. He
has degrees from mission again in
Michigan State University
and has chaired a
lot of different committees
including the National Social
Work Examination Committee.
He excels in delivering
preparation seminars
for licensure for social
workers, as well as
teaching and writing
in the field. He also
specializes in organizational
development, leadership
management, behavioral health
treatment systems
design and
he's uh currently an
entrepreneur and working with
the new Mexico social work task
force. So with
that,
Doctor Eli
Reques,
>> senator chairman
Artis Seino, before I
start,
I wish to thank
you.
I wish to thank you for the force.
We call, we call it the force.
We have changed it a little bit, but
it's the new Mexico task
force. We
would not be here without
you. We would not
be here presenting without
you the force
as I call, it would not
be the
force.
The membership
of what has happened on that
force is incredible.
The outcomes have been
incredible
and the overall
view of what has
happened because of
that task force. It's now in its third
year is
excellent. The people that it has
pulled is incredible.
So, thank you.
Thank you.
And I say it one more time, sir,
you have served us
well in this state of New
Mexico.
I'm also beginning to, to
hear rumblings of a
little bit of work that we're gonna be doing.
Hopefully with, with uh
representative
uh Eleanor Chavez.
Uh We
welcome, we welcome the
wisdom, we welcome the
view.
Um in
regards to social work,
I constantly
remind myself that I have
now turned 73
years old. My
whole work has
been in social work
in psychology.
I'm from a little village up
north called Penasco, New
Mexico. Even a smaller
village called Yano de San
Juan, New Mexico.
I was raised by my grandmother.
I left New Mexico right
out of high school. Never
to return until I came
back, married with
two sons.
And uh yesterday
was 52 years of
marriage to my wife.
So that may not be
part of the presentation, but that's
part of me.
Uh because
of because of the relationship that
we had with the forest, I was able
to meet
Doctor Veronica Sanchez.
And as a result of that,
we ended up working also
with an extremely
bright well,
can write. Incredibly,
a Doctor Trujillo,
a lady can write, she
can write very well. And she
asked us to look
at a research piece
and I think
Doctors Sanchez has
presented it very
well and the research piece
is to be more
in depth and more specific
was to look at the
alignment, the vertical alignment
of programmings
within the certification
programs and also the AAA
programs leading to the
four years. But we also
took it a step further. And I think
you heard the, the, the
sequence of
events in regards to our
looking, we looked at it from
the beginning of the two year
programs all the way
to the graduate programs
where I've spent most of my time
teaching in graduate
programs at
here in New Mexico. Us
C at Michigan and Michigan State
and on and
the relationship.
Meaning the steps,
the process between high
school, between the
two year programs, cer
certificate programs,
uh the um
associate programs
and then into the master's programs
and then into supervision and
internships in
regards to acquiring
licensure is
essential and
credible. We've
made incredible
headway in New Mexico
in regards to social work
practice may
not know this. But New
Mexico put
on the map, the most
powerful social work
act that the country has ever
seen mostly
because we were one of the last
states, simply because we became one
of the, we were one of the last states to
come into the, into
uh into the union.
And we were able to benefit
from an in incredible
uh incredible licensing
act and we've been able to
act on the Licensing
Act. And as a result
of that, we have seen
the progression of
movement of students
now, uh in regards
to the research, we found a number
of things and, and I need to start
with some of the most positive
things that we found.
Nursing in the state
of New Mexico is incredible.
They have an incredible
program they really
do in comparison
to, to what
to what it is that we want to
do. Um
We found some,
some locations,
Luna who is doing very
well because we not only
did a qualitative
study that is that
we interviewed folks, we
interviewed a
number of very,
very interesting and highly
quiet qualified
professionals across the state.
But we also did a lot of work
in regards to quantitative
analysis to see what
it is. The specifics were in
regards to the data that we wanted
to do. Now, we, we,
we would like to have a little bit more
data because
the more data we have obviously,
the better we, the better we're
able to answer
questions. Uh
We found, for
example, in Clovis and I don't,
I don't know where you folks come from
in regards to your representation.
But Clovis has an
incredible program into
core, core,
core curriculum
in regards to behavioral health,
they're really good at it. They're, they're
really good at what it is that they
do. So uh
as far as
being able to develop models
and looking at the movement
from like I was saying,
even high school all the way
to that level of licensure.
And I'm talking about the L CS
W, we're, we
have the models, we have the
ability to be able to do this.
One of the things that we did that we
found however, is
that we need to
continue our dialogue
in regards to behavioral health.
For example, I
found that a
lot of us don't
understand the difference, for
example, between behavioral
health and mental health,
very basic.
But behavioral health is an
apple and mental
health is a banana and they
are very
unique in regards to what
we do. So, one of the things
that we need to do that we found
from this study is to be able
to develop a language,
an organizational
system,
glossary
that we could all begin
to speak the same
language when it comes to
behavioral health. And
also to understand
what it is that behavioral
health does, what behavioral
health doesn't do and what
professions like psychology,
social work
counseling,
substance abuse
providers,
nurses do
that include behavioral
health. But quite
frankly, I'm a social
worker. I am
trained in behavioral health,
but I'm not a behavioral health
person. I'm a social
worker. That means
that I use behavioral
health as a tool to
be able to allow me to be
able to do my craft. And my craft
is that we treat the
environment, we treat the
individual in the environment
and behavior health people.
And I'm a behavioral health
personable. Also, psychologist
treats the individual and
treats the dynamics and
psychopathy or
whatever it is that we're looking at in
that individual, but
we need to expand it.
That's one of the things that was
really critical in our findings
is that we need to
operationalize
on our, our
language. For
example, if,
if Lucille, my wife
says, you know, we, we have a leak
in, in our, in our
bathroom, I say,
OK, well, what is we
need to call a plumber? Well, the plumber comes
in, have very specific
language of
how they speak to each
other physicians where
we as a
state need to
be operationalized
our language so that we know exactly
what it is that we're talking about.
Secondly, another
finding that was interesting. Now, these are preliminary
findings. We need to still look deeper
into our data
of the finding
of uniformity.
For example, we can
have a title of a
program that says
you're going to get a certificate
in, let's say home
care. And
it's a program that's being offered
in Clovis, but you have
the same title at
New Mexico State.
And the content is
completely, totally
different. We need to
be able to standardize
and
uh develop programs that are
uniform so that if I decide
that I want to move to Las Cruces,
that I can follow the
same program in Las
Cruces.
Another piece, another
finding is
that
uh
for the most
part,
this
was uniform within
the uh the, the people
that we interviewed is that we
need to be able to
acquire
and retain
faculty.
We have a lot of
faculty that are adjunct
faculty and
sometimes the program is
based on one
person. And if that
one person leaves, then
that one person takes
the program with them.
And we therefore
need to be able to do that.
And I'm gonna touch just a little
bit on another finding that we
found and it was
pretty well across the board
that the professors wanted,
that we spoke with, wanted.
And that was to be able to start
looking at the unique history of
New Mexico, the
unique history of where we're
at the unique history
of where we need to go
and how we can begin
to set the foundations
of not only being an
incredible state as
a state, but also
setting the vision of
how we're going to manage our
population because be
aware that New Mexico
is becoming a majority
minority state.
And because of that, we need
to start looking
at the cultural differences
and the cultural variables of
all cultures and
be inclusive of all cultures
and understand the
dynamics of how that affects
behavioral health, that how that
affects whole health.
So we're beginning to
see with this research
of what is
the nuances
that we need to pick up that we
can share with one
more piece. That's really
fascinating that we heard a lot
with with the people that
we spoke to is
collaboration,
collaboration, the
ability to be able to
talk to each other to
set up um
task forces, for
example, so that we
can communicate
and know what it is that
we need in our different
regions. Trust me,
the South region of New
Mexico is really
different than the north
region of New Mexico.
We really are, but
we're a state and we
are together.
So that
was an interesting finding.
And I think one of the most
powerful finding
was what do
uh what we've been talking about
is that New Mexico has some
really powerful strengths.
Look at our population, we're
about
2.1
million people. We have
28
institutions.
That's a blessing.
That's a blessing. We're
incredible in regards to
institutions. We
don't have a lack of institutions,
but we have a lack of
is being able to find
faculty, keep faculty,
not brain drain our kids
to another location,
but also to keep the
faculty that we bring here.
Some of the faculty that come to
this state are really, really,
really good and
we need to be able to keep
them and
hopefully
assist them in regards
to the various culture
shocks that they
may experience because we're a
unique state. We're a
beautifully unique
state.
Again, that's the global
picture of what it is
that, that we're looking at in this
research. And what it is that the
expectation was the
last piece that was
interesting is that
we asked,
how do you, how do you see, how
do you feel in regards
to your supportive
programs for your
students? And
uh it appeared
to us, of course, it was self
report, but it
appeared to us that universities
are working very hard,
very hard to
try to provide uh
services to their
students, to keep them, to keep
them in the programs, to provide
them with uh even
food. Luna, luna
has a kitchen and
I think Clovis has a kitchen
where they provide food to their
students. That is pretty
good. That is really
good. Secondly, some, some
of the faculty member were saying we need
to start looking at internships
and one of them said we need
to develop uh programs to
be able to connect up with
our hospitals, which I think
we're gonna be talking a little bit about
hopefully in, in regards to
what Colorado is doing in regards
to it, hospitals. How am I doing on time? I don't
want to waste too much time. One
minute, I got one more minute,
one more minute. I I can
do this because this is,
this is what we do.
Um
We created, we'll,
we'll give you all this. We created
a real, a really interesting
sheet as a, as a result of the
direction from Dr Trujillo
that really begins to look
at the scope
of behavioral health,
mental health, substance abuse
treatment, social work, psychology,
psychiatric nurses, substance
abuse counseling and
overall counseling that we
want to share with you. We worked on it
quite a bit and
was a piece of work that I think
is going to be very
effective. The last piece is
this the interest
in multidisciplinary
programming for
us to be able to sit
all these professions,
all these disciplines to
sit together and begin
to craft out what
the next decade is
in regards to behavioral
health and
hol holistic services
in New Mexico. Thank
you.
Um The next
speaker that I wish to
introduce and I'm gonna,
I'm gonna allow them to introduce
themselves in regards to their
specificities is
Doctor Jones.
One of the things that we've done in New
Mexico again,
uh Senator, you were our
keynote speaker in the
first, uh in the
first conference of
uh cornerstone in regards
to social work and excellence in the
social in social services
was um
a lot of discussion
about bringing in new
ideas from other states
and we bring in Doctor
Jones who just recently
has a brand new position
and is
working
very hard in the area
of alignment on what
it is that Colorado is doing in
regards to the alignment of the students.
Doctor Jones,
>> thank you, Doctor
Frescas
Mr Chair and committee
members. Thank you very much for
hearing us and
>> if you >> could just lean into the
mic, yeah, that would be, is that
better?
Ok. Um
So one of the things that
Colorado did was Governor
Polis charged the Department
of Human Services with
creating a task
force. That task
force was made up of
10 different cultures,
70 people from around
the state of Colorado and
these people all either
had lived experience or loved
ones with lived experience.
Um What they found out
through the task
force, research and
um studying time and
questioning was that
the three primary areas
to address were access to
care, timely
care and the lack of
workforce in that
order. Um
So Colorado Behavioral
Health Administration was
created House Bill
21-1097
and it works to collaborate
with agencies and people
around the state of Colorado.
We actually had boots on the
ground going place to
place and people that were
members of this administration
continue to do this work
today where they're gathering
information, collecting data
and having narratives
from people. Um
As Doctor Fresquez referred
to the qualitative end of the
research,
um they created
a roadmap in September
2020 called Care
Coordination
Infrastructure
and then Senate Bill 21
1 37.
Um they
funded to the
tune of $26 million.
The Colorado Department of Higher
Education
um with that
lack of, of
workforce
was also chiming
into the timeliness of care
and access of care. So it was
really important they felt to start
with the higher education,
higher education
in 2022 Senate
Bill 20
22-1
outlined the ways that we could work
together. And that was
the Behavioral Health Administration
with the Colorado Department
of Higher
Education. They created
a rubric to measure
credential meeting industry
standards and those
criteria or demand
evidence of skills,
employment outcomes and
stability.
The stack ability refers to
being able to take a micro credential,
turn it into a credential, turn
it into an AAA and then
eventually a Bachelor's
degree.
Um So we created
five new micro credentials.
One is addiction recovery
assistant,
two patient navigator,
three behavioral health
assistant, one which is also
called a qualified
behavioral health
assistant. And that will
be able to be bill
to Medicaid and
students in high school will be able to
take these courses um
for the QBH
A
concurrently well in high
school. So that when they're coming out,
they are already qualified and can
already start billing.
There's also a behavioral health
assistant too and a behavioral
health plus
those stack into the
associates of applied
sciences um
degrees in behavioral
health. And
there were also
career and technical
education classes created
that were, had a brand new prefix
of beh
with eight new classes.
Those educational design
um, labs
were created with, it's
called EDL. And they're a nationwide
program. They were kind of like
the project manager to
ensure that all the courses
were the same,
that students would be getting the same
information no matter which
community college they
attended. And
they worked um with
the Colorado Community
College system to make
this happen. the
university where I'm
stepping into the chair
role, um starting Monday
is Pueblo Community College
and we were the first ones to
really take advantage of this
opportunity. So we
already had all those micro
credential courses this past
fall launched. Um
And we're pretty
successful,
we are gonna
see a Aurora Community
College and Pikes Peak
State College join
with us in that this
fall.
Um Originally,
we had the addiction
pathway um
for the Associate of Applied
Sciences and two
certificates which were mental
health aid and mental health support
specialist. And these
micro credentials that I
mentioned can um
evolve into these certificates
and then into either the
original AAA degree that
we had or
the qualified um
behavioral health assistant
pathway will lead
into the A as
in behavioral health with an
emphasis in mental health and
social work.
These can be transferred
and have a streamlined process
of um working with U
CCS, which is
the University of Colorado,
Colorado Springs
um to a Bachelor's in
human Services degree
or at CS U Pueblo
to a Bachelor's in Applied Science
and Health Science Administration.
And both of those
bachelor's programs can
um lead to a pathway in a
master's
program.
I think that's all that I
have. Um
I would like to bring it back
to Doctor Eli
Frescas
to speak
on.
>> I would like to sorry
uh chairman,
I would like to introduce Doctor
Dipa. Uh There
is no way to
otherwise say
the following. Dr has
been the dean of five
major universities
across the country has
over his career. Set the
path of social work is a
pioneering social work,
understands thoroughly
social work. And
we bring Doctor Dipa
to be able to talk about
the cultural value
and the cultural sensitivity
and the cultural uniqueness
that we have in this incredible
state and its
preservation.
>> Mr Chair and
distinguished members of this panel.
Thank you for
having me
and the
rest of us are here to
present to you.
I'm the youngest uh
of this
panel here.
I'm 93 years of
age.
Oh,
and I
have spent 35
years in six
different universities across the
Southwest as
a dean and
professor
implementing and
developing curriculum
for the
training, the education,
the preparation of professional
social
workers.
And I have done
that
with the
commitment that
every student that would graduate
from those schools that I was in
charge of
would have
cultural competence
and humility
in working with the Spanish
Native Americans,
african-americans and other
ethnic
minorities
in the questionnaire used to
this uh in this
study.
And the report, it
addressed the issue of curriculum
content in what
is called the
area of cultural
awareness.
Also, items six
and seven on the certificate
degree program,
ask the questions,
how effectively
does the degree program
incorporate cultural
awareness
content
in the coursework to promote
cultural sensitivity
in the practice of behavioral
health.
And secondly,
how adequate
those degrees
program prepare
students in cultural sensitivity
for working with New Mexico
diverse
population.
I spent my last
uh professional years at Highland
University and
I was in charge of developing
and implementing the branch
here in
Albuquerque.
Um
And it's
interesting that our
report
identifies 28
institutions like Dr Fresca
syndicated.
So we
have a wealth
of institutions
uh both at the community
college level and the fouryear
level.
So we're not lacking
in institutions
to be able to
develop a personal
power
that is needed to
serve the behavioral needs
and mental health needs of
New Mexico.
Um
It should be noted,
you know that
uh
more than half
of all
adults in the
US
will experience a mental
illness
episode during their
lives,
one in 10
Children
and one in four
adults
suffer from mental
illness in the US.
Today,
New Me New Mexico is
not an exception to
that
for ethnic and racial
minorities. Their
road to treatment is frank
frequently blocked
by cultural
views
of mental illness
and therapy.
Obviously, we know that we
lack of insurance.
Uh the social stigma
and myths
related to mental illness
also
affect
accessibility and
utilization of mental
health
services.
Evidence suggests that
racial and ethnic
minorities in
the US are more likely
to underutilize
mental health services
and terminate treatment
every early
despite their continued
need for it. And this
is a report to the US Department
of Human Services.
It should be noted
that the National
Institute for Minority Health
disparities, NC
MH DH
D under
the National Institute of
Health
was recently promoted
to an
institute
and
it provides
guidelines
and recommendations
for how
in the areas of psychiatry,
social work,
psychiatric
nursing,
psychology,
how programs
can institute can
implement programs
that are cultural, culturally
sensitive
and that those
graduates
throughout the
continuum of
education
can have cultural
competence.
Now, in my
experience,
uh
it's important to
realize
that to achieve this in a state
like New Mexico, which is a
small state with
2,000,002 0.1
approximate population
and 48
institutions
that it is important
to standardize the curriculum
throughout the
institution
to ensure that the historical
and cultural experience
and attributes of the New
Mexico, Hispanic, American,
Indian, african-american
and all ethnic groups is
offered.
In my
judgment,
the curriculum
should address the values,
the beliefs, the attitudes,
the norms and
how culture
affects and
impacts how
people perceive illness,
health, seeking behaviors,
and how cultural
differences
influences treatment,
coping mechanisms
and support that
works for them
and how culture
can impact
how we understand and
cope with mental illness,
how cultural
barriers
prevent effective
mental
treatment.
Now, one of the
concerns that I
have personally
based on my
experience of 35
years in academic
settings
is that the
there is a need to uh
for us to face the
reality that
we need to
recruit and attract
and hire Hispanic
American and
african-american
uh and other ethnic
faculty in programs
and administrators in this
28
institutions
in the 1990 through
the eighties to
uh into the 20
twenties
professional associations
such as the American
Psychiatric Association,
the American Psychological
Association, and
NASW, the National
Association of Social
Workers, a
Knowledge and incorporated
in their core of ethics
requirements
for all these professionals
and other mental health
and substance abuse providers
to obtain cultural
competence in
working with ethnic
and cultural minorities.
The DS M
the the the health
disorders
uh
uh manual
that is used as sort of
the Bible, you know, and the
standard manual
for mental
health in the United
States and in many and
internationally.
When you look at the edition
DS M five, tr
2022
it says, quote,
cultural bound
syndromes
and
an outline for cultural
formulation
and concerts about the
role and importance of
cultural and
ethni ethnicity
in the diagnosis and
tral mental disorders
is
fundamental
to an effective
treatment
of our
population of
ethnic
and cultural minorities
in the
US.
In 2001,
a report from the US
Surgeon General stated
cultural factors play
critical role in mental
health. The culture
from which people
hail
affects all
aspects of mental
health and illness,
including the type of
stress they confront
likewise the
culture of clinicians and
service system
influence the nature, the
nature of mental health
services.
Uh What
I'm to
have this, what I'm
arguing for in reference
to this and what the study
reflects. Here
is that New Mexico
is in a very
unique uh
position
to be able to accomplish
this uh
purpose.
Thank
you.
>> Yeah.
Why the ch
you want to listen to your first?
OK.
Uh
We were, we're discussing whether
or not we were going to do accessibility
or licensure, we're going to
do licensure 1st,
2nd, which is the
continuum of
what it is that we
looked at in regards to this
study and what's go what
is happening in New
Mexico.
Um We had
Doctor Peterson who was from
Arizona, who is from
Arizona to come and
present in regards to
licensure and what Arizona is
doing in regards to licensure
and he was not able to, to get
here
because
>> the weather yesterday
wasn't able to get here on
time, but it is still an integral
piece of our team.
And as
um definitely gonna
continue to be part
of the work that we are doing
and we have his reports. And
so Doctor Frescas will
be presenting that
information that he
provided to us, >> right?
So I read his reports and the
original idea was what in
our first conference
when I ran into
Doctor Peterson and Doctor
Sanchez also
spoke
about what
we needed to do with
licenses. And
uh he was speaking about what we're doing in
Arizona and he presents this
program in Arizona that
is a year-long program
and uh the research
that they were doing in regards
to uh their
program
and uh I
said to, I said to
Doctor Sanchez, you know,
Arizona is really
doing an, an incredible piece.
They're looking at
their students, they're assessing
them, they're providing a, a
structured program for
them. They're re
reassessing them, they're working
with the universities, they're
collecting research, uh
uh the data
and at the same time, they're looking at
the work at the workplace.
Well, guess what
New Mexico State has been
doing that for 22
years
under the leadership of Alvin
Sali in 200
in 2000, 200 in
2000, we were
called and said, can we do
something in regards to license
here in New Mexico? And I said, Alvin,
absolutely, Alvin
supported that program
and he was then the, the dean
or the director at the New Mexico
State. He directed
that program. We created an
incredible program. It
was a yearlong
program at the New
Mexico State. And
I bet you over the
22 years
that we worked with that
program also was
directed by Dr Montoya
who is still a professor
at New Mexico State. And I think now
is a kind of an interim
dean supported
that program. And we were
able to show
in, in my opinion, we were able to
show an incredible
graduation rate
of New Mexico State
students. The
program simply started
in September, we did an
assessment. I'm moving along
here, we did an assessment that
assessment led us to what it is that
we needed to do in regards to their, their
program, we did the program,
we did another assessment
and then we
provided an
incredible two day exam
prep that we have been doing
for the last 35 years
across the country.
And we were so my
point is this, I
wanted Doctor
Peterson to show what it is
that Arizona is doing. But
remember this when it comes
to social work in New Mexico,
New Mexico leads
the nation in many, many
ways. And here's an example.
We need to keep that
program going. We need to
keep the program going to highlands
at western, at
Eastern because we
have really good professors
there, really good directors
there and a lot of leadership
and we need to be able to move it.
So we're not any different.
And in fact, I think that New
Mexico is just a tad
more when it comes to
social work and behavioral
health in regards to
licensure. >> Thank
you. So is, is Dr
Peterson's report
included in your report
to us,
Mr Chair? Yes.
Are, are we about to wrap it up
here?
Because if the committee has any
questions at all, we're going to be
way over.
>> We have one last speaker who
have already told
that he needs to >> keep it
short,
Mr Chair members of the committee.
My name is Eli Frescos.
Appreciate being here today.
Um I wanted to
very briefly talk about
accessibility and I'll just go straight
to the point, July's
Disability Pride Month and
we really want to recognize
and honor the American Disabilities Act
and talk about website
accessibility. In particular,
I was planning on talking about a few other
aspects of accessibility, including
physical accessibility and
program access and offices of
accessibility, but getting
right to it, digital accessibility.
There are new standards that are out,
higher education institutions
must comply with the web content
accessibility guidelines as
mandated by the Federal Department of
Justice in their guidance published
just this last year in April
of 2024
institutions must meet these
standards by April
2026
or April of 2027
depending on their size.
This involves thorough audits
of existing websites and
digital resources to identify
and address accessibility
issues.
One way to meet this is to
enhance training and
awareness around
accessibility. So
that's utilizing university
accessibility offices to educate
faculty, staff and
administrators on the importance
of digital accessibility
is crucial. So we're talking
about students using assistive
devices. How do we make
sure that they can utilize
school websites,
the other place is enhancing
compatibility with assistive
technologies, right? So it's collaborating
with it, community
vendors, web app
developers to ensure their products
are accessible in
the in the new virtual spaces
testing, digital resources
with various assistive technologies
will help students who
rely on these technologies to
overcome barriers and fully
participate in their
education. As we
celebrate this Disability
Pride month, let us commit
to making higher education
more accessible for all
digital accessibility
is a new civil
right? And it's our responsibility
to re to ensure
that our digital and physical spaces
reflect those principles.
Thank you all today. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you,
committee
>> and in closing
and um uh Veronica,
I'm just gonna give the policy
recommendations. Mr
Chair members of the committee.
Thank you so much for your time
today and for your patience.
Uh We're gonna close out by
offering five different
policy recommendations and
then we'll stand for questions
um in uh looking
at all of this information and you can
see uh scholars
have a hard time. We use
200 words when we could use
20. And so secretary,
if Secretary Rodriguez was here, she would
say you need to gov it up. So
here we go. Um
Our first recommendation is that we
need to create a statewide
directors of uh a
statewide directors and chairs
of Behavioral health Programs,
professional organization
to create a community of practice
for behavioral health programs
across the state. This
would be similar to the New Mexico
Deans and Directors of Colleges
of Education that meets
monthly. Uh
We uh recommend
that we synchronize certificate
and associate degree programs with
fouryear programs to
facilitate seamless transitions
and credit transferability for
students across all higher
education institutions
who offer behavioral health
programs.
We recommend we work
acro we work with higher
education institutions
to encourage
mandate reviews
and updates of curriculum
guidelines to standardized
certificate and associate degree
programs in behavioral
health, including working with
HED academic policy,
vision to streamline
zip codes and the naming
of academic programs for
clarity to students. Uh
We currently and I want to make an
amendment, there's 29 institutions
in the State of New Mexico
and at those 29 institutions,
we probably have 29 names
for the mental and behavioral health
programs. Um
We recommend providing
comprehensive support services
throughout students academic
journeys including preparing
students with internships and work
based learning to be job
ready um um
to include meeting
licensure requirements.
And lastly, uh we
recommend prioritizing
um the hiring of diverse
faculty and staff to
enhance learning
experiences with culturally
relevant education that
address the unique historical
and cultural backgrounds of New
Mexico. Thank you for
your time and we stand for
questions.
>> Well, I
I
I feel a little bit like
the guy who asked for a
bookcase and got a
three story house.
We, we,
we were hoping to
get your, your
recommendations
for how to make
graduate education
free of charge in
behavioral health fields, much
like was done with stem
a few years back, uh
how to, how to incentivize
people to get into these fields.
And, and so I hope your
report will include
recommendations about
that specific thing. Should we,
should we expand the opportunity
scholarship to include
behavioral health fields at the
graduate level?
Should we give specific
scholarships for those that
would be controlled by hire?
What would be the best way of going
about that? Because that I'm hoping
that's going to be in the report. Is
it >> Mr
Chair? Yes, I want to
clarify that the
report today was on the
matriculation between two
year and four year institutions.
Um Additionally, we
have provided a
grant to the new
Mexico State University
graduate program
in Clinical
uh Behavioral Health
Counseling and they are
doing a pilot project for
us. Um And part
of that is using the appropriation
that was provided
to um give
uh tuition, summer tuition
to their students from
what we understand
is um
they already have support.
Uh many of the students already
have um support for fall
and spring and where they struggle
is having summertime.
Um uh uh
support in
addition to suppo support
for other types of obstacles, for
instance, paying for
um um personal
health insurance, but also paying
for insurance,
liability insurance that allows
them to do their clinical hours.
And so all of that
is going to be a part of that
report, this
is a separate one, but we are
going to produce that report for you
as well. >> Ok. So
I understand that. So
when we get
that report,
>> um that is in
the process of uh
how do I say the program?
Because it's a pilot
um grant, they're in
the process of implementing
it and studying it. Uh
We are excited um
that, that report will incl
include student voice
and it probably won't
be um until
the end of the
year.
>> You know, we, we were hoping
to have a that
report in time for
the 2024
legislative session.
It looks like it's not gonna be ready
for the 2025 legislative
session because any expansion
of funding would have
to be given to the LFC
this summer sometime.
So, I mean, it, it,
it is
frustrating to set
out two years ago
to try to find a way to
expand graduate
programs. What we're
trying to do is get more
people in the field
and it won't
happen for two more years.
I mean,
whatever the results of the pilot,
which sound very promising
and all of that is
not going to be ready for the 2025
session. There's no
way. I mean,
if the report is,
is finished in
December,
we have to
hold it over for 2026
the 30 day session
and maybe
then
and then that would take another.
I mean, this is,
it's like, it's like
pulling teeth
to get some simple
recommendations.
My recommendation to this
committee is get these
studies and just
come up with a plan
for making graduate
education free
and then let the higher
education department and the
everybody else react to
that plan but
try to get something on the books
this next year because
waiting two more years
is just
torture.
On the other hand, we
look forward to this
report which may be
helpful
in. Uh I think
you're doing exactly what the nursing
programs did years ago with the
articulation of the AAA
programs and the
B A programs and their
graduate prog that's
exactly what we need to do with all
of these programs. So thank you for
this report and
adding the cultural component
is gonna be very helpful.
It, it's just
that, you know, we asked
for the bookcase and we
got a
three story house,
we got a lot more than
we, we were hoping
to get. But it
valuable. Let me
turn it over to the committee for questions.
Anybody have questions,
Senator
Stennis.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr
Chair and thank you for the
presentation um
following the chair's
comments.
Uh yesterday, we were
in Investments and Pensions
Committee. Uh some of us
here today and
we got a list of the
permanent endowment funds
that uh the State
Investment Council are
holding and there's
$959
million
in the higher education trust
fund as a seed.
And 5% of
the three year average
goes into
um
your funds
for scholarships
and programs, etcetera.
So I'd like to
know
are those funds not
available
for all
educational purposes
where there is a workforce
need in the state of New
Mexico.
>> Mr Chair, Senator
Stefani,
um
the Higher Ed Trust is
new and from what I understand,
uh the
that average is going to be
used um in the
direction of of
funding for the New
Mexico Opportunity
scholarship. And so
u utilizing the New Mexico
Opportunity scholarship
does specifically
provide for high need areas
in the workforce, particularly
with the stackable credentials
and certificates um
uh which stack to associates
then to Bachelor's, but
we are always
trying to track those
graduates in the um
from those programs to the
workforce.
>> So Mr chair, the
um funds
that might be transferred
to the opportunity would
then cover the two year
and the four year
uh students
studying
behavioral health,
mental health, social
work.
Um And then
I thought we had
set aside
a graduate fund program
as well. That was
in the health care
needs.
Workforce.
>> Mr Chair
Senator Stefani,
there are several different
appropriations that have been
provided for graduate
work. Uh Last
year, we were able to push out
$10 million to stem
programs, which I believe
includes some health care
programs. We also
pushed out $15 million
for social work, graduate
work. And
pardon me? 1515.
Yeah. Um And so
all of that is in
the process of
making its way
directly to students.
Um If I may speak
to the nature of, of
how long this takes. Um
First uh um Mr
Chair, I want to acknowledge
and thank you all for your patience.
But um oftentimes
in terms of getting money out and
starting programs, it does
take those initial years,
you know, to uh do
the marketing to be able to
recruit, retain students
into the programs and to
build um that those
continued uh cohorts
of students in that interest.
And so we are trying to our best
to get these out as quickly as
possible. Um And
we think uh uh the
legislature and the executive
um for their patients in
um uh giving us
the opportunity to get the money out
to students and to, and
to build these
opportunities.
>> So Mr Chair, when we
give money
um
uh to any
programs and
we come across constituents
or members of the public who
say, do you have, do we have money
to do Xy and Z?
And if I would refer
somebody to your
department,
you would tell them you have to
wait.
>> Uh Mr Chair, Senator Stefanik.
I'm sorry, I may have misspoken. Uh
No, what we would do is we
would get them together with our
financial aid department
and we would connect them
with the resources that are available
through the state or we would directly
connect them with somebody at the
institution that they're going to
to make sure that they're served
immediately.
>> So Mr Chair for right
now, I have one further question.
So right now,
is the money
for opportunity
and graduate programs
distributed to the
institutions to
work with their students
or do you hold the money
and take the applications?
>> Senator? Uh I'm sorry,
Mr Chair, Senator
Stefanik. Um It
is uh pushed out to the
institutions um to
make uh the
the financial aid payments to
their students directly.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Maybe something
else will come up.
>> Thank you, Senator Stefanik,
Representative
Chavez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
Just to follow up on, on
what Senator Stefanos
asking. So how, how
is it determined?
Um
how much each institution
gets? I'm remembering that it's based
on the number of students that they
have or is it the number of students
that are in need
financially.
>> Mr Chair Representative
Chavez. Um the
are you talking about the $15
million for social work?
It's a graduate social
work. Um is, yeah,
there is a formula that the
higher education
department, institutional
finance um division
uses, it's
dependent on several
factors but that does include
the number of students they're currently
serving and then it
gets sent
out proportionally. >> Ok.
Can, can you tell me
if, if any of that
money goes to students who
are out of state studying
online? >> Uh No,
according to rule,
that goes to students
who uh
last year um
in, in rule, it said you had
to be uh graduates
of New Mexico in uh
higher high
schools and
residents. And we
recently changed that to
be uh broader to
be uh graduates of New
Mexico High Schools or New
Mexico residents. But
they do have to be a New Mexico
resident.
>> OK.
Thank you. So
define New Mexico resident. Do
they have to have lived here for
a certain period of time or
can they
Mr Chair here? >> And
Representative Chavez,
we use the
same
designation that the
DMV uses. So they have to
be here for at least 12
months.
>> OK.
Right. Um And
then the other
question that I have,
is there any, has
there been any
preliminary work
on
the credit transferability?
I remember years ago
we were able to do that
for nursing
programs. So has any
work already
started? Um
to sort of pave the way for
that. >> Yes, Mr Chair
Representative Chavez. I'm
happy to report
that for the past two
years. Uh The Higher Education
Department has coordinated
a statewide transfer summit
where we are bringing together
transfer professionals from
across the institutions in
the state uh to
uh really address a lot of the
concerns of students
um um and
institutions to make sure that
that transferability is more
seamless. In addition,
our um academic policy
division at the Higher Ed
Department has been
working with uh
faculty for
um gosh about 5 to
7 years now on what
we're calling the common course numbering
initiative, which is making
sure that um courses
are numbered um
similarly across
institutions. Um
And also we have something called
the uh gene General
education articulation
agreements. So that
students who, you know, if a student
starts at Saey Community
College and needs to transfer
to San Juan Community College,
that the transferability
of those common course number
using the common course numbering
system allows them to
do that. So they don't lose credit
hours in the transfer.
>> And then one final question
in terms of, I know that
Highlands has a one year
master's level program, an
accelerated program. And I'm
assuming that that's probably
four semesters.
Um do any
and and correct me if I'm wrong
and do, do any of the
other institutions have
the same kind of
accelerated program for masters
level Social workers. >> Mr
Chair representative Chavez,
I don't have that information
at the top of mind, but I can
make sure and follow up and let you
know from the different
institutions. What if
they have that accelerated program?
>> That would be great. Thank you. And I just wanted
to say thank you for
everyone on the panel. For all of your
hard work. I know that it's been years
in the making and you continue to
work to improve
um especially social work
in the state. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative Chavez,
Senator Tallman, followed
by
Senator Cio Lopez
and then Senator Lopez.
>> Thank you. Thank you Mr Chair
and thank you panel for being
here.
Um,
and my good friend, uh Senator
Lopez Googled
uh
excellence
cornerstone to Excellence.
It said you do policy
development, grant writing
evaluations. Do you have
a contract? You have a contract with the
state?
>> Yes, we do for this
project.
>> You have a contract with the state.
>> Yes, with the higher education
department to do this, conduct
this study to >> do what
to >> conduct this
study.
>> The study, Mr
Chair that's not going to be due till
December.
>> That's a separate
one. This study is
finished. We just don't have the
hard copy of it, but
once it's approved by
the Higher Ed Secretary, we're
told we will get a
copy and
that, >> that is
correct and we're shooting
for the end of July.
So >> we'll have that study
by the time we meet in
Portalis in
at the end of July.
But the other, the one that
they said won't be done until
December is the,
the
the
demonstration for the pilot
project. The that's
going on in New Mexico State now,
that's a separate
contract.
>> So thank you, Mr
chair and, and
panel. So
what's, what's the
cost of these studies?
What, what, what's your contract?
What's the amount of
money?
>> Mr Chair, Senator
Tullman, if I may. Um
we were given two
separate appropriations fy
24. Um,
1 was for $100,000
to do this two year mental
and behavioral health study.
Um, and, uh,
we have split that
up into two separate grants.
Well, one, I'm sorry. Pardon
me? One is a $50,000
contract, um, to cornerstone
to Excellence, to complete the
report. And then the
second, there is a separate
pilot project and
that other $50,000
has been granted to New
Mexico State Grants,
which is a two
year branch campus
um that is currently
rolling out uh
the like the dream pilot
project, the dream program
that we're all talking about,
which is um they
have done community
assessments um
and are creating
certificates that
um matriculate to
associate's degrees
uh that can go either
directly to workforce
in their own community of
grants um or
students can choose to
transfer and I
uh to New Mexico State
University main campus to
get their bachelor's degree there.
Um And they can either go in
person or get that
degree online via New
Mexico State Global.
And so, um they are
also gonna be doing a, a
pilot project
and a report back to the
agency um to
report out how
they have developed the program.
Um We've actually asked
them if they will track it for
us for the first three years of
their program. Um So
we'll get continued um
data and information.
Um and also uh
to
possibly, you know,
um provide information
to other in other two
year institutions who want to roll out
similar programs in their
communities.
>> Oh, thank you for that answer.
But you know, I hate
to be blunt but
a couple of you painted a really
pretty picture, but the fact
of the matter is we're in a real crisis
here in New Mexico
as far as behavioral
health.
One of the reasons we have such a high
crime rate is because we have such a high
percentage of people
that are mentally ill. 42%
of the New Mexicans who
need or want
behavioral health
care
are receiving it so
that leave 58%
that are not receiving it. Our jails
are full of
mentally ill people. We
have more people
in need of mental health
care in our
jails than we
do in our treatment centers.
In fact, we have no long term
treatment centers. We have to go out,
people have to go out of state.
Uh, for that.
Um
Everybody I talked to agrees
that we're far
short
of not only
providers
but also uh
physical phy physical
facilities to house behavioral
health
care.
I sponsored a bill this year
for 100 and $60
million to construct
physical facilities to house
behavioral health
care. Didn't even get
a hearing
senator
or TZ Pal sponsored a
bill
to provide
money to train
providers.
And I keep, I've asked you this a
million times senator how much
money did you get
if you get
anything?
>> Actually, we, we did get a
few items in House
Bill Two that were added in
by the Senate
Finance Committee. So I think it amounted
to about
1010 or 12
million, >> 10 million. That's far
short of what we need. We need 100
million.
And it's, uh, I
hate to say it, but you painted such a
pretty picture. The fact of
the matter is we got a crisis in this
state.
Um,
100 and 60 million sounds
like a lot of money, but it
was gonna be divided
among eight regional centers
throughout the entire state.
So that's only 20
million for
each uh facility.
So now the
governor now is talking
about the
competency
bill.
We get more people in the
training into
treatment,
but
that's a good idea, but we
don't have the facilities and
we don't have the providers
to provide the treatment,
uh that is needed.
So,
thank you, Senator for
letting me,
um,
what's the word?
I'm having a Joe
Biden moment. Um
So
what
venting? Thank you, express your
concerns.
Thank you. Thank >> you. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator
>> Biden for expressing my
concerns and
that's all I
have.
>> Thank you, Senator Tollman,
Senator Sido
Lopez, followed by Senator
Lopez and Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you. I just have one
question just to get
clarity. Um,
one suggestion by the
chair. Um
And, and again, I want to thank
all of you for
everything that you do. It's
incredible. But one
suggestion that the chair made was
to, to do something
dramatic right away, like
expand the opportunity
scholarship
to eligibility
to um
students seeking graduate
work in behavioral health.
And my question is just very
simple. Do you support that? Would you
support that if we try
to do this, this next
session?
>> Mr Chair Senator
Sedia Lopez, the
opportunity scholarship is
specifically for undergraduate
programs, what the higher
education department would support
is, um, uh
we already have
a graduate scholarship
program that's established through
our financial aid division,
but it is underfunded
in certain areas. Obviously,
we just got the $10
million for STEM, we got the
$15 million
for social work, but those
were not um funded
to the graduate
scholarship fund.
So what we would support
is an infusion into the
graduate scholarship fund
that would help us to support
graduate students
broadly.
>> Um Thank you just a
quick follow up. How
much?
>> Oh gosh,
Mr Chair Senator
Seia Lopez, um I would
have to get back to you on an exact
number, but when we're looking
at $10 million for STEM
25 I mean, $15
million for social work, you
know, um uh we
can see that if all of that had
gone into the graduate fund,
um we could have infused
it with $25 million that
would have broadly supported
graduate programs across all
these areas. Um
And uh what we're seeing is
that it's really hard to
spend that $15 million
specifically, um only
on social work, graduate students.
So, the one thing that I can say with
assurance is that we
would broadly support
the graduate fund
being um uh
supplemented
rather than creating all
of these individual
funds in graduate studies.
>> Just, just to be
clear though, that, that 50
million for social work, that's,
isn't that an endowment
fund? >> No, I'm sorry.
I think I'm not
speaking clearly. It was $15
million for graduate
student
scholarships. And
then we also had $50
million for faculty
endowments,
>> ok. Just
15 for
scholarships and five
>> for faculty
endowments. >> 50,
>> yes.
Um Mr Chair
members of the committee, I can follow
up with all of those specific
appropriations.
>> Thank you because I, I
share the chair's
frustration and just want to do
something dramatic to
move the needle as quickly as
possible. Thank you, Mr
Chair. >> Thank
you, Senator Senator
Lopez, followed by
Senator Gonzalez
and Senator Pope.
Do you have a question? All
right. Very
good.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Excuse me and thank you for your
presentation. Um
I just wanted to ask a question
regards to the
Colorado.
Um I get and
I, I was trying to write down
some of the information,
but you mentioned
that there is,
was it a bill that was
helping to create a pathway
for high school students?
Um Could you just clarify Mr
Chair a little bit more on
that?
>> Yes. Thank you, Mr Chair
and Senator Lopez.
Um We
have been supported
the Colorado
Department of Higher Education.
It's Senate Bill
21-137
that funded this
development of the
pathways. The
importance of those pathway
programs is
the micro credentials
can lead to the credentials to
the A as to the Bachelor's,
which then goes into the
Masters and this
created pathway also
can increase interest so that
more people want to pursue
this as a as a career in a
field of work. Um
It also frees up the clinical
workers who are licensed
because that is another
struggle getting people
to take on the challenge
of more time in school.
Um So these
people that are coming in with the micro
credentials, credentials and the AAA
degrees can
free up some time for clinical
workers by doing more of the
basic care and basic
things that are needed when they first come
in to allow the clinical person to
focus. But we
also have um
Senate Bill 22
1 81 and that one
outlined the ways that the
Behavioral Health
Administration works
with the Colorado Department of
Higher
Education.
>> And and thank you.
Um And the reason
why I ask that Mr Chair is because
I, I think
from my perspective
is that we're
missing
a golden opportunity
for our young people.
Um Our high school students are
very adept and
very knowledgeable and this
thing sure helps a lot with a lot
of them where they can do much
more research and such on
their own. And
I know Mr Mr Chair,
um I'm going through
the school system again with
my, my
uh middle
schooler. So I'm
learning a lot more about what our
schools are doing and not
doing. And in conversation
with some of the, you know, her
friends, siblings who are in
high school I'm learning
more about what their abilities.
I mean, they're just phenomenal
and I think Mr Chair, we need to
figure out here in New
Mexico maybe
seeing what,
what Colorado is doing to
encourage our young,
young persons in high school
um who already may have
aptitude for this to move
forward. Um
There are some peer counseling
groups in different schools.
There's some of those circles that some
schools are using to try and
teach students how
to deal with
stress anxiety
and how to
um how you
say not downplay
but trying to find a
way to, to deal
with the bullying that's
happening. And
I know that from some students,
I've conversed with it. It's,
it's promising because
they're learning the tools
that sometimes adults don't know how
to use, but I think
it's beneficial and then maybe
they can teach us something Mr Chair
as time moves on.
So I, I'm, you know,
um and
and I'd like
some more information on that and if
it's in the report, I think that would be
awesome,
wonderful for
us to look at, but I'm just
hoping that maybe we can do this for
the micro credentials and moving
forward because I think that's
another way that can feed
into our community colleges
and kind of do so
um as as we're looking
to fill the pipeline
like quick
and not wait another 5, 10 years,
Mr Chair when um
things will be very
different. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator Lopez. Senator
Gallegos, I mean Gonzalez. I'm
sorry.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chairman
and thank you to our panel
and Dr
Frescas and all
of you.
Oh,
this is not one of my
committees. So, you
know, my part
of the
content, you know, it's what I
get pieces in
and uh, but I am attending
the hearing today because we're
in Taos and I represent
Taos.
Yes. So
I'm one of the only members
that is on Senate Finance
from this group, which I hope I
continue in
2025
Mr chairman and with the
LFC.
But uh this is
a very sensitive and
be no
involved in education
for so many years. You know, I
understand the needs and I
understand, you know,
where we are and where we're going
as far as a state.
And it's very disturbing
to me to hear that
um, legislation
being created and not being
able to get a hearing,
you know, at least we owe
that to everyone.
And I
just want to offer Mr Chairman
that with
whatever you're working
with, you know, I would
be more than glad
to assist you,
you know, as a member from the
Senate Finance
and I understand you
can't really go forward, you
know, if that
framework and also
is the funding is not there
to support you.
So I speak
very much, very hard.
That would like to see
the year that this would happen,
you know, to really
enhance and to really go
forward at a different
level with your
requests. Thank
you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Senator Gonzalez.
And, and that's an incredibly
important offer to have somebody
on the finance committee
pick this up and run
with it. So we appreciate that
very much,
Senator
Pope.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
I, I just wanted to comment
on putting more money
into the
graduate
scholarship funding.
Uh Senator Cilio Lopez, I've
ran a bill the last couple years
to try to increase
that amount, but also give like a stipend,
a graduate student. So maybe we could work
together and make really
a package that includes this
and some of the other things that we've been trying to
do and we'll get with Senator
Gonzales and take him up on
that offer. So,
and, and finally, I just wanted to say, I
believe it's Doctor Jones
here at the end. Um
Just a
>> was that I'm sorry,
you're, you're gonna bring up
p Ablow. >> I was,
I was so um
just wanted to welcome you here.
I'm one of the few. I'm actually born
and raised in Pueblo, Colorado
and actually did a
semester at Pueblo Community
College when I got out of the Air
Force and then I came down here
so good to see you.
Welcome. Thank you, Mr
Ch.
>> Thank you Senator Poop. And
I want to thank you all. Uh
I also want
uh
invite and, and
ask that the higher Ed
Department could meet us
in
Socorro at the end of
August.
We'll, we'll give you the
exact dates of our meeting
in Socorro. I was going to invite
you to
Portales at the end of July
when we're meeting on the social work
programs more broadly.
But I think it might be better to
wait until
Socorro and give you a chance
because what we'd like to find out
from you besides an update
on the, on the study and
whatever is going on
in Las Cruces,
also find out how the,
how the loan repayment
programs are going,
how the, the
those those endowment
funds that were set up to provide
internships and
supervision support
and, and all of that, just an
update on all the ways in
which we're trying to
expand
the workforce in the state
that, that you've taken on
and, and,
and then maybe also some
further discussion of what
the best way of, of
getting higher
education more
affordable in the behavioral
health fields. So
would, would that be something that
you could, you could be
with us in Socorro? And
at the end of, I think it's the end of,
I think it's August
2829 and
30.
What is
it?
26 27
28
>> Mr Chair. Uh We
welcome the invitation and would
love to provide you with that
information. Um
And so we'll see you in
August and also
if I may um to Senator
Pope uh uh is
we would love to provide technical
expertise from the agency
perspective about
how uh to, to
frame
how do I the the bill
um regarding the apparatus that
we already have in place at the
agency for that graduate
fund?
>> Thank you. Thank
you. Thank you
doctor. And I
think Senator Steni
says one other comment.
>> Thank you, Mister Chair. I
had, I received a
text and
it's indicated
that we
appropriated
money
to your department.
$3 million
for clinical
supervision for social
workers at behavioral
health organizations
and that the money has not been
let yet.
Do you know about
that?
>> Mr Chair Senator Stefanik?
I do
and
um it's
actually $5
million and we are
preparing an RFP
that is going to be open
now in like here
at the start of July. Uh
We did get a bit
behind on our rfps.
Uh We apologize for
that. We have been staffing
up and so we're really excited
to say that we have a full staff
in institutional finance
now who are helping us
to get caught up on those.
But that should be um going
live shortly by
July 15th.
Uh uh I,
I want to say
I know that it's active and being worked
on right now, but I can
follow up with the committee
specifically with the dates for
that. >> So mister
chair, so doctor,
when something like that
goes out, like let's say July
15th, what's the
time period before
they're selected? And they would
start the
award. >> Mr Chair
Senator Stefanik, we have
to use uh the GS
A procurement process
for RFP S.
Um So at the very
least it needs to be, you know,
um marketed opened
up for 45 days,
go to committee. Um
So we're looking at
the very least two
months,
>> ok. Sounds a little longer.
>> But
if we put it on,
pardon me, like on hyperdrive,
we can push them out usually in
two months. But you're right that
some do take longer than
that. >> Ok. Thank you. I just know
they're waiting to be able to
because that would help our social
work students too. Thank
you. >> And,
and that would be something else
that we would want to hear about
in Socorro, an update on
that
Mr Chair. Understood.
So thank you doctors.
The, the collected
doctors. It's great to have you
all come and present
to us. Thank you for the work you did
on this report and we look
forward to being able to read it.
Thanks so much. Thank
you. So,
members will now go to the,
the third
panel this morning
and we're just one hour behind
schedule. So we're not
we're not too bad since we're skipping
lunch,
we're not skipping lunch. We're
having a working lunch. So help yourselves.
Food is here. Go
ahead and, and serve yourself up
during this presentation by the
UN M Healthcare
Workforce Report.
And I know Dr Zidan
is here, Dr Richards
is here um
uh uh doctor
uh Heme Raisi,
the interim Vice President for
Research and research
professor at the Department
of Pediatrics is also
here.
Who
is that UN
M
and, and incidentally, the,
the lunch is being provided
by the presenters UN
M Health Sciences Center. So
it is
appropriate that we eat during the
presentation.
Go ahead, Doctor
Zonis. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair and
uh Senators and Representatives.
We're thrilled
to be here. So I learned
a lot from the last presentation.
So we
uh anticipated
having 3,
10 minute presentations
in our hour. So we'd have
at least a half hour for
questions.
Uh We have
as you can see on the cover
sheet. Uh We
have uh our Vice
President for
Health Sciences Research.
Doctor Racey is gonna
speak on the
health care
workforce report of New
Mexico.
And senior Vice President,
Doctor Richards is going to
talk about
other factors that
need to be thought about, around
needs and strategic
considerations.
And then I'm gonna wind up
uh talking a little bit
about U and M and how
we see both helping the state
as well as what we need to do in our
own health
system.
So
what I learned from the last
presentation,
uh Mr
Chair is to ask you
upfront. Are there any
critical questions that
you're hoping we're gonna
uh address so that
if we tweak on the
spot, we can do
it?
So Mr
Chair, are there any critical questions
you
have?
You were hoping for that we would
cover >> we, you know, we've
had various people
come before us
yesterday talking
about shortages and,
and where
the real issue for us
is. What can we do
about it if there's anything
that, that the legislature
in taking action
might do to reduce
the number of
people who go without
being able to access health care? That's
the key issue for
us.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair and
I'm going to uh
lateral to my right
to uh
Doctor >> Racey.
Good morning, Doctor Ay,
welcome. >> Hello.
Thank you very much. Thanks for having
us. Um As part
of the discussion, I think we're gonna
start with the New Mexico
Healthcare Workforce Report
just to give everybody
a summary a
reminder
as how this
report um
comes from. I mean, it
started as, as, as I'm sure
you all remember in 2012
New Mexico State
legislature passed a
law um which was
called the Health Care
Workforce
Data Collection
Analysis and Policy
Act. And as part of
that law, three
components were very evident
and that is the licensing
boards are required to develop
a survey on practice
characteristics. That was
of course, very important
because as part of those questions
we get asked where
we practice
rather than using just a mailing
address and also
how many hours per
week we practice. So
again, that would also distinguish
those of us that still have active
licenses, but we do not
practice. The second
component of that was that the
licensor data was
directed to
MHSC for stewardship
and storage, data analysis
and presentation.
And the establishment.
The last one was the establishment
of New Mexico
Health Workforce
Committee to include
statewide constituents.
And again, if you see in the, on
the slides that I have
for you all the
entities. And I'm very
happy to announce that we do
have representation from
these entities. Our
committee, we have about
30 to 35 members
in the committee when
they see the result and
the report
and,
and they make recommendations
collectively as the
committee and the report
gets published. October
1 of every year with
updated information.
So
next slide again, as I
mentioned, the latest report that
we have is from October
of last year, October
2023. The
link uh and the code
is there just in case
if you would like to have access to
that data, it is public
information and
accessible to everybody.
Next slide, please,
again, this slide
will show you the
um the progress
of the report we started in
2013 and with
four professions
and today we are reporting
on 15.
And I would like to remind
everybody that updated
information
last year was only
provided for nurses,
emts and midwives
because of the um
cyberattack
and that RL D
face. And as a result of
that, we have lost the data
and we do not have updated
data. Unfortunately,
this year and
again, we are not gonna have
updated data because we have
to renew our licenses
every 234
years. So they accumulate
the data again. So
hopefully after that,
maybe in 2025 we
will have more information
about other professions
as well. Next
slide please, again,
as a reminder, we
have two types of
analysis. The
first one is actually
provided in the report by
New Mexico Department of Workforce
Solution. And the
data that they have is
based on the current and projected
hiring demand. So
we call that demand
data. And then the
second set of data
is that the New Mexico
health care workers analysis
centers, which is
the supply analysis
of all the information
that comes from licensing
agencies and
as providers
answer to those
questions that
are part of the renewal
of the license. So we
have demand and supply
and what we would like to see
is that if we are
short as it is
calculated based on
supply analysis,
we can actually see
on the demand data.
So this way we can actually
confirm the datas
are correct.
Next slide please.
This is an example
of kind of a data that you
see in the report. Again, I'm pretty
sure you all have seen this
at some point during our
presentations
just to give you some ideas again,
as what kind of a data is
provided by uh
by this report.
Um So the map
that you see has different
colors on that
and it um
um so
what it shows
uh for different counties
is how the counties meet
the national
benchmark.
And if they have met the
national benchmark,
they are in green color.
And if those
with substantial storage
is in red,
you can also see
the breakdown of gender
and ethnicity on the
right side. You can see,
for instance,
um the year
before we have gained 22
primary care providers,
but last 69
you can see the average
age. Why is it
important because we want to
see how many of our providers are
actually, you know, close to
retirement
and um
um and so on.
Um So again,
what we are presenting to you
is the supply. Next
slide, please,
you see the same similar
data for
nurses. And again,
you see in the map, if we have a
lot of red, as you can
see, a lot of counties do not
meet the benchmark
that is required that, that we
would like to see for our uh
registered nurses
as well as clinical
nurse specialist.
Again, for all the 15
professions that we report
on, you can find similar
informations in
our report.
Next slide please
that shows you the summary
as of December of
2021 2022
you can see the shortage
if we would like
each county to be
above the benchmark.
I would like that to
be clear as we are talking
about reaching the
benchmark for
each um
uh for each county
and, and as you can see,
we have pretty much shortage for
every single professions.
As you see
here.
Next slide please
as, as you saw
in a couple of maps, the
shortage are most
severe in less
populated counties.
And we can
consider
redistribution
for some of the counties
that they have higher
than benchmark
providers to red
this redistribute to other
counties. But this
please be mindful
that this may or may not
work because
we report
on number of
providers. And
if you want to redistribute, the
healthcare infrastructure
may not exist in those
areas, so it
doesn't work all the
time.
So the average
national age
is 53.9
which is nearly
10 years higher
than the US labor
force median age of
41.8 when we
look at our
physicians. So
this is another thing to be
mindful of as we
consider people approaching
to retirement.
And among states
with the highest percentage of
active physicians, 60
or older, we
are actually second with
39.2%
compared to
33.7%
nationwide. Again,
that, that is
the data that we have
that indicates again, more
providers are going to be
retiring
soon.
Next slide, please.
So I have actually
have a statement from
page 11. Our report
just to point out that
even when you see
green
counties,
when you look at different
professions, it does
not indicate an
excess of providers
by simply account
greater than the benchmark.
Another word that does
not reflect the need of
a state as it is
stated here, we should also
consider there might be
shortage for a lot of
professions that we are reporting
on and based on
the national benchmark,
we may be
above the benchmark, but it
doesn't mean the
need is still there
and the shortage is still
there. So I just want to
point out that we are
very much aware of the
limitation of the
report and the fact
that we are just reporting
on the supply and
not necessarily
on what is needed for
the state. Next slide,
please, which is my last
slide. So what are the
futures of New Mexico Health
Care workers report? I
believe today we are here
again as part of the
discussion and
elevating this subject to
see. Um how
can we um
improve this report?
Of course, I have to point out
that this is a mandated
and funded task. So I would
like to bring out every time there
is an opportunity.
And also what
are the, what are the opportunities
to amend HP
19 as we
find that necessary, should
we consider alternative
or superior data
sources at the
time of advancing
knowledge with data science?
A I, should we consider
other sources? What
are the better estimates of current
New Mexico's healthcare
workforce? And
what should be the projections
or forecasts of the needs?
How can we do a better
job to have short
term and long term
goals? And
with that,
I'm gonna hand it in to
Doctor Richards.
>> Ok. Thank you, Doctor
Ay. So Mr chair and
committee members, I'm Michael Richards,
senior Vice President of Clinical
Affairs. I'm gonna pick up
where Dr Ay started
the conversation about our current
workforce report, really tells
us about the supply
and that's, and the word that we use
there is benchmark and the benchmark
is the number of
those health care professionals
that we have per
capita. The
problem with that uh uh that,
that idea
is that as a benchmark
is that we have a national
shortage of health care workers.
So you can be at the
national average of healthcare
workers and not have the
number of healthcare workers that
you need. So what
we really need to be able to do is
to look at at how
we assess what the demand
should be. And then that
let us know what the gap is
between our supply
and um and
our current
available need.
So, one of the other concepts that Dr
Racy talked about was that
when you look at our current maps,
you may see that in some
geographies, we might appear
to have more per
capita than in other
areas. And that may imply
that there may just simply be a
redistribution issue.
I just want to just, I'm spend a
little bit of time talking about
that as a really important
concept because
oftentimes there's really no
opportunity for redistribution
and that gets to the idea that
what we really have to have is
health care infrastructure for
us to be able to recruit health care
professionals into.
So I'm gonna move over to page
19 in the
presentation which is SG
two at the top. And
so this is part of the, the
data that we use for actually
measuring the need
for health care providers,
not just the supply. And
I'm gonna talk about specifically three
of them in a couple of moments.
One really of the demographic
trends in a particular
state. And that's going to be a really
important driver for us in New
Mexico practice
trends are also an incredibly
important driver
of how we build our
healthcare workforce
and then geographical
considerations. Um But
there are also lots of other factors
like market considerations,
evolving technology
reimbursement. Um
So let's go over to slide
20 on here, which is
just for a couple of moments to talk
about why understanding
the demographics of
the geographical area is so
important to understanding the
health care need.
And the the ones that I'm gonna
talk about are aging
population first.
So as you know, New
Mexico has one of
the most rapidly
aging populations
in the United States. And by
by 2035 will
be one of the oldest
states per capita
in the United States that
becomes incredibly
important in health care.
Because um as
individuals move from that
age group of 18 to
64 and
into the 65 and
older health care group,
they consume health care at a
much different rate.
And in fact, for things like
hospitalizations, the
65 and older age
group consumes health care
at least four
times greater than
the age group before it.
So as we end up with an
aging population, our health
care needs are going to go up
and they're also going to be different.
So we can't just look
at our, our overall
population growth. We have to
really understand the age
of the population to really
understand the need.
Another important consideration
for us is that that
overall, we have
relatively declining birth
rates. Um and,
and in fact, when we look at
just birthrate related
to deaths in
2023 we
actually had more
deaths than births.
This becomes also really
important because it also
changes the, you know, the
complexity and the kinds of things
that you build in your health care
delivery system. Now,
we're from the University of New
Mexico and this has particular
implications for us because
one of the things that we want to
be able to grow are
programs for women and
Children. But if we
don't have
birthrate
um growth,
then there's certain educational
programs that we can't grow
because we don't have the
population to support
that. So for example,
this oftentimes becomes the
rate limiting step
for how fast we
can grow family,
community medicine,
emergency medicine. And
then obviously, obstetrics and
gynecology.
Another really important
trend that I want to make sure we
spend a moment to talk about
is the concept of where
healthcare professionals
practice. OK.
And, and this gets us to slide
21. This one
looks specifically at
physicians and the
key message here
is that physicians
are rapidly moving
away from
solo of
practice and moving
into corporate
and group practices,
mostly working for
hospital systems.
This is incredibly
important when we start thinking about
growing health care and
addressing the workforce needs
in a state that has so
much rural area as New
Mexico, because
providers have to
have health care
infrastructure to be
able to work. And most
physicians that health
care infrastructure is really
hospitals. And so
you'll see here that that
since since
2000 and actually
COVID rapidly
accelerated this now,
almost 78%
of all physicians work
in some kind of health
system environment.
And that trend continues
to grow. Then that moves
us over to page 22.
So when we think about
growing, addressing our
health care needs,
healthcare professionals
are one giant piece
of the puzzle. But
having hospitals and
health care infrastructure
is an equally if not
more important part
of that puzzle.
>> Does that include, does
that do those that
infrastructure include
clinics like
the the FQ
HCS? Would you include
those in that figure?
>> So, so Mister
Chair, yes. So
when I talk about when I
talk about working in those kind of
corporate structures,
you'll see in this particular
graph here that that
55% work
in health systems, those
are largely hospital based
health systems. And then the
other 22.5%
are other kinds of corporate
entities. And that could
in fact be FQ hcs that
are not necessarily hospital
based.
So when we think about hospital
or we think about health care
infrastructure, where
does New Mexico
stand in terms of our
overall health care
infrastructure? And
as just a a marker
of this and this obviously
isn't a comprehensive
assessment. Let's look at
just hospital beds
alone and when we look
at hospital beds alone,
New Mexico comes in
48 in the
United States and the number
of hospital beds
per capita.
And so for us to be
able to at least move to the
national average, we're talking
about a need of over 1200
additional hospital beds
and those hospital beds
are not equally
distributed geographically,
they predominantly are
located in our high
patient concentration
areas. So when we think
about addressing healthcare
workforce, we have to think
about what the underlying
infrastructure is that's there to
support them. Now,
the next few slides, I'm gonna go through
relatively quickly because I just
want to point out that there are other
tools that are available
now for us to really
assess the need. And
those are largely tools that are
available from HSA the health
care Resources and
services Administration.
And now we have
national tools which are
available which let us
look at projections
of healthcare workforce.
Um They have simulation models
which look at not only
just the supply, but they look
at the age of the
workforce, they look at the
reimbursement models and how
that impacts workforce,
but they also look at the health of
the population, the age
of the population. They
look at tho those other
graphics and allow you
to project what the
actual gap is.
So now I'm going to move over to
slide 27
because this addresses
one of the things that oftentimes
comes up, which is, where
are we on primary care
physicians? Well, you'll see
that in 2021
we're at 93%
adequacy and by
2035 we'll be
at 82% adequacy.
So that gap is getting
big. Another important
thing that you can do with these national
tools is look at at
what the adequacy is
by type of area,
urban versus rural.
And why we may be at about
82% adequacy
for family community medicine.
If you were to only look at
the rural areas, you'll see
that that number almost
always goes to
about half. So you'll
see that that would become like a
40 to 45%.
We look at pharmacists and I
include this one here because it's a
very different story,
but it's also an important
opportunity for us. So
when you look at pharmacist
in New Mexico, we're
actually at 100%
adequacy. And by
2035 we're
projected to be at
100 and 25%
adequacy that becomes
important because that gives
us a healthcare workforce
that we can possibly
use to deliver health
care in different ways than
may be done in other states.
On slide 29
I include the list of
using the HSA tool
for the 20 th
2034
gap analysis by
all of the professions.
And you'll see here,
78% adequacy
by physicians, which
as you heard earlier today,
a huge need for
behavioral health workforce,
um behavioral health
workforce 48%
adequacy. So,
um you know, tremendous opportunity
there and on page
30 which I'll, I'll hand
this over to doctor Z Adona
on really starts to talk a
little bit about some of the strategic
considerations for addressing
this overall access
to health care, which is in
part driven by
w by the workforce, but it's
also driven by the
availability of the
infrastructure,
>> Mr Chair.
So uh
we heard your question, what
to do about
uh access, how to
improve it. And
so I'm gonna now pivot
to we think
about that every day in our
work. I
wanna thank you
all first for the
great support you've
provided for having this
kind of forum
to talk about uh
the particular
uh this particular
topic. So, thank
you. Uh
I want to also thank our regents
who've identified this
as a top priority for
all of you. And m the
president is
also has this as a top
priority. So it's really
all of the university
working together.
Uh In
one of the, the thanks slide,
I recognize
all of the other great leaders,
our deans, our
uh vice
presidents, our CEO S
of our health system
who were all working
together. We had a half
day retreat with our regents
to go over what I'm gonna go over
in eight minutes. Uh
So uh we'll
get right to the point
and you'll have more material.
It also means that we
are working hard to
complete a report,
finalize our plans
and then we will have more
specificity.
Uh just as a reminder.
Uh slide 34 we
do have a strategic plan in
health and health science. You
can look it up at
any time. We have a separate
workforce uh
area that ta
uh in our strategic
priority, which
will complement
the report you'll
receive.
We think we're uniquely
positioned as the only
academic health center in the
state that on
slide, 35
we have education and
pathway programs,
clinical and community
engagement all over the
State Trauma uh
Center for the whole state
cancer, etcetera.
And we also have research and
innovation and have
created economic
development
like any academic health center,
we have research, clinical and
teaching. But some of the
things that make us unique
are our focus on workforce
behavioral health, health
equity and economic
development.
The next slide slide 37
is important and I'm going to
put a little more time on
that one. So
we see this as an opportunity
for both higher ed
and health systems
across the state to partner
work together to address this
issue. We
always every day, think about
two lenses. What are we doing
for the state
and what are we doing
within our own health
system? Uh
We know we
need clinical faculty
and staff expansion
to continue to
increase the workforce
numbers and our student
numbers. We need
to retain the people we
have that
deals with competitive
compensation and other
factors. We need
to recruit more.
And as our tower goes up,
we're gonna have even more
need. Uh We
want to make sure that professionals
are working at the top of their
license. That means
our pharmacists and our
nurses uh with the
policies in this state
that provide opportunities
for them. Uh
That also means we need
researchers uh
to support
our accreditation and other
activity. Uh
Well being is an
issue across the whole state.
Behavioral health is for patients in
the community, but it's also for
well-being of our own
uh uh workforce.
Uh We need more
students to address this
problem in addition to recruiting
more folks
loan repayment
uh is gonna be a
critical strategy.
Maybe the Navy model
of getting people if they get
uh funds to stay
and commit to working in New
Mexico. Uh We're
also have a new
social work program
that we're partnering with Highlands
on and thank you uh
Mr Chair. You are in particular
supportive of that.
Uh we're gonna be
one of the nation's leader in
graduate medical education,
which is also
another great thing
for this state because those
folks are ready to
work it uh
immediately. So
we are thinking every day, how
do we coordinate both the
faculty growth,
the student growth
and our capital improvements,
both for the
education part
but also for our clinical
facilities. So
next slide with
the
uh
for uh pieces
of pie uh
So we are focused on
expanding our clinical
delivery system and
infrastructure.
We are focused on
training through
pathways and the programs
described the hour before
us but also into
professional education,
cross training,
telecon consult to help
people over this all over
the state. The tele mentoring the
project echo does
we need to retain
our folks
and we need to
recruit.
Uh So these are our
critical strategies
for reducing, for
increasing access.
The next two slides I'm not going to
talk about, but they show
all of our clinical
system growth. If
you look on the right side of each
image, you'll see both in
inpatient and outpatient
growth. What we
are targeting
right now in the next 10
years, uh we
might be able to do more,
but that's what we're targeting,
sir.
>> When you show this,
are we including CASA? Is
that considered part of your,
that's separate. >> I'll talk
about CASA when
I talk about substance use. So thanks
for that question.
>> And the as
a program also
similar >> these are all in
our clinical expansion,
but we're hoping in substance use
to go further and
I'll talk about that in a
minute.
So
um
I'm gonna speak very briefly
about our academic health
unit. So starting on slide,
42 with
nurses, uh
you can see
a photo of Dean
Rosario Medina,
brand new College
of Nursing Dean. We're so
excited about her. She
has very strong clinical
background and we anticipate
that will help nursing
to do even more
kind of like our School of Medicine
where they're doing a lot in our health
system. Uh
We see growth in
that area. You can see the
numbers, our
stress points
here, our
faculty
shortage
also clinical
infrastructures for rotation,
expanding our
simulation.
Next slide speaks
to the College of
Pharmacy.
Uh
We are
80% of the pharmac in the
state come from
uh this college.
And so it's a national
problem less people are going in
this field. So we think we
need to recruit from out of
state. Also, we
are in the top 10
of research institutions
in the nation. Uh In
that college, our College
of Population Health hopes to be a
school of public health next
slide. And so the critical
thing there is ongoing funding
and support for the
school faculty that
we've been
able to recruit and
bring in School
of medicine. Uh
again, well
positioned for
uh growth
as we increase our
clinical side. That's gonna
be an important component
of it. Uh If you
look at slide,
46 we
are fastly growing
with that red line going
up. Uh We could hit
1000 and we would be
one of the top
uh health systems
with number of residents in the
country. And so this
is an important area
next slide. So for
the School of Medicine,
we wanna increase
our number of students,
we need more space,
mentors, clinical
platforms, we need to
recruit, retain our
faculty.
And really, it's a matter of
time. I know a lot of you
care about the health professions.
The next slide, we have
programs in that area,
we can expand them and
we've now added social
work that should start with our
Highland partnership.
Uh Next year. Uh
Next slide
49 just
as a reminder, we have
branch campuses and
we're at one of them, all
of them have health science
activities. We're in that
building. Uh Rio
Rancho is our local
other campus
uh near
um in Rio
Rancho. And that has a
number of programs. You
all have been very supportive
of our pathway
programs. And so I just
remind you our communities
to career. We
usually train a at
least 700
students from around the
state and they're from all over.
And if you look at the next slide,
those are the critical six
regions, tribal and
non tribal
programs.
Uh Next slide.
Thank you for your focus
on behavioral health. I'm an addiction
psychiatrist. I've chaired
large Department of Psychiatry
and I've also been a president
of a large network of
community behavioral health. We
need more in this
state. Uh
We need to cross trainin
everybody because
behavioral health happen
in every setting and we can't
just focus on
uh behavioral health. We are
involved now in the jail. Thank
you for uh mentioning
that Senator Tallman with
M DC and we see that as
an important component.
I just want to mention a few
dates coming up.
Uh We're gonna have a behavioral
health training on cour
mental illness and addiction
because often you're only trained
in one side of the coin. That's
September 11th. If you want to go,
let us know. Uh
it'll be, it's part
of the Homeless Coordinating
Council. Our
workforce development is
also on health equity.
We're gonna have our third
summit October
28th and 29th.
If you want to learn all
for free. Anybody online,
you in the room with a
QR code, you can learn
about social determinants of
health. Uh We
have a certificate there.
So thank you. And
I'm gonna stop at this
time and open
it up for questions.
We're here to
answer
>> for starters. Let me ask you,
did you get the, the
help for the
School of Public Health
Faculty
that the money that
didn't get through in last year's
budget? Did they come up
with some supplement?
>> We have not
yet, Mr Chair
and we are
hoping that we'll be part
of this next
year. We are having
a good dialogue with the
executive branch as well as
the legislative uh
folks. And
so we're hoping that
it might be that the
rpsp is the right
pathway. Uh
And so we're looking forward
to that as a
critical piece.
Thank you.
>> OK. Well, then let's go to the committee
for questions. Um
We'll start with Representative Ferrari.
We'll just go around that way and come
back around this
way.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you for all
of your great work.
We um
wouldn't be where we are in New
Mexico. I
mean, I
know you want to go higher
and we do too. But thank
you for getting us, you know, all
the good things that you've been
working on.
Um I just
have a,
in the one slide you
mentioned uh
Duana Crh
Clinic.
I couldn't figure out
what the crh
was. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair and
Representative Ferrari
that stands for Center
for reproductive
health.
>> Great
Tiff.
>> Yes,
I almost forgot to say this.
There are a lot of extra lunches
up here and it would
be a shame if they weren't
consumed. So please
anybody who has not
had a chance to run out and
get lunch on your own. These
are available to anybody in the
audience and they're all
courtesy of
the people that are making the presentation
right now.
>> So thank you for
that. Um And
that is in process
of being built. Now, is
>> that correct, Mr Chair and
Representative? Yes. So that,
that, that project was
funded as part of
the governor's capital
plan, a $10
million appropriation
to the University of New Mexico for
the construction of the
clinic. And so that
clinic will actually be done in
the model of our
UN M Medical Group Center
for reproductive health that we have
in Bernalillo County. And it's done
in partnership with a
bold futures and
strong families and
uh planned Parenthood.
>> Great. Um We've been
looking forward to that and
I'm do you know uh
projected time for
its opening
>> Mr Chair and a
represent of. Yes. So we
are anticipating that the
groundbreaking ceremony for
that uh center will
occur in late
August. And that
then we'll be in the
physical plant and delivering
care by around
January of
2026.
>> Thank you. Um
We're looking forward to that
and also,
um we
were speaking to the medical
board of uh
for
two or two
ago and
um
I was wondering
as we're trying to
work on the um
pharmacists um
care and for them
to help reduce the health
care, excuse
me gap.
Um Are
are you seeing a lot of differences
with the medical board and their
approval of the
expansion of the scope of
work? >> So
Mr Chair and Representative
Ferrari, so I think
that there's always a little bit of
um caution as we
expand the practice
of other kinds of health professionals.
Um I do applaud that
you know, that, that, that there
was an appropriation made last
year that help fund
bringing together um
both the medical community,
the nursing community and the
pharmacy community to
look at that expanded scope
of practice. And that included the
test and treat um
legislation that
was just very recently.
So that was led
by our College of
Pharmacy to kind of bring
that community together and
evaluate that. And I,
and I think that that while
there is always
a measured approach to
expanding it, New
Mexico still does remain
on the very front edge
of the scope of
practice for clinician
pharmacists. And that's one of the
reasons why I highlighted it because
it does represent an
ability for us to use those
individuals and
in communities where there
might not be other kinds of health
care professionals.
>> So Mr Chair,
that means the answer is
yes, they're working
with us with you
>> Mr Chair. Yes, they are,
we are all working together
to implement those
test and treat protocols.
>> OK? Thank you very much to us all,
Mr Chair,
>> Senator Pope.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. You're gonna get
a couple of questions from me, you
know, more than one today.
So a little bonus.
Uh Thank you both for being
here. Um Doctor
Richard, you and I hope it's
not a repeat of, I think
what was just asked, but you
mentioned about
um utilizing
some of our pharmacists in the
state. I just came
back from an NC
sl uh
meeting on
healthcare in DC last
week.
Um trying to
remember his name, a doctor. I believe
it's ja that used to work
for the President's COVID
response team. Um
That's Ed Brown
mentioned that as well
about, you know, maybe
expanding scope of practice,
possibly allowing
them to maybe uh
prescribe drugs
and things like that.
Um What do you envision
um or how we would want
to utilize them here in the
state? Um
Knowing that I know
it can be kind of controversial,
you know, with what's being
proposed, but
at the same time, maybe
doing it in a way that where we utilize
these health care professionals
but still do it in a safe way
for patients. So
>> Mr Chair and and
Senator Pope, I actually believe
that what we've done so far and
what was done in the last legislative
session was an was an excellent
start, which was
starting to expand that scope of
practice with the test and
treat for a limited number of
conditions. Take
also providing
the resources to allow
the medical community to
come together. That being the
medicine community, the nursing
community and the pharmacy community to
work on those, those
test and treat protocols to
get to a level of consensus.
Those are all the things that
have allowed us to kind of be
on the very front edge
of using this highly
trained healthcare workforce
to expand access to
care.
>> So Mr Chair and
Senator I just want to expand on that,
that, you know, we have a great
dean for our College of
Pharmacy who's
uh a leader in looking at
these policies. We have
strong support across all
our deans for
looking at this thoughtfully
and expanding it and
we lead the nation and
what is going on and we do
see uh
this will be
one important area including
also nursing in a very similar
way.
>> Thank you both and thank you, Mr
Chair. Um Last
question you mentioned
about the increased numbers. I saw
the chart on the residencies,
you know, been going to approach
1000. Has there been
additional work to
increase the types
of residencies and those specialties?
And I, and
understanding that we're not going to be able to
have everything here. It's just
that we do see folks still having
to leave New Mexico
and, and come back, but
just wanted to get your thoughts on
that,
>> Mr Chair
Senator.
Uh this is a
really important area to
keep growing the residency
uh and then retain
people in the state, which
we all do to work
together.
We see it in many
specialty areas. We're
also partnering with the
va uh
We've also created
the first residency program
in the nation that
partners with Indian Health
Service with our, her with
getting new HSA
dollars. Uh I'm
gonna ask Dr Richards to
expand on what I'm saying, but I just
wanted to let you know that
this is a critical area
and as we increase our
clinical uh
capacity,
that's tower, we
then have a capa an ability
to keep increasing
the number of residents that we
have. >> So,
so thank you. I'd like to just
Mr Chair and Senator
Pope. I just, I think it's
really important for us to
just make a note that
this kind of growth of
graduate medical education.
And these are individuals who have
graduated from medical school
but are doing that 3 to
7 years of training in
their medical specialty.
This kind of growth that you see on
that chart. This is
not typical, this
is a very that we
have, we really are
outstanding in our
ability to grow that graduate
medical education. And
we're able to do that
because of our partnership
with the state, predominantly
through Medicaid.
Most other institutions
use federal Medicare
money to grow residency
programs and those
things are capped the
number of positions and the
funding our state has
made a really big investment
in allowing us to grow
these programs. So the
rate limit step for us
has been, do we have the
demographics to support the
educational training program?
And do we have the infrastructure?
So as you see that we'll be
growing, you know, to about
1000 resident spots
as we grow the hospital
beds that creates the
learning environment. And
we also have the,
you know, the incredible support of
the Medicaid funding that
allows us to be able to pay
for that and
it will be across
all the medical specialties.
And so we're at about
78 different
specialties right now.
And so, um we'll
continue to add new specialties
as, as, as
um as we have the capacity
to do it. So, for example, we
just very recently added
a brand new ophthalmology
residency for the State of New
Mexico.
>> Great. Thank you both and thank
you Mr Chair and I can confirm at the
VA I went to a couple
appointments and some residents have
been there as well. So, thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator
Representative
Chavez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um So I have several
questions.
Uh The first one
is on page
20. It talks
about a,
a clinic on 98
street. Can you tell
me exactly
where the
reason I'm asking is
that's my neighborhood and I'd like to know
where that clinic is
gonna. Oh, sorry.
Um I'm asking about the
98 street Clinic and the exact
location, you know
that clinic, if you all can tell me
that
>> Mister Chair and Representative
Chavez, it's, it's in the area of
98th street and
central in that, that
place where they, where you see some of
the new construction.
>> All right. So it's not too far away
from the clinic on
Unser and
Coors
then.
>> That's correct.
>> Thank you.
So, the other questions that I have
is
in your report and
I'm assuming that this is just a
summary of the
report. Is this not the entire
report? Is that
correct?
>> Correct? You're talking about
New Mexico healthcare workforce.
Yes, absolutely. It
was published October
and the full report is
available online.
>> Ok. I haven't had time
to look at the full report. So
I'm going to ask you some questions that
are maybe in the report
that you haven't had the opportunity
to discuss here today.
So, um,
so one of my questions
has to do with um
diversity. You talk about a diverse
workforce, but I didn't
see anything in the summary of your report
that talks about, you know,
what you're gonna do to recruit
um
students and workers
who are
in terms of,
you know, Chicano, Latino,
Native American,
Black
Asian,
just the whole diversity of New Mexico
and bilingual as well.
And not only Spanish, but there are
many other languages that,
that people speak in New Mexico.
So what, what does that look
like? What is your plan to
really, you know, look
at diversity in terms
of those areas, >> Mister
Chair Representative. Thank you. That's
an important question to us
and we are very focused on
it so
I can give you examples. So
we have recently
had a focus on
uh enhancing our
recruitment of
Native American uh
faculty and students.
Uh We had a consulting
group uh
that was Native American owned
and led uh that
helped us in putting together
a plan. I don't have
that here to show
you, but I'd be happy on another
time to do a follow up
as an example.
Uh
So we have
also increased in the
last three years. The
number of faculty who are
Native American within
our health science. Uh
We have done
well with uh
Native American uh
students in our
College of Nursing. And
we're, but we need to do even better.
That's why we have all the pathway
programs, the communities
to careers.
Uh The
Hispanic uh uh
Latino
community is
another area of our focus that
we tend to be
one of the leaders in the nation by
percentage. And
we continue to
look at and uh
focus on increasing
those numbers. One of the
things I've committed to is also
a Center for Hispanic
Health that is similar
to our Center for Native American
Health with a focus in that
direction. Uh
Our Vice President
Val Romero Leggett
has a very strong focus
on this for
our students as well as
supporting related to,
to faculty.
>> So then my other question
is
um
in terms of the residents, how
many residents are staying in New
Mexico once
they graduate from UN
M
>> so Mr Chair and Representative
Chavez. So when we look at our
resident retention rate,
we are right at the AAA
AMC median, which is
a which right now is about
48%
and so 48%.
So where, where, why is
that the median? Because you would expect it
to be 50. It's because there are a couple
of states like California
that have a slightly higher
number. Um And in
terms of our residency programs,
we're right now at about
750 total
resident and fellow positions,
we bring in about 100
and 97 new
residents and fell those
each year. Um
We are, our residency training
programs are highly
competitive. We have
over 12,000
applicants for our
197
positions. And
um, and I think that that as we
grow more infrastructure, we'll
have more opportunity to,
to recruit and retain
those physicians to stay
and work here in New
Mexico.
>> And can you tell me specifically
what you're doing to
uh encourage
them to stay
>> well, Mr Chair and
Representative Chavez, I think that that
whenever we have positions
opening at, at our own
institution, you know, we
really do like to have them
stay and work for us.
Um That's a unique environment,
it's an academic environment,
but you know, we have, they,
they, they know our systems, they
know our patients. And so we do
try and, and recruit from
within and then I think
that, you know, that that other
institutions have other
mechanisms for trying to recruit.
And one of the things that we do
because our job isn't just to
train our own workforce.
Our job is to train the workforce
for all of New Mexico
is that we really try
to put residents and fellows
out in the community
where they get exposure
to other practice environments,
other health care delivery
systems. And so
that is a big part of what we do
in the resident training program
is to try and create those
other uh educational
experiences and
that's um done in a couple of
ways. And I'd like to also just kind of
again, thank the
legislature for
supporting
the funding mechanism
specifically for that
GME program at
UN M that
allows us to be able
to send those residents
to other kinds
of hospitals
that that wouldn't necessarily
have the funding to be able to support
them. And so you
actually support us being able to
do that. And we have about 35
FTEs worth of rotations
that occur through that specific
uh house bill two funding
mechanism.
>> There are a, there's
a summary of recommendations
included in your
report.
Um and there
are
10
recommendations.
Is there any reason why you didn't
include those recommendations in in this
report?
>> So Mr Chairman and
Representative Chavez, I can
I can try to answer that question. So
the report is about
workforce
around the state and the recommendation
comes from members
of the committee as they are listed
in the first couple of slides that
I have presented. So it is not
exactly
to School of
Medicine and the residence
and the retention for those.
And again, those recommendations comes
from the members of the committee
and the top nine or 10
get voted on and make
it to the. >> Ok.
So the reason I'm asking is that
I'm particularly concerned about
one
recommendation.
It's recommendation number
five and it speaks
to medical
malpractice. It's
my understanding that that recommendation
has never appeared in any of the
workforce reports.
This is the first
time. And
so
why
would this be
um
in a report like this?
>> So Mr Chairman
and Representative
Chavez again, that was
recommended by one of the members
of the committee and it
was discussed during our
sessions. And then
after that, everybody
voted on as being one of the
10 recommendations.
That was just an approach
for the retention, having more
private practice. And
again, as the chair of that committee,
I represent the members of the
committee. And what makes it the
report is based on the voting
from all members of the committee.
>> So can you tell me if there is
any data that was
used to support this
>> recommendation that was
presented by the members of
the committee at the time of the
discussion? >> So there
wasn't any data,
>> Mr Chairman and Representative
Chavez, it was discussed,
discussion was presented,
I don't recall if there was a
specific data being
presented. >> No, I mean
data, I don't,
I don't recall if
you can go back and look
for that. I would
absolutely appreciate having
that information.
I think what it says in here
is, I mean, there's
different,
contained within that
recommendation, there
are
different
sort of
points that are made
and it concerns me because
we've had this conversation at the
state legislature. I thought it was
resolved. Um, and
I'm not sure why, again, why it's
coming up here.
Um,
I think that it
doesn't,
the fact that that
medical malpractice has to
be paid is
not
why doctors leave the
state. And I
think that there's probably data that, that
shows that. And so it really
concerns me that this is
contained in, in your report
that a lot of time and effort apparently
was spent
um discussing
this. And it might also be
a reflection of who is
on the committee. I don't,
I know it's a huge committee
and I don't have that list right
in front of me, but maybe we
need to take a look at, at the
list and, and either,
you know, change it or include
some folks who are, who have been
excluded from participating
on this work. First report.
The other comment that I wanted to make
is that in
terms of R ends, we know that there's
a working an RN
shortage in the state, there's been an RN
shortage. And I think I said this already
before since the end of
World War two and we're still here trying
to figure out what to do.
Right. So I'm hoping that we
can, that we can
figure it out. And I think the
other thing that we need to really consider
too is working
conditions.
I spoke
to, I
had a phone call with some
nurses about three weeks ago.
One of them is a brand new
nurse. Has only been a
nurse maybe two, maybe three
years at the most. She's already gone
to part time. And the
reason is because of
staffing
and what I find is
that most hospital
administrators are actually all hospital
administrators are aren't interested
in having that conversation.
Um because it
um basically
they, they don't want to hear from our end. They
want to make the
decisions themselves. And I think that
that's something else that needs to be considered
in terms of retaining our
workforce, especially
our healthcare workforce is
really looking at working
conditions and creating
working conditions
with regard to
um healthcare
workers, ability to provide safe
and quality care. Thank you,
Mr
Chair.
Thank you, Representative >> Representative
Herndon.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr Chair and
thank you presenters.
Um I would like to
go and look at your comment about
infrastructure and
working together
uh with respect to uh
infrastructure and coming up
to some resolutions.
And I think Doctor
Zio that you indicated
that there was a half day retreat
focused on behavioral
health. And let me tell you what
my concern is. So
we have a coordinated
collaborative Behavioral
health collaborative at the
State. We have a
working group at the state
looking at how to coordinate
behavioral health care. And
then we had your half day
program.
Nobody was talking to each
other. I am concerned
that we weren't invited to
your event and you were not
invited to ours.
And so how are we coordinating
and how we gonna fix
this?
>> So, Mr Chair
and Representative Herndon, thank
you for your ongoing
support
and I
probably didn't speak
clearly. The
retreat was with
the regents and it
was focused on
health care in general
healthcare, workforce in general,
not behavioral health
specifically. Uh
We do have AAA
secondary
agenda uh which
is another important
priority, which
is substance use
disorder. Uh
We see that
as an area we want to expand
as well as with behavioral
health. Uh We
are a part of all the
statewide behavioral
health initiatives
uh uh Mr Rodney
mcnees,
Doctor Mauric
Toen, Doctors
Hall Bott, Doctor
Katie WICs. So
we know
that we at UN M can't
alone
uh
solve the
behavioral health problem, the addiction
problem, we have to all
work together. So
I appreciate your
comment. It's spot
on and sorry
for the uh mis
clarity about what that meeting
was about, but that one's really
focused about uh
because UN M has,
you know, 70% of
the nurses in the state come from
U and M, 80%
of the pharmacists come from UN
M. 90%
of our health professional graduates
stay in New Mexico and
half the doctors come from UN
M. So we are committed
as a statewide
working together and behavioral
health is something we
have prioritized.
And if you look in our strategic
plan, you'll see the little link
to that. But we
do, uh it's
really important, we all work together.
Thank you. >> So,
thank you. So, Doctor
Zonis Mr chair, who's not
here. I, I do
want to uh let you
know that on July the 12th,
at three o'clock PM,
this behavioral health working
group which is uh
funded through
the health care authority
will be meeting and
we don't have anybody from you and
them on that on that
committee. And so
I'm encouraging you to please
determine who that 12
or more people will be
to join us and I'll make sure that you
get that invitation.
And also there's no
chair of our collaborative
co uh coordinated health
care for the state. And
I'm gonna be looking for
uh to make sure that we have someone
appointed over that because
we cannot have that vacant
but have all three of those organizations
working to all three of these
organizations, meaning you and
m that workforce
development group and that
collaborative, then
I think we can come up with some good
resolutions for presentation
during this 2025
legislative session. So I
present that to you
and then um
team, I just like you to
look back at page at
your at your
uh slide number 11.
And if we look at that,
it says that we are
short of
5704
nurses in
the state. And my concern
with respect to that is that we
have increased our
numbers, our
funding to the school
of nursing, but our
numbers are not increasing.
So my question to you
is in all of the work
that you all are doing, are
you asking
nursing students
why they're not staying
here? And what is is
happening there? So, could
you please speak to
that?
>> Well, uh Mr Chair
Representative
Herndon, I'll
start and
we'll continue
on this. So we
continue to our graduates
stay in the state.
Uh similarly
to physicians, we have an
aging of the workforce
and so people particularly
with COVID was a push.
Uh So
uh a number of the,
the reductions,
we have to make sure we
uh
increase the number past
those who are retiring.
So retirement has
been a factor
in recent years
on on that number.
But yes, thank you
for the uh
funding support.
We have increased
the number of students
and graduates
and they continue to
stay in the state, but
I'm gonna pass it on
to
my
>> Mr chairman and
representative hand and I just
want to explain our
numbers comes
from uh
licensing agencies.
So I and the source
of information, everything
is from licensing
agencies, the questions that
are being asked
as part of renewing
the license. So I do not
have answers your questions
as why someone
does not stay or so because
all the data that comes to
us, it's based on those
questions that are being
asked. So I just sort
of make that clear that if you
do not explain why there
is still a shortage or if you
really don't have the manpower
or any source of data
to understand more about the
reasons for departure
or not practicing
lack of support by some
of the nurses. I don't have that
data. The data
that we receive is
from the licensing agencies.
Based on question we answer at the
time of renewing our
licenses.
>> All right. Thank you. And
Mr Chair. I just have two more
quick questions with
respect to our residents
and 48% of them
stand in New Mexico.
My question to the to the
panelists.
Have we resolved the issue
regarding pay for our
residents because that was
a huge uh concern
of them and, and
what is happening without getting
involved in any type of
union negotiations. I'm
just asking, has that been
resolved? That is a big
issue. And we'd
like to hear about that.
>> So Mr Chair and Representative
Herndon, so we've um used
the Medicaid uh
supplemental payment
program this year to provide
a 5% increase
of resident compensation
that occurred in January.
We've budgeted an additional
2% increase that could
start in July.
Um That uh that
is consistent with the
language in House
Bill two regarding the
supplemental payment program
and the 3.4 million.
And we've been working very closely
with Secretary Armijo
to ensure that the
that that intent
and that that resident
compensation
is, is being
provided.
>> Thank you very much for that. And my
last question, Mr Chair
and Pamelas is that
you have presented the information
about the growing and
aging population in our
state. So there
are, there are three things that I'm
concerned about. One
is that we look at the
aging population,
this is a state right now
where you can get a major
transplant if indeed
that happens to need
to occur. And
so I I hope that that is
something that's on our, our list
as we're continuing to grow our
infrastructure and our ability.
And I'm also looking at the fact
that in talking
to various
um companies and
agencies and the growth
of Alzheimer's and
dementia in this state.
And so there is a, there is
a, there is a mechanism
which U and M certainly
has the ability to
grow and to,
and to manufacture in this
state because it is
a radioactive component
and, but we're not doing it.
And so I'm, I'm hoping that that's
something on our list
that we will continue
to make
sure that we're taking care
of. And the
last thing with respect to this
aging population
is um how
we are making sure
that uh the
coordination that's needed
for the care in
terms of the of
what's happening with
our aging
population. And that
we are having these conversations
with our doctors regarding
bedside manner and
the way in which we are working
on and interacting
with our aging population.
These are things that have just been
brought to me in my
position as a legislature
and things that I see
people are are are facing
on a daily basis. Thank
you, Mr Chair and
uh
painless.
>> So Mr Chair and uh
and representative her just a couple
of quick responses back. So
we've just recently um
recruited and hired a new
chair of surgery
for the UN M School
of Medicine and Dr Desan.
And as part of her
recruitment into the School of
Medicine, we'll be looking
at at two specific
programs. One of them
is evaluation of
transplant. We currently do
kidney transplant, but
looking at at growing
the transplant program and
specifically things such as liver
transplant. Again, a big
piece of this will be, you
know, building into the new Clinical
Tower will give us the
capability of the physical plan
to do it is whether or not we have
the demographics from a
patient perspective to be able to
support a transplant program.
But that's currently um part
of our strategic plan.
Um We, we are also
greatly appreciate your
comments regarding, you
know, the aging population
and the unique patient care needs.
And, and so I think that
we have multiple initiatives
underway. And as you know, we
have our, our, our senior
Center and our Movement Disorder
Center. But again,
I your point is very
well taken that that it's
gonna, this is gonna be a very large
part of the patient population we
care for and that, that all
of our health care professionals are gonna
need to be well prepared to help
manage those
patients.
>> Thank you very much. I'm sorry,
please, >> Mr Chair
Representative heard and thank you
really important question.
Uh All
timer's,
it is a serious
issue. My father
died with Alzheimer's.
So on a personal level, I know
what families go through.
Uh the 36
hour book is,
is a reality for
families. So
we need to do even more in
this state and this topic
area. Um
Good news we don't always
share, but we are
one of the few in the country
to get a coveted
NIH Grant or
Center Grant in
Alzheimer's. So we'd
love to have you come
down and meet with
our research leaders because
we are developing a strength.
That's not our first center. We
have others in this area.
And we are thinking about how
do we really crystallize
these programs
together and
make sure we also have the workforce
that matches. I
also appreciate your
uh comment
about bedside
manner. Uh You
know, we have a, an important
initiative on commit to
sit so that
uh in the
hospital setting, making
sure that you have
really good eye contact and
connection and,
and of course, there's much more
to it than just a simple
thing, but just that simple
step does make a
difference. So, but I appreciate
you've raised that the
patient experience is very
important. Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much and, and
Mr Chair and, and,
and uh Doctor Racey,
I know that you have
done a lot
of work in clinical trials
and that we're looking forward to
more to your doing more
and the
fact that you'll increase
and, and look at
what's happening, not only in
our aging population,
but just as the fact that this
is a unique population
in the state with the highest
uh a
percentage of people of
color in here and the types
of different health
care that is uh affected.
So, um I just
want to say thank you to all three of
you. I think you're all dedicated to
all of this work. And
we look forward to
your telling us
what you need and that we
haven't supplied that
will provide
and make your work a lot
easier. And thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative
Senator Tallman. Do you have any
questions?
>> Uh Yes.
So the
way you an asked me
that
tend to, I tend to think
that you didn't want me to ask any
questions
anyway. Thank you Mr Chair and
thank you panel for being here.
Very interesting and
informative
presentation.
Um I too
share my concern
with representative
her and folks not
working together, people working
in silos.
Um I think
it's very shameful that the city
and the county of
Bern Leo aren't working together
on behavioral health. But I was very
pleased to see that you and
m
um
collaborated with the county
and to
on a, a new
uh
um
behavioral health
center that
opened a couple of weeks ago on
Marble Street. And
that was a
nice collaboration
here on page
11 or, or,
or chart
11.
It talks about
5700
clinical nurse
specialists.
Is
that,
that, that, that doesn't
include all nurses or
just uh
nurse specialists.
The reason I ask because I remember
four years ago
they was telling us that we had
the shortage of
6000
nurses,
which I assume to
be
all nurses.
So
does that, that that wouldn't
include our
ends.
>> So Mr Chairman
and Senator
Thalman, so we have
57,000 shortage
for RNS
registered nurses
inclusive of
clinical nurse
specialists.
And in addition to
that, we have,
in addition to that, we have
231 certified
nurse practitioner shortage
and 11 certified nurse
midwives.
>> So, ok, thank you for
the answer. And Mr
Chair and
chart
uh 29
it says that
the uh
National Center for Health
Workforce is predicting
that we're
gonna have
5100
gap in nurses. So we're
only how can they
determine
in 10 years? How do they,
how do they know that we're
gonna
they have some
kind of special powers
that enable them to predict,
make that kind of prediction.
So >> Mr
Chair and Senator Tallman, so
I just as AAA couple
of points of clarification,
the the table on
11 shows
our supply relative
to the per capita
supply today
as compared to the rest of the
United States and,
and, and that doesn't actually
show the shortage. It just says
this is how much we have relative
to what other people have
other states have
on, on page.
The, the other slide that
you see on page 29
actually, it shows
the estimated
2030
for gap
and on this particular
one, we're looking at,
at, at our ends
and um and
licensed practical nurses
and it's showing that we're,
that we're by
this HSA model,
by 2034
we would have a shortage
in that supply gap of
5140.
And to your point about how they
get to a calculation like
that HSA uses
a fairly sophisticated
workforce simulation
model to make those
estimates. It kind of
takes into account, you
know, our aging population,
our infrastructure, our reimbursement.
All there are multiple
factors that go into their
model. And I think the
important point about this is
that it, it tells us
kind of a sense of how big the
gap might be
and uh and
an order of magnitude. But
again, these are all these
are, these are estimates
um but it gives us a target
to work towards.
>> So we're, we're comparing
apples and oranges in between
these two charts,
>> Mr Chair and
um and Senator Tolman. Ye
yes, those, those
two charts are reporting
different things.
>> Oh, thank you. And one last
question, Mr Chair
on the 20
chart
29
they're predicting a
shortage
of
3400
behavioral health
employees, which is
the
the
uh the
biggest gap of those five
categories.
So they're not very optimistic
about us making
an improvement
and our number of
behavioral health providers. Is that
correct? >> So,
um Mr Chair and
Senator Coleman, this kind of gets
back to one of the other key
points, which is
um, one is about
infrastructure. And so
while we have, while we
have a certain degree of outpatient
infrastructure for behavioral
health, you know, in our
state built in our health systems
and largely in our federally
qualified health centers.
Um You know, we, we had a
period of time where our
reimbursement models for
other kinds of behavioral
health really didn't
support um
what we would call intermediate
levels of behavioral health
care. And so there
are huge gaps and
opportunities to
build that infrastructure
back. And that
I think is a representative
of, of not just the
the shortage of health care
professionals, but this is
also, I think demonstrates
that there is in some cases,
a lack of health care
infrastructure that
was ultimately driven by
a funding model that
kind of led to that
infrastructure
steps.
>> Well,
thank you for your comprehensive
answer. And again,
thank you for being here. That's all I have
Mister Chair.
Thank you, Senator >> Senator
Lopez.
Thank you Mr Chair
and I guess
Senator Tom and, and I were
kind of doing osmosis here.
But we, we have
similar questions
I had similar questions
um with regards to the same
charts. So
on number on
page six, which
is slide 11,
what says shortages
as of of 31st,
well, December 31st
2122.
The numbers here,
this is how many we are
short, is that correct?
So we are short 334
primary care
physicians.
Is that what this is saying,
Mr >> Chairman? Yes
and Senator Lopez,
correct. But
again,
Richards mentioned, I want to point
out this is if you want
to turn green,
meeting the benchmark for
every single county
without any
redistribution,
we are short
that many providers for
each profession listed.
>> All right. And I guess
Mr Chair and part of it when you talk
about um
facilities
um location around
the state, I know that in Las
Vegas here. Um
you know, I just
not here but across the mountain.
Um there's uh they
had to close, right,
any opportunity
for obstetrics gynecology
delivery of, of
babies on that
side um because of a
lack of
um practitioners.
Um and I know Mr
Chair, there's always so many other
concerns because I think
Gallup, there were some issues
about one of the
um entities
not delivering
babies either.
And I, I believe Mr
Chair that
as we as
legislators um
continue to encourage
work with those of you
who are in the health professions
to figure out how we can
assist, especially in rural
New Mexico.
Um Not everybody can
go to
Albuquerque, they can't drive
in Santa Fe and
some of the other locations
or they go across to
Lubbock or Amarillo
because that may be closer
if they're looking for access
points to El Paso.
Although Las Cruces, I know has
access. But,
um,
I think rural New
Mexico,
Mr Chair is,
where,
in other words, I guess my question, Mr Chair goes
back as to, how can the legislature
help?
I know you're trying your best and to
provide train
providers and such. But
what can you, what can the
legislature do?
We can increase reimbursement
rates? Right?
Um I've spoken to some
other young
persons who are, who were
considering going into health
care, but once
they began to figure out what the debt
ratio was of going to
school and how much that was going to
cost and
looking as to what they
were gonna have to earn in order. I mean,
it was just kind of looking
to a couple of these persons,
they said it wasn't worth it
and it was sad to hear that.
Um, so I
think they're, they're looking into another
medical profession because they still
have a gift, I believe. And I'm, I'm
glad that they're looking,
but Mr Chair just,
we look at forgiveness for
loans, you know, for the
educational loans,
especially as they
move on, you know,
789 years,
depending how long they have to go
for specialties.
So that was one
concern. And
then also too Mr Chair, when we
talk about how
important it
is
to prevent, right
for health, for
prevention.
That's a concern that
many of us have. And I know you all
do too. But when you look at primary
care physicians, that's
their primary goal for
lack of a better word is
to make sure that we're taking care of
ourselves before we get to that
point that our
health is so bad that we have to
go through all the other,
um,
lists of specialties
to try and get us just
to maintain our
health.
Um So Mr Mr
Chair, you know, it may not be
specific asking for
answers. At this point. I
just wanted to state
that um as
some of us, I'm not saying
anybody in particular in this
room, but as I'm
getting older, I
look as to what's going to be available
for aging
um here in the state
and how it is for the
younger persons who have to carry
the burden for me as I grow
older,
hopefully taking care of my
health. But
when we talk about dementia
and other issues that come
up, it's the system as
to what we do to, to
provide
um
for families, especially to
know that their loved ones can be taken
care of. So, I mean, it's just, it's
kind of this whole
progression
when we talk about health
care and
how we recruit our young people
for consideration to go
into health fields.
Um
It, it's to me, it just raises
some concerns and I know it does
for you, but it's, it's just what do we
do in working with the
system.
I know that Doctor
Romero Leggett is
doing some wonderful work
in outreach and such.
But when we talk about
our young people who are in
school and not just in high
school but outreach
consideration,
how do they get exposed?
And it's not just in Albuquerque
but in Santa Fe Las
Cruces, but in other rural
communities
because sometimes they do go back
home.
So just I just wanted to mention
those comments, Mr Chair and thank you
to Senator Tallman because he
helped to answer, ask some
of the questions for clarification
on those particular two
slides. It's just some
concerns. I mean, they're coming down
the road. They've always been here. We've heard
those over the years, but
it just hasn't gone away.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator Lopez.
Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
and thank you to our panel
and first
thank you for your
enthusiasm
and also so
much believing in New Mexico.
You know, we really have
to strive at that
and work with that and that
includes all of us. But thank
you for your part.
Um What I was gonna ask
is so Doctor
Richards on the
infrastructure,
does that include
housing?
>> So Mr Chair and
uh and Senator Gonzalez, no,
I I didn't specifically
speak to housing.
Um But you know, it's a very
important point. Um
And, and if I would just link
this just more specifically
like to recruitment of health care
professionals. I I do
know that in some areas of
our state, just availability
of housing is a factor in
terms of recruiting health care
professionals. But this
gets to a bigger set of questions
which we didn't talk about today,
which is that, that we
all know that
the socioeconomic status
of the patients that we manage,
including their housing
situation really
determines uh the
outcomes of their health.
And that is something that we
are now able to pay a lot
more attention to. And
I will say that New Mexico
um um has really
embraced this idea in
terms of both measuring
those issues around housing
and starting to build infrastructure
to, to help connect patients
to those those other
things that, that
are really important
to their, being able to
manage their
health.
>> Mr Chair and
Senator Gonzalez,
thank you for your question.
Um
I've chaired last
year, our Homeless
Coordinating Council that
is a partnership with the
city of
Albuquerque, the
county, uh UN
M and, and the VA
uh so there are new
resources uh
through Medicaid
available in housing that
we continue to look
uh toward
you've raised in a, a critical
issue. We also have
unite us uh as
a social referral technology
in the state. As people
do social determinants and
health assessments
in health
care settings, which is now
required by C MS
and where our doctor Art
Kaufman and his team
are uh
national leaders and
you have that little QR code
related to it.
So, critical issues
are uh how do we
educate also our clinical
workforce on how
to link people to the right
resources? Uh
So, uh
we also related to
homelessness uh
are partnering with
last year's macarthur
award winner, $100 million
Community Solutions.
And that program focuses
on people all working
together to
address the
issue of homelessness in
communities. Santa
Fe has a particular focus
on that. And so does Albuquerque.
But we're hoping that will be
something for the whole
state.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chairman and just a couple of
comments
first
uh through our
public education,
we have had teacher reach for
quite some time,
but yet a very,
very few districts take
advantage of that and
that is to be able to help
you build,
you know, so that when you
do go for recruiting,
that you have something available
to offer, you know, for
your professional or for
your teachers or,
and I've always felt
that this definitely
needs to be expanded
to other professionals
because they
might want to be here. But
if they can find a place
or something that
works, you know, for
them, you know,
that can be the deciding
point of staying
or not staying in New
Mexico. The
other part that I want to
mention, Mr
Chairman
is we probably
that I have seen
in the last 30 years,
we probably have done more
in the last two years
in getting the
foundation
for the infrastructure
for affordable housing in the
last two years.
So opportunities are
there, you know, and I'm
not suggesting
more work or more, but,
you know, just keeping in mind
how you
could manage to merge into
this because
it is available and
we do have um
probably within the
state,
you know, a pretty good program
going on to where
it's going to be first come
first serve, you know, as far
as working
and you know, setting up,
you know, this
request for affordable
housing and
it'll continue to,
to work because
so we
passed a law a
few years back, just
a couple of years back
to be able to provide
the
portion
of the recurring
to assist, you know, with the
mortgage finance Authority
and others, you know,
on the affordable housing.
So it's coming,
it's there and it's just a
matter of just
getting the right technical and
getting the right advice to
go forward on this.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator Senator
Stefani. Do you have
anything?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you for the presentation.
First of all, the, the
report that was
asked about is that through the
QR code that's in this
report? Ok.
And there was a yes. So
for the people
listening,
secondly, I was
interested in a
prior
panel and I asked them
a bureaucratic
question. So here's one for you
all. Uh
how long
would the UN M
Health Sciences
Center employment
process take
from the time
of
uh offering
a job and getting somebody
all the way through the
system.
And I'm only talking about UNM Health
sciences
a month, three months,
six
months,
>> Mr Chair,
Senator
Stefanik would depend
on the position.
So some will go
super fast.
Uh uh staff,
faculty who are
clinical
probably have to disconnect
for wherever they are working
and then they would have
to, depending on if they're
coming from out of state or from
another institution
in the state, they would have both
licensing and credentialing.
Uh We have
a and Doctor Richards may
be speak to it, but we have
figured out a way to
uh speed our credentialing
up. Uh and
that has helped
bring people in
uh faster, but it really
depends on like
sometimes you're recruiting a
researcher from another
institution and
they have to transfer their research
grants, et cetera, et cetera.
So um if
you had a more specific
particular group, we
might be able to say something, but
we know
that's important, we
know it's also important to bring the
family, the significant
other of the person we're
recruiting, that's
really helping
us to recruit
both faster
and better on the
people who we're
hoping to, to bring
here. But I'll ask Doctor Richards
to maybe expand
on our clinical workforce
uh speed.
>> So Mr Chair and, and
Senator Stefani, I
think the, I'm afraid
the answer still is it varies
dramatically depending on the
level of health care, the
level of employee or health care
professional that we're bringing
in. So we have, we bring
in almost 2000 new employees
a year into the clinical
delivery system. Some
of those um entry
level positions um can
happen in a matter of weeks,
some of our medical
specialty programs,
the recruitment process
and and onboarding
may take a year
and, and so it just, it
varies quite dramatically
depending on the licensure
level, um their prior
licensure status and
what level of the organization
we're bringing them in
at?
>> Thank you, uh and Mr
Chair you also
talked about
um
how we rank
or what,
how many more hospital
beds we need. So
could you uh
comment,
you know, I, I can look at the
map and all the colors
but in
terms of how many
hours or miles
from another
institution, another
hospital, what
are you recommending or what do
you in your mind? How
far away should the hospitals
be from each other? An
hour, an hour and a half,
three
hours?
>> So Mr Chair and,
and Senator Stefani. So
I, I think that that what really
drives where you can put a
hospital, um
really is the the the
number of patients that might
be in that community.
And I just also like to say that
while I've focused on
hospitals in
particular hospitals
really are often the last thing that
you should build in terms of the clinical
delivery system, really
having, you know, providers
in network and having a health
care infrastructure that's
there that then can
refer patients to the
hospital is, you
know, a very important
also part of the
puzzle. And so I think
what, what drives, what drives,
how close the hospitals are going to be
in our state are going to be,
are going to be the concentrations
of, of, of
patients and, and we
are going to be more challenged in
other states because we have such
large geographical area.
And I'd like to just also, just
to maybe take a moment to
say, um one
of the things that I think that we've,
you know, we talk about all of the
challenges and, and we've,
this is a national
problem. We are, we are
struggling with this problem just like
all of the rest of the country.
But New Mexico has done
some incredible things in
terms of helping build infrastructure,
probably the most
important. And as you
know is the health care
Access and Affordability
Act, which which
gives the resources to
those hospitals, especially
some of those more rural hospitals
to create a more stable clinical
platform by which you
can recruit health care
professionals into.
>> So to follow up, thank
you,
Mr Chair. So to follow up
on something that Senator Lopez
was talking about with Ob
GYNs, you
know, uh and I'm gonna take
Las Vegas, for example,
since that is in my
area as well as Valencia, this
might be might be
building the new hospital after
years. Um
Up in Las Vegas, there are
nurse practitioners,
the hospital doesn't
necessarily give clinical
privileges to those nurse,
nurse midwives
so that they are
operating in clinics,
the time comes and
they can do
burs without
problems. But if there's
problems, we need to uh
go on to the
physician or to the
hospital and
we should be
looking at this.
And I think we should be looking at this
in our workforce
report about
credentialing
uh across professions.
So that
if we have
a nurse, would wife a P
A as um
the representative was talking
about who could
assist but might need
to have the
credentials to,
you know, admit somebody
follow that person,
etcetera. And I hate
to date myself, but in
the old days,
professionals could
follow their
patients through the process,
even if somebody else was
working on them or taking care
of them. And
today we've kind of eliminated
that. So I just want to
throw that into the mix
in terms of this. But in your
report, you do talk about 1500
beds as
needed. And so that brought to
my
mind,
I understand you need people
to put in the beds,
but we
also have hospitals closing
because they're not getting enough people
or enough professionals.
So that's all. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator Senator
Cillo Lopez. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
I and thank you for the presentation
and also for everything you do
for New Mexico and and
health care. It's really
important and, and we value
it greatly. So
my questions. Um
I was thinking about specialists
and it may be because my mother just
recently had a specialized procedure,
but your report didn't
uh address cardiologists,
um oncologists,
orthopedic surgeons,
neurosurgeons that those
kinds of things was that beyond the
scope of the report
because I actually went to the report, I thought,
well, this is, may be the presentation.
So I went to the report and it's,
it's not there, was it just beyond the
scope of the work? >> So
Mr Chairman and
Senator
Sedillo Lopez. No,
you're absolutely correct. It
is, it is
a limitation of manpower
to just report on these
15 professions.
As I showed in one of the slides,
we had started with four professions
in 2013 and we have
gone up to 15,
but that's where we have
stopped. We do
not have the bandwidth to do
more or even
to investigate any
further. Answering a lot of
questions that you have
asked. >> You know, my
perception is that we have a shortage
of specialists and that
coupled with what I was talking before of
not being able to reach
out on the board of the state to find
specialists
through telehealth
was really a problem is
really a problem for health care
in the state.
The second thing that
I had is one of the recommendations
in the report, not not
in the presentation was to
increase Medicaid payments for
bilingual services,
which I'm very interested
in access to health. I mean
language access, be
happy to help with however
I can on that. Um But I
was just curious do
bilingual um
nurses aides,
doctors OTs others
in the system. Do they get more
pay for having
the bilingual capacity
or is the request just
for translators
or that might be two questions?
>> Yes, Mr Sherman and
Senator Ums
Lopez. I do not know the answer to that question,
but I can certainly follow up and get
back with you, >> ok.
Because I understand the need for,
you know, I'm happy to do it. I'm
just curious how you treat people
who have that
capacity.
Do you Mr
Chair, do you
know? >> So Mr
Chair and, and Senator Cio
Lopez um
for, for our licensed
healthcare professionals, we don't,
there's no different
pay differential for,
for being bilingual. Although
you raise a really important point
about wanting to support the
bilingual capacity of our healthcare
workforce.
>> And it could be, I know
um I think it was uh
representative Chavez who
talked about the
i identifying diversity
as a need and this could be a
strength that we have in the state
that you could build on, you know,
in, in looking at the strategic plan,
I didn't see, read
the whole thing, but I, I hope
that it is. Um
and then
um
in counting and looking
at the report, there's a whole
section on how people were counted
and how many hours
and, and whatever. And I
got curious
um and maybe I'm just
focused on this telemedicine
thing. Are
you identified people who don't
practice in New Mexico?
Where do all of these
individuals who have a telemedicine
license? And I don't even know how
many there are,
are they in this report at
all?
>> So, Mr Chairman and Senator
CIA Lopez, yes, the
short answer is yes. If
anybody has a
license and
they have marked more
than zero hours of working,
it can be just one hour or can
be 40 hours per week.
They have been reported
in this report. >> Do you happen to
know how many people
have gotten
the telemedia medical
license? >> So, Mr Chairman and
Senator Sadia Lopez, no,
because my data
is limited to questions that
we answered at the time of
renewing the license. So I
don't have any way to
actually find out
about that question
>> and I can ask the board,
I was curious about
that
and then,
um
I had the privilege of
giving a presentation to
your residents, the class,
the, the, the program
and what I did with, with
them, it was just how the legislature
worked or whatever. And
after, after giving the presentation,
I said, well, if you were to work
on legislation,
um that you would
want to bring to the legislature,
what would the, what would it
be? And the number
one thing that came up was
working hours for residents
even more than their salary,
which was big. But
um, so I just wanted
to share that with you
Um, because II,
I told them, hey,
this is how you do
it start, but I
actually told them to start with
your, um, with
you guys because if that's,
if you were on board with that,
it would make it a lot easier than
if a bunch of residents came
and did it. Um, so I just
want to share that with you.
Um, and I joked with
them that and that is
sort of true. I always
ask a resident before they treat me
how long they've been
off,
just make you feel better.
And then,
um,
I, I guess I also wanted
to
say that I
too was shocked
by the malpractice
um recommendation
five. I mean, it went
into detail about
venue of where
these cases would be brought
and um
getting rid of the CP
I increases in the ca just
a lot of detail. And I
thought it did feel
jarring in a report about
opening doors.
Um
And, you know, increasing
our workforce. I, I just
felt like at least the
report doesn't make
the connection
um to the extent there
is one between,
between that and the level of
detail. Obviously, it seemed to
me like some lawyer wrote it.
Um So I, I
again, it was
surprising and
um in, in future,
I don't know if you had it in last year's
report, but it
probably would be better to
tie it. So it's not just
jarring. Like,
how is this
issue um
has as representative
um Chavis said
there was no data
or anything that
tied it into the report.
So >> Mr Shama and Senator
Sadio Lopez, I'm happy to provide more
information with regard to
that uh recommendation
as I as I offered
and I'm happy to do follow up on
that. And
um but as
you know, that the report
that we have is very descriptive,
so we really do not
know why we have a shortage
or what is the retention
rate for those that they graduate
from here? You have heard the
retention based on the data that
we have from your MHSC.
So we don't have any
other things. So a lot of
recommendations are
made based on the entities
and their experience
practice and the professions.
But we can certainly be more
informative with that
recommendations being made in the
future.
>> Like I said, it, it was
jarring. Um But
again, thank you for
the report itself
is very um
very impressive.
I would have liked to see a little
bit more strategy
for diversifying
um the workforce.
Um you know, instead of just
we need doctorates
period, um
you know, bilingual doctors,
culturally competent doctors,
doctors, uh with diverse
backgrounds um because
those strategies are, are very
different. Um
But thank you, Mr Chair.
Excellent, excellent
job.
>> Thank you, Senator and thank
you all for the
presentation.
Great information. We look forward
to the report on that we'll
be getting in September
on you know, uh
this year
and um thank
you for the work. You're doing
really exciting to see
the those numbers of the
residents climbing and,
and the efforts you're making. So I
think we'll, we'll see the payoff in the
years ahead. Thank you so
much
members. We're
going to go now to
public comment, but
before we do that, we have one
quick thing you have in
your packet, the
minutes of the June meeting
that was held at the rainforest
building at UN M
and I hope you've had a chance to look
it over. Is there a motion to accept
those minutes?
We have a motion from Representative
Chavez seconded
by Representative Herndon.
Is there any debate or,
or questions on the these
minutes?
Seeing nun
will, is
there anybody in opposed to adopting
the minutes? Seeing nun will
adopt them? And we'll
move now to public comment. We have
three people from Holy
Cross Hospital that have signed
up to speak. Why don't all three of
you come up at the same time,
James Kaiser,
Doug
Freons
and Paul
Sands
to
>> don't.
>> Yes.
OK.
Yeah,
>> Mr Chair members of the committee,
I'm James Kaiser
and I have the honor and privilege
of serving the people of Taos
County and the surrounding area as
the CEO of Holy Cross Medical
Center. I'm
primarily here today to express
our gratitude to each of
you. Um
We're a challenge. We're one of the
12 rural hospitals at
risk. And
you've uh sent some
lifelines uh to the
work of Senator Bobby
Gonzale and cos sponsored
by Christine Ortez. We were able
to approach our county
uh for a groce receipts tax
that built the hospital 30 years
ago, the
county owns the
hospital and our lease
agreement with them is that we would
maintain it and we
have not been able to.
And so our communities, larger
communities stepped up with almost a
4 to 1 vote to support
us in replacing
much needed infrastructure,
repairs and maintenance
and uh past end
of life, medical equipment.
And so now I can continue to
serve um
however, that
addresses facilities.
And we've also, Senator
Gonzalez worked with you
and gar garnered your support
to help with a
medical complex as we
surveyed our community, uh
community health needs
analysis.
Um The number
one request was for urgent care
and primary care and we
met with our independent primary
care physicians
practitioners and
they said we welcome more
primary care. We cannot keep
pace with demand
and now we have
AAA problem,
a good problem to have, but one that's
difficult to manage. We're
growing our
emergency department,
staff, physicians,
practitioners are overwhelmed.
We're seeing 55 patients
every 24 hour
period. Um Our
hospital is
full
um through your help
with emergency funds, but
particularly with the Health Care Delivery
Access Act. I know there was some
discussion yesterday
about profitable
hospitals, not for profit,
large profits
as as you spoke to,
uh Mr Chair Ortiz
Pino, we
the health care safety net
in all states, but particularly
New Mexico is fragile.
And while I
appreciate the support for rural
health care,
um let's not
overlook or forget
that those large urban tertiary
hospitals are part of that
safety net, even
those that have affiliations
out of state.
Um You wisely
said that that
75% would be
spent in New Mexico.
And someone astutely mentioned
that 25%
New Mexico doesn't produce
medical supplies or medical
equipment, at least not to
the degree. So that's where that
25% would
go, but 75%
will remain in New Mexico.
I got a call the other night as
administrator on call, one of our county
commissioners had a family member in
emergency department. She had spent
two nights in our departments
department. We had no
room for her. She
had no room elsewhere. Santa
Fe Albuquerque.
Everyone was full.
Our number one transport
is psychiatric.
Our number two medical
transport, our number one
medical transport is
cardiac. So
we need these tertiary
centers to
survive
so that we can
transport to a higher level of
care. I think it's a
misnomer in our rural
communities. They assume you can be
all things to all people
and there's certain specialty care
that we just can't have the
volumes to support.
So while I appreciate your support
for rural health care, let's
remember those that are in
our urban tertiary
areas.
They too are part of that health
safety net and let's not put it
at risk. But thank you
for supporting health care for our
state. New Mexico, as
you all know, is one large community
with very long roads. We've
got to support one another.
>> So >> thank
you,
>> Mr Chairman, members of the
committee. My name is Carl
Gilmore. I'm a member of the Board of
Directors of
Holy Cross Hospital to
Health Systems. Uh
Just a couple of things quickly.
Uh One, I'm,
I've been a consumer of
our hospitals, health
care for 40
some years had five
joint replacements
at our hospital. We were able
to do some incredible
things for a small town.
But echoing
what, what James
said,
the tertiary centers
that we have, the nearest
Cath lab is in Santa
fe the transportation
system and particularly the ground
ambulance transportation
system in, in New Mexico
is tremendously stressed
and the, the
behavioral health and mental
health issues are,
are one of the major components
of that. Um
And so that, that's a piece of the
puzzle that that needs
to be addressed as well.
Thank you very much
for your
support.
>> Thank you very much. And I guess is
Mr Sense that he had to leave?
He didn't. >> That's our board
chairman, Robin Chavez is
a former nurse at Holy Cross
and owns her own hospice business.
Now she had, they both
had one o'clock meetings, but
they hope to return and hopefully
in time for public comment, but thank
you for this opportunity. Thank
you for serving all.
>> Thank you. So
next is Linda
Siegel.
Yeah,
for sure.
>> Yeah.
Is it on now? Yes. Thank
you, Mr Chair members of the committee,
Linda Siegal. I'm here for the New
Mexico Nurses Association
and you're gonna have some
nursing presentations
this afternoon, but
I just wanted to
um hand out
um the
latest
workforce
uh workforce
Solutions
department,
a list of
advertised jobs
for healthcare
professionals
and you can just look
at it at your leisure. But
some interesting numbers
pop out
registered
nurses.
There are 6700
jobs advertised
for registered nurses in
the month of May
and in the month of
April, there were
only 6017
and this list that
you'll get in a minute goes through
all the health
professions.
So you have occupational
therapists, ps
physicians,
everybody. And
these are
duplicated by
the department. The
only duplications might
be if someone gets a
job and they don't pull the
advertisement. But that doesn't
happen very often according to
the department. So it's
just enlightening to see
you've heard earlier this morning
about and yesterday
about our health care
worker shortage.
I'm sure our nursing
directors and the schools of
nursing are going to touch on
those issues too.
But just to give
you a flavor, this doesn't
mean there are 6000 V
6000 nurses
short, but it means
that >> you did you
pass, I I gave >> it to
Andrea. >> Can you pass those
out, Andy
or somebody?
>> No, >> I'm sorry. >> Yeah.
So, so anyway, it gives you
a flavor of the, of
what employers
are looking for
and for all
the health care
provider groups.
So
that's
thank you >> uh
James
Jackson
of becoming
this is where in public comment
now.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair Jim
Jackson here for disability
rights, New Mexico. And
you know, I usually do
in my comments toward the
issues that you're dealing with on
any given day, but I
actually want to tap for you,
talk to you for just a couple of
minutes about the special
session.
Um It's been a moving
target, but the governor is
still proposing a couple
of bills that would have a significant
impact on people with
mental illness. Uh
So if you do get
called in and then we're just talking
about a couple of weeks from now. If you do
get called in to a
special session, I want to bring these
issues to your attention.
Since of course, you'll
have to be dealing with these in
the special session. The
governor is proposing an
expanded definition
of who can be
committed to
mental health facilities
or services um
on an involuntary
basis. These are civil
processes and
so in determining whether a
person is dangerous
to themselves or others. And that's
kind of the key concept in
involuntary civil
commitment. Uh, the courts
would now be looking at things like,
well, can you exercise good
judgment? Can you,
um,
exercise self control
discretion?
Um, I, I,
I'm not going to observe
the behavior of
many of the people that we deal
with every day. But,
um, uh,
I, I think that's
problematic. It would
also require a showing
only of a
reasonable
probability that
you're gonna have some physical
deterioration, uh, that
would impact your
ability to care for yourself.
So, some of
us are really puzzled about what a
reasonable prob
probability
is. At least in current law
things are, have to
be shown to be more likely than
not. Um, a
reasonable, some judges
might think a reasonable
probability is 10 or
20%.
Um, uh,
and it's important to note
that these changes in definition
would apply to both
inpatient
commitment under the mental
health or DD code as well
as outpatient commitment
under our A ot
statute. The second
thing that the governor is proposing
to do is some
changes to our
competency,
uh, statute,
competency to stand
trial. Uh,
and we got involved in this
in the regular session because
this was a bill that would have given
an opportunity to divert
people. Senator
Tallman. You pointed this
out. We have so many people who are
in our criminal justice
system. Let's get them out of that
system and into
mental health treatment. Well, that's
gone. There's no, there's
no proposal in this
area on that. And
it's simply an emphasis
on either encouraging
or actually requiring
district attorneys to file
petitions to get people committed
to either inpatient or
outpatient. So
these proposals
are kind of problematic
from our perspective on their
own. But of course, again,
as many of you have
recognized,
we don't have the
facilities and the
personnel or anybody
else to actually provide
services. So if we're dumping
a whole lot of new people into
the system, we
don't have the, we don't have the
facilities or the staff
to serve them. So
we clearly have some issues
that we need to deal with. Um
But we need solutions
to our challenges
that have been well vetted,
that have been in, that have
engaged the the key
stakeholders in all
of these processes
and that simply hasn't
happened. So if the
special session does uh
occur um we'd
encourage you not to rush through
with these sorts of things,
given the time that they need,
get the relevant people
together. Let's plan
on something that will actually
work and that is
practical and that could
be implemented.
And I think that's going to take the
rest of the interim
session, a 60
day session and so on.
So, thank
you, Mr >> Chair. Thank
you, Jim. Before
we go to the next public
comment, there are two
cars parked across the
street in front of
Coronado Hall that have to
be moved. They're blocking
something or other one
is a gray
Volvo,
the other is a white
Subaru. If
you're the owner of either of
those vehicles, you do
need to move them. Apparently,
they're blocking something
crucial
and, and parked in front of
Coronado Hall across the
street.
Next public
comment is, is, and
the last one in person is
from Lex
Garcia
with the New Mexico Pharmacists
Association.
It's the one with the person on
it. >> There you go. That's
helpful. Thank you, Mr chairman,
members of the committee. I'd first
like to introduce myself. My name
is Lex Garcia and I'm the new executive
director for the New Mexico Pharmacists
Association.
Dale, I am,
that's usually everyone's first
question. Um Dale Tinker
served in this role for the past
30 years and I look
forward to the challenge of filling his
shoes. Um I
myself hold a doctor of
Pharmacy degree from
the University of New Mexico.
And so I am a licensed and
practicing pharmacist in our state.
I'm part of that 80% that
we heard earlier that graduated
from UN M and stays.
Um We've heard a lot of discussion
today around shortage of health
care workers in New Mexico, right?
But we also saw figures that really
begged the question on how we
utilize our highly trained and
highly educated pharmacist
to help expand that access.
New Mexico is on the
forefront of, of expanding
this access. We heard about collaborative
protocols and the test to treat
initiatives. And while those are great
starts, we're still
severely under utilizing
the training and the education
that our pharmacists hold.
Expanding pharmacists
scope of practice is
key to expanding health
care in our state.
Um And I'd love to discuss
specifically how we accomplish
that through legislation with anyone
who's interested. Thank
you.
>> Um If you have a
specific proposal,
that would be something that this
committee might be able
to consider for endorsement
at our meeting
at the end of November.
So you might work
with members of the committee to get
something drafted so that we
could take a look
at it with the idea of
possibly endorsing
it. Thank you so
much. Thank
you. Then we
have a couple
of people online. We'll
start with Nat
Dean.
>> Yes,
that
ok.
Yeah.
Ok.
>> Thank you very much,
Nat. And then our
final public comment
will be from Mike
macmillan.
We just lost you,
Mike.
Yes. Now you're coming through
loud and
clear.
>> Ok.
We're gonna be in Silver City,
November,
October, Mike. Thank
you so much for your comment. We're
gonna be actually the committee will
be meeting in
Silver City
in September.
So uh
perhaps while we're
in Silver City,
you might come to one of
our meetings there and, and meet with
us about this issue.
Um I know that
that there's
an effort afoot at combining
all the publicly
funded
health insurance programs,
the IBAC
programs,
um
Nipsy, the retiree health
care, the public employees and
the A PS
into a,
a unified program.
And if
this is the case, we
would want to make sure that
this does not get
included in that
new package.
Um This is a concern.
Thank you so much Mike for bringing
this to our attention.
OK. That concludes
our public comment
and we'll move now to the afternoon
agenda
and we're going to start with the health
care
authority
and we have with us
the head of the Medicaid
Program, Diana
flannery
and,
and what a lot of
dances and the medical
director, Doctor
Dans. Thank
you both for coming.
Welcome to,
to
and members there is a handout. Did
you go? Yeah, everybody got it.
Ok.
So go ahead whenever you're
ready.
>> Is that the right button? Can,
can you hear me? Ok,
Mr Chair members of the
committee. Thank you for
inviting us to talk today.
I'm Elana Dans. I
am the Chief Medical Officer
of the Medicaid program.
And um
uh this is Dana Dana
Flannery. She is our new Medicaid
director. She started in
March and
um it's been really excellent
to work with her. I'm really excited
for you to hear from her today. She has
a lot of experience in
Medicaid in another state
and was also before
that, a behavioral health provider
just is bringing a lot
of really wonderful expertise
here. So I'm gonna
start and I'm gonna do the first two
sections and then she'll take
over, I'm gonna talk
about the health care authority, just
kind of a very
high level overview,
open it up to questions
and I'll talk a little bit about turquoise
care. And then Dana is
going to talk about
our rate increases
where we are so far
and then uh about
our waiver initiatives
and where they are and then also
about CCBH
CS. So we'll give you
an update on a lot of the programs
that we're in the middle
of.
So, um I I'm
on here
on slide
three
and this is our new
mission, vision and goals
because starting yesterday,
we are the health care
authority.
So what our, our email
address has changed our
nomenclature
changed, our
structure changed.
Uh So we're just kind of
getting our feet under us with that
change. The, the big
things I want to mention uh
is that
is, is who's coming over and
kind of how we're restructured. Many
of you probably have this information,
but just a little bit of an
overview.
So every
department that is currently
or was in the human services
department stays there
because we are the department.
We're the safety net department. We're the
department that provides assistance
when people need assistance. So
nothing is moving out. But we
are bringing some other departments
in those include
developmental disability
services division,
Department of Health Care Improvement.
And then the
uh health
insurance for employees
retirees and the
health care affordability
fund. So I
think about this in
kind of two buckets of
why we moved groups
over and what that will do
for us first
bucket is greater
communication and
synergies among
departments. So
for ESD
people with developmental disabilities,
one department does the
operations and another
department does the paying
and we haven't worked in the same
group. But now, but now we
will. So we'll have a lot more
communication and that's already started.
We've been already meeting together
similarly with Department
of Health Improvement
is that that is
the group
within the Department
of Health that does licensing
and regulation. And
so again, we're the
payer and don't
always have eyes into the
safety of what's
happening in
our institutions
and now we are working much more
closely together. So I
see that as being a great
improvement,
the other bucket is to
have synergy among our
our payers.
So there will be more
people insured under
the health care authority,
which will allow us
to kind of
leverage those relationships
better uh
to potentially have
aligned quality metrics,
aligned drug lists. There's a
lot of things that are possible
when we have
more than one book of
business as far as
health
insurance.
So,
um
so we have a family story. We try to
always start with one of those.
And so this is Sonia and she
has a daughter, Matthew.
She has both physical health,
behavioral health
disease processes going
on. She's visited the
emergency department multiple
times and then Matthew
has some behavioral health
concerns.
She is coordinating
providers for both her
and her son, which includes
transportation,
scheduling, managing
appointments. And
then after her last e
day visit, a peer support
worker from AC CBHC
contacted her and scheduled an
appointment for her and her son.
So we'll come back to her at the end
to kind of see how our programs
are helping
her.
So now we are on
slide six.
So this
is just kind of going through the health
care authority, which we
talked about, we will now be
serving about 50%
of New Mexicans among our
different programs. And
this is going through all of the
different divisions
that are moving
over.
Uh The next slide is
just showing
a map and showing how
we have pretty
high enrollment of people on
Medicaid and then particularly
in the health care Authority.
And what that does for
us is allows us to have an arm
in public health. So,
um so this is just kind of showing
where we lie in relation
to other states in the country
as far as the health care
authority.
And then on slide
eight, we're just showing
our synergy between the
Behavioral Health Services
division and Medicaid,
which is already part of the Human
Services Department. But we also
think that the health care
authority will allow for
greater synergies and alignment
between behavioral health and physical
health.
OK. I'm gonna move on
to turquoise care
now.
So turquoise care, the
slides start on
slide 10.
So we have a mission and a
vision and a goal for health care
authority and we also do
for the turquoise care
program. So turquoise
care also started
yesterday. We are
moving from centennial care to
turquoise care.
And this is our, our
vision and our goals
for our new
managed service contracts
and our new waiver. So our
vision is that every New Mexico
Medicaid member will have high
quality well integrated
person centered care
to achieve their personally
defined health and wellness
goals. And then
there are three goals here
that fall into that vision.
The first one is that our
program is really meant
to look at the whole
person, which
is a combination of
many things including physical
health, behavioral
health, preventative health,
acute health, and then the social
drivers of health. And
you'll see that we have a
number of programs to try
to impact some of those
social drivers like
housing and
food. The
second goal is that our
programs uh
reimburse for
quality of care and
value rather
than just the
volume of care. So
we have a number of different value
based programs. One
that again started yesterday
with the new contract is the
primary care payment
reform. So we're really
looking to pay for primary
care in a way that
pays providers to take care
of the whole person, which
sometimes means seeing them face
to face and sometimes
means calling them on the phone
to check in, sometimes
means calling the daughter.
So, so more
wrap around care with this new
value based program for
primary care. And then our
third goal is to really
make sure to support
groups that have been historically and
intentionally left
behind and make sure that
we add additional
programs. So these groups have
equitable chances at living
healthy
lives
in our new
contract. And
um I'd say it's
mostly contract related,
but these new benefits are
also we state plan
amendments, waivers. There's kind of a
number of ways they came in,
but these are all new
programs that are
part of turquoise care.
So the first one is the
continuous eligibility
for Children up to age
six. So that means
that if a child comes on
Medicaid anytime before their
sixth birthday, they
stay on Medicaid until their sixth
birthday. They do not need to
prove income
again.
So, um and
that is trying to reduce
churn people coming on
and off, which is really when well
child visits get, get
missed. We
added some, we have some
wraparound, supported
supportive housing
programs kind of pre tenancy
and tenancy programs and it's
the same program, but we added
slots,
chiropractic services
is going
to retro back to January.
It hasn't been approved by C MS
yet, but it will be part of the
package once it's
approved,
we had a
waitlist for people who
had personal care services,
older adults
at home. And so we
added additional slots to
that program to work on clearing
the waitlist.
We already have home
visiting, but we added four new
models. We're in the process of
pricing that and
operationalize that. So
that should be starting
soon.
Two weeks ago, community
health workers are
that is now a reimbursable service.
So that has that
started.
And then we have these special
rates for
behavioral health models
that require additional
training and
additional
time and
expertise of the behavioral
health counselors.
So there,
there's kind of an enhanced rate if
people have some of that additional
training, like for example, E MD
R, if someone does
that and has that
expertise, they can bill
at a special rate. And there's
five new models for
that.
Uh So kind of
more about turquoise
care. We, our
plans are changing.
We still have Presbyterian
and Blue Cross Blue Shield.
But yesterday
unitedhealthcare and Molina
started with us. Um
we have a lot of the representatives
in the back with us. We're
very happy that they are
here to join us today.
And so,
um
this is these next few slides
are kind of about all of the enhancements
that we put into the new
contract to try
to have
the managed care organizations
deliver the best care that they
can to work in partnership with
them. And so this
triangle is just showing the
ways in which we really try
to think about this, this
problem. So we
um we have increased
financial accountability,
more reporting
and penalties potentially
with, depending on what we
find in the reporting,
we have enhanced operational
requirements. So we
had the MC OS were
required to have certain kinds of
staffing with certain kinds of
expertise. We have a lot
of additional requirements among
care coordination, which
has been something that's been brought forward
by this group and many groups
of concern. And we heard
you when we make, we make significant
changes to care coordination
in this contract and then we
have specific programs for underserved
populations.
These next two slides
are showing a
number of ways that the new
contract is different than the old
contract.
So, um first
one is about
reimbursement
in the past,
the, the
rate the fee for a
service was completely
negotiated between managed
care and the
um provider. So
starting not this last year, but
the year before we have a floor, we
have a fee schedule.
So that, that is part of
the contract. Now,
as far as performance
penalties, we
put a lot of time into
thinking about what our performance measures
were to align with
the legislature to
align with C MS, look
at our
populations that need
a little bit of a
additional
oversight and
um kind of
attention. And
so we, we redid our performance
measures and there is
more of a penalty
than in the last contract
for not
meeting those performance
measures. We
also, we have these things
called delivery service
improvement performance targets,
which is a mouthful. Has
the acronym discept is
also doesn't sound that easy to
say, but that
is kind of us
directing the MC OS to
to to pay attention to certain
certain things. So we have
one that's about pharmacy
about utilizing
pharmacists more.
We have one about hepatitis
C, about
transportation
and about personal care
services in the home.
So if they don't meet those targets,
there is also a
penalty with within
the capitation,
we have a the highest
medical loss ratio ratio in
the country, which means
that the amount that has
to go directly to the care
of patients and members
is is
90%. So very
small amount can go to
administrative
functions.
We have requirements
for community investments.
That's something we just tried in
the last year
where we can say, you
know that this amount of the
profit has to actually be returned
to the community in these forms
in these ways. And so it
allows us to bolster
some of the services in the
community that aren't exactly
Medicaid reimbursable
services and support
them. Uh
We have a
population which
is perinatal members,
pregnancy to one year,
postpartum.
That is a delegated
care coordination model,
meaning that
that administrative
funding that goes to
the MC OS for care
coordination needs to be
given to community-based
organizations to do that
work. So that is,
that is new, that is just
starting yesterday. And so we've
been working on the details of
that and then we
have just as
far as care coordination in general,
a number of auto enrolled
populations where
they, they automatically
get care coordination, they
automatically go into a certain
level of oversight
rather than needing
to do a specific
survey or test
to get into that level.
And we also streamlined
those forms, we made them much
shorter and all the
MC OS will be using the same
forms. So,
so pretty
different program than
the last
model.
As far as network
adequacy,
we have many more
categories that we are
going to be looking at
particularly
pediatric. So, you know,
in the last contract, we'd say how many
pediatricians are in a county.
And now we say, well, how many pediatric
cardiologists are in the county?
How many pediatric
rheumatologists,
pediatric neurosurgeons.
So much more specific
information about who is
where in the
state. Uh
We have
as far as distance
standards. In the last contract,
it was geo mapping like looking
at a map from the top and how
far the crow flies. Now
it's how far it is to
drive to the place.
Uh We have uh
appointment standards.
You know, if you call on the phone, how long
does it take to get in that
needs to be done with secret shoppers
that's been tightened up quite a
bit. Uh
So, and then
the last thing is that we were putting
all Children in state custody
in the same plan so that
we have ability to have
more oversight over that very
vulnerable
population.
And that is where I am going
to turn it over to Dana and she's going to
talk about the Medicaid
rates.
>> Good afternoon everyone. Dana
Flannery Medicaid director here for New
Mexico. It's a pleasure to be with
you all. Mr Chair members of the
committee
can't hear me.
All right,
my voice usually carries a little too
much.
How about now?
Good.
Ok, I'll speak
up.
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about
rate increases. But before I
go into that, I just want to
weigh in on a little bit of what
Alana Danzas already
mentioned. It has been
such an exciting time. It's been
my first four months here.
It has been a really
serious intense ride
uh whether it was
changing from centennial care
to turquoise care and doing
readiness for that at rapid
speed as
well as preparing
for the changes to the health care authority
and some super exciting
negotiations for our
1115 waiver that I'll get
to talk to you about today.
So it has been a very, very
busy for months and I
am so wildly impressed
with this Medicaid team.
It is a very small but
mighty team. And so I just
wanted to take a moment to thank
them and all their hard work
and exhaustion over this past year,
but definitely these last four
months and so
had to do that, that shout out
first and then I want to thank
everyone here in the room. So
whether I'm speaking to you directly
or you're just here to hear
about Medicaid and learn about
Medicaid in a state like
New Mexico where Medicaid has such
a huge influence on
health care overall
and well being of
people. It is so
important to pay attention to
Medicaid and what Medicaid is doing
for the state and for the the
members here,
I am a very member centric
person by nature.
I have had love wasn't in the
system and
I try and think of everything
that we do from these very
exciting rate changes
all the way down to
how care coordination is dealing
with a pregnant mommy
in a hospital and what that looks
like. And so I
will try and come at everything
with that vantage point
because that's why we're all here doing
what we do.
So now to the rate
increases, which
everyone's very excited and it's
been so wonderful to watch the energy
around the rate increases and the
true investments that you all
have helped make into the
system here and
really valuing all these people
doing this incredibly hard
work to make people
healthier and
thrive in their lives.
Whether that's behavioral health,
social determinants of health
or their physical health.
A lot of my journey
in the Medicaid world has been
for integration and really looking
at people as whole people.
We don't walk around with only
half of ourselves at any one given
time. We show up with our whole selfs
and everything that's going on with us
and whatever has
happened to us before we arrived
at that day. And
so I really enjoy
working in a system where that
is honored and focused
on and worked on.
So to get to down to
some of these rate changes,
as you can see on the right hand
side, first, really looking at
the energy from legislative
initiatives, pushing
more than half of this
influence as well
as the spend also having influence
by membership growth.
We go to the left hand
side, we look at 2019
and 2020. Do
not worry, I will not read every
single one of these rate changes to
you. I think you're wildly
familiar with the ones that have already
occurred, but just in case
some to really highlight
increased rates for personal care
services and assisted
living
um
adding supportive housing to
centennial care and now that that's
flourishing even more in turquoise
care. And
2022
donor milk increased
reimbursement rates for public duty,
nursing and home health services.
And as Alana mentioned
earlier, the continuous
eligibility for
pregnant women for one year
postpartum. That is a
huge difference in what that
coverage looks like for that mom and
that baby.
So going on
to 2023
looking at some expanded
access for orthodontia,
looking at mobile crisis
services,
looking at different enhanced
behavioral health services.
Uh five new evidence
based practice services that are
just called out specifically
because of the extensive training
that they take in the specialty and
they need to be reimbursed as
such in order to make
the providers viable to do those
specialty services.
Some for example, to
treat very severe
post traumatic stress disorder
such as E MD R.
So
then going into July 1st
of 2023
increase reimbursement for
maternal and child health,
primary care and
behavioral health from
90 to a minimum
of 100 and 20% of
Medicare. This was
really exciting to watch from a
state outside of New Mexico at
the time. Um as
it was becoming a requirement
for many waiver negotiations
across the country in
order for them to get
what they wanted in their waiver, they had
to start moving in this direction
in New Mexico kind of
beat a lot of the states
as to how fast they
were implementing these rate increases.
So very exciting
to see adding
coverage for services provided
by community health workers
again, as you heard
earlier today and as we continue
to discuss the
workforce really
looking at what we can do to
broaden the workforce and what
can we do to leverage
other specialties
and other diverse
workforce tactics
in order to address member
needs,
raise reimbursement for DD
waivers and
then January 1st
2024 new
home visiting models
as Alana already mentioned that
continuous eligibility from
0 to 6 that
can truly transform a
kiddo's trajectory in their
early childhood
and have a strong, strong
impact on the support they can get
in their early development in order to
stay engaged in services,
getting on and off
Medicaid multiple
times from 0 to 6 can have
a truly detrimental
impact on a
child and a family's
engagement services. And so
that will be prevented
with this
expansion of supportive housing
services to more people,
expansion of community benefit
slots for our long term
care individuals
and then having legally
responsible individuals
as caregivers as you may have seen
nationally
that was definitely
something that was brought to
light throughout the pandemic, is
that workforce that was untapped
prior. And
if any of you have ever cared
for your loved ones, I'm sure you
know that you're gonna give the
best care to your own loved
one. And so if you can be
reimbursed for such
that is also another strategy
to enhance the workforce, but
really honor the family
dynamic.
So, uh and then
lastly, the chiropractic
coverage
benefit.
So kind of what we're in
progress of and what we're
ahead. Um
Doula and Lactation
Counselor services. It
has been just
wonderful to watch the work
in maternal health here.
Um We have been able to participate
with health and human services on a
maternal health national
project and looking at all
that we already had underway and
all we plan to do to
continue to move
the outcomes for maternal health
morbidity and mortality.
So looking at doulas and
lactation counselors,
then professional dispensing
fees to our
community pharmacies
and then also waiver rate
increases for
individuals living with
a developmental disability.
Also ahead of us is the rate
increase for FQH
CS. So in addition
to that annual me I
increase that they're always subject
to the other rate
increase that, that we are looking to
do. And then in
January 2025
really looking to increase
reimbursement rates for
primary care, behavioral
health and maternal health of 100 and
50%
of Medicare
and then maintaining the existing
reimbursement rates at or
above 100% for all
others uniform
percentage increase for phase
three. So keep in
mind when states
continue to make this
evolution for
the equivalent of Medicare,
there are codes that exist in the
Medicaid space that
don't have an equivalent Medicare
and therefore, they can be untouched.
And so if you're a behavioral health
provider, that could be the
largest book of business,
right? Or the codes that haven't been
touched yet, as well
as the fact that if you're a behavioral provider
that primarily serves
Medicaid, you would
not have necessarily
received an
increase. And so making sure that
we round that
out rate
parity for nonphysician
providers to be reimbursed as
the same as a physician.
So on the physical health and
behavioral health side, a
million general fund
to provide a rate differentials
for the rural preceptors
over 11 million
for additional directed
payments to the 20 smallest
hospitals and
then uh forthcoming
subject to C MS approval
depending on what occurs
with the I have high hopes
for these waiver approvals
looking at those services
as well. And a lot of that
will be bringing in services
that were not previously
covered in certain
settings or just services
that were not
covered.
Ok.
So on the next slide, I like
to talk about rate increases
about what they actually
do for individuals
because a lot of attention
is made with rate increases
without talking about what's the outcome
that we intend to see because there has to
be accountability to
balance out the rates and
the monies that are put into the
system. And
so just for
an example on primary care
provider rates,
we expect to retain and
expand the number of PC
PS as we
increase those rates. So that's
just an outcome that we would be looking
to assess as
we continue, those rate
increases. Also
opening up provider options
to members and especially in rural
areas or for those that use
FQH CS. So
again, expanded access,
attracting more workforce
here, attracting more providers.
Then if you're looking
at maternal
mortality rate for women
over the age 35
we have double the national
average. So
really prioritizing those
maternal health and child
rates will increase
and of course, adding different provider
types to broaden that continuum
of what kind of support mom and baby
could have.
Then with the rate increase for behavioral
health providers, you
would expect improved
access to services.
So access can look like does it
exist in the first place?
And then it can also look as can
I get in when it is still valuable
to me? So if
you have ever been around anyone
that is struggle struggling with substance
use disorder or lived with
someone, you know, you have
like maybe a 22nd
window, maybe a 20
minute window on a good day, maybe
a 20 hour window. But that's your
window and
if you miss that window
and you miss that chance for intervention
that can be gone for quite some
time. And so really making sure
that we have that timely
access to care
and that too also adding services
such as mobile crisis,
then the 20 smallest
hospitals receiving
those monies, which again
is a long term investment
and then also the HDA A
program to invest in
services in the communities.
Then individuals with
living with a disability
will experience improved access
to care and providers
should experience greater stability
through that reimbursement increase
as well. So
just kind of showing the other side
of what rate increases
should look like and how
they will be monitored for
efficacy.
So on to my
very exciting topic
for the 1115
waiver updates.
So you really have
two main vehicles to
influence your Medicaid program.
You have the waiver and the State
plan, state plan is
how you're falling in line
and how you're effectuating what they
already require of a Medicaid
program, the waivers, how
you want to do things differently.
And it's not necessarily in
alignment with how you
know Medicaid was structured.
So the waivers where you get to be
creative
and they're called waiver
demonstrations
and they're called waiver demonstrations. For
a reason. You are truly to be
demonstrating a
hypothesis.
You are to say, for example,
I'm gonna use my favorite justice
involved if I
provide services before
someone is released for incarceration
their likelihood of
using those services will go
up, their
likelihood of per se overdose
would go down
and their likelihood of
very expensive
intervention such as
ed and hospitalizations
would also go down. That's just
three examples for, for one
waiver. So when you make
that waiver agreement with C
MS, you end up coming out with
these things called special terms and
conditions. And it's how they're going to
monitor what you're
saying that you're gonna do in the waiver and
then you're subject to a third party
evaluation.
So again, that these
demonstrations can be really
creative. That's
where integration
has been found in many
states. That's where a
lot of housing initiatives have been
found in many states.
And we are
one of seven
states that just became a
part of a learning collaborative
for the waiver around justice as
we continue our negotiations.
So um
shout out to all of the people on the
team that made that happen, get that
approval. So
in 2024 earlier, we
had approval for parts
of what our waiver already was
in. There were some stuff
that the national lens
was still looking at and they were trying to
come up with templates because so
many states had similar
waivers being negotiating
at the same time. So they have to figure
out some guardrails as to how they're
going to implement this fairly
across different states. So the
ones that were already approved continuous
eligibility, Medicaid
reimbursed home visiting for pregnant
and postpartum
supportive housing expansion.
That was an enrollment increase
for a program that the state already
had then
expanding availability of
community benefit slots for long
term care. Again,
as I mentioned earlier, legally
responsible individuals as
caregivers,
the environmental
modification benefit
limit increase. And again,
that allows people to stay in their
own homes for a much
longer period of time in many
cases. So very important
and then transition services
benefit limit increase. So
also in alignment with that least
restrictive environment.
So if we can give people the proper
support to be in the least restrictive
environment and remain in their community
for as long as is
medically appropriate and they
desire
then the ongoing
negotiations. So
hoping to wrap these up in the
next month, think
we're close. It's
been a long one is the
justice involved, pre
releases region services.
So again, right now,
today, Medicaid
can't pay for services
while someone's in a carceral
setting. So jail,
prison, you just cannot
pay, there's a limit
there. And so
what that looks like on the day you're
exiting is not
pretty at
all. And if you've
ever talked to individuals that have
gone through that once, twice,
20 times, it
is so scary,
so painful,
very abrupt
and it comes down to the hierarchy
of needs often which
is OK. I might
need food and
I need to fall in line with
probation or parole and I
need to stay out of
that setting, but
everything else can go to the wayside
and you can see people that haven't
seen a
physician in, in quite a long
time or they haven't tended to their behavioral
health or they stop whatever care they
were receiving and they were
doing well with. And so
this should be very
transformative for all of
those individuals. And so it will
allow for Medicaid
reimbursement for
covered services.
And so once that waivers
approved, there's gonna
be somewhat of a runway
for us to do an implementation
plan and that would be
subject to budget
availability. Um
If we were to go beyond the
original ask which
a lot of states have done.
And so as these negotiations
have been somewhat
elongated across the
country, it has allowed for states
to oppress for more coverage,
more opportunities, more
whole person health.
So that is justice
involved
and then medical respite
for homeless individuals. So
really looking at individuals
that are experiencing
homelessness and what that's like to
try and have your medical
care. And so
especially if you have a very
severe condition where
if you don't have a home, it's going to be
very rough for care for what
can you do in order to
have respite, have
your medical treatment,
then um home
delivered meals for pregnant
members. So really again,
going back to that larger maternal
health strategy
as to what can we
do to
better the outcomes for moms
and babies and what does
that look like? And we
can think that food is pretty
simple, but for those
of us that have had Children,
it can be very, very
difficult to get your basic needs
met sometimes. And so
if you are
dealing with many comorbidities
on the physical health and behavioral
health, while trying
to, you know,
have a healthy pregnancy
and live your life
food can, can
be a big deal to
you and having that delivery.
So looking forward to that as well
as home delivered meals
for the community
benefit. Um
I should also mention with pregnant
members looking for certain co
occurring disorders where food
would almost act as medicine.
So for example,
if I was a pregnant
person living with gestational
diabetes and what that
looks like and how it would be
very complicated if I didn't
have appropriate nutrition
and then lastly additional
expansion items for support
of housing. Um
so some provider expansion
and really looking at pre tenancy
and tenancy services
often when we have the conversation
about individuals experiencing
homelessness, we lose sight of
how they got there in the first
place,
right? They may have had
a home at one point
and what happened could
we have had an intervention that
allowed them to maintain their home in the
first place? And
then also going back to
my Curci example,
you do need to find a place to live
when you get out. And what does that
look like? Do you have the skill set
to learn how to go find a
place? You're also
dealing with some other stuff on your
background check. That's going to make everything
just that much more tough for
you. So really, what can we
do in that pre tendency, tendency
to help people find viable
housing and
not be
experiencing
homelessness?
Ok. Now I'm gonna move
on to CCB
HCS, which is a
mouthful
um so certified
community Behavioral health
Clinics.
So in alignment
with looking at integrated
health, sometimes
we fall short when we're
just doing very narrow
primary care or very
narrow behavioral health care.
And the CCBHC
models are specially designated
clinics that provide
a large range
of outpatient mental health
substance use disorder
and primary care screening
services and it's
across the lifespan.
So if any of you all have ever worked
with transitioned aged
youth, 17
to 18 is also a
not fun part
of life. It's a very exciting because
you might be, you know, be becoming
your own guardian. But at the
same point, you may
be changing what services look
like entirely to you. It
is often that children's behavioral
health and adult behavioral health is
experienced entirely
different. And if you have multiple
family members all receiving,
which is common
if you're all going to the same
clinic and you're all arranging the
same transportation to the same
place that just lessens some of the
barriers that we
don't often think about. But
that people experience so kind
of going back to that family story that
Alana mentioned that
woman is driving all
over the place for her
and her child to multiple different
places. And so the
CCBHC model,
you may be thinking, oh, this is kind
of like an FQHC and a
similar uh in
payment and in really
that robust what
they cover and what they're responsible
for. So they're to
provide access to integrated
evidence-based substance use
disorder and mental health services.
And it includes a 24 hour
crisis response and
medication assisted treatment
where inappropriate
they have to serve anyone that walks through their
door, regardless
of their diagnosis or entrance
status. So again,
if you can think about how
that may be perceived,
right? If you are aware of
that and you know of that,
oh, often people perceive
barriers about their care that don't
truly exist, right? They may
not know what Medicaid gets them.
They may not know what
their in like what their insurance
covers, what covered services
exist. So if I know that there's
a place in my community where
I can go and it doesn't matter my
insurance status and it doesn't
matter if I have
an appointment and they have to take
me that is just a, a
really nice thing to watch
play out. And as you've seen some of your
neighboring states play out with
CCBH CS. It's been quite
successful. There's been a
big uptick in
uh engagement and care.
They have to meet very stringent
criteria regarding timeliness
of access, quality reporting,
staffing and coordination with
social services, judicial
and education systems.
So, if we really want to talk about
whole health and health-related social
needs, the connection to
the justice system, the connection
to the education system,
all of that is a requirement of
how they exist. They're
funded through a flexible
perspective, payment
system. You may know that as
PPS and that's
to support the cost of their
expanding services.
So again, as members are
taking up more services
and seeking more services and
receiving more services,
they can have adjustment to
that PPS rate as a result of
delivering more services.
So it's a very uh self
reinforcing model there, the
more you deliver, the more your
PPS goes.
So there were a lot of pathways
to becoming AC CBHC
and we were one of 10
states to get the demonstration.
And so very, very excited
to have gone through path.
One
again,
10 states
in 2024 were
funded and
there's new states added every two
years.
Ok. Next
slide.
So in 2024
CCBHD Medicaid
demonstration. So again, we
were competitively
selected for a
fouryear
federal Medicaid
demonstration
program,
it authorizes the Medicaid
coverage for payments
and we actually got an enhanced
federal fund for
it. So
we have six provisionally
certified CCB HCS
eligible to enter. And I
believe we have one more in the queue
as of last week.
So very, very excited
to see these providers
show interest in this type of
service delivery and really understand
how much it can transform their
community and the
people that really need to receive their
care.
So let's look at our
implementation timeline
for these
clinics. So we
did our demonstration
application and the
provisional certification and we
drafted the PPS
rates.
We do not any longer
have to draft that spa
because we were awarded the demonstration.
That was our plan B
if we did not get the
award. So credit
to all of those including
Doctor Bonham at UN M
as well as
Alex Herrera that helped
to write the
demonstration to
get that win.
Then in June, the
C MS notice of demonstration
and we do not need the spa.
And then in July doing the
advanced learning collaborative
looking towards September to
finalize those PPS
rates for whatever
cohort we have at that time, whether
it's the six or the seven.
And then in October, providing a
supplement and a letter
of direction to our managed care
organizations
and aligning
for a November
full CCBHC
certification process which
would give us an implementation
of 11 of
25.
So
very, very exciting for
New Mexico. And I know that this has
been quite a long
journey here. I think there were was
an a demonstration
application before this round
as well. So this one
was successful and very
excited. Uh just a
resource on this for
you is the
CCBHC under
the New Mexico Recovery
Project. So NM
recovery.org,
you can look at the program
overview, the
certification criteria,
the code list of what they're
able to build
provisional cert process
as well as we
have uh in draft right
now and soon to be live
fa Qs for all of the,
the questions that we're getting
pretty often and very
understandably because this is a big
evolution. Uh
So with that, I conclude
my pre oh no, I have my family
story, sorry about
that.
So this family story
is really to
help
show what AC
CBHC can do to
change the trajectory of someone
that is having a very tough
time navigating
services for both
themselves and
their child. And
so with
after 11 of
25 what we would
predict for Sonia
and Matthew is that
they will receive the majority
of their care through that
CCBHC.
So primary care screening,
single care coordinator,
the CCBHC would coordinate
with their specialty
providers. They
would provide services in home
as needed and
they would also coordinate that
transportation. So the person
that I'm going face to
face with on the regular
is the person that I'm going to be working with.
I'm not calling someone that I don't know
who they are. I don't know what they look
like, maybe don't understand them
very well. I don't have
that rapport about with them that would
be transforming and
changing
Sonia in this instance is
receiving counseling, family
support and
medication intervention
and she hasn't visited the ED
the whole year.
They both have a crisis and safety
plan and they know how
to call for 24 7
crisis services,
365 days a
year. So at any
time when Sonia is feeling
overwhelmed or feeling like
she can't support Matthew properly
or keep him safe, she
has that ability to have
on site crisis
care. Matthew
also is receiving counseling,
E MD R and family
support and he
gets in home visits and
they work with his schools and his
teacher and they've
really adapted his
environment for a sensory,
friendly and safe environment for
him. So he's thriving in
school. So that
is where Sonia and
Matthew can go with
CCBH
CS.
>> Did you want to give us an update
on the
unwinding?
>> I put that there as an appendices
because I figured people might ask. So
I'd like to refer to the numbers
because don't always have
them memorized,
but happy to give that if you'd like
that.
Do you want to
do?
So? The unwinding was
completed April
2024.
So again, looking for
timely Medicaid
applications and renewals,
we had a little over
300,000
individual Medicaid closures
between March of
23 and April and
24.
So some of those
closures, upwards of 100 and
35,000 almost
have re enrolled in the Medicaid
program. And the
highest re enrollment rates were
among adults and
home and community based waiver
programs,
flexibilities implemented
to make the renewals easier.
So renewing eligibility
for beneficiaries with incomes
at or below 100%
of the FPL. So the
federal poverty level
renewing individuals based
on their snap eligibility,
reinstatement of members procedurally
closed, who are redetermined eligible
within 90 days.
Reinstating, most of
the individuals enrolled
in ad D waiver
program
reinstating eligibility for
Children 0 to 6.
That's pending C MS
approval. We had
requested for them to
reinstate
the kiddos 0 to
6 simply because we
obtained continuous eligibility
and that would be a logical group
to, to reinstate.
Uh and we are nearing
the end of those negotiations
and I remain hopeful.
So again, um our
request was for for
0 to 6. And so we'll,
we'll look to see which Children
are reinstated and >> would
that be automatically,
you could do that automatically or
they would have to come in and
reapply >> it would be
an auto. So it would be for those
that were procedurally
disenrolled that
are in that category.
So keep in mind, some of them
would >> have older than
six.
>> So we'll see how that
plays out,
but hoping for at least 0
to 6 and potentially
more.
>> Ok. How about that institutional
care? The 956
people that
didn't get re
enrolled that
were, I'm assuming that's
nursing
homes.
>> I can take that back and
>> I don't know what that is. I mean,
what happened to them? Do they get
booted out of the nursing
homes?
>> No, I don't believe people could
booted out of the nursing homes.
>> That would be good to find out if you can
check on that. What happened
to that?
Ok. Well, thank you. This
is a terrific report.
Lots of good information.
Um
Just one quick question before I
turn over to the rest of the committee,
the
CC BHC
six of them approved.
Are you going to add more? Is there a
possibility of adding more
or are we stuck with that because
of the demonstration nature?
Could we could keep adding in
parts of the state that aren't covered?
Now, >> Mr chair
members of the committee, yes, there's an
intention to add more typically
with the demonstration, you
start with those that are have
already interest and
ready and then you continue
to grow that the
ultimate goal would be the
entire state to have coverage
in different catchment areas and
zones and similar
to what Alana had mentioned about
the time and distance standards.
You would utilize
those to look at how
far the catchment area could go
depending on rural
frontier or
urban?
>> Ok. Members of the
committee, let's start, let's
start with the Senator
Sido Lopez since we
ended with her last time.
And we'll proceed in that
direction this time.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you for this excellent presentation.
It's really exciting and
lots of exciting things
happening. I, I
don't know if you were here
for the report, the UN
M um
health care workers report
one of the recommendations
and you probably received a copy
was to increase Medicaid
payments for care with language
access. I don't,
is that something that's on
your radar screen for the
uh demonstration or
what it, what's it called
the
uh
the waiver program?
>> Uh uh
Senator Cio
Lopez, we do actually have
some funding in the budget
for this upcoming
fiscal year. So we anticipate
having a differential
for
bilingual
providers starting in
January. >> Excellent.
And is that gonna be, is that gonna
be tied
to the cost
of service or the
cost of
like giving people who are
bilingual like an
ot
extra or,
or is it just for interpreters
or how is it going to work? >> It doesn't have
to necessarily be for interpreters.
So we in
general, most of the rate
increases are starting in January
rather than July
last year
trying to kind of do
this analysis of
what to do with these
rate increases by July
was, was really challenging. So
this gives us another six months to
really examine
our reimbursement structure.
It could be a modifier
on a code. I mean, there's,
there's, there's different ways to do
it. We're kind of just starting
those conversations but
but that is anticipated.
>> Excellent. So it's nice
to see the task force
make a recommendation and it
already be on the
on the radar screen
and related to that.
Um I was
thinking with the
C
oh God, I have too many
with the
CCBHC,
the yeah, those clinics.
Um
it says people without
insurance, without their status,
insurance status. Does this
also include immigrants?
Would this
also
because would that be paid with state funds
or how would that work?
>> Mr Chair
Senator?
So there's a little nuance to
that. So they have to accept
everyone and bring everyone in the
billing for Medicaid would
be for those eligible for
Medicaid. So it's
a little >> so they would be
so would they somehow
be supported with other grants
or other sources
potentially income >> to
potentially? But I think
also when you're building
rates, especially when you're building PPS
rates, it's based on
what, what services you
delivered. So
that is something that we would be
working out the details of
in our demonstration proposal.
>> The, the only reason I say
that is because in
Lase Citterio,
I was the executive director there for
three years and
I um
we didn't even, we didn't deal
with Medicaid because so
few of our clients were
eligible
and that was
fine. I mean, we didn't have
to hire somebody just to deal with
with that billing process.
Um So we had to find grants
and private raise private
funds to pay for those
services and, and
we were able to do that.
Um And I just hope that you
keep that in mind
when you dealing with
individuals who are not eligible
for Medicaid, who
have health care needs and whose
Children, especially
mixed status families,
because what happens
is the child
might be eligible, but then
other members of the family might
not and they won't seek
services
because of fear.
And so if you know, that's
something that I think is really important
to keep in mind, um,
as you do this. But thank you, that's
also very
exciting.
And,
um,
this, um,
on, on the, on
page, what
is it? 15,
the single MC O for Children
in state custody?
I've raised this
before because
so many of these kids are on other
programs. In fact, now it looks
like all of them will be because Presbyterians
are not going to be a provider.
Is that correct? And so
they, most of the
kids will have
other programs
will be on other
health
insurance programs
or,
and then they're gonna,
if they come into state
custody, that means their foster
parents are going to have
to, you know, move all the
records, get a new,
um, physician
and whatever. So
I'm kind of concerned about
that. Is there anything
that can be done about that
when I raised it at
an earlier hearing? I actually
got calls from people saying
yes, that was absolutely
right. I'm glad you raised it.
So it even may seemed
more important than my
idle kind of
seeing that, seeing it on
the as a problem.
>> Sure, Mr Chair Senator,
it's a great question
and we took heart
to what you said at the last
meeting that we
had and we've created a one pager
to really help educate around
the requirements for the single
state health
plan for Children in state
custody, but also what those transitions
look like and what the transition requirements
are there,
there were pros and cons
right to leaving it with every single
plan and and
then also the pros to
putting it with a single.
I think some of the logic behind
it is really having a
consolidated provider
network. And then also
thinking about some of these Children
that are navigating some of the toughest
situations, some
of them placed out of state,
some of them um
really having a tough time navigating
multiple
placements and what that
looks like for them. And so having
that continuity of care, having
that really intense
focus on the care
coordination requirements of the
plan, including
doing out of state
visits and
making sure the care coordinator is
laying eyes on the individual. Even
when they're not placed within the state.
It made sense to
have that network focus,
that care coordination
focus and really that
enhanced training and understanding
of what it is like to be a
child in state custody
as well as what it is like to
support a child that
is in the state custody
system. And so
we will be paying very, very close
attention to these
transitions
leading up to this
transition for every
child that was moving
from one
of the other plans to
Presbyterian as a result
of this, we monitored
on a weekly basis. And I
just really do want to give credit
to all the clinicians that spend a
lot of time uh
poring over every single
detail of the Children to make
sure that that transition went
appropriately.
And uh
again, there's a small
caveat, right? Because
if you are a child
that is Native American, you have the
opportunity of any managed care or free
for service. But outside
of that, um it will be
Presbyterian and the
requirements are very, very
stringent around their network,
adequacy and care coordination
for these Children. And
we'll be working very closely
with other state
agencies as well as them
directly to monitor these Children
in a more narrowed focus
>> and the foster parents >> and
the foster parents that have
required around that, >> that's
who I heard from. And
the
attitude I got from them was
this is administratively convenient
for the agency, but it's
very difficult for us to
have to navigate, you know, this
kid had as a card
from 11
health care provider. And
then we have to figure out that
because the child doesn't
remember who the doctor is. So they've
got a, it's a real
big time suck
to, to do that on
the foster care end.
And that's the kind of feedback
I got after I made that
statement. Um So
I do hope, how are you gonna
monitor Mr Chair?
How are you gonna monitor
that? I mean, it sounds
like you understand the problem,
but then how are you gonna monitor, monitor
whether these Children actually do
make the transitions and,
and how long and how much
time it took the foster care parents
to deal with it,
>> Mr Chair Senator. It's a great
question. So there's
a multi different ways that
we will be monitoring that.
And we have already had Presbyterians
start to engage all of the
TFC providers,
foster providers in order to have
those covers therapeutic
foster care
to really make sure that there's an
understanding. But really the
switch in the enrollment
should be automatic once they
show up in state custody
in the system. So there
shouldn't be work to switch the
plan. It's just really
making sure that we honor the
providers. If the child is
staying with their providers and
working with Presbyterian,
they likely would have that provider
in their network. But in the instance that
they don't, they have the ability to
do a single case agreement to
have continuity of care for the
member. >> Ok. Because that's
something I understood
from at least one
horror story was that
Presbyterian didn't
accept some of the
providers that this child had been
seeing.
So that's
great if it Presbyterian
will and
maybe that's like their past
experience and this would be
better,
>> Mr Chair Senator. That would be
ideal. Yes, that they would explore
continuity of care first.
They do have to prove network
adequacy, so they have to have
that same service
able to be provided.
>> Thank you, Mr. Just to
follow up on that, I had
understood that
under turquoise
care,
the state was gonna be doing
the certification
of, of, of
providers
and that it was not going to be left
up to each individual MC
O to determine
who the providers and their
networks were gonna be. But that
there would
be,
if you're certified to
provide a blue cross
enrollee,
you are certified to serve
any of the enrollees. Isn't that the
case? That's not the way it's going to
work. You leave
it up to them again to continue
doing this
quadruple
paperwork.
>> Mr Chair. That's an excellent question.
I think there's a distinction to be made
to become a Medicaid registered
provider with Medicaid.
And then you have the credentialing and
contracting process with the managed
care organizations
and you as a provider
have the right to
contract with all the
right to say I don't want
to. And then the same
really is looking at it from
the other lens, from the managed care
organizations. They have
to fulfill network adequacy
so they have to have all covered
services
covered.
>> I I'm,
I'm still worried about
this as a problem. I'm glad
that you're aware of it
and I hope it doesn't
turn out to be as
burdensome as these parents
are expecting it to
be.
>> II, I am
so sorry that you just
said that because I have been
going around saying, oh, this is
great turquoise care.
We're not gonna have providers
having to go to Blue Cross
and United and
Presbytery and
Molina each
time to get into their
networks, the
state will set up the network
and if these people want a
contract for as
MC Os, they'll accept any
of the, I mean, it doesn't
really make a lot of sense
to any of us. We've never
understood why we do it the way we
do it. And I thought you were
changing that, but you're
not, you're apparently leaving
it up to the
MC Os to decide which
providers they want to contract
with, which creates a
situation where a provider
locates in
Socorro
and they open their
door. And the first
three clients to come in the door
are Blue Cross people
and this provider
is only certified by
unitedhealthcare and so they
can't see them and we haven't
helped at all.
Isn't there any way the state
can just take over that
function of
saying if you're a
Medicaid
provider,
any of the three of the four.
Now, MCO have
to accept
you
can, we can't we do that, do we have
to change our plan or
change our laws? How do
we make that happen? Because it's
just an incredibly
unnecessary
burden.
>> Um Mr Chair.
So I think
that
there,
we're getting closer
to what you're looking for,
but I mean, you're
making what you're saying
is accurate. I I
want to put
a little bit more, there's kind
of like steps in between.
So um
we do have in the contract
single credentialing, it
is not ready to roll out
today, but it will
roll out during turquoise
care in the
next year to two
years because of
systems. So that will
mean that there's one entry
point, there's one set of
paperwork for all of
them so
that it will
be enrolling in Medicaid. That's
step number one and the single
credentialing, that's step number
two.
However,
that, that's from a paperwork
perspective, reducing the administrative
burden, but there's still
the,
the MC Os can still select
who is part of their network,
that part didn't change in the
contract.
The arm that we have
is this enhanced reporting
requirements and
enhanced
network adequacy
requirements that would
lead to if there
weren't enough if for
example, there's three
physicians in Socorro County
that do this one Socorro that do
this one service
and we're requiring there to be
four. Then
when we get the report that says there
isn't network adequacy, then
we do
a corrective action plan or a sanction
relating to that. So it's a little
bit, I, I still
see your point but I just wanted to give
those extra pieces of
nuance.
>> Ok? I I'm gonna be
82 years old next
month. I would like to
be alive when you finally
achieve this. So
move fast,
please.
>> Thank you Mr Chair.
So we might
have to go back and do any
willing provider
and just put it in the
law. That would
be one thing.
It in the first
meeting I mentioned
or I asked if
the medical records
will follow disabled
persons who are in
Medicaid from one plan to
another. Could you
respond,
>> Mr Chair, Senator?
Yes, they will. We have
been working
on. We have transition
care plan meetings
weekly right now
between
the leaving
plan and the receiving plan to
make sure that that transition happens
smoothly.
>> Ok. And I I know our
vice chair is not here, our chair,
but she
and uh has expressed
this and we had a task
force a few years ago,
many years ago that
really talked about
the
problems when
individuals weren't
continued to be treated
with the same medications,
the same techniques
in the office, etcetera.
And it really inhibited
some of the care.
And the last thing Mr
Chair I'd like to bring
up is based upon something
that Senator Silla
Lopez asked
is I think that
the department needs
to request state
funds if you
don't have enough to separately
deal with pregnant
women and Children of
immigrants. And
we have done this in
the past, we
seem to have quite a bit of
money at the state
if it's the will of the
legislature to
do something like that. They
would, that's all Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator Senator
Gonzalez. Do you have any
questions
Senator Lopez?
>> Um Mr Chair? Just to add
on to that. The
issue of, um,
wondering who's credentialed
also carries over
to the pharmacies
because I've also had,
um, a constituent of
mine who was frustrated
because she needed to go get something
for her grandchild.
And because the pharmacist
in charge
was not credentialed with
Presbyterian,
they had to wait
and the other pharmacist who
was in charge wasn't gonna
be back for three
days.
So she called me and asked, so
what can we do? And that's what I
find out, found out more about
the credentialing issue.
So she had to search and see
if they could transfer
from the
particular pharmacy. She
was out to another pharmacy
where there was a pharmacist who
was credentialed through
Presbyterian
and that was on the far side of
town, which she couldn't get there.
So it's an
issue. So I just wanted to mention
that. >> I, I
thank you for mentioning it,
but I wish you hadn't because I mean,
it just further
illustrates
the frustration that
people experience
and this must make sense to
somebody somewhere. But it certainly
has never made sense to
anybody in
the 20 years. I've in the legislature
to any of the committees I've been on.
We've never understood
why a
licensed
pharmacist doctor,
nurse practitioner
licensed in the State of New
Mexico, approved
by three of the four MC
OS. But this patient
is with the other one and now
we can't pay for it even though it's
state money that's going to be paying
for it.
I mean, I, I guess if the
insurance company
was paying the bill out of their own
pocket, they could make that
choice, but we're
paying for it. Ultimately,
it, it really is, is
not a,
it's not a clear
explanation
to me why we do it this
way. But thank
you for making my
sleep even more tortured
tonight.
Anything else, Senator
Senator Tallman, do you have any
questions?
>> So,
and my assistant's falling down
on the job here.
So thank
you for asking Mr Chair.
So on page 20.
It says,
uh you can,
New Mexican can expect
to improve access
to behavioral health
services.
So two questions. One, are we
going to have enough
providers?
>> Mr Chair Senator,
I think that is what we're trying
to really influence with a, a
varying different
strategies. So rates
is one way to
influence having more
providers
plans that are looking
to bring providers into the
state for providers that haven't
previously existed
here before is another
way I know that
the the meeting
prior to our entry was
talking about workforce
challenges. This behavioral
workforce challenge is not specific
to New Mexico. It is
definitely nationwide.
And so we're looking at the different levers
that we have to
influence an
adequate network for
behavioral health service delivery
rates being one
simplifying the process
for onboarding
providers and what kind of
hoops that they have to go to single
credentialing being one
solution and then
also different recruiting
mechanisms and then expanding the
workforce. So you've
expanded to peer supports. Now,
we're expanding to community health
workers really looking at the different
spectrum of providers
that we can have.
>> Well, thank you for that answer. So
how are you gonna attract and
retain?
You have to attract him from out of
state.
Mr Chair.
You're going to attract more providers
to the state.
Mr >> Chair >> Senator that
by paying more
money
you to
that will be
a
that's gonna work.
>> Mr Chair Senator. There
is a lot more money being
paid here for behavioral health
providers than in com
in other states. So if you do a
compare and contrast and you
do a rate study and you look at other
states
having that enhanced
focus and,
and money put towards
providers so that they can be
reimbursed for the work that they
do is one
strategy. So
again, having a
better, if
I could look at one state and it's
88% of the fee schedule.
And I look at New Mexico and it's 100
and 50% of the fee schedule.
I'm going to be able
to have a
much more solid
financial situation in New
Mexico than I would that per
that state with
88%.
Right. And so really, the
other thing is not only have we
increased the rates, but we have a
floor for managed care
organizations. So they can't
negotiate below that floor
and they have to pay that to
providers. So again,
rates is one
strategy to really
enhance and bring in more workers,
being creative with provider
types such as CCBHC
and having a PPS rate where
they're actually reimbursed for
all the work that they do is
another strategy for that.
We do have a lot of traction
going forward right now
with some of the new health plans that have
come into the space as well as some of
the existing that are currently
having success in attracting
new providers into the state.
And that's currently
underway.
>> So thank you for that answer. And one
last question, Mister
Chair.
So this
program you just explained
to me, is that something you've already put in
place? Is that something you're going
to do?
>> Mr Chair Senator, the CCBH
DS will be effective
1125
the providers entering the state
today, whether through the new plans
or the existing plans
that are coming now are all sorts
of providers. Some are
residential treatment, some
are counseling. So
CCBH DS is a different
provider type that's being
added with
a different rate methodology.
But there's also efforts
underway to bring other providers
of other disciplines for behavioral
health into the state.
>> Ok. Thank you. That's
all I have Mister
>> chair. Thank
you, Senator Tallman Representative
Herndon. Do you have any questions?
I >> do Mr Chair.
And so thank you very >> much.
How many do you have? >> I have
three.
>> Ok. Ok.
>> So my question,
my first question goes with
respect to uh offering
uh behavioral health
assistance to those who
are incarcerated.
So right now,
we don't do it. Is
that a federal law?
Can we get an 1115
waiver for
us?
>> Mr Chair representative,
that's what we're doing, right. So we're
in the 11th hour of our
negotiations of
that 1115 waiver
to secure the approval to use
Medicaid funds to
reimburse the services while
people are still in the cursor
setting as they're transitioning
back to the community.
>> So just for clarification.
Mr Chair and speakers right
now in Ben Leo
County that uh
substance abuse
and addictive
treatment is occurring, it's
not occurring in the state
prison. So does this
1115 waiver
apply only to the state
facility?
>> Mr Chair Representative,
the only limitation right
now as we see it in our
negotiations is tribal
carceral settings. C
MS said that they may need some more
time to get that
approved. However, they're
looking at all type of incarceration.
So jail and
juvenile justice
and as you may have seen, there's a lot
of regulations coming
out around juvenile justice
that are kind of leaning
into the same direction
of really acknowledging the
need for people to have treatment
prior to exiting that
carceral
setting.
>> But we're looking at two years is
that it Mr Chair
>> Mr Chair representative? So
if the negotiations, let's
say I'm gonna be very
optimistic concluded in the month
of July,
right? That would be the approval,
then you do a protocol and an
implementation plan with C
MS. Sometimes it's
90 days, sometimes
it's up to six months, but
you really get that implementation
plan approval and then you can
have those funds
approved for payment
and for those providers,
this could evolve
a little bit differently too. It could be
covering providers that exist
today to do those
services. It could also look at
providers that are already going into
carceral setting being
reimbursed by Medicaid
too. So there's lots of different
ways to effectuate this.
And we are going to have a lot of stakeholder
involvement to make
sure that we are
aligning with what is
going to work best for New Mexico
>> and, and just to
on the same point
because
we just had an exchange
of emails between the,
the secretary
and one of my
constituents who was writing
her, this,
the, the opioid
settlement money
is paying for
or can pay
for
medication assisted treatment
in jail because it's not
Medicaid money. We
don't need a waiver to do that.
What we needed was some
regulations
from the health care authority
that would spell out
how that was gonna be done and
under what circumstances and
who and so the
two things are happening
could happen simultaneously.
The regulation should be coming out
later this year.
So we could start using opioid
settlement money for Matt
specifically in the jails,
not just all the other
behavioral health services
and the Medicaid
expanded
eligibility for people in jail
can be, can kick in at the same
time. >> That
would be good. And when
you say later this year, Mr
Chair and presenters,
exactly when are we going to see those
regulations?
>> The secretary's answer
to my constituent was
by, by December.
>> Ok. So my
question number two, Mr Chair
is with respect to
uh
individuals who are
aging out of
foster care.
Um They seem to be
having problems with
maintaining their
Medicaid, they
should be able to have it without
regard to the money that they're
making. Why is
that a
problem?
>> Mr Chair representative, I
wasn't alerted that that was an
issue. And so I'm not sure if
it's an education piece
or if it's support that we can
give through those kids,
I do look forward to and
again, this kind of goes back
to looking at that
very, very well-trained
care coordination,
care coordinators are not
eligibility workers. But when you
have the focus of a care coordination
team that understands this population,
including the eligibility
that got them too.
Uh being a child in state
custody as well as what to do when
they exit will I
think bring enhanced knowledge
and support to those Children
as they exit the system
and that should be a part of their
transition, right? Is
what is health care gonna look like for
me on the day that I'm
done. How
many providers do I wish to
stay with? Am I going to
be my own guardian? What does that
look like? What is my insurance
coverage? I have choice
of plan. Do I want to stay
where I'm at? Do I want to make
an informed decision? Let
me look at the value-added services
from all these plans and see what
meets my needs as an 18
year old and really look
through all of that. And so I hope that
the enhanced care
coordination and the specialty
and the understanding that they are going to
have as what those Children are go through
will enhance and better that.
But also if you do have any
circumstances or situations
you can share with us, we would really
like to figure that
out. >> Thank you. I I
do have circumstances
and it will last until
they're 26.
So I just wanted to make sure we brought
that up. And then the, the last thing
is with respect to long
term residential,
I mean long term
care for elderly
patients. And
I'm a family member. The
big issue that's coming up
now is how do they
apply for those funds? So we
have aging and long-term
services. Now we have
this Medicaid division
within the health
care authority and
it seems to be a little
bit complicated how
people are getting the funding
if they are taking care of
a, of a family member and
they can be, uh, and
they can be paid. So,
where are those
um, rules
processes laid out
clearly for people to,
to utilize
them?
>> Senator Representative?
Are you asking about
how people would understand
how I could be reimbursed as
a family member as a
legally responsible adult?
>> How do they get the funding?
How do they apply for it and get
it? That has been the big problem.
Now, >> Senator
Representative, so they would be
required to be a provider,
right? So they're providing Medicaid
services, so
they would become a
provider and
so we have resources that we
can get out and we can
definitely do a one pager
document that would help simplify
the understanding of the
process.
>> So Mr Chair
uh madam uh
presenter,
yes, a step
by step process. Uh
If I'm a provider
for my, for my
elderly father,
how do I get the
funding because I'm
taking care of him and that
process is not clearly laid
out. So you're gonna have that one
pager
tomorrow,
>> Senator Representative, can
I have a week?
>> You may have a week? Thank
you. Thank
>> you.
Good. Thank you, Representative,
Senator Pope.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm gonna add a bonus
question. Um Looking
on page
23rd
section of the
bullet um
with the rate increases,
talking about behavioral health
providers
um improved access
to behavioral health
services. Could you
tell us a little bit about right
now, what is that gap for
substance abuse disorders
and mental health treatment right
now? As it
stands,
>> Mr Chair
Senator,
I think there are a lot of different
studies that have been done right now and
I think there's gonna be one published
in the next couple of weeks and looking
at the gaps of care, we
know that the gaps of care are even stronger
in rural and frontier areas.
And then again, I think we're really
looking to the CCBH
CS to close some of
those gaps of care and
really treat across the both the
continuum of dual
diagnoses as well as the
continuum of the
lifespan.
There are significant gaps in
this state in every state in the
country and behavioral health and
substance use. We definitely need
more providers. We
definitely need more attention
to this. There are a lot
of requirements in this upcoming
contract for turquoise care
that really looks at the duality that
people may be experiencing.
And as you noted, there's
a lot of co occurring
mental health and substance use.
There's a lot of great energy around
medication assisted treatment
and providers for that,
as well as the ability for
for waiver to start covering that for
incarcerated settings.
But there are, I'm not
here to tell you there are not gaps
in our care and we are
really trying to enhance that.
Also our network Adequacy
report moving forward with
turquoise care is really going to
drill down to give us
improved information,
not to just know there's a gap,
but what kind of specialties
there are gaps for?
So for an example, just
because you have counselors in
an area, if there's specific
counseling modalities that are needed
in that area and don't exist, we
want to know that and
we want to know what types
of
interventions need more
focus and maybe they
need more rate focus,
maybe they need more
provider recruiting
focus, whatever that may look
like. So I think that will be an iterative
process with these upcoming
MC
Os,
>> uh uh
Senator and
uh senator,
chair and senator. Uh, so
just to add a little bit there,
so there, we do have
a report that was done this
year that I can
share by UN
M that looked at how
many providers
sud providers and behavioral
health providers there were by
county and when I
was talking to them, when they were reviewing
it with me, I said, you know, is this
good or not? And they said,
well, we actually don't really
know what would
be considered an adequate,
just as this is
a evolving
picture, we don't know what
is considered an adequate number.
So, so I can share what we,
where we are.
Um I think
just so I'm a provider, I'm a primary
care provider. And
I think the one
of the best ways to,
to look at adequacy is
how quickly someone can, can get
into an appointment. You know, can
someone get in for an acute visit
within 24 hours a non
acute visit within two weeks,
patient visit within a month? There's
kind of like standardized
answers. That's something we're just
gonna be starting to look at. So
we can also start sharing that
information. We'll have our first
report from turquoise care
starting in October. And
so I can, those are, I think would be the two pieces
of information that would answer
that.
>> Thank you. And thank you Mr Chair and I'm
not, I'm just gonna make this point
on asking another question. I
just think we need to know what that gap
is to understand
is this rate increase
enough? Are we actually
just saying we're
increasing rates and providing more but
isn't enough? So I just
think we need to do more work on
that to make sure we're actually
filling the gap. That's all
I have Mister Chair. >> Thank
you, Senator. And that, that UN M
study that she referred to is the
one we just had the presentation
on actually. So it's
good
Representative Chavez,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. I actually
have three questions, but I'm gonna
whittle it down to one.
And what I'd like to do is meet
with Dana.
Um Just
right after I finish
because there's a couple of other
things that, that I think
maybe can be resolved.
Um
So on
page 13,
um one of the
things that you mentioned
and I took a note about that is
the requirements for
community investment
and that's for the MC
Os, right? Or is that for the
hospitals?
That's for the MC Os? Right?
Ok. So do they do any
community benefits right
now,
>> Senator Representative,
they, they have done
it once we did, we
did one round of that.
So, um,
not this
last calendar
year, but the year before
there were quality
metrics and there were penalties
relating to the quality metrics.
And instead of recouping
it, we said with
this money that we would
penalize, we're going to
direct you to
invest it in the community.
And so what that looked like is that the
MC Os gave us
proposals. We,
they had two measures that
all three of them did not,
did not meet at the time. There were three
MC 0 S3, 2
measures that none of them met. So he
said, well, this seems to be an across
the board state problem more
than a specific MC O
issue. And so
um we, one was a
behavioral health measure and one was a
maternal child health measure. So
we said we need, where would you
like to? We can you give
us proposals on where
you would reinvest funding
for behavioral health and
maternal health to, to
help with these two metrics that we're
not meeting as a state. So
they brought proposals for and then
we selected them and then we asked them
to work together on
those. So those
went into some
training programs. There
was a, some certified nurse midwife
scholarships, doula
scholarships. They
helped keep that Romes
Prog program open, which
was a telehealth
pregnancy
program. Um,
that was really looking like it
was going to lose its funding. So they were
able to keep that program open.
They sent um
point of care hemoglobin
A one C machines, the
behavioral health clinics
because someone's on an
antipsychotic, they need to
check for diabetes. That was a
number that they were low on. So
they, they kind of supported
clinics in doing that
and then they started working together
to try to look at providers
to bring into this for
an RT C. So
there, there was a number of ways
that they, they work together
to use that those money. So that's
probably a little bit of an example
of what we we might do
going forward >> and
then you'll be able to
provide us with the report in terms
of whether or not they're
meeting those
goals. >> Yeah,
Mr Chair representative.
Yeah, we, we we've been receiving
quarterly reports on how much
money was spent and who it went
to. It also went to
after hours slots
at PC P visits,
enhanced rates if they would
stay open later, so
we can share those reports
with you. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
I'm good. >> Thank you.
Thank you representative. I had a couple
of questions. One on
the
on the
supportive housing.
You, you talked
about
the new, the new
turquoise care has
expanded.
I mean, I was just trying to look it
up. Was it in it is
it says expanded access to
supportive housing. That's
current
we already had supportive
housing. What's new, what's
expanded?
>> Yeah,
uh Mr Chair, there's there's
two
services that
are one was approved and
one is coming. So what
was already approved was just
additional slots for the
the current program. So
that is
what might,
why might someone lose
their housing besides just
pure rent? Maybe
they can't do a direct a deposit,
maybe they can't buy a microwave.
Maybe they can't pay for the heat
this month. Maybe they need
some case management services.
And there's a program that does
those kinds of tenancy
and pre pre tenancy and tenancy
services. But it's very, very
small. It was a pilot
and we, we expanded
it. So that was approved
in January, just additional
slots. The
other thing that is starting that we're
in negotiations for,
we're almost there. We're
hoping this month is the
medical respite. So
what that means is if somebody
who is homeless is in
the hospital and
they, they, they're not
really rehab eligible,
they would be literally discharged to the
street or a shelter.
A shelter is not a good place
to rehabilitate. They
have to leave during the day.
They could go to this respite
and it, it's
somewhere between a rehab and a
shelter, they could stay there,
there's food,
there's nursing,
it's a safe place for a physical
therapist. To come and help
them. And so that
that medical respite program
is it will be a pilot
in Albuquerque. And,
and that's the one that's
almost at the end of the
negotiations. That's
>> that additional expansion
items for supportive
housing
provider expansion is
that that one >> Mr
Chair. So as
a lot of the first approval
was on the additional slot, so
we had 180
went to 450.
So that was the >> first a good
expansion. >> Very
exciting and then the additional
expansion items for support
of housing, it
has to do with the local lead
agency providers and the special
needs set aside housing program
that they have. And
it's gonna include community
support workers, case managers,
housing coordinators
able to provide those services. So a
little bit of what I mentioned in
an alignment with what Alana
said, really looking that
pre tenancy and tenancy,
how can I obtain
housing? What does that look like for
me? How do I have the support
to do that or if I am
at at risk for losing my
housing? What does that look
like? A lot of states are using
their demonstrations to not
only do just pure housing like,
ok, I'll put a roof over your
head but how
can I maintain people in the
housing that they already
have or how can I help
them find it when they're in a
predicament where it's very, very
difficult and they need added support
to find it. >> Would it
ever include
actual payment of
rent?
So to keep them from getting
evicted because once they're evicted,
five times harder to get them
back in, >> we
will see what is allowed in the
special terms and conditions as
far as what they allow for
payment of actual room and
board. So they usually treat
it in two different buckets. They treat
that bucket of like the actual
housing money that we're able to
pay for. So those slots
that increase paying for
rent versus
supportive services of
that pre tenancy tenancy
work
>> then the thank you for that. The,
the other question I had has to
do with the
increased responsibility
and accountability that you're
gonna
hold the
MC to.
We've had pretty good
accountability, things on
paper, but
some of us have begun to
doubt if there was ever
much actual
holding them accountable on any
of because a lot of
things never
did seem to get done. Have
you been able to add staff
or are you gonna have more
people checking
up on them? More people doing
the whatever you call it, the,
the secret,
secret shopper
surveys and all of that
stuff or, or are we
still same,
you know,
threadbare core of people trying
to keep now four
big powerful M
CS
accountable
>> Mr chair. I
am very excited to do that
job, right. So we're all
here to play a part and part of the
Medicaid agency. Is to hold the
MC OS accountable for the monies
they receive to render
services to the people in most
need. I think as
far as secret chopper, I look
forward to some of their alignment
and how they do that so
that that can those efforts can go
far. We're also going to do
our own secret chopper
to help balance that and round that
out, we're looking at other
reporting that they're gonna have to do that.
They've never had to do before.
That's going to give us a different line of
sight for different accountability
beyond the P MSs and the T MS
and those lovely disip
DS IP TS
uh that, that exist in the
contract. And so I think there's a
multitude, I
think
going back to that member centric
mindset if the members are not
having an easy time navigating
care because of something that's built
in our structure. That's something
that we're gonna evolve and look
at. And I don't think
that it has to be a
predicated
PM TM in order to
have accountability. And I
believe the MC OS are on that
same page. They are
here to provide
integrated health
services to the members
to the best of their ability
and they are here to continue to
improve the network.
And we have very, very strict
requirements in this contract,
albeit very, very strict
with very tight MLR.
Just to be very
frank,
>> I'm gonna piggyback on that a
little bit. Uh Senator.
So just kind
of speak a little bit
to Dana
and what she is doing
in the state. Dana was brought
in to really work on
our contract and look at our contract
to make it more to
hold MC Os more accountable.
So Dana was with us as a contractor
for the first year. And so
there's been three and so
when she talks about it I've learned
a lot. There's kind of three
stages to
looking at this. One is looking
at the contract, second is
looking at the reporting and
third is having a, a
compliance
department within
Medicaid. And
so honestly,
we might have heard these
things before, but we did not
have a contract
written that supported
us doing that until
yesterday. It's very
different contract than the
centennial care contract.
And then the reportings are very
different.
>> Well, that's very exciting, very
reassuring and thank
you for the, for the
presentation. Uh
exciting
new
um
waiver possibilities.
We're, we're looking forward to those. So keep
us posted on that.
And I want to thank you for the work
you're doing. Thanks so much.
Ok, members will move now
to the next panel,
uh hospital nursing
updates and
we have Nancy
Laster
with the Loveless Westside
Hospital, the administrative
director there,
Holly Muller
from Presbyterian Healthcare
Services. She's the
Chief nursing officer
there and Brittany
Hamilton, the chief nursing
officer at Holy
Cross Medical Center.
So we have three high-powered
nursing executives
here to fill us in on
what's happening
in
and why we have so many traveling
nurses in the
state.
>> All right. Now, can we, can you
hear me?
Um
So
we didn't, well, two of us didn't
do powerpoints or handouts.
We really just going to talk about this
because we talk about it all the
time.
Recruitment is a big issue
for us um
and retention.
And so what we're asked to do is
is bring you some of the
things that we're doing so at
in the loveless market,
we're revamping
our orientation, we're
giving education to our preceptors.
So they understand adult
learning.
We've changed our orientation
and onboarding to tiered
skilled acquisition management
where people get
more feedback on a weekly basis
instead of a laundry
list of skills that they
are trying to do.
Um, we go
talk to schools, we were just talking
about the people that we know in the schools
and you're always out
there trying to recruit,
you, go talk to the colleges, you
talk to high schools if they'll let you
in, I carry my business
card. And if I get good customer service
in a store, I hand in my business
card and say, do you ever want to go into
healthcare? Call me,
right.
Um It's
a never-ending
battle to
get them in.
We've stabilized at Westside,
but I'm a smaller hospital.
So I think there's more of a family feel
there. Um I
currently have one RN traveler
and that's it. But I have a
small facility.
Um Women's is
stabilized in our market. So
as rehab downtown
still has a lot of travelers
because they have a lot of
bigger
population. And I think it's a little
bit harder to stop there.
But what we were talking about back there
while we were waiting for our turn
was the
recruitment and really
trying to
emphasize that New Mexico
is not
a, not thought of place. Right?
I never dreamed I would come to New Mexico.
I was born and raised in Indiana. Worked
in a lot of different places.
I always thought if I came out west I'd
probably go to Arizona and I
had a headhunter called me as a
cult call. You
want to come to New Mexico? I'm like, I'm not
interested really. I'm finishing up a
degree,
just talk to him. I
talked to the CNO and I made a
personal connection with that CNO.
And when I got off the phone, I told my
husband if they offer the
job, I want to come and I want
you to come with me because, or if
they offer to ring me out, I want you to
come with me because if they offer me the job and
you like Albuquerque, I'm coming. I
wanna go. But if you
go Google
Albuquerque, it's
breaking bad in the crime
rate.
We have to do something to get
over that. Right? Because it's not
that bad here. Knock on
wood. I've never been robbed, never had my
car broken into, I've lived
in big cities and you have to have situational
awareness no matter where you
go,
we have to get over that. And I
know there's been a lot of things done in
the legislature to help
schools and funding
and the
$1000 tax credit for
nurses after COVID was
nice. But if you
don't spread that money around, all
you're doing is creating bottlenecks
by putting
money into the schools.
If you don't somehow find
preceptors in the hospitals because
they can't get with the nurse in the
hospital.
So some of the things
I feel like it has to be
more,
he does a great job,
the resources and the focus
has to be more spread out. Or else
you're just gonna fix one problem
and then you're gonna have a bottleneck down
here. If
we don't create new or recruit
new from out of state,
we're not getting anywhere. She's
a pre downtown. I'm loveless.
We steal each other's employees
because if you know anything about
marketing, right, if you don't
increase your market,
you're just stealing from your
competitor and
we're Riley, not competitors because
we're serving the state and the people
in the state. But
it makes it really difficult
because we're just
talking about this. If she
increases her pay rate and
my people hear about it,
they're gonna go there, take the sign on
bonus there, stay for two years and then they're
gonna come back to me if we increase our
rate. Um
So it's just, it's
just a
continued problem that if we
don't get widespread
help in it, we're
not gonna have the
nurses to take care of
patients and
it's, it's really
going to them too and allowing
them to have a voice in the
say, I
think that's very important
but you've got a newer generation that
doesn't want to come in on their day off to
go to a meeting about what you want
to do. So you have to go to them
huddle up.
Hey, we're gonna initiate this.
What are your ideas on it? But
I think those are some of the things that
we've done. We do have a
residency program that supports
new grads. There's
research that says new
graduate nurses
quit.
I think it's the first time about quitting at
nine weeks because they realize they're gonna
be on their own. And the
weight of the job they
took
second time they want to quit is about
nine months because they've made their first
med error.
So we have,
we all have
residency programs that support
those people. Um
But really having these people
supported when they come
out,
it's very important.
Um
And I'll jump in when they say stuff,
but that's kind of my spiel
II. I, we've
started an internal resource
float pool too. So you have
people that are like your own little
internal travelers to
reduce our travelers. But
we're all doing a lot of the same
things.
>> How long have you been in
Albuquerque? >> Um
I was blessed to come, right
six months before the COVID
hit. So I came in the fall of
19. Um
And I say that jokingly, but I really
do appreciate the team I work
with. I'm our medical director for
Loveless was very
much
in tune and wanting to keep
us safe and wanting to try to help
get people in. So
we were part of the hub and I was
like the representative on that. So
there were some tough times like
I don't have a bed, I don't have a nurse,
but I know this patient needs to get
here.
Thank you. You're
welcome,
>> Mr Chair and members of the
committee. Um I'm
gonna start on a personal note
and that's to express appreciation
for our state legislative
body on the
swift action
that was taken in order to
support Lincoln
County and specifically
the village of Riodosa.
Um Many of you may know
that many people's lives
were uprooted between
not just the fire but the
floods that
followed. So
we just really want to express our
heartfelt appreciation
for that responsiveness and the
resources because it really made a
difference. Lincoln County
Medical Center is one of our
hospitals there.
Um I
got a chance to go visit that
hospital last week right after the
emergency order was lifted. I
mean, the devastation was just heart
wrenching. But
I want to talk a little bit about the team as
I rounded through the hospital and just
listening to the staff
hearing their
stories
and thanking them for their
camaraderie, dedication
and courage. You know, a lot of
tears fell that day and
they all found solace
in being together as they just
processed the events and what was
happening. I really
refer to LC MC as our A
team. They're top performing in
every way and they certainly
proved to be the A plus
team during this most
challenging time. So why do
I share this with you?
Yes, I want to express appreciation
because it's
important.
Our most important asset
is our staff, which is what we're
talking about today, our
workforce, but also the
citizens in the state.
And I really believe the theme of
what we're talking about today
is how do we have our shared
purpose
and do our best work
and partner and collaborate? Maybe
there'll be some ideas that all of us
share today that we
could scale fund and
cascade in order to create
even some more statewide
solutions. So that's my hope
for today.
So, in the spirit of healthcare
workforce and being part of this
panel, I'm gonna share
with you some of the ways that Presbyterians
address these workforce
challenges. Once again
to be able to contribute to a larger pool
of ideas for our
entire state
and also share how we
support our nurses
lead evidence-based practice
and ensure adequate nurse
staffing. You've heard a
lot of statistics yesterday and
today, some of
them that define this problem
is that New Mexico
has over 6000
nurse physicians posted today.
You heard Linda Siegel refer to that
earlier and there's
also um 700
fewer primary care physicians
than before the pandemic.
So this talent shortage
affects every New Mexican
who wants and needs
access to health
care. Touches
all of us. The
nursing shortage is both a local
and a national problem and
recruitment and retention remain
highly competitive even
within our surrounding
states. There's
another exceptional data
resource that you may want
to look at. It's from the American
Association of Colleges of
Nursing. We call that the A AC
N. It has a wonderful
fact sheet with the national
projections that were just updated
in May of this year for the
nursing shortage and the state
of our nation's 4.3
million registered nurses.
So addressing this critical
need requires comprehensive
and collaborative short
term and long term
solutions.
Presbyterian focuses on
both in order to build a sustainable
healthcare workforce in New
Mexico. So I'm
gonna share three examples
today of
ideas that we
could consider as we
identify the best solutions
for health care. These are the
some ones that um
I'll be happy to share some of the results
we've gotten so far.
OK. The first and foremost,
one that I'll spend the most time
is partnerships with
academic centers and schools of
nursing, both public and
private, our healthcare
organizations and our schools
coming together along
with your support is really
critical for a sustainable
healthcare workforce.
So the example I'll share
is Presbyterian has a
new program called the Presbyterian
Nursing Career Pathways
Program. This
is an innovative partnership that
we've started with Unitech in our
local Brookline
College.
This enables our
employees to launch their
nursing career. So
people that are in tech
positions or other
positions in our health system
who want to go into nursing
now have the opportunity
to pursue this opportunity
while still holding their job at
Presbyterian, they can get a
Bachelor of Science or a licensed
practical nurse diploma.
So this workforce pipeline
program establishes an annual
pipeline of over
100 nurses a year
for initial placement at
Presbyterian. We do
this by putting cohorts
together each year
of 40 LP N students
and 72 R and BS N
students,
Presbyterians an invested
partner. We are
contributing $10,000
of towards the students
tuition
when they become when they are an
LP N student and
$30,000 for every
RN student.
Unitec. The partner school
also provides
tuition discounts
to their fees. And
we also um can
allow these students to apply for tuition
assistance internally.
We provide scheduling
flexibility to
help as the employees are going
working and going through this
program. And I really
think this kind of idea,
it represents a shared
vision of helping our
employees advance their
careers and their earning
potential while
creating a sustainable
approach for
our hospitals and our ambulatory
centers for many years to
come. It's also a powerful
recruitment benefit
and it is a crucial part
of our long term investment in
workforce pipeline
development. So
before I share some numbers
with you, I want to personalize
this with a story and I
want to introduce you to
Amanda. Amanda
started in March
in our LP N cohort
and she's currently a care
coordination assistant
for the Presbyterian Health
Plan. In
her role, she helps
in her current role. She helps integrate
physical behavioral and long term
care services for
patients and members.
But she said she always
wanted to be a nurse because
it's a rewarding professional
career and she would have
never pursued it if
she didn't have this
opportunity because now she can
keep her job, have flexible
scheduling and pursue this
opportunity. She
said I always wanted to be a nurse when I
was younger. And when I had my
kiddos, all the nurses were
amazing and provided
incredible care. They
made me and my family feel at
ease in a very scary
situation.
So basically, I'm starting late
in life, but it's still possible
and I've always wanted to do this.
I'm blessed Presbyterian and
Unitec have provided this opportunity
to do so. So
here's some numbers to go along
with this because I really think we
identified a need, a
mutual need
in March this year, 24
LP N students enrolled
in May 48 RN
BS N students. Please
note they are 100% of our
employees and
the cohorts that we want to
schedule for later this fall.
We already have a waiting line
of our employees who are
saying I want this
opportunity.
So now that is officially
our inaugural workforce
pipeline here in
2024. In
2025 we'll graduate
that first batch of 40 LP
NS and in 26 we'll graduate
the first batch of 72.
Ours and this
cycle will continue
on an annual basis.
In addition to this arrangement,
we also partner, we've
been partnering for many years with
UN M. We are
jointly involved in a rural
family nurse practitioner
residency program that trains
nurse practitioners and
certified midwives. In
order to serve our rural underserved
populations.
CNM. We have a long
history with CNM.
They're restarting their LP N
program based on our, our
feedback and are also
working with us to ask
us, what kind of education
and training programs
could we create to
align with your most
critical ho hospital job
vacancies? As I
give you these examples, it takes
many different levers and
many different stakeholders to be
involved to solve this
problem. Several
of our nurse leaders serve
as adjunct faculty within
nursing schools throughout the
state and
Presbyterian, as
Nancy had said, we also have
residencies and fellowships as
well. Their best
practice programs to help people
thrive in their work.
Um Last but not least on this,
we have started um
development of what's called
the hall. It's our health care
advanced learning lab. It's
bas basically a simulation
center that will open in
September that provides
experiential learning.
The goal is we
work in teams every day taking care
of patients. So how
the tools and the resources
to train people in teams
so you can validate their
skills but also teach
them how to work in that
complexity with other
disciplines in order to take
the best care of our patients.
So this is going to be a really valuable
tool to support all
the clinical time that I just
explained goes into this
work.
That is one of my most
important examples, workforce
pipeline. If you hear nothing
else, workforce pipeline,
workforce pipeline,
please. All right.
The second example is an
example of innovative partnerships
that can promote nurse
retention and adequate
nurse staffing
Presbyterian partner with
Shift Meed to
employ an on-demand
nurse program in New
Mexico, creating
flexible gig workforce
options. Shift
meed enables New Mexico
nurses throughout the
state not employed
by press to fill
scheduling gaps within
any Presbyterian
Hospital, reducing
our dependence on national
traveler agencies
while still providing quality,
safe and accessible care.
The shift Med app
allows registered nurses
and nurse techs
to fill scheduling gaps
while having flexible
options for scheduling
shifts that align with their
competency, their skill
set, as well as their
lifestyle as
part of the gig economy
model, they're paid
per shift
worked.
These nurses meet all
Presbyterian licensing and
credential requirements and go
through an orientation prior to the
first shift. So
what kind of results are we
seeing these,
these shift med RNS
and nurse techs consistently
fill an average of
150
plus shifts per
week throughout
our delivery system,
ensuring reliable
processes for nurse
staffing by closing
gaps and open shifts.
This testimony highlights
the success of partnering with
existing New Mexico
RNS and our community
and helps keep these nurses
working in our state.
It's also a powerful recruitment
tool. We plan to expand
this model to allied
health positions such as
radiology technicians.
My final example
is elevating the voice
of the nurse and leading safe
quality patient care and the
practice of nursing
professional governance is
historically known as shared
governance and it's been
reignited throughout our hospitals
and clinic settings.
In 2024 our direct
care registered nurses who
serve as the site
specific leads of
professional governance
are now full voting
members of our
Presbyterian Nursing
Leadership Council
and are leading decisions
for nursing, clinical practice and
standards of care for our
patient delivery system.
This was a really critical
structural change that I was
eager to make in
how we engage our professional
registered nurses in
leading nursing practice.
It's transformed nurse
engagement and our
professional
partnership,
a metric that's really important
for you to hear RN our, our
RN
retention is substantially
improved and been
sustained within
eight of nine
hospitals over
the last year and a half
RN turnover is consistently
below 50 fif
15%
with COVID. I know we
all felt like it was 50
it was about 30 on average
as a nation, but we
are consistently under
15% and as low
as 9%.
That's, that's a big
deal, really big
deal. I will share
two reflections from
Heather, the lead
professional governance registered
nurse for Lincoln County Medical
Center. I asked
Heather, how would you describe your
experience at the nursing Leadership
Council? We call it the
NLC. Heather
said, I feel like NLC
has been an overwhelmingly positive
experience. I appreciate
seeing the inner workings of the
organization feeling like I'm
part of that. I just
returned from the American
Organization of Nurse
Leaders Professional
Governance Conference in
Chicago and it was
repeated throughout the conference
that nurses deserve a voice at the
table. NLC
and Professional Governance
councils, give bedside
nurses that voice.
I'm honored to be part of this
and bring this to LC
MC.
I believe she also said, I
believe NLC is true to its
word. It involves
all levels of nursing in the
discussion. It
brings those who have a stake in
the game to the decision making
table and to
reference a onl I
heard Cnes from huge
Magin hospitals echoing the
same ideas in their nursing
strategic plans. We are
definitely on the right
track. Lastly,
I asked Heather, what
else do you want me to hear and
learn? She
said, continue to
listen to those of us on the
frontlines.
I always see complaints on
social media about
how the C Suite is so out of touch
with the realities of everyday health
care. I do not
see that at LC MC
or Presbyterian as
an organization. It's what
sets us apart.
So furthermore, results
that are coming from all of
these efforts of these three
strategies that I shared
with you. I'm gonna mention
retention again because it's
like we live and die by that,
right? It has
substantially improved and we
have sustained our
improvements.
RN recruitment is also
improved because we focused on
retention, those things
go hand in hand and
we've worked really hard to create a
positive healthy work environment
and decrease friction points.
And we also use a rapid hiring
process So we are immediately
responsive to any nurse
that says I'd like to be
considered to work at press.
We do nursing town
halls, but we create
them based on topics
that are of interest to the
staff and we customize
them for each of our
locations.
Workplace violence continues
to be a concern. We put in a
strong line, a silent duress
system so we
anyone can
get an immediate response from
security and get help
if they feel threatened in the
workplace. There's
also the idea
of what's called compassionate
connected care. It's a
framework and model
where you build human
authentic connections, you prevent
suffering for your caregivers
and your patients. At the
end of the day, this approach
of caring creates a healthy
work environment
and be and promotes
behaviors that support a culture
of trust, caring and
excellence.
Presbyterian has numerous
wellness programs and we
continue to add respite and
recovery rooms. So people have
good places to take their
breaks and we have plenty
of scholarship opportunities that
the foundation is very supportive
of. So in
closing
Presbyterian has a proactive
approach to building a sustainable
nursing workforce while
investing in our staff's career
development, well-being
and retention,
collaborative partnerships
and financial investment in
scaling these workforce
interventions could
help us transform these
solutions and
sustainable statewide
programs.
I want to thank you for the opportunity to
share um this
information today and I
welcome any questions or
comments. Thank
you.
>> Good afternoon, Mr chair
members of the committee,
I represent the rural
hospitals. I am the chief nursing
officer here in Taos at Holy
Cross Medical Center and I've been a nurse
for 23 years.
I'm grateful for this honored
opportunity to discuss with you this
key issue that's affecting not
only our state country, but it's
also a world worldwide
issue.
First, I'd hope to briefly
note some issues that are specific
to rural hospitals in New Mexico.
My CEO spoke to this
earlier. Um but it's the
first slide that's in your hand out.
Um Just limited behavioral
health resources and bed availability
in the state. We are
holding on to patients far
longer. Um And
rural hospitals don't have the behavioral
health resources
necessary to get them the treatment. So
these folks are sitting waiting for
necessary treatment often with their
conditions worsening,
increasing er volumes
and a our average daily census
have been up to 44
and um
up from 44 in
2022 to
55 in 2024.
A lot of this is likely
related to the lack of primary
care resources, which is something that
thanks to Senator Gonzalez,
we're hoping to improve
here in this area.
Another issue is limited
ground transportation availability
for patients that need tertiary
care facilities we cannot
provide in rural areas,
the levels of care that they can at
the tertiary facci care
facilities. I wouldn't
want a neurosurgeon that works in a rural
area. They're not gonna have a level of
expertise, they're not gonna get the
practice, they're not gonna have the
people that they need to consult
with. However, to get
these patients to the
practitioners and
providers that they need, most
of them are now transported via
fixed wing and helicopter
ground transport is focused
on 911 and they are increasing
volumes and lack of
staff has made
almost every single one of our patients
going out of our hospital go either
fixed wing or rotor and in
Taos, that's very complex and
difficult because of the weather.
That also means that we're holding people that
are sicker longer.
Um Again, limited bed
availability in the state,
heart attack stroke, multi
trauma patients are also harder
and harder to place. Often, we're having
to send them to Colorado, Arizona,
Texas because there's not enough
beds in our state
and then to go back to address
the nursing shortage.
Um I'm gonna do a little bit
of a history lesson because this has been
going on for a long
time. Um
The nursing shortage was
has been coming since the beginning
of my nursing career.
There's a graph included in the
handout. Um And
the dilemma was predicted.
This is a graph from 2002.
When I was first getting out of nursing
school, the US
was predicting a nursing shortage of
around 800,000
nurses. This is pre
pandemic. This is before
anything really
changed in health care.
Much of this prediction was based upon
the retirement age of the baby
boomers and
that nurses from the baby boomer generation
would be retiring and also
simultaneously their healthcare
needs would be increasing
fast forwarded today.
And the shortage is far worse
than predicted as was
addressed by the statistics
previously stated
the pandemic not only essentially
hit fast forward on the issue, but it
worsened. It exponentially, many
nurses changed careers retired
earlier than expected in the mortality
and morbidity in our country
worsened economically.
The demand for nurses far outpaced
the supply of qualified
nurses with the
decrease of seasoned nurses. There's also
been a subsequent decrease in nurses
to educate newer nurses. This
is compounding the issue
further more
often than not. I'm seeing
nurses who have been graduated from
school a year or two
doing things that I would have never
seen until I had hit a
5 to 10 year mark of
nursing, taking on
larger teams orienting
new nurses and doing things
that they should have never been
expected to do because there's just
not enough of us.
So here in Taos, what we have
done if
you'll go ahead and look at your slides is what
we've initiated is the
team house initiative
and we've
taken it to a community
level perspective and involved
key stakeholders in our community
to help us recruit talented staff
members to help care for the individuals
in our community.
The focus of Team Taos, which was
launched in March of 2023
was to recruit nurses that we lost during
the pandemic. A lot of nurses
chased the traveler rates
and we wanted to get them back to our
facility.
We've also focused on recruiting the
existing travelers who are already
working alongside our permanent
staff retention
is another key focus of Team
Taos with monetary incentive through
increased sign on bonuses. A
complete readjustment of our
nursing wages above market
rates, recruiting
incentives to our existing
staff to help bring back staff that have
left. And lastly
a key focus on education for
staff within the hospital.
Our initial goal was to recruit
25 nurses and we have successfully
recruited 31 and this was as
of last week for a small
hospital. That's a big deal.
We've partnered with UN M TAOS to
help ensure their programs are successful
and to help get their students clinical
experience along with placement of
residents towards
residency towards the end of their
program at the hospital.
Our Ceo James Kaiser who
spoke earlier, our
chief Human resources
Officer, um Vivian
Santa seven on myself and myself
have gone out to the community and the
colleges and secondary schools to
garner interest from the students in health
care to help answer
profe profession, specific
questions to teens and young adults
that may need help deciding
what profession they'd like to go
to. We've
begun to take interns from the high school
and a work study program with the hopes that
they'll continue their interest in health care
professions. In
closing, my biggest ask from
you, the honorable committee is to take
into consideration the words from an
article published in the
American Journal of Nursing in January
of 2001.
The shortage is not solely
nursing's issue and requires a
collaborative effort among nursing
leaders practice and
education, health care
executives, government and the
media, we must recruit
our youth into health care and find a way
to provide resources to those ailing
in our community, both rural and
metropolitan. This issue
does not just affect
nursing, it affects
radiology, lab,
our physicians, our midle
level providers and each
one of us is patients and family
members of patients.
I thank all of you for your
time and I would like to answer any
questions that you may have.
>> Well, thank you all very,
very interesting and some great
ideas that you all are putting into
practice and hopefully
you're spreading around.
We'll start with the Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
and thank you to all three of
you.
Very valuable
information and
also applaud you for the
work that you do. Uh
The first question that
I have is so
is there a limit to the
number of hours
that a
licensed nurse can work
per week?
>> So there's
recommendations
from, you know, national
organizations. I don't think anybody
ever writes their policies
to, to tie themselves in,
in an emergency. You can go
over ideally,
you know, if you've ever worked 3, 12
hour shifts at the end of the third one,
you're kind of a little bit,
maybe a little bit slower on the
response. Um,
so you like to look at that
and not let people
work that many shifts in a row
or that much overtime because you
worry about patient safety.
>> Yes, exactly.
And, uh, that's where I was
going, you know, at what
point does it, does
it turn into liability?
You know, when you have
someone that's tired and
just, uh,
uh, because of
the number of hours, you know, just
very simple.
Uh, one of the
parts that I just want to
mention is so I
have worked for many
years
in the transportation
part and
with the
transportation,
you know, truck drivers
are not allowed more than 11
hours and they have to be the
11 hour break
and, and here it
was because of the same thing,
safety
and the safety to themselves,
safety to the public and
everyone and,
you know, I always,
you know, think of that,
but what I was
gonna ask you next, so Mr
Chairman is,
uh, you mentioned
Nancy about going into
schools
and what grade do you
target?
So, >> tass
is going into really
high schools is where you want to get
in before they decide what they're
doing. Um, it's
harder to get in there. But the more
you can get into the, the high
schools and even junior highs
if you reading to, to elementary
school kids about being a nurse,
right? Like you're show and tell, I'm gonna
bring my nurse to, to
show and tell.
But where we really target is
going into the colleges too
and you're talking to those people and
we were talking earlier because we all go
to the same colleges
and they just put you on a round
robin. But,
um, Holly
and I were talking about how you, I
go and recruit them to the nursing
profession because I've been a nurse
for almost 40 years now
and I could not have asked
for a better career.
So you're really wanting to
get people to come into that
profession, whether they're already
in nursing school or they're not
showing in the options
of it.
Um,
and what
really
internal,
I call it, filling my cup back
up when I go to the schools because,
you know, the stuff you do drain a
lot of times. But if you go to the schools
and you can get people engaged and they're
excited about where they're going.
Um, that's
where you get them help, >> Mr
Chairman. I'll try not to
take too much time, just a little bit
more. Um,
one of the parts though, in
my part, you know, I've
done many years in
education
and I'm a firm
believer
that if you want change. It
has to be through education.
And if you have that change,
it has to start on a
scope and sequence
from kindergarten
all the way or even take it
to the college level,
which every year the
increment is level
of what is being
proposed and being
taught.
And I'll never forget.
And this is the late
representative Janette
Wallace
and she's from Los Alamos
and we would have
discussions
and she told me that
every program that they
started, they start
in third grade,
you know, and at
first, I just, you know, I
thought, well, why? And she says, no,
it's, you know,
just the introduction
and keep developing it with
that scope and
sequence and
it makes a lot of sense, you
know, if, if you really want to
bring into
that, you know,
so I would
encourage and
then I would say that
the culture and the
environment
is going to have to change
based on the
numbers and presentations that
have been given to us about
the need for health
care, the demand
is really
high
and the more that we can
have that awareness
into someone
with that paradigm shift of
thinking of a
career in
that part. And then seeing
uh you know,
at the end, you know, the benefits,
you know, what it could be,
you know, uh
New Mexico
really could go into
that very, very
strong and
work with that. And we have
done a lot, but you
know, that's
one of the things that I saw
and I had a
probably a good two hour
conversation with the governor
on this and
just seeing, I mean, with,
with everything that we have,
but this is one thing
that we really
need to because
everyone is
affected by,
you know, good health protection,
good health services
and, you know, uh
going with that. So,
um, the last
part of Mr chairman
is
with a
New Mexico Trian
Association.
And just to give you an example,
one company by themselves
in Masia Valley, in Las
Cruces, they own
like 11,000
trucks. So
it's a large number. That's
just one.
And
they have made a big
difference in their
recruitment,
you know, by having
simulators
where they take them to
the schools on these
traveling. And
the actual students can
put on the
information that
had said that
visual
and see different
experiences
and be surprised
because how effective it has
been on the recruitment,
you know, and maybe that's a
suggestion that I'm saying something
like more into
understanding what it does
and, and not
everyone is cut for the same
kind of work, you know, but maybe
there's something that fits
their part of
what they would want to do.
But again, just thank you
Mr Chairman and thank you
for your presentation
and
>> thank you, Senator
Senator Lopez. Do you have any
questions
Senator Tollman? Do you have any
questions?
Uh Representative Herndon,
>> I have just one Mr
chair. Uh and
my, my questions regarding
the students that have been trying
to get into the nursing program
at UN M sometimes
they've met some barriers
and I've been able to get in so they
reverted rather
they have chosen to
go to CNM
and get through their program.
How many of them then actually
do get admitted to the
nursing program if they come
back to be
RNS? >> So
you're talking about CNM RN
program
>> when you speak, can you move
the mic right in front of you?
>> You're talking about the CNMRN
program, right? >> So,
I, I thought CNN, if
you win for two years, you don't
get an RN, right? >> No, you
do. There's a two year RN
and CNM has an RN to
BS N program that
works in with UN M
and I know this because my husband
who's my age, I didn't marry a younger
man. Retired when
we moved here. He
had been in education, elementary
education for years and decided
that he was bored. So he went
to nursing school and actually he's
starting in one of Holly's
hospitals. Uh, he's
on his second week.
So he just completed with
CNN CNM. But
they do have part of their nursing students
that go from CNM to
UN M to finish up their, their
BS N, but they're working. It's
kind of the same thing that Holly's
doing with Brookline
where you have your RN already. So
you're working as an RN and you get the
Bachelor's degree. Actually.
Loveless is working on that with Grand
Canyon as well.
But there are seats
at CNM. Now, I'll tell you what happened
last year in the spring
at CNM
when my husband was trying to get into
the, the last, the Capstone,
they're like, we don't have, we don't have
preceptors, like
they're scrambling a week
before it starts looking for preceptors
because there's not enough nurses to
precept the students.
Um, they ended up
getting them all, but
that's part of the issue. There
are spots at CNM and I think
they do feed into UN M, I don't know
that for sure, but there's,
there's places for them to go, but they do
come up with an RN if
they go to C and M's associate
degree program.
>> So just for clarification,
they go to CNN, they
can get an RN
on a two year program.
But if they go to UN
M and they start out there,
they have to go four years
for an RN. So what's the
difference?
>> Well, you're talking to an old
associate degree nurse that didn't get
any of her other degrees
until my kids are almost done.
You're a diploma nurse back in
the day. They used to have us just
go into the hospital and work as a
diploma program.
I'll let you
>> at this time, there's
two ways to become a registered nurse,
either an associate degree
program or a
Bachelor of Science. They both
can take the NCLEX
exam and become a registered
nurse. So at this
moment in time, there's still two
options that way. I
think as I was listening to
this conversation,
I was thinking about
um,
the efforts that we're all making
to make sure that
all of us and our leaders
are serving as adjunct
faculty
and at the very least
helping to support each other
in these, in these schools and with their
organizations on percepting
students and making space for
them. So
when I'm thinking about solutions,
like how do we keep this pipeline
going,
helping to be adjunct faculty
and fill that gap, helping
to make sure we have student
slots at all of our
hospitals and that we're
partnering with the colleges is really
critically important. And
when I mentioned the simulation,
the thing I called the hall,
the whole goal there too is
to also make this
process efficient.
So that either
the third grader that wants
to, you know, help
observe something that might
be interesting in health care and get
into student experience
or trying to move these
new nurses along.
We're trying to take all of these
tools and all these approaches
to solve for exactly what you're
asking for so
that we don't have to
turn away people that want to
become nurses.
Do we answer your
question?
>> I'm not sure. But
I'll talk to you
offline.
>> Do preceptors get
paid extra,
they >> have a, they have a differential
that they get, they >> get.
But when you're talking about funding
from the state to
get somebody who's precept
and do something for them,
whether it's maybe
their differential
is not taxed
or maybe their salary is not taxed
when they're precept. And I know that's a big
ask, but that's a
huge responsibility
to take on a brand new
student and
take care of your patients and
teach,
they're taking on a lot of responsibility.
The other thing, the nurse practice act
says if I am a
bachelor's student,
I have to have a bachelor's prepared
nurse precept toy.
So we've kind of
limited some of our
pairings.
Um
That's something else we might wanna look
at.
>> Thank you. >> Thank
you, Representative Representative
Chavez. Any questions?
Thank >> you, Mr Chair. So
I kind of wanted to follow up on the
precept.
I'm sorry, I was out of the room
for a bit.
So I know Holy Cross is
here. Loveless West
side.
And who else
Presbyterian. Ok.
So do all of the hospitals
pay a preceptor
differential?
All of you do,
>> we do Holy Cross as well?
>> Ok. All right. Thanks. And
how many
new
nurses to the preceptor
take
right now? 1 to 1.
So the question that I have
for
Holy Cross
is there's
a UN M campus. We're obviously
in the nursing
building. I just
renamed it.
So how many students
are actually
from Taos? And how many
stay and work at
Holy Cross?
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
Representative Chavez
last year Daw
may have to correct me. She's from the
UN M they
had around 12 and we got around
75 to 80% of
them. A
couple of them were for
Espanola driving up to
the Taos campus to get their
education, but we were
able to retain a large percentage
of those staff members and a
large percent of them also did
their residency here all
across. >> And what's
your overall turnover at
each of the hospitals?
And for our ends,
>> currently, we're
less than 10%
Holy
>> Grass.
And I think for West Side, we're sitting
about 17 or
18 for our ends.
Um
which is, I'd like to have it
lower and it was lower last year, but
we've just had some growth
opportunities for people.
So, >> and in
Presbyterian, eight of our nine
hospitals are all below
15% and have really been
tracking more between
12 and
9%.
Ok. Thank you, Mr
Chair,
Senator Cia's
office. No
questions just >> thank >> you for
everything. >> You thank you for having us.
Thank you, Senator
>> Stennis. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair and thank you for your
presentation. I'm going to hold.
Thank >> you. Thank you.
>> I had a couple of quick questions.
This shift
med fascinating
concept. Is it a private
company that does
this
the mic? >> We
didn't turn the button back on my
apologies.
Um Yes, it's, it's a
private company
that this is one of the
workforce solutions that they provide.
It's all done. You know how
everybody walks around with the phone
nowadays, everything
is on the phone on their app.
So then we can post
shifts that then
go to this website. For the
nurses that are
enrolled in shift meed.
And then they can see
exactly where the shifts
are opened. They can select
those and they
can do that one at a time. they can
sign up ahead of time.
There's flexible shifts.
It doesn't always have to be a 12
hour >> like
an Uber for nurses.
>> Well, it's really funny that you mentioned
that because we don't
have a lot of reliable Uber
services in New Mexico.
But in other markets, they're
in another feature
they add and this is very
common with nurse
assistants, technicians
where they might not have as many
resources, they actually
package a free Uber
ride back and forth to work.
So we haven't turned that on in New
Mexico ago. But
you're right, the Uber
term fits it and this is
something especially younger
nurses. They want
that flexibility.
They want that as
either an adjunct to
their primary job or
for their, or as their
primary job. So it's a
creative, innovative approach.
And we started
this in September,
you know, it took a few months to kind of,
you know, get acclimated to it.
But as I shared in my
report,
consistently,
100 and 50
plus
shifts a week
are being filled
and this keeps nurses
in New Mexico versus
they go to a travel agency and leave
the state >> and,
and are these nurse,
uh, first other hospitals
besides the Presbyterian system
use that >> we're the first
ones right now to use it.
So that does not
mean it could not spread
in New Mexico. We're
sharing that idea today,
but >> you have some
retired nurses that come
back and do a shift every now
and then just to keep their hands in.
>> Absolutely. And I'm
really glad you asked about that
because having
solutions and
we're working a lot now
on what would a hybrid
job look like, so that
our more seasoned nurses that
don't want to do three twelves
a week anymore,
that they have some
flexible shift
options and maybe even
different areas to work.
So that is work that we're
doing right now to try to
design hybrid
options for our retired nurses
that might not want to work full time
anymore. >> I think it's
brilliant and, and
all the ideas that you all brought
up were really helpful and
while you were out of the room, Representative
Chavis that she brought
up the
nursing Leadership
Council. And so
you might ask her about that because
that's, she's
all crediting that with
greatly reducing their,
their turnover. And,
and it's something where the
nurses take a role
in the management of
the, of >> the leading,
they're actively involved
directly in leading clinical practice
and standards of care.
>> Well, thank you all for your
presentations. I'm sorry,
you had to stay here so much longer than
we had planned. But committee
has a lot of questions and
we, our curiosity
needs to be
fulfilled.
Thanks so much.
So, the final panel of the
day is the
nursing school
update.
And now we'll hear the other side of
the, of the
coin
and we have Shana
Kemper, the Director
of Nursing at San Juan
College,
Don Kittner, the Director
of Nursing at UN M
Taos, and
Terry Tart, the Dean
of the School of Sciences at
Santa Fe Community
College.
And by the way, while they're coming up,
I just mentioned, don't forget
the reception a
after we
finished today. And
then tomorrow morning,
I, I would
say,
you know, we're gonna finish
before lunch
because we've had that cancellation
of the, of the second
panel. Uh She wasn't
able to come because of a death in the
family. So we only have
two panels tomorrow morning,
but then we would like to spend a little bit
of time, kind of getting
your ideas about what,
what you've heard that you'd like to
convert into
legislation.
OK.
So I'll turn it over to
you,
>> Mr, chair members of the committee.
My name is Shanna Kempfer. I'm
the director of the nursing program
at Someone College in
Farmington and
I'm here today just to talk to you
guys about um
some of the great things we've done in our
program, but also to address
some of the challenges that we are
faced with in nursing
education.
So, Salmon College Nursing
Program is a member of the New
Mexico Nursing Education
Consortium. We
provide students with two
tracks for obtaining
a nursing degree. Students can
obtain their associate's degree in
nursing um from
Salmon College or they can
obtain a dual degree, their
associates and Baccalaureate
degree with our partnership
with the University of New
Mexico Salmon
College Nursing. We admit
64 students
annually 32 in
the fall and 32
in the spring semester. And
of those 16 are AD
N associate degree
students. And the other
16 are the dual degree
that we will receive their AD
N and BS in when they
>> graduate. They'll all
be our when they
will >> be RN when
they graduate and take
their INCL RN
exam.
So on the second slide there,
I wanted to talk a little bit
about um some of
the funds we've received and
some of the good things we've done for
our students
um
with the nursing
expansion funds, we really
wanted to focus
on retention
of our students. That has been a big
issue for us at someone college
um of being able to retain our
students. And there's multiple
variables um
of why we've had issues
with retention and a lot
of those can be financial
concerns, child
and elder care um for
students,
transportation,
access to functioning,
computer, internet
resources, food
insecurities and
just family obligations in
general. Obviously,
these increase
substantially uh during
the COVID. And we are still seeing
these being of a major
concern for our students in
our program.
So one of the primary reasons
we see students withdraw
or fell from our nursing
program as due to
financial needs,
many of them are having to work
full time many times
over full time while
they're trying to go through a very
rigorous program to become a
registered nurse.
So they don't have the time or
energy that's really required to
be successful in this
program. So we
use these expansion funds to
really focus on student
retention, which
ultimately, if we can retain
more students, then we are
adding more students into the
workforce. Some
of the items that I've included there
for you, of what we've done for our
students, we've
created a faculty student
mentoring project. A
lot of the research does state that
when students have an
additional support
of a mentor throughout that
entire program, that they have a
connection with a one on
one. So this goes
outside of the normal
teaching responsibilities
where we meet one on one with that
student. We're kind of, I like to
call it the cheerleader. We're
there to support them,
meet with them individually, one on
one and really follow
them through the entire program and
get to really know your student.
Um Obviously, that takes a lot
of additional time and effort
from faculty. So we were able to
provide faculties with a stipend
to do that for our
students. Again, financial
concerns have been the biggest
one of the biggest barriers.
And so with the expansion
funds, we were able
to and have continued
to purchase all the textbooks for
students, we purchase them
two sets of uniforms and
a stethoscope when they enter our
program. And we
also provide them a monthly
stipend of
$400
right, if they can
focus on
school and not worried
about, am I going to get my lights turned
off? If I'm not gonna have gas to
get to the college today,
then we're hopeful that they can
stay and be focused
on the responsibilities
to get through nursing
school.
Along with that. We
also wanted to create
um like
a tutoring position, but we
wanted it to be an RN
that knows the content that's
helping students, another
resource for that. So
we created two positions called
nursing content
specialist,
um which are fancy
term for a tutor, but there
aren't, we
have had difficulty filling
those positions just like we
have with faculty at being
able to get people into that
position. We're looking
at turning one of the positions
into two part-time. So maybe
we might be able to
recruit people
into that position to help our
students. We
also use the funds
to um hire a
full time simulation
technician to help with our
simulation um where
we spend a lot of times with the students
in the simulation and lab
environments. And we have filled that
position. It has been a
huge help um
to keep our simulations
running for our
students.
Also, we found that
technology is a big concern
for our students.
Approximately 10%
we were noticing were having issues
either with computers or internet
access. So we were able
to purchase um 12
computer loner computers
that are housed in the nursing department
that students can come check out
if they don't have a computer
or if their computer
breaks during nursing school,
even a day without a computer and
nursing school can be very
detrimental. We've
also purchased hotspots
for students that uh don't
have access to internet
um to help them as
well.
We're also looking
at um
resources to help students
when they enter the program. I'm
gonna talk here in a few minutes
about uh
one of our biggest challenges
is lack of student
preparedness not coming
into our programs prepared.
And so we have purchased some
resources to help them with their
entrance exam to
hopefully help students
um improve in their basic
math science English
skills so that they
can meet the requirements
to enter into the nursing
program.
Also, we know that if we
can assist our faculty
and all our staff
in maintaining current
evidence-based practice
um professional development
that also helps create
a more
dynamic workforce within
our department and keeps
our faculty um involved
and up to speed in what's happening
in nursing. So we've provided a
lot of professional development
for all our nursing faculty
and also the staff within
the nursing
department.
Some of the good things um
to report to you on
our nursing program. Um
that slide on SJC
nursing graduates again,
I've breaking, broken it down by
the years and by
those that are only getting their associate
degree, those that are
dually enrolled.
And then those, and then our
total numbers. And
again, I would just like to point
out um this last
year, we did see some growth.
We, I think ended up
with 49
overall graduates and our
BS and numbers actually have
increased quite a bit
as well. So
modest growth. But we're
working on that and I do
attribute a lot of that
to the resources we've
been able to give students.
>> You did you say before
there were 32 in the, in
the
AA A and 32 in the no,
>> 32 overall,
1680 16
BS and that we admit every
fall and spring.
>> Ok. So when you say the
graduates here that's over for both
semesters, >> those are
the graduates for the whole year that
graduate. We also have a summer
graduation. So we
graduate three times a
year,
our inlex first time pass rates
because it's the one hurdle to get
through the program but then you also
have to go and sit for your licenser
exam. Um So
looking at those numbers of the very
first time that they pass, we
maintained um above
95% for the
last several years overall
pass rates. So we've had a couple of students
who struggled on their first attempt,
they've gone back and our overalls
are at 100%. So everyone
that has graduated has
passed their
inlex
Now just to talk to you about
some of the struggles and some of these
you probably have already heard of
um in the last day or two, but
I do believe they really do
impact nursing
education. And so
when we look at the current pulse on the
nursing profession, uh we
see and we're gonna see this
kind of same theme when we
talk about faculty, a
significant segment of the
nursing workforce is nearing
retirement age.
So we're already in a nursing
shortage and now we have a lot
that are getting up into that
retirement age.
Obviously, we've known from the
pandemic that a lot of items
have intensified. Um
raising the stress levels of
nurses impacting their
job satisfaction
and driving many nurses to
leave the profession. And this
does impact students because they
see this in the clinical setting.
They see what's happening, the stress
levels and wondering why, why
am I entering into
this,
the nursing shortage, however,
has placed nurses at a career
advantage which we've heard about
um again, nurses going
ok, here, I'm
working here, but now they're gonna offer
me this 15,000 sign-on
bonus at this next facility.
And so, while it's provided
a career advantage, it's
really um
not allowed for
um continuation of
staff working in that unit for
consistency. Um Also
for students, when we see a lot of
turnover in the hospital
settings,
this statistic and I've seen
different numbers um all
the way up to about 30%.
Um but the A N A
American Nursing Association
states that nearly 18%
of newly licensed registered
nurses quit their first
job or leave the profession
within a year.
And that's really hard as well
as we're trying to build up our
workforce,
bullying, incivility and
workplace violence are on the
rise. We see
that in the United States
at least two, sometimes
more nurses are assaulted at
work every
hour. And
so that's a huge
concern for the nursing profession,
but also students that are entering into
programs um of
looking at those
things
in terms of actual challenges
in nursing education.
And again, these impact my
program. But I do believe we see
these across the state. We see
these across the nation
student
preparedness.
First year nursing studentss are
struggling with basic concepts
of reading, math, science and
English. I know
when I spoke to the
committee last year, I talked about
the average AC T score for
high school, the high school
class of 2022 declined
to its lowest in 30
years. I just
saw some uh research
article come out last week to
say that it dropped again
for
2023
pros prospective nursing
students say they lack
um academic preparedness. And
sometimes that is the driving
force of why they're not applying
to nursing programs.
They don't feel ready,
they're not able to meet a required
score for, for entering
the program. And
so
really what we need to do is
earlier and more sustained
support for students before they even
get into the nursing program,
we need to be able to give them that
support in their prereqs
so that they are very
strong when they come into
our program. And then once they're in our
program, we need to continue
along with that in terms of
those types of positions, nursing
content, specialist,
things that can help students
along the way. But that has
been one of my biggest challenges
that I've seen over the last couple of
years is just
student preparedness. They're
struggling once they
get into our
programs.
And then I would say my biggest
challenge. Um
and again, this, I think we can see
across the state and the nation
is fac a faculty shortage,
right? Um While
we see it for nursing, we're also
seeing it with faculty,
faculty age
con continues to climb
narrowing the number of years
that we have them in the teaching
profession. And a wave
of faculty retirements. Is
expected across the US over
the next decade. I'll
tell you that out of my 10 faculty,
I have four so
40% that
will be retiring within the next
five years.
So that is, is a concern
too. Probably
the biggest um is
again back to that um
career advantage,
higher compensation in
clinical and private sector
settings, especially right now
is luring current and
potential faculty
back to the bedside.
They're seeing these sign on
bonuses, they're seeing they're
going to get paid a lot more
and they're going back to the
bedside. So it's very
hard to retain
but also to recruit new
faculty coming to our
facilities to our
education
and master's and doctoral
programs. So to
teach full time in
nursing education in an RM
program, you need a master's degree
in nursing. And
so we're seeing
less and less people wanting to
go in for those degrees
to be able to get that
master's degree to come
teach in
education.
So that is my
presentation and I will turn
it over to Miss
Gitner.
>> Mhm.
Good afternoon, Mr Chair
and esteemed members of the
committee. My name is
Don Kittner and I
am the director of the U and M
Tafts Nursing Program.
And uh I I
apologize if you put me in
front of a bunch of nursing
students in a classroom.
No problem.
If you stick a microphone in front
of me, I start wavering.
And so
um but
I am honored
um to be speaking here with
before you today regarding
our critical issue of
nursing and specifically
nursing education.
Um First, I would like to
thank you for the support that
has been generously given to you in
house. Um
for our nursing program.
This consistent support
has provided stability which
allows us to maintain our
program and provide
state of the art equipment,
integrate technology into
the curriculum and prepare
students for the complexities
of rural um
rural health care.
Because um
some of these things that
you heard um from
director Kemper, you'll
be hearing from me as well.
Um Our
U and M Ta Nursing
program is
part of the New Mexico
Nurse Educators Consortium.
So we offer an
associate degree in
nursing um
or the option of having
a dual degree where students
are awarded an associate
degree in nursing and a
Baccalaureate of
Science and Nursing. At
the same time, the
the difference being is
one semester for
our students. So
normal associate degree
programs are four
semesters and
the Baccalaureate program that we
offer here is a five semester
program
and I'll be speaking about
that in a little, in a
little bit.
Um I would also like to
thank our support
that we received from Holy Cross
Medical Center.
Um Our program would
not survive without
the support that we've always
received from Holy Cross.
And um
when Mr Kaiser
came into the position of
CEO at the hospital,
one of the first things he did
was to reach out to our
program to seek
ways of how
do we get more um
people interested in nursing.
How do we get more like,
how can I do this, you
know, through Holy Cross and through
the community?
So,
um now I'd
like to kind of speak to some of
the ways we've used the funding
to support um
nursing.
And so first,
um on slide two
or page two,
we used a lot of
the funding for advertising
and outreach. So
Un M Tao has historically
relied on word of mouth to
promote it. Nursing program
resulting in limited
awareness within the community
pe like there's still today,
probably people are like what there's
a nursing program at UN
M Tufts. Um
So with this increased funding,
we've been able to implement
targeted marketing strategies
to enhance the visibility of our
program in our
region. Um This
has increased enrollment
in our current cohorts and
has brought more
awareness to future nursing
students.
Um Evidence notes that students
who enter into programs within
their community tend to
graduate and be employed in their
community. And this is
really what we do see here
at, at U and M House.
Our program um
is, is a small
program. When we first
started in 2009,
we accepted 16
students into the program
would graduate them
except another 16
studentss. Currently,
we admit 16
students every annually
in the fall
and most of those
students are now
from our community,
graduate and stay
in our community.
Um We are using the
funding to bring exposure
and awareness to Children in our
community by going into
the schools or having students
come to the nursing program
and tour um
to learn about nursing
and other health career
programs that are offered in Rio
Grande Hall. This
early exposure expands
the realm of what is possible for
them in the future.
>> MS Kitner, could you explain
the the 16,
the enrollment? What
that chart means? 16
slash 16, 516.
Is that? >> Oh, that
is so
the 516,
that is how many students
that were prepared and
admitted into that
cohort. So
at the time that that's
a post pandemic
cohort and only
five students were
able to meet the requirements
to be enrolled in
that group.
They're actually graduating
in six
weeks. They are
>> super excited. So
in, in 2021 it
says you had
room for 16 but only
12 qualified. >> Is
that, that is >> correct? And then
1115.
But this year,
this >> our
last cohort for
that we admitted in the fall of
2023 was 16
students. And
for this fall,
I'm expecting to have a full
cohort again of 16
students. Thank you. It's,
it's actually this fall
is the first time
that I have more
students that
um have
applied and
have met or
in the process of meeting
um the requirements of the
program
which thank you.
It's
amazing.
Mm Let's
see.
Uh So building
pathways into our program.
So creating clear educational
pathways from high school to
nursing programs is essential.
This includes dual enrollment
options and streamline transfer
processes to ensure smooth
progression at U
and M TAOS.
One of our main focus is
is building and maintaining
pathways into nursing.
We actively participate
in the New Mexico Educators
Consortium which I spoke
about partnering
with the UN M College
of Nursing. This
partnership has allowed our students
to achieve an associate and
a bachelor's degree in nursing while
staying in our community,
it makes achieving A BS N
affordable costing
about the third
um as much as a direct
entry into another
other BS M program
and helps to maintain the family
and social support that most of our
student students need
to be
successful.
Previous to our nem nec
partnership, only a few
students continued their education
for a BS N or a graduate
degree. Given
the choice, about
99% of our students
choose the dual degree A
SN BS M
program and
about probably
about 85 to
95% of those
graduates stay in our community.
This is a great boon for
tafs,
other ways of that we've used
the funding. Um
We have hired an allied health
program specialist that's
responsible for outreach
recruitment and student support
for our health care programs
like emergency medical
services, certified
nursing assistants, and community
health workers. These
programs are excellent entry
points into health careers
and lead to nursing.
Many of my
students
have um completed
the EMT basic
course and
you know, are well
prepared, you know, to
become a nursing student in the
program.
We've provided support
workshops, um student
support workshops to help increase
the applicant pool for admissions
and help retain students. Once they
are admitted, we have
an entrance exam workshop
which provides a review of the
content that is covered on the
nursing entrance exam
so that they can be successful
and meet the um
that exam kind of
cut-off
score.
Um We have an application
workshop that is provided
to answer any questions and support
the students in applying
to our program.
Um You uh
many of our students need
these type of
um kind of face to face
workshops in order
to help navigate through some
of the complexities of the
um application
process. We
offer um a bridge
to success in nursing workshop
which offers newly admitted
nursing students, mentorship,
peer to peer support and
an overview of the nursing
program. Students
who have participated in the bridge
workshop. Enter the program
with less anxiety and
greater resilience
and significantly increase
their chances of successful
completion. You know, similar
to director
Kemper. I'm also
focusing on retaining
our students. It's
it's one place
where I think we can make
a powerful impact.
Um on
slide three,
we have um
retention for the future
of nursing, helping the students
through financial support by
providing cost of living
stipends and offsetting
nursing program costs.
We're aiming to help the student
fully participate and graduate
from our program.
Currently, the cost of
living in Taos is about
2.1% higher than the
national average.
We recognize that many of our
nursing students faced financial
challenges before attending
school, let alone choosing
to enter into a higher cost
health care program such as
nursing providing
stipends allows the students
to focus on their education
instead of employment,
which detracts from their time
to study many
of our students
similar
and two other programs
work full time
jobs, part time jobs. They
stay up till 234
in the morning, come to school
by nine, you know,
um getting a little sleep
um in order
to provide
the care for their families
and um
and meet their educational
requirements.
Nursing programs are inherently
more expensive related to
program requirements to
help offset the high cost
of the nursing program we have covered
or provide reimbursements for
requirements such as
background checks, drug screens,
uniforms, textbooks,
other educational
requirements.
Both of these tactics help
the student focus on their nursing
education and relieve some
of the stress of having to support a
household.
We've also been
able to provide
um a nursing content
tutor and a pre health science
tutor. These tutors
provide needed support
ensuring that the student has the
understanding and the confidence
in their growing knowledge.
The nurse content tutor is a
recent graduate from our program
and works at Holy Cross Medical
Center, providing valuable
insight from their experience
as a student and
how their education relates to
employment.
The pre health science,
nursing, the pre health
science tutor
is a student that's
in our nursing program.
And so again, they're
being able to provide
education support
in their next the
that students next step in
achievement
for nursing faculty
on page on slide
four, you know, we
are fortunate to use the funding for
nursing education professional
development. We've used
funds to support our adjunct
faculty as they work to complete
a master's in nursing
education while they
continue to educate our students
as an in that adjunct
role. We've
used funds for nurse educator,
professional development, which helps
to us to stay up to date
in their specialty area,
build peer support and
bring new ideas into the
classroom. This
benefits the faculty and the
student. It helps to
reinvigorate
us in our love for nursing
and education.
We've also used the funds
for um to help
with nursing salary and help to
retain them in our program
and currently to hire the
additional faculty that our program
needs, it would
be beneficial to
provide a stipend for mentoring
faculty programs
like this is something that
dean to and I were
just speaking about is, you know,
I have a new full time
faculty member
and I'm mentoring
them. But wouldn't it be nice
to have
a faculty
person mentor, the
new faculty so I could
focus on the leadership of the
program um
and provide a stipend
to that, that faculty
mentor.
Um mentorship
is a full year at
minimum to two year commitment
which helps support and retain
faculty as they learn to navigate
being an educator and learning
university structures
very different than
coming from a health care
area.
Um The funds
have been used to create new positions
to support faculty and students
in the clinical and lab
update, broken
equipment and maintain
our cli clinical and simulation
plan.
Some of the challenges that we
face if you go to slide.
Five
um really recruitment
and retention of faculty,
the shortage of qualified nursing
educators hampers our ability
to expand proan
programs and accommodate more
students.
Unum Taos has been exceptionally
likely having the faculty
that we have now and
have had in the past.
In the fall of 2019,
we expanded our program from
admitting every other year to
admitting annually. This
was manageable for the first
semester
with two faculty
with the two faculty that we
had. Then things
snowballed as the busier
semester started COVID
set in and the nuances of
leading to co two
cohorts or two classes
emerged like many
other nursing programs. We've had
many changes since that
time and are at a place
where we need to expand our faculty
to continue to support our program
effectively. We
use part time faculty that are
great teachers. Though our nursing
program would benefit by additional
full time faculty to understand
the curriculum from beginning to
end, provide student
support within the program and
complete other
professional aspects for
a nursing program that part time
faculty do not
provide
barriers to increasing
nursing faculty.
Some are simple there,
there's not a desire to leave
a clinical practice
and enter into academia
related to a decrease in
salary
there. And there are less
nurse nurses
specializing in nursing
education, reducing the applicant
pool,
there are limited nurse educators
or nurses with master's degree in
nursing in the Taos area
which decreases the chance
for a position to be filled.
If someone is interested in
applying from an outside of
our area, there are
challenges
related to the high cost of
housing and housing
availability
and there are also differences in
our university structure for
salary. Um The salary
of a full time faculty at branch
campuses is
unequal and less desirable
of that to the Albuquerque
campus, potentially
losing faculty related to
higher salary and closer
proximity to
resources.
And then I do need to say that
U and M Albuquerque
Albuquerque currently
has faculty vacancies as
well
>> just on that, that one
thing your graduates
can step into a job at
Holy Cross
at 100 and 30,000 a
year.
>> That would be wonderful.
>> What do they get when they go to Holy
Cross?
I I would I do it
was just here. I wonder if you slipped
away, >> I can get that information
to you later.
No, those are national averages.
>> That's >> and so
that would be the um
kind of the easiest way to
for me to pull overall
statistics on that information.
But the the
idea of that is very
true where there are
registered nurses
who are practicing at the
bedside or in clinical
areas,
make at
least like
25% more
than a graduate
prepared nurse. Educator.
When I was a nurse
before I became a nursing
into nursing education,
I was easily making
70,000,
working nine months out of the
year
I was offered
from and this is at
main campus.
Um I was
offered
63,000
and I was to be very happy
about that.
And
no, yes, it's a
bonus
you're working for, you're
working aca academia
now.
Um,
>> but think of the parking place you
got. >> Yeah, that is
so true. That is so true.
When I started the program, we
were in a basement
across the street from the
hospital. And so we
feel very blessed that our
community supports U and
M's House and supports the
nursing program and
did refurbish these
buildings for you. So
thank you everybody on for
that.
Um
So continue
to continuing
to support professional development
for faculty will allow us to
support the education of other
adjuncts to meet master's
requirements as full time
faculty. That's, that's
really um probably
our best plan to put into
action. You know, there's been some
rule changes with
the um new um
the Nursing Practice Act that
allows BS
M prepared um
faculty to teach
as long as they have a contract
and continue
into their master's
in nursing education.
Um
Otherwise, providing
incentives such as tax
credits would be another
another positive step for
nurse educators. It may
help attract nurses to become
educators in our communities.
Currently, there are tax
credits for rural health care
providers, but
not for those
who are providing the education,
enabling the providers to
practice.
Um
Then for slide
six, the challenges
for the students.
Um the challenge of
growing our program
related to student preparedness,
there's a decrease in preparedness
for nursing for the students
who are applying because they have
many because they
may have to repeat courses
in order to meet the requirements
of the programs.
Um So
students are
delaying
it, um applying
for the programs because they
have to keep repeating these
courses.
Students in the program
are, are, are
unprepared for the rigor of the
program, causing them to step
out and repeat or
fail out of the program
altogether. And granted,
it's not always
um those
repeating of the courses
or having to step out for a little bit
of time, you know,
oftentimes it's really
that compounding effect
of not
being in a in
a program
focused um
course before
having the complications
of the economics of
maintaining a family
household and
trying to study
and prepare for the nursing
education.
Um continued
funding will allow us to
maintain and enhance the
student support services that we
have just initiated
and then I mentioned this before,
but students are having to work as
primary foc as a
primary focus instead of being
able to focus on their
education, they make
choices not to apply for a
program because they do not
think um they
have or think that they
will have the financial support
needed to get them through the
program. Continued
funding will allow us to maintain
our ways of offsetting the cost
of the program and support students
entering and
completing.
So as we navigate
the challenges of addressing health
care needs in New Mexico,
it is imperative to invest
in nursing education through
faculty recruitment and
retention and through
student support. Before
and during the nursing program,
your continued support and
strategic allocation of
resources can help mitigate these
barriers and enhance the quality
of nursing education in our
state. By doing
so, we not only strengthen
our health care system but also
ensure that our residents receive
the highest standards of care.
Thank you for your time and
dedication.
>> Thank you now,
Centipede.
>> So I
believe that
um
Dawn and Shana
painted a really
clear picture of what
nursing education looks
like. We need
students. They may
or may not be well
prepared and we need
instructors
and that's hard.
That's not easy and that's not
easy to answer.
And if you are
looking at
ways of mitigating
those things, what do we
do? Where are we
at? I
want to share just a couple
of uh
stories.
One
is an
educator
who came to me and said,
Terry,
this wasn't planned
but I'm pregnant
and I'm like, congratulations.
This is wonderful.
She has two
Children
who are young, very
young under four
and now a third one on the
way
when her little
boy was born,
he's nine months old. His
name is Milo.
She couldn't find child
care. He
is nine months
old.
He can start
this month
attending a
daycare.
Nine months.
She has had to
juggle and I've been as
flexible as I
absolutely could
be. But
this was a real
struggle for her. She
looked for private daycare,
she looked for
anything she could, she
absolutely utilized her
mother and
mother-in-law.
She absolutely
utilized as many
personal resources
as she could,
it was almost physically
impossible for
her to take care of everything
she needed to take
care of. Now,
those other two Children
that she had were on two different
schedules because
they're different
ages.
Imagine that happening with a
student with
fewer
resources.
What does that look
like? Or even a
student who has everything
together? I had a
student. Oh, she was
one of my favorite
nursing students.
She's,
I want to go to nursing school.
She made it happen. She
worked hard, she failed
classes. She repeated classes.
She did everything she could
to be successful.
And it comes time for finals
week. She also has
a newborn.
She had
daycare back
up for her daycare and back up
for her backup. She
was like the girl scout of
all nursing students. She was
prepared.
Daycare,
closed
back up for her daycare, caught
the flu, the backup
for her backup, caught the
flu because they're all part of the same
family. She's
like, what do I
do?
I said, well, if you're
comfortable, I was a
pediatric nurse. Bring
your baby to me and I will
watch her
while you are attending
or taking your finals.
Like we can work this out.
We will work this
out.
This, these
are just two examples
of a big
issue for students
and faculty.
Yes, we can't find faculty
that are academically
prepared. Yes,
we have students who are having
trouble becoming
academically prepared, but
once they're there
can they teach and can
they come to
class
that wrap around
support
is almost
necessary.
What is it like to have
childcare
that you can rely
on? What is
it like not to
have? Housing
insecurity or food
insecurity, mental
health care?
What do all of those
things mean to
students and
faculty?
Those are huge,
huge issues and those are not
little issues. Those
would be things that
I would look at
and I granted I am
not now just running
one program. I'm overseeing
quite a few other programs and
I do see these
issues. These
are,
they're repeated over and
over many faculty, many
students,
they need more
support. How
do we get them that
support? How do we provide that
support? What does that
look like?
We absolutely have
counseling, free
counseling service free on
campus. We
have a daycare service that
prioritizes students.
They also have a waiting list
of over 100
Children.
It doesn't mean they're not
prioritizing students. They
are, there are
waiting lists at every child
care
center.
So looking at those
more globally, what
does that mean?
Ok. So that's once we get
them in, how do we support
them? What about
the pipeline?
How do we get our
pipeline? Somebody
said, how, what age do you
start? And I'm like as soon as we
can get them in the
door.
So we have started doing
outreach and this
is stem
oriented, but it includes
nursing because we do
finger tasks,
which is a lot of fun for
kids. I'm telling
you
for all ages,
starting at kindergarten.
What does it look like to have a
science fair
on your campus?
It's a lot of fun. I'm
telling you.
So, really trying to
get people in and
making our
programs
and labs available for our
community,
we have a community college.
It really does belong to
our community.
So really thinking about
how we support
them
once we get
them in our
doors,
is it academic?
Absolutely.
But what are all of the
other issues that our students are
dealing with?
Can they afford to live in
Santa Fe?
Typically not unless they're living
with family or they have
another income coming into
their homes.
So those are things to
truly think about
when you're looking at trying
to provide,
stipends, provide
support, provide health
care, mental
health care.
What does all that look
like? So
my asks are much
larger than what they're
looking at? My asks
are looking at overall
health and well being
for faculty
and
students.
What does that look like?
Additional
counselors on campus,
possibly additional
childcare providers?
Absolutely.
I believe this
is the conclusion of
our presentation and
we will all stand for
questions.
>> Let's start on this side this
time, Senator Stefanik, you
have any questions?
>> Um I do
have one question
uh specifically the Santa Fe
Community College because I've had
experience talking
to students there.
Um who at
the college is responsible
in assisting the
student and
learning about the
financial
coverage for their
education.
Like I've ran run into
people in a very
informal way
and we start talking
about their next
steps and
they don't know what's
happening. One student
thought it was their academic
advisor. Somebody else
thought it was the
financial aid office.
So maybe you could >> answer
that. So the experts
are the financial aid department
and the reason I say
start there,
they are aware of
everything that's available to
students. They also work
really closely with our
foundation in providing
scholarships. So they're
aware of all
of the scholarship opportunities
that are available to our students.
That's not to say that
academic advisor,
directors of programs
are not aware either,
they are equally
able to direct
students and
help assist them
getting to where to
meeting their needs and getting
them to where they need to be.
>> So Mr Chair, it sounds like you
all are doing a great job.
Thank you very much.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you Senator Senator
SIA Lopez
>> Mr Chair. I am so grateful
for all of your work and, and
while you may not get as paid as
much, there is the joy of,
of the work. So,
um, but I,
um, I was really
concerned about
the, the LSATs,
the AC T scores
being lower. It
seems like that's a problem we have
throughout education in New
Mexico, the
middle school says they're
not completely ready
for middle school. So they're doing
remedial work. High school
says that they're not ready for high
school. They're doing remedial
work,
they get to college or
community college, they're not
quite ready, they're doing remedial
work. And
one of the things that concerned me is
the law school
rather than take
lower LSAT
scores and
doing some
additional remedial
work, decided to shrink
the class instead
and shrink it to
85 less,
less than 85%
of what it was before
to. And
that really
um is upsetting and
concerning. And so
I ask all of
you, um how are you
dealing with the,
with the issue of the lower
lsats? Um
Like I said, I hate the law school
strategy of shrinking the class
but interested in what you are
doing
>> to clarify, you mean the
SAT score
>> ac T
whatever it is that whatever
it is, whatever the, the,
the,
the standardized
test is that you
use, um
because we're seeing that with
standardized tests
throughout
with, for the law school and I hope I
didn't misspeak, it's the
LSAT that is
for you.
I think it's the AC T, but maybe
you use a SAT, I don't
know.
>> I believe each individual
program uses a different
test. We use
something called the Hesse
exam. It
tests on math, English
and science.
We have a minimum score
that they must attain. We
do not, we have not
changed that or
shifted that score
since we've instituted
it, essentially,
it's about
supporting students before they
take it.
And then of course, when they're
in the program supporting them while
they're in the program.
Ok,
>> Mr Chair Senator,
we utilize a T
I which is a entrance exam for
nursing. And so with
those stats I gave with the AC T was
just showing how we see students coming
out of
education into higher
ed and they're struggling.
Um we have still been able to make
our cohorts every semester,
but we are seeing those numbers
drop and when we look at
expanding our programs,
um look, are we would
we be able to do that? Would we have enough
students? And so
again, we're looking at those supports
we can do in the program, but
really looking at how can we support
those students when they, I mean,
all the way back, right? But really
looking in the college and those prereq
courses, those courses
that are so foundational
to be successful in nursing
and how can we support those studentss
better. How can we do?
Um, we've looked at doing
seminars, academic
prep days where they come
in and we can do reviews with them to
help them get those test scores
up. We use some of the
funding to purchase,
um, some review courses
through A T I
to help hopefully some
scores up for that.
But yeah, it's, it's a
concern. It's a concern
statewide. It's a concern nationally
and to see that even this
year those numbers that was small
but they continue to drop
really looks at how is that going to
impact us in higher education
down the line.
>> You don't do any conditional
admissions
in terms of
we're admitting you, you don't need
it but you need to meet it by such
and such date. >> We don't, we
have enough where we can bring them in and
then those that don't, we do
encourage them to come back and
talk to our advisor.
We give them the prep course
of looking at some other things to try
to help them when they are ready
to reapply to the
program.
>> And we do, we
do, um, something similar.
We have, um,
it's a eight
week, um, prep
workshop and a boot camp
kind of thing. Well, I guess
it's kind of like a boot boot camp.
It's, it's a
two,
our course every
week and each
week there is,
um, a focus on
a either different, um, like test
taking skills,
um, or specific
content that's on that entrance
exam. And regardless of
the company, it's always
looking at the same thing,
reading comprehension,
math science,
um
and
um
providing that workshop
has been supportive of
the students
and
>> this is a preadmission
>> workshop. It's
preadmission.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Have you
seen that there is
a racial or ethnic
difference in
achieving those
scores?
>> Yeah.
Um
at U and M
ta.
Um when
we, this is what I can
respond to best
at U and M House. When we first
started our program, it
was um a
lot of students
who were coming back for their,
for their second degree and
they were white
currently
um like
over like 8
to 10 years. You know,
there was more
word to word
of mouth and um
students started
coming to U and M TAOS
completing their prerequisites
and coming into our program.
And so currently our
program is very
representational of
our Taos community.
Um And I don't
um I
don't see
um
like a, a true kind of
disparity um
on those scores, but again, I
haven't pulled those specific
statistics.
>> So nationally
studies have been
done that
standardized test
scores do
definitely a, a
person of color does
not score as
well.
Unfortunately, for
the nursing program, all
of our nursing programs
in order for them to become
licensed nurses,
they have to take a standardized
exam. So
we are
limited and
that we have to
prepare them for
standardized exams, we
prepare them as much and
as well as we absolutely
can. But that
is the benchmark at
this time
for becoming a registered
nurse across
the country.
So, while it isn't
as representative
as I would like it to be
personally,
it is part of the
reality that we have to deal
with.
Unfortunately,
>> Mr Chair Senator, I would
just echo those same
comments. Um, I would
say over the
years, I've, I've been doing this that
we have, we've had seen,
um, some numbers
decreased in some of the underrepresented
groups, but I would say probably over
the last two or three years, it's kind
of just been across the board where we're
seeing, um, a
decline in that
in the prep and the
scores on the entrance
exam. >> Thank
you. And do you
believe that the entrance
exam score
is correlated to their
performance on the
RN
exam?
>> It's I would
say that not necessarily exactly
to the exam but to their
success in the program
that we have seen the correlation
as we've tracked them over the years
that like I mentioned, we use the A T
I exam and we have been
able to track those numbers.
And again, students have to
meet a proficiency level.
But I've noticed even those that are at the
very minimum level
and they were accepted tend
to be our students that struggle
who had to repeat courses
maybe have been dismissed from the
program. Um and
some that have been ultimately
successful. But I have noticed that
those even at the at the minimum
to come in um
struggle.
>> Mm
and we use the A T
I company, I'm sorry, Mr
Chair Senator.
Um we use the A
T I company um
as well. And
according to the company
and this would be the same probably
for all of the companies that have
entrance exams for nursing is
it's predictive of how
well a student will do that
first
semester.
And most of our
students, if they can get over the
first semester, you
know, they'll have better
success kind of going into the
second semester. Usually,
like our students tend to
leave either the first semester
or maybe the second
semester.
>> And finally, Mr
Chair. Do you believe that the
entrance exam
and the RN test
is that,
do you believe it's a valid
test of
the skills that
they need in his
nurses?
>> I absolutely believe
that the NCLEX
RN and the NCLEX
PN are valid
exams.
They are
rebuilt every
three years
with a
huge amount
of research and
effort put into
right now into
creating new
exams. So the NCLEX
currently and it started
this this year, right?
Clinical judgment,
the clinical judgment model.
So what they've
done is
they've shifted it
to rote memorization
of knowledge, to
understanding
what clinical
judgment truly is.
How do you test on clinical
judgment? They
spend a lot of time doing
research on that and
they've been rolling that
out and it's been
very successful
at testing
where students
are at in understanding
the complexities of taking
care of patients.
Now, when you're
looking at an entrance
exam for a nursing
program, you're
looking at success in
the nursing program, not
ultimately success as
a nurse. So it's
hard to say,
were they successful as a nurse?
Because they passed that entrance
exam? It really
is more. Do they
have the skills necessary
to be successful in that
nursing program.
>> Thank you. Well, that's good to hear
that the exam has been
modified because a rote
memory exam has been
found not to be valid
with regret. Good.
Ok. Thank you, Mr Chair. I
appreciate the opportunity to
explore that >> question.
Thank you, Senator
Senator Tallman. Let's start with
you.
>> So
he said
you mentioned that the problem with
daycare. It's a
problem all over the country.
I just read the other day that 80
80% of the daycare
centers are now
owned by uh
private equity
firms who
were brought up
these firms and, and
you know, their whole business
model is to
squeeze as much
money out of it and sell
assets. So there have been
a lot of consolidations driven
up the cost. It's ridiculous. I
have a neighbor who told me
his da his daughter is paying
$1600 a month
for, for
childcare.
So we get,
unfortunately, we don't treat
daycare like a
service.
It's a business
to make money. We got
plenty of money to bail out the banks.
We got plenty of money to give
to the military. We got plenty of
money to give subsidies
and tax breaks to companies,
but we don't have money
to subsidize and
provide people with adequate
daycare. It's
ridiculous.
>> Ok.
Representative Herndon.
Just >> a clarification
question. Mr chair
presenters. If you
take the nclex
exam and you have an A
SN, then you can practice
as an RN what
exam do you take if you have
an A NBN
degree, do you take another
exam?
Ok. Thank
you,
>> Senator Po.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I'll be quick. I just
want, you know,
do a little bit like Senator Tollman.
I think you just brought up a lot of
the issues we deal with. We
try to support
one group
and I think we
try to do and we do the right
thing. But then you look
at those folks that are trying
to support them and
what it all comes down to it, right?
We're trying to help nurses,
we're trying to help teachers, we're trying to
help educators, we,
but then what do we do with the folks who are
working daycare? We're trying
to, you know, improve
behavioral health,
you know, we're getting our
psychologists or psychiatrists
or social workers.
But what about the CNAs and the
folks that support them? Right?
And so I think
we need to have a
real conversation about what
we're going to do to make sure that we take
care of everyone.
Um when it comes
to a living wage to be in
these positions,
address the support
that they need because these are tough
jobs that
some folks just after
a while need a break or say
I can't do this anymore. So what are we
going to look at as far as systems
to give folks a break
and maybe they can come back.
So I just think these
are real discussions that we
need to have here and
even at the federal level of
how we're going to address these issues or it's
just gonna keep happening over
and over again. Thank you, Mr
Chair
>> Representative Chavez.
I >> don't have any questions, but I did
wanna just ditto what's
already been said, I mean,
you know, and a living wage
is important, $15 is
not a living wage anymore,
right? Um, jobs with
benefits.
Um, we don't need
to, you know,
have be supporting,
you know, sort of
what we're doing is
it's, we're basically saying
it's ok for people to live in
poverty. We're not, you know, we're
using sort of the budget as an
excuse. You know, I
think Senator
Tallman, you know, when
he basically included
the military in the conversation, we've
got billions to send
away, right?
Israel is a good example
and that money would do more
good here. Thank
you.
>> Well, I, I just want
to thank you
and, and all the nursing programs
in the state for really
stepping up. And I think the,
the consortium that you
all formed
a great model. We,
we were talking about
that this morning is a model
that possibly
the social work programs and the
behavioral health programs in the state
might adopt as well.
They're trying to articulate
the AAA programs
that the community colleges
and the branches with the
Bachelor's and master's
level programs. And
so, you know, you've, you've kind of
charted a path forward,
but everybody's facing the same
dilemma. How do you find
faculty? How
do you, how do you find support
for students who,
who need to be
mentored or preceptor?
And, and
uh there's nobody to do it.
And uh it's just
we're short bodies.
So your job is to go out there
and find more bodies for us.
So, thank
you so much for your presentation,
really helpful information.
And I want to thank you again
for the work you do as well
as for the presentation.
So members that, that
wraps it up for today,
there is the reception at
Monte Agrado
and then tomorrow we'll, we'll,
we don't need to start quite as
promptly. So
we'll be in at 905
tomorrow.
>> So, so we're starting
late.
>> What's that?
905?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So with that, we
will
call the meeting adjourned.
