we're going to have to
compromise, uh, in some cases a
lot more than we wanted to, and
that, uh, one of the reasons I
must admit that perhaps that
this didn't make it through the
finish line is because we
weren't willing to take
amendments, um, to allow for,
that I have probably led a lot
of that in putting a lot of
blame on the governor's office,
pointing fingers, and we, and we
want to burn it all down and
start over, and I believe in
this amendment.
and dismantle an agency. The
role of this ombudsman is to
champion
The best interest of the
Population that they advocate
some reservation with it, but I
understand that in order to get
the best bill across the finish
line, um, we, I cannot continue
appreciate the amendment and I
will support both the amendment
and of course, uh, a very, very
good bill.
Thank you, Senator Brantley. We
do have further debate. We are
in the.
And again on the webcast.
Apparently, our broadband in
this building just doesn't
function well. So if he could
get that solved, maybe we can
get the Office of Broadband over
here and see if they can do
something about it.
We're back up again, senators.
The webcast is back up. Senator
Tobiasson, you have the floor.
We are in Senate floor Amendment
#5. We are debating the
amendment.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Which is they do not have the
office of the child advocate.
And I think that's an important
thing to look at.
And then secondly,
The first thing I learned about
when you have a really good
negotiation.
And I think most of us in this
room can agree.
That what's happening with CI
And this is our best effort this
session to come together and
move the needle for the welfare
of the children in New Mexico,
We are on the amendment.
See
Senator Cervantes.
one of the more important parts
of this was eliminating the
subpoena authority. I, I just
would advise members that
doesn't trouble me very much
because, um, anytime anybody
brings a lawsuit, the lawyers
not concerned about that. I
think the, the one of the
concerns that I do have though,
uh, senator is
On your paragraph 4, and this is
the convening of the nominating
committee and then actually
bill, the appointment of an
advocate is specified there's a
deadline for doing so. Is that
not right? Is there in the
existing bill without the
amendment, there's a deadline
for the convening of the
Mr. President, uh, I believe so.
Senator Cervantes, yeah, Mr.
President, I'll help you find
that senator, but, but I, I'm,
I'm certain that's true, and,
and by this amendment, what
amendment earlier, which is this
is never gonna happen. Uh, we're
going from a bill that has
deadlines and dates.
That say certain certain things
amendment, paragraph 4 says on
page 4, line 20, strike
semicolon and an insert in lieu
thereof a period. Well, and,
and, and you're right, Senator.
The remaining composition that
that helped me to understand,
Senator, the, the community show
elect a chair from the
committee's membership, I think
Senator
Mr. President, yes, rather than
having a separate outside person
who is selected as chair, the
President, by, for one, by
removing the member uh appointed
by the AG we would otherwise
have an even-numbered committee.
Um, and then let me just ask you
on the last paragraph of 15.
The attorney general should
develop procedures to prevent
conflicts of interest.
Mr. President, they certainly
should, and this would ensure
that in this case they do. I
think there is a significant
Thank you, Mr. President and
thank you Senator for uh let me
ask you some questions about
this movement. I'm, I'm
struggling to again try and put
this in place with all the other
Seeing no further debate on the
amendment.
Senator to close on the
amendment.
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr.
and do a veto override and, and
while I think that would sure be
interesting as a legislator, uh,
I think that when we have the
opportunity to get buy-in.
Uh, it is very important to me
that this pass and that this
work in a, in a productive,
functional way. The likelihood
headline and the pat ourselves
on the back, or we could do
The same compromise process that
we do day in and day out when
work the way they are intended
to. So with that, Mr. President,
I move the Senate floor

Yeah, we're back on the bill so
I will yield to Sandragos on the
bill.
Senator Cervantes do you yield.
Yes, you.
Mr. President, Senator
Cervantes, I, I was just
wondering if your experts there
topic, same idea is Senate Bill
373, uh, the, um,
Uh, we had a committee sub
actually, Mr. President, and
behind me don't have an answer
to you. Uh, perhaps you could do
it yourself. Tell us.
Senators, well, Mr. President,
Senator, I think you'd sort of
like, uh, uh, Representative
Passed in the in the uh chamber
by the Democrats and it's just
really good to know that we do
come to agreement on some
things. There's some pretty
cool, critical issues here in
here Bill that I, uh,
had any, uh, anyone in the
department that uh.
Mr. President, Senator, the, the
Department of CYFD has had a lot
of lawsuits, and I'm just
not, not with me, um
contrary to maybe some
supposition I
didn't confer with the trial
lawyers or any lawyers about any
um, when you were in committee,
do you know who your opposition
was on this bill, Mr. President
Senator Cervantes.
spoke in opposition to the bill
was the secretary of Children
and Youth Families.
Sangos.
Well, thanks for that, Mr.
President. Senator. I, I guess
But, uh, you know, thank you,
Mr. President.
Thank you, Senator Gaos.
We do have further debate with
Senator Brantley.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't
amendments that we just made,
um, would be really the only
noticeable difference that we,
we know that the first step
In fixing a problem is
identifying the problem, and
Oversight of an agency that we
all agree is failing and
troubled.
The difference between
The bill this year and in years
improve. And for that we stand
united as chambers.
With our house colleagues who
have brought this over, we stand
united on both sides of the
aisle and from the legislative
gone ignored that this is the
year that we actually bring very
Meaningful change, because the
good news to all of this is that
solutions exist.
this forward, and I am hopeful
for New Mexico. Thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Brantley, seeing no further
debate.
Senator Cervantes to close on
the bill.
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr.
by the work year to year and,
uh, I, I didn't have very much
to do with drafting this bill.
In fact, uh, I think the only
thing that I had to do with
drafting this bill was really,
uh, some of the amendments made
um, so you are allowed closing
remarks and then to go on to the
script. I saw one of the
senators trying to get your
attention. I thought maybe you
were gonna recognize him. Uh, I,
I, I do want to recognize
Senator Geos, but I, I, the
is the reason his bill may not
have passed in 2023 if it, if it
did stopped in Senate Judiciary,
Senator Gallos, it did not stop
because you're a Republican.
It, it did not stop because of
then they're repackaged, uh, and
put into a democrat form and
then they pass.
And, and I, and I won't, I won't
disagree that happens.
But Senator guy goes, that's not
fact you're a Republican.
Had to do with the fact that I
pointed out in the earlier
debate discussion, I disagree
fundamentally as a business
that. It, it, it has struck me
wrong.
For all of the 7 years that I've
protected.
The executive branch.
And honor the executive branch
request for more time.
And I feel really terrible
about.
Because, because by giving them
more and more time,
voicing the mediators and
arbitrators findings and not by.
Making this a stronger issue.
I think I've hurt some kids.
So center guy goes, I.
I want you to understand it's
not Republican.
longer.
It's hurting some kids that are
living under desks.
We've taken and placed there.
I move that House Bill 5 as

you, um, I know last week we
talked about uh the dress code
and uh making sure that we're at
the strict adherence of the
dress code, and you guys have
done that you've done that all
the decorum and we talk about uh
where we are as a Senate. I
think you guys have done a
tremendous job. There's been
reminders of having to look at
the chair, not sitting on the
seats.
even to our house members that
when you enter the chamber that
we do have a dress code in the
Senate we're gonna uphold that.
so blue jeans, uh, would not be
allowed in the chamber, so I
just wanted to make sure to make
mention on that, Mr. President,
I'd prefer black jeans because
they really do slim me down.
Would that be OK? I think you'd
look great in black jeans,
senators, so you go ahead and
wear those tomorrow. Thank you,
Mr. President, don't we still
have casual Saturdays?
relaxed. I won't say completely
casual. still gotta wear your
bow tie.
