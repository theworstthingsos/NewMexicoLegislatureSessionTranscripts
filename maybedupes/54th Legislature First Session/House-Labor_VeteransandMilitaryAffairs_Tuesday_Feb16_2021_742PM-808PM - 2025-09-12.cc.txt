Representative Rubio.
Representative Stapleton.
Representative two thousand.
At.
Comment on.
President.
Mr Chairman up on.
I'm here did you representative
Ross is president yes and
Representative Rubio was on to.
We've got a quarter we have just
about everybody here
Representative Harper.
The Huskies years.
Thank you chairman of the
committee members it's a
pleasure to bring before you
Hospital seven twenty two to
twenty seven.
Two seventy seven it's been a
long day.
So just just a touch of
background so I I other
constituents reach out to me
about your house bill.
And she was employed the state
and you know how is it now has
the parent connection.
And very early on in his career
when we first started she was
married
and put that spouse down into
his beneficiary.
but then shortly after that they
were divorced.
And he's had different styles
for for this long time and they
still have a good relationship
and this former spouse
But.
He right now is not able to
change the beneficiary from his
access to his current spouse and
is it's access is willing to do
it she says I'd be happy to sign
a paper to do it that's fine.
but he can't under current rules
and so what we have here is a
bill that says.
If you want to exercise this
option to change your
beneficiary.
you can you can do it but you
have to have written permission
of the former of the current
beneficiary to make the change
so after commission of the
spouse very.
Then you have to pay a hundred
dollars to the Department to to
para to socially rerun actuarial
sin and make this change for.
But then you can choose a
different beneficiary.
so we know what this bill
together and we can introduce a
last three day session because
it wasn't germane so he's been
waiting for a long time for this
for this bill but that's
essentially what it does
I do notice some people and and
the audience you have actually
reached out to me is talking
about what about this
we are grateful to hear from
from them I will just
mention that.
I have heard that there's
potentially some different
language that the department
would like.
And I'm totally fine with that
I'm whatever changes make it
better for them to.
To adopt so was that are chair
also requests.
Thank you Sir I'm on muted we we
are not online unit so what I'll
do at this time I will go to the
audience or do you do the
attendees and that anyone who
wants to speak for or against
this bill I will give me a
couple minutes if you'll raise
your hand.
And we'll go from there.
Anybody raise your hand.
Greg Trujillo Sir okay.
Because I lost.
The on my side of the screen and
yes Sir live in the New World.
Mr he of.
Yes good evening Mr chairman
members I'm Gregory hill with
the public employees retirement
association
appreciate the opportunity to to
speak to you on this I should
note are the parable or has not
had a chance to take a position
on this legislation just yet
however after initial review it
doesn't appear that there there
will be a cost with this bill.
Era does currently will provide
it in a limited capacity for
retired members to change their
beneficiary after retirement
those limitations apply to non
spouses that were selected at
the time of retirement so as
Representative Harper said the
pair Act does not allow.
For selection of changing a
spouse with their consent
whether it be an expose
you know after retirement and
and looking at this bill that
would allow for that to that
opportunity it is an issue that
we do come across from time to
time and we're happy to work
with the the Representative in
the committee to look at this
bill and maybe clean up some of
the language so it it
accomplishes what he is
intending it to accomplish and
happy to stand for any questions
or chime in as needed Mr chair.
Thank you and I I hope to hang
for well we'll go to the bill
because I'm pretty sure that
we're probably going to have
some questions for you.
Yes Sir happy to do so thank you
all of the tiered.
What was the next.
We have Carla go ahead and admit
yourself.
Actually it's Larry Mr chair and
members of the committee this is
Leri Sonntag on behalf of the
New Mexico business coalition in
BC represents hundreds of
businesses and thousands of New
Mexicans our focus is to make
New Mexico a better place to do
business so that our people have
jobs and to provide for their
families.
We appreciate Representative
Harper bringing this bill
forward HB to seventy seven and
allowing changes to be made to
the fishery of public employees
to our growing retirement is a
reasonable fix and I understand
there may be some language that
threw up officials may want to
tweak but we stand in support of
the two two seven seven and
encouraging you to do so as well
thank you.
Do we have anybody else wants to
speak.
Not.
That being the case number of
the committee and I see
a Representative right your
hands.
So.
Your thank you Mr chairman.
Representative Harper this this
bill.
If you don't have spells
agreement let's say you get
divorced and your your court
ordered by the judge.
That.
Your spouse is no longer
entitled to this is this will
this bill cover that situation
Representative Mr Chairman.
So
Chairman and Representative
thank you for the question a
great question if you look at
the bill on page three.
it's why it's so section see
lines ten through twelve it says
the member spouse provided a
notarized written statement
expressing their concentric
which that designation as the
survivor beneficiary so.
there is that protection there I
guess you could call it
so that that is a condition of
being a change for
beneficiaries.
Current issue has to provide
accurate statement and thank you
Mr chairman and Representative
Harper.
Unfortunately this will not help
one of my constituents.
It's been fighting the same
issue because is court ordered
and it was not an amicable
divorce.
I'm in he's been trying to get
his change by three or four
years new wife same situation.
so.
We would that be something that
you could amended Representative
Harper so
Mr chair and Representative lack
I would probably.
Say no at this time I think it's
important to take
little steps little bites of
this.
I think.
Thank you Mr Trujillo said that
the department often are the
parasols are often approach with
this problem this could
potentially take care of a lot
of.
Those issues not all of them
obviously.
But I would.
I would say probably for this
first step probably not but we
can look at doing something like
that in the future if this turns
out well.
Thank you for that
Representative
I guess that's all the questions
I have Mr chairman thank you.
Representative Garcia.
Thank you.
So much chairman and and thank
you Representative Harper
I haven't had the opportunity to
read the bill.
But the my questions are such
Are we just dealing with spouses
in terms of.
Beneficiary designation.
Else.
Chairman according chairman or
CEO that that's exactly right
I'm I believe Mr chair he'll
mention that there is a
mechanism to deal with non
spousal dependent changes right
now.
I'm not sure those details if
you have questions we can ask
him about that this does just
deal with this cpaps.
Okay because a Mr Chairman
representative are per
I think quite a few
But he cases of
A retired era.
That are up in age.
And in both cases.
Mr chair.
I had the disabled children that
are adults.
Thank you for all their lives.
And
And and and maybe this is
something we can look at in the
future not spoken with the pair
of folks on this.
But the the pair of our members
Mr chair of opted to go with an
option to where the only benefit
that their budget sherry would
have would be if she passed away
and there was a pending L..
That that's the only thing that
would go to the.
beneficiary.
And
and and they didn't opt out for
the other plan which was.
they have to pay more for it but
upon the the pair retiree
passing away the beneficiary
what kind of
Of the get an equal amount to
what the retiree was getting
in her lifetime.
And
And parent can do.
A switch out.
But what would happen and this
is the difficult part is that
they retire he would have to
kind of paying back.
All that difference in the time
that she been Reese receiving
those benefits so it's really
costly to be able to do it that
way but so that was my concern
with your legislation if it just
apply to spouses.
Because this other issue Mr
chairman the kind of a take a
little bit more I.
In terms of how we make it
equitable really make it happen.
Because in the final analysis Mr
chair representative Harper.
these poor of disabled.
children that are dolls in one
case he's you know fifty five.
And and the retiree is the only
caretaker.
In his life and then the other
one you know he's forty forty
five.
So you can see that when the
retiree passes away.
that the child adult.
Is going to get us just so
security.
In line for a lot of.
Of individuals in that scenario
we're we're.
Back in the morning ten dollars
a month.
You know so
that's my question Mr chair and
Representative Harper on thank
you.
Thank you.
Committee.
In one of.
I.
Hello question number one.
Yes and I think or
Representative blancos kind
including to this page you get
hit on the spot you have a a new
course he careens influences
Madam.
Is
part of the retirement.
There's no way it does not allow
that to change.
Chairman that's that's a great
question and and the answer is.
No.
This would only allow someone to
change their surviving spouse
beneficiary designation.
what happens in a in a court
room and that no not judge says.
Thanks Amanda retirement next
why not retirement.
That that would not be impacted
by this.
So.
Question is still retires.
And they decide for some reason
or another they decide to leave
a the like Representative under
C. L. talking about basically
instead of leaving the
retirement through the styles
they were the one to one of
their children that can still be
done.
Chairman great great question
yes it's my understanding
there's four different options
for advisement on ABC NBC.
And I think C. D. after refer
to.
Our children
and this doesn't touch that at
all.
I'm.
Chairman again there's always
thirteenth there my lemons and I
still getting used to the idea
that there is not another chair
with the chairman.
Okay so.
So this the only thing this is
going to affect the only thing
that we're making the changes in
this if for some reason or
another the retiree of.
Divorces actually ends in
divorce happens before it's got
the new course to happen
probably before the retiree
retires Mike correct.
Chairman that's a great question
If you think you can get in
here.
I'll allow you to.
Is Mr chairman will
Representative Harper is looking
at that I do want to also
mention Susan Peters who is our
general counsel is on the call
as well so if we need to
to weigh in she can I will sing
looking at the bill it doesn't
appear it has to be as a result
of divorce as long as the
member retired in selected
option B. or C. E. which is an
option that allow for a survivor
beneficiary then after
retirement to the spouse
consents to changing that spouse
as a beneficiary we would we do
the calculation based on the age
of the retiree in the age of the
new well selected beneficiary.
Okay so this.
That for example.
As an example let's say I were
to retire from the legislature
today okay and I would leave my
son as a as a beneficiary the
amount of money my son would get
as big as a beneficiary of the
hard work say right would be a
lot less the amount of money
than what my spouse would get it
by correct because of the age
so.
Maybe Mr Trujillo correct me if
I'm wrong.
What what I've learned in this
and I was I just learned this
recently chairman.
Is that when you retire para
calculates based off of your
life expectancy your total
amount that you would get your
total now.
And if you designate your son as
the one who gets it.
What they'll do is they'll take
that total amount and they will.
Look at his life expectancy and
mill spreads that same tool now
crossed his entire life so
you'll get a lower monthly
benefit but over the entire
course of his life get the same
amount that you would have gone
if you got the full benefit over
your lifetime.
Right so I understand that.
Mr chairman and members of that
is correct however in the the
situation that that Cheryl Cole
on selected as someone we would
reduce Representative o'quinn's
portion over his lifetime so
we'd be taking a reduction up
front to fund that additional
benefit going forward on on
behalf of your son being your
beneficiary.
Understand okay so now the
question Mr both the mother and
the Representative Harper.
Do you understand that there
needs to be some changes here.
As you understand and agree to
the changes here and I imagine
respective.
was also there understand that
there needs to be some changes
in this legislation before we go
forward.
Where is the William next.
Yes
let's see where was this next I
think a state government.
Ask you this one question.
You mean working with the folks
on the P. R. A. Representative
all of this bill lately so I
Chairman great question I had a
great conversation with Mister
Trujillo last night
not to me and that alerted me
that.
it does look like there's to be
a fiscal impact it didn't look
like this was going to be.
Something the board would
immediately reject even though
we haven't gone to go to support
it.
And also they might have some
tweaks to language.
So I committed to him over the
phone last night said yeah I
wanna make sure we get this
right
and I'm happy to work with him
in a doc rivers language she
leaves with the.
Correct to get the intended
through and and also help them
with this issue the occasionally
have people wanting to change
their spouse.
Sure.
For a million estimated to
healing in what do you think how
long these things it would take
for amendments to be taken care
of this legislation before we
can go forward.
All the for to a Mr chairman
that's alright to Mr Trujillo.
Mr chairman and members
I think we can do a relatively
relatively quickly hi I believe
this
Section of the law has been
amended three or four times in
the last decade well if we are
opening it up again I think
there is some cleanup language
that we can work with
Representative Harper to to
address and I don't think it
would change the intent of the
bill I just think it's be an
opportunity to clean up of some
of the changes that have
occurred over in the past Mr
Chairman.
I'm sending any action on this
item was scheduled of the bill
what is today.
The sixteen Sir.
Okay.
It offers Jareth has always said
that and a house that was.
So what I'll do when we do it
someone just roll over today the
schedule for Thursday.
Amendments that.
By tomorrow afternoon or early
to earn the Thursday morning I
think we can get this bill
rolled and rolled out here so
when you get to state government
you got including the that you
can just sail through.
So.
The alleged you folks get to
work.
And we will see you Thursday Mr
chairman I only had one question
you haven't seen my hand up I
only have one question.
The question is very simple it
was on on page three number
three.
It said that it it it to it that
One becoming divorced from the
names files exercise.
A one time irrevocable option my
question is if.
Is it written in the way that if
you're divorced multiple times
you can do that.
So.
Yes chairman Representative
that's that's correct so.
There is
Yeah there's there's.
In current law.
The other section to their talks
about her upcoming divorced.
and court orders and such this
year we're adding section three
that says upon becoming divorced
you have this one time option so
if you become our again you
would have again at one time
option the only question I have
Mr chair.
Representative Harper thank you
god bless you.
So with that in mind was.
Thank you chairman.
And hopefully we'll see
everybody here there's thank you
thank you everyone the line I'm
still improved.
The night.
This.
Sir.
Hi Sir
our session is.
Up to three on Thursday do you
want to schedule committee for
after three hours you.
Yes Sir.
Thank
thank I have a good night.
