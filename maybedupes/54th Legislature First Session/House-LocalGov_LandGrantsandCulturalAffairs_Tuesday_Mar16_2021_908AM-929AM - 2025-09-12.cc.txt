Did you get Representative

Very I did but she didn't answer
but I see her up there this year
I'm here okay sorry
Representative Fajardo.
Yes I'm here Mr Chairman percent
that members we have a quorum
We we had the Senate bill two
seventy six.
Senator Shannon Pinto and the
she wants us to kind of roll
over of that legislation
indefinitely.
So we won't be taking that up I
don't see any
of the secretaries that we're
going to be showing up to date
and the attendees section.
To kind of address for
legislation so that bill's been
rolled over indefinitely
we also have a.
Senate bill two nine four
Senator Stefanics she hasn't
responded to my tax as of this
morning and she hasn't responded
to the emails and phone calls at
Mary's sent to her staff and to
starting yesterday afternoon so
we do have a memorial
that came to us just ten minutes
before the session ended last
night and will entertain that
memorial today
It and the reason that I'm
putting that on
and.
In a expedited manner is because
this issue has been before this
committee.
before in a bill format.
so the topics are relevant and
the issue is relevant in terms
of why we want to put it on this
morning so with that
we have a Representative Roger
Montoya on the house memorial
thirty three.
To put on here to put on your
memorial Representative Montoya.
Good morning chairman.
Garcia and members of our
wonderful committee back before
you with the new iteration of
what was house bill sixteen it
is now a memorial.
Much to the same tenor and tone
and scope of what we had in the
original bill is requesting the
New Mexico Legislative Council
to create a legislative interim
rural committee.
Through the memorial process.
If I may as a freshman has been
a really wonderful fumbling and
learning experience to navigate.
What I believe to be one of the
most pressing issues in
addressing the urban rural
divide with respect to so many
issues that we face but
pointedly water waste water
electricity internet broadband
services the focus of this
committee is to compose a
bicameral.
Fourteen member.
Focus to here and it had an
emergency clause it does not now
it's up to the the will.
Hopeful will the leadership to
make this happen
What the goal was is to kind of
meet the moment you know we're
in a real crisis and the comment
pandemic has absolutely
underscored the deficiencies
across our state in so many ways
but I have to say that as a
rural serving.
Representative or rural areas
are deeply deeply hurting
disproportionately for decades
they have been ignored and I
really the intent of the bill
and the memorial now is to
really please focus.
To look bipartisan blue across
ideologies put those to the
side.
Pave a road well we can move
forward together to address
these infrastructural
inequities.
Part of the research that I did
was to speak to the national
delegation from New Mexico and
they have assured me including
our governor that there will be
a massive infrastructure bill
coming from the slide in
administration and part of the
goal and reasoning.
Was to be prepared with roadmap
so we can know where to right
recommend where to deploy and
how to execute in the best
possible way.
I understand that there are four
standing committees that address
real issues.
And it is my hope that.
Tops this memorial will be an
inspiration to reconfigure to
some degree respectfully of the
work that's been done in a sense
are these committees bringing
the best possible product for
New Mexicans on these critical
issues I will stop their I don't
know the people have had a
chance to look at the memorial
because it's so fresh off the
press but we had to trance
transpose a bit it was sitting
in house rules and was not
allowed to be heard there and so
the only recourse I had was to
reverted to a memorial and I'm
happy and honored to answer any
questions by our committee or
the public for that matter.
Thank you.
Representative
All the.

anybody in attendance.

And we do have a senator Liz
Stefanics in the present
in fact I was going to have
present over the phone the.
Because we just what I didn't
know if my secretary had a a new
email that we have not been made
a successful in terms of getting
the link Senator.
Senator it's it's a pleasure
having you this morning and our
committee and let's get right
into your presentation so we
have a members of the committee
we our next item on the agenda
is Senate bill two nine four.
And Senate bill nine four.
Is marriage license and
certificate fees Senator
Stefanics to put on your
legislation thank you very much
take care members of the
committee my house co sponsor is
Representative Christine
Trujillo and we were approached
by the county clerk association
of our affiliate of the counties
association so they have
requested through this bill to
range raise marriage license
fees from twenty five dollars to
fifty dollars that's the entire
purpose of this bill the costs
for some of the counties for new
software and I. T. and record
keeping is how this new money
would be spent the money itself
would be a very small amount
that's raised about the maximum
maybe three hundred thousand a
year so we're not talking about
a lot of money but and it is a
request from the county clerk's
and I would stand for questions
and I'm not sure we need
our was my experts one of the
county clerk's and I don't see
her on here which I don't know
if she's in the waiting room.
Thank you Senator or that
presentation
I don't see anybody in
attendance on this legislation.
The.
We will go to the committee for
questions and discussion.
The members questions
discussion.
Yes Representative black.
Thank you Mr chairman and
Senator my curiosity is why do
you now there's a portion of
that fund go to CYFD.
Thank you Mr chair
representative for the question
that was sent in statute I'm not
sure what year that some of the
money does go to the children's
trust fund.
Thank you for that
Center and Mr Chairman what do
you have any idea what the
children's trust fund uses that
money for I guess would be my
question yes thank you Mr chair
representative that children's
trust fund is for
social services and counseling
for abused children.
Thank you Senator I'm and Mr
chairman and senator I guess
might be my first question would
be why would we want to or why
the county clerk's want to
double the fee in assets I'm.
Instead of are you know perhaps
state going up by instead of
twenty five dollars going to
thirty five dollars.
Mr chair representative I'm not.
Sure why they wanted to double
the fee except that has it has
been a great number of years
since that has happened.
I do know that elected officials
budgets are set by the county
commissions and sometimes the
county commissions keep their
the county clerk's office
budget.
Flat so there is no room to grow
I do know some of the counties
have not switched over to
computers.
And software that could record
all of these marriage licenses
some of the larger counties of
course have.
But there are increasing cost of
and some of the counties just
need to upgrade their services
so.
Why it went from twenty five to
fifty I'm not sure.
Okay thank you for that Senator
hi Mr chairman that's all the
questions I had.
Thank you Representative the
reserve further questions.
Discussion members.
The committee I I have a.
This with the with the committee
it's from our our our Democrat
analysis but
It says a.
This.
according to DFA all rights as a
higher fee could affect the
number of individuals seeking
legal marriage documents however
forced magazine columnist so now
banning proposes that the price
of true love quote unquote is
somewhat in elastic meaning cost
as little impact on the.
So funny I thought I had this I
I just got a new I need to share
with the committee well Mister
chair I can share another
chuckle we had a floor amendment
that was defeated but it was to
do away with marriage in the
state of New Mexico.
Thank you current Representative
back up members for the question
discussion here Mister chair yes
Representative Lujan thank you I
just want to think that
Senator Sanchez bringing this
forward I do.
Number works.
In the state and you know I I am
I asked him about this bill and
Mr chair Senator it's for their
administration costs right that
they're not getting there's not
much on the budget line for them
right there is that correct that
is correct.
Thank you Mr chair
representative for the question
yes that's that's that's
important we know that are
counties need some some need
revenues there and and all the
work specially that's done in
our county clerk's offices I
don't think a lot of people know
that you know the extent of what
what goes on in those offices
and you know especially with our
elections
but they do so many other things
so I I strong I support this
piece of legislation and I think
the sponsor for bringing it
forward thank you Mr chair thank
you Senator Stefanics it's good
to see you this morning thank
you thank you.
Thank you Representative Lujan
