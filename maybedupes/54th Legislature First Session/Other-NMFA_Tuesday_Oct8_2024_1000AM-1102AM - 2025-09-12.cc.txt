Remember Lucero.
Des responded with a yes. OK,
thank you. Remember John.
Billingsley.
Member Martinez.
I
Remember Thompson?
Member Van Dyke.
And remember Maitland.
We are unable to hear the um
But Julie Maitland.
say that she was present.
OK, thank you.
We have a quorum
Thank you very much. Thank you
all for joining us today. I know
these presentations are quick
and many of you have traveled
very far, and we are grateful.
Um, it's always helpful to put a
face with the project. So with
that, Angela, take us away.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So we
are bringing before you the
second half of the project
presentations for the 2025
application cycle, uh, this is
uh a little bit of a refresher
to the presenters, when you um
are called, please make sure uh
when you were called up, make
sure that you introduce
yourself, you're given 3 minutes
to present your project, you
will be timed after the 3
minutes, the board can choose to
um
Ask any questions uh you feel
and uh with that.
Madam Chair, uh, we will start
with the city of Texaco.
Good morning. My name is Deborah
Auter. I'm the mayor.
Mexico is a small rural
community with a population of
just over 900.
It's located in the central east
edge of the state.
Adjacent to the New Mexico-Texas
state border.
At this time we're at we are
without qualified personnel to
operate our water system.
Therefore, we have entered into
an emergency interim agreement
with Epcor, to operate our
system.
An engineering firm assessed the
system and identified the
following deficiencies.
Supply
Safety storage and metering.
Water supply is an immediate
need for Texaco. There are 5
functioning potable water wells
with a combined production
capacity of 93 GPM daily.
Ranging from 16 to 22 GPM.
Originally, the ranges were 500
to 5550 GPM daily.
Currently, that is less than 5%
of the original capacity.
This slim coverage capacity is
alarming, as indicated on the
table provided.
We have been in stage 3 water
conservation for for several
years, and we are currently in
stage 4 since May.
Critical areas of safety are
gaseous chlorine feed facilities
and electrical issues.
For chlorination facilities are
not equipped with automatic
valves to shut them down to a
leak be detected.
Nor are they equipped with d
cylinder arrangements with
automatic switchover valves,
which would prevent the
production of well water that is
not properly disinfected due to
an empty chlorine cylinder.
There are significant electrical
safety concerns that 3 of the 5
whale sites.
At one side, the electrical gear
is in the tight area and proper
clearance in front of the panels
does not exist.
At other sides, there is
electrical equipment and the
chlorination feed equipment
rooms, which could result in
corroded and unsafe electrical
gear.
These issues present health and
safety concerns to utility
workers and the public.
Courage Texaco has two potable
storage tanks. The KKR tank and
the tower well, which were
inspected in 2014.
KAR tank had concentrated cell
corrosion, the tower tank had
failure.
In interior coatings.
Improvements to both storage
tanks are required to maintain
the integrity of the assets.
Metering
5 m need to be replaced to
accurately measure flow because
the size of the current meters
were based on original
production capacity.
Currently, the 385 m services in
Texaco are suspected to be on
average greater than 20 years
old.
Typical replacement.
10 to 12 years, documents show
that age meters result in lost
water revenue and do not reflect
leaks.
Protesting is provided are for
immediate critical system needs
time.
Thank you. Do you have any
questions for the mayor?
Van Dyke.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Mayor, for your
Presentation.
Um, reading through this, I see
that you
Look at that alternatives to or
solutions to your dilemma.
And um you had listed.
drilling price for wells are
Those 5 wells not already set in
on Redbed.
Yes, sir, we believe that they
are, um.
I think in in
That the re-drilling was going
in and bailing out, you know, we
were hoping we might could
re-drill but in bailing out a
few of those, we have had the
funds to do that. We have
reached Red Bed.
So there's no hope to drill any
deeper. Yeah, and I'm right, and
are you part of the Eastern New
Mexico.
Yes, sir, we are part of the
Eastern New Mexico Water Utility
Authority. Yes, sir.
And so do you anticipate a tie
in?
Yes, sir, actually, they are um
have done surveying. They've um
We're gonna go out for bids if
they haven't already.
Um, for our taxi collateral line
is what we call it. It's gonna
hook to the core line that ran
to the airport.
It's gonna come down, um.
We call, we call it 21st Street.
I'm not sure what state highway
it is because I don't know, then
down 108 and hook into our
system and that's they, they
tell us that it should be built
within the next year.
But unfortunately, that doesn't
get us surface water from you at
this point. Thank you very much.
Yes.
Any other questions?
This is
Madam Chair, um,
So
It's really interesting to to
see here.
Um, the agreement that you have
a P, could you explain a little
more in detail what is providing
for you and for us, yes, yes,
they are our operator on record
of our water treatment system.
When we first went into the
agreement with them, it actually
happened last September. We've
been in agreement with him for a
year. They were our operator on
record of our wastewater
treatment plant also since that
time, we have hired personnel
that are certified operators for
the wastewater treatment plant.
Unfortunately, we can't get
Operators that are certified to
operate the water system. So
they, they do it all for us.
They um do shut offs and and um
repairs to the water lines they
check our wells. They've done
repairs on the wells. They're
always checking our chlorination
system. They do everything for
us that
An employee would do.
just out of curiosity, I think
of course on the in the
audience, so could you explain
to me like what you're seeing
from your perspective and these
kinds of services that are being
needed by community.
I'm just trying to get a sense
of um.
not the technical, but I, I
think my point is, is that, that
what we're seeing, right, what
we're seeing from um
water um perspective from not
only local governments but from
mutual domestics and even the
ses, right, and the delivery of
water which is water and waste
water, is that those are the
challenges that we're seeing
more and more is the lack of
accounting firms, the lack of
water operators, the lack of
wastewater operators and that as
the water ambassador was the
challenges that we're seeing and
how do we alleviate those needs
because these communities are
suffering.
Uh, and so we're all trying to
figure out how we do that
better.
And so it's such a challenge, so
I just wanna just wanted to see
what additional opportunities we
could open up for these
communities because we're trying
to do our very best and so we're
trying to figure out solutions
to help alleviate that and
create more job opportunities
for these individuals, so.
I think, I think that is
something we need to look at for
our future.
And so you could we have you
state your name for the record.
Any other questions?
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Man, um, the next
Presentation listed as uh
reginamtri domestic,
unfortunately, the president, um
wasn't able to attend, so we're
gonna skip vagina and go to
Cedar Creek Mutual domestic
Water Consumers Association.
Boarding members of the, uh,
we're actually working with
Regina Mutual domestic as well
if you want, I can go back to
Regina. That's all right. That'd
be great. Thank you.
So, um, the Regina project is in
is the next phase in a
multi-phase project to
eventually replace their entire
system.
Um, they've identified, uh,
So their their system is both
underside pressure issues, and
they are also not able to
provide fire protection.
And so the water trust board has
funded a couple of different um
earlier phases in design and
construction on the first phase
finished construction last year.
We're in the middle of
completing the design of the 2nd
phase currently.
And um they are also securing
funding from um
Um, or
securing federal funds through
the Army Corps of Engineers, and
so they're pulling out all the
stops to try to get their
project their entire system
replaced and this is the next
phase of answering questions
that you have.
Any questions, members on me.
The next one we have is for uh
Cedar Creek feature domestic
Water Consumers Association.
Yes, so, uh, Cedar Creek was
unable to make it as you know,
they're in the middle of, of
trying to recusal fires, um,
this, this poor community went
from 250 connections before the
fire, they now have 25 homes
standing.
They had started to work on
their um water system
improvements before the fire and
the fire exacerbated it. They uh
they need replacement of uh
wealth.
Uh, tanks, well heads, and they,
they have um
They're experiencing significant
losses through there, um.
They're, they're experiencing
significant losses through their
distribution system. And so this
project would include design of
all of those improvements.
And so with that I'll stand for
anything.
I
I, I live in Albuquerque and so
I got a beautiful view of the
balloons on the way in this
morning.
Yes, so, so, um,
They are in the process of
trying to secure some funding
from FEMA to help them recover
from that fire.
Um,
Yeah
There's no, there's no good
disaster recovery, but the, the
fire down there was caused by
natural causes, and so unlike
the hermit peak fire where where
the
Federal government has taken
responsibility for those damages
and, and, and as a result of
that, the
Settlements are are going to get
those communities closer to
being whole.
The fire down south was caused
by natural additional help from.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
The next presentation is for Sky
Country Estates Major domestic.
Yes, um, and I, I'm sorry, I
forgot to introduce myself. I'm
Jody Garcia was Stiller and
Associates and, and as I said
yesterday, you know, we're,
we're, we work.
Primarily with small communities
that um
are, are operated by long-time
jobs, so, um.
Sky Country Estates has also
asked me to um
Present on their behalf.
Um, their request is for
$275,000 for.
Design of a new well and to
address some issues with um
that were identified by enemyD
for their sanitary survey, um,
they are, they currently have
one well that struggles to keep
up with demand, purchasing water
to.
To fill the tank to keep the
residents with with enough water
to to for the bare necessities.
Um, so this project would design
a new well and address the
survey which were um site
security and then um do
chlorination system to help me
uh with that, I'm stand for any
questions from members.
Sounds like you'll be living in
your car with all these
products. No, like I said, we've
got we've got the biggest uh
water engineering staff in in
New Mexico and so we've got a
lot of dedicated
Talented engineers, most of whom
are from New Mexico.
Um,
I just get to be the face of all
that hard work.
Next presentation is
From
We're located in Peralta to
maintained and managed but need
simple, safe and efficient water
system into the future.
With only 48 services, there is
a
The 100,000 gallon.
Water storage tank replacement
is the highest priority, but
additional capital project needs
related to wells, meters.
And distributions, improvements
are also identified.
The Association recently
completed our preliminary
engineering report prioritized.
Uh, needed capital improvements,
projects along project
approaches and implementation.
Our association is requesting
the needed improvements and
address system deficiencies and
systems.
Um, Denzel Washington.
Well,
is uh
Perfect. Thank you. Do you have
any questions on the Bass Garden
Project.
None. Thank you. Thank you very
much.
The next presentation we have is
from the Administ Water
Consumers Association.
Thank you.
Jodi Garcia Miller and
Associates, um, the project
before you is design of a water
the no go out mutual domestic
water Consumers Association had
a a water plant.
Yeah
was halfway built about 10 years
ago. Other than that, they only
have a uh a single well is to is
to
Provide a redundant waters and
so that.
Yeah.
Any questions from the members
on the number.
And I
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I
appreciate, um,
and, and you mentioned that
there um
Stem water treatment plan was
not completed.
that's something we funded.
the water trust board or was
that
Membership
I will have to get back to you
on that. It was, it was more
than 10 years ago when they
started that, um, I know that
they reached out to us recently
previously so I don't really
remember, but I, I, I won't let
the staff know what the answer
to that question is.
Thank you.
Questions.
See
You.
Next presentation, the next two
actually are from the village of
Columbus.
M
Sure. Thank you.
Miss Phillips Dinner. I'm the
mayor of the village of
Columbus.
And uh uh
Uh, Columbus is on the uh
border with Mexico and
Columbus is proud to be the only
24 hour port of entry with uh.
Um
M.
Um, we're here this morning or
Uh, my consultants are, are here
with me from Stantec, and they
would
And for any technical questions,
um, I'm here to make the request
to
continue with basing our uh
Flight control project me at
$100,000.
And also a um
Preliminary engineering report.
Uh, for water
Uh, in the for 100.
$50,000.
I'll stand for any questions.
Thank you, Mayor scanner, that
was quite a drive. Glad you're
here today.
Any questions for this project
from Village of Columbus.
Oh, it's like we have a question
from Stephen Deal online. I'm
sorry, weren't able to hear you.
Would it be possible one? I
apologize, Steve, would it be
possible to
Um
Type it into the
Shaded
Uh
Anticipating maybe
One of his questions, we are
asking for construction funds,
uh, the village will
The
Design money.
OK, uh, Steve said, the, uh, the
question was for no
Go not for.
Um,
Well this
Angela, if you can facilitate
that question offline.
I certainly will
That would be great.
OK, moving on, let's go to the
2nd project from Village of
Columbus.
Uh
It
The request of the
Yard
engine
Terrific. So one's construction
and one's PER. Yes. Any other
questions from the members?
and thank you for coming today.
Thank you.
The next presenter is for the.
Town of Istancia.
Good morning. My name is Roy
Hubbard. I'm the deputy clerk
for the T stands here with me
today is our clerk and treasurer
with the town of Estancia, um.
We're here today to explain to
you.
What's going on. So the Thomas
Day, we were on track to build a
new uh a new well back in 2017.
Um,
Due to increased demand, um, at
that time, our local uh prison
which housed federal inmates and
a majority of our GRTs um closed
down, so we were unable to
actually uh move forward with
that project.
So, and that project is is
fairly complete, um,
Uh, I'm sorry, the plans are
completed, totally, so we were,
we're trying to move forward and
request for funding um because
this summer we actually had to
almost declare an emergency
situation.
Um, because we only had a day's
worth of water supply. Um, and
we've actually dropped our well.
6 more feet.
I believe, um,
So
We
Um,
The the facility has recently
reopened uh by the Federal
Immigration and Customs
Enforcement along with the
reduced bulk production and a
mandate from the Mexico Drinking
Water Board.
He commissioned a 100 year old
Ving elevated water storage
tank.
Um, all in conjunction with
other miscellaneous water
distribution system issues. The
town is pursuing funding avenues
to support these water system
improvement needs, and we are
currently requesting $4.5
million for
For this project.
Perfect. Any questions from the
member?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I
have a couple of questions. Um,
the first question is, um,
your wells in or salt levels
increasing on those wells, and
are you having that?
They're not, they're not. So our
water table is dropping.
Um, so,
We, one of our wells that
operates the main town, um, it's
about 1200 residents that we
supply, plus a prison that
houses about 1000.
Um, well 8.
It went dry.
In June.
And we had to drop it the 36 ft
down.
Um,
So we're we're trying to.
drill another well, um, for the.
And then my second question is,
um, Macintosh, I think has a
mutual domestic, you don't.
I am with them we do not, no, we
fall under the on seawater
basin.
Um, which is
Central southern torrent camp.
You.
Any other questions for members?
Remember Lucero?
OK
how many residents or
connections you have?
And
So we have about 5510
connections. Um,
With all the residents
currently.
So let me just hit up a major
water um theater project
improvement.
And have you done any testing to
ensure that it's the wells going
dry or
Any other questions?
I appreciate it. Thank you.
In the next two presenters or
presentations are from Sunland
Park, City of Salmon.
Madam Chair, members of the
board, thank you for the
opportunity to speak today. I'm
gonna be a family for the city
of Sun Park, New Mexico.
Uh, we have two projects for you
today, uh, one of which, uh,
will help us remediate the flows
that originate from Mexico and
make their direct imports real
on which is on the US side and
in our municipality in another
one, that helps remediate um uh.
Uh, eroded that threatens
infrastructure in a separate
neighborhood.
I present the details of the
projects I do have our city
manager in my wife.
Good morning.
The first project on the screen
edge on subdivision. This is a
large but controlled pond
situated on the north end of
town.
From the photos you can see that
post right there is actually a
power transmission.
Like.
Our holder.
You can see the foundation is
being compromised with the
erosion that's occurring in the
area.
Fancy that's falling down.
Uh, this, we're beginning to see
quite a bit of, of stream
development.
What we're looking to do here is
Asking for funding to
design this facility.
We are so that you you're aware
we are working on some
development impact pain.
These ability studying now, so
we'll be passing much of the
construction costs.
future development of stream,
but uh but it is important.
For the city didn't begin to
develop.
Drainage for the city of Suland
Park is the number one priority.
You're familiar with with the uh
the city.
gra ph y we have sort of the
mace of
Department
On the west end, so when it
rains we get quite a bit of
runoff that's coming.
deal with the
Erosion caused by the water, but
we don't be happy to answer any
questions.
Do you have any questions from
the members specifically on. OK.
I'd like to continue with the
next one.
The next project
was actually funded a couple
years ago through the water
transport for.
to design that project is shovel
ready now so uh we're asking for
3.5 million for construction.
This is the watershed of the
national watershed. It's about
900 acres. It uh,
23 of the watershed actually
emanates on the Mexican side.
The issues that we're seeing is
when it rains.
The sewer systems run off.
That water makes its way into uh
the north of the international
boundary. It has caused
historical flooding back in
2021, the governor issued a
disaster declaration.
For this area.
Does impact the residents
transportation corridors.
The funding would construct a
large continuation pond
conveyance system.
That will
And uh again we're improving the
Water that's being introduced.
Happy to answer any questions.
Do you have any questions on
No, thank you very much. I
appreciate it.
Madam Chair, the next 3
presentations are from the city
of Espanola.
Madam chair, members of the
committee. My name is Elijah
Mouss. I'm the public works
director for the city of
Espanola.
Um, have to be
3 projects here requesting
funding.
The first one is the city that
you look at the riverside
project.
$415.6 million.
That's offset the rest of the
project are that the Army Corps
engineers have pledged $22
million for this.
1 miles
So
And you just keep hyped it for
replacement.
Uh, this is
Essential to the city of
Espanol. This is one of.
corridors that supplies water
and wastewater.
Throughout the uh everything
from the eastern northern part
for distribution and for.
Some of the issues are just uh
fire protection, some of it
there we have uh one of the
biggest buildings we have there
is the Santa Clari Hotel.
Because you know, just looking
for just basically update all
the stuff here because we have.
In aqua fire protection at that
point. That's one of the largest
buildings in the city there ever
do have it,
God forbid, but this is not only
replacing the lines just to.
Update stuff, but it's also just
Be proactive on this
And the other part of this too
is by getting this phone in here
and with the Army Corps of
engineers.
This whole corridor slated from
the state to be being engineered
right now for replacement. I
know they've done some upgrading
just to for aesthetic right now.
they do a complete redo of this.
So this project would be um
detrimental for us to get it
done just to
Be able to get ahead of that so
when they come through and they
do that they're, you wouldn't
want to have a project trying to
come back behind it.
And in turn this whole new
system so.
Just trying to be proactive,
trying to do everything we can
just.
You know, just doing the best we
can and.
Perfect. Thank you. Any
questions on the Riverside
project for members.
And
I don't care, thank you. Um, how
old does the existing system
that you're wanting to replace
you might arranges everything
from the 50s, it's all AClane,
so.
It's well over it's one of the
original systems in town.
In its leakage problem. Have you
been able to identify that?
Some leakage, but also uh water
breaks anytime there's any kind
of major usage or anything like.
Thank you
Any other questions?
Second one there is is the well
projects uh to be constructed on
the uh Carter Ranch.
What this would do here is, is
And to addition just relates to
aging system there.
And some of the water quality in
the town on the southern to be,
so Disneyhillaby is to meet our,
our, you know, thresholds and
everything to ensure quality
water forola.
And we also, uh,
Uh, it's just about 14 ft acres
to one of the neighboring
community, try to make it a
regionalization, try to help
out. Any questions from members?
And the last one here is, is the
Um, this one really is, is to
You know we are a rural
community and some of our tanks
do sit in the like sight in
their guns, I guess sometimes or
do pop some more that it's so
it's it's, you know, they've
been welded up there and they
just to go back. They didn't
correctly.
here.
And it would also there's a few
other parts of it too just of
them are, are old and worn out,
you know, once again trying to
be proactive on everything we
have.
Perfect. Any questions from
members?
Is it, thank you very much.
Thank you.
You're back.
this time. Good morning, madam
Chair, to the committee. Thank
you for having a go.
Um, my ancestors and
To keep that beautiful.
Replacement quickly.
I don't have much to add other
than um the community did secure
funds for design almost complete
we uh the road has been on the
BLM significantly impacted our
design, um, schedule.
But we've overcome those hurdles
and are ready to bid as soon as
they can secure. Any questions
from members on this project.
And
OK.
Um, thank you very much, Madam
Chair. So if the wells on BLM is
the, I mean if the tanks on
bailing him at the well also be
him.
No, the well is on private
property that's owned by the
association. Oh yeah, they've
got a line from the well, which
is closer. Any additional
questions?
Very much. Appreciate it.
Madam Chair, members of the
board, uh, my name is Rick
Mitchell. I'm the general
manager for Flori Vista Mutual
domestic Water.
Um, the first, uh, one is the
road.
3125 line.
Um, which is probably one of the
smaller ones we're trying to get
lines in our areas that
They don't currently have access
to uh.
A good water source.
Um, 3125 project is not that far
from our main lines, but the the
wells in the last two years that
they had. It's kind of a low
income area and and the uh wells
ourselves we monitor day we have
level sensors on the lower.
We also have connections with
this hashtag.
As well as a connection that
hasn't been finished yet.
So we're just trying to get
these people a water line up
there where they had.
And just to add slightly to
that, all three projects are
essential.
Hauling water and part of the
project also includes other
neighboring area, other folks
that can't get these extensions
as um as quickly access to a
close.
Perfect. Thank you. Any
questions from members on this.
So
We once it, once the lines are
installed, how are we
connecting?
The residents to the mainland.
Is that being done?
Um, by the residents themselves,
or do you have an affordable
housing plan that's allowing for
funding to be.
OK.
Or do you have the available
funds to do that or is that?
OK.
So you have a commitment from
the residences already?
have attended mini board
requestwater especially.
It's mostly attended many
meetings in the past.
The affordability and the
financial capacity to disconnect
just because of the high costs.
Just a thought maybe is to look
at.
Developing affordable housing
planning.
And to be able to do
That to system because.
Like approximately how many
residents are currently hauling
water on that particular line of
road.
For uh no other questions. Thank
you.
Moving on, so it's how many
homes for each?
Project. The third one is a
haven't been really developed it
much.
Any questions from members on
any of the three projects.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Angela
I.
Thank you for this.
I'm representing the city on a
on a consulting. So we're asking
for design money for
improvements to the way they
have, they are um having
They're also experiencing issues
with uh aged infrastructure and
it it is time to optimize the
wastewater treatment plant with
today's
Um, capabilities and dollars.
Or design
And with the city match of
360,000.
You can see just listed up there
the various improvements that
are needed.
Really the need for the project
here is we need to meet the
groundwater discharge, have to
meet that, and they're currently
having trouble meeting the
permit, so we need to get them
compliant. We also need to deal
with the
Ad infrastructure and the real
lack of redundancy and and and
also deal with the, the drought
and just being in the southwest
is
And optimizing the waste. All
right, do we have any questions
on the design?
