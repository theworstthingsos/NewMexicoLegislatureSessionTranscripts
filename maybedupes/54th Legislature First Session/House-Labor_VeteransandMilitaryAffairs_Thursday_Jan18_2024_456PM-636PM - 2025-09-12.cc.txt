The committee
I mistake representativ.
My expert witness today is
secretary surrey turn li.
I'm going to give a few comments
on why this building i'll
briefly explain the bill of me
to keep it very short the
secretary at a couple of points
and what questions so I think
everybody realizes here that
more than ever.
It's it's in a long day mr chair
I had introduced
so in new mexico I think
everybody realizes that more
than ever before the value of a
printerships is video to
developing our workforce we need
that skilled work force it
increases accessitive quality
well paying shops it helps
employers close a skills gap and
it allows them to have a greater
ability to recruit workers who
have practical experience be.
We know that research shows that
apprenticeship programs benefit
employers employees and the
economy I was surprised to learn
that over ninety percent of
workers who complete
printerships earn an average of
seventy thousand dollars at
that's a level three teacher.
A couple of other points
at not having enough workers
effects pricing scheduling and
completion of projects many of
you aware of the capital out
there projects that haven't been
completed because we don't have
those things
in new mexico only for a percent
of the total construction work
force goes through a registered
printership program
many of the federal grants
require such as the
infrastructure investment act
and others require utilization
of a registered apprenticeships
I want to just say a couple of
other things formal
apprenticeships usually started
the age eighteen some allow
sixteen year olds they are two
to five years depending on the
craft.
Creating this work force
developme.
Ability to offer these um
opportunities so I want to
quickly.
This is
related to our force development
that's the secretary here it
creates the work force
development and a printership
trust fun it makes annual
transfers from that trust fun to
the public works a printership.
But and annual appropriations to
the work for solutions
department for the purposes of
the apprenticeship assistance at
i'm it has some requirements for
people to require to get those
funds and finally at clarifies
that the work for solutions
department administers the pop
fan and they.
Finally it has an appropriation
of fifty million dollars in the
bill there some clean up
language as the names of federal
department of labor programs
change that's been updated in
the bill and then it also
changes the work for solutions
department as the
allocator of the funds rather
than just a specific division
with that i'm going to ask my
expert witness secretary surread
a narrow to.
The.
The.
Thank you mister chair I thought
it might be helpful to give a
brief overview of apprenticeship
funding and how it works in our
department so that you have a
little more context.
So currently we have.
Public works apprenticeship and
training fund the apprenticeship
assistance act w.
From the workers compensation
find and we currently have a
federal grant of three hundred
and.
So each year we determine how
much of the public works.
In the current fiscal your
budget that number is two
million eight eighty nine
thousand one hundred dollars and
then
we
take all that for part of money
to both staff or are a pretty
ship program which overseas and
certifies all of the registered
apprenticeships in the state as
well as auditing those program.
And then also making these
distributions of money so in the
current year that we have two
distribution street.
We have that that apprenticeship
assistance act we
which is distributing six
hundred thousand dollars for
rel.
Yeah.
And then the public work.
In fiscal year twenty.
Cost of it apprenticeship
program.
The.
What we have seen though is over
time.
Of the increase in the number of
program.
And so just generally the demand
so that funding which is for
related technical instructions
in fiscal you're twenty two that
was it.
Then it went down in twenty
three to two dollars and for.
The.
In the public work supportership
in training fund we did see
increases mostly because we made
an afr.
So that is currently in the
corre.
Seventeen hundred dollars per
appreciate so what this bill
would do is to increase those
two revenue streams that gets
distri.
As I understand it in.
So that would be.
And then it would add one.
Little short a double that
seventy five percent and then in
subsequent years it would
distribute seve.
And this funding would go to a
anticipated increases in a
partnership and moment so
hopefully.
And we're also seeing a lot of
expansion of a printership.
Vehicle charging health care
teachers and so as that as those
programs that are eligible for
the funny.
And then hopefully.
So i'm happy to answer any
questions thank you.
We're learning to turn it off
while we move it
and I will just add that the
state investment officer would
be responsible for investing the
money in this fund and it would
reside in the street territory
and with that we stand for qu.
I don't really.
Yeah.
The.
The.
Well I I would first learn about
this bill yesterday.
I am
one thing I I don't like you
give us your name i'm sorry my
name is dickenson.
Yeah.
Construction.
For multiple different
always on the nine union side.
Degree I have agreed civil
engineering videos structuring
management.
One the first thing I saw when I
read through this is creating
another trust fund
trust one scarmy
they have the potential.
To be mismanaged we have added
times in the past weekend.
There have been an appropriate
activities with them that scares
me for the first first thing out
of the back um
the second thing out of the bag
is.
Frequently work
with the
apprentice that we bring up in
our own come in the companies
that we work with.
We are printership programs that
are not funded.
They are terrible that are very
and they they bring people up
and they don't just bring them
up through the trades
but we get all week we bring
them up and recommend the office
we have media people that have
come up through our brenda ship
programs and now or work in
helping us with our advertised.
The.
This is does not.
Help
what we do as a
I guess currently have employed
with tlc and and i'm not here
representing t l c i'm here up
your own.
I'm i'm not doing a very good
job of this I I recognize that
I I didn't expect to speak when.
The.
Anyway I I
think this program does not help
what we do
at a tlc we we bring people in
we've got an are in house
friendship if we bring people up
we have we put multiple people
into the journeyment trades and
get unlicensed
i'm gonna throw out a number you
don't hold into it but we
probably get
twenty five people in freight.
Yeah.
The stewart in them I am wanting
construction manager award for
aps for sixteen years and worked
at intel site for many years
before that for it familiar with
the
different
apprenticeship programs
I my first concern is that this
would be only distributed to
union specific training programs
and that the there are multiple
organizations at as bureau was
talking about that are are doing
a printership programs and it
would I would hope that it would
be equally distributed on
amongst the
union and non union training
I can say in from what bird
spoke about I am also a public
education commissioner one of my
schools is the school to dreams
academy who is t l c is working
with them as a
a printership training program
for them and and is doing that
basically
I I want to comment their
company
and I would love to.
Solicit the
support of this committee for
those those functions of adult
entities that are doing this
right now without any participa.
Yeah.
Need mister chairman members of
the committee marlow shows
registered lobbyists for c n m
community college cnm's supports
apprenticeship programs and
other work based learning
programs that lead to high
paying jobs and careers cnn has
a registered apprenticeship
program new mexico information
technology apprentice ship
program and we are pursuing
additional registered
printership programs there could
be funded under this bill we
support the house will five in
any other legislation this
session that provides funding
for work force development and
up skilling things.
Yeah.
Thank you misses chairman based
here and the steamers of the
committee my name is amazers I
am a fourth year of prince
possibly the oldest supremace
and the jatc and i'm here to
speak today and support the bill
because there's two two facts
that we know the pretty ships
are important if you want
quality labor of partnerships
are important the second fact we
know is that apprenticeships
need to be funded whether
they're non union
apprenticeships the union
apprenticeships they need to be
funded in their need to be
standards
and that needs to be regulated
or monitor and that's why this
bill is important we wouldn't
call an electrician that I had
hang out with me for four years
or three years and he got his
license and he doesn't know what
he's doing there has to be
standards and they'll standards
need to be taught and their
needs to be some organization in
that teaching
I get there's a difference and
some people's opinion between
nine union and union but the way
I understand this bill as I read
it as this is for
apprenticeships period and
registered
and
you know we all said the same
words I have an apprentice we
have an apprenticeship that's
what we're here for today there
shouldn't be a separation
between whether it's a non union
or a union apprenticeship
apprentices are important
they're the pipeline to our
workforce and apprenticeships
need to be funded so I stand in
a support of this bill and I ask
that you pass.

measure up as long as well as
many others involving a printer
programs you know we always talk
about diversifying our
investments in the state and
diversifying you know how we
build up our revenue and what
better investment is there than
the workers of our state this is
investing in our people in a way
that will generate revenue
generate good pain jobs we
cannot imagine a better use of
money and lifting up
people who want to help build

Good evening chairman i'll con
members of the committee can you
hear me hello
again it appears we're having
the same problem where the
transcription is coming through
but we cannot hear you in the
room apologies.
Oh.
Would it help if you put your
computer speaker on so there
chairman
of garage secretary nighter.
I agree i'm a big proponent of
real technical educat.
Programs are great
I am a little conf.
The.
I'm not I I don't understand the
need to create a fifty million
dollars.
If there are already companies
that are doing the.
Why do we need to create a fifty
million dollars fun.
Thank you for the question.
There are at the present time
fifty registered apprenticeship
programs throughout the state
they include wednesday with
cities unions nine unions and
this lays a foundational funding
stream for fifty end as the
secretary is indicated for
infrasing numbers.
At mister chair representative
of martinez that that's correct
I think there has been concerned
that it over time the revenues
coming in to the the public
works apprenticeship and trading
fund fluctuate and so I I
believe part of the desire of
the sponsor was to have some
evening out of that revenue
stream so that is some of the
partnership programs mentioned
they're able to plan for the
future and know what their
distribution will be in a more.
So much chair.
I'm still in confused if there
is private companies that are
running their own friendship
programs why do we need a fifty
million dollars fund
to be created
to all receiv.
Mr chair and representative
private companies some do
register with the state some
don't get their choice how they
want to do it
so any private company
organization that wants to run
their own program and pay for it
out of their own funding street.
I'm still not clear on that but
all.
So on page six of the bill.
Um line sixteen and seventeen.
So there's gonna be fifteen
percent of the funds may be used
by the department the higher
staff to administer the funds
collected by the department.
Tell me secretary of missure
what a current vacancy rate of.
Mr chair representative martinez
so
the fifteen percent rule is
already part of the existing
legislation around the pot the
current overall vacancy rate for
the department of work for
solutions is right about it
twenty percent and in the
current fiscal year we are not
actually using that fifteen
percent that we're entitled to
we're leaving it in the fund
okay so you mister chair you
madame korea but twenty percent
vacancy rate.
And you're gonna have to hire
more people to
oversee this program.
Mr cherry representative martin
is that that was in the
department as a whole I thought
was your request currently we
are
out to post on two positions and
all the remaining positions or
full within the apprenticeship
division and we don't don't know
that we would need additional
staffing but if we did it would
likely be just to make sure that
we're making timely audit so the
programs cause.
You mister chair sold so in the
program that exists now.
Mr chair representative martinez
we have two positions that are
posted so they're vacant but the
postage
and chair madame secretary how
many positions total in the
apprenticeship program at mr
chair and representative
martinez there are six that are
funded through these mechanisms
and then we have an additional
four that sit in outlying
offices that are funded through
federal funding
so mister chair ten positions.
Mister chair representative
artinez yes.
Last question.
Who says the criteria for the
training
if
if I understand correctly
private companies can set up
their own.
Do you have to all receive those
apprenticeship programs the use
of the.
What is all that work
mister chair and representative
martinez so any company that we
are any program that wishes to
be according what registered
apprentice
has to either come through our
our department in the state of
printership council or there's a
federal registration process as
well the there are guidelines
that are set out by the federal
um US department of labor and
then the state apprenticeship.
Um here in the state
they haven't changed much over
the years they.
And
we do you offer sort of
technical sys.
So there is a federal program
and now we're trunded duplicate
the same program.
I'm not gra.
Mister chairman representative
martinez this legislation
doesn't set up any new program
it just puts additional funding
into existing program so there
there is always been a federal
apprenticeship program there has
always you know for many many
years been a state
apprenticeship program this
isn't really changing anything
about that except more
accurately describing the damage
our department but what it is
doing is putting more money into
those revenue streams
mister chair I apologize that.
Um but I promise this will be
the last one because i'll
probably still be confused.
So the fifty million dollars is
going to be a legacy so you
don't have.
So you're taking away
appropriation authority from the
legislature to now
on this state run program.
Mister chairman representative
representative so
mister chair and representative
martinez were creating a fund
the legislature with this bill
would approve a non record fifty
million
amount for this permanent fund
which would be invested that's
why when you read the details
we're not gonna send out
fifteen.
Uh there's guidelines and place
if
revenue goes down.
It's like other funds the state
permanent land fun these have
are comi.
Mister chair representative
martinez every year this
specific amount that we draw
down from the public work
supportership and is part of our
budget so it does go through the
legislative approval process
thank you for your p.
Mr chair and representative
great question as a member of
house appropriations the budget
still is implex there is already
identified fifty five million
dollars that hasn't been
appropriated.
It's it's a work is these two
weeks are vital to bigger enough
where the many is there's a new
proposal in the house to make a
government accountability
expendable fun trust fund so
things are under way
women of this passes are that
will be in negotiation going on
with senate finance and house
appropriations.
A different purpose.
Mister chair and representative
that eighty million which would
be over four years focuses on
the courses like the deep divert
technology courses of courses
where students don't earn
credits the opportunity
scholarship doesn't cover those
so that's a separate fun that
would be available for a variety
of purposes.
Mr chair representative that
eighty million is completely
different than this fifty
million.
Don't have.
Mr representative that that's of
course the negotiations rest on
a passing the house but it's a
standard thing that certain
funds do get negotiated during
the course of the thirty days.
Was.
Mister chair in.
So the total in the foy twenty
four budget and are total budget
was two million eighty nine
thousand one hundred from the
public work supportership and
training find an one million
dollars.
And then we have.
That is going to outread.
And I would mister chair
representative that the pew what
many comes from the registered
the fifty registered programs
that they pay into it and it
comes.
All the way.
Mr representative great question
you do need enough money to be
invested to get the revenue
stream flowing if I mean if it
was two million it wouldn't
generate the revenue so this is
a foundational investment just
like the early child who trust
fund all these other funds you
get initial investment and then
the revenue stream is.
Represent.
Thank you mister chair
and thank you representative and
madame secretary
have read through this bill
quite a bit and.
I live in a rural place and I
know that work force solutions I
I use.
However.
Some of my questions I guess
this is the transparency part of
it.
And
sometimes I feel like.
And I just want to make sure
that people can
you know have access and they
were able to look at things and
and see where this money's
coming from and fifty million
you know I i'm running I I
really
would like to see a lot of that
money go to cyfd cause I must
see why FDA love children
and I know that this is needed
but
one of the questions I had was
how would this how will the bill
insure transparency in the
investment decisions made for
the fund.
And why you're while you're
looking at that
and can it include provisions
for regular updates on
investment performances for
people look at online
especially people that know
about investments.
Always great question
if you look on page two
uh the fund let's see this is
section one b the state
investment officers subject to
the approval of the state
investment council so there's
one area of accountability shall
invest the money the workforce
development first of trust fun
in accordance with the prudent
investor rule set forth and the
enough for prudent investor act
in consultation with the state
treasure they'll report corderly
to the legislative finance
committee which of course meets
during the interim and the state
investment count.
This are public those are online
additional annually a report
shall be submitted no later than
november first of each year to
the legislative finance
committee the revenue
stabilization and tax policy
committee and then any other
appropriate interim committee so
there has to be reports stated a
through the legislative finance
committee which of course is a
public committee which any of us
can go on in addition to the.
Thank you mister chair and would
you say that what's our checks
and balances so if we're making
bad investments or investments
don't look good in our fund is
not solvent what happens then
mister chair and representative
that's the case with everything
that's invested in our state
that's why the state investment
council has to approve it
they're looking at it also
it's it's a question for every.
I think we done a remarkable job
if you look at the funds that
are generating millions of
dollars and growing into the
billions thank you mister chair
and are there pervisions for
public access to two information
about the funds allocations yes
absolutely mister chair in
representative
secretary can address that but
there would be a report of
exactly where many w.
Chair in representative vincent
yes we have reports on exactly
which programs receive ma.
Happy to share the most current
reports with this committee as
to transparency of how the fund
is invested by the state
investment.
Thank you mister chair and for
someone that don't know a lot
about the the previous program
would it be fair and equit.
Mr chair and representative
instant yes as long as someone
applies and for these revenue
streams and it's a registered
approach.
Union or not
and mister chair representative
you can go online and it lists
all the.
Thank you mister chair how will
the work for solu.
Judiciously in the event of
general funds shortfalls
avoiding constitutional defici.
Mr chair in representative
instead there are two backstops
really.
I could probably do
an it talks about you know
looking at the at the health of
the fund before determining
whether even the the
statutorially set one point five
million dollars would be a
available for distribution I can
say that historically including
are before my time the the
distributions from the p what
have always been very
conservative in the best
possible way in the sense that
we always try to leave at least
one year of funding in the funds
so that we
never have to just cut off
funding in the event of a rapid
decline in revenue to the phone
we would always at least be able
to sustain one more year
than mister chair and if you
would turn over to pa.
The.
And when it talks about.
The.
Shell a point this is on the
line sixteen
shall a point in the printers
you have been training advisory
committee and that I was looking
down start starting online
sixteen a
and going down to
well starting on twenty i'm
sorry line twenty down to twenty
five where it says
two persons representing
employee employers of members of
a premise of principle trades a
two persons representing
organized labor
the more I read down through
that and then even over on two
lying two one page n.
Two persons employed by new
mexico educational entities
and then
going down to eighteen two
persons designated by
and representing the new mexico
college and university system it
goes all the way down to line
twenty three.
So.
Is there going to be
it there's really no
explanation.
On political equity at all and
so what i'm when i'm talking
about is how do we know that
there's some political equity
there so example right now in
the house we have forty five
democrats and t.
How can we at least get
something where there's you know
there's some republicans and
democrats both on the.
Mister chairman representative
then sent
so just to note this is the
current this is already the
current law regarding the
composition and the advisory
committee that is is a
politically blind process so in
when people subm.
Interest in serving on the
committee we do not look at
their.
Thank you mister chair but if
you.
Everything.
So thank you mister chair and
madame secretary but if you look
at payg starting on twenty.
And twenty two and twenty four.
And on page nine
line two
the line eighteen.
Line twenty one in line twenty
three.
How would you say that that's
going to be political equity.
I know you don't know their
political affiliation but let's
just be realistic.
Mr chair and representative.
The emphasis in the ex.
Is there expertise.
Chair and representative instant
we also do.
Political identity but does I
think help with the issue of
diversity as
thank you mister chair that's
all I got.
The.
The aspect of the h.
I know for our health.
To hear a little bit more about
how the hel.
Kind of healthcare programs are
available and then how
um
those types of program.
Mister chair representative
at so right now there are three
for sort of medical health care
adjacent um I would call them
apprenticeship so there for
things like medical coding but
it is a priority within the
wheel and the work for cynical.
Um to work and it also.
Task force has also identified
health care.
So part of w.
Broaden the range of registered
apprenticeships and that's what
we would do in order to more
opportunities for health care
apprentices and I would add to
that mister chairman
representative representative
referred to the eighty million
over four year allocation in a
proposed still yet to be heard
and passed legislation which was
strongly supported by people in
the health care field because so
much health training occurs that
are two year colleges but when
they don't when they're not
credit bearing courses the
opportunity scholarship doesn't
apply to them so that's totally
separate from this bill but just
so you're aware that there's
some other mechanisms being
explored that would address.
Thank you.
Thank you mister thank you for
the presentation I have a couple
of questions you mention that
appreciates programs and found
it
and this is when I help to
continue do you have any any
information about how much
underfunded at a.
Mister chair and representative
good all that
I don't have any and we don't
see the actual costs of every
single apprenticeship program so
it's hard for us to say although
we could certainly survey the
programs but as I mentioned some
of those reimbursements have
actually been going down for me
to year so we know that there's
our.
Thank you mister charles my
other question is what is the
contribution of under appreciate
programs to our public or public
where will be the public
benefits of an up with this
program.
Mister chair and representative
gorola
representative garrett really
highlighted one of the big ones
which is what the billions of
dollars of infrastructure doc.
And state we are very concerned
about having.
And so apprenticeships are one
of the the most we can we call
it the gold standard for
creating a construction and work
force and so that would be to me
in one of the major public
benefits in general
apprenticeships retain about
nine d plus percent of their
employees so.
And we know that in this.
And mister chair representative
I would just others when resend
that secretary mentioned new
programs cyber security
I robbed it explain them down
there's careers that didn't
exist five years ago ten years
ago and they're all
very approporate printerships
because you have your clash room
your classroom instruction but
you absolutely have to have the
hands.
So there's things that are going
to happen in the next five years
that we don't know
thank you thank you mister
and do you have that benefit
like whatever the last pain in
the printer's program how much
will it be that.
In the benefit just trying to.
Cause you know it was a good war
floors and we have one working
mister chair there is also tax
period and income receiving
through those programs so do you
have any information related to
that
mister chair representative of
gorola I don't have anything
with me better be happy to share
with the committee there
definitely number of national
studies on the return on
investment thinking because I
will be I mean that will be
proven a point and my last
question mister schier is we
talk about see the programs at
the high school level we we had
a couple of comments about
supporting this bill and also
very proud of the waiting well
instructor who uh received the
forty degree I know it's an
instructor
will high schools public and
this is education districts have
access to this funding will be
able like a high school be able
to uhm apply for these funding I
have their students actually.
Mr chair representative it
depends on the program that's
why I do refer to that eighty
million dollars.
Some printership most
printership programs require to
be eighteen not off so it really
depends on the program what the
what that specific program.
Mister chair representative just
this week the us department of
labor issued a proposed rule
that would really clearly
delineate the pathway for a ct
program to be the related
technical instruction component
of an apprenticeship because we
know that's a demand we know.
This so we can.
Program.
Thank you mister chair.
Man thank you for bringing this
bill or I
think everyone's warming up to
the thirty day sessions for
chair I think is our first bill
I think you've got you know with
a vast impurious in the
I hope those are their listening
those who represent in the in
our colleagues here i'm both
sides that we understand that
this is a this is not very
simple specially we can't know
everything about everything in
the legislature so it takes a
submit to uh they just these
things and understand them and
get a fair understanding so that
we can either support or
question these things to our
constituents and so mister chair
madame I I think
what what throws everybody off
is there's no one and I think
you got kind of these questions
over.
But there was nothing in the
budget through for have seen or
the governor's budget and looks
even located I didn't see
anything and I know that
mister chair
madam
representative in secretary you
guys had worked for solutions
you guys met and went over that
yesterday if I understand that
and this phone was not mentioned
there.
In a small especially with you
having just had
a that presentation yesterday
can you explain that why that
happened mr chair representative
there's three budgets
circulating there's the
executive budget coming out of
the governor's office there's
the legislative finance budget
circulating and sometimes
ignored but very important is
the legislative education study
committee in some areas they're
totally aligned in some areas
there's huge differences and for
example an havc we have working
groups that meet with the
analysts from the department of
finance
administration and the lfc to
come to consensus about those
things there is also money that
has not been allocated
so it is a process and
that process is happening I
believe we have until january
first or excuse me january
thirty first of february first
for that process to work its
way.
So this came out of a proposal
of people who have been very
concerned about a pretty ships
that would be housed in work for
solutions but it comes from a
very
foundational recognition that.
And I will also add there's
multiple revenue streams for
career.
They're stipred places where
that m.
You know mr
representative I know that we
we see the importance of of of
the creative programs I mean I
i've had a printerships a number
of approves work under my
license about the years where
they do you ever put in shape
and in other things in order to
get their license and and i'm a
full director and you know
having five kids with chair
representative we are
they're not all the same and I
think we have
in the past seen as conventional
college being a.
The path to success and all of a
certain now we're seeing and
wait a minute we've got a
shortage of plumbers
electricians etc and so I you
know and and I am going to tell
you that you know I am a big
supporter of locational schools
and then I know he gets changed
the name of all that stuff but
it's basically the same concept
rate and and so
the appreciate this is this is a
program that I understand I
think it just has a lot of
questions and and it again been
so quick after after iron
it creates a lot of doubt wait a
minute because we're talking
about at the end of the day
mister chair fifty million
dollars
and and so my understanding
please correct me as i'm going
along because i've been trying
to digits this i've been
studying this and and getting
back in the swing of things and
I believe it was an lfc and
rough legislature we've been
talking about creating these
funds and the ideas
and again please mister chair
and and madam express it explain
or correct me if i'm far wrong
what we're trying to do or what
the ideas I should say we the
ideas if you take this fifty
million and you put it in a car
a cd of fund or a cd what it
produces off the top the revenue
that it produces is what the
revenue stream will be for this
program and my understanding
that right chair yes mister
terrible senator very well
stated
so i'm trying to my banking
stops coming and so I can just
can understand what we're doing
here so mister chair
representative so where were we
were putting this fine
and we know most of chair that
we're not seeing the best
outcome in in this year per se.
And we're not sure what's going
to happen in the future
investments so that's it that is
a concern for me because we're
putting the seed money so my
question i'm gonna start with
this mister chair
representative.
Can we depth into the seed money
or the cd i'm gonna call it that
your fund this program where we
start all the same drawing down
what was intended to be
the the the amount that would
produce income the futu.
Mr chair and I representative to
assess again I mean i'm not a
great expert on this but.
Um there's some language there
that says money in the fund may
be expanded in the event that
general fund balances.
If I remember not that going to
go through the deal because I
mean I read this thing and and
again we did this quick and so
mr chair
madame secretary
show me where so this is saying
that
mid limit the stages.
I'm understanding they can dip
into the into the it looks like
you're deapen to see the cast is
not gonna leave it hall mr chair
and representative it says.
Two avoid this is line twenty
two um.
It says above that it says money
in the fun may be expended in
the event that general fund
balances including authorized
revenues and transfers to the
general final balances the
appropriation are these funds
they won't meet the level of
appropriations authorized this
money can be used for that
and to avoid an unc.
The legislature may appropriate
from this fund to the general
phone only in the amount
necessary to meet general.
School year only if the
legislature has.
From the appropriation.
And.
Save a deficit problem and I
will add that there's probably I
don't know if anybody's looked
at all the bills they should
sure have it but there's other
people who are proposing
legislation for a variety of
things to set up funds so you
know the legislature has to look
at all this we have funds that
have not had the exist in law
but they haven't been fully
funded at a given time later
they are funded so the alcohol
of this depends on it passing
and then getting.
Mister chair representative I
think I think my I think you
gave me an answer but not to my
question the answer that you
gave me was can the legislature
take money from the original
cd
keep using that word to
make ourselves meet the
constitutional
constitutionally make us balance
the budget mrperiod terri.
My question was mister chair
mister german was the cd the
find itself the fifty million
it's gonna create revenue
assume it's five percent that's
kind of the.
If for some reason it goes in
that let's just say that that it
doesn't go well
and we start it starts because
this isn't going to be a cd as
we think of it it's going to be
invested in multiple ways of my
understanding that it mister
representative correct it could
it could come back down and we
know that we're in a kind of
volatile time right now
if this hat if it happens.
That it doesn't have any
income basically then make any
money it actually received it
right came down can I don't see
anything here that says that you
cannot pull money from there the
seed money to pay for the
program so because in the reason
i'm asking that mister chair
representative it's because the
idea that I the way I understand
it is the person is trying to to
understand the fundamental and
its purpose is to not try to
touch it almost like a permit
bond that is not tapped into an
only is increased so that we do
have revenue for future
legislatures and we're not
having to use are current
revenues to pay for those
programs and also to in in the
future cause the revenue that it
needs to sustain these programs
so that you don't have these
this you're ups and downs and so
but I don't see the language in
mister chair representative of
that is an issue with every
single fund we've ever done and
if you look at page one forty
seven in volume three of the
budget books that you've all
been given at your desk on the
floor you'll see the history the
current
status of what it's over a
hundred funds and our state and
that's why it's focused in the
state investment council we have
incredible people running that
fun
that's all I can say I do
believe that that won't happen
but if that would happen then it
wouldn't be able to distribute
us much in a given year and
revenues fluctuate.
So mister chair and i'm not
going to be this is anymore I
just I think I mean my point the
other that one of the things
that making his little red place
go off for me is what they did
to the tobacco settlement fund I
am not sure if you know some
years back the legislature
pulled the money up a bit chunk
of money that we used to for
prevention etc for tobacco and
it never got paid back in it and
so we we have that come that's
why brother so other things that
are consuming to move on mister
chair representative the the.
Are we gonna have any new
ah providers at it.
Registered programs
that are is is there anything
changing as far as which
programs are you having new ones
and if you can can't just give
me a ballpark for your united
it's been brought up somewhere
union some or not somewhere
association he can give me an
idea of what those.
A mystery chair representative
to ourselves we do see new
programs coming online and and
it is one of the goal.
Earlier.
I have the list here in eight
could probably try to eyeball
but i'd be happy to send you a.
Our union shops.
Mister
but so these new providers or
these new rich heard on
programs who are they can you
since you know I mean they're
they're interested can you
please help me and you just
saying healthcare in general but
can you please help me
understand the little better
sure so mister chair
representative terrorists as
we see some new programs coming
I mean we don't we don't select
who starts a new program people
come to us in say we'd like to
either register an existing
apprenticeship programmer we'd
like to start a registered
apprenticeship program from
scratch so we don't really have
a way to sort of predict.
But some of the newer ones
include the through the santa fe
college that broadband splicing
program so as representative
gear it mentioned as technology
evolves we start to see
apprentice.
And so mister represent part of
my problem with a was trying to
reach out my university to see
if this can help our program
right in btw chair
representative if you can pay
for fifty million dollars I need
about I return to build my
vocational school so you might
need to show me how to do that
represent it
mr chair representative I think
so are there any fundamental
requirement changes
that are going to change on who
of those existing list is anyone
going to get excluded and are
the is going to be changes where
we have new requirements to
sustain the same representative
mister chairman representative
to assess it will stay the same
this bill does not affect the
the standards or regulations
applicable to register to
predict the programs and.
What happens mister chair
representative if you don't get
the appropriation you've got an
empty bill capacity
mister chair representative.
I think this fills a great need
and i'm not going to worry about
that right now it's committed by
committee floor by floor senate
committee by senate committee
right so I read a person the
building can you remember where
it was a representative
where
and this is one of the things
that bothered me a little is the
violations that you say that
there's going to be these
violations that could exclude
you out of this
is that it is that an allegation
or is that a final decision what
had as at work can you explain
that to me i'm sure mister chair
representative
in order to do one answer that
question
mr chair representative said I
says so we would make rules this
would be established through a
rule making process but i'll
tell you the initial thoughts
that we we've had on it is that
so they're spreadsheet going to
understand that there is program
sponsors who run the program and
then there are participating
employers and self often those
might be constr.
Who are participating employers
we would probably request from
the program sponsors some sort
of certification that there are
participating employers met.
And then we have the ability to
query minimum are weak because
we administer the public work's
minimum.
That and we've already i've
talked to the.
There are cid violations and and
we would only
are proposed rule would say that
we would only consider it to be
a violation of the public works.
Finding an unresolved
unresolved finding so let's say
the decision said you have to
pay back wages and that employer
had not paid the back wages that
would.
We don't want to create any
process.
And c ID has expressed a desire
to do it the same way so that we
we would check for a ravication
or suspension of a c id is she
license and that would be the
ground so that there.
About whether a person is in
compliance or not and then we
also would contemplate giving a
cure period because again the
program sponsor may not control
those violations and so that.
The program sponsor could then
decide either to exclude the
employer who had those
violations or two
um you know otherwise help that
employer whatever their problem
was so and in that kind of where
I was troubled is mr chair
representative and secretary is
I don't have an analysis from
cad on and that particular that
that was something that came to
mind III thought about it where
is this or cities
recommendation no recommendation
where were they sit on this and
this issue and having hardly
going to handle that because cad
you currently
part of the program
represented this terrible senate
surround us no currently
construction industries division
regulation licensing does not
have a role in apprenticeship
but this is not a situation
where we like.
I'm participa.
I don't know if if regulation
licensing was asked to provide a
physical impact but certainly.
The conversation
was mister
I know mister chairs because I
had a had fifteen page billion
and I had
that is question mr chairman
presented have also assist goes
through the process this is the
first bill being heard at the
next hearing you'll have a much
more filled out FIR that's the
problem is here I represent.
Understand.
I understand the structure it
was it's the it's the
we have the fifty million dollar
issue of how that was going to
work mister chair in our respect
to the chair I really do III
don't want to i'm not trying to
do that but for my constitution
surrounding
is always been real good at that
thank you mister
thank you mister chair and so
that was my only thing was true
is is because it is it has moved
on quite fast we have cad the
city analysis and worried about
what are those contractors going
to say that involved in that
there are some all the sudden
new requirements maybe for their
partnership program that may be
you know that are going to get
online so that i'm just because
it's so so much to really take
on
you know city covers a lot of
you know a lot of different
whether it's each back or
electrical and etc there's a lot
there and that's all stranded
get that right mister
representative there's no
requirement no new requirements
as a secretary said for
printership program thank you
mister chair representative just
wrap it up here so that the
contractor would be given
ample time to resolve and be
able to get back on on track if
they need it to that is
important mr representative yes
okay and the last question i'm
gonna ask I think because i.
Oh is how long would you give
them because I I were missed
chair representatives sometimes
i've seen sometimes when you
work with the
rld it doesn't happen quick and
even just to get a license
issued is not happening run a
thirty day time period in that
concerns me that they fall out
of this compliance we just went
through a pays I had a number of
constituents reach out to me you
look at the renewed my license
etc as they didn't they change
the program or they went online
instead of you know on paper and
things that cause problems and
here and we're cleaning up
things people losing the license
stuff it's just not a quick
process to work with rld not to
put him down but I think every
department is chair
representative is understaffed
and that's part of the promise
of when we put these dates we
don't have a way to to to get
him back online that's.
Representatives and assessors of
course all this would be subject
to the rule making process but
in no instance would this be the
first time someone learned of an
issue right if you've had your
your license revoke to suspended
if you've had a a finding
against you under the public
work's minimum wage act already
known this and probably have
have fought it for a while so
again the cure period would be
for the program's sponsor and
they would have the choice of
either excluding that particular
employer or bringing that
employee helping that employer
come into come
again thank you mister charit I
think a lot of it was I didn't
have all the analysis and at the
gives me some powers I making
assessment questions that's what
committee is all about and I in
I think it just happening
without all that for me to work
with us which causing me to do
that thank you mister chair and
mister chair representative the
point you brought up.
Alert legislative.
Thank you and
you know mister chairman reps
and given and so
satellite you mentioned that
that there are developing
a printership programs in
teacher training
you know current teacher
training is anchored at the
college of education of a
university.
What type of teacher training
are you looking at that offers
the scholarships if it's not
anchored at a at a university
mr chair and representative of
garcia we are just in the
preliminary stages of actually
applying for a gram but this is
a national trend and it wouldn't
change necessarily the
instruction but what it would
changes that the fundamental
piece of apprenticeships is
earned while you learn and right
now for most.
Learn then earn and sell the
ability to.
Is what we're.
And i'll add mister chair and
represent groceria there's a
cooperative education services
that run.
Based na.
It's independent and another
thing that we're looking.
They don't go through formal
program so it's it's again it's
a.
Thank you mister.
Thank you mister.
I just wanted to clarify a few
things.
And so this is that one
opportunity where we all have
mister chair the operat.
Of changes if there has to be
changes given the questions
that.
So that's.
Really important point because
that's.
Questions.
So we will track.
Wanted to make and then final
point mister chair is just that
it we have a proven track record
with our p.
Question about how effective.
Employment vast employment gaps
and so.
This is the point is that unions
exemplify the model of successes
in a printership programs and as
i've been seeing over nowhere.
That has.
The.
Yeah.
The end of the day we're looking
for is getting people sortified
to do those jobs looking at.
The biggest concern.
And a hardest but.
Yeah.
All right right now there's
thirty two degree
but you're.
And I mean we don't have people
drained to take care of this
eight problems or anything
that's happening in our existing
buildings we have people get to
do it I mean III see these
trucks running around with the
different symbols on them
throughout the schools but
apparently
there's running around the
schools because my stu.
We can get we can get these
people create fast especially
with this new world we didn't
want.
Certified and ready to go.
The.

Thank you mister chair I I love

said i'm a big supporter of
career technical education the
funding aspect still there still

floor but I appreciate the
answers appreciate.
Thank you mister.
