Opportunity
because everyday
citizens such as yourself,
all of you could become CASA
volunteers
is
it's a court rule
and it's 10-1
64 which
allows the CASA to get
all of that private
information
that is happening
with a family.
And to become a CASA
volunteer, if you look at
the bottom of your
uh third
piece of paper, it says
uh a CASA volunteer
just has to
commit 10 to 15
hours to work a case,
have the desire and
patience to work with
families,
participate in in-depth
training sessions and
to be a CASA volunteer, you have
to go through training, you have to
be sworn in by a Judge. You
have to do a lot of things before
you could become a volunteer.
You have to complete a background
check and get all of those things
done, which is a very
important things that you have
to do
if uh your
next page where it says,
what does a Casa do
a CASA volunteer?
I like to say, puts
all the puzzle pieces
together
each CASA program.
Uh The staff
of the CASA program have a
blanket court order
which enables them
to be on New Mexico's search.
So those of you that are
lawyers know that that's a
system where you could find
out all about what's
happening in
court. You get to have the
affidavits, anything that's
filed in court. And
because a court
appointed special
advocate has to be
sworn in by a Judge,
the CASA program gets to find
out everything. So when
I want to make a
huge point of that, because
Casas know everything that's
happening in a case.
OK. Cyfd
has their little piece.
A therapist has a piece
of the puzzle, the
family, the
foster parents,
any other kin have
just that piece they're allowed
to and Casa
because they have this
court order that in a way,
think of it
as
subpoena, right?
The CASA takes this court
order and they get to find out
how's the child doing in
school? What's happening
in school? How's the child
doing in therapy? How's
the family doing
when they have to look
earlier today?
Some family Members
talked about
what they're asked to do.
The CASA gets to see all that
and say, wait a minute, the
child was brought into
care because
of substance
use. But yet now you're requiring
the parent to
have somewhere to live.
It's ok to live in a shelter.
Now, you're requiring the parent to
have a job. It's ok
not to have a job. You're
require, requiring
the parent to go to anger
management. That's not why
you brought the kid into care.
So a CASA volunteer,
part of what their job
is, is to write a court
report to the Judge
and they could write those things
in the court report saying,
hey, I couldn't do
everything that you're requiring
of these parents.
You need to do something
different. And that's the
beauty of a court
appointed special advocate.
And that's the beauty of
the CASA program.
And the
next little piece I have is
a CASA program. Staff
also provide specialized
support. I talked about
the 12 nonprofit
agencies around
the State that
run a CASA program.
Some of them do access
visitation, some of them
have parenting, some
of them appoint Casas in
juvenile cases.
They do a lot of other things
for their community
and the CASA
programs want to do more
for CYD also
right now
in most
offices in the State,
Children are spending the night
in the offices and
I had a phone
call with a lot of the local
directors. And they said
Veronica Cyfd
is saying, can
you bring some food
down? Can you
supply some
clothes? And
of course, the cost of programs
are, yes, I'll do
that however,
but is there also
some funds that could come with
that local
CAA programs could be a vendor
of the State, then
provide the food and
then charge Cyfd for
that, right. So there
there could be some processes
put in place where
CASA programs as a
local community
group
can help Cyfd
and figure out what some of those next
steps are because
their Children should not
be, well, they shouldn't be
spending the night in Cyfd
offices and we all know
that's occurring and every
time a Costa director gets
the phone call they want to
say. Yes, of course,
I'll bring Dion's, I'll
call it in right now.
But there has to be another
way because
if that child is there,
that means a foster
parent or a treatment
center is not getting
those funds. So there's
funds for that child,
right? So we have to do
better. And when you
look at some of the pieces
that Casa programs
engage in right
now
is
they want to help. And
this is an opportunity
for New
Mexicans to
really step up and say
I can help too and I want to give
it to Brandy so she can talk a
little bit about her program
and what her program
does.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and the
Committee Members. Um Again, my name
is Brandy White. I am
the program director
for Messia Valley
CASA. Our office is in Las
Cruces, but we serve the
entire county,
all of Dona County because
that's the third judicial district.
And so we
are tasked with advocating
for anywhere from
100 and 50 to 200
kids at any one time.
Um We're really proud
of our program and the way that we've
been able to bounce back after
COVID before COVID,
we served about 60%
of our kids with an
individualized CASA
during the pandemic, it dropped
to about 40%
and now we're getting back
up to that 60%
mark. Our goal
is to serve 100%
of our kids. We
know that kids with CASA volunteers
have better outcomes.
They receive
court ordered services.
They get more
educational
advocacy. We
offer specialized training for
education because we want to
make sure that our kids,
even though they're in foster care,
that they're getting every
single opportunity in school
as their peers are.
We fight
day in and day out to
make sure that our kids in care
have everything that they
need.
It's a big
job, but we're happy to do
it and to come before
you and to share our
work
and we'd be happy to take any questions
that you May
have.
>> Do you have any
questions?
Well,
I mean, we could talk for
days about Casa. But yes,
the other part that
Casas do when she mentioned about
education is CASA
programs. Do
appoint uh educational
decision-maker per law. The
parent should be the
educational decision-maker.
But in the event that the
parent is
absent, a CASA
program can
appoint the
educational decision maker,
which is really important. Every
child must
have one per law.
>> You know, before we
go to the Committee for questions, it might
be really useful for us to
learn how you
recruit them,
how much training you're able to
give them and
how do you retain them?
>> Uh Well,
part of it, uh
brandy kind of alluded
to a little bit is
volunteerism
is down
nationwide.
Uh People don't
uh get in a job,
you go to any restaurant
these days and they ask
you to be patient because they can't
find people to work in a restaurant.
It's hard to get people to
volunteer after COVID.
Uh part of how
uh CASA programs
recruiters is they get into
the community. The
best way to recruit is
always
having a current
volunteer
recruits, a
friend of theirs. But
all CASA
programs, they are out in the
community, they go to
rodeos, they
go they
speak on TV, all different
ways. Once a volunteer
comes in, part of the
training is
that they have to go through
30 hours of training.
So they go through the 30
hours of training. And part of
that training is court
observation. Once
they go through the 30 hours of
training, they get sworn in by
a Judge. And then after
that point, they have
to, they're required to have
12 hours of in
service every year.
So it's a pretty
intense training
that they have to go through.
And local
programs ask
volunteers to
commit at least 18
months. And that 18
month is a
part of that court
where courts have
to have a case go through the
system within 18 months.
That doesn't happen.
Uh But
volunteers, you're hoping
that they become lifers,
but it's kind of hard to get
somebody who wants to
commit. And it's hard. Just
like earlier today,
people talked about burnout
when uh you're
a volunteer and you read the
case and you see what's
occurred and it seems
like no one is caring.
There's a lot of volunteers
that end up quitting. So when you talk
about retention,
it's really tough to retain
a volunteer because
the hard piece
is they feel
that the system isn't
moving quick
enough
and she's going to talk
about a little bit about
retention. >> Let
me give you some specific examples
of how we do retention.
Um We have a staff
of five there are
three of us who supervise and
support volunteers.
We do that by
connecting with them at least once a
month to review their case
and talk about what's going on.
Um We offer
inservice trainings from
professionals in our
community who
deal with all different kinds
of things related to our
child welfare cases. We have
people come in to talk about
um medical
uh
medically assisted treatment
for substance use. We
have nurses
come in to talk about
kids who have been exposed.
We have housing providers
come in. But the thing
that our volunteers love the most
is something that we do every month and
we call it CASA conversation
and it's a time that we provide
either coffee and doughnuts for
breakfast or lunch.
And we just have our volunteers
come and talk and they
share with each other,
they share their cases
because of the confidentiality
laws. Our volunteers
cannot talk to anybody about
the work that they're doing. And so it can be
very isolating.
And so we give an opportunity
for them to come together. They
share their struggles, but they
also share their successes.
And that's really important to keep
people going in this
difficult work because
they get to talk about what is
working and how they've connected
with their permanency worker
or what trick worked with
a certain foster family to get them
in the door and it empowers
them to keep going
forward.
>> Stefani.
>> Oops,
thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, last year,
I believe down in Rio
Dosso. Um,
we had a presentation from
CASA as well
and one of the questions
I asked and I'm gonna
repeat the question is
that, um, many
people, especially
retirees
become interested
in this but
also,
um, leave
early because they
feel they
can't make that
full-time
commitment
for a family
trip,
um,
hospital procedure, whatever.
So, could you comment
on whether or not you're
set up to
do
substituting?
>> Yes, absolutely. Senator.
Um, we with
the staff that are assigned,
um, the staff, there's one
staff person per volunteer
and for the case, and so the staff
person would follow,
would stand in for
that volunteer whenever they can't
go. And so
if it's, we have lots of
volunteers who travel, they
travel around the world,
they obviously have medical
procedures. And
so because our staff
provides such good supervision
to volunteers, they
always know what's happening in the
case the same way that the volunteer
does. And so we can kind of be
interchangeable.
The reason we need volunteers though.
And our staff can't advocate for all
of the kids is because it
takes so much
energy and time
to learn that one case and to
advocate directly for that
family. That that's
really the power of CASA is that
there's one person who's there and
consistent for that. But if
we have to step in as a staff
person, we absolutely can do
that for folks to support
them. >> So Mr.
Chair, you, you did mention
though, you need more volunteers.
So, are you
advertising that
flexibility when
you go
out for recruitment?
>> We sure try. Uh
you know, it's a big role and
there's a lot to talk about.
Um And so like, I know
my program, we do magazine
ads. Um but, you know,
you're trying to catch people as
they're scrolling or they're
flipping. Um But what
we really hope is that people will
go to our website that they'll
call us, that they know another
cost of volunteers so that
it can be shared with them that really,
it's about 10 hours a month
and that there is quite a bit of
flexibility there. >> OK.
Thank you very much. Thank
you, Mr.
Chair,
>> Representative Chavez,
followed by Senator
Rodriguez. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chair. So I have a
couple of questions. One
is um do you have
any information on the
demographics of your co CASA
volunteers? And then
my second question is
um you talked about
um CASA
volunteers being the
educational decision maker.
So when in that kind of a
situation, how are the
parents involved
also in that decision
making?
>> Uh I uh
representative, I wanna
talk first about uh
being the educational decision
maker. And so what local
programs do is
when a parent is
absent and
for older youth, that's when it's
happening more often
if it
turns out that
because per law, the
parent is the educational
decision maker and the court
should name the parent.
So it it rarely
occurs when
there is a parent able
to do it. It's I know of a
couple instances when it
has occurred because the
parent actually is the one
who asked for it because they're like,
I don't know enough information.
My child's on an IEP
they're having all these meetings, they're
asking me to do all this.
And so it's only
happened a couple of times. And what
we also do for the local programs
is we work with the
ombudsman office, education
ombudsman's office and
they will one
on one, talk to that
CASA volunteer who's the
educational decision-maker
to help them navigate
the system because it's really
hard to navigate uh
the system of IE PS
and especially for a child who's
in care. And then
do you have
an education? >> Uh
Sure. Um
We work to
incorporate parents as much
as possible. And sometimes
when our volunteers serve as
an educational decision-maker,
it's really to serve as an
example for a parent
for what can be done in the
school system.
Since the IEP
law is federal, it can
get very tricky to understand
that. But like Veronica said,
not only do we work with the ombudsman,
we also work with disability rights,
New Mexico to make
sure that educational rights
are being upheld. And then
the goal um especially
when we're working towards reunification
is that that responsibility
would be placed back with
the parent. If
there's some reason that they couldn't do it
while working their treatment plan.
And as Veronica stated, we
do have a number of older
youth who
for a variety
of reasons, there is no parent
involved and because they mov'e
a lot, there's not the stability of
a foster parent to serve in that
educational role. And
so the consistent costs of
volunteer really steps
in to ensure that they're getting
their educational rights
met.
And then you also asked about data
or about demographics,
right? So
we work very, very
hard, not only in New Mexico,
but Costa programs across the
country to ensure
that the demographics of our
volunteers match the
demographics of
our State and of the
families that are in care.
Um There is a bit
of a mismatch right now.
Um because
typically people who
are able to volunteer
um are, as
the Senator stated earlier, often
retirees, they
are often a different income
level than the families that we
serve
and that all
goes back into our training. And
it's so important that we're
able to train our cost of
volunteers or advocates
about the
issue of poverty
being separate from neglect.
Um We train
them about issues
around mental
health and substance use and
all these things that we keep talking
about because we want our
volunteers to have the same
value set that we have
in that every family
deserves the opportunity
to be together when they can do that
safely and
that the color of your skin
or your zip code shouldn't have
any impact on that. And
so that's a training issue
that we're constantly
addressing
>> and also that uh
training has changed
from Casa's
been around for the last
45 years
in New Mexico. Is that
training used to be like Monday
through Friday, right? And
so the what the State
Association is doing is
offering uh training
where it could be on zoom,
where training could be in the
evening, training could be
on weekends and local
programs do the same. So
a different type of
volunteer can be
recruited and
that you could show
volunteers
that you
can do it because there's
gonna be huge staff uh
support and
we use a secure
system. It's called Optima
where volunteers
get to put some notes in there.
And then when
the staff go to
either court or they sit in
on a treatment team meeting,
they're able to see what's
really occurring on the
case.
>> Thank you, Representative. Then we
go to Senator Rodriguez to
be followed by Representative
Vincent.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good
afternoon Veronica
and the presenters. Appreciate all your
work. Just
quickly, you
mentioned that our
kids still sleeping
in offices and so on. I guess that
struck me because I thought
that a while back,
we had really made an improvement
in that um because
we had expressed some very
big concerns, not only in this
Committee but LFC and other
committees. Do you see any
improvement on that at all?
Um Or is it still
truly the same or getting
worse?
Thank you, Mr.
Chairman,
because that was not something Mr. Chairman
that was accepted as we know.
Um So I'm hoping to
hear different. Thank
you. Yes, >> Mr. Chair,
Senator. Um
I can speak for
Dona County and
it is getting better
in our county. Um I
was told today that the kiddo who had
been there for a few days
was put into another placement.
So that's fantastic.
I do know, speaking from
the CAA directors in the
southeast part of the State, it's
getting worse. And so
a lot of it really depends
on what's happening in different
areas and jurisdictions.
>> I see.
And, um,
there are
Children spending
and you spending
time in the offices.
I used to be a CASA on
a case and for a
youth that didn't
have any family
and I decided the
best decision was to stop
being the CASA and to
become a kin. So
I'm like her grandmother now
and she's been in the Bernal Leo
offices for
eight weeks now.
So it's
a problem. Right.
It's a problem.
It hasn't gone away.
And earlier you had some
people talk about, it's
still an issue.
And
how do you change
that? Right.
There's 2000
kids in care and
how, what's the population of New
Mexico? It seems like we
should be able to do something about
it. But
what, why are the
kids in the offices
because there aren't any
places for them?
Right. There
May not be foster
homes. There May not
be,
uh,
transitional living
places for them.
So, what do you do?
Well, you keep trying to
find a place but the
other thing is while they're there,
they have to be comfortable.
Right. They have to
have an area where they could
eat, they have to be
able to have a bed to sleep
on and not the floor,
not a cot, they have
to be able to go out and go
to the movies, they have to
be able to go out and get their
haircut.
It has to be
at least ok for them
to be there.
So even though they're there,
we have to change something
because a
youth has
the right to refuse
to go somewhere. Ok.
So a child who
is 1516 and
they offering them somewhere to
go out of Albuquerque
and it might be Texas.
It might be Roswell. It might
be hobbs. It's not
Albuquerque. That
youth per law can say
I do not want to be placed
there. That's
ok. The youth
needs to have that power.
But if they're going to be in
the office, you have
to make them comfortable,
you have to give them basic
rights. So
it's still happening.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much
for that Mr. Chairman. Just briefly
follow up. But in the daytime,
I'm picturing to say a
nine year old, 10 year
old taken
by CYFD and put in an
office that's to sleep.
But what happens with that child the next
day? How can they
as traumatized as they are and so
on? They can't go to school
the next day and do
they try or why does it
work? I, I can't
imagine it. Thank
you.
>> Yes, to all of those.
So if the,
if the youth
is uh
10, let's
say they'll take them to school.
Uh one of the workers
will take the
youth to school and then after
school they'll bring the youth
back.
So it it
it's difficult, it shouldn't be
happening, right?
>> He is him.
It shouldn't be. Thank you very much
for that. Thank you, Mister Chairman. Very
sad to >> hear. Thank
you. Thank you,
Senator Rodriguez. Next
Representative Vincent
followed by Representative
Thompson.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you
presenters. One thing
I've always been interested
in is the families in
need of court order services.
And I heard you mention that
is that resource
available or does it
ever dwindle
out?
You don't have to give me the long
version. I I just want
to make sure that that resources
>> we don't a court-appointed
special advocate per
law doesn't
>> sorry if you're not
speaking. Thank you. Turn your mic
off.
That was cancer.
>> Ok?
Casa
doesn't get involved until
after adjudication.
So we don't get
involved in fino's
cases. It's only
after the
um
custody and then adjudication
that we get involved.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and
presenters. I'm glad you give me
that answer. So I have a little bit
extra time.
We have High
Mountain Youth in
Lincoln County
and it just got its
license and
our volunteers were super
excited to be able to
start receiving
kids in that needed to come
in. And
the minute that they
put it out there that
they were open for
business, they
got six of
probably the, probably
the worst ones
that didn't mind.
That didn't do what they
said. And it just
rocked that
little agency.
How do, how do we fix stuff
like that? How can we
start them off easy and
then give them the worst of the
worst?
>> Uh Mr. Chair and
Representative, um
one of what
I would call is
an unintended consequence
of leaving kids
home longer
before uh
formal system
intervention is that
many of the kids who do come
into custody
are exponentially
more traumatized.
And so then when
the systems come in
and are trying to address
their needs and their trauma,
that's exactly what's happening.
And that's part of why
there's so much turnover with
CYFD caseworkers. That's
why it's difficult to recruit
foster homes because our
kids needs are so
intense. And
so we've been talking all
morning or hearing about prevention
services. And there has
to be a way to intervene
earlier, to put in more
services earlier to
prevent the levels of
trauma from getting to that point
to where our service providers
don't know what to do for
them.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and I appreciate
that answer. And
you know what she was
trying to explain to me is,
you know, these kids have phones when
they come in there and they can't take their
phones away from them. They
don't know what they're looking at
who they're talking to
and I'll talk
to you offline about
this, but some
of the things that
they have to do to get the
phone, that's a
problem for me. Thank you,
Mr. Chair.
>> Well, I also wanted
to make a comment on that
is a youth
has a right to have their phone.
I mean, as I'm presenting
how many of you are looking at your
phones right now. Ok.
So it's not
about
denying a youth
rights because
a youth gets to have
rights. I mean, I think
of my youth, my
grandkids, my Children
and I look at my Verizon and I
see how much they're on the
phone. It's ok.
Ok. So part
of it is trauma
informed care of the people
who are taking care of them, that
youth can have the phone, that
youth look at certain
things. Ok. Think
of what some
of the youth that you know,
are looking at at their
phone. So it is
ok for a youth to
have all that. So it's
about balancing, what does
that mean? That
could be their only family,
their phone, their friends
on the phone, the people,
they follow the tiktok
people, they follow, that's
their only family
and you can't take that away
from them. So there's a whole
piece of that that
you have to look at and
it, and it's not
coming in and having so
many rules, it's about
having the conversation,
it's engaging in the
conversation and
talking to youth
of, of what
they need and what their needs
are.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and
I'm not talking about just
taking things away. I'm talking about
rules. So when it's
time to go to bed, you don't get
to stay up all night and have your
phone. I don't, I, I mean,
and I'm not a, I'm
not a rule maker and I've never
been around kids like that,
you know, my kids,
when they were little, they knew that when
it's time to go to bed, put that phone up
and let's call it a day
content. What are they
looking at? How are you monitoring
that? And I,
I just don't think that they ought to
be willy-nilly, being
able to look at anything that they want.
There has to be some
structure in order
and again, I'll
talk to you offline about this,
but some of the kids
that they received at this
facility were
unruly.
Well, there has to be rules.
It's just we all have to have
rules.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Vincent Representative
Thompson.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair and thank
you ladies. So
do you have any
involvement with
Project Echo in terms
of training, in terms of
support? Anything along
those lines?
No. Is that
something you're familiar
with?
Um You
should be,
they do all kinds and their,
their, um,
getting their feet wet in
special education. A lot of
it. They've got great
behavioral health.
Um, they do like
grand rounds
throughout the State and
so it, there May be some
things that they can help you with.
So if you would like to
contact me, I'll put you
in contact with someone.
Um, and then
for your volunteers, I
mean, it's, it's
hard work, it's
emotionally hard work.
Do you offer
support groups for
them? Do you have opportunities
for them to just get
together and
complain and moan about
the systems? Like we,
that's what the Session is for,
is for us to complain and moan.
So, do you have something like
that?
>> Yes. The CASA programs
all over the State will
have a cas, a
coffee with Casas.
They'll have their CASAS
hang out at the office
so that they can engage
in conversation and talk about
what's going on, how they could
work and things that
they could do and also
to brainstorm and
say, Hey, what can
we do for
Cyfd? My worker
has been amazing but
she's spending all day driving the
kids around. What if we do
something different? Does somebody
want to go take her some lunch
or take him some lunch? So
it's an opportunity for everybody
to share and figure
out how
to, how to feel better
and then make people in the system
feel better.
>> Thank you so much. Thank you,
Mr. Chair.
>> Anybody else on the Committee with
questions?
I've, I've got a couple
so I'll
close it out here.
Um,
so I, I guess I hadn't
realized until your presentation
today that
you also
see yourselves as advocates
for the families as
well as the kids.
Does that get you
crosswise for the department
sometimes?
>> Yeah. Uh Mr.
Chair, um, the nature
of our job is getting crossways
with the department,
um,
in advocating
for kids, We
know that kids do best when they're
placed with their families. And
so oftentimes that
means advocating for their parents.
Absolutely.
Um We
work really hard to have
good relationships with the
department. And one
thing that especially I
can speak to my program
is that we
talk all the time with our
volunteers about
seeing the workers as
human beings, as
people in our community, as
people who have hearts
that want to do this very
difficult work. And we
can have compassion for
individual workers.
But that doesn't mean that we
don't hold the department
accountable for taking care of
kids. And so we can
hold both of those things at the same
time. And yes, it can get
a little tricky sometimes to
maintain those relationships,
but then to also go up
the chain of command as
needed so that we can get
the department to do what
it needs to do for kids and
families.
>> So at this
point, would you, would you say
that the CASA
program's relationship with
CYFD
is one in which
you're really
partners? Or is there
still some sense
that you're not always brought to
the table with, with them when
they're making their plans or
when they're making their
decisions.
>> Um
Mr. Chair, I would say that
um CASA
programs that have had
stability, have the
stability in those relationships.
Um In Dona
County, our program
is absolutely a considered
and equal member of the team.
Um I know that that is
the same in Bernalillo. I
know that the,
the strongest CASA
programs have worked really hard
to build those relationships.
Um, some of our other
COSTA programs that we're working to build
up, we're teaching them to
do that same thing so that,
um, across the State, we can
have that same positive
relationship where we
can have hard conversations
with each other. We can come to
different conclusions about what
might be best for kids and families,
but that we can do that in a way
that we can still mov'e
forward together.
>> And, um,
a lot of times
Cyd might not
notify the
CASA about a change
in placement, although they're
required to, uh,
but they're not notifying the
Guard at Lytham or the youth attorney
either. Uh, do you take
comfort that no one's being
informed? No,
everyone should be informed,
but it's a real difficult
time right now. Right there, there are
many, uh,
offices that,
uh, hadn't had
CYFD attorneys,
their offices
that have had to share
Cyfd attorneys.
Uh, so it's a really
difficult time right now,
uh, for
Cyfd and
what's occurring.
And
Casa
is a partner
in the sense that
Casas want the best
for the family and the
Children. And
Casa's
work as
much as they can with
CYFD. But
per law
is they still have to
write a report to a Judge.
So when they write that
report, they
need to put all of the things
that have occurred on the case
and let the
Judge know what
is happening and what their
recommendation is. And
if their recommendation
has gets in crosshairs
with Cyfd,
then it's up to that Judge
to look at that and see what they're
gonna do. A CASA can
say that the department did not
meet reasonable efforts
and the Judge can look at that and
say, oh, what does that mean?
That means that the Cyfd
didn't do their job and the
Judge could rule on that and
it's ok for the CASA to
do that if
that's what they saw and the
evidence shows
it,
>> there's another
program uh
that we've
had for as long as we've had
costs. That's the
Substitute Care Advisory
board. It used to be the Citizens
Advisory Boards.
Now, they're not that
way. How frankly,
how are they working
and, and, and do they
collaborate with you at
all?
>> Uh Yes, they
send out notices
uh when they're gonna review
a case but they
don't review every case,
right? So that,
that's a complete
difference of, of what
they uh what we
each do.
So
they're, they
review cases
they're not out there
interviewing and working
with uh either families
or Cyd or the
school so that there's
a huge difference between us.
But yes, uh local
programs will get notice
when they're gonna review a case
and they will hear from
the CASA.
>> So, so you go to the
meetings, you meet with
the special,
the substitute care
advisory
staff person
who's
volunteers, volunteers.
>> So they're volunteer
based also. So
they'll interview, they
invite CYFD,
they invite attorneys, they
invite other interested parties
and they always invite
Casas
>> last question for
you. You
mentioned that there are some staff
for the CASA program.
Are they full
time? And
where do they get, who pays
them? Where do you, where, where are
you funded?
>> Uh Hope and a
prayer.
Uh We're funded through the
administrative office of the court.
So there's
uh 13 programs
in the State and the budget is
1.4
million. So if you
look at that, what is that
average out to
be? That's only like 90
K A program. So as
nonprofits uh
programs
apply for VCA
funds, they apply
for United Way, they
apply for a lot
of foundations.
So local
programs
aren't fully funded
from the State. Uh
But what the
State, the important thing
is that they have a contract
with the administrative office of the
court in order to
engage in doing
this, CAS CASA
is the only agency
that can appoint a
volunteer and follow a
child case
in protective
services.
>> And, and so
is every single
one of those 13
costs, there is a full time
staff person, at
>> least at least one full
time staff
person
and then looking at their
budget, they have to go
elsewhere to fund
their
program.
>> Very good. Yes, Representative
Jones. >> Thank you,
Mr. Chair. I have a question
about Luna counties. You said they're the
only CASA that is,
um, county run that's
not independent
nonprofit. Do you know the,
the history behind
that
about the them being county
run instead of nonprofit?
I'm trying to find out no one can
tell me.
That's, that's my
district.
>> I, I do
not know, uh, where
it came from, uh, on
why they're county
run, but
I will try
to look back at some of
the history and see,
um, I, I
guess part of, I'm sure your
question is, is that
a good thing? Is that not
a good thing? Uh,
being a nonprofit
has huge advantages,
right? Because
as a Senator
Ortiz Pino
talked about is
what is the funding?
Right? So, if you're
an independent nonprofit, you
get to then go for a lot of
different funding, you get to do a
lot of different things.
So I will look
into that for you and get
you an answer.
>> Thank you. I'd appreciate that.
Yes. As you, you were
saying, how
many other funding sources there
are? I just have to wonder if we're
taking advantage of those
or not. So I'd appreciate
any info you could give me.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. >> And,
and I just realized, and so you
really are in every judicial
district,
there's 13 judicial
districts
>> where
we're not in
Sibila County. Even
though it's a judicial
district, like the fifth
judicial district has three
CASA programs.
So even though it
appears that there
is Sibila County
does not have a CASA program at
the moment, we can't get
a nonprofit agency
to be willing to open a
program there. Considering
the base low
funding is probably about
$42,000.
>> Ok. But
the goal would be ultimately
to have a Costa
program in each judicial
district to cover every
county in each judicial
district. >> Yes, to cover every
county and the Judge
there desperately wants
a program to start in that
county.
>> Ok. Well, thank
you. Anybody else with any
other questions or issues
to bring up? I
want to thank you for coming. I,
first of all, I want to thank you for the work
you're doing as Casas
uh incredibly
important.
Um One thing
that, that substitute care
advisory
system does do is
they generate an annual report
for us. No,
I I've been super critical
of that because it comes in so
late that
we, you know, it's
almost like,
but what's going on now.
But you know, it
might be useful if you
also, when
you in your spare
moments uh
generated a, a report
on what you see going on
that. Legislators ought to know
about Cyfd so
that we could be more helpful to
it. >> We would uh
love to provide
a report for you in order
to get it, uh, in a
timely manner. When would you
want that
report?
For?
>> True.
>> Did you say October February
by October October?
>> Yeah. So then we would have
it, we could, we could have a
meeting about it,
you know, put it on an
agenda and then
Members might adopt some of
those issues that
you raise
for the upcoming legislative
Session. >> We will have a report
to you by October
1st. >> That's great.
Thank you.
We didn't even have to send
you a sternly worded
letter. Very, very.
That's great. That's very
good. That's good. It could
still. All right.
Thank you so much. Thank you for the
work you're doing and for coming
today and sharing with
us
a number of you
didn't get a chance to introduce
yourselves to our vast
radio audience out
there. So,
um, Senator Lopez, when
anybody that hasn't already
introduced themselves, please
introduce yourselves to the
audience.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair Linda
Lopez State Senator
District 11,
Southwest quadrant of Bernalillo
County
>> Bill.
Thank you, Mr. Chair Bill
Tollman representing
district 18, which
is in the mid
Northeast Heights, Albuquerque.
Thank
you.
>> I'm Liz Stannis. I'm
Senate district 39
currently, parts of six
counties and it will change
in January to four counties.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator
Nancy Rodriguez. From Santa Fe
District 24.
Thank you
>> and Senator Bento. Thank
you, Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee on three
mckinley San Juan. Thank
you.
I think everybody else has introduced
themselves. So with that, we'll mov'e
to the next item on our
agenda, which
is the new Mexico Child
Advocacy Networks, N
MC. And we have
the Executive
direct, the co Executive
director, Lori
Lynn Violante
and three of the youth
from that program, three youth leaders,
Mia Calle
Joanna Delaney
and Ya, pending.
Thank you all for coming and
being with us
today
and every
month,
I think we're ready for you. So go
ahead and introduce yourselves
and then get
started.
>> Can you all hear me?
>> Yeah.
>> OK. So good
afternoon mister Chairman
Members of the Committee. Thank you for
allowing us to join you this
afternoon. Uh My
name is Laura Lyn Villalona
and I'm the co Executive
director at New Mexico.
Can we're
a community-based organization
here in Albuquerque that partners
with young people impacted
by foster care, juvenile
justice and or homelessness
to really help
reimagine what systems look
like to better support young people
and families here in New Mexico.
Um Before we
talk a little bit about how
we think that that can happen with
your support. I love
my co presenters to just
quickly introduce
themselves.
>> Hello, my name is Joanna
Delaney and I am
a youth leader with MCAN, as
well as a fellow
with the Jim Casey
initiative.
>> You need to lean
into it because these mics won't
pick it up and
your Yeah.
Ok. Now.
>> Ok. I'm sorry.
My name is Joanna Delaney.
I'm a youth leader here with NM
Can and I'm also a fellow
with the Jim Casey
initiative. >> Great.
Thank
you.
>> Hi, my name is Maria Del
Carmen, but I go by Mia
Cae. I am a
youth leader with N MC A and
a community organizer.
>> Yes. Hello,
everybody. My name is Ya Pending.
Um I'm Dane Hickory
Apache. Um
I am a youth leader with
N MC A. I'm also a
fellow with the Center for Native
American Youth and a local
artist.
Um
I'm queer. I
am here.
Yes, that's all
happy pride, happy pride,
everybody.
>> All right.
>> Thanks everyone.
Um So as I
mentioned, N MA works to
reimagine systems
and how they support young people
and families here in our State. And we
do that through three things.
We do community building
for young people and families
to really kind of promote healing,
learning and growing. We
also do hard and soft skill
development really in
service to kind of
what I mentioned before
is how are we really giving young
people the
platform to really advocate
for the systems that they
have experienced to better support
them and the families that
they have
so
on.
On my slides, I think on the
second one, I think based on the
conversation that we heard from
the legislative finance Committee this
morning. Um I
think we all agree
that the children's
youth and families department is not
best supporting young people and
families in New Mexico right
now. And so I
think when
N MC A has talked
with young people about
how, what are the changes
they want to see? I think
what this data
point is one thing that got
lifted up, right where
74% of
cases for Children
entering out of home care
are for neglect, not
abuse. And I
think we've learned that
we believe the definition
of neglect is really
vague and leaves a
lot of opportunity
to conflate poverty
and neglect in our
State. Um Part
of the definition is on that
slide which I'll read
it for you. Uh
Definition of neglect
can include a child
who is without proper
parental care and control
or substance education,
medical or other care or
control necessary for
the child's well being
because of the faults or
habits of the child's parent
guardian or custodian
or the failure or refusal
of the parent guardian or
custodian when able to do so
to provide for them.
So I just
want us to sit with that
definition because it
doesn't really
differentiate again
between poverty and neglect,
which I think is a problem.
Um That next
slide is how I
think we with young people
have identified what the
difference between neglect
and poverty is and which
I think uh New
Mexico should really help
redefine. You know, we
believe neglect is a State in
which a family can afford to
provide for a child's needs
such as shelter, food,
clothing and hygiene, but
chooses not to
compared to poverty,
which is a State or condition
in which one lacks the financial
resources and
essentials for a
foundational standard of
living. So we truly
believe in order to improve
child welfare, New Mexico
must uh redefine
the definition of
neglect.
We believe that hard working
families unable to make ends
meet truly should not be
criminalized. And family
separation is
not the answer when
families are struggling with
um inaccessible housing,
lack of food in the fridge or
just problems with
childcare.
And so I think for all of you
uh you know, that is
one of the first things
that we think for,
how can we make strides to really
improve our child welfare
system and increase its
effectiveness? I think first and
foremost, clarify and
simplify the definition of neglect
in our children's code. Um
There currently right now is a
children's code task force that
is looking at the
code overall and making
some recommendations which will
include some
recommendations around
neglect. Uh That's
being led by the Cry Wolf Law
Center. And I believe
those recommendations will be
available at the end of this
month. Um
We believe increasing access
to resources for families
and really challenge the social
norms of who deserves
support. Um I
think this speaks to
um one of the questions
that was raised earlier today
is why are participation
rates and programs
not at the national average,
if not higher. And I
think hearing from my co
presenters, you'll hear
why.
And then I think really centering
young people and families in all policy
decisions. Remember, we,
these policies
in practice are
impacting our neighbors,
our aunties, our uncles,
our cousins, people
who have real implications
of family separation, which is
traumatic and truly
should be the last
resort.
And I also believe
that by addressing these
three steps, first and foremost,
you'll also be able
to allow for
CYFD to
work and identify with
families that truly
need significant intervention
around complex support, around
abuse.
And now I want to
kind of uh bring
in my co presenters
for a conversation about some of
these recommendations and their own
reflections on their
experiences.
Y'all
good.
OK.
We
have,
we'll, we'll
um so
I think I wanted to just
ask all of you, you
know, um talk
about the difference that
you've seen between
kind of the neglect and
poverty and whoever
wants to
start.
>> I'll start.
Um
So
like we already
said, the difference
between poverty and neglect
as well, a
parent who is neglecting their
Children is May
or May not be capable of
completely taking care of that
Children. But it's a choice
when you neglect something, it's a
choice. You choose
to ignore that,
that child or
you choose to not feed
them or care for them
properly while
being poverty
stricken. It is, you May
be trying your absolutely
best in working multiple
jobs and have something
happen and then
you go from being able
to make ends meet and not
to make ends meet
and
like a huge
factor like from
what I've seen and how
investigators come into
people's homes and
what they do when they are
investigating, it
goes into a lot about
how they really do.
Look for families that
are stricken by poverty
and they punitive
those families
because those they will
come into your home and
they will open your fridge
and they will turn your lights on
and your water on and make sure
all of those things are working. But
somebody who
is stricken
by poverty, who May
not be able to cover those
bills, their water
might not be turned on because
they might have just lost their job
because they don't have
transportation or such.
And then they get
the Children taken away from
them and then we pay
people to go into those
homes to take the,
remove the Children from
the homes because of
these things. And then
they pay families,
foster families to take
care of the kids rather
than putting
resources into those
parents like
homes, right where they
are so that they don't
have to have removal and
go through that trauma,
traumatic
experience. And
another thing they do is like,
they'll go and pull sheets off
of people's beds and they'll open
the cupboards and they'll check for
like, any little thing they
can to decide
if like this parents
have the funds
available to take care of the
kids is a lot of what I've
seen and heard versus
like, if they're actually
driven to take care of
these kids and want
to, like a lot of the times
when I've seen the difference
personally between
neglect and poverty
is like, poverty isn't something
that's like
in your complete control
while neglect. It's a choice.
It's not something that
you just accidentally
fell into. You're, you're
choosing not to do
that. And that's what
I've seen in my
experience.
>> Um The only thing I
really have to add to that because
Joanna really hit all the points I
could think of
is
everything in
the system feels very punitive.
I have, I do not have
Children. I have never experienced
what that feels like on that end. But
I do know my own experience
as a kid in the
system.
Um
I would
lie to investigators
when they would show up
and I would lie to them to protect
my family because I knew my family
was doing the best that they could. At the
time, my dad was
working an
insane amount of hours,
but my mother was very sick.
She has multiple
sclerosis. Um
and she had a lot of mental health issues.
But I knew if I went, my
dad's never around because he's
paying all these bills, working
his butt off. You are
going to take me away from my
family. So I would just
lie and I
know I'm not the only person who's ever
experienced that, but because I would
lie to protect my
family, I
also wasn't given the resources
to make anything better. I
at a very young age had to make the
decision of if I am I
going to stay in poverty
and stay with my family
because this is what I know
or get taken away and be
put with strangers that I have
no idea what's going to happen to me.
And I knew even at a very young
age that speaking up and
being honest about what was going on?
Nothing was gonna, there were no
resources that were going to be given to my
family, nothing was going to be
done to help them.
Um
So I think that's one
of the reasons I continue to work with
N MC and why I come to these
places. And I hope that that makes
sense when we say that like
it is a
ingrained
distrust in the
workers that come. And as an
adult, I understand
that they are not given the
resources to help
us. That's the other side of that,
that the Cyfd
workers,
people in education everywhere
else do not have the resources
to help us and they are also
overwhelmed.
Everything has to be
restructured. Everything has
to be looked at again,
giving CYFD and all
these organizations, more money
isn't going to do anything
unless we look at the culture
of all these places and the steps
that happen in family
separation. And
ideally
before family separation is
even an option. What can we do to
help families in New
Mexico in the first place from
the ground up? Thank
you.
>> Thank you.
Um
Again, my name is Ya.
Pending some of the points I
wanted to
point out with this
question is that
there are constant
barriers everywhere
you look to
accessing resources
of any kind.
Um In my
experience, accessing
or entering into
CYFD at
such a young age, I believe I was
10 or 11.
Um
Those reasonings were because of like
my mom not
being able to like access
resources to help her health.
She was very unwell.
Um She
abused substances. So my
dad um
and my dad passed away when I
was very young. And
so after that, there was a very
steady decline in my mom's
health. Um
chest flipp disc,
nothing went right
ever.
And everywhere we went, her
doctors would
call her a liar.
Uh The resources that
she would ask for
and get frustrated with
after not receiving anything
or any kind of help or sympathy
um created
even more distance between
everything. Um
So there was
no trust at all between the
people that are supposed to be
giving out these
resources.
Um
As I entered CYFD,
I was also called a liar and
told that,
uh, because
I didn't want to be at home because I
was being neglected and
abused and I didn't want
to be there.
Um, I
believe because my mom's white
and she used to be a police
officer with my dad
that she just had
the know how of how to get out of
that situation and
kind of hired her issues to
and mov'e on from that.
Um Unfortunately, I
wasn't listened to until
things got so
bad that
even the police were saying
like, how could this have
gotten so bad? Like
how has
this kid been asking
to not be at home
and how nobody listened
to that plea and
why would a child
ever say
that and not want to be with their
family?
On top of that, I wasn't
given many
routes to like accessing
my native American family. So
I'm teaching myself
now and learning
um
cultural aspects and
traditions that I feel
would have
help me grow much more even
further. Now, if I had those
things when I was younger
um regarding
being in the system and
accessing other resources
like rehab,
like
uh
therapy, these
were things that are supposedly
there for you, but
the outreach and the
uh
wraparound service of
it was not there
at all. So
our cases were
frequently dropped, not
picked back up, never seen
again. And
this continues to happen.
And as my mom is now passed
away now because she continued
to never get those resources.
Um I have less and less
family now
and because of that barrier, I
continue to have more and more
barriers.
Um
I was part of
the fostering connections
program, which is a very
successful and great
program. Um
Recently, there's an Executive order
signing with the Governor
with Riso Casados
and um a
bing representative that I
was invited to. Um
and some of the
points
that
make that program
really great is that
the people working for
you on your
case want to
help you. Do you make a
connection with the young person
and find out what their goals in
life are?
Um
And along with that force, there are
barriers, there are
frequent workers coming in and
out from different departments,
not knowing their own
policy, confusing
their previous policy with the current
policy. Uh
the line
of
uh resources
that are supposed to descend from
the top just does not
happen. So in my
experience now, as an adult,
knowing how
some of these programs are
supposed to work, I have to
advocate for myself so much
more. It's basically
a full time job while I'm
trying to look for a job and also
trying not to continue being
homeless.
Um
Frequently
every single bear you could think of
basically happens. I
can't find a place to live
because I am
jobless, but I have
a housing voucher that I can't
use because I'm jobless
and because my housing
Navigator can't tell me the
correct thing to
the correct information to
use when going in person.
So, these are all things. I'm now
realizing that my parents had to go
through and now because
I continue to be in the systems,
I have to go through it too.
Um,
on top of that,
uh, it's
very obvious there is a
funding issue.
Um,
I've frequently heard from my
caseworkers that
they are overwhelmed with their
caseloads. There
are not enough workers
for hundreds of cases per
worker. Um
They're not supported by their
staff, they probably
need therapy and they're not
going to be given therapy with the
funding that is
given because it is such a hard
job to see
Children hurt
and have to come out of these
stressful traumatic
situations.
Um And
so there's not
one place to
point your finger, right?
Um
It is truly just a
lot of
mixed systems
that are working against each other,
I believe
um in
terms of neglect
versus poverty.
Um This is something
that really needs to be
like opened up in bigger
discussions so that
people can
like
really identify
the main barriers of
like stigma why
Children are entering the system,
how their families are
being disproportionately
taken down
and
uh
why aren't we supporting each other?
Because at this point,
the workers themselves are supposed
to be helping these Children are going to
be the families needing these
resources also,
um And
I feel this goes back to
the perception problem
that Cyfd has
in that you're not supporting
our people. Nobody wants
to be here because there
is funding, but we're not using
it correctly. We're not using our
time correctly
and it's apparent everywhere
you go. Um
And unfortunately, the people doing the
most work
as everybody
here is in front of me, in
addition to that are the people
suffering the most like
me, like my friends
who are being
expelled from U and M
for using their voices
who were
uh
brutalized, they
have concussions,
they have their wrists
slit because the handcuffs,
the zip ties that they are put in were
too tight and cut off
by the police officers and then they have to be
taken to
the emergency
room. Another
person who is a
transgender individual
was
um given a
charge of
concealment of identity because
of their name change and they are
kept two days
in bookings
um while they were
nowhere near the
protests the Majority of
the time. And I bring this
up because of
the general hypocrisy.
I hear in these spaces
of prioritizing
the safety of Children and our
families while we can't
talk about these things within
our own lives,
in our own groups.
And I think that all of us have a
little tie into all
of this and
all these systems are
connected
and
the work that we do now
for Children here
are going to set an amazing
example where we go
throughout the world.
Um So I, I
apologize for bringing up so many different
points. I hope that was
coherent enough for
you and
I hope that we can take some consideration
into a lot of these things. Thank
you.
>> I would like to add
um more
because
going along
the, the, the
our, our CYFD workers
are, are
investigators. They are so
overwhelmed with so many
cases because so
many of those cases are
poverty.
And when we're having
to remove kids
because of poverty, it
overwhelms them. And then
we take Children
unnecessarily, they go through
all that trauma, they go back into
their homes. They need therapy, they
need all these services because
of all the stuff they were put through
through the system
rather than if we supported
the families upfront
with resources to help
them get water, turned on
food, lighting,
stuff like that, that gets kids
taken from their families
in the first place.
And like
in my own experience, I
had CYFD
come to my house multiple
times. And
when I was with the
father of my Children, we
were not good people
together. We should
not have had our Children
in our home together
because we were very
bad together
to when
we were together, we made an
unsafe place for our
Children. But when
the investigators would
come, they would
give a plan real quick,
very fast to
fix the upfront
issues and there was
never any follow-through.
So while we fixed
it in that moment
and this is very
brave of me to say because
that does say a
lot about what
this is a problem
because then they never
come back because they're so
overwhelmed with all these other
cases. When me and him
would fall back into those
same patterns. There was
never any accountability
because it would happen very
quickly and
fix it and then they would
never show back up. They'd
never do any follow
through because
they're so overwhelmed with all
these other cases that they have
to go to and deal
with that like
homes that really needed.
It weren't getting the
attention that they needed
and their families who were
going through these
issues of
poverty had the
support they needed up.
But situations
where me and the
father of my Children
were having those issues
would have been dealt with properly
where we would have had that accountability
and we would have made better
choices a lot
faster. And while
I May be in a better situation
with my Children now, and he's
in a better situation for
himself and we've done
better now. It wasn't
because of the system because there
was no support. There. There
was no investigator
trying to make sure that the
kids followed
through with getting the
support that they needed
because they were
so overwhelmed with cases, they couldn't
even come back to
us. And if that's
how it was for me,
how many other families
that desperately need
help are also
going through the same
thing.
>> Thanks y'all. Um I
have,
I think we've
hit a lot of the
stuff that we wanted to
talk about. Um I
think there is also
an example of some
resources that have
been working
for folks like the child
tax credit. I know Joanna
you had thoughts about that. But
before we shift,
Yasha, anything else
that you wanted to
add
>> in regards to
resources that
have worked?
Um I
went through multiple
transitional living homes very,
very quickly.
I was homeless
for two
years. And then eventually I was
put in a bunch of transitional living homes
that were unsafe.
I felt unsupported.
The story I always tell
is that I did not have a
car, but I really wanted to go to
school. It was like a really big deal for
me to finally go to UN MC
NM. I got registered.
I did everything.
Um and my
workers at my transitional
living homes made
fun of me at like 18
for going to school. Like to
my face would pretty
regularly make
snide comments
about, oh,
like you really think you can go to
colledge and I had no recourse,
right? Like I was living with these people,
they were in charge of me as a
child. Um
But I was very, very lucky
in the sense that
eventually
um I got put
into New Day Family
Services and it
changed my life.
But that is with the caveat
of I was
assigned a worker
who went
above and beyond
in a way that a lot of my peers
did not get the same
support. Um I still
speak to my caseworker
and he's not really a caseworker.
He's a mentor is what they
called him. Um,
now he helped
me stay in school. He helped me
get into, I had a bunch
of health problems. I was very, very sick
for a long time. He helped me get into a
treatment program.
Um He got me into
this EMS
program where they were able to get me a
car and able to get me a driver's
license.
Um He's
helped me get all
these certifications and
even to this day, I still
call him and talk to him.
But I am the exception
to that rule. And I think about that a
lot. I had one
person
out of the 80
billion people I saw for
four years in transitional
living. If I did
not know Sam, if I had
not been lucky enough to have Sam
in my life, my life would
still look very different.
And even now, even
with all of Sam's help, I'm
still behind my peers.
Like I think about that all the time
with people my age, I'm still
behind in so many ways.
Um
But I'm also very, very
lucky because if I did
not have Sam, if I had not been
blessed enough in that way to have
somebody
to this day, even outside
of this program, call me and
see that I'm ok. Do
you need a letter of recommendation?
We can get you this internship, all these
extra things.
Um I would be in a place
very similar to the rest of my
peers that I went
through the system with and that
involves the
same cycle of having to
apply to housing,
having struggle staying in
school, all these other
things.
That's all I got. Thank
you.
>> Um Let's see.
Uh Another
thing I am thinking of
to bring up
um
is
that a lot of
what I'm seeing recently in the
past couple of months, at least, is
that a lot of the
resources that
I'm particularly needing
and other people, I know
that the resources
that they are needing are already
available. Um
And a lot of smaller
community spaces here,
um
The challenge with them is just
not having the knowledge
of like who they are,
where they are.
Um
So, in that way,
you can make community
feel comfortable in those
spaces versus
um some of like the legal
pathways with
programs that we've been
through um
and programs for
our families needing support
with their Children that might
criminalize you for even asking
for help
um
to kind of like pull
this back in a little bit
more.
Um
Some of these resources
that I have been eating for
six months for
so long, um Like
food housing
um was
pretty much taken care of
for about a whole
month.
24 days. The UN
M encampment was up.
Um The protest for
Palestine, everything
that we needed was always
there because the community showed
up. Uh
I was fed, we had
good food. We got
to give the
houseless people coming
by. Empathy
is all they wanted. But what
they got was that and
more, um,
they received medical supplies.
We had an on-call nurse,
we had therapists willing
to spend their time with
us. Um
And if we needed something,
we knew somebody who knew that
person that had that thing.
Um And
because of uh
some of the pushback
on uh
the students interacting
with this encampment,
we no longer have those resources
and we have to work a little bit harder
to make sure that the people
who were benefiting from
these resources can
still benefit.
And that means working through
panels like this talking
about, um
who are the real people needing
these things. Um
I've met so many like
homeless people
recently um
that, you know, today, I'd
say we're family like it's so
weird to have known somebody
only for a month and to feel
so comfortable with them
versus being forced
to see a caseworker
to talk to a cop
and talk to a therapist
over and over about the same
trauma you've already
had that you just have
to bring back up over and over
again.
Um
And so
the reason I'm saying this is
because
um
there's very clear incentive
in a lot of areas
for the purpose
of like getting people the need
to resources that they
need. Um
It's very obvious like
where our energy is
going and into
the wrong places.
Um If these
programs already exist,
it shouldn't be hard for us to
get them rolling in a
bigger way to access
more and more people.
And because of
our connections here in this room,
we can definitely make that happen,
especially with
um artists
of New Mexico,
getting people
involved in
um
in school, protecting
their schooling rights,
protecting their
family rights,
family paid
leave, which was unfortunately
denied recently.
Um
All these things can
be incorporated
and already are, but
when it's
um
forced it
for some reason becomes
problematic. Um And
so, yeah, I am rambling
and that, that's all I
have.
>> I wanted to
talk a little bit about like
my experience in
foster care and
like how I
got there
and kind of like,
again, try to
like
bring how
overwhelming this
system with
unnecessary
things rather than
supporting families was
very like a critical
part for my life. Because
when I was a child, I had
very abusive parents
and I'm talking like
I could, I and I should have
went to the hospital several
times and my parents just didn't
take me and when
investigators would come into
my home, they would never
come back.
And a lot of the times I
tried to like not
talk about this or like,
remember things about my
childhood because it's just
so hard for me.
But when
I finally was taken
into care, it wasn't until
I was 17, I went
through so many
years of
being
mistreated
because these
caseworkers
would visit
with us for very
short periods of time
and they would never come
back.
And it
wasn't until I was 17
where like the situation was
absolutely
like at that point, it
was miserable.
And we all of
us left in my family,
we had seven siblings in
the house
and
there was only like four of us
left and we made the decision
to call for help
and we finally got it
because our parents
weren't home
and we finally got
somebody out there to actually
talk to
us. And when we
got removed, I
remember sitting in
one of the CYFD
offices
and looking at like they had
like this white board with a
bunch of different things and
it had a bunch of like acronyms
that as a child, I didn't know what
they were but
that she had so many
cases and so many
Children on that board, the
whole white board was
filled with so
many different cases.
And I got maybe
like the whole time
I was in care for that entire
year. She
herself as my
worker only had
maybe an hour of
full time for
that whole year. I was in care
to actually spend time
with me because there was
just so many cases
that she had to
go through and so many
people that she was having
to work with
and she just
didn't have the support and
eventually she
worked there for two
years before she quit
because she was so overwhelmed.
She had a mental
breakdown
and had to
leave because
there was not support for
her. There's not support for
these. And,
and I just wanted
to uplift that because it
talking about this made
me like, really have to remember
that and remember
that I've seen how
they put up the
cases that they have so
they can visually see
how many and
there was at least 20
cases on there
and there was at least 50
kids between all
of them and it was
just overwhelming for
her. And
then I
felt that
during that time of my
life and
definitely like way
before that because
by the time they actually
took us out of our home, we
had had probably like
18 calls to
our home from the time
that I was four years old
to 17.
And when I was 14, I was
taken out temporarily
and put back
in there
because of
other things that didn't even
involve what was happening with our
family. But what, what was
happening at the
um
we were placed in a group
home because we were all
teenagers and things that
happened at that group home
got us replaced
into our home and
we never got the
complete support we
needed to get us out
of that situation
where we were being
like horrifically
abused. And it
was because she was
so overwhelmed,
they're all so overwhelmed
with cases. And
I don't think we think
enough about how many
kids that they have to
work towards helping
and the situations
each one of them is unique
and like
supporting each
family. It
will help us be able
to weed out what is
important and
what is something that we can
support so
that we don't have
to remove kids unnecessarily
while kids who desperately
need to be removed
can get that support to
be removed so that they're not
setting in homes that
are not being take, not
taking care of them for years
before they get that
support.
>> Do you have anything else y'all?
Ok. You stand for questions.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair. So
I I need some clarification
on the data that you have here
because I'm
trying to figure out where you're
going and what you're asking for because I
got a lot of different stories
and I'm very sorry to the
young lady right there about your
abusive situation that
you had to go through in life.
But you're asking us to
clarify the
children's clo code and
ask for resources.
So in the children's code, it
doesn't address poverty.
It talks about and let me pull it up.
It talks about exactly
what
we it 32
A dash 42 talks
about a neg neglected child
and that's where the parents is not giving them
education medicine,
they're physically or sexually
abused or unable to
take care of the child
in any way. It doesn't talk about
poverty. So where
does poverty tie into
this? Do you want poverty
listed in here? Because that
isn't why Children are taken out
of the homes? And
also what are your statistics?
Can you tell them exactly
if you're saying 74%
of Children are taken out of neglect and
neglect is very serious
and Children are abused. Tell
me how many Children
statistically that you can show
me have been removed from a
home purely due to
poverty. Nothing
else.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative Lord.
Um So I think
your point is
exactly the one that I think we're
trying to emphasize is that
I think because of
the confusion around the definition
of neglect, it
leaves those
investigators open
to personal discretion
to determine if there is no food
in the fridge. If there is unstable
housing. >> Mr. Chair,
I don't see that listed in the, it
doesn't list that it doesn't
say no food, no electricity.
That's not specifically listed.
It is that the
parent is intentionally not
giving the child the education
medical care or the child was physically
or sexually abused in 32
8. Show me where it says
that they're going to remove the because there's
not enough food or electricity
purely
that >> so what I would
reference is the Cry
Wolf Children's Law Center has
put together a report that's on
their website that talks about
the need to disentangle poverty
versus neglect where
they've done some research
around
how
and how New Mexico
defines neglect
in our children's code and how
other states have taken action
to ensure that we are not
separating families by
poverty.
>> So
sorry, Mr. Chair. Um, an
expert, I don't see what
I'm I'm saying is I don't see that
in here. I don't, it's very
specific. The
person is willfully
neglecting the child
education medical
care. The child is physically or
sexually abused. Do
you have stats that you can hand me
right now? That
says out of all the
Children they're mov'e because we're the worst.
We're sorry. Second worst.
We don't remove Children out of the
household when we should. I mean, we're
getting kids that are traumatized and tortured
to death. So can
you show me a stat that says
out of all these people that moved for
the home X
amount were only for
poverty reasons.
That's all I want to
know.
>> So I would
refer so
while I can't give you a
specific stat, I can't
answer that question. But what
I will say is the young
people that NM can supports
through our programs.
While you're,
while you're hearing from three
young people who have three very
distinct experiences.
We also have young people
who have said that they have been
removed from their families
because there was not stable
housing because there was
not child care in the home, there
was not food in the fridge.
And so while data
is one thing I think lived
experience from the young people that we
support is quite another. Thank
you, >> Mr. Speaker, Mr.
Chair. I'm not saying that's
not what I'm saying. I'm just going
to close and say our
stats show that we're the lowest,
one of the lowest in the nations
for not having proper
housing. So that seems to go different
from what you're saying. What I need from you
is stats if you want
support and I need
to see the numbers, not
Anna Dole, I need to see those exact
numbers. Thank you.
>> I think another thing
is that the
way Cyfd
actually runs
how they investigate
is very different than what the
code actually says.
Like firsthand,
when Cyfd
comes into a
family home, the first thing
they do is check the lights,
the water, they check
the fridge. Those are the
first things they
do and then they
address what
the investigation
actually says
before they really do anything.
So they're
intentionally checking
for things that
are signs
of poverty. When they
walk in, it May not be
on the code and they
don't always remove Children
based off of the code.
So while it May say that in
there, they could just simply
say, oh, the Children are being
neglected because they don't have
running water in the home.
And I've seen that firsthand
with other people as well
where people have had to fight for their
kids to get them back simply
because they lost their
job and couldn't afford to pay
their bills. And Cyfd came
in and took their Children
because they couldn't pay those bills
and they didn't have those lights
in the water running. It's
not, it's
something like it would have to
be on Cyf Ded
to actually show
why they are removing the
Children from the home.
And if it's something that can
be fixed versus something
that is actually
neglectful. And
that's what we're
talking about. >> Right. And that's
what I'm asking for the exact
specific numbers to help you
guys. So I know exactly
the numbers from CFD that
are actually taking them out just purely
on poverty. I can't go by on
just what people say. I have to go by
stats and science. Thank you.
>> And I think we are going to get
the, um
report from the Children's Law
Center, the task force
that's working on
rewording the
Children. So we'll, we'll be able to
see how
that differs from what we have
now. And that might be
uh one way to avoid the
interpretation because what's going
on now is an interpretation
of this language that May
not say poverty,
but that makes
decisions that are due
to poverty
>> in a reminder. Three
minutes. II, I
can turn your mics off. I
haven't done it yet, but I'm
itching to. So
just try
me
>> well. Yeah. And, and
we, we're actually in pretty good
shape, Timewise. So
uh uh Representative
Chavez followed by
um uh Kate
Thompson and
Vincent.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I want to
say thank to thank you
for coming and, and
making the presentation.
Um My question was
kind of along the lines of
Representative Lord and I'm
looking forward to
um receiving the report.
I didn't know that there was a report.
Um But I definitely want to look
at that and, and take a look at
it. The other thing
is that I
worked at
um, CYFD
as ac ps worker
before it was CYFD.
I lived in 91. So it
was, it was a while back.
Right. But I can attest
to the fact that kids
were removed from homes
due to poverty.
So it's something that
happens and
Cyfd probably doesn't
have that data. They
probably identify it as
neglect. So it's going to
be really hard to tell, right?
But it happened
and I'm sure that it continues to
happen. So thank you for
sharing
and keep up the good
work.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and, and
thank you presenters.
Thank you very much for
sharing your stories.
And um
uh I think
they most certainly have made
a impact on this Committee
and I want to tell you
how grateful I am for
them. Um I
wanted to ask a few questions
just so that we can clarify to
be able to help.
So you're saying let's change
the chi the children's code
because there's an
implication and I'm sure
it happens where
uh Children are being removed
because of poverty.
But what I
want are you
testifying is you believe
that there's a process in
place from CYFD
that there's no water,
there's no food, we remove
the kids, there's not
steps in between
them. Like let's
ensure they have access
to income support.
Have they have we
put them into job
development, have
we done. So,
are you saying there's that
I'm trying to figure out if
Cyfd
either doesn't have all
those steps
that you have to go
through. Once you see
that the lights are on, people
have to do environmental
um inspections which means
to see if there's water and there's
food in the refrigerator.
But if there
are steps in
between that before
there is a removal
or they going right
to the removal
And if there are steps,
are they ignoring those
steps or they're not following
up with those steps as in like
re re
classifying,
that's what I'm trying
to figure out is if you, we
need to go to CYFD
and say we need a
process improvement
or we need an accountability
to follow a process we
know is already there and
you're not following it, you're
going right in no water, you're
out and you're absolutely
right. I mean, as a child
growing up, I, if
Cyfd came to our house,
we would have been removed many
times because there were electricity
or gas or something turned off
periodically. And
so, um, so
that, that's what I want to find
out what your
experience has
been.
>> So, every single time
Cyfd has ever come to
my home because they have to
follow up on any report,
any of them.
It's always,
they always start with that
and from
my experience talking to
other youth, they,
if they fail any
one of those, it's like an
automatic, they're trying to
get the kid out of the home
immediately. There's
not like
when I, when they personally
came to my home and they asked
me about my supports and all of
that stuff.
Um because
I did have like,
I had resources
because I was a foster youth.
I was, I had those a
availabilities
through the fostering
connections programs to keep
those lights and everything on.
But then it's like
they, they
moved to remove them
very quickly.
Um
I, when I had
my safety plans put
into place, it was
because like of
the environment
because I, like
I grew up in with very
bad parents and when I went to
foster care, they didn't really teach me
any like life
skills and such. So
I didn't know how to clean, I didn't know how
to like, do those
things. And I, I know that sounds like crazy.
Like a lot of people, you just
clean up, right. But that's,
it's something that a lot, some,
most like people who have
grown up, they're not actually
taught those skills.
So they would
immediately try to remove
my kids. But if I had
like a family member or something
like that, to take the kids
temporarily to fix
it, that's what they tend
to jump to now.
But if you don't have those
family support, they
do immediately try to
take the kids out of the home if
they fail any of those
environmental
checks.
>> Um, what I will speak
to is as an adult. Um
because of my job, I am a
mandated reporter and I
work with other mandated reporters
in the education system that we have
here. Um
Something I learned
through, I'm gonna address a
couple parts of that because II
100% get what you're asking. I
hope I'm sorry that we haven't
been more clear.
Um Is that
we feel like
the conflation of poverty
and neglect is built into
CYFD. It
is not
something
that we can ignore and pretend
that really isn't there.
Um I also
believe that
what we are asking what I hope
you guys keep in mind is
that all of us have had such different
experiences here, but
you can grab any other kid
that's experienced any kind of
system thing and each of them will
have a different story
because Cyfd
and the systems that we have
are
completely disorganized
and dysfunctional. I
should have had
some kind of representative
through like a court hearing
and fighting all these things. I never
had that everyone in my age
cohort did to like
themselves in front of a Judge or
something. I still don't understand
it. I never had that.
Like, I genuinely have no idea
what anyone's ever talking to me about,
about half the same things my
cohort went through.
Um,
but I will say
as a mandated reporter
now and something I've
learned working on the task
force, just the one meeting that I was able
to attend. And
I have also done
this and I know some of the teachers I
work with have also done this
is they feel
like these
kids don't
have any
kind of other recourse. They
don't have access to these
resources, these families don't have
resources. So then
Cyfd gets called, you
see a kid come into school a couple
of times without shoes,
you can only give them shoes and
food however many times until you
feel like you have to make that report
as a mandated reporter.
And then what ends up happening
is that Cyfd does come in
and they do say they have a
process I have spoken to
people. Cyfd is
supposed to have a process in
place, but it goes
back to the fact that
there is no accountability
for these workers. If
I,
I'm lucky enough that I have built
relationships with some of the parents
and families of the students that
I work with. Right at this
point, I know which
of these families,
I wish Cyfd would
snatch their kids and that's like a
terrible thing to say. But I know which
of these families I'm like, these kids
need to be gone and which
of these families I'm like, what they
need is money. What they
need is a job.
But Cyfd has a hard
time differentiating those
things because of the
way the system is set up,
poverty and neglect is conflated.
There is no way
for us to sit here and go. These
caseworkers have hundreds and
hundreds of people that
they should be looking at. They have
these set times and
not also make the
logical conclusion of
these are the checkmarks that you
have to fill out very, very
quickly and then you're on to the next
person. Um I hope
I answered at least some of your
questions. >> Thank
you and, and I apologize.
Um madam Chair
um because I know I've exceeded
by three minutes, I just wanted to
make it. Thank you so
much and, and you were very
articulate. So you did
explain very well.
So, but this would
be my thing. This is not a
change in the
definition.
This is an accountability
for CYFD to follow their
own processes.
So I've, I've seen
and I've run which is
not CYFD but home
visiting programs.
And you do see, oh, there's
possible alcoholism in
the, in the film. So you
have,
how do you refer them?
How do you get them into
a program? Oh,
there's a
lack
of food. How do you get
them for emergency food
right now and then long term for
income support, there's
processes underneath
those findings when
you go through there and,
and, and I do think that
that is uh we
can't do one without the other.
There has to be accountability. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative
Kates. Did you want to
>> say something very quickly, Mr.
Chair and Representative
Kates? I totally agree. I think
it is a both and I think it
is a how do we take a closer
look at the children's code to
really ensure that the charge
of CYFD is
what it should be doing as
well as how do we ensure
that the process of
supporting families and getting them the
resources that they need is happening
as well? Thank
you,
>> Representative Thompson
followed by Representative
>> Vincent. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. So
just looking at this
definition, it
talks about
the child's well-being,
lack of the child
because of the faults
or habits of the
child's parent. That's
a blaming, that's
not, it's not
your fault. You have a mental
illness, it's not, you
know, substance use
disorders are medical
things. Poverty
is, I mean, sometimes
it might be some people's fault
but most of the time it's not.
And so just the wording
of this makes it
very, very
adversarial as
opposed to we want to help
families, we want,
we want, we're gonna blame
you. We're gonna shame you and
I hate that and this
really upsets me.
Um and then
um just to follow
up Mr. Chair a little
bit on Representative
Lord statements,
you know, I will bet my
entire legislative
salary.
Wow.
Yeah, zero.
that no
CYFD case
manager is or
caseworker is going
to write Children removed
because of poverty because
that's discrimination, they're
not going to write it.
So in terms of the data
that Representative Lord is looking
for, it
doesn't exist and
if it does that, that's case
for a lawsuit. So I
think we just have to go
by what we hear
and thank you all. This is,
this is very
brave.
I remember when I was
on the other side of the table,
how terrified I was all the
time, but I
want to thank you
and um and we
we just need to, we need to
change this definition
and take it from a
punishment to more
of a of it's
a helpful thing for families
and kids. So thank you Mr. Chair
>> and that goes back to accountability,
looking over to see what the person's putting
to see if stuff's really happening there or not.
If there is abuse services,
poverty.
>> Very good Representative
Vincent followed by Senator
Tullman.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
I'm I'm thinking that uh
Representative Kate
stole my question,
but I don't know
if I really heard it.
So the
CYFD have
a procedure
that they have to follow.
That's not subjective
that they go
in and take
a kid out of a
home? Is
there a procedure? Have you seen
the procedure? And
how does that look?
>> Uh Thank you, Mr. Chair
and Representative Vincent. Um
So,
well, I can't necessarily
speak to that. Like that is something
that I would recommend
asking Cabinet Secretary
Casados tomorrow afternoon.
Um I can only speak
from the experiences that we've heard from
young people where, you
know, they're going through this
process um
around kind of is
there actual, in fact abuse and
neglect happening in the home?
Um I don't know what that process
necessarily looks like for each
investigator, but
what I also will say is
that I think even
when it comes to
creating safety plans, a lot
of things that I've heard
from young people
and families is that a
resource that's
provided is a
sheet of paper about who
to call or a checklist
to complete,
which in my mind is
not really a resource
provision. Um
That really leads
to a lack
of true engagement with the
family and support.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I was
just gonna say, 00,
go ahead.
>> Um Speaking on that a
little bit. Um from
what I remember of my experiences
as a kid um having
these home visits,
I believe, I remember
the forms that they,
the workers would bring and
basically it would just be like a checklist.
Uh what to, what to look
for. I would say that
these uh
inspections are
inherently biased.
Um especially
in some like specific instances,
I've seen
of
uh CYFD
workers being
transferred from different departments.
So uh
juvenile justice workers
moving to CYFD trying
to protect kids who are
formerly uh
with
maybe like maybe a little
older but like young people who
might be aggressive, who have
other like issues like
anger management, um
juvenile justice stuff.
Um because of like the
difference in training
and um
instant plunge
into the other
work. I believe that
there's not really that
accountability of what
is the right procedure and
what is the understanding of
this specific department
and uh
people under
supervisors.
Um And I've seen this many
times of like young people
being mistreated because
of a misunderstanding
on the co on the
um staff's part to
simply not knowing what the in
correct information is or
who to get the information
from. Um
And yeah, definitely
using their own bias of
what they, they think they know is like
right for a child versus
what the child is telling
them they need
and want.
>> Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chair. I just
feel like poverty might be
subjective
where some people might, it
might look like they're in
poverty. They're
actually rich
and some people that are rich might
even be in poverty. So, I, I
just, I think it's
subjective and there should be a
procedure
that, uh, whenever
you're gonna remove a kid from a
home, there should be,
they should hit all those
different uh, benchmarks.
Thank you.
>> And I could, I could personally
talk about like
the, whenever they come
into your home, they have like a
sheet of paper, they can
deal with the caseworker's
information and
a list of resources. And
when you ask for any
resources or stuff, they
just point out that
paper, like it's supposed
to be helpful in
any way. Like there are people
who have disabilities
or, or like
mental health issues
that they can't actually access
these resources and
it's also very difficult to get
into those resources in the
first place.
Like when I
tried to entertain, if it's
like a very long
process, they ask a lot
of information and even if
you do, like, one thing that they don't
like, they're going to
take those resources away
from you. So it's a
very, like, they
don't really support
the families or try to actually
help the families or even give
them a work,
like a worker
to try to help them
get to the, like
the families get to those
resources in the first place. It's
just like you,
you want your kids, you're gonna do
this. That's, that's about
the the level of
care they actually put into
the investigations
in my
experience.
>> Representative
Thompson. Oh,
no, I'm sorry, Tallman
II, I couldn't
read my own writing. Thalman.
Not Thompson.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you everyone for being
here.
Did a good job of explaining
the situation. Very compelling
testimony.
It seems like a dirty
shame to have to take
kids out
of a home because of
poverty, even though the parents
May be good parents, but
they just don't have enough
fund.
So
the Cyfd
before a child is ever
removed from
a home, does CF
DC YFD
make an effort to
connect the family to
sources to be a nonprofit
or a church or
some source
to help
them
be able to afford
the proper care
of their Children.
Does that ever
happen? Or is Cyfd
compelled? Are
they supposed to do that or it
was because they're so overwhelmed, they
don't have the time to do
that. You see what I'm getting at?
Why? It seems like a
dirty shame they have to take you out
even though maybe
if they connect someone,
connect to a church or
nonprofit to help
the family
financially.
>> Um, what I will speak
to is that
it really depends on the
caseworker
and the extent that they're willing
to do all those things.
Um I mentioned earlier
my own experience like in
the system, I
have gone even as an
adult, I kind of keep track
of it because I think it's funny, I've had 13
caseworkers.
Um,
I think I can name
two of these women that have
actually gone out of
their way to spend time
with me and get me the
resources that I've needed.
That wasn't just, here's a
sheet of paper and
call
and I imagine that
is what families also
have to go through to the same extent.
These people are overworked.
They do not have the time. And
quite frankly, something that I
feel really passionate
about is that we
do not pay our workers
enough to do
the job that they are paid to
do. This is a very hard
job going in and
building that emotional rapport
with families is
draining, building an emotional
report with a kid, even if you love
kids is so draining.
And on top of that, you are sent
to homes where
you are having to decide
basically, is
this neglect because
these people should not have
their Children or is
this a systemic
failure of we have
not helped these people thrive
to be fully formed people.
Um And at least from
what I've seen now as an adult
and like my professional
career, it
really just depends on the
caseworker. It depends
on how much work
you want to take
home to do
things for your kids.
How much are you willing to do
outside of your work
hours to make
sure that the people you're assigned
to essentially helping
live,
how much can you really take
home? And I'm very
lucky in the sense that I don't really
work with families directly,
directly anymore. I work with
kids. But even then, like, I'm
still taking
so much home
all the time
and I've had to really step
back and
as awful as it
is, decide how
much of that can I
really do as
one person on a systemic
level. So
I think what we keep kind
of circling around is like
our answers are going to be.
It depends because
Cyfd, as much as they
say that they have a protocol and a
procedure,
everything is so
subjective. I've
had to make Cyfd calls
the last couple of months of school
for kids, not having
shoes
and some of those families
are fully because I think
those kids should be taken away.
And I'm furious that Cyfd
has not stepped in to help some
of those kids. And then some of
those calls that I made are purely
because I'm like somebody help
these people find a
job and
those are really the steps that we
have and the recourse that we
have as mandated
reporters in the State. I
feel like,
>> thank you for that.
That's all I
have.
>> Another thing
is
not all of the
community
around you
to be able to
get you to those
resources and you can end up
in this cycle of
like needing
resources, but they don't
even know where to go most of
the time to get the family
help.
>> Just a quick question
before we go to Representative
Ferrari and then Senator
Pinto Mia, where,
where do you work? Are you at
a community school, community
school coordinator or something like
that? >> Um
I am a manager
with a parks and rec program here,
but I'm going to school to be a
community school
worker. It's something
that I'm passionate about. Um
I'm not sure it's something I want to do long
term. But with the job that I
currently have outside of my
internship, um I'm
at a community school and it's a need
that I saw
right away, I
guess. And with
like my background and everything
else, it was sort of just like, oh, this
seems like a very logical next
step in my
entire
life,
>> Representative Ferrari
and then Senator Pinto,
>> thank you, Mr. Chair and
thank you panel. It's been
most enlightening
and
things that we
need to hear to be
able to
relate to what needs
to happen
in Las Cruces.
We're having
a pilot
program for
guaranteed
family income
and I think
for addressing
some of the
um hardships
and, and
things that people need,
like if they need a little
bit of extra money
um each month for
their rent or if
they have an emergency come
up for their vehicle
to be repaired, they
would have that money
and it's been really
successful and
I think it's something that we should
consider
um in
our State
across the board.
And if we could
prevent families from
having
um
to give up their
Children, like it was pointed
out and spending that
funding on foster care
to be able to have that
guaranteed income
to help make ends
meet and to pick
up the um
you wanted to say something, go
ahead. >> Oh, yeah, I
talk about this a lot
but like the difference between like
TANF where you have to go through
all these different barriers.
And when we got the child tax
credit, when I
finally decided to leave
the father of my Children, I'm
struggling a lot financially.
And then when the child tax credit
hit during the pandemic,
that money was
monumentally
saved me and my family
from having to continue
to be around our
abuser for
us and having
to put him on child
support, which very much
angered him any time
it was even mentioned to
him. So having that
support during that is something
I've talked about a lot
with MCAN about like
how the difference
between like
having that month to month income
versus TF for like the
moment you get a job you lose.
It was so
helpful because instead
of having to go to him to
ask for help, for
clothes and
medicine and all this stuff,
it was just, I had the money to do
it myself because
it was just there. So
that was something that like
when you said that it just reminded
me of the child tax credit
and how helpful that was.
And I've heard from so many different
parents that also got
that tax credit that it
was like, it saved them
from being like
having to decide versus
food versus clothes for their
kids.
>> And, and
unlike the child tax
credit, this would be something that
the family could depend
on each month.
But having an
increased child tax
credit and something that we
institutionalized
in our State
government would be a really
good idea to have
both and then
to make it so that, you
know, they would have money
for in this
circle um
that you have for the
jobs don't pay enough
living wage. To help
with that, to help with childcare.
If the car breaks
down all
of those things, I think we need to
consider and
support in
this next legislative
Session. Thank
you,
>> Representative
Ferrari. Thank you. So,
Senator Pinto, followed by
Senator Lopez. >> Thank
you, Mr., Chair Members of the Committee
and thank you for your presentation.
Um And this is more just a
yes or no question for each
of you. Did anybody ever
ask you after
um come to you and
ask you about the
system?
>> No, I, I went
to in mcan because
I
had a caseworker
who wanted to connect me before
he was ultimately retiring.
That was the only time anybody ever
started asking about my
experience with the system
and in the
system,
>> um I began
um this sort of
advocacy
>> during but no
one from CYFD
actually came and asked you
after,
>> after, I'm sorry, can you
clarify >> you were out of
the system in that
sense?
>> No, nobody from my past,
some people from fostering
connections did
>> and mister Chair Members of the
Committee in order for
us to collect
data or even kind of do
any analysis is
that the outcomes need to be
evaluated.
And my understanding is we
probably just barely what
in April
actually contracted with
Redmain technology
to have
a welfare information
system.
So I hope you're
you're asked to
participate
because when
my, my experience is
that in clients
or people that were actually
involved or were students
of a school, um,
are probably the best people
to put into
those areas
and advocate because they,
they'll, they'll do the work.
Um, and, and know what that,
that's there.
So I think we're a little
behind on the curve.
Um, but I hope it, it
does change. Thank
you for your stories and your
presentation and
I hope that we can mov'e it
faster than, uh, and catch
up with what we need to
do. Um Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator Pinto,
Senator Lopez.
>> Thank you very much, Mister
Chair and just for
information, I think
that compliments a
comment that you made and that
has been made. Mister Chair is
with regards to the issues on the
children's code. There is
a children's code task
force and we are
addressing the issue
to clarify
because everything has to be black and
white. Um with
regards to not
criminalizing what
I call criminalizing poverty
for our families. So
I think we'll be able to give a presentation
to the Committee later on.
Um um
just to give you an idea as
to what will be proposed for the
upcoming not special
but for the 60 day Session coming
in January
>> and just to clarify for me,
the
Senate Memorial five
task force is different
from this one. >> Yes.
Ok. Yes, sir.
>> It would be good to hear from both. >> Will
be for both
>> and anybody
else. I, I
too wanted to thank you for
for sharing,
you know, your own personal stories
from your lives. But also for
the insights that you've been able
to, to give us
into why the system May
not be working as well
as it as it ought to
be. And it strikes me
that one of the big problems that
our system has now
is
um
and, and it goes by different names.
Sometimes people say, oh, we need a
family services division.
That's what the Secretary is
saying. Other
times people say, oh, we need a
differential
response.
But what it amounts to right now
is when the
worker is sent out
after the State
central intake gets a report
that this family is neglecting
their child or abusing
their child.
And they, they,
not every single report
gets investigated, but they,
it met that
threshold and
somebody decided
that we better investigate
this case,
that the investigation
is about whether or not
to remove the
child.
And it really should be
a different criterion.
Totally, it should be.
What help does this
family need
and, and take away the,
the, the, the threat
of removing, we're here to
take away your child if you're not doing
a good job, but we're here
to see what kind of services we
can put you in touch with.
And it would be only after they
failed to avail themselves
of services that
they failed to do
anything for
their kids, that the issue
of removing the kids would even
come up. But if that's
the first contact that
the family has with the
CYFD worker,
we're here to see if we need to
remove your kid
that just immediately puts things
on the wrong footing. That's why
kids have to lie. That's why
families have to hide or
mov'e over in the
dead of the night. That's
why all this stuff happens
because we've only given that
worker that option of,
do we remove the child or
not? Instead
of, of the services
they need? Which ones can we get
them ourselves? And which
ones can we put them in touch
with? And then only
if the family doesn't
avail themselves,
would we step in and even
talk about removing the
child?
But
that's, you know, that's
another. No,
if it's, if it's severe abuse
and it's obvious that's a different
matter, but in case of neglect,
it really is such
AAA
fine
line to differentiate
between what's just
poverty, what's really
neglect,
what's of
somebody going through a
postpartum depression?
What's somebody going
through a
trying
to get into alcohol
treatment program? And,
and, and, and
realizing that the only way
they can is if they leave their
job, which then leaves
the family without adequate
resource, all of those
things start getting mixed into
it. And this
shouldn't be part of a decision about
whether or not to remove the child
that that's a different matter
anyhow, that's what I
heard from what you were
saying, that, that, that you'd see
it that way as
well.
Oh, and then yeah, the
question came up. We
were curious, where does
NM can get
funded?
Your, your extravagant
budget? Where does that all those
millions? Where do they all come
from? >> I
thank you, Mr.
Chair.
And um so
NM can, our budget
is formed largely
through a combination of private
foundations, a couple
of government grants, corporate
uh grants
and then individuals. Um
governmentwise, we
receive um a
little bit of funding through the
children's trust fund,
which I believe you're hearing with
tomorrow um
through VCA as
well as
um the
city of Albuquerque.
So we have
those three
funding streams right now.
And then also
a lot of the
supporting young people to
engage in the Children's Court
Improvement Commission
and other
advocacy spaces to
ensure that lived experience is
lifted up. And those things, we
have a contract with the administration
of the courts.
>> You don't have a contract with
CFD to serve
kids aging out of foster
care.
>> Mr. Chair. That is
correct.
>> It seems like you should have a
contract with CD
to serve kids aging out of
foster care. But
>> they're cutting the,
aren't they cutting the funding for
kids transitioning
out? You have to I thought I heard
that. >> Mm I
don't think so.
They just announced the,
the uh
the city just
dedicated
a new hotel
dedicated to, to
adolescents, homeless
adolescents, which
I, I don't know if you've all been
involved in that, but it sounded like a
pretty good step. Do you think it is?
It sounded
like?
Ok. Well, I,
I just want to thank you for
coming and for
presenting
and uh please,
anytime you have something you
want to bring to our attention,
the public comment period would
always be available even
if we don't have you formally on
the agenda.
Thank you so much for
coming.
We, we
concluded our, our agenda.
I wanted to take a couple of minutes to
make a couple of additional
comments.
One Zander
reminds me that on
Friday in
this very room,
right
in this very
room right after
we finish about an hour after we
finish, um,
the office of the Superintendent
of insurance is going to have a
public town hall
or public hearing
on an issue
of great interest to
us
oversight. What would it
take for the State to begin
developing oversight
over hospital
and health care clinic,
mergers and
acquisitions and
you know, all of that
stuff. So that might
be something to pencil in.
Hang around another.
I know you don't have very far to go
to get home. So you don't, you
don't mind staying
around,
you can fly to
Deming.
Oh, to Silver City.
Oh yeah, that's good. That's
good.
Um Then other,
other issue is I would
like to, to say
we, we end each day,
tomorrow will end around four.
Today. We ended at three.
We end pretty early on
Friday. We don't
have as we did in the last few
years, have
scheduled a
formal
brainstorming Session,
but I did want to offer
Members an opportunity
to, to use these few
minutes if you want to take a few minutes
now to bring up any
issues or we could
do it tomorrow after the Session.
Or Friday after the Session,
any issuess that you want to
identify for the
Committee as, as
needing
attention from us,
things that you heard
or that and it didn't have to be
things that you heard during today,
things that you May have brought with
you that, you know, you
wanted to get them into our work
plan and
darn it, we, we didn't include
them, but you think it's still
important, bring those
up so we can have that
discussion.
Um And as we're
talking about the work plan, you'll
notice that our
work. If you go to the,
the
website for our Committee
and draw up a work plan as I
did earlier this week
and look at it, I realize
this is last year's work
plan and
the meetings are last year's
meetings.
We have not had
legislative council approval
of our work plan yet.
That's the dilemma.
And so until
that happens, they can't post it
officially,
but hopefully
that'll happen, June
24th,
24th, something like
that. Um So
hopefully it'll be up there. But then,
but we're still operating on,
on, on, on what we had
adopted. We
don't think they're gonna make any changes.
So we will plan on having
our July meeting house
and, and then proceed
from there with the, with the topics
that we have identified.
Anything anybody wants to bring
to our attention that we by
gosh, ought to start taking
a look at in this Committee or we're
wasting our time. Senator
Pinto.
>> Thank you, Mr., Chair Members of
the Committee.
One of the things I'm
curious about is
the
eyeglasses
for our Children. Yes,
because of the technology
now, it seems like
there's a gap of some
of our kiddos. They
do get an eye exam
but they don't get their glasses till
like the middle of the year or
something. It's just
the process. I don't know if it's
insurance. I'm not sure.
Um, especially my
role, it seems like
my urban schools, they're
ok. But
when you get out of the urban
area, it, it
are, it becomes
a
appeal. >> Is that through
Medicaid or we're talking >> about?
I, I know I'm not sure
why it takes so
long
and is that
>> we, we, we have to bring
to the attention, make sure that
we get that in the notes and bring that to
the attention of the Medicaid
division. Yeah,
because I mean these,
this new turquoise care
plan that starts at the end
of the month, that's
going to have some real advantages.
But one of the things we want to make sure
is that things don't fall through the
cracks like this
here in and
they'll be in Taos, we can
bring it up then
too,
if not before,
is everybody going to be able to make
to
planning on
it?
It's the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of
July and then you can stay over and
have fourth of July at the Red
River to or
Angel Fire or
CPAP.
I understood >> everything you just
said,
>> Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you. I was just thinking that
because we're going to have Cyfd,
the cabinet Secretary
here. Is it tomorrow
that maybe once we
hear from her,
um you know, we May have
some other ideas as to
what we want to put in the plan
because she May have some answers.
We May still not have any
or whatever it May be, but
that'll kind of set the tone.
Thank you. >> I'm glad
you brought that up. We, we had originally
thought we'd hear from her first
today. Her
schedule was such that it, that
wasn't going to work. And I,
but I think it works better this way
actually that we have a lot
of background
information from,
uh,
from the
LFC, from the
UN M Child.
Uh,
what was the
child, whatever it
is, child abuse
resource team, uh
from
um uh
the Casas from
N MCAN. Then
tomorrow morning, we'll hear from
Annie Casey Foundation.
We'll hear from all
faiths Child Advocacy
Center. We'll hear from the
Children's Trust fund
and then we'll hear from
CYFD and we should
have a wealth
of issues to bring to her
attention.
>> Thank you mister Chair
and I reserve
the right once the plan
has been published to be
able to revisit your
question of things
we need to add or
a tweak to the plan.
But I
two things
have come to me. One is just a
simple, a
letter of support
for the
nurses for
Sandoval Regional Medical
Center. I think a letter for support
from this Committee is
very important. I know that they've
spent some
time
speaking with
some of our
leadership.
And so I would like
consideration for that. And if
you would like to have more information
about it, you're going to give me a little time. I
can do that. And the
other is one of the
consistent themes
that have gone through this
Committee.
And uh
I, I am
ready in detail
to
address in detail, like,
like we're gonna do tomorrow probably with
CYFD
is,
um,
why do we bother
having an RP for our
MC OS when we don't hold
them accountable for
anything? And
I have a whole list of
things that they're supposed
to be doing and Medicaid
will not
do them. Medicaid
will not allow me to
bring things to
appropriations
because
they're like, oh, the MS are
supposed to be doing them and they're not
doing them and we can show that
they have not been doing them for
years. It's not one
particular MCO,
it is our process,
our failure in our
process. And if
this is not a legislative issue,
I don't know, what is
that, is what the legislature's
supposed to be looking at is the
failures of processes
to be able to create
accountability in our
policies.
And
I am
tired of hearing that. Oh,
that's the M's
issue. And I, I think
that deserves some time on this
agenda. Respectfully,
Mister Chair and vice
Chair.
>> Good point.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair. In terms
of the, it's not just the
nurses. Um I've met
with um uh
radio te
radiology techs
and uh social workers
and folks and
it's things are
not great out there
and they now,
according to
the people I met with, they
got ad from the
from C MS.
According to Senator
Hickey, they got an F
um, so either way
it's not a good thing. So,
and then II, I
agree with Representative
Kate in terms of, and
I asked this question, I believe
at the last meeting when
we're giving someone a
contract, why do
we have to negotiate
with them? Benchmarks?
Are we'll give you the
money? This is what
you do. There's no
negotiation when
I hire, you
know,
when I get hired as a physical
therapist, I don't, you know, I say,
oh, well, you know, I'm, I'll,
I'll do it, but I'm
not going to do this one and I'm
not going to do that one. No,
you're hiring me and you tell
me what I'm gonna do and that's what
I feel like we have
with, with the
HM OS is we're
hiring them and then we're letting
them set the terms of their
contract. Um,
you know, yeah, I'll clean your
house but I won't mop
or I won't do windows or I
won't sweep. I
won't clean the
bathroom and I won't, I
won't, well, you're not going to hire
them. So we should do the same thing
with MC. >> Well, thank
you. And this is only our third
meeting chairs,
but we had a presentation
from Medicaid who
I don't know how you felt about
those slides. But I
said, why aren't we
getting data that
says this is what's in the
RP? And
this is how they're hitting that.
We already have an RP
in place that shows what
our goals, what our requirements
are. So why is
not the report given?
And so it's reflective of that
so we can see whether or not
they're hitting their RP.
>> Mr. Chair, the
LFC does their
report cards and that's
where they get to negotiate,
you know, 50% of the
time we serve people with
behavioral health conditions.
No, 100%
of the time. It's
uh yeah, I think that's
really been a downfall
for us. And as
you said, last time, Mr.
Chair, a moneymaker
for the hmos
>> when we first started managed
care, I think they
treated them very genteelly
because we didn't want to antagonize
them because we didn't know how long they'd want
to do this. They're
all eager to do it. Now
they make so much money off of these
contracts. There's no dearth
of applicants who want these
contracts. Representative
Chavez, >> thank you, Mister Chair.
I think the bigger question for me
anyway, is
really looking at
whether or not we
should continue
um contracts
with the NC OS, you know,
should we go back to the
way that it was before
when the State
managed the Medicaid
program? Totally
Connecticut has gone
back to that and, and they've
been very successful with it. So I think
that's something that we really need to think
about.
>> Security.
One.
I, I just have an
announcement. So I
um now my
brain is blanking on the
young man who worked with us
on the amputation.
The, the prostate
Kyle, I ran
into him last night at a watch
party and he said
eight other states or
maybe seven other states
have followed New Mexico's
lead in passing that
Legislation. So,
so we're a national leader
on
that.
>> Any other issues people want
to identify and bring
up.
It'll be rainy
in the afternoons, but
windy in the morning,
>> snow
expected.
>> You're trying to decide whether to ride
a motorcycle. Yeah. Oh,
good, good.
Just, just bring
one of those rollup ponchos
with you and you'll be fine.
That's good.
All right. Anything
else Members? Thank you
for your, your work today. Then
we'll see you at nine in the
morning
for the Annie Casey presentation.
