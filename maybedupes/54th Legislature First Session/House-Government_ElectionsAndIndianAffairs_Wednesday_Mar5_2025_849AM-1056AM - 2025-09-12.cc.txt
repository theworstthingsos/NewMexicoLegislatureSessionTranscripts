Uh, groups
In this bill
And just do it in Santa Fe
County.
Seems to me like the this bill
still needs a little work. What
do you, what do you think, Madam
Chair Representative?
Madam Chair Representative.
Um, it could take a little work.
My intent though is to correct
what happened in 2020.
It wasn't to open up the whole.
can of worms, so to speak on
this issue it was to fix what
happened in the 2nd session of
2020 with house.
House Bill 117.
And, and, and Madam Chair.
And representative, I have some
mixed emotions about supporting
it because
Our duty especially as
representatives we need to
understand.
So, everybody can, all these.
People can survive all these
government entities, the city,
the county.
And
I just think the bill needs some
work. I think there's a lot of
issues with this bill.
Uh, I'll, I'll in the, in my
discussion there, and I look
forward to the rest of the
debate and see where we go from
here.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative.
Representative Lujan.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
I don't, Madam chair, um.
Representative
So the FIR in front of her
doesn't capture your.
Um, amendments, does it?
Thank you.
I think that's a concern for me,
Madam Chair, that we're
reviewing a bill that, that's
been amended, but in the FIR
doesn't.
Capture those amendments.
Um
It gives some uh and
specifically when you're, we're
looking at the exemptions that
are modified.
Um
The the occupancy tax shall not
apply if even D has been a
permanent resident of the
taxable premises for a period of
at least 30 consecutive days
unless those premises are
temporary lodging or enters into
written agreement for lodgers as
they were, I think we need to.
I said unless those premises are
temporarily.
I think, I think we need to
consider that as we're talking
or discussing this bill, Madam
Chair. Also, I'd like to, um, a
question for the
Um
Representative Lindstrom is
So
Prior to 2020 this was already
this was in place is that
correct, Madam Chair?
I'm sure Representative, yes, it
was. It's always been in place
except for the last few years.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So this
is something that's already been
in place, um.
I don't believe there's ever
been any record of any kind of
abuse or um concern of
corruption, Madam Chair.
Madam Chair Representative, no,
there hasn't been and candidly I
don't know
that we've had any of the local
hotels.
I'll talk negatively about this
or the chamber or anybody else.
I've never heard of any and and
hadn't received any comments.
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair. I
really appreciate this. I think
that
We're moving into a place where
we're, we're
We're looking and we should be
looking at significant issues,
but the history, the history of
this is, doesn't exemplify some
of the concerns that I'm reading
about in this FIR which
Concerns me because I am a
representative here in Santa Fe
on along with representatives
Sapansy here and I've never
This has never come up.
For any concern, um, Madam
Chair, um, that, uh, thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Barrago.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
yeah, I was also a little bit
concerned about the comments
that were made in the FIR, um,
Madam Chair, I and
representative by the ethics
commission, but having served on
the lodger's Tax Board in
Albuquerque, um, I realized that
this is really just a benefit.
In, in a sense to help.
You know, people that are
serving their duty.
Um, and we don't get a lot of
perks around here serving in
this position. Um,
So I'm, I mean this, I don't
consider this a perp. I think
it's more like a um.
Like a, a very small benefit.
And the tax on, on that.
For 70 or however, what are we
140 legislators. It doesn't seem
to me like that is a real
significant amount that, you
know, would be going into the
coffers for the lodger's tax, so
I, I support this bill.
Thank you, ma'am.
The representative,
representative ranking member
block.
Madam chair, just a couple of
real quick questions for you.
Uh, so, I just want to make
sure, am I reading the same or
the same substitute as you, mine
ends in 536.1.
Is that OK, great. So I, the
original bill, it said a member
of the legislature and it said
located in the county where the
state capital is, and I, I was
trying to find it. Maybe I am, I
gave up coffee for Lent, so I
apologize, but I'm trying to
find where it says the capital
city or or or Santa Fe and the
bill and does this apply now
general generally to the whole
state, cause I don't really see
that in the the new substitute,
and I'm sure.
Good point, Madam Chair. Yes, it
does, because when you think
about the way this substitute is
drafted, it doesn't just
necessarily. OK, thank you,
Madam Chair Representative. So
it could be for the whole state
potentially if it's a
a state that Gallup, New Mexico,
and you're there for 60 days on
interim committees.
Oh
You won't have to pay for
lodger's tax. Oh, good. OK,
thank you, Madam Chair. That's
pretty much all I, all I had to.
Wonder about this bill. So, I'm
sure the fiscal impact could,
could vary then when it comes to
this I think it could, but, but
when you really think about it,
it's.
I, I believe, Madam Chair, and
I've been here a long time, that
if the fiscal impact was
crippling to
The industry we would hear about
that.
Right. Thank you, Madam Chair.
That's pretty much all I had.
And thank you again,
representative, and I can't wait
to see you in the interim in
Gallup, maybe not for 60 days,
but maybe a week. That'll be
fine. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative.
Before I call the question, I
would like to say that I, uh,
you know, I travel here from
Gallup.
And I have stayed in a hotel for
more than 60 days. And ladies
and gentlemen with our per diem,
I went home in the red.
Every year for many years.
And uh
I did receive the um the
discount on the tax in the past
when I've stayed at a hotel for
30 days and beyond.
And there were no complaints the
cordial and I didn't hear any
complaints from anybody.
So, um, with that
representative, um, I'll call
the question.
Represented Barrigo just wanted
to make a motion for it to pass
House Bill 5.
Or 77.
Oh yeah.
It's on the original bill and a
due pass for the house committee
substitute.
So we have a motion for a do
pass on house government
elections. I do not pass on
house government elections and
Indian affairs.
They do not pass on House Bill
477, and they do have 7 and a
second by Representative Ana
Nonu, please call Ro.
Representative on.
Represented Black
Representative Borego.
Yes, Representative Lujan.
Represented Mejia.
Yes, Madam floor leader.
Uh, Representative Zamora.
Yes, Madam Vice Chair, Madam
Chair.
Man by a vote of 7 to 0, you
have a due pass.
OK, committee members, if you
don't mind, I'd like to um hear
HJR 11 because I see our senator
in the room.
And SJR 11.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I was
just texting the Secretary of
State's office to say I was
gonna have to leave.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you committee members for
the opportunity to present, um,
house drink resolution 11. I do
want to thank my co-sponsors,
um, Senator David Gallegos,
former representative, as well
as representative Gail Armstrong
for supporting this bill, all
three of us are former school
board members, and so this bill,
uh, we recognize as being very
important.
If you look at the bill,
Um, oops, I picked the wrong
one. If you look at the bill,
the only thing that we're taking
out, this is a a constitutional
amendment.
Thank you, Representative.
Is to the eliminate one
sentence, all school elections
shall be held at different times
for from partisan elections.
School board elections,
historically have always been
separate from other elections,
and the reason for this is that
school elections were the only
elections that women were
authorized to vote in.
And so I jokingly say when our
constitution was adopted, um,
and maybe it's true, maybe it's
not, but, um, elections for
school were held at different
times to make sure that we
didn't inadvertently vote for
governor or representative or
senator or something we weren't
allowed to vote for.
So what this does, as you know,
we've taken away um school board
elections from being at a
different time by mixing them in
with the local election.
But local elections, which will
happen this year in November is
just a consolidation of
nonpartisan.
Thank you. um, nonpartisan
elections. The challenge is that
school districts are facing is
that if you have a bond
question.
That you need during a general
election period, you have to do
it as a special election. You
cannot be on the general
election, and that special
election right now Espinola, and
at least 4 other districts,
maybe 5, have to do a special
election because they have a
bond question that timely needs
to be asked.
It's going to cost about
$175,000 for them to do that
bond question because it's all
male.
And because it's separate from a
from a regular election. So for
that reason, we're looking to
strike that. Um, I would like to
give my expert witness an
opportunity to say something,
and then we'll stand for
questions, Madam Chair.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. It's
good to see you all again. Um, I
just wanted to, uh, to say that
we are really grateful for the
sponsor for bringing this
forward. She does an excellent
job explaining um the impact of
the change to the constitution
on school board, um, ballot
questions and, and school board
elections, but I did just want
to highlight and be very clear
that um the members of a school
board would still be elected at
the regular local election.
and
the change does not compel the
districts to put their ballot
questions on a general election
ballot. So it just gives them
another option, um, which is
already afforded to all of the
other local public bodies in a
regular local election. So
municipalities, water districts,
they can pick between the
regular local elections, special
election, and a general election
ballot, um, um, and, and
consider those as
Options for their ballot
questions, school boards are the
only ones that cannot put them
on the general election ballot
currently. So this change to the
constitution would bring them in
alignment with the rest of the.
We should stand for questions,
madam.
You, Senator. OK, let's go to
the audience. Do we have any
comments and support?
we have any opposition?
Let's go online.
And hoping to take comments and
support here. Will we have
Richard Mason, Richard, can you
hear us?
Yes, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, good morning. My name
is Dick Mason. I'm the voting
election director for the League
of Women Voters of New Mexico.
The league stands in strong
support of Senate Joint
Resolution 11 based upon the
following league position. The
league supports the
consolidation of elections in
New Mexico. We do so because it
increases voter turnout.
Additionally, when all bond
issues are on the same ballot,
the voters can see all of their
choices in front of them.
Finally, SJR 11, if passed by
the voters will eliminate one of
the last constitutional vestiges
of the dark period when women
did not have full suffrage.
The league wants to thank the
sponsors and the Secretary of
State for bringing this forward
and as the committee to give
SJL1 a due pass. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Richard.
Anyone hoping to make any public
comment in opposition to the
bill, please raise your hand.
committee members.
Zenab Zamora.
Madam Chair, Mova dupe.
I have a motion for do pass by
representative Zamora, second by
representative Onornu. Do we
have any opposition?
Seeing none, how would you pass?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, members of the committee.
Hey, representative Doo, are you
still in the room?
She just
of the chair, she just stepped
out. OK, so let's
let's uh do house bill for 68.
Yeah
OK.
Thank you, Representative Black,
um, and the bill was rolled and
it, um, as I mentioned, um,
being the newbie, you can come
into a room and think you have
the greatest idea in the world
and as it goes through the
committee process, you learn
that it can be made even better
and that's what this committee
did. There were no substantive
change, there are no changes to
to the bill. What it does is it
applies a the same standard to
retire a um a state flag that is
um no longer in shape to be.
Um, flown, um, and retired in
the same manner as the US flag,
um, as I mentioned previously,
this was brought to me, um, by
one of my constituents, Girl
Scout Adrian V Hill of Troop
18044, Girl Scouts of the desert
Southwest, and I believe she's
um has called in in support and
so I, I think I'll leave the
story to her. Um, we've also
been um in close contact with
the of Pueblo and I believe the
governor has also called into.
To talk about uh his support for
this bill, so uh thank you uh.
Um, Madam Chair and committee.
Thank you, Representative. Let's
go online and hear from the
governor if he's available.
Governor Pino, uh, you could, if
you could please raise your
hands so we can hear your public
comment.
Oh, here we go. I think I see
him.
Hi, Governor Pino, can you hear
us?
Uh, can you hear us.
OK. Um, my name is, uh,
Lamberino. I'm the uh appointed
governor from the Polo Zia, um,
When uh we were at
Notified on this, uh, bill, uh,
we went, uh, sat down.
With our,
I sat down with my lieutenant
governor, uh, the tribal
administration and uh my tipple.
So, um, we're in support of the
bill. I just want to thank the
young lady that brought it to
the representatives of
attention.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Governor
Pino.
Mm. And then we also had Adrian
Martinez, Adrian, uh.
Adrian, you?
Hi Adrian, uh, Adrian, can you
hear us?
Go to, um, let's go ahead and go
to public comment in the
audience. Those in support,
please raise your hands.
Uh, any opposition. Let's go
back online for support or
opposition.
Anyone hoping to make uh any
public comment in support of the
bill, please raise your hand.
We still have Adrian here,
Adrian, Adrian?
OK, we're gonna move on. So we
also have uh someone under CMG.
Can you hear us?
OK, we're that's it.
Members
Representative Luhan Madam
Chair, quick question. Um,
Uh, she sent me her statement
and I have permission to read
it.
Thank you. Um.
Adrian Bel Martinez.
I mentioned her Girl Scout troop
at age 5, she attended many
ceremonies with Boy Scouts of
America, civic events where the
American flag was lowered and
retired with great honor and
dignity, and no such honor of
retirement was awarded in the
Mexico flag with the symbol.
When it came time for her to
select a project to earn the
highest award award in Girl
Scouts, she selected a process
of how to pay honor and dignity
to the New Mexico state flag and
our honored Puebloa symbol.
This is a a little gratuitous
and self-serving. I'm sorry, uh,
she believes in Eagle Scouts
such as State Representative
Mark Murphy should assist her in
achieving a law to honor not
only the great state of New
Mexico, but the flag of New
Mexico bearing the Pueblosa. She
spent hours over the past year
researching uh the history of
New Mexico and the flag. Thank
you, madam chair.
I move a do pass.
Representative Barrego.
You chair and uh
representatives, um, just a
quick question about the
military. Is this the same
manner in which they would um
dispose of the flag as well.
Madam Chair Representative, yes,
it is. It is OK. Thank you.
OK, we have a motion for due
pass by Representative.
Luhan and a second by
Representative Zamora, do we
have any opposition?
Seeing that you have a do pass.
Move along to House Bill 405.
um, is generally a bill allowing
job protection for our volunteer
firefighters. Um, the bill
essentially provides up to 112
hours of protected leave for
training purposes.
And it provides up to 112 hours
of protected leave or what is
defined as active service.
Um, time
Um
And that's just essentially it,
um, coming from, you know, my
community, um, protecting our
volunteer firefighters has been
a definite priority for me, um,
in the county of San Miguel, we
are entirely dependent upon
volunteer fire. Um, when you're
responding to emergencies in
these areas, um, volunteer fire
personnel are the ones that are
responding to our emergencies.
There's been a significant
decline in volunteer.
Recruitment, retention, um,
personnel throughout our state,
um, right now in our county
alone.
We are down over 50% over the
last few years due to COVID, due
to fires, due to whatnot, um,
and looking at ways of how we
can support this very critical
public safety piece, um, to
continue to protect our
communities, um, so with that I
do stand for questions.
Let's go
to the audience, please raise
your hands. Those in opposition.
Let's go online.
Anyone hoping to make a public
comment in support of the bill,
please raise your hand.
Anyone hoping to make a public
comment in opposition to the
bill. Please raise your hand.
Committee members.
Representative Barraco.
Madam Chair, I'd like to make a
motion for approval of House
Bill 405. I'll second that. OK,
we have a motion for to pass by
Representative Barrego, a second
by ranking member block. Do we
have any opposition?
Seeing none, you have a due
pass.
OK, you may begin.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Good
morning, committee members. Glad
to see you this morning. Um, I
have in front of you today House
Bill 518, which is LGBTQ plus
Day. Um, this is essentially a
day of observance, every 60 day
session, the 4th Tuesday of each
January, and this is right
alongside African American Day,
Hispanic Culture Day, AAPI
Native Hawaiian Day, and it's
actually during a API uh native
Hawaiian day that, um, Madam
Leader actually said something
that really
stuck with me. She said, oh,
it's so amazing to see so many
leaders from our community here
and represented. And I remember
looking up and going, oh.
I wish I knew of LGBTQ members
who were leaders and that they
were highlighted and so that was
sort of the impetus for this
bill, Madam Chair and committee
members, um, I remember being a
young person looking for
examples of queer folks and, um,
so Madam Chair, uh, members of
the committee, a couple of facts
before I will hand it back over
to y'all, but, um, young LGBTQ
people are of course committing
suicide at a rate that far
surpasses our straight
counterparts. Um, the life
expectancy for LGBTQ New
Mexicans.
Um, our average age is 37.7
years versus non-LGBTQ
counterparts is actually 49
years old.
Um, so that's quite a
difference, Madam Chair,
committee members. So the
purpose of this bill is to
celebrate what we have and who
we have while we have them. And
with that, Madam Charles stand
for questions.
OK, let's go to the audience,
those, uh, please raise your
hands if you'd like to make a
comment and support.
OK, we'll take 51 minute,
please.
Hm
Oh, OK. I, hello, Madam Chair
and committee. Uh, my name is
Karen Chavez, and as a woman who
is works in the roundhouse and
is married to another woman
working in the roundhouse. I
would love to come to work
during future sessions and see
the complete inclusivity.
And celebration of queerness,
offering a safe space for all.
Let's show everyone how
supportive New Mexico is and
past HBI1.
Ja, members of the committee, my
name is Isa Villenaranjo. I'm
here with the Quality New Mexico
and we stand in support of HB
518, New Mexico has been a
minority majority state since
its inception. We've always been
an inclusive haven and fiercely
protected our diverse
communities. It's our duty to
show support to our LGBTQ
community, especially in times
like this. In these challenging
moments when minority
communities face increasing
threats and discrimination, it's
crucial that we stand united in
the face of adversity by passing
this bill, we send a clear
message that New Mexico values
and.
b rate s its LGBTQ plus
community just as we do all our
diverse communities. As we face
national debates that often seek
to marginalize us, we now more
than ever have an opportunity to
lead by example. We can show
that embracing diversity and
supporting all our residents
regardless of orientation or
gender identity makes a stronger
state. Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Alicia Chris. I'm from
the Pueblo of Santo Domingo and
a registered lobbyist for NM
need to vote. I helped to run a,
uh, the need of power building
center in Albuquerque, which
helps to serve our youth and as
well as our native youth
organizing council and our youth
have, you know, repeatedly have
shared that.
Acceptance of our LGBTQ plus
relatives is a form of harm
reduction, and I think that, you
know, accepting this at the
state level, uh, would
definitely increase our, our,
um, community members and
ultimately our family members
ultimately we always do it for
our family. Thank you.
Chair and members of committee.
My name is Kath Sanchez. I'm the
policy director for Bold
Futures. We are a reproductive
justice organization. And why
would a reproductive justice
organization be here at the
table for this. One of the
pieces of the framework of
reproductive justice is the
recognition of the intersection
of our identities. We appreciate
the uh legislator, uh
representative Anaya for
bringing this forward and
understanding just how important
it is for us to center not just
black indigenous women and
people of color, but
LGBTQ folks who have not just
helped the state grow, but are
also out legislators currently
in, in uh the session. Thank
you. We support this bill.
OK, let's go online. We'll take
2 in support. One minute.
Speaking in support, I believe
we have Liam. Liam, can you hear
us?
Yes, great. You have one minute.
OK. Good morning. Um, chair
committee. My name is Liam
Simplicio. I am from the Pueblo
of Zuni. I would first like to
express my appreciation for
allowing me to comment on this
effort to recognize the LGBT
plus community. Um, I believe
this is a great opportunity to
shine a light on a topic that
has been a very controversial,
but also very important one to
many people. As a member of the
LGBT community, I am fortunate
to have not experienced the
hardships that past generations
have endured.
To that, I am very grateful and
proud of the people that have
came before me to fight
oppressive barriers, the ability
to push forward, speak out, and
fight for rights as a
marginalized community is one
reason to support this effort
for record, um.
Um
Um, recognition, um, while
through winning efforts made
from past generations, this does
not mean that all is one today
generations from uh the present
and future generations have,
still have challenges to
overcome. Uh, I myself working
with the youth, um, within my
community has seen so many.
What was that? Thank you so
much, I'm sorry. OK. Thank you.
All right, we're gonna move on
to Danielle, Daniel Williams.
Can you hear us?
Good morning. Thank you, Madam
Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Daniel
Williams. I'm a policy advocate
at the American Civil Liberties
Union of New Mexico.
The ACLU supports this bill. The
ALU has been advocate for the
full inclusion and justice for
our LGBTQ community in New
Mexico and around the country
for many years, and we're
grateful for the work that this
legislature has done to make New
Mexico one of the safest place,
places in the country for queer
folks, and I also want to say on
a personal note, as a gay man,
as a member of the LGBTQ
community growing up in Raton,
New Mexico, thinking about
having
In
6 dozen openly LGBTQ members of
the legislature thinking about
our legislature, celebrating our
community would have been
unthinkable for me as a kid, and
it would have probably changed a
lot of the way that I view
myself. So not only do I think
you, uh, young Daniel, thanks to
you as well, and we support this
bill. Thanks.
Thank you so much, Daniel.
Um, can you double check?
We're, we're no more we need to
take a little um pause, we
understand that the webcast is
not working. Do check.
Or maybe it was from the past.
And it's fixed.
Maybe it was from yesterday.
on Sunday.
Yeah.
I thought you liked.
Yeah.
OK, let's go back to the
audience, uh, do we have any
comments in opposition?
Seeing none, let's go online.
Anyone hoping to make comments
in support of the bill, please
raise your hand. We have
Charles.
00, I'm sorry, and
So, we're moving to, uh, people
hoping to speak in opposition to
the bill. Uh, Charles, were you
hoping to speak in opposition to
the House, the House bill?
Charles Garris.
OK.
Committee members.
Represented block.
Madam Chair, representative, and
I know we talked about this bill
a little bit before. I did, I
still have some concerns with
the language.
And so
I'm one of these people who's,
maybe I'm a little too
traditional.
I mean, I'm, I'm one of the
first openly gay members of this
legislature, but
I'm not
Good. Well, I'm, I'm just not a
fan of the Q word in the bill. I
still find it to be a slur.
And some of my constituents do
too.
And you know, I, we've all been
called that if we're
part of this community,
unfortunately, and it wasn't fun
for us, and so,
I'm, I'm not one of these people
who's like, let's, let's be
empowered and reclaim a word.
It's kind of like reclaiming the
F, the other F word that
would go to people like us or
The N word for people who are
black and African American. So,
can you, can you just give me a
little more information about
that. I'm just, I do have a
little heartburn when it comes
to enshrining in state statute
slurs.
Thank you. Um, uh, Madam Chair
and Representative for bringing
it up. I know we spoke about
this before. Um, I think one of
the pieces of this is, you know,
it's hard to enshrine anything
in law, especially with our
LGBTQ community because it is
ever changing. Um, but I will
say, Madam Chair and
Representative, um, from a
personal note, I consider myself
queer. And so I, as somebody
who's ringing this bill forward,
would really like to see myself
represented in this, and I know
that there are folks from our
community who absolutely
identify with.
this. Um, I also know that a lot
of folks in our community,
specifically those who are of an
older generation actually don't
agree with a lot of these. Um
they just still call themselves
gay. And to me, it was about
being as inclusive as possible,
knowing that these honestly like
change very often. It's actually
really hard for me to not just
use the um
Originally, we wanted to use
just that acronym, LGBTQ plus,
um, but unfortunately in
drafting, we can't use that and
so we had to spell it out. And
so Madam Chair Representative,
to your point, we really wanted
to use LGBTQ plus because we
feel that that is actually a lot
more inclusive than listing, um,
that Madam Chair Representative,
we came to an issue in drafting.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative, and my other
question quickly was the, I'm
guessing you can't put the word
PLUS in statute, so it had to be
expansive. Could you go into
that for me? That's exactly it,
Madam Chair Representative, uh,
we could not put a plus sign in
there and we use the word
expansive um to help cover that.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. Yeah, I still
have some concerns about that.
keyword in there, but
I don't know. I'll, I'll listen
to the debate. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Luhan stepped
out, represented Paraco.
Yeah, um, Madam Chair, and
Representative, it is only
during, uh, it's only a
celebration for the legislative
session. And so it's not for the
entire state. Um, this is in the
same section of the law as um
other statewide celebrations,
but this is just for the
legislature. Um, I, I've also
had questions asking why this
particular day, it's because it
was open. So, Madam Chair
Representative, it is one of the
days that is open during a 60
day legislative session.
Representative Luhan,
you pass.
have a motion for it to pass my
representative.
Wuhan and a second by
representative onion or by uh
Madam floor leader.
Representative on Nor.
No.
Representative Borego.
Representative Lujan.
Yes, Represented Mejia. No.
Represent uh Madame Fleurli.
Yes.
Representative Zamora? No.
Madam Vice Chair, Madam Chair.
Madam chair by by 5 to 3 vote,
you have a due pass.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representatives.
Didn't get it. We'll ask him for
a picture.
Here's a picture of the critter,
which I've never seen in my
life.
Thank you.
Did you bring a critter?
Madam Chair, did we bring a
possum?
We asked everybody for a live
possum and nobody would bring us
one.
OK, you may begin.
OK. Thank you so much, Madam
Chair and representative. So
I'll give you a little
background on the, the thought
process behind this bill. So we
were thinking of because other
states, there's New Hampshire
and a few other states that are
trying to pass bills to create a
state.
Marsupial
And in
The world, there are lots of
marsupials, and there are a lot
of possums, and so the
Didelphus Virginian.
Which is the, it's called the
Virginia possum is the only
Marsupial native to North
America.
And, uh, Madam Chair, that's one
of the big reasons that we
brought this forward to bring
some awareness to it and to to
have a discussion today about,
about how important this species
actually is to our state and to
our country. And so when we're
coming, when we're talking about
the Virginia possum, it's
actually
Kind of a misnomer because
that's where the first place is
that they saw it when settlers
came to the Americas, but the
word actually comes from a poet
on, um,
Word in Algonquian, which means
white dog or dog-like beast, and
so this, this animal.
Which is very cool, by the way,
and we'll, we'll talk about some
facts about this animal, but
There's a lot of folklore, a lot
of uh
Origin stories that have been in
the past. So, for example, the
Cherokee Nation, they have a
A little bit of a origin story
and according to the origin
story, the possum's tail became
bare due to a trick played on it
by a jealous rabbit and a
cunning cricket, so there's a
lot of, a lot of lore to this,
this animal, but other than just
it's really coolness, it also
contributes to our ecosystem
when it comes to protecting us
from certain things. So I'm just
going to go a little bit into
that. For example, it's natural
pest control, they consume large
quantities of of.
ticks, insects, rodents, and
other pests that could otherwise
harm human and animal
populations. They also eat
overripe fruit, making them
nature's cleanup tools.
Uh, there are disease resistant.
They have a really low body
temperature, so they do not
carry rabies like other other
animals do that are also
rodents. Uh, furthermore, a
snakebite immunity, uh, they're
immune to snake venom, and it
helps to control venomous snake
populations like here in New
Mexico with these uh diamondback
snakes, and actually there was a
study from San Jose University
in California that isolated the
peptide and possum blood?
That causes resistance against
snake venom, and researchers
have expressed optimism that
finding this could help create
more accessible antivenom for
people around the world. So
this, this species is super
adaptable and it has a really
cool storied history in New
Mexico. There's so much awesome
details that I would love to
share with you guys, but I know
that we are crunched for time,
so I'm just gonna throw it over
to representative Lord.
And Madam Chair, I was very
disappointed that you didn't say
awesome, possum stories. I just
have lived experience. I thought
it was a great idea. We were
talking on the phone and we
realized we didn't have a state
marsupial, and I have lived
experience with a friend of mine
that had one and they're just
awesome. They make them, they
found one that was a baby, kept
it, and they're just sweet and
loving and tender, not like you
would think. They're not scary
at all. They're just amazing
animals. So that's all I bring
to the table is that we need a
state marsupial and
This is the only one we have in
North America.
Thank you, ma'am Chair.
Let's go to the audience. Do we
have anyone in support?
Do we have any opposition. Let's
go online real quick.
Anyone hoping to make public
comment in support of the bill,
please raise your hand.
OK, we have one, Amy Garcia, can
you hear us?
Hi, I can hear you. Can you hear
me? We have one minute, Amy.
Yeah, no, I just had a question.
Um, I didn't hear that any other
state had the same.
Um, animal.
I um
Sorry, this is unfortunately not
a question portion. We were just
hoping to hear a public comment
and support or in opposition to
the bill. Yeah, no worries. I
can't, I can't support it
because I didn't understand if
if other states had the same
animal. Got you. OK. Thank you
so much, Amy.
All right. Was there anyone who
was hoping to make any public
comment in opposition to the
bill?
Committee members.
Representative Zamora. Thank
you, Madam Chair. We're, where
do we find this animal is native
to New Mexico.
Thank you Madam Chair
Representative, actually,
interesting story. It's native
to the entire country, but there
are sightings. I, I looked at a
study from the southwestern
naturalist, which was published
in 1995, which is a peer
reviewed study on these
marsupials, and they have seen
them migrating toward this part
of the country for a very long
time. It started in the late um
or the early 20th century when
large amounts of them started,
started coming in here. But we
see a
According to this study, which I
kind of
Writ down in a really small way
so I don't have to like write
and tell you about the entire
study. Um, it was first reported
then and it's in the
southeastern portion of the
state and then by the 50s,
records of the species expanded
uh with documentation proving
their presence in the Rio Grande
Valley, Rio Grande Valley near
Berlin, as well as Bertollio,
Quake counties, they also have
observations placed in diverse
locations, including Animus
Mountains, Hidalgo County,
Cimron River Valley and Union
County.
And then some er some other
researchers, pardon me, I'm
trying to get that word out.
Researchers, quite an
interesting word, speculated
that central New Mexico's possum
population or opossum population
was introduced while others like
Other researchers, they suggest
a natural range expansion from
the Texas Panhandle. So uh that
uh and other, there was a
question earlier from somebody
about if this was the only state
with this marsupial. It's all
across the country, but
specifically regarding New
Mexico, with these snake
populations, it, it does help
alleviate some of those concerns
with those, which is why it's so
important to our state,
particularly and Madam Chair
Representative, if you go
online, there are actual pest
removal places for possums in
Burling County because
We do have possums in Burnley
County.
And Madame Chen and
Representative Lord, are you
saying that, that there's a pest
removal to remove the possums?
Um, because there's Madam
Speaker and, and, and
Representative, there's a lot of
people that are afraid of them.
Because they hiss and they're
actually very sweet and very
gentle. People get or they don't
want them on their property, so
they move them to other
locations, just like they do
with every other Madam Chair and
representatives, I have a possum
story to tell you. OK, here we
go. Thank you, Madam Chair, so I
was excited to hear this. So I
was working on a farm.
And
The owner of the farm had a
Oil house
And he went in the well house
one day and there was a possum
in there.
And he was mad. The possum was
upset.
And we didn't know.
What this was.
We've never seen one before.
And we needed to get to the
plumbing because there were some
issues with the well and stuff.
The possum wound up at the
county agent.
And
He told us that.
He, he, he defined what the
animal was.
And then he told us that the
possums weren't native.
that part of the country, which
we're in Clovis, so maybe in the
way you described it in, in New
Mexico, maybe they're not.
But he, what the story he told
us is.
We, we wondered how it got
there, and he said, well, maybe
it jumped on the train back east
somewhere and then it unloaded
here somehow.
So, so maybe this was a foreign
possum. I don't know, but.
Mr. Speaker, representative,
that is, that's an amazing story
of the hitchhiking possum, um.
What we're trying to do is bring
awareness that they are here and
hopefully less people will harm
them and realize that they're
part of our society and that
we're just here for, uh, possum
equality and also I would love
to add to that. There are other
species of possums or opossums,
however you prefer to say it. It
was, it was Americanized from
the opossum before it's now just
possum because it's way easier
to say. But there's a lot of
them in South.
South of us in Mexico, parts of
South Central America, there are
possums that four-eyed possums,
they actually don't have 4 eyes,
they just have little, little
white dots above their eyes,
which makes it look like they
have 4 eyes, and they're down in
Guyana, uh, and in northern
Brazil. We also have some water
possums in Costa Rica. And
actually the possum, it usually
tries to find a home near a
water source. So it'll try to
usually find a place which is
why it's in the Rio Grande
Valley, because they see the the
river and they have access.
access to all those bugs, ticks,
etc. and also the snakes so they
can help.
Hone that population, so it's,
it's really cool and I, I didn't
really know as much about this
until I started researching it
and I feel like in the next
couple sessions, we will be
bringing forward legislation to
make this the state marsupial.
Madam Chair, I think this could
be a 3 hour debate. What we do
on the floor, Madam Chambers, I
really wish that it wouldn't.
Madam Chair, uh,
That concludes my questions.
Thank you, Representative Lujan.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, do
we have any other marsupials in
our state? Mhm.
I'm Chair Representative, we
don't.
This is the only one native to
the Americas and maybe, maybe
people madam chair may have.
Shipped some in as pets,
potentially, but the only ones
that actually are roaming free
in the country who are not pets,
for example, although people do
have pet possums like like
representative Lorde's friend.
Yeah, Madam Chair, um,
Representatives, um, are they an
endangered species?
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative Currently,
they're not.
But there are not the the
population varies because
usually when a possum has
babies, and what makes it a
marsupial is it keeps the babies
in a little pouch. So usually
about half the litter survives,
traditionally, it's about 70
babies that are usually born,
about half the litter survives.
So it is quite a survivalist
species, and then after 3 or 4
months, they will leave the
mother's pouch and then they'll,
they'll have their own cycles of
their own and start new families
and and when they're babies,
they're actually only about the
size of a bee.
Each little baby possum. So
it's, it's just a really cool
species and Thank you, Madam
Chair. Um, I'm, I'm asking these
questions cause my daughter is
brought to my attention that
Uh, the possums or possums, uh,
that there is a, there is uh
some kind of disease that's
affecting them in their
population. Are you aware of
that, Adam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So in my
research, I did not really go
deep into that, but if that is
the case, then we certainly
should bring awareness to it.
Thank you, ma'am, uh, and I,
that's why I'm, I'm grateful
that you're bringing this
forward so that when you have
this uh expanded conversation
and really kind of dive into the
um
You know, these other
scientific, um.
Issues around our, our animal
populations and, you know, as
our kids are in school learning
about all these different
animals, this, this spikes their
attention, especially, you know,
as we as legislators are paying
attention to them. And so I, I
appreciate you bringing this for
us so we can forward. I didn't
know that we, this was the only
marsupial, um, we have in our
state or native to our state,
if, if you will. Um, I think
it's cool. I love marsupials. I,
you know, my, my daughter and
her friends love marsupials and
she
wants to go to Australia because
of the indigenous population of
marsupials in Australia's
kangaroos and other animals. So,
um,
So Madam, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative, so this would be
a specific classification as the
um
The state marsupial, is that
correct, manager?
Thank you Madam Chair
Representative. Yes, that's
correct. Currently, North
Carolina is the only state that
has a state marsupial, which is
the Didelphys Virginian, and
then in New Hampshire, they're
trying to pass legislation to
make it their states. So I would
love to beat New Hampshire, so
not, not hoping that they don't
pass theirs, but
If we have to be 3rd, we'll be
3rd, but it's gonna happen.
I don't care madam
representatives, um, I hope our
wild friends out there are
listening and maybe they can,
you can bring him into the
conversation and other groups
like that. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Sano Brego.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I will
support your legislation, but
because I think it begs the
question about marsupials in our
state, but there are, uh,
Tasmanian devils as well, and we
had one at the bioark not that
long ago that died, and you
might want to take a look at
that, but, um, Tasmanian devils
are also marsupial animals, and
they do exist in in the country
and in New Mexico. So I just
thought I'd point that out
because I think
that this, you know, it really
begs the question of, I mean,
the only time I ever heard about
a possum was when I watched um
the Beverly Hillbillies and
granny always wanted to talk
about her possum, so I mean, I
just thought I'd raised that
question, that issue, um, but
Madam Chair, I, you know, I do
support it. I just think that
we, you know, we should be
looking at all of our marsupials
across the state because I don't
think this is the only one.
So I'll just point that out.
Thank you. And Madam Chair
Representative, yes, we do not
want to address uh possum stew
it all in this conversation.
Thank you.
Representative Ona Nonu.
If
you don't pass this bill, I will
eat those critters.
The for the love of God, Madam
Chair, I move it too fast. And
We have a motion for you passed
by representative on or a second
by Representative Lujan. Do we
have any opposition?
Seeing that you have a house.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you all, and I wore my lucky
possum tie today, so I got my
possum little key holder. My
possum sticker on our desk.
We're very possum.
Yeah, no possums stew though,
madam chair.
All right.
Do we have presenters for House
Bill 427.
How about, how?
438.
Mm
Um,
Good morning, Madam Chair. Um,
Um, to
Today we were, I'm losing my
voice, Hank, I'm going to grab
my drink.
The allergies are getting to me,
Madam Chair, committee members,
excuse me, um.
So today we're presenting um
House Bill.
Um
438, but we have a committee
substitute in front of you
today.
That
Madam Chair, it's
231-413.1.
Move it for discussion, Madam
Chair.
You, we have a motion to move
for discussion on a second,
please discuss the committee
substitute.
and my um expert witness today
is uh Santa Fe County clerk
Catherine Clark.
And so the, the bill, the title
of the bill's relating to
employee benefits requiring
employees of the state and
political subdivisions of the
state to be provided an
opportunity to exchange unused.
uh, compensatory leave for
compensation at least twice each
year, Madam Chair.
So
The substitute proposes changes
to compensatory leave policies
for state and political
subdivision employees in New
Mexico, the original bill
mandated uh annual payouts for
unused compensatory leave while
the sub substitute bill requires
employees to
Be given the opportunity to
exchange unused competence or
leave or monetary compensation
at least twice a year. Both
versions aim to improve the
employee benefits but raise um
but and also talk about the the
fiscal administrative and
operational concerns.
Thank you, Ma.
Hey
We are ready for public comment,
those in support. May I have my
expert have a couple of words,
Madam Chair. Thank you, yes.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. Um, we
made these changes based on
feedback, um, the idea was that
previously, um, they would have
to mandatorily roll over their
um compensatory hours into a
fiscal payout in this way, the
um worker can now choose whether
or not they get a payout, um,
and then they have an
opportunity to do that twice a
year. So it's giving more
flexibility to the workers.
Thank you.
OK, let's go to the audience for
um comment and support.
OK.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, Carter Bundy would
ask me, we want to thank the
sponsor and the expert for
bringing this. This is something
that really does add some
flexibility and make sure that
when workers are working those
extra hours, they're ultimately
compensated for it. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of committee John Lipshutz with
the New Mexico Federation of
Labor, uh, representing all
40,000 plus of our workers
across the state, we, uh, again,
thank the sponsor for bringing
this up and believe that this
bill is, is necessary for uh
proper treatment of our workers,
state workers. Thank you.
OK, let's go online. Do we have
any comments and support?
Anyone hoping to make any
comments or please raise your
hand. Looks like we have a
Lindsay Hurst here. Lindsay, can
you hear us?
Yes, I can. Can you hear me,
Lindsey.
OK, Madam Chair and committee,
thank you for the opportunity to
speak and thank you to the
sponsors for bringing this bill
forward. My name is Lindsay
Hurst. I'm currently serving as
executive vice president for CWA
Local 7076, and a state
employee. Our union represents
state employees at 13 agencies
about 2700 positions, 27% of
which are vacant due to high
vacancy rates for your state
employees are being tasked with
additional job duties to cover
vacant critical positions to
meet program needs, and as a
result are
ac cru ing compensatory time in
excess of accrual limitations.
This means that some employees
are not getting compensated by
leave or uh by um compensation,
uh, for the hours worked, this
issue is impacting our hardest
working and most dedicated
employees, frequently employees
are unable to utilize a crude
comp time as leave because
management is unable or
unwilling to grant the leave due
to coverage issues resulting
from high vacancy rates. The
biannual
payout will allow employees and
programs scheduling flexibility
and reduce the amount of comp
time liability that is being
carried by our agencies. Please
pass House Bill 438. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Lindsay.
Anyone hoping to make public
comment in opposition to the
bill. Please raise your hand.
No.
OK, let's go back to the
audience to any opposition.
OK, one minute, please.
Mark Allen, general counsel for
New Mexico County, New Mexico
County is not taking a position
on this yet. They will tomorrow
at the board meeting. We'll be
given the opportunity. I'm
expressing my concerns. This
will have a physical impact on
local governments, specifically
counties, uh, comp time is
governed by the Fair Labor
Standards Act, it's capped for
the first responders at 480
hours and all other employees at
240 hours. They're allowed to
take that time unless it would
be unduly disruptive. It's
accrued.
and a half, and all of it is
paid out.
Um, there's no opportunity for
the counties to not pay out that
money. Another important feature
is FLSA, the Fair Labor
Standards Act was not applicable
to local governments until 1985
based on the Supreme Court
decision. After that decision,
Labor and the National
Association of Counties and the
National, uh the, uh, the League
of, of national cities reached
an agreement.
Any other comments in opposition
in the audience.
OK, seeing none.
Um, I'll move to adopt the
committee substitute.
I have a second, Madam Chair,
may I ask you a question?
The sub that we have in our
binder is a house labor veterans
and military. Oh, affairs
substitute. Is there another
substitute or was this
substitute already, Madam Chair,
I, I stand corrected. Uh, there
was supposed we were working on
something and it didn't get here
on time, so this is a set before
us. Thank you.
Thank you.
To adopt it, so thank you, Madam
Chair.
OK. Thank you.
for that.
Clarification.
That was very confusing. OK,
committee members.
Sended block.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative. So a couple of
quick questions for you.
I see that this will cost 18
million.
And
It is about 6 million in related
costs. Is this based upon the
current uh many substitute from
labor, or is that FIR?
Based on the original bill. I'm
just trying to clarify. I
believe this was based on the
original bill.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative, and then also,
how, how does this new change
affect any collective bargaining
agreements, and you just go into
that a little bit for me. Thank
you, Madam Chair, um, um.
Representative Block, um, the,
it already states in the bill
that it's not going to affect
any collective bargaining in
section 2 of the bill. So we are
very careful to make sure that
we are not infringing on any
collective bargaining rights of
any workers.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative and uh
One other question, is this
retroactive
to representative, it is not.
OK, ma'am, sure.
So if I had 2 hours or something
currently, I couldn't.
Once this is enacted, I couldn't
use those 20 hours as leave, how
does, I'm just trying to figure
out when it starts to count,
which hours? So.
So as soon if this bill is to be
enacted, Madam Chair, then that
the clock starts and on that day
of enactment and those accrued
hours um are part of your bank,
and so,
It's not necessarily
retroactive, but already it's
current. It's in real time
manager.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair and
thank you, Representative and
Madam Clerk.
right? OK, thank you.
Representative Barrigo.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um, and
thank you, Representative and,
and, uh, madam clerk. I'm just
trying to understand um what
this bill exactly what it does,
um, so,
If an employee has.
Extra
Leave, I guess, time, then they
would be compensated for that.
Is that what this is, exactly,
um, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Borego, what we
are seeing is that certain
employees are accruing many,
many, many hours of calm time
because they are the employees
that are not allowing their
departments to fail due to high
vacancy rates, but because they
are the star employee or the
employee that's essentially
making sure that their
department does not fail. It can
never cash out those comp time.
benefits and some departments
are making them zero it out
without that that compensation
ever going back to the employee,
because they are literally so
busy, they cannot take that
time. We feel that that is
unfair, and we also feel that it
is uh essentially a form of wage
theft, and we believe that it is
only fair for those employees
who have, who are in departments
with very high vacancy rates, we
can never take the time off to
be able to get some form of
compensation for the time that
they have worked.
And that leave time is
calculated.
Based on their hourly rate.
That is correct. And what
happens to employees that are um
not hourly.
And
Madam Chair, uh, Representative,
and what, and are you talking
about contractual um
I'm talking about employees that
are management level.
How are they compensated. So
typically there is an hourly
rate, um, even if someone is
salaried, and that would be the
calculus for uh the rate, Madam
Chair, um, um, Representative
Borago.
Madam Chair and uh
representative Main Clerk.
Um, do you, I mean, who would
track this, the
And, and I just think about like
when I was working, we did a lot
of over, I mean,
Over time, I guess it wasn't
really over time, it was on time
and we tracked it ourselves.
And then, you know, our managers
would decide.
Um, especially for management
employees, um,
Because it was kind of
considered part of the job, I
guess you could say. But how
would that be, Madam Chair,
that's gonna be calculated
through regular payroll, um,
accrual of time in in management
and that.
OK, thank you.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
committee members.
chair I would move a to pass on.
House labor, veterans and
Military Affairs Committee
substitute for 38.
Um
I would do pass motion by Madame
Fleur leader and a second by
Representative Brego Caro.
Represented.
Yes.
Represented block.
No, with a quick explanation.
Representative Borego.
Representative Lujan.
I resented Mea. No.
Madam floor leader.
Representative Zamora.
Madam Vice Chair, Madam Chair.
Then I'm sure by vote 5 to 3,
the motion motion passes.
OK.
Oh,
represent black, an explanation
I voted no just because I
haven't been able to talk to my
county and my municipalities
yet, and I didn't know what
their stance was, so I would
hate to vote on something until
I got that. So that's why. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Let's move on to House Bill 571.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee at the
bill before you today is the
result of, well, a couple of
things that there's a, there's
over 100 bills this legislative
session, addressing our housing
issue in New Mexico. I think
there's bipartisan agreement
that we need to address housing.
Um, there's, we found an area of
agreement on this bill and a
couple of other bills where we
can really find support. This is
a carrot not a stick regarding
zoning. So you may be familiar
with Main Street designations or
perhaps the family, the um the
Family friendly business award
that's given out annually for
businesses that choose to
participate in flexibility or,
and last year rewarded over $53
million in grants to Main Street
projects. So it's a voluntary
designation that cities could
take on in hopes that as future
comes, there will be incentives
for those communities who are
making zoning changes for
receiving funds within their
district. Now that may come from
nonprofits, it may come from the
government. It could be federal.
who knows where those dollars
would come from, but it's sort
of an ease in
giving some options and some
recommendations to communities
where they could, um, adopt
zoning practices that have
worked in other states for
building capacity. And I do have
folks here that would like to
speak and support also Carlos
and Daniel with the, the, well,
you have different roles. I'll
let them speak.
Don't want to mess up titles.
Thank you, Representative Madam
Chair Daniel Wewa, I lead the
governor's Office of housing. We
supported the creation of this
bill, um, uh, I think it's
important to understand that um
a a recent Pew article, Pew
Charitable trusts identified
regulatory obstacles is one of
the primary barriers to housing
affordability and housing
availability in New Mexico. Um,
this is intended, it, it says
DFA because our Office of
housing doesn't have statutory
authority yet, but we would
intend to take on this project
as the office.
of housing, create a framework
for what best practice land use
and zoning is for the state,
something that's currently not
defined. This would help support
adoption or work in the Office
of Housing to work with local
governments to implement best
practices around zoning, it
could eventually be used to
direct special funding for
housing that's awarded to
communities who make these types
of changes. I think this is a
model that was um recently
passed in Colorado with Prop 123
at $300 million annual uh
housing funding source that's
conditioned upon local
government.
s uh improving zoning
frameworks, and that's an
example of how, um, we use
proactive carrot-based methods
to move folks in the right
direction around regulations for
housing. Thank you.
And Madam Chair,
Representatives, my name is
Carlos Camorra. I work with a
company called Site Southwest. I
do a lot of uh uh affordable
housing plans, housing plans,
economic development plans,
comprehensive plans for a local
jurisdictions all around New
Mexico. Um, I've seen a lot um
how jurisdictions are, are
trying to to deal with housing.
Um, and so I'm here, uh, as an
expert to talk about um some of
the the things that those local
communities are doing and how we
might be able to get more
support for this local
communities in addressing that
comprehend.
in systemic issues.
You. Let's go to the audience,
those in support, please raise
your hands. OK, let's do 5
1-minute comments, please.
Yes, good morning. Um,
I, I'm sorry, I don't know the
formalities.
What's her name? Madam Chair.
Uh, I'm Rebecca Price with my
construction company Affordable
Housing, and I'm in support of
this bill. I've been trying to
get affordable housing to come
to the marketplace. Um, we will
build off-site construction, so
I'm in support of this bill
because affordable housing
affects uh health. It affects
crime, um, it brings down crime,
it supports health.
Um, it is the financial
stability to getting people into
um wealth for themselves, so I'm
in support of this bill.
Good morning, Madam Chair. My
name is Marquita Russell. I'm
the CEO of the New Mexico
Finance Authority. My agency
oversees the opportunity
enterprise, housing development
fund, the law that created that
fund last year requires that the
board give priority to projects
that have implemented best
practices, there's unfortunately
no framework for that in this
bill does provide that framework
and it would be incredibly
helpful to the communities
looking to apply for funding
from that particular fund. Thank
you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, uh Kent
Cravens with the uh registered
lobbyist with the New Mexico
Association of Realtors, uh, for
all the reasons stated, we're
enthusiastically in support of
this legislation, and we thank
the sponsors for bringing it
forward.
OK, let's go online. Do we have
any comments and support.
Anyone who hoping to make public
comment in support of the bill,
please raise your hand.
OK. Anyone hoping to make public
comments in opposition to the
bill. Please raise your hand.
See none.
OK, we'll go back, back to the
audience. No opposition
committee members.
Represent a block and then
Representative Lujan.
Madam Chair, and thank you,
Representative Tao. Good to see
you. Good to see your experts
again. I feel like I keep seeing
you in all my committees, so
good to see you. So, Madam Chair
Representative, a couple of
questions on this one. So, first
question is, will this mean
municipalities will have to
cooperate with these state
strategies. Will it be mandated?
Madam Chair and Representative,
this is completely voluntary,
um, and I hope that as we
promote this and they learn of
what the options.
are, you know, think about the
folks within your district that
may be trustees, you know,
they're working without a lot of
staff, um, you know, that they,
that they see these options and
they see it as an opportunity,
but it's definitely a carrot not
a stick.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
representative, and then another
question I had from somebody who
asked me, uh,
If these state strategies will
support local architectural
aesthetics, and if you guys will
respect municipalities varying
opinions on where to locate
affordable housing.
And then there's another
question, but I'll let you get
those two because it's a lot.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and when
you talk about aesthetics,
that's, that's a difficult
thing. This doesn't mandate
anything. It talks about best
practices and zoning. And I
think that's more covenant, and
we cannot supersede uh covenant.
I mean, if you want to speak to
that law?
On existing cabinet
Madam Chair Representative. Um,
I think in this case, uh, so to
speak to the first part, which
is aesthetics, this would not
govern aesthetics, this would
govern things like um the
density of housing, the speed
with which housing gets
approved, those types of
processes, it's really about the
supply of housing, not the
specific type or aesthetics of
housing. I'd also say this isn't
specifically about affordable
housing. This is about housing
supply in general, that being
the underlying driver of our
affordability and homelessness
issues that we just need more
housing in general.
We need to build it quicker,
that helps lower the cost, um,
regulations and our zoning
frameworks are one of the big
drivers of costs that we can
actually effect in our state.
All right. Thank you, Madam
Chair and Representative. And
then last question on this
portion of it is, will the
award.
Can it, can it be revoked?
In any way
Well, Madam Chair and
Representative, I don't know
what the rollout's gonna look
like. Uh, Main Street is a
designation that is a, it's a um
mutually beneficial agreement
that's entered into between the
local municipality and the
state. So if, if it's similar to
that, um, then I, I believe that
it would be able to be revoked.
In addition, if you know,
there's other programs out there
where people are receiving
supplemental funds or, or
increased eligibility to
increase funding, they are
sometimes annual.
So I don't know exactly what
this will look like, but it may
be, um, well, you know, you'll
We'll work closely. I've got
commitments from, from Daniel
that we work closely together on
this.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative and then a
little, a little earlier, we
said this is not just about
affordable housing.
What kind of other housing
because Madam Chair
representative in my district,
people, we have a lot of
beautiful houses that are
getting built, but because they
can afford to build these houses
and people can buy to buy these
houses. That's what has a better
payoff at the end of the day. So
a beautiful brand new $500,000
house can be built because
You can build it like that, and
that's high, that's a high end
in in my district. I'm sure it's
higher in Santa Fe, for example.
But could you give me a little
more information on that and how
we're going to try to push this
toward these houses that can be
affordable for everyday in New
Mexico workers.
Madam Chair Representative
Block, I appreciate the
question. That's exactly the
intent of this, uh, a good way
to think about it is that, um,
zoning drives the market, right?
And if you have, say,
Very low density zoning with
really big lots that incentivize
the developer to build a big
expensive house to maximize
profit. If you instead allow
more homes on that same piece of
land, the incentive becomes to
build more homes, you get
smaller, more naturally
affordable housing, uh, doesn't
have income limits, doesn't have
restrictions on it. It's just
entry level housing for workers.
And so this is really looking at
how do we design regulatory
frameworks that incentivize
building the type of housing
that we really need in New
Mexico right now.
And Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Block, if I could
just add, um, I think another
example that uh we were chatting
very closely with Representative
Dao about, um, existing
regulations might prevent, uh,
the rehabilitation of buildings.
And so one thing we were talking
about is how could we get more
residential into vacant
buildings, especially in rural
areas, not just rural areas, but
that you could feasibly build
more housing in those areas. You
could reduce the cost, you could
reduce the, the regulatory.
barriers that are currently
preventing that kind of housing
from being built. And so we
would want to decrease the cost
of that. We would want to make
it more accessible or more
affordable, but we would also
just want to have more of that
housing be able to be built. So
if a jurisdiction was to be able
to create something that removed
some of those barriers and made
housing more affordable or
accessible, not necessarily a
capital A affordable for lower
income, but just making that
more affordable than it
otherwise would be or lowering
the cost of construction.
For instance, through
streamlined development review
or reduced regulatory barriers,
um, those would also be examples
where you're decreasing the cost
of construction for all housing,
as opposed to just, you know,
focusing on one kind of area of
the market. Thank you.
Madam Chair Representative, and
I agree, I think that
We should be always looking to
decrease these regulatory
barriers in any way because
they're usually what keeps these
projects from being built in the
first place. So, uh, this
brought another question, I
apologize. So when it comes to
this,
Does it encourage
Building affordable but quality
construction, cause I wouldn't
want to incentivize a bunch of
builders to build really
shoddily built homes on tiny
little lots that barely have any
back back yard, and then they,
they have problems with them 10
years down the line and
It it's, it would rather be
better just to build a brand new
house on that. I just want to
make sure that this is an
incentivizing really cheaply
made homes. Matt Chan
representative, it's not. This
is about zoning. And so it
wouldn't change building code,
but it may reduce the burden and
the, the process of getting to
that point of being able to
build. But I mean like I, I, I
will give you a concrete
example. Sierra County is one of
the lowest income counties in
the state. And there is a
recently an adopted zone, they
adopted some zoning and it said
that you could not, regardless
of your lot size, you
could not have an RV hooked up
in your, in your, on your own
private property. So there was
several family members who
started calling me saying, you
know, our disabled nephew lives
in a trai in an RV on our, you
know, 1.25 acre lot, and now
they're not allowed to do that.
So they may or may not get rid
of that zone, but it, it could
be one of the, the options that
they take to receive the award
is rolling back some of the
local zones that prevent people
from or some, not all
communities allow an additional
dwelling unit. But that's your
private property.
Did you have the right to have
an additional dwelling unit. No,
I'm not, we're not telling
people what to do, but there
will be a list of best
practices.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
Representative. That's all I
had. Thanks.
Representative Lujan and then
Representative Brego. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Thank you for
bringing this bill forward. I
actually was at a conference
where there was a presentation
on, on just this information and
I
You know, kind of dove into it
and I, so I appreciate it coming
forward and that we're seeing
this as we are committing so
many dollars to the uh housing
office and uh DFA, um, I would
say that um,
Right
Uh, Madam Chair, I would say
that um.
As the rules will be made by DFA
and the housing office.
Did you consider maybe putting
together or creating a committee
or board or commission.
It would promulgate the rules,
Madam Chair.
Well, Madam Chair and
Representative, they won't
necessarily, I mean, these are
going to be the menu of options
for the communities to
voluntarily adopt.
Do you want to speak to that or
is it different in the housing?
Madam Chair Representative, um,
we haven't actually discussed in
statute the the process sort of
the means and methods of how
this is done. I think it will
take extensive consultation if
you look at the language in the
bill, it suggests that we need
to uh understand the needs of
both rural and urban
communities. Um, I can tell you
that we have been doing outreach
to over 40 communities around
the state over the last year and
so have a handle of the range of
issues and would love to have
input from legislators and key
local stakeholders.
around this. Madam Chair, I
would just turn to page 2,
section 3, subsection A, the
department shall establish a
program to grant an award
certificate to a municipality
that has adopted or established
one or more department approved
strategies to increase housing
affordability and accessibility.
The award certificate shall
designate a municipality a
building New Mexico community,
so there, they're in lives where
you would be that the department
would be promulgating.
rules
For the, for the um
The award. So who does that,
Madam Chair?
Madam Chair Representative as
the state's Department of
Finance Authority.
That's why I'm asking, did you
consider or would you consider
creating?
More, uh, for me, more
guidelines for uh the type of
money that's going to be going
through these, these coffers, if
you will, madam chair, and
create a bore, a committee or
commission to help promulgate
those rules and to oversee this
um
What you are creating in this
legislation, Madam Chair. Madam
Chair Representative in this
particular case, it, it's
literally going to end up being
a paper certificate. There's no
money tied or a word tied to
this other than an
acknowledgement that you've
chosen to participate. It could
in the future, and I'm sure if
there's an award or an
appropriation attached to it
that there's going to be.
process. Madam Chair
Representative inadvertently
wouldn't there be an award that
would, uh, or wouldn't there
follow the, the, the
appropriation of the funding.
Along with this award.
For after this award Madam Chair
and Representative, not in this
bill, but I'm, I hope that
there's another bill that comes
out with awards, and I'm sure
that one will have strings
attached.
And
Madam Chair Representative, I've
just offered that. Um, it made
sense for us to first develop
the criteria before we tied
anything to it, right? Um, and
help people understand that.
We're certainly committed to and
happy to convene a working group
around the establishment of
this.
Madam Chair, I appreciate that.
Thank you.
That's all I have.
Senate
Madam Chair, I moved that House
Bill 571 do now pass?
I have a motion for do pass by
Representative Rego. I'll
second, please call roll.
Was there anyone in your name?
Representative Black
Pass.
Representative Borego.
Representative Lujan.
Representative Mejia.
Yes.
Madam floor leader.
Yes.
Uh, representative Samara.
Representative Block, yes.
Madam Vice Chair, Madam Chair.
Madam Chaired by vote 8, the
motion, the motion.
Hey
Oh,
it's a habit.
No. Thank you. Oh man, thank you
for bringing this legislation
forward. I think it's really,
really important, but I also
think it's, it's very important
and I'm happy to work with you
outside of this because putting
those guardrails in place are
really important. We have so
much money over, I think the
last committee hearing, we said
over $130 million going to these
efforts or possibly. Thank you.
OK.
Right, Representative Lujan,
unless I see Kadena.
Let's go ahead and do House Bill
439.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
We're passing out some
information.
Thank you so much.
Um
My second bill I'm presenting to
committee today is House Bill
439.
Relating to emergency medicine
requiring public safety
telephone line telecommunicators
to be trained in high quality
telecommunicator cardio
pulmonary resuscitation, Madam
Chair, um, when there is an
emergency, we know to dial 911
and the dispatchers who answered
the call are often the first
point of contact in an
emergency, 911 dispatchers had
the unique opportunity to help
callers as they wait for the
first responders to arrive.
House Bill 439 will ensure all
dispatchers are trained and able
to coach bystanders to perform
CPR. Cardiac arrest is a leading
cause of death.
With more than 350,000.
out of hospital cardiac arrests
occurring each year in the
United States. It strikes
suddenly and without warning,
and what happens in the first
few minutes can mean the
difference between life and
death.
Mocha with that we, we present
um this bill and I'll have my
expert wit witness introduce
himself and have further
comment.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Mahesh
Sita with the American Heart
Association, and, you know, uh,
Uh, every minute, uh, a cardiac
arrest patient doesn't, victim
doesn't receive CPR, the
survival rates go down by almost
10% and, you know,
We are a rural state.
And EMS responses, you know,
sometimes takes longer and it's
very critical.
Or 911 operators to be trained
in this so they can at least,
you know.
Assist people on the other line
to do, you know, uh, uh,
compressions and, you know, the
studies have shown that, you
know, dispatcher assisted CPR
have higher rates of survival
and better outcomes, especially
when it's done immediately, so
with that.
We, we
Thank you Madam Chair, so this
what we're discussing today is
known as dispatcher-assisted CPR
or telephone CPR. The goal here
is to ensure that all
dispatchers receive this
training, and as a result, all
calls are provided with this
important life saving
instruction, even those without
previous CPR knowledge can
quickly be instructed and this
leads to saving lives, Madam
Chair, and that's why we have
this piece of legislation before
you today. With that, we'll
stand for questions.
Thank you, Representative. Let's
go to the audience,
those who wish to speak, please
raise your hands.
In opposition.
Let's go online.
Anyone hoping to make a public
comment in support of the bill,
please raise your hand.
No, we'll move on to, uh, anyone
hoping to make public comment in
opposition to the bill, please
raise your hand.
I see none.
Representative Anya Arnu.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Representative, for
bringing this bill forward. Um,
just one quick question is,
what?
New or different training with
telecommunicators receive that
they are not.
Received or trained in now cause
of the guidelines changed.
So, madam, CPR, I believe you're
referring to regular CPR, um,
this would be specific to
telecommunications on the phone
when, say, for instance, uh,
you're in emergency situation
and somebody drops to the floor
and they're.
Obviously pulling their their
heart or you think they're
having a cardiac issue and you
call 911, then the operator is
able to instruct you in uh the
CPR, um, preservation methods,
Madam Chair. Yeah, Madam Chair
representative, let me, I guess
I'll just try asking, I don't
think I'm making myself clear,
so the current guidelines that.
911 operators give for a cardiac
event.
happening elsewhere, of course,
uh, are we training them? Are we
updating those guidelines? Yes,
madam Chair, Currently we do not
have that, uh, those provisions
or the, the, that full training
in place. Oh, OK. All right,
thank you, that clears it up for
me. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Members
Represented a
pass.
for you pass by ranking member
block and a second by Madame
Fleurlier Skipansy. Do we have
any opposition?
Oh,
here you go.
Do we have any opposition?
Seeing none, you have to pass.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you committee members.
You representative Dana.
Let's do House Bill 427 as a.
Yes.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee.
We just finished with tax, so
I'm glad I got to run over
quickly.
Um, I'm here today with House
Bill 427 as amended, uh, what
this bill does is add a category
of possible spending to the New
Mexico Water Trust Board that's
administered by the New Mexico
Finance Authority. Currently
there's 6 eligible purposes that
a local government or authority
could use um or could seek
financial assistance for this
adds a 7th in real-time water
monitoring. So, um, this
real-time water monitoring would
not
cor r up t or replace the
regulatory or compliance
responsibilities held by NMED
and others that have boots on
the ground to keep an eye on
what's in those water sources,
but instead give local
governments and water
authorities real-time data to be
responsive and ready to um make
sure the drinking water that
their constituents have is safe.
So with that, I will go back to
the committee, Madam Chair.
Representative, let's go to the
audience. Do we have anyone who
wishes to speak and support.
OK, let's do one minute.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is Vanessa Ladi. I'm a
registered lobbyist for
Borderplex Digital, and we agree
with what a sponsor has said
with Representative Carrena
every New Mexican deserves clean
water.
Good morning, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. My
name is Jennifer Bradfield, and
I am an attorney for a company
called Apaluma. Apaluma is a
digital software company that's
working on putting together
water monitoring programs with
the state of New Mexico. We have
been working with Secretary
Kenny with the New Mexico
Environment Department. He stood
in support of this bill and the
House Water Committee. He was
unable to make the committee
today, but said that I could
represent his support today as
well. This bill will help ensure
that the public can
see what's in their water,
giving transparency to local
citizens to know what
contaminants might be in their
water. Currently over 40% of New
Mexico's drinking water systems
are out of compliance with
drinking water specifications.
Thank you.
Good morning, Madam Chair. My
name is Joe de la Rosa. I'm the
chairman of the New Mexico
Border Authority. Uh, one of the
things this bill also does is it
helps local water operators,
including those in rural areas
of the state and along the
border, uh, to gather the
critical data that's necessary
for grant applications and
loans. So currently there's like
a catch-22 situation where
monitoring data is necessary for
the applications, but they don't
have the resources to actually
collect the data. So this
actually addresses that issue.
Thank you.
Hey, let's go online. Do we have
any comments?
Anyone hoping to make public
comment in support of the bill,
please raise your hand.
Seeing none, we will move on to
anybody hoping to make public
comment in opposition to the
bill, please raise your hand.
Hey, anybody in the audience who
opposes.
Seeing none representative
Luhan.
Ma I'm sure weren't appropriate,
I'd like to make a motion.
Make a motion to do pass.
Dana Brego.
Chair and, and thank you
Representative. So,
I'm, I'm trying to understand.
The bill, is it for smart,
really for smaller communities,
um, because in Albuquerque we
test the water in the Rio Grande
on a, on a regular basis. So I'm
just wondering.
Um
Oh, you know, is it?
Expanding that role to the
smaller communities or the
Eseass or how, I mean, how does
this
exactly work
this is, uh, is adding a
possible spend to the water
trusts board. So the water trust
board has been around for
decades, very well established,
um, local governments, water
authorities can go and seek
financial assistance for their
priority water projects. So
there's 6 potential uses they
can um seek that those dollars
for now. Sometimes they go out
as
Sometimes they go out as loans.
Um, the majority of the money
going into the or a good source
of the money going into the
water trust board comes out of
our severance tax bond
distributions, but then
sometimes and including this
year, I think as I've understood
it, we put general fund dollars
in as well because we know how
crosswater systems how water is
a priority, and many of our
local governments and water
systems need resources to get
their water what it needs to be
across different uses. So this
bill is not designed to um
positively impact.
one particular kind of water
system, not aseias, not rural
communities, not urban areas
like Albuquerque, but instead,
it just says that real-time
water monitoring and protection
can be one of the purposes that
um someone would go to the water
trust board for and seek
financial assistance. So the
Water Trust board is such a
reputable body in New Mexico.
Um, I believe we have Marquita
here in the audience, uh, and in
her leadership at NMFA, uh, but
what they do is receive
applications, they prioritize
which
projects are ready, um, and
have, uh, what they need to
actually move forward with
something. They then put
together a legislative package
and I believe we just passed the
the this year's water trust
board uh legislative package out
of the House floor yesterday. So
this is just saying if someone
uh wanted financial assistance
for real-time water monitoring,
it could go to the water trust
board for that assistance. It
would still follow their regular
process, um, go through their
application review and then in
front of the legislature before
those projects were actually
funded, um, I would say that
NMFA also did bring us some
language uh amendments in house
and water that we uh amended
there to make sure that what our
bill was doing was in line with
their.
Their operations at the water
transport. Thank you. Thank you,
Madam Chair and Representative
Kadena that does um help me
understand what exactly what
you're doing, um, and I think
it, it's a good bill. um, it
just seems to me like honestly,
Madam Chair and representative
is that the amounts that are in
here really need to be increased
in the future, but that's just
my opinion. So, um, thank you
for bringing that forward,
representative.
Samoa.
Madam Chair, I'll second the
Dupa
Representative Rankin member
block.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. Just a couple of
quick questions about what we're
monitoring. So are we monitoring
flow rates,
Uh, dissolved oxygen, minerals,
chemical pollutants, what, what
do we monitoring in these added
language in the bill and what,
what would that?
Maybe bring back to us so we
know what's in there.
Uh, real-time water monitoring,
it's about what's in the water,
whether in my part of New Mexico
and you may have read the news
about Cura, we're looking at
arsenic and other parts of the
state, it might be PAST, but
it's trying to figure out what
the quality of the water is in
real time.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So I'm just
wondering, so what, what
parameters are we searching for
quality wise? Is it all of those
PFOS, uh, arsenic, or is it?
Is there a prescribed number of
contaminants we're looking for
or madam, this bill doesn't
speak to that. It's just so that
those local governments and
water authorities would have
real, a real-time understanding
of what was in their data.
Of what was in their water.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Madam Chair Representative,
and then eligible entities for
this, would it include
Universities.
As well, or is it just a se.
Associations, land grants, uh,
local governments, who, who's
included in this? Madam Chair,
it would be the same eligible
entities that can today go to
the water trusts.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. So that would
not include anyone in the
private sector at all?
Correct, so we have our shout
out, uh, from the back, the
incredible Marquita from New
Mexico Finance Authority that
says no private entities are not
eligible for water trust board
projects. OK, thank you, Madam
Chair. That's all I had.
Thank you. OK, we have a motion
for do pass a second. Let's call

Your mic's on.
And you said you're light. I
thought
OK. Representative Lujan, would
you please start House Bill 4594
Ferrari as she makes, Madam
Chair.
May begins representative.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members, um, I'll do
this on the fast version, HB 459
appropriate. Oh, could we bring
my expert, um, she is under ABA
ABBA. Her name is Melanie Kirby.
She is
With the adaptive breeders
alliance. Rosa Maria Kirby.
Does that hurt?
That might work.
Uh yeah, can the, oh, here we
go. I have her here.
She is in the Dallas airport
going to Rome for a special um
Um, egg.
Um, meeting.
I have Melanie Kirby. Hi,
Melanie, can you hear us?
Yes, can you hear me? Yes.
Melanie, I'll go ahead and just
introduce the bill first, um, HB
459 appropriates 100, I'm sorry,
1.5 million from the general
fund to the higher education
department we're programmed to
be housed at the Institute of
American Indian Arts, IAIA to
research um pollinator habitat
in conservation, and it
authorizes the funding to be
spent between um FY 26 and 28
and allows up to 15
50,000 of the appropriation to
be spent for indirect costs to
administer the program, um, and
so with that, I'd just like to
have my um expert Melanie, who's
an integral part of all of this,
um, to explain some of the
background.
Sure. Um, Madam Chair, an
esteemed committee members,
thank you for having me and
thank you, Representative
Ferrari and the others on um the
co-sponsor list to support this
bill. So yes, I'm in the airport
and hopefully you won't get too
much background noise, but to
kind of keep it short and sweet.
Um, HM 33 was sponsored by
Reporttez last year, and that
actually called for a New Mexico
pollinator protection plan
working group to be formed. Um,
that was formed and it started
meeting.
in August under the facilitation
of the New Mexico Department of
Ag. One of the requirements of
HM 33 required that a report be
submitted to the water and
Natural Resources Committee in
October of 2024, which was done,
um, that report actually
included a list of
recommendations. And a lot of
the recommendations were focused
on the need for more research,
more education, and more
outreach. The development of a
pollinator protection plan is
still gonna take a little bit of
time.
The working group has been
meeting regularly, and that's
all rooted actually in a 2014
presidential mandate calling for
each state to develop one. We're
on a year 11 in New Mexico still
doesn't have one, so we're
really trying hard as a working
group to get one done that can
really encompass and be
inclusive of our diversity of
landscapes across the state. But
in the meantime, the working
group realized that in order for
them to really fulfill the
development of a plan, they
really did need some more
information. There's not a lot
of
data that exists for New Mexico
pollinators and so, um,
In collaboration with Institute
of American Indian Arts, which I
also serve as an extension
educator there. I'm a pollinator
specialist there. I'm also on
the National Subcommittee, um,
for pollinators of the National
Agriculture Research Extension
Education and Economics advisory
Board, and I've also served on
numerous boards relating to bees
throughout my almost 30 year
career working as a professional
beekeeper, um, that these needs
are not going to happen unless
we get funding to do it. And so
NMDA had shared with
at that particular time back in
October, that they didn't
necessarily have the capacity to
pursue that. And so I asked if
we could do a tandem effort to
some of us in the working group
who are interested in trying to
find funds to help support these
recommendations and the need for
the research and education and
outreach. And so luckily,
Representative Ferrari um heed
our call and helped us to
develop this proposal. Um, one
of the things that we're hoping
to do is
I, I actually already have 5
years' worth of pollinator
programming. We started with
beekeeping, we now also do
pollinator and plant research
also on culturally relevant
plants, and we also do a lot of
extension and outreach,
including an event today that my
co-worker and research assistant
is going to be doing at the
fruit growers Workshop up in
Abiquiu. So, basically, there's
a lot of need and this would
help us to further those efforts
to get the, the data that's
needed in order to
further develop a plan. Thank
you.
Let's go to the audience. Do we
have any
OK, we have um comments and
support.
One minute, please. Thank you.
Let's take 5 comments and
support.
Hi, my name is Julieanne
Salinas. I'm a beekeeper in
Albuquerque and I'm a member of
the New Mexico Beekeepers
Association, co-founder of the
New Mexico Bee Collective. And
today I'm here in support of HB
459 as a representative of
Agriculture and Network and the
New Mexico Food and Agricultural
Policy Council. Um,
With the passage of House
Memorial 33, this body
recognized the need for
pollinator protection,
education and research, and this
provides the financial backing
to move this project forward, as
a, as a beekeeper, I recognize
that pollinators are a key
indicator species of the impacts
of climate change on our state.
And this bill would help um
Pro the the funding for the data
collection on that. Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, my name is Susan
Wheeler. I'm a member of the New
Mexico Food Policy Council as
well. um, also a board member at
Farm to table. We are in full
support of hostpi.
459. Make sure you, um, we've
been tracking pollinator
protection for a number of
years, so this is extremely
important. The plan is extremely
important as Melanie reported
we're way behind other states,
but also the data is extremely
important. We put out a food
charter this year and having
that data is going to um help us
monitor progress and of course
the outreach and education is is
equally important. So we thank
our sponsors and we're in full
support of this bill.
Uh yes, my name is Eugene
Pickett. I'm with the uh
Governing committee of the uh A
and Food Policy Council as well
as black farmers and ranchers.
And uh the national rural
Coalition. What we found out
about
Pollinators
Pollinators which are now uh
identified as livestock also.
We're losing pollinators. So
we've lost on a national level
about 80%.
So the 80%, you know, it was a
multiplying factor.
And um pollinators actually in
the ecosystem.
Um
Balance production and
agriculture, so maybe being
ignorant of that.
Probably 10 years ago, over the
years, you know, I've gained
that knowledge to say, you know,
the importance for every uh
Um
Climate event.
As a disastrous. We lose
pollinators.
So, you know, this, uh, we're,
I'm we're, you know, full
support of 459.
Good morning, Chair, members of
the committee. My name's Hutchie
Miller. I'm the
intergovernmental outreach
coordinator for Santa Fe County.
I'd just like to simply state
that um the Santa Fe County
Commission has a
Um, resolution in place for
sustainability and pollinator
protection is uh element of that
uh resolution. Thank you.
Thank you. Let's
Madam Chair, committee members,
my name is Pam Roy, also
representing um farm to table in
New Mexican food and
agricultural Policy Council and
the Rocky Mountain Farmers
Union, and we stand in full
support for every reason that
everybody's already brought up
here and look forward the
passage of this really important
bill and the research to come.
Thank you.
Thank you. Any others, uh, let's
go online.
Anyone hoping to make public
comment, please raise your hand
and support. We have uh
You, uh
Joanne, Joanne, can you hear us?
Yeah, can you hear me? I sure
can.
Thank you. Uh, my name is
Johannes Lenzer. I'm with the
National Center for Fronti
Communities based in Silver
City, New Mexico, and we operate
the frontieroo hub. Um, we're
also a member of the uh New
Mexican food and Act Policy
Council, uh, where I sit on the
governance committee, and yeah,
we work with small producers,
um, across the state, especially
in the southwestern part of the
state, we transport a lot of
food around, but uh we won't
have any food without
pollinators who are really
integral to our ecosystems.
And therefore also in support of
this bill. Thank you.
So much, John. Anyone else open
to any public comment in support
of the bill?
OK, moving on. Anybody hoping to
make public comment in
opposition to the bill, please
raise your hand.
See none.
Hey, Representative ranking
member block.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative, Madam Chair
Ferrari, good to see you. So, a
few questions here. I
My first question is, why didn't
we do this at New Mexico State
University, where they do have a
pollinator program at their Los
Lunas campus already. Can you
tell me about that, Madam Chair.
I'm going to refer to um
Melanie.
My expert
Hi, yes, Madam Chair and
esteemed members of the
committee. So Los Luna does
happen to have an urban IPM
specialist position. And in the
past, they've had several folks
in that position who have
started to dabble into um
working with beekeepers and
promoting pollinator, but they
don't have an established
program. And so, one of the
things that was suggested to us,
because I actually did not
necessarily suggest I, I
immediately, but what
was suggested to me by NMDA and
also several other legislators
was that there's an opportunity
here for us to be more inclusive
with including tribal
perspectives and tribal led
research. Additionally, um,
there's a need for programs that
not only already exist, but to
be further promoted. And so if
it were to go to NMSU, they
would actually have to use the
bulk of that just to get stuff
started, whereas IAIA already
has a track record of programs
and can
literally just with additional
funding, be able to extend that
out to reach more parts of the
state and more communities.
I
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative and an
expert. So then with the report
that we got from
HM 33 from last year, what
findings did it have indicating
that this was something that we
should do.
here with the door opening.
Madam Chair, I'm wondering what
did HM 33 from last year, the
memorial that.
Had the NMDA.
Have a report. What did that
report say and what findings led
to this legislation, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
Representative, um, um, my
expert had mentioned it. Do you
want to add anything more about
it, Melanie?
Um, yes, I'll just add that, um,
the working group was
established to include
additional stakeholders because
the original plan that had been
put forth already had been
developed over 6 years by the
New Mexico beekeepers
Association, and in addition to
a few other stakeholders,
including pesticide applicator
representation and other
organizations that work with um
with pollinators, but the
working group was then expanded
to include more folks, um, and
so
They've been slowly working
through it. We've been, I've
been going to those meetings
regularly. Um, there's been a
little bit of back and forth as
to just start with the new
outline to, you know, work with
what already exists. And so it's
been a little bit of up and
down, but the, the working group
is pushing through. So, the
recommendations that were put
forth were basically required by
that HM 33, um, as a report to
demonstrate where we are
standing with the plan. And so
what that report actually
indicated was that
more time was needed to create
the plan, but that also we
needed more data with which to
create the plan. And so,
Group morale actually started to
suffer slightly because we
realized it's the chicken and
the egg. You can't do the plan
unless you have the data, but
you can't do the data unless you
know what your plan's gonna be
and unless you have actually the
funding to do the research
that's needed. And so that's
what prompted the inspiration
for trying to pursue a way to
find the funding that's needed
to also allow the working group
to continue what it needs to do
so it can better reflect the
needs and also the potentials
for our state. One thing I would
also just like to share that's
really important is that many of
you may not have heard yet, but
there's been over a million
hives lost across the country
just this winter. And it's
really alarming because now
we've got federal agencies that
are starting to remove positions
that are looking at different
research avenues and also
different um obstacles and
environmental concerns that are
affecting the pollinators. So
interestingly, and I'll just
share this briefly. Honey is
valued at about $350 million
across
destination, but pollination is
the real and most important
thing. It's valued at over $18
billion a year just in the US
and globally at 235 to 577
billion. And so in New Mexico,
not only are pollinators helping
to produce crops, but they're
helping to produce seeds.
They're the ones who are
pollinating the alfalfa for
everybody who loves their New
Mexico beef, and they're also
helping to um produce fiber. So
it's really essential that we
get more research money to help.
sedate these and make a better
plan.
Madam Chair Representative, OK,
and then I'm wondering where I'm
just wondering how many people
do we expect to be hiring with
this 1.5 million. What, what
kinds of programs are we going
to be running with this
research. I just, it says 1.5
million, but it's not very
specific, so I'm just wondering
what that goes to. How many more
new employees, how many new
programs and what kinds of
research are we going to be
looking at regarding the state
versus what's already available
nationwide. How, how are we
gonna utilize every dollar to
make it count.
Melanie, if you could explain
that very briefly.
Yes. Sorry, I get, I get caught
up in the words. But yes, thank
you so much for asking. Uh, when
we came up with this proposal,
we actually did have it outlined
out at minimum, there would be 3
to 4 new hires, and one would
actually work to help facilitate
more stakeholders to become part
of this larger working group
that can then help to better
inform um pollinator research
and needs across the state. We
would also have educators,
researchers, and also provide
opportunities for interns.
Who would then be able to help
with that research. And that way
we could better train folks
within our own state to support
our own state.
They also, what, sorry, one last
thing too is that IA, IA as
fiscal sponsor because they are
a land grant university would
also be able to serve as um
fiscal sponsors to help do sub
awards. So if there were other
organizations or other
researchers or students who
wanted to pursue some of these
inquiries, they would then be
able to receive a sub award from
IA and IA.
Thank you, Madam Chair. That's
all the questions I had.
Representative Luhan and then
Representative Breo.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you. Um, Representative for
bringing this forward. We know
that
You know, there's been extensive
um funding and work done to
adjust the crisis of our
pollinators, um, globally, I'd
say, um, but in the United
States and we know that.
If we don't do something about
this, that we, there are
I'm sorry, there are different
crises, um, that we can face
with food supply, um, shortages
and the, and the like, and I
just want to say thank you very
much for the focus on this. Um,
I very much support this and,
and the work that IAIA does, um,
here in, in Santa Fe, I think
that, you know, um, our expert
witness is really hitting all
the, the, the highs of why it's
important to continue this work.
Um, my question.
is, is their funding in the
budget for this manager?
Madame Chair and Representative,
um, we are looking uh at the
Department of Ag and um also
there's um.
Some, um,
Pesticide, um.
Funding, uh, to offset, you
know, what pesticides have done
settlement, I should say. So we
are seeking that. That's
wonderful. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you.
