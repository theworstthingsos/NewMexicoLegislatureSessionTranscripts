We're gonna be in
TC.
And for those of you who don't know me, I'm
Jennifer Fabian. I'm an economist
for the LFC. Today,
I'm gonna be giving an overview of oil
and gas revenue to the state
as well as hitting on a little
bit um of some other
destinations of oil and gas revenue,
mostly talking about the state.
So I'll move right in. I know we're gonna
try to catch up on some time. So
I'm gonna move quickly
on the first page. The first
real page after the title slide,
you'll see a flow diagram
of oil and gas revenue to the state
of New Mexico. So
I'm gonna kind of show you what this
graph is showing us. This is a new
analysis that we've done
kind of tracking where this money
is coming from and where
it goes. So
you'll see in the top left,
all of the gray is the revenue
coming in. So
we have our taxes at
$6.6
billion. Um
that's broken up into production
taxes, those are taxes
on oil and gas severed
from the ground.
And then we have a couple of other taxes
like the natural gas processors,
tax, personal
and corporate income tax groce
receipts, um, things like
that on the
bottom, um,
left quadrant of the,
of the chart you'll see land
income. These are rents
royalties and bonuses on federal
and state land
that totals
$8.6
billion in total
revenue. As you move
across this graph,
you'll see kind of where
these oil and gas,
which buckets these flow
into which parts
of the state they go to
um if they go to local governments
or federal governments. So on the right
hand side of the graph,
you'll see their final destination.
So the early childhood trust
fund, this is all fy
23 data
actually received the most
of any state fund. Um
More than the general
fund uh
at over $3 billion
just below that general fund.
At 2.9 the
land grant permanent Fund 2.6
that's primarily from those rents and
royalties.
Um seven sacks, bonding and
Permanent fund is the
next largest at 2.5.
And then a lot of other state
programs in blue that receive a
little, little bit of
oil and gas money. Um For
certain activities, I
can go over that in just a moment.
Um The green is our local
government revenue. This does not
include the local share
of or the local increment
of G RT. This is the state
share of G RT along
with property tax from oil and
gas. So that's that ad
volum production and property
tax. Um I'll go over
that again a little bit and
then the federal government,
they get half of the revenue
on federal lands from federal
rents, royalties and bonuses.
Uh That's a $2.7
billion. So
in total oil and
gas production in the state
is generates about
$15.26
billion split across
these three different government
levels, state,
local and
federal government.
So I hope this graph is helpful.
It's, it's one you can mull on
follow the lines, see
where everything is going.
I'm not going to go over each
individual tax unless you
want me to. It's in the
appendices.
Um We have the oil and gas
severance tax at the top.
It's a huge
$12.5
million that
goes entirely into our severance
tax bonding program.
We have the oil and gas emergency
school tax. That's a
huge tax that we have
on the value of the
oil and gas severed from the ground.
That is one of those revenues that we've
been splitting between the general
fund and the early childhood trust
fund and starting next
year, some of that will be going into the
permanent funds as well.
Um, a lot of smaller
taxes down below
and then the other large share are
these uh kind of
land royalties, rents and
bonuses the state
that entirely goes into the land
grant, permanent fund from state trust
land. And then the federal
royalties is also
a revenue that's split between
the early childhood trust fund
and the general fund. So
hopefully this is kind of a
it's a map of the oil and gas
revenue throughout the
state
and just as a reference.
So the total revenue is
$15.6
billion. Fy 23
operating budget you all
passed was
$8.4
billion.
So moving on to page
three, we've seen these
graphs before oil
prices are tracking really, really
high due to
basically market conditions
globally. Um
in demand. Permian
gas is easy to get to.
So it has
generated a spike in
production. On
the next page on page four, you
can see our Craig
forecast those blue
lines for the production
levels. Um
And then the orange
are the actual uh production
levels. Um in the
state. It's been
exceeding our expectations
for a handful of years
and just steadily growing over
time. Um You
can just see those lines growing
exponentially in the last about
five years is when we've really seen a
big boom.
And so what do these changes in
production and prices really mean
for the state? Um
based on the last crag which was
published in December of
2023 direct
oil and gas revenues. So this is the
production taxes and the federal
royalties. Um
a $1 change in the average New
Mexico price of oil has
about a $60 million impact
on revenues throughout the
year, a 10
cent change in the average New Mexico
price of natural gas
has about a $45
million impact.
Each additional million barrels
of oil generates 6.9
million.
And each additional 10 billion
cubic feet of natural gas
generates almost $5 million
in revenue.
So we've been talking about how production
has been booming. Uh
We talk about these incremental
changes. What does that actually look
like in the last five
years? So we ran an
analysis, we looked at
fy 18 levels
of revenue compared to fy
23 levels of
revenue from oil and
gas. And this is on page
six
and oil and gas
revenues to the state. The
state share only not talking
about locals, not talking about federal
governments
uh has quadrupled
since 2018.
So 333%
increase in total
revenues to the state.
Um You can see kind of each
bucket who's
kind of benefiting
from those, the most
general fund has more than
doubled in two years. And
that's after you
all have passed these
mechanisms to divert some of this
revenue into the early childhood
trust fund. You can see the trust
fund $3.3
billion in fy
23. Um
that didn't exist in Fy 2018.
So that's, that's, you know, an
infinite growth.
Um The reclamation
fund has grown
800%. It's
not a ton of money, it's 3
$3 million growth into $27
million growth. Some of that as
a result, there's a mechanism
where if prices are
high enough, that fund gets a, a
little bit larger share.
Um So some of that
is being impacted there.
Um But the bonding fund
has a 4/400
percent growth. The
general obligation bonds,
this is a property tax revenue
on oil and gas. Um
522%
growth in five years.
Landre Permanent Fund is benefiting
a large amount and
then I will note this general fund
slow other land beneficiaries at
the end, that's a land
grant permanent fund
kind of spin-off.
And that was a little bit
low in 23
compared to 2018. And that's
because 2018 was when we
were, the state was putting out
a lot of those leases
getting a lot of bonus payments
right at the beginning of that
production, you
know, peak
now a lot of land has been leased. We
don't have a ton of new leases every
year. A lot of that land
has already been grabbed. So we
expected to see this be a little bit
lower 23.
Um And that's almost like
nonrecurring revenue. It's,
it's um it's dependent
on those bonuses. So that's
not unusual that we saw
that be a little bit
lower.
Moving on to page
seven, looking
at how our tax is stacked.
So this chart
is showing us the tax rates
on the value of
oil, um,
that is severed from the
ground.
So we're really looking at
this last column over
$18 a barrel. We haven't been
below $18 a barrel in many
years. So we've been at these
kind of higher tax rates in
the, the furthest right-hand
column for a while.
Um, overall
oil taxes stacked to be
roughly 8.27%
of the value of oil
severed from the ground in New
Mexico.
And I will note there are
exemptions and deductions
allowed for state federal Indian
royalties and trucking
expenses. And these
can be quite significant, um,
about, on average for
oil, they can be about
12%.
And again, if you want more information on
each of these, there's a
page in the appendices that
has each
tax, the rates
where it goes and how much
money it was in 23. If you want
kind of a one pager on
each of these
taxes,
looking at natural gas,
it's a little bit higher and that's
because there's a differential
rate, um,
on the emergency
school tax between these two
natural gas is taxed at a little bit
higher rate than oil.
Um, I think the LFC has
been, the staff has been
floating the idea of maybe equalizing
those. Um, it
doesn't make a lot of sense for a percentage
based tax to be different between natural
gas and oil, but you will notice
natural gas is a little bit higher at
8.97%
moving quickly through
this on page
nine, looking
at those kind of
stacked taxes, how do we
compare to other states?
So this is an LFC analysis. We
looked at other states. We're
kind of right in the middle in terms of
taxes. Again, this does not
include federal
royalties or state
royalties. This is just
the production taxes which
is dependent on the
value and the levels of
production. So
we're sitting about
8.5%
Texas right around there
8.3
in the grand scheme of the
nation's,
um
you know, oil producing states are
right in the middle. This
doesn't take into account deductions,
this is just the base rate. So we
would have to do a deeper dive on
how many deductions we give versus
how many deductions we give. Tex
Texas gives to really
get a good picture of
where we stack up, but at least on
face value, we're right there
with Texas for the
rate.
However, on the next page, we
can look at our royalty rates
and have those stack up because this
is the other major form
of revenue generation from the oil and gas
industry.
Um royalty rates in New Mexico
are a bit lower than Texas for
these prime Permian and Delaware
Basin tracks.
Um We have a
cap so our
royalty rates on state trust
lands, they can range from
12.5 to 20%. We
have a 20% cap on
those. Um,
the most productive tracks.
We have an 18.75
minimum percent
minimum, but it can't be higher than
20. Texas is
charging about 25%
for those prime tracks in the
Permian. So when you
look at our base rates
of taxes on the last
page and then
combine those with the royalty rates, we're actually
a little bit lower than our, than our neighbors
in Texas.
Again, the state trust land,
it all flows to the land
grant permanent fund that
primarily benefits education.
Our education is
85% of land grant permanent
fund beneficiaries. So that's
where a lot of that money is going.
It's technically general fund but
it is uh
constitutionally
earmarked for
education.
Mm.
So moving forward from state
trust land to these federal
lands, um The
Mineral Leasing Act was passed in
1920. So it's been 100
years since we've seen a federal
royalty increase.
However, the inflation reduction
act did increase it.
So we're gonna start seeing
uh federal royalty rates increase
to 16.67%
as a minimum up to
18.75%.
Um So we are
finally seeing an increase
from federal lands with
the inflation reduction Act
and this will have a revenue impact
it's built into our Craig estimates.
Um The general
fund is revenue
from, this is capped
in the general fund. So this will primarily
benefit our severance tax, permanent
fund and our early
childhood trust fund.
And you can see the share of federal
land is growing for our
production levels.
Um So this should be a little
bit of a revenue boom to the
state.
So what does this look like for our
state budget? What does all this
revenue actually mean?
Um So the direct oil
and gas revenue makes up 19%
of our general fund budget.
This is after you
all have diverted a lot of revenue
out of the general fund.
If you include indirect revenue
from G RT Pitt and
sit, we're looking at close
to 35% reliance
in the general fund.
If you include the investment
accounts, which are
now very independent from oil and
gas, they were
seeded with oil and gas money.
So you have to give oil and gas a little bit of credit
for funding a lot of
those permanent funds.
Currently, they are not no
longer tied to oil and gas. Once the
money's in the fund, it spins off
revenue on its own, but
those account for 12 to 14%
of the general fund as
well.
So we're always talking about
reliance on page
13. Uh
You can see our reliance on
oil and gas is shrinking
in large part
and, you know,
100% because
of the moves you
all have made to put
money into other accounts
that will spin off future revenue.
Um, I always talk
about oil and gas in this
peak season we're
in as winning the lottery
and I think most people,
if they won the lottery would do three
things, they would buy a
couple of nice things. You
would go buy the nice car you've
always wanted or the nice
RV, or whatever
you've always wanted to buy.
And I think that is what you
all have been doing with nonrecurring
funding. You're putting money into
streets into bridges,
into water systems that have been
neglected for a long time. These are things
that have been on the list for a long
time and you put a
ton of money into nonrecurring. So
that's kind of that little boost
after winning the lottery.
The other thing I think people do when they
win the lottery is
increase their standard of living a
little bit. You start buying
the nicer clothes, just a
little, you buy the nice shampoo.
There's kind of daily expenses
that might increase that
you would normally be pinching pennies
on. And that's our
recurring budget that's been
growing. And then the last
thing people do is they put money
away so that you
can maintain that
increased standard of living over
time. And that's exactly
what you all have done with the permanent funds.
You've taken a lot of this oil and gas
money, you've done some really
nice things that are kind of one
time. Let's fix the problem.
You've done some nonrecurring
or recurring expenses
to increase kind of the state
standard across the
board for state agencies
and then you put money away to maintain
that over time. I think that's the
right approach. We can see that in our
general fund reliance
decreasing.
Um And then on the next
slide, you
can see kind of our worst case
scenario.
Um You have enough
money in reserves, reserve
levels for fy
24. Um
As of the last Craig are
almost $3 billion
2.8 billion dollars.
On page 14, you can see
our worst case scenario from
Craig. If oil
and gas tanks and we have a
recession, it would be
about a $1.9
billion hit to the General
fund or to Allstate funds.
Um I'm sorry, that is
General Fund. So we do have
enough. Um
We would never see 100%
revenue decline.
Um You
know, we have enough money in reserves,
which is a great place to be
because oil and gas will always be a
volatile
industry.
So on page 15, you've
seen this graph before too. It's
the the oil production outlook
for New Mexico. Um
We're still looking at a peak,
what do we do with this money at the
top? Um And I just
covered that. And
again, on page
16, you can really see the evidence
of this kind of lottery approach.
You've capped the general fund revenues
at $2.79
billion moving forward.
Um, the early childhood
trust fund is doing very well.
They're getting fy 23
they got more than the general fund.
That's the only year, early childhood
will actually have more
oil and gas revenue than the general
fund in fy 24.
That's gonna start to kind of equalize
a little bit and then the general fund will
overtake those as
those five year averages
kind of decrease back down
to normal levels.
Um But the
early childhood trust fund's doing very
well, general fund is doing well.
Um And I think that really
speaks to the, the, the
foresight and thought you all
put into what to do with all this
revenue.
So we've kind of shored up
general fund, you all
have done this lottery approach to general
Fund. But there are quite
a lot of other funds that are still
overexposed. As
you can see on that first chart.
The general fund is only
one part of state government
that receives oil and gas
funding. A lot of these
other areas are very
dependent on oil and gas
revenue that might not
be here forever as we see these
production levels decline.
So, um
moving on, I'm gonna
kind of skip forward
to page 18
and talk about the severance
tax
um and the Severance
Bonding severance tax bonding
program. Um,
prior to legislative action
last year, this last year, this,
this year, the state
capital program was heavily relying
on oil and gas revenue. It
was funded through severance
tax
directly.
Um The last couple of years, we've
been fortunate enough to have enough general
fund to fund a lot of the capital
program. But without
that, it's been relying
on severance taxes for
a very long time.
Um These
booming aga revenues cause
rapid growth in the capital
program contributing to
large project backlogs,
increased project costs and
billions of unused and unin
invests funds kind of
waiting to be spent.
Um This also
affects our water
um projects, the colonia
and Tribal and the housing trust fund
because those are all getting a proportion
of the severance tax funding
um fund
money.
But Kelly and Izzy came
up with a great scheme last year that
you all supported um
and voted through.
Um I think almost
unanimously but House Bill
253 authorized
the Board of Finance to convert excess
cash um
available in the severance
tax bonding funds.
Um and kind of
constrains the future
use of those funds and created
basically what was a permanent fund
the same way that the permanent
fund acts as this kind
of trust fund for the general
fund. This capital
development and reserve fund will
help stabilize and grow
capital funding over time.
So you can see on the bottom
of page 19.
Um The funding available
for capital projects is going steadily
grow instead of being
up and down and very
dependent on oil and gas
revenue. So that
was a great kind of
mechanism that we borrowed from the
general fund to use
for severance tax. Um
Bonding in the the capital
program,
I want to end with kind
of one more opportunity
to evaluate our oil and
gas dependence and that's on our general
obligation bonding
program. So another capital
program,
um it's a property tax
based bonding
program. So while
property tax is,
it's been in the past, primarily
residential, non res residential
properties, oil and
gas has been growing as a share
of property taxes for
the last five years.
Much, much larger growth
in the oil and gas property taxes
than other property taxes.
So the share of values
that have been
being taxed by the
property tax, typically
the share of oil and gas is between
eight and 14%
that skyrocketed up to
37% in fy
23.
So a
much larger share of our
general obligation bond
revenue is oil and gas
money. Um So
something to keep an eye on board of
finance knows we've been talking about
it with them, but something to definitely
monitor moving forward
if something needs to
kind of be moved around to
shore up some of that.
Um So we're not totally
dependent on oil and gas
in that area as well.
So I know it's very, very quickly.
I wanted to make sure to leave time for
questions. I think we have nine
minutes to get back on schedule.
Um So
here for questions again, take
a look at the appendices that has a lot
more information on each
tax. It also has a
decision tree
on where, how
some of those money that we
divert, how those
decisions get made. I know
there's a lot of moving parts with
those. So
you know, the stabilization
reserve has to be at 25%
for the money to go to the early childhood
trust fund. So it helps walk through
those if that's
um kind of confusing
because I know it is for most
people. So I'm here for
questions,
Mr Chair,
>> I've never heard of a decision
tree before.
>> This is what it >> looks
like.
I, I just, where do they
plant decision
trees
>> at the
LFC?
>> And where are they located
at?
>> Yeah, next to the money tree.
That's
right.
>> I I hope everybody
kind of paid attention. Look at the early
childhood trust fund on page
one, right. The info
this year is just 3.3
0.3
billion
and they're going to hit 10 billion this
year, right?
So we're really gonna have to take some hard
looks at at where we want
to move money
and a 10 billion sustainability
of 5%. Me and Charles just
did the math on
8 billion, but we didn't do it.
So, so
that would spin off 500 million
a year. So that's probably
tapped out for that agency
because 500
million a year for one agency
is a lot
of money uh
more than any other agency.
And so this
is a very busy, what did
you call this again?
>> It's technically called a Sankey
diagram, but
it's a flowchart
>> that,
that and the decision
tree
Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you Jennifer for your presentation.
And um all the
fancy new stuff in here. I
like it. I like to see
those, the
trees and where it's actually
flowing and, and it's uh
it's self-explanatory
uh easy that way for
me. Um One
of the questions that I have
is um
you know, we've been, the LFC has been
projecting peak oil and gas
production in New
Mexico
and how
will the
setbacks in your
opinion,
um
a affect
this uh will,
will it be production less
or how, how would it, how
would you think the setbacks are gonna
gonna affect
it? >> Mr
Chair Representative,
our work
um myself and
Izzy and Austin have
been working on this. We're gonna continue
working on it over the summer.
We've done some preliminary
mapping of
kind of the existing
well landscape
and our first
kind of pass at it was about a
10% of our wells
would be impacted by this.
We're working with the industry
to get their
actual projected
future. Well, sites beyond
what's been permitted. Hopefully,
that will give us a better idea.
But it's a nuanced
answer because
it's difficult to know how
the industry might respond.
Now, laterals can go up
to two miles. So
setbacks will not restrict
much of the oil that's under the
ground, but it might,
and it certainly will probably
affect how expensive it is to
get to that oil.
Um There's
capital allocation decisions
that these companies make where
they gonna drill, what makes the most
economical sense for them in their
bottom line. Um So
we're having more conversations with the
industry about where this might
hit. Um
It's, it's difficult to know
at this point. Um
but if it helps
currently active and
permitted wells, the buffers
that were introduced last
session, we
think about 10% of those
wells would be impacted.
We have some preliminary
um
kind of analysis
from producers
that in terms of
acreage, it can
range from 15% of
their acreage is impacted,
which means any portion of that
acre is within a
setback um
up to 40% of their
acreage. But again, that doesn't
mean that that acreage cannot
be used to get oil
out of the ground. Um
So again, it's a nuanced
question and I'm sorry, I don't
have a dollar amount for you
today.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you Jennifer for that.
Um, you know, if it's hard for
the LFC to
determine, I
can just imagine
the companies that are
being, you
know, forced these setbacks.
Um, you know, if this
actually passes in the
legislature, how are they
supposed to predict what they
can, what they can do
when they can do it? So, it's, it's
difficult all around
and, uh, the presentation that we had
Mr Chairman earlier
today,
um,
you know, there's, there's
no proven
data
and so I would just
encourage um
the committee to listen
to even if
it's not the data you
wanted or
you are expecting that we should
listen to, to
all sorts of data. Thank you Mr
Chairman. So the other one is
um you
know, oil production will come down on
its own over time
and if we push it down before
its po portfolio is
before our portfolio is
more more diverse.
Um
How do we suppose we're
gonna pay for schools
and roads and
capital outlay and, and
things of that sort? Do, have
you all been doing any kind
of uh analysis
on that?
>> Yeah, Mr Chair representative,
that's exactly what um
the economists have been working on in
conjunction with the budget side of the
office. Um On
page 17, you can see
kind of the impacts from
putting aside some of the
current peak production
revenue um
into a spin-off.
It's basically a trust fund,
but the permanent fund,
um you can see kind of the
reversal. So you can
see before Senate Bill
26. And this was, this is
the one that you guys passed in
23 that
caps the oil and gas revenue to the
general fund and puts it, um
away more, more
money put away than currently
just under the early childhood trust
fund kind of
mechanism. So you can
see on the left hand graph,
it follows the production
years, right? It peaks and then
comes down and our revenues are
right there with it.
Um You all
have reversed that
trend where it's in
perpetuity now
growing.
Um which is a
great thing.
However, I don't, we don't
know for sure if this is going
to track with budget
expectations. We have
some graphs, I can pull them
for you. We've, we just had them, I
think at the last hearing that
kind of tracks if we keep growing
budgets at 10%
6% 3% where
those intersections are and where
our revenues might not keep up.
Um So I certainly have those I can
pull them for you.
Um But the runway
is different depending on how much
is being spent recurring
and, and how much revenue is
continuing to grow.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr Chairman and
thank you Jennifer for
that. Um I just
wanted to remind
um the committee
15.26
billion with A
B
Yeah.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman
>> represented
Embry.
>> Thank you Mr
Chair.
Thank you for your presentation.
Uh What, what
I'd like to ask a little
bit about if I may.
Uh Mr
Chair is the oil and
gas conservation
tax
and it looks
like
that tax, which
as I understand it
is paid
on every
molecule of
oil or gas produced
in the state of New Mexico by
the operator
and is designed to
help reclaim and
reme remediate
uh sites.
So it
looks like in fiscal year
2023
that generated
$137
million.
Correct?
And only
27 million
of it actually
made it into the
reclamation
fund.
Um, so
100 and $10
million just went into the
general
fund.
So we have
heard a lot over
the last year or more
about an orphan.
Well, problem in the state
of New Mexico.
Um,
so there's $27
million from fiscal
year, 2023.
That could have been to me
137
million plus
over the next couple years, we're
slated to receive
$100 million
from the federal
government.
II,
I guess
to me
that seems like
the issue,
isn't
that oil and gas
companies aren't paying
this tax and aren't
there and the money's not
there. It's
just that we're diverting it
to the general fund
rather than using it for its
intended purpose.
Um,
so
I, I
guess
iii I
guess I just don't
understand why
it's not being used for its
intended purpose.
So that's
really all I had. I guess that
wasn't much of a question. Thank you,
Mr
Chair.
>> I'm not sure even how to
ask the question.
So I'll make my best
attempt, Mr
Chair
when we talked about House
Bill 253
and it says
that
we're going
to
cash out the available
severance tax bond fund
at the end of 2024
up to 500
million.
And I look at the analysis
of that in the, the
way the bill was
presented
and
somehow,
I guess somehow that slipped
completely by
me.
It's, it's, it's, I'm
sure it was presented to
me. I'm sure it was
presented in
perfect
faith.
But somehow I
thought we was trying to do a lot
of cash
accounting,
but this turns
around and takes all of
the cash
capital stuff and turns
it into
bonding for
the
future.
So II I find
it
a little bit
disheartening
on my part to miss something
like
that.
Not that, I mean,
it's signed and chaptered and
everything's done,
signed and sealed
delivered.
No questions. My,
my problem. Sorry
about that.
>> Senator Woods, we did that
because when we
do that diversion at
some point in time, New Mexico
is going to be able to do capital
in cash and
not have to bond.
So when we set this
excess balance
of up to 500 million,
at some point, we're building
that fund so
that we'll take the
revenue from that fund
and then do capital and
not do bonding on
severance
tax.
>> And I agree
that was,
that's the way it's going to be set
up. But
I also
agree
that it makes
$500
million
available
at the end of 24.
Right.
>> No,
it depends on the balance and
then it, it, it'll probably be
50 million at the end of
24.
It set New Mexico up. So
we're never gonna have to bond for
capital again. I
don't. Are you ever here? We,
we bother for capital.
So instead of us bonding for
capital currently, how we're paying
for our cash, we're taking
that money building a
fund, right? Saying,
here's our fund, here's
a dollar amount we're gonna generate
whatever we generate is gonna
be cash towards
capital. And is that
diversion grows,
then we'll be able to do everything with
cash
>> and with this chart that you
show on the page
19,
it is where you're showing
that in 25 we're
going to
use
10 million of
that.
Is that what I'm reading and
going up to
using
400 million
in fy
50?
Explain that chart
there, I guess would be a good
idea.
>> Uh, Mr Chair, Senator
Woods. Yes. So,
um, just to
clarify the
one time,
um, up to 500
million in fy
24 is
essentially capturing
excess cash
in the severance tax bonding
fund and using
it to see this new
capital fund, which
as the chair said, the goal of
which is essentially to diversify
revenues for the capital
program and allow us
to transition from
bonding to
cash. So the intention is
not to like start a new pond
bonding program. It's to
create a partial
replacement source for severance
taxes for the capital
program. Um The
fund was designed so
that it would start spinning
off distributions
immediately. And
that's what you're seeing in. This chart
is estimated distributions
available for appropriation
by the legislature
from the new fund.
Um And yes, they start
modest and then would
grow to be quite significant
over
time.
>> Well, this would be pretty good.
Can we hold ourselves to
that amount of
spending
for
Aine?
>> We'll have to ask the, what's
the tree at the back of the page? What
is that? The
friends?
Well, I have to ask the decision
tree, that question, Senator,
we, are you
done?
I'm Center
of Maestas.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
General Lady.
The
this flow chart
uh is the greatest chart in
the history of LFC.
Thank you for that great
chart on page
four. on
the average oil
barrels per day.
It's uh am I reading that
right? It's
1876.7
barrels per
day.
BBL is barrels or
what is
BBL?
Ok. So thank you. So if
you times that Mr Chairman times
365 that's
668
million barrels
in a year, which is just
incredibly fantastic uh
for production.
Um Couple
couple,
if you could look on page
nine,
these numbers uh
in terms of our effective
tax rate. These numbers were from
uh 2
2016,
that number of
584 million
in taxes. What is that number
now is
upwards of 2 billion, right?
I mean, it's pretty,
pretty high,
>> Mr Chair. I'm sorry, I didn't follow
where you were. >> That's fine. Thank you. I'm
sorry. No, no, my bad.
So Mr Chairman on page
nine, the
yellow line, New Mexico,
uh
you know, taxable
value taxes collected
effective rate 8.5
that is from 2016.
So those numbers are really low,
but the key is the
88.5.
Um
and I'm reading that, that we get
the state of Mexico gets
8.5 cents per dollar
of oil revenue.
And then you look on
page
five
of
and it says for each additional
million barrels of oil
generated about
6.9 million
uh in severance taxes and
federal royalty. So we got about
seven,
$7 per
barrel.
Am I reading that
right?
Is that all the taxes are just
the two taxes, the severance
taxes and the federal
royalties
>> so that the tax.
Yeah, if we're, if we're looking
at sorry Mr Chair,
if you're looking at page five,
that's just production taxes and
federal royalties, it doesn't
count the state trust land
revenue. Um because
that's not tied to
price or
production levels, it's agreed
in a contract. Um
ahead of time, it's
mostly bonus payments when
you, when you sign a lease with
the state. So it's
not, it
doesn't hinge on the
price or the production
levels as much as these others
to do. So
it's not accounted for when
we talk about if a
dollar, if you know, if oil
prices go up a dollar,
those revenues aren't affected.
Um
>> Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you,
Mr Chairman. So
the, so essentially
what I'm getting at is,
is what percentage
for every dollar of oil
generated. How much does the state get?
And that's, that number is
kind of floated around
8.5. I think
I've, I've been told it was 12 or
13. It's just tough
because there's so many different ways we
tax the industry.
So I think we should consider the
next couple, three years
taxing the industry in a much more
simpler fashion.
The there was
a, the gentleman talked about the,
the
um
the conservation tax.
Now it's easier to tax when
you tell the person you're taxing.
Well, it's gonna go to this
program
but the conservation tax
and the money used for that shouldn't
be contingent upon that tax.
We have money to, to
increase that, you know, to
increase, uh, the
conservation that we're doing
with regards to this industry.
So, uh,
lastly on page
seven
of
the ad Valium tax
and the production equipment,
ad Valium are those
local taxes primarily
and the state taxes are
the school tax,
severance tax and conservation
tax. >> Mr
Chair Senator. That's
approximately correct. The state
gets about 5% of
property taxes to
fund the GE O program. It's
1.36 mils. It's been
1.36 mils for a very
long time. So the
state gets a little share,
but the property taxes
are, the rate
is driven by the, the
locals and it's, it's much
more a local revenue than it
is. >> Thank you. So,
the, the three taxes we
collect,
we should consider at some point
just to impose one
tax that
that's, you know, equivalent or
so that the risk
involved in drilling is far
less today than it was when these
taxes were implemented. But
it just seems like it would be easier for the
industry, easier for the state if it was
just crystal clear
what percentage the state
received from every dollar
produced by oil. Thank
you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you very much
Mr Chair. Thank you. Uh
MS Fabian,
really excellent presentation.
Um The,
I guess a couple of quick questions.
One,
I was looking back at
the effective
tax rates that
goes, I guess that was work
that was done sort of
mid last
decade. Do
you think that there's been
sort of any significant
changes in other states
or is this, you're, you're pretty
confident this is sort of
done a while ago, but
very reflective of where we are
now,
>> Mr Chair
Vice Chairman Small. I think
it's fairly reflective. I
think we
need to update this analysis. This
was something we pulled
a while back.
Um I think
the tax rates, the
severance tax piece in particular
is a little bit less mobile
than say the royalty
rates. Um it swings
a little bit less because it's based on
percentage. So as production and
price goes up, the revenues go up
and people don't really feel it needs to
be adjusted quite so
frequently as maybe
the bonus payments or
lease.
So it's, it's fairly
consistent izz. He published this
in a brief last year
and felt pretty confident they
were, they were similar.
Um but I think it's certainly something
that LFC wants to continue to
monitor and keep more up to date,
especially now that we have three
economists instead of just
two. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you MS Fabion
and I that's super
helpful also very,
I, I take very much the
point, which is that again,
we're in sort of that
midpoint
of states
and even more
importantly, in a very competitive
place with sort of the
other, the other part
of this basin and the other
part of the Permian in Texans.
Um
The, uh
let's see, I wanted
to see
um
on the
Capitol side specifically
exciting that we took the
steps that we took
uh very much a
credit to the work of
LFC going back
even a Senate Bill six and
prior to that, which is really
helping us,
um me in
particular sometimes
work through how to get,
you know, really, how to see this
in ways that now
for the 20 thirties, 20
forties and beyond.
For the first time, we
can sort of
confidently say
our state is in a very
strong financial
position.
How do we continue to
do that? And is there more
work to be done on the capital
side?
Specifically,
>> Mr Chair, vice chair
Small? I think we need
to continue to look at our volatility
to keep doing volatility analysis
on both the severance tax
bonding program is this
fund growing the
way it needs to are the
revenues supporting, growing that
fund to spin off additional revenues.
I think looking at the general
obligation bond capacity,
it's grown a huge amount and
that's because of oil and gas.
Looking at that fund
and continuing to see where we can
cut volatility
across state programs.
>> Got it. Thank you. Mr Chair and then
final note
cutting that
one of the shining
stars for the entire
legislature,
I wonder particular as you
mentioned with, with
more folks
in places particularly
at LFC, but also in partner
agencies, can
we start to think about
the opportunity cost of
sort of the, the
benefit of that saved
dollar and its
payback over time,
particularly in our permanent
funds and
sort of some of the acute
needs, sort of the nicer things
as you put them. But
in some cases, you know,
water systems in
particular that
are, you
know, as
pretty close to life or death
and very much sort of
either you can live
here or you can't sort of community
by community. How
do we go into
some of that analysis to
sort of after
as we shore up places
as we build our stability
for the long term,
we also are
always asking that question
for these new
dollars.
Um Yeah,
what that opportunity costs might
be and where it's best
used,
>> Mr Chair, Vice chair Small.
I think it's a great question and it's
something I think LFC
as a committee and LFC staff
are constantly looking at the opportunity
cost of a dollar. If we put
that dollar in savings, you can't spend it
today on something that's, that's
needed. Um And
so I think working on,
it's great that LFC has both the revenue
side and the budget side
in one place because
we can start to compare,
um, you know, the long term
impact of putting dollars away,
um how that might increase spending
in the future versus right now,
especially when they, our reserve
levels are so high
and our new money is so high
where you can kind of do both right
now. Um
But I think that analysis is ongoing
and we do long term forecasting,
we do short term forecasting
that will be in August
or August and September
and we'll present both of those.
Um And I think it's just something
you as all as a committee have
to decide where to put
put dollars each year.
Um But we certainly will provide the
analysis as often
as we can um
to kind of show you
what happens if you put money
aside and then
it's kind of on the the budget
side to kind of look
at what needs
across state agencies and across
the state. Um
might need funding today,
>> Mr Chair. Thank you. That's very
well said, and it speaks to the
continuing need for
that technical capacity
because as you say, we're in a
very strong place,
understanding the revenue
and being able to ask the
long term short term
midterm questions. We're
in a financial place to do all
of it. Um
Probably our biggest
deficit is to have
the technical
capacity to say
here are the projects
that we can, we
need to do over the next
five and six and seven
year period.
Um That's where we can
continue to, to look for
ways to progress. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you very
much,
>> Senator
>> Padilla.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I know you come to me that
fast. Thank you very much. This is
amazing information
again, I'll echo Senator Maasa
comment. This is excellent. I think
it's one of the best ones I've
seen. Um
and it's all been great all along, but this
is really helpful. So if you look
at slide, um,
well, the one with the really neat graph
there in the beginning, I think that's page
three and it's the
$3.3
billion that will go into the early
childhood trust fund this year.
When will that fund
reach? Uh I
heard earlier, maybe
$10 billion in
value.
>> I would have to double check our
forecast. Um
I think I have it here but I'll have to
dig through the appendices and, and
see. Um, currently
the last investment report we put out,
it's sitting at 5.7 billion.
Now, I think by the end
of 2024
current fiscal year will be
looking at over 7 billion,
possibly reaching 8
billion
and will be close to
10 by
fy 25. >> This might put
us over the 10 close.
So the total cost
of the department is about
784
$85 million. I think
that's where it's at right now. Is that right? We have
predicted it would cost
800 million to provide these
services. But is that about right,
>> Mr Chair? I'm going to divert to our budget
director. I don't, I don't have budgets
on the top of my head. The
way the
budget office side
does,
>> Mr Chairman, we'd have to look
at the department's
finance plan
to see, but I think that's what you're referencing.
Is there their five
year finance plan of where they
think they need
revenue to spend
on a suite of early childhood
services. >> Thank
you chair and thank you very much, Mr
Sally and, and
presenter. Thank you so much. I mean, so I'm
looking actually at this, this year's budget
that we just passed.
It's uh page
86. If I'm looking
at this, right, it looks like
784
mil to provide these services.
As you know, I created that department
with a lot of very hard working other
members of the legislature and
we are almost there. We're about
two thirds of this thing funding
itself. So I just want
to caution everybody. We are very,
very close to actually making this
thing pay, you know, not,
not have an out outlay.
Um Do you have any idea?
And I know this is if you want to research
this and get back to me, I'd appreciate
it. But when do you, would
you, if we left everything the way it
is now, when
do you think we would get to the
785 or
whatever million? That, that's
what I really would like to know
because, you know, I'm with the
chair and others and I think that we
need to probably
pump the brakes a little bit on this
thing. Uh My
cosponsor is actually joining
the Senate. I want to congratulate hers,
Senator Elect Trujillo
behind you. She and I sponsored
this legislation to create this department.
So I'm glad she's coming back to us. Thank
you for coming back to. We can do smart work
together. Uh, but chair,
I can you can, you just do
some research and find out when this thing
would actually fund
itself based on where
things are or do you want?
Do you want to guessimate that? Now, >> I have
a little information for you, Mr
Chair Senator. If you go to page
16 of my presentation,
you can see
our outlook for the early childhood
trust fund distributions.
They're gonna shrink to zero.
We estimate as, as
of the last Craig, excuse
me, by Fy
27 we
won't be putting more money into
early childhood and instead
excess oil and gas will
go to the severance tax permanent
fund.
So,
and it, it it could continue
to get some revenue depending on
how those five year averages kind of
fluctuate. Um But
generally it's going to level
out and kind of decrease
over time. Um
whether or not that
funding level at the end of
the rope for early childhood
will be enough
to spin off the whole agency
needs. I'll have to
run kind of a
analysis on budget growth
versus these revenues
and, and see and get back to
you on
that
>> Mr Chair. So that, that's when
I think I will be able to
very enthusiastically
support pumping the brakes on this
thing. But it sounds like we're
already going to be putting this
in its uh in, in
its uh in its,
in its place, I guess
would be another term to use.
Um I guess in
what year did you say
we're going to stop putting money into
it for
additional money into it? >> Yeah. As
of our last forecast, the
last year is Fy
26 and it would only get
377
million. It's those orange
bars and then it
will cease in fy 27.
>> But it could
feasibly
through investment and good
prudent investor rules and
following those, it
could continue to grow over time
to hit this 785
million. It
should. But at the
moment, we probably shouldn't
tinker with it until it's played
itself out to
25 or 26.
Right?
>> That's a decision for you all. But
I think it's, I think it's in a
good, >> we love all the data
you're bringing us. I
just kind of want to walk
the committee through some of this because I
think it's very important that we look at
it from that standpoint before
we start tinkering with something that's
working very, very well
for us. We're
almost there everybody. So I hope
that we'll let this thing play itself
out and then let it taper
off into the, into the
sunset. Thank you,
chair.
>> Thank you to go back to early childhood.
We're not servicing more Children.
We're just servicing them at a higher
rate at a higher cost.
So they're getting more money. I mean,
the amount of money we
have would service every
child and we're declining
population and
the rate that they're servicing those Children
are, are growing
astronomically with. So
that's one thing to think about
before they hit the
780 million. Are, are
we servicing every child and
how we do that?
One thing I don't think we talk about
enough is inflationary pressures,
right? What's a dollar today? And what's a
dollar tomorrow? Those
are the hardest hit sectors
across the US right now is
inflationary pressures
as we move forward.
Are you gonna start calculating
inflationary costs in
in revenue
estimate?
>> Mr Chair, the Craig currently
already accounts for inflation
when looking at revenues,
um looking at
budget growth in the long run.
Um That's an
area I think we're exploring more
and doing long long term
budget outlooks um
as well because that's where it really
hits hits the wallet.
Um I think
inflation naturally
grows revenue but doesn't
naturally grow budgets.
Um So it is currently
accounted for in revenue estimates.
Um It's the other side of the coin I
think needs a little bit more
attention >> and I
mean, in, in the markets right now,
you're seeing everything begin to
slow, right?
Car markets are slowing,
vehicle incentives are going
up, right?
Um You're seeing a lot of
risk well, in in
during the primary campaign,
inflation was the number one issue.
And how do you control
food inflation?
How do you control cost
inflation? How are we
going to control that to the average
person? Right, but it has saying has
the same effect on the state
where I'm looking at the
NM right now, right? What's
their inflationary pressures on,
on,
on janitors and cleaning
supplies and in those
costs? Uh I
think New Mexico has kind of reached
the peak with its
budget.
We just did an A I
mathematical
equation and
we need 100 and
$60
billion to
invest in order to
maintain
$8 billion in
budget. Right?
And so as we move forward and you look at the
amount of royalties that
the federal, I don't remember what pages
on the federal
royalties
that are paid
out.
5.7
billion. I think the
feds get 2.7
billion in royalties,
right? And we get
1.4 billion.
I mean, we're relying more
and more and more,
right? And if
anything happens in this
one sector of the market,
right?
Everything, everything
can crash,
uh inflation
goes out of
control,
we capped. I
mean,
how are we gonna think
about
a scenario and
maybe you should run this for us,
right? With
a drop in production,
right? For whatever
factor
and could be setbacks,
it could be world economics,
right? If we saw
a 10% turn down
in, in
that market,
what the cost would be to the
state and how do we look at
that?
Can you run that scenario?
Yeah, >> Mr chair members of the committee,
we run that in the short term.
Every Craig, we have
a a production decline
scenario as well as a recessionary
scenario. That's on page
14, last
year, we started playing this
out in the long term as
well. So we're looking at a 50
year impact of
production declines.
And so we'll update that
in September
when we do the long, the long term
estimate.
>> And what number are you calculating
for inflation at that
rate when you're running these?
>> So it's built into the
Mr Chair, it's built into the
baseline assumptions that we
use for these scenarios. So
we use national
forecasting
um kind of subscription
based services
that will kind
of throw out scenarios
a 10% chance
of this recession
um will be it'll have
this inflation, it will have this
production level, it will have this
GDP and so that we
can run our forecast on kind
of an updated underlying economic
scenario. It includes
inflation.
>> OK? And
then a as
we get to the decision tree,
right? I mean, those
three questions are really the forks
in the road of where we want New Mexico
to go, right? Do we
want to take that transfer and start
looking at things? Medicaid
is going to be the biggest cost to the
budget this year? I believe roughly
100 and 50 million right
increase.
It's just a huge increase,
right? Just think 100
and 50 million just to to
medicate alone. So
we got to start thinking about if that's
the biggest cost to the budget.
How do we offset that cost?
Right by
investing, creating another
fund and
generating enough income for
Medicaid if that's going to
be our biggest cost as we go
forward
we got to keep
stability in the budget
center compost and a few of us are
around when we had no stability in
the budget. And
so that's a
big issue. I mean, to spend
a dollar today
doesn't mean it's gonna change anything,
but to save a dollar for
tomorrow means you
can save some things.
And I think that's a, that's a
scenario we really need to look at, we
pump money everywhere. I don't
know where we didn't put money.
Uh And
as we move forward over the last
couple of years, so this is the cautionary
tale, especially to agencies,
right? You've got
large increases
across the board.
We're finishing up our pay
study. I think
that number is going to come out to around
20 or 30 million to be
in the market.
So we're gonna have that
cost. And so
that will get us
every employee to a level where
they need to be at to be competitive
in the market
except I heard dot is doing
their own study and then we'll ask them
about that
tomorrow.
But we got to create this balance
from here on forward
because
I, I, I'm gonna say this and
I'm gonna keep saying it, we're
not a poor state.
We have plenty of money,
right. We're
relying on one source
of income and,
and we can't do that anymore
because if that goes away,
we know what happens.
And so how do we create that
stability and save a dollar
to today,
to save a dollar
tomorrow, right? Or
to save something that's needed
tomorrow. And
so,
you know, New Mexico needs to,
to change that
mindset.
We're not poor,
we're, we're pretty
rich. What was
our total? Uh investment
Charles, did we get that?
And IC
40 50 billion.
So we just need five
times that number and we can be
self-sustaining in our,
in our livelihood. I mean,
that's where you really want to be in the
market is right. If anything
happens, our investments can
save us and the
dollar amounts that we invest to
save
for the future,
especially with education,
right? And
those costs
um have
to, you just got to get
there. There's no
other scenario that
works. Uh
spending money doesn't
work, saving
money works, investing
in getting the return, keeps
everything stable and that's what we need
stability in New Mexico.
So
thank you, Senator Rodriguez. >> Thank
you. I may thank you Mr
Chairman. Now
that you mentioned, thank you
Jennifer too for your,
your great work.
Um Now that you mentioned
about returns and saving
and so on. I wanted to,
to elaborate a little bit on
house bill 253
which I carried in the Senate.
Um And I say
this only because those
of us that have been here for many
years, we've seen the
fluctuation
of oil and gas revenues,
um just come and go.
And there are some years we have
enough for capital
outlay. Some years we don't,
several of us have been in situations
where we have had 200
or so dollars for
capital projects.
Um Hardly anything
to even talk
about. And there are times
like recently when we've had plenty
of money uh for
capital projects for our districts
too. That being
said the House
Bill 253 if I may
clarify a little bit
here, um had
to do with our
effort to and this started
off here at the LFC
with our effort
to wean
ourselves from the
volatility of the
oil and gas
fluctuations
for capital projects
specifically. And
so how do we ensure that we can
keep if not the same
level of capital project
allocations close
to it as we've gotten used
to that right now with quite a large
amount, how
do we do it and still
maintain that level
ongoing on a permanent
basis? Well, the
best thing that we thought
about in the LFC
was to
um generate
savings
from the
investment returns
from the
funds that we're going to be
putting
away
for
specifically
capital outlay
projects, for example.
And I hope I'm, I'm confusing
things, for example,
instead of drawing every year
from the severance tax
permanent fund
and wondering what it is going to be
next year and what we're gonna
be getting for each one of our
districts and for the state
um state
capital projects
too, we thought we
could put away some
money from
the uh severance
tax, put it away
in to this fund,
generate some returns
and use those returns
as their compounding
to be able to eventually
have enough to
use that specific fund
for capital projects
and not have to draw from
the severance tax uh
permanent fund.
And uh that seems
to be the, you know, one of the
best ways we can,
we can do to ensure that
legislative members
and the whole state can
have enough funding for
uh for Capitol projects. But
one final
thing, Mr Chairman I wanted
to stress is that
part of this whole thing
is really one important
aspect that I think we're
forgetting that
is that we
in doing this bill
when it says we also
constrain future long term
debt and send savings
to the fund. What that means
is that pretty
big? By virtue of
the fact that we are not borrowing
money by bonding
to fund and
capitalize on our
capital projects.
We are actually using
funds that would already be
there in this
particular reserve fund.
We're not going to money.
It's going to be like using cash,
then we save
quite a bit of money. We saved
up to $80 million
just last year alone
by not bonding,
just using cash
reserve or the cash from
the general fund for capital.
And so I guess
what I'm saying is that this fund is
going to be building up
from different ways, not
only from the initial allocation
of the 500 million we
put in, we're
going to put in but also
from the safe of not
bonding and that that's
going to be pretty big. It
sounds confusing and I think it
is to some extent, but I,
I can see and visualize,
I won't be here starting January
1st as I have decided to
retire. But
I um I carried
the bill in the Senate and I
got to really delve into
the uh the numbers with
Kelly. Thank you, Kelly for all
your work. Um
So, um anyway, that's
all I had Mr Chairman for
now. Um Thank you
very much for loving
me.
>> Thank you guys for your presentation.
Appreciate your time
pajama
plan on finding a Deis
tree and cutting the branch off
of it, put
it into my office and see if it
works.
We're going to break into
subcomittee
just before we go. >> I just
wanted to clarify one thing we
got certainly people
who have been texting and emailing
at least uh
Chairman Small and me about
ozone and
I, I just want to point something
out. So ozone is a chemical
reaction.
Uh but
it, it, what triggers
it is sunshine and
heat and that's
why most of New Mexico
is high on the ozone
list uh
because
it's hot and the sun
shines and the places that aren't
hot, like the northern
mountains don't
have ozone.
So, but if you look at
across the nation, Los
Angeles Bakersfield,
Fresno, Phoenix,
Sacramento, San Diego, Salt
Lake City, Las Vegas,
Albuquerque, uh
Las Cruces,
El Centro. Those
are all places with a lot of sunshine and
a lot of
hot.
There you go. >> You
forgot
Yuma in Death
Valley.
So uh uh
let's break out in
sub-committee. That child
welfare sub-committee will be
next door.
Uh Senator
Shear, Senator
Padilla is gonna move in
there.
Represent Dixon
Armstrong and Baca
and Garcia on child
welfare.
You'll need to take your binders, take
your binders across
and then the water
sub-committee will be
here. Senator Rodriguez
is gonna chair that woods,
woods compost and
Chatfield
Sarana and Lente is not
here. Whoever's
and the and anybody
else pick whichever
one you want to go to
and
we'll have a quiz afterwards for
our visiting
members.
Thank you for joining us this
afternoon for this water
um uh water
sub-committee to talk
some more about water issues.
And Kelly, um I
understand you're gonna be introducing
the presenters um here.
So you've got one person next
to you. And then I understand Rebecca
rouse from the governor's
office will not be
here today, but
we do have somebody
coming in a little late
or
is running a little bit
behind. So
you tell us who this nice
lady is, Kelly
and thank
you and we will proceed.
Thank you. Ok,
>> madam, chair
members of the subcomittee.
So we're going to start out today with
a discussion of the potential
for alternative water supplies
in the state.
Rebecca Rouse, the infrastructure
advisor in the office of the governor,
couldn't be here in person, but she
is here to
present
virtually. So
you'll be able to hear her
and ask questions
and she's gonna start out.
Uh And then we have Doctor Stacey
Timmons, the Associate Director
of the New Mexico Bureau
of Geology, um
with New Mexico Tech. She'll
present second
um on aquifer
mapping needs
uh throughout the
state and
higher higher education
institutions. Um
Potential to fill
that research void. Uh
And then doctor Pei Shu
who is on her way
from N MS U.
Um She is the researcher
you all heard from in Las
Cruces last summer
on desalination.
Um She'll be here to
talk about research her group
at N MS U is doing
on the treatment of
produced water for
reuse. Um
So I think Rebecca
should be queued
up
and
ready to
go.
Good afternoon
>> everyone.
Yes, we can hear you,
Rebecca.
Thank you madam
chair.
OK. We will do that,
Rebecca.
Yes, I do. Do, do the
members have it? I see.
Nodding here. Yes. Thank you. We've
got
it.
Thank you very much, Rebecca.
Um I think what we're going to do
because the sake of time here
is here all the
presentations
and then we will
ask questions at that
time. So, um
thank you very much for that.
We are going to go
next to Stacy
because the
lady um
Xu is pronounced Xu
is a little late.
Is she, is she
here?
OK. Yes, we'll go to, we'll
go to Doctor Simmons
here or Timmons. Good
to see you again.
All right, you can
proceed. >> Thank you madam
chair and I'm
honored to be here for
this water subcomittee
there. She is.
Um So I
wanted to just uh call your
attention to the slides that
have a blue
bar at the top and a picture
of a building at New Mexico
Tech. That happens to be the New
Mexico Bureau of Geology,
which that was a fantastic mineral
museum and bookstore.
If you're ever driving through Secor, feel
free to stop in and
check it out. Um
So the Bureau of
Geology, I'm just going
to give you a quick overview of what our agency
is, what some of the roles of our
agency is are in
the state and then um get
into aquifer characterization,
both fresh and
brackish water and then the
kind of uh budgetary
constraints that we see
going forward at the pace needed
to um get this
done quickly and know exactly what
our water resources are.
So, the New Mexico Bureau
of Geology is a research
and service division of New Mexico
Tech and it
started in 1927
we serve as the
non regulatory state agency
working on a broad
variety of
um various
natural resource
topics. Um Looking
at slide two highlights
the different divisions of
our agency.
Um There's a
section on oil
and gas
and geothermal
carbon sequestration. We also
work on a variety of critical
minerals for the state.
We have laboratory
resources uh that
are uh
global in
nature and really
well known across
the country doing
amazing research.
Um The outreach and education
is also a really important part of what we
do. We do a lot of K through 12
outreach as well as books
and and products that help get
geosciences on the coffee
tables and on the minds of
our citizens.
The geologic mapping
program works on
geologic hazards and
seismological and
landslide issues. Um
Very helpful for planning
where roads and
infrastructure may go.
And then last but certainly not
least is the hydro geology
program um
that I will talk more about
here. Um In total, we
have 72 staff
at the Bureau of Geology
and um Doctor Mike
Timmons is behind me. He
is the director, not my
supervisor to be clear
um of the Bureau of Geology.
So he is the state
geologist.
So the
um slide three highlights
the three different programs that
are within the Hydroge
group at the Bureau of
Geology. This is the group
that I have the honor
of um organizing
and managing. Uh the
one I'm gonna be talking most about today
is ALCA for Mapping and Monitoring
Program, where we do a lot of
different types of hydroge
work where we do big
scale short term, long
term um looking at
groundwater level trends
across the state. Um
Our budget was recently
increased. Thank you very much
for your support to get that done.
We are now operating
at um 800,000
for our annual budget
um starting here in fiscal year
25. Uh The
Water Data Initiative was a
program we started in 2019
in response to the Water
Data Act um
that works on convening
uh all of our state agencies
who have something to do with water
data. And um the
Bureau of Geology is a convening
organization of that
effort. Uh So we're
collaborating with many
of our state agencies, the State
engineers' office, the Interstate Stream
Commission, the Environment Department
and EMD in particular are
named in the legislation
and that um program has
also had an increase in
its budget now to 500,000
annual. Um
and then the
water education program.
Many of you get emails
from me or my colleague, Kate
Leary inviting you to water
leaders workshops or river
trips. And we're
constantly trying to
help you guys get more
um information in your hands
about water in our
state. And I encourage you
to say yes when those
come into your email or
give me your other contact
info so we can get that information
to you. But that now has
a recurring budget of
250,000 that helps
us get information to our decision
maker in the state.
Um Moving on to slide
four, I just want to highlight the work
that the aquifer
mapping program works to do.
Um In general, we
work on characterizing
how much water we have. How
good is it? Where is it
found in the, in the
subsurface? And we do that using a
variety of um
specialized tools
uh and some not very
specialized but
geology, geophysics,
hydrology, and chemistry
kind of put all of these pieces together
to help us understand what
the groundwater looks like.
Um And as I said earlier,
we're a nonregulated agency.
We were the only one in the state really
working on this kind of specialized
multidisciplinary
um water research.
Uh The program officially
started in 2006 and
we've been working over the
last almost
20 years on a variety
of um state
federal, local
um philanthropic funding
sources. Most of the
time, our um
grants and gifts
are more than double of
what we have from state funding.
So that's how we are able to get
work done.
Um I just want to draw your attention
to the geologic map
on the slide
number
four which is
colorful and
um
got, it's got a lot of black
lines. Um The,
the important part of this
map is that the geology of New Mexico
is really quite
complicated. Um
When we see these different
colors, each of those geologic
units that are different colored
polygons on the map
represent different hydrologic
behavior or different geochemical
characteristics. So
the water that's found within these
rocks is not the same
across the state. Um And
when we look at a, if we were
to slice across the southern part of
the state, that red line that's on
the map, the
little slice
below in the blue
polygon is basically
what it would kind of cartoon
version of what it looks like in the subsurface.
So that just gives you a sense
of how
complicated
the hydrology
is in the ground beneath
our state. So um the
amazing landscape that
we have uh is
appreciated and it makes
it um beautiful on
the surface and sometimes a
little more tricky to understand in
the in the subsurface.
So moving on to slide
five, the
governor's 50 year water action
plan really put a
point on
getting some of the work done
that we've been aiming to do for many
years. Um
This work also, I think
encompasses many of the
water policy and infrastructure
task force recommendations
and also just acknowledges
that we're facing a crisis
in terms of our water here in New
Mexico. Um
I specifically
related to our work
um The new water
supplies as Rebecca
mentioned um category
B three,
our tasks under
that are to characterize
all the major and minor
aquifers in the state, both the
fresh and the brackish
water to do
this um with the major
aquifers completed by
2032
and then build a statewide
groundwater monitoring network which
is composed of 100 new
dedicated wells
and characterizes all the aquifers
by 2037.
So this is a pretty um
fast-paced
improvement of work that we
need to be doing um to,
to meet these goals.
Um So what does an
actual complete
aquifer map kind of,
what is it composed of
looking at? Slide?
Six. The,
the main things that this
work needs to encompass
is that we need detailed maps
of the geologic units and
the hydroge of those units.
So how does water move through those
rocks? What is the depth
to water? And
how does that change over time
looking at the, what is the
boundary of the aquifer? So we're thinking
about in three dimensional space,
what are the constraints of
that aquifer in any
place around the state? What are the
faults or other
structures in the subsurface
that might impact groundwater
flow? And where does groundwater get
recharged to those
aquifers. And then importantly,
what is the water quality in those
aquifers?
So the
things that we can start to
understand from that
as the
which way is groundwater
flowing? So is it heading
towards the mountains or the
hills which
which some
places it's higher gradient and
steeper? And then also
thinking about groundwater in storage.
How much actually do we have, can we
estimate that of volume? We
need to have this top
four list up
above thinking about
recharge and how
does um groundwater and
surface water interact
as part of this work?
Um And then really, I
think the the summary
of this is that we need um
this sort of improved information
so that we can better plan what
we're doing with our groundwater
and manage that groundwater
resource.
Um
So kind of diving into
brackish water and the topic
of strategic water supply
in general. Um Looking at
slide seven, I
think it's really important to
highlight that
we know quite
a bit more about our freshwater
aquifers and much
less about our brackish
water. Um We
worked on a study back in
2016,
funded by the
Environment Department
uh to really bring
together any and all water
quality data that was digitally
available. So a lot of that was
coming from the US GS
our Agency and the Environment
Department and take a
hard look at what, what do we know
about brackish water using all of
the existing data. Um
and many of these data
were from wells that are
existing. So usually
drinking water wells, private
domestic wells, irrigation
wells where there's been water
quality testing done.
Um The takeaway
is that we don't
have a whole lot of information
about our brackish water. The
graph that is shown
on page seven.
The important things to note
on there are that
um across the top
axis,
the
axis uh at 1000
mg per liter total
dissolved solids. That's kind of
the um place where we
start to think of brackish
water begins is about
1000. It could be upwards
of 3000
depending on how you want to categorize
that. But basically, we can
start to see that we have
um a
handful of points that are
moving in that direction of brackish
1000 to up to 10
1000 mg per
liter, total dissolved solids.
And then when we plot it with depth.
So how deep is that water
coming from? That's where
it's also really interesting. So
at 2500 ft
depth, we
see very few data points.
So that's a really important
point. That's where the State engineers'
office um guideline
is to um for
non potable water supplies. It
has to be greater than 1000
parts per million or milligrams
per liter total dissolved
solids and it has to be deeper than
2500 ft deep.
So you can see that
there are not very many data
points across the state in that
realm of beyond 2500
ft. Um and, and
really not that many
data points even beyond 1000
ft if you look at it in total.
So um there's a lot more
information I could get into
about this with
more time if you wish.
But there's also a Google
link that will take you directly to our
website that has uh
details about that.
Um I'm sure some of the next
slide is going to be covered by
our next presenter slide
eight. But there's a lot of
differences between
um seawater
desal desalination
and inland desalination.
Um And so those the treatment
facilities that are built
are quite different.
Um And we have to really know what
the chemistry is of our
groundwater as we're planning,
what a desal facility is going to look
like some of the big differences with
groundwater or that
the water technically typically
has high silica si
02 that can clog
up many of the treatment technologies.
We have different kinds
of salts in our water. So
it's not just sodium chloride
like we see in seawater, which
is somewhere around
35,000
parts per million milligrams
per liter. Um So tho
those waters in seawater is
usually sodium
chloride and AC L.
Land-based
DLL is gonna have different
chemistry and, and
across New Mexico, we have some
places where it might be N AC
L but a lot of places where it's more of a
calcium sulfate and
those molecules can be
um harder to
extract or they're bigger size
molecules that make treatment.
Um, a little more
tricky. Um A
lot of the places where we
expect to find brackish
water. Um One
concern is that it may not be
an endless supply. Some of these are
not being recharged.
Um There's also concerns
about where we put
disposal um, of the
concentrate that's generated
from decell treatment.
That is a geologic
question that we need to address
is thinking about as we
know more about the subsurface, those
that might give us some opportunities of
places to put um
waste to concentrate.
Um The other thing that I think is
important to highlight around
inland
land-based dal
is that the energy
costs can be much higher. So
drawing water from greater
depths can can obviously
require more water or more
energy. And the there
there can be variability in the
total dissolved solid. So it may not be the
same all the time.
So as you pump out the
water, some of that chemistry might
change a little bit over
time. Um The
figure that I have on this slide
which has colorful polygons.
That's some work we did compiling
data on the Pago slope,
the area to I
don't know which way is east right
now, but let's say it's that way up
the slope um heading toward the
Sacramento Mountains. This is kind
of our visualization of what we think
is going on in the subsurface there
using the water data
that we can get from um oil and
gas wells as well as
some water wells.
And so you can see that there is
potential for some saline
water in those
um deep,
deep subsurface areas
there. Um
So I I guess drawing
on to number slide
number nine, I think it's
just important to highlight some
of the basic information that we
need to
utilize brackish water.
We really need to know
exactly what the water chemistry
is. What is that quality? Because
that's how we determine how we treat
it. And where is it
found both, you know,
vertically but also spatially.
And that's AAA tough
question to answer when we don't have
a great detail in the subsurface.
Right now, we need to know how
much water is there, how
productive that aquifer is.
So as we go deeper,
typically, our aquifer
formations are tighter and it could
be harder to extract water from
them. So you might only be getting four
gallons a minute instead of what you
hope for or what you find
closer to the surface, which might be
hundreds of gallons per minute.
Um We need to examine
carefully how these
brackish water resources might
be connected to other
aquifers shallower
layers um or
to rivers and we don't want
to affect our compacts
by um affecting
flow that might be going toward a
river. Um And
importantly, as I mentioned before,
how, how that aquifer is
recharged or if it's
recharged um
And different water
chemistry may have different uses
for different um
applications and
waste disposal is a really
important feature to this.
Um
I think moving on to
slide number 10,
the just to kind
of give you a sense of what
kind of work we aim to
do with the aquifer
characterization aquifer
mapping effort
here. Um A lot
of it starts with compiling
the existing data,
um any data
from existing wells. So that
could be um wells
that are producing water or wells that are
producing oil and gas. A lot of those have
interesting information that we can
sometimes draw from. We
put together all the geologic
mapping, hydrologic
mapping or testing of
wells so that we know exactly how
productive an aquifer is.
There's a whole lot of different kinds
of geophysical surveys
that can be collected from
sky or land or
down hole. Um
some that's already out there and we can
pay money to um
reuse like seismic
data. Um
And then going out and um
and, and grabbing any data that's
available from geochemistry. And so we
put that all together into
a model that might look something like
what's there? On slide number
10, we put all the
points together and create this
um visual that helps us see what the
different surfaces are.
Um And what the different water
quality constraints are
and then what we
have experienced
thus far in a
project that we have already going
called 3D aquifer mapping
is that there's a lot of gaps,
like I said earlier, there's at
depth. We don't have a lot
of the information we might need
in greater depths. And
so what we would propose
to do is go out and start to fill
those gaps. Um So
drilling exploratory
wells collecting these
geophysical surveys which help
us see between the points of where
the wells are. We can start to
interpret using
geophysics. What's going on
between um adding
geologic mapping, measuring
a whole bunch of groundwater levels in
existing wells or in new
wells and then the
sampling that we need
to put all
together to kind of
refresh the
model. And then as
we go forward in future years,
that work would be to kind of
continue the long term
monitoring of it.
I'm getting there. I wanted to just
bring your attention to the
monitoring efforts around
the state. Slide number 11
basically has a map that shows
you where, where
the state is currently
measuring groundwater levels
with a consistent
regular interval.
Um Our agency
supported by Healy Foundation.
So philanthropic funding
helps us to go out and measure about
200 wells per year.
The US GS is
funded in large part by the
state engineer's office to measure
about 800 wells annually.
And those are
the red points are the ones that our
agency measures on this map and the
gray ones are the ones that are
this us GS uh
State Engineer's
office Measurement
Network. Um The thing
that I think is important to see on this
map is both that
it isn't spatially equally distributed.
We aren't covering all of our aquifers,
but also most of
these wells are somebody's
irrigation well or somebody's
domestic well. And so
these are not wells that are drilled
for the purpose of monitoring.
So it's important to
have wells that are completed all the
way through the aquifer so that we know
exactly what we're
measuring and
um have wells that are dedicated
for that purpose. So we're not happening
to catch the pumping signal.
So when that well's been pumping, the water
level is much lower than it might be
when it's not pumping.
So what we're suggesting
here going forward is to
build a dedicated
monitoring network of at least 100
wells.
Um
I think I've covered most of the
topics on slide
12. So I'm just gonna leave that
with you for future reading
and jump right. Into some of the
budget needs that we've
identified um looking
at slide number 13.
So first of
all, the
um reminder
is that we're aiming to
characterize all of the
aquifers major and the minor
aquifers by 2037.
Um This is moving pretty
quickly uh to
then also establish 100
new wells that help us
track changes. And those
wells are drilled for the purpose
of understanding
what's going on in the subsurface
um as well as then committing
it to monitoring later.
So the recurring funding need
at our um estimates
at this point is
that we have that 800,000
for this fiscal year going forward.
And we're seeking to get
to another 1.25
million um for
for FTEs uh
some software, some
project management tools
that will help us really um
pick up the pace and get
these um aquifers mapped
at the, at the time
frame needed. Um
Also nonrecurring
funding. This is the big one,
but I think this is um
spread out over 12
years. This is where um
a lot of that data
gap filling is happening.
So we really need to be thinking about
how we're gonna um understand
these deeper resources.
Um This is where
the um money
hits road. So the
175 million
is the concept that we have
and it's um over
about 12 years to
get to 100 wells and
detailed enough information.
So that we can more carefully
plan um
and manage our groundwater
resources.
Um So
the table
that's provided on slide 14
is conceptually what the
nonrecurring funding
could look like. Um
I kind of break it down
in that the first year is
intended to be in fiscal
year 26
where we would be
going through kind of the learning the
pilot phase of how we're going
to approach this. Um
and, and kind of working out
some of the procurement challenges that I
suspect this may have.
Uh So that's a big
part for the first
year and then in the subsequent years
leading up to 2037
really moving quickly
to um to
conduct the surveys needed
and set up the,
the wells which are,
as I said before
drilling for the purpose of understanding
what's going on in the subsurface, but
then setting those up for monitoring
uh for long term.
So that's how we kind of
broke down the
nonrecurring funding.
Um
ending us up on
slide 15. This is
kind of a recap uh
what we're seeking to do, which
is for the aquifer mapping and
monitoring program. Our
goal is to get an
additional 100
I'm sorry, 1.2
million in recurring
costs to the New Mexico
Bureau Geology. Um
We're exploring ways
to build toward this
175 million
over the next 12 years to
get to this uh full
characterization and monitoring
effort. The water
data initiative. We, we are
still seeking an additional
250,000 of
recurring costs. Um Not
really talking about that here
today, but we are considering
a grant program,
which I'd be happy to talk
with any of you about. The idea
being that many of our state
agencies working on water
data. There are some
specific tasks that they
could be working on and we could establish
a grant program that might help
us to get those those
tasks done over the next five
years. So that's something
we can talk about at a later
time. Um
Finally, our our bureau
budget request is
not 100% final
yet. We are still working that through New
Mexico Tech um and
then through higher education.
Um So for the water
programs, we're expecting a request
around 1.5 million for recurring.
Our agency total is
somewhere just over that probably
in the order of 1.85
million of
additional funding to the New Mexico
Bureau of Geology.
And then um
I am
open to ideas about how
we will work on this nonrecurring
um target um
funding for the next
12 years as well.
So just as a reminder, we're at
the Bureau of Geology,
New Mexico Institute of Mining
Technology, which is under
higher education. It's just sometimes
uh a tricky place for us
to be put. And that
is the summary of
alcohol characterization for you
today. Thank
you madam >> chair. Thank
you, Stacy. You
know why I mispronounced your
name earlier? I said Simmons
Doctor Sims instead of Timmons.
I know you Stacy. Thank
you and thank you for the great work you did
on that leadership
workshop. We have too
so much. All right,
we're gonna hold questions until
after, as I said, but
doctor is it
Shu Shu is here?
Thank you for, for
being here. We
knew you were a little bit late.
So we went ahead with the other
presenters. I'm glad you're
here. >> Great.
Um Madam chair and
the commission members,
senators and
representatives.
Uh I apologize
for being late
but it is such a great
honor to
present the
research on treatment
of produced water for,
for use at
New Mexico State
University and
at the New Mexico Produce
Water Research Consortium.
Uh My name is Pei
Xi. I'm a professor in
Environmental Engineering
at New Mexico State
University. I also
serve as a research
director of the New Mexico
Produce Water Research
Consortium. So
just to recap
about the New Mexico
produce Water Research
Consortium, it
was created uh
between New Mexico
Environment Department
and, and MS U
under the Produce Water
Act,
the goal is
to enhance the
fresh water
sustainability
and to support
the new economic
development with this
new uh treated
reused water
while we also need to
protect the environment
and the public health. So
the objectives of the
consortium are
to fill the scientific
and the technology gaps
for treatment and
the safe use of
the produced water in New
Mexico and also
to inform future
development of the
regulations and the
standards. Uh The
consortium include
six working
groups to coordinate
a robust education
outreach research and
development program.
In the working
groups include the
rigs and the
toxicology group,
data management,
infrastructure
treatment, public
education and
outreach and the state
produce water coordinating
Council. So
I want to
say that New
Mexico, New Mexico produce
water Research Consortium
is the only research
consortium in the United
States. Even though we have
Colorado, Texas,
they are produce water
consortium. So our
research is getting very
important because we
provide all the information
to the U SEPA
and even to Colorado,
to Texas and
then also for them to
make the science based uh
regulations. Uh
Today, I would like to
give you uh several
updates about the
states and the
status and the progress
of the produced water research,
including the new
updates on the produced
water characterization and
the toxicity study.
And also is it feasible
for us to use
the treated, produce
water for closed
system for industrial
applications? What would be
the economic
benefits related to it.
And also I want to
highlight some uh
survey results
regarding the public
opinion and support
of the produce water
use in New Mexico.
And then I will talk about
the future research
plan. And
if you look at the
slide number
four, that is
about the produced water
characterization and
toxicity study.
Because when we say
we're going to reuse the produced
water, everybody has
concerns about the water
quality. Is it safe?
Can you remove all the
contaminants? What
are the unknown count?
Right. So, through the
consortium and working with
the state agency like
U SEPA and
NMED, we
developed a list called
NP DS plus
list. It includes the
national uh pollutant
discharge elimination
system. All the list, we
also did a very
extensive um
literature. You to look
at what are the water
quality requirements for
beneficial use such as
for irrigation, for potable
use, for surface
water discharge. And
then it includes over
400
analys that we are
going to analyze to make
sure that uh that
we cover all the contaminants
in the NP DS plus
list. And
in addition to the targeted
analysis, that means we know
what we're looking at. For
example, benzene
radium and
ammonia, those
constituents. We also developed
the most advanced
technologies to
detect unknown compounds
because we say, oh how
do you know? So that's your list is
complete. So we use
very advanced analytical
tool called the the
liquid chromatograph
with OPI trap
mass spectroscopy
to analyze all
the compounds that are
present in the
produced water and the treated,
produced water.
Then we also conducted
the bioassay and to
look at the whole efluent
toxicity of the
produced water and treated,
produced water through
the different treatment
technologies on the
environment that includes
the aquatic organism
and also human cell lines
on plants and also on
the soil. So all
these efforts are in
coordination with us
CPA NMED,
the nonprofit
organization, environmental
groups, industry and
other stakeholders.
I want to show you an
example of
the outcome of
this research. The
next page slide
five is an
example of a
publication we
just published
in the journal of hazardous
materials. And
this is the top journal
in the in the world
about hazardous materials
analysis and
treatment. So
this paper talks
about non target analysis,
talk about the
compounds in
the raw, produce water
in the permian basin and
also after treatment using
the membrane distillation.
So we show that we
removed the majority
of the contaminants, but
we still detected some
compounds in
the treated, produced
water. And then
we look at their
predict their
toxicity of those
compounds. And then
through this unknown
compounds analysis,
then we can say this
compound is very
toxic. We can use
targeted analysis to
quantify the concentration
of those compounds. And
this study is in collaboration
with the U SEPA
because right now, there is
no standard method for
the non packet analysis.
But through the
collaboration with the U
SEPA, we
can ensure that the
method that we develop are very
robust and the best
available technology
for detector unknown
compounds.
The slide six also
shows the whole affluent
toxicity because you
may say, oh you still have
some compounds even though we don't
know the concentrations. But
how do you know this uh
this water is safe
for the environment and
for the
public health. So we
use the the environment
uh method uh means
to look at the impact on
the environment to look
at the impact
of treated water on
the zebra fish,
on the water fleas,
on the bacteria
and on the algae to look
at their toxicity on the
inhibition of their
growth. And
we also use
the three human
sun lines, those are
related to the breast cancer
related to the uh
the kidney
cells and the
colonies cells. And
then to look at if these
cells are in contact
with the treated, produce
water, are there any
toxic effect? The
good news is
through the treatment,
for example, for the Permian
basin produce water, we
use thermal distillation
to remove all the
salt and the contaminants.
And then if we followed
by Acti
granular activity, carbon
to remove the residual
volatile and semi volatile
organic compounds. And then
followed by zeolite to
remove ammonia,
then we can treat the
produced water to the
nontoxic level. We also
looked, looked at the
treatment of the San Juan
Basin. Through the
reverse osmosis technology,
we can treat the produced
water in San Juan Basin to the
nontoxic level. So that
is a very good
news.
But you may also have
questions, you know Permian Basin
is very big. How can you
make sure the water you
collected are representative
to the entire Permian basin
in the New Mexico. So
we continue to do this type
of sampling to do all the
targeted analysis,
nontarget analysis and
toxicity study. And
in the next two days, we
have a crew of seven
postdocs phd
students from N
MS U. We will go to
collect the samples for
two sets of samples
through the thermal distillation
and through the other reverse
osmosis technology. So
we continue to do this. Our
goal is to provide
the samples
as many as possible
and then to do all this
analysis and then give
the data to NMED
and then to other agencies and
also to the general public
for us to understand
is it safe to
treat and reuse the
produced water? But it
takes time, you know, for
all the analysis, we go to the
field, we do all the analysis,
it takes time for us to
analyze it and also to
interpret the
data.
So it will take time.
And then the next
question is,
do we have other options to
reuse this water? Right now, the
focus is on to
investigate if we
discharge the treated, produce
water to the environment,
what will be the impact on
the environment on the soil,
on aquatic life, on the
plants, on the human beings?
So it will take time to do the
research to give
a very robust
answer. But right now, we
also have industrial
applications. For
example, in New Mexico,
we are trying to do
the the
transition from
the petroleum industry
to the clean hydrogen
production to other new
industrial development
such as semiconductor
industry. We do the
photocell of
the PV cells
and other industry. We all
need water to generate
£1 of hydrogen.
We will need 9 to
£12 of water.
Where do we get that water?
I think the treated produce
water could be a reliable
water source.
So
the next page
page seven,
it talks about
the techno
economic assessment to
treat the produced water
in New Mexico from the
San Juan Basin to the Permian
Basin to meet the
industrial need for
hydrogen production
solar panel and the cheap
manufacturing and also for
the power plants cooling
water. And the
preliminary
economic assessment
shows that if
we generate about
1 million gallons per
day of the treated produced
water or 5
million gallons per day
of treated produced water
for the Permian
Basin. It will cost
about $2 for
1 million gallons per day treatment
facility. It will cost
about less than
$1.5
to treat that water
to meet the ultra pure
water requirements for,
for example, for hydrogen production
or for semiconducting
industry
and then for the Sun basin
because it has a lower
salinity. It may
require about
$1.5
to treat the water to
the pure water level.
And then that
will be for the one MGD
facility if we
expand the facility
to 5 million gallons per
day, and the cost will
be less than $1
per uh
per barrel.
And then you may say,
what is the disposal cost
right now? Through the delo
injection through saltwater
disposal wells, it's about
$1 per barrel
or $1.2
per barrel. So if we treat
this water, it is still more
expensive than the
disposal. But on the
other hand, think about the benefits,
we have the new water for
new uh economic
development, we avoid
the seismicity uh
possibility by
reducing the volume of
the produce water through the
saltwater disposal wells.
But we are still looking
for the options. Can we
further reduce the cost
of treating this water
for the economic
development for other industries?
So if we use
the new technologies, we
are currently developing such
as membrane distillation
forward osmosis, ultra
high pressure, reverse
osmosis membrane
brine concentrator. Then
we have the potential to
reduce the cost.
Another option is
collocating
the brackish
water desalination with the
produced water.
If you listen
to the strategic water
supplies, we're talking about
the brackish water desalination
and produce water treatment
and reuse in San Basin
and also in the Permian
Basin, we have the brackish water
if we can combine
both treatment facilities
in one location and
then that will reduce the cost.
The reason is for brackish
water desalination, we also
have the concentrate for
disposal. But in
this case, we can use the
concentrate, it's still
lower salinity as compared
to the produced water to blend
with the produced water. Then
the treatment cost for produced
water will be lower. Then
our goal is to bring
the treatment cost to about
$1 per barrel
So it will be comparable
with the saltwater disposal
cost right now and
also produce water is
not just a
hazardous material,
everybody wants to get rid
of but actually
produce water is a very,
very valuable
resource, not only
about water, but all
about the minerals in
that water such
as lithium that we
have found in the Sanu
basin and ammonia.
Ammonia concentration is very
high in the permian basin.
And the ammonia is a very
valuable mineral. It can
be used as a hydrogen
carrier for hydrogen
production or as a
fertilizer or for the
other industry. And we
also have the
potassium as a
fertilizer and
magnesium, calcium,
sodium and chloride
that we can treat the produce
water to recover all
these minerals as a
valuable chemicals
that will offset the treatment
cost. So
we have, you know, a lot
of ideas, a lot
of research currently is
ongoing. I don't know if
uh Professor uh Huiya
Wang is here, he's
leading on the lithium
recovery. And that is
in collaboration also with New
Mexico Tech, uh the research
at New Mexico Tech and
we are also recovering the
ammonia from the produced
water currently
that is updates on
the research. I also want
to show you some new results
about the public
uh survey because
public education and
outreach is very important
for the consortium. And
also for N MS
U, we have published
over 30 peer reviewed
publications since the
creation of the
new Mexico Consortium.
And then we
published the six
podcast series to
talk about the different aspects
of the produce, water
treatment and reuse and
management. And we are very
grateful that
Representative
Small Gave also,
you know, participate in the
podcast for the general
public. And then we
organize public meetings,
gave presentations
and also we organized
special conferences
for the professional
societies
um between
the 2022
and the 2023
the consortium
uh conveyed
a series of public
survey events
utilizing the opportunities
of the state fairs in
Albuquerque,
Farmington and
uh Artesia
Las Cruces and
Roswell. So
the N MS U postdocs
phd students, they go to
the state fairs
including the volunteers
from the consortium. We
gave surveys to the general
public, ask them to fill
out the survey and
we have about
657
valid surveys through
the state fairs.
Um The next page
shows the
results of the
public survey.
This is just a very brief
result. Um The
question is,
would you support the
use of treated produced
water to
um conserve the
use of New Mexico's
freshwater supplies
if the water is treated
and regulated to
standards that
prove to be
safe, to use and
protect human health
and the environment.
So, out of this
657
services, we found
that
61%
shows the support
for use of treated,
produce water within
the on gas industry. So it
is good. And the
61%. The
same percentage
support the use of
treated, produce water
outside of the
on gas field. So that is
very good. And
even 65%
of the general public
support the use
of the treated produce
water for agriculture
uses. For example,
for the non
edible crops like
cotton and
53%
of the public support
the multiple agricultural uses
such as irrigation
ranch, land restoration
and livestock
watering and
even 41%
support use
this water to supplement
drinking water supply.
So only 5%
of the general public say
no, we don't want
to have any reuse
of this water.
So that means
95% of
the general public in New
Mexico, they support
different types of
beneficial use of
that treated, produce water
if we can demonstrate that
water is safe to
reuse. So I
think that is very
encouraging and
about 25%
of the public show they need more
information. So
that's what we are doing. We are going to
provide more information
to the general public and
also to
the regulatory agencies
and the stakeholders. That
is our future research
plan. Our future
research plan is to
continue to conduct pilot
demonstration projects to
treat the produced
water using the
integrated treatment train.
It's not only say, oh
I use thermal desalination
that's good enough. Actually, we need
to think about the pretreatments,
the desalination processes
and the post treatment to
polish the water. So the
water would be safe and
the nontoxic. And also
we are working on the resource
recovery to recover
lithium ammonia and other
chemicals from the produced
water. Then we
continue to collect
the samples for the water
plants and the soil
to do the targeted analysis
to know all the quantified
contaminants in that in
those samples. And also to
do the non target analysis
for those compounds,
unknown compounds. And
then we will do the whole
affluent toxicity test
to evaluate the impact
on the environment and
public health.
And also we want to do
two more new research.
It is related to the fate
and the transport model
of contaminants in
soil and groundwater.
And another
research area is
to conduct the Human
House and the environmental
risk assessment
to assess and minimize
and manage the risks for
fit for purpose, reuse
actually, these two
areas we have already
identified but we
did not have the funding to do
it. We are very grateful
for the LFC
to give us the funding for,
asked to do this type of
research. Because uh
between the May
13th and the
17th, there was
the public hearing from
the W QC C, the
Water Quality Control Commission.
And then we had
about 10
hours of cross-examination
of the research activities
at the Consortium, New
Mexico produce Water
Consortium. And then
based on the feedback
and the comments from the
public hearing, they
identify these two
areas that they
want the consortium to
continue. So
these are our research
priority areas.
We just do not have the money to
do it. But with your
help, I think we will
continue to work in this
area.
And our future research
plan also uh
continues with
the publications because
nmed asked us to
give the results in the peer
review, the publication
form and we will continue
to work on it and then we will
continue to engage the
stakeholders and the general
public in our
research. Um
Another very important goal
is workforce development
because since the
inception of the consortium,
we have over 30
students, uh postdocs
phd students and
graduate students, undergraduate
students, even high school students
participate in our
research. So we will
continue the public
education program.
Um With that, I want
to thank all the partners
to support us
including Mr Mike
Hightower. He is the
Director of the New Mexico
Produce Water Research Consortium,
all the consortium members.
And I also
want to acknowledge
N MS U leadership
team including Clinton
to help us to
do, to get all these
opportunity to talk to the
legislators, to let you
know our research
and also the faculty,
postdocs and the students
at N MS U
especially I want to
acknowledge the support
we received from the
LFC and the
state agencies.
I put several pictures
of last year
when you visited N MS
U and I did not
put your face. I put the
back. So you
may recognize who is
who here from the those
pictures. So uh
I am very, very
grateful for the support
from the state because it
is not only important
for us to do research,
but it also provides
the leverage funds for
us to get new funding
from the federal agencies,
including the US
Department of uh energy
from the U SEPA
and also from the Bureau of
Reclamation. With that,
I, I want to thank you for your
support and I would
be happy to answer any questions
you have. >> Thank
you, Doctor Xu. You are
amazing for sure.
I've learned a lot but
hardly much
because you know so much
more and we
appreciate you coming to
educate us and to
uh to um
talk about in depth
about these issues. Thank you very
much. We can go on
now, uh, to
the committee members for
any questions or comments
they may have, uh, only
because we're running short of
time, but we appreciate all the
Stacey. You too. And,
and, uh, who was the
other person? Of course, Rebecca.
Yes. So we're going to go
first to Representative
Chatfield. You had a
question, representative and then
we're going to go on to Senator
Woods and
I don't have anyone else on
my. Oh, yes, there's some back
there. Thank
you.
>> Uh
What are
these
very
old?
Um
I'm gonna water
not,
I also,
I believe that we can take
that water a mile away from the,
take
the amount of
marium.
Yes.
Ok.
A the
that
>> I'm sorry,
you want me to do that again?
>> As long as I don't have to do
that
again,
>> it would be interesting to
know how much
interaction there is between the surface
water and the, and the
older or the saline
below because I believe
there is some interaction
and you all probably
know better than I
do. And,
uh,
so I think that's something
that's important. It's important to
understand. And
let's say
you
>> madam chair and
representative, I think that
that's a,
it's an important part
and that's kind of encompassing what
I have been proposing to do is
we're drilling holes
and licking in the subsurface
is collecting that exact
that we call them environmental
tracers. There's a
variety of them that we can
use. Um, carbon Proin
is another one commonly used in the
archaeology realm. Um
Tritium is one that kind of helps to
see the more younger waters
and then there's a whole bunch of
other categories
that we can use for very, very old
water. Um, it's been really
interesting. We've, we've done some
research and I had a map
in my slides that
I threw out at the end
due to time, but
it basically talks to that
point about how much
um from the samples that we have
so far. Um There's a
whole lot of deep water
that's quite old.
Um And somewhere in the
age, you know, around 20,000
years old that we've been able to, to
date with carbon 14.
And what happens is then if
we find any tritium
in that water sample, we know if it's
got some recent recharge and then
potentially connected to
surface water. And so
once you start combining these
different environmental tracers,
you can get a better sense of
the multiple
different flow paths that are
interacting in these deep
sub surface aquifers.
And that's a the important part as
we're thinking about the
long term sustainability of
these aquifers. If they are
20,000 years old with
zero tritium in them, we can
say for certain that there's not
much recharge or
any recharge happening there.
So that's an important data feature
that we should start collecting
all across the state and, and
encompass within what I've been
proposing here. So, thank
you for that >> question.
Thank you. Thank
you
>> madam chair. May I add
on as
well? So
recently, New
Mexico State University
received the funding from
New Mexico Environment
Department to
take the
samples from the
brackish groundwater
aquifer and then to
characterize the aquifer
regarding the water quality
and also to develop
the treatment
technologies to
estimate the cost
of treating that water.
And then we have been
in collaboration with the Bureau
of Geology. We talked to
Stacy and also
Office of State of
Engineers. And then we will be
happy to collaborate and
then to look at the dating of
the aquifer and
also regarding
the produced water samples,
we will be also very happy to
share the data and then
if we can get more information
about the age of the
aquifer.
>> OK. Thank you very much for
that. Um
Did you get your question answered?
Representative? Are you
done?
Thank you just didn't
want to go over you here. Thank
you for you're always so patient and
kind. OK. We're
gonna go on to um
Senator Woods and
then we've got Representative Susan
Herrera and then Representative
Scott.
Yes and representing
Sinara. OK, Senator
Wooz.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Uh My question,
my question has to
do with,
uh,
right
now
the brackish water
we don't, you know, you're talking
about, uh,
uh
Professor Stim,
we're talking about how much
money you need
to research
the different
aquifers
to see where that brackish
water is.
Do, do we have the
known spot
of the, the, and what,
what I'm asking
for
is under the
50 year or the
strategic water
supply,
uh, was to
create
100,000
acres of
new water by
2028.
Do you know of a, a
place that we can
pull that much brackish
water out right at
the moment,
uh, to even
treat,
uh, without doing
a lot of research
and, and, and
spending money to drill
wells. And
where are we at right now? I
guess I'm asking on your,
on your,
on your
mapping.
>> Sure. Um Madam
chair and, and Senator
Woods. Uh I'll, I
will start that and then I'd love to see
if, um, Becca Russo I
think is still on, may have other
comments to add to that at
this exact moment. I don't
have a like
gold pot of
what pot of gold of
a water that I can point to,
to say first certain
this is the spot to
start. Instead, I
might also
suggest that we
flip that and say, where do we need
100,000 acre feet or
5050 or, you know, kind
of think about it backwards
and say, what are the
drivers? What are the
economic development centers that
need this amount of water? And then
we would go out and start
that exploration right now. We're
working on a project with, with
doctor Z and others
um at the state engineer's
office and a number of other
consultants and researchers in the state
focused on the Santa Teresa
area um and
out by Las Cruces
to look for an
alternate supply there.
Uh And this has been a
project where I think the expectation
was that we would just go put
a well in and start pumping brackish
water and build the dal facility
and boom, we're done. Um
All of this I think
is highlighted
how little data
we have in certain areas. And so
there's maybe a handful
10 wells in
this very large region around
Santa Teresa that we
can really say um
draw some information from about
what we think might be there in terms
of brackish water. But what the next
steps require are some sort of
surveying geophysical surveying
and then drilling these exploratory
wells. Um It would
be, in my opinion,
quite a waste to
build a decal facility,
assuming that water is there and
assuming that the productivity that
you need is there um without
doing that exploration. So I think
that that's a really
um key step
in this whole process is to do
some of that exploration
drilling, which isn't a water, right?
It's just, you know, drilling
and seeing what different
formations you hit and how productive
those aquifers are and exactly
what the water quality is.
And to
Representative Chatfield Point, the
age of that water as we go
down. So
those are, it's an important
>> question.
Yes, yes, you
may.
Thank
you.
But
now
thank you. Thank you,
Rebecca >> Senator. Did
you have anything >> else >> to add?
I do have one more
question, Rebecca
on, on your
part
and we know we're gonna
have to
change some
laws in
order to use produced
water out of,
out of the oil
patch.
Have you got a pretty good
idea of the,
the wordage? Have y'all drafted
anything yet
to what we need to
change the Produced
Water Act
in order to do
that? I know you
were talking uh rewriting
some rules.
But have, have
you thought
about the Produce Water
Act and, and the language
that we need to put in
there?
>> Uh madam chair, Senator
Woods, appreciate that question.
And I would offer that.
I spent more time thinking about the
Produced Water Act since you all
passed it in 2019 that
I'm care to admit.
Um So
on that point though,
um
you know, I'm not aware of
any statutory changes that would
be needed in order
to set forth
a clear the clear
statutory authority
for the state to
advance these
types of treated produced
water reuse
applications.
What the produced Water
Act put
into law
in 2019
is a requirement
that any entity
that uses
treated, produced water for any
purpose outside of the oil and gas
sector has to do
so through
um regulations
established by the Water Quality
Control Commission.
Um in,
in line with the
State Water Quality
Act and
um with approval from the New
Mexico Environment Department.
And so, um the
regulation piece that
action B two
is about getting
the regulatory frameworks and
components in place
to fully
uh implement
the authority that already
exists.
Thank you.
>> And, and with that
Rebecca, I noticed
that we haven't passed rules
for that yet.
Um
Are those rules being
promoted
as we speak?
Are they, they come
before
the,
I guess the Environmental Improvement
Board is where that would have to
come through or is it
the,
the, the, the
Strategic
Water?
Uh
anyway,
water >> Control
>> Commission?
>> Yeah, the Water Quality Control
Commission madam chair Senator
Woods. Um rulemaking
is underway. The
um environment
Department has the
authority and obligation of
the produced Water Act
to
put the rules forward to
the commission
petitioned
the Water Quality Control Commission
late last year to
initiate the rulemaking process
formally. But prior
to that had done
um extensive
work with the stakeholder
group and
the public to
prepare their draft
rule that they proposed
to the commission. The
commission. Then their process
is to hold a hearing of rulemaking
here on
the proposed rule from
the Environment Department.
And that
rulemaking hearing is what
Doctor Yu uh alluded
to a few minutes ago
happened. It
initi it started
in May. Uh I
think the second week of May,
it ran for a whole week, five
days. Um and
they did not finish the work
during that period. And my understanding
is that so it was sort of
postponed and had to get
calendared again for an extension
that rulemaking hearing will continue
in early August.
Um And
that rule
petition and the
content of that rule
is um in
part a no
discharge
requirement. So it's
baking a
prohibition of
discharging
treated or untreated, produced
water outside of the oil field
into the regulations,
but then also creating a pathway
for non discharge
applications,
which is where we could see
some um
opportunities in
the rulemaking structure
to complement
the Strategic Water Supply
program proposal
for non
discharged uses
of the treated produced
water. And
so in August, we
expect that rulemaking
hearing will conclude
and the commission will
deliberate and
arrive at some decision as
to do um
what they will or will
not adopt out of that proposed
role. There's
further rulemaking.
Um that's a bit further
out no petitions by looking
at to formally launch it that
deals with other aspects
of water reuse
in the state. Um But the
one that's really clearly tied
to where we are at this point in time
on produced water, reuse
outside the treatment
and reuse outside of oil and gas.
And we're looking
at the hearing
that started in May and should conclude
in August. Thank you madam
chair. >> Thank you very
much, Senator Woods. You
have another question or you want
to follow up on that
one? >> I would
like to, I would like to ask a
question to Dr
Zoo
about
your research.
You've done a lot of research
here and you've, you've had fair
review of a lot of that
research.
Have you been in touch?
I mean, are you
also
involved with
the rulemaking process? Is
this research being
used over
there? >> Yeah.
Um Madam chair
and Senator Woods
um for the,
the objective
of the consortium is
to provide the information
for the science
based rulemaking
and the water policy.
Uh So we
have already submitted
all the peer review, the
publications including
the journal papers,
um and also technical
reports published by
Doe and also
Wr I
and the, the uh final
project uh found
by the consortium through
the testing, we gave all
the information to
NMED and
it's also published
at the consortium website.
So for us is
to provide the information
and regarding the
rulemaking, it will
be uh depend, it will
be the decision of
nmed. And also
W QC
C
>> I want to thank you very much
all of you for your
presentation.
Um
It seems that we need to put
some more water, some more
money towards the water,
so to speak.
Thank you, madam chair.
>> Thank you, Senator.
Ok, we're gonna go
on to let me
just call the order here.
Representative Susan
Herrera, then representative
Scott, Representative
Sarinana and then
Representative Maestas and
repres and rep and chair
small.
Thank you. So we'll
go to Representative
Susan Herrera. >> Thank
you madam chair. And I would like
to thank both the chairs of
this committee uh for
putting this uh hearing
together. Uh
When they presented the bill
last year on the Strategic
Water Supply, I felt
like it was kind of a, a
prayer and a promise and I thought
we needed a little more than that
to go on. Uh
I used to work for the Alano
Foundation and I had a board
of directors that were scientists
and their motto was
saying, God, we trust all others
bring data. So
I would just like to say, it's
very nice to
have some data
at this meeting. It's
deeply appreciated. And
I, I also want to
thank N MS U for the
leadership really
in, in the study of water in
this state. It's, it's,
it's just really what
we need. I represent
a district in the north.
That's about the
size of Massachusetts. And
we have no information
on the aquifers in
our state. I funded,
I funded Stacy
Timmons Group to
do aquifer
study uh for the
last three years. And we're finally
getting in the, you know,
some, some beginning
data. And I really
think that's what we need for the whole
state if we don't know what we
have, I don't see
how we can plan for the future.
I, I really don't. So I
would, I fully
support uh, your
recommendations in
the, in the uh
aquifer, um,
data studies
and, and we just need to
see what we have and I, in my
district just,
just to tell you,
they basically took all the
surface water in 1908
and 1938 and built
three dams and that all comes
down to the south. You're
welcome. Um
On the other hand, we really
don't know what we
have in our aquifers.
Uh We, we know we have
some of the most beautiful
clean, deep aquifers
in the state, but we
really don't know what,
what's happening with them,
how fast they're being depleted
and what's going on. And
so, um
I, I
guess I, I,
what I don't understand
uh and, and if we can make produced
water work, I'm all
for it. I really am. I,
I would like to know how,
how much uh
let me, let me just make
sure I say this right.
But what
is the total
amount of produced
water, how
much, how much um
produced water right
now uh is being
recycled
in the oil fields?
I mean, how, how, how much
water is that we talk
about the future but I
just want to know currently
what's happening with produced water.
Now.
>> Um Madam chair
and representative
uh right now
we generate
about
250,000
acre foot
of water per
year and then
about um
60% I
think is injected.
Uh Either
um
Sorry, I should take it back.
I have exact data,
I can pull it out,
but this is maybe um
my memory a little bit
blurry is
um
uh all the
water right now
is injected
either through
the uh the saltwater
disposal wells
or it will go
through this um
the enhanced oil
uh injection inject
to the ground to enhance the
oil. And about
10 to 20%
of the water is used
for the hydraulic fracturing.
Right now. In the past,
a lot of fresh
water and brackish water
was used for hydraulic
fracturing. But right now
more and more produce
water is used for hydraulic
fracturing. And
um the
supply water that
we can use is
the water disposed
through the saltwater disposal
wells or it
is the, and the
water that is
currently transporting
from New Mexico to
Texas for
disposal. And
I can find out the
exact number in,
in a few minutes. I can provide
it to know how much water
we have. >> That's probably close
enough for me. I'm just gonna say
thank you. Thank you for that.
Here's another thing and I
don't, I don't see anybody
talking about this, but I'm just
curious, it seems like we
have, you know,
water
stove pipes
in, in, in the state
government. You know, we have,
you know, the state engineer's
office handles this and
you guys handle that and the
environment department handles
this and, and then at
the local level, I, you
know, I have a seia, I have like
41 a seia, I have
42 mutual domestic
water associations. I think
I have about nine
watersheds and then I
have city water
systems. None
of these people ever talk
to each other at the local
level. I, I'm just
telling you that and I know we did
those regional planning
districts that we're talking about, but
I know we didn't really fund them.
So that's not happening.
So I'm just curious
if either of you were
in charge of water
in the state, how
would, how would you organize
departments so
that so that
people could make
decisions
that they wouldn't have to check
with 20,000 people
to, you know, make sure
it's ok to
move forward. I, I just
think I just think we
need to reorganize
how we do water in the state.
I'm curious about
that
>> madam chair and Representative
Pereira. I will
take a stab at that
and only
kind of two points on that I
think
um I, I don't
have a pro proposal for
how to reorganize the entire
state water systems, but I do
agree that um
siloed agencies
are not ideal
and I have actually seen
tremendous improvement in the last
five years myself in terms
of coordination and collaboration amongst
the agencies. My
perspective is
primarily from the Water
Data Act. And as that act
passed, we have had to communicate
more regularly and help each
other out to learn new
ways to manage our data and integrate
our data. So that's a really,
um I, I think your
point about the local
entities not necessarily
having opportunities to interact
or being driven to do so
um comes to my second point, which
is just, I, I believe that
we're in this process right now
with the Strategic Water
Plan and the re envision
of regional water planning
where this is the time
to engage and this is the time to
really get folks
to the table. And in those
conversations, I believe
we could go to the Roswell one
this evening. Um If anyone's
interested to get involved
in regional water planning down here.
Um But that, that is a space
where um these groups
can and should come together and
voice their opinions and their thoughts
about where water management
should be and, and maybe that's a
space to kind of brainstorm ideas about
how uh agency
interactions could work better.
Um I'll think
about that further
and uh perhaps come
back to
you in another venue to,
to brainstorm more with you
on that. But thank you for
that question. >> Thank
you. Thank you very much. And
representative
co chair small had asked
to weigh in. Can you please
chair?
>> Thank you madam
chair. I just wanted
to share. I had
been in contact
with Director Fug or
Deputy Secretary
rather
this was related
to
represents
question at
what Director
Fusions shared is
that since October
2020 33.8
billion gallons of produced water
being used in completions
essentially reused in oil
and gas. Um
anywhere uh
you know, say sort of
low 25%
up to 50%
plus uh of
that would be direct
freshwater say would have
been freshwater that have been
used. So, uh the
estimate sort of a conservative
estimate,
190
or 8 to 17
million gallons of freshwater
being saved.
But as was explained
right now, sort of
as you go through all of that
cycle. Ultimately, madam
chair,
um
it's gonna end up in
a the in a saltwater
disposal. Well, at the end of
the, once it's gone
through a whole lot.
>> Thank you for
that.
All right, I said it,
Representative Small.
Are you done? Oh, >> I had a
couple of quick questions. >> Go
ahead. >> Great. Thank
you madam
chair.
Uh First
Doctor Timmons. Great
presentation. Thank you very
much. Folks were super
excited to see, you know, in the
house, we had the 600,000
recurring for the Water
Data Act, but it seems
like there's just a significant amount
more needed.
How important is it
that you get that money
early? That is if
that money is able to flow
sooner for a lot of the work
that you're outlining,
do we just sort of,
you know, can we, is
it a linear benefit that
is sort of things
continue at a pace or are you
able to potentially scale
things up, return
data across the board
for the state on a on
a much more rapid pace?
>> Uh Madam chair and Representative
Small, thank you for that. Um
I would say
the, so our kind of
vision for this has been to
build the staffing capacity
in house first. So to build that
that recurring base budget
so that we have the
people that have
the skills to launch this
effort, it's going to be a
highly collaborative process
in total to do this.
Um We've looked at how California,
for example, has been working through
their um aquifer
mapping, essentially, it's
a research team for
multiple universities and state
agencies. And so we expect
that we're gonna have to kind of scale
that direction.
Um But having people at
our agency to help manage. That is
the first step in that process
in terms of the nonrecurring costs
I would um expect
and, and kind of envision that
it is definitely scalable. And we're
gonna have to, as I put
together in that table, that first
year is going to be kind of figuring out the
process and who are
our vendors and contractors
that are going to help us get certain
aspects uh
completed.
Um But, you know,
thinking about the timeline and the
urgency of our water, I,
I really,
we, we have done
this basically
since 2006 on
about $200,000
of state funding,
250 depending
on the year. Um And it's
just not enough
to fill in those data gaps.
We, there's a lot that's unknown
in the subsurface. It's um,
so I think that that's
really, yes,
it can be scalable and,
and with, you know,
maybe a million dollars, we could
really get started on the first
aquifer characterization.
We have one
proposed currently that
we're kind of working up
towards for 2025.
So >> that's thank you,
Doctor Tins and madam
chair, Dr Timmons. I really,
as you did credit
repave
who worked a whole
lot in this
also reps of Chatfield. I know
many others. But
um, the,
I guess
a larger sum
earlier, sort
of a larger commitment filling
the vision that you're setting
out. Seems like
it would be of
a sort of enhanced
benefit that as you
identify contractors
as you sort of
staff up to do work
and scale up to do work,
the larger the commitment
that we can do
uh over this
sort of upcoming time
frame, the
more you will be able
to return back to the
state on a quicker timescale.
Is that a fair sort of way
to see it? >> Yes, madam chair
representative. That's, that's >> fair. Great.
That, that's awesome. Thank
you madam
chair and this is for
um infrastructure
director Roo. As
we, you know, there's
we're answering
questions and
working on the strategic water
supply.
Why
sort of look with the
strategic water supply
even as there are,
as we sort of all acknowledge
that there are still questions that
we need to
answer
if you're still. Thank >> you,
madam. Oh,
sorry. >> No, that's it.
Thank you.
>> Ok, thank you madam chair representative
Small. Um
Yeah, I appreciate that question
and I think it's a really important
one for us to make sure it doesn't get
lost in uh
the robust
presentations uh from
from the full panel.
Uh The short
answer is because
we know enough
and to get
started and to
get started safely and prudently
with the right gar rails and the
right policies in place and
the right structures. Um
And we also need
to keep studying and
researching. Both these things
can be true at one time.
Um And so what
the governor
and the Environment department
envisioned with the strategic
water supply
is standing up
a process to again be
a an accelerator and a
driver
of,
of development of
brackish water treatment
facilities and produce water treatment
facilities in the
associated
potential matchmaking
to end users
that fit those
uh goals
and targets that I talked about
earlier around clean energy
transition, diversifying
our economy with advanced
manufacturing.
Um and the
strategic water supply
program
would put
the onus on
the private sector
essentially to
demonstrate in
a proposal to
the environment department
to
enter into an advanced market
commitment contract. It
would be the private company or
companies that would be
laying out
um all the
who, what, where, when how
of how an individual project
was gonna work,
including the
science, the economics,
the citing of
the treatment and potential
citing of end users
and um and the
quality, the water quality and their treatment
technologies that they'd be using.
Um And so the guardrails that
we're putting in place doesn't mean
that we're um
skipping
over the science and
research that is still all
ongoing. It means that we're
building on the science and research that's
already been done
and we're
taking prudent
forward steps
to advance these
technologies sooner,
meet some of our economic
development goals
sooner without
stressing our freshwater supplies
in the near term. And we've
got to keep
investing in
the research and the science
on both the produce
water treatment and reuse side
that you heard about from Doctor Z
and about the aquifer
mapping and
characterizing all the brackish and
freshwater aquifers that you heard about
from Stacy Timmons. I
hope that answers your question.
>> Thank you, Director. It
really does. And I appreciate
that very much because that,
you know, there's,
um, you know, our
neighbor to the east
here in Texas,
uh, of, I think
we can fairly assume
that sort of
left to their own
devices, even as they
use our science, Mr
chair and all of the
research, they may
go too fast
without sort of that
uh care and caution
that you're describing and that
Doctor Shu has already
described. And so
with us being
able to stay sort of in the
driver's seat accelerating,
but doing it always with an
eye towards building on
science building
from science and with a
clear eye towards safety
um is
super compelling to
me. Uh
And uh I think
sort of Mr Chair, Dr
Xu, obviously very familiar with
the work, appreciate
that there's seems
like an increasing
um uh
awareness
of the leadership that
you and your team help provide
internationally.
Frankly, Mr Chair, I love
seeing the collaboration between
the the experts who
are there on the panel today.
Doctor Timmons, Doctor
Xu, uh
Director Roo, of course,
over the phone, this
shows sort of,
you know, there is no, we
we have as good of a starting
team, we have as good of a team
as exists anywhere in the
country. We've got
to sort of support our
team. And that really
brings me to the final point. This
comes back to you, Director
Roo, with the
50 year Water Pan
plan published
with sort of this comprehensive
vision with our research
institutions so well
represented? Uh
Is it your sense
that you know,
we should
consider a billion
plus uh
all the way up to 1.5
billion maybe
in sort of a
comprehensive
potential
water
focused investment as we look
towards the next session.
Do, does that
seem too aggressive or does
that seem like uh
with all of the components
that we have really
sort of the, the space that we
should be considering where it's, then it's
not choosing
one part of
this equation, one aquifer
versus another. Rather, it's
saying we know
enough to fully get
started. We've got
the team in place that will lead
us. It'll be a long
process to get all of the
information, but
now is the time to invest
sort of across the board when it comes
to
water.
>> Uh chair,
uh madam chair and
representative Small.
It, it's a great question.
Dare we say the million dollar
question. Um I'm gonna
talk about that a little bit more in the
next pel uh
coming right up. Uh
And, you
know, I feel like we're in that
ballpark, but I, my
feelings aren't what we need and
we need something more
concrete than that. And we're
working on that and we're working
toward that what
level of investment
building on the the
really meaningful investments
that the legislature and state has made
in recent years on water.
What level of
additional investment is really
needed to see us
through the
next few,
you know, the next decade, I'd say
a critical
action to
secure our water
future in
um when, when
we're facing uh
50 years out the climate,
the climate science says
we, we should expect to have
25% less water.
So yes, we need to be
investing more. We I
I appreciate
your question and the
big thinking that is kind of
inherent in there in terms
of how big a number do we need to be
going for? Let's talk more about it in the
next panel. I'll elaborate a little
bit further there. Thank you, madam chair.
>> Sounds great. Thank you. Thank you very
much madam >> chair. Thank
you. Um Also
present a small, ok.
We're gonna go on to Representative
Scott and then
Representative Sarinana
as I said earlier,
Representative Maestas and then
of course, our chair Munoz,
but I have to ask
that we keep our
comments or questions
responses short only
because we're running out of time. And I
want to make sure everybody gets a chance
even if it's for some
time and not as much as we would
like. But Representative Scott,
can I go to you next and see if
we can move it? >> Thank
>> you. >> Thank you madam chair,
Dr Timmons
up have
spent a lifetime,
producing, produced
water.
And I have to view
all of these
presentations
with a healthy dose
of skepticism.
And here's
why
would it be fair to
say
that we can have no
discussion of
fresh water in the
state
without
including
the
nature
consumer,
which is
agriculture. Would
that be
fair?
And
the model
that agriculture in this
state requires
today
is that freshwater
be
free
except for
the cost to lift
it, which
is with today's
technology
minimal.
Now, with respect to
produced
water,
we've got 6
million barrels a
day of
this
very
salty water
in the
Southeast.
And we can't
reduce
that volume
without creating
a solid
precipitate
except by about
half
plus or
minus.
And to be able to do
that,
all of the
information that I
have been privy
to previously
said that by the
time you recover
your capital
investment,
a profit,
the operating
expenses and
the disposal of that
very significant
waste stream
that you still have.
You're looking at
somewhere
between four and
$5
per
barrel.
Now, Doctor Zoo, I see you
nodding your head.
Yes.
So the question
becomes,
who is going to
purchase
this very
expensive,
incredibly
expensive
water as
a consequence of these
activities,
>> madam chair and
Representative Scott,
when you talk about 4 to
$5 per barrel
of the treatment cost.
That was also I
heard in the
2019 when we started
the consortium. But I think
with the technology
advancement. The cost
is actually crazy.
But I also agree
that for the
agriculture, irrigation
water farmers, I
used to have just
inexpensive water, basically
free and the produce
water is still expensive
if we use it for agriculture
irrigation. Even though we
are working
with the
tax to look at
using the treaty produce
water for irrigation, look
at from the toxicity
standpoint.
But uh regarding
the end users, uh right
now, I think uh for
the new industry,
for example, hydrogen production
industry, power industry,
they all have the interest
in the produce water.
The reason is they need the
new water
to support their development.
Uh Nmu right
now is working with
the hydrogen production
industry to convert
the produced water to the
ultra pure water for
them to use. And then
we are also working with
the um the
energy production industry
to treat the water for
cooling. I think uh
probably if we
can reduce the treatment cost
to about $1 per
barrel or even a little
bit higher, there is
the economic incentive
for those new industry
to use that
water.
>> Well, hydrogen
production grain,
hydrogen production
out of electrolysis
is a whole another
conversation.
But even that
process today requires
about 1.5
kwh
of energy
inputs for
every kh
output.
So
those those
processes do not
exist,
cannot exist
without some
sort of continuing
state
subsidy.
And my fear
is that
we are creating
policies and
processes here.
That will require the
oil and gas industry
to be flush
forever
in order to
continue
subsidizing
the creation of dollar
a barrel freshwater
and
whatever that equates
to in the
form of
hydrogen.
At the end of the
day,
it is significantly
expensive,
completely
uneconomic at this
point.
And
I believe we run the
risk of,
of diving
into
uh
a money pit. If
you will, with
state dollars, that will
not
ever be
reconciled.
Thank you. >> Thank you. Thank
you very much. Yes. Thank you,
representative. All right, representative.
Thank you, Representative
Sarinana. First of
all, I called her Sarinana and it's
not Sarinana. It's, it
is
Sarinana. Thank
you. Yes. Thank you for being patient
too. You've been waiting a long time.
Thank you. Thank >> you madam chair.
All right, Doctor
X.
Do you think there's, are
we close to a point where we don't
have to use freshwater in the
extraction process?
I know there's that level
where we don't want to contaminate the
freshwater. That's why we
use freshwater and
then fraction and produced.
Are we getting close where we don't
have to use freshwater?
>> Yes, I think we do
not need to use freshwater
for extraction or hydraulic
fracturing because
for hydraulic fracturing, we
can adjust the
chemistry and then to
use the produced water?
>> Ok, great. All right.
One more question, madam chair.
Um For doctors,
does the National pollutant
Discharge Elimination System
list? And
current water quality requirements
include standards for all
contaminants that may be found
in produced
water.
>> Madam chair and
senator. Really good question.
And so for the
NP DS class list we
developed, it includes over
400
constituents. Those
constituents are
regulated through
either NP DS or
the um drinking
water or in the
New Mexico State. We have
all the regulation, it's are
included and then
for the uh produce
water
and we are looking into,
we hope it includes
all the constituents that
we can detect in
the, in the permian basin
and in the San Juan Basin.
But we are also looking into
the unknown compounds
right now. What we want to
do is to make
a link, for example, to
understand the correlation
between the um
the non targeted
analysis or the compounds
not to regulate it yet.
And then what will be the toxicity
effect in correlation
with the whole effluent toxicity
test? Hopefully, we will get
more understanding on that
question. >> Thank
you, madam chair. Um
This is for uh
infrastructure advisor
routes. Um I'd
like to understand the
strategic water
supply.
Um the
ideas behind the strategic water
supply a little better. What is the
number you mentioned of
unused brackish water based
on
and just to add on,
does it include any of the shallower
brackish water that is being used
by various users
currently.
>> Uh Thank you, madam
chair Sarana.
Um Nice to hear from you.
I I
would say, ok, so when
we, when we calculated that
number, um around the
time of the announcement, um
we were working with
um in the governor's
office in the Environment Department
with a number of experts across the
state looking at the
um level of
rubbish aquifer
research and characterization that's been
going to date. Um
This is really
a um I
guess uh
from some of our experts
based on
um what has what
studies have been done to
date. Uh It could
be um
I think what we actually put in the press
release with the announcement, a
representative was 2 to 4 billion
your feet. But again, that is an
estimate um
derived from
some of the studies and research
that's been done. And madam chair,
I would welcome
Stacey Timmons to add
if she would like
to any more specificity
to my answer,
>> madam chair representative,
I would just add that, that
I think is inclusive of deep
and shallow brackish
water resources. And
it is a back of the envelope
best estimate
as far as I can tell
based on the data that's available,
which as I explained earlier
is limited in some
of the deeper.
>> Thank you. All right.
And this one is for um madam
Chair for Stacy really quickly.
Um So the 175
million over the next 12 years to
cover gaps would
cover both brackish and freshwater
aquifers at shallow
and deep levels. We're
talking about the strategic water
plan. Is that
correct
>> madam chair representative
that
well? So it covers
a characterization as part
of the governor's 50 year water
action plan and it
covers
characterizing whatever we
can get about brackish water as
well. So in areas where
we perhaps want to
utilize brackish water, that's where
we would start pushing deeper
wells to try
to understand more detail
about. So I think it's
encompassing of the strategic
water supply and could be
driven by
priority areas that we
focus on. So yes,
the funding should cover
that aspect
of data and
mapping. >> OK. And
so you might have answered this will, this
also ensure we know what
groundwater below 2500 ft
may be connected to shallower
aquifers and we'll
be able to and will you be
able to say with certainty that we're
not impacting shallower
groundwater that
currently that's
currently being used
in surface waters,
>> Madam chair and representative,
that's the goal. Um
As hydrologists,
there's sometimes this feeling of
hesitation to say
with certainty. Um
We put together
the data, we
have, you know, drill
holes here and there and
we estimate between those
using geologic mapping
and intuition to some extent
and these geophysical surveys.
So my hope is
that by actually
investing and
doing the data collection and filling
these data gaps and building the models.
We can answer that with
more certainty that
we will not and we should
not. I mean that that's the whole point of
putting together these models is that
we aim to not
impact shallow freshwater
aquifers and surface waters. For
sure. >> Great.
Thank you. Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you very
much.
>> I want to, >> you
know, um Rebecca, we're
gonna have to move on only
because I ran out of time
and I still have two more on
my list. So I'm gonna have to do
if I have time here at the end,
I'll go back to you. But let
me go first to
our patient legislator
here, Senator
Momma Estas.
>> Thank you madam chair. And with your permission,
madam chair, I want to take a moment to
recognize the interim
president of Mexico State
who's joined us,
Doctor Monica
Torres
and a and a quick question
madam chair. I think I know
the answer but
uh Doctor
Timmons, so the administration is not
seeking a bill,
no statutory changes,
merely an appropriation with
language in House Bill Two
regarding what you want to
do.
Correct,
>> madam chair and Senator.
I think that
that could be
one approach to do this.
Yes. So our our
funding request will go
through HED
and then
if this is approved tucked
under House Bill two.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair. In other
words, it's an appropriation you're seeking
not a statutory change
and, and you would seek
a one time
appropriation
that would last 12 years
madam chair or you or you want
us to do it each and every
year for the next 12
years,
>> madam chair and Senator. If
there is capacity to do
one time appropriation for 12
years, that would be ideal rather
than having to go back each
year. I am
not, I'm a hydro
geologist and not a
financial budget
LFC expert. So
I'm kind of hoping that you all
will help me frame this
up in the right way. >> Thank
you for that madam. I
think
recently we've done one
and two year appropriations obviously with
capital. It's three, but
I think it would be a, an
appropriation
for the fiscal year. And then
we would convince ourselves
that, that it's a good
dollar spent over the course of the next
decade. Thank you, madam
chair.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much,
Senator Maestas, Senator
Munoz chair. Thank you for being
patient. >> Thank you. I
just kind of wrap this up and
Rebecca, I mean, the
executive branch has got to show
up at these meetings, the
Environment Department. I
nerd, I, I don't think we invited. I
nerd, I can't remember. We did it,
we did, they don't show
up. We're talking about
water policy in New Mexico,
right?
And the governor had a water
bill at the end of the session
last year.
Nobody had any definition.
What was really gonna happen. We're
trying to determine what that
is. But if the
agencies aren't going to show up, we're
not gonna know what that is.
If they don't have any
policies and if
they don't have any rules,
we're not gonna make any
progress.
That's a clear fact to
me and this is not
a 50 year water plan. This is a
six month water plan that they're
probably gonna try to introduce in the
60 day.
So, I mean,
there's a lot of work to be
done, but when we don't
have these agencies here, but they're
gonna have a cocktail
hour in Las Cruces on July
7th about
the state of the science
symposium.
And we're sitting here spending
our whole day talking
about water and produce water
and how we're gonna handle water in New
Mexico. I mean, it's
pretty sad that we're
not getting the movement from the
executive that I think we need to
see
to get these answers and, and
to get, get
people in place and, and
decide where we're heading in New
Mexico.
I can tell you in, in my
area we spent
a billion dollars or maybe
1.5 billion on the
Navajo
pipeline supply, right.
All the infrastructure is
there.
If we would throw Decell plant
in there,
then we could fill that
pipeline immediately and
not use river water.
They did it in Almog
Gordo
with a Decell plant,
am I correct? They're, they're about to
come online with, they're
just waiting for piping, I think.
Right. El Paso
has one. I
mean, at what point
are we going to get caught up with the rest
of the world to, to
get some of this done? I mean,
you're gonna have a 50 year plan, that's
fine. But 50
years is not gonna, the, the
water problem in the desert and we've
seen that over the last couple of years.
So Rebecca,
my, my advice
to you and them is
if we're gonna come back
in September
and we want
to see policies, we want to see
rules. Uh we
want to see if we're gonna have statutory
change. Um
We're gonna have to have a clear cut
plan as we head into the session and
start making budgets if
we have to
do a, a million dollars a
year for them to plan for
their brackish water
levels and, and
determine what's there and,
and produce water,
how we're going to clean up to what standard
and at what cost and where
is it gonna go? I mean,
produced water can probably be used
in many different ways. I mean, you
can put a data center
in and use it for
cooling. That
is very quick turnaround,
very quick, high use,
creates a few jobs in the end,
quite a few during
construction. So
there's one use, but I
think the executive has
got to get on
board and get
ready if you want to do this because
we struggled last year in the
Senate trying to get
that bill anywhere and
somewhere and it came out with no wreck
and nobody can make a
determination, but
rules and policies have to
be set. So we know
what we're gonna do when we get
there and
understand what's gonna happen
because we have
the money to fund it. We just
got to figure it out. So, thank you
madam
chair.
>> Thank you very much and
I just have a quick question
before I have to end here.
And Rebecca, I'll go to you
because I wanted to
see, do you have a dollar
amount that you will be
asking this next
year uh for the
strategic water supply
uh that you're talking about so
we can start looking at
the uh budget and what we
can expect. You asked for 500
million last year, but I don't know if that's
the same this year
or tell me a little bit about it as
quickly as you can because we're out of
time. >> Sure.
Thank you madam chair and
thank you to Muniz for your comments
as well. I will pass
that along and I can assure you
the executive looks forward to
many more engagements
with the committee and other
members throughout the interim
session. Um
uh
Senator
Rodriguez, um
the for now,
we're still aiming
toward 250
million a year for two
years for to reach
a 500 million number. Um
but that is subject to
change as
we see the results of
the feasibility study,
which is going to include much
more detailed market analysis and
economic and analysis
on potential projects
and what the actual
money of money set
aside for advanced market commitments
would need to entail
in order to make the program
effective. And
so we're still
for the time being talking
about that $500 million
number. But as we get
further in the interim session,
it very likely could change because
we will have um even more
robust data. Thank you.
>> Ok. Thank you very much,
Rebecca. We are going
to um move
on because we've got
another. I'm looking at the next
item here. Give me a second,
Charles. Where are
we
the the 50 year water
plan? Ok. The panel. Yes.
Thank you very much. Let's
move. Let me see
where I'm at on this
agenda,
>> madam chair. I'll just do
a quick
introduction.
Um So behind Tab
F and your binders,
you have some bullets
from staff
as well as a just front
and back spreadsheet.
Um updating you on the status
of major nonrecurring
water related appropriations
to
NMED
and uh the Office of
the State Engineer and Interstate
Stream Commission.
Um in this next
panel, um you will hear again
from Rebecca Roo as
well as Hannah Riseley
White, the Director of the
Interstate Stream Commission
on implementation of
the 50 year water plan in the
Natural Resources
agencies. Um
the status of those water
related appropriations
and um short
and long term water related
funding needs. And I
think Rebecca is going to start
whenever you're ready.
Rebecca.
>> Ok. Yes, Rebecca. Thank you. Thank you
madam >> chair.
Are you ready for me? >> Yes, you can
proceed,
Rebecca.
>> Ok. Thank you. Um
So we have
Hannah and I together
have um
about
uh seven substantive
slides. We will try to move very quickly
madam chair and you know that
we are short on time this afternoon.
Um So I'm gonna skip
over some things and
in, in the hopes of any more time
for members um
to ask questions on
pieces where you'd like to take a deeper
dive. So let's go in
to slide to
um we could talk
for a whole day
about what's in the governor's
your water action plan, how
it was developed. Um
What we're intending to do
to, you know, distill that down
in 10 minutes means we're just gonna hit
some broad strokes. Um
Hopefully you all if you
haven't yet had a chance to read
the plan. Um I hope
you have the opportunity to do
that. The um there
are some hard copies there in the room
that Director Welie White
brought um and you can
access it online then as
well.
Um It, it's a pretty
quick read about 20
pages and
a lot of pictures in
the really trying to
be accessible and
steer us in the right direction
as opposed to get all in the
weeds of how every
program will work
and all the work
that's been done to date. There's not
a lot of historical information, but it
is absolutely based on a
lot of work that's been going
on. So, slide
two in the presentation
has the science and policy
underpinnings.
Um The main
takeaway for a
very quick and dirty
presentation is
that the um
scientific study that
the Industry Extreme Commission
um
convened through
the Bureau of Geology
and Mineral Resources at New Mexico
Tech several years ago,
brought together experts,
they compiled
the best science
that's available um
about
what will happen
with our water resources over the
next 50 years
and focusing on
everything from um
hydrology and river
systems and aquifer
systems to
water quality impacts
and upland watershed
health and,
and you know, how are how
the science about
temperature and
drought and
um the
water cycle will change?
And that tells us that in 25
in 50 years, we should expect
to have 25% less water
available in our rivers and our
aquifers. So that
frames
the the
task, right? If we're
looking at our water programs
in the state and our water resources
management um
policies in,
in place today, what
do we need to do to
address a
world in New
Mexico, a a
reality where we have
25% of water.
And so let's go on to
this slide. Three.
Um I said that
the plan doesn't
go into depth
about lots of
other um work and related
efforts, but it has
absolutely built
on other work
that's been happening around
the water, right, settlements and
real advancements through
leadership at our state
engineer on
um moving forward
uh water resources
management and,
and equity and for
tribes nations,
Pueblos and
the Water Security Planning
Act. I won't mention
all of these. You have a slide in front of
you. Um Just incredible
work that's been going on and of course,
the work of the water
policy and infrastructure task
force convened
in 2022
to um put
the put forward 17
recommendations with over
100 different
actions
like call the action for the
state. And that work
definitely um and fully
informs the the
final 50 year water action
plan.
And uh it
was a very collaborative process
as well over several years
with engagement with
um tribal partners
and water experts
and community members,
Asias and others across the
state.
On this slide, four,
it is from the underpinnings
to the actions themselves.
So this shows
you at a glance,
the 11 priority
actions that are delineated
in the 50 year water action
plan. There are three
buckets and the
11 actions organized
into three buckets,
water conservation,
new water supplies and
water and watershed protection.
And uh
in each, each of those
actions has its
own page or part
of a page in the plan that you
can read in more detail.
And for each one of them,
A one B
two C
two which is protecting our
surface waters. You'll
find the same kind of
format as you go through the
plan, a brief description of what
the action is immediate
next steps. It's our call
to action in 2024. And
2025 to get
moving, maybe
building on existing efforts
and accelerating those
maybe pivoting, maybe
doing something that we weren't even,
haven't even started doing in the state
on a particular action.
Um So
those immediate next steps are key
and very focused
on getting us
going as a state
and particularly with,
with work within our
executive agencies.
And then the third component that
you'll see for each action is a
man dable target,
which is what we call the return
on investment for moving
forward with each action.
Um And so there's
we, we
hit many
of the priority work
work areas around
water in the state in these 11
actions. There's
some things that aren't
explicitly covered
here. They're still
incredibly important
and ongoing work like
implementation of the Water Data
Act that you heard about from states
tenants um
because that's mature
and, and moving it needs more
funding. Yes. And it,
and we need that data to
address many of these other
actions. Um
But we did try
to focus in on
11 actions
that are
critical and,
and needing further
attention and
momentum.
And so uh
earlier, I think
Representative Scott brought up
the agricultural sector
and the fact that
most recent data we have
shows that 75% of the
water is um
that's consumed in the state of New Mexico
is consumed somewhere in the
agricultural sector.
Um So um
a action, a two
has some more specifics
on what do we need to be
doing to create more
voluntary adoption
of water conservation
practices and approaches
throughout the agricultural
sector. Um
to make sure
that as we have less water
in the future, we continue
to have a thriving
agricultural sector in
the state of New Mexico.
I don't have time to touch on each of these,
but I wanted to give you broad
strokes and of on
um what you'll find
if you take a deeper dive
into the,
the next slide slide, five
is a snapshot
of ongoing and
implementation activities
that are in play right now
as we speak. Um
So there's, there's 11
actions are
owned by
one of five different state
agencies or entities
that are listed there on
the, at the top of the
page.
Um And so those
and five agencies
have specific
responsibilities to
move things forward in the 50
year water action plan. Um
And then there, there's a really
critical coordination happening
across other state partners.
Um State executive agency
partners including Indian Affairs,
Economic Development
Department of Agriculture.
Um I'm sorry, they're listed both
times. Um But
um uh
in Indian Affairs and,
and economic development are examples
of partners that don't own an
action that are involved
in these conversations.
Um There's a number of active
program implementation
activities happening
depending on which of the 11
actions you're looking at.
You just heard from Stacy Timmons
on AquaForm Applic and
Monitoring. So that's an example
that program is moving
along. Um
But it's moving along
at the pace. Uh it's
currently funded at
um
and then really key for this
committee is the funding
analysis and upcoming
budget requests for 50
year water action plan
implementation.
The Governor's office has
asked these agencies that
have a role in implementation
to be thinking about
what's currently funded and
underfunded
or unfunded
in an action that they have
responsibility for and to
be factoring that in to
their upcoming requests
for recurring and nonrecurring
funding. Um And
we're also looking bigger picture
at broader
um funding
needs that
are critical for
the state as a whole
that might complement
agency budget requests. And I'll talk
more about that at the end of the presentation.
If we have time
um developing
a dashboard to engage the public and
show progress. We
have the water plan
online in a way
that you can kind of scroll and
read most of the plan without having
to download it. Um But
ultimately, we want to put an
interactive dashboard up there
that allows you all
and the legislature and members of the
public to engage
and track progress.
Um see how these actions
are proceeding. How are
we moving toward our measure
um over time.
So that is that dashboard's
under development and
then um lots more ongoing
discussions uh is,
is always critical
and very much um on
the calendar for
us as,
as we continue to
proceed.
Um I'm gonna turn it over
director to
Director White for the
next two slides and then I will
wrap up.
>> Thank you, Rebecca. Good afternoon
everyone again, Hannah Riseley
White, Director of the New
Mexico Interstate Stream Commission.
And I'm also here representing my
colleagues at the office of the State
Engineer. Um
and as uh
uh infrastructure advisor, Ruth said
we have a bunch of copies
here of the Governor's 50
year Water Plan. I'd love to share them
with you if you'd like.
Um The next two
slides cover just a couple of
implementation highlights, we
could do this for any one of
the 11
recommendations in the plan.
But in the essence of time, we have
just a couple here and I'm gonna go through
them pretty quickly. Uh
The first is, is
recommendation action
a one and that's to
develop and implement new
Mexico's water education
template, a statewide
water education
campaign. And there's a couple
of important steps that are currently
underway that I wanted to
highlight. First, we're
working with our colleagues at
academic institutions
including Un MS Utton
Center and also
New Mexico Tech Bureau
of Geology. You just heard from
doctor to
convene an education
water education roundtable.
The purpose of that initiative
is essentially to identify
all of the existing water
education programs
around the state. Figure
out how to bolster them, coordinate
amongst them
and highlight water,
the importance of water
at every level of
our uh academic
institutions. And with the public
more broadly. Uh
This recommendation is
of particular
importance to the governor and
all of us in that
water and thinking about water
should be front and center and everything
that we do in our day to day
activities. Uh The
first sort of the other
thing I wanted to highlight on this
slide is our effort
at Interstate Stream Commission to
implement the Water Security
Planning Act, which
was passed unanimously in
the 2023 legislative
session. We see that as
an amazing opportunity to
engage with the public
on water planning
in particular, but water and
the importance of
treating and managing
our water resources
carefully um
throughout the state. And
as I think you all
should have a handout as
well. Um related
to our current initiative, there's a
QR code that has a bunch of
information about those open
house events and engagement
around water. We see that
as a way to
get in front of the
public and talk about how
important water is.
Uh And then on to the
next slide,
there's some implementation
highlights from action
C four
which is to
accelerate watershed
restoration projects.
And I'm presenting this
information in part for our
colleagues at Energy Minerals
and Natural Resources Department.
We again are working
very closely across the natural
resource agencies and advancing
all of the slate of
recommendations in the 50
year water action
plan. And I wanted to
highlight um em
Nerd's uh 2020
forest action plan. It's an
incredibly
comprehensive
plan for managing
our forests and the reason that
this is so critical
and we're spending some time on
in, in this presentation
today is to the extent
that we can invest
in managing our
landscapes that
are the sources of our water.
So about 50%
of New Mexico's water is surface
water that comes off
of highland, high elevation
forests to the extent
that we can manage those, we're protecting
our water on the front end.
Um And that investment
is well worth it. When you
look at the potential impacts
of fire, of
post fire erosion,
etcetera. It's been
very impressive watching our
colleagues at Emer and their
work and they've now treated
um since 2019,
over 76,000
acres. Uh And that's
an incredible uh
effort in protecting
our water sources and protecting our
forests. The other uh
component here worth
highlighting is New Mexico's
Reforestation Center in
Mora. So exciting
news there, state funding
matching federal funding
for construction of
that reforestation center
uh that would produce seedlings
in order to re establish
forest, post fire.
And you know, it's worth
mentioning on both
of these highlighted
implementation
activities, the work
around leveraging federal
resources. So a lot of work
at EMR to leverage federal
resources for forest treatment.
We're also working on leveraging
federal funding for
planning initiatives as
well. And again, we
could happy to provide
additional information as you all
would like. And I'll hand it back to
Infrastructure Advisor Roos
to wrap up the
presentation. >> All right.
Thank you, Hannah Rebecca. You want
to wrap up? Are you
there? >> I
am here with you.
So, slide,
slide eight is our last
slide. Um and
it gets ther background to
funding um urinals,
bread and butter here in the finance
committee. Uh So the
table on sol eight
is um
it's not
comprehensive. So I'm
gonna that outright, right?
Um But it is a Sons
Shott as we were
both in this 30 day session
this year when the 50 water plan was
issued and coming out on the
heels of it or taking
inventory,
at least at a high level,
how much of the plan
is funded and how much
is unfunded or
underfunded. And
this doesn't give you a really
granular detail. It'd be
better um to go
sort of action by action
as opposed to the three
buckets. Um But
for today's purposes
and we're happy to come back and, and
talk to you in more detail in the
future. Um I
wanted to just convey to you
that there is
a lot of really
important steps forward in funding for
water. Thank you
all in the finance
committees in both chambers
for making that happen.
Um And to, to all the
other members that, that have supported
those appropriations.
Um But in this
50 year water plan,
there's a tremendous amount
of unmet need for
funding and
uh and going
forward
and to sort of lead it lead
into, you know, any, any
remaining time for dialogue in
Q and A. But today and more
conversations to come,
um I wanted to
share with you all the, the
governor and
um our team here in the governor's
office, working with our agency
partners and starting
to reach out to some of our
NGO partners
and um analysts
at our universities.
Um And even with,
we'll be having conversations
with legislative finance committee staff
as well. We're
starting to look at
what it would
entail for
us as a state
in the next session
to establish a robust
water fund that
generates revenue. The way you've
been doing this as a, as
a chamber as, as a,
as a body, as I should say
for the last few years on things
from early education to higher
education.
Um and the Grow
Fund and other
many, many other examples,
Legacy Fund um
where we're setting aside today's
revenues to earn interest
for the future. We've not
done that yet specifically on
water. People have been talking about
it for years. We're getting serious
about it and we're still, we need to run
um analytics, run the math
talk about which programs,
how it would work. How much
funding are we talking about?
Um Vice Chair
small throughout a
billion to billion and five
in the last panel. Um We'll
see where we land and what
it should look like. Um
But we absolutely
would like to come back and talk with the
subcomittee in more detail
about that in September
if you'll have us and with
that um madam
chair, I'll turn it back over to you. Thank
you so much for the opportunity to
talk with you all today.
Ok, Herrera. >> Thank you.
Thank you very much. We have Representative
Herrera and I don't have
anyone else on the list.
So. Oh, yes, I do.
You, yes, thank you.
We have Representative Chatfield
after you. So, can you
proceed? >> Thank you, madam chair and I'll,
I'll make this quick and thank you,
Hannah for all your work. I just
want to comment on this water planning,
the mainstream New Mexico.
I, you know, I'm
in region uh
Rio Chama, that's,
that's my region. Actually,
I'm in about three regions,
but I'll start with Rio
Chama. Here's so
you gave out contracts to
different organizations to
do this and
they, they
organize these community meetings.
Is that how that
work
>> madam chair, Representative
Herrera? So,
um through our regular
planning budget, we contracted
with both the communications
firm out of Albuquerque.
Um to do
uh the
advertising and outreach.
We're really trying to reach a
much broader
audience than we have
historically around water
planning, especially with the passage
of this new act. And we also
hired a facilitation
firm to help us design
a process this
year for robust
public input to, to
inform the future
of regional water planning under the
Act. And those two
contractors as well as a
data visualization
firm. Also out of
Albuquerque are working with us
to formulate sort of
next steps under the act
and and they help tee
up the framework
for the open house events
that are occurring in person
and each of those current
six planning regions.
Um As I think you all know,
the act calls for us to
revisit the delineation
of the regions themselves.
And so that's part of what's on the
table. But also the
QR code on that
handout leads you to the
website at which
we're collecting all of the
content we're collecting
input on at
the in-person open
houses or is also
online, you can participate
in an online open
house.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank
you, Hannah. Um And
I guess I just want to say there
was another, another
$4 million study
that was uh uh
received by the
Utton Center to go up
and uh form
formulate planning,
I guess in, in my
district. And the thing
is they
brought in four, I'm sure they
were great young women, probably
hydrologists. I don't know,
but they came with them and they
came up and they met with all the
people in, in my district.
But, you know, I have plenty
of water district.
Um I have
plenty of water
experts in the
district. So
when an outside organization
comes in and says they're going to
do, you know, community
planning and they
invite the community but
they don't pay anybody in the
community. You know, they
just, they just
use the, the
knowledge that they have and
all that money goes back to
the Eden Center. So
I, I know there's a lot
of money coming into the State
and I, I just,
I just think we need to
listen to local voices
more. I guess that's just a
general thing. Not about you,
Hannah. Not about
um, I guess it's more really
about the center. I got it. Mixed
this water thing,
mixed up with the other
water planning
uh seminar.
Thank you. Thank you madam
chair. >> Thank you, representative.
All right. Representative Chatfield,
you are standing up like ready
to go.
There we go. >> I'm >> gonna >> turn my mic
on this. Thank
you madam chair. I
just wanted to speak a little
bit about the idea to have a water
fund. We have a water fund. It's
called the Water Trust Fund.
We put money in it year
before last try to put a
little money in it. Last year.
We got some of it there.
I think we ought to keep
building that fund
so that we can deal with water
issues. I don't, I
think when you create
a new fund, you have to create a new
structure to, to manage
that fund, to do all
the things that it does.
This one is exists.
It's funded, it works
quite well. And
uh I'd say if we wanna
devote some more money to
water, let's put it in the water
trust fund
and uh go to town.
Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Chatfield. I don't have
anyone else on the
list and
we are going to recess
until tomorrow. Let me just
say, don't forget,
730 we
meet at the conference center for
a newborn tour and we
depart at 7730.
Mr Chair. I'll give it back >> to
you. Do we have any public comment
from this morning's on
setbacks?
I don't see anybody signed
up. Ok. We're adjourned.
Thank you.
05
45 tonight, we're at
the Country Club,
Riverside Country
Club, which is
down along the
river
on the side of the river.
