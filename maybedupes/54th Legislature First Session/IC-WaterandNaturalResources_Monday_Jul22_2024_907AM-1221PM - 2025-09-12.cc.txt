Ok, that's red.
Is that on is not
green?
Ok, good morning,
everyone.
Um
Welcome to
Kreiss.
Ok. So, um this is not
Corrales. Um But
thank you to uh
CNM. Uh We
looked for a
meeting location in Corrales
and there wasn't a facility
that could really handle us
conveniently. And
then last minute, uh we
came to see and them and they stepped
up. Uh So
I appreciate that. Uh This
is also not
rudo. So,
um, so we were
supposed to be in Rho Dos, so, uh
for the first meeting
and obviously they had
a devastating
fire and
during the course of the fire,
um there was a lot of discussion
about moving and
I'll tell you, uh,
you know, I talked to our, our vice
chair, Senator Svoy and other
people about
moving and I didn't want to
move. Um My
theory was the
fire was gonna be out by the
time we had our meeting.
Uh I was right about that.
Um I did not
uh anticipate the
devastating
flooding that
they continue to have, I think
as recently as this weekend.
Um So,
uh, you know, I'm very
pleased that, uh in
our uh quite
recent special session, we
were able to send some
aid um
to roso to help
recover from the fire. I think that's
a good thing
and what we ended up doing
was, um,
shuffling the order of
our, our planned order of
meetings. Um
So we were going to come
to quote unquote
Corrales in
uh October and
said we'll be going to
roos. So in
October, um
when we shuffled the
order of the meetings, we also
shuffled the
focus of the meetings
because the focus of each
meeting um
has at least some
connection to
the location uh
and in Rhodes.
So we're doing energy.
Um Rhoto isn't
itself uh
uh the oil patch, but
it's uh at least
nearby. Uh So
we want to be down in that part
of the state.
Um And the
other meetings also have
similar, you know,
loose
Nexus.
Um So this is the
first meeting of the
interim um
Water and Natural Resources
Committee. I know
other committees have been
meeting a
lot. So I
think C CJ
Courts, Correction and Justice
has already met six times.
Is that
right?
>> Yes, Mr Chair and we
have many more meetings
scheduled.
>> Um So,
uh this
interim has sort of
gone off with a bang
uh and also
been a little, a little
hectic uh with
our special
session. Um
So I'm pleased that we can
get water and natural
resources
um finally underway.
Uh So we'll do uh introductions
of the committee. Why don't we start with Senator
Campos?
>> Thank you very much, Mr Chair
madam, uh uh vice
chair members of the
Water and Natural Resources
Committee to our audience
people that are paying attention to
the meeting today.
Uh Mr Chair, the
uh program definitely is
very appropriate for
the entire state of New Mexico
as we continue to
deal with the fires and the
floods and the ongoing
rains that are affecting
each and every one of us.
So again, it's
great to be here. I'm State
Senator Pete Campos
representing all our parts
of seven counties in
northeastern New Mexico
where we continue
and continuously deal
with so many of
the uh aftermaths
of what has occurred
over the last several years
within that part of the
state and to the
legislature. I just want to
thank you all very much for your
ongoing support,
generosity and more than that,
the compassion
to help our people within the
area so that we can continue
to be in
uh safe communities.
Uh So that's where
I'm at today, Mr Chair and again,
thank you a very appropriate
agenda for this
meeting.
>> Mr Chair, members of the
committee uh
audience. Good morning.
My name is Martin Zamora.
I cover
uh house district 63
which takes in the south half
of Curry County, north half of
Roosevelt, all of
Duac, all of Guadalupe and a touch
San Miguel County.
Uh It was a nice
drive coming into
Albuquerque. And
look forward to the meeting
and very happy to
have uh Doctor Dave Duar
State climatologist with us
here today.
Uh Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman Larry
Scott State
Representative from District
62
which is Hobbs in
central Lee County.
Uh Very pleased to be
here and looking
forward to the conversation.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning, Mr Chair uh
committee and guest
uh representative Tara Lujan
House District 48 in
Santa Fe. I'm
very excited about uh the
agenda today and,
and discussions we're gonna have and
looking forward to what kind
of uh policies
we're gonna be looking and
pulling from. Um
not just based on these conversations
but conversations we've been having
for quite a while
now. Thank
you.
>> Good morning, Mr Chair. Good
morning. Everybody out in the
audience. I see many
people out there that I'm
happy to see.
Uh I
guess there's nobody out there that
I'm unhappy to see, tell you the
truth.
Uh
I, I'm
glad that we're having
discussions today about
the climate.
Uh My particular
little place of, of
the world over
around broadview and grading
New Mexico has kind of
been in the, I
have a DNA of the
rain
and this happens
last night, we got
a inch and a quarter of rain.
God, good Lord shined
upon us and, and we
got some rain.
Uh I also
see the devastation
that's happening in
Rio Dosa and the
devastation that
happened
and the Las Vegas
area.
Uh It
always makes you wonder
the uh a lot
of men
engineers
has spent a lot of time
on flood control
on diversion dams.
A lot of things. A
lot of course, a lot of that country
is, is National Force,
Mr Chair and a lot
of things that, that
we as a state
can do very little
about, but
there are
natural manmade
controls of some of this
stuff
and I often
wonder
why
of all the brains in the world.
We're not using some
of that to
control some of
these large
flows of water.
Uh
Being a dryland
farmer. I see quite often
what happens when
too much rain comes too
fast. Last
year, we had a 12
inches of rain in
one week time
period and it
filled up all those Player
lakes in that area
and a lot of those lakes player
lakes still have water in
from that rain last
year.
So there's
a natural
catch for
water
if we don't try
to
mastermind too many
things.
And with these
floods that happened,
that haven't
seen to happen in a long time,
it makes you wonder what's changed
other than the forest
burning. There's
other reasons that
those
waters have been diverted
different directions.
So
with further ado Mr
Chair, I, I've
overstayed my welcome
here. I'm
Pat Woods in district
seven,
representing the State of New
Mexico. Thank
you. >> Thank
you, Senator Woods. Cheer
Chandler.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm
Representative Christine
Chandler from Los
Alamos and I'm happy to
be here today. Thank
you,
>> Bueno Dia de La Dios
thema chairman
uh Representante
Miguel Garcia House District
14, I
kind of represent some of the more
historical
communities um here
in Bernel County.
Uh Theris
established in
1644 by my
great grandpa to the ninth
Power Pedro
Duran in Chavez Old
Varela, established in
1750
the uh South Broadway
area, country club
area and some west central
kind of blue collar Chicano
precincts.
>> And thank you, chair,
I am Representative
Kathleen Kates. I represent
District 44 which is
all of Corrales. So I
am especially proud
of this meeting. Thank you so
much. Um
Always making
sure that we are keeping
in mind of our
urban farmers
who have the same sort of
agricultural and water
issues that all of
our larger ranchers
around the state.
But they are providing
educational uh
incubators
for our community
because they're in a densely
populated area.
And um and I thank
you for the attention on today's
agenda.
Thanks.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman, committee
members, audience. I'm Gail
Armstrong State representative
for district 49
which is Kathryn
Valencia, Sierra and
Socorro counties,
uh largest house district in
the state uh per
square miles.
Uh I have a
ranch in Magdalena
is where I came from this
morning and
um my
friend Harlan Vincent
and, and Senator Stefanik
and others who represent the
Riodosa area.
Um It is
heartbreaking
to, to be part
of the
solution where
there is no real
solution as far as governments
concerned for
private industry. And
uh my heart is breaking for them
right now. Uh The
racetrack is devastated
so many homes
lost.
Um As far and, and
as far as Northern New Mexico is
concerned the same thing.
And so,
um,
we need to do
better.
Uh, I've got,
uh, loggers,
sawmills going out of
business in Catron
County
because the forest won't open
up enough property
to thin, not to rape
and pillage, but to thin
that area.
And so, uh, there
is solutions
and we, we can do better.
So thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Good morning, Mr Chairman. I'm
State Senator Mimi Stewart
from district
17 in
Albuquerque.
It's the east gateway
area, central
runs through my district
and the international
district where schools
in my area speak
23 different languages.
So it's a,
it's a challenging,
uh, district to,
uh, help.
Uh, it's where the
majority of the crime is
in Albuquerque, low-level,
crime, robbery,
burglary every
now and then we kill each
other. Uh,
so it's
just, uh, difficult
to deal with a
district like that, but I
love it. I've
been there a long time
and, um,
glad to be here. Thank you so
much for putting the, the
items on the agenda
today that you've
done.
>> Good morning, Mr, chair members
of the committee. It's a pleasure to be
here, Liz Stanic Senate
District 39.
And I would like to make a
few comments about Rio
Dozo. Um Lincoln
County and Otero and
San Miguel. Uh
We know that 1500
homes burned, but
over the weekend, we lost
another 200 homes
from the floods.
It took 10 years to
repair the water
source that serves
Otero and Lincoln
County from
previous fires.
So we can only imagine how
much longer it's gonna take.
And we also know that San Miguel
County is looking to protect
their water. As
Senator Campos
knows,
um
it is, as one
of, as representative Armstrong
said, government can only do so
much in terms of
money and
providing whatever resources
we have. But it is very
hard to go in
and really take
care of things while the
elements continue
to
expand. That's the only word
I could use is expand.
I did ask the chair if
this morning, they would go over the
topics for all of our
meetings so that the public would
know that they could put it on their
calendars. Thank you. It's a
pleasure to be
here.
>> Thank you, Senator and I'm
uh Matthew mcqueen. I chair
this committee, I'm House
represent, I represent house
district 50
which is uh after
redistricting the southern
half of Santa Fe County
and the uh Placetas
area of Sandoval County
um A as
Senator Stanic requested.
The just so people
know uh today as
our climate
and related topics
focus uh in
August, we will be in Socorro
working on water
issues in
September. We will visit
Questa Red River
area and, and focus on
conservation
related issues that be
land and wildlife and, and
other topics in
October. We will be down
in Roos. So um
focusing on energy
and then in November, we'll
be back in Santa Fe.
And my hope is that we
will um uh
vet some bills.
So that sort of do a first pass
on bills
um to get the input
from this committee and get them ready
for the 60 day
session. And of course,
we're coming up on a 60 day session
and there's a lot of pressure
to, you know,
as
you know, senators and
representatives, we want to
introduce our bills in the 60 day
session because
we're not gonna be able to in the 30
day session. So,
um uh
staff, um
can you
introduce
>> uh thank you, Mr Chair. My
name is Sarah. We admire our lead staff for
this committee. We also have Tom Kriska,
our drafter um
over here, Angela Dakin,
our help uh
in all means. And then
Andrea Martinez is our
intern for this
interim and then we have
Roberto in the back helping with
our uh webcast and
it stuff. Thank
you.
>> Ok. Thank you for that. And we
have um for the committee. We have
some, some breakfast uh behind
me and that's thanks
to Lauren Abbey. Uh
That might be a familiar name
to a lot of you. Uh
And she's working with the
Museum of New Mexico
Foundation and
we're having lunch here on
site. Uh And
that's thanks to Charlie Marquez
and Marla Schutz.
Um So any
um any questions or
announcements from the committee
before we go to our, our
welcome?
Ok, great.
Um
Tracy,
>> great. Well, welcome.
Um My name is Tracy
Hartzler. I'm President of Central New
Mexico Community College.
And um you're right,
you're not in Rio Dozo and you're not in
Corrales. Uh And
I'm really sorry about that
because um
you want, you do really
important work and we really
appreciate um
when you get to visit all parts
of the state. I'm always
glad when you're in Central New Mexico,
but I also appreciate and
know that it's so valuable
for you to um
be in your districts and to see
other people's districts
because you represent not only
the counties that are in front of your
name, uh But you represent
all of New Mexico and
all the residents and you know
that um more than most
because of the committee that you're sitting
on. So I really appreciate
that you're here today.
Um Again, I want to thank you for your
public service, so many
of you who represent C and M in
our district, um which
is our geographic area which
covers Burnley County
and, uh, some of
the, um, some
of, uh Sandoval County,
um, know that I really appreciate
the work that you do. I work for a
seven memberm elected board.
Um, I worked for the legislature
in the past, so I really appreciate
your public service and particularly
at a time when, um,
it may go
under underappreciated.
You do really hard work.
And so again, I really want to thank
you for your time for,
again being willing to come out
across the state. Um, and
certainly for being here. Uh, we
really appreciate your time here
and we're glad that CNM was able
to host. Um, we know
that, um, and I'm really
appreciative of my staff, Martina
Leia and certainly Narita
Seals, who is with us,
um, also,
and who staffs and
leads our student
efforts.
But I wanted to say I'm
particularly, um
pleased that you're here
because when I first came to New Mexico
15 years ago, I started
with the Interstate Stream Commission.
So I worked as a staff attorney.
Um, I worked on issues
related to the Gila, to the Canadian
River, to
boat docks and UTE reservoir,
uh, the eastern rural New
Mexico water
project, which
is now much more advanced
than it was when I started 15 years
ago. Um,
and I really
appreciate,
um, coming from a
federal level and federal experience,
the government can only do so much.
Uh, it can only do so much because
it also requires on significant
partnerships um,
across state and personal
interests and
water districts and municipalities
and tribes and others. So
I appreciate the hard work that all
of you consider.
Um, and
it was with really great affection that
I worked for the Interstate Stream Commission,
working on significant
issues and again, working with some of you
and some of the individuals in the audience.
So it's
particularly special, not
that I don't appreciate all legislative committees
who come here. Um, but it's
particularly special that you're here
today. Um, I wanted to
highlight, um, one
particular project
and I appreciate that your, your topic
is on, uh, climate
and I can
talk a little bit about solar and other
projects that we have here
in Central New Mexico. But I
particularly wanted to
share um a grant
that we're participating in a federal
grant. Uh And it's
with the National
Science Foundation,
we're currently part of a planning
grant that's leading into an implementation
phase. And the grant is
part of the regional advancement,
leveraging innovations for
water and energy security
transformation.
There's an acronym,
it's a little bit long and
isn't really as compelling, but we're
in this planning stage and CNM
is the workforce training provider
for this grant. And what
the second part of this grant
will do is focusing on the
San Juan Rio Grande Energized
watershed. Um
So, what we will be doing is
CNM is as a
sub grantee.
Um We'll be working
on the workforce
training for
individuals um
who are developing
technologies
and projects in that
region. But again, our
workforce training programs that
we will develop, we will share
uh the curriculum
and train instructors at
other colleges, which
is what we often do.
Um And so we're excited that we're
participating in the
state's
um approach
uh and trying to implement
solutions for water, for
protecting our, our
valuable assets
again, preparing for what we need
today, but also certainly
our future so that the state
can grow
um and
grow in all the areas that are so important
to each of you here, whether it's farming
ranching,
um
agribusiness, uh
industry. It's, it's
a broad range. So I really, again, I
appreciate the work you
do. I can highlight some of the
partnerships that we have. I think
the most important or relevant one is the
one I shared. Um And I'd be
glad to answer any questions, but
again, thank you for your work. And again,
I'm sorry that you had to come here,
but I'm also pleased that we're able
to, to adaptt
and, and help you, um,
and meet today. So, thank
you.
>> Thank you, uh, President
Hertzler. Um,
so I too,
and am
an alum of the NC
stream commission and
I too worked on boat docks
on reservoir
and houseboats as
well. Fun
stuff. The, uh, the
gift that keeps on giving,
um, any, any
questions for the president from the
committee,
Senator
Woods,
>> tell us a little bit about your
outreach to the high school
students on steel
and different
things like that. I know that you've
got a program that you'd like
to bring in shortly
and, and
needing some funding for it.
So, this is your
time to pitch.
>> Well, thank you. Um, thank
you, uh, uh, chair
and Senator Pat Woods. I appreciate your
question. So, c and
M like many of the high
school, like many of the community colleges
and colleges in your areas work
very closely with our high school
students. Um, we work
with our adult learners as well, but we certainly
work with our our high schools, we
partner with about 100 and
12 schools,
elementary schools, high schools
are, which include
schools um
partic with respect to
STEM and I would, and
part of STEM I would say relates
to our career, technical
education. Uh We
work very closely with providing
that high school. Um I'd
say 11th and 12th
grade curriculum for
those learners who
are um seeking
to gain a certificate,
uh seeking to gain some
credential and frankly
explore careers
in areas uh
that are familiar to
them, whether it's nursing or
healthcare, which is often very
familiar or some of our
more high tech
um areas which we're calling
industrial technicians,
mechatronics. And
what that means. It's basically
programming that relates
to it,
engineering
welding and some mechanical
engineering work. And so
what we're doing is bringing those
programs to our high school
students in their own
schools where we can share
and use their equipment, but we're
also bringing students to our
programs um here
just about a mile that
way. Uh at our advanced
technology center uh
in that program, we're
also coordinating.
Uh Well, as I mentioned,
water relates, you
can't do anything in water
without partnerships and
agreements. And we
are expanding our career technical
education programs with Rio
Rancho Public Schools
in a partnership. Uh
They Rar Rancho Public
Schools has a 22
acre campus.
They are renovating a
facility to lead
and promote and
educate high school students in
career technical education
fields, mostly welding,
carpentry, et cetera. We
are providing
faculty and curriculum
and for those career technical
programs, we are
also building Montgomery Board is
approved a new
facility on that campus
and we are moving our electric
vehicle and our
automotive mechanic program
there as well. So again, the
opportunity is for us to leverage
resources with a public
school. Um And
when I say resources, it's not only
capital, it's not only buildings, it's
faculty, it's curriculum,
not only to help adult um
our high school students, but also our
adult learners who are coming back
to reskill. So I think if
that's the partner, I mean, we have a couple of
different partnerships, but that's one of them
that I'm most excited about.
Uh because of the
um technology
work, the uh
leveraging of resources,
which by the way is really difficult.
Um We're all well intentioned,
which is helpful, but it's, it's difficult
to pull all of this
together. Um But
again, we're all doing it for the right reason
which is to help more
learners and high school
students get excited about
stem frankly develop
the confidence
in the, in those areas to be able to
enter the workforce. Um
And then also certainly to meet our
employer needs.
So
I'm not sure that was particularly
the question, but I'm absolutely
asking for more money for those
particular equipment, which is
quite expensive.
>> Thank you very much. I appreciate
your, your, your
cantor, you know,
you made a, a place
available to the committee
on a very short
notice. At least
we could do is listen
to your sales pitch. Thank
>> you, Mr Chair.
Uh Thank you, Senator
Woods.
Um, Representative
Lujan,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. Uh
Thank you. Uh
Thank you for being here and thank you
for hosting us today and
all the work that you're doing.
So, my question
is, um,
for the workforce training that you're
doing in, in um
these new developed programs
that you mentioned and maybe
um elsewhere, what
do you
and I guess this will lead off of what
Senator Ward said. What do
you need from us as
legislators to grow those
programs? Especially those involved ste
in stem
education uh type
cer certifications
and the workforce
development.
And
what have been some of your limitations
that you're seeing?
>> Thank you for the explicit
question. Thank you and Mr
Chair and Representative.
Um
I would say what is most needed
is the broad authority
to use funding
frankly that the legislature has already
approved, has already appropriated
$60 million for workforce
training, $20 million a year
in funds. But the
broad authority for us to
go and purchase
really expensive equipment
um to continue
to support
work based learning. So, apprenticeships,
internships or work experiences
for students who are in skill in
school now, who can then
also go out into the workforce
immediately uh permanently
for, for with employers.
So when I we just
had a workshop
last Friday with
Intel Maxion,
Amazon and General
Mills. And
those employers
clearly said we value
workforce training. We need
to get people just engaged
quick certificates.
10 weeks, 12
weeks where individuals
can learn more about the equipment
they're going to use can get some
competency can gain a skill,
that's an industry skill set or
certification in
safety and in basic,
um I'll say electronics,
it and um
engineering, but
that allows them to then
be on a pathway.
Um There's no question
that paying or
subsidizing those wages
for individuals going into those programs
is important. Being able to use the
opportunity, scholarship or scholarship
funds to pay for
industry recognized, valuable
programming is important
and then certainly to be able to
build, um,
take the time,
the staff time. What is underwritten
and what is not, is very difficult
to account for is the amount of
faculty time that we
dedicate to work with industry
representatives to build the curriculum
that's needed and responsive.
So to be able to frankly
underwrite, that is
helpful. Again, the, the
legislature has already appro appropriated
money. It would be
wonderful to have broader authority to
spend what you have because right now it's
pretty restricted and that's,
that's what's holding us
back. We can
try, we're spending about $5
million a year,
um, on
a, we could probably spend
more and I know our
smaller, more
rural community colleges could
spend more in
local responsive
programming if they had that
authority.
So, >> thank you,
Mr Chair. So that authority is
restricted by statute.
Is that correct? >> Statute
and rule? >> Yes.
And, and >> HED
rule. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair. I,
I think we need to
look into that, look
into the statutes and where we need to,
to make some adjustments. I think
we need to through
your board, look at
um and adapt the
rule. But I think
it stems from, if we have something
to do to help
lend what
needs to be done, we really
need to dig into that
as far as
the
um
paying for those certificates
and for those, those pathways
are you, is that one of the
limitations that you have
in using those funds, Mister Chair? I
just wanted to clear and that's my last
question.
>> So um what the funding
does allow for us to do is to
sponsor um
provide scholarships
or grants for individuals
in high demand.
Um Many
stem, but it's also healthcare, career
trades uh programs
and provide for that
tuition so
we can do that. I think it's making
sure it's broad for the
program development
as well. Thank
>> you. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative, we're
a little bit over time, but Representative
Kate,
>> thank you chair and, and
thank you Tracy once again,
um We
all uh like
showing off CNM. And
so thank you.
So um HP
five that passed last
session was
through workforce
solutions to be able to
pay for apprenticeship
programs. So I guess
one of my questions is, is
CNM able to access
some of that?
And I'm so sorry, I'm going to ask him
quickly. We can get
because the chair
is correct. I I
would just want to take an opportunity.
Also, let's clarify
also that you were saying to,
to purchase
large expensive equipment
for training. And I so
appreciate the partnership
with our corporate
partners here in this
facility, General
Mills and
Intel.
Are, are you looking to put
together? We, we as
legislators have seen some
of the training uh
trailers uh that
have virtual, whether they're
welding or plumbing
so that you can take them
to rural communities
as well so that people don't
all have to come here.
Um Is that one of the
ways you're envisioning
uh the purchasing of the
expensive
equipment?
>> So first question was the question
of whether C and M is eligible or
participates in the HB five
apprenticeship programs
that funding as I understand
is directed for registered
apprenticeship programs. C and
M has one registered
apprenticeship program uh
in information technology.
We are looking to expand our number
of registered apprenticeship
programs. That's a very official
formal title.
Um So we access some funds
but um
but others use those
more regularly and appreciate
that uh with
respect to um traveling
material or traveling equipment
um we support the
workforce solutions um
semi
and sort of the mobile lab
component. I think what we'd
like to see is how can we
tie that to
enrollment
programming um in
the schools? Because by the way,
so much of this can happen
with simulations and
remotely, so there's always going to
be a combination. So
if the traveling uh
trades trailer
um can get
learners excited
and interested. I think the question
is how do we tie that data in that
information to a school
to then get them um
to, to, to
frankly um act on that
interest and we can do that a
couple of different ways. So I wouldn't
necessarily look to um
expand at
CNM mobile
equipment. But I would absolutely
look for how can we take that data and
help others?
Um uh
I'll say leverage
our simulations, our online
education, which is quite
robust throughout the state,
given the pandemic and
the growth since then and then
leverage that a little bit differently with
equipment. >> Thank
you so much. I know we are,
I I very much appreciate
that the
information that you provided
there in workforce
training, we call that
workforce discovery
or workforce training, right?
The discovery of
different. So taking in the schools
so that they can, they didn't
understand that this was an
occupation that they might be
interested in. And so, you
know, I absolutely agree.
So just one more,
just a statement saying
that for those of you who are
not part of Central New
Mexico. This
specific facility
has just is a, is
a great resource.
I mean, not only the community
rooms but really
focused on workforce
training and
as well as uh
SB A is
located here as
well. And so,
um it's an opportunity
for entrepreneurs, workforce
training as well
as being able to
have community training rooms.
And so I really appreciate
the, the here in
District 44.
Thanks.
>> Um Thank you. Uh
Thank you, Representative Kates. Uh Thank
you President Hartzler. And
again, thank you for
uh accommodating us on short
notice.
Ok. So our
next uh panel
is um climate
change, overview of current science
policy and monitoring.
The panelists could come up.
Uh While we're doing
that, I think we had a few new members
joining us. Representative
Romero. Uh >> Thank
you, Mr Chair um
Representative Andrea Romero
from Northern Santa Fe
County for sovereign PBS
from Santa Fe all the way
through the PCA Valley into the city of
Espanola.
>> Um Thank you and I thought I saw
Rehm.
So
President Rehm. Would you like to
introduce yourself? Uh
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
I'm Representative Bill
Rehm. District
31 basically
right on the other side of the
interstate. Thank
you,
>> Representative Sarinana.
Thank >> you, Mr Chairman. I'm Debbie Sarinana.
I represent in house district 21
which is a Manzano high
school area right here in Bernalillo
County. Thank
you.
>> Ok.
Um uh
We'll go now to the
panel. Uh, we'll generally
go in the order
of the agenda.
Um,
uh, Doctor
Dubois. Would you like to go
first?
>> Ok. All
right.
Good morning. Uh, Mr chairman
and members of the committee. My
name is Dave Dubois. I'm the state
climatologist for New
Mexico and I reside
down in Las Cruces.
And, um, my
goal for this morning, the
presentation which you're seeing up
there and which hopefully you
have a handout um
is to cover 22
topics um
overview of the science
of climate change
in a kind
of abbreviated fashion
and monitoring and
highlighting our
statewide weather station
network called Zia E.
So, um
so we can go
to the first slide. So,
so basically, I, I just, I
don't want to, I, we only
have a few minutes to talk here,
but uh I want to talk
about where the, where, where
do you get the information that has
the state of the science
to, to help with
decision making um across
New Mexico and the world.
And I'm, I'm gonna first
uh mention the global
assessments of climate change
over many, over actually
many decades now.
Um And the most
recent one, the assessment
report number six, which
we, we, we rely on a
lot of that that
provides the, the, the
outlooks and the scenarios
that we look um
that we're going to be using,
which I'll cover in the
next couple slides on the like the
50 year water plan. So
a lot of that information that
was, that was grabbed
from that assessment and is
used locally in
decision making for water
and many other things.
Um And so there's a large
body of, of, of
um literature and
assessments, you know, remember the
IPCC, which is Intergovernmental
panel on climate change. They don't
come up with the science but they
summarize it and it's basically
summarizing the where,
where all the things go and, but
it's at a global level. So if you go to the
next slide is the
national assessments
that it's called the National Climate
Assessment. Um
And the last one was back in
2020 23 with
the fifth one.
And um so that is
basically focusing in
on the United States.
And how does the, the,
the um the
scenarios that were developed
for the global kind
of fit in, in the
US and what, what's going
on with the climate, um
looking at temperature, precipitation
and all the other things that are dealing
with climate. And
so, um rather
than go through all of that, I, I just
wanted to some kind of mention
those reports. Those are the
ones, those are the places where we
get our information that I
get my information from.
And there's literally thousands of
research um
um
um reports and
uh peer review publications that are
on those. And then we use
those. And then the next slide
talks about what we're doing in New
Mexico. Um
starting back back in
2006, there's even some
earlier ones and I didn't
mention here. But um these are some
of the more recent
assessments that we're looking
at uh climate and climate
change uh
regarding
uh water decision making,
uh which is a big, big deal
for us. Um And,
and not only for the state level,
but also also for our
our counterparts at the federal
level, like Bureau of Reclamation,
um other Army Corps,
army Corps of Engineers
um as well as the research
part of that, which is the climate
assessment for the Southwest.
As a more of academic
side of it is looking at
um kind of the, the human
aspects of climate change.
So we can look at all the science,
but we have to look at. So how do we
deal with that on a, on a
personal community
level. Um
How do we solve the problems?
And um so we, there's, there's
groups that are doing that um
all throughout
um the Southwest,
including un mn MS
U, et cetera
um tech. Um
And so that all that
is kind of put together for
our, our, our um
how we're doing things. So,
next, next um
um is more looking at
the not
all areas of the
world or even New
Mexico responding to climate
change the same
um as you can see
that the, the colors on that
map are all
very warm in terms of
the colors. Um
And there's the, that's the temperature
trend per decade
from 1972 to
2021. As you can
see, there are some areas that
are are warming
faster than, than
other areas. And New
Mexico is one of those or is
warming faster
than other parts of the United
States. And II I want
to mention that this was one of the
maps that was from the National
Climate Assessment. And
so one of the big thing
with climate change is the more
certain thing um
outcome of that in the
science is that is the temperature,
the average temperature
is, is, is the most
um pronounced thing.
And the most um
detrimental thing is what, what we
be talking about and looking
at, looking at climate change
because it's, we're already seeing that it's
nothing something, it's, it's gonna be
happening in the future continuing,
but it's already happening. So it's
something we're reporting
on our, our weather
station. So if we go to the next slide,
please, it's showing
through New Mexico, through, uh,
on every county in New
Mexico, all 33
counties. We're, I'm
showing the, the trend of the
high temperatures in June, July,
August and those are degree
Fahrenheit per decade.
And so I'm um,
showing the numbers going
all the way from uh
0.4 to
0.9 degrees, um
even one degree
um close to that
all across the New
Mexico. So this is the past.
So this is all we're already what we're
reporting those summer temperatures
are, are warming
up and to go to the next slide.
Um This is what
the we I I kind
of borrowed a lot of this from the
50 year water plan which
we were part of with. Um Doctor
Dunbar is heading that up
a couple of years ago and
this is from that directly
from that report is
showing that the the scientific
consensus shows that we
should plan for a hotter more
arid climate for at least
the next half century.
And looking at the numbers
annual statewide temperature
um to increase by about
five °F
by mid century. And that's the graph that
shows that there. So if you go to the next
slide, please, and I just
wanted to show just one location
um how it
manifests itself. Um
One of the things that we look at is
sort of growing season that's defined
as when the, the
after the, the, the, the
last frost in the spring
to the first frost in the
fall, and then we've
count the number of days
between that those two periods.
And then we do that over and over
for 100 and 30 plus
years. And this is what the
graph shows going all the way back
to the turn of the
century, going all the way back to
about a year ago. As you can
see that we, we were around
a 200 or so days
growing season going from like
1900 all the way
to like 1980. And then
since then, we've been been climbing
and sort of sort of that I, I
don't want to draw any lines or
anything, but you kind of, you use your
eyes to, to kind of look
at the future and where we, this
is the past. Remember going looking
at where, you know, we're
going past 280
day in one in one
year where we had a really
warm, warm season. So
this is kind of how it manifests
itself from
the, the warming. Um
the, the grow longer growing
season. And the next slide shows
the um
precipitation patterns. And this
is another graphic that
we, I I borrowed from
the 50 year water plan
is looking at seasonal
precipitation and this is an,
this is a, um,
looking at the future. So
looking at going out to
2069
comparing to the past
and showing that the,
um, the spring
is, look,
the, the outlooks are
tending toward
drier. Um, so
that's typically from, for
at least the western side of the state, that's
usually the driest time of
the year, but on the east
side of the state, not, so that's kind
of that dry line kind of works
its way into the, into
New Mexico. And that's when we get
some good precipitation on the east
side. And that's kind of a
concerning signal for us and
climatology and the
climatologist world is looking
at. So how do we are some of
the, the, um the ways
that the, the, the patterns are
maybe shifting and then
another one is the bottom
left the summer, um
which are maybe some good and
bad news. Um
that according to
these ensemble of climate
predictions, the, the
southwest may be showing a sign
of maybe some increased uh
precipitation.
But the northeast,
um kind of going up into
the, um, the
parts that are in that the
previous um, dustbowl
area may be getting drier.
So this, these are, remember, these are
scenarios, um
Nobody knows exactly what's going to
happen in the, in the future. But this is
kind of the tendency that we're looking
at, you know, this is scenarios
if this happens, this
is potentially what it what it
could look like to go to the
next slide. Uh One
of the topics we, we've been talking
about a lot is arid education, that
word. So we're
already in a semi arid climate.
Um But we're, we're kind of
tweaking that a little more and
more as we go along and at the
average temperature moves
up a little bit over
time making it a little more
arid. Um So making,
making future droughts,
um drier and more
drier warmer than
like to say, the fifties, droughts or the
thirties, droughts. Um So
it's sort of that um kind
of tweaking those a little more.
Um you know, which has
implications on water
with like uh more evaporative
losses, snowpack impacts.
I'm sure we'll talk about that
and then things like dust on snow
when we're, we those are feedback
mechanisms and then
looking at the impacts
of our surface water supply. So, next
slide please. And so this
is just one example. I think Doctor
Edwards may, I don't know if you hear,
I don't want to steal this thunder at all,
but um talking about dust
and uh wind erosion,
um this is one of the, the, the,
the uh model
outputs from the um
um National
Climate Assessment report
and all that brown is sort
of the uh shows the
indication of the trending of,
of surf surface uh
soil moisture.
Um And that's kind of a big deal
for us that, that keeps our,
our top soils in
place. It's
implications for
human health, things like that.
Um So I just wanted to mention that real quick
on, you know, trends of soul moisture.
That's one of the things that we're looking
at to keep our eyes
on and, and which
should drive in terms of
monitoring those, we need to be
able to track those and that's kind of
leading on a little
later Next slide,
please. And that's kind of
just example that this
is was um if
you want the animation, I can animate
this, but basically that
that pink stuff that's
all dust coming off of, that's
the four corners right in the middle of
that graph that this map
here. And so all
those south-westerly
winds are blowing the dust from
Northeast Arizona
and um mckinley and
San Juan counties is into the
mountains in, in Colorado.
And that's one of the things that we're concerned
about. So, next slide
please. And another
big thing is we've been talking a lot,
especially this summer and last summer,
particularly uh the
heat. Um
Crazy numbers in terms of
the, the warm temperatures, the
highs and I, I just
want to show not only the highs but the
highs in the mor the morning
lows. That's a big
deal. I I hope that we
talk about that later on with
human health and, and heat
is that this is a graph
here of um new in
New Mexico State University. We
had, we have a weather station there that,
that started back in
1892
and that's the
average morning
lows, um, off
of our weather station there.
And you can see that, that,
that climbing is not getting as
cool as it used to be. And
that, that's a big concern of, of,
of the people who are looking
at health because we, you know,
we, when it's hot, we like to open
up the windows cool off
and we're not seeing that relief. And
that's a, that is a big concern of
ours. The next slide, please.
And one of the things um um
tracking things like highs,
this is a um
Roswell, we had 67
days over 100 last
year. Um
I'm not gonna repeat that.
Um But,
you know, we're looking at it, this is
what it is, this is the past
going all the way back to 1950.
Um You can see that trend
upward or some, you know, some days
there's a lot of noise up and
down, but it, you know, we're looking at
those highs, you know, how do we
plan for those? Um
Next slide talks
about um all
across New Mexico where
how many days
that were above 100 all across
New Mexico. As you can see, it's, it's
mainly the elevation.
So, whereas you get the lower
elevations, you get the higher
temperatures, particularly
over on the Pecos Valley, on
the very southern part of it.
Um over there
um Roswell, we had 67
like I said, we had 64
days of 100
in Carlsbad all the way
down and we, you know,
we're, we're kind of in
ending, you know,
I always look at other areas, you know,
like 8089
days in Tucson and
100 and 33 days of over
100 last year in
Phoenix, you know, looking
at those, that's how we compare
to what New Mexico looks like.
And that, and I didn't even look at Texas.
There's another areas there.
Um But that, that's sort of one of
our things that we're looking at for a
changing climate is,
is looking at over time.
So look at the
next slide. Uh I won't
go into lyric detail on these
because I think we're going to be talking
about these in the, in the future
and other other panelists
are talking about wildfire. We,
we all know we experiencing those
right now. As of as
of this hour, we're experiencing
the wildfire impacts. You can
see those next
slide. Um And then
also the impacts of agriculture
we've, we've seen in
the past, we've got drought over
across New Mexico. We,
however, we got some good rain,
you know, 1 to 2 inches
across New Mexico all
over New Mexico. I think every county
had some rain um
yesterday and last night, which
was super great, but
we're still dealing with long term
drought. And so, you know,
Lynn, looking at the longer term,
you know, we, we like to, to
relish on the, the short term,
but we got to look at the longer term
decato things that we were impacting.
So our, our, you know, as we
go on with droughts are warmer
than it used to be. So there's
things, all these other things, the
stress to our
animals, to our ecosystem,
the costs are going up
um higher water
requirements and then relying
on water sources and those are things
that we need to track that are, that are
driven by climate. So,
next, next
slide. So I wanted
to quickly go through.
I know we got the rest of the panels
here but um a little
bit on our, our weather station
network and it's, we, we actually call
it a mason that we got funding
from the state legislature
through. So I appreciate
those who helped with that.
Um This is what we
do. It's basically a,
an automated,
um sub hourly. We got
fivein reporting um,
data that's going out
um to the public
and we have a, a pretty
good spatial density and
we're basically, we want to
cover the missing
gaps between the federal weather
stations out there. So there's,
there's a, there's a nice network out
there, but it misses a lot of areas,
especially in the rural, rural
locations. And so we're adding
those in and we've, we've
got the, the the
infrastructure in there. Now we're putting
sensors on and we want
to emphasize data quality,
reliability, completeness
and data delivery. So
next slide. So why do we need
it? It's kind of obvious to us,
but we need that missing data.
We're really, there's a lot of areas we're
not collecting climate information
and we really need those. I mean,
we have to develop that, that
long term um
um archive
and, and you know,
better, it's never
too late to
start now. So
that's what we're doing. And
we're hoping to continue this on
to way past
all our, our lives and just
can, you know, the next 30 40
50 years. So we need
real time, higher density
um 1 to 5 minute
intervals and because there's
no other data out there.
So next
slide
and,
and so these are the reason why we're doing
things well, we,
we know we still have
drought in our areas.
We need, we need to be able
to do um intelligent
decision making on those. We, we
can't draw lines of the
US drought monitor without
knowing some numbers on there. So
that's what we're using it for.
And then also a lot of just
day to day decision makings on,
on, on ranches
and, and farms include
those here in terms of even
irrigation scheduling to,
to better use our water
um to, to how much do
we need to
right down to the, to the
nearest gallon. We could even
go. So um so
we're using all these and we need
that um that that
information. So next slide
and this is our
network we have going
on going forward. We,
we've got um over
200 stations across New
Mexico, um
mostly on private land and
ranches. And we appreciate the,
the, the, the cooperation
for those who, who helped out
um arranging, helping us
getting those out using
no costs agreements and and
memorandum of understanding.
So next slide. So
for those who are techie, these
are our sensors that we use, we
collect air temperature, relative
humidity. So temperature,
so moisture, all
winds, uh
wind direction, wind speed,
solar radiation, um
precipitation using
two type two types of gauges and
then atmospheric pressure.
So all that is Feeded into the
public, goes to the weather station,
national Weather service, anybody
who wants to use it. So
next slide, there are some just some
representative photos of the
type of weather stations
um that the
state funded we got. Tier
there's 23 different
tiers. Tier three is more
mobile like we can move those,
we can put those around and
move those around, add
those and at a lower
cost. Tier two or and
one or permanent.
Tier one is more of the shorter
version. Folks who didn't
want a full um 30
ft tower on their backyard.
We we put those tier
one and then tier one is
the full weather station.
So it's a 10 m 33 ft
tower. That's our
standard um that they,
they all measure the same thing.
It, it doesn't
matter what size, it's
more of what they perform,
you know, all do temperature
precipitation, et cetera.
It's just what they look
like and what, what the
necessary needs
are like a school may
not want a tier one tower
right in their um you know,
ball field.
So we, we opted for something
smaller. So if you go to the next
slide, so
our our and this is not a more techie
one, our data goes out
from, we use cellular
technology and satellite
communications because we,
we're still developing our, our
broadband
through New Mexico. So we have to
kind of have to do both. And then it all
goes to the cloud, goes
to our, our um our
central server goes out to the
public and it serves our
different um entities out
there and, and the federal
agencies and, and then
ultimately out to the public
to, to be used. So everything
out out there is for
the public to digest to
use and any other
pe any other folks who
want to use it. So next
slide, I think that's next, the
last one. And just to,
for those who want to
access it, there's many ways
to access. And I, I gave a talk
at the um new Mexico
Water data conference talking
about this in detail.
Um But the the most of the
bottom one is the websites
so you can get access to it
through um, several
websites, the National Weather service,
including our website.
And so we're making it all, all
available and,
um, so that there's no,
we're trying to minimize the
impediments to get the
information. So,
next slide I think is the last slide
I appreciate the time
to, to talk
about this and I'll
be glad
to hand
it back to the Mr Chairman. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Doctor Dubois.
Um Next up, we're gonna hear
from NMED.
Um
Claudia, would you like
to introduce,
do we have two people from
NMED?
Ok. So why,
why don't you
uh so turn
on, pull it
close
and less. No,
um
Why you're here?
>> Uh Good morning
uh Mr Chair. Thank you for
having us. I'm
Claudia Borchard with the
Climate Change Bureau at the New
Mexico Environment Department. I
have with me here, Director,
Deputy Director,
Donna Bajar. We
are here instead of Michelle
Miano today because she has
been one of the
many who's been impacted by
the crowd strike situation
and was not able to fly back
for this meeting today. So,
um appreciate being here.
Thank you to you and the members
of the committee for having NMED
here today. I'm
gonna be talking about three
things um which
are also in your handout,
which I hope all of you have.
First, I'm, I'm going to talk about
an update on our greenhouse
gas emissions inventory.
Then I'm also going to be talking
about one of the
key climate
measures that we're implementing the
clean transportation fuel
standard. And lastly,
I want to talk a little bit about a planning
effort that we're going through
to do an additional
um effort
to identify the climate
measures that we
as a state can look
at to reaching
our greenhouse gas emission
goals. So
starting first with the greenhouse gas
emission inventory, um
we've been working on this
for perhaps almost
a year and we expect to
wrap it up next month.
So stay
tuned and we'll make sure that everyone
knows when that inventory
comes out. Um
The reason that's really important to
have an inventory is kind of
demonstrated in that
graph that
is as part of your
hand out, which is, it
allows us to, to identify
where we are
now. Um It
also we project
out the kinds of reductions
that we expect from the
climate measures that we've already
implemented as a state,
both by 2030
2050. And it helps
identify that gap
between where we, we
project we will be and
where we want to be. And
it's that gap that
is the focus of future
climate planning
efforts. Um
So some of the things about
the 20 this new
2021 inventory
is that um
we'll see differences between
the oil and gas
emissions from the 2018
to 2020. That's
based because in the
2020 inventory,
we had access much more
information that
allowed us to
kind of hone in on
some of the emissions factors
and assumptions. And
so we actually seen we
the 2020
inventory shows a
significant less emissions
from the oil and gas industry.
Um On the other hand, we also
went back and looked at the
baseline against which, which
we compare, which is the
22,005
inventory. And
because we have more data now, actually
the baseline is going to,
to go up in our
new um
data.
And um just like in the past
in the 2018 inventory, we
address all the different
sectors that, that
produce emissions. So that would
be we talked about oil and gas,
also, transportation,
electricity,
buildings, natural
working lands are really the the
key components
that make up the overall
state emissions
inventory.
And we will, we will
also update it in the sense that we
have, we have more
climate measures in
place now than we did when we
did the 2018 inventory.
And so we'll take those and
project out their impacts to
the future. And again, as I
mentioned earlier, identify the
gap of what we,
what the additional work that we need
to do.
Ok. Moving on to
the clean transportation fuel
standard. Um As
as many of
you, probably
all of you may remember
that was um a, a bill
that was passed through the
legislature house
bill 41. Um
We appreciate your support on
that and uh was signed
into law. So now it is
law. Um one of the
first actions under that
bill was to convene an
advisory committee and
we're in the middle of doing that right
now. We have a 31
member advisory committee that
has already met three times.
Their last meeting is this
Friday that's going to be
virtual. Um
And um it
also includes uh
co public
comment opportunity
so that anybody from the,
from the public wants
to provide
public comment on
technical input
to the nmed
rulemaking team. That's
the whole purpose of this committee
is to provide technical
input as we develop the
rules um
that we will petition the
environmental improvement board
with um in the
next couple of months.
Um
And also there's many other
opportunities for public
input. Um They can
comment on the rules
directly to the EIB.
Um They can also
um uh contact enemy
D if they want to have a meeting with
us on the
rules. Um
And, and also we'll be
having a series of public
meetings going forward
um in parallel
to the rulemaking process.
So we'll make sure that those
all um are
well advertised. We
have a list serve so for
anybody who's listening or anybody
who is wants to be on that,
um You can either reach out to me
or go to our enemy D website
and make sure you sign up for
our lister which we send out
um bulletins, EBUS, we
email bullet E
bulletins out to people
who have expressed
interest in, in not only
this rulemaking but all
of the Climate Change Bureau's
work. And I just want to
finally just, uh
remember what the
goal is of the clean transportation
fuel standard as shown in
that graph in your handout,
which is to reduce
um, transportation
fuel emissions
20% by
2030
30% by
2040.
Ok. Moving on to the last
topic for today. It's the
um it's the
climate pollution
reduction grant
which is closely tied with our
Climate Action planning.
Um We received $3
million from EPA for that
effort. And the
first deliverable we
delivered earlier this year in
March 1, we delivered
a priority climate Action
plan which identified
those priority measures
that we believe the state
needs to do to, to
reach those climate emission
reduction goals
that um that we
have. And
um the, the great
thing about this funding from the
EPA is that it's meant to
be very comprehensive.
And uh so we not
only talk about the measures
that we, we think
our priorities but also
what are the workforce
solutions that need to
be in place in order to achieve
those actions?
What um are the community
benefits? Um what
are the economic benefits
and also in particularly
focused on disadvantaged
communities? Like how, how
do we shape these
climate measures to really
um fit New
Mexico and fit New
Mexicans?
So and the
pap the priority climate
action plan included a great
deal of outreach. You can learn
more about that by going to our
website if you're interested.
Um They, uh
and we will also
be doing a great deal of outreach
now, um for the
second phase of
the, the climate pollution
reduction grant, which is
called the cli the
Comprehensive Climate
Action Plan, the C
A. So we're just kicking
off that um outreach
phase right now.
Um
And um, just wanted
to mention one other
thing around that, which is that if
you look on the, the last three
slides on your handout,
um, we
um submitted
a $577
million grant,
um, broken up into the three
different categories shown
here in your slides um,
to provide
uh transportation, clean
transportation hubs along I
40 Corridor, working with our
neighbors to the east and west of
us. That's the Zenzero.
We also applied
for money for a
truck, uh clean truck
incentive program
to help um small
businesses, um, uh
who choose
access cash on the hood
vouchers and the associated
infrastructure, um for
clean trucks and then
also clean school bus
program. Unfortunately,
I just got the news
today that
the EPA did not
fund any of these
three projects.
So, um, these
were really, we really
worked hard to try to figure out
how to bring the money
to New Mexico and
Senator Woods. I know we worked really
closely with Tucumcari
and it was really great to work with
Mesa Lands and Qua county
manager and the city
Tucumcari manager. And we
are just so disappointed that we
can't have, don't
have this funding source to
help Tuum Kri be
one of these clean
transportation hubs. All
right. Um I think
that that really
summarizes what I
was going to talk about here
today. But of course, later, if you have any
questions for me, happy to
address
again,
>> Mr Chair members of the committee,
I am Charles
Gooder, policy
adviser for healthy climate, New
Mexico. Uh
I want to thank you very much
for the opportunity to be here
today and I'm really honored to be
on this panel with these
experts.
Great information.
So, um
what is healthy climate, New Mexico?
Just for one second. It's a
group of medical
professionals and public
health professionals that grew out
of the effort for House
Bill 104. was
the most recent version of a bill,
public health and climate
resilience. Uh
Senator Stefanik is
one of the sponsors. Uh
And uh of course, it'll have
a different number in this session.
Um But
uh the effort um the
need for
uh the state to pay attention
to the public health impacts
of climate changes
that are happening here and now
is what gave rise to that
bill and
frankly is um
relates very much uh
to what I'm gonna share with
you today. I'm gonna share with you
today. We will mostly be
at the 30,000 ft
level. I'm not gonna
fill your heads with more
data about data.
Um
There's, there's so much data
that's out there. Um
um And
um in fact,
I mean, you, you've heard
from, from the
climatologist, uh
you saw data
um with
climate models, you know,
based on climate models
um in terms
of the predictive information
data that also of course
goes back historically,
um that
uh may or may not have been
complete data about all of
the changes that are happening
in our environment and
the impact on the human
environment as well as the physical
environment. Um
But most climate
models are now predicting
that our climate will change
significantly over the next 50
to 100 years. Uh
with average annual
temperatures increasing,
this is statewide, of
course, 3 to
12
°F,
that's an enormous
difference.
Uh The magnitude
of the change of course is
going to depend on future
greenhouse gas emissions
and what we do
here in New Mexico as
well as in other places to
reduce the greenhouse gas
emissions. Um
These changes to our
climate
do have broad economic
damages um
to our state
economy to
and have hu
broad human damages
as well.
Um
Correspondingly the
impact on the state
budget is going to be growing
as well. Um
There's the direct expenditures
such as
million money, you
all just appropriated to
help the
folks in the Rudo. So Mescalero
area, those are
direct
expenditures, of course,
but then there's also lost
revenue from lost
economic activity.
Climatologists spoke to and
showed you maps about aridity.
Uh that's going to be changing, having
massive impacts on the agricultural
sector in our state.
Um You know, there's
more and different
insects will be
traveling north along with the
warming climate. Uh that
is going to have an impact directly
on agriculture, on
human health
um and so on.
And there's really very little
data on on
those some of those kind of
types of changes like the insect
uh uh
migration if you will.
Um But then
also we're also seeing
um frankly
my insurance
policy, personal
insurance policy just went way
up. Now, some of
that may have been due to some
personal behavior in our family.
But insurance,
the insurance industry
across the country
is is in disarray
because of the enormous
expenses that they're having to
spend on to respond
to climate change. You're gonna hear
about more about some of these economic
impacts later in the day from
some of the other presenters.
Um But that,
that's all data that
if we really want to have a comprehensive
picture of what is
happening in our state because
of climate change, we need to include
all of that variety of
data, the human health, the economic
sector overlay it with
the physical type of data that,
that you've been hearing about.
Um
And because really
again, all of those
things are budget
expenses reflected
in the budget or loss of revenue,
the budget. Um
And so without comprehensive
data, the state budget estimates
are going to be off base
the
um
uh slide
three. Yeah,
thank you. Um So there
is a lot of data as you, as you've
just seen uh from the other
presenters as you're going to see throughout
the rest of the day, there is an
enormous amount of data.
A lot of it is not really
accessible. Uh
Some of some of the
data that's a is
accessible uh
to folks like me who spend
time looking at it and,
and trying to analyze it.
Folks like yourselves
have a big jump
up on, on the public,
but the public really often
doesn't have um very
accessible or usable data.
Some, some of that is
a problem related
to the, the
complexity of the way it's
presented. Some of it
also um
is because there's missing
data that
um that
human, that
individuals and
families uh need
to make good
decisions.
Um
um So
I'm gonna share with you a
very tragic example, the
consequences of data
that isn't local enough
and useful enough. That is
this, this family
in this was in British
Columbia. Uh this
young boy, age nine,
he perished.
He had very, he had
asthma since birth,
but the day that he
died, his family didn't know how
poor the air quality
was due to
fires
because the air
quality monitoring system
that was closest to him was 60
miles away.
Hills valleys, I mean
60 miles is a long way.
Um You know, everybody in
the state with our, with
a lot of mountains and valleys
and so on, the
weather can be completely different,
much less patterns of
smoke. So
um
that kind of tragic
thing happens too often.
I will tell you also, a lot of
the medical data is way under
reported the impacts on human
health. Very
similar story to this.
I've been told
by family members
who, you know, not
to make names public or
whatever, but by
family members who
of a young child
around the same age in
the Las Vegas area that
perished a few weeks
after the fires were over.
He had had asthma that was
very bad. It was exacerbated
by the fire. His
death was not reported
as related to the
fire.
Clearly, it was the medical
people knew that it was,
that his family knew that it
was, but it
wasn't reported as a
fire related death.
Neither
will be the
numerous cancers
and other respiratory problems
that either are
new or get worse
because of
fire
wildfire
smoke
collaboration is
a slide five collaboration
is really critical
and public health has to
be in the middle of this
picture.
Um
I will tell, you know, you're
going to hear more about this
graphic later from
uh Mr
Matthews Trigg um
on climate and health. He's
going to go into more detail.
My point of leave putting
it here into this
is that public health
is pretty much out of this
picture in New Mexico.
A key part of the,
the, the the
House Bill one or four that I
mentioned earlier. Public health and climate
bill is to
reinsert public health
into this picture. There's now
only a 0.2
um staff
allocation at the health
department for working on
climate related information,
um which is, which
is just uh horrible.
We have so much more
information that needs to be shared
and, and uh
informed like local
emergency plans that,
that, that our Department of
Homeland Security and Emergency
Management
um uh
helps local
communities develop
for each area. They
list health issues as
one of the criteria that they
are to address. But
nobody at that department
has expertise on public
health related to
uh and and
extreme
emergencies. Um
And, and that, and
also um
those plans of local emergency
plants, of course, they're about
incidents rather than
ongoing chronic conditions like
high heat over long
periods of time.
Um So,
uh uh but
also, um
let me see, sorry.
Um Let's go
to number six.
So emer does have a
climate risk mass
map that is uh
very excellent in
many ways, it's
also very difficult even for
folks like me to
um to really
wade through the data.
It, it's also based
on a lot of assumptions
about what data is important
to put in here. In fact, there
is, there, there,
there is incident
data around some
major um like
heart, I think and cancer.
Uh diseases.
Um uh that's
based on health that
overlays with the other
incident information
like like uh flooding
risk and so on.
Um But there's a lot of
health data that isn't included
there. Uh So
it's not really a comprehensive
assessment of the climate risk in
any particular jurisdiction.
Nonetheless, I would encourage
all members of the committee to
take a look at. It
does have very useful
information.
Um So our
recommendation is to
provide a tool that is
comprehensive but also very
easy for JQ public
to use. You
know, it should be as easy as
using an app on,
you know, uh any kind
of social media.
Um Number
seven another.
Um
um
um Oh wait,
sorry, I want to go back to that
collaboration for one other
point about that really quickly,
which is
um
I spent
close to two hours watching
on youtube a, a
press conference that
was done um
within the first couple of days
of the Ruidoso Mescalero
fires. Um
There were representatives
from almost every type of
agency that you see on here,
local mayors included and
so on and they gave a lot
of detailed information, you know, this
road's closed
and so on.
Smoke was only
mentioned once
and that was only where it
was extreme.
So even though there
was much, the whole area
was covered in some smoke,
everyone there was breathing
some smoke.
The only thing that was mentioned
was where it was most
extreme there
was no mention about
no public health sharing
about the dangers
of breathing any wildfire
smoke. It's full of all sorts of
particular matters. Um
And then, especially when it burns
structures, then you're getting all
sorts of manmade chemicals that
are included in the
smoke. Public
health advice would have been to
wear masks
if you have to be anywhere near
that. Um
You know, or to take other
measures um to stay away
from it. Um So that
kind of, that's a mistake. I think
that should not happen ever
again. Um
OK, so back to
seven,
like I said about the data
needs to be able
to be used effectively.
So we do
recommend that there be a training
program on what the data is,
both for state agency
personnel and for
community groups.
Um probably also
share it with local governments.
Um We
also recommend of
course, well, you know, sorry,
the water data, you all know,
you've heard so many times about
um issues around the data
uh being incomplete
even as sophisticated
as, as it's getting, it's not
still not complete,
that's important.
Um uh We
do recommend also
local community
county and tribal involvement,
the public health councils
um are,
are
a great source of information
and the new, the
wrist map that I talked about,
it doesn't have for instance,
any information that's locally
generated. Uh
So there might, you know,
different, different communities
um experience
different, different uh
weather
um
uh healthy climate,
New Mexico. Our group itself
is doing part our part
to collect some more data. We have a
survey for members of
the public to contribute stories
about how their
health may be impacted
by extreme
weather or the changing
climate. Uh And also
we're gathering data
from medical and health
professionals in our state.
Hopefully we'll be able to report on
that to you during the
session.
We do. We have put
out two policy
advisories this year, one
specifically on
heat
and
there's 10
recommendations listed. I will
point out that the first
two are of course
critically
dependent upon
good data being used
and local data.
I'll point out too that there,
the air quality monitors in the
state are
we only have those which are
required by their federal EPA
which is in urban population
centers. So the entire
southeastern part of the
state, the Permian basin doesn't
have a single air quality
monitor that
that which is
different than the weather
monitors.
Um
um And
so we recommend
um first of
all, of course, a heat standard
to protect workers in high-risk
occupations and
more public health surveillance.
That means more air quality
monitors among other things.
Like we would love to see air
quality monitors be installed
along all of the mezz
ont the the weather
monitors that the state already
has in place so that we
don't need new sites and so on.
It could be done relatively
quickly.
Um
wildfire.
Um We have five data
related recommendations slide
10. Um
um
Again, we
would recommend establishing
evidence-based occupational
air quality standards.
Uh We public
health systems in general.
Um And the
monitoring and
distribution just
distribute
respirators and air
purifiers to low-income
households, community centers, public
facilities
before the next threat
materializes,
we know
the threats are out there.
Does anybody on this
committee believe
there's a possibility there may not be
serious smoke and
wildfire incidents in our
state? I doubt
that um
uh and local authorities
should identify locally
based air quality thresholds
so that they can take local
action. Uh
can't do that unless you
have the monitors there
locally just can't
be done. Um
Finally, like to
say, um
we also recommend
that um
financial risks from
climate change and extreme weather
would be factored into
um assessments
of any public
program,
you know, any bill
going forward.
Um We're going
to have the
worst of the
projections
experienced in our
state gonna have severe
consequences uh for
all of us.
And why would we
knowingly move
something, move the needle in the wrong
direction, move the needle
towards more greenhouse gas
emissions, you
know, unintentionally. Of course, I'm
sure that nobody intends
that. But
that's a recommendation that that
analysis be part
of every bill analysis
and fiscal analysis. I would
also say even the
State Investment
Council,
why should we invest more money
in projects than may
get us into further trouble?
And cause us more budget
consequences in the
future.
We need to pay attention and
use the data
for, for your decision
making. Um
And, and finally, I
find
that the business
sector is paying a
lot of attention to this
data
because of the act direct economic
costs for their businesses.
Um And
I've got a quote in there about
ask any risk, risk manager,
what's keeping them up at night and climate
change will likely be near the top
of their list.
Um, it's
everywhere in our
economy
and so that
concludes my presentation. I want
to thank you all very
much.
>> Um Thank you
to the panel questions from
the committee, first step by Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
and, and thank you all for your
presentation. Um
That's a lot of information
for sure. Uh
I wanted to start with
um
Doctor Du
Bois. Is that
correct Dubois?
I'm sorry. Um I was
curious, um Thank
you, I, you know, I sign up for your emails
and I get them, uh I get them
weekly or so
and, and read all
about the weather
and everything else that's happening in New
Mexico. So,
uh I was curious on
the weather stations,
you have the three different ones
listed and they all
pretty much do the same thing.
Can you tell me
the, the cost
difference between the two between
the three? Is it very different
or which would you
prefer to have?
>> Yeah, thanks for that question.
Um um Mr
Chairman and Representative
Armstrong. Um
So we uh I, I came
up with the design of three different types
of tiers and,
and like
I mentioned in the talk, there's
some areas where
it, I, there
wasn't room for a full,
a full weather station
and that's our, my
preference would be to do the tier
ones. Those are
the, the, the 33
ft or 10 m
towers. Um, just
because that
the, the height of
the, the winds,
wind speed, wind direction,
temperature and
humidity, um, is most
useful because it gets a above
the trees, trees. And that's,
that's kind of what,
um, why we do
that, the 10 m,
um, as opposed to the
lower ones and the lower
ones were good when
there's, um,
concern for view sheds.
Meaning I don't like,
I had some feedback from some,
some of the landowners,
like they didn't want a big
industrial
tower. And
so that it, it obstructs
like sunset view
or something, you know, I said, oh, yeah.
So we have a different, different
things and, and of course they,
um, they all, they all vary in
cost, um,
that there's, there's the hardware
cost and installation and there's
the maintenance cost, there's three
different different costs
associated with all the different,
the three different ones.
Um, the, the installation
costs. Um,
um, well, let me start with the,
the, the, the equipment costs.
There's, you know, with the, the,
the smaller system
it's around, you know,
with, I haven't
got a AAA current
quote. So these are real ball
really ballpark
figures, um, somewhere
around 7, 8000 for the
small going up to like
26,000
for the tier one.
And, uh, so that's kind of real
ballpark. And
then of course, it
takes, uh, people
to put these together,
um, somebody with
a skid steer and,
um, you
know, digging holes and
pouring concrete, you know,
which, you know,
depending on the contract, what
kind of contractors we get, you know,
that the cost
varies depending on how
far they have to travel and everything.
But, and then the
maintenance cost of, of, of
going out there. My goal is
to get quarterly uh
visits to all the sites
so that there, we know we catch
things before they, they
occur. Um,
you know, we're, we're not there
yet in terms of
a fully finished,
completely finished
network, it takes
some time and we're,
we're, we're getting, we're getting, we're getting
close to getting that, getting
that done. But, uh, um,
it takes it, the, the
maintenance costs are probably the
most, the most
costly
because it's, it's staff, it's
people, you know, hiring
people and having
full-time
technicians and their travel
and everything to hire them
long term. So,
yeah, II, I hope
that answers your question.
>> It does. Thank you, Mr Chairman
and, and thank you for that information.
I know my, my
friend, uh, representatives
aorta fights every year to
get, uh,
more of these across New
Mexico and, and if
climate change is such a
big deal, why aren't we funding
these? What this tells
us so many things
that, that would help
us give
us data.
And so, um I, that's
just a plug
for all across.
I see, I, I have several
in the area where I live
and that I represent. So
I, I was just curious on
the cost factor of that.
Uh My next question
um is
um and
I wasn't sure
if I,
I'm sorry, ma'am, I, I
didn't catch your name.
>> It's Claudia Borchard
Rhymes with Orchard.
>> OK. Thank you
for that. I was um I was
making notes fast and furious
on the back of this. And so we have
it in our presentation
and it was supposed to be
$577
million worth of grants
that we didn't get. Is that
correct? So we have the information
on what you wanted to use it
for, but New Mexico
didn't get this grant. Is
that correct,
>> Mr Chair Representative?
Yes, that is correct. We got that
news today.
>> That's unfortunate. I
was um I was
walk, you know, reading all of this
information and, and I
was what drew my
attention um was when
you said small businesses,
first of all, and then
secondly, was the
school buses
with the
um key
benefits to tribal.
So I was curious how many
applications did you
receive?
Um And did you
receive the applications or did this
go to the federal
government?
>> Um Mr Chair
Representative Armstrong.
Um Yes. No, this was an
application under the
climate pollution reduction
grant program. The same
one that's been plan that's been
funding our planning work.
And um so
these were applications
to the federal government.
Um If we were to
have gotten this money, then we
would be soliciting
for small businesses,
local school districts
and other local
governments to go after this
money. >> Ok. Thank you,
Mr Chairman. Thank you for that
clarification. I was just
thinking, I'd really like to
see an electric school bus
on a two hour bus drive
in Kamado one
way to school. So
that, that was my comment
on that. Um
And then I was
also
um
going to talk a little
bit and ask a few questions
to Mr Gooder.
Um
The
I I hear that, you know, you
made a statement about health councils.
Well, several of us have been
trying to get funding
Mr Chairman for health councils
across the State of New Mexico.
And so I, I would love it if you
called the governor on that because
she's not putting it in her
request.
Um The health councils
are requesting it but
the no
one else's and
so on the
um in
HSD
or through the governor.
So I, I would love
for you to, to let the governor
know that you'd like
to have health councils
funded.
The other thing
is
all of these that we, all the things
we're talking about. Actually
Mr Chairman, they
impact all of New
Mexico. So that includes
Children that
includes
businesses
that includes everything that
you do every single
day. And
so when we talk about these
things, like the
heat standards
is one,
businesses in
general want to keep their
employees, they want to keep their employees
safe, happy and healthy.
And but when we're
implementing
policy
that will make the cost
of doing business go
up
in an, in an environment
right now
where we have
astronomical
changes and, and
cost prohibitive to
do business to, to
get things done in New Mexico
to go out to lunch
because
the corn can't get raised
because we have no
water. The cows
can't get fed because of
drought.
The farmer can't
farm, the truck
driver can't truck
it. Uh The
refrigeration place
is
electric.
And so I just really want
people to remember all
aspects
of life when
we're talking about this
and the implementations
that happen when
you
make policy without
having everyone at the table.
I, I appreciate
a lot of the things I woke up
one morning. I have a
black vehicle and
I had ash
all over my
car
and the fire was not close to
me. It was the wind
carrying it. So I, I
understand I have 12
grandchildren. I understand
that we need to, to
do something about this. But I
want data
and I don't want data that
is
um
just collected in a
manner that
wants to tell one side of the
story. I want real
true data.
And so
um
I know a lot of people probably have
questions so I'll get off
my soapbox. But
when we just remember
that when we do this,
the implement the implications
of it uh are
grand to all
of New Mexicans.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative. We have
about 10 minutes left and we have
five people on the list. So
if you could keep your questions
brief and directed and your
answers brief as well. Uh
Next step, we have Representative
Lujan,
>> thank you, Mr Chair.
Um These
aren't simple
tasks of
information that we're
trying to get answers
or expand on
this conversation, which I think we really
need to. Um
So I'm just gonna go kind
of just directly to
um a couple of
our panelists um
from uh
Claudia. Thank you for being here.
I want, I'll start with you with our Clean
Fuels Act. Thank you for the update.
I was recently
at a conference
where California
presented on the in
Oregon, presented on
the clean fields uh acts
that they, each, each of those
states have, which is originated,
I believe in California. We've
now implemented ours
when I went to this, the
full discussion and it
was quite an impressive discussion
was very, just much focused
on California and how,
how um
well, they've implemented it but
they have a lot
more infrastructure,
especially with the biodiesel
fuels that they're using,
they actually have the plants
there. We do
not.
Um So I'd like to
know as we're
proceeding and we're, we're building
the board, the rules and
everything around our Clean
Fuels Act.
What is uh how are
we going to compare to what
they have been substantially
able to do in California
for New Mexico? When I asked the
presenters, one, a former
Oregon senator
who put forward the
legislation, he could not answer
me. Can
you Mr
Chair,
>> Mr Chair
Representative Louhan?
So let me make sure I understand the question
correctly. Is your question, how
will we get more biofuels to New
Mexico without the infrastructure
that that other states have that
>> correct? Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> OK. Um
So Mr Chair
Representative Lujan um
you know,
California's had their
program
since 2009.
And one of the surprising developments
that came out of that program was
the growth in the bio,
bio
fuels, specifically
renewable diesel right
now. Um Nationally,
we produce enough renewable
diesel to absorb
the in the new Mexico
anticipated
um portion of
renewable diesel to our state.
Um The infrastructure is not
there now,
but um but the
infrastructure will come
as the
producers of renewable
diesel and the distributors
of renewable diesel want to
expand into our market. So it's a,
it's a natural consequence
of having this policy in
place. >> Thank
you, Mr Mr Chair. I think we need more
updates as, as we move on,
as you as we're developing
uh this
uh as this policy is
enacted for our state.
Um It was quite
extensive in,
in their portfolio
if you will and what they were able
to do, which did not match to
our state whatsoever. So I'd like
to know where those infrastructure
needs are so that we can,
you know, I mean to put
the cart before the horse and not have
the infrastructure for me is a problem.
So I want to make sure that we have that
infrastructure and we're working towards
that in that regard.
So thank you there. The next thing I want to
talk about, Mr Chair is very much what
Mr gunmaker
um kind of finalized
in his um
discussion here. Uh the financial
risk factored
into our bills.
Um, and if we don't,
if we're not gonna factor in those
risks and those factors are where we are,
we're not on a one off
type of situation anymore when
we're talking about climate
change and the
emergency events that we have
in the, the
fires and the floods and so
on. And I wanted to commend
you for saying that. So my question to you
as you're looking at as a
policy
um
analyst producer uh
for your organization,
what are you looking at the,
as far as
maybe
recovery bonds for our
state or how we are
going to be able to absorb some of
these costs even
into our utilities who are,
are struggling right now
because of the cause and
effect of our fires
and flooding and everything else
involved in climate change. Mr
Chair.
It's a big question if you can't answer
it all together, but is there
a policy you're working directly on
the cost and, and
um and how we're gonna
deal with that with the
state?
>> Yes, we are
working towards
that,
developing a comprehensive
recommendation that would speak
to the cost issue, but we're not there
yet. I'm sorry. Just don't have
that information. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. It's very, it's quite
comprehensive, that's, that's really,
really wanted to get into Mr Chair, the
cost and, and what we're the
risk of us not meeting the
demand right now, not
understanding the complete
cost and what this is doing
to our state and how we combine
that even with the conversation with what we're
doing with the, the big
clean fuels bill that we
have, I would like to,
we have to have a bigger
conversation and
our climatologist. Thank you for being
here. I'll talk to you offline. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative Lujan. Uh
We have four minutes.
Our list is getting longer.
Um
I represent Scott
briefly.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
with
respect
to clean
fuels.
It looks to me like to
track the
emissions
of a transportation
motor fuel combustion
process are pretty much
fixed.
Yeah.
About if you
include the entire
life cycle
of that gallon of
gasoline, about
13
plus or minus
kilograms per
gallon. The
family
average family in New Mexico
is gonna burn
about 500
gallons or
at the time you work them through
the math's
six
metric tons of
co2 emissions
per year
now
because the emissions are
fixed by
combustion
physics
at a 20%
reduction
in these emissions will be
required.
How
will that be achieved?
And if it's
going to be achieved the
way it has been in
California
with clean fuel
credits?
Can you tell me
approximately
what one
of these credits
will
cost
>> Mr Chair Representative
Scott. Um
we are
in the process now of doing
some feasibility analysis
and economic impact
analysis that will help address
those questions. I
do want to
point out that the
um part of
the uh
the mix of
fuels that we
anticipate
um be
a meeting. The 2030
20% emission
reduction targets includes
other forms
of transportation
fuels that do not
result in combustion
such as electricity.
Um renewable diesel, of course
would also would
include um
combustion.
But the overall
footprint of renewable
diesel is lower
than the footprint of
fossil gasoline
and diesel. So there's a
reduction in
the carbon emissions
from that as
well.
>> So Mr
Chairman,
there,
there is no idea.
And in California,
they run for
the west coast runs
about
$100 per
metric ton. Is that,
is that a
reasonable number
to, to be
working
from
>> Mr Chair, Representative Scott, I
believe the credit prices
right now, they vary, they
vary. It's a market
are as low as 20
to $30 per credit
ton right now in
California
>> and Mr Chairman, as high as
about $450
in British
Columbia.
But and
here's, here's the
math
for every
$100
of value
in a carbon
credit
because all of
the chemistry
of that combustion
is fixed,
we impact the
consumer
24 cents
a gallon
of
fuel.
So as
we develop
this carbon
credit process
for Joe
Schmo,
putting diesel
in his welding
truck,
we need to keep in mind
the costs
associated
to
with that process
to our New Mexico
consumers
and balance that against
the benefits
that these folks are
deriving from
those additional expenditures.
Thank you, Mr Chairman and
thank you for your
answer.
>> Thank you, Representative
Scott. Uh We
are, we are at
time. We have
six people up.
Representative
Sarinana.
>> Thank you Mr
Chairman.
It surprised me there
um in
New Mexico. Thanks for your presentation
in New Mexico. We have
uh we know that um climate
change is caused by the burning
of fossil fuels. Right?
And um our
fossil fuel industry, gas and oil
is our biggest contribute to,
contributed to our budget.
But they also,
um right
now it was just in the paper in Carlsbad,
in Albuquerque that 60%
of the industry is, is not
following the Clean Air Act. And that's
the only thing we can really hold them to
is keeping our air clean
60%. And
when we look to, to
go to, to um bring
some perspective, there's about
70,000
wells in New Mexico,
70,000
50% would be 35
60% would be
42,000 wells
polluting
daily. So
um part of this climate
change, maybe we
really, what we have to
do is really um
hold our the
gas oil um
industry accountable
for their pollution and we
have bills for that coming up this
session. But
I, I think
um
in another committee, we were talking about this
and how we can't seem to
pass bills out that
will hold them
accountable.
And you know, we could
pass, try to pass bills for
years. But the kids
who and I have a setbacks
bill. The kids who go to school
within a mile of, of an
extraction site are
being exposed to cancer,
benzene, cancer causing agents
every day. There's
one
district Unice which has
100 and 59 pump jacks
around its schools. So we have
even half of them, 8080
are emitting cancer
causing agents. Those kids are getting
sick. So it's time
not only for climate change but
that New Mexico
and we as legislators
think about what we're doing to our
kids because of an industry
that's not doing what they're
supposed to do. And following
the Clean Air Act, there are
certain things everybody has to
do and, and this
industry must
follow these air, the Clean
Air Act because it's New
Mexico's who are New Mexicans
who are getting hurt, kids who are
getting hurt, frontline, people are getting
hurt and we can't seem to do anything
about it. So that is something
we're looking at this year in the legislature
for, for the next session.
But I think
if we had
42,000
wells not polluting,
that would really help with climate
change. And,
um,
that's something we're looking at. So
hopefully we can do something about it.
Hopefully they listen and, and
try to be good
stewards of what we've given them
and, and the leases they have
and uh take care of the new
Mexicans. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, representative represent
Samora
briefly.
>> Thank you madam
chair and thank
you. I mean
Mr Chair,
uh
in the comment just
made,
I wonder if, when we
legislate, if we
could put a carrot
out there
and give the oil
companies back some of their
money for
cleaning up their
act.
We take their money and we
spend their money and we take
more of their money and we put more
regulations on them
and we never help
the industry
that's helping us the
most. Just a quick
comment. Uh I don't want
to debate here today that much,
but so,
uh I want to thank
Doctor Dave Dubois for being
here today.
I know you've been working hard
for years now on this
weather station modification.
ZT.
Uh the
way this came about
uh to the
legislature
is
that we had
problems in the AG
community not
receiving their claims
on insurance
policies.
And isn't it great that
we've gotten into some
work? And it has
expanded
just like we talked in the
preliminary meetings
leading up to this
about how
it would just, he
only help the AG community,
but it would help the state of New
Mexico.
And here we're seeing
in this meeting where
with the data
that we're, we're cooling
uh occurring
that it's gonna
help with maybe health
problems, uh
safety issues is
what we talked about in the
preliminary meetings
with travel.
Uh
It's a great thing that we've
done for New Mexico.
We have uh
I believe
uh the last conversation
me and you had doctor was,
was four or five other states
following us.
Uh And what we're doing
the work we're doing in this
area.
I look forward
to supporting you
and, and hopefully the legislature
does too, to
support you
and, and your work that
you've done.
Uh as
we go forward
and keep
us abreast of, of what's going
on and, and how
your cash flows are and
stuff. And I know
that
we talked
about
income that this was gonna
produce because we're
gonna sell this information
to people who
supply information at the
national level.
And
this is, this has been
a good thing for New
Mexico. I appreciate
all the support
we got from all the legislators.
It took, it took me
a little while to get everybody to
understand what it was about.
But once we did, we,
we, everybody
got on board, we even had
to support
from the national level
uh from our congress people
in, in DC.
That was great to see
uh as we move
forward. Uh
And I know we're, we're short on
time. I wish we had more time
so that we could get more into the
weeds of this.
It's, it's a very important
project. Hope to see
it move forward in a
positive way.
And if you have any more comments,
uh Doctor Duwa, I'd like
to hear him now if, if you
have a comment about what I said.
Thank you.
>> Yes, thank um Mr
Chairman Representative
Zamora. I appreciate that.
Um And um, we're
um working
on getting the, the
connections with the USDA
programs. Um
just as a short kind of
update. We're, we're working
with the, uh our
federal partners with
the dealing with the Farm
Bill connection. Um And that
that's an ongoing thing.
It's a, it's a big ask because
there's trying to find
out all of the different
people to, to contact
and uh is a
um it, it takes
time but uh we're, we're getting
there and uh
and appreciate y'all's
um patience
in getting all these stations
deployed and, and, and, and it's being
used. Um
The National Weather Service
is really appreciative of
the, the um collaboration
that we have and um but,
but it's out
um out there
helping um
with the drought,
drought impacts. And that's kind
of our, our, our impetus
in getting this started in the
first place. And I really appreciate that.
Thank you. >> Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair and
Dave for that. Uh
Another good
thing to understand about this
program is this is
bringing new money into the state
of New Mexico.
This is bringing money
to support the AG
community
that has to deal with climate
change and, and
the droughts that we're
having.
Uh And
that kind of concludes my question
to you, Doctor Dubo. I
do have a question
for anybody in the panel that
cares to answer it
is I was watching a
documentary the other
day
and it contradicted
everything we're doing today on
climate change.
It talked about
core samples
in the ice, the
polar ice
cap
and it, it
stated
that the
higher the
carbon
in the atmosphere
or in our ozone or
whatever
it stated that when we
have an ice age is
when we had
the most carbon
in our atmosphere.
So it, it
goes totally against
what we're doing right now.
I know
that the data shows that we're
seeing more carbon and we're seeing
hotter temperatures.
But can anybody explain to
me why
the scientists were telling
us on that
documentary
that it takes
so much carbon in the air
and more than we have now,
the levels are a lot
higher
to have an ice
age.
Can somebody explain that to
me?
>> Um Mr Chairman
Representative Zamora.
Yeah, the
the the data
that being that was been
collected at the say like the
Greenland ice ice
ice cores and
um you know, they go
back hundreds of thousands
of years of, you know, by, by
dating them.
Um as
we as we look at
the,
the bigger picture, it's,
it's not only
the the
CO2
temperature, but there's other things
that go on, especially if you go back
way way further back
than we're talking
about for our problem
right now, you know, in the last
say 2, 200
years when they're
looking at the the
time scales of the
the ice cores, you're talking about
the um
other impacts that are
um
driving climate change
or some of them are
natural and then some of them
are, I mean, those are all
natural cycles going,
going the way back. You know, if you're talking
about 100,000, 200 million
years going all that, that
timescale with the
oscillating of the
um or orbit
around the sun, the the
tilting of the earth, the o
there's a there's a
um
kind of like a top, you know, going
around that, that's also
changing in there. So there's all
those that are part of
the,
the model that's put together
to understand those, those
um ice core um
changes in the,
in the
and all those kind of drive
the, the
historical climate going
back. Um
You know, that those are different
than what we're talking about today
to today's issue
is the short term,
you know, those, those are gone, that
those are 10,000 year
or more 30,000
year cycles. What we're talking
about with our current
problem now is, is
uh we're we're changing the composition
of the atmosphere in a very short
time period on the order of, you know,
100 years, you know,
so that that's the
kind of understanding the
the mechanisms,
the dynamics of the earth, you
know, at different time scales.
Um I, I don't
know if it makes sense, but it's sort of,
those are two separate things that
the time scale of the
ice cores and then what we're talking
about for
our issue more
talking about today. So,
>> so there's a lot of factors that can
change the climate.
And what
what concerns me is are
we chasing the tiger by the
tail and we
could have a higher
carbon
uh the amount
in the in the atmosphere and
still be in a nice age
and, and I wonder
>> Representative Zamora, we
need to move on.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you representative Zamora.
So we're, we're over time.
Um We started a
little late. The presentations ran
a little long, I apologize
about that. I want to get
back on time, but I don't
want to
prevent people from asking
questions. Ok. So I
have, I'll take myself off
the list. I still have three more
people. I need
very short questions and short
answers. Senator
Stewart.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I'll
take my six questions and
move it down to one. I
won't talk to Dave or
Charles maybe
offline. I'll just
ask Claudia who I
know from a float trip
down the Rio Chama
20 years ago, we had a
lot of
water. So I
just want to say that this.
So these grant
applications, can you
break it down by
amount for this
577 million
for each of these
projects?
>> Um Mr Chair
um
Mayor Pro
TEM uh roughly yes,
I don't have those numbers exactly in front
of me, but I know that the,
the Zen 40 was the bulk
of it with around
490
million. Um
The cap on each individual
application for the CPR
G grant was 500
million. So we were
really um just
we were going big
and um for
the clean truck
incentive and
the school bus,
the clean schools,
those were around
500 million
each. I'm sorry, 50
million each. So a
combined total
of 100 million.
So >> thank you. Mr Chairman. And
it's my understanding that,
you know, these climate pollution
reduction grant programs
like others where you
have to apply. A
lot of people are
applying. There's a lot of
money, but there's a lot of
application needs.
So I know that the
Department of Transportation
didn't get their Wildlife
Quarters grant. But
the grantee said this is a
great, uh, uh,
application just
do it again next year.
We've had too many
people apply. So I'm
hoping that you will
think about that. But my one
question to you
is on this
front graph.
Um
And
I guess I'll, I'll, I'll
bring it down to one
question. What
does the Environment
Department need
to work
on greenhouse gas
emission reduction?
I mean, you, you, you, you've
got quite a graph. I
don't know how you're going
to do this.
So, is it
personnel, if so,
how many more is it the
monitoring issue that
represent Sarinana broke
brought up?
How are we
going to reduce these
emissions? What do you need to
really do this? Because
I'm skeptical
that we're going to get
there
briefly, >> Mr
Chair and
Senator Stewart. Thank you for that
question. Um
It's one that I didn't really
highlight in my presentation,
but really the climate work
is a network of people doing
a lot of work all
simultaneously.
Um This piece that we're working
on to reduce the emissions,
of course, is only, uh this
is about reducing emissions.
We know that the work to a
adapt and be resilient
is equal important. We
know that the work is important at
every level of government.
Um So federal,
state, local government,
we also know the work is important
outside of government. All
the businesses that need to contribute
all the individuals. It's
a, it's a all hands on deck
effort. So,
um so your question about
what
nmed might need
to help get the work
done? Um Well,
I think that what we need is
also for all the partners
involved to be
funded. And so
as local governments
um come to requests to the
legislature looking for funding
for their projects that help
reduce climate emissions. I think
that kind of supporting their work
is important, getting,
getting staff
at all these different levels of
government is important. We
um we have
funding from the legislature
of $4.1 million. It's going
to fund us through
the development of the clean fuel
standard. We will
be, be seeking in
our budget to,
to have more FTE
to continue the work past the
special appropriation.
Um We
also, we also know
that, you know, tax incentives
are very important and very helpful
for local
businesses and individuals.
Um You all passed
the, uh, the zero
emission vehicle tax
credit that that goes
into effect. I think it's when in effect
March fif uh May
15th. So that's really
important for the light duty sector.
Um, it's also really important to figure
out some incentives for the medium and
heavy duty. Mr >> Chairman.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna interrupt.
I, I understand what
you're saying. So you've got
legislators and they're saying,
what does the Environment
Department need to
reduce emissions?
And you're telling me what
everybody needs, it's
for you.
>> I apologize for that. What do we
need? We need some FTEs
and, um,
we support of the f
of our, our, our
budget,
um,
and an extension of
the, um, climate,
the special appropriation that
we got to fund climate
change. >> How much was
that, Mr Chairman? >> That was
4.1 million, um,
for two >> years. Ok.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator
Senator Woods
briefly for a question
briefly.
>> What is the environmental department
vacancy rate on their staff
right
now?
>> Um Mr
Chair, Senator
Woods, I don't
know that off the top of my
head,
>> Mr Chair Senator Woods, I'm
not sure of the exact number.
I know for the
division that I oversee
the environmental protection, it's close
to. We have about 20
to 30 out of 100.
So I'd say about 20%.
We are however, really
excited about the
recent appropriate
placement that has made us much
more competitive and we are seeing
more applicants and we are
also
trying to be more aggressive
in how we
recruit
to fill. And I'm happy
to say that all the vacancies
in the our division
anyway are now in process
of being advertised. >> The only point
I'm trying to make Mister
Chair
is agencies constantly
come to us asking
for more money. And one
of their request is
for more
staff.
And yet at the end of the
year, they transfer
money out of staff and
benefits and put
it somewhere else
because they can't
hire staff. Now they
come for special
appropriation to
hire staff,
but they don't get their staff
hired. I'm not saying it's
your particular
fault. I'm
saying the professional
staff is not in the State of New
Mexico. So we have
to import staff from out
of state is what I
assume. I don't know
why we can't get
college and universities
with our state.
Uh to make it a
priority. We, we're,
we're funding education
in those areas.
Uh Couldn't we put a
tagline on that funding
to say you have to
work in State
binge were paying for your
education.
But as you
know, we don't do
that. I don't
mean to rag on you guys.
It's not your fault,
but it is the
fault of somebody
that we can't
educate our kids to
fill our own jobs.
And it's sad.
Uh, >> thank you, Senator
Woods. Just >> one other
question
and it's a yes or no
question.
Didn't the Supreme
Court
have a ruling
on Co Two gas
and EPA, as far as
their
regulations,
>> Mr Chair, Senator
Woods, I can't
do that in a yes or no
answer
>> and thank
>> you. Thank
you. Last step very
briefly.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I'll be
real brief and Mr
Dubois, I'm gonna cut
right to the chase on
this. I was
watching a
program on
the environment and
I was amazed to see
that the most
oxygen created
for the world comes from
the ocean.
70%. Is that
true?
>> Uh
Mr Chair representative,
um yeah, there's
the ocean does
a tremendous amount
of work for us.
It um it absorbs
a lot
of carbon dioxide
provides oxygen.
Um I mean, there's a lot of
other sources of oxygen out there,
including forests across
the the globe,
but I don't know that the
exact numbers off the top of my
head, but I mean it, it
does provide,
yeah,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman.
And I think the point that we
see on that is we've
got to get back to
logging in our forest
to make them healthier
and prevent
the big wildfires.
Mister Chairman and
mister or
any of the panelists.
When we look at our
cities, we
look at black
asphalt
and buildings that
absorb
heat.
Has there been any movement
to make like
asphalt, white in
color or something like
that to reduce
sucking up the
heat?
>> Representative Rehm Mr
Chair,
just try to be super
brief. Um I don't know
specifically about asphalt
itself but, but
uh there are movements
to
stop
paving so much of like
the medians and allow
for grasses which actually
absorb carbon, you know,
to grow and maybe
not mow them so much
uh which also
of course, produces carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere,
etcetera. So I can't
answer directly about asphalt
though.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
And then lastly,
uh this isn't a question.
I think we need to
work with other countries
like China,
India uh
to get them more on
board to reduce their
footprint. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative Rehm. Thank
you members of the
panel.
So our next panel is climate
uh climate change, health
and economic impacts
the panelists could
comport.
Yeah.
Do we not have uh
Susans?
Sorry. Oh,
she's online.
Ok.
Ok. So we have uh
we have our first online
presentation of the day.
Um
Susan, I'd like to go to you
first. Are we ready to do
that?
>> Uh Yes,
I'm just see if I can
share my screen.
Good >> morning. Ok, so
good morning everyone. I I apologize
about the timing of the last
panel. Uh, we are
now pinched for time.
Um, I was gonna
ask the Panelist to
sort of aim for about a 10 minute
target. Um,
if you could squeeze that down,
uh, then we can have a
more robust discussion
afterwards.
Uh So Susan, I don't
know how to pronounce your last name, but you're up
first.
So the,
the, the legislators have your hand
out. Uh If
are we putting the screen
up, can we flip
through her sides slides for
her? Ok. I think
we're good. Go ahead.
>> Oh,
ok.
Um
We, our
advocacy relies
heavily on scientific
data about the clean
economy. Um
And the, the, I mean, the
third slide,
um
we
uh we
update our critical
reports on a yearly
basis and we
really hope that lawmakers can
use these
uh uh
reports to
help craft policy.
Um
We also
in my fourth slide,
um my E two's
executive director, Bob Keith
published uh this
book called Climate
Comics a couple of
years ago. And in it,
it documents the cost
of our changing climate to the US
economy.
Um
And it really tries to illustrate
the economic threats of not
acting to reduce our impacts
by reducing greenhouse gas
and other pollutants.
And that was kind of a basis
for uh
uh uh
reports that we
published in, in the next
the coming years about the
economic cost
to uh
not do anything about
the in our climate
disaster. Um
On the fifth slide,
um this
is um a
snapshot from
2021 on the
impact of climate related
disasters. And
we know that very well, but it
hasn't diminished in the last few
years in the United
States as of uh in
20 21 there was over
100 and $50 billion
in climate related damage.
There were the past
five years before that
were most, four most
expensive hurricanes,
three most expensive
wildfires, the most
expensive trees and the
most expensive
thunderstorm.
Um, as a result, we found
that we find that homeowners
insurance has gone up
about 40%
fire suppression
costs. Um,
$4 billion in
2021 which is
two times 2020.
And of course crap insurance is
going up. And for those
who may not know that's
my car. Uh, my
house was destroyed in a marshal
fire. So it's
kind of personal for
me.
Um In slide six.
I'd like you to see
the, um, as
of 2023 the local
impacts of our
climate
disaster in New
Mexico.
Um So
the statewide losses from
1980 to 2022
are $5.2
billion.
Um In
2023 the spring
fall drought was,
had economic loss of
100 to $250
million. Um
And we still don't know the
results of the economic
impacts of the
South Fork and salt
fires. But
we know that there are folks
who died, many
structures lost
over
1400/8000
people displaced.
And of course, we have
still the
Ritos and muscular
fire and the flooding in Las
Vegas from fires,
stars. So we know that
um the cost
of our climate changing
climate is not going
away. It's,
it's on a regular
basis.
Um
And we also have heard from
uh like ranchers in
Las Vegas who's
concerned about the future income
from his ranch that grows
Christmas trees this
year. He couldn't cut any Christmas
trees. What about next year and
about the year after?
So, you know, ranchers
have lost income year after
year. So it's, it's
not just the immediate cost that
damage our communities, but we
can also see it's happening
uh in the
future.
Um And so in
slide seven, I'd like to
turn your attention to
um results of
uh our
2023 clean
Jobs fact sheet, which we're
still waiting for the
20 the
information to be published for the
2024 fact
sheet. But
um we'd
like to uh we, we'd
like to talk about how moving
toward a clean economy
will provide stable jobs
while also reducing
greenhouse gas emissions
and grow the
economy.
Um Our work of E
two focuses
around these clean jobs and
other reports.
This is a chart from our
2023 New Mexico
Clean Jobs fact sheet.
The clean energy
sector has proven to be
an economic catalyst. You
can see how it's
been. Um Well,
at the end of uh
2022
2, there were over
12,700
clean energy workers in the
state that's
a um
12.6%
increase over the past
two years.
Um We expect
in this next report to see
another 6% growth
in the total clean energy
workers. Um
And one out of five
energy jobs are in
clean
tech.
Um slide
eight
describes
the sectors that we track
in our clean jobs back
sheets. Um
You can see it's broken up between
energy efficiency,
renewables, clean
vehicles, grid and storage
and fuels. This is how we
define the clean
economy or what we
track. Um And
what's interesting is that energy
efficiency is the largest
sector. Um
It's uh about
50% more than the next
highest renewable
generation. And in
energy efficiency, you know, there's
just a ton of variety
of um jobs,
everything from
efficient lighting
HV AC,
um advanced
materials, manufacturing
installation. And uh
there's also engineering jobs.
It's a very large
sector that
really can be applied
throughout the economy
and throughout the state.
Uh because we know how
important energy efficiency
is to reduce our greenhouse
gas emissions.
And then it's of course, followed
by uh renewable energy,
solar, wind,
geothermal.
Those are the main, main
categories as well as
some hydro and
bioenergy.
Um clean
vehicles is growing quickly
and also
um is,
is one of the quickest sectors
that's growing.
Um In the next slide, it
really shows how over the
last few
years those
sectors have grown and
uh clean vehicles is growing
the fastest. That's not
that surprising with all
the um the
uh energy that's going
into uh
electrifying our, our
vehicles and all
the infrastructure
um to support that
electrification. But
um everything but
biofuels has been
increasing over the last couple
of years.
Um In slide
10, we have
the
how we break down
these clean jobs
um in
by employment.
So it's kind of
interesting that
um we all know
that small businesses are the
economic engine of our country,
but our data supports
us. Um Over
85% of the clean
energy jobs in New Mexico
are with small
businesses, less
than 100 employees,
another 8
11.5% are
with businesses, less than 500
employees.
Um And actually 500
is technically considered a
small business still by the
federal government.
So just 2.9%
of these jobs are big businesses.
And so, you
know, I'd like to conclude with the idea
that there's a huge
opportunity for entrepreneurship
in the clean economy. We're
not looking at starting big
huge companies, we're looking
at starting a lot of little
companies
um
and really building personal
wealth
as far as the value
chain of a clean
employment. Um
Most of the jobs are
in professional services and
construction. There's
almost two times more in
construction. And then you can see
the other uh
areas of uh
employment including manufacturing,
which is is growing
and I'll tell more, talk more about
that later.
And slide twe 12,
we also document
uh the demographics of
the clean energy employment
and workers.
Um And it's
interesting that New Mexico has the
most diverse clean energy
workforce in the
nation. But
that still is uh
limits that there's
20 almost
21% Hispanic
or Latino,
Almost 13% multi
racial,
7.8%
black or African American,
7.5%
Asian and
uh 28% of the clean
energy workers are
women. So
I think there's um
ample um
opportunity to
increase the diversity
of the
people working in the clean
energy
sector.
We also
um
published a 2020 report
which admittedly
means updating,
but we did find that
um clean energy job wages
are 25% above
the median national wage for
the US and for New
Mexico, clean energy
job wages are
about almost 12%
above the state's median
wage. So,
and clean energy jobs
are more often
you include
benefits.
That's a part for,
for
um the slide 14.
Um
We finally, we know how
important our federal investments
are to the nation and to
New Mexico.
Um and the Match New
Match Fund Act will help aid
in helping to apply for
even more grant
funding.
So there has been
announcements since
2022
of the Inflation Production
Act. Six projects
to date are earmarked
for New Mexico.
We have wind solar
battery ev grid
solar manufacturing
um at various
locations across the
state. Um
This, we believe this will
result in about
2500 additional
clean tech tech jobs
and as a result of one
point over $1.2
billion of investments in New
Mexico already in the
state.
Um
So
it's great news.
Um We hope
that tomorrow will be coming
using the Match Fund Act,
hopefully some from the greenhouse
gas reduction fund.
So there will be some money
um
uh earmarked for
uh communities that
really have been left behind in this
transformation.
And then the other question that
I kind of wanna um leave you
with is
um
an area that we really
care deeply about and that's
work, workforce development
and training. And
as uh you know,
something to think
about what policies
can help expand opportunities
to enter the clean economy.
Whether there are high school
graduates, do I need
to go to college? What's out there
for training? Are there
apprenticeships with unions?
Um The IBW I think
is always looking for electrician.
We have a huge electrification,
workload ahead
of us. Um There's
gonna be high tech manufacturing.
You can see that from the
IRA investments
just um on
this slide and
do college grads know what
opportunities
uh aweigh them in
the clean economy
and finally does someone
in working in a different
area want you to train and enter
the clean tech
workforce. These are
all um
issues that I think it would
be very helpful to
grapple with through
policy, really
encouraging um
a lot more training
uh to, to uh
enter the this workforce,
which is we
see a great expansion
for this foreseeable future.
And um just to leave you
with, again, the
reason why we're so passionate about
the clean economy is because
we can both
um have economic
benefits for people in
the state as well
as um you
know, reducing our greenhouse
gas emissions. So it's a
win win situation
and that's how I have. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Susan.
Um I think that works
reasonably well. Uh Laura
Pascu, thank you for joining
us,
>> Mr
Chair.
Sorry about that, Mr
chair members of the
committee. Thank you for having me here
today. I think it's
maybe a little bit unusual
for a journalist to be sitting
here. So I
appreciate you having me
today. Um My name
is Laura Pasca. I'm a long
time reporter and
I've been covering New Mexico environmental
issues since 2002
for print
online radio and now
public television
also authored a book a few years
ago about the dangers
of climate change here in New
Mexico that came out from the
University of New Mexico
Press in 2020.
And it's safe to say
that that book needs some
updating because we've seen
an acceleration of climate
impact since that
time. Um as
this meeting was scheduled originally
for Rudo. So I don't
think I need to
um you know,
tell any of you
about the seriousness of the
impacts of human cost,
climate change in New
Mexico. Um And
I'm really grateful that the committee
is focusing on this really
important issue.
Um So thank you for
that.
Um
More and more New Mexicans are
feeling the impacts of climate
change across the state. This will
not lessen over
time nor will it become
less expensive to
address over time.
So I first started reporting
on climate change in earnest
in 2005.
Um I attended a talk
by Doctor David
Gutzler, Professor
Emeritus at the
University of New Mexico.
And um I
remember being very shocked,
I knew about climate
change. I knew it was something
that scientists were
talking about for the
future. Um
That talk in 2005
struck me because Dr Gutzler
was talking about
what was happening right
at that moment, he was talking
about our lengthening
growing seasonss, our water
challenges, um
fire season.
Um And I remember this because I
was pregnant at the time
and I am just
about to bring my daughter to college
in a couple of weeks. So
we've known about these impacts for
a very long time
and I continue to be surprised
by how little our
society has done to
address these serious
issues. Um
So since that time,
I've continued to speak to people
across my reporting
career,
scientists, agency,
professionals, advocates,
elders,
um
people who spend their careers
trying to protect species
that are in danger of
disappearing. People
who have suffered from the
impacts of warming
people who are dedicating their
lives to gathering more
data and making sure
that we all understand climate
change better. I've
interviewed scientists,
policymakers, politicians,
all sorts of different people.
And sadly, over the last
20 years, I've also witnessed the
barriers to action on climate
change in New Mexico.
I also talked to plenty of
people um
who will only talk to me
off the record but who
confess their serious
concerns about
what's happening and what they have
and have not been able to do over
the years.
Um So
just to briefly
make mention
of some of the public health impacts
that I reported on over the
years, we're gonna continue
to see a rise in certain
illnesses including asthma
and respiratory disease from
things like smoke and poor air
quality. There's also
more and more studies that are being
done about the long term
dangers of wildfire
smoke, which oftentimes
contains a mix of
chemicals. Um
you know, ranging from things
from asbestos to industrial
chemicals as homes and
furniture and vehicles and
infrastructure burn.
We'll also continue to see
a rise in diseases
like West um
West Nile and Valley
fever and the
possibility for increased
spread of diseases like Zika
Dengue, a certain species of
mosquitoes
travel north and they also
have a longer
season.
Um Of course,
we all know about the physical
and mental health impacts
from fires and floods
and heatwaves and all the
various climate disasters in our
communities.
Um We should also be
considering what is
occurring within our prisons,
schools and our athletic
fields even in our pet
shelters as it gets
hotter and hotter. And we see
lengthening um
heatwaves. These have
incredible impacts on
people's physical and mental
health. Um We
know that as it gets warmer
and we see these longer
and hotter
heatwaves, people who work
outside suffer
and oftentimes die.
This can be
agricultural workers. This
can be your mailman.
This can be sanitation workers.
If you live in the Albuquerque area.
You remember last summer during the
heatwave, we were getting
alerts about how sanitation
workers were having to shift their
schedules because it was dangerous
for them to be operating in
our landfills.
Um Heatwaves
also put, oh sorry, certain
common medications make
people more vulnerable to heat
related illnesses.
This is something that I reported
on this year. There's a lot of work
that Project Echo is doing
around this and trying
to train health care workers
to be watching out for these
dopaminergic medications
in particular, make people
very vulnerable to heat
impacts all of
these things. Put incredible
strain on our hospitals,
clinics and emergency workers,
including our wildland
firefighters who
are facing incredible
challenges as our wildfire
season lengthens and
intensifies.
Um We
also know, I
think each one of us can
feel these heatwaves,
make us madder,
sadder and
unhappier heatwaves
have an incredible number
of impacts across
all populations.
Um Some of you right now
as we're talking about this issue
today might be feeling some
climate anxiety.
This is a real thing
that is serious,
particularly among
young people. Um I think
it's a particularly dangerous
health public health
problem um because
it makes people feel
apathetic or
despairing or cynical.
Um And we know that none
of those emotions
are particularly helpful as
we're trying to mitigate and adapt
to emergencies. And
even though I still call
myself um an
environmental reporter after all
these years, climate
change is not just an environmental
issue, it is a very serious
economic issue.
So you can go to the next slide,
please. Um To mention
just some of the economic
issues in brief.
Again, none of these will get
cheaper or easier to deal
with over time. Um
crop losses across
scale from your
your local farmer
to large scale
farms and ranches. This
includes tribal economies
that um
need agricultural
profits as part of their
tribal economy.
Um I was just talking
to a rancher, I was up
in Mora the other
day. Um
seeing the continued
impacts from the hermit's
peak, calf canyon wildfires
up there. I'm talking
to a rancher who
has had to cut his
herd down um
since the fire in
part, because people aren't able
to plant because the
AACS aren't necessarily
able to deliver
irrigation water. He's having to
drive further and further
to buy more and more expensive
hay and cutting
his herd each
year. Um
Just to mention briefly,
there was an N MS U
study more than
15 years ago about the
reduction of water supplies
due to warming.
Um The authors wrote
at that time that
ecosystems are at greatest
risk in New Mexico followed
by agricultural water
users as water is
increasingly transferred to
maintain urban and industrial
uses whose economic
productivity is greater.
While total economic
losses are estimated in the
vicinity of $300
million a year. This
was a study more than 15
years ago. Please remember
under severe climate
changes where runoff is reduced
by nearly 30%
losses are likely to
be extremely
higher. Um,
we know from fires
and floods, real estate and business
losses. We're hearing
more and more about the increased
cost of homeowners insurance
and in places where people are no
longer to even get
homeowners insurance.
Um, something we
don't talk about very much
is the medical costs, the
public health costs lost
work wages due
to disasters,
heatwaves.
Um You know, these
various impacts,
losses to tourism
can't raft a river. If there's
no water in it can't visit a
forest if there are
no trees left.
Um disaster
and disaster response.
Incredibly expensive.
A huge burden on local
communities, tribal communities,
state and federal
governments. Um
We're dealing not just with the
cost of fighting bigger fires
in a longer fire season,
but this incredible post
fire flooding for
many years, but also
drought and extreme storms
and weather. And of
course, I have
to emphasize
that these economic
costs um
affect people of color
in low income communities
disproportionately and
people who are already
feeling many
different systemic
challenges.
Um And any conversation
about climate change, mitigation
or adaptation always
needs to include
equity as a part of that
conversation.
Um
And I just want to talk about
um in talking about the ways
that humans,
um we need to
adapt to these changes
these accelerating changes,
these more and more expensive
changes, I want to be very
clear that
all of these actions
also have to be accompanied
by meaningful climate mitigation
strategies. And most of all an
immediate reduction in greenhouse
gas emissions from
the oil and gas industry in
New Mexico, Dr
Dubois earlier
mentioned um
the work of the
IPCC and the
climate assessments
um in 2018
which is now six years
ago, the Intergovernmental
panel on climate change
reported that humans must
drastically reduce greenhouse
gas emissions in the next
decade. That was six years ago.
They told us that failing
to do so means failing to hold
warming below safe levels
on this planet and it will
have catastrophic and
irreversible impacts
upon the earth's
ecosystems.
In 2022 the world
scientists again issued
an emergency warning, a
warning of a climate emergency.
And last year
scientists with the IPCC
issued their final
warning on the climate
crisis as the
guardian newspaper
reported at that time,
that synthesis report is
almost certain to be the last
such assessment. While
the world still has a chance
of limiting global temperature
rise to
1.5
°C above
pre industrial levels.
That is the threshold,
just a reminder
beyond which damage
to our climate will
rapidly become
irreversible.
Um If you wouldn't mind going to
slide four, please. So
we're hearing about
um the terrible news
out of Rudo. So
um certainly there's
still a lot of
um impacts
from the Hermit's PCA Canyon.
Black fires, plenty of
fires we've had in the last few years. But I
just wanted to show you all this
slide less conscious
you all remember burned in
2011.
Um This is what
the eastern flank of
the JME mountains
look like more than 10
years after the fire.
These fires have
extreme
footprints. They
change the watershed.
You'll see this.
This used to be a dense
Conifer forest. Our climate
is warming and drying.
We don't have the same
forests growing back
in some of these burn scars.
Um Looking downstream
of here, you can't see
it in the slide but the bottom left
slide. Um Kochie
Reservoir is there so you can
see how these big fires,
these footprints change. The
watershed have vast
impacts downstream for
people.
Um The next slide,
please. Um
Climate change is affecting
all of our rivers in the state.
This is the Rio Grande which
dried through
Albuquerque in
2022 something I
had never seen in my
time in New Mexico
since the late 19
nineties. And I know some
people like to say that the Rio
Grande dried in the past,
it's dried in the past because of
water management
issues. When
this dried and when we
see drying in future years,
it's drying because there is not
enough water upstream.
So I just want to be very clear
about why drying happens in
the state.
Um
So based on
decades of reporting.
Um It's clear
to me that our climate impacts
are accelerating, more and more
people are being impacted.
Um And it's also
clear to me that New Mexico's
political leadership really
has to reckon with the
state's record breaking
pace of oil extraction,
which is emitting vast
and dangerous quantities of
greenhouse gasses
warming the planet and making
the lives of New Mexicans
more and more challenging
every day.
Scientists keep telling us
that we need to stop
emitting greenhouse gasses.
Um Given enough
political will
and work
by many people across the
state. Um
And then follow up
enforcement industries
could curb some of those
emissions. But at the very
least in my
opinion, the state of New Mexico needs
to take a better accounting
of the economic threats
from these emissions produced
here in the state. It is
inaccurate to talk about
revenues from extraction
without taking a proper
accounting of the losses. People
are suffering and will
continue to suffer far
into the future. I just
want to mention briefly
because I just looked it
up that
in the past three
years, oil companies,
the top five oil companies
in the United States
have had record
profits of
$250
billion between
2021 and 2023.
That's a 160%
increase in profits.
Um Over just the first
three years of the Trump
administration. So
oil companies are
doing great. They're making
plenty of profits. We
need to consider what
the costs of
climate change are because just
here in New Mexico
extraction and its
emissions are resulting
in the losses of billions of
dollars. These emissions
are driving an environmental crisis
costing farmers and
ranchers untold
crop losses and a way of
life. They're affecting
tribal economies and ways of
life. They're even affecting how people
can pray and
worship. These
emissions are making heatwaves
longer and more dangerous. They
are lengthening fire season,
putting the state's water supplies
at work and making people
unhealthier and
unhappier. Mr
chair, um members
of the committee. Thank you so much
for your time today.
Thank you. >> Thank you
very much. Um
MS Puscas um
RC Forster Laura
mccarthy.
>> Good morning. Uh Thank
you, Representative chair,
Mr Chairman and Representatives.
I'm gonna try to go really fast.
I believe you have my slides
and so I will
um just point
out the most
important parts.
Um I don't know about you all,
but my climate anxiety
at this exact moment is
really high and
um
uh I work for state
government because uh
for me, it's very personal
about finding solutions.
And so I'm gonna
focus my hopefully
just five minutes of
remarks so that we
can get to your questions on
the things that uh
myself
working in the
energy, minerals and Natural
Resources Department, Forestry
Division, together
with the
office of Superintendent
of Insurance
and the
Construction Industries
Division at the Regulation
and Licensing Department
and the state fire
marshal. Uh We have our
four agencies been
working together on a suite
of possible solutions.
Uh Not, they won't address
everything that has
been thrown out on the table,
but they, these solutions
could address some
components that are within
our ability to take action.
Now, um
My second slide is
a bunch of statistics
about wildfire. This
panel is on
economics and what
I want you to notice in it
is that there is a lot of
variability in
the acres burned and
the amount of money that we
need to spend on fire
suppression to keep people
safe. And on
the amount of money that we
put into proactive
watershed mitigation
on the slide after
that. So slide, three
new Mexico Wildfire
Fund, uh some of
you were at an
LFC meeting in
Las Vegas last year
where the Pew Charitable
Trust presented their
report called wildfires
burning through state budgets.
We have been meeting with
PEW with LFC
staff, with D FA
staff, staff and em
nerd staff ever since
that meeting. And we've come
up with an analysis
of uh the
strengths and weaknesses of
our current system
and a proposal
to improve the current
system. Again, I won't read
what's on the slide
if you go to the next
slide. Um This
is national data.
It's a pie chart
and uh the
first item here in
terms of wildfire
cost is diminished
real estate value.
And the fifth item is
insurance payouts. And
you're probably like
us hearing from constituents
who are dealing
with the fact
of um
wildfire and post
fire flooding really
affecting how insurance
works in our,
not just in New
Mexico, but what you'll
see on the next slide then
is how it
affects the whole country.
And New Mexico
is uh really
as lit up as any state
other than maybe
California. Uh
that's icon
up in the left. It
says IBHS
Research Center, that's
the Insurance
Institute for Business
and Home Safety. And
they came and did a
presentation uh
on June 26th,
Senator Woods, Senator
Stefani. You were both
there. Uh Really
impressive research group
and their angle
is what is it gonna take
for homes to be able to
survive a wildfire?
The yard may not look very
good. The views gonna be really
different, but you might
not. If your house
is wildfire red or
ready, you might not lose
all of your assets.
Uh, as well as the
personal trauma that
people have to go through when they
lose their homes, whether
it's in a wildfire
or a post
fire flood. I, I think we're all
feeling for our
um citizens
of Riodosa and Riodosa
downs the
way the insurance industry
thinks about it is
when wildfire
transitions from the
forest to the built
environment and if you go to the
next slide,
hopefully this will
play. There is a video
there. It's only about
15 seconds.
Um You might need to
click on that little
arrow
and if not, I'll just
describe it. So,
um what you see on your
page, the,
the
yellow circle
blobs are representations
of embers, embers
coming out of the
forest.
Yeah, I better go back. Uh
It's OK. We can go
without it, embers coming out
of the forest. Uh And
then uh
finding a
foothold
in a tree, you
can see it there right before
the words, embers, flames,
radiant heat, the
tree catches on fire,
then the house catches on
fire. Now you've got
embers and flames
and once the house
really gets going, you've
got bigger embers
that will travel further
than the ones from
the forest fire. And
then you build up critical
mass with say three houses
burning and you've got radiant
heat. This is what
happened in the marshall fire.
This is what happened in
Riodosa on its uh
big spread
day. Uh And of
course the fire in,
in Hawaii.
So on the next slide,
you can see what the
insurance business
and Home safety Research
Center uh is
telling us will make
a house more
survivable. These are
things that we can do
right now.
Um If
I mean, they, they're definitely
there's a pathway to get.
There is, is my
point. And if you go to
the next slide,
um I wanted you to see
that we do have an
existing statute.
It's the Fire Planning task
force that was been in
existence for two
decades. Now
that has uh the
responsibility of
identifying where
we have the greatest
wildfire risk to
the built environment.
Uh What kinds of
standards we should have
for building codes and
ordinances to reduce
the threat, uh How
we can work with communities
to get these adopted.
And then finally, a report
to the legislature which
we do turn in every
year. It's called the
Communities at Risk
report. And in it
is a list of
the highest risk communities
in New
Mexico.
Next slide is the
existing federal
mitigation programs
that we as a state are
using and the most impressive
of these is number
one, this is the
community wildfire defense
grants. It's a program
that was created in the
bipartisan infrastructure
law. And you can see
that this year we brought
in $28
million to New
Mexico counties.
And um
uh about a
quarter of it is for
planning and the other
three quarters of it is
for on the ground mitigation
projects. And in
the next slide is
our existing
state mitigation
and related programs.
So on this slide, I put
the programs of all
four agencies that are
working together so
that you will have a sense
of what we already
have in place in our
state. Um
As well to the next
slide
is
since January
of this calendar
year, our four agencies
have been working together
and looking at what
other states are doing
because it's not a,
a problem
that is unique to New
Mexico and we
have kind of
called the best
of what we see other
states doing. Utah
has an amazing
public education
campaign that
has reduced the number
of human caused
wildfires.
They were at a over
1000 a year. They're now at
more like 300 a
year. If we can do
that to New Mexico wildfire
starts, that will
be impressive as
well. Uh Colorado
and California have
home and property
assessment programs
which help the homeowners
know what they need to do
to reduce their risk.
And Alabama
and Calif California
have grant programs
to help moderate and low
income. Uh,
homeowners do take
those actions which can
be expensive, especially
if it involves a roof
replacement. And
then finally, Oregon
just on Thursday
of last week,
released a really
impressive
um public
interfacing map
of their wildfire
hazard overlaid
with the wildland urban
interface areas
and those
high hazard areas
are where the Wildland
Urban Interface building
codes will apply
in the state of Oregon. That's
something that we think could work
very well. In New Mexico
final slide, the la
the last page here
is a set of
options for
a comprehensive
approach and it may look
to you like a laundry
list. It's really not.
Um these actions
could all work
together to really
make some significant
change and
um some of them are not
very hard to do
so. Item one
is a wildfire risk
map. Em nerd will
do a uh the
quick and dirty version with no
budget um for
November for our
communities at risk
report and we could do a
lot fancier version
with a um
you know, searchable by your
address kind of map
that would take a little bit of time
and money. Uh Item
two is the public
education campaign that
I mentioned. Item
three is the
construction industries
division working on building
codes uh that
are consistent with what
the insurance industry
is telling us need
to be the standards so
that homes will
survive
and that would work
together with the map. So
the map would show where the
building codes would
be
required.
Item four is a
certification
program that would
take one time money
in order to be able
to help local government
staff up to
do assessments
and to do any
kind of enforcement. Were
they to choose to
go with codes
that were stronger than state
codes and
to include retrofit
grants for low
income homeowners.
Item five is to
update the fire
planning task force
statute, which currently
does not include
the office of Superintendent
of Insurance as
well as,
um, public
members with expertise in
insurance, home
building and real estate. We
would like to add them.
And then finally, uh,
the superintendent of insurance
is looking at changes to
the fair plan, which is the
insurance of last
resort and raising
the minimum for that with
that Mr Chair back to
you.
>> Thank you
um Porsha
mccarthy.
Um
So
I, I appreciate
the, the presentation.
I appreciate running through it
quickly. Um Going
to the committee, Senator
Stefani,
>> thank you Mr Chair.
Um And I want to thank
all the presenters.
Uh I think
that the presentations are
really focusing on
the alerts
to our state and
to us as legislators on
how we can protect
the citizens, the
people who live, all
the people who live in our state
and many of the people who
live in our state are in small
communities. And
so I'm very concerned
about how we are
working
actively to
include everyone
in um all of these
presentations. And
so
what I'd like to ask
and probably this will go to
um M mccarthy as
the state representative on
this panel, but it really
goes to all the state
agencies and then it goes
to the hospitals
that and then to the public,
etcetera.
How is everybody working
together because
right, now we have M
Nerd Energy Minerals,
natural Resources. We have
Homeland Security, we have
the Department of Health, we have
the Department of the Environment
and the office of the Superintendent
of Insurance who have
all have
a tiny piece of this,
but everybody seems
to be focused on their
special interest
and how do we take care
of everyone and all
the needs.
>> Mr Chair and
Senator
um
in the governor's
first year
of her first term,
she set up a climate
change task force
that has all of the
agencies that you mentioned
and some that you didn't,
uh, who have been working
together to
coordinate to
address the very issue
that you raised.
And I think,
um with
the, the
specificity
that, that you're,
you're seeing comes
because one
of our challenges
is to work
right up to where
our jurisdiction
ends
and coordinate
with the agency that picks
it up on the other side.
And as someone who's
been trying
to do that to the best of
our ability for five years,
I can tell you it is difficult
to do. Uh,
and um, it
requires that
kind of statewide
coordination that the task
force provides to
us.
>> Well, thank you for that response.
Um What agencies,
state agencies did? I miss
that you were indicating
we're in that executive
order. >> I
believe every state
agency is on the
task force. And,
um, what jumped out at me was
Department of Transportation.
Uh, and um,
as well as the National
Guard. Uh Both of those
agencies are just doing so
much in Riodosa right
now that they're on my
mind. Ok. >> Thank
you. And
um I do think
that
like I said, so
many entities
who are coming to talk to
us are in
their territory
and I think we got to take
care of all of it
and maybe that's too high
an expectation, but I hope
we can get there. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator Representative
Romero. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair. Thank you so
much for the presentation.
Um One of
the, you know, sort of
head spinning
topics is how to prioritize
all of these different competing
needs. Um And one
way, I'm hoping that I
love the fact that you're listing
out the various
um entities
that you're already working with.
But in the focus of some of the
exacerbated cost
that you had mentioned on diminished
real estate value, exposure to
wildfire, wildfire,
smoke, income loss from
wildfires and watershed
costs and the immense
sort of amount that
those are, I just wonder
in the proposal that you had had
about critical actions that we
could take.
Um Are
you working with beyond
some of these volunteer
fire etcetera? We have the
Mortgage Finance Authority that's
currently paying for
weatherization.
Are these connected to the work
that you're doing today?
And secondly,
if we were to
subsidize some of these critical
actions, are we
working with insurance companies
and, and our
um
you know, internally
in the state to know that these
prices will go down. Should
we mitigate these issues? We don't
do prevention. Well, but if
we did, would we know that these
costs would go
down?
>> Uh Mr Chair and
representative
insurance industry is
very involved and
in conversation with us,
the New Mexico
Mortgage Authority. Not
yet. That's a great idea.
I hadn't thought of that. So. Thank
you very, very much. Um
And uh
yes, uh as
far as cost going down,
I don't think that
that is a realistic
goal. A
more realistic goal
is access to
insurance and that's
because of a
number of factors, but some
of it has to do with things like
supply chain issues
in terms of cost.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I think for
us looking at
policies, we have to think
through all
of the added cost and
how it will be continued to,
to pencil out
and do trend analysis
on what that's
going to continue to look like. Should
we not do prevention and the cost
benefit on that? Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative uh
Representative Lujan
>> Mr Chair on that pretty much to
the point. I thank you
representative for bringing
up those those um those
points to address
LFC last year was
a uh we had
um superintendent
in of insurance and
other uh agents
in front of us talking about
the fair plan.
Um and one of the things that I brought
up, uh, was the
cost
and how we mitigate
that when we have,
we don't have a, a competitive
insurance,
um,
uh, group,
uh, groups plural
in our state because we have
three top
insurance providers in our
state that,
um, serve
our, our 50% of our
service.
And so there's a
problem there, there's an issue
there. I would like to
maybe, um,
task you with. Looking back,
I think it was two years in tax and
revenue committee during the interim
where we had a gentleman from California
that was talking about a tax
incentives or
uh policies
that would help mitigate what's
going on with our disaster for
disaster relief.
We know that the fair relief
is, is limited.
It is last, is last
resort. There are some issues with
that, that I've, that I
have and I'd like
to see when just
maybe two years ago it was
just negotiated the fair
plan where it was increased.
I don't see the insurance pool
insurance groups are gonna come to the
table again, to be quite
honest with you. Um
I there's a lot of problems with
this and we have a lot of work to
do and I'm glad
that we have a climate
task force. I don't think that
we've been,
uh, I can't
remember or see a, a
brief from
them uh, from
the task force from the governor's office.
I'd like to see something
I do command
our.in all the efforts
that they've done through the last
uh years. I mediating
the, the, the fires
um and helping the
local, the local
people that have been.
Um
I'm sorry, I, I'm a little emotional,
emotional about it because I just got to
do a fly over the
area and Pecos in,
in Las Vegas
two weeks ago and saw the
changes there as well.
Very much concerned about
our, our water and how
we're, what we're gonna do there. We do have
some solutions. I
would, I went to a water
uh conference in Santa Fe
and as, as
disastrous as things appear
to be, I mean, they are,
but there are great
things, there are great technologies
going on. I ask you to start,
we need to start looking at what Nevada
is doing and the
crisis that they have with their
water issues and what they've been able to
control and come and
change. I
was impressed with them. We have other
other technology and resources
and um I'm sure we're gonna
hear about them because our chair really
cares. We all care about this
issue, but he's been really
formidable on, on this issue.
But I, I just want to say
it's, it's
very um
the anxiety I'm feeling
right now. I've
been feeling it since I was in high
school. Um
We, I got to end now, but I would like to
say, go to those,
those are the issues I have
and, and Representative Romero
really kind of brought into
that. The cost of this is going
to hurt,
we can get a hold of it. There
are other solutions, there are other things
out there. I would and I'd
like to see a report from this climate
task force. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, RBS Lujan,
RBS
Scott.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman MS
mccarthy.
Uh What role
if any would
you envision
for the private
sector
of mitigating some of these
risks specifically
the timber
industry?
>> Mr Chair and
representative,
a very big role is
the short answer.
We cannot do the
mitigation work
without
contractors that
include a
range of kinds
of operators from
people who do logging
to people who
do uh
more of the
thinning out of the undergrowth.
And
uh
the
our forestry
division is uh
concerned that
it's difficult
work that
doesn't pay particularly
well and
that has high capital
costs if
uh operators
are going to use mechanized
equipment. And
one of our challenges
is to get
them a
consistent
stream of work
and that's where
having base funding
of now $3.4
million a year and not
being so reliant on
capital outlay
uh for state sponsored
projects is one
of the things that
you all have done
that helps that
situation.
>> So Mr Chairman Miss
mccarthy, the profit
motive by
itself is
insufficient
to draw private
sector
into some
of these efforts,
>> Mr Chair
and
Representative,
yes, I do. Believe that
is the case
it,
that we've already,
if you compare
our statewide price agreement
that we
finished up in the
last fiscal year
to the statewide
price agreement. Before that,
we are now paying more
on a per acre basis.
And that helps.
But uh it is
really hard
work that
today's youth are
less interested in.
Uh We are very encouraged
that New Mexico Highlands
University has
a four year forestry
program now
and that there
is a wildfire
resiliency training
center set up at the
Luna Community College.
And one of
their objectives is
to work hand in hand
with the Forest Industry
Association
to provide, for
example, um the
kind of training
in a simulator that
might make a contractor
a little more comfortable
putting uh
a young person into
their $500,000
machine.
>> Thank you, Miss mccarthy. That's
all I have. Thank you, Mr
>> Chair.
Thank you, Representative Scott,
Senator
Stewart.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Um
So I was able to attend the
Council State Governments Quest
Conference last
week,
week before
um I went to
a welfare management
uh session
they had and
they really are
organized. It's really
unbelievable. I'm very happy
to see the
wildland urban interface
map that you're looking
at. Um
Laura. And
um I was
taken by
their slides
that they showed about
the results of their work
and their watersheds.
They had a huge map
from far away
showing a burn
scar where
half of it was
black, it
was just black. It was
like what we're seeing now,
there is a line of
demarcation that
was then green. It
was the same forest.
The part that was green
had been
uh
worked over
as we all need
to do with our watersheds
that had been thinned
and the
fuel
underneath had been
burnt. Um And they
showed pictures of them
doing it. So I
don't think we're putting enough
funding into.
We now have to have watershed
mitigation and restoration.
I want us to start
before it. I want us
to upgrade what
we're doing. I want us to put
more money towards it.
I just think there are plenty
of people that would be willing
to do that work.
Um So
I'm hoping that
um your
department uh Laura
with the governor
will uh will
put more money into
watershed
restoration.
So, and we certainly
are going to do it. Um
Before you answer, I just
want to tell the other,
Laura
how brave and courageous you
are to tell us the truth.
Not very many people are
willing to do that to
us. You know, you see us,
we're, you know, soup to nuts
up here and we're gonna
attack you for saying
things like that. But
reminding us
of the reports
from the national
groups on climate
change and what we're facing
is just very
significant. I just wish
you'd had a handout so we can
all go home with your words.
But I remember
them. So thank you
for doing that.
And ms
mccarthy
>> very briefly,
the forestry division
is really committed to
scaling up our work on
the proactive side. Um
We have examples like the
one that you saw in New
Mexico as well.
And um often I
put those into slides
for people to see that it really
does work this
afternoon on your air
quality panel. You have Doctor
Matt HTO who
is really an expert
in uh
the effects, the on
the ground effects of different
treatment types. And so
I hope you'll, I, I've seen
his slides already. I know you'll
get a good dose of
what's coming this afternoon.
>> All right. Thank you. Thank you both.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Senator Senator
Woods.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Thank you for inviting me
to that meeting
that we had with the
insurance companies and,
and this
particular deal,
you know, a lot of people don't
understand that an
insurance company
insures
risk.
It is a pretty simple
concept
that they're entering
something that we don't want to
take more. Most mortgage
companies want
someone to stand between
them
and a natural
disaster or
something. That's, that's
uncommon
and that's, that's what they do.
That's what an insurance company
does. This
plan
here
allows an insurance company
to lower the rates
or to insure
because the
actual homeowner
is doing something
to protect their
property.
Now, that's, that's an odd
thing, isn't it? I mean,
we all want to protect our
property, but sometimes
we don't and
that brings us to the subject of
public land
and the management of public
lands. And
when you are
dictated out
of a
committee way off
somewhere as
to how to handle
yourself. You know,
and you are
constantly under a
particular lawsuit
about what you can
do and what you can't do
because we made
a law somewhere
sometime and
it says
stay out,
stay out.
The best management
is to stay out
and is that to the public?
Good? Does,
does, when
does no management
constitute
management?
You spend a lot of time
with state land
and private
landowners
and, and teaching
them how to
mitigate some
of this, some of
this fires. And,
and also
uh you know, I, I
noticed when you took us out
in Las Vegas to
those private lands
and you, they
was actually
putting up small
barriers, small dams
around to medicate
flooding, you know, get
up high enough,
you stop that flow up
high, you don't stop the
flow in
Riodosa.
Those those are way
too, too much
volume at that point.
So you have to go up high to
do that. And,
and that's your problem.
If that up high is
a national for,
they don't allow us in
there. They
don't allow mechanized
equipment in there
to even
help with that
problem.
And Mr Chair,
I know I'm beating this
dog to death.
But
how can we do
this? How can we
protect our
state
without some help from
some management, not
just pouring money
into our state thinking
that money will fix
all of her problems.
It's, it's the
allowing us the N A
process, all
of these other
permits that we have to
get to,
to do a problem.
Uh, you know,
many people looking on
the outside think agriculture
is a pretty easy
thing
working in the timber
field, as you
say, it's a
capital, intense
place
that, that we think.
Well, a one time
deal,
nobody's gonna invest that
kind of money in a one time
deal.
You can't, I don't know if any
of you have ever tried to rent one of
those half million dollar
machines.
Do you realize the insurance
policy you have to carry
to even rent one of
them?
It's, it's a high
dollar insurance policy
and you got tack that on
to whatever other
cost you have
and possibly
a revenue stream back.
So
we're
making
rules against
private industry
all the
time,
but also cutting
the revenue
sources.
And then we wonder why we
can't get people
involved. You
talk about our young
people not wanting
to come into those
hard-working
jobs.
I saw a gentleman outside
this morning with a
shovel, scooping
mud.
It wouldn't blow
him.
Why? Why
Mr Chair?
Is it below
the rest of society
to use their
hands?
This, this
particular college right
here trains
a lot of our
workforce.
It's in an ideal location
because this is a high population
area. They have a
lot of chances to
come in
here
and Luna College
and and other
community college, Clovis
community college and
all of these other community
college has a chance to
train people to do
things
and, but
things like
this,
we should require
this C
ID should require
this
C ID should
require
a a before a
rooftop solar
comes on to the house,
they should require
that the roof be
inspected
so that, that homeowner
knows whether it
can support that
solar and whether
that roof is, is,
is sound enough
Mr Chair
to take a, a
hailstorm or two
before it has to be
replaced and pull
all that stuff off
and be replaced. There's some
places that we could
actually do
some regulation
that I believe
could save the homeowner
homeowner something
and, and,
and this
is not simple stuff, but
if it's required to start
with,
it's a different story
doing this after the
fact is
expensive.
I would recommend you
guys find
this. Here's, here's
one of those neat little deals that you
can take a picture
of
and you can see this.
It's impressive
what this does, it
can save
neighborhoods,
it could save urban
neighborhoods
if you take care of this right
here.
So Mr Chair, I'm
beating this horse to
death. I apologize.
I,
I
sometimes Mr
Chair
and I don't know how to be
politically correct and be
really nice,
sir.
But
sometimes we don't
hear all
sides of every
story
and
I don't want to be critical of you,
sir, but
sometimes
I'd like to see a little more
of both sides
and I know that you're trying your
best.
11 thing that I'd
like to see is if we
are taking up too much time
asking questions,
maybe we could schedule a
little more time
between
topics so
that we could ask more questions.
But
your prerogative, sir.
Thank you very much.
>> So, Senator Woods, I, I
apologize about the, the
timing on questions.
Uh I'm a little
rusty. Uh, we'll
get better at that because I would
like there to be plenty of time to
ask questions and have discussion.
Um I
will say,
um there
are some things that there aren't two sides
of.
So, uh
I do like to have different
points of view represented on
panels uh hearing
the current science uh
and status
of climate
change,
you know, I, I'm,
I'm not sure what the other point of view
is. Uh I,
I recognize
Representative Scott's a
repeated point
that even if it's
happening, it's hard for us
here in New Mexico to impact
that I get
that.
But that doesn't mean it's not
happening. And I
personally think it doesn't
mean we
shouldn't try.
And I will
say Senator Woods, I
appreciate you. I appreciate,
uh, what you bring to the table.
If you do want to be more
politically correct, I'd suggest
you stop beating horses
and dogs to
death.
Yeah.
Ok.
Just a
thought.
Um, Senator
Senator Woods,
a, any, any closing
thoughts before we break for
lunch?
>> Mr Chair.
My closing thoughts
are
that we
have many things brought to for
today
that needs money to
fix,
but not one person
brought
forward
another way to
do that, another tax
to put on our citizens
because it's taxpayers'
money we're talking about.
They haven't brought up one
other funding
source
to do the
job
that the current revenue comes
to the state that
does.
You, you, you constantly
want to do more
electricity.
I would like very much
for one
Panelist to come in here and,
and economically
give me a
diagram
of the amount of infrastructure
it's going to take to get
to a total
electric
transportation.
What the cost is going to
be to the fleet
trucks.
Uh The, the sec,
the environmental
department said they was going to
put 50
million to
convert
our fleet
owners to
uh an electrical
system.
Sir. I would ask
how many trucks are in the
state of New
Mexico
on the roads
today?
Has anybody got any
idea?
Does anybody got any idea
what it would take to
convert those trucks
to electric trucks
today? They
tell me it's gonna take a third,
more electric
trucks
than it is diesel
trucks.
They tell me it's going to
take
fueling stations 200
miles apart
for those
trucks,
huge amount of
infrastructure who
pays for it. The
gentleman right back here
decides what
taxpayer, what
ratepayer pays for
electrical
infrastructure.
We've got to bring that out,
sir.
That's a kind
of
balance that I would
like to see.
So if we're gonna have to
change our whole world,
let's talk
about the economics
of that.
There's a study by UN
M that says our
population will
decrease in the state
of New Mexico by
20 to 25%
in 2050.
Now, why did you say that,
sir?
I'll, I'll try to find that study
and bring to
the group,
every other state around us is
growing and
they're expecting us
to decrease in
population.
Why is that?
And I'm sorry, to get on my
soapbox, sir.
But
I want prosperity
for our state.
That's what I want.
Why wouldn't we
want
to come out of
apart?
I don't understand it.
Why do we want to put more of
our citizens into
poverty instead
of come out of poverty?
I know. I'm sorry,
sir. I will quit
right there. Thank you,
sir.
>> So to sum up, first of all,
thank you. Thank you to the
panel. Um I
think a lot of the
the cost we're talking
about or
transitional costs
and I don't think we're
talking about
selling all our
existing fleets.
I think we, we should be looking at
as, as
things go out of the service,
we replace
them with
electric, we
transition out of our
current system.
Uh I'll also say,
you know, I've told
this story before. I, I can remember as a
kid, there was a,
it was like a transmission
uh oil
change, you know, commercial,
it used to be on TV.
And the guy would
say
you can pay me now or you can
pay me later and
that the message was you can change
your oil on a regular
basis and take
care of the car or you
can skip that and have a big
cost at the end.
And like the
idea of that we're gonna
hire
people for really
hard work going
out and thinning
watersheds.
That's a preventative
cost. I mean,
we should, I mean
that if we
can find people to fill those jobs
and I recognize that would be
difficult and
pay them, you know, good
wages, health insurance, stuff
like that. Uh, and
that's probably not a job, you
know, they want to do for a career,
maybe. I don't know.
But I mean, that, that's an
investment that saves
us money on the back end
from the
cost of not only the cost
of fighting the fires
but the damage, the
fires cause, you know, the loss
we suffer from those. So
I think that's something we have
pretty broad agreement
on. So once
again, um to the Two Las,
thank you very much for your presentation
and uh I think we lost
our online presenter, but
thank you to her as well.
Uh We are going to break for
lunch. Uh We
apparently have sandwiches
for the committee uh behind
me. Um I'm not
sure that we have the
full
breadth of
offerings for different
dietary needs
and I apologize about
that. Um,
but we are gonna break, we're gonna
come back at one
o'clock and
we're gonna, we're gonna get back on
track. So, thank you,
everyone. Um We
are, we're
not adjourned. We're
breaking. Thank you.
