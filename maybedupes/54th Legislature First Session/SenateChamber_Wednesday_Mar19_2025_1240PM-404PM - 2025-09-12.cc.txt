uh, we're here to do the state's
business, the good pastor had a,
had a good visit. I thought he

In the state, rightly so, Mr.

going to come to an agreement
today and everything's going to
work out, uh, to our best for
the state of New Mexico. Mr.
uh, I, I, I had, I was,
yesterday, I was a little
discouraged about an event that
happened in the re

You know, we
We try our best to, to be good
just, uh, ask for your blessings
and we asked for blessings for
everyone.
Because, because we need the
unity.
And I see uh
for all the efforts you put in
on the economic development in
our state and, and we hope that,
that you are successful in your
developers in our state so that
we can have our citizens
prosper. We don't want
A state of poor people. And
how to, how to make a, a
situation where our, our
population can all prosper and
all boats rise. You know, we, we
grandkids. We want everybody to
move up through that, and that's
why we try so hard with their
school system. We've had several
bills here today about, uh,
things we're trying and, and
we're just hoping and praying
that we find the right
combination for that because
How can we have people prosper
you know. And uh there's so many
things we need done and, and
that's, we're going to talk
today.
About this state budget.
budget and
And we
We spent the year, uh, talking
to each one of the agencies
trying to figure out how to make
is the fact that, you know, we
want to keep increasing our
budget. This budget here
increases at about 6%
Haven't had uh uh increase in
employees. We're still about the
same number of employees, and so
that causes, that causes us to
we get just a little more out of
it so that we can have a more
prosperous society. And with
that, we, we know that one of
our main cost drivers.
together. We're trying to figure
out how to get a bigger group
policy together and, and with
that, we're trying to negotiate
a better deal with the
year that had to do with some
healthcare stuff and, and
everybody that stood up, Mr.
President, everybody that stood
up, they might have had an end
not being able to see as many
patients, you know, they're,
they're just more and more
doctors gone. There's less and
less doctors in the state. And
that drives him.
you get an early cure to those
problems. So we, I had one of
those doctors tell me that, that
today, that one doctor can watch
You know, a, a PA is, thank
goodness they're out there
because that sometimes the only
people we can go see.
But the trouble with that,
so we actually, you know, if
they may send you for an X-ray,
but they may take 3 or 4
different shots just to make
sure they get it covered right.
And that drives medical cost.
During announcements, and I'm
not going to, but I just want to
bring forth the fact that we
just, we have to do something
school. And we graduate
approximately 100 doctors out of
that medical school every year.
And we need to figure out a way,
out how can we keep those
doctors here so they can
practice and help New Mexicans,
Mr. Chair, help New Mexicans do
what needs to be done in our
here, and we need to survey
those reasons to figure out why
we're having problems. We're
trying to put money in a budget.
I'm not used to talking like
this, and I hope, apologize, but
I, I might just talk, uh, uh, a
I'd like to talk a minute about
our natural resources in our
state.
Mr President, we've got one of
the, one of the states in the

of the smallest populations.

Prosperous towns in the state,
which was grants.

net zero.
We talk about trying to
And so, um, I just want you to
keep in mind, we've got other
rare earth metals in our state.
That we need to start thinking
about
Mining also we need to think
Mr. President, to, to have more
prosperity in our state.
So I, I just, these are some of
the things that, that I'd like
know that uh we are trying our
best to, to come across the way
to do that. We have, uh,
We have

we've ever seen anything like
that, you know, with regard to
this department in the 6 to 8
years that we've been working to
stand this department up. The
funding expands things like home
services, Mr. President, because
of these extra dollars is just
going to continue in the right
direction, which I know, and you
know very well that, that this
really helps the state with a
13% return per year for the rest

qualify for childcare
assistance.

childhood access and make sure

incredibly improved graduation

a half a billion dollars to
continue standing up these very,
very important services, and
this will ensure that we set the
kiddos up on the right path
that they have for the rest of
their lives again, better
reading scores of 3rd grade,
better math and science at 8th
grade.
Increased graduation rates, all
this is going to culminate in
nature. So this foundation
really does, Mr. President,
really does help us to lift up
New Mexico. I'm so proud to have
been a part of this effort and
I'm so proud of these
investments that we made in the
budget this year. Thank you, Mr.
also rise in strong support of
the budget and want to also
thank the finance committee is
very hard work, working all in
great job of that. I, I want to
mention in particular uh what
they have been able to do for
education, um.
guarantee when those changes
were presented, um, the house
only put in a little bit of
that. When the budget came to
the Senate, it was fully funded.
uh, this funding will help the
CTE programs which we all have
been talking about for years.
They are transforming her
that they get through these
apprenticeship programs or the
CTE programs count for
graduation, so we're finally
paying attention to the career
risk.
When we did the family income
index for a number of years, we
got to a better way to identify
our very high poverty schools,
who truly are at risk to have
that funding go directly to
them.

linguistically appropriate

and what we're teaching with.
Uh, this budget has 135 million

personnel.

educators. I hope we are going
to be doing that next year.
Their funding steam and STEM and
math education, other programs,
math lab that's showing true
promise. We're putting money in
for what we call our grow your
own teachers program, our
educator fellowships, $20
training to be the teachers that
we need.
Finally, Mr. President, there's
4 million for special education
initiatives, $5 million to
rate these funds will help these
programs that we need in our
public schools, so I am excited
about this budget. I'm grateful
for the Senate paying attention
Senator Lopez and Senator
Trujillo, Senator, uh, Gonzalez.
Thank you, Mr. President, and I
do rise, uh, very pleased with
much we were listened to over
here and particularly the
increases that go into the SCG
to support the CTE programs, the
secondary increases in the, the
start moving up substantially in
the ranks, but I think we're on
the right track with all of that
and very much appreciate that.
Um, I do have a particular
question if I could ask the
athletic budgets for New Mexico
State University and University
of New Mexico and the general
Mr. President, I, I think those
differences have built over
time. We didn't create those,
those of, uh, whenever you and
Mr. President, Senator, except
those differences have uh
increased over the last year
compared to prior years. Why?
Uh, Mr. President, we, we've
sent over non-reoccurring money
of 6 million and 9 million out
of balance for both
universities.
Sinner souls
Mr. President, I don't think
similar levels is there, uh,
what is that about a 50%, uh,
difference in costs in uh the
state amount of, uh, money going
to those.

they got to 7 and NMSU and I
don't know where er was at UNM

because I don't know where they
came from. I don't know how they
started. I don't know who gave

that question correctly.

don't know what all athletics in
MSU has. I know what the major
athletics they have, but I don't
know if they have a rugby team.
I don't know if they have a
soccer. I think they have a
have in athletics, and I don't
know those uh there is a
difference in athletics, um, I
think last year we gave money to
Women's athletics for a soccer

difference and not influx the,
the situation with the money and
then create other issues, uh,
And I know that there have been
some personal issues with some
of the members of the finance
committee with an NMSU athletics
and some budgets were cut. I
think that is wrong. That is not

commitment to improving our

the DD waiver.
It also addresses health care

Mr. President, it also uh
targets investments in
behavioral health with
approximately $60 million in
non-recurring appropriations,
affordable housing and

Mr. President, there's also 9.9
million uh uh about a 4.9%
increase to our Department of

ensures continued funding for
critical services while adapting
to federal funding changes and
inflation.
that will, um, address the root
causes of health disparities in
our state, so Mr. President, I
do encourage our um fellow

More and more numbers and what
can I see except numbers, you
know, but
We, uh, there's one part of the

Let me read you some of the

surplant in Gallup 2 million for
a nursing home in Rio Reba

Central and New Mexico senior

Rancho Public Schools. We've got
a little bit of hodgepodge for
everybody in here, Mr.
President, and those are just a
few of the things I encourage
the members to look into the
pillow, Mr. President, and this.
Soak it up that way. I don't
know. Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Senator Woods.
Senator Campos, thank you very
numbers that are coming out
because those programs are
investments in you, their
investments in New Mexico their
investments in our future.
investment in New Mexico and
that's exactly what you have
here in House Bill 2 at all.
As we go forward as an example,
and I started earlier, whenever,
other things and that's why I
ask our families, pay attention
because to our young people now
that you're in school, science
and math and reading, all these
As we deal with it, whether it
be one of the smaller rural or
frontier communities while we're
dealing with the urban suburban
areas, that means that there's
There's going to be 73 million
to DFA for the New Mexico Match
fund, which enables state
agencies to attract federal and
other funds.
Of $37 billion coming into New
Mexico.
So when you start to think about
it, think of how we can continue
to go ahead and parlay and to
leverage federal resources that
will be available.
So as we go forward into the
year 2030 as our chairman has
already indicated what we're
we have to do it together, and
these are the keys whenever it
comes to economic development
for the state of New Mexico.
Just a few other things.
There are more and more
businesses that are building
there.
And what does it mean whenever
we tie those dollars in. It
imports but also in our exports.
Also 40 million to EDD to
establish a research development
and deployment fund.
But research at our research
institutions is important.
At her comprehensive
universities, that's also
important.
what, get into these areas.
You'll find that once you're
reading, once you're doing some
of these, uh, calculations,
you're gonna find that there's
189.5 million for
transportation, which includes
funding for road infrastructure
maintenance and improvements.
leverage those resources so that
we have the opportunity here in
New Mexico to provide safe roads
for people that are visiting and
for those people that are
Senator, yes. Senator Scott, you
have the floor.
Mr. President, I just got this
282 page.
Piece of legislation it is
item in the time that we have
available. So, Mr. President, I
tend to look at the elephants in
the room.
And
Well, it was a pun in there
Medicaid expenditures.
Higher education and public
school support.
Those
Uh
And Senator with the Medicaid
expenditures which when we add
in federal funding looks like
about 17 billion.
that's all of health and human
services combined, that's DOH
Healthcare Authority, uh, all
services combined $17 billion.
budget items. Can you give me,
do you have a 5-year history
there of those expenditures so
that we might be able to
Uh, rapidly increasing, Mr.
President and Senator, so we
don't have the five-year
history, but when we increase uh
provider rate increases to keep
our doctors here, it increases
the cost of Medicaid. When we
Nursing homes, all that is
related to medicated cost
increases as you're getting a
little snow on the roof and I'm
getting a little snow on the
roof and we're gonna need that
and that's the cost of Medicaid,
uh, the better quality one, the
more we have to rely on
Medicaid, but if you'll take
note on in our budget, I mean,
if you look at that 17 billion.
Medicaid. Other states are in
the exact same boat we are. Uh,
they want to make sure people go
to hospitals, they're treated,
that they're not going in debt,
they're not filing for
bankruptcy when they come out
there and this is the way we
and I certainly do believe that
we all want quality, uh, medical
care.
I will say though that $17
enrolled in these programs as I
understand it, is that, is that
still a good number? About half
of the population, New Mexico's
down from almost almost half to
about 40% of New Mexicans are
now on Medicaid. OK, Mr.
President, if you'll allow me to
use half for
For easy math.
Per individual, every man,
woman and child in the state.
And if we say that the balance
$35,000 per person in the state,
including all the state support
services plus private pay.
This is seems to me like a very,
very large number and do we have
any comparisons with what our
neighbor states Colorado,
outsized for the number of
people that we have in the
state.
Do you have any comparisons
available for us?
Mr. President and Senator, uh,
let's do some math first and
the population, and then, then
you got to take the 333 billion
that 8, 8,724 and 60 cents and
go in there and add 1633,
315,000 20 cents. And those are
the real cost to the state of
New Mexico. The federal money is
a match. Then we match that to
the cost is gonna be the cost.
I, I, we can't control health
care costs inside a budget
framework.
We only can appropriate the
money that's correctly to make
businessman, I take that match
all day long, uh, knowing that
we could provide good quality
services to the citizens of New
Mexico.
the feds over these, uh, with
the state expenditures is a very
good return. Nonetheless, all of
into the pockets of the folks
providing medical care.
In the state. Is that correct?
Mr. President, Senator, let me
clarify something and you called
that is CYFD. Some of that is
for your rural hospitals and
mine, uh, and some of that is
blended throughout other state
agencies, uh, environment
state on the 11 billion. It's
not just Medicaid. I don't we're
trying to dig up a true Medicaid
number for an actual true cost,
but when we, when we did that.
We just couldn't match it down
the lump sum.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator, I'm,
I'm gonna get away from this,
but I will submit, sir, that
of the
expenditures.
That we are currently the
currently undertaken with
Uh, again, for example, a 5 year
trajectory on the expenditures
for higher ed in the state.
jump to 01 and then 01, it jumps
about every four years in the
budgeting process. I'll just
give you some numbers on higher
ed. They are in the purple, they
About 200 million, uh, from 20
to 24.
Thank
Oh, and Mr. President,
understanding that at one point
in the last several years, we
were down, actually down
somewhere around 6 or 7%. Do we
know, the student population
went down and up and it's back
on, on the incline, uh, coming
back, if we look what happened
in COVID and, and that was the
Uh, NMSU Global, uh, I took the
shot at him for 10.5 million.
The first year in that program,
they generate 10.5 million.
hu is because we hadn't
developed those online learning
systems in this budget right
here, there's about 1312 million
happening around us, but we had
better.
We gave him opportunity
scholarships, which is in total
about in total about 160 million
this year. That's helped
entertain students to go to ASU
online high school and online
high school, uh, they guaranteed
you into ASU in a dual credit
them to graduate, uh, and so
higher ed is run up, uh, in
student population is starting
to rebound. The costs are not
coming down, uh, you know what
thank you, Senator, for that
answer, Mr. President,
nonetheless,
We
Maybe have failed to move our
should be able to reduce costs
while providing quality
education. If we could, let me
school support has been over the
last few years, and, and let me
ask, as a consequence of those
look at the educational system
that way, because we had the
Yazi Martinez lawsuit.
Who shoot us and say they're
still in court saying you didn't
do this, you didn't provide it
at this level. And so we
increase in education over the
last 5 or 6 years.
Every kid is different, every
little Johnny's gonna learn
different. Every little genes
gonna learn different. And so
And so as we move forward,
The greatest loss in the
educational system is 6 through
9th grade. There's a study out
they were not connected with the
teachers and the people in the
classroom. The 6th and 9th
graders.
Or are going through puberty.
it is, whether it's Coach Lanier
sitting in the corner over
there, uh, whoever it is, uh,
they want to fill that
connection and, and when they
feel that connection, they'll
stay in school.
We would be in the middle of the
pack in the US, not at the top,
but in the middle and not at the
bottom, but in the middle.
And, and so, you know, every
through 9th graders and keep
them in, Senator Soul's had
about CTE, uh, that's an asset
that we can use. They may learn
played football, whether you
played basketball. That
connection has to happen with
these kids and it just costs
more money.
Our, our,
our outcomes coming out
force people to go to school. We
can't not force teachers to to
teach the way they need to, but
we can put the money there and
hope for the best outcome, and I
think that's where we're headed
6 through 9th graders throughout
the country all go through some
sort of puberty. So I'm not
going to, uh, I'm not going to
successes. The, uh, CTE program
in the, in the community in
Southeast in Hobbs has been uh a
rest of the state and get some
more bang.
the Burke because right now we
are spending a lot of money and
agree with me that we need to do
a more efficient job of spending
those dollars. Is that correct?
Senator Munoz
Mr. President, Senator, that all
don't put that money there if
they put it in their cash
balances if they don't do the
programming, they don't do the
to control where the money comes
from the state, how they want
it.

say 10 minus 6, it's only $4.6

In, in just a couple of years,
just a few years, 74% increase
and so I ask Mr. President,
Is our education system 74%
better?
Uh, or higher ed outcomes, 74%
better than they were.
Uh, it, it in fact is anything
in state government, 74% better.
Well, we have some money.
Money has not really our
problem.
So we've put money into the same
programs that haven't worked.
And, and I believe that the
efforts have been.
Sincere
No
But here we are looking at.
And while I, I absolutely am
thrilled.
By what the chair of finance
Senate Finance has done
specifically.
About putting money away.
And what the putting that money
away simply does is allow that
that investment to grow, so
we're less reliant on oil and
gas, and I think that's good. I
love oil and gas in case you
I submit to you that everybody
in the state of New Mexico,
whether they want to be or not.

they do.

do.

a little bit.
In fact, not only can we do
better things with the things
we're do better do better with
the things we're already doing.
And every time one of those
things comes up before us.
We have a a group, whatever the
industries in. In fact, we've
introduced bills and even passed
some bills.
It seemed to me to be the, the
sole.
purpose is to tell local
And what that tells big
industries is, well, if they
don't even like their own
people, why do we want to go
there?
Consequently, we don't have any
new industries.
We have every kind of landscape
you want. If you want to go
hiking or biking, skiing or
fishing?
This is the place to do that.
And yet
We can't attract industries.
And I think it's because we have
a mindset.
And I've seen that.
Over the course of several
years, but this year
particularly has just really,
really bothered me.
Not, not that it's wise for us
to do away with oil and gas, but
we need something more.
And yet we just can't get our

We saw it just a few years ago
in 2015, 2016.
We saw what happened in Texas in
the 80s.
Recurring spending increases by
$600 million despite stagnant
enrollment in most programs.
Jeez, Jay, how did you approve
75%.
Budget increase.
When we're barely getting by.
Well, Mom, it's government.
about risk. We're going down a
bad path in this state.
With this recurring spending in
this incredible growth in state
government spending.
With the leadership of our
chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
Working across the hall with the
house.
Can get budgets in line.
Mr. President, with that I
yield. Thank you.
We do have further debate. We
have Senator Pinto next.
Thank you, Mr. President.
And with the chair of finance
You have the 11th Judicial
District Attorney Division 2.
And then the last column you
have it at a 94%.
The district attorney has no
employees.
We have over 600 cases sitting
there that aren't getting heard.
Mexico where crime is, uh, we've
tried meeting with her, uh, on a
homicide case.
That she almost rejected because
the timeline was running out.
If we do not fix our crime
problem across the state. If the
cops don't arrest, if the DA's
don't exist, which they don't
exist in Gallup.
So Mr. President, and
consultation with a lot of
community members in, in Gallup
and around the areas, people
that aren't getting their
homicide cases prosecuted.
member killed, and there's no
one in court to prosecute that
person for what they did to your
family, things have to change.
Uh, Mr. President, we moved the
attorneys. There's no other
solution available. We've looked
at removing her through the
court process. There is no way
to do that.
Now public defenders are leaving
the opposite side of the, the
case is leaving the public
defenders came to us and said,
we need more money for contract
prosecute cases get dismissed.
But people deserve justice.
And she was elected to help with
that justice, and there is no
justice when you have 600 cases
To say there's no prosecutors at
this moment, who's who's doing
the cases and you'd mentioned
contract prosecutors.
and then everything else that's
there.
Uh, because we're talking about
a whole budget cycle.
Not just a moment, we're talking
about a whole budget cycle, uh,
the attorneys that go into the
courtroom. 11th DA.
Fortner, who agreed to this and
said he would help us because
he's one of the people that
magistrate court and the Supreme
Court told her to dismiss the
case and she would not dismiss
the case against the magistrate
court.
So what will happen is the 11th
prosecuted until we figure out
that the new this existing DA
can manage employees, not fire
them in court, not embarrass
them, and people can have
prosecution in the in the court
District attorney that was
there, how long is their term?
Mr. President, the district
uh, when LLC and we have all the
district how many district
attorneys is there?
13
14 district attorneys. She
hadn't shown up.
that her budget is correct.
Senator Pinto.
So, Mr. President and Senator
Munoz.
You mentioned that she had no
Mr. Pregnant, she's, she this is
her second term. This is her
8-year term.
She didn't have an opponent, um,
and the people chose her.
You're gonna
Take out all this money. I mean,
you're still saying that there's
someone's gonna come and
money to this other area.
That is supposed to kind of be
the allocator for this other.
and not here in in McKinley
County.
Thank you, Senator Pinto.
Senator Munoz, Mr. President,
those DAs the district attorneys
will be placed in go. They're
So Mr. President and uh Senator
Munoz, the money that's
allocated for this, is it?
Staying at the same amount, um,
So they're gonna come and hire
all of that in McKinley County.
They're gonna send someone over
and that amount of money that
don't know what page it is, but
we'll find it. But it's actually
an increase, uh, 3% increase and
then uh uh 3%, uh, uh,
additional money to help them
I think there are some people
doing some work cause it, I
think there's.
to say that nothing's getting
done, then I would assume that
that's where all the criminals
In a sense, you know, not really
pushing the emergency button
yet.
But those that are doing the
work, I hope they are still
gonna be able to be there and
you're still gonna be in the
backlog and still be in where
you're going to be this timeline
of of cases running out of time
to be prosecuted.
end up being a haven and that
this allocation is the right way
to go and because being in the
rural area and having people
But when something springs up,
stands in the way jeopardizes
your job, especially when we
talk about what's going on right
now in the state of the nation.
It is.
In the way I understand it being
a drastic move.
You're saying a change needs to
be made.
But if we don't have the
qualified people.
That is like trying to remove me
if I'm doing voting on a bill
that maybe one person doesn't
like.
So the evaluation process of it,
But
I'm just hoping that's not the
case with this budget cut, um,
because it's taking it all the
way down. I don't know, is it
for a new DA. How do we fix
this, um, Mr. President,
Senator.
Mr. President, Senator, I will
tell you that I hired one of the
about the DA and how they can
get their pro their case
prosecuted. I actually live in
Gallup.
Uh, I live in Galop. My office
is in Gallup, uh, uh, it's on
problems and if we don't have
prosecution, we're never going
to solve the crime problems.
People are not gonna get
terminated.
If they want their jobs, they
want people working there.
I'll tell you a case of where DA
assistants were hearing cases,
uh, assistants in the office in
organizing stuff for cases.
The next time someone is shot,
there was a shooting in Gallup
since we've been here. I don't
know the, the.
Particulars of the case, but if
It will get better, uh, no
matter what we try, no matter
how we tried to figure this this
problem out for our community,
it's your community, it's my
community. Someone dies on the
It will get better. We'll
override that with your help.
We'll watch and see, make sure
the 11A is hiring and funding
correctly, and we'll make sure
that those cases are prosecuted
within the confines of the 11th
A judicial district.
So Mr. President, and I don't
need the senator to yield. I
power and weapons, using our
legislation as weapons.
I hope that's not what we're
doing with this particular
budget cut.
constituents in New Mexico.
And not really having the input.
Um, I understand about economic
development.
think from some of my
colleagues, they don't feel they
were heard in some of the bills
that they had passed.
And
of those bills too were by
people who really didn't
understand behavioral health,
but um.
There were proponents all these
years and advocates and senators
push this emergency button
because
But we're at a standstill, it's
pivotal. We think it's escalated
so much, but be mindful too
because of what happened in the
it should have been a safe place
here, but when another entity
goes in and tries to push.
Power, or weaponize some things,
um.
Be mindful
That we're going to think, um,
right now that we're gonna be
able to come back from it and
back step from it.
But now I have people.
themselves because of what they
think is going to happen.
That's all I have, Mr.
President.
Thank you, Senator Pinto.
please.
And Luminos.
Mr. President, Senator, yes.
Mr. President, thank you very
of the budget, I'm looking at
this and.
It's actually bars. Tell me why
this particular section is in
Sen Munoz. Mr. President,
everything in front of the,
those bars is the budget and so
the bar authority always comes
at the back of the budget. So
they, they can make those budget
adjustments.
fire happens for a different
department might need some more
money, you can pull it out from
other agencies. Is that what I'm
understanding? Mr. President,
Senator, they can't bar out of
agency between, uh, spending
category. So if you had, and
this happens a lot, if you have,
we have FTEs fully funded in one
agency, and they can't hire
and those are why bars are
there. They used bars in other
ways, some in good, some in bad,
some out of great need.
Uh, and so bars have been a
question of mine for a couple of
years, who we give it to, who we
bars that immediately need to
happen in the beginning, uh,
when the July July 1 budget
cycle starts early childhood
education will need to borrow
Mr. President and Chairman
Munoz, I guess I'm kind of
confused on that you said it has
to be within that particular
department, so I'm looking here,
Uh, they could borrow up to
$50,000 from other state funds
for in make work camp programs
may increase uh request budget
Uh, from game and fish, Homeland
Security and emergency
Management department office of
the state engineer, and, and so
that had me, has me kind of
Game and fish might be in here.
I'm not following quite as well
on Homeland Security and
emergency management department.
On everything from page, let me
see where we're at here.
Said Mr. President.
Chairman Minos, I was kind of
incensed whenever I saw that
figure on what I pulled up off
told you about that total 155
million is 1.1% of our budget.
But Mr.
continue to do year after year
after year.
And we are taking advantage.
Of the
Does fund this budget along with
agriculture.
And it seems like the intent of
They do set a budget they do
stay within their budget.
And they still help pay the
bills up here.
So Mr. President and Chairman
budget since I was 14 years old.
So that means, uh.
A long, long, long, long, long,
long time, OK? Whether it's
Uh, keeping the books for the
John Deere dealerships, whether
it was the ranching operation,
whatever the case may be.
But I've still had to make a
I'm glad you told me what bars
was. It kind of explains where
we're going with this in case
there is a shortfall somewhere,
but they do have to.
Take that money out of somebody
Whenever I have a bloated cow.
This is gonna get pretty
graphic, Mr. President.
here into her belly to let some
of that hot air escape.
Maybe that's what we need to do
with our budget because our
check and quit spending like
we're a bunch of thieves on our
way down to South America
somewhere.
We're not going to have any
money left because you know
Uh, finance committee did on
this. I really do.
But I can't
support the spending.
highways.
We have problems in our state
whenever we have a forest burned
down and we can't even help
those people who have been
adversely affected.
We can tell that by what we're
spending right here 74% increase
in the budget. My God, what are
we doing here, folks?
Thank you, Senator, Senator
Zelle, I'm impressed not one
cookie that whole.
Debate
Nice job centers though. Senator
Steinborn.
And House Bill 2, they had $50
million in there.
to clean up abandoned uranium
mine sites and other
President, Senator, I, I do not,
but I know that it takes years
and years to clean them up.
They're going to transfer
abandoned site. Uh, they're
trying to transfer one to a
Yes, Mr. President, Senator,
you're right, it's very
expensive work and it takes
years and years, and that's why
I was really disappointed to see
The desire was to cut even
further and folks had to fight
just to get it at 20.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator,
We have billions of dollars,
region, how long have those
sites been there?
Those contaminated lands in
those communities. Senator,
those sites have been there
since they mined uranium, but
federal government is managing,
I think, uh, for, it's not 4
corners, uh, home steaks, uh,
that is managing that. They're
going to pick up some other
funds. Uh, the Navajo Nation
wants to invest in a milling
process that brings a machine
onto the site that takes 99% of
uh, you know, in this position,
I got to make tough decisions.
I gotta make real tough
decisions.
Do I want to fund foster kids
and foster parents at a higher
level.
So I think you heard this, um,
Adrian, who works for us.
And I went to the food banks,
Roadrunner food banks.
I shook his hand and said, let's
do it.
Those are tough decisions I have
to make.
Not every pot of money can sit
there forever.
In this fund that he's talking
How do I fix CYFD?
How do I not let another child
die.
Tough decisions have to be made
in the budget.
They're tough. They're not easy.
Did I fix the things that New
Mexico wanted to fix in this
budget.
That's where my thoughts go to
at night. Thank you, Mr.
President.
Thank you, Mr. President.
We can find lots of niceties and
we can find lots of essentials
when we go through that, um,
respectfully, um, as I go
to ask you about one aspect to
that, to that reduction.
Mr. President, Senator, why is
it that you required in that $50
million number that it had to be
the other appropriations where
we give them multiple years to
spend down money knowing how
long this work takes.
Mr. President, Senator, you have
to ask your colleagues in the
House why they budgeted it that
in one year and was not
successful, so I mean it was a
decision made in the Senate, um,
Because the buck stops with us
this is his, this was a historic
undertaking that the state made,
uh, when the house.
chair and myself and bipartisan
legislators from the House and
the Senate came together and
I just think we have generations
of tribal lands that need
justice that need clean up, that
need to also, I mean, you talk
about health, children, futures,
this is about all those things.
We have 1000 sites with no
owner. Yes, there are sites that
have that have a responsible
with no action, and it will be
like that until we take action.
The cleanup that you talked
about has to do with certain
specific sites and what we're
them.
And I hope that, uh, the
legislature continues to give
funding in this area, but more
so than that, Mr. President,
And that furthermore, Mr.
President, that you as the chair
of Senate Finance and vice chair
of LFC this coming year, that
you, that we support the
Environment Department.
party that might be out there,
not just for the uranium mine
sites, but for the 1000 other
contaminated sites that are all
across New Mexico. The
Environment department needs our
support. They need funding to do
this work.
do have further debate with
Senator Cedillo Lopez.
Thank you, Mr. President. Will
the sponsor yield?
What else do you?
Mr. President, Senator, yes.
Yeah, not the judicial district,
but the DA's office in the 11th
Judicial District and um I
wondered about it and then when
Jurisdiction to prosecute be
conferred on a DA.
From another judicial district.
jurisdiction will be 11A, which
is Gallup and 11 is Farmington,
and so they will be hired at 11.
district attorney district one
and judicial district 2, and
there are two different district
attorneys and what my
understanding of jurisdiction
is, is the only has a district
district attorney is not
authorizing people to to work in
That person's judicial district,
how they can, how somebody else
can confer jurisdiction.
money. If the 11th A decides
that they want to hire somebody,
I imagine that the, the 11, 11A
wants to hire somebody that the
11th to say, OK, we'll hire them
for you. Here's their payroll
debate, there's 600 cases and
nobody, only one person working
in the district attorney's
office. I, I mentioned that.
I hired somebody in my office,
my wife did. I didn't, I've been
gone during this time that left
standards look at it. We've had
everybody, the Supreme Court
looked at it, the Court calls me
and they're worried about it.
The division judges are worried
Mr. President, I understand that
you have concerns about this
district attorney. I, I get that
I am confused about how giving
money to another district
attorney's office is going to
solve a problem in another
is who is is elected to serve
and so if she doesn't authorize
a district attorney.
To prosecute cases in her
district attorney.
They're gonna say you have no
jurisdiction. I, I, I'm very
concerned about this fix to the
problem. There is a process for
evaluating the performance of
processes, um, and maybe
they're, as you said, as you
said, maybe they haven't been
sufficient, um, but there is a
petition, there is a process and
followed, the process for
discipline or the process for
removal, and I don't see, I
mean, if she, if the district
attorney wants to hire somebody.
I mean, I guess what she's gonna
have to do is authorize them,
but I do not think this is a, a
good solution to this problem. I
do think it's a lawsuit waiting
to happen, um.
all I'm going to say, Mr.
President.
Thank you, Senator C Lopez.
Next, we have Senator Townsend.
baselines, what are they in this
budget?
Um, Mr. President, I think our
natural gas and natural gas,
give me, let me get that answer,
but I think crude oil was based
gasses at 68 uh CFM. What is it
on natural gas, sir, Mr.
President, 68.
For oil.
We'd be rich, we'd have billions
and, and Senator el would still
be seeing we overspent the
budget.
uh interest income, do you have
a baseline on that or uh a
total, uh, interest income
number that you're working with.
Interest come on, give me a, on
baseline is 5%.
And our bond rating is what
today, Mr. President
Senator, I'm gonna have to look
know, uh, we're a AA rated, uh,
in New Mexico.
in the bond companies has told
us we're going to go to AA plus.
And
Mr. President, I understand
that, but going from a AA to a
AA plus has value.
Mr. President, Senator, uh,
million, uh, a few years back
when the interest rates weren't
so high by the Federal Reserve
was at 1.5, and I believe
current market rate on bonds
about investments are going to
Um
Stabilize the ups and downs in
oil and gas and, and I, I think
we have
earned interest income.
Mr. President, in in that fund
that we're investing for the
future, give us one second. Uh,
16 of volume 3. This has been
our budgeting process. What does
that look like? Kind of looks
like a, a roller coaster, but
steeps and lows. He looks in the
negatives where we were dead
And
income.
Henderson Townsend.
Mr. President, no, I, uh.
I think that's really good and I
that. It's uh it is a way to
take the ebbs and flows off of a
single source income and
doubling up on that is uh is
very uh.
Just got your chart.
Thank you, Mr. President. You
know, we've heard a lot of
things today and we've heard a
lot of things from the good
senator from that haven't been
here and said, oh, we're just
amendment for a billion dollars
worth of rebates.
The next year, we did another
billion dollars worth of
rebates.
The next year, we did another
billion dollars worth of rebates
We've expanded our, our pre-K
and universal health, universal
pre-K. We have the lowest
property taxes in the country.
We're gonna end food hunger in
in capital outlay funds across
the state of New Mexico for
every infrastructure project
that you could imagine from a
court to a water pipe from a
tax by 754 million.
So when we say we're just taxing
and spending on this side of the
aisle. It ain't true.
We give back to our people.
it in the bank and you multiply
that times 5, that's 150 million
and multiply that over 4 or 5
years, just call it a $500
million return, but that was a
people's money in rebates.
talking that night. Maybe they
bought beer, maybe they bought
tires, maybe they bought a TV,
maybe they bought their kids'
clothes. That's their business,
not mine.
I can only manage what I can
that before.
If a recession hits us in New
Mexico, we know we have to
balance the books, our
constitution says that. It says
And then, uh, charge us more
taxes. This is New Mexico.
I know the good singer from Rio
Rancho is listening and so, you
know what my mom would say, but
That we reduced their GRT when
they're buying other products
because food isn't taxed in New
Mexico.
We've done the right things for
education, you invest in quality
of life. Those are the things
that people want to move to
cities and counties for.
Go listen to the LFC hearing on
President. We're a land of
opportunity.
New Mexico in this budget has
the greatest opportunity to divi
diversify its economy than it's
ever had.
We've reduced taxes.
We've taken care of our elderly.
We've given military their
retirement tax-free.
National Guardsmen healthcare in
New Mexico.
That's a cost in this budget.
But when you want those National
Guardmen because you have a
There's good things that are
happening that, Mr. President.
So I close.
Just remember
There's opportunity in New
Mexico.
There's opportunity for seniors
to get food when they need it.
There's opportunity for capital
outlay.
We don't know how the vote's
gonna go down, but opportunity
is the best thing that my dad
ever gave me and maybe a kick in
the pants once in a while.
