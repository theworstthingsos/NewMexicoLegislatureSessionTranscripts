What do you believe that the

$4 billion out of an expensive
23 billion in the state, that
will dramatically lower premiums
as the coronary artery disease
gets put away.
This will cause a higher burden
of cost to be on the insurance

believe is probably true.
Mr. President and Senator, very
well stated.
Senator Townsend, you have the

Senator explained the bill.
Um, the extreme risk family
Protection Order Act.
And we did that so that when
there are people in crisis who
Those close to them, can go to
law enforcement and ask law
enforcement to file a petition,
uh, to have a for those firearms
of this process 5 years ago, and
they still are today, as they
have been implementing this act,
they've identified a few areas
that require changes, uh, for
this to, to be more effective
The first is that law
enforcement could be a reporting
party, um, so that when they are
seeing things on the ground,
they have the ability to, to
party when, uh, in some
situations that, that might put
those family members at risk.
The other change that this bill
would make would be to the time
We then say they have 48 hours
to relinquish the weapons. We
say there's an immediate risk
that is so extreme that it it
a very dangerous, uh, window, so
this bill would also say that as
soon as the order is issued, uh,
the firearms could be taken at
that point.
We do have debates, Senator
Townsend.
Thank you, Mr. President.
It seems like, um, Senator, as I
look through
The history of this bill.
That it has been um
There has been quite an outcry
from the public.
Um, at least on my email, um.
A a taking of their.
Second Amendment rights.
What are your comments to those,
Senator Mr. President, I suspect
we have a very different
constituency. Uh, the emails
that I'm getting are mainly
saying, please support this so
that we can better protect New
decision as a body 5 years ago
to put this into effect, um, and
to say that when someone is in
crisis, uh, to protect them, and
to be a 2nd Amendment debate,
Mr. President, that happened 5
years ago. The changes being
made by this bill, don't change
that fundamental policy, they
floor. Thank you, Mr. President.
Senator, um, many believe that
this does little to protect.
Either those, um,
Mr. President, no, I have not.
Um, and I can ask unanimous
consent to bring in some experts
who I bet can tell me about
multiple.

Representative Garrett join me

I object.
Mr. President. Senator Worth. So
this issue did come up and
Senator Scherer and I met with
the lieutenant Governor agreed
that when they are presenting a
bill, even on a call, uh, it's,
it's appropriate for them to be
important when they're the
original sponsor of the bill
that they'd be allowed to be
here.
Thank you Mr. President, a
little communication is very
helpful, folks.
Thank you.
else though, but the house
sponsor.
And the expert witness.
Thank you, Senator Scher.
Senator Townsend, if you can
restate your question. Yes, Mr.
individually and those that live
in the home or in close
surroundings to them.
So, Mister President.
Um, I think overall this.
This keep this helps protect
people because when they are in
that I'm hearing from my experts
is that there was, there was a
person who, who lived right on a
golf course and there was a
walking path that went past her
her, so she started stockpiling
firearms.
To deal with the threats that
she was perceiving. I think that
that was a clearly a dangerous
who made that determination that
that was the appropriate, um,
Action, course of action, and in
your bill, how does that change?
these orders and really the only
thing that this bill changes is
who the initial reporting party
can be at as law enforcement to
situations day in and day out.
Uh, can not only be the ones who
file the petition, but, but can
be the reporting party for them
as well, but otherwise it
doesn't change anything about
keep on to say, gentle lady, um,
Senator I apologize. I know. Old
habits die slow.
Um
Let me restate that.
Mr. President, under this bill.
Within what timeline is the
So, Mr. President, so a punk uh
verification of the credible
information, uh, that would
allow them to to go forward with
the petition in the first place,
they would go forward with that
the finding of an imminent risk
of harm to self or others.
There's this 48 hour gap before
the weapons can be taken. This
would say that they can be
taken.
That decision seems like to me
that if a person is under
crisis, and then you decide.
Where you challenge them that
you're gonna remove weapons that
Mr. President, that is the
problem we have now with this 48
hour gap is that yes, this order
is then being issued, uh, and
And Mr. President, Senator, what
data source do they use to
decide that there is a credible,
Mr. President, it's based on the
totality of the investigation,
uh, and the judgment of our law
enforcement officers and
assessing the credible inform
house. Do they have to have
credible? Can they search for
weapons? I mean, what if they
don't know? What if it's an
older person, um, there's no
for a search. I would assume and
my experts can uh give me looks
if I'm saying something wrong
here, uh, that part of the,
their investigation, uh, is if
firearms, uh, that that would be
information they gain as part of
their, their investigation that
would be some of the critical
incredible information that they
would then go to the judge with,
this, and, and makes an
independent assessment of that
information, uh, and issues that
order if appropriate.
And Townsend.

And typically the duration of
times in 2024, and if you give
me just a second, I can answer
the second part.
And it was used in across 19
counties.
72 of those 90 in 2024 were for
a year.
And Mr. President, uh, Senator,
what is the disposition of those
weapons after a year.
Mr. President and Senator.
How do they ascertain that a
year later that, uh, person is
enforcement does follow-up
investigations. And so if at
the, at the end of that year,
uh, they felt that there was
still, uh, that significant risk

People, um, complained to me and
I'm, I'm sure.
Several of us in the room have
had this.
That they believed that.
weapons while they're in the
possession of the police force,
our, um, not well cared for and,
for safekeeping?
And I'm sorry, Mr. President,
could you repeat the end of
your, your question? Yeah.
Mr. President, is there any
So, Mr. President, the
respondent can actually choose
to have uh an FFL hold the
weapons, um, but, uh, otherwise
sorry, Mr. President, if there's
anyone I trust to uh safeguard
and maintain weapons, it's law
enforcement.
Senator Townsend.
Mr. President, gentle lady.
2024. Is there, can you tell me
where it was used? I mean, is it
seems like it's used in one area
more than the other, I mean,
President, so it's been used
across 19 counties, Bernalillo
is the biggest one, I think
probably because they have the
biggest population, that's been

Senator Townsend.
I appreciate, um, Mr. President,
Upset if this is used.
fairly and equitably.
Everybody wants that person that
and, um, senator that I continue
to have concerns about it being
misused.
Uh, on one occasion, I was um.
Had been damaged and there was a
big controversy over that.
Some of the weapons that were
seized in one at one point in
time were not.

So I think um there's many
issues still in this, um,
generally, I don't think anybody
has a problem with it, but I

And whenever the bill was

our state.
And Mr. Mr. President and
Senator Doig whenever.
asking is just what is arising
again where law enforcement do
have to take these firearms into
their position.
To immediately confiscate these
weapons, Mr. President, Senator
Doig, is that correct? Is that
what your bill states.
And Mr. President, thank you for
clarifying that. I would needed
to make sure of that, but the
problem here is, Mr. President,
you said there were 90

Oh
Requirements for taking in a

therein lies a problem because
whenever you do take them to a a
firearms distributor, they do
have to provide insurance on
guns in the meantime and have to
hold them sometimes in excess of
a year, so, madam, Mr.
President, and, uh, Senator
So Mr. President, what I'm
hearing from my expert witnesses
is that they've never
encountered a situation where
they
They did not have the ability to
Tons and tons of firearms

enforcement, uh, uh, facilities
under this. This is only in the
already reported in 2024. That
does give me concern because in
today's society we have seen
what has happened with.

constituent that had several
firearms stolen. They were
recovered and they were placed
in safekeeping until the trial
was heard.
And lo and behold, Mister
President, these firearms could
not be found.
And they still have not been
It's taken away.
Well, let me put it this way.
I think it lacks clarity in
that.
That dude, Mr. President, yes,
that's what this, this bill
would would provide for.
And Mr. Mr. President and
I think that there could be a
lot of problems with.
Our law enforcement.
Being put at risk here, Mister
the senator yield for just a
question or two.
Senator do a deal. Yes, Mr.
President. Senator Scott.
And if the order is granted.
The surrender must occur
immediately are those the two
substantive changes here.
uh, but then yes, you're right
about the second part, upon
issuance of an order from a
court, the firearms could be
taken immediately. OK. The
2022,
There were 16 of those.
Petitions filed and the question
I have is,
How many of those
trying to mitigate.
With this legislation.
Senator here Mr. President, I
had that it was 14 in 2022, but
there there were any injuries in
the 1st 48 hours. Is that
correct?
Senator do Mr. President, I
don't have that information here
A data here, how many of those?
We
now, but the way that the
language reads now is that it's
48 hours or sooner if the court,
uh, says as direct, uh.
posed by a gap of time between
issuing this order and, uh, and
actually taking the the
firearms.
Senator Scott, you have the
floor.
OK, let me ask the question
firearms in the first, well, 16
and 2022, 47 in 23 and 96 in
Were any of those did any of
those that we know result in
injuries between the time the
And so Mr. President, so again,
I don't have that data standing
here right now. Uh, what we do
know, I'm informed by my expert
witness is that in every single
we actually don't know.
We have no statistics to justify
the immediate seizure of these
firearms.
60 plus or minus cases that have
been that where that order has
been issued in the last 3 years.
Mr. President, I, I don't think
preventative measures, if they
worked or not, but we don't know
because if they did, nothing
would have happened.
And so this, this is, there's a
finding that they pose an
immediate risk to themselves or
others. It is common sense not
to say, but hold on to your
Represented in this chamber that
we absolutely don't know whether
there was any issue with that 48
Uh, extreme risk firearm
protection order may well be
unnecessary.
And I would like if there's any
Mr. President, so I, I can't go
out and gather data right now
while while debating on the
floor, but I am informed by one
Mr. President and Senator, that
has absolutely no bearing on the
conversation that we've just
been having with regard to the
Uh, we've demonstrated that
there is no
There is no need.
To move this 48 hour period to 0
difference between 48 hours and
immediate made any difference.
Thank you, Mr. President, and
thank you, Senator, for your
answers.
Thank you, Senator Scott.
Senator Brent.
would like to.
Uh, ask a little bit about the
process, um, with the judge.
Do you have any firearms in the
home? That's probably a pretty
common question when there's a
domestic violence, um, and then
what happens after that? Can you
just kind of walk me through
Senator Dug. So, Mr. President,
so in, in a domestic violence
would do their investigation, if
they had credible evidence, they
would then file a petition, take
it to the judge, and let the,
the judge make a determination
as to whether issuing an order
And, and Mr. President, you made
a peace sign and I totally
forgot what I was saying, um.
Or if someone is, is, is a
significant immediate danger to
themselves or others. That's,
that's what they'd be looking
How does this investigation
start? A police officer just
can't go out and start an
investigation on anyone and
everyone they want. There has to
any call for service from, from
law enforcement. So then the,
the example earlier of the woman
who lived on the the walking
path by the golf course. She was
out there waving a gun around
there is a, a, there's probable
cause of a of an immediate risk
to so for others.
Senator Brandt, uh, Mr.
President, Senator, so, so in
I do think.
circumstance, no one got killed
because law enforcement was able
to intervene and get those
firearms, but before they were
able to do that, they couldn't
rocks at them, uh, there is
clearly an escalating pattern of
behavior that thank goodness did
not continue to escalate.
and no one did get killed
because this law was in place.
We didn't need a new law. We
didn't need to change this law
because it worked.
They were able to take the
firearms away from this woman.
a new example that actually
works where something didn't
work and now we need it because
so far all you've given me is
stuff that actually worked
already under this law.
uh, where they were not able to,
to get a reporting party, uh, in
time to, to get an order, uh,
law enforcement had had contact
with them before, law
enforcement knew that they had
firearms, wanted to take them
away, wanted to report it. I
mean, what you just gave me is
that there was a murder suicide
at Cottonwood.
So, Mr. President, there was um
there was a situation in Rio
did not want to be a reporting
party because of how the statue
was currently written, law
enforcement felt like they
couldn't, uh, just go in and and
thought you said in a domestic
violence situation, they'd be
able to use the domestic
violence.
So I, I, I think you're grasping
at straws to try to make
something fit when nothing fits.
I, I apologize, Mr. President,
could you repeat that question?
Thank you, Mr. President. I was
just asking questions, um.
When you go to the judge, does
the judge have a hearing?
respondent might not be there,
and then there's a another
hearing 10 days later, uh, where
it is the full hearing on
whether to have the, the one
year order as opposed to a
temporary order and yes, the
that has given, has, has gone to
the judge asking the firearms to
be removed. There's a hearing
that's held and the
respondent isn't even told.
Senator Doha.
violence, uh, framework where,
where someone can go get an
initial temporary order ex
parte, which means it's just 11
party going, not both parties
parties present, uh.
In this situation, within 10
days.
Center Brent.
Thank you, Mr. President. So, so
Without ever hearing from the
person who owns that property.
With no due process at all.
Mr. President, right now, law
out of line with our with how
our system of justice works.
But in the case you just
mentioned where they arrest
someone, again, they have to
there's probable cause, so now
you're allowing law enforcement.
To go in
Take someone's property.
We'll go to a judge and take
someone's property with no
you know of where the person
waiting 48 hours, anything
happened.
So I don't understand why we're
doing this.
Without giving the person any
opportunity to defend
absolutely have to have probable
cause under this.
Mr. President, Senator, where
does it say that?
Mr. President, the term that is
Mexico is going to issue an
order, uh, restrain anything
without probable cause to do so.
That would, that would
fundamentally uh go against what
they, they do.
least have to say you do, um,
but you know the rest of society
doesn't feel that way.
I have way more faith in the
police officers, but I don't
have any faith in the judges.
Send out and signed orders with
no probable cause.
Happens all the time, so for you
to think it doesn't.
I'm just gonna say it maybe a
little naive, maybe not.
But it might be
In the system what we believe in
is pro is that our constitution
says.
That we have to have due process
that our constitution says that
there has to be probable cause,
the person that's having their
property taken.
Isn't able to defend themselves.
In fact, they're not even told
about it.
And then in the end,
I have a problem with all that.
They've never had an opportunity
to defend themselves.
And then what I think is really
weird.
Is there any guarantee to the
police officer to do the, the,
the whoever's storing the
firearm have to pay when the
firearms damaged.
Senator Du Mr. President, so if
there was damage done to a
firearm during the during the
law enforcement safekeeping of
that firearm, then yes, the
claims?
Mr. President, according to my
experts, no.
Thank you, Mr. President, um.
Sir, I, I would feel a lot more

quick hearing with the judge.

Um

had a mental health.
Yes you're going.
I, I'm, I'm.
You just told me another thing
So, Mr. President, one of the
examples that I'm hearing was
there was a student who was a
neo-Nazi. He did not have
Uh a list of students who he was
going to murder. That was just a
straight up crime, Mr.
President. I wasn't because of
behavioral health issues. It was
could have been charged with. I
think there's some, some other
issues that he could have been
taken in on.
Is there not?
Mr. President, they would have
been misdemeanor crimes that
would not have meant that he
able to be a neo-Nazi, doesn't
have some mental health issues,
but maybe we could even agree on
that one. We probably could.
But uh I think I've asked enough
Thank you Mr. President. uh,
most of my questions were asked
by Senator Brandt.
However, will the sponsor yield
just, just for a couple of
questions?
issue is with uh.
A person has to be considered a
harm to himself or others.
So, Mr. President, it's, it is
the totality of the
circumstances based on the
investigation of law enforcement
and if they have credible
evidence to present to the

Mr. President, so our, our law

Why don't they remove the

Instead of removing their

person.
At the time they are there, even
before they would go to a judge
if they think the person is an
immediate harm to themselves or
others, they can't remove the
person.
for that, uh, senator. So Mr.
President, if they can remove
the person, then why do we need
this bill?
Mr. President, they have to be
evaluated within 72 hours, but
They can be held up to 72 hours.
Mr. President, this isn't being
arrested on a criminal charge.
This is when they are in a
evaluated there within 72 hours,
but
They can be really spending time
after that evaluation.
So thank you for that. So within
Mr. President, so that is the,
that is the deadline by which to
do that evaluation. It doesn't
mean that it always happens with
it after 72 hours, it means that
evaluated within an hour after
being taken to a mental
institution, so I would think
that minimum 24 hours to
evaluate this person and um.
I just wanted, I just, I, I'm, I
also am concerned about the due
process that the individual

Help me out with this process is

we'll call it a night after we
get done with what's up on the
table.
Thank you, senators we're going
The Senate IS unanimous consent
of the Senate, the record show
that all action for placing
House 143 is three times as
colleagues, this is a, uh,
transparency bill that would
require lobbyists to report on
their activity on legislation in
a new report, um, including, uh,
their employer, which is the
important information, have had
a role in a bill, and uh, 20
other states require this. This
will be really valuable to all
of us as elected officials to
constituents to have the same
appreciation as they evaluate
what it is we're doing up here.
So it's, it's really a tool for
good government and that it's
really a
transparency tool, Mr. President
And a sharer followed by Senator
Townsend.
So
We do have a floor amendments.
Well, let's go out, Mr.
for the sponsor while that's
being handed out. The first
question if he'll yield, Mr.
President. Steinborn, do you
yield
is um.
Mr. President, how many?
Probably none.
Center share Mr. President, in
here it appears that the, the
what bill they are supporting or
opposing.
Uh, when they, when they buy a
dinner for us.
So if it's never happened, then
why do we, why are we doing
This bill says that once with
within uh
Upon commencing a lobbying
activity and by law that's a
legal term in the lobbyists
Regulation Act, lobbying is
to engage that bill and the name
of their employer, and that's
all it does. It, it's
irrespective of whether they buy
anybody a glass of wine. This
bill has nothing to do with that
at all.
Mr President, Senator.
transparency, I think the part
that part of me that's really
troubling me here is that the
assumption is,
That
that calls on. I probably
received 5 600, maybe 1000
emails on that.
Sorry, Mr. President, I
apologize if you got 1000 people
telling you and 1000 other
people telling you, and the 1000
people that told you to vote for
or against whatever.
Anyway, but I do have an
amendment, if it's appropriate
at this point.
Thank you. We do have a floor

Let's say they can't even buy us

this amendment does, Mr.
President.
Thank you, Senator Sch we are
debating Senate floor amendment
number one.

session. This is just a
transparency bill, so we know
actually who is involved in
trying to shape pass, monitor
and knows my activity over the
last 10 years. I've tried to
introduce all kinds of bills
dealing with transparency of
spending, um, I would be more
than happy to look at
to weigh it down, I would argue
as a poison pill. So, Mr.
President, this is, uh, well,
it's a friendly subject is a
friendly, and unfriendly
amendment on this bill and not
appropriate for this bill, and I
would urge the body to reject

Then what it would appear to me
that what you really like.

To me is kind of a disingenuous
effort.
The effort should be to clean up
the process and stop it.
we're here, we shouldn't take
anything else, just cut it off
and start over and do it right.
Thank you, uh, Senator, I
believe
amendment, but I do want to make
a comment, you know, we truly
want transparency, true
transparency to the, to our
And opening up the blinds.
But with this amendment, it's
like opening up the whole shade
and looking out and that way
everyone can see what truly
people. We need to let them know
what's going on and more than
anything, this is uh committing
us to be fair with the
lobbyists, because if they have
amendments and a share to close.
Um, thank you, Mr. President. So
I just wanna, I just want to get
this right then.
Um, we're gonna reject this
not gonna let them do that, but,
but as far as, you know, go
ahead and, you know, letting
them give us a gift on, you
know, we got stuff on our desk
all the time, things like that.
Uh, so.
Can get steak or appointed
public officials.
But, uh
That's all OK. That's brilliant.

lobbyists from.
Providing campaign
contributions.
Uh, to all, to all political
candidates and uh essentially
all, that's all it is. It's just
basically preventing them from
making campaign contributions.
It does allow their employers to
give campaign contributions, but
not, not the, not the lobbyists
themselves.
gentleman, and in fact, all my
friends on the other side for
your passion for these issues,
and maybe we can be another
great bill we can talk about for
the future. But for this
so it would be a friendly.
Amendment, again, it would just
alter the bill in a way that
would, uh, that would, uh, I
think be designed to impair it
and at this hour, I would just
to center share.
Um, thank you, Mr. President. I
do have a, a question for the
sponsor of the bill if he were
you Senator Steinburn, do you
yield. I yield, Mr President.
Mr. President, this is not a
campaign finance bill, uh, in
fact, in fact, it probably is
log rolling because it's not
even related to the lobbyist
regulation Act, which is what
but I think certainly it alters
it in a way that uh is a
completely different
conversation and, you know, not
in the spirit of this
legislation.
So let's just not let him let's
just not let them. It's easier,
simpler for everybody. It's
easier for them, it's easier for
us, uh, they're just out of the
game. So now,
If they're just out of the game,
they're out of the game and then
everybody can move on. They can
still report who, uh, you know,
who they talk to or what, what
they talked about, but.
Yeah, yeah, they can still buy
us a steak, but they can't give
us any campaign donations under
this one.
So I don't see how it inhibits
the bill at all, Mr. President.
Just wanted to share that.
don't need anyone to yield. I'll
just note that this amendment is
probably unconstitutional under
the First Amendment, uh, to
prohibit, uh, a class of people
political purposes is speech and
by barring entire categories of
people from being able to
exercise.
that right of free speech based
number 2, Senator Bran. Mr.
President, would the, uh, what
Senator Dohe yield for a quick
question?
I didn't do a big deal,
So what was that case again?
Uh
Uh, Mr. President, Citizens
Mr. President, so it depends.
Uh, so clearly we have campaign
are times when, when it is
permitted, and there's a whole
legal analysis that that it
would go through that I cannot
recite right now at 9 o'clock.
a $1.
Because then we are.
Telling them they can only give
us $1 because I guess that would
be OK, but saying they can't,
even though it would also be
limiting speech.
enough attorneys on the side or
any.
Um, but thank you with the
sponsor of the amendment you
Thorn, do you yield.
Yes, Mr. President, I will yell.
Senator Bratton, you have the
Um, would that mean that their
employers couldn't give us money
or would it just be them?
Mr. President, it would only
Ca under this and I'll I'll have
to ask the sponsor of the bill
when we get, if we ever get back
on the actual bill. But when we
get back on the bill, I have to
ask the sponsor of the bill, but
Mr. President, if they're
classified as lobbyists with
this amendment they would not be
able to give any money.
Thank you, Mr. President and,
and Senator, um, I was just
wondering about that because
here, um, and that's seems to be
something we need to look at
restricting as well, so thank
you.
You can send Brant. We have
Senator Cervantes on the
amendment.
unlawful for a lobbyist to
contribute. First of all, if
they violate this, what is the
penalty for the unlawful conduct
that you're intending to, uh,
limit or restreak. What is the
penalty?
And Mr. President, I appreciate
that's what you may think. Do
you know what the consequences
for the unlawful conduct that
you amendment would prescribe.
the consequence of the unlawful
conduct would be in, and uh, if
the sponsors unaware too, I'd
welcome anyone who could tell
me, but it, it seems like we
should never pass a law that
would yield a couple more
questions, the Secretary of
State lists lobbyists to your
knowledge, is everyone listed as
a lobbyist by the Secretary of
State? Is it an individual
person?
Senator Thornton.
defined in New Mexico law as a
as a person as opposed to an
entity.
Mr. President, I believe that is
a true statement they are
defining as a person.
major oil company, Chevron or
something, they, the lobbyists
couldn't give me money, but
Chevron could give me whatever
the limits are of the, of the
law for campaign contributions,
is that right?
Senator Thornton.
employers of lobbyists can give
unlimited amounts of
contributions by your law other
than the limits that already
exist for those contributions,
is that right? Up to the limits
Mr. President, I do not.
Right. And so let's just say the
lobbyist for Tesla was John
Smith. John Smith wouldn't be
right? He could still, I, I, Mr.
President, Yi, did you, how much
the E Elon Musk give, uh,
President Trump, uh, in the last
election cycle.
Senator Thorne, Mr. President,
important because I, I, I am
concerned that we mislead the
public when we do things like
this. And, and it may seem like
there's no harm to this
Of a lobbyists contribution, but
we're not limiting who gives the
lobbyists.
The money
we say lobbyists, you all,
let's, let's be honest, we've
all get the, we all good a
campaign and we get a check from
the corporate company for our
So Senator, under that scenario
when I get a, uh, a campaign
contribution from a corporate
donor and it has the lobbyist
card attached to it. Would that
And so Mr. President, sir, I
appreciate that. That's a,
that's a good assumption, but so
you're telling me that as long
as the lobbyist's name is not on
the check itself, the lobbyist
You're OK with that.
Mr. President, yes, I am.
And, and thank you, Mr.
President. So I, I get back to
my point. We're, we're kidding
ourselves and I think we do a
contributions by lobbyists.
Yeah, they can send me a check
with their card, but as long as
their name's not on the check,
this is gonna be fine. I think
Cervantes. We do have further
debate on the amendment we'll
sendator Cilio Lopez and Senator
Townsend, Center Celia Lopez.
Thank you, Mr. President. Will
the sponsor of the amendment
yield
Mr. President, yes, I will
Mr. President, the purpose of
the amendment is to provide
transparency again if, if the
intent of the original bill was
to provide transparency. What
lobbyists as being uh having the
intent of influencing our
decisions.
And Mr. President, intent is not
the same thing his transparency
Are disclosed and that purchases
during the legislature are
disclosed. It is not a
log rolling and then to migrate
distress it also, uh, not
distress, but I hate the case
Citizens United, it's also
inconsistent with that case,
Unclear what the purpose is if
the purpose is transparency, it
doesn't meet it. And if it's the
purpose to make lobbyists
neutral, again, his senator, um,
which is that the lobbyists got
the money to give to the
legislature, um, to the
legislator, the, this is just
such a problem problematic um.
Townsend. Thank you, Mr.
President, the sponsor of the
amendment yield.
Yes, Mr. President, I will.
Senators Townsend.
I genuinely trying to
Affect the root cause of the
issues.
Now I, I heard.
Which I think is great fanfare.
I could talk about.
How much money Burmisa gave
Hunter Biden and what the values
of that was, but I'm sure this
doesn't have a thing to do about
this amendment, so we won't talk
about that.
But
Mr. President.
It's about making the public.

Of what the rules are.
And how they should be followed.

houses where lobbyists.
And employers.
Show influence.
If we really want to be
transparent, we should have
adopted that one.
But that's not the case.

should do.
Again
Senator, your amendment.
Is an effort.
To

If we want to stop that.
Then let's stop it.
per diem, but let's turn it off
and make it where it's real and
transparent. That's the way to
make this go away is to
eliminate it just like we do for
amendment. I supported the other
amendment because what we're
really after is true
transparency, not smoking
mirrors. Thank you, Mr.
President.

you, Mr. President.
Thank you Senator for the Center

Mr. President asked unanimous
consent to excuse Senator
Uh, uh, I asked for a point of
privilege then, Mr. Chair.
She's excused in there with your
unanimous consent request.
But the deal is.
thank you, Mr. President, and
just for the information for the
body, I did send, uh, two
sergeants up with the two people
that are out of the chamber at
the moment, so maybe the
minority whip wants to do that
as well.
this, for the call we'll make
sure that the sergeant arms that
accompany them.
Center share we're on the
amendment. I was gonna ask
unconstitutional. Yet I, as I'm
looking for things here, I see
that Tennessee has the same
language. And so if Tennessee
can do that, then the US Supreme
Court obviously hasn't entered
into it and say it was
certain groups specific groups.
If it's in the best interest of
the state, if there's a state
interest in this. And so the
state interest in this
undue, uh, influence over us. So
from that perspective,
Because it's narrowly

people and it happens in other

unconstitutional after somebody
in the Supreme Court says it is.

I believe that there is

Mr. President, I have some
concerns that uh this piece of
legislation.
Might actually result in less
transparency.
I am a Billy Bob Thornton. I am
the registered lobbyist for big
oil
And you are.
That obviously, Mr. President,
would be a scenario that would

Mr. President, I could envision.
The scenario where we wouldn't

contributions, but he's not a
registered lobbyist, and we

for their interest because they

20 states do this now, and
there's a great article about
Colorado that not only did this,
but they required lobbyists and

is no big deal. We're all used
to it. And that's what you're
going to see here. People will
get used to it. They're
certainly gonna not stop
advocating for their industry.
We're not paying for that
constituents. Thank you, Senator
Steiner. Senator Scott, Mr.
President, I don't think there
would be a
of reduction at all.
In the amount of lobbying going
on.
And nobody will admit to being a

comes to pass, can you see how
that might become a problem?

uh senator, I, I.
of wanted to ask it, especially
after your answer to Senator
Scott.
Um
What's the penalty?
For someone breaking the law.
On this particular law.
We do have the Secretary of
State watching, so if they
could, uh, report back to me,
what are the fines for lobbyists
violating the lobbyists
Reporting Act, but it is set in
law, and I think like campaign
Act, if they violate it and
they, Secretary of State
determines the violation, it can
then be moved up the
jurisdictional ladder to the New
Mexico Ethics Commission.
Example, um, that's lobbying
even though he didn't register
as a lobbyist.
Yeah, Mr. President, usually,
you know, looking at ethics
$50 a day and can go up to $1000
a day, uh, for probably, you
know, recurring violations.
Mr. President.
Senator Stein, Mr. President,
yes, they are the ones that
under the lobbyist regulation
Act, the lobbyists actually have
to file with.
And they are, uh, they're trans,
you know, they're

be really an interesting case.

So Mr. President, Senator, I, I
guess I'm a little bit confused
because I know that I've

not? I'm very confused by this.
And they're coming up here and
asking me to give to that.

are exceptions to that,

is the definition of lobbying,

lobbying means attempting to
influence a decision related to
a matter to be considered or

would hope this would be really
bipartisan.
It doesn't matter if you're an
employee of P&M or you're a

to file this report. So that's,
that's really the threshold. So
it would apply to anybody in
that circumstance. The law would
treat them as having to file,
and if they tried to skirt that
and not do it, I mean, that
I don't know that the Secretary
of State would have the
authority to punish Joe Blow.
Just because she thinks he's up
here lobbying and then I'm not
sure there'd be much of a
punishment, OK, find me 50
bucks.
The this thing calls for how,
how quickly does a quote unquote
lobbyist.
Have to report.
uh, the Secretary of State's
office said they could comply
with it. It would be within 48
hours of commencing lobbying
activity.
Thank you Mr. President and uh
Affairs Committee since they
have not met for 3 weeks, so
that's even harder to do, but
kudos for getting that done on
this bill, uh, probably because
it started in the house I'll
that, but how much?
I mean,
What does a lobbyist have to do
to do that?
Well, Mr. President, what the
implementation to give time for
them to create that through
their CEA system. It's also
possible we might be migrating
to a different online platform,
which should frankly not be

that the lobbying activity
reports would have to be
integrated into the bill page
itself for the New Mexico
legislature so that we and
a bill.
Uh thank you, Mr. President.
What about the situation I, I
had, I'm not gonna give away the
name of the company because I
don't want, uh, you know, then
Not one. They didn't advocate
for any bill. They just really
wanted to introduce themselves
to me, is that how does that,
how is that handled? Do they
have to report that they came
and saw me?
deals with.
I see, um, so Mr. President, um,
Senator, so, um,
particular company likes the
bill and so they, you know, hey,
that's a great bill and their
lobbyist comes and says, you
cross that legal threshold of
lobbying on that bill than they
would be required to, uh, to
file an activity report.
I think he was president,
Senator, most of the time it's
the opposite of that. They
thing's gonna play out is when
does this start?
When's your delayed
implementation?
would you be amenable to
amending that to January 1st of
2020. Is it what's after the
next election?
Mr. President, no,
unfortunately, that would not be
friendly, uh, there would be no
need to do that. And again, you
don't have to file anything for
uh developing your own bills any
more than I do for writing all
it and.
Who doesn't give a damn. Thank
you, Mr. President.
We have a floor amendment.

Senator Steinborn.
Well, honestly, Mr. President,
with all due respect, it's a uh
amendment might wouldn't mind
kind of succinctly telling me
what the amendment does and
maybe where the operative part
of the amendment is so that I
can kind of answer, Mr.
President, it would just it

amendment. The intent here is to
All of our constituents suddenly

And all the people who, you
know, are working and they
suddenly get an email and they,

democratic right to engage us.
If you think about it. We think

with strong organizations with
sometimes tons of numbers with
them, and they fill up our
committee rooms and they are
here to lobby for Bill.
in to lobby for what Bill and uh
to whom, Mr. President?
And Steinbar. Well, Mr.
President, again, you know, I
would submit to you that if
somebody, if we're getting lots
which it might, we would
actually know, we would actually
know like,
A paid entity behind that where
we would be able to figure that
the amendment, Senate floor at
number 3, and we are debating
the amendment. I'll go to
Senator Brant, followed by
Senator Gallegos and Senator
Scott, Senator Brand. Oh, thank
you, Mr. President, with the
sponsor of the amendment yields
to
knows where the changes are made
to the bill, and so, um.
What it says is that an
organization engaged in
lobbying.
they're basically advocating or
lobbying for a bill.
Senor Ramos, Mr. President,
that's exactly what I'm talking
about, Mr. President.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
Mr. President, uh, I think, uh,
Senator, you'll have to help me
out with that and explain it to
detail, Mr. President,
Senator, I may have to see if
still a business.
So I'm, I'm not sure why we
wouldn't accept this amendment.
This amendment says that if they
an organization.
does not mean an individual,
which I think was where the
concern was of the sponsor who
engages in lobbying on the
individual's own behalf.
In connection with legislation.
who's being paid by someone.
To bring them up here, isn't
that correct?
Yes, sir, Mr. President, and uh
Mr. President, and, and uh, you
know, there's a lot of times
that they that those groups come
before our committees, and I
would sure like to know.
Who they are actually
representing and who's actually
paying their way.
you know the, uh, you know,
people, you know.
Um, anyway, we can, we can throw
some names around too if I could
remember any right now.
know, and they don't tell anyone
they're being paid by Soros, but
uh it's pretty obvious they are
from what they're doing.
So with this, with this apply to
uh an organization that's Soros
legislate on a daily basis here
for the 60 day session, Mr.
President.
Senator Brent, so Mr. President,
Senator, would, would this apply
to like
Gosh, I don't know.
Sierra Club?
Yes, Mr. President, and not only
them but uh our, our good
friends with the cattle growers
and any other organization that
comes to lobby, Mr. President.
anything so that's just a joke.
Don't take it. Don't take
offense, cattle growers, um.
And then it says an elected or
appointed officer of the state.
or Pueblo. So this would apply
then to gosh um would this apply
to like someone from the
governor staff coming in and
lobbying me on a bill.
So Mr. President, would it apply
to me when I went in your office
earlier in the session and asked
you if you'd support one of my
bills.
Mr. President, no, it wouldn't,
Mr. President.
exempt ourselves from just about
everything. So, um, you know, I,
I actually, you know, if we're
really wanting transparency, you
know, they're, there are a lot
of times.
Mr. President, this would just
involve organizations, Mr.
President.
something or not. That usually
happens. Oh, but they don't
report it to the public.
Oops, I guess we missed someone
senator. Sorry.
Thank you, Mr. President. Do you
Yes, Mr. President.
Miss Presence Senator, earlier,
the sponsor of the bill had
talked about these would be
constituents. So I was trying to
Yes, Mr. President, I sure have,
Mr. President.
A mispresent, Senator, have you
had the school board Association
come up, Mr. President, Senator.
lobbying efforts on behalf or
for or against the bill. Is that
what you're trying to affect,
Mr. President, Senator?
Mr. President, um, we're trying
to affect any organizations that
people, they bring food, uh,
some are paid to be here, uh,
but it is a, um,
They could actually be here, uh,
And mispresence sooner I talked
earlier, I thought I heard you
say elected or appointed. Is
that correct, Mr. President?
Mr. President, yes, elected and
of these uh secretaries or
regents come back and to try to
apply pressure on us for a bill.
They would also have to be a
registered, Mr. President,
Senator.
it'd be really hard on them. Uh,
before you came to the
legislature, have you ever tried
to do a, uh, filing with
Secretary of State, Mr.
President, Senator.
office, Mr. President, and I've,
I've had to file many times in
my career, Mr. President.
Mr. President, Senator, the key
word there is you decided. So if
Mr. President, Senator. Mr.
President, absolutely. And not
only that, but I think the
Secretary of State's office is
very capable of helping people
get through the process, Mr.
President.

it's a hardship. It's something
that we pay for through the
Secretary of State's office for
their training and assistance,
so, uh, I just wanted
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Senators. We have Senator

In the month
An organization engaged in
lobbying shall register, um,
to, um, to file anything or
whether they had to report
anything, um, and I also am kind
of, I'm really concerned
in citizens action which we
would want to encourage as
opposed to, um, what, what I
understand the bill to be is
us anything except their words
and, and I, I just am shocked by
this, by this momentous, this
amendment, which seems to try to
register, um, and then not be
able to be here if they
You know, and then the
consequence for not registering
is pretty severe, um, for
amendment, and I really urge the
body not to vote for this
amendment, which is very
difficult to follow anyway, but
if it's, if it claims, if it
encourage. Thank you, Mr.
President.
Senator Lopez see no further
debate on the amendment, Senator

care about. We care about the

that's the important

although I'm wondering now
because the amendment wasn't
accepted as friendly, um.
But that's exactly what this
they have to put down who
employs them.
So that's buried a little bit.
You gotta know what you're doing
to find it, but it is there.
I'm afraid it's probably going
to result in a lot of people's

it's even unconstitutional.

asking, uh, how much money can I
get here? How much money can I
put there and, and then all of a
sudden their requests are
filled. What happens when, when
they do that?
probably the most kind of fun
thing that fun example to think
about because as you know, Mr.
Chairman, you get about a
million different entities who
lobby on House Bill 2. And in
fact, they're all gonna have to
file and they would all be
their quinceanera dresses, and
they were lobbying on a House
bill that we weren't hearing
yet. And so you're, you're
saying that any group that comes
dresses, no, they do not have to
file. I'll just state it again.
The only, the only, the only
people that would have to file
this report are people who are
paid lobbyists who are
I mean one of them was wearing a
t-shirt, but they, I, I, I would
be shocked and surprised if
they're not, uh, paid lobbyists
and that they're not reporting
of lobbyists, 34 lobbyists, uh,
that, that are working, uh, some
of them are paid at the
university completely around,
but they're still here lobbying.
Now they're registered
lobbyists.
Are they registered lobbyists or
they employees of the
university.
Well, Mr. President, Senator,
that's a fair question, and I
acting in his official capacity.
So, well, in that case, they're
not exactly acting as behalf as
their official capacity. So,
really checking that. What about
Kael Outley? I mean, we get
lobbied on Call Outlay and I'll
just say a chapter house comes
to me. He says we want capital
outlay. They're not registered
They come to us and they say,
we're gonna
We want to lobby you on capital
outlay and then they want to go
Thank you, Mr. President. Well,
you know, we know that um if
they are a paid lobbyists and
they're compensated to lobby for
the Navajo Nation or anyone
else, um, then they would have
to file.
gonna have to come under the New
Mexico laws when, when they're
paid through a sovereign nation.
Well, Mr. President, Senator,
colleagues, this law, this, this
are currently required to file
as a lobbyist because you were
compensated to do so with the
except exceptions, and you would
also have to file this report.
Mr. President, Senator, they're
paid by a sovereign nation.
They, they don't abide by the
laws of the state of New Mexico
for lobbying.
And, and so they're paid under a
or a sovereign nation and so uh
just gets a little weedy in
there. But in Capelali is one of
the big issues and then will
these also be listed in the FIR
who works for the, who works for
committee, who's drafted this
bill, who's brought you this
bill, where did it come from,
uh, and so if they're paid
through a nonprofit and, and
their income is from there,
4 things that they actually
lobby on, so they don't just
have to file hypothetically on
any bill. It's only the things
that they lobby on and under the
have to do this. It's when you
take that step of actually
lobbying on, on a piece of
legislation.
And Mr. President, I mean, the
film industry lobbies pretty
hard in New Mexico and, and they
lobby for advocates, they lobby
and again, if you're a paid
lobbyist, then you would if
you're up here, you know, and
you're, you're a crew member and
you're up here for the day
showing support for the film
industry. It'd be like any other
people don't have to file. You
know, if you're a paid lobbyist,
then you have to file. But if
you're just a private citizen up
here, you don't, including, you
know, members of the film
industry, unless
You're a paid lobbyist.
rules of the state of New Mexico
whether you send somebody into
another country or not, those
are not the rules you, you abide
by. They don't have to abide by
the rules of the state of New
United States. Well, those laws
don't apply on, on tribal and
sovereign lands, but then we get
to the advocate side and you
said in your comments, I mean,
advocates who bring people to
advocating. They got hotel
rooms, they got t-shirts, they
got the whole nine yards and the
person in charge, you know, they
should be registered to
lobbyists and they should be
telling us what bills they're
required to register as a
lobbyist now, and you meet the
legal.
definition of lobbying, then you
would have to file this. If you
don't now, then you wouldn't
have to. I will just add one
I think the hypoth some of the
hypotheticals are brought up
where someone may be out here
and they're being paid, but
maybe there's pseudo advocacy. I
think actually, if you're being
hazy or sometimes lazy, you
know, in compliance and
regulation, you know, and
enforcement. I think this bill
actually would make this elevate
the um
now, you would have to file this
report. If you don't, then you
wouldn't.
Mr. President, Senator, I, I
completely understand the
lobbyist law and what they have
to do and how to do that. But I
mean, we're getting the shady
organized, somebody is
organizing that group of people
and they're lobbying. They're
lobbying on bills, they bring
them in committee rooms, which
is fine. I, I don't disagree
with that. There's a lot of
And they may be the organizer or
whatever, but I mean you could
go to any situation. I mean,
films my favorite because it
costs so much money is if you
portion of our budget when
they're coming to get capital
from us.
They asked for capital for
certain things and some of them
say they're advocates, but
they're actually lobbying to get
company that didn't even exist
as an LLC and they came lobbying
for their capital outlay. There
were actually lobbying for their
cap Alley. They weren't
advocating for someone else to
for and who's behind the
lobbying. That's what we need to
know is who's the, who's the
lobbyist that's bringing all the
advocates up.
To do this, where are they
rooms they had to pay for that's
that'll bring some clarity to to
advocacy.
Uh, because somebody's
organizing those, somebody's
paying for it, somebody knows
If a person from Gallup or a
chapter house that comes to me
and says, I need money to fix a
water well or something that,
that's, that's not lobbying,
that's a group of my
for a whole slew of bills, uh,
and they're, they're organized,
and that's called organized
lobbying in my book, and so this
is one of those things, I mean,
And so it doesn't influence me
in any, any way, shape or form,
but it may other people, but
there's other influences that
are happening that need to be
reported to. Thank you, Mr.
President. We do have further

the sponsor would yield for a
question.
or two please
Mr. President.
Thank you. Uh, wanted to give a
couple of kind of hypotheticals
amendment made. They now have to
file a report that their
position is changed if the
amendment fixes the problem that
they had.
Mr. President, no, uh, because
Mr. President, the school board
association is not an official
group. They're an organization
outside of public government.
hypothetical you can think of.
Whatever the law currently
requires, we're not changing
that law. We're not changing
those parameters. We're just
saying if you are currently
filed, required to file as a
association, um, under your
hypothetical, uh, Senator.
Mr. President and, and Senator,
uh, that wasn't where my
question was. Of course, they've
got a file as a lobbyist and
of page 3, do they have to now
update their report to show that
their position has changed, Mr.
President, yes, they would, and
that's a good question. This
bill, you would have to report
Center souls, Mr. President,
Senator, that doesn't make any
sense. I mean, that's kind of
the point is to get better
legislation and every time
to do that within 48 hours. Uh,
Mr. President, kind of a similar
situation down where I am, New
Mexico State University, uh,
they've got regular lobbyists
up.
another bill introduced that
they are for or against. They've
got to update the file every
time there's another higher
education bill introduced?
over $100. So there are other
dynamic situations where they
have to do this kind of time
sensitive reporting.
Mr. President, uh, I think
president of New Mexico State
came up here. There's probably
the 5th or 6th time that he's
traveled up here, he came and
asked me about a couple of the
higher education bills, um, he
Well, my guess is, Mr.
President, his position has not
changed. I mean, if the
president of the university even
had to file as a lobbyist, and
that's a big if. My guess is his
They require a, a multi-tiered
approach to how they have to do
the reporting. And that's
beneficial because that gives
you more information than just
report it. There's only 3
options. So the most they have
to report, you know,
hypothetically, is probably 3
times, and, uh, and again, once
it's online, again, these are
paid professionals.

an infinite universe of bills,
and once they get used to this
and there's an easy module for
them to do it, and they'll be
involved in the rulemaking by
there are a significant number
of bills of which, you know, as
I worked with the school boards
association and the
superintendents Association
where their positions are
this was already discussed. I
came in late after the
discussion had started.
But who is going to be the
lobbying police to make sure
that this is done on a regular
Uh, who is responsible for
tracking them down, following up
that they were talking to a
legislator about a particular
bill and which side it was on,
State's office.
So, Mr. President, if I have a
lobbyist comes up to me and I
check and see on the Secretary
of State's website that they
the lobbyists all the time.
Well, Mr. President, it's like
other things that the Secretary
of State overseas. I would
include campaign finance in
that, you know, the truth about
have a tough job. Um, obviously
it would be really hard for them
to, you know, aggressively
monitor every single thing or
know the accuracy of it, but I
would submit to you, it is the
law. So if someone's trying to
And don't think for a moment
that's not a serious deal. It
really is.
Mr. President and Senator, as we
all know, particularly this time
uh, that ends my questions. I
just have real concerns about
this particular area. Thank you.
We do have further debate on the
bill. Senator Townsend on the
bill.

you won't know after the

that is correct.

Well, Mr. President, Senator,
you know, that it is definitely
specific legislation, how
exactly if they have to report
the bill number, I think that
would be the best helpful way
gonna be determined by the
Secretary of State by rule,
other than to note that lobbying
on a bill is also going to have
to be listed on the bill page
for the legislature. So it
really is about the bill number,
this. This is just for
introduced legislation, Mr.
President, Senator, many times
we have committee substitutes.
Senate floor substitutes, House
Well, Mr. President, that's a
good question. I think if you
were directly involved in the
substitute, I mean, like
directly involved in it, not
then they use it, but you don't
know about it. If you were
involved in it, then I think
that's what triggers it, if it's
a substitute, but if you're not,
um, and you really weren't
lobbying that issue, uh.
involved in it you're supposed
to identify it by name, number,
or topic, and if it changes,
then you must make you must fall

be filed.
Prior to the end of that time
period in which the governor may
act upon legislation. What about
Mr. President, nothing, sorry,
Mr. President, Senator, nothing
because this is just for
introduced legislation.
So, Mr. President, Senator, what
applies to legislation. Now, if
you were working on a bill,
let's say 2 months, 3 months for
a legislative session. A bill
gets introduced on opening day.
session, once bills are
introduced, your work to help
produce that bill if you were
directly involved in creating
that bill, you would then have
to report that.
Which should be real helpful,
Mr. President, Senator, that's
Uh, line 2.
It talks about a lobbyist or a
lobbyist employer is only
required to report lobbying
activity on a piece of
If a piece of legislation looks
like this today.
President, Senator, that this,
this report is triggered by the
commencement of lobbying, and
that's the language in this
bill. So it is triggered based
file this report. But Mr.
President, that's not what this
piece of legislation says, if
it, it says a lobbyist or a
position changes on that piece
of legislation if it changes by
no fault of theirs, and they
become supportive of it or they
Mr. President.
It talks about under item E the
lobbying activity reported for
each specific piece of
legislation. How is that going
to occur, Mr. President?
Mr. President, Senator, um, so
that is gonna be coordination
between the legislative council
technology.
Mr. President, your bill does
not say that.
Mr. President,
All items in these reports shall
be easily searchable, sortable,
and downloadable by the public
in the extent technically
amending the lobbying Regulation
Act. It's been a while, but this
is common kind of language that
we say to make it to, to know
that we want this information
accessible by the public. So we
these things through rule and
through their own process of
developing it.
But Mr. President and Senator,
again, that's not what this
says. It says it has to be
Sortable and downloadable by the
public to the extent technically
practical.
shall ensure that contributions
reported.
By persons pursuant to the
lobbyists regulation Act are
reported in a manner that is
non-duplicative.
Senator Steinborn, thank you,
you know, I'm, I'm just reading
the language, Mr. President,
Senator.
Mr. President, Senator, this
says that the Secretary of State
shall ensure how in the world is
the Secretary of State going to
insure?
and
Senator, did you meet with
Secretary of State, and they are
on board with this.
Mr. President, Senator,
absolutely, and I've been
a part of it, and they've been
the expert witness for this
bill.
Mr. President.
Senator
I'm, I'm kind of shocked that
no definition and they don't,
this bill doesn't tell them what
they're supposed to do, how
they're supposed to do it, that
just doesn't make any sense.
Um
Mr. President
This bill has
almost impossible for an
employer or a lobbyist or an
employer lobbyist to follow.
There's no definition for it,
and it leaves much to be
I know you're ready to go home.
Um, Mr. President, well, the
sponsor please yield?
Finish timely.
First of all, no one asked me to
carry this bill. Since my first
days as the legislature, it's
really frustrated me looking at
And I, I have often felt like,
you know, the system is being
gamed a little bit because this
information is not being given
know the answer to it. You'll
notice on the floor, I started
asking this question in recent
years, because, because it's an
offense that
We don't actually know that
information.
kind of tell you what a bill
does sometimes. And so, uh,
that's why this bill is being
introduced to give us an
essential tool of decision
making, but not just us, our
voice, and then, frankly, um,
have us be accountable to our
decisions. So, I mean, this is
about good government, pure and
simple, Mr. President, Senator.
So you bring this bill, do you
feel like there's an unfair
advantage.
Going on
Mr. President, I feel like if
you're only being given half a
bill and sometimes those
decisions come back and
Things are revealed after it's
too late.
So Mr. President and senator, I,
Would the governor not have an
unfair advantage? Would they not
be able to lobby the entire
house and Senate.
exempts out uh people elected
officials and acting in their
official capacity, so, but
number 2, it doesn't stifle
anyone's free speech. I believe
everybody deserves a voice.
Because the governors.
Lobbyist
Would not be registered if they
are in her office.
Mr. President, uh, I don't
believe they would, and this is
again under existing law. This
law doesn't change it, it's just
if you have to file right now,
you would have to file this
Mr. President and Senator, so,
so you disagree that her office
would get a, a unfair advantage
under your bill?
This law doesn't give them that
exemption. They're already
exempted, um, so I, I wouldn't
kind of agree with the premise.
It's just there are still are
they still gonna be blind spots
Doesn't shield them. They're,
they're already exempted from
the law.
Would, uh, Mr. President and
not.
Mr. President and senator.
So let's go back to Senator
If I so chose, could I hire
somebody on the Navajo Nation to
come and lobby.
Um,
the Senate or the House?
hire a lobbyist and you're
required to file right now as
lobbyists with the state and you
lobby a bill, then you would
have to file this report.
Mr. President and Senator, so
Their lobbyist with the state of
New Mexico.
Again, Mr. President, as a
sovereign nation, there's
certain things sovereign nations
and I, I, OK, and I've been told
by uh one of our colleagues here
in the Senate, they believe they
do have to file and my expert
says that too, so I'm gonna give
Mr. President, Senator, with all
due respect, it really doesn't
even matter. It's whatever the
current law is, is what would
they have to do. This law
doesn't trigger anyone new from
point of it is, uh, is your law,
there is still loopholes in
there. We're going to be able to
work around that if we so wish.
that makes you feel like you
need to bring this law to the
floor.
Well, Mr. President,
I've been a legislature, uh, a
while.
And, um, it's not what anyone's
done to me. They're just doing
their job. But the point is, is
what, what level of information
do you want as a, as a senator,
playing field and empowering us
to make good decisions in our
constituents. It's not personal,
um.
They're doing their job.
And we're doing our job and so
this is really about a best
Mr. President and Senator, so on
this unlevel playing field that
you're describing.
Right now, who, who has the
advantage?
access, they have influence,
they're up here in the building.
People making a living aren't
necessarily here in this
building. So you, you tell me
who has the advantage, and then
furthermore, if you don't have
transparency as to
playing field.
So Mr. President and and
senator.
Well, Mr. President, I will put
it this way. If we don't pass
this bill, we're allowing
information to remain hidden.
Absolutely, because we have a
tool in front of us right now to
make information public.
report how much they're getting
paid.
So, yeah, so this is if we, you
know, respectfully, if we choose
to not support this bill. We're
choosing this information to

to work the weekend and have
that report in by Monday
morning.
Well, Mr. President, for the
record,
About the only time, literally,
get a relax and meet each other.
So just for the record, I'm not
taking any stakes and I'd be
happy personally banning it all.
But we can have that
conversation later. To answer
your question, my guess is, Mr.
And, and again, this bill says
they only have to point out
their position one time on a
bill.
That's for speaking to all of
us, one time, one person, so
probably they've already lobbied
Mr. President and Senator, I, I
thank you for the debate and you
know, I have a total respect for
you. Unfortunately I'm not gonna
Congratulations, Senator Lanier.
Thank you, Mr. President. This
bill pretends to be a
transparency bill, but it's
trying to make transparency

true transparency. We offered
some amendments that would have
done that. They were rejected
and therefore I believe we
should reject the bill. Thank
you.
