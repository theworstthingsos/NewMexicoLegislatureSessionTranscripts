of onion on.
Representative Black, is.
Representative uh Borego.
Representative Lujan,
Representative Mejia.
Representative Shipinsky.
Representative Zamora.
Representative Little.
Here
Good morning, chair, uh, members
of the committee, uh, thank you
for this opportunity to present,
uh, both of these HCRs, um, I'll
just say, uh, we're doing HCR
one first, but I'll see.
Both of these uh proposed
constitutional amendments.
are intended to strengthen the
legislature.
And I think that's really
important. It's not um
I sincerely believe that part of
the reason New Mexico struggles
in a lot of areas.
is because the legislature is
not as engaged as it should be.
And so these are two
Small but not insignificant
steps.
To strengthen the role of the
legislature and governance of
the city of New Mexico.
So our first HAR is HAR one,
which is uh session length
subjects in over us and you're
all familiar with the way we do
our sessions, which are, which
is laid down in our state
constitution. We have a 60 day
session followed by a 30-day
session. And the topics of the
30 day session are limited. Um,
they are either uh budget issues
or revenue issues or um issues
that you get a message from the
governor on.
And so as a result, our 30 day
session partly because it's
shorter.
Um, we can't work on the bills
that we might have worked on in
the 60-day session.
In my experience has been
I worked really hard on Bill.
Maybe it doesn't get across the
finish line.
And then I'm done.
For 2 years.
Before I can work on that bill
again.
And so you, you know, coalitions
fall apart, momentum falls
apart, you know, here in the
house where we have a two-year
cycle.
You know, we get 1314 new
members. I mean, you're just
back to square one.
Um, so it really sort of limits
your momentum.
And what this proposed
constitutional amendment would
do is, is take the 60-day
session.
And the 30 day session.
And just even them out.
So 45 days each.
And significantly for us.
It would get rid of that
germaneness rule.
So we would be able to work on
our legislation.
Every year we would be able to
come to the legislature, come to
the session, and work on the
problems that, you know, faced
New Mexico.
Um
This bill passed
this committee, uh, last year,
uh, went to the floor, uh,
unfortunately I didn't get hurt
on the floor.
Um, I'm, you know, optimistic,
of course, in 30-day session, or
68 session, we, it will get
heard this year.
Um, I, one other thing I should
talk about, there are
There have been proposals in the
past to instead of doing 45, 45,
like 260 day sessions.
And you know, I, I personally
would support that.
Um, but I also
I will tell you, I can remember
having a discussion about the
session length.
When I was a freshman.
11 years ago.
And nothing has changed.
And my concern is that if we
don't accept incremental change,
and this is an incremental
change.
That in another 5.
8, 10 years.
We'll still be saying, yeah, the
60/30 thing is not great.
We should do something about
that.
You know, this is for the people
who want longer sessions, I get
that.
This is an incremental change. I
think we should.
Give this a try.
And see if we can make it work.
OK, so we.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you members of the committee.
Good morning to everybody that's
here.
Uh
Madam Cha Representative, this,
this is, this is one of those
deals like the, the time change,
it just turns into a big old
mess, doesn't it?
Uh
I could see what you're talking
about.
But then, how do you think?
Representative that
You know, we're talking about
Making New Mexico a paid
legislature.
And I would just imagine we're
gonna see some bills on that in
this session.
So, how is that gonna affect
The length of the session and
the paid legislature and
How, how, how do you see that
all that working out?
Um
Ma'am chairs more, you know,
obviously they're, they're
separate bills.
Um, I, I'm.
Pretty optimistic, um, that, uh.
I can get this through the
Senate.
Um, the, the Senate has been a,
uh obstacle in the past on a
paid legislature, it's something
I personally support.
But separate bills, um, as I
understand the paid legislature,
um,
A proposal there would be a
commission to set the salaries.
Um, so I mean that would operate
independently. The one of the
strengths of this.
And why it's had bipartisan
sport in the past.
Is it doesn't actually increase
the days. It doesn't increase
the cost, doesn't increase the
time because we're
your, your, you know.
Leveling them off from 6030 to
4545. Um, it just, it makes the
process more consistent.
So, you know, I, I know, um.
Uh, I, I've talked to my
Republican colleagues in the
past, and they, they have been
supportive of this, uh, Montoya
in particular, has run this bill
before you might have a
duplicate this year too.
And, and, and thank you for that
answer, uh, Representative Madam
Chair, the
The thing
I see is, is
Think we ought to be happy with
what we have, and I think.
We, we have the 60 day session
in, in
Where we have to pass all these
other bills and really if we
did.
Uh, just all the Germaine bills.
In, in the 30 day session.
Cause
I think it, we'd have a little
more time to do the budget, you
know, pay close attention to
that. And also the budgets.
Being worked on throughout the
whole year.
So, so why do we need to extend
the 30 day session if, if we're
working the whole year.
the interim
To create this budget,
And then just
Fix the little pieces of it in
the 30-day session.
I just, I just have.
I, I think we ought to leave it
the way it is. I think we ought
to go forward.
Uh
And then see how paid
legislature comes through.
And then, and then decide maybe
after that, on the lengths of
session.
But if we're not.
To me, it seems like the
important bills are getting
through.
Uh, I think there's, as we all
know, as, as representatives,
uh, here in, in Santa Fe that
Their strategies and there's
people look at bills and what
bills are important and, and
It's, it, it does seem to be get
clogged up sometimes, but that's
political too. I mean, you, you
know how, how the system works
and
And then another thing is,
As we do so many things other
than 10 to the bills is, why
don't we reorganize the session.
And how it's run. We've
We, we had committee last week
and, and then it got canceled
and then we're doing a bunch of
floor stuff and, and things
don't really flow and.
And you think, could we organize
this better and
And do a lot more work in a 30
day session or in a 60-day
session and
I just
I just feel like we ought to.
Well to leave this alone till we
see what paid legislature does.
Uh
And then, and then look at at
the change of, of the session.
I, I, I don't see any real
Solid
Any solid thing that you're
telling us. I mean, my bill
didn't go through well.
It's sometimes those bills don't
go through.
Might be good for some people
and bad for other people, but
me, may I respond? Sure, sure,
uh, representative, thank you,
Madam Chair. So, Madam Chair,
representative, um,
First of all, I, I, you know,
I think it's interesting that
you say the important bills get
through. You know, I, I think
there's some truth to that.
Um, but I also think
Who decides what bills are
important.
Or currently the governor in the
in the leadership.
Not guys like you and me.
Um, I've served under two
governors.
Um, I've received 0 messages.
To run the bill in a 30 day
session.
Yeah, so I mean, these are
issues that I think are
important.
And I think the people in Mexico
think they're important.
But we have this.
This every other cycle.
The
To me, the best part of this
bill, I mean, I personally think
having 245 day sessions with
provide some consistency and
you'd get
Um
You know, you wouldn't have the
crush of time of the 30-day
session and maybe which, which
I'll address that the waste, the
amount of, you know, frivolous
stuff we do in the 60 day
session. I mean, there's some,
there's some room in both of
those.
But that to me, for the
legislature, the most important
part of this
Bill
Is eliminating the germaneness
rule.
Because the governor, whoever
the governor is,
And you know, our governors can
be of either party in this state
or kind of purple.
They control the agenda.
This is taking a little bit of
that control back for the
legislature, and I think that's
a good thing.
Um, and then you touched on
How we spend our time.
And I
Totally agree. I mean, we.
We waste a ton of time at this
place. And we do, um, you know,
I, I personally would be in
favor of limiting memorials.
Yeah.
Yeah, National Asparagus Day,
you know, whatever.
Like, you could do certificates,
you could do resolutions. You
could take memorials, you could
put them in the rotunda.
You could have a celebration of
National Asparagus Day. Great.
If you want to go celebrate
that, go out to the rotunda. We
could provide a reader to read
the, I mean, there are a lot of
things we could do to make
better use of our time here.
Uh, and I am all in favor of
that.
Uh, and I think if we have these
45 day sessions, we will get
better at that. I mean, it might
It might take a little time.
Um, but I, I think providing
that consistency will give us
the incentive and opportunity to
adjust our schedules so we're
more efficient in the time that
we have.
Thank you. Thank you for that
answer and thank you, Madam
Chair.
I just, I see you're taking.
15 days away from the 60 day
session and I think, well, we're
trying to get more things done
and and need more time to do it.
Well, we're just, we're just
really swapping apples for
apples and we're not.
Because we still do some bills
in the uh
30-day session that
That, uh
Aren't really don't really have
to do anything with the budget,
so.
I, I think I'll have a hard time
supporting this bill. You might
convince me before it's all over
here in a few minutes, but
It just, I, I just feel like we
have a good system.
I don't think, I, I don't think
we change a few days, 15 days,
it's, it's gonna make a whole
lot of difference and.
Thank you, Madam Chan. Thank you
for bringing this bill forward,
Representative.
Thank you, Representatives.
Representative Lujan.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
Thank you, um, Representative
McQueen for this bill, um.
For reasons you've stated, I, I,
I do support this bill. I think
that.
The executive um branch has a
Mr. Browns, but the executive
has too much control over our
legislature, and I do agree we
need to see also with uh
representative Zamora that we
need to see how the paid
legislative piece comes along,
but I think if we move towards
doing uh something different and
ratifying something, giving it
to the public to decide. I think
a 45, 45 is a good compromise
budgetarily.
Wise, I think that's, that makes
a lot of sense to me cause then
we're not going to be adding
more to our budget or taking
away from, if you will. Um, so
that accommodation is, is well.
Um, from a budgetary
perspective, um, also, I'd like
to, um,
Like to say, um,
If
So, um,
other reasons too, I think that
if we, we have um a more say as
legislators there's more control
I see through what is going on
here. One question I have is
under is a significant issue
that, and I don't know if it's
because the way that the
Constitution is written that
you'd have to have another
constitution to amend the
language, but um.
Section
Section
26-1 of the NMSA um imposes a
time limit within which bills
may be introduced during
sessions of the legislature,
limiting introduction of most
bills to the 30th legislator in
a regular regular sessions held
in odd number of years in the
15th.
Legislative day.
In regular sessions held in even
number of days is that addressed
in this?
This amendment, Madam Chair,
Madam Chair, Rosen Lujan, thank
you for that question. So, so
this is actually something
flagged by the analysts, which
had not come up in, in previous
attempts on this bill. Uh, and
so it is a statute 2-6-1.
That specifies when you can
introduce bills, and there's a
couple of things about that
statute that are are odd. First
of all, it references
legislative days, and we know
legislative days are different
than calendar days, like
legislative days are rolling the
clock, never understood that
process, but they're different,
right? And that's in the
statute.
Hence not defined. So it does
say legislative day, not
calendar days, not to find in
the statute what that is. Um, I
will have a bill. I should have
had it yesterday, maybe have it
today to repeal this section.
Because this is something we can
do by rule.
It's not in the Constitution, so
we don't have to do that. But it
also really shouldn't be in
statute.
And we do have a rule, um, I'm
not sure I have a copy with me,
but there's a rule that deals
with 60-day sessions and for
some reason our rule doesn't
deal with 30 day sessions and
only deals with 68 sessions, but
we have the statute and it's
just um it's just, it's not
necessary to put that issue in
our statutes, we can deal with
that internally.
So I will um be addressing that
separately,
madam. Thank you.
Thank you.
Representative onion or new?
Thank you, Madam Chair. Excuse
me. Thank you, Representative
McQueen for bringing this bill
forward. um.
It's not really a question so
much as just a general comment
that we've had in discussion is,
um, in my 3 years here, my 3rd
year, I've seen really good
bills, not go through and not
for lack of popularity or
because of the content of the
bill, but simply because we've
run out of time and as I talked
to constituents.
And I explained the bill process
like the bill passing process,
the legislative process to them,
or I get a lot of really
surprised responses from people
and the fact that if a bill.
dies in session in a 60 day
session for lack of time. I
can't just bring it back to the
following year. If it's not
germane to the budget, I then
have to wait 2 years, um, to
bring it back, provided that I
get re-elected. And so I think
this modernization and, um,
removing the limitations on
germaneness and budget years is
really quite important and I
think that it would also be very
encouraging for the public to
have the opportunity to engage
in the legislative process by
voting.
by um amending modernizing the
Constitution because when I
explain to everyday people who
aren't policy nerds like myself,
um, it's really quite
discouraging. I say, wow, like
passing any bill is extremely
difficult. And I said, yes, it
is. And a lot of that is just
because we haven't updated the
process by which we pass bills,
and I think um people would be
really engaged and encouraged
with the um opportunity to
modernize.
Thank you, Moder Chair. Thank
you, Representative.
Representative, representative,
vice chair Little.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I would
like to move a Dupresentative,
we'll go back to your comment.
And then then you need to.
I
went into the
um. Hello? Hello?
um
amendment where, where, why and
how and one of the of the issues
that I think um
and I was just talking to her.
of governance.
And I think that
this kind of a catalyst um
Jeremy Queen
for these discussions that we
need to have with regard to how
we're looking at our
legislature,
uh, you know, the pop hockey
tiptoes
whether or not we need full
legislature
and I see this
this sort of discussions.
I'm glad
that we're here,
but I, I, you know, I was 288
a long time, um, and, and you
know you know how how are we
in terms of getting things done,
um, and, and you know I, I'm
gonna support this because I
think this raises a bigger view,
um.
And all the issues discussed
here
today, um, and have have
discussed in the past, um,
maybe, you know.
We need to start connecting dots
of, you know, you know.
How long,
Really concerned
this issue because I think it's
a it's a big big issue
we
we get we get to get to the
house, we get to get to the
Senate committees we get to get
to the floor and then we don't
have the
the bill and then we went back
and
and
and uh represented it all over
again
with the same we have to go all
over again.
Uh, so there's a lot of.
that
are connected here
and I think that we need to
start talking about these issues
on on a on on a bigger
and I and I think this is
really, really just power for
that
so
I I appreciate you're raising
these issues,
um, but I I think that that we
need to start connecting the
dots a little bit more because
this is only one piece of that.
and
R.
Thank you
chair.
That.
I know, I know,
right, right? That's good.
representative,
uh, uh, I guess my first
question is regarding the, I'm
just gonna look at the I
I can just
talk about the cost of putting
things on the ballot
and 100
constitutional amendments and I
was wondering.
loud
to amendments on one.
that
would be a way to cut some of
those would be.
Thank you,
ma'am
um, you know, this, this
actually goes to we can we can
we at everything
and the answer is no because
because the rolling,
you can only put one topic,
um so
so these two are you on the.
Thank
you Madam, and that makes sense
I could save money, but I guess
is very important, very, very,
very, very important. So, so
kind of kind of have to
give one at a time and so that
is a good, good.
session.
more
than 45 days I guess.
Is that that considered Madam
represent representative.
Um,
yeah,
it's a maximum of 45 days, so
the indiscretion,
we extended by 3 days
we really should and the
constitution
and that's why.
Thank you, madam. Thank you to
my next question.
So I'm wondering.
If, if
I
put 45
and and let's say
it's
it.
We ran out of 40
in the next session,
would I be able to pick up from
the place I was at in the next
session
I know I know with with our our
current session where we
legislation.
So, it would be technically
because we
we have to kind of kind of the
question. I'm a little
little confused.
Um,
that
that that
that issues and start over.
So that's wanted to change
Um,
that that that that issues and
start over.
So that's something to it,
it's not constitution. That's
that's the way we we always done
things
that could be a discussion about
whether or not she should have
that, you know, ability to
continue on from where you were.
Madam,
thank you.
We could right now
you
We could right now.
Would that, would that be
through
um.
You know, you know, I, I don't
don't know. And and the reason I
don't know because there's
constitutional limitation on
this,
right and so
we consider that this
requirement. I don't don't think
in terms of
in terms of,
so
we tried to do that of the
current constitutional
limitations which, which I'm
trying to live with.
it wasn't on the on the call or
whatever,
you know, and, and I, I, I do
think that this merit.
I like the idea, but, but I, I,
I still have questions regarding
this
merit.
I like the idea, but, but I, I,
I still have questions regarding
if this does
the rules now be allowed.
Would, would that
be reintroducing this.
For me,
a lot of
again
again before
how it functions and
conversations
can be better so I, I, I guess
that's my, my big concern like
the idea of being able to write
a detail.
And I also like the idea of a
well and I'm sure we'll get to
next time.
um what specifics.
During conversations putting
forward this
versus 3
when it comes to things that
people are very very important
because if I had to
I don't know the
the.
The right, right, the asparagus
really like your idea.
What, what is the big big
roadblock that you see other
than just the time I know I know
there's there's other states
What, what is the big big
roadblock that you see other
than just the time I know I know
there's there's others
that I think.
don't have you don't have a
length.
length session.
So I'm wondering if those
conversations were made and if
you have
concerns regarding that.
Is there um
in terms of you know
efficiencies you know as we've
talked about
things, um,
we have,
you know, events, um,
yeah, what is the basketball
game and I, I, I mean, I mean I
think basketball. I mean it's a
good
good team building with the
money for cars.
2 weeks of the session.
I mean he
shouldn't crunch time we got we
got we shouldn't play
basketball, you know, sort of
things like that um in terms of
shortening, uh, I, I believe
like I wasn't aware that there
are longer,
so I don't think there's there's
a 30 sessions.
I totally agree
with that to the point where in
the country
and so I know some states have
legislatures and so I I guess.
I believe in your opening
talking about even.
Is that what you, what you see
this kind of kind of like crack
the door
maybe in the future of
the emphasis could be
just
4 days right
now and we can have
conversations in the future.
Um,
so there was a period in the
year
and I think it was 30 days every
other year and then then they
they that was a really well so
they they changed it uh and
and I
think it was 30 days every other
year and then then they they
that was a really well so they
they changed it uh and and uh I
I forget the progress and then
like
you
know 30 days and then
60 you know so it's something
that
that's over to do.
Um, my, my, my intent,
is 45 days
and then we try to work and
that's actually um.
That, that's position has been
that
that.
People who want to have 65
sessions.
We're not gonna come back next
year in 60 sessions. Yeah, I
think, I think I think that's
right, like, like I think we're
going to vote for.
I don't think you should be
doing that, so to me, you know,
sessions
we work on our efficiency. We
work on our timing, we work on
our process.
We, we do our uh good faith
to make decisions effective for
legislature and the city of
Mexico.
Yeah, in the future that
something else whether it's
shorter. I mean that's, that's
probably that's
to address.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
Thank you.
That make sense.
I definitely need to consider.
I know that a lot of I don't
know if there's ever been a
measure that's failed. So
technically I'm fatigued by the
time I get to the bottom of my
belly.
I'm sure you probably have a
Sotendments that failed.
twice in the past.
I'm a history lesson here, so
thank you a couple more
questions regarding the
current legislation.
So go into effect.
Uh, I, I, I forget the.
Whenever we could.
It has to go to the voters, so
um it would go to voters in the
next general election
November 26,
2027. So it will not affect our
our next 30 day session our next
next session will be 30 days.
So,
so yeah, that's kind of my
my question and I guess it's
probably no rules were suspended
or changed.
Jump to the next,
it would only be within the
currently the legislature
within that same legislature. Is
that what I'm understanding.
That's right.
Thank you Madam.
Thank you representative that
clears it up for me a little bit
and then I just ask a quick
question
about the session.
Could you tell me a little bit
more about how this may continue
or does this change that since
we don't needs anymore or we can
just go in.
Uh,
it doesn't change.
Uh,
uh, session constitution
Uh,
uh, session constitutional
and legislature not affect that.
And so the way I understand it
is 45 day session
would be allowed to overrides of
the previous session in the
legislature or 9th.
So we wouldn't have
extraordinary
understanding
we need we need to
that is actually
correct.
Thank
you so much for listening to is
you bringing this forward. Thank
you so much.
You.
got out of
it really brief.
Um,
I really support this, um.
It is incremental approach to me
it is really about strengthening
the legislative branch.
And um.
We're not expanding our
footprint in the number of days.
So in this constitutional and
very efficient.
Because we're not changing the
number of days,
um, dramatically increasing our
ability to respond to issues.
Um, the other thing I say is
when,
uh, challenging election year.
They are rightly spending all of
your time in an election year,
talking to voters, learning
about the district
you have to get to address the
issues that you just learn
about.
elected
in November and then basically
to.
Ram up and learn
if you learn the process, um,
uh, drafting. You don't have an
opportunity to remember,
and then that 60 session is
there. You learn a lot and then
The next, everything that you
want to.
Or crafting something with a
budget impact and it really
limits.
Our role.
One is, um,
Um.
to
the start of the 45 day session
Tuesday.
In January
Uh, the reason I bring that up
is
Uh, I think it's really
important that when we're in.
duties
and
in previous years, the filing
has been raised
um and I think in.
Uh,
election years during the
session.
Um
uh.
I believe the the issue with the
final was significant in the
bill that
try to
create sessions.
Um, I, I, I don't think it's
impacted by this.
Um, I personally, um,
and, uh, moving the 3 a week.
Um,
that could be January,
um, so it's a little bit early.
Um
And I'm.
I guess cautious about like
trying to dress up on the fly
that may be something you need
to look at, but I, I appreciate
your comment about the cycle
that like you get elected in the
60 session coming up and I think
it's hardest on freshmen.
But it, but it affects the rest
of us as well, and it's ironic
because it actually would be
Better instead of 60/30, if we
had 3060.
You know, because then, you
know, we could be working on
these bills during the interim.
You know, right, you know.
As it currently stands, you
know, after the 30 day session
when I should be working on
bills for the next 60 day
session. I'm running for
re-election, and it's hard to do
both.
I appreciate that comment.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, and,
and I don't want to propose
anything on the fly either, so
perhaps we can look at it before
judiciary, um, and the other
suggestion I was just gonna make
before this bill goes to
judiciary is
Um
Just taking a second look at the
long title.
And
Ensuring that we are adequately
conveying to the voters.
The nature of the change, so the
long title currently summarizes
What this bill does, it doesn't
actually summarize the change,
and so, um, uh, Madam Chair and
Representative McQueen, I'd love
to work with you to discuss that
with you before.
Um, if, if this bill makes it
out of this committee.
Um, before the next committee
because I, I.
I just feel very passionate that
we should describe things
accurately so voters really
understand what they're voting
on, um.
On the ballot. Thank, thank you,
madam.
Madam Flo leader, uh,
representative.
Good morning, madam chair,
members, um, representative Emma
Queen, um, as a new member.
Um, my understanding is
That, oh.
What I understand, yes.
It, it's, we're pressing on
time. So,
My question is, explain to me
what is this trying to fix.
If we don't have enough time to
pass.
Bills. Why are we trying to
shorten the time.
To 45 days.
Um, madam chair representative
Mejia, uh, nice to meet you. Um,
that's, you know, that's been
the concern of some people that,
you know, there are people who
feel that we have a hard time
getting things passed in 60
days, and in the current system,
at least we have 1 60-day
session.
Um, you know, I, I think there's
some to that, um.
I also think um as we've talked
about it's some length already.
We're really inefficient.
Yeah, and we could do better
with the time that we have.
Uh, and, and I think this would
sort of force that issue.
Um
We, we had a session a couple of
years ago during the pandemic.
And it was all virtual and we
had some additional restrictions
in order to make it work, um, we
weren't doing memorials.
And we have bill limits.
So people can only introduce so
many bills.
And even though that was during
the pandemic.
That session was really
efficient.
I mean, so it, it can be done.
If we have the willpower to do
it.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you.
You. Now back to Vice Chair
Little.
Madam Chair and thank you
committee members for your
questions. Uh, I, Madam Chair,
I'd like to move the, uh, do
pass on Housetri Memorial One.
OK, I have a motion for due
pass.
Second by Representative Anya
Nornu, please call Ro.
Representative on you know.
Yes.
Representative Black.
Yes.
Representative Borego.
Yes.
Representative Lujan.
Representative Mejia.
As
Madam Floli Shipensky? Yes.
Representative Zamora.
No
Representative Block.
No.
Representative Mejia.
No.
I Chad Little.
Yes.
And Cher Johnson.
Hey, uh, Representative, uh,
Chairman McQueen by vote of 6
and support, 3 in opposition.
Your house joint resolution one
has passed.
This is not your first rodeo
since your second go round
and there was a really good
relevant discussion. So thank
you for bringing this forward.
Good luck in your next
committee.
Thank you, uh, chair. Hopefully
I can just stay right here right
there for
house joint resolution 2.
Um,
Thank you Madam Chair,
committee, um, we've previewed
this a little bit. How's
resolution 2 eliminates the
pocket veto, a veto is when the
governor does not act on the
bill, and it is uh de facto veto
does not become law, and there's
no reason stated why.
Um, this bill doesn't limit a
governor's ability to veto
legislation.
It just asks for an explanation
why. And so the way we do that
is if a governor chose not to
act on legislation, it becomes
law, as opposed to
Being vetoed.
Um
And this is a, this is an
important, I think transparency,
um.
Change, uh, as we talked about
in the discussion in the last
each year.
It's hard to pass legislation.
And
You work really hard, you get
legislation, you know, you get
past two chambers, it goes up to
the 4th floor, um,
And it gets vetoed and you don't
know why.
And that's not good for the
public, and that's not good for
us.
Um, so I've had Bill's pocket
vetoed under both governors I've
worked under, and it's, you
know, it can be a little
frustrating.
So this again is a bill that I
think um
I think it's good for the public
and transparency, but it's also
good for the legislature. If we
know why governor is vetoing a
bill.
That gives us an opportunity to
address those concerns.
And come back in the subsequent
session.
And have a bill that is uh that
can be not only pass the
legislature but be signed by the
governor.
And with that, I'd be happy to
answer any questions.
Thank you, uh, Chair McQueen.
Now let's go to the audience for
uh public comment and support.
Please raise your hand if you're
in the audience and supporting.
To the
Thank you. OK, next, please.
to
today.
Thank you.
You
OK, Zoom, do we have any?
Um
Supporting comments on Zoom.
OK.
OK, Chad Beer.
Can you hear us on Zoom?
Who's next?
We'll go back to Chad. Uh, let's
go back to the audience for
comments and
Anybody in the audience
opposition, seeing none. Let's
go back to Zoom.
Can you hear us?
Thank you so much, Madam Chair.
Thank you, uh, Representative
again.
I feel like it's been so long
since I saw you last. No, just
kidding.
So your bill, I just have a few
questions.
First, or your, your resolution
rather, uh, Madam Chair
Representative.
I'm wondering, does this
Message
Does it have to be one single
message per piece of
legislation.
Because I, I'm thinking in my
scenario here.
Madam Chair Representative, I
know it's not even a scenario
cause it happens. They are line
items, let them, let them vetoes
in the budget.
So there may be 200 vetoes in
one piece of legislation and so
Madam Chair Representative, I'm
wondering, does the governor
have to go individually to each
line stricken or each, each
section, for example, and give
some kind of justification for
that, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Uh, ma'am, in a block, yes, uh,
the, the language is any veto of
a bill in whole or in part, so
that would include linear and
vetos.
OK, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. So
then, if, if the governor
decided to veto a specific
county's capital outlay, for
example, for some reason that
was unstated, it could be, it
was wrongly done or there was a
duplication with, with the, with
the governor have to say, OK,
Lincoln County or Union or let's
just say Otero County, Otero
County, I didn't see the proper
protocols happen here or that it
wasn't shovel ready or whatever
the reason is, her project, or
could it be like per section?
just really, I want to know
because line item is included,
but does it give specific
guidelines on what that must say
per item, Madam Chair,
representative.
Mechas and block, I believe the
um.
Uh, the requirement would apply
per item.
So, you know, I guess sometimes
capital projects are for, you
know, X, Y, and Z in a certain
county, that might be one item,
but if you had separate capital
outlay allocations, you know,
maybe um.
Uh
Maybe people want to build
gymnasiums, and there is kept in
3 different counties.
And perhaps the veto would be
that it's not appropriate for
the government to own uh
gymnasiums, and that the reason
could simply be stated for each.
Um
Each veto.
OK, that, that does make sense
and I hope, I just, I'm really,
I really want, if this does
pass, for that to be the case, I
would just hate for the governor
to just line out and veto a
whole bill and say, well, I did
it in part and so this is the
reason part part of the bill was
gone and it could be.
Vague language or something like
that they didn't like. So I just
want to make sure that your,
that's your legislative intent
for the record and I think we
got that, but if you want to
expand on that, I would love to
hear that, Madam Chair.
Mantes and block it in whole or
in part, so.
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, uh, Representative.
Next question, the actual
message from the governor.
Does it have to be specific?
Does it have to say I just don't
like this. And is that
justification enough since it's
technically a message.
If I was the governor, I, I just
don't like a member of the House
or Senate. I vetoed it and I
just said.
I don't like it. Would that be
OK or does it have to be
specific? And where can you,
we're in this HGR does it say it
must be specific if if that's
the case, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Me to represent block that that
is uh an issue that we discussed
on this uh last year, um.
I think it's a significant
issue. I think we might be
having some further discussion
on that today. Um, you know,
currently, it does not, it just
says an explanation.
And you know
It could be the explanation
could be, I just don't like it.
The explanation could be, I just
don't like you.
I, I mean, you just, you know,
those would be explanations. I
think if a governor did that,
you know, they would pay uh
public relations price. I mean,
I think that would make them
look bad. And I think, you know,
I, I assume a level of good
faith uh in the operation of our
government, um, it doesn't
always happen, but, you know,
my, my hope would be that, you
know, like, like certainly I
don't expect the government to
say I don't like you, but a
governor could say,
I believe this is contrary to
the health, safety and welfare
of the state of New Mexico.
Just say that over and over and
over again.
That's, that's an explanation.
I, I don't think that meets the
spirit of, of what's in here,
but, um, uh, that, that could be
an approach.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Representative, and
I, I agree with you, it would,
it may be a PR nightmare, but
we've seen governors survive a
lot worse than just veto, right?
So, Madam Chair Representative,
I'm wondering,
I, I would just love a little
clarity.
I was the governor and I was, I
was sending a message. You, you
could, it's kind of a license to
just
Copy paste
It's not within the public
health and safety of the state,
and that's why I vetoed it, and
it could just be like a canned
response, and I don't want that
kind of
Really
Withdrawn kind of response from
a governor, and I know you've
had
Um, you've spoke to people about
this. I'm just wondering if
that's something you'd be open
to amending, maybe not right
now, but maybe in the future
just to say a
A detailed explanation or a
specific explanation, whatever
the word is from council
service, they're smarter than I,
but Madam Chair Representative,
I don't know if you had those
discussions or if you're even
open to that maybe in the next
committee, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Um, ma'am Cha Rosenblock, uh, I,
I am open to that. There have
been discussions, uh, detailed,
uh, specific, um, have been
suggested substantive.
Explanation might, might be an
approach.
Um, and that would give it a
little more teeth.
Madam Chair, and thank you,
Representative Knight. Yeah, I
think that would be a good, good
change to that bill. I won't
make an ad hoc amendment. I
don't even think that's allowed
or whatever, but if it is, I
wouldn't do it right here. So,
another question, what other
states, Madam Chair
Representative in their state
constitutions have like similar
provisions regarding the vetoes
and what what needs to be said
in that message or if there even
is.
A lot of recedents within the
country with such, such a HGR as
this, Madam Chair,
Representative.
Ma'am chairs and block, I don't
know. Um, I just think we need
more transparency here in New
Mexico.
Madam Chair, and thank you,
Representative, and I, I
appreciate that and I also think
maybe in my last line of
questioning, maybe even some
kind of standardized format
could be in place as well to
say, OK, this is what I, this is
what I vetoed on line 5. This is
what section it was, this is who
it affects. I know it's it's
probably getting long that
constitutional amendment will
probably be really long, but
we've had other constitutional
amendments that have been pretty
lengthy, but that would just be
a suggestion of mine cause I, I
think that.
It might give guidance to the
governor instead of just saying
I don't like this, or
Public health, welfare and
safety, etc. So that's just a
suggestion, but I will continue
to listen to the debate today
and
I like the idea and
In theory, I just would love to
get a little more specificity
and if we had that word, just a
word, I would be a heck yeah,
I'm totally voting for this. So
that's that's all I had, Madam
Chair, and representative and I
don't know if you have a comment
on that or if that's all, Madam
Chair.
the
A form is a great idea and that
might be something a governor
adopts internally, kind of like
we have forms for our uh
committee analysis, which are,
you know, the so to address
certain issues. Um, we typically
don't put forms in our
constitution, let alone on the
ballot but or in the
constitution.
Your representative.
Committee members,
Representative Barrego.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm just
gonna repeat my previous comment
is I think that.
Um, again, this is a catalyst.
For looking at our governance
system, um, I think that it
might be uh beneficial at some
point in time to have a
Whether it's uh.
You know, an intergovernmental
committee that looks at
Our lengths, our pay, or I mean,
all of these things together and
the veto powers that the
governor, um, and I did have
this situation, my first year.
Um, I proposed something that
the governor vetoed and I didn't
know why. I had to go find it.
Myself through looking through
all of the bills to figure out
where and why, and, you know, I
did eventually find out why, but
I had to ask the questions, you
know, um.
Was it in a in a in honestly, I
mean, it was something that I
did. I put something into um.
Grow,
that should have been in
capital.
Um, and, and so that was, you
know, that was just a
misunderstanding and probably
not really understanding the
whole grow process, um.
But I do think that um and I
worked for government in the
80s. Um, I worked at state uh
they used to call it state
personal, it's human resources
and um DVR and I also worked at
taxation and revenue department,
um, coming back after 35 years,
um.
I was actually very surprised
how much has not changed.
And so I, you know, I think that
it behooves us as
representatives and leaders of
our state to ensure that we have
good governance that's efficient
and that uses taxpayer money
wisely, um, and, um, I, I do
think that it's important that
the governor has some sort of um
Justification for why things are
vetoed. I, I, you know, I didn't
want to get into what
Representative Block was
discussing.
In that detail, but I do think
that at some level, we, you
know,
We are responsible to the public
and it behooves us to make sure
that our processes and our
procedures are up to date and
that they're being as effective
and efficient as possible for
the, the.
I sound like I'm running for
office again, but I'm not. I'm,
I'm actually, my background is
in public administration and
process is very important to me.
So that's why I mentioned um
You know, that maybe an interim
committee or something at some
point, um, to look at all of,
all of these processes and how
they are connected.
Representative on.
And Chauva dope.
I have representative
I was also going to move a do

don't like you. It's just
because of that one.
One word that I would love

changes, it will indeed be ready

on the floor. That's all, Madam
Chair.
Thank you all very much.
