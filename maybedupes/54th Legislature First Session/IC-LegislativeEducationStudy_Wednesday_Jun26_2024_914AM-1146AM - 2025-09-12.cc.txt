>> Good morning. How, how
are, how's everybody's day?
It seems like everybody's pretty happy
because of the cool weather.
Let me talk to you a little bit about the
weather about, about a couple
of weeks ago and I was, I was mentioning it to
Stan this morning about a couple
weeks ago. Uh, it
was really hot and dry. It
was like 87.
So,
so y'all say 100 and
five is hot is by 87
and 90 degrees. It's pretty dry.
We got the rain about a couple of
weeks ago, about 2.5 inches of
rain. It's really greened up. Uh
Weather's great. We ordered this
weather just for you all
and we are more than happy to entertain
any functions you may have in the future
here at the Great Chung Valley.
Ok. Uh I
again, I, on behalf of the school
district, I'd like to welcome all of you
to Cha Valley Schools.
Um I'd like to talk
a little bit about our
community in general.
Uh Chama, the
Cha Valley School district is made up of
about, there's about
12 communities
that encompass this whole
area all the way
from the southernmost
end of the district in Kil Law
to Chama in the most northern
end of the district. It's a very
unique area.
Uh A lot of people,
uh we, we've
got quite a few people that have
moved into the area and has
changed the dynamic of the setup
is we, we don't have as many
locals as we had in the past.
We have a lot of snowbirds and so
forth. It's changing. It's kind of turning
into a mini pagosa,
which I'm a little terrified
of at this point. But,
but it changes is, is
coming. Uh,
I've, uh, I've been, I
grew up here in
Chama. I, I, uh, I was born in
65 and now
I, I always used to hear the
older people say that they're dating
themselves. I did,
I was born in 65.
I attended school here in
Chama. I, I did uh
attended the K through 12
in Chama. And then I left
to Albuquerque for four
years where I
went to UN M got a degree
in education and returned
in 87. I have been here ever
since. So I'm 58 years
old. The first four years
of my life.
Uh Of course, I wasn't in
school. I was at home
uh and four years
of my college career, I
was not within the school
district. So all
but 40 all but
it about 50 years going on.
51 years have been
affiliated with the school district
either as a student, as
a teacher and now
as a superintendent, I'm proud of
this district. This is where I
want to be. This is where I wanna
finish off, hopefully, but who
knows, maybe something else
will present itself. But anyway,
uh welcome all to the Chuma
Valley. Our, our district
is, is composed of
uh two Elementaries. We
have a K six Elementary in
Chama, K, six, Inra Maria.
We have, uh, we have actually
pre K at both sides as
well. We have two middle
schools and one high school.
Our student enrollment has
declined, uh, immensely
since the past few years. I mean, we're
down to about 365
students. I graduated
in 1983 with 64
students. Graduation
pictures on the back there received
lots of faces this year. We
graduated 27.
In the past we've graduated
as little as 17. So our
enrollment is declining
yet. It's, it's a
unique and special place to
us.
Located
within the valley are,
are abundance of our natural resources
to the south. We have Carson National
Forest. That's area 51
or unit, 51 for those of you
that are, are avid
hunters and,
and to the northern end of the
district, we have both Sergeants
Wildlife Refuge and Humphreys
Refuge as well. We have
Cumbres and Toltec and
in the central part of the district, we
have Heron Lake and we have
Vato. So there's lots of things
to do. Those of you can attend
your meeting and you can
fish afterwards. I mean, there's plenty
of places to go. I have
something else to offer you. I've
got a private
ranch. I've got some,
my dad dunks, my dad.
It's about a mile
and a half of river of Brazos
River and you all are more than
welcome to fish. It if you like
your families. Now, throughout your
stay, I'll be here.
So if you want to set something up, we
can coordinate and, and,
and I'll take you out to the property so you
can fish. So you'll have some fun
there as well.
A little bit about education that I'd
like to share with the committee.
Uh, something I, I think we
really, really need to kind
of, uh, kind of know
about And it's the teacher
residency program that the PE D
has actually sponsored,
um,
that residency program along
with Northern New Mexico
College.
Doctor Sando Rodriguez
in particular has
been the savior for a lot
of these small school districts
in terms of teacher preparation
and, and being able to recruit and
retain teachers.
I don't know if you're very familiar with that
residency program, but that
program does allow
school districts to
train their student teachers
the way they need to be
trained where they're gonna
be placed and so forth. It is a
win win situation.
I only wish that this program
uh continues its support
uh throughout the state. It's
one heck of a program
10 years ago. If you'd have
asked me about
education, I
would have told you
what I want to tell you right now
is I have four kids.
My oldest child
didn't, he didn't,
he didn't go uh take the
educational path. He became
a, a farmer. He's a rancher,
he's a producer, cattle
producer. And so forth
my three other remaining students.
I discouraged them
up to 10 years ago
about going into education.
I, as a superintendent of
a public school did not
want my own kids
to go into education because of the
way I thought education was
heading.
Um, that's
changed, uh,
you know, over the past few years.
Um, I, I think we've seen some
improvements in terms of the way
education is perceived
throughout the state.
I think it's now looked at
as a, as an honorable
profession
and, and, and I think these
teachers are being treated fair.
This residency program is,
is a perfect example
of providing individuals up to
$35,000 a year
salary just to do their student
teaching. It keeps them in
the game, it keeps them
interested. This is,
this is a great program I
cannot speak
enough about, about how this
program uh is going
anyway. Back to my, my, uh
my Children, my second
oldest became a
detective for a PD. He was
there for, for seven years
and he, uh
he liked Albuquerque,
but every
day I talk to him,
every time I've talked to him, I keep
trying to convince him to come
home. Well,
punt, you come home, you don't need to be shot
at there in Albuquerque. Come home,
come, I'll give you a job in our school
district. You can teach.
I got him to come home. He now teaches
physics and chemistry
for our school. District. He's also
one of our, one of our coaches,
my daughter who was going into
law, she started
doing a little bit of subbing during her
vacation
and she come home and tell, talk
to my wife and I about her experiences
in school eyes
this big
today in the skinner class.
We did this and we did
that. And I told
my wife, I said she's going to
change and go into
education.
No, she won't. She, she's always
wanted to become an attorney. So my
wife said, well,
she changed. She's now in
education. She's been in education
for about 78 years
and she's now one of my mid-level
coordinators. She did an excellent
job. Now, my youngest
one, uh
he's the wild
child and, and those, you have
multiple Children, you, you can relate
to that for the
longest time. He was trying to
find his way in society.
He tried different things,
different places.
He came back and did some subbing
for us and some coaching, loved
it loves education.
Now he's going into
education. So you can say
my family
come is, is, is, is a family
of educators. My grandma was an
educator. My dad was an educator.
My uncles were an educator. I
am and now my kids are
educators. I'm proud of
being an educator. I'm proud of our school
district and
welcome, welcome everybody. If
there's anything I can do for you during your
stay, please feel free to ask
either myself or one of my staff
members. Again, that fishing
invitation is open
and you are more than welcome to come
in and have some fun out
there. Thank
you.
Can you just >> pull the I a little
closer >> to
>> members represent
Figueroa?
>> Thank you for welcoming
us here and
um sharing
that story of
folks going into
education because
that's a, an
essential concern.
It's great to hear the residency
program is working up here
and it's great
that teaching
as a pathway has become
viable has become
affordable. The
compensation is
livable and that
people are being drawn to the
profession. That is
super important. My
question for you would be
what's, what's
your workforce look like in
terms of aging out up
here in Chama because I know across
the state we have an
older education
workforce. We're third
oldest in the country or something
right now. And I wonder
if Chama is facing
a time when a lot of teachers
are going to retire
at the same time, or if
you have concerns about
that. >> Yes. Yes,
ma'am. We, we did have concerns
that did happen a few years
ago. But, uh, we're
at a point now where a lot of our
teacher force, a lot of our workforce
are younger. And,
uh, and, and that's a result
of being able to recruit them into
education because of how
or how we're looking at perceiving
education at this point in time.
I've got a lot of instructional assistance.
So I've talked into pursuing a degree
in education. So now
they're, they're on that
path. I've had a lot of
individuals that I've been able
to talk the, talk to
or talk out of their,
their, their former
occupation and come to teaching.
So we did
recognize that as a potential
issue. A while back when I
took over as a superintendent,
uh, we did experience
those little, uh, those
little flaws, those little woes there at that
time. But now we're back
on track and, and we've got a
plan and we just keep
trying to continue
recruiting for, for the future
is what we're trying to do. And, and
we're really introducing that,
that teaching concept into our
high school students as well. And we've got a
couple of kids that are already
interested.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you
superintendent. So, the things you've
mentioned that are working
for Chama are grow
your own teacher
residencies and
the increase teacher
compensation, is
there anything else you would
highlight from your
perspective that
is really working up
>> here. Mentorship.
You've got to continue with
teacher mentorships, a
lot of individuals
or, or I should see a lot of few individuals
believe that one year of mentorship
is sufficient. It's not.
Uh although you have an excellent
teacher, I urge uh
superintendents and school
personnel to continue with mentorship
to up to three, even
four years. I do this
until my level one teachers reach
level two, sometimes
level two teachers will
receive assistance to,
to uh reach level three.
But you've got to continue
mentorships. You've got to provide
that support. You've got to
have really good
principals, instructional
leaders that can provide
that support that are understanding
and cognizant of what's going on
in, in, in uh in our students
lives. We're fortunate
here. We, we're a small community. We
all know each other. So my
principals know each family,
they know what's going on, they know what's,
what's troubling these
individuals and they're able to
address those issues. Uh
probably in a way
that a lot of larger school districts
couldn't
do.
>> Thank you. Thanks.
Chair.
>> All right. Other questions
from members.
I have a question superintendent
um about
students. What are some of the
overarching student needs
or issuess that you all
face here in the district
that your students face.
Rather. >> You
know, we, we, when,
when that question is asked
of school personnel, a lot of times
we say funding.
Uh but you
know,
that's, that's not a major
issue. I think
um
one of the issues
uh that we're dealing
with are, are Vape
vaping and Vape pens.
That's a major issue. Uh
Of course, that's,
it's, it's not a very healthy
habit, but in addition
to that is we're getting individuals
that are flushing these Vape pens
down our, our toilets
and they're, they're messing up our lift
stations and it's costing us
some money to, to
address. We, we do have,
uh, we've taken some measures to
see what we can do to prevent them, but that's,
that's been a major issue.
Uh, when I was once a
principal, I deal
with, uh, a few
issues but never had to deal with a
Vape issue like we're having to deal with
nowadays. So I, I would say that's probably
one of our biggest issues is, is
vaping
>> and I guess superintendent,
um, we're gonna
be hearing about
attendance.
Um, you know, we've heard a lot
about student attendance.
Um, have you had issues around
student attendance? And if so
for what reasons?
>> Yes, we have, we've had issues with student
attendance but,
uh, we've also
contracted a couple of
individuals, school personnel
to assist us in making sure that
these individuals come to school. But
the attendance problem that
we're experiencing at this point
is really not of
the students of
native studentss of the
area. They're usually
students that are transplanted
into the area. They're coming from Las Vegas,
Nevada to live with their
grandparents or they're
coming from other,
other uh other
cities to live uh
with, with other family
members over here. It
seems like those are the issues we're
having in terms of uh attendance
with those, those particular
individuals. Uh
We have a more
uh the the
two individuals that I hired for
to help me attendance program. Once a
1983 graduate
from Escalante High school, he was my
classmate. He's my community
liaison and my other
one is a 1988
classmate, I mean class
graduate of Escalante High
school. So these
two guys know
the area, they know the
people and they, they
understand that uh you
know, this
problem could, could really
manifest itself into something
that we can't control in the future. So
they really go out there and they talk to the
parents about this. So we've
been able to address it that way. And again,
we're a small school district. So it's
a lot easier for us to address it that
way.
>> And I guess I'm curious with the,
the two hires you talk about
specifically, they're specifically
for attendance. Is that right?
>> 11 of them is a school resource
officer who assists in
attendance and the other one specifically for
attendance, community
liaison,
>> glaucoma.
And, and so
with these
hires, I guess I'm
curious. Um Had
you used any of the federal
money for this?
Um
>> I use title, I utilize
title one money for my community
liaison because it's through my
title one program uh
for my uh
my SRO we use
operational
funding.
One of the other things I like to mention
and, and it's kind of slipped my mind but
now that you talked a little bit about
this and we're, we're discussing teacher
retention and recruitment is
housing. Housing
in rural communities is an
issue. Housing in the
Channel valley is an issue.
Affordable housing is
more of an issue.
Um I I
attempt to recruit these teachers
from out of district and I cannot
find housing. I've got like four
housing units and
now at least there's some avenues or
opportunities for school districts to
attain funding to acquire
housing. That wasn't
as, as, as we didn't have
that in the past, as much as we have it.
Now, we have those opportunities
now. But teacher
housing is
an issue for small communities
right now. We're OK.
But in the future that could
be a an issue which
you know, brings us back to
the question you had regarding
teachers that retire
and you're gonna recruit these teachers from
out of district. There's no place to
live. People over here that
have houses to live, they
want to become millionaires and,
and charge you 1500 to
$2000 for a 23
bedroom house that's
not working over here.
>> And when you say a problem
for the future,
how long are we looking at next
year? Three years, five years, >> 10
years. It's going to be a major issue
within the next 23 years.
Major
issue.
Not only for school districts but
pretty much for, uh, the, the
whole valley. You know, it's, it's
a, it's a big issue.
I mean, that, that the
potential uh
uh homeless uh
situation.
You see that in, in, in
cities. But I mean, we're, we're
seeing it here
now.
>> All right.
That was it for my questions, other
questions, members.
All right. Well, thank you so
much for, for hosting us.
So we look forward to the next
three days of our meetings here
and, and in the area.
Thank you. Thank
you.
All right members.
So, um
we have some
items to vote
upon. So we have the minutes
behind, I believe I saw them
behind tab
one. There we go.
Tab
one
from our meeting last
month in May
and I have a motion
on the minutes
adoption. All right. So
we have the adoption of
the minutes. Second.
I believe we have a quorum
here. That's right.
All right.
567.
All right. So we
do. So
any opposition to the adoption of
the minutes from
May? See,
none. I see a lot of busy readers.
Should I give a time?
Ok, see,
none. All right. We have minutes
from May. Um And then
our agenda for
now. Our June meeting
that we're in the midst
of have a motion on
that,
please.
All right. Thank you, Representative
K second by Mino
Moya. Is there any objection
to the
agenda?
All right. Seeing none,
we have an agenda for a meeting.
>> OK.
Yeah. All
right.
Um
They've been good
collaborators.
>> So everything focuses behind
tab three in your
binder
started. So I'll give it a moment
so we can get the screen working
to project all the present. Oh, there we
go.
That.
All right, folks, whenever
you all are ready.
Good
morning.
>> Is this mic on? OK,
great.
Uh Good morning, Mr
chairman, members of the
committee uh this
morning. Uh my colleague, Tim
Bau and I'm Jessica Hathaway, both senior
policy analysts for all of
you at the LASC are
joined by colleagues from the
Legislative Finance Committee,
Doctor Saros and
Doctor John Bedes uh
to discuss attendance
and chronic
absenteeism. Uh
The structure that we have planned
for this is to have Tim and I
begin by recapping
Les CS attendance work
to date. We also have some
initial classroom level
analysis that we've been working on this
interim that we'll share with
you. We'll then turn the
time over to our LFC
colleagues to discuss an attendance
program evaluation that they have
just completed and they plan on covering
that for about 15 minutes or
so. And then we'll briefly
turn back to Les C staff
to braid all of that information
that you're hearing together
and let you know what we as les
C staff are planning to
continue to do this interim
on attendance. Um
With that, I'll be starting us
off and again, you can turn to tab
three in your binders. We're
gonna start with a slide deck that
Tim and I have prepared for you all. It's
also up here on this
screen
and we'll go ahead and get to
slide three
here.
Great. So as
you all know, the legislature has been
paying increased attention to
attendance for a while now,
particularly in the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
And this increased attention is
really reflective of the fact
that attendance is a
vital component in
ensuring the promise of New Mexico's
public education system.
Not only are we concerned about
the individual student outcomes
that are bolstered by kids
being in school. Um
But strong student attendance
also helps our classrooms
thrive. It makes the
jobs of educators easier,
more productive. It
supports the role of our schools
in genuinely preparing
students for academic and
life pursuits. And
importantly, it positively
influences broader societal
and economic well-being
that comes from a result of
well functioning education
systems.
So the legislature has been paying
attention to it for a couple of years.
But you all as a committee
as LES C,
you've been focused on attendance
for years long
before the COVID-19
pandemic when the
state passed the Attendance for
Success Act in 2019.
It was an LES C endorsed
bill that recognized
the importance of supporting school
attendance in a comprehensive
way and that moved uh
to a more data driven
approach coupled with a
statewide vision of how to
support school
attendance. Um It,
the Attendance For Success Act,
which is a pretty long
and Comprehensive Act.
Um We've included the, the key
changes on this slide here for
you. Um Some of the most
important things that you all did where
you defined chronic
absence in a consistent way
as missing 10% or more.
For any reason, whether excused or
unexcused.
Uh in the law, you all also
set up a tiered system to track
attendance and to align
interventions. Recognizing
that the reason students miss can
be varied and the specific
interventions as a result of
that will also need to match
the reasons that students are missing.
Um Third, you all required
the development of attendance plans
whenever chronic absence met
certain thresholds.
And then fourth, the law did
also set out explicit
requirements at the school
le A so school district and
charter school and also
the department level, your public
education department to support
students being in school and also
having all of the resources that they
need to get there.
As you all also know,
then the pandemic hit
and what was supposed to be
year one of implementation
of this new law turned
into year one of dealing with the global
pandemic that upended
how students attend school
where they attend school from,
what school even looked like.
And that in
schools respond to attendance
challenges nationwide.
Certainly. And then definitely in New
Mexico. But that
juncture of the law
passing at the same
time that we were dealing with
a global pandemic is
really notable for how it
impacted the implementation
of the law that was created by the
legislature. We
can move to the next slide,
please. Oh, thanks,
Tim. I thought I forgot Tim was
changing them right next to me.
Um In
stating the obvious at this point,
really, um chronic absence
is incredibly pervasive
statewide. In the
2022 to
2023 school year,
we reached a nearly 40%
chronic absence rate
statewide. Um
but there are differences for
specific student groups and
importantly for all of you, some
of the most impacted student
groups are those who are also
named in the Martinez Yazzie
lawsuit. So as you can
see on the slide here
or in your handouts, for
example, um
Native American students have a
48.3% chronic
absence rate, students, disabilities,
44.2%
English learners,
43.1%
economically disadvantaged students,
42.5%.
We highlight those again as
students in the Martinez
Yazzie lawsuit and
notably, they're all above that state
average. Moving to the
next slide, please.
So our first major work
product on this for you all
last interim then
was to wrap our arms around
the depth of attendance challenges.
In other words, get clear data
for all of you. And
then later we completed
that statutory review.
So we actually had two
hearings on attendance last
year, one in June
in Taos, where we framed the
depth of the attendance challenges. And
we were also joined by a
national expert from Future
Ed. And then another
in November 2023
where we shared with you a pretty
comprehensive report that had
three components. The
first was a, a complete
review of the Attendance For Success
Act so that you understood
how it was being implemented and
what it looked like in terms of what the
law created and what was actually
happening. The
second part was an in-depth
textual analysis of attendance
plans statewide to see
what was being done in New
Mexico schools.
And the third involved case
studies to examine attendance
practices more explicitly
and in a nuanced way and select
school districts and charter schools
around the state. At those
case study visits, we met not only
with school leaders and educators,
but with students themselves to
hear a really well-rounded
perspective of what was happening
on attendance in our
schools.
Moving to the next slide,
please.
So in the next few slides,
four of them, um we've included
some of that textual analysis.
I'm not going to go into as much
depth as we did at our November
hearing, but we wanted you to have this as
a resource again. Um
so that you can see again what
is happening in schools in terms
of what they're reporting. So
this first slide here is your
tier one. These are your
universal schoolwide
strategies that are happening
for for all students, right?
So this is where you see things like
reviewing student data,
conducting attendance campaigns,
holding attendance team
meetings. Um There's also
mentions of school culture,
universal attendance
monitoring. So
that's kind of what we're seeing for
all students as that tier
one at tier
two which is focused on
individual prevention.
That text analysis found
some similar strategies but
also greater frequency
and words that you would expect to see
like individualized prevention
determine root cause use
absenteeism data, send
letters, call home.
There was also more recognition
of attendance progress and some
celebration of student progress
too. At
tier three focused
on early intervention
that text analysis
revealed more words around
individualized student plans
again, addressing root
causes um
and beginning to get to
individual level support
that gets beyond the whole school
approaches. And
then at tier four,
this is your most intensive
support. We saw
terms that are across all of
the tiers. But this is where we also
begin to see mention of outside
agencies, social workers,
social services and
also
CYFD
again, those feel free to take a
look at those in more depth and we covered
them heavily in November. So
we're just giving you the cursory
overview.
Uh So what were our takeaways in
November? Uh In short,
we found that the Attendance For
Success Act is actually pretty
strong, it meets many
national recommendations and
it's generated a lot
of really bo robust
attendance plans
and it's helped us to begin to
collect attendance data points
to understand what's really
happening. However,
it also has its limits.
We found that that plan submission
is now just beginning to
stabilize and so
too, our data collection
practices in terms of the data
that we're getting
more importantly. However, we
also found that the entire
structure of the statutory
framework has limits.
Um as you all are
educators and folks who are in
schools and folks who worked on
education issues for a long
time. What I'm about
to say is likely not new
information but knowing
where and when
students are missing or having
a plan about how to support
attendance is truly
just a starting point.
Um Truly addressing chronic
absence requires
intense root cause
analysis and engagement with
students and families that
takes a lot more resources and
is more time intended
intensive because we know
that those attendance challenges are
complex and they're
sometimes related to school based
factors. But other times
out of school factors like poverty
or community health
um are at the root of
attendance challenges and
schools themselves, we found
in November and that November
report um are feeling
limited in their ability
to adequately complete that kind
of engagement and address
these complicated parts of students
lives. Schools
and teachers are also feeling like
they need support from all of the
adults in a student's
life to really help with
attendance. So it's getting
at the complexity and
tying all of the plans and
strategies that we're seeing into
actual
actionable policy steps
that you all can take that's going
to be crucial and that's the work
that we intend to do. Gonna
turn it over to Tim now to cover
some initial analysis we've
done.
>> Great. Thank you, Mr chair and thank
you, Jess. Um So what I
wanted to do is sort
of talk through
some of the data with you all,
some new analysis that we're
doing on the compounding
effects of
poverty and
students income status
and chronic
absenteeism and really
sort of laid a bare
what this looks like for
a teacher in a classroom.
And so if you'll
indulge me for a moment and step
into the role of a teacher
uh in a class of 20
students, right. So
this is a
very low
poverty classroom,
right? It's an organized
classroom.
Um,
the in, in
a low poverty district or, or
above average income
classroom, you
can expect that of your 20
students. About
14 of those students are going
to be proficient in
reading. Uh and
that, that is just based on their
income status
alone.
Uh About three of those
students are going to
be considered chronically
absent and it doesn't
come through here on the, on
the, the picture. But
I think maybe on your slides, you can
see of those three
students, two of them are sort of
shaded in blue. Those
two students who are
chronically absent are still
proficient in English. Uh
So those three students
who are are chronically absent,
they might be chronically absent, any
number of reasons. And this is
exactly what Jess was talking about
is that those students are
absent and require
individualized supports
not only in the classroom
to catch them up to speed with
the content. Um But
to make sure that they have their
needs met and that they
are able to
attend
class.
Um similarly,
we could look at a, the
same classroom and we can
look at it in terms of math
proficiency rates. Uh
So of those 20
students in that same uh
high income classroom or
low poverty classroom, about
11 of those students or
56% are going to be
proficient in math.
And about those three students
are still chronically absent.
But at this point, only one
of those students who's chronically
absent is proficient
in math.
Now, things really change
when you change the poverty status
of the classroom. So let's
look at uh an average
classroom in a high poverty
school district. So
the 20 students in your
school district are in your
classroom at this point.
Now, only
five of them are going to be
proficient in
reading.
And at the same time,
eight of them are going
to be chronically
absent and
they're all chronically absent for
different reasons. I
think that the important
thing to remember is that the
individualized supports that Jess is
talking about. They, they
look completely different for every
single student. And so
uh borrowing
some language from Gwen
was talking at
a staff meeting earlier this week
about the number of reasons
that students might be absent.
So if you're the teacher think
about the reasons that those
students might be absent one of them maybe
is a state champion basketball
player. Right. And that student
has NBA scouts coming
to watch them play basketball.
So they don't want to go to class
and, and in fact, are excused
from class because
they have to go play basketball
and that's where their heads at.
Maybe one of those students is
chronically ill and one
of those students, uh, you know, has
to leave class to go to the hospital
to get specialized treatment.
Uh One of those students might be
homeless, right? And
has parents that
also struggle with homelessness
and struggle with the other things that
homelessness is associated
with drug abuse or
addiction or
substance abuse of any
kind.
Um One of these students
might be a member of a Native
American tribe or Pueblo and
has uh community
events or cultural traditions
that require them to leave the
classroom. One of
these students might be cutting class
because they're not engaged
because they learned
this last year and they, they
know more than this teacher is teaching
them. And so they want to do
other things that they think is valuable.
That was me.
One of those students uh
got uh an
f on the last assignment that
they, they handed in. And so
because they got that f on that last
assignment, they feel like
they, they're not,
they're not an English kid anymore.
And so they don't like reading.
Uh they prefer to do math.
And so maybe they, they don't want
go to English class, but they'll go to their
math class. So
there, there are any number of reasons
that these students might be absent
and your job as the teacher
now is to account for that,
that those number of
reasons. Uh and to
make sure that you are providing
individualized supports for
those teacher, for those
individual students.
And you can see how
difficult that can become.
Not only that, but let's let's think
about what it means to miss content
or to miss 10% of
the school year. So there,
there are about 20 of you
if we look at members
and staff included. Now
let's assume that
40% of you are just
the staff are
absent for 10%
of this meeting. Uh
So let's say Daniel,
for example, is going to miss
all of tomorrow morning.
Your job as the teacher
now is to teach Daniel
everything that he missed
tomorrow morning.
And Merritt is going to be absent
tomorrow afternoon. So
you're gonna also have to teach Merritt
what she missed tomorrow
afternoon. So your job is to be the
content expert on
everything that
we go over at our LES
C meeting. And now you're
gonna have to fill in staff because
staff are missing the meeting.
So that
that sort of
puts into perspective, the the
types of things that teachers are
having to do to,
to really get these, these
eight kids who are missing class
up to speed and,
and it might also describe
why those eight kids who are
missing class are more
likely or less likely. I'm sorry
to be proficient.
Uh So one more
slide just looking at
data, uh
sorry, one of those kids is chronically
absent. Uh we can look
at math proficiency rates and this
is stark and this is a
statewide trend
in in high
poverty classrooms.
Only about 15%
of your class is
going to be proficient in
math or, and
uh
of those eight students who are chronically
absent, one of them
still happens to be proficient in
math.
And so you can look at this uh
these, these two
variables that we're talking
about chronic absenteeism
and economically disadvantaged
students on two different
axis here. Right. And you
can consider what that does
to students proficiency
rates. Uh And
in general, there are compounding
relationships between
poverty, chronic
absenteeism and
student proficiency
and increasing
levels of poverty decrease
student
proficiency,
which we
know.
And if you move across the bottom of this
chart where you can see
those low, those students who
are at the low, chronically
absent, uh and
low economically disadvantaged,
you've got 61% proficient
in in English
and 47%
proficient in math. And then
as you move across that axis
and increase levels of
poverty, you see
37% are
proficient in English, 27%
in math. And finally
at high poverty
classrooms, 29%
proficient in English and 21%
in math. And the same can
be seen if you move
upward, although that relationship
isn't quite as strong.
So, 61%
proficient in English drops to
51% in
English and then
46% in English
as you increase in chronic
absenteeism.
And in math, that's
47 to 36
to 29%
proficient.
And you can do that for
high disadvantaged classrooms
as well. Uh, where
29% proficient in
English, actually a weird little
uptick to 31%
proficient in English. But
then a stark
drop off to 25%
of students proficient in English
and 15% proficient in
math in, in those
high poverty, high
absenteeism
classrooms.
And so if you just look at these three
boxes that I've blown up on the screen
for you, you can see that
that poverty has a
stronger effect
than on student
achievement than chronic absenteeism
from. You lose
about half of your studentss proficient
in English and from 47%
to 21% in
math. If you just move from
low to high economically
disadvantaged status,
and you can see that if you
move from low to
high absenteeism,
about 61% proficient
in English to 46% you
lose about a third of your
students and then
47% in math.
But at the extremes
when we were just talking about those
classrooms, we were talking about sort
of the extremes of this
chart. Um
61% proficient in
English and 47% in
math in low poverty,
low absenteeism
classrooms that drops
to 25% proficient in
English and 15%
proficient in math if you're
looking only at the high
poverty, high absenteeism
classrooms.
So with that, I'm
going to sort of leave that as a
big question mark up in the air.
We will turn it to
our colleagues at LFC
to present their findings from their program
evaluation. Uh
So Dr
Jins,
>> thank you so much uh Mr
Biot. Uh
Good morning, everyone.
I'm really glad to be here
today with my, my colleague,
uh Doctor John Valdez.
And we're gonna run through our program
evaluation entitled school
attendance and performance. It
looks like this. It should be
in tab tab, it
should continue in tab three in your
binders.
Um Before we get
started, I want to thank the many people
at the public education department
and the districts who worked with us on this
report. I also want to
thank uh our uh
colleague uh
Maggie Klug,
who was an MP P fellow
for uh with
LFC and who is now our
newest evaluator. Uh
Now, if you'll please turn with
me to the summary on page
one, we'll get started with the
report
to get the benefits of school
students need to attend class.
But as Miss Hathaway
mentioned, uh from school
year 2019 to school
year 2023 the number
of students missing more than 10%
of school days grew the
most in New Mexico
compared to any other state in our
nation. Even as most
states experienced increases
in students missing school
LFC. Staff surveyed
school attendance teams and
we found that illness, parental
decisions and a lack of
interest in school were the
primary reasons for students being
chronically absent.
Yet, no matter why,
studentss are chronically absent, it can
hamper their educational success.
For example,
students who miss 10%
more school days in third
grade are between 12% and
18% less
likely to graduate high
school. While New
Mexico's attendance for
Success Act meets many
national best practices.
And then this includes having tiered
levels of intervention. Our
public education department
hasn't provided consistent
guidance on how to implement
these interventions and that leads
to inconsistent practices
in at the district
level. The state
can help local
initiatives improve attendance.
These local initiatives include
things like allowing for calendars
to be adjusted at the school level
to meet student cultural needs
as well as to require extra
school for some chronically absent
students. Now I'll turn the
presentation over to Doctor Valdez who
will uh go through our first couple of
findings.
>> Thank you, Doctor Dss.
I will be covering our background
and our chapter on chronic
absenteeism starting on
page one.
Uh National research
finds chronic absence
in early grades affects
reading and math proficiency in
the near term and high school
graduation in the longer
term. Chronic
absenteeism increased the
most in New Mexico among
states in the US after the
pandemic. On
chart one page
one, you can see that
from school year 2019
to 2023 the
state saw 119%
increase in chronic
absenteeism compared
to an average increase of
71%
nationally.
The state's chronic absenteeism
rate increased from
17.9%
to 39.2%
of students and was the second
highest of the 31 states
reporting for the school year
in 2023.
The latest available data,
the 80 day snapshot which
shows data from about halfway
through the most recent school year
is represented by the dash
line on chart one and
shows a chronic absenteeism rate
of 30.4%.
This is, this is a significant
decline from the
39.2%
at the end of the 2023 school
year, which is uh the
previous full year of
data that we have
on page five.
We discussed the 2019
attendance for Success
Act
figure one on page five
shows the timeline of
implementation as
mentioned before. The act
requires counts of both
excused and unexcused
absences and considers
a student chronically absent when
they have missed 10% of school,
which is about 17 days
in a full school year.
In addition, the act requires
most schools and districts
to submit attendance
improvement plans.
Note in chart four on
page five, we compare habitual
truancy which was the
measure of absenteeism under
the previous law
uh with chronic absenteeism,
which is the measure under the Attendance
for Success Act.
While the measures were relatively close
in 2019, they have since
diverged as
total absences, including
both excused and unexcused
have increased
in the school year. 2023
100 and 24,600
students were chronically
absent with at risk
students. Uh most likely
to be chronically
absent
on chart five. On page
six, you can see that
third graders had the best
attendance in 2019
and 2023.
Uh kindergarten and high school students
were the most absent. And this is
consistent with national
trends.
Figure two on page
seven, uh
shows the
um
regional variation of
chronic absenteeism by
school district around the state.
And this is uh
the part
of the graph that the table that we
saw before.
On page seven, we uh
further discussed the
attendance for Success Act
which did not include an
appropriation.
However, pe D and
districts spent at least
$24.8
million in fy 23
and fy 24
on school attendance
initiatives.
This included $1.4
million in Fy 24
for an attendance improvement plan
application portal.
Uh In Fy 24
PE D was appropriated
$5 million to address
student attendance and
primarily use these funds for
grants and contracted
support.
Since 2020 pe
D spent at least $9.3
million on attendance recovery
through a contractor.
However, while expenses
to that contractor
increased, the number of
students that were
served decreased
and outcome monitoring remains
minimal.
District spent $19.8
million on staff in
fy 23 with
at least 64
districts funding attendance
personnel with their operational
funds. Uh This amount
is only about 0.5%
of the $4.1
billion annual seg
or, or student uh funding
formula. Um
The figure actually paid for
an estimated 354
staff dedicated
to attendance.
Our next chapter starting
on page 10
discusses our finding that
absenteeism decreases
academic proficiency
and graduation rates in
New
Mexico.
Turning to page 10 on chart
eight, it shows that in
2023 chronically
absent students were much less
likely to show proficiency
on New Mexico's assessments
including the no mea and I
station than non chronically
absent students. The same
held true when we examined
2019 proficiency
data on the I station and Tamala
assessments
on page 11. Uh We have a
summary of the results that
um we just discussed by
Les C. So I won't
discuss those further. Uh
But on the bottom of page
11, we consider the
impact of excused
versus unexcused
absences. We
found that while unexcused
absences had a slight,
slightly larger negative
impact on proficiency,
both types of absences
were associated with lower scores
on assessments.
Turning to page
12,
we discuss our finding that
attendance is also a strong
predictor of graduation
probability. Our
analysis reproduced national
studies using New Mexico
data to show
uh that third grade attendance
from New Mexico third graders in
2012 was a significant
predictor of their eventual
graduation or not.
In 2021.
Table three on page 12
shows attendance of 2012
3rd graders and their associated
graduation rates.
Our model predicted
83% of students with
perfect attendance would graduate
compared with only 53%
of students with 80%
attendance. And so those students
with 80% attendance would be
considered chronically absent.
Uh And of course, at a much
lower graduation rate
than those with perfect
attend. Um This
analysis showed consistent
results when we looked at the same
third graders in eighth
grade. So that same group of third
graders when we examined
their attendance rates in eighth
grade, their, their eighth
grade attendance also predicted
their graduation probability with
a high degree of certainty.
Page 13 figure
three shows this relationship
graphically
across the X or
horizontal access is
the percent of days attended
and the Y or vertical
access is the chance of
graduation. The green
line shows the increasing chance
of completing high school
with higher attendance
and you can see how steep that line
is. So as you start
missing days, the chances of
graduation
decrease
continuing on page 13,
our analysis considered the
impact of absenteeism
on instructional
time to
increase instructional time. The
state needs to consider the
number of days of uh
the number of days in the school
year, the number of hours
of school per
day
and the number of student
absences in
2023 the average
New Mexico district had
167 days
on the school calendar.
But because of absences,
students on average only
attended about 100 52
days.
Analysis shows with a high
degree of certainty that the more
time a student is in the classroom,
either because they have an extended
school calendar or because
they are absent less, the
higher their scores tend to be on
state assessments. Any
effort to increase instructional
time needs to consider
attendance in addition
to both days per year and
hours per
day,
turning to page
1414
includes our analysis
of teacher
absences chart.
11 shows teacher absences
are positively correlated with
student absences. In
our sample. More teacher
absences were associated
with more student
absences. National
research also shows that
teacher absences are correlated
with test scores and
college attendance. New
Mexico does not aggregate
data uh
on a teacher
attendance. So we were actually
unable to corroborate that data.
But we were able to show that
more teacher absences
were associated with more student
absences.
Turning to the bottom of page
14. LFC
staff surveyed school attendance
personnel who report illness,
parental decisions
and lack of engagement as the
primary reasons for student
absences. In
addition, the survey
suggested that interventions
are working to reduce
absenteeism and that these
interventions should focus on
parents, student
engagement
and improved
transportation.
Figure four on page 15
shows a word cloud of
responses to our query on
actions to improve
attendance. The size of these
words indicates the frequency
of that word's usa usage
in survey
responses.
Turning to page 16
pe D and schools
need to engage parents and
ensure that families understand
the importance of attending
school
pe D is planning to launch
an attendance campaign this fall to
highlight the importance of
going to school for Children to
meet their career goals.
And with that, I will turn it over to
doctor Dins to discuss
attendance, taking practices
and the implementation of
strategies to reduce
chronic
absenteeism.
>> Thanks, Doctor Valdez. If you'll
turn with me to page 18,
we'll discuss how inconsistent
attendance taking practices
can under count student
absences.
It's important for schools and districts
to take attendance accurately for
our state to understand the
size of the attendance
problem. Some
districts have a vast majority of
schools and teachers
taking accurate attendance daily.
However, others may struggle with
this. You'll turn your attention
to figure six. This
very busy flow chart is meant
to illustrate the multi of places where
attendance taking can face
challenges. Teachers
need to take attendance.
School administrators need to
ensure teachers take accurate
attendance and districts
should be reviewing data before it is sent
to PE D. However,
when any one of these
processes breaks down attendance
data may be less accurate.
For instance, if teachers don't
take attendance, most of
our student information systems
default to showing students
attending and this can potentially
undercount the number of
absences pe
D has yet to publish formal
rule regarding attendance
taking. However, it published
guard guidance in March
of this year. While
guidance is useful in helping
ensure all districts take
attendance in a similar
way. This information was provided
more than four years after the attendance
for Success Act
passed
through information collected
at the district level and through
survey data, LFC staff
learned that some teachers do
not take attendance daily.
If you look at figure seven, this
highlights some local examples.
And if you'll turn with me to
page 19 chart
14, uh provides
information from survey respondents
showing that roughly one third of
these survey respondents said
teachers are not taking attendance
at least 95% of the
time to help
teachers take attendance. Student
information systems can automatically
notify teachers if
attendance has not been recorded.
This was a practice that we saw at a
Lovington elementary school and
it can be helpful as teachers
may occasionally forget to take attendance
if something's happening in the classroom
and uh
administrative staff may be
unable to follow up with emails.
Individually turning
to page
21.
Our state data systems are
inefficient and expensive
but collective purchasing of
student information systems and
PE D assistance could improve
our efficiency.
Currently, part of the problem with
attendance data is that there are lots of
different student information systems out
there and they need to integrate
with the public education department's
database. And beyond
that, districts frequently buy their
own stu student information
systems, issuing requests
for proposals individually
rather than collectively purchasing
these systems. If the
public education department helps
training, uh help
provide training on student information
systems as well as helped with
collective purchasing, fewer
district resources would be
needed.
Now, we'll turn to page 23
and we'll go over our last
finding
which is that strategies to reduce
absences are implemented
inconsistently
as MS Hathaway mentioned in
the Attendance for Success Act.
Uh This aligns with best
practices including
interventions that are
tiered, uh based on level
of absences as well and
specifying when to meet with
parents to build
individualized student attendance
plans. Uh
Turning to page
24 looking at table
seven, this shows how
Pe D has yet to provide
consistent guidance and rules
to direct districts.
And the result has been inconsistent
quality strategy interventions
across our districts.
Best practice,
best practice research is
available, but pe
D is not consistently providing this
information to our districts
to ensure that the use of strong
interventions. The last
column of the table
provides some examples of guidance
that the public education department could
provide.
Moving to page

adjusting school calendars
requiring extra school
and withholding credit for poor
attendance may improve,
sorry may reduce
chronic absenteeism and increase
instructional
time.
Uh Chart 15 shows
that chronic absenteeism rates for our
Native American students are
higher than for other groups.
Students from New Mexico's
tribes and Pueblos, Miss
school for cultural holidays, as
well as preparations for these
events. Many
students ser many
schools serve only one or two
tribes or Pueblos even
as their district may serve
more. And for instance,
we visited uh Bernalillo
and while the district serves
multiple tribes in Pueblos,
many schools including Santo
Domingo elementary and middle schools,
Cochi Elementary and middle schools and
Algodones Elementary
have a preponderance of students
from only one tribe or
Pueblo. Therefore,
allowing calendars to be
adjusted at the school level in certain
circumstances may promote
cultural inclusivity as
well as reduce absenteeism.
On page 26.
Extra school can
deter chronic
absenteeism and
recover lost instruction or
provide designated study
time. Uh At
Lovington, we saw uh
that they have a
relatively low chronic absenteeism
rate and they use night school.
Students are who
are referred to night school must attend
school in the evening each
week and they do not
receive a direct
instruction but they're required
to make up missed work.
Another way to increase instruction
time is through retention
or no credit to certain excessively
absent students. This
can ensure that students are
not passed to the next level without
learning needed
skills. The public
education department should clarify to
districts that they can
retain students in specific
circumstances.
Turning to page
27
the Public Education Department is not
consistently providing attendance
information and this likely leads
to inconsistent quality strategies.
Pe D is the oversight and
technical assistant entity for
districts and therefore
they can provide many different types of
support. However,
turnover of key attendance
staff positions have led to a lack
of guidance.
Many staff including the division
director, Deputy director,
Deputy secretary and the
attendance coordinator within the
safe and healthy schools bureau
changed in the last year.
The Public Education Department currently
doesn't have internal
process documents around
attendance nor does it
have documents on state goals
for attendance. But they are
working to create these
moving to page 28
districts have little public
education department provided
information regarding how interventions
shown to work should be
used and this can result
in districts doing the same
intervention in different ways.
Two examples are both
incentives and notifying
parents of student absences
while all the districts that we
visited used
incentives, some provided
large items while others
provided uh small
low-cost items. Similarly,
some districts may call
email or mail letters
to parents about student
absences when
real-time text or email has been
shown to have the most positive
impact on students.
Uh If you'll turn with me to page
two, we'll talk about some of our key
recommendations from the
report.
The legislature should
consider consider
amending the attendance for Success
Act to allow districts
to require extra instructional
time for some excessively absent
students.
The public education department
should publish rules regarding
how districts take attendance
as well as produce and publicly
post a list of best practice
interventions to improve
absenteeism. The
public education department and
districts should provide parents
with information on the impact of
attendance on their child's
academic performance
and implant and evaluate
teacher incentive programs to
determine if incentives can help increase
teacher attendance.
Finally, districts should
allow schools within
some districts to set
separate calendars to meet specific
cultural needs. Thank you so
much for your attention. I'll turn
the rest of the presentation back over to Miss
Hathaway for next
steps.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Um We'll be brief and then we'll turn
this back over to you all. We
want to thank our colleagues at the Legislative
Finance Committee for
engaging on this topic. This is
really reflective of how
important school attendance
is to everyone
um that we talked to about schools
whether that's you all as
lawmakers, but also
families, parents,
students themselves. And so
again, all of this information that
you all are receiving is reflective
of how paramount this issue
feels to everyone.
Um So breeding
all of this together, you've got an
LFC evaluation.
Um and then you have our findings
from November, which found again, we
have a pretty strong statutory
framework for how we go about
this. Um And you all
as a legislative body have also
funded some attendance
interventions at a tune of 5
million the last couple of years
around this. However,
what may be missing
from, from our findings
is that more tailored and locally
driven set of interventions
that move from communication
and plan based strategies
to more nuanced and genuine
root cause analysis that appropriately
matches interventions with
the varied reasons that
specific students are missing
if we think of Tim's
classroom and how much
complexity is really behind
why students are missing.
And so we included a section
on the necessity of an ecological
lens on attendance whenever we
discuss this in November,
and that continues to be true.
So during this interim,
what we've started doing is
completing that classroom level
analysis of attendance issues.
And then our next step is to see if
we can actually match that root
cause analysis with more
specif specific
interventions that get more deeply
a strategy shown to be
effective such as those
community partnerships or one
on one tutoring or high dosage
tutoring, developing
relationships with adults in
schools, making school
an incentivized place to be
things like that. And we recognize
that you all as a legislative
body need to have
actionable strategies on that
policy and budget front
to blend all of this
together. And so we'll be
doing some predictive analytics work
to again match interventions
with the actual tiered approach
that you all have set up and
we'll return to you later this year
with that information. And with that,
we're all happy to stand for questions.
Thank you, Mr Chairman,
>> right. So first on my list, Senator,
so >> thank you
Mr Chair. Um I'll
try not to be too scattered as
I was taking some notes.
Um All very
interesting. First, Tim, I want to
compliment you, you continue
to get better at taking
data and making it digestible
and understandable. And I, I really
appreciate that. Uh
as you were going through,
it seemed like most
of
the
that's a long bill
that uh most of
the the root
causes. I mean, you had
indicated poverty
uh being
unhoused uh
medical things
of that sort. Those are things that are
outside of the public schools.
Uh Yet the school's
achievement is
being
um affected
by that and
essentially the schools are being told
to fix that
um kind of going
forward with that a little bit I
know from CTE
the things within the school are
engagement CTE
students once they're fully
engaged in their second or third
course, they have graduation
rates of 95%. I mean, it's
well above it. They don't have
attendance problems.
How much of this is
double jeopardy. If
you're both chronically absent
and living in
poverty, what's
the, besides the main
effect of those? What's the interaction
of those
two?
>> Certainly. Uh
Mr Chair and Senator Souls
II, I think you would
appreciate the uh
the uh the
correlation between those two variables
is actually uh
0.2. It's
about 0.2 in
that those variables are,
have a moderate to,
to low correlation
between the two where it's
not just that if you
are uh
in poverty that you're more likely
to be chronically absent
um or vice versa,
that if you're more, if you're
chronically absent, that you're more likely
to be in poverty. I think
the point being that
uh once
again, it shows that
individualized
supports and
individualized and
localized
responses
to what's happening in every
single classroom is the
key to, to addressing chronic
absenteeism. Because what
works in, in a high poverty,
high absenteeism might not
work in a low poverty, high
absenteeism. Right.
And so, so I think that's, that's
sort of the point that I was trying to get
there.
I'm also dodging your question.
I didn't do, I didn't
do a specific interaction term on
that, on that relationship but, but
I think um you know, the
correlation between that shows
that there, there's relative independence
between those, those two
factors.
>> OK. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
If we looked at community
schools that tend to work
more on the social, I
think the the term you all are using
is ecological
uh framework
of, of why they're absent
are community
schools
doing better
based on what they would predict
it to be based on poverty
because of that bringing
society in
or is there no difference or
have we not looked
at?
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
Senator Souls. Uh We can
add that to our list to actually
look at some different student
outcomes related to community
school status. Um
That question is a little tied up
with the need to evaluate our
community schools more broadly, which is
on our work plans interim as
well. And so we'll certainly be looking
at all of the student
outcome,
student outcome metrics
um related to those
different school structures.
Um We do know in the national
research that that can be shown
to be effective, but it still
requires analysis
of what specifically is happening
in that community school and what
types of resources are they
providing so that we can
understand the nuance rather
than just the status as a community
school,
>> Mr Chair. And thank you. And yeah,
I mean, every community school
is different and has different focus
on it if they're
getting the same outcome. But
the poverty levels are lower in
community schools that really
they're, they're beating the regression
curve, so to
speak. Um
You might
follow
one of the things that kind of struck
me is so much of
what we're asking teachers to
do in dealing with the
attendance is
outside of
their training as teachers
and their scope of
work, but has to be done
in order to, to
be able to affect achievement, you can't
do it if the kids aren't there and therefore
they've got to become social
workers. Uh
So kind of a shameless
plug. We need to make sure we have social
workers and counselors and all the
others in school to do this
work so teachers can do
the teacher work rather than trying
to do both.
Um
Yeah, it just, it seems like so
much schools get blamed for what's
a society problem where
we're a wealthy state and allow
half of our kids to live in
poverty and then we
blame the schools because our kids
live in poverty and their achievements, not
what we would hope it to be.
And that gets a little
bit around over to ask.
Uh Doctor
Valdez,
does the LES C make
any recommendations
around how we're going to
fix the poverty problem
of our kids in school
as a mechanism to improve
achievement or just
see it as an attendance
problem.
Sorry.
>> Uh It is LFC.
Uh but
Mr chair members of the
committee, we don't currently
have a recommendation
in in this report around
uh around
addressing
poverty for
students. Although
our, our analysis does
show that poverty is
associated with chronic
absenteeism. We also note
that there are regions
of high poverty
that have low chronic
absenteeism. So we
also note that there are are
uh interventions
and strategies that schools have
implemented that have been
successful in
getting students with
high poverty into the
classroom. And we've uh
we did some focus on
looking at those interventions
and trying to highlight the
successful things that schools
themselves can do. We do
note that some elements
of poverty are outside of school
policy. But we also
note that there are are
strategies that are successful
for students who are living
in poverty.
>> Thank you. And, and I
appreciate. But I think
generally LFC
because you spend more than just
education, the
policies we put in
through where we fund
money that affects
child well being
community health, things
of those sort have very direct
effects on student
achievement that are outside
of the scope of what education is
able to do. And so I
think it's important that we
don't uh
bifurcate, you know, we
don't separate them into separate
things and only deal with one. We
have to look at the interactions
all the way through our budgets
on how we spend
money that affects Children,
whether it's in school or out of school
makes a different on student achievement.
If that makes sense
that we, we can't keep separating
those things out.
Um
I think I'll stop
there. I'm trying, I think that cover, I
blended a couple of questions
together. Thank you. Thank
you, Representative
Mia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you panel for
your
information.
As I was listening
to the correlation
between poverty
and, and chronic
absenteeism
definitely can see it. I
teach in a title one
district.
So
now it's a
vicious cycle that
being absent and low
proficiency and being absent
and the more they're absent,
the less proficient they're going to
get, the more they'll be
absent because they're lost.
Especially in a class
like mine in physics
where most of them are
intimidated anyway.
Um, and then when they're
gone for many different
reasons, I have some students that
work until one o'clock in
the morning and I, they have me for
first period. They're hardly
ever there. Those are,
that was my, one of my
seniors that he didn't
graduate because he
couldn't, he couldn't
wake up in time.
Um, those
are the kind of things
that, um,
that what do you do? How
do you, how do you like? Because I, I
would beg him if you could just
get in here, you could finish this
class and he would
not. Um, I've
also sat in a
tier one
intervention meeting
with our attendance
coaches and
you have a, a
mother in Tars
saying I have tried everything to
get him to go to class and
he will not. Uh,
so how do
you, how do you help all of
these, all of these
different,
um,
issues that
like Senator Saul
says many of them have
nothing to do with education?
Um, I have, I have
a students, I've had students
where I've offered to go and pick them
up because they don't have a
home, they hop from one
couch to the next and when
she's in my class,
she's doing well and,
but then I may not see her for a
month. So,
so it's, it's those
kind of things that, and then
of course you have students
that say, oh, I have
a free period and I was like, no, you have
my, my class. Get into class.
Thank you very much.
So you
have, you have your characters that
way. But
um
my,
uh,
I have seen an
improvement in our school
with our attendance coaches.
What did you
guys hear
any comment in your research
with, with the Le
A's on
having issues with
funding in order for,
to have those coaches because I know
for like my school
district
our, our attendance coach because
I mean, when you're talking about all the different
things, it's not a one person thing,
there's a couple of people, some that's going to
monitor um
the attendance being taken
correctly. The other one is
going to chase after these
kids and have
build that relationship and come up
with these plans. One
of my, my attendance
coach, his contract
ended at one
o'clock. So
it's very difficult to meet with
some of these parents that work
full time
before one.
Um So, and, but
that's all that the funding
that we had for that
one to, to
manage 1000
kids for that
one coach. Um
So is that something that you guys
run into? Um,
as far as
funding?
>> Excuse me? Um Thank you, Mr
Chairman Representative Minoa.
I'll speak to it from the anecdotal
side where we heard that most was
in the case studies that we completed
last year and there was a lot of
variability in where those
positions existed and didn't.
And what they're being
funded for.
So one of the items that we feel
is important for us to come
back to is to actually
help you all with. If that
were a policy consideration
that you all wanted to consider, you
all will need to understand the
cost of that and what that would look like
to implement. So that's on our
to do list this interim.
Um But we did hear again
anecdotally, some folks were
using federal funding
to fund those positions.
It's also a little bit embedded with
who's on attendance teams.
And that was a core part of the Attendance
For Success Act. So even in schools
where they maybe didn't have that position
if you had a highly functioning
attendance team and
folks who were comprehensively
looking at attendance, that
was another policy of
where we looked at
what's in the Attendance for Success
Act, but we can do
some more specific
costing out because
what those folks are being paid,
varied pretty widely
across the state and also
how much time they were contracted
for varied pretty widely based
on if you were in a very small
district, very large
one and what the caseload would
look like. So thank
you.
>> Um Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um My
uh let's see, I uh
some of your recommendations
or, or, or some of your um
things that we could possibly
do um
the withholding credit.
I, I tell my students,
uh do you know that this
is 30 years ago when I was in high
school. Um, but,
uh, that,
uh, when we were
there, if we had five,
unexcused absences, we lost
the credit
period.
It didn't matter why unexcused,
we lost it.
Um, and,
uh, they, they
all gasp, they're
like, oh my God, I would never graduate,
get to class.
Like, and, and that's
just, it, it's, it's, it's a
game for them of, for some of
them, some of them, it's not
some of them and it, it is just
that they're, they're really struggling to get
there, but many of them,
um my, my issue
is the ones that barely
pass that are chronically
absent usually aren't doing
their own work
anyway.
They're not, they're
turning in someone else's because I can
catch it. So,
um so what are they learning?
I guarantee you they're not as proficient
as, you know, they're, they're, they're
doing enough to get by.
Um
So, um
I love
um the
recommendation that school calendars
can be adjusted uh by
school. I just
attended the government to government
um uh education
Summit and
in the discussion
with the school
districts and the tribes
and um and, and nations
uh that was when I,
when I'm sitting there listening
to that whole
um discussion
and the tribes are, are,
are trying to convey the
importance of,
of, of their celebrations
and, and their calendar,
which is known,
I, I ask myself
constantly, why can't
the schools
uh automatically
give those that have
high percentages, give those
days off anyway. You know, you're
gonna have high percentages out,
why not have it work around
it instead of setting people up to
fail
and, and work with
the tribes and nations instead
of constantly against them.
It's about time we start doing
it that but
so II I am, I am
100% for,
for allowing
that kind of calendar
and that and that
um
um
I say we, we constantly talk
about local control.
That would be huge. That would be
huge for those. Because
again, a lot of
uh I think it was
um um Jessica, you
mentioned that a lot of
the people
that are being affected
in all, in the chronic absence, uh
absences are
all those that are
um encompassed in that
Martinez Yazzie um
case and,
and, and this is huge and
this isn't because they don't
want to be there. This is, this
is, this is a part of their
lifestyle.
Um And
um so I think
that is uh wonderful.
Now, one thing that I
uh a quick question,
you mentioned attendance
um alerts uh the
teacher if they weren't taken
is that on a specific
uh um basis of
that individual teacher
or did they just alert people?
Because I know my school, we
have our, our monitoring system at
1010 minutes after
it kind of goes by and says, hey, if
you haven't taken attendance, do it do.
So because that's
actually, that helps me because
sometimes immediately as soon as they get
in there, we're, we've
started.
Um So, uh so
explain that a little bit to me what you
found. >> Sure
Mr Chair representative, uh
Mayor Bebo, it uh
does it on an individual
teacher basis. So I believe it's
after uh 20 minutes
after the uh
the school day started,
uh if the teacher
has yet to submit attendance
information into their student
information system, the system
automatically emails those teachers
saying, hey, you didn't take attendance,
you need to. Uh And
so they had mentioned
that it was useful both uh the
teachers and the administrators when we spoke
to them. >> Um
Mr Chair uh
and uh doctor,
I agree
because the teachers
get uh
it gets crazy in there
and, and it's not because I don't
want to take it. I mean, uh I'd
say about 90% of the time I take
it right away, but
sometimes we get
busy because I don't have enough time.
We have to, we have to start
immediately. Um
So something just as simple
as that could help with the
accuracy of,
of uh and then 20 minutes
later, usually you have all your late
students already coming in.
Uh Believe me, I've, I've developed
strategies on to, to
remind me after
they're late and I've marked them absent
to then mark them tardy
um strategies even
just to have them sign in as they walk
in and tell me what time that they got
there. So, that way. And that's
why I tell him, I said, if you're not signed in
there then you're
absent. Like, like
I'm, I'm not gonna run after
you. Um, we're busy,
you know, we're doing stuff now.
The last thing
um
actually I think that was about
it. Oh teacher
student
correlation, teacher
absence and,
and uh and the student
absence, which
that worries me because I am
a legislature, a legislator
and I am gone
often. But uh believe
me, um
I can see how that
is because I often
hear my students,
oh, there's a sub, I'm not
going.
Um So, uh
and, and they say it, there's,
you know, and, you know,
you know, when you see more kids
wandering the halls, ok, who
has the sub? You
know? Um
So, and, and they,
they, they do do it
unfortunately.
Um That
is why uh I
think we, you know, it is
important unfortunately for
me, I have two jobs so I
have to, I have to be gone.
But thank God I try
to uh I do engineering
projects so they kind of like
that they like building things and
working with their hands. So that's my catch
to keep them in there.
Um uh And they do,
they actually do
well and require
certain things of them. But
I, I found that interesting
because it is, it is
huge and I wonder
how we can remedy that, how
we can um monitor.
I don't know if it's um
extra monitoring on
those, but
I can guarantee you
that's, that's what I hear.
Thank you. Thank you for your report. I
look forward to the next
one and hearing other
stuff. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you for the report and
um Jessica and Tim,
thank you for the classroom
analysis which shows
very all
too accurately what really
goes on in the classroom
and then what that
impacts the teacher
uh Mr Chair and, and
this is maybe towards the
LFC
mobility is a
huge
problem in our
state. Some schools
I've taught at, during my
28 years
had like
79 80%
mobility in
looking at chronic
absentee
absenteeism.
Have you cross
referenced any of the
mobility
statistics?
And, and I mentioned that because
we have students that are
going to three and four schools
a
year.
>> Uh Mr Chair members of
the committee, we appreciate that
question and it is something that we
have heard about anecdotally.
We didn't investigate it
systematically. Uh but
we heard from the Chama
school district uh before
this uh that they
saw that even though they
have lower of
chronic absenteeism
among the problems they have
are with students that are
uh quite mobile and that
is actually a risk
with some of our more
punitive approaches to
um to chronic
absenteeism uh that
if you are too punitive
students up and leave. And
so part of the in uh
innovation of the
attendance for Success Act
uh was to get away from punitive
actions to reduce
mobility uh caused
by the school. So,
um unfortunately,
we don't have systematic data
on that, but we do recognize
that it's an issue and it's something that we
can look at going forward. Thank
>> you. Thank
you.
Um
Another question I have
uh you're looking
at a panel of
basically teachers,
educators, school board
members at least
200 years of
teaching,
probably 80%
of the report we could have come up
with because
we face it,
my own experience as
a teacher and an instructional
coach. And often the
sub for the principal
is the number one thing
that got my kids in the classroom
was me calling
them. And I can't
say how many during
COVID, I spent basically
two hours a day
trying to find the
guardian and the parent
because you don't always have updated
information
because of mobility.
And then, you know, I I would
track a plumber,
father driving
his child around
in the car. I mean, that's
an extreme example,
but also many
Children today
um live with their
grandparents.
So
when uh when
uh when
Chair Romero and
myself sponsored House
Bill 130
with 60 hours of
embedded
uh professional
development at my school
as instructional coach
a couple of times a year,
we spent that 45
minutes calling
home
because that is you
need the kids to be
in class.
But the time that
teachers and
even the attendance team, but especially
teachers, the time
we spend tracking
down a
student's
responsible
adult takes
hours and hours
a week. It makes
a huge
difference. But
that means when you go
home and eat
dinner, you're spending two
hours calling parents
to talk to them.
So I, I just want to point
out that that
time we need
to have time and the duty day
to do that.
Um And that also
affects up to date
systems that the attendance
clerks are keeping up
it. You know, there's a
whole deal,
but I would say
that's the number one
way that I
get kids in school
because I am making a
relationship not
only to them but to their
family.
Another question I have
is when does the
pe D campaign start?
Because I believe teachers
are back by
August 1st
and uh students,
you know, so somebody
mentioned fall,
we no longer have
fall. It's,
it's if there's, if pe
D can talk about when that
campaign
starts because it will certainly
be
helpful.
>> Good morning, Mr chairman, members
of the committee, Representative Garrett.
Uh We are in the process already of
doing that. Uh We
have been
doing or passing out
tools, toolkits in schools and
leas stickers,
billboards, banners
uh pledges from students.
So all of that process is, is
happening now. Um
And if, if I may really quick, I'd like
to use the opportunity to,
to say that a lot of the
um the
recommendations that were
put in the LFC
program evaluation. Uh
We, the, we've
uh I've been working on them
for months now. We appreciate
the collaboration with, with
LFC, uh Our
Deputy Secretary uh
Castillo and her team.
They're very aware of the issues
they're implementing things now.
And um another
nugget that I would love to add
that, I think ties uh Mr
Chairman and Senator Souls to, to a point
you are bringing up
is that a lot of the factors
um that that influence
um attendance, they're
happening outside of, of
school. And I
was just looking at some data
at a glance uh about
the impact of community schools
in Penasco and we
are seeing some, some real great
uh improvement with that
strategy. So I'm sorry,
I kind of hijacked that
opportunity a little bit, but yes, we
are in the process of doing that
and um I appreciate
the opportunity to speak and, >> and
Mr Chair and just one follow up
question. Will you have
attendance ads on social
media, you know, your
tiktok, special
attendance popping
up on youtube,
any plan to
extend it to that?
>> Yes, Mr Chairman, Representative
Garrett. Absolutely. Social
media um is something that we're
that we are um
leveraging
and also to our
point of or this general
point of working with
um people outside of schools,
we are working with other agencies.
Like hopefully,
I don't forget any, but workforce solutions
is one of them. Uh, the
Economic development
department and
um higher education,
there might be a few others. So
we're, we're doing everything we can
inside and outside of schools.
>> Thank
you.
I have two more
quicker questions, Mr
Chair. We
have a high percentage in our state
of grandparents
raising
their grandchildren
and often they didn't
plan to be
making sure their
grandkids were in school.
I understand there's about
30,000 kids being raised
by grandparents.
Uh, some people say
30% of
grandparents are raising their kids. I
think it varies probably by
area. But
is there any effort
to reach
this group
which have suddenly been thrust
into a role that they
didn't anticipate?
Um and haven't been
responsible for having
kids in school for
perhaps, you know,
at least a decade if not
more,
>> Mr Chair Representative Garrett. Uh
to this wasn't
something that has come up in our site
visits. I am aware
of the situation in
terms of the number of
uh grandparents, raising grandchildren in
our state, but do
not have any specific information
in regards to absenteeism
in that situation. Thank
>> you. Um
And
then
>> Mr Chairman Representative Garrett,
apologies for that. Um
We, we did just want to know
one of the items that limits
our analysis of that is that it is not one of
the demographic factors that
is tracked at the statewide level.
So that is something to consider
is if we need more systematic
ways to actually capture that and have
accurate numbers, this
also relates a little bit to what
we're getting at, which is that
more nuanced in depth
root cause analysis is really
vital to understanding what they're
missing. And so we
have heard of a lot of this happening.
And for example, on one of our case
study visits last year,
there was a district really dealing with
this. And they found that the
automatic text alert systems
did not work for some of
the grandparents, raising
grandchildren who may not have mobile
devices that are compatible.
And so they needed to come up
with a different way
to engage with those families.
And so this is where that individualized
work really comes in.
Um Again, recognizing that
is much more time intensive.
And so that's where we want to get
is how can we appropriately match
interventions and understand
how that looks systematically
so that educators and schools
feel supported to do that
type of
engagement.
>> Thank you. And then my last comment
is is the transportation
issue. Uh Mr
Chair, many of our
students come by
bus often
they're farther away and
there's no public,
you know, option.
So the kids miss the
bus often there's
not a parent at home
because the parent already went to
work often an
older child. And I'm talking
older Children are sometimes sixth
graders, they're
responsible for getting
their younger siblings to
the bus. So there's
no mechanism if a
child misses
the bus to get
to school and and
that's an issue in attendance.
Thank you. Those are my
questions and
comments.
>> Thank you, Mr chairman and thank
you for your presentation
again. Thank you.
See, um
so mo mobility has been
covered. I, I
have 11 schoolss in my
district. So I see a lot of
things and I've been
substituting in my
district.
Yeah, that was, I don't know why
I did that, but it's been
interesting.
Um
One thing so since
pe D is here, I have a question for
them but as so
as I was substituting at
some schools, there are made, they even
have a substitute
because um
they can't get them the
list that a substitute
to goes to.
You could scroll for
2030 minutes looking
at all the absences. It's
amazing. And the
kids, they,
they're used to substitutes now.
So it's kind of sad.
Um But with pe
D right now as a substitute,
you um in the state you
go in, you pay
$60 to get your background
check and then
maybe two weeks later you go
to PE D and pay another $60
to get the same background check.
So I think they're
making it really difficult for
people to be substitutes.
And I just wanted to know why they're
doing that if they, I mean,
maybe something changed within
two weeks or three weeks, but
they shouldn't have to, to
get people to be substitutes. It shouldn't
be difficult because it's
getting harder and harder. And I know some
of the people who went in to be
substitutes when I went to look
at it so they couldn't
afford paying that twice.
So that's one thing I want to look
at. I'd like to look
at or explain to me why that's
why that's happening.
If you,
>> I think Director Orman also had
a
comment.
>> Uh Mr Chairman and
Representative, it seems
like if director, but I
want to make an answer. I missed the first part of
your question. So I'm sorry. And then maybe I can
add if necessary. Sure.
>> Um uh So Mr
Chairman Representative
Sarinana, the reason that
um educators
and or substitutes are required
to do two background
checks um
has to do with actually the
FBI.
Um And we've actually
gone through this a couple of different
times now FBI
a few years ago changed their
guidance. So
and said
you must have a background
check for licensure or
credential purposes
and then you must also have
a background check for employment
PURs purposes and those are two
different things and they were
very insistent on it.
Um And I
think at the time,
I remember there was some
trying to go back and
forth some support and
engagement with the Department of Public
Safety as it stands
right now. You still need two
separate background checks.
One for credentialing, one for
employment. Um
The benefit of this is
that at the very least
um because
the reason for a background
check for employment is its
own districts
can leverage
background checks within and
among each other. So you could
say be a substitute for both
Chama and Albuquerque if you so
wish.
>> Ok, thank you. Thank you.
That was just a question that was brought up
when we were, there were a
group of us there. I
think part of it also,
Mr Chairman,
when
you talk to Kelly or work with Kelly
services, they need to
really make it truthful
because they, it was like, oh, you'll
go in, you'll do this, you'll do
this and everything
is, you know, wonderful.
Well, it's not as a substitute. It's really
difficult. The difference
between a teacher and a substitute
is huge
and that's probably why they lose so
many because getting
used to what it's like
to be a substitute is tough.
I don't want to get into
that. But anyway, the next
thing, Mr Chairman,
community schools, I
have some great community schools in
my 11 schools.
One of them, the
community school group
actually, they
have, they
were doing, they were looking at
attendance and they were doing all these
studies and they were calling
parents. And these were people
outside who are part of this
group within the school,
but they took a lot of,
of the teachers,
you know, took a lot
from the teacher. So they didn't have to
do that. And it was
just great. I would like to see that with
more community schools if possible
because we need to have solid
data and they were getting solid data at
this elementary. So it was
great.
I, I don't know if that's something we can ask
the community schools to do, really step
up and help, help in getting
kids there or not. But,
but um, the,
the participants in it,
um, you
know, I taught math
and um,
and 20 would be
great but it was closer to 28
to 30 kids. And
when you have five or six
kids constantly
absent and you have these
other ones always there.
You know, as a teacher, you
have to teach everyone. So you're
always catching up
working, catching up working, trying
to get them back together.
They don't come to tutoring
usually.
Um, the parental
support's not always there,
but I wonder how much
we're hurting the ones who come every day
and when do we start looking at
where they could be if we
didn't have to keep continually
going back?
And have you
looked at
that,
>> uh, Mr Chair and
Representative Sarinana? I,
so I think
what you're pointing to and I
think represent Mira
Moya also sort of
touched on this in her comments is
that, you know, the
part of the reason
that I walked through those
in the way that I did is to
show that this is
the job of a teacher, right?
That this is, this is what a
teacher is supposed to do. But
if, if the
resources were to follow
those students who are chronically
absent or if, if the Attendance
For Success Act was to be set
up in a way where it, you
know, guarantees that an
attendance coach is available
for that teacher. Um
Suddenly that teacher
doesn't have to be making the
calls home during, you
know, or, or
be worried about that, that teacher
can start worried about that, that
teacher can start to focus on
the intervention part, going back
to cover content. Similarly,
if that teacher were provided an
interventionist, right, that
that could also be tasked with
providing that kind of catch
up work so that that teacher could
continue forward with the
curriculum. You know,
just a couple of examples
of how, you know, the the
supports that the act
is contemplating,
um you know, could be better
aligned with the resources that are
provided to the schools for
those
purposes.
Thank you, Mr >> Chairman. Thank
you,
represent
Korra.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank
you again for the
presentation. Um
I have, I don't know if I
have a lot of questions, but I have a lot of
comments. Um
I'm a math teacher
and I know that my students
don't stay in school because of
math, they stay because
of the Mariachi program.
Fine art. So
going to secondary
level, um
the students,
they need a motivation to stay.
And I work in a title one called
most of my teaching
classroom experience.
And I will
say high
poverty sure
is a, is, is a, is a
something that affects our
students. But
I wouldn't put it in a big category
like that.
Um, you try
to reach parents in the way that
we, we have in mind,
emails, text messages,
whatever. But the parents have
to work three jobs and I don't reach
them ever. They don't even
know what I'm calling them and I
have my time 8 to 4 and
after four o'clock, I don't have time to talk
to parents. So
I would be interested personally
to know what
aspects of high poverty are
affecting the students
because I again working
in the school, see a lot of
success there. II
I know it's not
exactly just the
the economic resources
is sometimes there is
a factor there and again
going to secondary level when we have
to buy in the students.
Uh One of the things that I like
Mr She last year about
the high school
graduation bill
was that flexibility
when the students can actually
choose
what, where to be,
what, what to be part of.
Um my concern and I think
we're working as in the community
is a middle school when we
the students, when we have our
students. No,
I don't think we're doing a great job on
transition them to high
school. We
don't, they are not used
to that credit part
and then they gave up.
And Representative Miramon
Moya say once they don't
know, they just don't want
to be there. Um,
one thing that I knew work
when I was in school when I was
teaching in, we have the
after school program for
tutoring. But then my
students didn't have a way to go back to
school home.
There was no money for buses.
We have, we were very creative
to get buses to the school. And
when we couldn't, we
stopped having students coming after
school. So there
are all these little
different aspects
that make a difference
and, and, and they will
help. Um Also I
think Gara
mentioned about the connection with
teachers and
we, you probably have seen
Haiti's research
that I think the impact
education the most for kids
is the connection with
teachers, but
you have substitute teachers
all the time.
That's also something that
it will never develop
that sense of belonging
and connection and,
and where the students belong there.
So
um
those are, those were my comments
that, that I want to have that input.
Um I work in a school and
I would hate to say that's the
only aspect would
be that for a
for absentees is
I think the other
areas and it's a
complex situation too.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator
Pinto.
>> Thank you, Mr chair members of the
committee and thank you for your
presentation.
Um And when they
talk about flexibility
with the school calendar,
um you know,
the, the not all
tribes Pueblos and nations are the
same and
it, it uh
I don't see where we
actually allow that flexibility
with our students when we say
unexcused and excused.
Um and it, and we're
saying we're not being punitive.
We give our work people
say you get five days off if you're
here for this many days.
But also with the school
calendar, as long
as school has been going on,
you still have not seen
where you actually see the
standard and, uh, what
they're actually gonna teach
that week. So you have to
ask your kids, what are you gonna do
today? Oh, maybe we
have a test. But when
you talk to our little ones, they're not
gonna know, um, what
they're doing that day because
they're still learning the days of the week,
even less the
months.
So I'd like to see that.
I'd like to see where
we have it published,
um, for the, you
know, for the parents to say, oh, this
is what they're covering this week.
Should they miss school?
You know, how, how intense should
it be? Because I even know what
we had testing too.
Coming off spring break.
Those calendars were not
conducive to having a
student perform at their
best, um,
coming in from a break and
having to do, uh, management
or, you know, getting the
kids back into the
grind.
But some of this, uh,
when we talk about teachers taking
attendance to the
tracking of the students
transportation. How much
do we spend on? Technology
said we put all this money in
there. But technology
too can be
a uh a
very uh can,
can help us uh
collect some of that data. We
know like Intel with
their badges, they have chips in there
and they can see where their employees
are even in the mines,
they can see where their employees
are underground. How come
we don't have that in our
schools tracking our students
where they are, what they're
doing, how much time they spend
there. Uh In
that case too, with, with the
parents, especially when we
see incidences,
the reporting of the
absenteeism
sounds like it needs to be an
independent agency
because we have some
people that are in denial
that they do have a problem
with absenteeism
and
is that really the collection
or just that they don't
want to, you know, report
it? How, how is that reporting
coming out? Um But I
see that we, we do need,
I agree we need more in-depth
data that needs to be
put in because when you say, well,
it's illness
when you talk to a little child
and you're like, you don't feel well,
well, I don't feel well because I
feel like I'm gonna get beat up at
school, you know, that's
bullying um that's
not being addressed.
So I I
applaud the report, I look
forward to the next one. I do agree
that needs to be more in depth but I hope
we can find out where we're actually,
where we can spend
some money that the
school districts
won't have to make that
decision. Maybe
we pull it from them and we spend
it statewide. Thank
you, Mr, chair members of the
committee.
>> All right. I don't have anybody else on my
list. Um,
I did have a couple of questions
though but
first, uh,
certainly I appreciate
the, um, illustration
of what it's like for a teacher.
I think you heard some giggling
amongst the panelists um,
at the 20 students.
Um, Tim, um,
that would have been awesome this year to have a
class of students. Um
That was 20 most.
Mine are 25 and above.
But, um,
you just gave and spoke
to like the complexity
of what we as teachers would deal with. I
would add one wrinkle
um, that I mentioned
to our director here
when you were presenting was
that, um,
it depends when we address
those students needs as well
that we're absent when.
Um, because certainly at the high
school level, we try to advocate
self advocacy. Um,
you know, if you do miss,
then hey, come talk to me,
I'm always open with my students
to talk about what they
may have missed, give them
whatever work we had worked
on. Um, talk
to them about it, talk them through
it, all that stuff. But our students
don't always come and say, hey Mr
Romero, I miss on Thursday because
sometimes I see my students on
Thursday, I won't see
them again till Monday,
maybe because
we have skinny
periods on Monday.
And so that's when we've also
noticed we have students that are more
absent because it's not a block schedule
day, it's shorter
periods.
Um
So, so it may be a
bit of a time lag there or
you have the students that won't come see
you and then all of a sudden, well,
on Thursday for a
block schedule, we may have
done the lesson
on, on
citations and how to
cite. And then
all of a sudden
Monday may have been
a little bit of practice. We
move on, they see it on the
test. Oh, I missed it
but it causes them to get ad on
the test they may have passed,
but that d is not good enough to
raise their grade from an f all
of a sudden it might be on the final,
they need to raise their grade. Mr
Omero, what can I do?
Um And then we find out
about what may have been missed
and that's just one student
of the 2530
students that we have
multiply that by
five and then
we have the amount of students
and the absence issues that
we are dealing with. And so
it's all different
times
um when
we're addressing what
students have missed.
And I guess that's
my question
for the LFC folks
in the recommendation.
Um And one of the things that
gained, uh I think
the headlines and the
most buzz um
from the present from the LFC
presentation was around the
recommendation of more school
for these students.
How if just
in that one case,
we have these,
this complex problem
of students, how
would more
school that these students have
already missed, be
able to make up for
specific instructional
losses
um
For
1520 students
that just be in my class that may
have missed in a
given week.
>> That's
true.
Sorry, some technological difficulties,
chair.
Um
I think that there's a lot of complexity
in what you had just brought
up and I really appreciate your point.
Uh I'll try and respond
based upon what we've seen from other
districts. Uh when
we went to,
when we went to Lovington, what
we heard there is
uh for those students who are
missing more than 10
days. I believe these were
an excuse, but it might have been all regardless
of type of absence,
they were required to go into this
night school and
they were provided work
that they needed to make up
and going. I believe one
week of night school equated
to erasing one of their
absences so that they could
continue uh
uh with where they were.
And um I believe,
I don't, I don't know all of the details,
but I believe that they were given a
packet of work basically that they had
missed. And so that might
work in a smaller district. It may not
work as well in Albuquerque or a
larger district. Uh
The other type of
school that we had heard
was uh strongly
encouraging, not,
not quite going to the step of
mandating, but strongly encouraged
students who are in middle
school to attend summer
school programs. And so
I believe that while
the summer school programs may not be able
to identify all the points
in which one student was missing, they
would have required additional
instruction. And so that would
hopefully be able to
cover a comprehensive
level. And therefore
the student would likely be able
to make up some of the
instruction that was
missed.
>> And I, and I certainly appreciate
that answer. I mean,
I honestly see it as the
very easy
answer and easy out to a
very complex problem
um because it's
hard and it will come to
one of my last questions is where do
we start drawing the line with our
students? Because we've
heard and Tim pointed
it out,
seemingly
some of our
members revealing like
their own personal policies
of how you deal with this
issue. And it real
that's
been front and center
for me as a teacher. Like where
do I start drawing this line
with students? Like we have
this, this debate
about and we had
it when we were discussing for
years, the attendance for success
act, like do we
distinguish between
an absent that my students
were doing before the end of
school that was helping
out with graduation
ceremonies
versus a student
who maybe
just ditched
versus a student that was
sick. Well, for
me, they're missing
class, they're missing
instruction for that day,
which again comes back to our
problem. When might they come
see me about it? When might I
be able to address what
they missed with them
at any given point?
Um And,
and I see this very much the
same way, like,
um,
whether we have
a separate day of
school for these
students, like, it's still
not a part of
my class and kind of
the trust that we put in our educators
to really structure
the curriculum
for their students.
Um Because for me,
um and we've heard it here
is a lot of the issues are on the
front end. How can we organize
calendars?
Like, um
we've had issues
where we've
had breaks in the
middle of the
week for whatever
reason, sometimes you have
testing those
days and so
only the juniors
have to come
for
the SAT.
And so then everybody
is like, well, we have an abbreviated
week. I can just blow off
Friday perhaps.
So, being more thoughtful about the
calendars,
um
obviously with
teachers, um
that I feel do
this anyway,
but further reinforcing the
fact that um
all the lessons are important.
Um and they're going to come
back at some point,
um whether it's in the immediate
for a grade or later down
the road when you're tested on
whatever that skill may be.
Um And
if students are obviously
missing days,
um
it's going to be a problem for
them, reaching out to
the families, of course, and having
that sort of system, I will say in the
LFC report, I
forget which page. It was
pretty
frightening
if that's the right word for
me. Um
Very scary
concerning to see
the chain
of absences in the
reporting that what
I do from my
laptop when I'm entering
attendance, um
and how it flows to
actually potentially getting those
services. And if there are
any issues
along the line,
um, we
may lose out on being able
to just contact those families
and then it becomes an issue
of the teacher solely.
Um Are you reaching out to those families?
Why or why not?
Um, um,
I know I hear from some of my
students about
if I enter attendance
incorrectly, like because I'll do
it in the first. As
soon as that final bell rings, I tend
to take attendance because to me,
like you're five seconds
late, you're five minutes
late. You need to be on
time. Um, but
I'll go back and change it when
I have time. So I'll have some
students that may have come in late. Oh, mom
and dad's upset because
you marked me absent and I was
like, yeah, because you're late, but I'll
change it. Um,
uh um,
so I can see how that might
affect
reporting and I guess
part of what I'm getting
at, um,
we've heard it
here,
complexity of the
problem. And
then how we truly go
about being
substantive in
addressing
these
issues. And again, I see
the, the more
time in school,
adding more days
into the calendar as, as
the easy way out to these
very complex problems
that are very
much education related,
obviously. But also
these problems go
way beyond the school
and into our communities
um as an
issue. But I guess I'll, I'll,
I'll sort of navigate back to that
question of where do
we start drawing the line?
Um Because they
are all sort of, we just heard all
sorts of reasons why
students um
are, are
absent and
it seems like we have a little bit of
debate on, on some
legitimacy of them.
Um Where do we start
drawing that line where an
absence is an absence
and working
with students to
get truly what
they need for out of their
education that we
owe to them. And I mean, us
as legislators, but
also us as educators
because I see my job as
an educator, as much
of a public service as
what we're doing right here in the
legislature. So where
do we start drawing that
one,
>> Mr Chair? I'll take the first stab at
that. Um
I think that that sort
of uh is a nice segue
into some of the work that Jess
and I have planned for the upcoming
uh for the rest of the interim,
the
individual nature of
why a student might
be absent for
whatever reason
demands an
individualized solution.
And that
uh
that I think has roots
in, in, in some predictive
analytics that we want to run
and some, some
building of
greater understandings about what
might be appropriate for
certain students that show certain
patterns of absences.
And so that
requires some sort of deep
modeling and, and some
figuring out like if we could
have buckets
that we could throw students into
and, and
say, with a degree of
certainty, we think this
student is
missing for these reasons.
And here are some
targeted interventions that
research has shown can
be effective for students who are
missing for these reasons.
And one of those reasons like you
might uh you have alluded
to might be that this
student is disengaging,
the student has decided they don't want
to go to school anymore.
And if that is the case.
Um There, there might be a set of
targeted interventions that we could
say because this
student is
is missing
for these reasons. These,
these are the steps that the
teacher should take. Uh
And that takes a lot of the burden of
the teachers themselves to be
designing these things
and, and making up
the or building the plane as
they fly it so to speak. Um
So that that would be my
answer to your question,
Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I,
I wish I had a
very simple answer. I appreciate
the complexity of what you're asking
because it's reflective of the
reality that we're seeing. The only
part that I'll add is we're
excited about that data work.
Um At the same
time, we
also want to recognize like part
of the Attendance For Success Act, the
heart of it is really to provide
support and to think
about ways that we're
actually supporting
educators because their primary job
is teaching and
being that person in the
classroom. Um How do
we systematically create
systems and this will be related
to some other teacher supports work
that you'll hear this week actually.
Um So that in
that system, there are actual
designs that help
enable that personalized
intervention. But we recognize
that teachers need to do
that in partnership with other
folks. Um And that can
include family that can include
community supports.
There's just a level
of um partnership
that's at the heart of the act
that I think a lot of educators
we're hearing feel like
they feel like they have to find
all of those solutions themselves.
But really connection
is vital to actually
getting at where
the act intended to take us.
And so I just want
note that um
another item that you all
have talked about are effective strategies
that are working. And we've heard that there's
not a great system
across the state to actually
highlight those. And
so even at a basic
level, um there needs to be
more sharing of effective strategies
so that schools in New Mexico know what
is context specific and might
be better leveraged here.
So that's another element of all of
that.
>> Cool. Well, thank you all so much.
We really represent
Figueroa,
>> I apologize chair, but
your line of questioning
reinforced this thought.
And I want to ask
as we continue looking at this
topic that it not all
be predictive and forward
thinking modeling but some
backward. If
the page one preliminary
data that says
our chronic
absenteeism
may be dropped
by 10%
that's huge.
And we should then
have hard New
Mexico data about
what has been affected.
So when Jessica talks
about individualized
nuanced time
intensive
responses to why
students are absent,
I want to look at that
data. Where
is the chronic
absenteeism being
reduced
and what are
those staff doing?
Because page eight
of this report says
19 of the
24 million that
districts are spending
on attendance
interventions is
on staff.
We need to know
what those staff have
done,
what they have
taken on the role to
do so that
teachers are not
and where and how
is it being effective?
We need that
information and it looks like we
might have some good information
if we can dig to it.
So that's my request
to LES C. Thank
you. >> Thank you,
Representative
Sarinana. >> Thank you Mr
Chairman, the
to finish up here
when. So
when we are freshmen come
in, that's the biggest
absentee rate and a huge
dropout rate time.
So what we need to do is
be doing this really
hitting it hard before by
eighth grade because ninth
grade when they come in and
they have all these patterns of not
coming that they just drop out.
So we don't want to lose them at that point.
That's all.
>> Thank you.
All right. So thank you all so
much. We really appreciate you
all being here and presenting
to us. Thank
you. Um
So we're gonna bring John
up. Um
we'll go through since we started
about 1520 minutes late,
we'll go through our break
and get through lunch
to
lunch.
>> Thank you.
Now
I
think I
can.
Yeah.
Ok.
Yeah,
I
Yeah.
>> Good morning Mr
Chair.
Always keeping me on my toes. I thought
we were gonna go to break. I was taking
a like
catnap. >> Sorry, I'm I'm
sorry to spoil
your catnap. Maybe for lunch, you can get
a full nap that I appreciate
>> that. Um
You know, Mr Chair, this
is uh not, not pertinent
to my, to our presentation right now. But
I just have to say that as
a, as a former high school
teacher, elementary
school principal
coordinator of a freshman
academy, I was
having a lot of flashbacks about
attendance and all
the things that we tried to do. And I just
wanted to jump in on that conversation.
I'll leave that for lunch too.
Uh But it was an interesting
conversation. Uh What I'm
gonna talk about today and, and you'll
notice that uh we have some
folks, some guests
from the Public Education
Department, they're gonna help
me speak to uh some of
the rule that were recently adopted
by the department. Um
This is behind tab
four in your
binders.
The first rule I'm gonna talk
a little bit about um
is the adoption
of
NAC 6.19
0.7 braille
standards
and you should have in your
binders first.
The rule overview that looks like
this behind
that first rule overview of
the, of the braille
rule is the rule
itself and that
looks like this. Those are,
that's the actual rule
itself. You'll notice that it does
say proposed, that's because
the, the published adopted
rule was just published
yesterday. So you've
got a, you've got a draft in case
you didn't know who I was. Now, you
do.
>> Ok.
>> So the first. So the
first I want to talk a little bit
about this rule adds
specificity to
both uh federal
and state laws requiring the
provision of braille instruction
and materials for students who
are blind or visually
impaired.
You already have a law on the
books. Uh section 22
1530
MS A 1970
1978
known as the Braille Access
Act.
And that's intended to enhance
literacy, increase, increase
braille proficiency,
improve employability for blind
and visually impaired students
and reduce the cost of acquiring
braille and other alternate
accessible format materials.
Again, this is a law that's already on
the books was enacted in
I believe
2003.
The rule
has a couple
of major components. One is
it talks about instructional
requirements. It
defines accessible
formats and accessible
tools as well as
instructional methods used to
support blind and visually impaired
students. It
speaks specifically to the
collaboration required
between teachers of
students with visual impairments
or Tsvis
and students at other education
teams and other other
educators. So think your general
education classroom
teachers.
Uh The second piece
is it talks about instructional
materials and
braille. It outlines
requirements so that blind
and visually impaired students have
the same instructional material
content as their cited
peers. It
requires folks to order
content uh
in braille or for
those tsvis
to transcribe content
area, instructional materials
into braille.
The last thing the rule does
is it um
substitutes braille
essentially in
other content standards.
So if you look through the rule,
you'll see in various
contenter standards, it
specifies where you
would um
substitute braille
content for more
traditional content for, for
students who are not blind or visually
impaired.
And the overall impact of
this rule is because
we already have federal rule,
federal regulations
in idea B
in special education law,
as well as that state statute.
I talked a little bit about
the impact is probably
relatively minimal to school
districts because most are probably doing
this already. And
so Mr Chair, if you'd like, I can
stand for questions on this rule. That's
why I have the department
here and I can go to the next one or I
can do them both at the same time.
>> Can we just go through
each of the rules and then we'll come back for
questions. I think we're absolutely
keep two things in our minds
at once. Thank
you.
>> The next rule, this is gonna be
even shorter
than the last one
is uh talking
about.
Oh, look at
that
someone didn't do their, their
editing, right? That
was me. The last
rule was actually 6.29
0.18 braille standards.
This is 0.6 0.19
0.7. Demonstration
of competencies.
This rule very short
story is a
repeal of a
current rule
that outlined how
students would demonstrate
competency for
high school
graduation.
You all passed house Bill
171 this past session,
which is the new graduation
requirements. That
bill eliminates
the requirement for demonstration of
competencies for students
beginning the for freshmen
beginning in the 2526
school year. And so the
repeal of this particular
rule aligns
with that statutory
change.
Uh you'll notice in your hand
out that there's a little bit of
historical context here about
the history of
demonstrations of
competency.
Um Under the last
administration
pe D required
students to demonstrate competency
primarily using end
of course exams.
Then there was the sequence of
events that followed if students
did not demonstrate competency
for those of you who have been teaching
high school for a while, you
probably remember, remember that
period um
starting in 2019
and, and the 2020
2021 school year
pe D actually changed its
practice so
that you didn't have an alternative.
I'm sorry, a primary demonstration
of competency and then this
list of options, it
essentially decided that
all of those options were viable.
So you could, you could demonstrate
competency by scoring proficient
on a state standardized
test. You could also
meet a cut score on your AC
T for instance, or
your A VB, the military
test. All of those were
viable options including
local demonstrations of
competency that school
districts developed
this, this repeal
of the rule essentially
eliminates all of
those things to align
with the statute, which
means at this point, as long
as,
as long as students
pass their courses,
uh and then
they graduate. Now, I
I will say that this does not
exempt students from
meeting federal testing
requirements. Students are still
required by federal
law to take
the test. But there
is no, there is no
consequence
to not scoring proficient as
far as graduation
is concerned.
So, with that Mr Chair, I'll stand for
questions. >> All right.
Thank you. I, I think the buzzing
is that's throwing folks
off. You can tell
those that have been out of the class for a
while. If it's throwing
you off, I'll just put it
out there. I
saw a hand was that, do you represent
Sarinana? Thank
you. It was, >> did
you want me? OK.
OK. So quick
question. So,
OK. So now they can
just pass the courses
with AD minus.
OK. And
then,
and then they're considered proficient
and able to graduate.
>> So Mr Chair Representative
Salana, technically,
yes, I will say.
And one thing I didn't mention in my very
quick overview is
that even under previous
uh versions
of this requirement of demonstrations
of competency,
there was this illusion
of accountability
because at one
time, there was a point where a
student, I'm a
junior, I take the
state Summit of
assessment. I don't
score proficient. There was
a, a requirement that I then had to take
it again to try
to pass it the second time.
If I didn't score
proficient the second time,
then there was this list of
options that
counselors were literally like, OK,
so now what do we do to get you to graduate?
Right? The
last option or
that a lot of counselors resorted
to, I shouldn't say a lot
that I know some resorted to
was that it was actually possible
for a student to get a letter
of admission
from an institution of higher
education as
proof that they could now
graduate high school.
So you, we have a number
of open admission uh
insti
institutions in New
Mexico. So they,
a student could go to one of those
institutions. Get a
letter that says, yeah, once you
graduate, you're in, then
they go back to their counselor
and say they let me in.
Great, you can
graduate.
That was the level of true
accountability that existed
even under the previous versions of
this. Again, the
department
opened up those options so
that it wasn't specifically
reliant on demonstrating
proficiency on the state test
to include a number of other
assessments.
And then of course, you all
passed the law that essentially
eliminated any
demonstration of competency
requirement.
>> Mr Chairman, I guess what worries
me is we were in LFC.
We were at a, in
a community that they had
11% proficiency
rate in math, but they
had like a 73%
graduation rate.
It just doesn't
make sense. It's not
logical of my head
that we could have 11%
provision and have all these
kids graduating. What are
we doing? What are we saying about our
education system when
we can do that
when,
when they, when they leave and can't
do math and leave and can't
read. What are we doing?
I, I just, that, that's what
worries me and
I just,
as a teacher, I know
I passed some with the minuses
but,
you know, I, I just, I don't
know, it's just
tough.
Sorry Brent was
commenting,
heard of
anyway. I just worry
on that. It just
seems like
we have to have a higher
level of
what we expect from our
kids and what we're teaching
our kids, we have to know that when they
leave they can read and
they can do math and they can write
as a freshman teacher and I
taught even
juniors
trying to read a word problem.
Some of them couldn't do that.
So I would break it down for them.
But it just,
it just
logically doesn't seem like
we're doing what we need to do
for our
kids.
>> Senator Pinto.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair members of the
committee. Thank you for your presentation.
I'm gonna go
into a short,
um, so I had
a student who was
going to eventually lose her
sight. Um,
and then I just saw her just this
past May and
she, uh, well, actually just
a couple of months ago, but
she's now graduating to
get her CN A had
surgery and all of that.
But I in that
too, I was like,
who was responsible for
the equipment,
um, as far as
the payment of it
because it did not seem like the school
was responsible for
it. I haven't
experienced that in the public
school system. That was more at the bie
school,
but I sent
some liability
here as far as
not meeting,
um,
as far as the students right to an
education. Thank you Mr
Chair.
>> So Mr Chair and, and,
and again, I can't speak to and Senator
Pinto, I can't speak to, to that
particular situation. I
think what we're, what the
rule addresses here and what
at least I've experienced in schools
is a student.
You know, a blinder, visually impaired
student would, would more than likely
be on an IEP
and stu and the school would be on
the hook for using special
education funds
to meet the needs and the, and
the require the requirements of
that
IEP.
>> Right. Oh, represent
me.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you John.
Uh I
have to kind
of echo
representative
Serena's
worry
because it just
seems like
especially a lot of the,
the practices that I'm,
I'm hearing about some
districts across the
state. Um
We seem to be lowering
the bar so we can get higher
graduation rates.
Um I, I
know of some districts that are
uh if, if they
have a
60%
or higher in the class,
they don't have to take a final.
Um And, and, and
that blows my mind
like it really does.
How are they, how am I
going to know that they
learned everything
when again, like I said
in my, in, in the last
segment,
sometimes in, in order for them
to, if they're not there and everything
else, it's not their work. They're turning in
anyway. And if
I catch it, I catch it, if
not, sometimes they're good
cheaters. And
I think we also
have what we're
talking about a I later on.
That's a huge
thing.
So,
is there anything do you know
of or, or maybe
pe D is there
any hope of
possibly
uh replacing this
requirement on, on, on
showing
that they've learned something
besides just
an SAT,
which many of them say
that they're not proficient. I have
issues with the SAT as,
as a, with a
lot of our demographics
here anyway. But
um is there
any hopes to, to,
to replace it later
on or we just
like lowering the
bar so we can get higher
rates, >> Mr
Chair and Representative
Miraval Moa. So, so first
I just want to clarify
or I guess maybe
reiterate that,
that the bar didn't
really exist
right there, there was no bar.
Um even though there
was, there
was an illusion of a bar
and I think there was probably
this,
maybe it was symbolic,
maybe it was supposed to be aspirational
that this is what
we want students to be able to
do is to score proficient on those
on those year and exams
um in the end
and I don't have the statistics. So I'm,
I'm, I'm probably speaking a
little too much off the cuff is
that there were probably very few
students who did not graduate
because of the demonstration of
competency requirement.
So
very few I'm getting, I'm
getting. Uh so
the other piece of this that I want that, I
guess I I'll, I'll speak to in
the work that you all have done
in, in revising
and, and the the
graduation requirements
is that you're really speaking
to um
student choice,
student options,
student engagement
and then authentic, what
does it look like to, to have
authentic measures of
learning built
into those courses because
to representative Sino's
point about if a student gets
ad minus, do they get
to graduate? Technically?
Yes. What
does it look like to have
work in that
course where you
as a teacher feel
confident that they are demonstrating
competency within the
context of the course
without having to rely on
a, on a single exam that
they take at the end of the year.
Right. And again, I can only speak
to some of my own personal
experience as an English
teacher. That,
that exam should
have been the combination for
me, of all the work
I had seen students do
all year long,
right? And I as a
teacher
assess students all year
and could, could determine whether
or not they were actually making
progress and, and
were proficient at a particular
thing. Right?
And then the other piece of it here
is, I'll say that the
graduation requirements
that you passed also
include other
options like portfolios.
They include other options
around CTE
and um
students being able to take, for
instance, career, technical
education, math,
right? A construction math,
something where they're able to tie
what they're learning in classrooms and
apply that to something that they're
interested in. And so I
think no
policy is
going to do that on its own.
It really is going to land on school
districts to, to think about
what does it look like for a student to
demonstrate competency
in a, in
an authentic way
that is not reliant on whether
or not they pass one
test at the end of the year because you
could also argue
that that one test was
maybe not a true measure
of what they could do or not do
anyway.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. And I have to agree
with you that there really
wasn't, I mean,
being high school,
especially after I
didn't get to teach high school
before COVID. All
my high school experience, I was
in elementary school
before.
So I know ever since
then and I don't know if it's changed
much after, but
after COVID, there
really wasn't
that one thing they had to
do. There really
wasn't, it was
either they had to
take a final or they had to do,
but I don't
remember one
of my seniors, I was a senior
class sponsor
freaking out about
demonstrating proficiency.
None of them did, none of
them. They
freaked out about credits.
So, but
that was about it. They weren't
worried about how am I
demonstrating that I learned something
here. Um
So um
so I, I definitely
would love to
dive a little deeper in, in, in
this because
um this now
intrigues me. Thank
you.
>> Um So John
represent Gula. Um
if if I could, I just had a question
right away along that, that train
and then we'll come to you.
Um So in the
historical context for,
for this rule, John,
um it talks about the Martinez
administration um
complete a primary
demonstration of competency by
scoring provision or better on state
assessments. What were those state assessments,
John? >> So at the
time, uh Mr Chair at
the time and I hope
I get this right. It was
primarily Park.
So juniors took Park
and and and now as I say
here, even though they're not
required to score proficient, all
students are are taking SATS
as, as juniors
>> and and these alternative.
Thank you John. Like the
alternative demonstrations of
competency.
Like
is that the some
of that was a mixture of like end of course
exams, right? If you
did some better and
and I will say for those of you
um that
that may have been part of
that during the the legislature,
there was like
I taught us history at the time
primarily and one of the end
of course exams you had
the public education department
actively crossing out
figures in
history further
narrowing the curriculum. So
like when we're talking about what
this is, it's been a bit
of a holdover, like
you mentioned John like
was a bar
sort of or
not utilized
but also like
what sort of bar
did we have? We had
Park as an assessment
but then we had and of course
exams as this
alternative demonstration
that was also like
super narrow in
context and, and
scope um
that was highly
problematic and highly
controversial um
at the time at the legislature.
So I think that's a little bit of
context that like
why
in House Bill
171 we
got rid of that language. And then
here with the rule is to
actually, I think in this case, actually
align what was in 171
with, with the rule
um as as
that step. But I think that's like a
crucial piece of context.
We had Park and then some of these end of course
exams and oh, weren't
much of a bar anyway
for students but represent
Gura,
>> thank you, Mr, you basically
have a question that I was gonna ask
about what type of standardized
test. Um
But I have a set
up question too.
Um I always feel
like when we rely on,
on a standardized test is
that because we don't believe
in what the teachers are doing
in, in the course. So if
my student is
showing proficiency in what
I put
in my scores,
it should demonstrate proficiency in
the standardized test.
I don't know. That's, um,
it, it seems like
it should be some kind of
work together there.
Um, but
I also have seen
teachers who
they have a
different
b philosophy of how
to graduate, how to, uh,
grade grade students
having different. Do we, do
you have any,
is any point of reference
on that sense? How teachers
uh input their
grades or, or,
or, or so
attendance will be
great for a teacher, for instance,
for other teachers won't be
attendance, homework will
be heavy for some teachers.
And, and that's how demonstrate
proficiency in the classroom. And
probably that's where the discrepancy
comes when we
compare to standardized tests is
any point of reference from
teachers
ways to evaluate and
demonstrate knowledge in the
classroom that we can
reference to. I
don't know if
>> I,
so I I Mr
Chair and, and Representative
Gorila, I think
if we asked everybody
in the room, they'd have a different answer for
that. I mean, literally,
we have a lot of secondary
teachers and I would be curious
at lunch to run this exercise
so that you all can talk about how you
graded students and how
much and not only graded
but waited, right?
Because because some
students wait the
final exam a 60%
of a grade, whereas someone else says I'm
gonna wait that at 25%.
Right. Uh, some
school districts have
specific requirements
for your teachers
and that as a teacher, you're like,
ok, well, how do I make this test
fit the requirements of the district?
But also know what
I know kids are knowing all of that
stuff. Right. So, I don't, I would
say that there's probably not
one, one
thing we can point to as
to how teachers
grade, um
nor, nor is there
something to point to as to how
teachers determine whether or
not students
know stuff, which I think is an
important
distinction,
right? That a grade doesn't
always denote knowledge
or vice versa.
And so again, getting to
this, this idea of, of
rigorous instruction,
individualized
instruction,
genuine uh
demonstrations
of, and I wouldn't
even call it competency
necessarily, but genuine
demonstrations
of
skills and
knowledge, right?
Is at the heart of a lot of these
conversations. And
I would even go, we're, we're,
we're getting way off topic, Mr Chair.
I'm sorry, is,
is I, I would even go to the
national conversation
around um
the Carnegie Unit.
And whether or not passing
a class
that you sit in for 15
minutes, 100 and
80 hours a day
actually means that you
learned the content of that
particular course.
And, and you see a lot of
schools going to more
innovative models of
how you, how you schedule
your day how students
interact with material
and whether or not they're
demonstrating competency in a
more genuine and, and sort
of relevant way to
them rather than sitting
in a classroom for 15 minutes
doing the assignments that a teacher
gives you regardless of the rigor of those
assignments. And then at the end of
the year they say you did it,
you get to graduate. So,
I, I think that's a, that's an ongoing
conversation that's happening
not just in New Mexico.
>> Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. I, I guess
that was my point. Exactly.
So we should have that point
of references of teachers
that uh that's why we need a
standardized test because
everybody evaluates differently.
But also I have a
students who
they knew everything
they, I knew, I talked to them,
they explained their thoughts,
but they couldn't do a standardized
test or
even on in the moment I
remember this girl, I sat with her
for two years in front of me.
She had to explain every step of the
way her work because
her way of thinking was
so different that
she was not being able to
process it on a test,
but she knew her content.
She was pretty actually advanced
for her, for her age.
So, yes, thank you. Thank you
for pointing out about the different
ways of demonstrating knowledge.
Um And one of the things that I love
about the bilingual seal
is that's how,
how they do it, it come
up in with a portfolio
with class work with a
presentation with
a set of judges
showing, uh,
showing that. Thank
you,
>> uh, Senator
>> Breck.
Thank you, Mr Chair. And, and I
just, you know, more of a comment,
I guess than a question. But,
you know, I'm, I'm kind of
was listening to
Representative Sarinana and,
and, you know, one of the things
we're supposed to be doing is
getting our students college and
career ready.
And the problem is
if we're graduating students
with a thir you have
a, only 13%
of them are proficient in math and only
26% of them or whatever
the number is or proficient
education,
they're not college or
career ready.
And when I hear from employers
that are like, I can't hire
some of these students because their
diploma means nothing
because they haven't, they
don't know how to read used to
be if you had a high
school diploma
that I could be, I could hire
someone, say you've got a high school
diploma. I know you can read and I know you
can do math. That's not
the case anymore. And it's not
just in New Mexico. I mean, our
numbers are the
worst, but that's
not just in New Mexico where
we're having, you know,
high school diplomas mean absolutely
nothing. And I think that's where my
concern comes in
is that colleges
are I
ok? You have a high school
diploma. But you can't,
you know, your, your SAT scores
are horrible.
And so for a while they got
rid of doing the sats. Well,
now they're coming back
because the
college is like, we, we,
we can't have any faith. We have no
faith in high school
diplomas. And that's
where my concern comes at is,
is if we're gonna be graduating
students who can't read,
they can't do
math.
What, what have we done for
12 years with those
students?
It seems like we're wasting their
time, wasting our time and
wasting the state's money.
And that, that's where my
concern comes in and, and it
seems like we, we, we're gonna have to
figure some of this stuff
out.
Um,
because at, at this point
right now,
we're just wasting everyone's
time and money.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Anybody else?
All right.
Thank you all so much. We really
appreciate your
presentation. All
right. So we
will go to lunch
folks.
Well, we'll see if it's ready.
Um, and if it
is fine, if not, you'll have to
wait, um,
that 10 minutes or so,
but we will come back.
We're slated, we're,
we're really early
1215, um
slated lunch. We'll come back
at 115
to continue
our afternoon, but we'll see
you at 115
folks. Thank you.
