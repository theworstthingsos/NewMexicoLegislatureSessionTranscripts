members of the legislature are
not only in Santa Fe but in the

Mr speaker and and gentleman
that is the crux of the problem

on this very subject that they

all I can tell you both the

that is not what we believe

And as all of you know.
You know the the.
It has to come from influence.
An influx
Mr speaker and gentleman comes
When they have the opportunity.
To watch us whether it's remote
or in our in our chambers.
That
That we we remember that and we
think about it.
for that reason
And as you bring that in and
forward if I could it would be
very helpful for the
website so there's others please
go ahead and bring him up and we
can get them basically I pre
loaded to go on the website.
This amendment pretty
straightforward.
this amendment would allow.
That.
Bills that would be heard.
Or speakers table would be
considered for third reading.
The rules would not apply to the
last eight days when we get into
Not only for each others but
for.
Of the public at large it gives
them adequate notice main those
only be a logical.
The especially under this under
these rules and these times
quite frankly I think it ought
to be done at all times.
And that in committees.
Under.
people that want to participate
in the committee that they would
be afforded notice that's all
it's about this.
You get a chance to be prepared.
That's all assess of bigger of a
stamp question.
Jennifer Berlina Santa this is a
speaker and gentleman from our

I'd be happy to.
Document different from what we
normally do in terms the last
statement you made is that

We are given notice in the
golden rod.

Mr speaker and gentle lady
It is very different and it is
the fact that what's on this
golden rod.
That.
clarity to the public.
Or to anyone in this body except
maybe the majority.
Of what bills are going to be
heard.
And we can be prepared I think
you would see that this floor
session would be expedited.
And there would be a lot more
unity if we could be prepared
what the next bill is this Mr
speaker and and Mr leader
can you recall from the not not
from number one to number twenty
on number one to number fifteen

It has to start with a little

And
I am adamant.
I'm aware of that I've ever been
involved in.
The notice was not.
A significant portion.
to heal a lot of of what ails
us.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
chairman.
This for the gentlelady from
Bernalillo representative
Thompson.
I'd be happy to act I could not
hear I'm sorry.
to predict which built Mr
speaker are going to take what
amount of time I mean I have
been in that chamber we're a
bill was simple it was non
controversial it should have
waste let's say that the
speakers that's okay we're gonna
do these ten bill today and it
turns out that they each take
ten minutes and we're done in in
the consumer and public affairs
committee.
Which meets Tuesday and Thursday
afternoon.
So let's think tomorrow during a
floor session a bill gets
referred to my committee at two
PM.
that bill will then be put off
for an entire week that bill
will not be heard until the
following Tuesday I have just
almost doomed that bill to
for it let's let's put
everything out as much in
advance that's not the reality
that we live in can you talk a
little bit about how you're
going to fix those kind of
issues.
Our job is not easy and the
chairman's job.
It's certainly not easy.
But our responsibility to be
public at large that's why I
mean that's why our approval
rating as a body.
And of the US Congress is so
pitiful.
Is because we are not
transparent.
Being transparent and being
ethical.
Takes time it takes effort.
When your constituents look at
you or my constituents look at
me.
They want us to be above board.
for me but I never want those to
not vote for me because I didn't
tell him the truth and I didn't
tell on in time for them to
react.
And what the honest I'm gonna
have a town hall.
Nobody's there for only four
five people are there
and and all the other people
Appears.
An opportunity to help us.
Move good legislation forward
and make it better for our state
understand where you're coming
from as the chair but it needs
to be done.
Mr speaker and gentleman I don't
believe you ask answered my
that they will all get through
and we won't waste a minute of
time.
For example a gentle lady Mr
speaker you put ten or fifteen
One of my representatives that
pop the long.
But he can start the next day
and say when we left for all
we're going to pick those up and
we're going to get a more we
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
not about fairness the rules are
the same regardless of which
side of the aisle you sit on it
I just like I said if we had
we've are we're we're already on
day number what six or seven I
can't even remember let's say
I'm in it doesn't make sense
it's it's it's optimal no is it
were working under so we can't
put enrolled Mr speaker and
gentleman that act like those
are not constraints on.
that every member in this body.
Representative about thirty
thirty one thousand people and
every one of those people
deserves an opportunity to be
There is.
It should be about fairness and
and I don't mean that
that we are in every instance
straightforward honest
transparent and we go above.
be involved.
Mr speaker and gentleman I keep
hearing this and it is yeah I
must admit it bugs me that the
public is not involved no we
our offices three four times a
day three four times a week but
we might have somebody who
doesn't have the money and that
can't get off of their job at
the local convenience store who
leave it at that but I do not
want to see us sitting around
when we have sixty days sixty
days period end of story thank
around twiddling our thumbs
though the bills are stacking up
because we didn't have enough
time our constituents expect us
to do the work of the state is
it optimal to do it in thirty
account the clock hasn't started
yet now the clock starts sorry
we don't we don't have time to
get this to committee I will
vote against the budget
These are for the debate.
Gentlelady from patrons and I'm
Representative Townsend do you
know the average of how many
bills are typically introduced
in the sixty day session on the
house side.
Mmhm I'm gonna say twelve to
fourteen hundred thank you Mr
members that reduces the number
bills will here to three hundred
and fifty is that correct Mr
speaker Representative Townsend
that is correct it also on point
rural representatives in rural
areas who will be able to bring
issues from the rural areas if
there are built specific to that
because the majority of the
representatives are in in
metropolitan areas but but my
time to vet bills or to allow
bills to be thoroughly heard and
so do you believe that by
reducing the number of bills by
that'll do is there's a lot of
times when we hear a bill coming
up for the first time.
We realized that bill needs an
amendment and so.
coming up would have been
amendment ready in you'd have
amendment quicker anyone have
all the delay.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and thank you Representative
saying we're doing this is about
transparency of the government
that's what we say we're doing
but yet you know other states
have found a way to vet bills
make it happen even part time
legislators and this is
being able to participate that
live far away and would normally
travel but I'm already getting
phone calls and emails from
constituents and business owners
and folks who tried to call in
discussion on the bill in favor
in fifteen minutes a post I
looked at how many members are
on that committee there are nine
it has to referrals the second
never been heard.
In a committee before in a
session will be vetted by
sixteen members if they limit
the debate the second that they
limited in the first less than
Mr speaker Representative
Townsend you believe that the
twenty four hour notice just so
people can read.
Well
provided.
Body is so.
Bill.
New Mexico that has a lower
approval rating than the
legislative body do you know
what that industry is.
I'm trying to guess Mr speaker
in New Mexico and you know I I'm
I'm getting.
When you're in the minority and
you're being told not to divide
not to speak diversifying and
this body to consider the fact
that forty eight percent of New
Mexicans voted for conservative
candidates.
But due to gerrymandering and
redistricting re also ranked
percent of New Mexicans voted
conservatively and this year
redistricting is one of the bill
that's going to be up it needs
to be vetted and it needs to
have a bipartisan input and the
public needs to be able to let
change that could have limited
to no debate.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I I
appreciate that and I I would
say is that I think that is at
poverty I mean the list goes on
and on and on and also I want.
Is to get better legislation out
here to have constituent input
that puts this body ahead of
anyone else I just want.
Notice so that we can be
prepared we can streamline the
Others further debate the gentle

Maestas.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Travis yield.
I'd be happy on to my friend.
comments I I I understand your.
Your frustration I and I.
Get a feel for coming from but I
stand opposed to your amendment
that if we don't support your
amendment some our unethical
that in and of itself Mr leader
Mr speaker is getting really
close to the line of questioning
John from jobs but when a bill
passes the committee there's
minority members in the room.
They can grab a pencil and a
piece of paper and write it
down.
And then maybe the minority
office can create a list I don't
know.
But you're you're you're but the
folks listen to this to this
webcast think that the majority
be call toll someone comes as a
more pure built a you know
you're built up third and I grab
my notebook I get ready.
I would just suggest that you
There's nothing non transparent
about about what we do bills
asking me these bills are read
out on the floor on two other
office and saying Hey can you
give me a list of the bill that
just got read out on to the
floor.
And then you prepare in addition
Mr speaker Mr leader gentleman
you guys too well but I would
try that and now we because this
this whole notion of unfairness
unethical activity I don't
appreciate it all Mr speaker Mr
you know as well as I do that
Pushing and drying change into
And beyond anyone this morning
including yourself on you know
me better and that I wouldn't do
it and but I will stand here and
argue with the on air on
it's transparent and I don't
think that anybody should have
to wait in order to hear what's
coming next so if we argue on
that we are use France.
Thank you Mr speaker and this is

Unfortunately for you is going
to get more confusing but
that's absolutely true

body was get.

quicker process.
Thank you Mr later I appreciate
that the explanation I was just

morning and I I don't know but
will continue to to work for you
Appeal so Mister speaker and
gentleman from the rules
committee meeting the other day
I was told that essentially a
bill could be read out of the
that correct Mr speaker German
that is absolutely correct and
that's one of the things I'm
trying to prevent so Mister
speaker and gentleman on the
were brought forward five of
them we knew we went to have
them prepared and drawn up but
is Legislative Council services
many of them working remotely
Right Mr speaker and gentleman I
I think this issue is going to
cause us all to slow down I
think more structure is going to
gentleman of what I hold my hand
right here is a hand written
form for floor amendment do you
believe Mr speaker and gentleman
instead of having professionally
Council services these hand

the timeliness and requirement

require a twenty four hour

Okay we are now back to the
sponsor the general in Santa
Rosa you like user there is for
the debate the general fund
Chavis and Lincoln
Mister speaker the kind
gentleman started off of with a
friendly amendment and I a
agreed to not to prolong this
any further so I think we struck
amendment number two to house
resolution number one as twice
amended.
The two oh two number is two one
It has the gentleman to.
Explaining that.
Mister speaker the
followed them this rule limited
to to basically to members on
the minority side and if I
counted right three members on
select one other individual who
can interpose a point of order
or bring your attention for
points of order that would then
minority within the minority
floor leader are absent from the
chambers or unavailable and we
would be left without the
ability to make a point of order
so I appreciate your
In this online so if there's no
debate we can simply adopted
which would.
If I think you do.
To house resolution one as
amended is adopted German yeah
you have the floor still thank
you Mr speaker I am finished.
Gentleman from Santa and
Bernalillo high yield.
Mister speaker I will yield to
the gentleman.
Mr speaker thank you John.
A point where all vaccinated we
can have this place open to the
public until this I really wish
that was the circumstance were
meeting in.
And Mister chairman I know I
don't know about you I'm sure
you have as well I've been on
hundreds of zoom meetings.
over this last year.
present have been really
challenging.
Up for me was leading that
meeting and and talking with
people who are remote not the
really feel like you're left
out.
meetings that I have are either
all in person or on zoom.
and so I I understand.
Why
for the conversation and I
brought up something I just I
would just like to the to ask
this question again and if
you're willing to share your
morning have the committee
report
not adopted but to work whatever
that verges accepted in a
limited for session to be added
And then goes to the floor the
next day because the twenty four
hour rule Mr chairman I believe
the answer is yes but could you
explain to me again what you
there is not going to be a
situation where the bill is
currently in committee in the
morning and one committee say
state government comes to the
won't happen is because frankly
the analysts if I sit on
Judiciary state government the
Alice would be at an operator
because I won't have time to
the bill for the benefit of the
members and so my discussion
with you last I was that will
not happen and if it does happen
I want to hear about but I I am
heard in the borders they are
referred to the committee and
also in the orders that they are
right now to the committee to
the to the floor and so for to
keep that rules I would also be
the bottom of that list so miss
speaker and a challenge you want
to comment on that.
Mr speaker John I I don't want
there to be this for the past
period of time yes a practical
matter there's going to be at
least a day before it's going to
be heard in the next committee
image is going to take that much
time just to analyze the bill
and you know if that doesn't
and that was a an agreement so
we worked on together and I know
since that time I've I've had
great interactions with my
teachers and we'll talk together
cage we heard this bill out
I would say then of the the
agreement is is we're trying to
build trust.
Is that if there is a situation
where something flies through
what's that that we talk.
You Mr speaker and gentleman I I
making clear about I do
appreciate.
That the philosophy behind all
of this is what we're going to
fight on lots of issues that are
all trying to do is in effect to
be on the same page and that's
what I it leases chair rules I'm
trying to do with it members of
the body as well as staff and
Was doing an event for sure it's
San Juan Representative lane.
Thank you Mr speaker you are
correct it is San Juan County
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen I'm confident Mr
speaker gonna have two in a row
and the friendly amendment
Department.
R. Lee some hopeful anyways this
is this amendment rather
time the members either in a
floor debate or in a committee
hearing and there were some some
opposition voices that which I
think is understandable one
member said they they had to use
the restroom or you have
accustomed to that as we've had
several zoom meetings as well so
all this this amendment seeks to
do is at the time of bloating we
normal for session whenever it
would be time to vote.
We can all look across the
plexiglass and see the person
pushing and see who is actually
that they're voting safely and I
think that gives the public that
vote of confidence as well so
with that Mr speaker I would I
Intel and has movie no would you
please tell us the two oh two
number for the amendment thank
you Mr speaker Mr speaker.
The to a two number is point two
is this a friendly amendment Mr
speaker sadly it is not I hate
to disappoint the brand new
member from San Juan County but
for that so we're going to skip
the sea of education in the.
The man that is on the website.
everyone is in you know has a
camera turned on and we don't
have a screen is big enough to
do that because we're gonna be
voting in over in the back to
thirty second voting.
is enforceable.
for me to verify that all the
cameras are turned on for the
year for the period of voting
for the back and forth through
gentle on my neighbor to the
next house district in San Juan
County next to me yield.
Mr speaker I gladly yield.
or not proxy voting was
allowed in the constitution for
help for a legislators would
your amendment.
taking place sense the person as
they were voting would be
visible on the screen is that
that's the purpose of your
amendment but from the
standpoint of the constitution
would that be what would be
confirmation of who the person
is actually casting the vote.
Thank you Mr speaker German just
for that sake I will be voting
for you the first amendment you
And Mister speaker I would cross
the roll call then please you

me I'm.
As we do with house rules I'm
also trying to do understand
house rules as we go.
That have been limited on what

peripheries and please forgive
me for paraphrasing.
Government does not change
without the citizen speaking but
yet.
we are in a position where the
citizens are not speaking.
You know I'm gonna leave that
alone
the last topic that I wanted to
bring up was to change to house
rules.
Seven dash eight.
motion for to report shall
address the speaker and shall
not proceed until further
recognized by him.
To change the proposed.
Explain to me Sir
How we have this discussion
we're.
The speaker.
On the floor at the same time
and accomplish that in.
A bit confused and and to
forgive me for being that way
Thank you are you but.
Mr speaker personal gentleman
for me welcome to the chamber
and I appreciate the questions
doing.
We're not trying to change the
rules as they existed before for
purposes of adding or detracting
from for example what committee
touching that either way.
On the same way with the floor
we are changing the mechanism by
which the debate occurs so what
the gentleman understand that's
the context in which we're
except for the fact that we're
in this pandemic and so we have
to be working on a virtual in a
in a virtual way as I see it so
Mr speaker gentleman I will tell
you that from my perspective
that was a vigorous debate both
sides the public at the various
they got to hear about the pros
and cons of house bill four and
control the Democrats control
how they want within reason to
allow for a full debating the
issues before the so the public
for example from Judiciary they
were excellent that will lead I
think to further improvements in
the bill even before it gets the
judiciary which is the next
committee will be further
just so that for those of you.
At home.
Then I have in front of the
money let me pull that up I just
had in front of me.
Nine is that correct.
Mr speaker John.
Mr later a gentleman from
referring to based on line seven
through fifteen a member and
then this is the added language
of the speaker majority or
minority for review that's the
the speaker and we add this
language Sheldon so by the
electronic or telephonic means
the presiding officers had
directed members to use so the
is we have
it may not just be the speaker.
It maybe whoever is running for
example even the committee
process that they have to be
then calls on them by
recognizing them and they either
yield or whatever is happening
on the floor so none of that
changes in terms the rights of
members what we are saying is is
people on on equal footing and
for trying to do is every member
now has to work using the
computer the telephone some kind
of digital electronic means
rather than the microphone
participating in the debate and
I hope Mr speaker gentleman that
answered your question it is a
good question and I appreciate
it.
The necessity of the house
meeting.
Completely virtually within less
than a couple hundred feet down
Mr speaker gentleman
the the first short an obvious
answer is is that they have less
sent to I think from what we've
seen in Los Alamos national
laboratory's modeling that is
dangerous for us to be on this
with masks on what what's
happened today and it's not I'm
not suggesting it's delivered
but this is what was Alamos
National Laboratory report
talked about with the
requirement to wear masks.
happens in human nature it's not
casting aspersions on anyone but
once they do that that virus is
in the air this is an airborne
Boria space but it's also a
basement.
With no outside air the H. fax
system is old you're all
exposing ourselves to virus for
the Senate if somebody gets sick
if somebody's seriously in sick
the Senate might reconsider we
hope and frankly pray that that
wouldn't be weeks we're talking
about fifteen minutes this virus
people can be exposed to we're
exposed reach other for weeks at
go see them when we drive home
and visit with them then I give
the example my wife had lung
cancer a year ago December have
part of a long term she's a real
add is when Los Alamos national
laboratories was doing their
study nobody knew anything about
the variant nobody knew what was
coming from we this presume
does is on the Senator but we
have the house and we have been
proud to be the house and make
our own decisions and beat them
in basketball I just had to
throw that in thank you very
floor that is not correct the
Sierra to rule that allows any
senator at any time to
participate fully in debate from
