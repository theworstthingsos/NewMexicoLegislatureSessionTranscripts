Again. Welcome back. And our first
uh item this afternoon
is entitled building a
National high-speed rail
Network and and
related infrastructure.
First speaker is
Rick
Harnish,
Executive director of the High speed
Railway. Uh Go ahead,
Mr.
Garnish.
>> Hello. Um
Thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman for inviting
me to speak today.
Uh The high-speed Rail
Alliance is a
member, supported
nonprofit. Um
We're located in
Chicago
um and we're advocating
for a national network,
an integrated network that
combines uh
new high speed lines
where trains are going over
100 and 55 miles an
hour. Uh That's
probably about 20% of
the network.
Uh A lot
of shared use lines
connecting cities,
big and small throughout the
country. And
then uh we believe that
there should be a strong inner city
bus uh component of
that. So it makes
it possible for lots of different
types of trips to happen between
lots of different
places
um throughout the
day as to
opposed to our, you know, the
Amtrak service that exists
in New Mexico today
where one line is
just once a day and the
other is just
um three
times a week.
Um So I can give
it a short,
um,
um
I, I
apologize, I see
what I did right here.
Ok.
So a short little background
on what, what high speed rail
is, um
what needs to make it
happen uh
across the country.
Um And unfortunately, I, I
apologize, I don't know much
about the specific New
Mexico examples.
Um but in terms of the
process, it's, it's
the same. So,
uh the first high speed
line opened 60 years
ago in Japan
um linking
uh Tokyo and
Osaka.
Um And
that was, you know,
very, lots of skepticism
about whether it would work or
not. Uh Depending
upon which historic record you
read, they either started
100 and 25 miles
an hour or 100 and
35.
Um And
currently the fastest trains in
Japan are going
um about
a above 200 miles an
hour and it's about
the distance. Now, the length
of their line is about the distance
from Denver
to El
Paso.
Uh trains in general
are a really great, great
way to travel and we
believe that everybody should have
the option of traveling by train
or bus um
to one degree or
another. Um
And what happens
if you have trains is
that people travel more
often, they have
more money to spend
on productive things like
buying ice cream at your local
shop. Um
Your local
uh cities don't have to spend
as much money on, on
providing parking or
infrastructure, other
infrastructure, cars,
and it allows to bring our communities
closer together
physically
and um
emotionally.
Uh because
without having to have
room to store your car, you can
now create walkable
places where people bump into
each other on
a regular basis. So
high speed, because
if you cut the drive time
in half, there's
a massive shift
from driving
um in air
to train and then
that catalyzes
other things
like better local transit,
better walk ability, etcetera.
So it's part of a broader
system.
Uh It seems
like high speed rail is very
expensive because it
stands on its own.
Each project is considered
independently
and it's not done
in comparison to what we
did with the interstate highways
very frequently.
And at the federal level,
um highway
money is just automatic.
You just, every State
gets a, a slice of
the federal money that
you can spend as you choose
within certain parameters.
Um You're not.
And so therefore
highway
developers, the
plannings at at the Department
of Transportation just assume
that the highway will always
grow and so they
continue to build bigger
highways.
Um But
in actuality, the infrastructure
is less expensive to build
the new highway infrastructure.
And one clearcut
example is
Portland,
Seattle,
Vancouver,
where the State of Washington
again, because it's a stand-alone
project, it looks expensive
at 42 billion,
but just adding two
lanes to I
five would be
over 100 billion. So more
than twice the cost,
but you get 10 times more
capacity with the high speed
line. And again,
you're cutting the
trip time in half,
which makes a huge difference
in the way people interact and the
way city, city
economies get tied
together.
Um So, you
know, we need to have
one in order to prove
the case. Um
worldwide, that was
Japan in
1964.
Um in Europe,
that was Paris to Leon
in 1982.
In Spain, it was Madrid
to Seville in 1993.
Each of those created
a revolution in their railway
and transit systems
um across the
country. And
we believe that if we have one
of those here
um in the US
that that will
um let
people see what this really is
about and you don't have to have
a passport
um and fly in a
cramped airplane and seat
for for many hours in
order to go experience
it. So we're very
excited about Bright
Line West,
which
is under construction
connecting Las
Vegas to
uh Rancho Cucamonga.
That's the first phase
uh will be the first phase to
open of a
system that will link Las
Vegas
to San
Francisco to
L A, etcetera
with California building.
Um a key part of that network
in the central valley
and they already have
the environmental clearance. They
need to get
uh through the mountains
from the central valley
into the Silicon Valley and
into the L A basin.
So a very
aggressive target that they
have uh
for having trains
running by the 2028
Olympics.
Um I believe
uh that they believe that they
can do it. I think it's
possible. Um,
if they're a couple of years late,
it will still be within this
decade. Um And
that will be exciting because
Americans can see
what high speed trains are like.
Bright line Florida, which is
not high speed, which is what we would
call regional is
already having that impact
because Americans are flying
to Orlando from all
around the country and riding the
train and saying, why
can't I have this at
home and they should be
able to have it at
home.
So uh railroads are
very versatile,
you can do different things with
them based on
what assets you already
have. Maybe the
asset you have is a long
stretch of flat
open land where you can build a new
super high-speed railway
or maybe the asset is
that you've got a piece
of railroad infrastructure
that's, that's not very
well used uh
that can be rebuilt
more quickly.
Um And maybe not go
as fast. But
um in terms of safety,
there are things that need to happen
each time you hit
the next step up in
speed, you
really should have
freight trains separated
from uh passenger
trains going faster
than 90.
Um In this
country, there are
cases where trains are going
faster than that.
100 and 10 miles an hour
for a section in Illinois and in
Florida.
And there's some sections where they're
going 100 and 25 with
freight trains in the
northeast. Again,
they're versatile. But as a general
rule, nineties kind of the
breakpoint, you
have to separate the roads from
the railway at 100 and
10. Again, that's
something you should just do
anyway. Um
But by regulation,
you have to do that at 100 and
10, you
need to mov'e the power
source off of the
train.
Um With
overhead electrical wires,
batteries won't do it uh
to go 100 and 25
more fencing is
always a good idea.
And then part of the reason for separating
passengers and freight
is that
slow, heavy
trains require
track. That's
very, it
takes a a beating from
those heavy freight trains.
So it's more flexible in order
to stay on the loads,
the faster you go, the more
rigid you want to track in
order to be the precise
uh guidance that you need for a
train going fast.
But the exciting thing about
railroads is you can piece these things
together in different ways depending
upon what your circumstances
are.
So, um we
have to simplify
it, broken it down into three
categories, shared
use lines where you are
sharing passenger
trains and
heavy freight trains are sharing
tracks on a
lot.
Um There's two
of these that are incredibly
busy freight mainlines
in Chicago
with very frequent passenger
service. They work well because
the tracks are built
for the designs
of running both of them.
Well, the
Northeast Corridor is what we would call
a passenger focus line where
you take an old line and you build
it to go as fast as
possible and
maybe you still have some freight
trains there. Again. The Northeast Corridor
does have freight trains on it just
a few and then a
new high speed line
is where you go and uh
build a totally
new railroad
in order to
um go with speeds of
over 100 and
50 miles an
hour.
Again. Uh Japan's
already built essentially Denver
to El Paso.
Uh China has
already
built essentially
Omaha to New York.
Um
and uh
France, Germany
and
Spain
um have each built their own
networks that are essentially the
size of my
region, the Midwest.
Um The European
systems don't link very well
together, which
will lead to a, a point
in the that I'll discuss
in the future. But each
of these pieces again,
come together in different
ways to work together
uh to connect
lots of different places
um into a single
network.
Um And again,
depending upon what your assets
are and what your goals are,
you can do these pieces in
different ways.
So one thing that's very
much missing from
the discussion
of a
railway service in
this country
is the lack of the federal
framework.
Um So at this point,
it's entirely State
driven, which,
um, uh,
which is why really
the California is the only State
to really be aggressive about high
speed rail. Uh,
the other State that could do it on
its own is Texas,
Florida could, to some
degree, Ohio
probably could. Illinois
kind of. Uh, but
you really all of these cross
State lines. So there
needs to be a federal program
to do this. Um,
Las Vegas is, is
a, um, outlier
because there was one individual
who had enough money to do all
the design work and
push it through the process to
get to getting
it under construction.
Um, and it was a fairly
simple project because it's in
the middle of I 15.
But we did this at the
federal level twice,
once around World War
One,
um, with the numbered
highways and
then, um,
under the
FDR administration,
the federal government through
the Bureau of Public Roads,
put together a federal
framework for what
and a network of all
weather highways would look
like the
States and the Feds negotiated
that in a 1947
they came up with an agreement
of what the primary trunks
would be. That's this map
here and then
politically, in order to
get the program
funded through
what today would be
probably about an 80
cent gas tax
increase.
Um They
added to that
the highways
that go into the cities
and were incredibly expensive
to build and did
very significant
damage to the
economies of our cities. But
that's, it was a federal
program that made it work.
They collected the taxes,
um, and then gave
90% money to build
it. Um
So that's one of the
things that is missing that
we need to advocate
for if there are to
be passenger trains of
significance in Santa
Fe Albuquerque.
Um And El
Paso,
um
the
federal government has
started the
process.
Um They did
essentially three
networks that
weren't really thought
of as part of the
national system.
The states who participated
um are
uh shaded in this
map.
So
essentially,
um
Arizona, Nevada and
California led the
first one.
Um the states
in the Midwest in the
second and
then there was a third
for the
Southeast
and uh the Northeast
Corridor was
not a comprehensive network
plan. It's just about the Northeast
Corridor. Uh So
since
1965
the northeast Corridor
has received
special privileges
that the other states don't get
only on that route.
Um And substantial
money that the other states don't
get. Um It's really
treated as a separate program
from the rest of the country.
Um So you can kind of see
where things
if they had thought
more globally or more
nationally,
you'd have a lot more
stuff happening. For example,
essentially, they're saying we
should build high-speed rail from
Saint Paul to Miami.
Um And from
Atlanta to
Boston. Um And
I think that the equation would
have been a lot differently, a lot
different. Um
But in this, uh what
we call share use is
colored yellow.
Um the regional
lines um
are in red, the
green is, that's right on
the fence and then,
uh, purple is, yes,
really. We need to build
a new high-speed line.
Um You can see that New
Mexico,
um, that they think there's
some sort of investment
needed for Denver
to Albuquerque and
Albuquerque
to,
um,
the, the way that our model worked
was kind of odd
but essentially
Albuquerque to Los
Angeles. Again,
I think that if there were
a federal program, this would look
very different than it does
today.
So we really need a
federal program with both
consistent money that people
can plan against the way we
do on highways
and airports.
And we also need
a federal framework because
it is all interstate in
nature and
our government is interstate.
And, um I
mentioned earlier that the
French network does not
connect well with
the Spanish network which
and they, neither of them connect well
with the German
network. It's because each
country did their own
planning. There isn't
really a strong European
plan though, they're better off than we
are. In that
regard.
So in terms of new and high
speed lines where you're going
200 miles an hour,
um
Most people when they get
aggressive, think about something
like this.
Uh But I wonder
if we decided
that places were important
enough to buy
a 200 ft sloth of
land and build a
really expensive highway
in it. Um And
connect a lot of cities
aren't those cities worth
connecting with high
quality great trains
that people will ride in
numbers. So
they don't have to worry
about falling
asleep behind the wheel or being
tired when they get to their meeting
and they can actually interact with
people while they're traveling or
do work.
Um But this is where people
thought, think about true high
speed lines being
built.
Um Right now this
is a um
again
a State driven
process.
Um And
so it's really up to
states to decide
what direction they want to
take.
Um I believe
as an outsider
um that
probably there should be
an aggressive program
to link Albuquerque
and, and Santa Fe
to Denver.
Um and to
Dallas. Um
and getting over to L
A,
um I said Dallas, I
met El Paso,
but Dallas probably makes
sense as well.
Um
But it's driven by the
State. One of the things
that came up which gets us closer
to this federal
program
is the New Quarter
ID program. There's a
number of steps that you
have to take.
Uh to get federal
money.
Um The
current federal money is kind
of running out. So it's
about the states putting
together plans and working
together to get
another federal
railway funding program, put
together the same way
that states planned with the
Feds a National
Highway Network and
then put together the political
coalition to make it
work. Uh But
you need to have at least
a State plan to get
started, that talks
about why you want to have the
services in.
And then there's
specific
steps in terms of scoping
the project,
developing the framework or
like a business plan or what they
call it a service development
plan.
And then you mov'e
into uh
engineering and environmental
clearance and then to
actual construction.
So if New Mexico
and again, I think you should,
if New Mexico wants to mov'e
forward with thinking
about high quality
trains,
um then
there's kind of this State
framework that needs to be
enhanced from the
current State railway
plan. Um
And then um
uh applications to get
into the Quarter Identification
program.
Um Hopefully that was helpful,
Mister Chair. I would be
very happy to
answer any
questions. Um
Should you have
them?
>> Oh OK. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. um
Arish for your um
informative, interesting
presentation.
And I will uh take
some questions from the
um
Members of the
Committee.
No one anyone have a
question, the
President
or
I have a quick question.
Uh One of your map
one of your maps,
uh,
showed the, and
showing the lines connecting
the Midwest to the west
coast.
>> Oh, you know, I did miss,
uh, something very
important. Um, and
I apologize. Uh,
yes, there certainly should
be, should
be,
um,
uh
Midwest and
southeast to the west
coast
and that kind
of gap.
So that planning
map that I showed,
uh, for the FA,
they really just looked at
what they believed to be
driving radius
around Chicago and around
Atlanta. And
then the Southwest is a
little bit more complex.
Uh The FA is in
the process of doing
a study
of long distance
trains.
And um
uh the Southwest
Chief uh
which serves
Albuquerque
and the uh
Sunset Limited, which
serves uh the El
Paso area.
Um
is um
those are long distance
trains and
they looked at
what routes would make
sense to add
and there were some more
east uh east west
routes and some Northwest
routes. I apologize
for getting it for forgetting to
discuss that.
Um Unfortunately, they're only
talking about one train a day on
those routes, but it is a
discussion point to
start thinking more
broadly as a national
network.
>> Ok. Thank you for that
answer.
Um No one
has any questions. We'll mov'e
on to the next
speaker,
uh Aec
Muar, who is the
lead economic advisor
to the National to the Coalition
for the National Infrastructure
Bank.
Um
A feca. Go
ahead. >> Thank
you very much. Very
pleasure. To be before
the Committee. I think
I've once again,
um, let me just pull up my
slots here. Oh, here we
go,
>> Mr. Speaker. We have an
opportunity to have the first
speakers' copy of their
slides.
>> So, are you able to hear me
and see me?
Ok.
Yes. Hey, thank
you very much. Uh So I'm with
the coalition for a National
Infrastructure Bank. I'm a
macroeconomist and
I'd like to uh piggyback
on to what Rick has already
presented to you
on our high
speed rail needs for the
country. And also
how this National
Infrastructure Bank can
finance them. Uh
because a big constraint
is that there's no money
in the federal budget under
existing programs to
finance high speed rail. And
that's in my view why
they've pretty much left it to
the states to
uh to pick up the pieces
and try and compete for,
for these very
limited funds that are
available. So we
have a bill in Congress to create
a $5 trillion
public bank to finance
infrastructure projects
all around the country. And
that includes high speed rail,
uh New Mexico
uh through the great efforts
of Senator Tallman
is the only State in the
country where 100%
of your Members of Congress are on
this bill. So thank you very much
for all of your support in New
Mexico for this, for this
Legislation whose support
is growing. As I as
I might point out, we've had
banks like this in our nation's
past to
finance infrastructure. For
example, Lincoln's uh
national banking system
built the Transcontinental
railroad. So there's one example right
there. And we've had
big uh uh projects
that came out of the for
the, the most recent bank, the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation
which electrified a
lot of the country and
provided water that's
coming into New Mexico now.
So this idea of a public
bank to complement budgets isn't
new. The bank works just
like a AAA regular
lending bank even though it's
lending only for infrastructure
and it's capitalized using
money from the private sector
and then it gives out a loan exactly
like a commercial bank. Uh
So for those reasons,
it does not require
resources to come from the
federal budget. It operates just
like a bank and it provides the loans
to build infrastructure
including high
speed rail, not only
high speed rail, but a
lot of other things that
are needed for
economic development. Like
you need power for running
the trains that will be
built, you need a new
water, large scale water
projects so that we don't have
halts to housing
like uh happened
in Arizona because of dra
conditions. We can also
expand our farming, that kind of thing.
We need more affordable housing,
better transportation, we need
linkages between
as rick said, between all
these high speed rail systems
and other transportation
systems that we build
and better connectivity
with broadband. So all those things
the National Infrastructure Bank would
finance but in
particular, it sets
aside 1.1
trillion to build high speed
rail that's not coming
from the federal budget.
Now, this is
the most recent infrastructure
law. Um As Senator
Tallman likes to say, they gave a lot
of money for New Mexico, for roads
but not sure that that's what New Mexico
really needs. Uh or can
make the best use of where it
really needs water
resources and more
rail and its transportation
mix, more high-speed uh
affordable housing. All
those things would be provided and
lent by the National
Infrastructure Bank. So
just to put another
cap on it to what Rick
was saying, we really
do need a national
network. Uh We
perhaps the
scope of what the
federal, the federal
Aviate railroad
administration is doing right now
is uh too
small. The reason they're leaving it
up to states is because we don't
have a national
network nor
the means to pay for
it. But the economic
benefits of such a network
would be just um really
astounding. Uh Here
are two other
possible um
ideas on where
this high speed rail network
might be built. And you can
see that both of these
suggestions, one
by dollar. Uh
Doctor Alexander
Metcalf from Thames
and another by Andy Kons
from the US High Speed Rail
Association. Both of
these accentuate
the front range high
speed rail line
and the East West
which goes all the way over to the west
coast and hooks New
Mexico as the center
of a new hub and the
importance here is that
this really
aec accentuates
economic growth. When
you hook together
areas like this with
inner-city rail, uh
fast rail, then
you really open up the economic
opportunities. Again. The
example is the
uh the um the
Transcontinental railroad that
actually built the whole
west and all of these hub cities
along the way. Uh We
can do more with
uh uh just moving
passengers. We can also
mov'e freight, fast freight
like this, take a lot
of the load off of the
um the the trucks that
are moving through, you know,
airports flying over
ahead and not really
developing New Mexico
per se, New Mexico. Of
course, as an economist, III,
I always look to these areas that we
really want to build
up that haven't been
built up so far. It's
a low income State. There's
lots and lots of potential here
for economic growth in the State.
And the high speed rail can
really be the the
factor that drives it. So
altogether what we're
facing on rail is
not only just a plan for how to
do it, but
the funding to do
it and this
National Infrastructure Bank
will be the
vehicle for providing
at least $1.1
trillion to build a high speed
rail network all across the country.
So I'll stop there and also see
if you have any questions. Thank
you
>> for their excellent
and informative presentation.
Uh Just a quick
word about the speaker.
Uh becomes
highly uh
credential was worked
for many years for the International
Monetary Fund
all over the world.
And um
in some respects, she had
diplomatic status
and was chauffeured to meetings
and limousines.
So it comes
highly and she's work, been working
for several years as a volunteer
for the National Infrastructure
Bank Coalition
trying to uh
implement this very
important uh
issue.
So
we'll start off a questionnaire
questions with the
Senator
goal.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you for your
presentation.
Um So
would there actually be
like a building
a physically
location?
Yes or
with the bank with
the bank beated,
>> the bank would
lend to
public authorities
to build infrastructure
around the country. So it could
be a housing authority,
it could be a new
Transportation authority. It
could be any expansion either
of Amtrak or
AAA private
public, a new
corporation like
Melding with Bright Line
uh to build
this high speed rail system around
the country. We want to
make sure that we
do it in a cost efficient
way so that when
we're um
lent making these
loans, uh it'll
uh they'll be able to be paid
back. Of course, uh
One beauty of high
speed rail is that
because it can go faster
and because it can handle
more passengers,
it tends to
be economically
stand on its own 2
ft. And so for that
reason, it should be able
to pay back the
loans from the National
Infrastructure Bank. Uh the
location of
uh where these lines will
go will depend again,
as Rick said, on the resources
that you have if we
need to use existing
track or take over
track, that's not being
um
effectively
utilized or
build down the middle of a
highway. Um to
get new uh uh
land use
access, uh We can
discuss all those with the local
authorities, they'll
have big input into
that. Um uh And
then we can also
work with local authorities
to better plan
community development so
that we can get train
stations, new
public housing, new
affordable housing, make
sure that all the water resources
are in there to and electric
uh supplies are in there
to support the
high speed rail effort. So
all together it would
require a lot
of um um
interfacing with you
on your economic development
plans for the
State.
>> Uh Mr. Chairman and
thank you. Uh
but I think maybe
I wasn't, maybe it was my
fault. I wasn't. Well,
for example, if New Mexico
wanted to apply, where
would they apply?
>> Uh They would
uh um
they, they
currently, if we're
talking about funding that's
coming from the federal
budget, they would
have to apply through these
programs that Mr. Harnish
has just described uh
to compete for
this uh quarter
rail ID program.
That would be a separate path.
But my, my point
is that the federal
funds, there's not a lot
there. We're currently in a budget
crisis. At the federal
level, we have huge
debt and
it looks like a lot of the programs
will be cut back. Uh
It doesn't look like the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act has
scale or room
to be expanded.
Um So those
resources, even though they are inviting
you to um
to possibly participate
for them, it's not clear that
those resources in the big
picture budget uh of
the United States are going to
be available. This
bank will
uh needs to be enacted
through this bill
that is currently in Congress.
And uh we thank all
of the Congress Members from New
Mexico for supporting this
bill. Uh let's say
tomorrow that it becomes
enacted. Uh And
that we formulate, we
so we need two things, we need the money
that the, the the
infrastructure bank will provide.
And we also need as
uh Rick pointed out a new
formulation for
uh how we manage our
national high speed
rail network
that is strengthening uh
the, the, the,
the overreaching
organization for
such a network. Uh If
that became a, a
new corporation,
then that corporation
would apply to the
NIB for loans to
build out high speed
rail.
Did that answer your question? >> Uh
sort of? But
that's fine. Uh
The second part is
so and maybe you it's
an unfair question.
Oh But for example, say
that this was bill.
Um What would
it be cost wise
for a passenger
say from Albuquerque to Los
Angeles?
Their one.
>> That's a great question.
And um,
the, there are some
several cost estimates
on the US
High Speed
rail.com
um,
um
website. That's another
organization that, that's
doing work in the same area
as Rick. Uh, and
I spoke with,
uh, the, um, person who
runs that organization and ask
them about these costing
estimates. Um
The good news is that
even if you spend
$48
billion on the Cascadia
Line or you spend
$20 billion on this
leg between here and there,
it seems like it's a lot of money
but, uh, as, as
we've, we've all said a
lot of, um,
traffic on this area,
uh, going back forth more
people will use the rail.
Uh It's cheaper
to provide
rail services than it is
to build new lanes on
um on highways.
Uh And they're, they're
also more climate friendly.
Uh they're faster,
we take traffic off the road,
less traffic congestion. All
these things are really good,
positive things and the,
the best beauty is
that high speed rail goes
fast enough and has enough
traffic on it to be able
to pay back all of the loans. Even
if it seems like the initial
amount is high.
Rick, would you like to add on something
to that? >> But I
think the question
was specifically about the,
the
fare
was, am
I correct
that it was about the cost
to the passenger for a
trip? Oh, Mr.
Chairman, no, that is
correct.
Um
So there
are uh different
strategies
about how you charge
fares and that's part of the
decision that the
entity that,
that puts the service
together
um
makes. And
so I
believe that since
there's a lot of public money
going into railroad
infrastructure that
the fare should be very low
so that you attract as many
people as possible.
Um Spain
adopted that model
after starting off
with having very high
premium fares and
then the
middling
coach fares, they
decided to switch
to having low fares to
attract a lot of people.
So essentially in
my view, the
train ticket should be
priced at
roughly the perceived
cost of the gas of
getting there, maybe a little
bit higher.
Um Amtrak in the
Northeast Corridor.
Um because they've
got a lot more demand than
they have capacity.
Um They charge very high
fares. I think that's
unacceptable
and a bright line
has a mix of fares
in Florida,
but certainly it should be, it
should be not much more
than the cost of driving
very well. Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman
>> Senator. Uh >> Next up >> we
have a representative
uh hear
it. Thank
you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the
presentation.
Um Having lived in
South Korea where the bullet
train took me all over
like in a half an hour.
I'd really like to see this.
Um My question though is about
California.
California has made
enormous uh
progress
on their Los Angeles
to San Francisco. There
actually have
people working throughout the Central
valley. What
do you think the impact
once that is
successfully built,
which actually looks
around 2033?
What do you think the impact
that will be on
making
Americans really
serious about high-speed
rail?
>> Uh One thing is to
reduce traffic congestion. I
mean it is very high,
all of the Pacific
coast, all of the eastern
coast uh suffers from
high traffic and
uh that's, you know, having
climate change
impacts for us.
Uh Another one is we
really need to
link up
or transportation needs
with our housing
needs. California is a
very high speed, a
very uh
um housing insecure
State. Uh and this
National Infrastructure Bank will also
build a lot of affordable housing
to match with the
transportation needs. So those
are two things that can go together.
Uh Rick, do you have also
some ideas?
>> Yeah. Um
So I
I will share my own
experience which was I
started this position in
2001 after
volunteering since
93.
Um and was
frankly afraid to,
to fly across an ocean.
So I had never ridden a train
and in 2004.
So I thought I understood high
speed rail. I thought I understood
its benefit. I
thought I understood why we
wanted it. Uh
Finally got the, the
gumption to go to
Paris in
2004
and took my first trip
from high speed
trip from Paris to
Marseille, that's
500 miles.
And uh today they
do that in three hours and 15
minutes and there's
essentially a train every
hour.
That's when I understood
what high speed rail was
and you know, the the
ability to be
in one place
not go through
security you
walk out into this
beautiful
downtown.
Um And you're right in the
middle of downtown in Marseille,
this beautiful city.
Um I strongly
believe that when
we get one of these
going,
people will go.
Now I get it.
So we're a little bit better off
than we were when
I started
because we've got Americans
who are going to China and,
and using their incredible
high speed system
uh to get to factories.
Um You've got
Americans who are going to
France and taking the
train to bordeaux for
the wine country. Uh
But we need
every day Americans
taking the train and that will
tip it. And so
uh bright line West will
get us there.
Um
And I would like to see California
Expe expedited, but
certainly the Central Valley is gonna
be a mind
changer.
>> Thank
you.
>> Next up. >> We have
>> a representative
uh
>> it
I I thank you, Chair,
I thank you both for your
presentation. You
keep um uh
I'm so sorry.
Um
uh Miss Tardy is that
it is
they uh you keep saying
that it will
uh
that we will have a short
period of repaying
these loans. What
period is that? Is
it a 30 year
loan, 100 year
loan? What, what is the
short period?
>> So uh uh
the period would
probably be commensurate
with the infrastructure that
you're building. Uh That
was the case, for example,
for Hoover Dam
which provides
electricity and water from the
Colorado river system
that eventually comes all the way down
into California and into
Nevada. Um
That, that loan, for
example, was a 50 year
loan. It was paid
back through small incremental
increases in electricity
prices and it was just,
the loan was just complete even
though it was built in 1933
or so, it was uh finally
repaid just a decade
or so ago. Uh We
envision that we
want to be
investing long
term in our
public infrastructure all throughout
the country and we can stretch
out the maturities uh to
the lifetime of what's
being invested in and
make sure that we have enough money left over
for maintenance and that kind of thing
and keep all of our
um you know,
infrastructure in the country
rebuilt and humming
right along as opposed to
letting it decay.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Ken and thank you for
that answer. Um
uh II, I too
am proud that we have 100%
of our congressional delegates
supporting um uh
this
bill.
Um
Can you tell me how
many other Members
currently in Congress
are supporting this
bill? >> Currently,
we have 42 Members of
Congress on the bill. Uh
We added four of them
since the, the, the
two conventions over
the summer. Uh There
is momentum on the bill.
We have eight
ranking Members uh
on the bill. That means
that if the, for example,
the House would be
shipped back over to
Democratic control that they would
be in charge of committees there.
We have uh the whole
spectrum of
legislators on the bill
uh from uh
Conservatives or uh
blue dog
Democrats to
progressive Democrats.
And we're actively, actively
seeking uh trying
to get Republican support.
We believe that that this
should be uh by
infrastructure, everybody says
should be bipartisan.
Uh This should be something that
should appeal to them because it
doesn't not impact,
the deficit does not
require new taxes spending or
anything like that. It's a a
purely off
budget vehicle
and it will
bring enough
adequate resources into
every single district
in the country, including their
district. So we're really
working on Republicans. If any of
you know, any Republicans
that would, would
like to come on the bill, we would love to have
them.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Thank
you for that. Yeah, it is
the Infrastructure Bank which
is not just for high
speed rail, it's for so
many large public
works. And so I I to
see it is,
should be a bipartisan
effort. Um
I just have just
another clarification
thing in the first presentation
on slide eight.
This is a map
of our
highways
and then the next slide
on slide nine is
the Federal Regional
rail plan.
So I guess
if the
approach is that each
State, they're hoping each
State has
an infrastructure
investment
in beginning this project
that we can build momentum
that eventually
becomes a large or
federal
site. So,
who is that? What you're doing? You're
letting the State
decide where to put
the rails? Like what
cities to go through?
I find it
on the Federal Regional
Plan. I find a couple of things
odd. You know, we're going from
Albuquerque to Denver.
That's great. Why
not El Paso
through Denver to Chicago?
Why is not Omaha on Denver
connected
um, in the Federal
plan, Cleveland
Columbus and Cincinnati,
Ohio are not connected
unless you leave
State. And
so, um, and so
I'm just wondering what is the
difference between the federal
plan and what
really you,
what I thought I heard was
that the,
uh, you're leading it
up to the states to
make these investments
at first to be
like your first
seeds.
Is that correct?
>> So, um,
to be clear,
we believe there should be
a federal
plan
like there was a
federal interstate highway
plan. Um
That is one thing that is
sorely missing
that we would like states to
advocate for
and for cities and,
and individuals to advocate
for.
Um, so
we believe that the
federal planning map that
we proposed that we
presented there is
severely
inadequate,
um, clearly
missing huge swaths of
the country and
you pointed out a couple
of, of serious
um um,
missing items,
but that is the current
State of Corridor
planning
in the US.
Um And the current
policies which we
disagree with
um
mean are that
the states, this is
a State driven
program that the
states have to do the initial
planning and then ask
for federal
money out of um
competitive grant
programs.
Um So
I was just trying to present
where we are not where we think
we should be
and certainly it should
be possible to travel
to multiple places throughout
New Mexico by
train at
varying times of
day.
Um And
uh I
there is kind of a discussion
of that with this long distance
plan and
that I did not present
and I should have
um that provides
a, a for, for starting
that discussion in a different
way. Um
But the my intent was
to say that
um if
New Mexico is to have trains,
which I think it should, there's a
couple of things that the State needs
to do to get
active.
>> Thank you so much, Mr. Chair and thank
you very much for that answer.
Thank
you.
>> Wait a
this concludes this portion of the
agenda and Um
Thank you again
panel for
being with us today and
providing a lot of interesting and
um
informative and being
very informative about this issue.
So thanks
again and
now we'll mov'e on to
uh
myself.
You want me to go up there,
you wanna take
over,
you
know.
Oh,
good afternoon,
everyone.
Thank you for allowing me to speak
today.
So
National Infrastructure Bank,
very important,
extremely important issue that we don't
hear enough about.
Like I read an article
recently
national publication saying
that
unfortunately, there's been absolutely no
discussion
in this election cycle
about
infrastructure
even though it's a very
important issue.
So
up until you know, the
sixties, the United States was the
envy of the world
is infrastructure, but
sadly, it's fallen
um fall
behind the the rest
most of the
developed world.
And one of the
problems that
has happened is because we can't agree
on how to finance
um
infrastructure.
So
it's already been pointed
out.
Um It's not
that we
the beauty of the National
Infrastructure Bank doesn't increase
taxes, doesn't increase the debt.
We can't uh
is be almost
impossible
to generate the kinds
of money that we need to
taxes and
debt. So that's the
the beauty of this
system.
So
um I want to
talk about
four things.
One
status of
infrastructure,
the Biden Bills
a little more about nib
uh some of the things that I've done
to to push this bill
through and some last-minute
thought
So
the um
you know, the status of our
uh
infrastructure is
a, it's terrible.
30% of the,
of New Mexico roads are in
poor condition.
New Mexico's drinking water
infrastructure
is in a,
needs
$2.4
billion
to uh
make, bring it into
a good
repair.
22% of New Mexico
students lack internet
service and 28%
do not have access to their
own uh
computers
a little bit more on that
later on the NASH,
that's a,
on the national front.
Um
The uh American
Society of Civil Engineers
have
recently increased
the uh
the report card
on our infrastructure from
D minus to C
plus.
Um
But you know, why is it,
you know, the richest country and the most
important, most powerful country
in the world that's so far
behind and
um and, and,
and, and infrastructure
and that's because
uh as I've already said, we're not spending
enough anywhere near the amount of
money and we, we
could, because we can't agree on.
Um and
um how to finance
it. Uh United
States spends 2.4%
on it and the
GNP on, on
uh infrastructure. Europe spends
5%. E
China spends
8%. China's
spending
almost three
times more than we are. Europe
is spending twice as much.
And um
we, we
rank
13th in the
world
in the infrastructure
and it's only less
than a decade ago. We were number
seven. So we've the
last decade. We've fallen
from
number seven to to number
13 in the
United States. One third of our roads
are in poor condition.
Um,
nearly a quarter of our
bridges are
financially
obsolete
and, um,
is all the
light rail and bus
transit systems across the
country are,
are in need of repair and
upgrading.
And the
freight trains, rail
networks are
antiquated.
In spite of the fact that Amtrak's
readership ridership
has never been higher.
I I read recently
that 100 years ago,
trains from New
York City to Chicago went
70 miles an hour.
That's no faster. Today. 100
years later, trains aren't going any
faster.
Um It's
just a
and then of course,
for those of you who have flown
lately, the airports are
or
a crowded
and there's a lot of delays
uh due to non
weather, uh
non weather related
conditions.
So we, we have
so many
this goes on and on and on. We're
just, if we
falling behind the rest of the
world, if we can't mov'e people
and goods faster, we're
gonna continue uh
to uh
fall behind.
So
moving on to
uh
the Biden bill, remember the Biden bill
was passed in
He Congress
and signed by Biden
in uh November of
21.
They called for
$3.2
billion for New
Mexico.
And
um
it
uh
there was
some
no money for high speed
rail
even though I've seen
maps where
uh the first
Transcontinental
railroad would go through
Albuquerque. Well,
it makes sense because I 40
is the busiest highway, western,
western Mississippi,
uh, broadband.
Um, I've
seen estimates anywhere from, we
need 2 to $3 billion
in order to, uh,
provide
broadband to
everybody in the State of New Mexico,
we're only getting $100 million.
That's 120 is what we need.
Although in all fairness, there are some
federal grants,
uh, that are available.
I remember reading recently
they made a big deal in newspapers.
They provided 40 million. They,
somebody got a $40
million grant. Well, that's just a drop
in the bucket of the $2
billion. Uh, that we
need, uh,
roads and bridges,
74 cents. That
3.2 billion
we're getting is going for roads and
bridges.
That's ridiculous. You can
make a good argument that we have a lot
of like water needs
water. We're only getting
350 million. We
need over 2 to $3
billion.
And, um,
yet, um,
you know what, you can make a good case of
water is, is, May be more
important than roads.
You know, we could run out of water.
We're not gonna run out of roads. They May
not be smooth, but we're not
gonna run out of them, but we could
run out of water.
And if that happens, it wouldn't
be, wouldn't
matter if we had good roads,
wouldn't be anybody around to
drive out of. But I'm
exaggerating a little bit. But you get the
point. Uh
the uh
approved
the uh the, the,
the Biden bill is
$1.1 trillion.
We could spend one point trillion dollars
just on water,
say nothing of it.
And so the bill,
um
the Biden bill did not include
desalinization for the Southwest.
No money to bring water into the
Southwest from regions
with a third plus of water and no
funding to replace
aging pipelines that date
back over a century.
In other words, just a trickle
of funding.
No pun intended.
It does not
matter,
does not address a host of
water, water issues,
obviously.
So
um
electric grid, there's no money
for electric grid. You know, we have the
second sunny estate, the
fifth windy estate. We can produce
a lot of, a lot
of uh
of uh
energy.
And um
some of the folks are saying
that
our electric grid
is becoming so over
load, over capacitated
that we won't be able to trans
I mean all this
uh renewable
energy.
So
and there's there's 13
categories in the Biden Bill
and we only received money from
about half of
them. So
uh we talked
about water infrastructure,
roads, broadband
electric grid,
high speed rail.
You know what's interesting
is you know that I
25 project
gonna cost a quarter of a
billion dollars
on I 25. It's
gonna take 2.5
years
of
slow traffic.
I used to drive that before they
started construction
and they, in the rush hour, not every
day, at least once a week and it wasn't that
bad, you know, slowed it up for a few
minutes.
So we're spending
quarter of a billion dollars
just to cut a few minutes off
that trip and, and
re add a lane
between
uh
um Comanche
and Montgomery
and Redo a couple of
interchanges. I mean,
it's, our
priorities are screwed up. I asked
my friend, my lobbyist
friend in Washington, why is it? Why
are we spending
disproportionate amount of money on
roads?
He said two reasons.
One,
the auto manufacturers
and the highway contractors have
undue influence.
Oh, you can
make a good argument that corporations
are running it, running America,
not Congress.
So it, it's
a
so ok, we'll mov'e
on.
Um,
yeah, I, I, I've been to China
twice. So
last time I was there was
1999
before some of the young people
in the legislature were
born.
I guess we have somebody who's 25
years old, I think in the
legislature.
Pardon?
Oh, well, she
was just an input
then. And
so, but they
hadn't even started,
they were doing a lot of infrastructure but
they hadn't started their high speed
rail.
But since then they've,
the last 20
years they built
2025 to
30,000 miles of high speed
rail. Europe. I was in
Europe
twice and last
year and this year took the high
speed trains. Unbelievable,
so smooth, so quiet, so
fast,
something uh
we don't and the roads, I couldn't believe
how, how smooth the roads
were. And,
you know, I get back to Albuquerque
and,
and the road, the road from
um the
airport, I 25
you know, rough.
These,
it was one of the
uh roughest
roal
ridden that the whole
trip to Europe
and, and then, and then
Germany, no billboards.
What a difference that makes
my, but
anyway,
uh so yeah,
in Europe
infrastructure is
considered a, a,
an investment which
it should be because it's an economic
development too. In America we consider
an expense. That's a whole
different attitude.
Um
So here's another interesting fact,
you know, you all know, we got $6.2
billion sitting idle in
our capital outlay
system,
$6.2
billion
which could have been or should have been spent
by now. And now we're
gonna, because of the
30% increase in construction
cost, it's gonna, that money is not gonna
go as far.
But what's interesting that 6.2
billion is almost twice as
much as the 3.2
billion we got in the Biden
bill. Think about that.
We got 6.2 billion
sitting there
unspent it should have been
spent. That's twice as much
as the money we're getting from the Biden
infrastructure.
Unbelievable. I
tried
for seven years to reform the
system.
I got absolutely
nowhere
and I wish Nancy was still
here because one day we were
talking about reforming the
system, they were talking about
tweeting the system during
a
a Democratic
Senate Democratic
Caucus talking about
tweeting it. Well,
so I said quitting
is not gonna work.
It's so bad. We're
gonna have to start over, start over
again. And Nancy
whispers in my
ear,
she says, you know, they're never gonna
change and she
said it in
the, in the tone of voice
that she, you know, agreed with me.
That that's
what anyway,
I hope.
Um
so we've already heard a
lot about the, actually
heard a lot about the infra
the
infrastructure
bill.
Um
So how it
works
and um
you know, it, it create, it
monetizes uh
treasury
bills,
it capitalizes or
monetizes
um
treasury bills and uh
sets up a commercial bank
that lends that lends
money.
You know, I think during the New
Deal, you think, well, some people might
say that these should be grants,
but it's such an
economic development
um
to, that
encourages so
much economic
growth that
the
cities and counties and states
had no trouble paying it back
during the New Deal.
Think about the, you know, the
Tennessee Valley Authority brought
electricity to
Appalachia. Think
about that. Can you imagine what that did
to the economy and Appalachian
they brought, but they
had no trouble
paying that, paying that money
back. Sometimes
it does give out a limited number
of grants with
special, under special
circumstances.
Um But most of
it is
uh loans.
So the benefits
have already been mentioned
earlier.
And the three,
this real quick, three
important
um three
reasons why this is
so important
one. Uh
the economy it
brings brings about
robust investment in
infrastructure.
Um
in the 20th century, set
foundation.
After second World War,
we invested a lot of and
it really strengthened
it, the
economy of, of
America.
Um
But
it's
a
has already been pointed out, poor,
infrastructure can have a very
negative large costs
in the the economy.
Number two,
investing in both new
infrastructure and current
maintenance would stimulate the
economy. And number
three has a terrific
multiplier effect, meaning
that the economic gains
are far greater than, than
the amount of money
spent. But
also, you know, there's just real
quick, I'll give you, there's a lot of national
organizations that
have endorsed this
bill.
Um
The National Black
Caucus, the
Council of State
Governments,
National Association of
Counties, National Association
of Development. Organizations
us high-speed rail,
obviously in a large,
in a lot of large
cities including,
uh, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Chicago,
New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,
Detroit,
Pittsburgh, and many more have already
endorsed this
bill
also after the
states,
um,
have either passed
or, or,
uh,
um,
yes or endorsed
or introduced
Legislation to
encourage Congress
to enact
of this, this
bill.
So,
um,
it's
ok. Moving on now
to some quick, some of the
efforts that I made to
as this
um
bill
um
would be, first
of all.
Um,
but I've done five things. I
sponsored a
memorial
written op EDS,
been dozens of
Zoom meetings,
sponsored resolution,
the N CS L
and uh was a
major factor
in getting
Congress
Women's
Sainsbury and Fernandez
to
endorse
for sponsor the bill.
Um,
the fellow from the
South
Abe,
uh, someone else worked on that. I
think that she's very
active and
invisible.
It used to be that the old
meals and now they're
closed
and, um, get
her name. I can't,
I can't take any credit for that
if it. So
op EDS, we, we've written,
uh, we've had two or
three op EDS here
in the papers
in Las Cruces, Santa Fe
Albuquerque.
And um
one of them, we actually got
22 signatures.
I've never seen that
many people
sign
on
to a op ed be
before or
since.
Um,
we just,
that was, was impressive.
22. I don't think anybody ever
seen an op ed had 22
signatures. Most of them, about
two thirds of them were legislators.
And then we got, they were, some
of the others were
um out of
various
profit nonprofit
organization.
So, zoom meetings,
national
Infrastructure bank
sponsors
nationwide zoom meetings.
I and
I've been on
maybe
15 to 20 of
them. And
then last summer I went to,
to uh
Indianapolis,
the N CS L convention
and sponsored and presented
a resolution
urging Congress to enact the
nib.
And
um
so
just a few lastminute
thoughts. And then I
was,
oh, I just wanted to give a shout out to
Joy Garrett. She
uh
and I sponsored the
resolution,
the Senate joint memorial.
Number one.
Oh, now, number
one that was
in this year
we got it through the Senate
rules
and I never got any
further.
Very
disappointing.
And then the year
before
2023
the Joy
not
sponsored
memorial along with
me
and it went to rules.
It was, it was assigned to rules and
tax and business and never got,
never got heard.
And you know, people know
me. I know, I don't, I'm persistent.
You know, I, I ask, you know,
multiple times when we hear
this bill, can we hear?
Couldn't get it done. Yeah, but we, we
hear these memorials
honoring the field days in Santa
Rosa. Anybody
hear from Santa
Rosa.
Um You know, we
so
get a load of that.
He get
bill this,
I don't think there's a hell of a lot more things
more important than this
couldn't get it scheduled. But yet we
scheduled the field days
on the, in Santa
Rosa. I don't know, I don't
get it.
So
that's a interesting
um thing I wanted
to share with you,
as I said before, you
know,
such an important issue
is there's no been no
discussion
and this election cycle on a
nationwide
basis
and our poor infrastructure
is causing supply chain
issues. I'll give you an example.
Remember the longshoreman
strike now,
like,
let's for the sake
of election they
postpone that
renew the negotiations
in January.
Well, as you remember,
two big issues were wages
and automation.
Well, in China they've
totally automated their
docs. So there's no,
during the pandemic, there, there
was no problem
there, the supply
chain. But in
America we
haven't,
we haven't automated a
dock in Long Beach
and that's a hold
up. It can't
mov'e the goods as fast
and of course, the
unions are gonna fight that. It'll
be interesting to see how that
is resolved.
Um
So,
or infrastructure is causing
um
causing um
supply chain and what's
interesting about China, not only they
spending trillions of
dollars
on their own infrastructure,
but they have this program called a New
Silk Road Belt
and Road initiative,
where they're spending trillions
of dollars all over the count all over
the world. Actually, in
100 and 40 countries,
they're building
infrastructure,
ports and roads,
rail
and
um all kinds of
infrastructure in order
to accelerate economic
growth, mostly in
undeveloped countries
or, and developing
countries.
Um
So this
will be a tremendous
boost to global
uh
GNP um
especially in
the developing countries.
So that's interesting
that um and, and obviously,
they're buying a lot of influence
where you can spend that kind of money in that
many countries, mostly in
Africa, South America
and uh
Southeast China. South.
Yeah, Southeast
Asia.
So
uh I'm almost
done.
Um All
right, mentioned
that
the
uh
you know, the back
to the uh capital
outlay, you know, we got over 5000
projects,
but it's gonna take a small army
of people to administer
that.
And
um
so in conclusion,
if we can't mov'e people and goods
faster, we will continue
to fall behind.
Um
And you
know, the
beauty of this bill
is there's no debt, doesn't increase
debt
for taxes.
And
um
we, we are in, you know, serious
need of making
this a major
um
issue.
And if you can only remember one thing
I said today
is
moving our infrastructure
is one of the most important things
we can do uh
to improve our,
our economy
and there's so many
benefits
that are
outlined in the last page
of the handout
um from the,
the Lady from the National
Infrastructure Bank Coalition
got a whole page of
there's so many benefits, such
an important issue and it's
not being
talked about which goes to show
you that just because it's a good
idea.
There's a lot of good ideas out there. It doesn't
mean it's gonna get adopted, but
I'm optimistic that
eventually it will be. Thank you
very much for
listening,
>> Mr. Chair. Any questions from
the Committee
represent Garrett and
Senator Gonzalez? Thank
>> you madam Chair. Thank you, Senator
Tollman. I really have to testify
to his fearless
work
over the last almost
six years to get this
done as a result.
Our three Congress
people are sponsors.
We've also met with
Senator Ben Ray Lujan,
staff and Senator Martin
Heinrich's staff. I
think it's really important to realize
the benefit. This would be to
New Mexico as
a State and as a
region because
this allows
water projects, electro
you know, different projects
to involve multiple states as
well as our own State.
And as you know, our electric
grade has to be updated.
Uh representative
case earlier mentioned
the importance of water
as actually this was
during our lunch.
But she mentioned,
you know, water is the basis of
everything. If we don't have water,
we can't live.
Actually, we can't grow
economically So I just
wanna really
thank Senator
Tollman because I know
even when he's no longer
member member of
our legislature, he'll still be
working on this. It's
really, really important
that it gets done. Thank you, Senator
for all your
work.
>> Thank you, Representative, uh,
next Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, madam
Chero. Really don't
have a question. I just want
to applaud
Senator Tallman for
all his work.
And, uh, it is
frustrating, you know,
because as I
mentioned,
and actually, when I mentioned,
as far as,
you know, when we're looking at a
gas tax for the
bot,
the 1st, 1st thing we need
to do is even
improve their equipment.
Their equipment is just so
outdated.
And, uh, you know,
and the any time
that they do receive an
appropriation,
you know, of course, they can't put it
there because, you know, they're looking
at the most immediate
areas
and, you know, in our
roads.
But, um,
oh,
you know, as a State, you
know, it's, um,
and I don't know where it's gonna
start,
but this week on the
legislative finance
Committee,
you should have seen how
many different
things were brought to
us that is
held back because of
perm.
And, you know, it
just takes so long
and so antiquated
and so,
um, not efficient,
you know, the way we do this.
And I have a project
that we started,
um,
probably like about
almost seven years ago
with the late Senator
Cisneros
that you would think that it was just
very simple and this
is providing
an opportunity for
the Penasco area to
have a natural
gas.
And it's
like molasses
and it's like
one permit after
another permit, after another
permit I think is going
on six years.
And this is where you're seeing
that,
you know, bundling
of funds because
a lot of it, it's not that
they haven't spend it. There's a lot
of variables involved with
them, with what's happening.
Now, when you take
a um
madam Chair and Senator like
other countries,
they don't deal with the formality
of permitting
that we do, you
know, so they do mov'e a lot
faster and do. Well.
So when I visited in
Spain that I was a
super bullet that
they call, you
know, and I wanted to make sure
that I asked the question. I said,
well, how many permits did you have
to get to do
what you're doing? They said
none, we
just did it,
you know, and
uh what, how
can you compare that, you know,
with, with us? We
would be still stuck
in the number one
thing
and uh
you are right. You know, there
is a lot of money that has
been placed in Capital
Oley and
uh not all of it is the
fault, you know, of the
entities are the fault of
the legislator.
It's just
ours.
No, no I'm saying, but
you know, we can't imply
that, you know, it hasn't
been spent. It's just
a system that we
have.
And again, thank you for
your work and someone will
pick it up and
Representative Garrett
is dying, she'll take
him.
We'll help
you.
>> I guess that's it.
Yeah. >> Any other
questions in the kidney?
Thank you,
Chairman.
Next, I guess we'll mov'e on to
our last presentation of the
day.
So Albuquerque Rapid
Ray Benjamin
Lopez to
Lopez
and it's also going to be on
Zoom
Members
of
what?
>> Hello?
Can you all hear me?
>> We can hear you, Mr. Lopez. Can
you hear us? >> Yes.
Um It looks like let
me see if I can put, oh, there we go.
I think. Can you see me
now?
>> No,
no,
there you are >> there. I am.
OK,
thank you.
Um All right. Uh I
will just take a second to
get set up
with my slides here
if that is OK with
everyone.
OK.
And can everyone
see the
presentation?
Yes, sir, we see it.
OK. Thank you so much.
All right. Uh Well, thank you so
much. Uh
Mr. Chair and everyone in
the Committee for having me here
today. I really appreciate
the opportunity to get to speak with you
all. My name is Benjamin
Lopez and I just
wanted to introduce myself.
So uh I was raised
in Tiarra, right outside of Albuquerque.
Uh I grew up around
Albuquerque area
and my parents are both
Albuquerque natives and I'm
a graduate of the University of New
Mexico where I got
my bachelor's degree in economics.
Uh and then went on to Brown
University to get
my Master of Public Affairs
degree. And currently
I'm coming to you virtually because
I am residing in Washington
DC. Uh I'm
working on uh
transportation
policy and
uh I'm just really passionate about our
hometown and about our
State and
about, you know, great
transportation between our
communities, especially in
our smaller towns all over
for New Mexicans.
And that led to this project
that I'm actually presenting today,
which I conceived in December
of last year. And I was
researching a
transit system up in
Canada actually,
that I
used partially as inspiration
for what I'm bringing forth.
Um And I wanted to envision
what a basic network to get
people moving around. Albuquerque
could look like. Uh And
there are a lot of different
technical aspects that I'll
try to go through in a way that's,
that's very straightforward, but
that's my little table
setting. So
just for an introduction
into what I'm gonna be talking about
today, uh Albuquerque
is a city with some transportation
options that have stayed
essentially the same for the
past 100 years.
So when we tore
out our electric Street cars
and replaced them with the bus network,
that was the last
maybe the construction of the
highways was the last biggest
change that happened in our city.
So the way you traveled 100 years
ago is pretty similar to the
way you would travel. Now
you'd either drive or you could
take the bus. Um
And there have been a lot of studies
conducted over the past decade
or so by the
Midre council governments,
Mr. Cog, uh
the Rio Metro folks who
run the rail runner and
the planning organization
that have looked at what
residents are saying and really they're
saying we want
more choices, we
want to be able
to get around more
efficiently to not have to
worry about driving
and parking and being stuck in
traffic as much and worrying about
safe streets and
worrying about our jobs
and our houses being so far
apart. Um And so that's
part of what's informing my presentation
here is that a rapid
rail network would really be
transformative for
the city and its residents. And
there are a lot of partnerships
that have become
feasible in the past few
years that might not have been so
possible in the past.
Uh that could actually really protect
taxpayers, protect
those public funds uh
and keep kind
of public
funds and then taxpayers
from holding the bag if, if anything
ever increases in cost.
And so that's also something that I'll go
into. The
first thing I want to talk about where we are.
So you
can see uh with some data that
I gathered from the census and
the American community survey,
most people, the vast
Majority of people get to work
by driving around the Albuquerque
area, it's over 82%
and that's of
2023 and
just 1% of people
this tiny little bar down
here are choosing to use
transit. And this
figure also does not account for
any other travel besides
just getting to work. So
if you go out on the weekend, if
you go to visit your friends, if you go
to the movies, you go shopping,
this doesn't actually encapsulate
that. And yet
just this alone, the
vast vast Majority of people are
choosing to drive and that
decision has a cost.
Uh So last
year, this was a
study conducted
by the University of
Texas. There were
44 hours of traffic
delay in Albuquerque per person,
which is almost two days
that you're stuck sitting in traffic when you
try to go somewhere over the
course of a whole year. And
that results in almost 8
million gallons of wasted
gas. And that's almost
80,000 tons of excessive
carbon emissions just
from sitting around, not
even getting anywhere, but just
sitting in traffic. And that's
about 19 million
hours across everyone who
lives in our city, that people are
just stuck in traffic.
And that's just one
of the costs. We also
see a cost in uh
deaths and injuries in
human lives. So, New
Mexico for, I think the eighth
year in the row now has
actually been ranked as the worst
State in the country for pedestrian
fatalities. And
pedestrian deaths nationwide. This
is a real, real problem. Right
now, we have the
highest rates of pedestrian
fatalities in 40 years in this
country. And New
Mexico is number one and
Albuquerque as it turns out is
number two uh for
pedestrian deaths per 100,000
population. And there are a lot of reasons
for this. You know, it's,
we built a lot more road miles
in the past 50 years, we
have wider lanes,
more lanes, more traffic.
We have bigger,
heavier vehicles driving
at faster speeds
and that's caused a lot
of, of human
suffering. And
the studies being conducted by
our experts in the Midre
have also shown
people are not happy about this.
Um We have a plurality
of residents over
40% over
10 years in two separate studies
said that they are
dissatisfied with the way
that our transit, our transportation
system works in the Midre
and that it's quote, not
meeting their needs. So
you have the issue of
actual deaths and
injuries and then the fact that the
transportation system right
now just isn't working
for people.
And part of the current State of that system
is uh the State of a BQ
ride, which is the bus network in
Albuquerque and
they've been dealing with a lot. So
they have some serious financial
headwinds. They're doing
a lot of work to
pull themselves out of
the aftereffects
of our exit from the
COVID-19 pandemic.
A lot of transit agencies all
across the country are having these
issues with trying to get
back their RR with trying
to recover their funding.
And we have a serious
shortage in Albuquerque of
bus drivers that's actually
topped. I think 50%
of positions were
vacant over the past couple of
years. And that's led to a lot
of reduced service which
really hurts a lot of people
who don't have access to a
personal vehicle.
And in the past,
even before the pandemic, uh
the transit department has just
been chronically underfunded. You can
see um
in the city budget this most
recent fiscal year, that's coming up fy
25 it's
gonna be a $1.4
billion city budget
and A BQ right is gonna
get $65 million
which is about
4.6%
of the city budget. And it's,
it's what you'd really say is a
shoestring budget for an
agency. It's really
hard to
run effective
useful transportation
with no money.
Um And so
despite that, they've been
working on
uh reforming their network.
So they've been working with a pretty good
transit firm on
this A BQ ride forward
proposal to
uh try to either get coverage
or get ridership, but that's
coming at a trade-off. So
when they want to get higher
ridership, they are actually
reducing the coverage of the
network. So there are some neighborhoods
in Albuquerque that could
completely lose bus service
and have no transit option
at all. Um but that
does come with the trade-off of
the new network has more
writers and
they're trying to do this because they
can't get a,
a higher revenue for
the the transit system. So it has
to be revenue neutral.
Um And one bright
spot in the network is
actually Albuquerque rapid
transit, the art bus.
Um it's been doing very, very
well. It, first year of
operation it got
1.1 million writers
and most recently, it's
actually doubled that
figure up to 2.2
million writers in 2023
on one bus line.
And that's elevated above
a lot of big players. Uh
It's the sixth busiest
bus line in
America bus rapid transit
line. And that's
busier than Houston. It's
busier than Cleveland. A
lot of cities that are bigger than
Albuquerque. And the
redesign of Central Avenue
that has accompanied the Art
bus opening up has actually
led to a 60%
reduction in deaths
and injuries on that road.
And that was a study done by UN
M. So
there is clearly
use case right? People
in Albuquerque when it's
available, they want to
use transit when it runs
frequently, when it's reliable,
they want to use it. But to
meet their own goals
for people using more transit,
there has to be a serious
rethink of
investment in the
system.
And so that's where this comes in. This
is my personal proposal
that I created and it started
out kind of as a personal interest
project. I was interested
in some other maps that other folks
had created. There's a pretty
active transit
supporting community
online on social media.
And actually in Albuquerque now
we have what's called
Strong Towns is a
national organization
that opened up a chapter in Albuquerque
that's seen really great
attendance. Um
So I was getting inspiration from
other folks and
what started out as kind of a little
hobby time turned
into this full-blown research
project. And the
final map that I have
presented to you today is is
very comprehensive. It's seven
lines, there are 70
stations. Uh It's over
100 miles of new rail
and it would be fully
automated and fully
elevated above the Street,
which has several benefits
in terms of cost. It's
a lot less costly than
building a bunch of tunnels
underground and it's
also safer and more
efficient than building stuff on
the Street. Um
But it has connections to
the Sunport, to Balloon Fiesta
Park, to our
universities uh
to downtown,
to our major hospitals. It
has a stop up at the Intel
campus. Uh It
connects to Mesa Del
Sol and the Netflix
studios, the Planned
Maxion Solar Factory,
our stadiums at uh
the Isotopes and
the pit are connected, it connects
to the rail runner. It
connects of course to the art bus which
is in black and every
line connects with another
line. So not every
line funnels someone into
downtown which is something a lot
of older transit systems
did because they were focused
only on commuters.
Um And so just to
compare that,
I plucked out these three maps
which are demographic maps
from the folks over
at the A B ride
forward bus plan,
they put together these really helpful
maps. So I thought I'd overlay
my network on it. Um
And they cover three things,
activity which
is kind of a nexus between
jobs and housing
and then just jobs in the
center. And then the rightmost
map is actually zero
vehicles. So
the amount of people in a given
area who don't have
any vehicles. And I thought that
was a really important statistic
because growing up in Albuquerque,
I just assumed
you drive, everyone
drives, everyone has a
car, but that's actually not the
case. There are thousands of
people throughout the
city that have zero
vehicles to use and that makes
getting around really,
really difficult.
And so you
can see I can zoom in a little bit
that the network
overlays pretty well with a lot
of these areas, the darker areas
are where you have higher numbers
and the network is in black.
And you can see in these areas,
especially downtown
along the uptown
area, along
these areas near Osuna and
Coors, there was a lot of job
density and a lot of
places where people would be boarding and
exiting, especially here
with both involved
housing and jobs. A
lot of high activity
centers through this area.
And this is also why
art was placed on central is because
there's a lot of activity going on
here. And so that's just
a quick look at the
comparison.
And so I think a natural question that comes
up is why this,
why rapid rail not
just investing in the bus
network. Um And the
big thing is capacity.
So there's really no
better way to mov'e a lot
of people quickly
than with rapid rail.
And so for a comparison,
if you took the art bus
and you ran them two minutes apart,
so there's a bus coming every two
minutes, you could mov'e
about 4000 people in
an hour. But if you did
that same two minutes
with a train, you could mov'e
18,000 people in an
hour. And so this
connects with something that
the folks the
Transportation uh
Planning Organization
and the Rio Metro Department
wanted to do, which is to get
20% of
people choosing
transit by
2040 on
these 12 corridors they
selected in Albuquerque.
And if they wanted to do
that and they only wanted to do it,
do it with buses,
they would have to purchase at
least 90 new
art style buses to
fit all of those people.
And that's if all of those people
were packing
the bus maximum capacity
on every bus and a
minimum wait time of
seven minutes between each
bus and that network
actually costs
$3.7
billion to operate over
30 years. And
using calculations from the planning
folks. And I actually adjusted
that for inflation because that was
2018.
Um And that includes the
cost of replacing those buses,
but it does not account
for any increase in
population. It doesn't
account for any increase in people
choosing to use transportation
like that. It's
just to keep the
network going. So it May well
actually be more
um and an interesting tidbit
I thought I could point out is that
even a sidewalk
moves almost 10 times
as many people as
driving by
yourself.
And so I wanted to go into,
um, really one
of the biggest parts of this presentation
is having a
financing partner
uh to help us construct
such a network. And so there's a
firm in Canada called CD
PQ. Uh, it
reads something in French, but I won't
try to pronounce it. But
basically they are
the public pension
manager for
the province of Quebec.
And so they have assets that are
worth about 325
$326
billion as of June
of this year, just a lot
of money for them to have in their
coffers. And
they established an
infrastructure subsidiary
that actually acts
as contractor
planner,
constructor and
operator for transit
projects. So it's like a
to Z they'll handle it for
you and
the benefits and returns
that they get from operating that
system go back
into the pockets of pensioners
and retirees because
they are a public pension uh
guardian basically.
So every time someone pays
their fare, they're basically
paying into their own retirement.
Um And in Montreal,
they've actually constructed
a 42 mile
rapid rail line much like
what I'm proposing called
the Rem.
And so that's what this looks like on
this map. Uh And
it was proposed in
2016 and it
went from first
groundbreaking to
operating the first trains in
five years, which is
an extremely fast
timeline for North America
we tend to take, as I heard
earlier with all of the processes
we have to go to. Usually
it takes way longer to get something
in service. Um And
these trains are going to be running 20
hours a day, seven
days a week, up to
600 people on every
train, it's all
fully automated. Um
And there's another system that's been in
use for about 40 years
now in Vancouver,
in British Columbia called the Sky
Train, which uses just
the same technology. It's all
automated and it's
a huge transit success
story, like it's completely
reformed how the
city looks, how people get
around uh the
efficiency of its neighborhoods.
Um And so this is a really innovative
system that uses proven
technology to
improve transportation outcomes
for folks. And this initial
segment is
currently in operation
and the rest of it is slated to
open next year
through
2027.
So they chose a, a
sort of innovative
financing model. And
so the cost
increases associated with the project
because it was
uh being constructed like
right in the middle of COVID-19, right
when it struck, they had begun
construction. So they
faced supply chain delays
and they faced all kinds
of issues with uh
having to have workforces stay
home and yet they were
able to keep their costs
under control. And
so CD PQ
which is the firm is the
main investor. So they put the
most amount of money in
and the federal
government and the
government of Quebec, the
State province of
Quebec each put in an
equal amount. And the important
thing is that amount
never went up. So
what they invested was what they
invested and any
cost increases were
handled by CD
PQ, the firm. So
it protected folks
from having to be on the hook for
any issues that came up
as happens with huge
infrastructure projects.
And so their return
threshold as a firm is
about 8%
and they're forecasting, they're going to meet
that. And then for
the government partners, they're actually
gonna see a return too,
which usually does not happen.
Uh When you invest in a transit
project in the United States,
it's a grant, you invest
it and it gets built, but you're
not gonna actually see
the money that you gave as a grant
returned to you as the
government. Um But in
this case, you do you see
returns on your
investment.
And so I put something
very back of the math back
of the napkin math uh
for such a system
in New Mexico, this is
my best estimate. It
is based on a lot of
calculations I did. But I do
want to flag, you know,
actually coming up with a final
cost for something like this would probably
take a whole team of folks
who worked at this for
a long time. And
did a lot of work. But this
is my very, very
initial uh
number. And
so two of the
major contenders that I see
in New Mexico, that
kind of behave
similarly to CD
PQ up in Canada
are pera
of course for our public
employees and
the State Investment
Council and the Permanent Fund
which both have
tens of billions of dollars in
assets of their own.
And they have the same incentives
as C DB Q. He
A of course, needs to generate
stable and reliable returns
for pensioners and
retirees here in New Mexico.
And the State
Investment Council wants to
grow our
wealth fund. They want to keep
investing in economic
activity and growth in New
Mexico. The fund
exists for us,
right? The people of New Mexico
and they want to make prudent
investments. So
a system like this
with an agree with a
firm like CD PQ could
actually result in these
investments uh gaining
a return. So people who
pay for a ticket to the train,
pay a little bit of money
into the permanent fund,
pay a little bit of money into their
own retirement with Pera.
And it means when you
ride the rails, you're basically
helping your community.
Uh And I think it's a really, it
hasn't really been done in many
other places until
this previous project
in Canada. It's a very innovative
proposal uh
through what
is really like a public public
partnership, not necessarily
the same as a public private
but not putting all of
the onus on
going to the voters and saying,
hey, can we have hundreds of millions
of dollars or going
to have to, you
know, issue bonds or
loans that you have to get back?
It's much more, I think
financially protected
and infrastructure
tends to be a very stable
investment. Um, it is
a lot more stable than stocks
and securities. It's
a lot more stable
even than sometimes real estate
on its own. Um
So it's, it's been shown to
be a, a smart
investment.
And so I know that
the legislature and you all,
you have competing priorities.
So there's an open question of
why is this the project that
we should invest in or why should we
care about this?
And there's a lot of
significant data that shows
that transportation is
one of the most important factors
for escaping from poverty.
Um having access
to a job
interview to your shift
at work to send your
kid to school, to go
to the doctor, to
get your groceries,
to leave your house.
Uh If you don't have reliable
transportation, you're not
doing those things and
you're not really able to
participate in the economy
or be connected to those
around you, you kind of are
trapped and that
has resulted in a lot of negative
outcomes that have led to increased
poverty. Uh an
increased number of unhoused folks
who just can't afford to live
in their communities, they can't afford to
travel. Um
And I would say, you know, no
policy exists on its own.
All policies are connected
to each other. So choosing
to invest in transportation
is choosing to invest in your
neighborhoods. It's
investing in your community,
in housing and
services,
in densify
and keeping our cities
in the city and not
necessarily just
spreading and spreading
out into our rural areas.
Um And these are the
things that are our experts are
saying this quote here that
having access to transit and
services and jobs is
important to people. And that's
borne out in where people want
to live. 70%
of respondents to their surveys
said that they wanted to live in
an urban or semi
urban area and
that includes people who don't
currently live in that area.
Even people in suburbia said
the Majority of them,
they prefer to live in a more
urban setting
and just to close. Uh So
change is really necessary.
There's not really a choice. I
think in reforming
how people get around if we want
to address some of the
biggest problems we have
today, whether it's
climate change or pollution
or wasted time
in congested traffic.
If it's road safety,
if it's poverty, if it's
people having more affordable
housing, if it's having
neighborhoods that have more
services,
you have to change
your approach. Uh
And we can
see too on, on the map
here or on the graph
here. The amount of
people who were riding transit
in 2006
was the same as the
amount of people who are riding transit
in 2018. And it's
actually gone down
and this, of course, is partially
the fault of the pandemic. But if you
take this out and
go through to
2018, it
didn't even budge in the
end. And I
think there's a huge opportunity
to change that. And,
you know, we have looked
at the the option of of
expanding our roads and
highways, of building
more bridges, of widening
those lanes, of adding more
lanes. And
it's really
kind of an unsustainable
cycle that
the more road miles you
add, the more maintenance
you have to bear for those added
road miles, the more people
are encouraged or
forced only
to drive if you have
just road
infrastructure and
it puts the onus on
having to maintain what
you have, let alone
anything new that May
be built. And
it's not really gonna be in a
situation where you can
just perhaps
build our way out
of these problems with the
same systems
that we have been using
for the past 100 years.
And I feel hopeful.
Uh, there are a lot
of really, really dedicated
advocates around
the Albuquerque area up
north in Santa Fe, up,
down in Berlin
and down in Las Cruces who are
really saying we
can change things
and we can
think of big new
ideas and
commit to those ideas.
Um So I really
appreciate your time. Uh
I'm happy to answer any
questions you have
and you are
definitely uh feel free
to contact me. I'm
happy to give out my contact information
if you have any questions that I can
answer right here. But
just thank you again to
all the Members of the sub-committee
and the staff and everyone here
for inviting me to speak to you today. I
really appreciate
it.
>> Well, thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Lopez. Very, very
interesting
informative
and comprehensive
report.
And now we will turn to
the Members
of the Committee first up
is uh representative
uh Garrett.
>> Thanks Mr. Chair. Thank
you Benjamin.
Um as someone
very involved in transportation,
I think this will um
come to fruition. I have
a couple of questions.
Where is the
Western
Orange Line
station located?
What is that
dot there?
Where is it
physically?
>> Uh Yeah, so thank you Mr.
Chair and, and thank you for the question.
I believe that
that line ends actually
at the sort of
welcome center
and uh headquarters of
the Petroglyph National Monument,
which is basically right at the
edge of the city. So
that's kind of where the city ends
and the natural
landscape
begins.
>> Um because Mr. Chair as
a person who represents
the western end
of Berling County in
Albuquerque.
Um
I think it's important
to realize that you actually
couldn't put a station
there and
a Risco vista.
Um It's
further west Risco
vista is where Double Eagle
Two Airport is where
Mesa Movie
studios will be where
a new federal,
um,
federal Veterans
Memorial Cemetery will
be where Amazon is.
So just, you know,
this is an initial thing and I
think it's great,
but I think it's important
that if you continue
to work on it,
uh realize that the west
side doesn't end at
Coors Road, but
there's, there's
unser, there's a
Risco vista,
um 10 to 15
years from now, there May
be a, a
de VCA
that's out there.
Um So just
if you continue to work on
it and I would encourage you to do
so, I would
try to speak to
people
that represent those
areas because the
city has to grow westward.
It can't grow to
the mountains, it can't
grow north of
uh Sandia
Pueblo, it can't grow
south of
Isleta. So just, just some
considerations to
put in. Um
what agency are you working
for with the transportation
analysis, May
I ask? >> Uh
Yes. So I actually
am a public
policy analyst with
Amtrak. Uh
And I'm working out of their
headquarters in Washington DC,
but I do want
to make sure that
I put in the caveat that this
is a strictly personal
project uh my job
wants to maintain
very clear boundaries between
my work work and my
personal work. Um,
but that is, and it's kind of a
different level of
railroading as
well. Uh Amtrak
does like long
distance, you know, city to city
type of rail. They don't
actually do any construction
of, you know, a metro
system, but that is,
that is my, my job
position and I appreciate your, your
feedback. I, I
definitely agree. Uh
It's, I would absolutely
say a first pass.
Um and I am just one
person, but I,
I part of the reason that I
wanted to hear about this from,
from the Members of the
Committee as well as for great
feedback like that because,
you know, your communities
and you know, your neighborhoods and,
and I think that's really, really
helpful when it comes to
deciding where
people want to
go. So thank you
for that. >> Right? And Mr.
Taran, we thank you for
doing this. And I asked
because I think that's a great
counterpoint and
everybody in the legislature
since we're not a paid legislature
explain, understands
about the separation
between, you
know, what
our various hats are.
But um that Amtrak
experience is terrific.
I'm glad that you got to the position
anyway. Thank you so much for
this innovative,
thoroughly research
process. Thank you.
>> Thank
you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you
representative, except we have
a representative Katz.
>> Uh Thank you Chair and thank
you very much. For your presentation.
I was wondering if it was
um uh I have
individuals in the
community that are
very much interested in this project,
just taking pictures
here while you're presenting and
sending to them. They're already
excited. Um
uh uh Can
you provide contact
information
uh to our analysts
so that if they need to reach
out to you by email
and also any contact
information about the organization's
strong towns that you
mentioned as well.
Um
Because uh this is
gonna be an ongoing
project. And so
thank you very much.
>> Yes, Mr. Chair
and, and representative, thank you very much.
I, I would be happy to
provide that
information. Again. I, I want
to stress I
am, I'm not,
you know, acting in a, in a firm,
I don't have a team, it's just
me. Um But
I really, the great
thing is I love
talking to people who know more
about these things even than I
do. Um And
who are active
and involved and I, I
love getting their feedback. I, I
spoke to folks at the
uh Midre
organization and a
group called together for
Brothers in Albuquerque that
advocates for transit
equity. So they are
really involved, you know, and, and
I, I hope that
I can get those, those
supportive arms to lean on as
well. So yes, I'm happy
to provide that information
uh after the
fact.
>> Thank you for wishing
to
a or question.
Uh No, thank you for being
here. I have a question
uh correct me if I'm wrong,
it is rail three
times more expensive than rubber
tired.
>> Um Mr. Chair,
if you're referring to, I think
a like a
bus on
the Street or
definitely, I would say
it's clear that the
construction costs are significantly
higher. Um But
actually one of the things that our
organizations have pointed
out, Rio Metro pointed
this out, uh the
metropolitan organization pointed
it out is that one of the
big equalizers
or difference makers is actually
the operational costs.
So the sort of
automated system I'm referring
to as a
very low relative
operational cost,
even as it comes at a
higher capital cost
than a bus, for
example. Um
And you know, you have to think about, there
are the costs of
hiring drivers of
fueling the of
replacing the road,
of maintaining
the buses, of
also um
replacing those bus
vehicles. They have to be replaced about
every 12 years.
And that actually added about
$500
million to the cost
of operating an expanded
bus network over 30
years. But I also want
to point out as a caveat,
I am in favor of the
bus. I love
taking the bus here in Washington
DC. It can go
places for example, where the
train cannot go.
Um And it serves a lot
of people. And so for
me, it's really more of an
and than an
or, and I think
that, you know, any
change we make to the
transportation network
cannot come at the expense
of the bus system that
so many people rely
on. >> Well, I'm
not against, not
against the rapid
rail, but just
briefly.
So you're stay in the long, over
the long run
on. It's
ok
cheaper in the, even though
it's more expensive
to construct, it's cheaper in the
long run.
>> Yes, especially if you have
a system that
does not employ
human operators.
So for example, you know, if you
have multiple multiple
operators driving
the trains that
results in significant costs,
whereas, and it invites human
error as well.
Um But a lot of this
statistics
show that
the automated systems that are in
place around the world have
almost perfect safety
records and
extremely accurate on
time performance
and very low operating
costs.
>> Oh, actually, I was in
Montreal a couple months
ago. It's
1.8 million
people. We only
have uh the
count Rio Rancho,
we're talking about
700,000
people. So
they're only gonna build 42
miles and you're proposing 100
miles. So they got three
times the population and you're
proposing
2.5 times more
rail. That doesn't make
sense.
>> Uh Thank you for, for uh
that insight Mister Chair. But I
also wanted to
say that uh Montreal
has already a metro
that's been in operation for about
50 years. So this
extra 42 miles of rail
that they're building there is
effectively doubling the
size of their current network that's
in operation. And
when you think about the
size of the
Albuquerque Metro that
spans from here
up to about Santa Fe
and then down to about
the Berlin area, it
is approaching a million
residents. And I I would
say, you know,
it's, it's kind of a chicken or egg
situation. So
cities like Denver and Salt
Lake that we often look
to as like
aspirational peers
that have great population
growth and they have so many jobs
and services and amenities.
They were not always the
size that they are today. And I actually
recall, I used to travel
up to Denver all the time to see
my uncle. Um
There used to be a big gulf
between Colorado Springs
and Denver of open
wilderness, right?
And over the past 15
years or so, more
and more kind of
urban environment has encroached
and sort of almost brought those
two cities to meet
each other into like one
megacity, but >> that's
not happening in New Mexico
>> and perhaps >> the population.
>> No, I appreciate that. And,
and the fact that population growth
in New Mexico is, is not nearly
as high. But one of the
questions that I have
personally pondered is,
is it because we
don't undertake
sometimes a major
infrastructure project like that
to, to change
our, our transportation network,
for example, in
Salt Lake, uh at
the end of the 19 nineties, they
actually decided to build
a light rail network
that has now contributed
significantly to the growth of
the city. And
Denver had did the same.
And I feel that it, it
can also provide
the opportunity to
encourage people
to live in your
city or State. >> I'm not
against
um rapid
rail, but I think
you're
a little, a little
unrealistic plan
because we're not growing
in New Mexico.
Look at all the pushback we got
on that. Uh
our system, people
are still complaining about it. And
one time I was out campaigning,
I got into an argument
with the
door and he
thought it was the dumbest idea you
ever heard of?
And I was arguing, it was a good
idea. So finally I said to the
guy, if you're so damn
smart, why don't you run for Senate
and he kicked through me off his
property. So
I never went. So I mean,
that's, this
is not a very
sophisticated
city.
People in New Mexico don't like
change. The
phrase is very quick. Oh,
this cost
it cost us $100 million
for that nine
miles. OK. So if
you extrapolate
that,
so the rail would cost three times
that. So that's $300 a
mile, mile times
100
you're talking, how many billions of
dollars? Where are we gonna get this
money?
>> I appreciate that. Uh Mr.
Chair, those are things that are really
necessary to consider. And I
mean, I would also remind
that the proposal
that I put forward is kind of like the
maximal
uh idea, the,
the ideal
situation if you know, people
were able to get around as, as
quickly as they could. And it's
one of those, you know, superstar
cities like Montreal
or here in Washington.
Um but I would point out, you
know, the cost of
keeping things the same
carries its own negative
consequences.
And I think that
people always
and this is just kind of the case when
you make a change.
As you said, people
get upset at
change. And I think that one of the
most important things
that happened during the
process of constructing the
art bus was
that there was a lot
of negative
media coverage that
focused on businesses
suffering. It focused on the
fact that the road was
being changed and torn up
and you know, well, of course, the road
was being changed and torn up, you
were building a new thing.
Um But I think that
there have to be
people who are
able to kind of hit the
streets, get out
there and advocate
for why things
are good. So for
example, one of the things that they
did on that Montreal system
is they allowed the public
to act access
these model versions of
the rail cars, they
almost set up like a mini
museum of what it
could do for the region.
And I think that those types
of careful considerations
are what can mov'e
public opinion. And of course,
I can't answer
to absolutely everything that you
could or would do to
help allay people's
concerns, but you
have to meet people where they
are, you know, and I appreciate
that and I think
that any change
that allows people to mov'e more
easily and get around
uh is worth considering even
if it's not as
maximal as the one that I brought
to all of you today. But
II, I am very aware of,
of those serious challenges
and I, I appreciate that
insight.
>> Well, thank you. I didn't mean to give you a hard
time. I like to play devil's
advocate.
So I'm impressed that you
went to Brown, but you must be
a smart guy,
people have said. So I don't know. I,
I lived in Connecticut and
worked in Rhode Island
um briefly.
So
downtown the
Providence is an interesting
city. Of
course,
it was right on the edge of
downtown.
And um what's that thing they
have on the river? But
they at night they like
to. >> Oh,
yeah. Um >> The
river something, >> river
fire I think is, that's really cool.
>> Do you see
that? Really cool, isn't
it? Yeah. Ok.
Well, maybe they could.
Uh
um Well, ok.
No more questions, right?
Thanks for being here.
Interesting,
um
thoughtful
uh
presentation
and
thank you. Thanks again.
>> Thank you. I, I
think
there might be one person
waiting uh with a raised
hand as
well.
I just want to make sure I don't neglect
anyone's
questions.
>> Oh,
yes.
Ok. Well, thanks
again for being here and
uh good luck. To you.
>> Thank you all very much. I appreciate
it.
>> We have
a, you'll be
interested to know we have one com
one public comment on
Zoom and
I guess the
the uh
her name is Natalie
Miller.
So Natalie, go
ahead.
>> Thank you. Can you hear me?
Ok? >> Yeah.
Yes,
>> excellent. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman madam,
vice Chair and Committee Members
for hearing us today.
I am Natalie Miller.
I'm the brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers and trainman,
auxiliary National Second
Vice President and Legislative
Representative.
I say thank you for hearing
us.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I said thank you for hearing
us because I
represent the extended
families of over
51,000
active and retired
blet Members
nationwide
that includes the families
and extended families
of 517
blet Members
and countless railroad
families from other crafts
in New Mexico.
I also represent the
communities of New Mexico
where our railroaders operate
trains and the
passengers they carry.
We applaud the hard work
of brother Clem Harris
and that of all of our
union representatives who have
put all of the hard
work into the rail safety
Legislation proposed.
We also want to thank all
of the Committee Members
for their excellent work
for the people of New
Mexico. We
appreciate that you are listening
to the people who drive
and conduct the trains
daily. Hold
on a minute, please. I
apologize.
The
how
find,
sorry my dogs decided
that they wanted to play while I
gave my testimony.
Stop it.
Sorry about that. I
apologize. We
appreciate that you are listening to
the people who drive
and conduct the trains
daily. When considering
Legislation that builds
a safer and better
passenger and freight
rail service in New Mexico.
We support this rail safety
Legislation which is
supported by a bar bipartisan
group of State representatives and
Senators. Similar
Legislation on the federal
level. Specifically,
the Railway Safety Act of
2023
was coss sponsored by United
States Senator Sherrod
Brown, a
democrat
and JD Vance, the
Republican vice presidential
candidate. They
cosponsor this bill
because they agree
that railroad and public safety
are bipartisan
issues to
quote my brother Harris from
earlier today,
derailments will happen in
a Democrat neighborhood,
the same as a Republican
neighborhood.
Moving forward with this
railway safety Legislation
will put New Mexico in the
lead pack of states
whose laws will hold railroads
accountable for keeping
their safety practices up to
date and State
of the art and
just as State of the art
as they make their technological
advances in operations.
This Legislation
will hold them accountable
when they violate those
laws and put
employee and public
safety at risk.
Especially when a
catastrophic worst case
scenario occurs
with the recent Supreme Court
decision reversing the
Chevron deference standard.
The class one railroads are
looking for every possible
way to fight the
regulations and safety rules
set forth by the Federal
railroad administration
and are already filing
legal challenges to the two
person crew mandate.
We need these federal
regulations to be
put into law
at the State and federal
levels to prevent the railroads
from using the Chevron
deference decision to
ignore federal
rules and safety
regulations.
They will always look for a
scapegoat or
a third party to blame.
So it, it is also
essential to include
the the true transportation
Legislation in railway
safety.
The railroad employees
safety should be the
responsibility
of the employers
from the moment they are
signed on duty for that
job including
during the transport from the
railroad depot to
the train and from the
train to their place
of rest on the other end of the
road,
including the safe
transport of our train
crews. In this Legislation
is also groundbreaking.
Combined with similar
Legislation passed into law
in Minnesota. It
will help set a precedent
as we fight for these
safety laws throughout the
country.
In closing
along with the employee
safety issues and mechanical
problems, the
commuting and logistic
nightmares,
the safety issues of
entire towns being blocked
off by the longer
slower trains.
First responders not being
able to get to emergencies
and Children walking to
school, climbing
under trains that are blocking
crossings for more extended
periods. I would
like to point out one more
fact regarding the
importance to limiting
train length that might be
overlooked
when the railroads put
two or three
trains together to make one
long train. They
forced one crew
of two qualified crew
Members to operate
those double or triple
trains
essentially
already skirting
around the fa two
person crew rule
requiring two qualified
crew Members on one
train. Don't
be fooled when they try to sell
the argument
that longer trains equal
less congestion
and fewer cars on the
tracks.
Long trains still have
the same number of cars,
motors and knuckles
coupling them as
two or three regular
trades. Those
cars and motors don't just
disappear. They
are now one nightmare of a
train that moves
slower is more
likely to break down.
And when it does, it will
block more than one
crossing. And in some
cases, entire towns
when they do
don't be fooled when it comes
to long trains, one
plus one plus
one really does
equal three
as New Mexico
builds a more robust
and better rail. Railway
infrastructure,
safety has to be at
the forefront.
And we ask that you support
the Railway Safety Act
and the Crew Transportation
amendments in the Motor Carrier
Safety Act with it.
I thank you for your service to New
Mexico and I
thank you for your time
today.
>> Well, thank you, Miss Miller for
your testimony.
Thanks for being here. Have a good
weekend. >> You as
well.
>> So that
concludes
anyone in the audience wishing to
speak
or ask questions, hearing
none. I guess
this concludes
the meeting. The meeting.
