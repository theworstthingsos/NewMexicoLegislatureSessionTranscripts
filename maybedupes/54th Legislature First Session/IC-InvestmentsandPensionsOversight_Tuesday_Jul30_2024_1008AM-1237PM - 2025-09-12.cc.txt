Good morning,
everyone.
How do you like this
place? It's
gorgeous. Yes,
and so, first and foremost,
um I wanted
to
apprise the Members of the
Committee
and um those
listening and in the
audience that
our Chair,
Senator Bobby Gonzalez will
not be with us this morning and
I will be assuming that
the duties and presiding over
this meeting today as vice
Chair. Um
He had a medical
emergency. He's fine,
but uh
it was unexpected.
So that's announcement.
Number one,
number two, I want to thank
um
Casa Roena for hosting
us today and in
particular Mr. Jim Gay,
where is Mr. Jim Gay
there? He is the
CEO of
Casa Roena.
Thank you for hosting us
today. Thank
you.
And we're gonna
um
for the information
purposes,
I'd like to see. I know you've
been signing in,
but I'd like to gauge
um a show of hands
of everyone that
is in the audience that
wishes, that's
here physically in the meeting
that wishes to make public
comment today.
I
OK.
So we have a keep your hands
up,
ok. So we're looking
at about 10 to 12
people uh
physically here right
now at this moment and then
online we will
have
um
probably some right.
All right. So what
I'm thinking of doing so that
we're not here and
longer than what we
planned on doing, being
here. I am
going to ask our
presenters who they
already the the
presenters, number one and
number two already
give us really thorough
and succinct
presentations.
Um If you would keep
with that timing
in mind when you
come to make your presentation,
because what I'd like to do
is break up public
comment. Uh
to
be right after
the number two on our
agenda.
And right before lunch,
I will
try to get as
many public comment before
that. And
then uh we'll
continue public
comment after our
number five on the agenda
as, as
already listed.
And the reason I want to do that
is I don't want to
um
overstay our welcome.
And um
we had already said that
we would be out of here
around four o'clock.
So that's what I'm trying to
gauge and I know there will be other
individuals coming in
that are interested in giving public
comment as well.
So that's a little bit of
housekeeping uh Before
we continue.
And at this point, I
I'd like to go ahead and
officially call
the meeting to
order
and
begin with
um introductions.
So again, I'm
Patricia Roybal
Caballero and I will be
chairing today. I represent
House District 13. I'm giving
you my
introduction because it's
not part of
uh what we
normally do uh with
our Chair being here.
But anyway, I will go ahead
and ask um

So we'll go ahead and begin
with the uh first item on
the agenda, which
is uh David
Auletta if
you would come forward and
begin your presentation. Thank
you.
>> Ok
with me today. I, I have our
deputy director Mr. Lawrence
Esquivel, as well as our
general counsel, Mr.
Randall Cherry with me to help answer any
questions that I might not
be able to answer for
you. Uh But I'll, I'll
try to be short with the present
short and clear with the presentation
uh on slide two or
just a list of the topics that I'll be
discussing today.
Uh I'm going to use a bit
of a crutch with me today
since I don't remember
all the statistics aso
associated with what we're going to be referencing
here. But I thought it would provide some
helpful background
information about some
of the items as a follow up that we discussed
at the last meeting and to
start with on page
three.
We're listing some information that
we found on the on the website for the
American Academy of
Actuaries. Uh
According to a
2007 Government
Accountability Office report
on State and local government pension
plans uh portraying
80% as a de facto
benchmark for the healthy
pension system.
Attributing that criteria to
an unidentified public
sector experts and
stakeholders for
private sector pension plans. Federal
law uses an 80%
funded ratio as a trigger
point for certain changes.
The Pension Protection Act of
2006 limits
benefit improvements lump
sum payments. The use of
advanced funding balances
for private sector single employer
plans based on an 80%
funded ratio of assets
to the funding
target. Also under
this multi employer plans
use 80% funding
below which are stricter
funding rules become
effective in the past
credit rating, credit
raging rating agencies. I'm
sorry. Um And I think
this is something that we lean on here
have used various funded ratios
including 80% as a
general indicator
of a public pension plans,
financial health S
and P global ratings, for example,
issued a report in 2017
that identified plans
with the funded ratio below
80% to have
elevated unfunded
obligations. It's
also important to note
that the actual funding methods
generally are designed with a target
of 100% funding,
not 80%. So
I hope that provides a little bit of context
for the direction that we're moving
and why we have our funding standards
and how important the
cost of living adjustment and the impact
of that is uh to the
retire to the education retire
program. If
you turn a page slide or if you turn
a slide four, this is just uh some
information uh that
we obtained from the National Association
of State Retirement Administrators
uh group that uh
uh Mr. Trujillo over at
the Public Employers Retirement Association
and I are a part of, we actually be
attending their annual
conference later this
week. Uh This
group provides a lot of
great information, does a lot of
research. Uh You
May recall that Mr.
Brainard, the research director
there presented to this Committee
last summer regarding
fiduciary responsibility
and the governance of of a
board structure. Um
They presented some information
here that you can see on, on
slide four. In
summary, since
2009 17 states
have changed their cola uh
that affect those retirees for
both uh retired folks
as well as future plan
participants. Uh
as far as challenges are
concerned to those changes,
you can see that most of those
have been upheld and we'll talk a little
bit about that as it relates
to the Education Retirement
Board in the next couple of
slides here
on page five.
again, citing the
National Association
on National
Association of State Retirement
Administrators or, or
NASRA, they list
out the commonly
referred to uh cost
of living adjustments that we
have. And in summary,
er, B's cola is
automatic, it is
set in statute. There are
a couple of things that we'll point out
here. Er B
also er B
compound uh Cola
also compounds.
Uh er B COLA is
also inflation
based. Uh er
B's COLA is somewhat performance
based which you'll see on
slide six reference
there uh to a slightest
extent it's somewhat
tied to our actual
funded level.
Abs Cola is delayed. Uh
What they refer to is that
delayed onset or minimum age of
65 for tiers one and
two and 67 for
tiers three and four, some
changes that came about more than
a decade ago. And
uh air coal is not limited to on
a benefit basis or offer any
sort of self funded annuity
option or have a reserve
account for, for their increases
in the future
going through this fairly quickly
on page seven, just so
that I break this down and obviously you guys
can read what's on the document. So I
don't misstate anything. I'm gonna go ahead
and read the way the coal is
calculated for us.
Our coal is based on the
change in CP I.
If the change in CP I is less
than 2% the coal is
equal to the change in CP
I. If the change in CP
I is greater than 2% the coal is
equal to one half of the change
in CP I, but not
less than 2%. No more
than 4% In
2013 coals for all current
retirees were reduced until
er B is 100%
funded when the funded
ratio is 90% or
less. The caller for retirees
whose annuity is at
or below the medium
retirement benefit
and who have 25 or
more years of service credit
at retirement will
be reduced by 10%
for all other retirees reduction
is 20%
when the funded ratio exceeds
90% and is less
than 100%. The cola
for the retirees who have 25 years
or more service credit at
retirement and whose
annuity is at or below the
medium retirement benefit
will be reduced by
5% for all of the retirees.
The reduction is 10%.
Uh the 2013 legislative
reduced clas uh the,
the reduction in 2013
was challenged but the changes were
upheld by the new Mexico Supreme
Court.
If you look at slide
eight
here,
I found this sort of
obscure piece of paper
in the office. It looked like it had been
written up on a typewriter
but it listed out the cola and
we, we popped that into a little chart
here that you can see that goes back to
1979 or
between 1979 and
2012.
Uh, in 79 and
80
the cola were adjusted
by 2% and received
after the fifth year of retirement.
In 1981 there
was the first time that CP I was
used for an ad hoc and an
ad hoc increase of
$2 for each year
of retirement.
In 1984 it was 2%
for those less than 65
years of age with an
effective retirement date
prior to June 1st of
1984.
In 1987 an
ad hoc pop-up was
approved increasing that benefit
by $3.50
for each year of retirement
plus 1.9%
to 2% for retirees who
are, who had retired
prior to June 1st of
1984.
And then in 1991 an ad
hoc for every year of retirement
of $1.
If you turn to page seven,
following some of the changes that
occurred. Uh
in 2013, you can
see the cost of living
adjustments between
2013 and
2024.
Uh following the pension reforms
that came about as a result to Senate, a
bill of 115 and
the range of Cola of a low
of
0.08%
in 2016 to have a
high of 3.2% in
2023.
Uh There was a, a
Typo on the online
version of this that showed 96%
under there, but it was
0.9
0.96%.
So my apologies
this last year,
those folks that received the
disability uh cost of living
adjustment. There were 773
Members. Uh Those
folks with the uh those
folks below the medium and
adjusted annuity, there
were 2856
people that fell into that bucket.
And then all the other folks uh
that received the 1.68%
a little over 42,000
Members uh fell into that
category
on page 10.
Just some helpful information I
think for folks is just a little chart
going back to 1984
showing the number of retirees
816,462
back in 1984
with an average benefit of
$430 per
month. And then you can see
those in incremental
increases uh throughout the
years. As we reported
in 2023
we had more than
54,774
people receiving a retirement
benefit from us at an
average monthly benefit of
just under $2100 per
month
on page 11. Uh
just to make this Committee aware
and obviously I, I believe we'll
probably be invited back at some point in
time to discuss this. We'll have some
legislative proposals
uh coming forward for
you. Uh This bill isn't
going to be a very attractive bill.
Uh It's going to come forward with
some technical language corrections
that I'm sure no one is going to enjoy
listening to or hearing, but
certainly welcome any
support that you guys are willing to give. And
it's basically just to clarify some
items that we have in statute
and uh adjust those
accordingly. Uh One of
which is being able to share information
be between us and the Public
Employees Retirement Association.
We're still working out the details
associated with what we're gonna
be proposing, but hope to
come before this Committee later this
year to discuss those
items if
you turn to page 12.
Uh I think one of the questions
that's commonly asked is what would
happen if we gave you a
chunk of money
if you gave us.
Um you know, based upon
our, our current funded status
today and what we estimate that to be
as of June 30 as of
this year. Uh based
on that baseline projection. If we received
$9 billion next
year, it would mov'e our
funded ratio from uh the
estimated 66%.
It is today to
100%. If
we receive $250
million it would mov'e us
to a 60% 67%
funded ratio. And
obviously, you can see the different amounts
associated with what it would take to get us
to a fully funded uh
scenario if
we receive those lump sum dollars.
So even if we
receive the entire surplus of the State
budget, uh you can see that
we'd still be a good distance from
where that 100%
funded uh scenario that
we're working
toward.
If you turn to page
13,
just a couple of uh
just a brief mention because I think it's
important to, to put this in
perspective, there have been a number of changes
over the last decade that
have helped
that have served to improve.
Put us on a on a
more sustainable path
and uh an improved
funding trajectory. Uh
Right now as of
last year, our current
projected status was in 26
years. We're expected to become fully
funded assuming that all the
variables that are plugged into that
actuarial analysis hold
true. We continue to
generate a 7% return on
investment. Inflation continues
uh at around 2%.
Uh We continue to grow
the number of Members that we have
assuming all those things hold
uh accurate will be fully
funded in 26 years.
I think this year we'll probably see a one
year, maybe a twoyear
improvement. Uh But that's
the result of an increase in
contributions made
by employees by the
employers and a reduction to
the cost of living adjustments that
were that have been issued to
actual retirees
if you turn to page
14.
Uh
the last item on the subject,
the last time the employer,
our second and last time the employer
contribution was increased as a result,
the Senate Bill 42
boosted that
the the employer
contribution from 14.15%
to 16.15%.
But in addition to that, the
bill required us to go
back and look at what other
options do we have for improving the
solvency, absent and
increase in employer contributions and
revenue received from the State.
Uh So we looked at, you know,
basically considerations
of all the changes
that have already occurred.
What could we additionally leverage?
One of those was further
adjusting the cost of living adjustment
downward uh for future
plan participants if
we received an increase in
employee contributions, if
that went up from the 10.7%
that people uh contribute
right now, if we
reduced out the service
multiplier, which has already been reduced
under the tier four status down
to 1.35%
for folks in the 1st 10 years of their
service. Um
and a number of other items that you
see sort of listed here.
Now, none of those, none of those were
further explored and you haven't
seen a bill proposed as a result
of that because according
to our last actuarial analysis,
we're on, we're on the
funding path that we need to be
based on the board's decision
to adopt a
funding period back in
2019. So
again, we're on a sustainable path
based on the information that we know as
of today.
And with that, I think that
is my last slide.
I would stand for any
questions.
>> Yeah,
Mr. That way you take
care of my off.
Thank you.
So, before we proceed,
I'd like to make um just
a couple of
acknowledgements.
One on
our Committee, we have uh Senator
Greg Nibert who
is with us via Zoom,
so he's unable to attend,
but he will, he is zooming
in and he most
likely will be engaged in
our meeting today.
And next, I'd like to go
ahead and ask uh Representative
Lundstrom to introduce
herself.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Good morning,
everyone. My name is Patty
Lundstrom. I serve
in house district nine.
I've been there since
2001
and I really appreciate being able
to participate. Thank you,
madam Chair. >> Thank
you. And
um, so we'll go
ahead and mov'e on to
the Committee for questions
and we first on the list
is Senator
Steens.
>> Thank you madam Chair
and thank you
Mr. Archuleta for your
presentation. It's good
to see you
the, when P
er A um
changed their cola.
This is in relation to
page 14
when pu A
changed their cola. My
concern had at that
time and I have
other concerns today, but my
concern at that time were for
people who
might be
um 65
and older who were
at uh, wages
below the median
and how that could be
accommodated. So when
your board talks about
any
um changes,
I would ask that you please
keep in mind
those individuals who
not might not be making
a good wage, a
living wage uh
and then qualify for
snap and other
benefits, which
I think are many people in
our State. So I
understand your last
comment was things
seem to be good right now.
But if your board
continues to discuss,
discuss such actions,
let's keep in mind there are
people who
aren't rich on their
retirement. That's my only
comment. Thank you very much madam
>> Chair.
Next on the list we have
Representative Alan
Martinez.
>> Thank you madam Chair and
uh Mr. Archuletta. I
always enjoy your
presentations.
Um I have
a couple of questions
on
page three.
Uh You make this statement
that using an 80%
funded ratio as a
benchmark
for whether pension plans
are healthy is
inappropriate.
Why
>> madam Chair Representative Martinez, I'm
stealing this information directly from
the website for the American Academy
of Actuaries, the American
Academy of Actuaries. Uh sort
of dictates the rules that we use
that we apply to
um our
actuarial reports that we
present to you. And
this information comes directly
from there because there's if
you just do a simple Google of,
you know, the last presentation
that we had, um, there
was some question around like, well, you're at
63% funded. Why
would we not, you know, that
seems to be relatively healthy for a
mature pension plan? Why would we not
increase the cost of living adjustments
or improve the benefits that retirees
have? And I would tell you that we
still have that $9 billion
unfunded liability. And I think
that this, I was just trying to
set sort of the reference
for why it is that we're aiming for
that fully funded
status.
>> Thank you madam Chair. I think,
I think that
goal is
appropriate,
but I'm I'm just
the next
bullet says there's, there's
no line, there's,
I mean
are different pension
plans
judged differently.
II, I just don't understand
those two
comments, >> madam Chair
Representative Martinez, I, I believe
for the most part, all pension
plans are aiming for
a 100% funded
status. Uh Most
public pension plans that we
associate with that we communicate
with and based on the standards
we see according to NASRA,
uh all set that target of
100% some are at 100%
some are trying to maintain 100%
some are over 100%.
Uh like we'll hear from uh
next week
and you know, some are
100 and 5% and, and don't
provide an extra cola or don't even
provide a cola to begin with.
Uh So they sort of set their own
standards and obviously there's
concerns around investment returns,
retirements and so forth.
Um So I can't say that there's
any, there
isn't an organization that says
this is what needs to be,
I think for us,
you know, as we look at it, we're
63% funded
some of the liabilities we have
that $9 billion gets spread
out to the employer groups. We have, we
have 220 employer groups,
all public school districts,
universities and so forth
every year. They have to report a
portion of the liabilities
that we have on their financial
statements. And our goal
is to eliminate that being a
part of their balance sheet.
>> Thank you, madam Chair and
Mret. So, in your opinion,
is that
63% is the
fund
healthy
>> madam Chair, Representative
Martinez. I believe
that as
important as its current
status is its
projected status. And what
we can anticipate uh sort
of based off of the increase in employer
contributions that we received over
the last couple of years. So
we have uh what I
believe to be a path
toward being
healthy, healthier.
Um It's, it's
um and include this
on the, on the presentation, but it's
been in the 60%
range for a number of
years. Some of the
lack of employer
and employer contributions.
Um those contributions
have been made up with investment
earnings. Uh but we can
expect that to be a sustainable
path in the future.
Hence convincing the
legislature and the Governor to increase
the employee and employer or the employer
contribution
recently.
>> Thank you madam Chair and Mr.
Archuletta. And, and
just one last
question, uh
your third bullet
point on page
three,
pension plans are
generally better
evaluated on the
strategy in place to attain a
funded ratio of 100%
within a reasonable
period of time,
who determines
what a reasonable period of
time. >> Madam,
Chair Representative Martinez. In this case,
I would suggest that it is our board
of directors, our board
of trustees as fiduciaries
over the plan. Uh They
established that funding period of reaching
100%
within 30 years back in
2019. And that
was before. Yeah, that was that
goal was communicated as part
of this is our
effort to convince the legislature
to give us additional funding
via the employer
contribution. So was the board's
responsibility. >> So
madam Chair Mr.
Cetto, so the board will
say a
reasonable time is
50
years
>> madam Chair, Representative Martinez.
I I
suspect the board would
probably go with
what it is recommended by
staff and staff would go
by based upon what's recommended
by its consulting
actuaries and there would be
considerable discussion about that,
but 50 years would probably
seem a little bit unreasonable.
We wouldn't expect
uh same
as having a 50 year mortgage
payment that's they
don't exist and we're sort of
in that same category,
I believe.
>> Thank you madam Chair, Mr.
Archuletta. Um I
appreciate the answers and,
and always uh
I appreciate the information
that you provided. Thank you madam
Chair. >> Thank you,
representative. Uh Next
on the list, we have Representative
Lundstrom and then
Representative
R.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Just a couple
of quick questions. I'm
also looking at page
three. when
we talk about
evaluation of the
strategy for the pension
plan? What is the percentage of growth
you're looking at now for
plan
when you put together a
strategy? What's that percentage
growth?
>> Madam madam, Chair Representative
Lum, I'm not sure I understand
what, what's
the percentage growth our investment return?
>> You know, what is your projected
when you put together your
strategy
and you take it to your board?
What are you recommending?
Is it 5%? Is
it 8%? What
is it? >> So madam Chair Representative
Lundstrom in terms of investment performance,
uh are, are
the,
the rate that we use is 7%.
>> So you're using seven percent,
you're using >> 7% and there haven't
been any recommended changes in the
number of years to that 7%.
>> Ok. The next question
I had madam Chair
was,
it's a question
related on page 11
on cost of living adjustments,
eligibility and so
forth.
Um because
we're talking about retirees.
Have you done a comparison
or any thought around what
social security cost
of living adjustments have
been? >> Madam Chair,
Representative Lundstrom? No.
Uh we have not
that's sort of independent and the
proposed language
or the proposal that we'll have coming
for this year doesn't
propose to adjust the
cost of living that we provide
any of the employees. Uh We're
not,
in my opinion, we're not in a, in a
situation
financially to be able to
recommend
an improvement to the benefit. >> I
think for me though madam
Chair, one of the issues is that
I think it was as high as 9%
a year ago for
social security increase
and ours I think this year
is 0.5
percent. That is a
major
difference in
what we're provi
what we're providing versus
what the federal government is.
I think that creates
um in our State
some, some
challenges
when we see that kind of
difference. I think
it's important for the, for the
Committee to know that
it's as high as 9%. And I
think at one time it was
11. That's
all I have. Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you, representative.
Uh Next is
Representative Rehm. Followed by
representative
um
Serato and then
represented
Breo.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Um On
page 13 when I look
at the contributions.
So the employer is
contributing
18.15%
and the employee is
contributing
10.7%
for a total of
28.85%.
That's the current
funding
that's coming from the employee,
correct, >> madam Chair representative. That
is correct. Ok.
>> And madam Chair,
um
what year do you
project that
your fund will be
100%
funded?
>> Um Madam Chair
representative and, and I'm sorry,
I'm gonna back up here. Uh
It's 10.7%
for those that make over $25,000
a year. And I think the vast Majority
now do otherwise. It's
7.9%.
But as far as uh so
26 years from now, basically
in 2052
I think is what we're expected to be
100%
funded.
>> And madam Chair,
I think that's real important
for us to look
at. Um
I'm going to do the same thing with
Pera here in a minute when they
come up, but
I think that's
unrealistic and I
would like to see that period
shortened. But anyway, that's
all my comments. Thank
you,
>> Representative
Representative Serrato.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Thank you
um present presenter. Um
Appreciate you answering all our questions
and with a lot um when I'm looking
at page nine, can you just help
me understand that a little bit more? You have
the, the cola history
from 2013 to 2024.
And you say that the, the cola for
disability retirement adjustments
would be at 2%.
And then for those
of 25 years
of service, it would be a
1.8%. I'm
curious what, what, what
that difference is for
and I know you probably went over it
in slide seven, but we kind of went
fast. So I was just kind of curious you walk
me through that. >> So madam Chair,
Representative Serato. So I think
back in, you know,
2011, 2012,
2013, there was a lot of
uh nipping and tucking
as far as the benefit is
concerned. I think
contributions at that point in time were
just over
13.9%. It bumped
up to 14.15%.
The employer contribution so
insufficient to support
the benefit they were providing.
So part of that was they looked
at the cost of living adjustment
instead of applying it to everyone
across the board, they kind of
broke it up. Those folks that are
disabled, uh less
harm to those, that's why they get
a larger portion of the,
of the cost of living adjustment.
Those people that fall below
the median in any given
year receive a
slightly lower uh
benefit. And then those
folks that are kind of the median,
I'll get the the smallest
cost of living adjustment.
>> Uh And thank you,
Chairman, thank you uh present
her and you don't. But there's
no essentially what would have
been the, the National
Cola on here or
is what is provided
to the disability retirement
eligible ones. Is that the same as
what would have been at the considered at the
national level?
Like a like a Social Security cola I
should say >> madam Chair
representative. So it would have been all based
off the CPI A
portion of CP I. >> So
madam Chair uh presenter.
So that means that uh so this
is still all of this is just a
portion of what that CP I is.
So, and, and I think
the answer is no and it's ok because I, I
know I'm asking a different question but um
we don't have an estimate
as to over since let's say
2013 or since 2015
or since any amount of time.
How much below the
CP I these collas have
fallen over that period of time.
Do we have an estimate of that >> madam
Chair representative? So that we could go
back and calculate that I I don't
have it with us. It's
obviously a portion of our
fraction. >> And thank you madam
Chair and thank you for, for that. And last
question just should we do
that also be
compounded as well? Just
given that, you know, with inflation everything
else, I guess AC P I includes
that. So >> madam
Chair representative. So I believe so.
So it's going to be since
2013, the highest they're going to
get is 80% of what CP
I would have been up to a
maximum of 4%. So it's always going
to be less than that. >> Thank
you,
>> Representative
Bodega.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Archuleta.
Um Remind me
your, your fund is
63% funded
or 67
>> madam Chair,
Representative Bogo. I think they're estimating
it. We, we're still
finalizing all the numbers for actuarial
report uh as
of June 30th 2024
but we're estimating we'll hit at
67% >> 60
seven. Ok. So it was
Pera, that was 63.
Um,
so,
um,
you have, I
guess, er, B has an
actuary
that they pay right
on a yearly
basis.
>> Representative, what we do.
>> And so what
is your, er,
B's actuary
recommend in
terms of
um, fully
funded? Do they recommend
100% or
80%?
What are they, what
is their gauge on that
madam >> Chair, Representative
Bogo, they have recommended
100%.
Hence the plan that you see
in place and the request that have been made
of the
legislature.
>> And Mr.
Archuleta on page 13,
madam Chair,
um, just one more
question.
So in 2013,
2019, 2021
and 2022
there was Legislation
regarding er, b
and adjustments.
Um, and I'm just trying to
figure out like
in 2013 to
now, which is
almost 10 years, I guess
2024.
Um how much the needle
has actually moved?
And one of the questions
that I madam Chair
is with regard
to your
investments and
the interest that is
gained on the fund. Do
you have any kind of a
spreadsheet that shows
the interest that,
that the fund is receiving
over time and
how much has been
infused back into the
fund based on the
investments >> madam
Chair, Representative Borrego. So between
2013. So these are just the
bills that have
passed, I think since
2013, there's probably been Legislation
introduced every single year requesting
an increase in contributions
to the fund. Um
As far as the investment
earnings are concerned. II, I
can tell
you that we've met our or
exceeded our long term targets
for most category or most
periods, the one year,
35, 10
year periods.
Um As far as the
numbers, I, I don't have those in
front of me.
I was expecting to make another
presentation in the future about
investments in
particular. Uh but
we can make that calculation
and present that information to
you. >> That would be wonderful
if you could. I'd really like
to see what
over 10 years,
how the fund has changed
in terms of your interest
and, and
how I, I
mean, I think we know how the
funding is being invested
because we have that information,
but the interest
income that's been
because that compounds
itself. Right.
So I would kind of like to see
that if I could, madam
Chair. Thank
you, >> madam Chair representative.
I would just add that, you
know, I think three years ago
we're collecting, we're paying out
$1.3 billion a year
and we're collecting from employees
and the employer uh somewhere
in the neighborhood of about $700
million a year. So that gap,
you know, is made up through investments
and the needle in terms of
our funded status hadn't moved
a whole lot downwards or upwards.
You know, we're kind of just water.
Um again, they performed
well, but there was, there wasn't
significant additions to the
plan. Now
through the increased employer contribution,
we're closer to receiving over a
billion, we'll receive over a billion dollars
this year. So the pressure
on investment earnings is
substantially >> and and
madam Chair, he doesn't have
to give me the
year to year
report, but I
if you just wanted to give me an
average of the
investment interest
over time so
that I would have a better gauge
of how the investments
are faring.
I would, that's what I'm asking.
Thank >> you madam Chair representative.
Go over the 10 year period. It's over
7%.
>> Is that it Representative
Orrego? Thank you.
We have representative uh
go >> thank
you madam Chair.
Just real quick. Uh
Mrta,
unless the fund is
fully funded,
the maximum of caller
that can be
uh given out
to, to speak.
Am I correct,
>> madam Chair representative uh
Aln? That is correct. That would be for the
disability retirees. But otherwise
it'd be 90% of that
calculation. Of, of the max
of 4%.
>> Thank you. That's the only question I
have.
>> Thank you.
Are there any other questions
from Committee? All
right. So I do have
one and thank
you again for your presentation.
Um We've
been
through
thick and thin on this,
so I appreciate it. But on
page 14,
um you
list in
the second bullet
summary of possible
changes
to improve solvency
without additional
employer
contributions
is
can you
historically
tell me
why uh it would
be without employer
contributions,
>> madam Chair.
Uh
Basically
the bill that
passed required us to look
at
options for improving the solvency
of the fund, improving its funded
status without the additional
contributions for without
any additional money from the State.
Uh So that's what was required as
part of the bill
as far as why
that came about. I maybe
there was some consideration at the time of saying,
listen, we've, we've given you at that
time, it was bumped up to
16.15%.
Here's your 16.15%.
The rest needs to be figured out by
some of their means
ie benefit
reduction. I mean,
that would really be the only
way. >> So
thank you. That
bill was passed
in 2021. Senate bill
42. Is that the one that you're referring
to?
>> Yes, Senate Bill,
Senate Bill 42
chap laws of 2001
chapter 44.
>> So then, um
that's, there's a
whole lot of different conditions
that have changed
from that time period to
this time period. And
given the line of questions
and concerns
or considerations,
um the
board will be looking
at the
impact correct
of these
pieces of Legislation and that
one in particular, in
order to
um make
recommendations. Is
that correct madam >> Chair Representative
cro at this point in time, the board has
not contemplated additional
changes based upon
our current trajectory. We're expected
to receive that fully funded status
within the time frame that the board
had adopted. So back in
2019, they said, ok, these
are based off the feedback that
they receive from the stakeholder
groups that they met with. This
is what's tolerable, the, the
reduction in the cost of living
adjustments, uh the
increase from the employee,
uh the tier adjustments,
that's a big one for us. The
uh what,
what's acceptable and based
off of that, they came up with the number
that said, ok, this is what we're going to plug
in. So as of
right now, I think it would be early for
us to say, you know, we
request an additional,
I realize that it would place
additional stress on, on general
fund uh dollars
flowing into the fund. I mean, if you
suggested it, I'd be happy to
request an additional 1% and
bump us up to 19.15
that would get us there that much
sooner right now.
I, you know, again what we know is
that the employee and employer contributions
are sufficient to support the
benefit and
the funding timeline that was
adopted by the
board.
>> So in the um
further down in that in
that particular um
bullet, there
are the sub bullets
which are the
considerations,
right, in terms
of without adding
any additional
contribution, employer
contribution. So
my
concern
is similar
to Senator
Stefanik and others
that have,
I think that in having these
conversations and in
making these evaluations
and assessments on a
regular basis, we need to
weigh in
um
proposed
analysis or or
directions of where we're going to
go.
But my concern
is that we don't place
the additional burdens
on
contributions from
the employees
um any further
because as we've seen
based on the economy, this
last few
years, we are
now at the point
where
in many cases,
inflation
figures are
outpacing
what we've provided for
in 2019 or 2013
whenever previously.
So we need to look at those
types of factors
um when we're
making and having these discussions.
So I would just urge
um these discussions
to look at
ways in
which maybe
now is the time because
we do have um we're
in a, we're in a very
positive position
um that maybe we
need to rel look
at our
employer contribution
position uh
without placing a burden
on our employees or
retirees. So
um because there
is validity
to the points
that the economy
and inflation and
other factors
uh are making
those types of benefits
even less
um
productive on
a daily basis for our
retirees. So I just wanted to
make that point. There are
no other further comments
and I think we're
good Mrta
madam >> Chair. Thank you for
today's opportunity and we'll be sure
to relay your message to our
board. >> Thank you very
much.
So, um
good. We're going to
mov'e on to item
number two
on the agenda,
which is now
the history and overview of the
cost of living
concerning Pera.
And we have Mr. Greg
Trujillo coming
up.
Good to see you.
Good morning
manager.
Let's see. We're getting
that
hand
out,
ok? You can go ahead and
proceed. Thank
you.
>> Can you hear me? Ok, there we
go. Thank you madam
Chair. Thank you Members
uh Greg Trujillo uh
with P er A.
Uh Thank you for having us
today. This is a beautiful
venue
and so we are here
to discuss the uh the
history of the cost of
living adjustment for P er
A on the
first slide. As you can
see, uh we've
gone through many iterations
of the cola uh
starting in
1965.
Uh I won't go through
every, every single year
but um
it's varied based
on an ad hoc cola
based on a guaranteed
percentage
or a
percentage of the
CPI
I think the
cola that most are
familiar with
uh started in
1992
and that's when para enacted
a 3% compounding
Cola uh
is a very rich
benefit, very nice Cola.
Um But
ultimately was unsustainable.
That structure was then
changed in 2013
as part of Legislation,
that 3% compounding
Cola was reduced to
2%.
Uh That was one of the
major rounds of pension reform.
Para has gone through
and again
in uh we went through
another round in 2020
that 2% compounding
Cola was changed to
what's been called a profit share
or variable rate cola
based off our
investment return as well as our
funded ratio.
Um
Throughout Pera, there
have been a number of
uh court
cases or litigation that has
come across uh
that has affected uh P
er A on slide four,
the most notable
was in 1998
there was a constitutional
amendment that
guaranteed the funds
for both per A&E
RB can only be
used for the exclusive
benefit of the Members,
attires and beneficiaries of
each system.
Additionally. And part of that constitutional
amendment, um
it states the legislature
shall not, shall not
enact any law that increases
the benefits paid by the system
in any manner or change
the funding formula for a
retirement plan unless
adequate funding is
provided
uh
in 2013,
uh er B made changes
to their cost of living adjustment
and that those changes
to the cola
uh were challenged in court.
The Supreme Court
ultimately ruled that
a Cola is not a property
right, any cola that
you receive, you
are entitled to, but any
cola in the future is
not guaranteed and that could
be changed.
So that was in 2013
and that was by the Supreme
Court
and in 20 or I'm sorry,
1995
there was a, uh, another
challenge where, and
I wasn't aware of this,
but
retirees were exempt
from State income
tax. Um,
as you can imagine that that
was very
pricey. The legislature
made a change to that
role and,
uh, the pension
became taxable,
uh, went to the Supreme Court as
well. Supreme Court,
uh, found because
of the acts provide an
absolute right to receive
some form of benefits
after they are vested. So it's
not a contractual, right? But
rather they created vesting
rights. And at Pera,
that is five years of
service, you are due a benefit.
You are, that is your
vesting, right? Uh What
that benefit looks like
um is not a a
property,
right?
Uh Next slide, just
a little bit of history on
where perry
is and kind of some,
some shifts or
some changes that
have
changed that uh
in 1993 that's
when the 3% compounding
cola was enacted
uh 1997.
Um there was some benefit
enhancements that were passed
that were not funded. And
I believe that's what triggered the
constitutional amendment in
1998.
Uh And you can see we,
we were, you know, 90%
100% over 100%
funded during some of these uh
times the early two
thousands. Then the.com
bubble uh hit
and you see that we started to
lose some ground as far as our funding
goes.
Uh 2008, the great
recession occurred
and at Pero, we lost about
half of our fund value. We were
very heavily invested in
equities. I believe we were
at $14 billion. At that
point in time, it dropped down to
about between six and 7
billion
and nothing, you know,
was done. Plans were
um brought
up in 2010
was the first attempt
of pension reform.
Uh what was called, the, uh, the
ideal plan, uh
did not occur
or did not pass. It wasn't
until 2013, that
significant reform uh took
effect. And as you can see, from
2006, we were at
92% funded
by the time pension reform actually
happened in 2013,
uh we were down to
65% funded.
I'll also mention at the, at
the point in time,
um
2008,
our unfunded liability was less
than a billion dollars. Uh
By 2013,
our unfunded liability
had grown to over $6
billion. Uh Our
unfunded liability today is about
8.3 billion.
Uh So it is still growing,
but, but it's, it's, we've
slowed the growth of
that. So between
2013 and
2023
it's grown over 2 billion,
but really that $6
billion loss or
unfunded liability that we accrued
between uh
2008 and
2013, that's
still a appeal we're
trying to swallow and trying to
solve
you. You all,
I'm sure are familiar.
Probably tired of hearing
the about Senate
Bill 72. That was the pension
reform done in 2020.
Uh, but just a brief recap,
essentially, what it did is it
reduced the cola and
it increased the contribution.
So we reduced the amount
of money going out the door and we
increased the amount of money coming in the
door. Um,
for three years, our retirees
received the those
that were eligible,
received a
noncompound 2%
13th check that
was in 2020 2021
2022
and then in 2023
it was replaced with uh
what's called the variable cola
or costs sharing cola,
profit share cola, how we want to
do it or, or
want to hear it. It's
a variable Cola
with a floor of a half a
percent. So no matter
what if you're eligible, you're gonna get a half
percent cola and depending
on our investment return and our funding
ratio, that amount of
Cola can go up to 3%.
Uh There was a carve out for
retirees that were aged
75 as of 6
30
2020 they
will continue receiving a
2.5% compounding
quota as well as
any retiree that was
earning less than $25,000
a year and worked
a full 25 year career
or any disability retiree
that was earning less than 25,000.
Those, those Members still receive
a 2.5% compounding
qula active
Members,
uh
employees were asked to
pay two percent more out of their
paychecks as well as their
employers. Uh
This last, uh,
June was the last
year of uh
the increases for
State employees. It was a
fouryear phase in
uh for municipal
and, and county
employees. They are
entering the second year
of their uh
increase in contributions.
And as of today, the
fund is 67.1%
funded and
our funding period is at 71
years.
On slide nine, the
breakdown of our benefit
payments and we're, we're talking
just the, the P A fund
we administer also
judges, uh
Magistrates as
well and volunteer firefighters. But we
are talking just uh
what we call the pe fund.
That's State city,
county workers, uh
firefighters, municipal
police, State
police.
Uh and this data is as of
630. So as of our last
evaluation, uh we
paid out about $1.4
billion in retiree benefits
over the year.
Um 234
million of that is a result
of strictly the cola.
So about 17%
of what we pay out in
benefits is
because of the
cola.
We just actually ran our cost
of living adjustment job. Uh,
retirees should be
seeing this in their paychecks
uh tomorrow when
payroll hits.
Um And as
I stated, we, we've got
a couple of different Cola models.
Uh We have the 2.5%
carve out which we just
discussed. Uh
2024
7000, 122
Members will receive that
2.5% cost
of living adjustment. That's
down significantly from when the
reform was passed in 2013,
uh which was expected.
Um, you know, when, when the reform
came out, it was a result of the Governor
um and a task force that she
had convened
and it was her
insistence that
the what she called
our most vulnerable,
um stay
protected and
our most vulnerable, you
know, 75
and older at that point in time, mortality
takes its toll. Uh
So the, the
difference or the decrease
is because we have
had Members that have,
um you know, been deceased
as well as anybody
that had that
$25,000 threshold
as a result of that
2.5% cola
that went over that
$25,000
threshold has moved
into the, the uh
profit share or variable
rate co a model
in 2024. Um
You know, just this month, you'll see
34,825
Members will receive
the cost of living adjustment
because of our investment
return and our funding ratio that is
a half a percent that they are
receiving. It is compounding.
Um And this is the second year
in a row that we are issuing
um a half a percent
compounding Cola to our
retirees.
Uh right below. If you'll
see, uh, just under
42,000,
of our retirees
will receive some type of cost
of living adjustment. And
that is about just over
90% of our
member. Our retired Members
are going to get some kind of adjustments,
right. Not enough. We know it's not
enough. Uh, but still, uh
over 90%
will receive that.
I will mention uh,
we do issue a cost
of living adjustment for our
judicial retirement
Members as well as our magistrate
retirement Members. It's
a different model
where they get a 2%
cola every third year.
Uh So they hadn't got a Cola
for the last two years. This
was the year that they
were due. Uh So 100
and 82 judicial
retiree retiree
Members uh got
a cost of living adjustment and 100
retired magistrate,
uh, retirees
received a colo.
Um, and we,
as you all May be
aware, uh, we
do have a plan for volunteer
firefighters retirement.
Uh They are not eligible
for a cola ever.
Um The last,
um, time we
met there was a question
about 13th check payments. We
have had Legislation the last
two years uh to
provide additional relief to
retirees in the form of 1/13
check. Um
The updated number for that is
if we were to give another
2%
non compounding 13th
check, it would cost
$33 million a
year. So
if, if you were, we
were fortunate to get that funded,
uh It would have cost 33
million to do 33 million
a year to do that. Um
And the 13th check payment
would not replace the compounding
cola that we would issue. That would
be in addition to uh what
Perro would
issue.
Also, at the last meeting, we talked
about uh what does a lump
sum appropriation do for
uh for Pera? So, on slide
11, uh you can
see that uh you know,
the number that I think that was brought up
last time was $200
million. Uh If we
got that appropriation, that
would reduce our funding period
down to 65 years,
increase our funding
ratio by about 0.7%.
So almost 68%.
Uh really
what's important to, to
a fund like us and to, er, b
is recurring dollars. If,
if we could somehow
get a commitment to $200
million being appropriated for the
next five years, uh, you
can see it reduces our funded
period down to 49 years,
increases our funding ratio
to 71%.
Um, you know, somehow
we could get a $500
million appropriation.
You could see that 57
years and uh we'd
be at,
um,
I'm sorry, I believe that would be uh
79%. I apologize
for that. Um
And ultimately, if
there was an additional $8.9
billion laying around,
uh, that would pay off our own funding
liability and that would bring us to
100%
funding.
I do want to reiterate,
uh, you know, said Bill
72 was significant.
It takes time to uh
work itself. In. But
what the legislature has
done is
uh, increase recurring
contributions coming in. Like I
said, we just
finished year four of
those increases.
Um And
so we'll, we'll bring this, these
numbers back to you updated.
But as of last year, that was
$86 million in
recurring, uh, dollars that
come into Pera, I'm sure
we're going to be over 100 million, uh,
when we do our actuarial
value this year. Uh So
I don't want to lose sight of that. The, the
legislature has increased
the contributions coming
in. Um It's just
takes time to, to
fully phase in. We're, we're
moving into
um, year four
of a sixe implementation
for that
bill
last time we met. Also,
we talked
about,
um, looking
at what would happen if we just put
back the 2% cost of
living adjustment as it was
in 2013. Uh
slide 12 kind of
shows that, that
projection if that was to happen,
um, it would increase our
liability instead of
8.3 billion, our
unfunded liability that would
increase to 9.7
billion. Um, and
drops our funded ratio to
63.6%.
Um And it
increases our payroll over the
next 30 years by about
$4.5
billion.
Um, you know, that
was Senate bill 72.
The, the main
reason for that bill is we
were taking too much out of the
fund to
subsidize our retiree payroll
and we were taking it out at a rate
that was not going to be sustainable.
Um So, so that's, that
was the main driver
of that
on site 13. You saw
this uh the last
time we met, but this kind of
shows the progress
that we've made. Uh
before Senate Bill
72 was enacted.
If you see the, the pipe chart
to the right. Uh
47%
of retiree payroll was
paid by uh
our investment fund,
53% was
paid by employee and
employer contributions.
You fast forward to
June of 2024.
61% of
retiree payroll is now
being paid by the
contributions and
39% is
coming out of the investment fund. So
we have stopped kind of
that, that draw. We're
not at the ATM or
borrowing money
to subsidize retiree
payroll like we were the,
the contributions coming
in are, are
the Majority of
retiree payroll and we're not taking
so much out of the fund. We,
we want to keep those dollars in
the fund uh so
we can invest them and we can grow
for, to, to
make sure the fund is
growing for, for
all the other Members as
well.
Uh Slide 14.
It's, it's a little bit of a busy
slide. Um but it does
look at um just a
distribution of our
retirees by,
by their service and how
many years they've been retired.
Uh Pera is a very generous
fund as I'm,
I'm sure you were all
aware. It's a very generous
benefit and we
pay out Members for
a very long time.
Um The last time
we met as well, I
briefed you. We had done an experience
study. Our retirees are
living longer. Um Our
projections before were
males we're gonna live
till on an average till they're
86 females
um till they're,
I'm sorry, males
when
their projected mortality was
83 and females
86. Um
The experience that we've seen
since we've increased
that to 85
for males and 87
for females. So, so not
only are we paying out a very
generous benefit, but we're paying
out, uh we're paying
it out for a longer period of
time.
And the, the big one on
slide 15 as, as
I've briefed this Committee before,
uh we're getting at a point where
we will be paying out more
retirees uh than
we have active Members paying
in. Um And it's
not unique to us. It's just
demographics. Uh
So last year we'll update
this as well. When our valuation is
updated, we have 40
47,855
active Members
paying in and we're
paying out
45,216.
Uh retirees,
those lines will cross
maybe not this year, but probably
by next year and that's going to
continue uh prior
till around 2030
2031.
Um And like I say, it's just, it's
just demographics. That is
how,
that's what our population is.
So we, we have
a cash
flow um
situation that we've got to manage.
Very delicate, very
delicately through uh
the rest of this
decade.
Uh Slide 16, I won't
go too much into
it, but I want to put it, put this in
here. Uh Just a brief
overview on our, our pair
of fund performance. Uh Mike
Shackleford, our, our chief
investment officer is here if
there's any investment
questions.
Um and slide
17, well, the rest of slide
1718 and 19 are
just uh
information for the Committee as
far as uh what our
active member statistics are
as well as our retired
retired Members
um are
and you know,
we, we
always show the, the map
of uh
where the benefit payments go
in New Mexico. Approximately 90%
of our payroll stays within
the State and it's just a
breakdown of the counties
and, and the amounts that go into
those counties uh for
retired Members
and with that madam Chair, I'm
happy to stand for
questions.
>> Thank you.
Um
Repres. Well,
OK. We're
building the list now and
we're going to begin with. Representative
Ring.
Yes.
>> Uh Thank you madam
here and uh
let me get to the
slide.
Anyway, um
I want, you know, I want to
thank you Mr. Trujillo.
You provide
me a list
every year
of
contributions
just for the
police on the
return to work.
And I, I have
the January 24
2023
letter. Um
I don't have the updated
letter with me, but
looking at that letter,
I want to kind of go through
some and
tell the audience.
So
as of
December 22
had contributed
over $2
million into the
fund with no
future.
So your
predecessor
felt that
those individuals were
hurting the fund and I
thank you for
recognizing
that 32
million in free money
actually helped
that.
What I'd like to do is
I want to go down at the bottom of
that letter. Uh
It talks about the
funding ratios and
the contributions and the
shortfall.
And so I'm gonna go through some
of those to
help educate
uh some of the people in the
audience.
So if we look at State
General,
um
the and
this is employer
and employee
contribution,
they're contributing
29.16%.
And as of
January
2023
they are funding
period indefinite.
And would you explain
to everyone what the
indefinite
means?
>> Yes. Uh Madam Chair
and represent Marre and just a
little bit of background. And when
he's talking about return to work,
uh Pera did have a return to work
program that ended in
2010,
I believe at that point
in time.
Um
Well, I think it always was
this way. Uh but the
employee who was on return to work
still had to make contributions
into Pera with no
future benefit as well as the
retirees. So, so the
32 plus
million um
that did come in from those
Members with no, no
future liability
incurred. Um,
looking at, I believe, uh,
State General,
uh, currently,
you know, right now, I believe
the State pays in on
my behalf
19.24%.
Um I pay in
10.92%.
That's the 29 and
change that he referenced.
Uh, but when he says that it's
indefinite, it means
even with those contribution increases
that have been incurred, um
that's not enough
money coming in to pay
off. What's the unfunded
liability for
the State General plan?
We also have the State
Police plan that's actually
over funded. Uh They have a
surplus. We have municipal
General uh that are
underfunded as well as uh
municipal police and municipal
fire plans within the
overall pe
fund.
Um I believe right
now it's about 7%
would be what, what, what
is needed and additional
contributions coming in to get us
to 100% funding.
Um And I, I believe
the payroll is
over 2 billion combined.
So 7%
of whatever
$2.2 billion
would be, would be the additional
um funding we would
need coming in in the form of
contributions to get us to
a point where we're looking at 100%
funded within uh
25 years.
>> And madam Chair
and Mr. to
this uh Committee
is recommended that you
be fully funded
on each program
by what year?
>> Uh The, the goal is
25 years.
Uh Right now we are at about,
I believe it's 71
years
out and, and
I will say prior to
Centerville 72 in 2020
we were never going to be funded.
Um We were at infinite
the, the funding that was coming
in was not sufficient to pay
off the liabilities.
So even though we're
still, we're, we're not as close as
we want to be. We are
making progress.
>> And madam Chair and
Mr. Trujillo, I'm gonna run
through several of them
here. Municipal
General.
Um
uh It is a
contribution of
24.44.
And what that
needs their shortfall
is
4.03%
if we go to municipal
police,
uh their total
contribution is
37.3%
and they're 9.63%
short.
Um
And municipal police
will be fully funded in
59
years.
Um
Municipal fire,
their total
contribution
is
41.79%.
Now, the big change
in their contribution
came a couple
of years ago where
uh they lobbied
the legislature and get
paid for the full
48 52
hours of their work
week. They
increased their
contribution,
but they are
17.44%
underfunded
and they're
indefinite
when we look at the judicial.
So judicial is a
district court Court of
Appeals
and um
Supreme Court,
they're contributing
25.5
and
they
to
6%
and their funding
period
years
magistrate is a
25.5
and they're underfunded
by
1.09%.
Uh Magistrate is
indefinite.
Municipal fire is
indefinite
and State
uh general
is indefinite.
My point with the
indefinite
is
they're gonna go bankrupt.
They're gonna go into the
red at
some point. Is that
correct?
>> Uh madam Chairman and
I represent Mariem.
Um
So one thing just to point out, we,
we administer 31
different retirement plans, two
tiers of benefits. So
there are different plans for
different municipal police,
municipal fire, uh
municipal. So, so
it's not just as broad
as that. Uh when
we say they're going to go
bankrupt. If, if we stop
taking contributions in
today and just cut the system
off, we would be
bankrupt. Um But
we have those future
increases coming in.
Uh that will
be invested that will
generate over a long period
of time. Um
We have, you know, one thing I
didn't mention uh we have
tier two retirees.
Uh The first reform done
in 2013,
made Members hired
71 or 2013
after uh
pay the same
amount as a tier one employee, but
they have to work longer. Um
They get a reduced benefit.
So all those working in
time, we are
improving. It's just a
slow process.
Um Anytime you implement a
new tier, it takes
about 20 years uh
for that tier to
kind of really take over
your population
where
1011 years
in uh from that
first reform. So we've still got about
10 years before tier two
really starts taking over our
population. Um
So all those levers together,
we will see improvement. We're not going
bankrupt. Uh But if,
if we close the plan today,
then yes, as you're saying, the,
the funds coming in are not
sufficient to pay the benefits
that we have promised.
>> And madam Chair and
Mr. Trujillo, you've shown
us a slide in the
past showing that
let's take municipal
fire because they're the one
needing the most
contribution. At
what year did
you project that
they would go into the
red.
>> Uh Madam Chair represent
Bremm, they've been in
red as long as I've been
at Pera. So when that
happened, I'm not sure
and, and today
even we don't show them
coming out of the red. Um
You know, luckily it's, it's a
multi employer
costs sharing plan. So
everybody is together. Uh
but them on their own,
the, the contributions coming
in today still aren't sufficient
to pay the benefits
that we've
promised.
>> Um madam Chair and
Mr. Trejo. I
remember the slide and I want
to say it was like 2040
something. But
let's, let's go ahead and
talk about another
aspect. What
I've heard comments.
Well, if our
fund is going bankrupt
or we don't have enough money,
we can take money out of
another plan and mov'e it
over.
Well, let's think
about that for a moment
because
I have made
contributions
into a specific
plan.
And uh
my contributions
are for my
plan not to be
given to another
plan. So
that discussion
wouldn't actually
work
in your scheme or do you think
it would
>> madam Chair and Representative
uh Perri is a
costs sharing multi
employer plan. That's how it was
developed. We, we
have people that have been a State
employee that have been a
municipal cop that have been a
municipal firefighter. Uh,
so they, our, our
membership routinely moves
between divisions.
Um, so how you would allocate
that is separate. This
is accounting purposes
as far as for our
valuation on
this fund, this fund
or this division
and, and where they're funded.
So,
I don't, I mean, it, it's a, it's
a cost sharing
plan. Um, so we're
not taking
money from, you know,
Peter to pay Paul, we're
in the plan together
>> and, and madam Chair
and, and Mr.
Trujillo, that's my point.
It's that money is going to have
to stay in each
one and
it's going to have to be fully
funded in
itself.
Um
uh and
madam Chair Mr.
Trujillo, I think it's
important for those
listening in to
understand this is
an employee
retirement,
this is not a State
benefit.
And so the
employees we've got to,
we've got to look to the future
about how we're going to
fully fund this.
Um I'm glad
that you brought up some of the past
court cases because I've
heard discussion
about uh
suing Pera and all
that and I want
to read just one section
out of our State
Constitution
and it is uh
if you go to the minus uh
miscellaneous
section and it's
section 22
and it's uh letter
E nothing in this
section shall be
construed to prohibit
modifications to
the retirement plans
that enhance or
preserve the
actuarial
soundness of
the affected trust
fund or
individual retirement
plan. So,
it's already said
that they're going to be able to mov'e
this, either
cut benefits
or do
whatever.
And so it
really comes down
and this is current
employees.
They need to understand we
have another
downfall in the
market.
This plan is going to be
in real trouble.
So there's, there's
two things that
are gonna happen, you
either gonna have to increase
contributions
or cut benefits.
And I really
want to encourage
all of the current
employees to
increase their
benefits.
Obviously, there's enough
money in there to pay my
pay for my
retirement until
I die. But I'm
really worried about the
future employees.
Thank you. Now Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative. And
next we have on the list,
Representative
Orrego,
>> thank you madam Chair.
Um and
Mr. um
Trujillo, thank you for your
presentation. You're always very
candid with us.
Um madam Chair.
I have some very, very
similar concerns
about um the three
funds that were mentioned
by um
representative.
Um and
particularly because
these funds have been
sort of in the red
for a long time. I
mean, it hasn't been
just now that
we're discussing this,
we've been discussing these things
for like the last 10
years probably.
Um So I,
I have real concerns
about, you know, all three of
those funds. Um and
I'll get into that in a second,
but I just wanted to ask you a
quick question.
Um Well, I actually have
three questions but
um you said that
Cola is not a prop
considered a property,
right? But the,
the actual pension
fund is right.
Is that correct? Just,
I would just need clarification
on >> that madam Chair and represent
Borrego. The, the
pension itself is what, what
somebody has earned. Um,
they are entitled to for the rest of their
life, future cost
of living adjustments next
year, two years, three years.
That is not a property, right?
>> Thank you for that clarification.
And I, I really asked that
question for the public
because that was
something that I had
in the back of my mind
kind of knew.
But um,
so with regard to the
firefighters, um why
do they not receive
Cola's because you said
that they do not receive any
cola >> madam
Chair and represent Borrego
strictly volunteer
firefighters. And I
believe the the rationale
this was done before I
was, is what
funds that benefit is an
appropriation from the
fire protection fund. So
volunteer firefighters are
never, they've never actually
paid into Pero, it's,
it's, it's
uh appropriated
by the State. So, so
their call or their benefit,
um which is very modest.
100 and $25 if
you did 10 years and you're age
55 or
$250 if
you did 25 years
and you're age 55
they, they, they'll get that
pension, but no cola
is ever tied to that >> because
so thank you for that clarification
madam Chair.
Um
And just
to be clear,
firefighters to also not
receive Social Security.
Right,
>> madam Chair and
represent Bogo. That, that's
um,
varies based on the
county. You know, every
county, every municipality has to
enter into a
modification agreement with
social security and
some, yeah, and police. Some,
some
counties do do
social security for their uh first
responders. Others don't. So
it just varies by county or
municipality. >> And
I believe that there's a mov'e
amongst
us with police
and fire to at
the federal level to
maybe change that. II,
I believe that's
true madam Chair.
So I think that's something that I just
wanted to mention to the Committee
because I think it's important that
we support that.
Um by the way, my
father was a firefighter for
30 years. So
I um
it's important to me.
Um and I know
that because my mom does not
receive social security
right now.
Um So I wanted to go
to slide.
Um
let's see.
Ok, slide.
Um
12
and at the top
you have um
have a little bullet in
here that says
unfunded liability
and you have current
cola provisions
8.379
million,
67.1
funded ratio and
then 2% projected
cola. Um
and it says
63.6
funded
ratio.
So, could you
just elaborate on
that for me? >> Yes,
madam Chair represent
Borrego. Uh
So yeah, the, the first
line current cola provisions
are unin liability is
$8.3 billion
and we're 67.1%
funded if we did away
with that current cola
provision. And we just went back
to the straight 2% cola
for retirees that would
increase our unfunded liability to
the $9.7 billion
and decrease our funded ratio to
63.6%.
>> So
>> it's a what >> if,
and, and the
reason that I asked this madam
Chair is because at your
last presentation,
I think it was last month, I
heard the, the term
or heard the percentage of
63%
funded and then
today I heard 67%
funded. So I wanted
to have that clarification.
So if the
cola
were to be taken
out, then it would be
63%
funded. Am
I understanding that correctly? No,
>> no madam Chair and
representative, if we
change the current profit
share cola variable rate
cola and moved
to just the 2%
straight. Compounding cola,
that's the change. >> Ok.
So it's based on the
compounded
rate.
>> So 67% is what we
funded today. If we change the
formula, we would drop down to
63%.
>> Ok. And madam Chair,
I'm gonna ask, um,
I'm gonna ask Mr. Trujillo
for kind of the same
question that I
asked. Um
er b
um is with regard
to the interest income
and the compounded rate
over 10
years. Can you just give
me an average more or less?
I know you guys have a target
of 7%
but what,
what do you think based on
your investments? You
guys
>> madam Chair on slide
16, um
You'll see our returns over
35 7, 10
years. Our assumed rate
of return is seven and a quarter
percent over the last
10 years. Um I
believe this is as of March of
2024 10
year period, we were at
6.06%.
Our long term projections show
that we should exceed
our 7.25%.
But until, you know, that
experience is realized, we,
we won't know. But,
but what we do know
is as of
March uh
of this quarter, 10 years
ago, you know, the
return has been
6.06%.
>> All right. Um And just
one more question, madam Chair.
Um
So you said there are
44,115
retirees
that you guys are paying out
to, right
>> madam Chair. This
is the,
the date on this is as of
630. Um
What we just paid out in our July
payroll was over 46,000
fores.
And once, once those numbers
are finalized and audited,
we'll come back to the Committee
and brief you on that. >> Do you have any
idea madam
Chair? How many of
those retirees
live out of
State?
>> Uh Madam Chair and
uh represent
Bogo. Um
I don't know an actual number
but of the
percentage, maybe the
last slide, 91%
of our retirees reside
within the State. I
can get you an actual number, but
91% of our retirees
are new >> Mexicans.
So about 9%
>> 1% about
9% about nine >> percent
live out of State,
which that income that
we're sending out of State is not
coming back in
the form of
buying goods and
paying taxes and so
on.
>> Representative, correct? Ok.
>> Thank you madam Chair. I appreciate
your indulgence.
>> Thank you, representative. Next, we have
Senator Padilla,
Senator Paia.
You're next. But,
well, before
you get to your question, would you
introduce
yourself?
>> Ok, good morning madam
Chair. Thank you very much. And Members of
the Committee. Good morning everybody.
I'm State Senator Michael
Padilla. I represent the southern
part of Bernalillo County.
I'm uh the Senate Majority
whip and I apologize
madam Chair for being a little bit tardy.
Today. We just uh dedicated
the Henry Kiki Sedra
community Center in my district.
It's a beautiful facility. If you ever had a
chance to be there to go there,
I'd really encourage you to go there. Uh
Madam Chair, would you like me to ask my questions
now or did you? Ok. All right.
Well, thank you madam Chair and thank
you to the presenter. I apologize for being a little
bit tardy, but that was the reason I walked
in during your, your presentation.
Um I
will say that
um you know, this
is an issue that
um I've, I've
sunk my teeth into a little
bit, you might recall you
and I had some very interesting
conversations last
couple of sessions on this. I,
I am extremely
concerned. Um
I'm the one that sponsored
the Legislation to take the
tax off of social secu uh
State income tax on
social security. I
think that, you know, we've had some very
dramatic things that have happened over
the past uh
you know, decade or so.
I uh I
know that uh
you and your team are
working incredibly hard
to find answers to this problem
that we're facing right now.
And, and it's a big one.
I mean, um
by my calculation
madam Chair, I think we have about a
4200%
increase in the cost of
living for these folks that
are already retired based
on the cola that they uh
that they have received
of about a half a point or
something. But
inflation's gone up
approximately
21%. And
that's why I'm getting this
4200%
increase. That is
devastating. It's just quite
frankly devastating and I don't know
how much of this came up in the
presentation. I'd have been
here right on time. So I
apologize if that's already been mentioned.
But I want to cover that because
that should be punching all
of us right in the face here.
These are folks that did what they
said we asked them to do
and they are now
retired and I'm just
very concerned that folks are
having to make
really uh
life changing
decisions
after a lifetime
service to all of us.
This, this is, this is not good.
Um
You know, when I think of the term
cola, I think of cost
of living adjustment.
And I don't know, when was the last time we
actually did a, an actual cost
of living adjustment that met
what the cost of living has gone
up for that particular twelvemonth
or rolling three year average
or whatever it is. Can
you tell me when, uh madam
Chair, just when did we actually
meet the cost of
living increase for that
particular year? Have we done that in a
while? >> Uh madam
Chair and Senator Padilla, uh,
we have actually,
um you know, from
1992 to 2013,
we were issuing 3%
per year. Um,
that far exceeded, uh,
the cost of living. I
think we beat CP I by
about 30%. Uh,
2013
that dropped out. So those retirees
benefited greatly from that
2013, we dropped it down
to 2%. Um,
that was probably on par
with inflation.
Um, 2020 our
retirees haven't gotten a,
they went three years, they, they
got some relief in the form of
1/13 check, but it wasn't compounded
last year was a half percent this
year, half a percent.
Um 90% of our
population will receive
some kind of
adjustment. We know it's
not enough, but we also know it's
very costly, especially
when we take into account
that we're going to be paying
out more retirees than we
have Members paying
in. Um So I'm, I'm
all for increasing
it. Uh But the funding
is really what we need
to be able to do that.
>> Well, thank you. And, and that's,
you know, kind of one of the questions I
have today and I'll get to that one here in
just a little bit. Uh One of
the proposals I came
forward with was,
and it just kind of commonsensical
kind of just my, you know,
not being in the investment world
or anything like that just seems
to me like there's an awful lot of
data madam Chair and, and
a presenter and you
know, um and, and
resources. Uh if we take a
look at the Social Security Administration
cola that takes place.
So I did draft a bill and
I introduced it and we, you did
a lot of analysis on it. Thank
you. And I know that it
did um you know, have
a lot of impact on the
solvency of, of the
overall fund, but we've got
to start somewhere.
You know, we happen to be in a scenario
right now where we're
not gonna be flush with cash like
this for a very long time
and I just am very concerned
about these folks in 10
years.
I mean, we have
money right now to,
to do some very creative
things. Do you have
any proposals that you're going to
come forward with in the 25
Session where anything goes?
I mean, if you want to introduce a bill
to put pink stripes down the middle of every
road, you can do it in a 60
day Session. II I
just am interested. Are, are you
coming forward with anything that takes
some of the some of the
piece of pie, of all this extra
revenue that we have right now to
shore up this account,
>> madam Chair and Senator
Padilla. Um on
slide 11, I know you were a
little bit late.
Um but yeah, if
you, if you want to see the impact on lump
sum appropriations, what
that does uh you know,
$200 million for a year.
Uh the State commit 200
million per year for the next
5, 1020
years. Um
We, we have those numbers,
we have had a
large surplus.
Um We've been
not fortunate to share
in that. We have been
fortunate to get
increases in contributions.
Um But yeah, I
mean, I see they, they grew
from $20 billion to,
you know, $50 billion
over a 34 year
period. And I
understand investing
for the future and creating these funds
for future revenue. Uh
But we've also incurred
liabilities in the past that
at some point uh the
State needs and,
and I'm not saying that
nothing has been done because it's been
significant once it's been done.
Uh But yeah, if we, we're talking about
doling out additional surplus,
I mean, if we can defer some of
that to pera, we're,
we're happy to do it in
discussions I've had with
the legislative
leaders that appetite hasn't
been there that they've
had other priorities.
>> So madam Chair
and, and Mr. Trujillo,
the so is there anything
in the
uh you know,
in my business? We have you sign
everything before you come to work
so that you know exactly what's available
to you. I even have a
benefit if you want to adopt a child, I'll
help you. I'll pay for the adoption of
that child. So that's all in
writing. There's no confusion. There
is there anything in the
new hire paperwork, if
you will or contractual agreements
or whatever with new employees
that says how a cola
would be addressed or is that not
addressed at all in the
quote unquote new hire paperwork.
>> Madam Chair Senator Padilla,
I can only speak on behalf of
myself. Uh I've only
worked for the State.
Um, when I started,
you know, I signed
up, Pera is a condition
of employment. I think
when I, I've, I've been around
about 21 years, I
think my contribution at that
point in time was about
6.92%. That's
increased 4% since
then. Um The States
I believe has increased an additional
5%. Um
The cola
that was in effect when I was
hired has been
changed three
times. Um So
there is no,
um
no contract that we signed
a and actually that, that
was actually challenge and we
relate, but on
um
slide six back in
1995
I won't go through this slide, I'll let
you, but it does
say there's lesser property rights,
there's not contractual
rights to what you are
hired under.
Um
So that's probably the best I
can answer that question to
her.
>> So, are
there any spec based
on slide 11, you know, where the
dollars and, and, you know, I hear
when you guys come and present on this all
the time, you know, we, we could certainly do this
just, you know, the dollars. I
mean, are you going to come forward with a
proposal that says
we want to start chipping away at
this, this way? And what will
that mean in terms of a cola for
the existing
retirees, >> madam
Chair Senator Padilla?
Um, 2020
we came with that proposal and that
reform still hasn't been fully
implemented. We haven't,
we haven't fully received
uh the additional increases.
But yes, if, if you want to work
together and we want to look
at lump
sum appropriations to,
to work
towards this. I'm happy to do so,
but we, we, we've
met with numerous
legislators on this and
educated them. Um but
it is comes down to what's the
appetite and the appetite
has been elsewhere. >> You
know, I madam Chair,
I, I'll stop in a moment. I know you
have others. Um We have the
dollars now to do it. So I
really think we should, you know, keep
at it, keep pushing it. I fully
support a, a
cola that makes
sense to the compounding portion
as well as that year's issue
or whatever the cost of living is going
up. So I just want you to know that
um you
know, I uh I'm
worried again in 10 years,
we're not gonna even have an option like
that possibly because our
revenues are gonna, we're expecting
them to drop off in 5 to 78
years.
Um
Yeah, so
it,
so you will come forward
with it. Well, so when I can't get
a bill passed, I shouldn't tell my
colleagues this if I can't
get it passed after two years. You know what
I do? I just change the name of the
bill and suddenly
magically it goes right through for some
strange reason, but I know
this is very different. I'm, I'm not being
flip about that, but I, I
really think you need to bring this
every single year until this thing
is resolved because we don't
want to make, working for the State
or for a government agency
here in New Mexico, an
undesirable thing. We want
people to want to do this kind of work.
But if they feel like they're
going to be less fortunate
in life after a whole career of
work, why would they want to get
into this kind of work?
So I know, you know that and I'm,
I'm not beating up on you. I
appreciate all the work that you're doing
and that your team is doing, but we
need to have continue
pushing that ball up that hill
until it gets resolved. And I'm
just concerned that we know we're going to be
shortly, not have very many options
available to us. So let's
rightsize this thing
now. So
thank you madam
Chair.
Thank you, Senator. >> Next,
we have Representative
Lundstrom
madam Chair.
I did have a couple of
questions and it
ties to your charts,
Greg. Um
I'm looking at slide 14
and slide 15
on slide 14 and
in full disclosure, I am a P
er A retiree
25 years
and I'm looking at the retiree
headcount year
since retirement on
slide 14
and the services at
retirement. So, I, I
think I fall
into that 10
to 1425 to
29 at
2449
people. I think
that's where I fall
in. I'd
like to ask you though.
Does this
include the
other, is this only P
er A service?
And does it include judicial
and magistrate
>> uh madam Chairman and Representative
Lundstrom. This is strictly uh
the P A fund. So the pe
fund, uh Magistrates
and retired Magistrates and
judicial are different
and, and it would be a lesser
amount, but I
can, I can produce the same for
those fund if you'd like.
>> Well, the reason I'm asking is because
I'm looking at slide 15
and, and we
see that the total
active Members versus
retired
Members
is this chart then based
on um
2017,
number of
36,440
>> two madam
Chair, Representative Lundstrom.
Um So,
so this chart only looks
at um what we call
service retirees, the actual
member itself, it doesn't take into
account their
beneficiaries um
after they pass. So
uh our numbers are a
little different with that and I didn't
feel comfortable
um displaying
those. But our service retirees,
these are the actual people that
did the job that earned the
benefit.
>> Ok, because it is different.
It looks like you're using a
27
2017
number for
this chart on retiree
headcount. >> No madam
Chair and represent Lundstrom.
The, yeah, the, the difference would
be uh,
beneficiaries or
copays.
>> So it's about 10,000
people, madam
>> Chair and Representative
Lundstrom, about 10,000
people and including the
volunteer firefighter population,
which is about 1700
retirees.
>> Ok. Yeah, because I was
confused when I was looking at the two
charts and I didn't understand how
they tied.
Um, the other
question I have for
you madam
Chair,
we talk about
uh the combination
of all funds
and the way I've
always in uh seen this
is that P er A
is a retirement
program
and it has separate
sub sub
funds. Is
that correct >> madam
Chair and represent funds from you?
So separate divisions
within the fund.
>> So they're separate
divisions.
Does the board approve
moving from one fund to
another from
one division to another
>> uh madam Chair and
represent Lundstrom? No.
>> So, so I wanted
to point that out based
on what Representative Rehm
Said. So
it's got to be clear
to the pub public here today
that they don't do
that.
And is it because
it is not allowed
in statute or is it
policy where it's not
allowed? >> Uh madam
Chair, I represent Lundstrom, I think, I
think it's silent. Um
You know, say I
left Pera today and I
wanted to run and become a
magistrate Judge.
I can do that. The board
or Pera doesn't
have any authority to say
I can't or if I left the State
and I wanted to work for the city of
Albuquerque, I I
don't know where
the board or per would have the
authority to say. No,
you, you started in the State division,
you stay in the State division.
>> No, my point is this
my point is and if I
were in one of those funds
that is performing
better, I'm
not going to want to see those dollars
transferred to a different
subdivision.
So, does that happen or
not?
>> Uh Madam Chair, I represent
Lundstrom.
Um
So if, if I
go to Municipal
General, >> I'm not talking about
an individual. I'm talking
about when the board makes a decision
on their investments for
these funds
and once they make that that
decision, they're not saying, oh,
part of it is, is we're going to take
from which one is
the best performing right now?
Which one is closest to
100% >> madam
Chair and represent
Lundstrom. Our State police plan is
over 100%
>> we don't take from the State
Police Fund then to help
judiciary. Is that correct,
>> madam Chair, Representative
Lundstrom, correct? >> Ok. That's
the bottom line. Then that
doesn't happen. They're not
transferred. The
individuals May be because
you May have different
jobs, you May be a Judge
one day and uh something
else another day
>> and, and madam Chair represent
Lundstrom. That is correct. But I will say
all the funds are invested the
exact same way. We don't have a
separate investment fund for
judges, for Magistrates, for
State general. It's, it's all the same
asset allocation, >> but you don't
allow for moving
from State police that they've
paid into, that
their employer has
matched into something
else. Is that
correct? >> Uh
madam Chair that, that is
allowed, but
the benefit structure is
different. So if, if they
were 10 years, a State cop
and 10 years a State employee,
we would take the formula
for each of those
10 years. >> I understand that
because they're going to have a different
job title and a
different uh, payout
and all that other business. But I just
want to make sure that we're, that
we're clear that we're not moving
this to shore
up some other fund.
And that's been one of the
requests I know in my years in the
legislature that's always been
talked about between
P er A&E RB.
There's always been that
tension that,
um,
er, B felt like they were being
underfunded by the State
or, or
whoever. I can't remember how
all the discussion went.
But the other, the other issue
I believe without
question is
that there's not a reason in the
world. Well, the
general, why the general fund
can't put more money into both
of these retirement
programs. There's not a reason in the
world and,
and I know that's above
your pay grade,
but there's not a reason in the
world
and for
me being the former
budget Chair to see that.
It really bothers me.
It bothers me to know
that we're putting funds into a
savings
program. Two
big, big funds
for some rainy
day. But yet people
that need the money today
were telling them, oh, we don't have
the money. That doesn't
cut it. I think that's
ridiculous.
And I think that
the general fund can certainly
help shore some of these
things up
>> madam Chair if I May
go back to Senator Pilla's
point. Um, we
have had multiple,
um, attempts to
provide relief in the past. I
will say Representative Lundstrom
was the first, uh,
representative to
sponsor uh,
additional 13th check payments
two years ago, didn't get through.
Uh, we had a similar
um, attempts
last year, but as
Senator Padilla said, it sometimes
takes years long. Uh, we're
at years long and we'll keep
making those attempts,
>> madam Chair under my budget
chairmanship, we put,
I believe it was two years
and the people can tell
me from er B was it
ok. And that's
what we put in under my
chairmanship
and we made damn sure we had the
money
because the
employees were important
enough to do
that.
That's all. Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you, representative.
And so next we have
Representative Serato.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Thank you for
presenting in Mr. Cetto. You know, we
we I'll ask him
questions about things you presented before
on the matter. Um I'm
curious uh madam Chair.
Um what is the effect
of vacancies on
this calculation?
>> Uh Madam Chair
and Representative Sra,
that's it's a question
we've gotten. We don't
really have a straight answer to
because we
vacancy rates aren't reported
to us. We don't know what,
you know, the city of
Albuquerque is budgeted for.
We just know what they report.
Uh I will say, you
know, there was a couple more
than a couple of years ago when
Governor Lujan Grisham came
in. There was a huge hiring
initiative. Um, I think
they added about 2000
people in a year and the
head account didn't mov'e.
And the reason
why is because we had 2000
people retire.
And so it's difficult
for our employers to just keep up
with the attrition rate, replace
who is retiring much
less adding to the head account.
But, but State government
has, I mean,
as you can see on,
uh, one of the
slides, I mean,
10 years ago, we were at 50,000
employees,
51,000 employees.
Um and we
shrunk and I, I just don't
see us getting back to that point
anytime soon.
>> Thank you for that. Um Madam
Chair and, and Mr.
Clara, I'm, I'm
gonna ask you to talk me through some of the
investing principles that you have.
And, and the biggest
reason is that, I
mean, I, I agree with a lot of
my colleagues here who talk about, you
know, let's, let's put a lump
sum in, let's let's fix it. But
I mean, looking at that slide
is the one with the ears
slide. Seven. I
mean, I, and, and
this goes beyond
you. I mean, this is, this is
since the great recession, right?
Like we have not come close
to recovering. And so my
concern is that if we put in a lump
sum and so, you know, 100
million, you know, some of these are big numbers,
how long is that going to last?
And it makes me concerned just
again, uh you
know, looking at long term when, when
a lot of people are going to be retire and will be there.
So I'm kind of going back to
the investment principles that you all
have. Um
How is that shifted
in recent times to kind
of reflect that the need
to grow rapidly?
Um If you've done any shifts
in that way, >> uh madam
Chair and represent Serrato,
if, if it gets more
in the ways, I'll bring up our cio
but I will say, um,
Pera has been very conservative
in their investments. Uh The
main reason being is
kind of that cash flow issue because
we've got to take money out of the fund
to subsidize our retiree
payroll. Um We've
been very conservative with the
reform that was done in 2020
where we reduced the amount of
money going out and we've
increased the amount of money coming
in, uh, has given us
an opportunity to be a little
bit more um
aggressive than we have in the
past. We passed an asset
allocation. I believe it was
last,
um,
sometime last year, uh,
that we are moving towards
which we are becoming
more aggressive uh
with our investment.
Um It is just managing
that, you know,
in my, in my own personal
deferred comp, I mean, the most aggressive
I can be, but that's my money.
Uh, when we've got
46,000
retirees and another
47,000
actives. I'm not gonna take
those same um
chances that I am with other
people's money. It's, it's what
we're trying to do is make
sure we are paying the
benefits promised to our
Members. >> Thank you, madam
Chair. Thank you, Mr. I mean, I, I
appreciate the conservative
uh nature but again, looking at
these numbers, I mean, we've
not, since, since the great recession
have not been close to
93%. And
unfortunately, um
you know, again, even in even a
massive infusion, you know,
as you've laid out in some of these, these
options in slide 11
do not get us to the 25
year uh you know,
funding period that we're all kind
of strive for. And again, like,
you know, I think there is a time to
be to to,
to invest aggressively
and ideally
that that time hasn't passed for
us. Um but I appreciate
your your responses. Thank
>> you.
Thank you representative.
Next we have representative
atw. >> I thank
you madam Chair. Just
one quick one.
Uh Mr.
Trujillo
told benefits paid out
to say that's
1.42
billion
that was in a year,
right,
>> madam Chair representative,
sir? >> Ok. And this
just includes P er
A, this does not include
er B
>> madam Chair representative. That is
correct. >> Thank you.
Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you representative.
I'm
are there any other questions
Senator Pinto?
>> Thank you madam, Chair Members of the Committee
and thank you. For your presentation.
I believe I heard this before.
I don't remember if it was in this Committee
and I'm not on the finance
Committee and
we've had, I don't know how many
years, probably since I've been in all
this money and
to not meet this criteria,
it seems like it's bad policy,
especially for the State of New Mexico
and employees and you're still
knocking at the door to get
funded. But,
um,
that under funding, has
there ever been a study
um done? I mean,
do you guys feel
like you have the capacity to
actually take the deep dive
of what needs to
come in from the State when we talk
about vacancies?
Um because that's not
your purview, but
has it, has anything ever
been done like that
>> madam Chair and Senator
Pinto? Yes.
Each year we do a
actuarial valuation.
Uh That looks at that and we
have the shortfall,
the shortfall for each individual
group. Uh What we, what
we would need to get
to the 100%
funding.
>> But as far as going all the way back
to what the inputs are
um from the employees.
How long? I mean, we're
just automatically vested.
Is that what every employee that
comes in? >> Uh madam
Chair and Senator Pinto, as far as
vesting once you've worked
for a perro employer for five
years, you are vested.
Um So we, we don't
go back, you know, we've
always,
you know, just, we've always been
underfunded um
investments have made up for that
demographics can't hide that
anymore. Uh So we don't go
back and see what
the person that retired 20 years
ago should have paid in.
Um It's, it's always based
on the active worker
and their employer, what
would be needed
to, you
know, get
that shortfall,
um taken care
of. >> And madam Chair
Members of the Committee, have you
ever had um supporting
documentation from this Committee
um to the LFC
to uh fully fund
this >> uh madam
Chair? Yes, we, we have uh
presented to this Committee
with the unfunded liability
as well as to uh legislative
finance as well.
>> But did they actually
take an action
to give you
supporting documentation or a
letter to the LFC?
>> Uh madam
Chairman and Senator
Pinto?
Well wishes we've
received.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you and
uh Representative Lundstrom
one more time. >> I just
want to make one final comment. Thank
you for indulging me madam Chair.
I just think it's important for the
Committee to know, to
stabilize these, these
in these uh retirement
funds is an
investment in the new Mexico
economy because
what it allows for, it
allows for people to
actually plan
if they know that they're going to
have X number of
dollars to work with
and that they know that they can,
I mean, they, it allows
for understanding
what your discretionary spending
is going to be and you know that
you're, you're in
that field.
But I think it's important
for us to realize it's an
investment in the economy.
And this, this
legislature constantly
talks about diversifying
the economy. Well,
maybe we need to start investing
in this, in this manner as one
of those diversification
methods. Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you
representative.
So I do have
um
is anyone else
before a minute?
Ok, I do have a couple
of, of
um questions
reference to
um what some
of my colleagues brought
up. I'm not
sure you can answer. I don't know
and if you can't then
maybe tell us if you can
provide that information.
So
um
let's see going to
page 13
which is the benefit payments
page.
And
um
the impact of SB
72 by
creating the
fund, we
created that fund with
how much
um how much, what
was the amount uh initial
amount
>> uh madam Chair
there, there was no
appropriation um
related to Senate Bill 72.
It was a half a percent or
4%
increase phased in
over six years for
employees and employers.
And so after three years
on uh
one of these slides on slide
11, um
that was $86 million
coming in recurring
and that, that will increase,
we'll update those numbers and bring them
back. Um But it is, it
is a significant amount
that is coming in
recurring.
>> So that's part
of my
concern
and I think that was part of the
concern then.
Uh and
so now we're in a
different day
and we have
as many of my
colleagues have referenced, we
have
the ability
to increase
our investment,
meaning from general
funds, excuse
me, and reduce
the burden
on
our
employees. And
that is
what then is
my next question?
And that is, is there
a way, could I ask
the um people in the audience,
please. We're
still in convening
if you could hold down your
your
conversations.
Thank you. So
if we were to
um
if we were
to
uh appropriate
um general
funds
to the investment
fund
in order to
reduce that burden,
right, would you
have the ability
to calculate for
us
what that general
fund appropriation
would be
if we were to say,
reduce the entire
burden, right?
The entire contribution
and just
in, in invest it into
the fund itself
and then let the investment
fund operate
as it should
as a way in which
to
further reduce
the long term
um
responsibility.
And, and I
think
so anyway, is there a
way to, to estimate or
cost that out
or >> madam
Chair on site 11?
Um The last
line of the
upper chart, uh
it would be, you know,
$8.9 billion would
fully fund us.
Um And
at that point, you know,
which I hope we get to this
point before I leave. Uh
Pera is
the coal actually adjusts up to
5%
based on our funded ratio
anytime we're over 100%
it's still variable, but go from
half a percent up to 5%.
But yeah, that cost to fully
fund the unfunded
liability would be $8.9
billion.
>> So yes, I saw
that. Is
there a way
um
to then right
now on page on that same
page 13,
you have um
that we are currently
for fiscal year
24
we're at
um 581
million
in the um
investment
portfolio.
I'm not quite sure what the percentage
is. I didn't
quite calculate
it between
that and the contributions
do you have? Do you know right off
the bat what that percentage represents
>> madam madam Chair? So on
that slide, that same
one, so
>> I see it
896
>> million.
>> Ok, so
what
what would be helpful
would be to take
that
percentage that we,
that, that
represents
that the employees
are contributing
to
and somehow
charted out
to indicate to
us
how or
what the appropriate
amount would be or
recommended amount
would be if
we were to in
from the general fund appropriate
to that trust fund to
remove the burden from the employees.
And then what year would that
be? So what I'm trying to
get at is that there's
got to be a correlation
between what we're already seeing
as our return on
investment right?
There is a there is
and our investment
and then future,
there's got to be a way to
correlate all of that. There
is a way I know there is.
So if we can receive
that because I think
what all of us are are
saying um
is resoundingly
clear.
Um
Excuse me, that
that wasn't
or isn't the best way
in which to
have an investment
fund
um
be set up,
especially when it's
disproportionate
to all the other factors
that are contributing
to um,
re
current
retirees and employees
not being able to
meet
um, cost
of living based
on whatever their position
are. So, I
would just recommend that,
that we perhaps look
at that, you chart it out, have
someone, uh,
um,
look at that because I'd like to
see my,
my thing
is that the return on
investment from
the time that we've begun
this, that
percentage is significant
to our decision making
as to whether we're going to
or can appropriate and
how much from the general
fund. So that's
the reason behind mine.
And that's, that's it. It's just
something that you can provide to us
in the future. Is that correct >> madam
Chair? We will do our
best. >> I know
it's difficult and you, but
you have, we have a lot of
uh entities, the State
investment have, have
um uh professional
staff and others that you could
probably share in
requesting that information
and how that can best be
mapped out for us.
Thank you. So there
are no other
um comments
or questions from the Committee.
So that will end our,
your presentation. Don't
forget to turn off your,
your um mute,
your mic
and then I am going to do a little bit
of housekeeping as I mentioned
earlier.
Um I'd like to break
up the public
comment into two
phases one right now
before lunch. And
then um again,
at, at the time that it was
appropriately marked on
the agenda, but we need to
know some things first.
So those of you that are
on um are
listening that are
online.
Could you raise your
hand right now
and let us know
if you are interested
in speaking during
public comment.
So we're going to, we have
approximately eight people
of those eight people.
If this is just
online, if
you can indicate,
then we have
um Robert that
will let us know the
second
part of this while we're waiting
for the online responses
or we have a
list of individuals
that have signed up
and I'm going to read your
name and when
I say your
name
indicate whether you would
prefer,
um, well,
the, when I say your name, I
need to know how many are
in a time crunch
or have other reasons
why they could not address
us at 345
and would prefer to address
us now before lunch.
So,
um,
some of your penmanship
needs to be
improved.
So I'm gonna go,
um, the first
person on this
is
Adolf Subia.
No, no, I'm not calling you up.
Would you just
tell me whether you would
prefer to speak
now or
later?
Ok. So you're open.
The next person is
Alex
Ma
Maes
Mares. Are
you? Ok, either way.
Ok. Third
is Rick Padilla
Bustos.
Ok. Would you prefer
it now? Ok,
hold on a second. I I'm not gonna
call you up yet. Hold
on. Uh,
Richard
Montes
prefer now. Or
later.
Ok, either.
Right now we just have
three and then,
um, dan
weeks,
but I think he's like, never
do.
OK. The third is
Elizabeth
Cori.
Are you, do you prefer now or
later?
Um Chad
Wilder
um Steve
Garcia.
I didn't hear you.
Oh, either. OK.
And then Steven
Astorga.
OK. And then
last is Juan
Diaz.
OK. So then what
um do Robert, do we
have any indication
to
for right
now?
OK. Hold on a second, hold
on Monica
and
Susie.
All right. So right now we
have
12346
individuals that would
prefer to go.
Now, now
those of you that raised your hand, I
didn't hear what you wanted to
say.
The table in the
back. Rebecca
will guide you to it.
Yes, ma'am. In
your,
are you going to speak?
Would you prefer speaking now
or in after
345
either?
OK. So what we're going to do with,
with the definite?
Yes, we're
gonna,
did you excuse me, ma'am.
Uh Did you sign up already
right in the back? Did
you sign your name? Yes,
you, you
did. OK. Thank you.
So we're gonna go ahead and begin
and yes, we will begin with you,
Rick.
Wait, hold
on.
Yes, hold on a second. What was your
name again?
Oh, you're Zubia. So you do
want to go up now?
All right. So sorry. Uh Rick,
we're gonna start with um
Adolph Zubia. Come up
and I'm gonna go through the
rules of
the presentations. All of
you already know that
we will have, you will have up
to two minutes up to
two minutes to
make your presentation.
So, um we
will be
timing, Rebecca. Are you gonna
time or?
Ok.
So we will
um indicate to
you when your time is
up
and we'll begin with you. Go
ahead. >> Can
I start? Ok. My name is Adolf
Zubia. I am representing
myself and maybe some other retires
from Las Cruces. I retired
as fire chief, uh about
15 years ago back
there. Uh I'm on
the RP and M board
but I'm not speaking for them
and I also happen to be running for
the power board this year.
Uh My comments May upset
some of you right from the
get-go, but I can tell you I'm
very appreciative of the opportunity to
get before you. And I do
appreciate some of the comments that I
heard from some of the
uh board Members
specifically, uh Senator
Padilla and legislator
Lundstrom. Uh Some
of the comments you May make me think
there's hope for the
retirees in
the coming years to get the cola.
It's something that is
rather sad
that, that we haven't
and I speak on
behalf of them. I, I get a
pretty good compensation so I'm
not too concerned and yes,
my social security is very limited,
but that's not the issue. I
think it's the issue of fairness of
trying to treat the individuals that are
out there hurting
economically. And uh
just to give you the examples,
the numbers you have, you probably
have better numbers than I, but
inflation has gone over 20%
since 2020. And
we Aspar retirees
have only received up until
this year. Half of a
percent. We are
absolutely being short
changed on this and
the, the pa fund
and the fact that it's not actu
sound like it should be,
uh, the burden of that is
being carried by retirees. And
that's unfair and I bring that
point up because I'm
disappointed in what happened this past
legislative Session. There was some
bills presented, they
didn't go far. Uh, but
one of the big things that really
upset me was, uh, when
I got wind that, uh, the
legislature and the Governor
approved the bill and it was
Senate Bill, I think
165 that
basically indicated
that you guys, when I say
you, the legislatures
were, were
authorized an increase
in their pension by
50%
and it was
done not by any kind of
cola or any other process,
but by having Senate
Bill 165 pass,
you have a multiplier
that multiplies, uh
your per diem. And
after 10 years you start
getting a pension
that adds up to about
$3000 a year after
that. And, and to
me, that's sad that you
as leaders of the State
are out there giving
yourselves.
I'm done. >> Complete your
statement if you can, but your time
is up. >> It's just kind of
hypocritical that you're, you're
taking, taking
a leadership position and just like,
and I'll finish it with this statement.
My mom raised 11
kids. She never ate
until the rest of us were fed.
You're in that leadership position,
please show
us that leadership in that.
Thank you. >> Thank
you very much.
Next, we have
um
Rick
and just remember you have two minutes.
Thank you
>> for a lot of colleagues. I
worked 25 years with the City
of Albuquerque and I just felt
that uh I'd like to be
here. I saw
some son Maga. I
was born in Vegas. I like
that,
Mr. Padi. I know him
personally and a few
legislatures I went out
to the legislature and I saw, but
what I'm saying is
uh with the pera, we
haven't got a raise.
Uh 2% cola since
2019 sounds
like. And every
year I see a lot of
people, the legis
the legislator trying to
get it through, but it never
happens. Maybe we
need to get the right Governor
in this next time.
See, hopefully it will
and uh Mr. P has
always tried to help us out
and a few others, but uh
I have three boys in the
pera and I told him you
guys need to put in more
money for me to get
a little higher raise every
year because it's only right
that you do. I
covered your rear and I got
to cover mine. So
in all honesty, I feel
it's a too many
a thing right here. I did it in colledge
but I could do it right now. We just
feel like we need to look
to represent.
You guys are representatives to
help us get that 2%
every year because you know,
I've, I've been retired since
2004 and every
time I see it going lower and lower
and lower, I mean, 2%
come on and I feel do a
scale, do a scale.
Get the ones who get 50 per,
50,000, give them
a half percent of one to give
40 per, give them two
per uh 1%
2% do it that
way, but just don't give
nothing a 0.5.
They feel like a slap in the face
and then they were giving us a little,
uh $900
thing a year. And I says, well, ok,
so that's going to keep us going for
about three months.
So I just feel that
thank you for your opportunity
to talk to you guys. But uh
think of all the
overall picture
and we all spend our money in New
Mexico and that's what we
do. All right. Thank you.
>> Thank you very much.
Next we have
Elizabeth.
I can't pronounce your last name,
so I'll let you do it.
>> Good
afternoon,
madam, Chair
representatives. Thank
you Senators. Thank
you. Thank you for all
that you all are doing. Will you
State your name? Thank you. I'm
Elizabeth Cooper.
Um I
uh retired after 25
years in, in government and I
was always in finance
capacity.
I wanted to let you know
that um there was
a actuarial
review that had been
done in 2011
and it was bucks
um from uh
Colorado, they were an
interview. They were an
independent
interviewer
that the legislature had
hired um
that
um audit
is not on
the website anymore, but I wanted
to bring it to your attention
because that audit
reflected
that um there
were serious problems in
the way that P er
E was
calculating
uh the retirement
programs. And
uh there were
um calculations
uh that were explained
where um they made
recommendations including
that um
the current employees
contributions were not
being calculated at that
time.
Um And they made a
lot of different
recommendations and they
stated that
these recommendations
gave ample time
to examine the financial
validity of the
types of investment strategies
and the rate of return on the
fund due to
market stabilization
within five years. As
stated by the auditors
based on economics
and forecasting, the
investments made have
peaks and highs
and lows and
investors are trained
to meet those challenging
expectations.
So if you would go back and
look at those reviews,
they stated that
we wouldn't even have
to change the
laws if their
recommendations would
have been
implemented.
Um And my question
is now um
are independent reviews
still occurring
or is it p er A
doing actuar
actuarial
studies?
Um I really think the
legislature
uh May
want to look into that
and um I
also believe too that
working in government for a long
time and having these permanent
funds,
um we've
increased the amount
of money
that the State
is garnering and because
the State is
growing, we're
going to continue
growing, we're gonna have a lot
of growth in our
budget. So
those are one things that some of
the things that you could look at. I
have various things, but I
will present a letter
to you of
some of these recommendations that
were made. Thank you
so >> much. That would be very helpful.
Thank you. So
next on the list and I'm
gonna uh
is Chad Wilder
followed by Steven
Astorga.
>> Good afternoon. I'm Chad Wilder.
I retired from the Albuquerque Police
Department in 2012.
Um, very quick
comments. Um I appreciate
the opportunity. Um
I,
as part of our hiring
package, we had
certain things. A 3%
cost of living adjustment was
promised to us. A take
home car was promised to
us many,
many things. And that's part
of there's officers that came
from other parts of the country
to work here to die
here because it was that
important to have a good
retirement.
And I made
a decision to come here from out of
State and I've stayed here because I
love the State.
I don't love what they're doing to our
pay and anything else,
I appreciate the fact that
we're talking
about putting funds into
this because
being unfunded means we can't
pay our bills and that's
unacceptable.
So with all the
extra money that we have
this possibly coming in from
oil and gas,
why don't we sure up
this retirement fund,
what are we saving it for?
People are dying every day
because they're hungry. You
know, not all of us.
I didn't retire as Chief of Police.
I don't make 100 and 50 grand a year.
I'm not even gonna tell you because
I live in a poverty level
because of, but I don't
have to work.
That's because of personal choices.
You know, but like I said, the
fact that we are now looking
at putting
a stop to this loss.
I mean, I appreciate that and I
hope it happens because
we were entitled to that.
We were promised that
and they, they said, well,
we can't pay our bills. So now you
get half a percent. That's
$30 a month for
me.
Significant.
Thank you. >> Thank you,
Mr. Wilder. Thank you.
Next, uh Steven
Astorga
>> madam, Chair
Members of the Committee. My name
is Steven Astorga.
I uh,
represent, ask
me, uh,
retirees.
Uh, most of you know
me, um,
I've, uh,
represent most of
ask me retirees plus
the 46,000
retirees that are, that are
out there.
Uh, my Members
stop me at one minute. I'm going to
give it over to, uh, please.
Um, my,
um,
issues
are
my Members
are hurting
0.5
to support
their Children, their
grandchildren,
household
transportation,
food, to put food
on their tables.
Representative Stephanie
Stefanie Annex
should know that. But
the amount
of
cost of living we got
this this past and last
year. I'm
asking you please
help us.
We need your help.
I want to turn over to
Betty.
>> Could you State your name
please? My name >> is Patty
French and I'm
the treasurer of Ask me and I'm
also the treasurer of our P and
L. So
I said on the P board.
So I just want to get down to brass
tax. Let's
look at what actually is
the unfunded liability.
The most unfunded fund
that we have in there is
fire who owes the
most is the
State. But when
Senate Bill 72 was
passed, they didn't take
into consideration
which plans were
severely unfunded
and making those employers
and those employees help
shore up their fund.
They put the unfunded
liability on the
backs of us retirees.
Now, I retired
from municipal, but
my plan is a lot better
funded than say,
fire. But yet,
because the funded
ratio that they give
you is the average of all of
the unfunded. So
my cola is
affected the same as
everybody else's. Although
my fund municipal
that I contribute to is
better funded. At our last
RP and L meeting, I
asked the person on the board
since Senate Bill 72
passed, how much
has the unfunded liability
decreased?
And they said very
little. And I said,
exactly. And
how much did us retirees
lose in our cola
and the cost of living
that all, uh,
current working employees
got a very good raise
in the last couple of years.
Whereas retirees
did not. I
retired in 2020
I think my total
cola that has
affected my base
salary is maybe
$30 or
35. And let me
tell you, one of the copays
on my medication is
over 600 a
month.
>> Thank >> you. >> Thank you very
much for, to both of
you. Thank you for your
time.
Um We have next
Loretta,
I can't read your
last name. So when you come forward,
if you would State your name,
please.
>> My name is Loretta mc
Cosby. I
worked with the city for
26 years. Eight
months. I'm
getting close
to 30,000 a
year. I'm looking at
the legislative retirement
plan
for 10 years of service.
30 days a month. You guys
earn 29,000 a
year. I believe you
get a cost of living of
2%. We get
0.5%.
I want to know how
any of you think that's
fair. That has
to change.
Thank you.
>> Thank you very much.
That is it
for the people that are present?
Now, we're gonna go to
um those
that are online.
Hold on. You want to be
also.
Oh Miguel, sorry,
go ahead. Come
forward.
>> Thank you, madam, Chair
madam, Chair Members of the Committee.
My name is Miguel Gomez. I'm
the Executive director
of the retired public employees
of New Mexico. We
represent uh the
all the retirees.
Um And
as you heard earlier today,
I, I think what needs to be made
clear is that this is a
real hardship on
retirees, many
retirees um
support their grandchildren.
And so this, this is a a
serious issue. But
I think, I think the biggest question
and the biggest fallacy in
error that, that that hasn't
been addressed is the
issue of being fully
funded.
There was a seminal study done
by the Brookings Institution in
2019 that said
it's not necessary to be fully
funded. That, that if the
fund is, is at 70
75% that's a
healthy, um,
fund that's sustainable.
And that's all we need. It's much like social
security. It's because
the current employees pay
for the retirees
retirement and that keeps
going on and on and on.
If you have a private business,
you want to be fully
funded because if the
business goes out of the, you know, goes
bankrupt, then those
employees won't be harmed.
But with, with the State,
the State has mechanisms
to, to address any
shortfalls just like they did in
2013 and
2020. And
so, so it's not necessary
to have that have that
fully funded and, and, and that
leads to a lot of errors and a lot
of assumptions, this
fund is a healthy fund.
We can get better
but, but the retirees
need some help right now.
Um There's, there's
actually a professor
from the University of California at
Berkeley that puts it even
more bluntly and says that
that's just a huge error to,
to try to
fund these, these retirement
pensions fully funded.
So what, what I would suggest that
at a minimum we need to do the,
the um 13th
check concept.
Um And, and still let
the, the, the reforms
from 2013 and
2020 um
continue to, to
improve the funds. But,
but I, I would urge you to, to
find some relief for, for
retirees right
now. Thank you madam
Chair. Thank >> you very
much. So
now I'm gonna go
to
two individuals that are
online. I'll
begin with uh Monica
Montoya. When you come to the mic,
please identify
yourself and remember that we
have two minutes
for your
presentation.
Did you hear Monica
Montoya?
>> Yes. Can you hear me? >> Yes,
go ahead, proceed.
Thank >> you. All right.
Thank you. My
name is Monica Mato
and I am a
retired
employee of the city
of Santa Fe,
retired in
2005 and
have been
receiving the pension
since that time. And now,
number one, I wanted to thank
all of you for, please. I've
been, I've been very concerned
about P er, a
and how it has affected
my ability to,
to, um, to
live since I
retired. And so I'm
grateful that you guys are all looking at
this, uh, just maybe
wanted to put a little bit
more of a face of the
folks that, whose
lives you decisions
in you had today. And a
lot of you are retired
government employees
as I am, as my father
was, um, two of
my step of my Children
are government
employees.
Um A lot of
my friends retire
around the same time that we have
and this, the retirement
benefit is very important
to us. We
all worked a long
time for government
in the service of government
with the idea that
when we're old
and grumpy, some
of us, I must say
myself would have
the ability to support
ourselves in older
years or older years.
Um And
so I'm asking you to please,
you know, consider, I know there's a
lot of budget issues
and that to consider.
But please consider that
these are real folks out
here who are
um you know, de
dependent on
the pensions every
month to, to,
to live.
Um And so just
please consider, as
I ask you to, please just
consider there's a lot
of real folks out there who
are being affected by
your decision in this
um in this issue.
And by any means, there
is a, a way to for
you to take care of,
of us. I hope you
do. Um And
that's all I have to say. Thank >> you
guys. Thank you very much.
Next online we
have uh Susie
>> Hart.
>> Suzie
Hart.
>> Hello. Can you hear me? >> Yes,
go ahead, proceed.
>> Ok. My name is
Susie and I want to thank
you,
>> Susie. You were
muted
out.
There you go. Yes,
go ahead.
>> Um I want to
thank you for
this opportunity to
speak. I
was hired in
2008
and I worked
through the period of
time
where
there were
furloughs,
there were salary
freezes. There were
high,
a good tension
is like because they
just gave themselves
one. So
I would hope that they would
consider those
of us who just went to work every
day
and uh try
to do something for us. Thank
>> you.
The final
online is uh
Michael
Fisher.
>> Yeah, that level one >> from my
>> audio.
>> You're good. Go ahead and
proceed. Thank
you. >> Thank
you, madam and thank you for the honor. Good to
speak with you all today. I'm a retired
Albuquerque police
officer and
I just want to make a note that
the Majority of us in public
safety. We
swore all to the State of New Mexico.
We did our part and
we all walked away with mental and
physical scars to go with
it all. We've
asked of our State government
to provide a financial
future for us for everything
that we've done for our State and
our communities.
It sounds like you guys have a plan,
but it seems like most of us
will be dead before we even get to see the
benefits of this plan.
And that's unfortunate because
you guys mentioned earlier that
there is a mortality rate that you guys
look forward to. I'm sorry,
not look forward to, but there's a mortality
rate that dictates when
we'll be solving that.
And it does seem like a
Majority of us that are retired
right now are gonna
pay the brunt of that. And that's not
fair
for food,
for the backbone of the State.
We've done our part and we just asked
for our government to take care of this a
0.5% for the second year
in a row, bill, your physical
gaps a month. And
I really think the State needs to do
better and that's all I really
got to say. Thank
you. >> Thank
you, Mr.
Fisher.
Ok. So
uh that completes all of our
uh those
individuals that wanted to provide
public comment before
lunch. Uh One
of my, our colleagues on
the Committee has requested to
make a
quick comment
uh due to its
relevancy to
our discussion and
then followed
by uh representative
Rehm comment.
I will then invite
our um
Committee to
proceed for lunch
and then we will
return um since
it's all gonna be here
on time for
115. So
representative,
>> thank you madam Chair. I
was listening to
the comments and I came up
with an idea
what if
we went ahead and
had Pera and, er,
b they, and I'm just picking
an age, but
let's assume that we pick
at age 60
above you get
a specific
retirement
cola. And the
reason is, is when
you're below age
60 or
62 or
65 whatever they
wanna choose,
you're able to work
at another job.
And so we're looking at
true retirement.
And so that under
age 60 would
receive the current
cola and
the over 60
would receive a
specific
cola. But I don't
know if Greg
and, and all, if they would
look at that and see
if that works. I, I
don't know.
Anyway, thank you madam Chair.
>> That's another
suggestion, another approach
and then they can work
on considering that
that would be good.
So
that's, that ends our public
comment point.
There is um
lunches provided for
everybody, but we
want our Committee Members
to partake in the
um lunch first because
we're short on time and
we need to come back
and then um after
lunch, I will acknowledge
everyone who contributed
to our lunch today.
Thank you. So we're gonna
go ahead and take lunch. Thank
you Members. Go ahead.
