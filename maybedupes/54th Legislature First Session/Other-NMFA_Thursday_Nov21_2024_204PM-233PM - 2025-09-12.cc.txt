Somebody's got
Yeah.
Good to see you. Nice to see
you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, uh, members of the
board, um, this memorandum is
regarding the opportunity
enterprise, commercial
development round 3 project
recommendations.
Uh
As some background, the OERF was
established by the New Mexico
legislature in 2022.
It provides loans for commercial
development to attract and
expand businesses in New Mexico.
The loan program provides
financing for building and
renovation projects that
increase the inventory and
commercial space.
Allow existing businesses to
expand operations and achieve
economic benefits for the state.
The 2024 legislative changes
emphasized non-owner occupied
properties in order to achieve
the goal of increasing the
commercial space inventory.
Our process, uh, takes
applications and scores them
based on the following criteria.
Uh, location of the developer 5
points, community impact, 35
points.
Location and building type 25
points.
Applicant needn't ready
readiness 25 points, project
designation 10 points, total of
100 possible.
Points.
A minimum score of 60 is
required for applications to be
prioritized to the OERB uh for
consideration.
Commercial projects whose
applications have been reviewed
and scored, then recommended.
by the OE
Review board will be entered
into the NMFA underwriting
process.
The review and scoring team was
made up of 3 NMFA and 3 NMEDD
staff members.
Process also includes an initial
complete and accurate review.
By the EMFA staff training the
review team and a facilitated
scoring review, reconciliation
meeting.
Some observations and results.
Out of 21 inquiries, 12 complete
applications were submitted,
representing 8 New Mexico
counties, 6 urban and 6 rural.
Only one applicant was unable to
demonstrate a funding gap.
Uh, what we refer to as the but
for test.
And 6 were determined to be
primarily owner occupied.
Which made them ineligible.
2 applications scored 60 plus
points, new space, a shared
aerospace Center in Albuquerque
and the Navajo Nation Division
of Economic Development project
for a manufacturing facility in
Church Rock.
The chart,
See on the memo shows the
application sorted from highest
to lowest for your reveal.
Staff recommends, uh
The two projects highlighted in
green.
I just can't.
for approval.
And as always appearing on the
OERF priority list is not
guaranteed that the project will
receive funding from the OERF.
The book
that you have
with all of the application
information is organized so that
You see the scoring from the
six-person team.
Uh, all the criteria, uh, all
the individual uh scores, uh,
and then following that is the
uh
Complete application that they
submitted through our portal uh
to us, and that is also uh in
Right order in your book.
With that, I'll stand.
Mr. Chairman, I, I do have one
question and uh
I think it's just me being
fairly new on the board here.
What is the requirement on the
I, I noticed that there's some
uh entities that scored high
enough, but they didn't meet.
Um
occupancy requirement. What is
that requirement if you don't?
Kind of refreshing the occupancy
requirement is 30%, um, Mr.
Chairman, members of the board,
uh, it's 30%.
More than 30% owner occupied,
uh, and that was chosen in order
to
Encourage the growth of the
inventory for additional
commercial space rather than
simply allowing a business to
get a new
headwaters for itself.
And Mr. Chairman and Member
Hernandez, and
In addition to that, um,
um this, this board and, and
the, and the
commercial
Development Committee did review
those policies and approve those
policies for the 30% occupancy.
So it
You see on on page 6.
Uh, those and
Yes that's psycho.
I, I don't know if I'm color
blind now or or.
But it's like a pinkish
orangeish color, and so.
Famine
Ah
So a salmon color, those if
The 1st 3 if they were uh were
not on occupied, they would have
uh been able to score high
enough to.
Yeah.
Questions from the
As from
Members of discussion or
Yes
German
committee
it
Um
Primary discussion was
Around
Those that score below
60.
Worseback.
and the component.
After
For much discussion, we decided
to accept.
Um
Is there a concern?
Sure
A concern
projects that we're seeing.
Seems like
Um, Mr. Chair, and board members
in terms of the rule versus
urban mix, um.
So what we have been seeing is
that um,
Number one.
cla m ation that should be
actually as a world project, not
an urban project, cause that's
in Galilee New Mexico, so that's
it.
on that part.
So we have one urban project,
one rural project that's move
forward uh with the two projects
that that the scored.
Or, you know, staff is doing
outreach to.
Parts of the state and continue
to make connections with um
stakeholders in in those areas,
um.
So I
we can continue to
is continue to do those outreach
and continue the whole train is
about the application.
we can
Uh
Foster some more rural projects
to um.
Through the process, but I
Yeah, it is something that we
are noticing, Mr. Chair.
OK
Let's keep an eye on that.
more applicants from
Mr. Chair, can I just say one
thing?
Ah
I've started to add to this
chart, which you'll start to
see.
Expanding in future rounds, uh,
Kind of a running total of the
money that has been
No doubt to counties and um
You know, we have some
limitations or no.
25% of the fund to any
particular county and some other
limitations as well. And so this
will start to be quite evident
as to how the money is being
distributed.
And I apologize for that typo. I
thought I had fixed that, but
apparently it uh uh.
Not passed and so in this round
we do have one urban.
And
Mr. Chair, I have a question if
I may.
This is yeah.
with your, your, uh, microphone
or I don't know if it's our
speakers on our end, but, um, go
ahead, we'll see you can you
hear me now? Is this better?
Now
OK.
I'm not sure. Let me see if I
can find an alternative way to
we'll see if we can hear you.
OK, on the
Criteria of
location of developer, how is
that determined
versus out of state, is it not
Chairman of members of the
board. Yes, that is correct. Uh,
that was simply whether or not
the
The developer was a New Mexico
business or an out of state
developer, and we were trying to
give a small 5 point uh bump for
in-state.
businesses
That's any other questions?
And we also discussed.
How much funding was available.
So
This won't utilize all of.
So
another round in the future
Yeah, Mr. Chair, I never call
this the next round is gonna
open up January 6th.
And and so we will make all the
funds available.
At that time.
So hopefully
Uh
During our underwriting process
on the NFA side we can.
underwriting process for these
two projects, um, and
possibly see it in front of the
board in January, so.
That's the goal.
Great. Thank you.
Um
Mr. Beck, do you feel like we we
have all the cakes worked out of
the application process at this
point.
Um, Mr. Chairman, uh, fingers
crossed, I think we do have.
all the king's worked out, um.
Always evaluating the
application and the policy, so
if we're going to make any more
policy changes, I think after
this next round, we will come
back and and do more policy
changes and
those policies back to the.
So we want to
Test the system a little bit
more to see how this is working
and if, if there's more
Uh
tweaks that we need to make,
we'll bring those back to this.
Or
Great. Thank you, Mr. Brooks.
I kind of feel like uh.
Getting smarter.
I hope so
We're hopefully learning from
our mistakes.
If nothing else
There's no other
Questions from members of the

And I stand for any questions.
Thank you. Any questions for me?
Comes
to make the comment that from
the
Similar issue with urban versus
rural.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just uh
one question so the process
after this uh do they.
These developments for those
that are recommended.
Going to underwriting.
Um, Mr. Chair, I'm E Hernandez,
that is correct. So once this uh
board approves of this
prioritization, the next step
would be it would go to the
NFA um and living your credit I
have to go through underwriting
and.
a credit analysis and then both.
the inFA board process for
approval.
Mr. Churchill 2nd
Thank
in favor.
Right, I.
He
She passes.
Um
for NFA staff I think we talked
in the past about getting an
update.
Uh, Mr. Chair, um,
Our
work it through a process and I
hope that at our next board
meeting.
Uh, give you a report on prior.
medications.
As of right now, I can tell you
uh verbally.
Um
2 projects that were.
That in my board.
one is called Mindam which was
uh uh
In studio
here in Santa Fe and the other
one was filmyard and
Albuquerque. So those two
projects have moved forward and
been approved.
We are
you
um,
eternal, uh, eternally the long
documents that we would.
for closing those particular
projects.
So the next step is start to
have closing calls and then
move.
And then we
those
Projects
and
Hoping that we would get them
closed by the March time frame.
Any other
Mr. Chairman, we have the
The legislative session starting
in January, and I think this is
our last meeting before.
The executive session.
Or or, or the
too long.
one
session
Um
Is there gonna be a request for
additional funding?
An increase in funding.
is
Does anybody have a
a request going forward.
Roby.
Um, Mr. Chair, remember Collins,
uh, and there I, you know, we
had a meeting with um.
LFC and one of the legislators
did bring up a request to
potentially add more funds uh to
the program.
Um, and so I
We do, you know, obviously we
would support um any additional
funds to the program, um, and,
and continue to get um get the
To get our footing with this
program out there. I think, you
know, what we have seen is there
is interest in a program and,
you know, based on um the their
early returns on the housing
side, you know, we have $55
million worth of requests, um,
and as we start uh working with
uh some clients to make sure
that they understand how the
application process will work. I
think we could utilize um
Most of the, uh, most of the
program, um, dollars here.
Um
Mr. Brooks, when you, with your
discussion with LFC, how did
that
receptive was it do you think?
They seemed fairly positive.
with those
guys, Mr. Chair, but it was, it
was a positive,
yeah.
Mr. Chairman, uh just a couple
of uh questions to uh Mr. Brooks
is uh
On the housing piece of this,
uh after these uh first set of
applications do you see any uh
potential fine tuning that needs
to be done.
And secondly, for uh
Those organizations that uh
Put an application in and we're
not successful. Do they have an
opportunity to resubmit uh at
the next round.
Um, Mr. Chair, I remember
Hernandez is uh two good
questions. So on the, I'm gonna
answer the easy one first. The
second question, and those
particular uh projects that
didn't meet the 60 point
threshold, yes, they can
reapply.
Um, and they could reach out to
staff to get an understanding,
you know, what happened with
their application and what can
they do to improve their
application and uh Brian's team
can help him out with that. Um,
the, the, in regards to the, the
first question, uh, we are
constantly looking at the
policies and seeing how we can
uh either uh tweak the policies
or if it's an application issue,
um.
How we can improve the
application. So we'll, before
the opening of the uh January
6th round, we will look at the
application specifically to make
sure uh folks that were trying
to submit the application,
understood what, where they had.
Uh, issues that and make sure
that they are fully submit the
application. Um, if it's a
policy issue, we hope to bring
the policies back to this board
after the next round. So it
would be in March because of the
legislative session and the
timing of this board, we don't
have enough time to bring
policies back and, and, and.
And make some changes. So we
hope to have uh results from the
second round and then and and
have real data to say, yeah,
this is a policy issue, we need
to change these policies.
Great questions, Mr.
Um, Mr. Brooks.
From an application standpoint
when we went through the
commercial application for the
first time we.
Uncovered some
challenging spots within us.
Um, Mr. Chair, um, I, I didn't.
See if there was any uh issues I
I think
We would probably need to reach
out to some of the applicants
that didn't fully submit to see
if there was any issues from
their side, um, I don't know if
it was a timing issue because a
lot of people uh may have
started their application late
and may not have had the, the
necessary time but um
I, I don't recall getting any
phone calls where anybody was
upset about the application. I'd
like to encourage you and the
staff to reach out to those both
that did it was that stopped in
the application somewhere.
Um, just to see, you know,
sometime if, if there's a
problem that.
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Chairman, we
could do that, particularly in
this first round or two
so much.
Next board meeting determined.
Any other questions or comments
from the boards?
Mhm
Yes, sir.
