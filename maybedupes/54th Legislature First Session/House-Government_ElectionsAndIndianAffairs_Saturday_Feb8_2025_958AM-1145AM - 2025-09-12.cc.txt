This bill is a uniform law that

And then it deals with the

The unfortunately have not

Non-financial.
Such as domestic services, which
is a sufficient basis for the
recovery.

It's just
That this is.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the.
And
Practice law for
almost 50 years New Mexico and
for the last certified family
law attorney, uh, I was
appointed as a commissioner
in 2019.
I'm very excited to bring
forwards, munitions of the
remedies.
In Mexico, a place where it is
very important.
Uh, uh, improvement to the law.
Uniform Laws commission, very
briefly is.
Established with delegations
from all 50 states and Puerto
Rico and other.
Political entities to draft laws
which are appropriate.
Um, for use.
I state that that need them for
adoption.
And are very carefully
researched and drafted.
And
And
Completely non-political.
Appointed
By all the 50 states.
Um
Last, 2 years ago, the
cohabitants Economic remedies
Bill.
passed with, it was very
favorably received in two
committees and passed the house.
And the last couple of weeks of
the session and uh did not uh
have time to be considered in
the Senate.
But it was a uh
very well received law.
There was one amendment which is
still in here to address certain
concerns of
Property interests and it is a
bill which I believe will
Address
And provide a mechanism for
dividing property.
Um, cohabitants are currently
the only
OK.
Cohabitants economic remedies,
uh, changes current law.
To provide a cohabiting party to
enforce implied agreements.
That it which is commit
permitted for all other citizens
and to allow a court to consider
equity and fairness in division
of assets, including
consideration of non-financial
contributions.
I understand
Thank you, go to the audience.
No
Uh,
thank you, uh, Madam Chair.
members of the committee, my
name is Jack Burton. I'm also a
uniform law commissioner from
New Mexico and I just want to uh
urge the committee to support
this bill.
I think it is very much needed.
In New Mexico. I've been
practicing lawyer in New Mexico
for more than 50 years. I have
seen instances where this bill
is needed and would be a great
improvement over the law
existing law of New Mexico.
Thank you very much.
Hey, let's go to Zoom.
back to the audience, closing
comments.
Outside
Hey, committee members.
Zamora.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
And
Read through the bill and the
Pretty much understand it, but
when it came to page.
I
Adam Chair and representative on
that last paragraph on page 5
and goes into page 6 to line 6.
And you kind of explain.
What that section is telling us.
Madam Chair and
Representative, let me just look
at.
Or, or I'm, I'm, I'm sorry,
ma'am.
I put on my glasses quicker.
So, page 7 of the last paragraph
in page 7, section section 11.
And it goes into page.
8
All of, all of Section 11 just
threw me for a loop. Can you
kind of tell me what that
explain to us what that's
talking about.
Madam Chair and Representative,
I just learned, um, the uniform
laws commission is very
thorough. It is a staffed with
only lawyers and law professors
and.
They've um ensure that they
They knew about electronics and
signatures in global and
national commerce.
Those laws permit an a state to
opt in and out.
And this provides that it
supersedes.
Um, one of the acts but does not
modify the other and those
things I am advised are
permitted.
I those
Federal Act.
And that's
The most I can address about
that, but we are in accordance
with those laws.
Oh, madam chair and the expert
witness, will you tell, tell me
your name again? Sarah Bennett.
Uh, Madam Chair and Sarah, I
guess that's why I don't
understand it cause it's
lawyers.
Attorneys and it's just a it's
just a part part part of the
bill to understand.
So, so my question, Madam Chair,
and, and Representative is
Isn't there a law in the state
of New Mexico that if two people
have been together for so long.
Is there, I believe in my, in
the back of my mind it's called
common law.
That, that, that if you're
together so long,
Well then, it's almost
By law that you're married by
law.
Or or the laws would exist same
as a marriage.
Madam Chair and Representative
New Mexico does not recognize
common law marriage unless the
marriage was consummated in
another state.
In that circumstance, we
recognize the marriage is valid
in New Mexico.
But no matter how long you live
together here in New Mexico, you
are not married.
And you have no rights, and in
fact,
Uh, during the period when
cohabitation was illegal.
Hala was developed in New Mexico
prohibiting.
Um, even the recognition of
implied agreements. If you live
together because it was a crime.
So that's the law we're dealing
with now and hoping to update
and provide.
Any sort of remedies, certain
people who have lived together
for many years.
believed they had many rights
and promises, but we're not able
to enforce.
They are not at this present
time. And, and Madam Chair and,
and, and Representative. So, so
what this bill is doing,
Is giving
A cohabited couple.
A means
Uh
The
split their belongings or their
assets.
After
They've been together so long,
it gives the judge the authority
to, to deal with it, right?
chair and representative.
You are correct
yes, uh, right now.
We know
Marriages the decline.
Sometimes, many people in our
state.
Live together.
Live together.
For many years, and there was no
profit.
families
Those that are in marriages.
Um, established marriages when
that marriage they part ways,
they have the divorce.
They have children there is
already a process for those, um.
For the for them established.
For the assets.
So
We know, I know personally of
people.
have been together for more than
20.
He's
And when they part ways, it's,
it's very sad, but there is.
Well that situation
That man
But sadder yet is that there are
no protections guaranteed for.
of the parties, so.
Sometimes it ends up being very
Inequitable.
So, Madam chair and
Representative.
Where in the bill does it give
us a time frame of how long they
need to be together.
Or is there a time frame in
this, in this.
Madam Chair and Representative,
there's no time frame.
Um, but
The, um
The remedies in this.
Bill are based on agreements
either.
Uh express or implied.
And um based on.
Equities.
So
There is no
One year or 6 years, there's no
uh express limit there, but it
is left to the judge to
determine.
What would be fair.
And what were the promise?
So, Madam Chair.
Representative or
There or wants to answer is
What if, what if
People get together and just
spend 3 or 4 days together.
And shouldn't there be like a
time frame or some kind of that.
Policy is to, as to where this
goes and I guess maybe in, in 2
or 3 days.
They, they don't have to go to
court to split up or, or maybe
they didn't accrue any assets or
Or something, but it just, it
just makes me wonder.
You know, if there should be
some kind of time frame up.
Sure.
Madam Chair and Representative,
um.
The 2 or 3 day living together
relationship, um,
Will not arise.
It's not worth it to the people
they've got their stuff and they
take it and they go home. It's
how I
saw it in my years of practice.
It is for people, I mean, it is
a difficult thing.
Assert claim.
And especially if they're not
agreed to, if there are rules
such as there are here.
These, these kinds of acts
facilitate the ability.
Settle those cases.
In and in family law more than
in any other area of the law.
Everything, almost everything is
settled in mediations,
collaborative divorce
arrangements, all sorts of
agreements as long as you have
rules.
You can uh reach agreements like
that.
But, uh, any specific amount of
time of actually cohabiting.
Would
Leave some people out who
deserve a remedy.
And include way too many people
that don't.
Is my view on it.
Thank, thank you for that
answer.
Uh
Madam Chair, uh,
Representative on page 3, line
21.
The bill states does not include
sexual relations.
So I believe that saying that to
be a cohabitant, you don't have
to have sexual relations.
Am, am I correct in the way I'm
reading the bill?
Madam
Yeah, uh, Madam Chair and
Representative, um, yes, um, in
earlier um court cases.
Um
The idea that anything was based
on a sexual relationship, which
was prohibited by law.
Was um
Forbidden, and so they've
exempted that and certainly it
would not be included in the
non-financial contributions to
the relationship.
Um
And, but cohabitation, that, you
know, the determination of
whether you're a couple living
together as a couple or not.
Might include sexual
relationships, but it is not
required.
And Madam Chair.
There is, is that in law and,
and I'll tell you why I'm asking
this question is because when I
looked up cohabitation in the
dictionary.
And maybe I should have gone to
a law book, but when you look up
in the dictionary, it says that
it it they have to include.
Or sexual, they have to have a
sexual relationship.
To be cohabitant.
And, and that's why I'm asking
you this question and wondering,
is, is this being taken out of
the law or is it in the law or?
Or or where we're at on that.
Representative Madam Chair and
Representative, uh, it is not in
the law currently. There's some
reference to cohabitation. It
often used to include um
Prohibited sexual relations, um,
but it's not in the law
currently. The defining term
here is couple living together
as a couple if you are not.
Um, related in a way that would
prohibit you from being married,
for example, and if you're of
the age of consent.
Um, so it, it would be up to a
judge and it's um assigned to
family court.
The court judges are accustomed
to.
Deciding who's living together
as a couple. Most couples know
that they're living together as
a couple, but that would be a
court's determination if there
were a dispute about that.
Thank you for that. Uh, thank
you, Madam Chair, that concludes
my.
Representative Rego.
Um
So, just to my understanding,
actually.
And I had a really good judge
that um followed this.
Um, is this just simply
That would, that is
Because some judges don't do it
and some judges do do it and
I mean
In my instance, we went to
mediation.
And
we.
Um
And
No
fi ci ent
Um, but that was the court
order.
So, is this just
of that
Madam Chair and Representative.
It, when you have two honorable
people who recognize what they
said to each other and are
willing to go to mediation, work
out an agreement, a court could
enforce that.
If you do not have that
situation for whatever reason,
and there are many, many.
Examples.
Um
And nobody goes to mediation.
You have no rights to make these
claims in court.
Presently.
You are not you are prohibited
from bringing up.
Um
The implied agreements that go
along with, if I put my stuff
here, then you're gonna do this
with it and go on all of the
things that you do domestically.
None of that can be enforced and
Things like
Non-financial contributions, the
fact that one person stayed
home, took care of the kids,
took care of mama when she had
dementia. All of the things that
people do in domestic relations.
are not recognized because they
are domestic services and
therefore cannot be taken into
account currently.
This allows them to be taken
into account in appropriate
circumstance.
You. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Witness.
Represent.
Madam Chair, and sorry for not
being here for and we did roll
call, I am in consumer and
public affairs this morning, so
I'm jumping back and forth, so
my apologies if I have to run,
run away after, but Madam Chair,
a couple of questions. You know,
I have some friends who had to
deal with something like this.
And when they spoke to their
attorney, there, there were a
lot of conflicting legal things.
I know one was immunal property
was one that came up.
And so, Madam Chair
Representative.
What is this bill do regarding
that? because I know some folks,
they get together, they have
property that that has been
bequeathed upon them by
relatives for etc. etc. And
then,
When it comes to the separation,
that is included as communal
property, and it could be a
family heirloom from, you know,
hundreds of years or whatever it
is, Madam Chair Representative,
how does this uh factor that in
regarding that communal
property.
Madam Chair Representative
block.
Community property.
is only accumulated.
During marriage.
So, the whole question of
community versus separate
property is something which is
only considered in the context
of a marriage, and this act has
no impact at all on that topic.
And there's a lot of things
that.
Impact your separate property
that you inherited.
Um, and
I won't go into that long
explanation, but it is not
impacted in any way.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
and representatives and an
expert. And so, uh, next
question regarding
It was a, a term that I'm trying
to remember what it was. I think
it was
Wrote it in one of my notes
here. I think it was.
Joint partnership.
Agreement?
Is that
Is this in any way affect that,
Madam Chair, and.
Madam Chair and Representative.
Uh, this pro uh permits.
An agreement for joint ownership
of property, and if those things
are signed if the parties.
Uh, have this sufficient
maturity to enter into those
forms of agreement they are
honored.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
and Representative. OK, so that
doesn't change this per se. And
then next year, I, I think we
touched on it a little bit.
We're talking about the
I think the word was intangible
contributions such as cooking,
cleaning, etc. and I'm sure
representative, how is that
measured? How, how does a fact
finder measure.
that because a lot of this
stuff, you don't have a camera
and say, OK, for an hour today I
made dinner and then cleaned the
house and here's pictures of the
great clean house that I did,
etc. How do, how do, how does
the fact finder measure that? is
it?
OK, regarding that or how is
that measured?
Madam Chair and
Um
These are equitable questions.
And uh family courts.
Are very accustomed to making
decisions such as that.
In most cases.
Um, this will not come up, but
there will be one.
Um, and for example, I can
imagine attorney representing a
client, demonstrating what it
would cost a higher.
A full-time housekeeper.
Uh, to manage a home or if you
that uh uh person also managed
the rental properties in the
backyard.
Uh, for the couple, while the
other one was permitted to go to
work and earn the living, uh,
perhaps that would be um taken
into account, of course, the
other side may present other
evidence like no, they did none
of that. I had to do it after I
came home at night. These are
the kinds of questions that uh a
finder of fact is very
accustomed to doing and
particularly in family court.
So, um, an equitable situation
such as this, the court will be
trying to do equity.
Thank you so much, Madam Chair
Representative and the last
question, so one thing that came
up in my analysis, I believe it
was about the
Some, if two individuals who are
not married, they buy a house
together.
And they have different
Let's just say they, they both
have different down payments. So
let's just it's
20% down payment. One of them
puts 200, 1 puts 100, and
So with that be something that
the fact finder would put into
consideration above all else
when it comes to paying the
mortgage. So afterward, if they
both paid
Half the mortgage, half the
mortgage.
And
How would that be considered
with the changes in this
legislation.
Representative and I hope that
answer was was not too
confusing.
Madam Chair and Representative.
Um, if you have an agreement and
a deed is often an agreement.
is interpreted to be an
agreement between two parties,
so if you own something as joint
tenants with the right of
survivorship that
Constitutes an agreement that if
one of you dies, the other one's
going to get the property.
Um, and so,
Uh
In the vast majority of cases
that would be um enforced and
Um
Under this law
Um
If there were a different
agreement.
That would be enforced and
actual contributions of money.
It's something we're not really
talking about here as much as
the as recognizing the other
non-financial uh aspects. So it
wouldn't be applied to a
specific piece of property.
So much, Madam Chair, and that,
that clears that up for me.
Yeah, I do have a few questions
on that, and I, I won't ask them
here, but I think that that's
something that we should
certainly consider.
I know that
This legislation, it's
Creating like an action.
Kind of
steps and codifying those things
that are best practices, like,
OK, like, maybe let's not run to
court.
First, maybe go to a fact
finder, maybe a mediator and
settle this, and then the last
would be.
for
But so, Madam Chair
Representative, thank you for
that. Uh, still some
Some questions on that, but I'm
gonna leave them there and I
appreciate today. So thank you
both and good answers. I
appreciate it.
Um, madam, if we're done, I was
wanting to make.
A favor or do pass.
Is
Madam Chair, uh, one more little
question.
How
How does this
How, how does this affect
alimony?
I'm sure
Madam Chair and Representative.
It is prohibited from uh
affecting child support in any
way.
Um, child support has its own
structure.
And uh whether or not you adopt
this legislation, child support
will be awarded. It might be
awarded differently if assets
are awarded more fairly.
So because assets are taken into
account when you
The final determination, child
support, that would be the only
way and as uh alimony is
something is a concept which is
only available to married
people.
So there is no alimony under
this step.
Thank you, madam.

Thank you. Uh, you pass on your
bill, representative. Thank you.
Thank you all very much, Madam
Chair, members, and before we
move on to HDR 5, I'd like to
acknowledge and introduce, looks
like we have a special guest.
or TCo.
Are you back?
Are, are you sure you wanna come
back?
OK, let's settle ourselves.
Close the door, please.
Hey, you may begin.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
committee members, um, HDR 5 is
a joint resolution which
proposes to amend the New Mexico
Constitution. It creates a
five-member commission, who then
will hire a executive director.
To uh assume the management
operations of the current
children, youth and families
department.
We all know, uh, and we've all
heard.
Recently and
In the past few years, uh, the
difficult situation that CYFD
has been in.
We believe that there needs to
be some
Major change in that department
for a number of reasons, but I
think the most important reason
is for the protection of the
children of New Mexico and also
to provide the kinds of services
that families need.
To
Madam Chair, committee members,
I have two distinguished expert
witnesses with me, and I'm going
to ask each of them to introduce
themselves and also speak
briefly about uh why this bill
is so important and
In terms of what it seeks to.
Madam Chair,
Alvin Selim, I'm a professor
emeritus from New Mexico State
University.
It came back to my home state in
1976.
And served as the director of
the School of Social work for 18
years.
And then Dish and I worked um as
the director of two centers.
Training and doing research in
the area of child welfare. Child
welfare has been my life. It's
been my career. My wife and I
are adoptive parents. We've been
foster parents, and of course,
this has been my area of
research.
I've
Reviewed and staffed over 1500
cases, most of them in New
Mexico.
I've consulted with 30 states
and universities for my career.
And um
I've had
Time to work closely with CYFD I
obtained over $15 million.
That'll be about $30 million.
In today's dollars.
With CYFD and its former
Agency Department of Human
Services.
So,
I think CYFD has one of the most
challenging.
And the other side rewarding.
Types of work of any.
State employee
But on the other hand,
We have slipped over the past
several years in the 1990s.
People, including the federal
officials visited New Mexico
because we had one of the best
child welfare system.
In the country.
But we didn't sustain it. We
didn't keep the
Things that made it successful
in place over the years.
What I learned is that there
Pre-critical factors.
And child welfare organizations
that make them successful.
This has been in a number of
states.
No.
Even countries that are
consulted in.
The first is leadership.
You have to have qualified
leadership.
That can inspire and sustain the
policies that we put in place.
A person has to be qualified and
needs to be able to serve
without knowing that the next
election's going to mean their
removal.
And we've seen enormous turnover
in secretaries and CYFD in the
night.
Several years
Of course, they bring in their
own staff and there's turnover.
And we lose months and months if
not years of time.
The leadership's critical. This
bill will address that with the
5 commissioners, several of
which the legislator will be
involved in appointing.
Those commissioners will have to
have qualifications in the field
of child welfare.
The second critical factor.
As the workforce and the
workforce.
If I could have you pause a
minute and think,
What is it like to go into a
home. There's been a referral.
Often anonymous.
And you're to make a decision.
Do you remove that, that child
or children, which we can do.
Great harm to them leaving their
parents.
One foster child we had, his
mother was beating him with a
belt. He was removed. He came
and stayed with us, who's a
teenager.
Uh, he ran away, the social
worker called me and said, Do
you have any idea where you
could be, and I said,
Harry went back to his mother.
No, he wouldn't do that. He was,
he was beating him with the
belt. I said, that's all he
knows. He's, he wants to go back
to his mother.
We need to teach her how to
discipline.
Without abuse. So the workforce.
Qualifications a minimum.
We've found through 50 years of
research.
As a licensed social worker.
And a licensed social worker is
the bare minimum then additional
training needs to occur as well.
Also part of the workforce or
all the other
Vendors, agencies that support
behavioral health, and of course
foster parents when needed.
The 3rd critical factor is
organizational culture.
You need to have a transparent,
open, engaged organization.
That is open to working with
agencies. One of the programs
that I think is
Kind of under
Under um most people's view.
And New Mexico was doing some
beginning to do some great work
as a 100%.
So organizational culture needs
to be in place. When you have a,
an organization such as CYFD.
It is now so entrenched the
public doesn't trust it.
I've had doctors tell me I will
not refer a child to CYFD, which
in my view, I'm not an attorney
violates the Children's code.
I encourage them to do it.
But we're putting more and more
children in danger when you
don't have a population.
Faith and the agency that's
And serves children.
This bill is just the first
step.
Back to restoring services that
I'll be happy to answer any
questions.
So.
Good morning, everyone. Madam
Chairman and members of the
committee, it's great to be
back.
Working on this issue.
I know you have a great many
bills.
Um, before you, this session
dealing with CYFD because it's
been such a prominent issue on
the front page of the newspapers
in, in the TV news in the
evening, and that's been the
case, unfortunately for the last
10 or 12 years.
What we have before you is
probably the most
Extreme effort at reform of all
the bills that you'll be
looking.
It goes far beyond simply
appointing a an
Ombudsman internally or an
oversight board external to the
department.
It tries to deal with the
underlying issue affecting.
The poor reputation that this
department has within the state.
A reputation that is not the
workings, not the result of the
working of this particular
administration, uh, but it's the
end product of many years of
decline.
Key thing about this is it's a
constitutional amendment.
This does not work unless the
people of the state say,
We're ready for a big reform.
This is a major reform. We, we
shouldn't.
But, you know, soft sell it.
This is something that would
make a big change in this state,
but I think it's something
that's needed.
The other thing that I wanted to
mention about uh it being a
constitutional amendment because
of the timing of that, it would
have no impact on the current
administration.
The current secretary is working
very hard. This is not a
reflection.
On their efforts
But it's trying to deal with the
underlying
Issue
The real issue in this
department is that it's become
politicized and the leadership
changes.
Too frequently
produce the kind of continuity
and consistency that it would
attract professionals to it.
As a result, it's in a kind of
a, of a downward spiral in which
the public
Yeah, the, the image that the
public has of the department is
so negative that they're having
trouble attracting the
professional staff they need.
And that then feeds the poor
image, because they don't have a
well-trained staff well prepared
staff.
Public's image goes down and
they, the two things just feed
each other.
I don't know what the most up
to-date figures are, but this
summer when we had a
presentation at the interim
committee, they were down to
something less than 10% of their
protective services staff.
was were professional social
workers.
The field that is trained to to
work in protective.
So, the point of going to a
commission is to make a dramatic
change.
That's the first thing. But the
second thing is to make it a
transparent.
Operation.
A commission would hold monthly
meetings.
The commission would move those
meetings around the state.
The public would be at those
meetings, the press would be at
those meetings.
This is not something that's
going to take take place on the
4th floor behind closed doors
with no one knowing what's there
until the press release comes
out. It's out in the open.
It's the kind of organization
that would be run by
professionals in that field,
regardless of their political
background.
It's not going to be whether
there's two Republicans or 2
Democrats, or it's gonna be, are
there child psychiatrists, their
social workers, or their
clinical psychologists.
Are there early childhood
specialists.
Are there physicians who
specialize in pediatric care of
kids with disabilities or with
pediatric care of kids have been
abused.
That's the kind of commission
you'd want to have.
A fully professionalized
commission which would then hire
a professional director.
Who would then hopefully,
Be there
Governors come and go.
Administrations would change,
but that professional layer
would stay there in that
direction.
Remember back to the days. I
mean, I'm aging myself here, but
I, I still remember when the
state engineer was there for 40
years. Steve Reynolds was there,
I mean,
Things changed in the state. The
one thing that was constant was
the state engineer was always
going to be there, cause nobody
wanted to get rid of a truly
professional operation.
I still remember when Leonard De
Leo was the Secretary of
Education under Republicans,
Democrats, it didn't matter. He
was the
Professional that you could
count on to be there. That's
what we need in this.
It's been said that one reason
that this should not happen is
that we have
good coordination among the
departments now.
I, I, I hope that's the case. We
see no evidence of that out in
the community.
And it may be that behind those
closed doors at the cabinet
meetings, there's great
coordination going on.
But to me, where the rubber hits
the road, I don't see that good
close coordination.
I really don't. I and the Kara
program is a classic.
What's going on with that
program.
And the
The, the, the program for
children who have been exposed
in utero to drug abuse or
alcohol abuse by their parents.
With the the early childhood
department is involved.
Education department is in.
The uh
Health department is involved.
The healthcare authority is
involved, CYFD is involved, all
of those are involved. It was
well if it were well
coordinated, it would be
operating really well and it's
not.
And it's not for lack of trying.
It's that
Coordination doesn't just happen
because you all belong to the
same team. It happens because
you're willing to work and
expose your decisions to the
public.
So I would hope that this bill
as, as
Major a reform as it is.
would not scare you off, that
you would leave it up to the
voters of the state to make a
statement that yes, we want a
professionalize this department.
We want to take it out of the
realm of partisan politics.
We want it to be a place where
consistent.
Transparency and
professionalism.
Thank you.
And with that, Madam Chair, we
said.
You
go to the audience.
Those in support of the bill,
please raise.
For one minute.
We'll start with my right.
You're
Oh, OK. Hi, my name is Stella
Matamos Duran. I've lived in
Albuquerque for 10 years. I've
held a couple of presidential
appointments under the US
Commission of Civil Rights, as
well as under Carter with the
HSAs, which are now Obamacare.
Um, I got thrown in the mix of
being a foster parent. It was a
neighbor. Swat showed up.
Um, the kids were taken, I got
them.
On October 18th, I
witnessed the child in the tub.
Um
It
Acting out something that she
had seen, so I recorded it and
regave it to not only the social
workers, but the deputies, um,
the secretary and got no
response. Everything that I've
had to do for the last year and
a half.
Has been going through a back
door to get things done. CYFD
has helped in no way, shape or
form. They, in fact, have put
blocks up in the first.
45 days, I had 4 different
workers. Um, now, when I got the
supervisors PPW should not have
the power that they have. They
have no education to have the
power to take a child or to say
that whatever's happened on
January 16th.
Um, the children were taken.
Or no appearent reason.
And else? Anybody outside?
OK.
Opposition
No.
Um, Madam Chair, members of the
committee. My name is Douglas
Carver. I'm the acting director
of the New Mexico Sentencing
Commission or legislative
committee discussed this bill,
and unanimously voted not to
support it with a handful of
abstentions, the members of the
committee were concerned that it
would be too disruptive to the
operations of CYFD and interrupt
the progress that they've been
trying to make in recent years.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, uh,
I'm Carrie Armijo. I'm the
cabinet secretary for the
Healthcare Authority. Um, I, I
really respect the sponsors of
this bill and understand that
this bill is being presented
with the best intentions of
protecting New Mexico's
children. However, uh, the
healthcare authority does stand
in opposition to the bill. Uh,
we think that there are some
potential real unintended
consequences that need to be
considered. The first is the
potential dilution of
accountability.
And rapid decision making. We
really rely on that, uh, with,
uh, CYFDA work very closely with
the secretary today. Um, they
are the legal guardian of uh our
most vulnerable kids in New
Mexico and have to be able to
make decisions and be held
accountable in a very clear way.
Uh, so I think uh we have
concerns about that potentially
being diluted under the
commission structure, um, the
second, uh, concern that we have
is that it's not in the best
practice, uh, so we know that
potentially, um,
There are, there are other
states that have tried this
approach, and it has largely
failed. I've, uh, a co-defendant
in the Kevin S litigation code
neutrals have advised against a
bill like this. Uh, and so, and
thirdly, I just want to make the
point that we have concerns
about destabilizing the agency
as well. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you. Um, good morning,
Madam Chair, member of the
commission. I am Teresa
Quezados. I am the cabinet
secretary at Children, Youth and
Families Department. um, and I
just want to say, you know, we
hear the frustration, we hear it
at the department, and I know
that there are so many people
that are frustrated with the
work that is going on at CYFD,
but I don't believe that
changing the structure.
It's gonna solve the problems
that we're all trying so hard to
work towards, you know, I think
this year we're seeing
legislation where we're, you
know, across the aisle, we're
working collectively towards the
same things. We're looking at
that carab bill that was
mentioned. We're looking at an
ombuds office or oversight, and
there are so many things that we
need to work together on to
change the structure of that
department. We talk often about,
you know, kids in offices. We
never talk about the 2000 kids
who are in foster homes
are an appropriate placements.
We talk about the lack of
workers and people don't want to
work there. We had a rapid hire
recently where over 400 people
came. Are they qualified to do
that job? Maybe not, maybe not
to the standards that we need,
but we also need to look at our
schools and social work and
boost those and not just assume
that a change in the leadership
is going to change the
department. So I strongly
oppose. Thank you.
Committee members represented
Samoa.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you.
Representative, bringing this
bill forward. Good to see you,
Senator.
I I you've been enjoying.
You
Your vacation.
So, so, uh, one of the things,
Madam Chap representative, I've
seen since I started serving.
is we tried to dismantle
something.
Kill it bit of fixing.
And, and I've seen that.
In different situations and
Different things we do here in
Santa Fe and, and
You have to ask yourself why.
And I guess this leads me to my
first question.
Madam Chair and Representative.
Does this, dismantle CYFD.
As to where it is now and starts
everything.
All over again or
How, how is this gonna affect
CYFD?
Adam.
Madam Chair, representative.
Now, it puts CYFD.
In a position where you will
have rather than
Politically elected officials.
That change rapidly.
For various reasons, they
changed leadership.
Department rapidly. So this will
stabilize and that will allow us
to sustain the leadership.
Um, right now, you have
Monitoring in every sense of
another.
Lawsuit that Kevan asked you
have repeated lawsuits that you
see in the papers, some I don't
think you see.
Where children are being are
Being represented in lawsuits,
um,
We've had the uh Senate Memorial
5 task force.
You know, we've had over and
over again.
Monitoring and we had the Joseph
A lawsuit.
Many years ago,
None of that's fixed until you
do a structural change.
And embed
Qualified leadership.
At the commission level.
And the directors.
I don't see how you're going to
change. I've worked with many
states.
That have changed. I don't know
of any states that have done
what we're proposing.
We're gonna be the first as a
native New Mexican, that's OK
with me.
We've, we've had leadership
nationally.
So what this does is it puts
qualified leadership in place.
Yeah
That's it and sustains it, which
we don't have.
And, and Madam Chair, and uh
Mr. Lee
What
I hope I said that right.
Addressed your name right. So,
so, Madam Chair and Mr. Lee. So,
What, what kind of comments
would you have to, to say about
the lawsuit that happened in
Oklahoma.
When they formed a
Some uh commission similar to
Madam Chair, representative. I,
I've looked at that. I, that
commission's not the same as
what we're.
Um, that was commissions, I
think there are 20 that the LFC
identified legislative.
Identified
No, none of them were what were
they used the term commission,
but it's not setting up.
It's like the public uh
Utilities, yeah, permission or
the office of the superintendent
of insurance.
That require enormous expertise.
To protect the public and, and
Madam Chair and Mr. Sali. So,
He made the statement earlier
than in 1990, New Mexico had the
best DYFD probably in the
country or, or at least.
Very top
Uh
But the CYFD that we see today
is, is just
Totally different. Would you
agree with that?
Madam Chair, represent the
structure is the same.
Uh, we didn't have today we
don't have a
Federal court order, you have a
settlement, which is different.
Um
And the governor at that time
put in place people who had been
part of the
Other side, the outsiders, the
professionals.
And we had a governor that
appointed a
The task force that was charged
with making sure that all the
social positions in the
department.
Or failed by qualified social
workers.
And we did that.
But then over the years, new
administrations.
A lot of those safeguards fell
away.
Because they weren't embedded in
like a constitutional amendment.
That's the big difference.
And, and, uh, Madam Chair and
Mr. Lee, and, and, and you
talked in your talk and
And, uh, about the stability in
the long term.
Uh, service that we need from
the leaders in CYFD.
And yet
These, these, uh, people that
will be serving will, will just
be serving a certain amount of
time and then they can be
replaced.
So how, how do you figure that?
That's gonna help
How do you, uh
Senator Madam Chair and Senator.
Thank you, and, and
Two points representative Samoa,
Madam Chairman and
Representative Samoa. 2 points
on that. One, the, the
commissioners are appointed for
staggered terms.
There would never be a total
overhaul, there would always be
some continuity.
No case would more than 2 of
them be going off after.
The other three would remain, so
you'd have that continuity, and
they could be reappointed.
There's no, no provision that
says they can't be reappointed.
They're, they're, they're not
full time. They're the
commission that meets when
there's a need for a commission
meeting.
Ideally monthly.
But the director that they would
then hire.
That is independent of any kind
of change, no term limits, uh,
if the director is doing a good
job, the commission might keep
that director.
for
period of years. If she starts
doing a bad job, it would
place their orgy becomes ill,
they can replace her.
So the continuity is there.
professionalism is there.
And I think that's the best
guarantee we have that the
The structure of the department
might not change. You'd still
have the same divisions.
You still have the same
children's code guiding them,
none of that's gonna change.
It's simply a way of making sure
that
What you have now is
And it's gonna happen in 2
years, no matter how good a job.
Um
Secretary Cassel is doing.
2 years the new governor will
come in and almost certainly
there will be a new secretary.
And that'll probably be somebody
with the best of intentions and
with great work experience, but
who has also been loyal to that
candidate and that's why they
got, not because of their
profession.
And that's the issue.
that constant turnover in that
position because it is a
political appointment.
All the cabinet
They all turned over.
And that's not necessarily good.
And so this is, we think
children's protective services.
It's too important to subject to
the same kind of turnover that
happens at A and for finance and
administration.
Or even the highway department.
This is way too important to
let.
Political ups and downs affect
the outcome.
And, and Madam chair and
Senator or, you know, I agree
with you on that, on, on one
side of the coin and on the
other side of the coin.
I see all the people that are
the boots on the ground.
At our local levels and stuff
when I talked to them.
Their issues are different. It's
not.
It's not that they don't.
They feel like they're doing a
good job.
And, and they see.
The results
And, and, and we all have to
agree that it's not 100% fixed
fixable or, or fixed when
we go through these
With these processes.
But
When I talked to the local
people, CYFD.
They tell me we're doing this,
but then we're not getting.
Not getting anywhere in the
courts or we're not getting
anywhere here we're not getting
anywhere there. So it's to me
it's the the
Relationship between the
different
departments or or
People that worked with these
kids.
Where we, where we're breaking
down and falling apart. And
another, another thing we have
Adam chair in the state of New
Mexico and
Presenters as
We have a big issue with drugs.
It's, but
Since we legalize cannabis.
And then the technology that has
come forward on the faces and
the THC vapes and everything.
When I pick up my grandchild
manager from
Oh
Out of the 8th grade.
And he gets in the pickup and he
tells me, Papa.
You wouldn't believe
Many kids are vaping beforeda
and after school.
And with the technology today
and what we did in the state of
New Mexico.
To make that available to these
kids and we, we didn't give it
to the kids.
The law says they can't have it,
but we made it available to
them.
And they could just pull that
vape out walking down the hall
and hit it.
And put it back in their
pockets.
How many kids in the state of
New Mexico are now spending most
of their time hiding.
And then this adds to all these
problems we have.
We want somebody like CYFD to
come in and fix it.
And, and then we don't support
them.
In a manner that we should.
And I understand
chair and, and
Re
Senator, and Mr. Lee that what
we're trying to do here.
But it's, it's our perception of
what would make something
better.
I have a hard time
Looking at this and, and.
And understanding how it would
make it better.
And, and, and
Maybe, maybe it would, would.
Uh
I wish it could be a definite
answer.
Uh
Madam, what, what are my other
questions I have is
Will these be, will these be
people that are just
I don't volunteer their time or
they're gonna be paid or
How, how's that gonna work on
the, the board members.
Madam Chairman and and
representatives on what the, the
issue really there is that, that
depends on how the if this were
to pass, there would have to be
an implementation bill.
piece of legislation that would
spell.
We don't say, I mean,
theoretically, it could, they
could be volunteers. I think
you're gonna get
Result if you pay them the way
we pay the public regulatory
commission or something like.
But that would be, that would
depend on what you put
legislature puts into
implementation bill because the
constitutional amendment doesn't
spell that out.
So, Madam Chair and, and
senator, there's no money in the
budget for this.
So, so it wouldn't
It would take effect immediately
and, and I don't remember if I
saw any dates as to when it
would.
Uh, 2027 is the date that's
contained in the um OK. In the
uh bill.
OK.
And uh
Madam Chair and uh
Presenters, uh.
Why, why does this have to be a
A constitutional amendment.
Is it just, is it just to take
it to the public and see what
Their, their thoughts are.
Mature.
Madam Chair Representative, yes,
that's exactly it.
Um, otherwise, the governor
would be able to veto it and we
would continue in the same cycle
that we've been.
In terms of trying to attempt to
um
for lack of a better word.
And, and Madam Chair, one last
question, uh, Mr. Sale.
Uh
Can you tell me what we had in
1990 that
Right
Why, why has it changed?
While you had two things, you
had uh secretary believe that
was there for 4 years.
And you had a total.
Professional workforce.
And you also had a very strong
foster parent associate.
And the secretary and
I think
Senator TC Pino, you were
director at, at some point along
there were very open going out
and engaging.
The community
Madam Chair, representative, can
I go back to your point about
How challenging these cases are
now, you're absolutely right.
Um
And so if they're that
challenging, why would we not
want the most qualified people.
And ensure that we continued
with the most qualified
leadership.
And workforce that we could
provide.
And we did that and we can do it
again.
Thank you.
And Madam Chair, just one little
comment with that is
I think the environment these
kids are growing up today is, is
so, so.
All the way from the cell phones
to the drugs to
The intelligence.
That the cell phones bring to
them and their knowledge of, of
all the different
Things that go on. I mean, my,
my grandkids are way smarter
than I was.
And I, I do believe it's cause
the technology and stuff, but
then on the flip side of that,
It's, it's how it affects them
and and where where we are
today.
Uh, thank you, thank you for
your answers and thank you for
bringing this bill forward.
So,
thank you, madam.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I'm
gonna try to make my comments
really succinct and I apologize
in advance, cause I have to
leave. I have another committee,
um, I have to present it.
Um
I wanted to mention, Madam
Chair, that, um, when I was a
city councilor and um we um
I had the whole issue of APD and
the court appointed settlement
agreement on my lap.
Um, which, um, we did create,
Madam Chair, as part of the DOJ,
a civilian oversight.
Um, committee.
Or agency actually it became an
agency and it had an executive
director similar to this.
Um, that had an oversight
committee.
Um
In my 4 years as counselor I um
saw several different executive
directors that we went through,
um, there were, there was a lot
of change in the membership of
the oversight committee, um, and
Growing pains point to that, and
as you well know, um, APD had
some severe issues, uh, Madam
Chair, with the use of force.
And that was why the DOJ
actually imposed the, the cost
though, which is settlement
agreement on Albuquerque.
Um
During that time, you know, we,
we
try to appoint
Um
People from um and they were,
they were volunteer citizens
that were served on the
oversight committee.
And
They were people who care deeply
about the issue.
Um, and some of them had, you
know, issues in the past with uh
family members or
Or had been involved somehow
with the, the police department.
Um
What I saw and, and at this
point in time,
Today, and this was, I became a
city councilor in 2018, went
through it through COVID 2 2022,
um,
The, um,
The difficulty that we saw with
the agency was was
These changes of people not
always being consistent.
And, and
We also had regular progress
reports.
Which was very, very important
to getting to the point where
we're at now at 96% compliant.
With the DOJ.
So APD is almost fully compliant
at this point in time.
Um
It was a tough time for
Albuquerque.
Um, having that oversight
committee was very important
because we from geographic areas
of the city of Albuquerque.
And
The thing that, you know, I, I
support what you're doing here
and I have so much respect for
Senator Ortizino. I know his
work, and I know that he, um,
and for our representative, of
course, um, I don't know this
gentleman very well, but um I do
know that
They have the right intentions.
Um, what I didn't see in this
bill is a reporting requirement
back.
And that, and that concerns me
greatly.
Because
Setting up the agency is one
thing, having the oversight
committee is another, and then
it also kind of concerns me,
Madam Chair, that the
The oversight committee is
coming from
Internal from the government. I
mean, it should be.
I don't see people from various
quadrants of the state.
And that concerns me somewhat.
Um
I put this out because I just
want, you know,
More discussion on this issue.
Um, I don't know that this is
the right thing. I know that.
There are a lot of people that
come to me that talk about CYFD
and the issues that we have
there. Um,
I just wanted to put
The oversight agency from APD on
the table because I think that's
something to learn from.
Um, it's definitely an issue
that
You know, we over time, the 4
years that I was there, we had
to make multiple changes.
Um, so that
I hate to, you know, say what I
have to say and leave, because I
really am concerned about this
issue very deeply. Um, but
I think it's important to, to
look at.
Other
Issues, other instances date
cities and involved with that
are.
As critical and were in critical
crisis.
As CYFD is at this point.
Thank you, Madam Chair, for that
time and
And, and Madam Chairman, and,
and Representative Borego, the
Two points on that. First,
Reporting back would be an
excellent idea. I think that,
that the idea would be included
in the implementation bill.
This is just the constitution.
This is what's going to be the
language in the Constitution.
We would have to, the
legislature would have to put in
the details and the reporting
and any of the other things that
you want to include in the
actual legislation that
Covering the operation.
Second point is the, the
You, you referred to the police
oversight commission. This would
be very different from an
oversight.
This is not a body that's going
to be hearing um
Incidents
Overuse of violence or misuse of
of authority or whatever. This
is gonna be a policymaking
board.
This, this would be what in some
cities is the police commission
that actually runs the police
department. This would be a
commission that would run the
Children, Youth and Families.
Not one that would
It complaints were provided by
or and so it would have power.
It would have authority. And so
I think that that's the big, big
difference.
And thank you, Madam Chair and
and Senator, I, I do understand
that, um, but I do think that
just
See looking at a commission that
was set up because of legal
instance, um, in some ways, you
know, because of the
confidentiality of.
CYFD and the children involved.
I think that because of the
court cases.
It
That's the reason that I sort of
brought that up because there
are similarities in terms of the
court, um, the court instances
in this, you know, the courts,
um, but
You know, I'm not, I'm not
actually implying that it should
be exactly like that. I'm just
saying that we learn from
You know,
Instances where we have court
cases involved that are
especially at these levels.
Oh thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Ona Nonu.
And then
And then represent
Thank you, Madam Chair. um, and
thank you, Representativesators
and senators, it's, it's always
nice to see you. Thank you for
being here. I just had a couple
kind of technical questions. So
I'm looking at page 2 of the
bill starting on line 16, um,
where we're establishing
How the commission like the
qualifications for the
commission, and there are
several instances of
The phrase, um, she'll only be
removed as provided by law, so
my question is, so that provided
by law of how qualifications are
set, the method by which members
can be removed from the board.
Are we talking about just
provided by law mean that the
legislature would pass a bill.
Of rules and qualifications for
commission members, Madam Chair
and representative.
Madam Chairman and, and
Representative Anya Nyanyu.
Yes, it would be the
implementation bill that would
have to spell out exactly what
the, the specifics of the, all
the, all the Constitution would
say would be that they're highly
qualified professionals than
what those qualifications would
be, would be spelled out in the
implementation.
OK, thank you. Thank you for
that, ma'am Chair
representative. So then my
second question is just I'm a
little confused then on the
timeline of how that would go
with that.
Bill of
Precedent, I guess, I don't know
what to call it for this purpose
if.
Would that not, would that bill
be passed after the amendment is
passed, or would that bill of
precedent.
He passed after this bill gets
passed.
Madam Madam Chairman and and
representative, it could be
either way. Uh, some of you may
be involved with um
Anti-donation clause
constitutional amendment,
there's a
Parallel, um,
Implementation bill it's, it's
introduced at the same time, but
it has the phrase in it would
only go into effect if the
Constitutional amendment passes.
And so we could do that same
thing, but because it wouldn't
happen until 26. That's the next
general election. You could do
the implementation. If it, if,
if this constitutional amendment
gets sent to the voters by this
legislature.
You could do the implementation
bill in the 26th session with
that same phrase that only if it
were to be passed by the voters
with this.
OK, thank you, thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you
representatives. I was just

um, representative Lujan is also
a co-sponsor and representative
Chavet is a sponsored.
Standing in for us. Um.
This is the accessibility act,
we um want to create an office
of accessibility.
Uh, for a variety of reasons.
One is, is, um, in April of
2026, all state agencies, mobile
apps, websites must meet
accessibility standards, um,
technology wise, although, um,
We feel like the governor's
office has been doing a great
job and and is aware of the um
the
The need and the requirement and
is moving forward on it.
We do feel there's a disconnect.
We need a centralized place for
all municipalities to be able to
get information from and
assistance on. I just ran into a
County manager yesterday who's
like,
I didn't know about this. And
so, um, this would be an office
that would be housed within the
governor's uh commission on
disability.
It would, uh, the first year and
a half would be a focus on
making sure that we meet the
mandated the federal mandate for
the 2026 accessibility of our
websites and our mobile apps.
But the vision is to bring other
accessibility. We do not have a
centralized place. We have a
centralized place and written
processes for A&E for abuse,
neglect, and exploitation, but
not on accessibility and
accessibility issues. I brought
many uh of subject experts here
today. And so I'd like to have
them introduce themselves and
then make a quick statement
each.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, it's
an honor to be here today and
thank you, Representative Lujan
and Representative Cates for
sponsoring this legislation. I
also want to thank our fantastic
American Sign Language
interpreters for being here
today.
My name is Elissa, and I've
spent my career in civil rights,
disability policy and
accessibility compliance,
including serving as legal
counsel in the New York City may
Mayor's office, people with
disabilities. I've seen
firsthand the challenges
agencies face in ensuring
accessibility.
I'm here today to sport.
House Bill 120, the
accessibility Act is smart
investment that ensures equal
access and improved services to
the public.
HP 120 does three key things.
First, it advances accessibility
to state agencies so that no one
is left behind when accessing
public services. Second, it
creates the Office of
Accessibility dedicated office
to provide guidance.
Training and technical
assistance to state agencies
helping them implement ADA
requirements efficiently and
cost effectively.
Third, it provides flexibility
while prioritizing
accessibility, it allows
agencies to demonstrate undue
financial or administrative
burdens when compliance is not
feasible while still requiring
proactive planning to remove
excessive barriers over time.
Now, why does this matter?
First, it saves money.
By investing in accessibility
now, we prevent costly lawsuits
and last-minute retrofits while
tapping into the growing $58.7
billion in the accessible travel
market.
Second, it benefits a
significant portion of our
population. Over 16%, which I
believe is underreported of New
Mexicans live with disabilities
and nearly 20% of our residents
are 65 or older and will either
need these accommodations or
soon will.
This bill ensures that equal
access provides services and
independence effectively.
Third and finally, it
strengthens our government,
investing in accessibility
improves.
Efficiency enhances public
engagement and builds public
trust by ensuring equal access
to information and services. A
proactive approach prevents
costly mistakes, avoids
last-minute fixes, and creates a
smarter government that is more
responsive and user friendly for
all.
In closing HP 120 is about
practical and smart financial
planning by creating a
centralized approach building
in-house expertise and
integrating accessibility into
standard operations, we reduce
waste, vendor costs, prevent
lawsuits, and make government
services more efficient.
This bill pays for itself by
avoiding unnecessary costs and
ensuring New Mexicans stay ahead
of federal requirements rather
than resorting to costly
last-minute fixes. Thank you.
And go ahead.
Yes.
Good morning.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I would like to first

Thank you.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, good morning. Um, I'd
like to also thank
Representatives Luhan and Gates
for sponsoring this important
bill.
Um, my name is Geminiy Shell.
I'm a disability specialist.
Governor's Governor's commission
on disability.
Um, I want to put a little bit
of context here for this bill.
Um, this bill is not all about
compliance with the ADA. It has
a lot of other features, but I
do want to put some context on
the compliance issues. The
Americans with the, excuse me,
the Americans with Disabilities
Act is a civil rights law that
was passed in 1990, 35 years
ago.
Um, and was designed to ensure
that people with disabilities
have equal access to the
programs, services and
activities available to people
without disability.
Title 2 of the ADA instructs
state and local governments in
how to ensure access and remove
barriers under Title 2 state and
local government, state and
local entities must take 5
administrative actions.
Um, to be compliant. First, they
must assign a responsible party,
which is usually referred to as
an ADA coordinator.
Um, that's for entities with 50
or more employees. They must
provide a notice of ADA
requirements that's for all, uh,
entities. They must establish a
grievance policy that's for 50
or more employees, they must
conduct a self-evaluation,
that's again for 50 or more
employees, and then they must
develop a transition plan that's
for 50 or more employees. Very
few New Mexico state agencies
have an ADA coordinator and none
that I know of, know of have
actually completed all of these.
requirements.
The final rule from the
Department of Justice last April
requiring Title 2 entities to
make their websites and mobile
applications, accessible brings
the state's noncompliance into
focus.
But this bill is again not just
about compliance. House Bill 120
will create in-house training,
resources and support for all
agencies to meet the April 2026.
A deadline for web accessibility
and will help agencies come into
compliance with physical
accessibility requirements.
These services will also allow
the state to save money in the
long run, as many agencies will
not have to use outside vendors
and companies to do their self
studies and transition plans.
Most importantly, this bill will
enhance the accessibility of
people with disabilities to
state and local governments. Uh,
the Governor's commission on
Disability supports this bill.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So I
I, I just to conclude that this
is a very important bill. We do
not have a centralized area to
for um our, our members of our
state to access information and
assistance and referral on
disabilities by housing this in
the governor's commission on
disabilities, we will be able to
have one place where we can make
New Mexico accessible you want.
Thank you, and we stand for
questions.
