Or
Thank you.
Uh, specially, actually.
Uh, so with, uh,
How would you
The roll call, please. Yeah.
Yeah
Here.
John Senna.
Yeah
That was me, that wasn't him.
You
Thank you.
Look at the at the agenda, we
have a.
I would entertain a motion to
approve the agenda.
Some of it's presented.
Second
motion and second, to approve
the agenda.
All those in favor indicate by
saying I
was a post.
We have approved agenda.
Go to public comment. I don't
believe there's anybody in the
audience for public comment and
uh we'll go to other business.
I see
Grow square foot calculator for
existing projects and design.
As all of you.
Uh
can recall we met that on the
last meeting we
Uh, had a discussion, brief
discussion on this and there
were some projects that were uh
tabled until we could come up
with a policy to address.
This issue and that is
Of course, the effect that the
hose foot calculator would have
on projects that were in design
or had been recently.
Oh
Mhm
On
in ensuring that
Uh, they were within the
The um
Maximum limits and the minimum
limits as well, so we had.
that discussion.
And uh
Since that time, we
Um
So we and I and.
Mr. Romero have met on.
A couple of occasions here too.
To try and work out a policy.
So we've come up with.
A couple of options, I guess,
uh, one, we started.
Uh, as a staff recommendation.
On the first, which would be a
little more, uh, I guess,
generous and going back and
picking up any.
Projects that were still in
design.
And uh
Seeing how we could work those
out.
Uh
You know, after a little bit
more discussion, we
We found that
You know, doing that would be a
little more costly.
Uh, and we, we should probably
consider maybe a cutoff date.
Or cut off date for projects
that have been.
More recently funded and.
Uh
Not going back as far.
To pick up some of the others,
so we, we came up with a
It's generally a
OK
A option that would allow.
us to go back to 2023 projects.
And forward. That's where we're
at and I think that I was to go
over the, the two.
Ose
OK.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chair and
members. I want to first thank
you for um
Meeting on a short notice. This
is a topic that it needed to be
addressed sooner than later. Um,
so what you see before you, as
you recall in January of this
year, you approved.
The new growth square foot
calculator.
What wasn't done at the time was
to see what the impact would be
on any projects that were
already in design.
And what had been transpired,
you know, over the past few
meetings is we were taking it
and the counsel was reviewing it
on a case by case.
Um, terms and it wasn't proving
to be very efficient, especially
with the amount of projects or
the amount of awards that could
still keep coming forward.
Or um to get up in alignment
with the new calculator.
And coming in piecemeal and
spora.
So it was best that we come up
with a policy to address it as a
whole.
Uh, as well as, uh, provide a
timeline and deadline for the
districts to be able to move
forward.
So I want to go over briefly,
Mr. Chair and members on the
policy, um, both policies are
almost identical. There is one
area within the policy that
differs between option 1 and 2.
So as you can see, we have a
definitions um.
Peace to talk about what the
statewide adequacy standards
are, the maximum allowable
allowable gross square foot
calculator and what is
considered the previously
awarded projects, keeping in
mind these previously awarded
projects you have been seeing on
the financial plan over time.
So the othereligibility for the
review of these would include
projects awarded prior to the
adoption of the maximum
allowable growth squat for
calculator.
That are in they were in design
but not in construction. This
policy would not allow any uh
awards.
To come forward asking to align
with the gross square for
calculator if they are already
in construction.
Previously awarded projects may
request an increase in
traditional eligible space
within the new calculator total.
Previously awarded projects
awarded in 23 and 24 may request
the use of the updated maximum
allowable gross square for cal
calculator to adjust academic
and gym slash community and
bleacher space within the total
allowable square footage.
cannot be increased at the
expense of traditional academic
spaces, so what this would mean
is uh a district cannot request
uh additional square footage
above the minimum in gym and
bleacher space and then make a
core classroom space less than
what the minimum, um, states in
the adequacy standards.
The process to review would be
PSFA staff would conduct a
comparative analysis of the
original award to the new
calculator, which we have been
doing these past few meetings,
um, Mr. Valdez has really
spearheaded and taken a deep
dive into these um spaces.
Districts will be required to
submit updated project
documentation reflecting their
current needs and design
specifications.
Also, the requested increase in
square footage will be evaluated
and must adhere to the adequacy
planning guide.
So
If it fits within the allowable
square footage that the
calculator allows, it still has
to adhere to any of the um
information within the APG that
could possibly set limits on
certain things or do not
qualify.
Um, to be funded by the PSCOC.
Here are the adjustment
criteria. This is what we're
really need to be looking at
when reviewing these requests.
Adjustments in square footage
will be considered only if they
do not compromise educational
adequacy or program delivery.
Again, they cannot sacrifice
core academic space, um, in
order to get a bigger gym or
bleacher space.
Space in excess of what the
maximum allowable growth script
for calculator allows would be
the responsibility of the school
district. So you have the gross
square foot calculator if it's
50,000 square feet and they
chose to do 55,000 to 5000 extra
would be paid.
Or the responsibility by the
school district.
This is an area that this.
3rd bullet that you'll see is
gonna be the differentiation
between option 1 and option 2.
Option one is the as um Mr.
Miner could be the more generous
or the more um
Um
More generous one, if you will.
Projects awarded prior to 2023
that include requests for
gymnasium or community space
exceeding the minimum.
Outlined by the state statewide
adequacy standards may seek
alignment with the new
calculator.
But the caveat is the district
will need to pay.
And um for their local share.
So these particular projects
would not qualify for a local
match reduction or a waiver.
They would need to be able to
provide for their own um local
share.
And these again are just the
projects that are older than
2023.
Uh, then the last bullet is
request to receive any
additional square footage based
on the recent APG update must
adhere to this policy.
As you recall, you approved in
the last meeting an update to
the APG and there are some
changes that were made in there.
So we want to ensure that if
Districts that are in design
currently.
Um, see these changes and want
to ask for um any of these
changes and to be reflected in
their design, they have to
adhere to this policy and the
timeline.
The timeline is the deadline for
school districts to submit the
requests for revisions to
previously awarded square
footage is October 1st.
The final date for the PSCOC to
review and approve these
requests at the November 19th
EEOC meeting.
Chair, I want to um refer over
to policy number 2.
On the second page, bullet point
number 3.
This is where the two policies
differ.
Policy number 2 indicates for
awards made prior to 2023.
The state will not pay for
gymnasium or bleacher space
exceeding the minimum.
As outlined in the statewide
adequacy standards. Any gym or
bleacher space exceeding the
minimum.
Or the pre 2023 awards will be
the sole responsibility of the
district.
Districts may request state
participation in increase in
other eligible spaces within the
new calculator values.
Yes, if they will make a
recommendation to the council
for the maximum allowable square
footage for these projects to
satisfy educational and
programming needs. With that,
Mr. Chair, I'm going to defer to
um, director So Lee so he can
kind of expand on on that bullet
point.
It
Thank you.
the
So
What we have been seeing with
some of these projects, and this
is important context.
When the calculator was updated
in the news coming out of the
new adequacy standards. There
was not a significant
If any
Maybe a small change to the
minimums for
The gymnasium.
And Bleacher space, which I
consider kind of
Almost as community spaces not
as academic.
But the total square footage.
For the entire project.
Went up
Uh, pretty fair amount.
And so
You might ask
Well, then how are they
designing bigger?
Jim Spa
With the new calculator, if the
minimums really didn't change.
And it's like, well, they're
using the square footage that
would have otherwise gone to
classroom space.
And they're applying it to the
gym space. And it seems like
from my understanding,
They had an understanding that
they could do that.
Or at least the near term
projects.
Uh, as the state was updating
the adequacy standards in a new
calculator that they'd be able
to play within that maximum
amount.
The
To me, there needs to be a
cutoff because, you know, an
award from 2021 should already
be in construction, if not
completed.
And these projects are starting
to come back.
Older ones.
Wanting to sort of take
advantage.
of a brand new standard for
classroom space and apply it.
Into
Gym community space and so
I for up, you know, we gotta
have a cut off at some point in
time.
In 2023.
Uh, was what, you know, I'm
proposing just because that
would have been a period of time
that
The calculator and the adequacy
standards would have been in
flux.
Older projects would have been
approved under the old system.
Uh, and we wouldn't have
approved.
Uh, that kind of gym space, and
we really didn't change the gym
standards.
Between the old calculator and
the new calculator anyways.
I think
If, if we adopt option 2,
Um, Mr. Chairman,
We probably need the next phase
would be directing PSFA staff to
start looking at
That gym space calculator.
And we figure out as a counsel,
if we need to make.
Any other adjustments to it or
how we want to do that, or what
is amounting to in, in some of
these cases really, they want it
for community use.
And how do we deal with that,
uh, if we're focused on sort of
core academics versus
Having a really big concession
area.
You know, uh, more bleacher
space than what would handle,
you know, the student
population, which I see as as
valid in some communities, but
it's also is that the role of
council paying for all of those
things.
So if a district with an older
award.
wants to still do that and use
their own local resources to pay
for it, this policy would would
allow for that.
that Mr. Chairman.
After Entertaining dialogue
explains it pretty well. So,
Uh
It's uh
It's amazing that some of these
projects that are
I guess some of the oldest ones.
17
Of 19 2019.
And uh
Um, one of my questions was,
what does this mean in terms of
funding?
What does it mean if we
Go to 23 and forward.
You have an estimate of what
that would
Mr. Chair, so you're asking if
All the projects from 2023
forward.
Aim for funding.
For the additional square
footage, what would that be?
I would say would be close to
$160 million.
Now keep in mind, it's hard for
us to determine what would be
above the minimums without
seeing what the requests would
be.
Most of these have not come and
asked for that extra space.
So we don't know if they're
going above the minimum or
they're staying within the the
minimum. So again, this is just
aligning the original award.
To the new calculator.
if they came forward.
160.
And how many more projects?
From 19 to 22.
are able to come back under the
first scenario.
Well, Mr. Chair, all of them can
come back under the first or any
scenario.
It's just dependent on, um, how
much of it they will be
responsible for.
So
So, we know the impact.
Maximum impact, I guess.
would have with.
Going on.
Going further back would be.
Mhm. Of course, a lot more
money, more projects.
And these are again are projects
that.
shouldn't be in design anymore.
They should already.
Oh
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair. I
really appreciate the work on
the on the policy, um.
Those discussions and awards
were getting pretty sketchy in
trying to to to to weigh one
project over another and, you
know,
Essentially make value judgments
about
Uh, what was right. So I really
appreciate uh us getting to some
level of consistency and
standardization as we're
Uh, considering, considering
the, the proposals.
Um
I do want to say a couple of
things about the money, and I
absolutely, Mr. Chair, that we
want to be careful and, and
judicious about how we're
spending taxpayer money, uh, and
state money on these projects.
I, the way I've been thinking a
little bit about our change to
the adequacy standards though,
and I, and I actually I'm OK
with the 23 cutoff because I do
think at that point, things were
in flux and and there was some,
there was some movement, whereas
if you got your project approved
before.
Um, there's, I mean, we know
projects that got approved two
years ago in our our viewing
completion, you know, I, I, I
live in Losal most of those
projects were approved a couple
of years ago. They're almost
done, 2,22 elementary schools
are almost finished. And so I
think
Projects that have been approved
and have been sitting for years.
We need to figure out how to get
those projects moving. And so I
appreciate the cutoff date as
well.
I do want to say that if we're
going to
Seth new adequacy standards and
minimums.
That um for those projects that
have not been built or maybe
haven't finished design.
That it makes sense that we
would pay for those, those
increases to the minimums
because we've now established
that those are the minimum
requirements for
Um, educational spaces across
the state.
And so if we're gonna as a
council approve those minimums.
We should be responsible for
helping districts, depending on
their ability to pay, meet those
minimums.
I didn't want to clarify, um, in
the, in the, and we can just go
to number 2, there's a couple.
Small things I think that I'm um
I want to make sure on your 3rd
bullet under adjustment
criteria. This is for a words
made prior to 2023, the state
will not pay for gymnasium or
bleacher space exceeding the
minimum requirements. I do want
to make sure that we're not
shrinking projects that we've
already approved.
So let's say a project came in.
And they had already gotten
approved for a gym that was
somewhat above the minimum
allowable.
Um, because that was what fit in
their envelope at the time, and
then they come back and say,
The new adequacy standards allow
us to to look at classroom
space.
I don't want to shrink projects
that we've already approved at a
certain number. So I agree that
we don't want to let them come,
let them come back and ask for
additional space.
But if we've already approved
A gym at a certain square
footage.
I think the minimum right now is
6500, right?
depending on the size of the
school as an example. If we
approve that original project at
7000 square feet.
I don't know that we should be
going back in and making those
spaces smaller, even if they are
above that minimum.
I don't know that we should
allow them to add more to it. I
agree, but I just want to make
sure that we're not shrinking
projects that we've already
approved at a certain size. Mr.
Chair, Mr. Senna, to respond to
that point.
When we, when you approve an
award.
We don't see the program of
spaces you give them, let's say
it's 20,000 square feet.
Right? We don't, there is now it
is the responsibility of the
design professional to fit.
The gym space and everything
else in that square footage.
So what has been transpiring is
They are already the design
professor professionals are
already building or designing
bigger.
And then come in and asking for
the additional square footage.
So we don't see what we don't
even know if there was an
attempt to design within the
original award. So we don't see
that they were asking for a
certain gym space, and now
they're coming and asking for
bigger or less, because we don't
see that much of it. Thank you,
Mr. Shirt. Thank you, Iris.
That's really helpful. I would
just then, um, sort of.
Add to Director Soli said about
staff really getting at that
right number and quickly.
Um, again, Mark, I've asked Mark
to, to do some measurements in
some of the schools. We've
looked at some of the blueprints
that your staff have provided,
and I think in some of those, in
some cases that minimum number
that 66,500 as an example.
Uh, is too small, and we're,
we're seeing, uh,
communities unable to use that
space.
Um, you know,
I don't think we, every gym
needs to be a double decker, you
know, pit.
But if you have a, a game, which
is part of extracurricular
activities at a school.
You should have enough space for
people to come in and sit and
watch those games.
And so, um, making sure that we
get at that number very quickly.
Because what I'm afraid of is,
um, and we've heard this from
school districts already in
times of lean.
Where we required folks to
build.
At minimum essentially.
Those spaces have not.
Been useful, right? And they've
come and said these are not
usable spaces for our school,
but it's what we could get, and
so we did it.
And I want to make sure that
given you're right, we have uh a
finite amount of resources.
But we're not, we're not to the
point where we don't have enough
money to pay for adequate spaces
currently.
And I just want to make sure
that we find that balance
between fiscal responsibility
and usable spaces, and so I
don't know if you all have, I
guess the question, Mr. Chair
is, do you have an idea of how
long that might take to evaluate
some of those spaces of staff.
Um, and we, we think you'd be
happy to lend some expertise or
some support, however we can.
So that we're sure that we're
providing adequate space.
As John said at the last
meeting.
Those minimum requirements for
gym spaces haven't really been
taken into account in any
realistic way, because
They've been accounted for in
the, in the larger envelope. And
so I want to make sure that
we're, we're figuring that out
quickly.
Mr. Chair, Mr. Senna, um, as you
know, we are going.
Uh, to start our second phase of
the APG and we already have
started hearing gym space is not
big enough.
And I can guarantee when we
continue going out and doing the
round tables, that is going to
be a topic, and as I indicated
before, it is my understanding
that during the initial
roundtables.
The adequacy standards were not
addressed as far as the minimums
being raised because they had
the flexibility, um, as long as
it fit in the bucket.
If that's taken away, then that
is gonna be probably number.
Yeah
Thank you Mr. Chair. Um, I have
a few kind of technical
clarification questions first,
um,
So, on how the cutoff will work,
how many schools or how many
awards were provided before 2023
in which there's expenditures
that have been made.
Mm
We would have to get that
information for you. OK. Um, I
think so inherently I agree with
the 2023 cutoff as a base. I
mean, that makes sense. I guess
my question is if we have awards
that were provided in 2022, 2021
for design and engineering that
haven't really done the work yet
and designed yet, would they
have an opportunity to maybe
cancel their award and come and
reapply under the new gross
square footage calculator.
Because I think
There's a, there's a little bit
of a rub for me and thinking,
hey, if these projects haven't
been designed at all. And yes,
they, you know, they should have
come forward by now, but if they
haven't moved forward at all,
we're kind of keeping them stuck
in the past and in a way I
understand why.
They should be like, we want to
treat them a little bit
differently cause it's like,
hey, why didn't your project
move, but that might, I think
there's just a little bit of a
rub for me there. Like I think
we want to think through maybe a
little bit how we treat older
projects. I mean, this goes back
to policies and things that AMS
has been trying to discuss and
work with staff on, but you
know, what do we do with
projects that don't awards that
don't move, you know, can we
cancel those after 2 years and
require them to come back and
request again. And so I think
that's something that we should
consider for some of those
older.
Projects prior to 2023 to say,
hey, like they can come forward
under that old, um, you know,
standard.
an all girls square footage, but
they may want to come and just
reapply entirely. Um, that may
be a better path for them
because then they're, you know,
they're not being able to take
advantage of the new gross
square footage calculator, but,
and it allows us to also
re-evaluate a little bit more
readiness, you know, like, are
they truly ready for this? So I,
I know I'm kind of I'm opening
up a kind of a comment there,
but I think we need to kind of
think about how that cut off can
also be evaluated, um, looks
like you have a response.
Chair Director Leach.
There are approximately 10
projects prior to 2023, and they
arrange their several of these
that are 75.
75 to 100% designed. I have one
that's 25 to 50% designed. OK.
Another 50 to 75 so they're
mostly moving so that maybe
isn't as much of a factor,
there's a couple of one.
To
3
Gala projects that aren't,
haven't been moving, but that's
been a topic of conversation as
it pertains to gallop. So that's
kind of another topic, but these
projects
Are they being designed.
Yeah, I, and again, I, I, I
understand the concept of the
2023. I'm just a little bit
worried. I mean, we may have
districts that come back that
have a real reason as to why
they got delayed that was out of
their control or something like
that. I don't know. Um, and that
may be a further argument moving
forward.
Um, so that was my first kind of
clarific clarifying kind of
question. And then another
question on the waiver piece
under option number.
One
So if, if, uh, an award is
coming in for and it includes
additional uh square footage for
the gym, and they received a
waiver for the project overall.
Does them, if they increase
their gym space, do they just
not get a waiver on that
increase or do they not get a
waiver on the project at all any
longer.
Um, I we would have to probably
go into more detail as far as
what was discussed.
Initially, when the award was
granted.
Um, what we've seen in the past
is
The district could pay.
A portion, usually the full, the
full amount of their design
costs and then they'd come for
construction and we see the
waiver for construction.
Because, um, we indicated to
them that the council's not in
in.
Doesn't really like to give 100%
waiver without any teeth in the
game. So usually they would come
with their local portion.
So, um, I don't believe any of
these are 100% waiver at the
design phase. It's usually at
the construction phase that they
come for those waivers.
So then if they come at the
construction phase, would they
not be eligible for a waiver if
they increase the square footage
of their gym at all.
Mr. Chair, they would not. OK.
I, I'm a little uncomfortable
with that. Um, because I think
some of these districts we know,
I, I know we've seen analysis.
It's been a while. I mean, some
of these districts, their
bonding capacities like 1.5
million. I mean, they have very
little capacity to be supporting
a construction phase to begin
with. And so it sort of seems
unnecessarily punitive to me to
say, hey, if you're gonna
increase and you're still within
our new gross square footage
calculator, you're going to also
just not get the waiver. Like I
feel like if they're within
in this two-year period and when
things were shifting, I feel
like they should be able to
design up to the gross square
footage, even if it means
additional gym and gym or
community space as long as
they're not sacrificing academic
space like that makes sense to
me, but to then just say, hey,
you can't increase your gym
space at all.
Or you forego your a potential
waiver that you were expecting.
I, I, I'm a little more
concerned about that, and
especially I think a lot of
these districts that were the
waiver was part of a discussion
in the design phase or the
school districts that very have
very little capacity to meet the
local match requirement. There
are more impoverished districts.
There are smaller districts, you
know, um, so I do have a little
bit of a concern. I, I mean, I
think.
I like, um, I, I like the, um,
you know, policy number one, but
that piece on foregoing the
waiver for the construction
phase if they increase the gym
space at all, doesn't, I, I
don't know, but I don't know if
there's any further
clarification, uh, from other
folks, but that would concern
me, um, they still should be
eligible to sign up to the negro
square footage calculator if
they're in their design phase
from the last 2 years. I don't
know, I'm, I'm just don't think
I'm supportive of.
Going a construction waiver for
that. Um,
Um, so I just think it seems a
little unnecessarily punitive,
uh, but maybe with further
discussion, I, I may not be
thinking about that correctly.
Um, another, um,
The question I have, uh, a
technical question is, so it
says they can increase their gym
and or slash community space as
long as they don't impact their
academic space. So does that
mean, so say their academic
space was already um designed
the classroom size was already a
little bit higher than the
minimum. And say with this new
redesign or in uh increase in
gym space, say that academic
space does drop, but it doesn't,
it drops to the minimum, right?
It's not going below the
minimum.
Is that something that would be
rejected or do they have to not
have any change to their
academic.
That's what we've understood.
Yeah, because when the award was
first made, we weren't.
We didn't have that level of
detail, so it would be hard to
know. Oh, OK.
Uh, but if they
did have that level of detail
and they're coming back to, to
change it in the
You know
If they're under this policy for
the newer awards as long as
they're under the maximum they
and they.
are meeting the educational.
Needs then that would be
allowable. And just a point of
clarification for awards older
than 2023. It just simply is.
Because we didn't change the
space standards for gym space.
It just says if you want to go
above the old standard, then you
got to pay for it. OK.
And it doesn't preclude them
from coming and asking for
additional academic space under
the new calculator or asking
even for, you know, potential
waiver for that.
Thank you. That's, that's
helpful, Charles. I appreciate
that. Um,
OK, so just, so I just wanna
repeat it back to make sure I um
understand fully. So we haven't
for the most part seen the
details of these designs, so as
long as they're academic space
isn't dropping below the new
minimum, they can have, again,
they can as long as they're
fitting within the bucket and
their minimums are being met,
their gym space can be larger.
Right, OK, thank you. I mean we
had a example of a school that
came in and said, well, we don't
need as big of a cafeteria as
what we originally thought.
It's like, well, we don't want
to pay for something you don't
need.
Mhm
But we don't want to like, short
the cafeteria where a classroom
space, where everybody said they
needed more.
Mhm
And then so you can have a
You know, bigger locker rooms
for the football team or, you
know, concession stands, which
we've also been seeing those
types of things. Yeah, cause I
think it makes sense to me that,
you know, as long as they're
fitting within those minimums,
you know, for the various
different spaces. There's, I
think it's meant to build in
some flexibility, but we wanna
make sure that those academic
spaces are being, are meeting
their needs and hitting that
minimum. OK, if that's the case,
that makes me a little bit
better, um.
And then, um, let me see here.
I think I may have some
additional questions, Mr. Chair,
but I, I'm gonna let others, and
I might chime in again if that's
OK. OK.
That's good.
Thank you.
Um,
yeah, I, I was gonna ask about
the um
The traditional um eligible
space for the the academic
space.
But I think I understand that
they can come forward with
Uh, to increase their academic
space.
If they need to.
And that's, um, that's, and that
can go back previous to
223 also.
And that would be
Eligible for a waiver if they
just want to make sure I
understood that correctly. OK,
so the, the couple of things I,
I
I'm questioning.
I, I know that the next
temptation is going to be for
design firms to come back for an
increase because they're
redesigning a building.
And I, um,
I find that to be really
reprehensible. I, I don't think
that we could, we can support
that. And so the idea what
Please, you, you talked about
what uh phase of design people
were in, and if you're in design
review, I mean, you're already
there being, you know,
The, the design is really 8, 90%
complete, and you go back and
make a change.
The design firm is is
legitimately asking for.
An increased be because you're,
you're challenging them with a,
with a change at the last
minute. If the, if the, if we're
in the programming phase, well,
that's a whole different thing.
Um
Again, how does that relate to
the cutoff date of 23, um, where
we
And um
Were we in programming.
In 23, or what we already in?
full blown design.
So, so to me, that's, that's
kind of a ticklish area and, and
I certainly wouldn't support um
additional design fees for um,
or at least I wouldn't support
that, to, to redesign this. I
think the districts if they want
to do that, they have to pay
those additional design fees.
I'm uh uncomfortable with the
idea of um
of starting a new design.
After they've already been,
they're pretty far into their
design.
Um, I, I kind of think
There's some in-between places
and we've been afforded 22
options.
I think there's one.
I kind of think um that previous
to 23,
If a firm has not gotten to
Um.
If they haven't gotten from 23
to now, they haven't gotten past
conception of conceptual design.
They, they shouldn't.
I, I, I have a hard time
justifying.
them coming back and wanting to
redesign.
I feel like
There's, there's some leeway in
here between projects before 23
projects from 23 to now.
And projects, you know, the
obviously the ones coming in.
So projects
Right now
If they were, if they were in a
place where they can make the
design changes relatively
efficiently.
Then I can, I can see them.
Wanting to adjust to their.
The um.
If they were very far in their
design, and they had to go to a
redesigned um at uh changes.
Uh, I think that would be a
waste of money and time.
Uh
So I, I, I wonder, is there a
place?
Where we can
With projects between 23 and
now.
We can say, well,
OK, we understand there's been
some
We
Will split the cost of those
additional footage.
I, I just feel like there is
some, and, and that may be the
case from before but I think
there's, there's, there's
options that are in between the
two options that we have right
now.
Ash Ashley's question, uh, also.
Was very
I'm, I'm just gonna say I'm
I feel a little uncomfortable.
Making a final decision today.
And something that doesn't feel
completely vetted.
These two options.
So I, I, I guess I just want to
ask.
Do we really want to make that.
Emotion and pass emotion.
In this kind of emergency.
Methodology
Is it, is it warrant that?
That's what I wanted to,
good comments.
Somebody want to go again. I, I,
I wanna.
comments as well. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I just had a couple
technical questions, I think.
So, um, when did, and I'm sorry,
I should probably know this.
When determining the maximum
allowable square footage.
Are we taking individual
Uh, spaces into account and sort
of adding them all up together,
or is that a number that is
separate and determined by
population and other things, and
then we sort of backward map
into that number.
Individual spaces.
So, Mr. Chair members, uh, Mr.
Senna, um, what we do is we, the
growth of calculators determined
by the project, projected
enrollment.
So that enrollment number will
spit out the number for the, on
the gross calculator. So let's
say it's 50,000 square feet. So
within that 50,000 square feet,
we will evaluate that program,
and typically what they will do
is they will identify different
areas in the school, uh, whether
it's core academics, which are
your general classrooms, your K
through 6th grade, your um
history, social studies, math
classrooms, they'll identify a
special education. They'll
identify um your what we call
specialty classrooms. Those are
like your band.
rooms, of course, rooms,
elective rooms, um, shop rooms,
rooms that require special
equipment. They'll also identify
your physical education, your um
food service your administrative
spaces and then your spaces that
we call billing support. Those
are usually your server rooms,
your ja square closets.
So what we do is they will
quantify those spaces at a uh
and also assign your uh
The square footage for each
space. And that tolls the amount
that that pro of that program.
And so then we will look at that
amount, total amount, look to
see if it fits with, if it fits
within what the gross calculator
says.
If it does not, we'll identify
the space over that. The gross
square foot calculator. We'll
also look to see if those spaces
are eligible, meaning that they,
there's certain spaces within
the Alice Street planning guide
that, uh, are not eligible for
uh PSOSU funding. We'll make
sure that, that if the program
has those, we'll call those out
separately. So we do look at it
on a space by space basis per
area. I don't know if I answered
your question, but Mr. Chair,
thank you, John. I appreciate
that. So just to clarify, I just
want to make sure I understand
it correctly.
The, the gross square footage
allow maximum allowable square
footage is determined by the
number of students in a school.
You then do all the programming.
To make sure that whatever they
need.
fits within that.
On a hypothetical basis.
If I have this maximum, I square
footage and we program all the
educational space that's
necessary, according to the
minimums.
And there is leftover.
Traditionally we've allowed
school districts to do whatever
they want with that space.
And we've, I was, uh, uh, share
members, we've always allowed
that flexibility and that's uh
so if, if you've programmed
everything you need and your
program at least to the minimums
and your course spaces or
special ed spaces, um, and you
want to increase your gym size a
little bit that we've always
allowed that.
Um
And it's not all these gyms that
drive that over it, we're now,
especially now we're seeing a
lot of CT spaces that are
larger.
Um, there's sometimes there's
some, um, some media centers
that are larger as well.
Um, so it's not only gems, but
gems are typically they're
larger, they, they, and if we're
looking at the spaces are
getting us the growth, the new
growth calculator, they have a
big role to play in that. Yeah,
OK. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I
I'm, I'm struggling with the,
with the conversation a little
bit because I do think we're
making value judgments about
certain spaces now.
Um, and, and I don't know that I
have a suggestion for how to
clean it up today, but I, I do
think
That, that sort of misalignment
or or or gap between
However, we determine maximum
allowable square footage.
And the ability for a school to
program all its educational
needs and potentially still have
leftover.
Um, space to do other things.
And then try to dictate what
they do with that leftover
space. That's, I mean, obviously
that's the crux of the
conversation here. So I just,
I'm, I'm struggling with how we
end up with so much maximum
allowable square footage that
we're then having to
Get out the distinction and how
districts and schools are
spending or using that.
That additional space that's
outside of sort of the the core
academic.
Pieces and so I just wanted to
understand that relationship,
um.
And, and, and if I could just
ask the question again, I'm
sorry to repeat myself, and I
know you've mentioned there's
this whole process about APG and
and how we would go out and talk
to people who were already
hearing these spaces. How long
would that take? How, how
quickly can we do this?
Based on what we provided the
council, we indicated that we
can have a published a final
phase of the APG by May of 2026.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I, I
would, I guess, and, and again,
I'm one person, but I would ask
that as far as that gym space,
because it does seem to be the
sticking point for so many of
these projects.
Um, I would
I, I'll ask the chair if there's
a point soon where we could get
some more information about
Um, best practices, how we
calculate gym space now where
that 6500 number came from again
as an example, depending on the
size.
Um
Because I'm still struggling
with the constant reports, one
of
Bass that aren't adequate
according to what we're hearing
from school districts.
And this sort of um
Lack of clarity around where
that number comes from.
And then again, I don't want to
repeat it again, but just the
idea that traditionally it has
not been a sticking point as
much, because we've not
scrutinized plans to that level
of detail, as long as they've
met all the other requirements
and stayed below that maximum
allowable square footage. So I
would just ask Mr. Chair, that
if we could expedite this
particular piece of it. I don't
know that we want to go another
9 months.
Trying to, I mean, even if we
apply the standard policy.
Coming back on the back end and
realizing that we may be
underbuilt some spaces. And and
maybe that's that won't happen,
but we won't know.
Thank you, Mr. Chair, um, Mr.
Senna.
That's why we suggested option
number one.
So that we're not having to
scrutinize all of these spaces
as
In depth as long as it fit in
the bucket.
And that's what we call it. It's
within the allowable square
footage, whether it's um it's
meeting the minimum or above the
minimum of the gym spaces.
As long as it's not sacrificing
core academic spaces.
Mr. Chair, I appreciate that,
but, but then we'd also require
people to fully fund their local
share of the project Mr. Chair,
Mr. Senate, we're open to change
language today, um, these are a
couple of options for discussion
being that there was a
subcommittees, um, so we are
open to any changes that you may
wanna make. Um, also, as it
pertains to, uh, we don't want
to wait too long. Now I granted
we do need to do analysis and if
there's not enough information
to
Make a determination today. Just
keep in mind we have school
districts who are
Um, already upset that we've
tabled projects and if we wait
much longer, we're gonna
continue to table projects, and
I don't know what kind of impact
that's going to have.
Thank you.
Very good discussion.
I have some comments that I'd
like to make, um.
First of all, that I want, I
want to bring up two items that
We should all
Keep in mind, and that is
The first is that we had staff
on board.
Previously
That was encouraging this.
Activity. Worry about it.
We'll take care of later.
So
To locals and to engineers.
They heard that.
OK.
So that's why
We're in this, uh, the second is
that.
You know, we've already heard
complaints some of the
districts.
About
This. We've got 10 projects that
are
Uh, 22 and.
Older
We've got 20 projects.
There are 23 and newer, so
there's only
You know
Uh, there's 222 projects, 321
projects for 20 projects and
one.
19 projects.
There's also a maybe a.
Option
To for the older projects, not
give them the whole.
All of wax, but maybe do a
percentage.
A lower percentage to those.
Just so that
We don't leave them out
completely.
Because
If we
If we go study the gyms.
And come back and say, hey.
They need to be bigger than
these folks.
And they would have some.
Sour grapes about that, I'm
sure.
if they came back and felt
strongly enough to where they.
So
Where are we?
I, I really don't think that we
can take that long a time to
look at gems in particular.
Uh, you know, the 9 months or
whatever it was, we, we need to
do that quickly.
And if there was a way.
To do that quickly.
Maybe we wouldn't have to make a
decision today.
I don't know, but, you know, the
longer we wait.
The more upset and the more it's
costing districts.
And us
Uh with inflation, so.
You know, the first option.
Might be the way to stave off.
Some of the this put off some of
the decision making.
I, you know, I agree.
That
Uh, it's gonna cost more and
these projects should have been.
Online a long time ago.
But
There's only 10 of them compared
to 20.
Of
The ones we're going to be
paying for.
Anyway,
So it's not certain that all of
these 10 are gonna, that is
correct.
And we're not certain how many
of the 2 are gonna come back.
Well, maybe we
We admit that the conditions
were such that
We need to go back and pick
these up.
And have peace. Mr. Chair.
Regarding option number one.
We can come up with
Uh, different language for
The adjustment criteria of
bullet point number 3, that is
the sticking point.
And we can change the language
to indicate something else that
they are.
loud.
To request a waiver.
Or however, this council sees it
too.
Ensure that these move forward.
I also
Don't like the option or the.
Potential for districts to say.
As you mentioned,
Let's, let's just drop this
agreement and we'll start all
over again so that we can get
the size of.
You know, square, I mean, that's
gonna delay.
Projects for those students.
It's gonna end up costing more
in the end anyway.
But
Mr. Chairman,
If I were a school district and
I efficiently built a school.
From a 22 award within standards
at the time.
I mean, if we change the stand,
we changed the space standards,
and there's got to be a cutoff
at some point in time.
And
They built their gym, according
to what they could fit in the
calculator, and here's somebody.
Else has been sitting on an
award.
And gets a windfall of extra
space that's not tied up into
academics.
That seems unfair to
To me, for the, the people who
actually got the job done.
Uh, wouldn't have that
opportunity. I think the October
1st kind of deadline for saying
like,
You were previously awarded were
cutting it off at that point,
kind of gets to some of your
concerns about going back and
trying to do a re-engineer or
redesign.
So it's sort of like
You, you'd have to have your
ducks in a row.
Pretty deep.
And we're about to come back,
you know, to the council.
Ask for these changes.
Otherwise, we're just inviting.
The very thing that you're
concerned about.
And then for John's point for
those recent awards.
So they got a windfall of space
that they may or may not have to
apply to, and we're not dabbling
in the value of those spaces.
It's just where we've
consistently been seeing this
gym issue.
Come up.
For these really old projects,
you know.
It's like, if that's what you
want to do, then you pay for it,
for that space above the
minimum.
And
You know, then we got to figure
out on a go forward basis.
Whether we want is a calculator
big enough to let him play
within the square footage and,
and then we'll have to see what
kind of projects are coming
forward.
Or do we need to make a change
in the, in the minimum for gym
space or not. This is like all
the talk out on the street is
everybody wanting bigger, these
are things to consider.
Uh, yes, go ahead.
So, um,
I think, you know, I feel that
these 23, 24 projects, you know,
should be able to be, I think
they all should be adjusted,
like be able to be adjusted, but
as the policy states, if they're
older projects, they're, um, you
know, they'll have to do it with
their own funny. Like I, I
don't, I don't think that's a
perfect solution, to be honest,
but it's a solution that makes
sense to me right now. Yeah, um,
yeah, just for the gym. So I
think, but for me.
One of the things I would say,
um,
And I know you're, you may not
be ready to take a motion, but
You know, for me, I think option
policy number one makes sense,
but I would recommend for me, I
would move that we adjust that
waiver piece because I feel like
that is dipping our toe into
making a judgment on the very
specific spaces. I don't believe
that. I know that the gym space
and you were talking about them
coming in for larger concession
stands and things like that, but
I don't think that.
Plays into the gross square foot
calculator anyway.
Yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure. OK,
it is indicated in the APG but
either way, I think maybe what
you're saying, Charles, is that
that sort of indicating that
they're, it's more of like a
sports athletic situation versus
academic, right?
So for me, I'm I'm uncomfortable
with, you know, a uh having them
potentially forego the late, the
waiver, um, you know, we changed
the rules, right? We changed the
game kind of in the middle of
their key process, especially if
they are on time with their
design and planning in that two
year period. I don't wanna kind
of penalize them and and not
allow them to have this.
You know, um, simply because it
would forego their waiver. Um,
that, that, that makes me a
little bit uncomfortable, but I
think the the first policy that
would be what I would recommend
or what I would move for, um.
You know, Mr. Chair, if you're,
if you're willing to take
motions, but
I think the first option makes
sense, but I to John's point.
And uh just, you know, I have
reached out to staff to do a
special meeting on training and
maybe we can bring this gym
discussion back as part of that
process. I don't know, Mr. Chu
we think about that, but because
we were planning on doing kind
of a training and to kind of
dive into the adequacy standards
and, and the APG a little bit
more as staff kind of initiate
this longer APG update process
and maybe we can have that gym
conversation at the front end of
that, um, and help that inform
that process as they go out for
their round tables as well. Um.
So
That's my, oh, and um there was
something else I wanted to
mention, um, if you.
Don't mind to respond to
Director Leach.
You would
Make a motion if we took out
that 2nd.
sentence
And bullet point number 3.
Thank you.
To to clarify, it would just
say, um, the district, so we
would strike the district has to
certify that their financial
position provides for them to
pay their local match without
the need for a local.
Just to clarify.
So, Mr. Chair, it's on the 2nd
page of the policy number one
option.
Uh, it's the very last, uh, dark
bullet before the exhibits, but
then it's the first subbullet of
that. So where it begins the
difference between the two
policies. Oh, I'm sorry.
I apologize. Uh, it's actually
in policy number 1, 2nd page,
3rd bullet under adjustment
criteria.
We would remove to be eligible
for this consideration, the
district must certify its
ability to fully fund its local
share of the project costs.
So this says associated with the
expanded scope. So that's what I
was trying to get clarification
on, so. Yeah, so it they
wouldn't be getting rid of their
entire waiver. It would just be
a waiver on the expanded gym
scope or the expanded scope
overall for the new gross square
footage. And that I think that
needs to be clarified.
I still feel like they should be
able to have that flexibility if
that's how we've been treating
these projects within the gross
square footage calculator. I
think if they get a waiver, they
get a waiver for allowing them
to increase the gross square
footage and basically treat
their award as if it's under
this new gross square footage
calculator, I think we was that
emotion.
Uh, yes, Mr. Tarrant
folks can feel free to agree or
disagree, but yeah, my motion
would be uh to uh approve uh
policy number one, with the
amendment that the language
under adjustment criteria
stating to be eligible for this
consideration, the district must
certify its ability to fund its
local share of the project costs
associated with the expanded
scope be struck.
Is there a second
OK.
Thank you, Martin. All right,
further discussion.
Yeah, just for clarification.
Um
Oh
Uh
Is there room for
Um
Modification to this.
Uh
Standard that we're gonna be
setting down today.
Is there, is there room to be
more evaluation done on that or
we can be a moving target.
As long as that's clear, as long
as that's clear that this is not
to live with forever.
Mr. Chair and members, and keep
in mind this policy doesn't take
away the fact that we still have
to review all of the requests.
So these requests will still be
going to award subcommittee to
review to ensure that their
Um, following this policy and
also for us to know whether
Um
What they're asking for it's
within the allowable. So we're
still doing analysis on it.
And keep in mind, Mr. Ingham,
that this
gives the district, the
flexibility that they're.
And, and I, I understand that,
and I, I agree with that.
I just
I, I'm always looking at what
if.
And if we
Approve this
And then somebody comes back
with a really
What I would say out of line
request.
Um, and then is able to justify
it by what we're moving to. I, I
just am anxious that I, I, that
we have not.
been able to
Really look at the, but I would
agree as long as we can review
it later.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh.
I just want to, 11 last time.
Say what I understand this to
be.
Just so that everybody
understands it and then add a
couple of things. So essentially
what we're saying here is any
project.
That has been approved, even
those included, even those prior
to 2023 can come back and ask to
be aligned.
With the, with the maximum,
that's what the policy says
currently, right? I mean, that's
what we're voting on.
Any project could come forward,
including those.
Prior to 2023.
And as long as they stay within
the maximum allowable square
footage.
We would, we would, we would
consider them, right?
Mr. Chair, Mr. Senator, that's
correct, Mr. Chair, I, I think I
need to clarify, so I think I'm
creating confusion.
So what I'm trying to do, and
maybe that I think I, what I'm
proposing is not what I'm trying
to do. So thanks, John. Thank
you. So what I'm trying to say
is for projects that come
forward.
So let me think about it. So
projects from 2023 and 2024 can
like any project can come
forward and request an increase
in the gross square footage.
Projects from 23 to 24 can come
and and request that increase.
And um and they can still
receive a waiver. Everything's
the fine, even if they increase
their gym space as long as
they're not reducing their
academic spaces below the
minimum.
That's also OK.
What we're seeing here is the 23
and then the 23 projects can
come forward.
And they can request that as
well, um.
But if their request includes
gym space, the increase in the
gym will have to, um,
Uh, they'll have to meet the
match in the gym increased.
So
I would like, I, I feel like I
need to amend my motion cause I
think I was getting confused and
trying to read the text. I
believe that I, I'm OK, I'm
comfortable with policy number
one, I believe.
Like if it's pre 23, I, what I
will say is I still feel like
we're kind of um
Uh, making a moral judgment on
gym space, which I'm a little
uncomfortable with.
To me, I, I, I, you know, if it
fits within the maximum gross
square footage calculator, and
they're not sacrificing academic
space. I feel like that's
consistent with how we've
treated it in the past.
But I recognize that we want to
have a conversation around those
projects that are stalled, I'm.
I'm not
Totally sure that this is the
way to approach the conversation
around the projects being
stalled to me, we should be
canceling awards and requiring
them to come back and, and
reapply because um they're not
moving and then in that
reapplication process, we
consider the, the readiness of
the district to actually spend
the funds. To me, that's a
better approach to that. Um, but
I, I, I can see this as being
kind of a concession to say,
hey, those projects from 2023,
you can come back, but this gym
square footage is gonna have to
be on your own time.
I think I can get comfortable
with that, um.
That being said, and thank you
guys for your patience as I wrap
my head around this, um.
Uh
I think I would like to amend my
motion to just move approval.
If I may.
Did that clarify for you, John,
before I do that?
It did, and I, and I, that's the
way I understood that your
emotion to begin with. I just
want to clarify now
for, for policy number one
without the amendment, as it as
it is.
Um
I'm going to get these numbers
wrong, I'm sure, but it just as
an example, under the previous
adequacy planning guide.
Uh, or maximum allowable square
footage as an example, the
school district might have
gotten 55,000 square feet.
Under the new
Adequacy standards.
A rough estimate
Could I get a rough estimate as
to what they might get.
Now
With the new ones. So for high
schools, it was about 5%.
Or middle school 7%.
And
Uh, elementary schools 10%.
So, Mr. Chair, uh, just to
clarify that.
If they were to come back and
ask for those additional, that
additional space.
They would have to cover that
extra 10% cost, regardless of
where that space was added,
right? Because that's what this
says, that this would be
associated with the expanded
scope. That's all square
footage.
Mr. Chair, that is what this
says.
Again, we can modify it to
include just the excess in gym
space.
That they would only have to pay
for the excess above the
allowable whatever amount of
minimum allowable gym space.
Yeah.
Or we can go back to Miss
Leach's amendment and just take
it out and all of them would be
eligible by October 1st. And I
see what you're trying to do
here director Soly as far as um
Why aren't these moving?
And
I agree 100%.
The problem is PSFA has not held
a gun to anybody's head to
ensure that they
Completed a project within a
specific amount of time.
And if that's what we want to
ensure moving forward.
We can do that.
But as I indicated in our
conversations, these aren't the
projects to do it with.
I think what needs to happen is
we need to start setting these.
Potential policies.
Um, or revisit the MOUs and see
whether there's teeth in holding
these people, these districts
accountable to their timelines.
is with the new projects, fiscal
year 26 pro I, I really just
have heartburn in
trying to do that with projects
that have been
Underway for a few years,
granted, yes, maybe way too
long, but again, there nobody's
really been holding them
accountable for how long they
need to be done.
I, I appreciate that, Mr. Chair,
and, and.
You know, I would just say a
couple of things. One is to
Ashley's point about making
value judgments about particular
spaces and, and, and I
completely agree, as I said
before, we don't need a pit in
every school, right? We don't
and even in every high school.
Um, but it's these kinds of
spaces that we've traditionally
not paid for.
Jim's larger gyms.
Performing arts spaces.
CTE spaces to some extent.
You know, given the larger
education conversation that
we're having right now.
These are the things that we
know engage kids in school.
They're the things that keep
that keep kids coming to school
for a lot of these communities,
even though I agree that they
should not be primarily a
community space. They are a
gathering space for communities,
especially when there's a lack
of other infrastructure in the
community. It's the identity of
those communities and so for us
to make value judgments about
what spaces are important,
especially if they're following
all the rules.
Um, it's really difficult for
me. On the other hand,
The idea that if we're, if we
don't hurry with this, either we
built, we underbuild spaces on
one hand, where we spend a lot
of money.
Letting folks build whatever
they want.
And so I would hope that that
would actually be the urgency.
In the process.
And as an example, and I don't
expect that you will all do
this, I know you have like
actual jobs to do it on a daily
basis.
You know, the, the
Public education department.
Um, and other folks are, are
building a plan to address the
Martinez Yazi lawsuit currently.
That filing or that motion came
down from the court.
Like April, early May.
That plan is due in November.
In the month of August, they're
going to have
12 plus public convenings across
the state.
In like 2 weeks.
And I'm not saying we have to
have that level of urgency
around this particular topic,
but it is, it is a it is a, I
think an important
Place where
School districts need to have
usable spaces, we need to be
responsible.
With money, this.
The issue has not been
addressed.
And we've sort of left it to
people's own devices. And we've
set all kinds of precedents and
somewhat contradicting
precedents, I think if we really
look at it.
So I, I'm
I'm in favor of um
Allowing people to come forward.
Within the maximum allowable
square footage as long as they
are not.
Going below minimums for
educational spaces or
sacrificing the other kinds of
things that we know students
need in a school, even if it
means that they get a slightly
bigger gym that may be underused
to some extent.
And, and if we're not OK with
that, then I think we need to
hurry it up.
In figuring out what the right
number is.
Um
Rather than build something that
just does not fit the needs of
the community or the school in
that in that moment.
Mr terrify me. I think I really
appreciate your comments, John,
because I think that's.
That's what I'm feeling, right?
And I, you know, I don't wanna
just open it all up to every
project that's outstanding, you
know, it's frustrating that
these projects prior to 2023
didn't come forward.
But I'm also
I think Iris, you really hit the
nail on the head. We haven't
done the job, our job, and I put
this on AMS, although I commend
us for trying to skip these
conversations started right now,
but we haven't done our job on
holding those district districts
accountable that aren't moving
their projects forward.
And to do it in this policy
that's.
Addressing this very narrow, you
know, kind of issue that we're
facing right now. I'm not sure
that's the best place to address
that. And I don't know if this
policy is the best place to
address the gym question as
well, because it's so narrow and
focused. Those, those two issues
to me are broader.
Programmatic issues that we as a
council, you know, need to
address. And I think this policy
to me now that we're discussing
it further needs to maybe just
be focused on how this impacted
outstanding awards.
That
We provided and then we changed,
we moved the, we moved the
finish line, right? We moved the
design line.
Uh, for them, and now they're
seeing an opportunity, and if I
were a school district, and I'm
not saying all of them would do
this, but if I'm in a school
district, I'm like, hey, well,
we designed to what you said we
needed to before, and now you're
saying we need more, but you're
not letting me design to it now.
I don't, I don't know if that's
a a good place that we want to
be.
And again, I, I, I'm very
frustrated with certain school
districts that are have a lot of
awards that are not moving. But
I think there's maybe a
different place or a different
avenue for us to address that
outside of this policy.
Mr. Chair, last comment, I
promise.
I think the guardrail,
the guardrail on this is the
deadlines for application,
regardless of how many projects
are outstanding to, to your
point, uh, Charles, that they
would have to have their ducks
in a row and be able to bring
those, those forward very
quickly.
Um, I, I do worry about a rush.
Of folks who just
And then we're stuck, you know,
sort of retroactively looking at
projects, but I do think that
the
that the deadlines help us to
narrow the number of uh
Decrease the number of proposals
that will actually see and it
won't get to that worst case
scenario, I hope.
So with that Mr. Chair, I think
I want to keep my original
motion.
That would strike that.
Requirement that they
Have to fund the increase in the
scope if they, so I, I think
that was my original motion and
I would like to retain that if
Martin is still willing to keep
his. Yes.
Um,
the whole reason why we have
more space.
In the calculator.
It's because of traditional
academic space.
So
I don't know the policy option 2
is trying to
Well, from staff's perspective,
it's trying to undo the local
control aspect of you, you can
fit it under the total, do
whatever you want, as long as
you meet some of these minimums.
And
The problem I have with that is
that all the new increases had
nothing to do with the gym
space.
It had to do with larger
classrooms.
CTE special education.
Those types of things.
The second heartburn I've got.
Is that
So larger square footage.
We've had a, like local, you
figure it out within these
minimums.
And at the same time, the state
is like paying 100% of the cost
and not getting like
Sort of in my view, enough of a
say.
In certain aspects of, you know,
a project.
And we visited one of those
micros schools with LFC uh
earlier this spring, frankly,
I'm shocked at what we did
before.
The sum of the space.
It was like, yikes.
This is like for a handful of
kids.
So that's, that's the only
reason why brought forth policy
option too, it's like, nothing
changed in this new system, but
then you're giving
I'll call it a windfall of extra
square footage.
A lot of people who
Didn't get their project built
as opposed to their peers who
did under the old standard.
We both regular classroom space.
Now they're getting rewarded.
And if they want to do it.
You know, I still think they
should.
Pay for it if they can.
And it wouldn't preclude us from
still approving all of the
increased academic space because
we did.
Move, move the goal line, but
there's a motion on the, on the
floor, Mr. Chairman.
There's an awful lot of.
Pros and cons, um.
Feel that I'm not settled.
We have a, I'm not, I'm not
settled. It feels like it's not,
it's not completely developed to
me.
And so I, I guess my.
I probably won't support it just
because I
Of
I like really.
clear.
for everybody.
So, that's fine.
All right, Mr. Sherman, uh, to
be clear,
not
And then
Well, the, the waiver.
provision separating the two, I
think.
So, you know, we could also try.
This way first.
The amendment
So let's do it that way.
And uh
All those in favor of thee.
And all those uh.
Against the motion.
Thank you all. This is a tough
one, but I think again what
saves us, I think what John
indicated is that they'll still
have to come, we're able to take
the high road on.
Mr. Chair, I, I, I do want to be
clear, we didn't do a voice, a
voice voice I explain my vote a
little bit.
Um
I think what Ashley said is
really important. One,
How looking at other policies
that will hold districts
accountable for moving projects
forward is going to be really
important because that's really
dealing with the heart of 23 or
not 23.
And um
And the other piece I think, um,
and I don't think anybody meant
this in a flippantly.
But I, I do.
Worry that some of the changes
that we're approving on the
council, namely the adequacy
standards, and how that was
going to impact projects was not
maybe fleshed out or discussed
as much as we should have.
Um, because that's also at the
heart of this.
I, you know, we
Not to mention the fact that as
a council, we've also approved.
Projects
In the way that we just allowed
ourselves to approve projects.
And so we've already set a
precedent in some cases.
for going up to that maximum
allowable square footage without
scrutinizing the the usage of
space.
And so part of my part of the
reason for voting yes on this.
Is that I don't think we should
punish school districts.
For our lack of diligence or
consistency, and so the close,
the sooner we can get to that
clarity and consistency across
the board.
I think the, the fewer instances
where we're gonna have to be put
in in in the place of making
value judgments about space.
I just wanted to say that that
I'm, I'm also a little bit on
the fence, but I also voted yes
for those reasons.
Good and uh
I guess indicated that you would
like a roll call vote for the
record, so we could go back and
do that.
No.
Yeah
You
You're voting against Mr.
Chairman, procedurally, um,
I mean,
I can get clarification.
Um, why, so I'm on the fence and
the part where.
Like
Projects prior to 23, why we
went cause I think it says, you
know, they would be um.
The district would have to pay
the full local share.
Why wouldn't we like what's your
luck?
Because I feel like if.
They are, you know, older
projects.
And why would we fund the
additional.
That's
Mr. Cha, my man, I invite John
and Iris to kind of mention.
So there, you know, there is,
there's strong, I think, issues
with these projects being old
and not having moved quickly.
I think my point was, um, and I
think Iris made it very well.
I, you know, or added to it was
that.
Um
You know, we as a council
haven't had a policy in place to
hold those districts
accountable.
And we haven't pushed personally
those districts and held them
accountable.
And I think that is a larger
concern so we can apply it
within this policy, but to me.
It's that this is really
narrower.
Policy topic.
Additionally, I think this wades
a little bit into sort of making
a value judgment on gym space
and gym space size, when that is
also a larger conversation topic
related to APG.
And whether we as a counselor
comfortable with larger gym
spaces or or different layouts
of gym spaces or things like
that. So I just feel like those
two things that change in the
gross square footage calculator.
It makes more sense that we stay
consistent to me in how we've
treated the gross square footage
calculator is that in that you
can design up to a certain
amount and as long as you're
meeting your academic needs. You
have cases that are utilized.
Um, and even though I'm very
frustrated with projects prior
to 2023 that aren't moving. I
just don't want to address that.
I think we need to start very
soon saying you can't move, you
know, if you have old projects,
maybe we rescind your awards or
we start there's some other
level of holding them.
Sure.
Correct.
Mr. Chair, Mr. Parti.
We agree 100% that they need to
be held accountable, but because
they haven't in the past, why
should these particular ones who
are already so far along in the
process, suffer the consequences
instead of waiting till we set a
policy.
Basically you're 26, moving
forward.
Because we do it backwards, we
don't know what kind of pot
we're stirring.
Um, for districts to come.
Later for something different
and we're trying to protect the
agency and protect the state as
well.
Uh, we're gonna try.
The motion again
With
Option one
Um.
Or unless there's
reconsideration.
It makes sense to me.
Or better sense
to reconsider our previous
second.
And all those in favor to vote
on re.
And all those opposed.
Oh
So we will go to again a roll
call vote on reconsiderates its.
Yeah, that.
OK, right. Actually, yes.
you know?
No
Martin Romero.
No
Great, great discussion of, you
know, we're not all there, but I
think.
We did make some progress.
Yeah
Make this work or make any
adjustments that are necessary
because I, I, I think we all
want to start working on some of
this stuff pretty quickly, um,
keep the train rolling with some
of the discussion on uh project,
you know, or uh project timeline
policy that AMS has started and
loop in some of the gym
conversation, and I know with
the transition in leadership, is
there someone at the the uh PSFA
right now, Iris, that we should
be kind of maybe working with
who's leading that charge. I
mean, it could be used still,
but I just want to get.
that clarification. I know I
reached out to have like a
special meeting on training, but
maybe I'd like to work with uh
maybe some of the folks from
awards to sort of help draft
that agenda and so there's
someone at the um authority that
we should be working with
specifically, if you wouldn't
mind letting us know who that
might be, Mr. Chair, Director
Leach, you'll be working with me
right now. I will loop in my
executive team, which is Larry
and Sean Murray, um, and we'll
work on it together until that
transition out. OK, sounds
great. Thank you.
Thank you.
And uh yeah
I think I suggest that we
All right.
Unless there's any other
business to come before us, our
next meeting is.
August 27th.
27 days away. Mr. Chair,
members, um, you will have a
handful.
Of some of these projects.
Um, requesting that alignment.
I'll entertain a motion to
adjourn.
So
Unanimous motion too
we didn't have a second
there were no, there were no uh
none in the negative, so we're
stand adjourned. Thank you.
Thank you, Charles. I appreciate
your work on this, Mr. Chairman.
