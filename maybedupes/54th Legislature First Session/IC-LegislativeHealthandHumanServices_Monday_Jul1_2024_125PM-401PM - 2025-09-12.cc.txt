We are ready to get
started. Are we online?
Everything's
our vast radio audience
out there is
prepared,
radio and TV audience
out there.
So we have this
afternoon uh
several panels and,
and we're gonna start with the
regulation and licensing
department and the new
superintendent of RL D
Clay Bailey. Thank
you for coming. Yes,
sir.
>> So Mr Chairman, members
of the committee, thank you for the opportunity
to come before you and
present uh introduce myself a
little bit. Some of, you know, me more from the
construction site.
I've been with the state for going
on 22. A little over
22 years started
with construction, moved up
with superintendent Trujillo and became
her deputy superintendent.
And then during the last session, I
was uh the governor
put me in place as superintendent.
So I'm heavy on the construction side.
I'm still learning stuff
every day. Uh We
do a lot of different things. I'm finding
out that uh RLD
is unique as we touch a lot
of folks all the way from
construction to, to the
boards and tattoo to cannabis
to alcohol. I mean, you name
it, we do it and
uh really proud to be able to do that. But
like I said, we're all still on a learning
curve. I have with me today,
uh the Director of Boards and
Commission Commission,
Melissa Salazar
and also I have my executive
assistant, uh Quinney Otero in
the back and I did bring C
CD director
uh Todd uh Stevens
periodically we get cannabis
questions quite a bit. So he's,
he's with us today.
Um
I think everybody probably knows I'll
go over a little bit of a jest and keep
it mostly the boards, but we
regulate and uh
service more than
450,000
individuals through all
of RL D
uh from
certifications to licenses
to qualifying parties.
Uh a little bit of everything.
Uh The division consists
of, uh or the department
consist of seven
divisions
>> just, just wanted to
mention we have a handout from
him too. So
it,
>> yes, sir.
And, and I, I do generally
talk fairly quickly. So
if you need me to slow down I
can. But uh
we, the department consists
of seven divisions. Uh
We've got the alcohol,
beverage control, we got the boards
and commission, we got
cannabis control, we got
construction industries,
financial institutes,
manufactured housing and
securities. So as I indicated
earlier, there's not too many
folks in the state of New Mexico that
we don't touch in somehow
some way or some matter
on the board side, we have
uh boards and commission. That's what I'm gonna
primarily talk to you about today
is we have 29
boards
which consist of
17 in the health
area and, uh,
12 in the professional
area. Uh,
total. With the
health, we have over 60,000
licenses and
on the professional, we have
47,000
thereabouts, you know,
close to that. So
they make up at least
1/4 of all
our licensees that we do
handle within
the boards and commission. We've done
this with the C CD. We're doing
it with alcohol. Mh
D and C ID has been on it,
but B CD boards
was the first division to
totally implement the new Mexico.
Plus, it's our new
licensing platform.
Uh We're really proud of it. We've
had some bumps and bruises along
the way, but it's
streamlining license
procedures. It's allowing
us to really follow closely
anybody that's needing
license. I think
we're down to an average of
eight days straight across.
Most of them are within three days.
Defines, depends on the criteria
that a license is to require.
Some of them are a little more in depth than
others. But uh
I think we've, for the average, we've
got it down to within eight days.
Uh One of the things we really
enjoy and I like about it is
you can no longer can
we get the paper application would come
in? We'd be missing something.
We'd send it back, take 30
days to get it around. We'd lose it
on a desk or something would
happen. Now if an
application is not complete,
um, it doesn't move forward,
it doesn't allow a constituent
to move forward, an applicant to move
forward. That's the same with, uh
C CD. And I'm assuming alcohols
is going in the same way,
uh, with the C ID, I still
have a little bit of a challenge with that,
but it does
require you to have a complete
application. The
renewals on it are instant,
the minute you go online and you
get it, you got an instant renewal.
You know, it, it's not going through the paper
process waiting for a bunch of hands to
handle it and their
certificates are immediately
available. I mean, you can still
call us, we can still help you with a
paper copy and I think we do send
paper copies out,
but you can have a copy
immediately after you renew,
which that's been a big plus
because a lot of these folks needed to
prove uh to their suppliers
or whoever else that's needing the
license.
It. Uh The, the
one really another
really good thing about the NM
plus, it allowed us to
get consistent across the
boards. Uh Like I said,
with 29 of them,
every board had a
different administrator it seemed
like. And uh Melissa's,
the director of Salazar has been a
huge part but
uh getting them more streamlined.
So the boards are more
equal or more uh
just more like,
than they are where you've been
training where individuals
from each board can't
just handle one board, they can cross
back and forth. We haven't
totally got that implemented all the way,
but we've got a lot of it completed
to where, you know, several
people can do one job as opposed
to used to. We'd have one person, they were
out, I ran into that on the P
I license. Right. Have an
individual out for
sick or whatever and it take a while to
get it done. So I was really happy with
that. It's a digital
platform which it's making
it really convenient
for most folks. There's still some
folks that don't appreciate
digital. And uh again, I
run into that more in C ID.
People still have some flip phones.
If that's the case, we still
will help them out if they come
in or they can set an appointment
and come in and be helped immediately.
It's streamlined, the expedited
licensing processes. Uh
We can check their credentials
from state to state. It goes a lot
quicker when we get them in, get them
over here and get them licensed
on the risk-based
approach. Um
And, and one thing, and director
Salazar can answer some of these questions
more in depth. But for
instance, if you needed a, a
college, uh you
have to have a college degree with also
requiring a high school diploma too.
Well, obviously you have your high school
diploma So we're not requiring
you to go find that and bring that back
up. We're trying to, to streamline
it, make it more user-friendly
and get these things turned around a
lot, a lot, uh
quicker. I
already talked about the incomplete
applications of print, transparency
and communication uh on
the C ID side and I'll talk to that a
little bit. The thing I've enjoyed
most about these systems
is well, that they're quick, they're
efficient, but also I
can go back and find out
when, when you all get the calls.
Right. We haven't got a license. Why are
you waiting it? What's holding it up? It's been three
weeks. I can actually go
back now and find out is it
on us? You do we need
to help the applicant to help them out
or do I have a problem internally?
And I can be honest, I've found some problems
internally that we've had to
work on and, uh, make it
better. So we don't do
it again. And so it's
helped both ways. There's some,
there's some ownership to it that helps
us in accountability. That's, I
really appreciate a lot.
Uh, it's allowed us to eliminate
some fees that we used
to charge for. For instance, you can
go on and get your certificate
a year from now. If it's a three year
license, if you need it, you can go online
and get yourself, you don't have to wait for us to
print it. Charge you for doing the work
and printing it like that. Uh,
complaints are now accepted
online. Um,
we get a fair amount of them
and uh, it makes it quicker, more
efficient. Uh We're
also doing that with some of the other
divisions and the other
uh, uh departments
that we're doing a lot of stuff
online boards
and, and director Salazar
has been big on this. Huh?
We have had three
constituent days this
year which allows consti
constituents to either
set an appointment and you know, you're going to be
there at eight o'clock, 830 or
whatever, meet with the different boards,
help them through their licensing process,
handle some of their complaints.
Uh She's had three of them this year.
We had one just
uh last week
and I think I walked down there and it was
pretty much packed with people. We had
55 that came in and asked
for some assistance. They get
their licenses done right there.
Like I said earlier, some folks don't
like the digital era
and they, they want to still do it in
person. And it also allows
people to come in if they've got a complaint
to come in and sit down, face to face
and explain why we're
not moving forward with the complaint or
how can we better help or bring some more
material in to help us with
it. Uh
They did host one of the
constituent aides at the University
of Me. New Mexico.
Uh B CD is also
collaborating with the Human Services
Department, verifying
license during enrollment in a three
year re enrollment intervals.
Uh Director Salazar has
worked really, really hard with this. I
don't know how she
handles everything with me
because I'm not the easiest, but she
also helps over at the governor's
office too. So that's
where y'all mostly know we're probably
from. So she's been an amazing
uh She is the one person
that I know with my staff
that works Saturday and Sunday
because we communicate a lot
during Saturday and Sunday at night.
So I really appreciate that.
We're also ready to
collaborate with the new Mexico Behavioral
Health Provider and, and
represented a little on the, hm
12 that
went through the memorial. Uh
I don't know if they've had the meeting yet,
but uh we're ready to go
and, and more than happy
to set in and be part of that and
see if we can figure out how to even
further expiate
the health care licenses that
are under us. Uh
As for future
legislation ideas, everybody
is well aware of the process for
at least the superintendent secretaries, how
we have to go through it. So we're
starting to present stuff to the
governor's office. What we'd like to see
one thing that uh director
Salazar has spoken to
a lot of the statutes for some
of these boards and commissions need to be
cleaned up. We're gonna look
at them and uh maybe
present some of that and see how many
we can get there. Uh The
bigger ones obviously like barbers
and cosmos, uh some
of that, some of the other legislative
stuff and this is going
on and going to keep going on for a period
of time. We're going to try
to, you know, push some cannabis
stuff, but we need to do some of
that and then like cranes and a few
other smaller things
that we have on the table
that we're looking toward.
Uh, we do have, I think three
boards up for
sunset this year, one of them is
barbers and cosmetology.
Uh the uh
nurse, landscape
architect and I think the nurse and
administrative. So
that'll be coming for
and, and with that, I, I stand
for questions, I'll answer
everything I can. If not, we'll plug
Melissa in and see what
uh she can help, help me
out with. But
thank you.
>> Great. That was a, a
good presentation.
And um I
wanted to ask you about,
we had,
um,
we had put in a bill, it
didn't get a message. So it didn't,
it never got out of
the um
committee on committees in the
Senate. It was
Senate Bill
44 last
year. Um
And it was, it was our attempt
at incorporating
some ideas that
the previous superintendent,
uh who will be in the
Senate uh in
January had
brought to us. It was Senate
Bill 44
and
it,
it incorporated some of the ideas
that she had brought to us that she thought
might be helpful. And one of
them was, uh, they're
all in that Senate bill 44.
And, and when it didn't get a
message from the governor, I
figured it didn't have the
department's
sense of urgency behind
it. But if you could take a look
at that and see if, if those
are some things, one
of them was compensating
members of health care
professional licensing
boards when they have
to travel to meetings
and so on that,
that the compensation
would make it more
feasible for them to
actually participate.
Uh a temporary
waiver of the application
life and renewal
fees. And I noticed you're doing
some of that administratively.
Do we need to change
the, the statute
to waive that I think
the, the way
she had proposed it was the
first year, there
would be no fee but for renewals,
there might be a fee. I think that was
the way it was
and that's it renewal
fees for new applicants and
newly licensed
healthcare professionals
in certain health care
professions, the
poorly paid ones.
Uh So those
are some of the things in that in
that last year. I think
those covered all the everything
else she had proposed was in
cannabis and we had a
separate bill in cannabis.
So that was.
>> Yes, sir. So Mr Chairman, absolutely,
I'll take, I'll pull that up, take a
look at it. Uh When
Superintendent Trio
left in October,
she handed me the cannabis package
off and uh I
was walking into my first
real session, uh,
swinging alone and I'll tell you
that 30 day, I'm 30
day was trying enough.
I can't wait for the 61.
But, but I will absolutely
look at it. Uh, obviously, you
know, she'd been in that, she'd been in boards
a long time. She had a lot of
good ideas. So she
didn't go over that one with me, but she did
go over the cannabis and some of the other
things. So. Absolutely, I'll be
happy to take a look at it. Thank
you,
>> members of the committee.
Let's start here and we'll just
go right around. Representative
Ferrari. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair and thank
you for
that quick
um overview
of, you know, the boards
and all the different things that you do
at RL D. Um
It's pretty
expansive, all the different
things you have to cover.
Um I was wondering
um SI U,
do they still do the
underage operations
such as cops and chops
and underage
drinking prevention?
>> So, Mr chairman and representative
members of the committee, si U
helps us a lot with the alcohol
side. I think
everybody was aware of the knockouts
issue we had where the,
the young kid that 16 year
old pulled a gun and
shot somebody within it. Si U
was heavily involved with it.
I worked closely with us. We
waited for their reports and work
together to, to address
that. So si
U does work
a lot with us on the
alcohol
and tobacco also.
Tobacco, I haven't
be honest with you and had too many
issues with tobacco as of yet. But
yes, it would be tobacco
too >> and
vaping
or I should say nicotine.
I'm sorry. That's
the better, more inclusive
word. I'm sorry.
And Mr Chair, I
also was wondering
do
um you need
um more
funding for SI
U to be able to go out and
do more prevention work
since we have such a difficult problem
in our state.
>> Well, Mr chairman and
representative members of the committee,
uh the funding is always,
you know, an issue to some
extent, alcohol is
able to add two individuals
of the last session. Uh They, they
get to be, we get to bring them on
July 1st and they're gonna mo work
mostly within the
tobacco. The SI U
unit works directly for
the State police. It's, it's their
department. I'm sure they need all the
funding they can get. Uh
we are coming this year
if I get the nod and get the
approval from the governor and then work
with the legislators to get more
funding to work on the cannabis
site. And that would be on
the criminal activity. That's
where we're having huge issues. We can
do anything in the world
administratively, but on
the criminal side, it has became
become a real
challenge,
>> ok.
Real basic question.
I, what is that? >> Special
investigations, >> special
investigations
here >> used
to be division si, but
now it's si
also when
you were talking about
the,
is it New Mexico
plus
where you have
the
expedited licensure
and transfer? Um,
how long does it usually
take, um,
to have
someone who's
in a state
that we have reciprocity?
But they need to
get their licensure
here if they're
losing it in that other
state.
>> Mr Chair Representative
Ferrari, and
usually we can turn that around
within three days if they provide
the the required
documents. It's
a threeday turnaround.
>> That's fantastic.
Um We used to hear
horror stories that it took for a
long time. So as we're
concerned about our healthcare
workforce that this
is something that
will
really help with
um with that.
>> Yes, representative, we have
tried to remove as
many barriers as possible in
order to get the expedited
licensing done as well as
military licensing
done. Um
We've removed quite a
bit great
barrier wise.
>> Thank you for doing that. And Mr
Chair and
um panel are,
is the medical board
under your
kind of
supervision of how
they run things or
they're, they're totally separate.
>> No, Mr Chairman and Representative,
they're, they're separate. We don't
have any authority over there.
I do believe and I appreciate the
question about asking how long it's
taken. One way I can
gauge things is how many complaints
I get and the complaints
have drastically
gone down I mean, we're,
we're always gonna have some
sort of complaints, right? Whether they didn't
get the right information
across to us or if we made a
mistake. But overall the
complaints as far as
I'm aware of, because I will get
one, the minute one hits the, the,
you know what the fourth floor, I'll get that
back the same day quick.
But thank you for that >> question.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair. That's
all
>> Representative Chavez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I
just have a couple of questions.
One of them is about
the provisional
license for social workers. I
understand that that's
uh
not happening
at this
moment.
>> I'm sorry, I'm not sure
about that one. I do. I
do.
I thought that we were doing
provisional licensing
upfront and providing
for them to
sign um
register when they're ready to take
their exam. So
I believe that we have addressed
that issue.
>> Ok. Can you
check on it? Make sure and then just let
me know, >> I definitely will.
>> Ok. All right.
And then I understand just one more
question. I understand that there's maybe a
form for on the,
on the application for
renewal. Uh
Something about
asking if you're a
doctor,
something like that. The form is
not relevant
to the
renewal process.
And so I, I don't have
any more details than that but wanted
to follow up with it >> since you're
here, Mr Chair,
Representative Chavez, I will also
follow up on that and get an answer
for you. Ok? >> Thank
you.
>> Uh No questions, Mr Chair,
Senator Pope.
It's your turn to ask your question.
I've already asked mine. I'm
good.
No, I don't. You get a second
one. >> I'll make a list
for him
>> in all. I have any
questions.
That's fine. You don't have to have a,
just your presence is
enough. I think that great. Do
what I can, Mr
Representative.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and, um, Mr
Superintendent.
So I, I do want to ask
you a related
health question. I
don't see the private
investigators and security
guards listed in
here and I understand
that, uh, at one point
in time they had to take
a, a, um,
I think a mental test to
make sure that they could,
they were capable of
carrying a weapon.
Is that still a part of
the licensing
procedure?
>> Mr Chair Representative
Herndon? Yes, I believe that it is.
It depends on the
level. I
want to say it depends on the
level, security guard
level.
>> It does if
Mr Chair and
Representative, it does
require, if you're gonna be carrying
a weapon, right? It, it's
a, it's a lot more
stringent and a
lot more and to answer your
other, uh, since this is coming
in, I, I'm learning as we
go the next time I'll bring
everything. I thought this would be more healthy.
You probably wouldn't want me to put the occupational
part of it in there. But
next time I will make sure you
have that. >> No,
I was thank you, Mr Chair,
Mr Superintendent.
I, I knew that that's a, a
healthy part of being
able to be a part of the private
investigator and
security guards, um
board and being licensed.
And one other thing I wanted to
comment on and
to commend you on
is that you all take a
strong look if
someone has been
a formerly
incarcerated person,
for example, but they've been
out for a number of years,
you will be, you have been
utilizing the criminal offender
rehabilitation Act to allow
them to become security
guards. And so I think
that's a really important
mental health issue
for allowing
people to find
a way to get work
when they need it and they can work
for themselves. So I just
wanted to commend you on that
and thank you Mr Chair
and Mr Superintendent
for
that.
>> Thank you, Representative Herndon,
Representative
Lujan.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
I guess my question is gonna
go to page
four on the Manufactured
Housing Division. Uh
Where are we
or what insight could you give
us if you can at all on
how
um
the manufactured housing
is being regulated
in the state? If we need to do more, we
need. If there's going to be
legislation you're looking at in
that because it's something that
we've been,
we've been seeing or it's been
coming up an issue, Mr
Chair.
>> So Mr chairman and
representative and members of the committee,
uh as luck would have it. I'm the
MH D director too. So
we wear several hats around
here and, and, and, and I
appreciate it. So,
Mh D is regulated. I have,
uh, eight inspectors
and then two chief inspectors
that go out and do the inspections.
Now, that's, that's a
small number to cover a lot of the
country. But we do it.
Uh, no other
jurisdiction has any,
uh, you know, like Albuquerque
or Bernalillo County, no one
else has jurisdiction over MH
D except for
MH D division. Uh
Part of that goes back to the hood,
a lot of federal stuff. So
in the in plan inspections where
it starts, they use a, a
company called in
nat, I think
it's an A T NTA in A
T but they do the inspections
as they go through the floor. It's
when they come out into the field and
inspections pulled
that uh our permit
request is pulled and then an
inspection, we go out and
we do the inspections. Uh
We've been shorthanded up
until the other day. I'm happy to say
that's the only division
right now. I believe that I'm 100%
staffed. Uh which
is really good. I mean, we've had a
struggle. I, I listen
to this gentleman, one of
the gentlemen that was talking to you earlier
about, you know, being
in a field and being specialized
in the field and, you know,
staying with that field with
construction, whether it's manufactured
housing or, uh,
C ID, it doesn't matter.
It's kind of interchangeable. I use
both of them and help them back and
forth. But,
uh, keeping staff has been
a challenge. Uh, we've
got that 15% for
the inspectors two years
ago. Temporary. And now
we've been outdistanced again
by several dollars
an hour, which nowadays
makes a difference. So,
I, I was taken and getting
in individuals now we're losing them
back to other jurisdictions or they're going
back out into the field, uh,
manufactured housing being,
you know, one of them, I lost
one just recently.
And part of it's the locations,
right? You can't lose
one in Albuquerque. I mean, I don't want to
lose any, but when you lose
one, it'll be the Farmington. It'll
be the Carlsbad. It'll be the areas
that are hard to, to
cover because we have more inspectors
in more of a congested area.
Uh So recently the last
one we put in place was, uh,
got him back in Taos.
That's the newest one and then I got
one in Farmington. So,
uh, I, I don't believe we're maybe
10 days out for the most
part. Uh, on the
inspections, uh
could go higher at times
depending on the area you're in.
But the new guy's name is
Mitchell. Uh Well, he'll be turned loose
in Taos. He should be loosened with about
another week on his own.
Uh But, uh, we, we,
we take that real serious. And
we're trying really hard as with any
of the inspections. And
another challenge is
like the fires we had up
north. A lot of them folks
went back in with manufactured
housing. And so
we're in there now. They're using manufactured
housing for school, uh
school teachers. Mascaro
I think is one of the first ones that's
putting them in, you know, for
the dollar square feet and then a
lot of times the availability and how
quickly it goes. So,
I hope that answered your question. I didn't
talk in a circle but we're trying really hard
to keep it streamlined. >> Thank you for
the update. Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chair,
>> Representative Jones. Do you have
any questions?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
I just wanted to say thank you
for, for the improvements. I
know, I know it's
better for a while. Even a year and
a half ago when I
first started in this position, I
had a lot
of, um, complaints
people have, you know, taking a
long time to get their
license for
whatever, uh, for
various things.
But, uh, even last week,
I had a, a constituent
concern that was taken care of
immediately and I
appreciate all the measures
you guys have taken to make that
happen. So thanks
for the improvements. Thanks for your
work. Thank you, Mr,
chair >> and Mr
chairman and representative and members of
the committee. I, I seriously,
I do take complaints
serious, as you said,
we get on them immediately. Even
if it's at night, if I get a phone call
and I miss it because my voicemail
will fill up. It may be nine
o'clock when I return the call. But you're
gonna get that call back that same day,
even if you don't leave a voicemail.
And I hope the staff, I, I
think they're picking up on that
and they're believing in it. Uh, we're
gonna make our mistakes and, uh, I
do care. So if any
of y'all get complaints, please get
them directly to me, I will
get them to the person if, if they're too
upset, a lot of times I'll
handle it. Uh, if, if it's
something the director can handle, but if
it's just a constituent that just needs
some help right, then we'll get it to the right
staff. But thank you for
that.
>> Thank you. Representative Jones.
I had a few questions. So,
uh, unless anybody else
has one, I'll, I'll jump
in here.
Um,
I, I'm just so impressed
with the turnaround
time on license
applications for
people coming in from other
states. Um,
and it, it does bring
up the issue of
compact
because we had, we've, we've
had
a,
what a, uh, I,
I don't want to over
dramatize it.
Uh, a tragic
experience trying to get
compacts through the,
our Senate judiciary
committee. Uh, three
years in a row. I banged my head
against the wall, uh,
of the judiciary
committee trying to get the psychology
compact, the psych
compact
and, um,
they just would not buy it,
but you've pretty much taken
care of the problem, I think unless
I'm missing something
because if, if a
psychologist
from
Alabama
wants to come to New
Mexico
or wants to be licensed
in New Mexico, not necessarily
relocate here but be
licensed here to
practice because
they've got a few of their,
their former patients who
moved
here,
they can get licensed
in three days time if they're
fully licensed and, and they're
not under scrutiny
in Alabama, you'll
give them a license here in three days
time. Something like that,
>> Mr Chair
committee, what
we have done is we have prepared
a list of
comparable
jurisdictions where we
accept straight
across their
credentials from their
state to our state. So
that has helped quite a bit
when it comes to the
accepting them and licensing
them immediately and
the fact that it's all online
and when they
apply and they have to
supply
their documentation,
which is basically that they're
in good standing and have a current
license that meets the standards
that are required in New
Mexico. They can,
they're automatically
licensed and
processed
>> that, that pretty
much obviates the need for
compact. I mean,
if you're doing that with social
workers in
several states, now they're
going through all the rigmarole of trying
to get a compact set up
and, and get
different states to sign
in. But,
but I unless I'm really
missing something
that we were that we,
that a compact would give us that
you're not able to do with
this rapid turnaround
on license applications.
I mean, they can do telehealth
from Alabama.
If that's one of the jurisdictions
on your list, I maybe the
list is the list
missing several key
states. >> Um
Each board, Mi
Mr Chair, I'm sorry. Um
Each board
um
pursuant to
I'm not sure if it was House
Bill 384 or
121.
I think it was 121
that required that each
board do
an analysis of comparable
states. So we
did do that for each of our
boards. Each board does
have, with the exception of P
I does have a
list of states that we do
accept. Now, we do still
have some
states that we don't accept
that we still have
to deal with. And it's not done
within that three day
time period.
But if it is on
that list of acceptable states,
it moves very
fast.
>> Well, that's terrific. And,
and now the
only thing I would wonder
when you're gone and another
superintendent in 10 years,
is there, is there
any way that this has been
institutionalized?
So that
the three day turnaround is
going to be
enduring
>> Mr chair. I would have to
say that it was all built into
NM Plus
because NM
PLUS took into consideration
every board statutes and
rules that
governed them
and that was all built into the
system. So I would say
that yes, it would
still be there. It,
it's institutionalized.
Yes. And
as those rules and statutes
change NM Plus will
be updated.
So yes, I believe
it will stay >> good.
Good. That's
great.
Then I had two other
questions that kind
of uh
came to mind. As you
made your presentation, Mister
Superintendent, one
is on slide 10 in your
presentation.
Well, you're talking about collaborating
with the Human Services
Department
on the Medicaid Management
Information System to create a
consistent interface
for verifying life
insured during
enrollment
and a three year
reenactment
intervals. Are
we talking about providers
there?
So, go ahead.
>> Um, Mr Chair,
this is something that's been
taken, was taking place
while I was not there.
It was handled by Dr Coll
Pepper in our
office and it is
something that we are still trying
to put in place right now.
Uh, the program that
we are planning to use
serves two purposes.
One
to,,
uh,
check,
uh,
licenses whether they
owe on child
support.
It's kind of, it's
that program with
Medicare. I'm not
exactly if we're checking the
provider or the person
who's applying because
I wasn't involved in
that
one.
>> I'll bet it's a provider.
Well, I don't know, it could be
either way, but I, I
was, I was misunderstanding
that I thought maybe this
was how you were gonna help
them because we
understand that instead of leaving it
up to each of the managed care
organizations,
uh, to do their own
certifying
credentialing
of providers
the way it's been, traditionally,
each one of them had their own
list of
credentialed
providers and they might be
different and this is somebody might
be a provider under
Blue Cross, but not under
Presbyterian or
that. Now, the state was
going to centralize
that. And if you're
credentialed by
Medicaid, all
the mcs would have
to
accept you as a provider
for reimbursement purposes,
but you're not talking about that here.
That's something different. >> Mister Chair.
I think that now that you
said that, I think
that's, I
can recall that now.
Ok. So I
think what they're trying to do is they're
trying to
obtain an interface
where they can
verify that a
provider is licensed
without having to, where
it's automatic through our
system. Rather than having
to send in a request for a verification
and waiting for that verification
to come through. They're trying
to work on an interface where
they can put the person's name in
and determine immediately
whether they are a licensed
provider in good standing.
>> Ok,
good. That could really
help. Um
Then I did have a question
on manu manufactured
housing.
Um My eyes
lit up when I saw that too because
like a lot of us,
I've been getting
these
incredible
um
very
um
touching
emails from people who are
in a nurse, not a nursing
home in a uh in
a trailer
park manufactured
housing
facility
and, and it's been
sold, it's been sold to a
private equity company
that comes in
and it says to them
the rent now
is it
used to be $600 a month
for your space.
Now it's gonna be
$1600 a month.
And besides which your
junky old
uh single wide just
doesn't fit with our new
uh gentrified
perception of what this trailer
park should look like. You're
out of here
unless you can pay 1600
replace your single
wide with one of these big
double wides and,
and um,
artificial
turf
and, and they're gone and they
have no, they can't even move
their trailer because it's been 25
years. There's no more.
The tires have all rotted off.
They're just, it's just, it's been
there for 25 years.
Do you have any
role at all in
the operation
of those
uh parks.
>> So Mr Chairman, members of
the committee, we do not.
We've, I know two
of you're talking about are from down
south, right? Uh
I'm not positive the
same person doesn't know them both, but we
get a lot of complaints. We've dealt with
them. They, they have some
frustrations that are incredible
water leaks,
gas leaks, you know, the things
that are going on, but that's under
the mobile home, the
mobile home park
and we don't have any
jurisdiction. We're just code
enforcement on a home that's been
set. Uh Not one that's
been there or not over
a mobile home park owner.
I would suspect there's gonna
be some legislation
introduced this year, not from
us, but I, I just, there's been
a lot of rumblings with this going
on that. I it's becoming
quite, quite an issue, especially
some of these parks that are old and
starting to have
some real issues. Some uh
you know, like the gas lines and water
lines. >> So when you
say manufactured
housing, you're
not really necessarily talking about
mobile homes, you're talking about
these factory
produced
homes that
are put down on a
permanent foundation.
Those are the ones you
have some authority over. >> Well,
and Mr Chairman, if
they do set one, say they move
one out of a mobile home park and
they move it out and they put another
one in, we will in fact
go inspect and make sure it's installed
correctly. But that's all
we have is the HUD codes and
our, our, our inmac codes
that allow us on new
installations or even
even moving an existing
home to another installation.
That's what we have, but we have
no authority whatsoever
on quote, the mobile home
parks and the way it's written
in the way I, because lately we've
been dealing with this quite a bit, you know,
quite a few calls and emails and
things is that the way it's
written, they're, they're
only just is
to go civilly to
court and
it's been brought up. A lot of these folks
don't have the money
to, to hire an attorney
as opposed to fighting some folks.
But as of right now, we have
no authority other than just on
the installation of a home
that's being moved in right
then.
>> Um,
thank you. I, I
just had a couple of questions for
your cannabis
division director. If
he's, if, if he or she
is available here,
he is
good.
And this is a little far a field
from our topic, but since
you're here, I wanted to take
advantage of you being here
uh There, there are two things
about the way our
cannabis
um
uh lic
your program is working that
are, that,
that I wanted to ask about. One
is the,
the original version of the
bill when we passed
it, uh
had a, a
provision that it gave the department
the authority to
decide that we've
got enough uh
based on,
on uh market
analysis or whatever,
we've got enough dispensaries.
We, we, we simply don't
need another three
dispensaries in this
community or wherever.
Um is that,
is that something? But apparently
that was taken out because there's no
such authority now,
right? You can't say
we've got
enough
>> uh Mr chair members
of the committee, we
do not have
any kind of authority to limit
leener. What we can do is
raise or lower the
total plant count for
a particular licensee.
Uh So if we determine
that the uh
community or the state
was under uh
supported, we could
raise that plant count for the
maximum count to allow licenses
to grow more or if it
becomes uh too
saturated, we can look at
uh lowering that plant
count. But as far as the number
of licensees or cannabis
premises, we do not have an
authority to limit
those. >> Would you be
interested in having that
authority?
>> Uh Mr Chair
members of the committee, we always open to
have discussions and hear the
positives and negatives of both
what that would do to the community
because >> because what I'm
told, you know, a number of, of
people who've
invested their life
savings
in this
new get rich quick
operation, uh,
have now discovered
that they,
a dozen similar
facilities within a few
blocks of them
and none of them are
making an en enough money
to really
shake a stick at. So
it, it
just seems to me that we may be
hurting ourselves by
opening the door as widely
as we
have
>> Mr chair members of the committee.
I understand the
concern and, and we've heard this a
little bit, I
was not around during
the inception
of that bill. However, I know
that there was a large
concern about ensuring that everyone
got an equal opportunity to
participate in this market
where in other states,
we see ping pong balls
deciding the fates of these
licensees and
the low barrier of entry
allowing New Mexicans to chase
their dream is one of the reasons that
that this uh job
appealed to me. Um
We are not afraid of the work and
want to continue to feel how we can
support uh and are always
open for conversations and
debate. >> Um
The other, the second thing
is the
um and this
was not with the way the bill was
originally proposed either,
but it was tacked on
that. Is this
um
escalation in
the, in the tax,
uh the gross receipts or
the no, I guess it's not the gross
receipts tax. It's the cannabis excise
tax and,
and, and that's gonna kill
us. I think, uh,
can we do,
has the department or your division
taken a position on trying to
repeal that automatic
escalator, the
senator who put that on is
no longer in the Senate. So we
could, we could do it without
raising his, his
objections.
>> Uh, Mr
Chairman, members of the committee,
again, we're always open to hear
these, these feedback to
discuss through the positives
and negatives of what uh
increasing or taking
away that step increase.
Um I have heard folks that are
in favor and I've heard folks that, that
are against as well.
Um So again, look forward
to uh discussing these
hearing points from each
side.
>> Oh, ok. Thanks. It
just seems to me that, you know, we,
we almost
guarantee the continuation
of the black market
or the illicit
market if we don't,
if we keep escalating the tax
and making the product so
expensive compared to
the, to the ones
that are uh
smuggled in or brought in from
another state or, or raised
here without license.
Representative Luhan.
>> Thank you. Thank you for bringing up
the Mr Chair of
the, the Cannabis
Regulation
Act. I
was one of the
um
I was a bill sponsor and
all those things that you mentioned
were in the bill that I
sponsored.
Um
and, and we are where we are at
and I, and I do believe in,
in, in the way that we went about
trying to equalize things and, and
bringing in those
that had the interest that didn't
necessarily have the income to
start a small
business. But we are
at, at a high
capacity, we are
at capacity.
So I think we're well
in our uh a range
of, of looking at legislation
there, Mr Chair, but I also had
another bill and I just forgot
to bring it up and questions
was FBI background
check, which
we've just heard of
testimony that we're having
issues um
in the, the regulation of
cannabis and in the legal
uh um
process, I guess if
you will. Um can
you let us know
um with the bill
that made it through this last
session? Have you
contacted the FBI and
have they approved
the guidelines of which
we've given them for FBI
background checks? Mr
Chair,
>> uh Mr Chair, members of the
committee. Uh
We
uh we're in communication
with the Department of
Public Safety. Uh They
send off the RO I
requests for
uh civil agencies
to be able to do that. Uh We
checked in with DPS about
a month ago and what we
were told is it was
sent to the FBI
for the ROR I
number and we're just waiting on some
feedback that was sent in
uh I believe April by
DPS. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair. Can you give us an update on that
when you get it, Mr uh Mr
Chair? We, I'd like to
know so that we can
um prepare
legislation for this
next session if necessary.
Thank
you,
>> Representative Ferrari.
Thank >> you Mr Chair.
That kind of
reminded me that
um are you
working or is there
anything getting better
between uh border
patrol and cannabis
being transported through
our state, especially from
Southern New
Mexico.
>> Mr chairman and
Representative,
uh
the positive thing,
I hope knocking on wood, we
haven't had any seizures
since May I
believe, I don't
know where it's going. Uh We've
reached out and done everything we can
so I don't know for certain,
but we haven't had any seizures.
At least I hope this doesn't
starting back up. But
uh but yes, right now,
nothing's been said nothing's been
written, nothing's been given to us, but
we hadn't had any others come
forward. Now, there have been some,
even though they're required to tell
us or requested for
sure, there's some that
haven't came
forward, but usually we get it somewhere
on the background. So, you know, on the
backside that we'll get it
and, and going back to
uh the, the chairman's
speaking about
licensees and things,
one thing about it, the retail
licenses have leveled
out. I, I watch
them, they give them to me daily
and for the last 6 to 8
months, it's, it's average
from like 1000
7 to 1000 10. It just,
it's not going anywhere. It's,
it's leveled out. And
of that there's
30% I
believe that have never had
any activity. I think some
folks reached out and got licenses
and had them and they haven't done
anything. So it's
leveled out right now.
We haven't had
a rush whatsoever.
The last few times it's been set
at the same number for about the
last month or month
and a half. So I don't know if that's
helpful, but I did want to add
that. And did I answer
your question? Yes.
>> Thank you very much.
That's all Mr Chair.
>> Well, thank you very much.
Thank you for the presentation.
Thanks for the work you're doing on
expediting those licenses
that really helps. Uh
and um
we, we look forward to working
with you.
>> Well, thank you, Mr Chairman,
members of the committee. I really appreciate
y'all allowing us to come in
here next time. I'll be have a little
more information, a little more prepared
and uh as we go along,
but thank you very much. >> You, you
did a very good presentation. Thank
you, Mr Superintendent and thank
you, division directors. Thank
you.
Ok. We now
move to the legislative
finance committee report on
hospital rates and
accountability
and the presenter is
Allegra Hernandez. Doctor
Hernandez is a senior
fiscal analyst
with the
LFC.
>> Good
afternoon.
Good afternoon. Members,
Mr chair members of the committee.
My name is Dr Alegra Hernandez
and I am here today to discuss
hospital rates and
accountability.
New Mexican hospitals had
a net revenue of over
$334
million in 2022.
Concurrently, they are receiving
unprecedented subsidies
from both the state and federal
government but the state
subsidies have uneven
financial impact and are
likely to help hospitals that are
larger and more profitable
than hospitals that are currently
experiencing negative
profitability.
While hospitals post
pandemic have roughly the
same net gains as they had
prior to the COVID-19
pandemic,
profitability varies
greatly across the state.
And as a whole, non urban
hospitals are worse off
than urban hospitals
because of large state
investment, the state now
has a unique opportunity to
increase accountability of hospitals
within New Mexico.
Further estimates show
government revenues will comprise
at least 74%
of hospital revenues
in 2025.
Triggering concerns about
hospital viability.
If you now turn your attention to
page one, you will see that
profitability varies greatly
among hospitals throughout the
state.
Nationally, non urban
hospitals dei defined
as either frontier role
are financially struggling
and many have been forced to downsize
at greater rates than in the
past. The same
is true in New Mexico
of the 12 hospitals that
experienced that losses in
2022 9
were classified as non
urban. Moreover,
when examining 2022
fiscal data, New Mexico
Hospitals experienced approximately
the same profit margins
as they did prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic,
hospitals experienced a
financial windfall during the
pandemic that was
unsustainable.
Additionally, the same number
of hospitals lost money in
22 as in
2019. This
indicates that hospital viability
is the same pre pandemic
as post pandemic
as seen in the second
graph. On page
two,
rate increases for New
Mexican hospitals increased
exponentially in the past six
years. With New Mexico
investing an additional
nine hun nine
hun nine,
100 $72.5
million in hospitals for fiscal
years. 24 and 25.
Excuse me,
if you now turn to page
three,
the health care quality
Delivery and Access Act
or Senate bill
17
targets hospitals based on
bed size and performance, meaning
that larger hospitals will get a
bigger share. This
act takes advantage of the multiplier
effect of an almost 75%
Medicaid match with
the assessment providing the
state's 25%
share in achieving a $3
revenue impact for every
dollar invested.
60% of dollars
returned to the hospitals
is based on Medicaid service.
Volume
analysis found the act
to have uneven impact
on financial
finances on
hospital finances. Excuse
me, for example,
Rehobeth mckinley Christian
Hospital, which lost close to
$20 million in
2022
will receive approximately a
little more than $6.5
million from the health care Quality
Delivery and Access Act.
This will not cover the full
extent extent
of the losses that Rehobeth
faces and they will
still have a clear negative,
they will still have a negative net
margin of more than $13
million. In
contrast, Eastern New
Mexico Medical Center, which
experienced a 12%
net gain in 20 22
will receive more than
$37 million
from the act. Eastern
New Mexico Medical Center
earned close to $80 million
in 2022.
If their earnings stay on track
profit, in conjunction with
funding from the act will give them
close to $117
million. More
broadly in
2022 investor
and hospitals made up
100 and $68
million in net gains.
These same hospitals will
receive an approximate
$281
million from the Act.
Only two out of 19
hospitals that were investor owned
are financially struggling.
Ultimately, this do this
act does not target hospitals
that are financially
insolvent
hospitals experienced
significant rate or investment
increases in recent years
and going forward. There's an
opportunity to increase
accountability and access.
40% of funds
allocated from the healthcare quality
and delivery act are performance
based. Thus far,
New Mexico Hospital Association
and Health Care Authority have
not. Oh, excuse
me. Um
For
and for urban hospitals,
an agreement was reached focusing
on eight measures.
However, these measures are not new
and may not focus on the most important
items such as improving
workforce or
access.
When creating the measures for
urban hospitals. The health care
authority has a unique
opportunity to make
certain hospitals only
receive funds if performance
improves for New Mexicans
served and thus holds
up hospitals accountable for the
1.1 billion they will
receive in state funds.
I would now like to turn your attention
to the graph on page
four.
In 2022 government
revenues made up about
70% of total
hospital revenues.
LFC staff
projected the share
will increase by 4% in
2025.
This gives the legislature a
unique opportunity to
impact change.
First. The state has the
hospi has
the ability to hold hospitals
accountable and high accountability
to funding. Second,
because so much of the revenues
that hospitals receive come
from the government. It may be possible
to either reduce cost
or medicate growth of
revenues that state employees
pay.
Finally, if you turn to page
five labor and delivery
cost to charge ratios vary
greatly across hospitals
and explain hospital profitability
or lack thereof cost
to charge ratios for
2022
range from 4% to
300%.
The cost of charge ratio,
Presbyterian is 4%
meaning it is making a
96% profit
in billing on
labor and delivery services.
At the other end of the spectrum,
Alta Vista hospital,
Las Vegas had
a Costa charge ratio of
300%.
This means that for every dollar
cost the hospital to provide
delivery services,
the hospital lost
$3. Alta
Vista Hospital stopped providing
labor and delivery services in
June 2022
concerns remain for the
other 10 hospitals
charging less than what it costs to
provide these obstetrical
services.
I would like to close by saying
that the state and hospitals
will likely need to continue to
make difficult decisions about
when it is necessary to close
hospitals or sections of
hospitals.
Of note, if a
hospital gains
a rural emergency
designation, they
will receive an additional 5%
of Medicare funds and a yearly
facility payment of approximately
$3 million
this may serve as a solution
for small hospitals that have
net losses.
One hospital in New Mexico,
Guadalupe County Hospital
has thus far made this
transition. However,
the legislature is in a unique
position to ensure that in five
years, hospitals are not in the
same position as they are.
Now. I would like
to conclude by stating
that we are continuing to update
data and we'll make adjustments
accordingly to this report. Thank
you.
>> I think we're still digesting.
This may take a few
seconds.
You ready?
Ok.
Representative Ferrari wants to
start. Um >> Thank
you, Mr Chair and thank you
for
this
a lot of information
uh that we need to
um kind of,
as you said, digest.
Um but
why was
Rio Rehobeth
receiving so
little compared to some of
the other hospitals
um under the
act that
was giving them more funds?
Why when they had such a
big
uh
uh deficit,
did they receive so
little when others that didn't
have as big a deficit
received so much more.
So >> to be clear, these are all
projections, these
have not act, the funds
have not been issued to the hospitals
yet. And so these
are our best
projections as to what will
happen. Um
But the reason that that is is
because uh bigger
hospitals are paying
more into it and then
smaller hospitals are paying at a
lesser rate. And
then what occurs after that is
that it's divided by is
that it's allocate
60% of what was
paid is
multiplied and given back to
the hospitals based on Medicaid
patients.
And so
this act is not
equitable in which
hospitals receive how much
money. And so it's not
actually targeting hospitals
that are at risk of
closure.
>> Um Mr Chair and
um thank
you. Um they
should
be
um
getting more of that
40% that's
left to the
hospitals that need it the
most. So >> the 40%
is based off of performance,
which if you look
at
table
one on page
four, um
you will see that these are the
measures that the Hospital
Association and the Health
Care Authority have come up
conjointly,
none of these measures actually
look at ensuring that
workforce is
going to improve, that
access will improve.
And so there are concerns
about whether these
measures will a hold
hospitals accountable,
but b ensuring
that um
performance is
actually
being taken into account
and that not every hospital is just
receiving their 40% of the
share, but the 40%
of the share is not based
on how
hospitals doing financially,
it's based on their
performance.
>> Um So mister Chair
and um,
it's Allegra. >> Yes,
>> ma'am.
How are the
hospitals
most in need supposed
to make those improvements
if they don't have the
funding? Um >> I
do not have the answer for that
unfortunately.
>> Ok. Thank you. That
um and also,
um
why are
hospitals
charging less
than what they need
for?
I think it was for the
delivery services.
>> Yes, Mr Chair
members of the labor and delivery.
Yes. So
there are a few reasons why they might
be charging less. It might
be because they don't
have the resources
to figure out exactly
how much things are costing. There are few
reasons for why that might be
happening, but we don't
really know why hospitals
are charging less. It's, these
are just what they're reporting
to C MS at the
end of each year in their hospital cost
reports, but we haven't
been able to figure out why
exactly in
this instance,
it was
Altavista Hospital
was charging so much less.
Um Los Alamos
was another case where that was
occurring and there are
several hospitals that are charging
less for labor and delivery
services.
Um Labor
and delivery services are not
necessarily the most profitable
section of hospitals,
but
financially it would make sense
to charge at least what it's
costing them to provide the
services. >> Ok. Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you
and
>> Representative
Luhan.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
I think the
most
uh grasping
piece of this for me, Mr
Chair is on page
three.
the third paragraph
up given the structure of
the Act
and I that's referring to
the SB 17. Is that correct?
Thank
you.
Hospitals, most, most
at risk of downsizing
may not see much
benefit.
So generally speaking, hospitals
that are not fiscal, fiscally
challenged will receive
the bulk of the financial
aid based
on bed counts, for example,
as discussed above,
investor owned hospitals
are largely meeting the 6%
national benchmark in terms
of profitability,
I would assume Mr Chair.
Um all
the, so that
6% threshold is with
the language within SB
17. Is that
correct? >> No. Um
so the 6%
threshold is what
um national hospital
organizations say is a healthy
profitability for a
hospital.
Um So if you actually turn
your attention to page
eight,
um what you'll
see here is that
it has the 2022
net income for
each hospital
and you'll see that
hospitals in the red
except for San Juan
Medical Regional Center
and Sibila General
Hospital
are the
hospitals that are experiencing the
least profitability are
the least likely to come
out with a
positive
net margin at the end of
the year. >> Thank
you. And I
would ask, yeah, we need to look at
page eight. I was looking there
uh
briefly as well. I'm
just trying to put this all together.
So in the
act, if the hospitals meet,
meet this
6% threshold
that they, I they
believe is
the >> 6% threshold
is not inac correct,
>> but it is what we're working
with and understanding
where, where we are getting
these um
uh markups. If you will
to help benefit these other
hospitals, we're supposed to
benefit those that have
the most need, but we're through
this report, they're not getting that
benefit. >> So
1st
17 or the
health care quality and delivery
and Access act
not written in such a
way that hospitals that
are the least profitable were
supposed to benefit more
than hospitals that were
profitable.
And then the second point that I'd like
to make is
that hospitals
are paying and I can get this
information to you. I can get how
much hospitals are paying in,
but they're all paying at a different
rate based
on how many
Medicaid
patients they are
serving. >> Thank
you Mr Chair. That's, that's
what I'm trying to get the crux
of how are we get? What,
what is the funding and what does it
look like? And, and how is it
being really
dispersed? And
I, I just, I'm, I'm not seeing
that through your chart
particularly, but I'm
hearing that there are,
there are some red flags here for
us to pay attention to Mr
Chair. And I think
that
that is the large crux
for me, given the structure of the Act
hospitals most at risk
of downsize, you may not
see much benefit.
And we tried to come
up with a solution and
that's through this
SB 17, we're
looking for that solution. Is that
correct Mr Chair?
All? Yes, that is correct.
Thank you. So we're not,
that's not what we're
seeing.
Great. So then when I'm looking
at page four in
your
um
the total revenue is broken down
by types of care.
And it says here, almost three
quarters of hospital
revenues are
government subsidies.
That is correct.
I think we need to, we need to pay
attention to that as well.
Mr Chair. I think that that is
that, is
that then you say later
on in your report here that
that then becomes a
carrot, so we can look at
those benefits and try to
make those balances. Is that
correct? >> That is up to the
legislature? That
>> that's what we can make a change or
we can look at where those
subsidies are as we
hold. If you
will a carrot, Mr
Chair to, to
make some of these changes,
I appreciate this report so
much. Thank you so much
for this. This really gives us an insight
to, you know, we don't
always have all the answers
when we come up with legislation,
but I know that we worked
together with, with
institutions, with legislators,
with the executive office,
particularly on
this bill. And so
we need to, it looks like we need to
make some adjustments. Thank you, Mr
Chair
>> Representative
Herndon.
I'm
sorry.
>> Yeah,
thank you, Mr
Chair.
This is huge.
Um And it is a lot
to digest in just a
few
brief moments.
Um A couple of
reactions that I have
one
we're talking about
um health care
is a for-profit
industry. I think we need to
not, I think we need to
reverse that. We need to
change the paradigm.
Health care should not be for-profit
that's getting us into trouble.
Um, for hospitals to
think that the state is going to
continue to
basically
support them
or for
us to be able to even
try to continue
to add the kind
of money that we're adding into
hospitals without really
any kind of say
any kind of accountability
because I don't think that
SB 17 is really going to
make hospitals accountable.
Um My
understanding is
that all
hospitals would be eligible for
this, including the private equity
hospitals. And I have a
real problem with that.
Um I think that we
need to look at other solutions
as opposed to
us just
continuing to
um
pull hospitals
out of their financial
distress. We need to figure
out a better
system for me.
I think global budgets
are a much better way to approach
this and
it would actually speak
to what rural hospitals
need in terms of
the kind of care like labor and
delivery care that they need to provide
for, for their
citizens. I just want
to talk a little bit about
Rehobeth. Uh Rehobeth was
badly managed and
that's why they're in financial
distress.
Um
So for this, it's up
to, it's for the year
2022
but 2023
hasn't been added
to this. Um
And you
know, it was so badly mismanaged
that the entire and I think I, I said
that before the entire all
of the nurses in labor and delivery
um, left because their
conditions, their working conditions
were so very bad.
Um, using
Presbyterian as an
example, I
see on page
eight that
they're in the
red
and I don't understand
why and I don't
even know if we would ever know
why.
Um, the same thing goes
for the private equity hospitals
and I want to reflect back to
something that was said this morning in
terms of Memorial
Hospital, memorial is,
is run by lifepoint,
which also runs Los Alamos
Medical Center. Again,
private equity, they're
not publicly traded. And
so how much of
their financial
situation are we going to be
able to find out about
if they are private
equity?
I just have some major concerns
about the amount of money that,
that we are
um
giving right now at this
moment in time. And really the reality
is, is that we don't have any control
over that. Um And
I think we need to change the paradigm
in terms of, of what
we're doing uh in New
Mexico.
Um Maryland
has been successful in terms
of global budgets and
that's something that I think that we really
need to look at.
Um So
Mr Chair II, I guess
I, at this moment, I don't really have
any questions, but
I mean, I think
that we need to be
able to have more time
to really digest all of this
and really you know, make
some some
recommendations
that are coming
from really the
hospital interests,
>> Mr Chair. Can I make a
clarification?
Um So Mr
Chair and Representative
Chavez, so we will
have 2023 data from
the Health Care Authority by the end
of this month, hopefully.
And so I'm happy to send along the
updates of what 2023
hospital financial health looks
like. Um
Additionally, I think
that as 17
has the ability
to ensure
that hospitals are
performing better through the
measures. However,
the measures have to be
revised.
And so I think that there is some
room in SV 17
to allow
for
these hospitals to be held
accountable for as much money
as they are getting. And then
the last thing that I would like to say
is that Presbyterian
is reporting to be in the
red. Um
However, we believe that a
lot of the reason that this is
happening having gone
through the hospital cost reports
is because they're sending
a lot of money to the home
office and that's
considered a write-off
in error loss in the
cost reports.
And so I don't think that it's
actually reflective of
Presbyterians health,
financial
Health.
>> So again, Mr
Chair, I would say that,
you know, we need
additional information,
we need more time to digest
this. And I think that we
um as a legislature
need to, to
again, um
come up with a solution that
changes the paradigm.
Um and
that really gives
us what we need, gives the citizens
of the state what they need in terms
of health care. Um
I, again,
I more convinced that we should
not be treating health care as a
for profit entity that's going to
get us into some big trouble
and we're going to continue to have to
bail out hospitals.
One of the other things that I wanted
to also point out is that,
you know, some of these nonprofit hospitals
don't pay property taxes.
So, you know, that's sort of
another boon to them.
Ums
Vincent's in Hos in
Santa Fe is a good
example. Presbyterian is another
example and there probably are
others. Um So I
think we need to really look at the totality
of, of what's happening
here. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Chavez
Representative
Herndon. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair and thank
you madam presenter.
Can you tell me if
the if
Secretary or Mihill or
anyone from her staff
has had the opportunity to
review this report?
>> Yes, Mr Chair
and Representative
Herndon, we
presented this report in front
of the LFC and
Secretary Army Hill made comments
at the time on
the report. >> And Mr
Chair and madam presenter, did
she agree with the conclusions?
>> She
didn't,
she did not for the most
part.
>> Ok. If not,
what were the, what were
the points in the report that she
most disagreed with? Can
you share those with us? >> Yes,
she most disagreed
with the
push to change
the measures led
by the HC A
and um the
Hospital Association. And
that's because these are industry backed
measures. However, the
concern here
from our end is that these
measures will
not
um
increase access
and accountability for
hospitals and
perf improve
performance. Excuse
me. So that
was the major point of
contention.
>> Have now Mr
Chair and madam presenter, have
the individuals,
hospitals had
the opportunity to review the
report. >> It
was published
publicly. And then
additionally, I know
that Rehobeth viewed the
report because they were they
presented with us
as well at LFC
as for the other hospitals. I
don't know. >> So is
there any feedback from them that you
can share with us?
>> No, I I
know that they,
I know that Rehobeth
believed that they would be getting
more than what our projections
show. Um
However, I
used um
the Hospital Association's
data to create these
projections. So I feel
confident that they will be
roughly around what is
written in this report
>> and Mr chair madam
presenter just for my own
information. So
the difference between a
for-profit hospital and
a non for profit hospital,
does the for-profit hospital
have
shareholders?
>> That I am not sure
about that. I will get back to you. >> I
think that's important
for us to know for purposes of
funding and money
and will now,
when will the hospital start
receiving money from the
health care delivery?
And >> it will be
this year?
>> Thats today,
>> I don't believe it will be today.
I'll have to, I
know that the health care authority was
working on a specific date when the
funds be released.
Um But I'll have to get
back to you about when exactly that
is, >> I think that would
be really important. And
what additional steps do you
think that we as the
legislature
should do to support
hospitals, especially
rural hospitals that are
financially troubled
and you know, specifically
the one that comes to everybody's attention
is Rehobeth
and um
help us with that because
that hospital is critical
to the operations of the people
on the west side of the
state. >> I think
that there are two things
and of course, I'm not the decision
maker here. You all are.
Um But I
think that there are two things that are
really important. I think that the
first is holding hospitals
accountable and
that you have to have measures
that have teeth and
that ensure that
hospitals are
going to improve
access and
their accountability.
Um And I think that's the first
thing that the legislature has the
power to do.
I think the second thing
is that these are going to be tough
conversations
and in the next five
years, I don't believe
that SB 17 or the
healthcare quality Access and
Delivery Act are
going to ensure that hospitals
are in a better place in five
years than they are
now. And so I think it's
working to ensure
that five years from now,
hospitals are at a much
healthier place than they are
right now. Although
as you can see on page eight,
most hospitals are
profitable in the
state.
Additionally, I
think, and it's not,
it's controversial.
But as I said in
closing,
um
the excuse
me, the
um rural emergency
designation possible by
Medicaid is
one potential answer.
Although it's not necessarily
the most popular answer
as it would close hospital
beds and only allow
for emergency services.
But in exchange,
hospitals would be receiving
$3 million
plus 5%
an additional 5%
in Medicare funds. And
so that is an option
although as I said, it is
controversial.
>> All right. Thank you. And then one
more question, Mr chair
madam presenter.
So the new Mexico
Hospital Association Speaker
mentioned that they shared
some concerns with you about
the report and can
you share what those
are? And if they've been addressed
in the report that we have
today? >> Um
So I think the largest share
was once again the concern about
the measures and the pushback that
we've done on the measures.
Um There were also
some
areas identified where
they believe that we had factual
errors. So that did not get
to us in enough time prior
to us sending this report.
Um, but I'm working on
updating the,
um, report
and addressing any
concerns that we believe
are correct.
Um And so I'm happy
to get you a list
of what we end up changing in
this report. And like I said, it's an
ongoing report that we'll be
updating. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair.
This is a lot of information.
Will this be coming back
before us again before we go
into the legislative
session?
>> We can certainly add it to a
future agenda. I
mean, as we have updated information,
I think it makes a lot more sense.
So at one of our subsequent
meetings, we could
pick it up again
and uh Allegra
is available to help us.
So
it's not like scheduling her is
going to be difficult.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Allegra
>> Representative Jones.
You're up next, followed by Representative
block.
Representative block. You're up
next, followed by Senator
Ortiz Y Pino. >> Thank
you, Mr Chairman. Thank you. Is
it Doctor Hernandez?
Great. Thank you, Doctor
Hernandez. So a couple of
questions. First page of your
report says
blah, blah, blah congressional budget
office says that 6%
is approximately
the profit margin.
And is that profit?
Because I mean, nonprofits don't make a
profit, right? So where'd you
get that figure? And is
that
now or is that
pre pandemic?
So >> I
I would have to go.
So this was
prior to the COVID-19
pandemic.
Um What I
demonstrate,
um
I don't think I showed in this
report, but I've done the analysis
which demonstrates
that hospitals that are,
are at roughly the same
place that they were prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
So I think 6% is still a
fair benchmark.
Um You do
want nonprofit
hospitals to not be operating
at a deficit. Um
But after that, it's a
little bit unclear if 6%
is still a good benchmark for
nonprofit hospitals.
Did that answer your question?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and
Dr Arnone. It did.
I'm just wondering because it seems so
low, right? 6%
profit. If it was a
for profit entity, that's
not really a very good.
Like I wouldn't be in that business,
right? So I think
that's good that we're, they're we're giving
help to these hospitals.
But it just seems interesting to me,
especially with the windfall
during COVID. I just
wonder how much of a
profit was increased
due to the, the
governmental subsidies
that we saw during
the congressional
allocations.
It says what 100 and something
billion across the
country. So I'm just wondering
that increase that number at all,
Mr Chair. >> So if you look at
page seven appendix
B, you can
see that the median
profit margin
increased in 2020 to
3%. And then you
can see that in 2021
it increased to
5.7%.
And that is from
federal funding for the
COVID-19 pandemic.
And so you can see that there actually
was a
significant increase in
funding,
which
was not something
that was going to continue
post the
pandemic
if that makes sense.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you. So page seven,
I did have a question on page seven.
So this is net profit.
Is that correct or is that
gain? >> I'm
sorry, it should say profit not
gain. >> Ok, Mr Chair.
Thank you. I just had a, I
thought some of these hospitals were
increasing things like
100% such
as Loveless
Downtown. It
says like 60%
98% 91% and then
now or 2022 it says
48%. So that's
just the net
profit technically,
but it's not, it's a not for profit. So
technically, they did not make a
profit. >> So they did
make a profit, >> but they
just don't make it like
it's not like a, I own a
business and it's a hospital.
I don't get 48% profit.
It just goes back into the
general allocation of that
entity. >> That is my
understanding at this point.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you Dr
one more question. I
know that there are increased
costs when it comes
to
delivering babies.
And so Mr Chairman Doctor
Hernandez, I was wondering
how can hospitals be making
like a 96%
profit uh
on labor and delivery
when they deliver so many of the
state's babies?
And I'm just wondering how that factors
in. >> So
Presbyterian is a good example,
which is the one that I used in
here. And
so all that this means is
it's not necessarily what they're
getting back from
Medicaid.
Um
and Medicare, wait, Medicaid,
excuse me. I'm sorry. Um,
but what it is is that
it's what they're charging
and so we don't know
exactly from the cost reports,
exactly how much
they're getting back, but we
know what they're reporting to C
MS to be true.
And so in this case,
for Presbyterian,
it's a 96% profit
margin.
>> Ok. Thank you Mr Chair. And
with, so when you
did this data
gathering,
did you take out outliers?
Because the 91% I'm sure
would skew that number
to be such a high
average because
it's so different from, let's just say
negative 4%. For
example, Mr Chair.
>> Yes. So Mr chair members of
the committee. So I took the median
instead of the average which,
which accounts for outliers
and so those
numbers should be pretty
close to accurate.
>> Got it. Ok. Thank you Mr Chair and thank
you Doctor Hernandez. I appreciate
the the numbers. I like
numbers. So it's good that you brought them
and I appreciate it all the answers
to my very
complicated questions. So
thank you, Mr Chairman. That's all I
have.
>> Representative Jones.
Thank >> you Mr Chair and
thank you
Allegra. I,
I think I heard everybody
agree that we should revisit
this. Did, was there
a time time
frame or a
future?
>> I mean discussion, I can
do it as early as
September by the time that
I do the data,
>> I, I think
that it would be a good idea to have.
Um Secretary Aijo
as part of that panel
discussion. At that
point, I would appreciate
that.
That's important. And there's enough
information here that and we need
to have her weigh in on that or
somebody from hospitals
Hospital
Association
or I
mean,
yeah, Secretary
Army Health. That would be great.
Um There's a lot here to digest
like we've said. So,
thank you. Appreciate
it. Thank you Mr
Chair.
>> Um A couple of
things. Any else, a
couple of things I I wanted
to ask about because I it's
not just
that, that last thing on
page five that cost
to charge
ratios.
The cost to
charge ratio at
Presbyterian is
4%.
That means
they're
charging
4%. Their,
their,
their cost is 4%
of what they're charging or
their, >> their,
excuse me, I'm sorry the other >> way
around or is
it the other way around? So
>> they are so for
every dollar
that they charge
it costs four
cents
is my understanding from
the hospital charge
reports.
>> So that's why they're
making
and at the other
end,
Altavista has a cost.
Their costs are 300%
of what they're able to
charge.
>> And part of that might also be
bad. Billing is just not
following up with clients
after
they've had labor and delivery
services. Um
But like I told
Representative
Hernden or
Chavez
Herndon, um
we aren't 100% clear
on why that's occurring.
>> We were these
uh
on your appendix
C page
eight were these
net
income figures
available to us when we were
debating SB 17,
>> we did have them at
the time. Yes, the
C did
>> because the picture that was
painted for us was of
hospitals that were, that,
this was a generalized
concern that our
hospitals are losing
money. We
were in bad shape.
We've got to do something or
else we're gonna lose hospitals.
They're gonna be
closing.
These do not show that
picture. I mean, if
this, if Presbyterian
is gonna close,
that's not gonna happen based
on these days, that's the
worst case scenario.
They lost 100 and $39
million. No
way.
I don't know why this is showing
them to have a net income
of minus 100 and
39 but it's
not because they're losing
money.
>> So the
Presbyterian loss
can likely be explained by how
much they're sending to their home
office, home office, >> right?
So there's manipulation in
the accounting.
It doesn't mean that they're near
closing. It may mean
that their executive
leadership may take a
little bit of a, of
a reduced income
next year, but they're not
losing money.
So if every
other and in Santa Fe
Medical Center, that's the
Presbyterian in Santa Fe.
Same thing I would say
there,
Rehobeth clearly a
mess. Now,
why is that on that chart?
Why is that 5.7
million in the red under other
state appropriations? I thought
that was extra money we were giving
them. >> It is. I apologize. It
should be black and I
apologize. That's my
error. >> So
we, so George got them
an extra besides
this, George got them extra money,
didn't he? >> Yes.
>> So that's not even
reflected on >> this. The
5.7. Is that
extra five? >> That's all they
got was I thought he got him another
19 or something.
Ok. That's what George
got him. Ok.
Um So
really who's losing
money now?
Other than Rehoboth, which is
clearly a mess
are the or is
Union lost half a
million Artesia
lost three
Roosevelt lost
200,000,
250,000.
Dan Trigg lost
210
miners. The state hospital,
the government hospital lost
400,000. They
also get a land grant,
permanent fund allocation,
not a concern of
ours.
Really
and Sibila last a minute and a half.
So maybe San Juan
Regional was the big loser.
Is that
the same thing going on there with them
as goes on with Presbyterian?
>> So our understanding
is that it is not, I
haven't dug as
much into that cost report as
Presbyterian because Presbyterians
was so jarring.
Um But
I think that for the most
part, the
other hospitals that are reported
here, it's not
neces and I can't say
definitively because I haven't
fully digged into the hospital
reports. But
these are probably more
likely
mismanagement and
actual loss
of profitability as
compared to the Presbyterian
situation, which
is an accounting and
then I would like to clarify.
I was mistaken.
Um reho will
receive additional funds
for fiscal year 25 that were
not included in this table.
>> So that was the extra. How
much was that
Ruby
>> Mr
Chairman?
Yeah.
Yeah.
>> 16.
It, it,
it was, I think George was
trying to make them whole,
that's what he did with the one
time
allocation
that no other hospital would have had
access to.
But
so then, but,
but then with your point is
a good one that SB
17 is not gonna save.
Rehoboth George is gonna have to
save him every year at
the rate they're
going
because they SV 17
is only gonna generate about 6.5
million for them and they're
losing three times
that. >> And in
contrast, I would like to point out
Eastern New Mexico
Medical Center, which I discussed
when I was doing my
report. But
so their
profitability was 79
million last year
and they will be receiving an
approximate 37
additional million in funds
from SB 17
based on my, based on
my projections. >> Who is
that? >> This is Eastern New
Mexico Medical Centers the
last
slide.
>> So, so you've made a correction
in that. >> No,
sir. What I was just pointing out
is that
Eastern will
be
Eastern is a highly profitable
hospital and they'll be getting
more money from SB 17
than a hospital that is >> struggling like
is Eastern so
profitable
that I >> don't >> know. I mean,
are they owned by a big
corporation?
>> I am not sure. I
know that they're for profit. I would
have to look,
>> they make, they make 80 million
a year. We've now
built up that,
that, that
tragic loss of $80
million profit with another
37 million.
So next year they'll make 100
and 17 or
>> if their profit release stays on
track.
>> So I, I
just have to say
my and this
is for the next time we come with
updated 23
figures. And with
Troy Clark here arguing
the opposite.
This,
this is not a hospital
situation that's
dire that
we have now put another
billion and a half in or a
billion
one
into.
But that wasn't the picture that we were
given at the legislator. At least
I, that's not the way I remembered
it. It was like my God, if
we don't take this step,
they're gonna be closing right and
left.
Now you do. You
try to make the best out of this
situation by saying, this
gives us a great opportunity
to find
greater
accountability,
right?
Except
that
we spend 10
billion a year
on Medicaid
where we have total
accountability. We can, we can
impose incredible and we never
do.
So that, that my
confidence that the same
organization that makes the
MC Os toe the line
so well, is not gonna
make the hospitals toe
the line any better
because we don't have the accountants
and the lawyers
and the
incredible
sophistication
of that. The for
profits do
or the major
nonprofits do. We can't
compete.
We're, we're, it's like
asking
who was, who
was,
what was his name? The, the, the,
the, the deputy
sheriff that was given one bullet
on what
Barney Fye. It's like
asking Barney Fye
to police the mafia, you
know, I mean, come on,
this is not gonna
happen.
>> I
>> do.
Yes, representative,
>> thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you again,
Allegra. I
was just looking at memorial
Medical Center who made
a profit or, you know, had
their net income of 30
million and then
we
allocated 47
million, which is a
lot more than what they
got. But then my question
is, how are they considered
a nonprofit
when they're owned by an equity
firm Lifepoint?
>> Um, so
this, that
I'm not sure about, I'll
get you, um,
an answer back.
But I know
that
when
we looked they were designated
as a 501 C
three.
>> Ok. Um Mr Chair, I
just like, it's no
wonder all these equity
firms are coming in and buying
up our hospitals.
So there,
there's money there just
for our government
and
um,
to federal and
state,
um,
to just let them suck
it up. So anyway,
I think
we have other things that we need
to be spending this money on
except for the hospitals
that really do need the,
the help. Thank you, Mr
>> Chair. No, it is three
quarters federal money. So
there, there's always that theory that
anything you can do to
attract federal dollars
is, is money in our
state's pockets. But I think
most of this money is going to go
back out to the
east coast or wherever
the administrative
headquarters are. >> So
there is, I'll have to
go back and review SB
17. There
is a majority portion
that has to stay in the
state.
A
>> Yeah,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. I, you
know, II I have
a real problem with that too because even
though that language is in the mi is
in the bill,
I if you, if you
help somebody pay their
bill, they're still gonna
send their money out. So the
money isn't really staying in the
state.
That's how I see
it.
>> Thank
you.
So, so
I'm told that there's a
number of controls on how
the, this, this SB
17 money can be spent.
It has to be spent
75% needs to
be spent in state
and it can't be used to PD
profits.
Yeah, that's true. But
how are we gonna police that? I mean,
Barney Fife is not going to be
able to keep up
really?
You know, I,
I,
the other thing I wanted to ask
about is we had a
previous
state funded effort of
bailing out the hospitals.
Did that go away our other
bill or, or where the
counties kick in 12.5%
of their uh uh
fund, the Sustainability
fund or the survivability
fund, whatever you call
that
>> I can't, >> didn't
go away. That's still
>> know
if
>> you know the, the,
the, the, the fund that we
created about seven or eight years
ago, that takes
the, the,
the
Indigent Fund money from the
counties
12.5%.
The counties put in
12.5% and
the state
pays out
to the hospitals a
direct cash
of support for
their work that didn't go
away.
Right.
Um
That
ok.
Now,
and those dollars
aren't shown up on the chart
either. So that
when you up, when you
update Allegra, if you could add
in those dollars, I think it
was called the Hospital
Sustainability Fund
or Survivability
Fund. I can't keep
up with the nomen.
Well,
no, my memory is faded
so I can't
remember
>> just a adds one
follow up question to something that you
raised and it was
about the 4%.
Uh
it was about the 4%.
Um I'm looking here on
page five where you
say the cost to charge ratio at
Presbyterian is
4% meaning
it's making a 9%
profit on labor and
delivery services. And so
my question is how could
that possibly be? They
deliver so many babies?
And we've been hearing
how delivering
babies causes hospitals
to lose money.
>> So this is what
they're charging. This isn't
what they're getting back
from
Medicaid.
And so I don't know exactly
how much they're
receiving,
but this is what they're charging.
I've also been told that labor and
delivery loses
money
for some hospitals. That is
the case and especially the way
that they're charging.
I don't know
for certain about
Presbyterian.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chair,
>> Mr Chair. Just really quickly on that
point.
Got it. Thanks
Mr Chairman
Representative. And just
to add on a little
bit to your question, you just
asked about OBG
for Medicaid.
So for Fy
24 we,
the state of New, we,
the legislature raised
the rates for Ob
Gyn up to 120%
of Medicare. And
that's a little weird construct
because Medicare doesn't relate.
But it's, we did
regional comparisons.
So we say Medicare. But for
OBG, it's technically
regional and then
for Fy 25
which you all just approved. Now,
in January, we raised
those up to 100 and
50%. So I
just wanted to add
that to jog your
memory on that as you were asking
your question about Ob Gy and
Medicaid where we are with the
rates. Thank
you,
>> Representative
Lord. Your
floor is
yours.
But the MKE needs to be
on.
>> I was just gonna press buttons until
it eventually
worked.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I,
I agree with you. It, it's,
it's frustrating because I'm looking
at these numbers
and I'm looking,
some are in a loss, big
loss and they're nonprofit.
Some are in a loss, they're for profit.
Some are in a loss or
government, I
guess what? I, I
don't know how to put this but
it's almost like I feel like we should
pick a model that's making a
profit and works and figure
that out. Because can you explain
to me like, why are some
making such a great profit
and others are not?
Is it their billing?
Is it they're billing more than
others? Can you compare apples
to apples and tell me is
one hospital billing the same or
as another? Why are some more successful
and some are losing?
>> So,
um taking
out the case of Presbyterian
because that's more accounting than
it is profitability.
Um What
I will say is that
um if
you look, it's a
myriad of things, it's
management, it's
billing, it's
how many people are going.
It's if they have
Medicaid
um or if
they're private
fee clients or
what's happening. And
so I can't specifically
say to each hospital, this is
why this hospital isn't profitable.
This is why this hospital is
profitable. I will
say that investor owned
hospitals based on my
analysis or for profit,
excuse me, are
generally doing the
best, but
that isn't always the
case.
Um but they are
generally the
most successful out of any of
the hospitals,
but also how
profitable should nonprofit
or government hospitals be.
And that's a question for you
all. >> Well, I
think insurance costs
overall are ridiculous
because they're extremely high and
high copays. But
that's not for me to decide here.
What I'm trying to figure out is
when a hospital comes
to ask us for help and we
want to help, right? We don't want our hospitals
to close up. We
want to make sure that
if you're saying management is
a component,
then it's
difficult for us to want to throw
money at something when the management
is the issue, right?
So I I need
more data to understand
when somebody's coming and saying we need X
amount of dollars or we're going to close up
immediately based on
what based on what
factor, I
also know that we do take a lot of
Medicaid in this state. So I would
love to see a breakdown of
when you do this next time.
Will you show me
these,
this
one particular hospital is
60% Medicaid.
They're billing here getting a payback
of this because that actually does
make a difference when you're trying to
run a business,
which is why a lot of doctors
are not wanting to take the Medicaid
because it's so hard to get reimbursed
on. And then if you're showing
me another hospital that this
is a private hospital, they
take this type of insurance
or not taking as many Medicaid,
they're making more profit when
we can't go on either
one, right? We can't go on one
that's solely more
Medicaid and we need more
balance in what we're looking at when
we're trying to get reimbursement.
But I did, we did get a
text John did he just
showed me this. Loveless
says that they have no idea where you
guys got those numbers.
And they also stated
that they
said the pro was not anywhere close
to those numbers.
And also the reference of private
equity on hospitals misleading
that the loveless parent company is
announced two weeks ago, they're going public
if the state doesn't block it.
So where
did you get those numbers of loveless
as saying that those aren't correct. So
>> we got these from their
hospital cost reports
which they report to C
MS
and are
held under perjury
if they lie. So that's
where these numbers are given. >> Ok.
So that, so they have
to, there's a mandate that
mandates
them to regulars
that to mandate the
mandate to put those numbers out. Is that
correct? Ok.
So they make an announcement,
they say we made X
do. They also put, we lost
X. So all
these numbers are coming from
>> the hospital cost report which
how iive profitability
is, how much they charged, how much they
lost, how much they
said that their total profitability
was for the year. >> And then
the last thing I have again,
it's like half the time I'm sitting here, it's
like I need more data.
You know, we just, we're in the
crimes and criminal justice. We're trying
to fix the behavioral health issue
in like what two
hours and you
can't do that, you know it
takes a lot more time than it takes the
entire summer to try to
figure out those issues. So
for me, I'd like to see some
more breakdowns of stuff. So I can
try to figure out
if you're saying the components
are the
management.
I'd like to see what you mean by
the management, how they're running
things. I need to,
I need you to define that more for
me. >> So I do
want to be clear that it's not necessarily
management. That is one
component.
I think Rehobeth
is a good example of mess
management.
Um and that
they now have a new director
who has kind
of turned things around and I'm really
interested to see what 2023
hospital cost reports
demonstrate.
Um but it can
be a lot of things and
it's, it's hard
to tell from these cost reports
what the cause is.
I can demonstrate the
numbers, but I can't say
definitively it was
poor management or
it was because they didn't bill enough
for what was
happening.
And so yes,
>> and I understand that you're presenting the
numbers, but then it comes to
frustration of
why is it this one hospital
is repeatedly
not being able to make a profitt
and come in and ask for money. Why other
ones are not? So anyways, that's all I want
to say. Thank you for giving me
time
>> is Eastern New Mexico
Medical Center in
Roswell.
Mm
That's where it
is. So
it's not surprising that that would
be an incredibly
profitable. I mean,
that's a very prosperous
community.
Probably they have
AAA relative
to some of the other hospitals on the
list. They have
a, I would imagine a low
percentage of Medicaid
compared to the other
hospitals
and probably a high percentage
of, of, of people
who just pay their own right
to check out and pay the bill when
they have surgery or whatever.
So that, that may
explain that
location, I think is what
I was getting
at.
If you're located in a tiny
community with very few people
coming in, it's gonna be no matter
how well managed you are,
you're not gonna be profitable
whether you're nonprofit
for-profit governmental.
And conversely, if you're in
Albuquerque,
although Presbyterian
manages it, it's gonna
be hard to lose
money
because they're so, so big, you
know. So I think,
you know, location, location,
location is one of the big issues
on profitability, just
the nature of the community you're
located in.
Um I had one last
question for you, uh Allegra
in your conversations and
we'll have to, we'll have to get into
this in the follow up
in your conversations
with the
health care authority.
People.
Are they hiring additional
staff to,
to
track this, to work on
this or they gonna try to
do it with their same
tired
forces that have, you
know, that have already been beaten
down by the, by
the previous
battles. >> I'm
not sure about that. I will ask
Eric Chenier and I will get back to
you because >> it seems to me that
this is a big enough deal
that they, they might want to
consider just,
you know, recruiting
some new
enforcers.
One last question from
Representative Lord.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I'll just make a
scene over here. So when you give
us a number, like if I rented
out this space and said I had a business
and I make $20,000
profit. But actually
I my overhead, my
costs are 19. Is that
included in this? Are you showing
me the overhead? And can you show me where
the overhead is taken out?
>> I am including the
overhead. I
will have to,
they're in Excel spreadsheets
so I'll have to get them to
you. They
aren't in here just
because I was including so
much information that I didn't
want to overwhelm.
But I do include
things like overhead and things that they
say that they lost and >> the
physicians cost
to hire physicians and all that stuff is
included in that when you're
giving us a profit numbers
because are you taking, they
spend this much money to hire
doctors and then this
is their actual profit
after everything is said and done
costs for everything.
Ok.
>> One last thing um
the hospital, uh
people here
are saying your
numbers are out of whack and
you don't take into account
everything that uh
certain costs
aren't backed out.
Makes profitability. Look out
of whack. I
would love if you could get
together with Mr Clark
and the hospital association
people. So that when
we have the follow
up session on this,
this is very, this is
very interesting, very helpful
information we have the
follow up. It would be great
if we could, at least
we'll be talking about apples
and apples. So >> I will
say we had a meeting with the
Hospital Association
back in September or October
prior to um
them proposing SB
17. And we asked
for their data
in terms of what hospital
profitability looked like and they
were unwilling to share it at the
time, which is why
we use the hospital cost
reports. So
these are as close as I can get to
their numbers because we
were not given their
numbers. >> Well, let's
try again. They may
be more motivated. Now,
their lobbyists are very active
people and they're, they're working
hard on us.
>> Ok. Thank >> you. Thank
you
next.
Moving right
along
and almost on
schedule, we're very
close to being on schedule. This is
incredible.
Uh
LFC report. We're a little
ahead of schedule. Actually,
if you want to speak real slowly,
that's ok because we're ahead of
schedule. Rub
an Esquivel principal
analyst talking about
physical and behavioral
health workforce in the
state LFC
report. >> Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Thanks Andrea Andres handing out
your report. That looks like
this. And
uh Mr Chairman, before I
delve into the talking
points on the report, I
just wanted to follow up on the
question you asked me before about
the percentage or the funding
for Medicaid going for hospitals
and sho them up. So
that's, um, now
it's like I said, the program
has morphed a few different
times because we were running up
against d
federal
pushback basically.
So now with that,
it's supplemental direct the
payment, it's based on the average
commercial rate. So you'll hear
people say ac r
the average commercial rate, which will
help all the hospitals
because they'll, they're
basically getting um
an increase in the rate
based on the average commercial rate.
But even though it helps
them all, you still have the issue with
volume with the small rural
hospitals. So their
volume will never be the same
as the large hospitals,
the larger hospitals particularly who
are having um
inpatient and all of those
kinds of things that really
drive up their, um
that's where they get their revenues
from Medicare inpatient
a lot. And so
the volume right there is,
is always an issue. So
I just wanted to clarify that from
the answer I'd given you earlier,
Mr Chairman. Thank
you. And with
that, >> but the point is we
still have a separate
yes
and revenue
source for the hospitals is not
reported on this.
>> Yes, that's correct, Mr
Yes. And
then you have, you
know, the other part, you have
county in most
of those usually go for transport.
Most counties use it there
and there's any number of
different revenue sources
that can go. But yeah, that's
correct, Mr Chair.
All righty. Um to
begin now on this
um physical health and
behavioral health workforce and you're
gonna hear more about this
tomorrow from the UN M
folks as well. And, and we
had um uh
collaborated
together with
UN M to pull together
some of their data, which is included
here. And I think they'll speak
more to that tomorrow.
So I won't spend a ton of time
on that. But I did also
want to give uh credit and
a shout out to the
team at LFC. A lot of
people helped contribute
to this report to pull all the
data that's included here
in the background. So,
Doctor Hernandez, who you just heard
from, but also
uh a
bunch of folks, Erics Rachel
Garcia, um my,
a bunch of folks, I just want to
give credit where credit is due. So
this was a team effort.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
So I'm just gonna go through the
sections and I'll kind of call
them out as I'm going through them
that has the headings here,
um you know, background,
etcetera. So as I'm
talking through the report, I'll
call through the sections
out and that way you can kind of follow
where I'm, where I'm
at. So first
off Mr Chairman members of the
committee. Again, my name is
Ruby and Equival. I'm
LSC analyst.
So regarding
background, so New
Mexico faces
ongoing challenges in
ensuring high quality health
care is accessible
for all New Mexicans.
So that might be something you're gonna
start hearing a
lot. I mean, you all hear it all
the time in this committee,
we can put money
into programs and you will
see we've been putting, we
the legis you all the legislature
have been putting a lot of money,
particularly the last few
years to support
multiple programs,
multiple pronged efforts,
which we know that's what we need to
do. But money
alone doesn't fix these
problems. It doesn't
ensure quality
outcomes and it doesn't
ensure accessibility.
We all know that we're, we're having
to wait long periods of time.
All of us doesn't matter if you're
Medicaid, Medicare who
your insurance payer is.
We're all having to wait to get
access to care. So
that's something that we're really trying
to look at and get data
to really
determine how we're
doing in terms of quality
outcomes and accessibility
to care. So we know
that our state has
particular challenges with
access. So
counties in New Mexico
need health care workers
more than any other
occupational field.
And if you look at this
chart right here on the first
page shows you that's
the number one area,
health care. All the little
dark spots
based on data
collected throughout
2023.
Almost 85%
of New Mexico's counties.
28 out of 33
listed health care workers
as their number one
occupational need.
Additionally, according to
the New Mexico Workforce
Solutions Department,
the worst labor shortage in the
state is health care workers
with a particularly strong
need for nurses.
And according to the Workforce
Solutions Department, between
2020 through
2030
New Mexico will need an
additional
16.7%
of health care workers.
And by 2036
New Mexico will need an
additional 28%
of behavioral health care
workers. And this is based
on data from the health, the
Federal Health Resources
Services Administration.
And we just used an
acronym before you all
this, this is a health committee but
just before you heard to say C
MS for those
maybe in the excuse me,
Mr Chairman in the audience that who
maybe don't know that are listening.
That's the Federal Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid
Services. So when you
hear that term, it's the
fed.
So um
HSA the Federal Health
Resources Service Administration
reports that mental health
provider shortage is
impacting people
in communities throughout
the country.
So with New
Mexico, South
Dakota, Wyoming,
Montana and Indiana
facing the most severe
shortages.
So we are one of the
top five states facing
short shortages across the
country. New
Mexico has 19
designated geographic
Mental health search mental
health shortage areas
covering 28 counties.
Approximately
845,000
residents are underserved
or about 40%
of the state's population.
So that's the
background and I think
this is nothing you all
haven't heard and aren't aware of
in, in your own lives and with your
constituents and yourselves,
your family
members.
Now regarding
issues
related to
health care shortages
being national
national data show that
shortages of physical
health and behavioral health
providers, as I
said, are an issue across the country,
particularly in
rural areas.
The association of medical
colleges estimates a
shortage of primary
care providers of
between
260,400
across the country.
By the year
2036
many states including
New Mexico
are employing strategies to
try to address provider
shortages including
all that. You were just talking about
earlier loan forgiveness,
issuance, loan, issuance
and assistance programs,
malpractice reforms,
scope of practice
modifications. That's what >> you
were. We did not talk
about malpractice and we
will not talk
about.
>> Well, that's your call, Mr J.
So, ok,
but you were earlier when
we had Mr
Chair, when you had RLD
here, like you were alluding
to the the scope of practice
modifications. Basically
that not just the
turnover in times you get your,
it's regarding
scope of practice when you have
equivalent scope of practices
across states.
That's where the compacts come
into play when you have
reciprocity. And the
reciprocity can only occur
when your scope of practice, your
legal scope of practice is
similar. So that's where we start running
up against those hurdles.
OK. Telemedicine
parity um
and mobile clinics. So
those are, those are some
of the areas. And
also the thing that I
mentioned earlier, provider
reimbursement increases.
So that's when we hear about all the
time wages, provider
reimbursement increases.
OK? And then um Mr
Chairman, an important thing
is on the
sidebar here
on the first page
funding funding
ceremony. This funding
a summary.
Um So
I wanted to let you know
this information, this is a
report that of course the
LFC. So funding, funding
funding. So the Health
Care Authority formally the Human
Services Department as of
yesterday reports
for all the Behavioral Health
Collaborative agencies,
their fy 25
operating budgets total
$1.2
billion.
Nursing, nonrecurring
appropriations for faculty
endowments and financial
aid for Fy 23
totaled 59
million. The higher
education faculty
endowment totaled 50
million and the
Social Work endowment
totaled 80
million
Medicaid Behavioral
Health totaled 100 and
72 million in Fy
25. That's just
100% from the general
fund. And
then in the Medicaid
program, graduate med
medical education
was over 5 million
in general fund, which then leverages
the federal funds.
So, uh and then
lastly loan forgiveness
programs total
near 15 million for
fy 25. So
when you add all of that up, you
know, we're approaching $2
billion and then the leveraging
of the federal dollars. So there's
been a substantial
investment
in a, a multiple set of
programs from higher
education to
Medicaid to the
hospitals that you've just heard
the bills that we've passed
across multiple
areas to
support the
programs. And
I want to talk Mr Chairman next
a little bit more about New
Mexico's loan
forgiveness
programs.
And you'll see the paragraph
on page two of your
report.
Data provided by the
New Mexico's Higher
Education Department.
Demonstrates that loan
forgiveness for health care
workers increased
substantially since
fiscal year 21
in fy 21
100 and 44 individuals
within the health care field
requested loan forgiveness
and 22 individuals
received an award averaging
25,000. You heard
Dr Harrison speak about that
this morning,
the average award amount
remained the same for fy
24 with
1122
individuals applying for loan
forgiveness and
701
granted awards.
This growth indicates
that at the very least more
individuals are learning about the
loan forgiveness program.
However, it is
unclear from the data
at this time if the program is
achieving its desired
outcomes of
recruiting and retaining
healthcare workers in the
state. More data
is necessary to
understand if this program
which cost the state
14.6 million
in fiscal year 24
if it is indeed successful
in recruiting and
retaining these professionals,
but we have made a substantial,
substantial investment
and increased the
number of people participating.
So that's good news
regarding health care,
labor force production
and needs. Mr
Chairman New
Mexico Universities have
on average 3000
individuals enrolled in
classes focused on health
care. This
includes anyone in a nursing
program or social work program
and that's master's degree for
the social work. Even
if every student were to
graduate and seek employment
in New Mexico in
the health care field, there
is still a shortage of
approximately 2000
workers within the healthcare
and social assistance
fields to
address these issues. The
legislature appropriated
$50 million
to the higher education
department for faculty
endowments, 59
million for the nursing faculty
endowments and financial
aid and 80 million for
social work
endowments.
Additionally, higher
education institutions
reported graduating
1142
nurses in 2023.
Down
5.5%
from the 1209
reported in
2022
and down 14%
from the
1328
reported in
2019.
Additionally,
applications for nursing
fell by 6%
year over year and
are down 19%
over the past five
years. So that's an
inverse graph.
Mr Chairman, you
have funding
going this way
and you have applicants
and graduates going this
way. So that's
not what we want to see
happening.
Additionally,
nursing budgets
nu- nursing program budgets
have grown 72%
over the past five years. And
nursing program faculty
have increased
29%
higher education institutions,
enrollment in master's level
social work programs fell
8.4% from
2022 to
2023 but
they are up 1.1%
over the past five years.
Applications for master's
level social work program
fell 18%
between 2022 and
2023
and are down 13%
over the past five
years. Spending on
social work programs increased
to 29%
between Fy 19
and Fy 23.
Again, another inverse
relationship
over the past three years,
the legislature has
appropriated 80
million for social work endowments
for faculty and financial
aid at a relatively
conservative assumption of
a 4% return
return on investment. The
endowments would provide
3.2 million annually
for social work programs
equivalent to a 44%
increase on the combined
total 7.2
million social work program
spending in fy
23
social work program
budgets increase by
13% from
Fy 22 to Fy
23 and are at
29%
overall from Fy
19 to Fy
23. So I
think what this is all
demonstrating to,
you know, we throw out so much data and
so many. Um
it's again, the point I was making at
the beginning, Mr Chairman that the
legislature is making
an investment,
substantial
investment in all of these
programs. And we are seeing
the faculty growing
and the
loan forgiveness, the endowments
growing. Um We
are seeing though that the nurse
that graduates
and the applicants are
somewhat declining and
that can be again, a number
of issues, you know, we
have, we know we have declining
population in the state
and we know that we have
uh population migration.
A lot of younger people are
moving outside of the state,
any number of things, maybe, you know,
not being directed through
uh middle school and high
school to allied health fields,
etcetera, it can be any number
of things. So we have to continue
to work to build that
interest and get the student
and graduate the students.
But um we certainly are
as a legislature uh
doing the investments
and could it be more? Sure.
I think we could always do more, but
you have to look at the data here
and we're seeing this inverse
relationship. So we did want to point
that out to the, to the
committee
next Mr chairman
and then the, basically
the data I just gave you was shown on
this graph here on
page
three where I was just
breaking out the different component
pieces then we move into
Medicaid. So this is
covering a lot of different areas in
this report. But then we move into
the Medicaid pieces.
Um And Mr
Chairman, I wanna
initially say um
as a,
as a senator or
representative Lord had mentioned
uh data, you
know, data, data, data and
we we struggled
to get data also and to
get data in
sufficient
detail and broken out
to sufficient degree,
particularly in Medicaid, all of these
areas. Um so that
we can analyze
the data and pull from it. So
we have some initial data
here on Medicaid and we're, we're
doing requests to
try and get more data. So
we're um we're
appreciative of the collaboration
from the health care authority
to uh to work on
getting even more detailed data.
So we can break out really
where the providers are.
How many
uh New Mexicans are they actually
seeing? What does the access
really look like?
Uh So that's what we're trying
to dig into further. This
is the beginning of that.
OK. So Medicaid
um managed care organizations,
MC O Provider
Network Adequacy.
So Medicaid data indicates
all the contracted NC
OS have increased the size
of their provider
networks.
But the MC O
provider network increases
are not equal and
not at the same pace as the
increase in Medicaid enrollment
from 2019 to
2023. And
again, this data is
not up to date, none of this
state. It's always usually at least
a two year leg because
that's the reporting to the
feds to C MS. And
this, the data, the data
that we get is always lagging because
we allow 18 months for
claims run out in Medicaid.
So you just as a matter of
course, for those rules, it, the
data will always be dated probably
at least two years.
So it's not reflecting
turquoise care or anything that's
starting up now, just want to be clear
about that. So it's
the old MC
OS. The growth
in the provider networks for
Medicaid recipients
uh was driven by increases
in Western Sky community
care networks. The new
the newest MC O that had come
on with centennial
care. The data
on page four
indicate as Medicaid
enrollment grew between
2019 through 22
2022. So during the
pandemic when we couldn't dis enroll
anybody. The
growth in the number of Medicaid
physical health and behavioral health
providers trended
downwards with an
uptick in 2023
both the numbers of physical
health and behavioral health Medicaid
providers and the per capita
numbers of physical health
and behavioral health Medicaid
providers trended
downwards as Medicaid
enrollment grew from
2022
2020 through
2022.
In the graphs on page
five, the Medicaid
National provider
identification numbers
MP I data
shows Western Sky
Community Care which
started a centennial care
contract with the Human
Services Department in
2019. That
Western Sky increased
their network. More than Blue Cross, Blue
Shield and Presbyterian Health Plan
for both physical health and
behavioral health providers.
Approximately one third
of the providers overlapped
of them. They overlapped
providers and these health
care providers were present in all
three MC O networks. So
there is a lot of
duplication, you know, cross
cross fertilization if you
will
and we have limited providers.
So they're tapping the same
providers.
The table on page
six depicts
that in the, the Medicaid
Provider Network,
many specialties
showed an increase from
2019 to
2023.
Some specialties such
as nurse practitioners,
physician assistants, internal
medicine, family medicine
and obstetrics, gynecology.
Ob GYN showed
large increases,
other specialties such
as pediatrics, emergency
medicine, dermatology
and midwifery showed modest
increases and mixed
results in the year over year
trend. However,
even though some specialties
showed substantial increases year
over year, the Medicaid
Provider Network's number of
providers and at any given
specialty still was
not fully adequate to
serve the growing Medi
Medicaid population
during this time during
COVID and
provider appropriate per
capita access to
care in
both urban and rural
areas was not
sufficient.
Additionally, on page six,
for behavioral health providers
in the Medicaid Provider Network
between 2019 and
2021 there
were increases
in counselors, social
workers, nurse practitioners
and marriage and family
therapist. There
were small increases for
psychologists, psychiatry
and neurology providers.
These increases though
seem to stagnate in
2022 and
2023.
So that gives you a
look at the Medicaid
networks. We
had the numbers
growing, we
had the networks growing some,
but there was overlap duplication
but it wasn't ever enough
to meet the per capita
numbers. So we
knew we always had a lag
there. So,
and then uh Mr chairman,
members of the committee, all of these
graphs
um starting
on page six
and continuing on
are from the UN
M Healthcare Workforce
Committee. Um You
so I'll speak
a little bit to that. I'm not gonna go
a ton into that because I think you're gonna hear
more about that tomorrow.
So, um but we did want to
include some of the
graphs and some of the information
from that report.
Um So
um on pages
seven through nine,
there's data from,
as I said, the UN M healthcare
workforce committees
2023
annual report on
county level shortages
of primary care
physicians,
nurses,
Ob GYNs
and psychiatrists.
So you can look at each of
these, we've broken them out for all of those
areas and you can look at your
own um
districts and
sort of see where you fall and
you can see most of these
are, are
difficult, they're having
difficulties in all these areas. You
see a lot of yellows and reds and
all of these, all of these
um different graphs
here on those pages seven through
nine. And then
Mr Chairman, we did
include um the
recommendations that
were in the 2023
report from the UN
M Health
Committee and those
are provided for the committee
on page eight
and page
nine.
I don't know that I'll read through all of these.
I think you all can do that and read
through these and there's
a number of recommendations that I think
you've heard multiples
of these before.
And uh I, I want
to just additionally say Mr
Chairman that we also in this
report provide
appendices
and the appendices provide
more data on the
loan forgiveness repayment
program costs
nonrecurring
nursing and
social work
appropriations.
The percent of individuals
awarded loan repayments
by healthcare profession
between Fy 21
through Fy 24.
A heat map of New
Mexico prescribing
behavioral health providers
by county as of
December 2023.
A county map of Medicaid
comprehensive community
support services providers
actively billing in
calendar year
2023.
And the county map of the
breakdown of New Mexico
Medicaid license,
alcohol and drug
abuse counselor providers,
latex uh
providers. So
that data is provided in your
appendices. We kind of tried to take
a shot snapshot
of different types
of data, different types of,
of appropriations and
funding and provided
that all for you here in the
appendices
and um
Mr Chairman and members
of the committee. In
summary, um
much financial support
has been appropriated by the
legislature to address
the recruitment and retention
of the health care workforce in New
Mexico. However,
the results and outcomes
are definitely
mixed
and while still lacking
data regarding if real
sustainable improvements
to access to health
care are actually being
realized, that is what we
need to look at and that's what we need
to really see. Are we
getting a return on
investment
in all these areas?
So, um with
that, Mr Chairman, I can
stand for questions.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Ruben.
Members of the committee.
Questions.
Anybody have questions for
Ruben? Yes,
Representative
Lujan,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you for such a thorough
report. And
you know, this
is
so that's what we're trying to, to figure
out and fix in our state. I think this
is a, this gives us some
good insight and good
information. Um
One of the things I
think and you zeroed in on this
and so did so
did I on page five
of your report, you, you're
reporting on the specialties,
especially such as nurse practitioners,
physician assistants,
internal medicine,
family medicine, and
ob obs obstetrics
and gynecology showed large
increases. Is that due
to the, the way we've,
we've um
legislated
benefits for the
for our state. Does that have
anything to do with it? Is that a
factor? Mr Chair,
>> Mr Chairman
Representative Lujan, I want
to clarify this.
This is when we
say the trend
and the increase here, this
is these
specialty providers
in the Medicaid
network. So it's not
necessarily across the
state or it's like how
many of them? Because we're such a we're
actually 42%
now because you know, now we've been
dis enrolling as you all know
off of the Medicaid. So now we're at
about 42% of
the state's population is in
Medicaid. So we always
want to look at Medicaid data
because we're such a heavy Medicaid
state. So about
80%
of all of our births
because we've talked a lot about OBJ
here. About 80 percent of our births
are paid for by Medicaid.
But the state overall, now, about
42% of
folks are enrolled in Medicaid.
So what this is saying is we're
trying to look and say, ok,
in Medicaid, what do your
networks look like? And
so that's where we were seeing
increases in specialty
care over those. This is
basically the COVID years.
But we also
saw, you have to look at the
two together. We also, of course,
we had
astronomical increases
because we couldn't dis enroll
under the federal guidelines.
So we saw a huge increase and that's
when we were pushing almost
a million people. We were,
we tapped out
at about 996,000
people on, on Medicaid.
So that was
our highest number ever in Medicaid.
So, so that's what you have
to look at is both. Yes, we increase
the networks, some,
some more than others in
specialty care. But then we also we're
increasing people. So that
doesn't necessarily still speak
to access. So we
need more data to look
at really access.
So that's why I said this is just
the first snapshot
of data we have. Thank you,
>> Mr Chairman. Thank you, Mr Chair.
I was, I was about to say that
too because you said the
data is,
you know, the comparison of the spread is
2019 and 2022
right? So, yeah, so those
are our COVID
times and that's what you're
recording here and that's what we really need
to know. But
it does tell us something
too in regards to those
numbers and the
increase in the service,
you know, again, I'll be
careful as to tying it to the
access. But by,
by these numbers, it's showing
that this is where the growth
is. Um
and those, those specialties where
we need them to be.
Uh
And,
you know, this
is,
this is important for us to take
into, into account
as we're looking at
data and information.
And now
we're gonna have to get a new set of
data now that we've
disenrolled that, that,
that part, that
population that was enrolled
during COVID time.
And then, you know, I think
what the concern is for me is
the access for that
for that. How are we going to
control, how are we going
to track that
data set when
we're looking at, you know,
the numbers? Because this is going to be your
comparison data set
to the next
18 months and
in the next five
years, if you will and what we're going
to see. So, but
we've also put in
legislation for
access, you know,
for
um
for many things across the
board. And so that's why I'm asking in
this, this data set too,
but we're not seeing that effect yet
from because those are most like
uh I think the last
two
sessions where we've
looked at um
maternal care
um and
spending there and also
with
our disabilities
and, and coverage there
as well. Those are just been
recent. So we're not see those
numbers per se in
this data set is that correct,
>> Mr Chairman Representative Lujan.
No, the increases
for the Medicaid
rates
were implemented
in the large increases,
the 120%
that was targeted for maternal
and child health, behavioral health
and primary care or
for Fy 24. And
then the
next increase
was for Fy 25 and
that was 100 and 50%
of Medicare across the
board. So yeah, those will
not be seen yet in
the data, but I
would be remiss
there have
been
targeted
rate increases in
previous fiscal years that are
reflected in this data such
as for um
PC O. So
personal care, those
sorts of things and you know, we
would have transport
and different targeted
ones, primary care
and et cetera over the years.
But, but with the
larger increases were for
Fy 24 and Fy 25
Mr >> Chairman. Thank you. Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you for that.
I think what I'm getting at
too is just that correlation
also with the numbers
and those amount of
individuals that were enrolled as
opposed to what we're going to see
now. But also,
you know, just
the access due to the
legislation that we've, we've,
we've had
and then that goes to cost because
we know the more number, the higher
numbers we have with Medicaid,
then the more benefit we get from the federal
government. Is that correct,
Mr Chair? >> That's
correct, Mr Chairman.
We do get
a good return
on a good leveraging
amount from the federal
government. So it's
almost 4 to 1. However,
we call it our FM
A our federal medical assistance
percentage. It's the, the
amount the rate that
we get. So that's
based on a
three year average.
Always it's three year average
of the states, all states
their, your economic
performance. So
our F map
has been slightly
declining over the last few years.
So the good new, so
that is that our economy is doing
better. The bad
news, the flip side is that we
get less federal dollars
for our state match for Medicaid,
but it's still substantial. It's
still a really good return on
investment. >> Yeah,
thank you. No, I really do appreciate
that. It just goes into it just a mix
of thoughts for me and I'm sure
I'll fold those with
you and talk about them as
we're talking about, you
know, our population
and the stabilization of our
population, our economy
and the growth of our economy,
which
um
we know isn't,
isn't where we
would like it to be. I'll just
say that even though
we did see a big jump
after COVID, but we knew that
would, you know, we
anticipated that in,
in, in a certain respect.
But thank you for the, the
in depth. It just leaves a lot of
questions for me because of the
subset of data that we're
looking at specifically here,
Mr Chair. Thank
you,
>> Representative block for
one, you can ask two if
you want.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you so
much. I just have one question
page seven.
Uh So I'm looking at this
graph or this
table
shows Otero
County negative
311
RNS or CN
Ss
under the benchmark. But
I see it's like over
about 2500
in Bernalillo
County
for that.
So I'm just wondering
obviously there's more people in
Berle County but
places like Don Anna County
where there's a lot of people,
it's like negative
662 people.
So I'm just wondering, do we know any
data on that? I know
we're always fishing for data.
But do we know why
many of those providers
prefer to be in
Bernalillo County area?
Because even in the surrounding
counties like Valencia,
even Sandoval, it's
negative Mr
Chair,
>> Mr Chairman.
So there's multiple
components to that
and um
Mr Chairman represent block.
So
again, it's per capita.
So that's the first thing
on this. So you have, you know your
population there. Second,
I think you will, it's
tied to employers.
So you will hear
about that tomorrow, I think
from U
and M health sciences when they come
and speak that
our models
have been changing, have been morphing
over the years. So, whereas you before,
you used to have independent
physicians, people independently
practicing, that's been
changing. Now, most
now a lot of them are
employees. So
uh of systems.
So where you have more of
the systems located
or the hospitals or the systems,
you'll have more of the
employees. So
the the hospitals and the systems
tend to be more in the urban
areas, not in the rural
areas. So that
affects it, the per capita,
the numbers, the population
affects it. And then I think just
also those
other
um
factors in
that are so important
to recruitment and retention
uh where you do
your residencies,
which because we
know we have this is where we have
our medical schools, our
schools of teaching are
in some of these places. So then
people will maybe tend to stay
there. And then additionally, it's
the quality of life factors
because you have your, your
ex your family members
and all can your
your significant other find
a job and all those,
any number of things play
into those considerations
and impact these numbers.
Ok. >> Thank you, Mr Chair. And, and on
that question. So you
said where
their providers are
located. So for
example, if I'm working at a
hospital that
is a branch of,
let's just say a big
hospital in Albuquerque,
would this graph then
say that I'm in Albuquerque
instead of where I
am. If
my hospital that I work
for is a branch of that. Is that
what I'm hearing on that Mr
Chair? Because I know, for example, in my
community, we have a
hospital that is based
in Texas.
So how does that
person get
counted,
>> Mr Chairman, if they're working
in your county, they would be counted in your
county. But some of this,
so this data is
2022.
And um so
for instance, this came up,
I think at the LFC, like the
um Mr chairman, the
Valencia County
Hospital wasn't fully
opening and functionally so
maybe wouldn't be reflected
in these numbers. So it's also the
data year and the
data.
>> OK. Thank you, Mr Chair.
And I know where we
are. We have uh
the university
here, N MS U
A. We are actually starting
a program for nursing in
our community. So I, I don't know
if we're gonna get 600 people
or 300 people to fill
that gap, but I sure hope
it helps. So
you never know. But it's really
terrifying to see every single
county in the red except for
Bern County on that
one. So if we could just tell
people come
down to Otero County, we need
you please. So whatever
we can do. So thank you, Mr Chairman.
>> Sounds great, Mr
Chairman. Come on
down,
>> representative
Lord.
>> So I was working on the commercial for
that. Come on down Otara
County.
Sorry, it's the
end of the day and I'm punchy.
Ok. So I
was looking at on
page
eight, you
come up with a whole bunch of
recommend or there's a recommendation
U and M healthcare
Workforce Committee which
look like all kinds of ideas
for bills to be drafted.
But I had a question
on number eight on
page nine
when you talk about certified
peer support specialists,
uh usually those are the type of
people with like lived experience
and whatnot. Can you explain to me the
role of the
certified peer support
specialist? What that certification
looks like?
>> Um Mr
Chairman,
Representative Lord, that's
um Doh
and HSD have been working
on this and and actually
been looking at trying
to do expanded funding
for this through Medicaid.
So I think in turquoise care, we're going to see
some support for this, but
it's been proven
to be an
effective approach
in dealing with behavioral
health that uh peer
support. And
um
I'm trying to think if it's in
Santa Fe or Albuquerque, they
have the salons
or the
living room
drop-in models and then peer
support specialists will work
there. So these are some areas
that they've been working in getting
certification and when you get
certification, you can do enhanced
funding. So that, that's
what the these
recommendations pertain to
Mr Chair.
>> Ok. Thank you Mr Chair. And
so you're saying because when
I look it up, usually it's like people
that have lived experience or
like a support system for these
people. So
they have a certification, I
guess I'll have to look up and see what that
certification looks for like
because, and this, you're
asking for
peer support workers to
provide Medicaid services.
So are they not getting
reimbursed? How, how
are they being paid right now? Are
they getting
paid for their services and who
is paying them? Are you looking to
get them where they
can build Medicaid? What is,
what is the bigger picture >> for this,
Mr Chairman,
previously, they weren't
being, the
services weren't being reimbursed
under Medicaid. And then we were
trying to do some through
the general fund, but now
we're trying to, now it's been expanded
under Medicaid and I think
they're looking to potentially
even expand it further under
turquoise care, the new Medicaid
program which starts
today.
>> All right. Thank you. That was my only question.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. These are the
last year
recommendations
and some of them were
adopted and
that's one of the ones that was. I
think so.
And tomorrow we'll hear their
recommendations for this year.
They're gonna make a report
tomorrow.
Representative
Lujan >> just really
quickly, I try to be quickly
Mr Chair in
C CJ. Last week, we
were, we had secretary
A Mio in front of us talking about
the MC OS some of the
problems and holding
them accountable for
some of the information that they're giving us
and that you know, I just would
ask like
and see here too, how are, how
are the
provider files from the
various MC OS validated to
ensure accuracy and reporting
in general?
And,
um,
and we've talked about that, I think in our, our
very first
meeting for
HHS was,
was what we can come up
with and talk about the MC OS and
some of the,
um,
the issues we have with them and some
of the, what we
wrote into to statute
as you had
um told us we
talked about and where are we
with that? So with the,
with the data and information,
what, what is the accu
accuracy of that data that we
received? >> Mr
Chairman Representative Lujan?
So questions
one through three here in this
report, they're what I would call
a little wonky and
the, you know, policy
wonk. And the reason why
we put this in is because we are trying
to just, just kind of
spur those kind of questions. And it's
because we're
struggling also to get some of this
data and information and it gets to
the question. And Senator
Rodriguez asked this question a
lot in legislative finance
committee and I'm sure you all are hearing
it from your constituents
and your providers. The
concerns about
are, are we getting
our increases? We've put
prior to Fy 24
we did put in targeted
increases, the legislature put
in targeted
rate increases for
Medicaid. And
then in Fy
24 there was a
substantial increase.
We invested
millions of dollars.
And then of course, now, fy
25 again, millions
and millions of dollars.
So these
questions are getting to one
managed care organizations.
Are you flowing that money
out to the providers?
And I think you've heard
multiple folks say there's some
concern about that and then maybe the
timeliness of that or
is it really happening? Where, where
are we at with that? And so
this is data
requests that we're trying to
do specifically here to
try and get more data from
um Medicaid
and the MC O. So we can
try and look into that and
look into the geographic
distribution of providers.
So we can look to that question more
of access, where really
our providers, are they overlapping?
Are they getting the rate increases
all that sort of thing? So,
uh we still need to get
additional data
and we're hoping that um
that will be forthcoming
and relatively shorter.
>> Thank. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you for that. I just, it's,
it's just so much inform, it's so
dense of information and
layering of, of,
of how we are
interpreting or how not
interpreting. This is a interpretation
of what you have to
work with, but
how we apply this
to, to look
at better policies where
needed.
And
it's the redundancy
that just keeps on. I think that's
the added effect, especially
around behavioral health.
We know where we know where
we are, we know where those
needs are. We know we don't have the
provider, you know,
how, how is this gonna continue
to perpetuate unless we
get some really good policies.
And Mr Chair, we did talk about in C
CJ about a piece of legislation
that's, that's looks
like it's, it's being formed and
coming uh for the
60 day session
that will help and,
and live with this and kind
of looking at where we have
the, the
regional
uh areas
and where we can grow with, with
that and that's with the S A MSA
funding that we got. Do you, can
you tell us more about that
fund uh or
that? Yeah, the federal fund
with the Samsa um
uh initiative.
>> Yeah. Uh Mr Chairman,
Representative Luhan, I believe
you're speaking about the
one point whatever million that's
going for the CCBH
CS, the Certified Community
Behavioral Health Clinics.
Um So
we are, what we're trying to do
is to expand
those, there's currently
six that are certified
in the state, there's
potentially an
additional
five for sure.
Another two that
are in the pipeline.
And so these are
certified
uh certified community
behavioral health clinics. So you
hear people say
CCBHC,
um these are a
more
extensive model
of care that has more wraparound
services. And
Sama is targeting states
particularly rural, you know,
targeting rural
areas and trying to
get additional
funding out there to help
and really be effective with behavioral
health issues. And these
provide those that whole array
of wraparound services. It has
requirements to do all of
that. And
um so New Mexico was
one of the states that did
get um they've been
doing Sams has been rolling
this out in phases. So
we're one of the set, the
next cohort of
states that got the funding.
So it's one funding
to just do the services, but
it's also technical assistance
so that they can help us do all
of that. So we're excited
about that and we're hoping
to see um
more of these come online in the
state because they're, they've been,
you know, they're proven to be
effective. And
um I think
you uh there'll be discussion
around that as I'm sure as we move
into even the special session
and, and probably the,
the 60 day as
well.
>> It, it's just all around.
Thank you so much for that.
>> And by the way, a
representative tomorrow
on our agenda is
uh the head of the
Medicaid program
will be here. So it will give
us an opportunity to ask
her uh about
some of these uh
uh
issues that require them
to take some kind of action,
find out what their plans
are.
Any other questions from the
committee?
Ok. I had
one.
and it has to do with,
it really is kind of along the same
lines because
it has to do with uh on
page two.
Um You, you make a comment
there about
um
uh the loan forgiveness
program. We
don't really know if it's
working. We
know we're spending,
we're paying out
a lot more money than we used
to and a lot more people
are getting their loans
forgiven,
but we don't know if it's
keeping people in the state
or be serving as an
attraction.
Who's, could
that be something that the LFC would
study one of its big
projects? You know,
because that would be really important
information for
us
and, and I can see a number of
ways you might do that. If
people get a loan, you need,
they need to, to make a
commitment. How
are we holding them to that
commitment? >> Yes,
Mr Chairman, we've
asked for additional
information from the higher
education department
and
we're hopeful
that they'll collaborate with us to get that
additional information. I think they're
working on compiling some of that
and I believe you're gonna have them
before you as well
on
tomorrow. So,
so that could be a question to ask
them as well. But I think
that's definitely
something that we need to
keep a focus on
and our eye on is,
you know, are they just
staying to the commitment period and
just in the location until, until
it runs out and that kind of
thing. So yeah, so we definitely need
to get additional data to look at these
programs
along with the rural practitioner
tax credit, all of these things.
We're doing so many
different, the rural health
care practitioner tax credit, so many
of these different prongs
and yet we have really kind
of limited data on what
their efficacy is.
Yeah,
>> kind of like the hospital
fund.
Yeah.
Ok. Any other
questions from anybody?
>> Ask me anything,
>> Ruben. Thank you so
much for your
presentation.
Lots of information packed
in here.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you
members of the
committee.
>> Now members, we,
we, we've run to the end of
the agenda today.
Uh I need to point
out to you that on
Wednesday.
Uh One of our presenters
will not be able to make it. She
had a death in the family
and uh the
primary care
Association
will not be making a
presentation who's
gonna do the health care providers
perspective.
>> It's like the people at
the regional.
>> Ok. So we'll
probably just move up
the proposed 11
o'clock to 10
and will be done by
before noon. Actually, it looks
like I would like to
spend a little bit of time doing
some rudimentary
brainstorming
around
what issues
look like you would like
to,
you know, bring to
real uh
fruition as
legislation in the upcoming
session based on what
we're hearing here today, if
there are things that, that
start looking like
something real important.
So let's plan on doing
that on Wednesday morning as
well. Tomorrow
is a very full day.
So if you could get here on
time, we'll hear from
the medical board,
then the higher education
department,
we'll get the UN M healthcare
workforce at 11
and in the afternoon, the
Medicaid program,
the nursing
school updates
and the hospital, nursing
updates. So lots
of information tomorrow.
Again,
any other last lingering
things?
And then is there a reception tomorrow
night, >> tomorrow night at
the Monte
>> and then tomorrow evening
not tonight, but tomorrow evening
there is a reception
at Montesa Grado at
six. So
don't keep, put that on your
very full social
calendars
and with that, we will adjourn
the meeting for today. Thank you all.
