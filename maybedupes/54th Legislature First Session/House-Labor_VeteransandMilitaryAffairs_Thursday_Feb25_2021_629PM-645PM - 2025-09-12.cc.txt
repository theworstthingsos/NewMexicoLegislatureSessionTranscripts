Thank you Mr chairman thank you
committee
the.
House bill two fourteen removes
an outdated and inequitable
exemption from the state's
minimum wage statute which
allows employers to pay a sub
minimum wage to people with
disabilities the sub minimum
wages I I late workers rights in
the bill enacts the
recommendation by the U. S.
commission on civil rights
legislative repeal sub minimum
wage laws.
And
Since the minimum wage is no
longer considered a best
practice it's already being
phased out in New Mexico and
because of COVID
we already have seen of the
closure of all of the sheltered
workshops but we there just a
few act
certificates that are still
available but they expired in
aren't used at this time.
So I'd like to introduce my
expert Mr Jim Jackson can he be
brought into the committee I
should ask for that first.
You said Jim Jackson I'm right
now thank you.
Mr Jackson yes.
Good evening Mister chair
members of the committee.
My name is Jim Jackson on
speaking today on the in support
of the Representative Ferrary is
bill and representing a
disability rights New Mexico
I I think the sponsor has laid
out the rationale for the for
this quite well I just wanted to
remind the committee to that
this provision in New Mexico law
that would be repealed by this
bill was passed about fifty
years ago in New Mexico and at
that time of course we didn't
have a laws prohibiting
discrimination against people
with disabilities
implying a door in other
contexts as well so we were in a
very different kind of
environment in those days and
today our of our laws and our
culture are much different both
with respect to people with
disabilities and to employment
as the Sanchez indicated of the
federal provisions are
essentially being it looks like
they are being phased out and
here in New Mexico
the department of health which
runs our developmental
disabilities programs has
adopted unemployment first model
that does
we have our providers look for
all to for employment
opportunities for people with
disabilities that do pay at the
at the least at the minimum wage
level in New Mexico this
provision around of certificates
allowing sub minimum wage has
never been utilized and it's an
appropriate time for us to take
it off the books so I'd be happy
to page one the sponsor and try
to respond to any questions that
you may have when that time
comes thank you Mr chair.
Thank you Mr.
For questions.
Thank you.
We'll be all I'm sorry I just
wanted to thank my co sponsors

miss you Mexico currently allows
the state's authorized workers
with disabilities to work for
significant lower than the
state's minimum wage the statue

opportunity for workers to be
discriminated against and paid

Thank you Mr and I will go to
ample time to.
Mr chairman Ellen pines
representing the disability
coalition of we stand in strong
support of this bill as the
sponsor and her experts have
pointed out this isn't out dated
provision that should not remain
on the books and more over if Mr
Guevara pointed out it's not
even Houston we shouldn't keep
statutes on the books that
aren't being used and are out of
step with current policy current
policy is that we do not
discriminate against persons
with disabilities and that we
promote integrated and
meaningful employment for
persons with disabilities this
goes against that policy and we
urge the committee to support
the bill thank you so much thank
you.
We.
Thank you Mr chair and members
