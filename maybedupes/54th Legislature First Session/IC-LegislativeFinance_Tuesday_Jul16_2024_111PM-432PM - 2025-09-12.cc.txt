Mm
>> who's leaning us off Charles
is in on Snapchat
or? Oh, we've
got a panel.
Let's see,
Mike
Doyle
can or shab. Why don't you
guys come up
and
excuse me,
Patricia
to the Patricia
from the VL A you
here,
right?
And then whoever wants to start us off?
Go right
in.
Go ahead,
Mike.
>> Good afternoon, mister
Chairman, Members
of the Committee Members of the
audience. Uh Thank you for the
opportunity to,
to speak today.
Um
So as Dr Amu
Zagar emphasized so effectively
yesterday,
New Mexico Tech is a
unique research
university in the
State. Uh
Our priorities include
uh applied research to address
societal challenges
uh as well as
uh advancing education
enrichment, workforce
development and catalyzing
the local and State
economy, some
of some of the key
focus areas and this
is just really a small sampling
of what's going on at
NMT. But some key
areas include water resources,
data management and
education,
energy technologies and
carbon capture,
advances in
biotechnology
and next generation A
I technologies and A I
security.
Uh A I security
especially being something
that uh is, is
very uh at the
top of the news these
days. Um
some highlights.
Uh we're
producing game changing
technologies across multiple
fields.
Our 2023
research expenditures
uh were 100 and
18 million,
100 and eight of that came
from non State
sources
and I'll come back to that later,
but that's a very significant uh
statistic.
We have statewide, statewide
collaborations that are
leading us to positions of
national leadership in different,
in various areas. So
how's all that possible?
Well, one reason and
um on, on the next
slide,
uh one
reason is our centers
and institutes.
Um I'm not gonna go through
each of these centers
uh uh in detail
but in the back of your
packets, uh
there's a set of one page
summaries of each of these centers
in case you'd like to dive in
uh in more detail. But
our center span
fields from material
science to geophysics,
to atmospheric and
astrophysics,
uh geology,
cybersecurity, carbon
capture spectrum
science.
I'll go through a few key
examples though uh
today.
Um uh
For example,
uh the Bureau of
Geology is doing applied
research uh
to address societal
challenges by
working towards a sustainable
water future. In New
Mexico.
This involves three main
initiatives,
aquifer map,
mapping and
monitoring
water, the water
data initiative and the water
education program.
The A for Monitoring
and mapping program
is to characterize
uh water resources
to provide for water planning.
And it's, it's uh
plays a key
role in
implementing the governor's
50 year
water Action
plan,
the Water Data Initiative
uh under the 2019
Water Data Act,
uh there's a requirement to
provide water data and make
it more accessible and usable
to the public through
interoperable
uh common
standards uh for
data. And the Bureau of
Geology is
the the key uh
uh player
in terms of making this
possible.
And I'm I'm sure all of you have
been uh exposed to
the uh water education
programs, things, events
like the Water Leaders Workshop,
which is a fantastic event
that's held every year.
Um And the idea is
there is to bring
science, water and management,
uh and local
issues on water to
legislators, staff
and State water le
leaders,
the societal impacts and
partnerships that
uh these, these activities
reach range
from the regional
through State to federal
partnerships. Uh So
regional water
conservation districts,
municipalities,
irrigation districts, uh State
agencies such
as uh OS
EISC
NMD,
Emnrd and
SLO, as well as federal
partnerships with
uh entities like the Bureau
of Reclamation us,
GSBLM
and Sandia National
Labs.
But they are also
I'm I'm on the next
slide. Now. There, there are also
significant collaborations
between uh the
centers at
NMT. So
for example, a particular
area of collaboration
is between the Bureau of
Geology and the
Petroleum uh
Recovery Research
Center. And,
and in
particular,
this, these collaborations
are focused in the area of integrating
sustainable energy
water systems.
Two major ways this is happening
include carbon storage
and produced
water.
The carbon storage project
is involves advanced
uh character is
characterization
studies uh that
provide capabilities to
do uh
regional scale
geologic mapping or
modeling uh
and, and uh
affect regulatory
impacts on citing
monitoring permitting
uh and,
and using infrastructure
for sustainability goals.
But it also
includes or involves
a multis State multidisciplinary
collaboration.
The pro produce water
uh projects uh
are specifically
focused in water technologies
focusing on water
filtration systems to
purify, produced
and brackish water
provides usable water
resources in arid
and rural environments. Uh
One of the key demonstrations
of that is that Navajo Tech,
where we've got a prototype
system that uses
uh the P double R
C's hollow fiber
filtration technology
uh uh
to purify
water in
in
smaller settings so
that you could actually deploy
these into neighborhoods
on, on tribal
lands, for example.
Um But also
it's looking at exploring
treated water for industrial
applications such as cooling
data centers, chip
manufacturing and
others.
Next
slide.
Another initiative that's going
on at P WRC that's just
starting, isn't it? Is,
is to
take the notion of
collaboration even
further the
PP WRC. This
initiative is expanding
collaboration across
disciplines with a
focus on
energy.
I've got a screenshot here
of a website that
just came up.
Um And, and
this for the creation of a
new group called the Consortium
for Energy Sustainability
and Advanced Management.
And the focus is to connect
people to foster community
engagement, education
and collaborative research
across a wide range
of energy related fields
in crucial areas such as
oil gas,
geothermal
renewables, hydrogen
carbon capture storage,
batteries, critical
minerals and, and water
management. And, and the
idea is to create a
transformative
uh community engagement
process and, and
focus on energy throughout
the State of New
Mexico.
In the next
slide
you're familiar with pli
uh and especially
uh uh with respect
to its role.
Uh That's, it's had
many for many years in
first responder training,
but there's
been in recent years,
an expanded mission
uh for the center
uh for addressing
national security
and infrastructure resilience
issues in the area
of uh electromagnetic
uh uh
domains
particular with focus
towards providing a national
resource for five
G and future G
spectrum science.
Go ahead.
What this is going going
to allow is creating a national
five G test bed
for dod training
and, and national
spectrum sharing
experiments. A future
G test bed to
support
Department of Defense War
fighter ops and training
and experimentation.
But also prof providing
a platform for informing
national spectrum issues
uh to provide
the policymakers
with uh
uh validation
of, of
uh facts necessary
to create good
policy.
It's
really
providing a proving
ground and essentially a
living lab for
dynamic spectrum management
technologies and methods
and, and as an environment
for providing
uh collaboration uh
across uh
domains all the way from
academic research
to
uh
Department of Defense
NASA
and, and even
the uh NSF
uh activities relating
to the next generation VL
A
expanding on the sub subject
to collaboration on the next slide
you'll see while there are far
too many collaborations going
on at
NMT to, to list
them all. I'm focusing on
a few highlighted
projects that are specifically
designed to expand collaboration
across the State.
And most of these
projects include
the collaborating
uh or over 10
collaborating institutions
in in each project. For example,
the New Mexico in bre
which is focused on uh
biomedical research
excellence.
Um New Mexico,
New Mexico Epsco,
which is uh
designed to
provide competitive
research uh enrichment
to allow the
State research
institutions to compete,
compete at a national
level with other states,
New Mexico Consortium,
which is uh uh
created to enhance
collaboration between
the three research universities
and Los Alamos
um as well
as uh uh uh
similar programs
for joint appointments
and, and uh
joint activities with
Sandia National
Lab.
A recent program
that I think
uh uh we talked about quite
a bit last year. Uh
Is this new program
from NSF called the NSF
Engines?
Um It's
provides uh 100
and $60 million a
year over a 10 year period
for large
region wide
collaborations to
create uh
regional innovation
hubs.
They are currently
uh
a series of, of
engines projects that
we're collaborating, which
with uh
the uh
that were uh
awarded type one
or planning grants last
year. And so they're submitting for
the full grants this year.
And that includes the rally
West uh project
from UN M
um But it has a
large number of collaborators
across the State focusing on
water resources, the Space
Valley uh
project run by the Space
Valley Coalition.
Um The pedal project
which is focused on water resources
in the Permian Basin.
Um One that's not listed here
is the Quantum engine
that, that uh is also
being submitted. And,
and we're
just had a meeting this morning
about uh seeing
what uh tech can do to
help that effort along
two new projects that
are uh are
we're in the process of putting
together that will be
submitted are, are
being led by
New Mexico Tech
um
and the Socorro area
relating to
uh the next
generation artificial
intelligence technologies
and next generation
biotechnology
systems.
But as you see on the next slide,
we're, we're even doing
research to expand the
science of collaboration
and collaborative activity
itself as part of
the Epsco uh
project.
Uh uh
The statewide office
which is now called
EOR uh
funded by,
funded by uh
NSF
uh uh
is NMT
is working to enhance the
research capacity of the
State as a whole.
And the way we're doing this is
we're creating a pilot
project uh to
create a custom A I
to support research within New
Mexico. Now, you probably
are familiar with chat GP
T and
uh uh
uh probably
tried to use it for one thing or
another. You May
have wondered
as you put information into
chap GP T what happens
to it? What's the security
of that information?
Well, this project is gonna
use those kinds of technologies
but in a secure environment
where we create
a, a
local,
secured uh uh
version of that
kind of uh
system that
is fed all of the research
information for the
campus. So
articles patents,
uh design,
uh uh documents,
uh engineering designs,
contracts, uh
funding
proposals
that can then be used
to, to
query uh what's
going on at the
campus, so we can use
it within the campus to try
and get a feel for
everything that's going on. Even on a
campus. This small,
there's a lot going on that you're,
we're not always aware of.
And with this, these
kinds of tools, we can not only
look at what has happened in the
past but make sure, make some
guesses about what might
happen in the future and whose
projects, you know, might
be able to uh meshed
together and what possible
collaborations there might
exist.
This system then becomes
part of a multi-layered
system that works with
another
uh kind of GP T
kind of system
except that
the, the private system
feeds
uh cleaned data
into the larger system
that can then be shared with the
outside world.
And the idea there
is that each campus will be
able to have their own
secure system
that that provides
confidentiality,
provides the ability to protect
IP and even even
classified
information when
necessary.
And the larger system though will
allow the consolidation
of that information
statewide and can
be used as a tool to
explore possibilities
for collaborations
across the institutions
in the State.
So the
pilot is being developed at
NMT and as soon as that's
completed, it will be rolled out
statewide as a statewide
res resource for
collaborative
activity
and that project is
underway.
Now, I mentioned the NSF
ENGINES and, and I mentioned those
two new projects uh that,
that were uh uh
leading
uh
here
and
these activities are creating
engines of innovation
across the State.
As I mentioned, this
uh NSF
Engines program if if
awarded will provide
100 and $60
million over a 10 year period
for, for each project.
And, and
uh there will
be uh
at least one or more
uh engines funded in New
Mexico. I think that's a per
fairly safe bet.
Uh in this cycle
last year, uh
there were a number
of engines awarded
and if you look at the national
map, the idea is to carpet
the nation with these projects
and there's a big hole where New
Mexico is from last
year. And so this on
this cycle, they're gonna be trying to
fill those holes across
the country. So I think the odds
of the State getting,
I think a number of engine
proposals submitted
and and awarded are are quite
high.
But we're particularly
focusing in two areas where
we have the opportunity to become
national leaders and that includes
the area of spatial biology
and next generation
A I
uh in the spatial
biology area, we'll be creating
new imaging technologies
and new computational
tools. We're
particularly pushing
this new cutting edge
field into the area of
agricultural uh
biology to
and that's where the connection is
into the economic sector, where
these technologies will dramatically
expand the possibility
for new start-ups,
new uh workforce
development programs
uh in
in the spat biology
sector. But with a particular
focus on advancing
agricultural uh
economic activity in the
State.
Um
The next generation A I
project is going
to
focus on
a, a new next
generation kind
of uh A I platform.
It's called Decentralized A
I I. If you want to talk
about it or there's more
detail in the back of
your slides, I have a
couple slides that
have more detail on these projects.
But in general, it
is the next wave
of of A I
technology. And we have the
opportunity to really take
a, a leading role here.
One of the key pillars
of this project though is looking
at the problem of
providing computational
support for
these A I uh
projects as you
know,
large A I systems
require a tremendous amount
of energy to
provide these activities.
And so one of our focuses
is gonna be looking at
coming up with sustainable
ways to provide
that technology. So we're in
the process
of of
putting together a project
that would
uh
create a, a
large solar
farm on
campus or on
just off the main
campus in, in the
land uh off
towards the
mountain
um
that would be used to
power A a
data
center that would
contain uh uh
essentially what
could be called an A I
supercomputer.
Now, this this uh
solar grid would,
would be
in the area of the scale of what's
going on, what
currently exists in Los
Lunas.
Only a small fraction
of that capacity
will be needed to support
the A I data
center.
We're working with a,
a company that's approached
us that, that has
funding to do this. We're,
we're currently looking
at uh working
out all the feasibility issues
and, and starting
into a due diligence process
in terms of planning.
But
this would provide
uh A I resources
across the State. And,
and we've already been approached,
for example, by Sandia
who, who says that this
project uh May
dramatically affect their,
their plans to enhance
uh computational capabilities
at Sandia and, and they'd like to
get involved.
Um But this,
this program
would then,
you know, focus in areas
like next generation
A I as well as A I
security
and would catalyze
the formation of a whole new
wave of start-ups.
Um And, and we'd
be deploying
uh workforce development
programs across the State
to provide,
you know, in both of these
programs uh
uh pipelines
for
uh
uh you know, New
Mexico students
to find
pathways to jobs
in these highly
uh highly paid
industries.
It will also provide that an
environment within which
to, to, you
know, and an engine to,
to generate a whole new
wave of start-ups
uh that we expect
would then uh
stay in the State
and, and when tied
together with the resources
developed under these projects,
uh would create
a, a
vibrant
technological
ecosystem for the
State. And as
I said, there's, there's more detail in
the back and if you'd like to talk
more about it, uh
just come, just pull
me aside and I can, I can give
you more details.
So what I've, what I presented
just be begins to provide
a glimpse of how New Mexico Tech
is a unique research
re research
institution unlike any
other in the State. And
I've shown how we're doing
applied research, addressing
societal changes,
enhancing the research
capacity of the State
and creating engines of
innovation
to mov'e the entire region
forward.
How how would we've been
able to accomplish all this? Well,
one of the reasons we've been able to
do this is we, we've been able to
leverage State support
uh and State investment
and, and been able to,
to do this with in a
way that has yielded over a
10 to 1
return on investment. You know, I
mentioned that
100 and $18
million of,
of uh expenditures
where, you
know, 100 and eight
of that is is from
outside the State. And,
and this has been through mechanisms
such as RP SBS and the
TEF uh but
now no
larger opportunities
are beginning to emerge
and, and uh
while the things like the TF
are a valuable tool. They're
not enough to handle these
big new opportunities.
And so we need to take a broader
view looking forward.
Uh but with that kind
of support, uh we'll
be able to do so much more
uh in the future. Thank
you.
Any questions?
>> Uh Thank, thank you very
much. Uh doctor. Do, do
we want to go through each
presentation? I think
let's go through uh our
presentations uh from
each institution
and then Members will go to
questions for everybody.
Go ahead please,
Mr.
Chep
>> this whole sign
up.
Good afternoon, Mr. Chair, good
afternoon, Members of the Committee
Members of the audience.
My name is Patricia
Henning. Uh I
am with the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory,
um title is
Director of New Mexico Operations.
And what that really means is I'm the
director of the VL A. So I'm
delighted to be here with
you with you today and tell
you some of the things that
we are doing a big
plans that we, that
we have and
uh um it's an
exciting future.
Uh So,
so I'm gonna speak to you today
about current
and future activities
of the very large array radio
telescope. I hope you have
had a chance to visit about
50 miles west of
here. Uh
Fantastic uh
fantastic facility, very
impressive to look at and to visit.
So if you haven't had a chance,
I'd love to host you.
Um It's
the best telescope on the
planet of its
kind, it does
astronomy uh
in a particular
part of
uh of, of light, if
you will using radio
waves, uh people
from all over the
nation and the
world want to use
it and write
proposals with uh with
their ideas, they compete their
ideas to be
able to use that telescope.
And it is right here in
New Mexico.
Um So
who are we
who operates the national
uh the uh the very large
array? Well, the National
Radio Astronomy
Observatory is a
federally funded research and
development Center.
Our funding
originates from the National
Science Foundation
which flows
through a contract
with the
nonprofit
Associated Universities
Incorporated. So we are
managed by a 501
C three called A U
I. Uh And
so we are all
under, under a U I. We're
all paid by A U I
uh the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory.
For of course, the VL A is
absolutely flagship
observatory. There
are other parts of
the observatory. Um
There's a facility in
West Virginia, there's a
central development lab in
Virginia and the overall
headquarters uh are
in Virginia. But here in New
Mexico,
um we have
actually two telescopes
the VL A is the famous one
that I hope you've seen
uh the very large array.
And we also run what's
called the very long
baseline
array uh
which is a similar
operating telescope. It's
got 10 antennas, two of
them are in New Mexico, one in Los
Alamos, one in POW
and then eight in the rest of the
country actually from Hawaii to
the Virgin Islands. And that
is also headquartered
right here at
our Domen Energy Science
Operations Center about a quarter
mile that way on the New
Mexico Tech
campus.
Um
So I am, I'm focused
on New Mexico operations
today and you can see it's a very
large part of all of
Nrao. So Nrao
and, and in its
entirety, uh including
the facilities I mentioned and also
it's very large share in a,
in a, a different telescope
in South America and Chile.
Uh Nrao is nearly 600
people and 250 of them are
here in New
Mexico.
Um So let's focus on
Nr A Os impact in
the State of New Mexico. I
want to start with the current
VL A, as I've mentioned,
250
employees. It's a high
tech uh
organization, but
with a lot of different job classes
of folks that we need, we need,
we have welders, we have
electricians, we have a,
you know, a wide range of people
who are absolutely necessary
to run this uh cutting
edge facility.
Uh and you can see some, some
statistics there about
salaries and what our operating
budget is uh
in, in, in a year. Um
And so it's
continues to be
cutting edge science.
Uh though it is
actually over 40
years old now, it was
dedicated back in
1980
it had a big uh
electronics
uh overhaul about
10 years or so ago.
Uh But in
order to, to
make, make the next big
step in science and
technology, we are
thinking about a very much
a very large step
forward, which is
we're calling the next
generation VL
A. Uh
And so the,
the NVL A
is going to
be a telescope
with instead of 27
antennas, the VL A has
27 antennas, it
will have
263
it's a plan
uh and
that will still
be centered in New Mexico,
that is the plan. So
most of the
antennas will be
in New Mexico, nearly
200 out of the
263
and then others. And you can see a little
snippet of a map underneath
there. Uh Some
will uh spread
into Arizona, into Mexico,
into Texas and then out into
the United States, but fewer
and fewer, the farther and farther
you get, you get
away uh from
from here. So
this is a project
that is currently in
design phase and
the National Science Foundation has
been funding
design. Uh
So we are not uh
quite, quite to the
construction phase yet,
we need to complete the
complete the design to get
construction ready.
Uh And so the, the
design will complete in
a couple of years.
And then, uh
then we go after
the uh the 2.5
billion that will
be required to,
to uh to build
it. Um And
with the endorsement
of our peers in astronomy through
a recent decato survey,
so we are, we are feeling very
good about, you know, the nation, the
world needing this instrument
and understand we need this instrument.
Uh And here it will
be. So
as you can see, it's a step up
in, in numbers of employees,
the 417 employees
there is in New Mexico,
uh and of course many
contractors to build and,
and uh continue
services.
Um I'm gonna
talk in a bit more
detail about the educational
program and a couple of slides,
but that is a very
important part of it to
us. We, we,
we realize and,
and, uh
you know, feel
deeply that that
this facility is in New
Mexico and
should impact students in
New Mexico. It's this
gem of a
global facility right
here so that we are
developing education programs
to serve 8 to
10,000 students.
And already the, the
we get 20,000 visitors,
20 25,000 visitors out
to the VL A now. Uh
and with this development
in our, in our educational program
and a facility I'll talk to you about
shortly. Uh We expect
that to, to double.
So right now
VL A headquarters are,
are in Socorro on the
tech campus that will remain
an important place in the NGVL
A era. Uh We also
envision that Magdalena
will become a center of
activity uh
for, for
maintenance. Um And
we anticipate the project
would bring infrastructure to the, to
the town to support this
work. So
uh a special situation with
a world class facility in rural
New Mexico.
So a bit more about the
NGVL A. It's,
it's, it's astronomy. I
get excited about that, but it is
absolutely not just
astronomy.
Uh the NGVL
A like the VL
A, I'll say
before it VL A is still gonna
go for some time
but uh is a very, very
flexible instrument. Uh
not only is it going to be able to
do cutting it astronomy, it's
going to be playing a supporting
role in uh to
other government agencies
as well. And you can see some of
the, the, the bullets
here, the areas it
will touch in the
technology uh
that we need for the, for
the NVO A. So
it's gonna have an impact in
telecommunications and imaging
technologies and
push the envelope in big
data processing.
Uh And for a sense
of scale there, this
enormous telescope is
going to be generating over
10 terabytes of data
every second.
So it's very much a, a big,
a big data problem.
And uh and so we are
excited to, to be working
on that.
Um OK,
so
let me talk for a moment
about
expansion needs
NGVL A expansion
needs, what, what do we
need help with to
be successful, to be able to do
this?
So
our priority right now
and for the next decade
is hiring and
spending in New
Mexico.
Um We
need to hire folks, we
need to recruit folks, we need to
recruit a
uh a skilled,
a skilled workforce.
Uh And so we recognize
the need and we're not alone in this, but
we recognize the need in this
area for available
housing, for stable
utilities, for good
schools, reliable,
broadband, and
robust community
resources.
Um And uh again,
this isn't just us, we've seen
this uh the the Mid Rio Grande
Economic Development Association
Report Economic Development
Assessment for Socorro County.
Uh lifted up this, this need
especially for the uh available
and affordable housing.
Um Now
we have
successes already
uh in in the project.
I'm really excited to tell
you that in the coming weeks,
very, very soon
out at the VL A site
rising up in the
desert will be a
prototype antenna
for the new array.
Uh That's a fully funded
project. Uh
It's, it's going to be
near the core of the VL
A. It will
uh it's very exciting
because we love the VL A where
it's still doing great science,
absolutely cutting edge,
but the antennas themselves are over
40 years old. And so
it's, it's uh you know, technology
has uh has moved
and so this antenna will look
similar to a VL A
antenna, but there's
going to be some interesting differences
there using sort of more
modern, more than more
modern technology. So
uh mtech antenna
technology is building that, that
prototype out there at the VL
A site. Uh And they also
plan to open a facility in
Albuquerque, thanks in part
to support uh from
the New Mexico Economic Development
Department. Thank you very much that
those plans are, are are
underway.
Um
So
the, the role of NSF
here is funding
scientific facilities,
funding a, funding a
telescope. And
we would like to leverage
this investment to
serve an important
role for
the students of New Mexico since
it is right here. Uh
We want to show this
absolutely cutting edge
facility. The VL A
is now and then the NVL
A in the future to New Mexico,
students have much more of a
presence in their education
to bring them on site, to get
them excited.
So, um
we are gonna talk about
now the uh planned
next generation learning
center at the VL
A. Uh which
the idea here is that
this, this will be
a, an exceptional
educational experience as
well as learning experience
for students that matches the quality of
the science that's going out there,
uh going on there at the site.
Uh So serving students
directly and also
through uh teacher professional
development program.
So we
want to inspire students to
consider stem
careers. We want to
help build that stem
workforce in New
Mexico. And as
I mentioned, role
of, of uh you know, of course, the
students are critical
uh and the citizens
of New Mexico are critical,
but we also have a lot of people
coming through to look at the VL
A because it's so exciting and then the
NVL A in the future.
Uh So we expect to,
to much increase
our tourist
visitors. And right
now, uh two
thirds of the visitors who come to
the VL A come from out of
State and they need
hotels and they need lodging
and they need and they need other
amenities.
Uh So
let me talk a bit about
partnerships,
partnerships with State
and federal agencies.
Now, uh
we partner in, in
several different ways.
So with, with the,
uh with the federal
government, we
have um
partnerships with
actually two versions of the
US Navy. We work with the US
Naval observe research laboratory,
as well as the naval
observatory. They
use our facilities uh to
support their mission.
Um NASA
and uh the
Smithsonian Institution
support uh some of our
scientists research
and the Federal Communication
Commission on, on uh issues
of spec spectrum
management,
which is very critical in radio
astronomy. We share the
spectrum with a lot of
different entities.
So um
while the, the vast
Majority of our funding comes from
the federal government, we have partnered
with the State and actually the
original Visitors
Center when it, when
it was originally
built, uh State
allocated funds for that
many decades
ago. We
work closely with New Mexico Tech.
I mentioned that uh the NR
A Os New Mexico headquarters is
in the Pete Domenici Science
Operations Center very close
to where we're sitting. And this
is an ongoing decades
long relationship we we've
had with uh with New Mexico
Tech and
uh currently with with the
University of New Mexico.
We have an mou
to, to
explore collaborations
and how, how there might be
support uh it from
U and M for future US
radio astronomy
initiatives.
Um
So let's
talk specifically. Now,
next generation
learning center, what
economic impact are we
expecting? We've contracted
for an economics impact
study which shows
um a total
economic impact through
2029 which would be the,
the end of construction of 53
million. You can see the
numbers of jobs and then
the local income, local worker
worker income. And
that's detailed uh in a
little bit more in the next
slide uh where
I've divided it out to short
from short term to long
term. Um You
see that, of course, the numbers, the
the economic impact with,
with multipliers
rises.
Um And in the long
term, I think the key point here
is that we anticipate
21 enduring local
jobs and you can
see the uh over a million,
an annual worker
income uh
and that, that uh
multiplied output.
Um And we're, we are
off the ground with this um
Very happy to,
to say that uh
thanks to Senator Lujan,
we have been awarded
uh 1 million
in of congressionally
directed spending funds
in Fy 24. And there's another
request into the Senate
appropriations for
Fy 25. Uh and
this is to be spent on
design services.
We've reached out to many
stakeholders in
this facility and have
unanimous enthusiastic
support. We've spoken withers
school districts, tribal
communities,
tourism department
of public, a public education
and so on. So the way that
this will
work is that
Nrao will
manage the construction,
the operations and maintenance
of the facility
and uh the partner
fiscal agent will
own the land and, and
the building that is that would
be the
model.
Um So
in, in summary,
I I hope
um I hope you're
excited about the future.
I'm certainly excited about the
future. The next
generation VL A
the next generation learning
center, it will be
nationally important
facilities and we
hope the State of New Mexico
will consider partnering with
us uh to ensure
that New Mexicans citizens
are well served by
this, by this
investment.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. >> Uh
Doctor
Trump.
Well, thank you. Um
I'm here
speaking for the first time to this
group, Mr. Chairman
and Members of the Committee. So
thank you. And I want to
acknowledge uh five people that
I brought with me. Uh
Doctor J Misra, who is a
professor of Computer Science
and the Associate Dean for Research
in the College of Engineering at N
MS U.
Doctor Jay Misra or
Doctor J Frankel, sitting
next to him, who's the department Chair
of uh mechanical and aerospace
Engineering and an endowed
professor. Thank you, Jay,
uh Doctor Katie Brewer, who's
an associate professor in chemical
engineering.
Next to her is uh
V Pr
Vice President for research, Doctor
Luis Cifuentes.
And I want to also
thank behind the
V pr. We have our interim
President, Doctor Monica Torres
joining us today.
So thank you all for coming. And
I want you the Committee to
uh please engage
these individuals uh following
the following this discussion
with specific questions.
And so if we'll go to the first
slide that says N MS
U Office of Research at the top,
you'll see two people
in a laboratory there.
My name is Tanner Shaub. I'm the
Assistant Vice President for Research
at New Mexico State University.
I'm from Tomen, New Mexico.
I did my bachelor's
degree at New Mexico State University.
During that time, I worked at
Sandia National Labs
during the summers and I worked
at New Mexico State State
University for Sandia
Labs on a
on a funded
grant opportunity.
So I imagine that this group wants
to know the answer to the question. What's
the return on investment if I
invest to invest a million
dollars in a research project,
what is my average expected
return? And I'm gonna try to
give you a sense of that
answer and the, the
way that you, you might think about
that. Um And I
think that's an important framework
for what we're talking about.
So uh what
was important to me as a first-generation
student at New Mexico State
was that I had to pay rent.
I had to pay tuition also at
that time. And so that
internship with Sandia National
laboratories that came from federal
funding was what
got me through school.
And so what's important
about New Mexico State
University in particular
is that we have the ability
to uplift the lives
of young people in our State.
We can take a kid from
Bernardo or Lamaar
or Bloomfield,
Lovington Hatch
New Mexico
smart kids that grew up on
farms fixing stuff and we can
put them in the mechanical and
aerospace engineering
program and
get them a job at Sandia Labs.
And that's real social mobility.
And they're going to stay here, they're gonna
raise their families here and their
kids are gonna have opportunity.
So, what's the, what's the return on
investment there?
Research, like nothing
else we do at
universities has the power
to really transform
things. And I think, I, I hope that,
that what I'm going to
relate to you today about
some of our hot topics that
are going on. These are just a few things
that we're doing that. I'm gonna talk to you
about really are
bringing opportunity in
the top in the form of federal
dollars in the form
of student opportunity,
social mobility,
technology development, and
economic development. When things are
are made that we can, we
can push out to technologies and
also attract companies
to actually invest in the
research itself. Come join us
at the early stage of
research.
Some of the key
things that were that are going on
in New Mexico State
University research
are number one, I would
say water, we are the
flagship Institution for
Water Research in the State of New
Mexico. We can
look at the academic
analytics uh Toolkit
which is a national database
and search faculty. And we can
identify over 220
faculty at New Mexico State
University whose research
directly relates to
water.
We are uh leading
in energy research power
systems, microgrids very
important in New Mexico State.
We lead the State
in terms of cybersecurity
and A I uh
research and uh
training programs
in cybersecurity. We brought
in uh we rank number
90 out of all
institutions in the co in the
country. We brought
in the last year alone, we brought
in about $10 million worth of
federal funding in
cybersecurity in A
I and machine learning. We
ranked 76th.
We brought in over
$5 million just last
year in that area,
advanced manufacturing is an
area of high importance. I'm going to talk
about that in a minute. Of course,
our identity is built on
agriculture.
Radionuclide is a
research is an emerging area
and we're going to talk about that a little bit. So I'm
going to the next slide. This
is uh I'm actually, I'm gonna stay on
that first slide real quick about the two
people in the lab coats and the
blue lab coats, that guy
standing there. Uh He's a
faculty member. His name is Omar
Olgin. He
uh he grew up in Los
Luas. He and I actually went to high school
together. I funded
him on federal
funds. Small, not, not
a huge grant, maybe five,
maybe uh 3
$400,000 from the Department
of Energy that funded his
postdoc. He went on
to become a faculty member
at New Mexico State University. He's
up for promotion to full
professor. This semester,
this guy has brought in tens of millions
of dollars to the State of New Mexico in
the form of federal funds and student
opportunity. Go
to the next one. N MS U
research priorities. I, these are the
hot topics I want to talk to you
about. We've invested
heavily uh primarily
around the area of water
research in State of the
art, analytical chemistry
tools. These are
high-end modern
instrumentation tools
and people uh
that can answer questions
about if we work
in the Permian basin with
petroleum companies, we're trying to
clean up water to do various
things, reinject
it for fracking,
use it for agriculture, whatever
is the target. How do we
know how well we're doing? How
do we know if the treatment technology
is removing the things we think
it's removing. When we
look at biological
systems, you want to look at cancer,
you want to take a healthy line, cell
line and a sick cell line.
You want to say in a very detailed
way, what's different between
those two. You need these kinds of
advanced analytical tools
uh to answer those questions.
And this particular
laboratory is uh
regionally, there's
nothing like it, there's nothing like it
in Arizona. There's nothing else
like it in the State of New Mexico.
In the past two years, we brought in
2.3 million in direct
federal funds to that lab.
That's just the budget
for that laboratory in terms
of federal dollars. The total
value of collaborative
efforts on those funds
or on those funded projects
in the past two years is over
$11 million in new federal
funding. The lab
supports ongoing research
projects. So the scope of everything
that this lab touches is over
$25
million.
I have some key research partnerships
listed below including natural
la uh national laboratories,
the NIH biomedical
uh capacity building program
called in of course,
the New Mexico State University
Agriculture Experiment station.
When we want to look at plants
grown on different kinds
of treated water or
um in different
uh stress conditions, for example,
drought, drought conditions and look
at how the biology of those, those
food crops changes. We can
do that very accurately with these
things. We're also part
partnering with private industry.
I want you to flip please to the
uh picture. It's a large
full page picture of a laboratory
with a bunch of boxes
in it. And I want to thank
this group and the leadership
of the New Mexico Legislature
for um its support
through the technology Enhancement
Fund of awarding a
$1.9 million
to this laboratory, which is a
50% match
where we are installing now,
$3.9 million
in new instrumentation in this
area. This is supporting
a broader range of topics
again, water,
energy,
biomedical.
Um And
so uh thank
you all for your, for your support there. I
think that's extremely important.
These things are actually being
unboxed as we speak.
We've got about 20 different
instruments going in there that add
to what was already a fairly strong
base capacity
and uh I
will reach out to
whomever coordinates this
group and I will be
inviting each and every one of you to
the ribbon cutting that we do
probably uh in the
early winter time frame.
I'm gonna skip on to the next
um hot
topic area that I want to bring
to your attention. N MS
U research priority, intelligent
additive manufacturing.
Uh Our
Associate Dean for research
and Professor of Computer Science
and electrical engineering, Doctor
Jay Misra who's here has
recently been awarded a $7
million NSF Epsco
E Rise award. These are very
prestigious. It's uh
the only one in New Mexico
and the topic is intelligent
additive manufacturing.
What is this? So
this is a brand new thing and I'm
just gonna, I'm gonna tell
you what I know about it the best that
I can. It's
to create a
system
that allows
rural areas to fabricate
parts in
their location. It
avoids transportation
issues and it, it enables
rural communities to participate
in, in uh global
problems from their, from
their location. They're
addressing things like
cybersecurity issues. So
like if you wanted to make a 3d
printed part um
and you can
talk to the company and
get the, get the dimensions of the
part that you need to make to, for
example, solve a, solve a
problem, build a part that you need
for a tractor in
Farmington.
Uh
How do you get those plans
to that? Site without
compromising the
intellectual property Integrity
of the, of the company from
whom you're getting the thing, it
involves supply chain
issues. Uh
So I will,
I will just leave it there and, and
encourage you to ask questions about
this project to uh
doctor Misra who's
here. But the goal is to make
distributed additive
manufacturing a reality in New
Mexico. This is
an idea that NFNSF
obviously believes
strongly in. We have
key research partners
in U and M, New Mexico
Tech, Navajo Tech, the
National Labs and also the private
sector.
I'm gonna go on to the next
uh hot topic. N
MS U research priority
radioactive material research
and workforce development.
Recently, very recently,
uh Doctor Katie Brewer
uh received
$4.8 million from the
Department of Energy to
establish a federal
um a federal
uh uh let's say uh
research and workforce
workforce development program
around uh radioactive
materials management.
Um during
the atomic era and
the Cold War era, we were
making as a nation an
enormous amount of uh very
highly radioactive
material and waste. And
these things were this material was put
into tanks.
As I understand it, it will
take uh something on
the order of 80
years or more
to deal with the
logistics of cleaning up
what we have in tanks
that are not currently secure
and uh develop new
technologies and new ways of
handling this and this. So this
workforce development, we know
that the Department of Energy
is pointing to literally
thousands of jobs
over decades
that will be funded that will be
required. And this is happening
here in the State of New Mexico. And
this award uh
that Doctor Brewer got
is to train Mexico
kids to, to take these
jobs, both
research positions and
technical uh technical
jobs. We have a very
strong radioactive material
program at New Mexico
State that includes Doctor Brewer,
as well as other researchers
in the Department of Chemistry. And I pointed
that out at the bottom in the
past two years alone. In
addition to the $4.8
million we've received two, a
little over $2 million
in new federal funds for
radioactive materials.
Um the State or
the uh
uh Department of
Energy through Los Alamos
and this uh plutonium
workforce development initiative
is delivering $18
million to New Mexico institutions
to fund uh worker
training in plutonium as
well. So we're kind of capitalizing
us. I'm going on to the next slide
that talks at the top. It says the
location opportunity.
We are in the Southwest Nuclear
Corridor, the researcher
in uh radioactive
materials in the Department of Chemistry
that I work with. He explained
it that if you like to
work with radioactive stuff, New
Mexico is the best place on the
planet to do that. I pointed
out some of the pi uh the the
partners for the new
CMY pipeline,
including the Center for supply
chain entrepreneurship and the
College of Business at New Mexico
State and the car bed
environmental Monitoring and Research
Center or CERC in
Carlsbad, Savannah
River National Lab
P, Georgia Tech,
Sa Savannah River Nuclear Solution.
So I encourage you to ask
questions to doctor Brewer about
that. The
pipeline goals are to of
course, as I said, expand the
workforce and, and
expand regional
capabilities and research.
And we're also developing
uh uh uh
interdisciplinary graduate
certificates and nuclear chemical
engineering.
Moving on next hot
topic, N MS U research
priority, hypersonics,
hypersonic vehicles
are either missiles
or planes that
travel at over
five times the speed of sound.
So mach five,
this is the technology in terms
of missiles that Russia
has, that we don't. And so this
is a national defense priority.
There are billions of dollars
available in this research
area and
this is an area that we're trying to get
off center. We have a fantastic
faculty in this area.
We have brought in over 2.5 million
in new federal funds to New Mexico
State. Uh from the
agencies listed there
again, thank you to the New
Mexico Technology Enhancement
Fund for uh
agreeing to support
uh a $1.36
million
uh request
for a $2.7
million total proposal for a
Mach seven wind tunnel. This is
critical capacity to
get to where we want to be.
We have a key partnerships
with Lockheed Martin, the Naval
Research Laboratory, Sandia
National Laboratory
and go on to the next page.
I want to talk about our N
MS Aerospace Space
Engineering impacts on the State
of New Mexico at N MS
U. We have the only advanced
uh aerospace
engineering degrees in the State,
both bachelor's
master's and phd
level. We're in a fantastic
economic development position
because of our proximity and our
relationships that we have with white
sands missile range. And
we have a ton of workforce. We have over
300 degree seeking
undergraduate students in the,
in the aerospace
engineering program.
The stakeholders are listed below.
But let's just say that there's a lot of
very influential
and a very, a lot of very uh
deep pocketed uh
private sector folks and
including the including
in addition to the federal government
that are um looking
to fund this, we believe we can bring in
about $2 million in
non-stars per
year uh to our center
once we get this new tunnel.
Uh And so, so that's what
we're working on.
I've, I've shown some of the
hypersonics research team
uh on the next page.
Uh Just to let you know that we
are, we're hiring in this
area, we're building capacity
all the time. We're now at a
very, very
strong team of researchers
in this area and we expect it to
grow. I'm
gonna finish by
um just
pointing out one example of
Corporates sponsored research
collaborations. We're trying, we're talking
about bringing in uh companies
that are interested in investing in
research infrastructure at the
early stage, funding
students, funding projects
um rather than
waiting until the end and funding
the IP or fund and buying the
license. And so this
is an example from our Arrowhead
Center of a continuous
high-speed determination of
aflatoxin and pistachios
and other nut crops. You can do it in
pecans. And so
aflatoxin is a very
toxic thing, toxic
molecule that comes from
um molds in,
in uh in nut crops.
And uh our faculty
worked out a way to test
a conveyor belt that's got nuts
going by on uh on
it in the early stages of
the, of the processing
and uh detect
uh aflatoxin very
to very low levels. Um
and they patented this technology
and we're working with the company to roll
it out in terms of a commercial,
commercially availa available
product and there's some need
and market potential data
there. But this is an example
of, of research going to
market in a meaningful
way. I'll stop
there and, and uh please
ask you to direct your questions on the
last slide. Here's a photograph
and and description of each of
each of the guests, technical
guests that I brought with with
me and thank you for your time.
>> Thank you very much, Doctor Shab.
And thank you to the three of you
really remarkable
breadth of
work and research and
service to the State of New
Mexico and to the
nation that you all represent.
We'll go straight to questions.
We're gonna start with representative Chatfield
and go to Representative Dixon
Representative Armstrong and I'm
sure many others.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
uh Mr.
Chair. My question is for Doctor
Doyle. How will
A I be
able to increase
production in the State of New
Mexico.
>> Well, that's interesting. Uh
you know, I mentioned those
two
uh engines projects.
One is specifically
focused on A I, the
other is focused in an area called
spatial biology
that makes tremendous
use of A I.
And one of the areas
of
the spatial biology is
one of the most cutting edge
areas in
biotechnology right now is
name method of the year
by nature. In
2021
it is up until now been
largely focused in animal
biology. We're gonna be
looking to mov'e that
into plant
biology and
agricultural
biology. And
A I will be a major
tool in allowing
us to do that, which will allow
us then to
enable researchers
to make new breakthroughs
to dramatically, you know,
expand the
possibilities in that
field.
>> So Mr.
Chair, I manage a
project and we've map
vegetation. We
use uh
uh
light refraction
to determine what
type of vegetation is
there because of the amount of
moisture that it
transpires.
And you can get that from
satellites which are circling
the earth continuously.
And I do know that some of the
universities have transpiration
towers and we
use the, the
transpiration towers are
used to calibrate the
satellites and
this was old-time computers
that did this.
So
we measured what was being
grown there. Uh
We can measure what's
being grown there 40 years
ago just because uh
we have photography
back that far.
And now we have the ability
to analyze that photography.
My question to you
is,
well, number one, is
that something that this A
A I is going to
enhance? And I asked
I'm quizzing you because I'm
very interested.
And number two,
we can analyze what is being
grown there, we can analyze
what's been grown there.
We can determine what
kind of water rights you have
to uh that
particular piece of property
because how much water
you put to beneficial
use. But we
can't really increase
the production of the property. We
can just
determine how it's been
used to produce.
So number one, is
this one of the technologies
that you're talking about that
would be enhanced
by A I and number
two will A
I? Is
there some way that it will increase
our AG production?
>> Mr. Chair Mr.
Representative? Actually,
what you're talking about is the
application of a
broader notion called
spatial science.
And this is an area
that that has been
uh that grew out of
a lot of the work the kind of
work done here at New
Mexico Tech in terms of
mapping and
and and
analyzing
the spatial distribution
of various kinds of data.
And these are very complex
problems and
and A I
systems. And
the are
are new approaches
that are allowing us to
analyze enormous
data sets of this type
and and
provide new
capabilities to
answer those questions. So
yes,
thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you very much, Representative
Chatfield, Representative Dixon
and Representative Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
um
Doctor Doyle, you started.
Um And so my
questions actually are mostly
for you. Um but
the others could chime in
um as
well
on page 11 of your
presentation,
you highlight
that TEF is a valuable tool
but not enough for emerging
opportunities. Could you elaborate
on that, please? >> Sure
if
Mr. Chair
madam representative, if
if you look at
the, for example,
the this is the second year
of the NSF Engines
program
and there's, there
comes
uh
together with a similar
program from the ad A
called the Tech Hubs program
and these both have been happening
across the country.
Um And if you look at the
states that have been successful
in landing these
in the first
round,
without exception,
each State put
in tremendous
amount of additional
resources to help
land those projects.
And uh for
Colorado, for example,
I had heard that they put up
as much as $50
million to, to
support their,
their particular projects.
Illinois won a number
of these uh projects
and put up, you know,
provided significant
State
opportunities.
I think we have an
opportunity to
look at,
perhaps
look at the feasibility of creating
something like uh uh a
capture fund
that would allow us
to have
resources that could go
into,
you know, preparing
these large collaborative
proposals and then
resources that could become
part of the
budgets of the proposals
themselves. And,
and uh
but here we're talking
about, you know, scales
that are larger than what's
anticipated in the
TEF. The TF has been incredibly
valuable for advancing
research. But
in order to really compete with
the other states for these
massive projects,
we need to take a broader
view.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
and to follow up
on that, my understanding
is also when you're applying
for some of these
grants um
from NSF or
other institutions
that you do in fact
have to have the match
money committed from the
State. Is that correct?
>> Well, it depends on the program
but uh for
the engines, for
example,
they, they require
uh additional support
and, and
in terms of hard and
fast requirements, they,
there aren't a list
of very specific requirements,
but it's made very
clear that
the projects that will become
more competitive are the ones
that can better leverage
support from the State,
from businesses and from,
from other
collaborators.
>> Great Um
Thank you.
I'll go ahead. Um
And then thanks.
>> Thank you very much, Representative Dixon
Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank
you for your presentation.
Um Sitting in front of us right
now is a whole entity
that helps grow. New
Mexico brings
tons of federal outside
dollars into the State
creates jobs
and who doesn't want that for New Mexico?
Right? I think everyone in
this room wants that. And so
how do we get it
done and how do we get it across
the finish line?
Um
We starting with New Mexico
Tech, uh Doctor
Doyle on the ag
economic
activity. How
does, how are, how do
you see that improving
um your work
at New Mexico Tech and what you want
to do? Can you
be a little more specific about
what that would be?
>> Uh Thank you, Mr. Chair uh
madam Representative.
So um sure
as part of that uh
spatial biology engine,
for example,
um uh
by
applying new
technologies that allow us
to understand the mechanisms
of of plant
development, we'll
be able to
create
new
hybrids, new, new
lines, new methods
for increasing
uh agricultural yield,
for example, will be able
to enable
new businesses
to emerge
that can focus on
particular
uh segments
of the agricultural
industry. And
because these will emerge
from a set of resources
that are in the State,
these resources won't
just support
the launch of these businesses.
They'll also support the
ongoing growth of those
businesses which will keep
them in the
State. >> Thank you for
that. I, I appreciate that.
I, I, I'm
a big proponent of doing
everything and doing it respectfully
and, and let's uh
find new ways. We just
spoke earlier, Mr. Chairman
with PE D Secretary
about how do we do
things
um better and how
do we do things different?
And so, yes, go ahead,
>> Mr. Chair and Representative
Armstrong if I May jump in
there. Um New Mexico N
MS U has a $3
million NSF grant
in this area. The title of the
grant is A I and
agriculture. Um It's
largely focused on
workforce development. And
so to your question, how do we get across
the finish line? I believe it's that
investment in the workforce,
it's in the student training,
it's in the answering the
research questions,
but it's the opportunity to
engage young people there
that will make the difference, will, that
will put those minds
to work on this uh
topic and it, it
covers a wide
range of things
relative to what actually
happens at the field level
in agriculture. And I
won't speak to that directly.
Uh We could ask some of our
folks here that maybe have a
better answer. But I, I just want to say
that workforce development, I think is a key
issue there and, and we're,
we've, we've put our money where
our mouth is on that. >> Thank
you for that. That's part of my,
my questioning is,
is starting
with the with Doctor Henning.
Thank you for your presentation
and I want to compliment you on
your nice clean
cut little handout
here because we get a lot
of papers as you can see.
Um
One of the questions I have
is so to grow,
growing our own.
I'm very big in growing
our own, starting in the high
schools and,
and going through whatever
entity it is, plumbers,
electricians, scientists,
whatever it is. Have
you been working and have you been
talking with New Mexico
Tech and others
to and the high
schools to
see about
um workforce
recruitment starting
at a, at a, at a high
school level? >> Thank you, Mr. Chair
and madam representative. Absolutely.
We, we are
first off, I I
run a high tech
facility but I
understand that ultimately
it's people, right? It
doesn't happen without the
people, uh the passion
of the people, the skills and
we have, we have the best staff
in the world uh in, in our
field. We absolutely
do. And
uh we have had
a success uh
in the in the
past uh with
our internship program. Then
then hiring interns
who come to us
from tech uh to
come to us uh
locally who stay
because they know the region
they're excited about the facility
and they're excited about being here, about
being about being in New
Mexico. Uh So
we have been in, in some
discussions uh
with tech with
UN M at some
level, CNM.
Uh
Our, our,
our, our, our
high school um
interactions at this point are
pretty informal. Uh
We
have a
uh we
mentor the astronomy
team and they come in first or
second in the State, sometimes
just second to Albuquerque
Academy and we're going for it.
But uh so we've got a great
team there. So we don't have a
formal program in
place yet, but we would certainly
love to, to continue and deepen
those conversations.
>> Thank you for that because
I, you know, I think um
I saw
in N MS
U's presentation
where, you know, they're,
they're already working
with um
some specific
entities to help grow their
own for employment.
And um and so I would
suggest that you work
with uh any, any
high schools as long as we
keep them here in the State. I,
I'm happy to, to
just keep them here. You know,
we're, we
have the brain drain and we send them
all away, we graduate and we
pay, we pay for their education and
then they go somewhere else. So I
would love to see a
collaborative effort between
all the universities and,
and any high school you can touch
to say, you know,
I raised four kids in
Magdalena. I
have 12 grandchildren
in Magdalena area
in New Mexico. All 11 in
New Mexico. One in Montana. I'm
gonna get her back though.
And, um,
you know, if we give
these kids some hope
that they, they have a job
to go to, even if it's at
the bl A and they are,
like you said, an electrician
or plumber or,
uh, the, even the janitor
or anything. There's,
there's an array of,
of jobs to be offered. And
so to keep them
to keep our kids here is
what is most important to
me and, and
have a, a
job to come
to, to have,
get them while they're young and
grow them and they're excited
and they, that's what they want to do.
So, one of the other
questions I had, Mr. Chairman
is um for,
for uh doctor Henning.
Um is there a
President set
for uh the
kind of partnership between a State
and national observatory
where the State
funds uh
learning center to
support a, a science
foundation facility
uh >> to build Mr.
Mr. Chair, madam
representative. Yeah,
absolutely. And, and
22 things come
to mind. One is early
in the history of uh of the
VL A many decades
ago that the
State of New Mexico actually
allocated the, the funds
for the original vi visitor
center at, at the VL
A. And, and more
recently,
uh there is a
very important national facility
called the Laser Interferometer,
Gravitational Wave Observatory
or Ligo, you May have,
you May have heard of this, uh,
in Washington State
and the State of Washington,
uh, funded their learning
center which is also
in a rural location,
uh, and is fully booked out
with school groups in
Washington State for a very, very
long time. They've got a full,
a full docket. Uh
And so there, that model,
that model is there.
Uh, and I think relevant to
your, your earlier point,
the, the high school is,
is an important time,
but even even
earlier, uh getting, getting
the kids to
see this
facility, even if they're a little
bit young and
they're not quite
ready to know what they want
to do, but to, to see that this
exists in their State.
It's exciting. It
takes a lot of folks
to run it in a lot of different
areas in stem
areas uh catch
them early and say, hey, look, this is
an inspirational spot where you
might want to work someday.
>> I, I agree with you
for that. And,
you know, um uh the movie
contact was made out
at the VL A and
we have Children, some of
our Children, uh Representative
Jamil's Children
and
that are adults now that were
in that movie and, and they
get to go out and, and visit
the visitor center out my kitchen
window. I see
the VL A
and uh you really
take it for granted
when you see it every day
and until you, it's just
like kind of like New Mexico, you take
it for granted until you go
somewhere else and you come back and you're
like, I love this State.
So I see
um I see
tourism, I see economic
development. I see
education
in, in the fact
of for New
Mexico
but also for Socorro County.
And of course, I'm
I have a prejudice for
that, but we
see across the State
of New Mexico where
the Rio Grande Corridor kind
of gets a lot of things.
So Santa Fe Albuquerque,
Las Cruces, this
is something that actually spreads
the other direction
and I think it would be
um instrumental
in helping grow New Mexico. And
so I appreciate that. And do you
have a fiscal
agent that, that
you're willing to work with and
that's willing to work with you >> madam
representative? We, we have been
in discussions with the county
for a couple of years actually, a couple
of years ago, a resolution was
passed. So back in,
in 22
which, which indicates that the
county is willing to serve as a
fiscal agent. Uh We
are exploring, we're exploring
possibilities, there are possibilities.
So, yeah. >> Well,
again, thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I uh
it's exciting for me
for New Mexico, all
entities at the table.
Um And
you know what we saw this morning
with Emert
and, and what they do
for the State of New Mexico
and, and all the little things
that happen that we May
not know about. So, thank you for
educating us and thank you for being
here today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Representative Armstrong. Next, we're going
to Representatives >> then
Senator
Woods.
Thank you Mr. Chairman
and thank you for your presentation. We
have such amazing universities
and, and all kinds of
technical areas
and I am
as a teacher, II, I
tried to focus, used to
push my kids to go to
staying here, going to colledge
here because we do such great
things. And
um I think
Representative Armstrong
said a lot of the things I was going to say, but
one thing is diversifying our
economy, we have to
diversify and I saw a lot of areas
where we could if we can just
expand on everything doing.
So um
I'm part of Epsco now, so I'm
excited to learn more about what's
happening there. And
um I just want to say thank you
for all you do. If you can keep our
kids in, in, in New Mexico, that'd
be great because all three of mine are gone.
And um I think we,
if we could bring them back with some of these
technologies, that would be great.
But um nna,
you uh
we do a lot with, I do a lot with
water and the produced
water is, is we're
getting close to just using fresh,
right? Pretty soon. Do
you, is that something you're
looking at or as
far I know Doctor Shu comes in
and presents in front of
us
all the time and, and it's just
like you guys are right
at the end. So,
>> yes, ma'am. Uh Mr.
Chairman and Members of the Committee.
uh there's an enormous
diversity of
water research at New Mexico
State. We have
um the water
resources Research institute.
This look looks at stuff like
hydrology,
snow melt the
AAC systems, this kind of stuff
at community levels. What can we
do better for water management?
We go all the way from that all
the way to the very technical side
of engineering
processes trying to clean
up municipal
wastewater
brackish water from
over near Alamogordo,
right? There's an ocean, there's a
sea worth of
salty water there
to use if we can clean
it. And then of course to produce
water from the oil and gas industries.
And so we're active in all those
areas. And of course, Doctor
Z's name comes to the top
as well, but we actually are
starting to build our
bench very deep. Now, we
have this this analytical
chemistry capability is a big
one of those supports many
faculty working in this
area. And I think that
diversity is key
even in the Permian Basin,
even just looking at produced
water. Each one of
those waters is different depends on where
you drill, how deep, how you
know there's, there's a number of
technical challenges. So
um N
MS U's role there is
to provide sound
scientific
data and
technology development
and not take a political
stance there and just
do the science and be a trusted
partner to the State and to
the to the people of New Mexico
in terms of developing things
that are real solutions.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and, and New Mexico Tech.
They have educated
as well with their programs that
Stacy um
pursues and, and gets
us into, I've learned a lot over
the last year on
water and how, how vital it is
that we get started. But can you
talk a little bit to that as
far as what you're
doing? >> Thank you, Mr.
Chair madam representative.
Um As
I as I mentioned, we've got a number
of initiatives focusing
on uh uh
data acquisition,
data management and water
resources uh
analysis as well
as um
collaborative projects
between the Bureau of
Geology and the P double
RC that are
focused in areas
like uh uh
purification of
produced in the and, and
uh brackish water. And,
and I
mentioned, for example,
one sort
of showcase project
is the
uh uh prototype
desalination system that's
installed on the campus
at uh Navajo Tech.
And, and we're
looking at
uh uh
how to scale
that up and provide that
as a solution
for dealing with
some of the really pervasive
water supply issues
across uh tribal
lands. >> Mr.
Chairman, I'm hoping we can help
with the mapping too to so we
can see where all our water is
all over our State. I think that's
critical
>> Madam representative
in in order to be able
to
support new
businesses in that
space. In fact, we,
we have to create and we
are creating an ecosystem
of
uh feedback
loops where we create,
we gather the information
characterize the aquifers,
study the hydrology,
um understand
what's happening, you
know, in terms of geologic
water and,
and provide guidance
in terms of where businesses
can focus and,
and uh and
be able to uh you
know, find successful
business models to work in the
space.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank >> you, Representative. Uh Senator
Woods will go to you
next.
Sorry.
>> Um Thank you, Mr.
>> Chair. My
question to you. You, you
guys are the research
arms of these
universities.
My question to you is,
is,
are we,
are we educating
our
New Mexico kids
to the
extent
that you
are
reaching out to
them? Uh If
that makes sense to
you, who are
you recruiting for your
universities?
>> Mr. Chair,
Mr.
Mr. Senator,
um
uh we're
recruiting extensively
throughout the State as
well as uh outside of
the State, but a lot of
the programs um
that I described today,
major components of those are
workforce development and training
programs. We
see those as not
only uh
programs to provide
skills and capabilities
to students, but also provide
channels to,
to uh
uh expose
those students to the possibilities
at the university
and, and uh
excite them about,
you know, getting involved
with uh uh New
Mexico Tech. For example,
uh 11 of
our very successful programs
in that area, for example,
is in the area of cybersecurity
where we have uh
uh curricula
that, that reach out
into the schools and,
and it provides a
way to
um show
students, you know, at
an early level
that these are things that they can be good
at. And,
and then we can, you
know, once we've started
that spark, we can
then uh uh
show them that
uh you know, there's
actually a path that you
can take to,
to uh enter this
field and, and
uh the way to do that is
to, you know, come to the
university and, and
get trained and, and mov'e
out into the world
uh within the
State.
>> Mr. Chair and the Members
of the Committee, if I May jump in there.
Um One thing that we're doing at
N MS U in that area
in terms of
um
what, what I would, let's say,
characterizes targeted effort
in recruiting uh and
developing kids from
New Mexico uh
to, to come and
be a part of what we're doing. We've
uh launched a new institute's
called the Stem Education
Research Institute. You
won't find it on the website yet. We'll
probably have it out shortly. We just
just stood this up. But
basically what we're doing there is
trying to pair
the very technical
fields with our
education and community
engaged research people.
So we have a lot of people at N MS
us in particular at our
education colledge that are
really smart about
understanding uh
who are, who our
constituency is. What
are uh what,
what new me, what the identity
of New Mexico is
and um
what we want to do is we want to pair
that kind of knowledge with the
technical side. So the
technical can bring the,
the uh the federal funding
dollars, the opportunity to
pay for pay for
help pay for school expenses,
you know, including like how to
live, pay, pay for your
groceries. We can bring that
kind of opportunity to the
uh people
that so how do, how
do you teach in
New Mexico in a
way that's informed, that
gets the message through to our
kids not
thinking, you know, as
opposed to uh very,
very urban areas
or, or other states where those
models of education May
work, different education
models May be in place.
Um And there's a ton of federal
money in this area. We expect this
institute to be
uh quite
impactful and,
and long live. So we'll see where
it goes. But um
certainly understanding our
identity and the our
responsibility to the
communities that we draw students
from is, is a really important
part of our mission
>> if I could just add one more
bit. Uh Mr.
Chair, um Mr. Senator,
um we have a
number of STEM outreach
programs uh uh
that are
particularly uh
designed to
build excitement about
STEM uh as a
field. And, and
a great example
is our robotics
um uh
uh outreach program
that started with just a
handful of,
of uh participants
and is now um
brings in
thousands of
participants across the State
um uh
uh for
battle of the bots kinds
of activities. And that's been
a incredibly successful
way to
expose
um students
to uh the
whole area of
mechanical engineering and
robotics, for
example.
>> Well, we're talking
about very technical
fields and,
and sometimes I worry
that that we are
not training those kids
to those
degrees
are, are like you say, not
exciting them
in high school. So I
appreciate your outreach
efforts to excite
them.
Thank you, >> Mr.
Chair, Mr. Senator. 11
other great activity
that's statewide is our
State Science Fair
that uh you
know, I've been here a year and a
half and so I got
involved last
spring as a Judge
in the State Science Fair and I
was blown away at the
quality of the projects
across the board that were
coming from students
uh at the high school level
across the State. And
uh what a great opportunity
to really get students
excited uh early in
the process.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. >> Thank
you very much, Senator. Uh Next, we're
going to represent Jamel,
please.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um So mine is more of
a statement than um
than a question
um VL A
during the pandemic. Um
I wanted to share with the Committee
was instrumental in
working with us at Alamo
Navajo. Uh VL
A provided a
brand new water
truck that um
saved many lives and I
want to thank you for that.
Um Also, during
that time, I had expressed
that we could not provide
telehealth and that we
were losing people
exponentially. And
so VL A stepped
up and they provided Starlink
to 75
families so that Children
could go to school
and uh could also
receive that telehealth
that I
um I believe
saved many
lives. So I
want to thank you for that. But I
also want to thank you for bringing
forth this educational
opportunity because I know
that through your efforts
and through your efforts as well.
Well, Doctor Cochran, that
you have focused on
native Children and
Children of color
and um with the
vision and the belief that
we can, can
um can work
with our communities
to, to educate
our Children and bring stem into
their lives. You've reached out
to Alamo and I can't thank you enough
for doing that and
for dedicating yourself
to us. So,
um so appreciate that you're
moving forward with, with
the next generation
learning center and so
excited to
hopefully see it come to fruition.
So, um I think that it's a bit
of information that's important
for, for the Members
to know. Thank you so much.
Thank you, >> Mr. Chair. Thank you very
much, representative.
I think that does
it for, for member questions. I'll
have a few uh
first and the
President really
harkening back to your words
yesterday.
Um What we're
seeing is really success from
all three research
institutions
uh in your
own
areas, some where
there's cross collaboration.
Uh So, and I'm
not saying uh
the VL A, we
can't claim you as a research
institution for the State even
though. Um
uh
but, but so I
think, and, and acknowledging
technology enhancement fund
has been important in a number
of these.
It seems like we're now
at a point in
considering
um projects
that you all are working
towards
potential uh
uh awards
in some of these areas. And Doctor
Doyle, you, you talked about a
few in, in some
detail that are
beyond
what the technology enhancement
fund uh
thinks about and
frankly, in some ways, maybe
are we sort of
thinking beyond,
you know, a past
formula funding where
we said, maybe everybody
got a little. So
that
how do we make
sure that when
our excellent
research institutions
and opportunities like with VL
A are here that
are
beyond the
scope and scale that we've sort
of dealt with
any thoughts about how
we prepare for that as
a State, how we make
sure that there are
uh at a time where we have
resources, clearly,
there's more capacity and
expertise and
actual success that you all
are bringing. How do
we make sure instead of that,
you know, two or $3
million match when
it's 25 and 50
perhaps, you know, 75
100 million plus for
some of these truly
um
sort of worlds
shaping
efforts. How do
we, how do we
make sure that you're able
to, to go after that?
And each institution not
sort of as a
function of your peers,
but in your own areas
of expertise that are
uh regionally
nationally and in some cases
internationally
lead,
please,
>> Mr., Chair Members of the Committee. Thank
you. I mean that that's a, that's a
great question. It's a great discussion
really is, is it's because
there's there will be multiple
angles there. Um
I think, you know, tools
and or
funding for
uh not just the, not just
the match but the
funding that can support
capture management for these kind
of things is critical. So you have to
have the capability
of these institutions to
reach out and
respond in a fairly
timely fashion with a
with a strong response
and, and that kind of uh
professional, I
believe certainly at N
MS U is needed, we have them,
but we need a bench of these
people to be competitive
in that area. So capture management
is one thing. Um
another that I would would just
say that it's a related
topic and it's, it's
maybe not as direct as you'd
like to hear, but
um investing
in uh start up
packages for uh
early faculty
in targeted areas. So targeted
hiring, make our
universities the
destination place for
some of these areas that
we expect massive
growth in like a I for
example, uh
is that would make a big difference
here and that's an invest, that's a long
term investment. So,
yeah, those are, those are a few
suggestions. I'm sure there's more.
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah, Mr. Chair
Mr. Representative.
Um I, I would add to that,
that uh
um as I mentioned,
there are opportunities to do things
like create capture funds
and uh and,
and, and
take a um
sort of proactive
uh uh view of
being able to go after
and prepare ourselves to be
ready to go after the next
opportunity that
comes along. But uh
in order to do that,
uh it requires not
just a one time
funds but additional
sources for recurring funds.
And as
uh uh my colleague from
NSN MS U points out
is that uh things
that can allow us to
more effectively
recruit uh
you know, the absolute tops
in, in their fields and,
and, and bring them
to New Mexico and, and
uh allow them to
establish themselves
here uh really just
improves our ability to do
that.
>> Thank you. Thank you very
much, Doctor Henning,
anything from your
end.
And >> Mr.
Representative. So as, as you point
out, we're a little different uh in
this, in this
space, but we do
exist in New Mexico.
And uh I, so
the, the way I think about it
is um
the, the local workforce
development down the
barriers for
uh folks here
to, to stay,
to stay here, to
want to stay here.
Uh We have a very
broad workforce, of
course, we employ New Mexicans, we
also employ nationally,
internationally as well.
Uh But, but particularly
in the jobs in the
jobs where, which are
hands on out at
the VL A uh say,
you know, recruitment is a challenge,
recruitment is a challenge. And
so uh making sure that
we have a, a strong
local pool
uh to recruit from
that. Uh As, as we've talked
about involves uh local
educational institutions as
well. But where
wherever the
those pathways can
be built to,
to help us recruit and
keep people
in rural New Mexico.
And that also means then, you
know, looking, looking at the health
of the and the county where
people will live.
>> Thank you. Thank you all very much.
We're, we're right about time.
Great questions from Members
particularly appreciate that
there are um Members
of your teams and
uh great to see
so many folks make the trip up from
Cruces. I think the
opportunity to sort of
engage if Members have
interest with sort of
the really the experts in the
different areas is a really
unique opportunity for us.
Thank you all for a very wonderful
panel. Thank
you.
All right.
Um
OK.
Um Staying
and, and we're gonna go
right into building a
hub for quantum
technologies.
Um
And
thanks.
Yeah, come
on. Yeah, as folks come up, I'll
introduce everybody and then you
all can choose how to
um sort of
approach your,
the, the order of how folks
want to, to
share. We have two
hours budgeted for this uh
presentation Members.
We're gonna have Ivan Dutch
from or Deutsch from
uh who's a distinguished
professor at University of
Mexico. Jake
Douglas Business Development
Lead for Sandia National
Laboratories, Michael
Rabin, who's the quantum
group leader for Los
Alamos National
Laboratory. Thank you all for
being here today and please,
however, you all want to
proceed. Uh We'll
go ahead, we'll go through all
three of your discussions and
then member comments and
questions.
>> Can you hear me now? Yes.
All right, good afternoon,
Mr. Chairman and Members of the
Committee. Uh We
are excited to be here today
to tell you about Quantum
New Mexico at
this critical juncture for
our State.
My name is Ivan Deutsch.
Uh My title is
distinguished professor and
regents professor of Physics and
Astronomy at the University
of New Mexico.
Um I'm also the founding
director of the Quantum
New Mexico
Institute
as one of the state's premier
institutions of higher
learning. The University
of New Mexico promotes
discovery
generates intellectual
and cultural contribution,
honors economic
values and
fosters an educated,
healthy and economically
vigorous New
Mexico. Uh
This mission is
central to our
presentation today, so
I'll turn it over to my colleagues
to introduce
themselves.
>> Uh Mr. Chairman, Members of
the Committee, my name is
Jake Douglas and I serve as the quantum
business development lead at Sandia
National Labs. Um
I am also a product of New Mexico.
I was born and raised in
Roswell. I received my
bachelor's uh here at New
Mexico Tech. My MB A
from Highlands. Um
And I now live and work
in Albuquerque. Thank you for having
me today. Uh As a
premier federally funded engineering
lab, Sandia conducts
innovative research and development to
anticipate and solve the most challenging
national security problems,
which includes the complex space
of quantum information
science. At
Sandia. We've spent the last
20 years building a world-class quantum
program that is comprised of
hundreds of researchers and
scientists who are he
helping us push the boundaries
of what is possible with this critical
emerging technology.
We take great pride in serving our
nation and our communities and
strive to serve as an
impartial national
resource
to policymakers like each
of you. Uh I'm excited
to be here today to talk about
our efforts to build the quantum
ecosystem and to drive
innovation in our local
communities and to answer
any questions you you have
about quantum information
science. Thank
you
>> and good afternoon.
Uh Mr. Chair Members of
the Committee. My
name is Michael Rabin.
I'm a physicist and
manager at Los Alamos
National Laboratory. I
lead an experimental
quantum science
group
that the laboratory
is very
happy to
support the efforts of the
State. Uh And all
stakeholders looking
across the board uh
for their involvement
in all aspects of the technical
and technological economy
of the State of New
Mexico.
The laboratory is very supportive
of all of our efforts in
particular in the area of quantum
and developing the Quantum New
Mexico uh
coalition
uh the group
I lead at Los Alamos is just
a small part of our
overall quantum
enterprise at the
laboratory which has
a budget of approximately
$60 million per
year. And about 100
researchers actively
working in quantum
information science and
technology. That
quantum community at our
laboratory is very
excited to be part of all of the
partnerships that you'll hear us discuss
today and helping to
build the quantum economy in the State.
Thank you very much.
>> OK.
Um
Thank you
uh
Mr. Douglas
and Dr Raven,
uh Mr.
Chairman and Members of the
Committee, we have
prepared a presentation
of 15 slides
to share with you. If you
are in agreement, we'll
proceed.
Very good. OK. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Uh Let me begin on slide number
two.
In March
2024
the issue
of the quantum insider
recognized New
Mexico as one of
the 7-Up and coming
hotbeds for quantum
technology in the
nation. Uh In
this article, they
made this recognition
based on New Mexi,
New Mexico's
world class
institutions,
our entrepreneurial
ecosystems, our
pro innovation
government and the
close fit of
quantum technology
with New Mexico's priorities
such as national
security,
New Mexico's role
in the Quantum Marina has been
exploding across our
State and in many
of our institutions
including with the recent
announcement of
elevate quantum.
This Mountain West
Consortium is one of
12 regional tech
hubs in the nation
established by a recent
award of
$40.5
million from the Federal
Economic Development
Agency.
We're excited to have
the opportunity to share
details about all of these
developments and their
impact on New
Mexico.
Turning to slide. Number
three,
let let me back up a
little bit.
What is quantum
technology?
This is one of the most
important areas in high
tech today that
will revolutionize
computing communication
and sensing
is the foundation
of the digital
economy in
which we live in
this next generation
technology. Quantum
computers will enable
us to solve some of the
world's most complex
problems.
Quantum can both
break secret codes
and protect our
cybersecurity in
unbreakable ways.
Quantum can dramatically
improve our ability to
sense and detect
the tiniest
signals.
All of this is based
on the foundation of
quantum information
science, which is the
convergence of
two great scientific
pillars of the 20th
century. That is quantum
mechanics and
information science.
Quantum physics.
That's my field. It
describes the
microscopic world
of atoms, photons
and electrons.
Information science
is the foundation of computers
and communication systems.
These enabled
semiconductor
chips, lasers
and GPS in what we
call the first quantum
revolution. But
around the 19
nineties, a second quantum
revolution was sparked
when we began to understand
that we were just beginning to
scratch the surface
and we could harness the
power of quantum for
a huge quantum
leap in information
technology.
Turning to slide number
four
quantum will
supercharge the
information economy of
the 21st century.
As mentioned quantum
computers, quantum
sensors and quantum
communication systems
will all be
revolutionized
by quantum information
science.
Quantum computers
are critical for
national security
as they allow the
breaking of previously
secret codes. So it
is essential that we get
there first before our
adversaries.
On the other hand,
the quantum internet
would enable ultra
secure communications
with cybersecurity
ensured by the laws
of physics
themselves,
quantum sensors
would enable navigation
without the need
for GPS satellites
that might be knocked out
by our adversaries.
And so much more
from drug design
to oil exploration
to supercharged
artificial intelligence.
Quantum technologies
will rapidly accelerate
progress and
enable new
possibilities.
Turning to slide
five,
one of the messages I
really want to communicate
with you today. Is that
we are not just chasing
after the latest
fad,
New Mexico
is a quantum
State.
What that means
is that New Mexico
was a pioneer in
quantum information science
and laid the foundation
with R and D for
over 30 years.
We in New Mexico
played a major
role in launching
the second quantum
revolution.
Now I won't go through
all the details on the
slide here, but we
have for you in your materials,
a timeline where
we show the
pioneering milestones
of Un M Los Alamos
and Sandia National
Laboratories over
these decades, starting
around 1990
when Qis was
born and this is in
parallel with the
developments in in in the
industrial
and governmental spaces.
We're happy to discuss any
additional of these details
with you in the Q
and A. But
what I want to say is New
Mexico's initial investment
is now beginning to yield
fruit and we
have accelerated the pa
the pace in
this decade
with new partnerships
and new institutions
that will carry us into the next
30 years and
beyond
turning to slide
six,
one of these institutions
is Quantum New
Mexico,
QNM.
The objective
of Q and M is to
ensure that
New Mexico reaches
its potential. As a quantum
information science and
technology hub for
the nation,
Q and M will create
a world-class
quantum ecosystem
across our State,
bringing together various
elements including science
and engineering R and
D, education
and workforce
development and
economic development
and industry
engagement and,
and entrepreneurial support
as well.
And two slides
seven,
the research and education
arm of Cuan New
Mexico is the Q
and M Institute where I
currently serve
as the director.
The Q and M I was established
this year as a university
wide Institute at UN
M and will be
a joint institute
between Un M,
Sandia and Los
Alamos National
Laboratories.
By joining
forces.
We can fill
critical gaps,
we can attack the
hardest problems
and attract more federal
resources to New
Mexico. The
Q and M I will
also sustain
the cycle of
innovation
in our R and D
to catalyze
and grow new Mexico's
quantum economy and
broaden participation
with new opportunities
for New Mexicans
across the
State.
So now I'd like to turn the
presentation over to Jake
Douglas.
>> Thank you, Doctor Deutsch.
So, so we've heard a little bit
about what quantum is and,
and the foundation for what we're trying to
do. And I want to talk to you a little
bit today about
what others are
interested in and
quantum is one of the top emerging
technologies in the
world. Um
Federal Legislation has been passed
to help create an all of government
approach to ensuring that the
US stays at the front of quantum
technologies um to
ensure economic and national
security.
With the National Quantum Initiative
being passed in 2018
and subsequent um
Legislation through the NDA
A A the Chips and Science Act and
others.
Um More than a billion
dollars has been authorized to
really mov'e quantum together
as a field across the
nation. I in
addition to the
Legislation, um and
in large part because of it,
there are large-scale federally
supported quantum programs across
the doe, the Department of
Energy, the National Science
Foundation and the Department of
Defense. And
I want to point out that New Mexico is
playing leadership roles across
each of these areas.
Uh Sandia and Los Amos
National Laboratories both help
co-lead the flagship
doe centers,
uh UN M and
the National Labs partner
closely with the National Science
Foundation Centers.
And we're very closely
tied with our partners in the Department
of Defense to ensure that we can
stay ahead
and moving to slide.
Nine.
In addition to the federal
priorities, uh States
are also making the investments
now to ensure that they
can stay ahead as well.
Um To, to
call out a few of the
larger scale investments that we've
seen to date. Uh Illinois
and Colorado are two great examples
of states that are supporting
quantum in a significant and
meaningful way and
these are being done in large
part to attract
national or federal
dollars. Um
Illinois has
um invested
and legislated over
$500 million to
help support the infrastructure,
the education, the
partnerships um
to build the ecosystem
there and launch the industry
needed um and bring
that economic impact
to, to where they are.
Uh similarly Colorado
who are very close partners of
ours um
recently passed a $74
million incentive package
to support industry
through tax incentives.
Um and other
efforts that will again support
the economic development aspects
of things and the workforce development
aspects of things. Uh
that includes earmarked
funds to support grant writers
that includes matching
funds uh to go
capture federal opportunities.
Uh And for support for
a similar type of institute to
what Quantum New Mexico
aspires to be.
And lastly, I I just
want to point out that, you
know, the Mountain West is
the quantum tech hub
for the Department of Commerce and
for the United States and in
a large part that
wouldn't have been able to be possible without
State support. Uh We'll
hear a little bit later from Dr
Raan on this. Uh but the
proposed $10 million of
support for our Ed A tech
hub was critical in helping us win
that opportunity.
Slide 10,
please.
So in addition to
the the government side of things,
we've seen significant private
investment in quantum tech over the
past five years, uh
which is in line with when the
national quantum initiative was
passed,
the the quantum market
is estimated by
2040 to be over
$100 billion.
Um And if we're looking at the
economic impacts of these
diverse technologies, uh
by 2035
the it's supposed to have more than
$1.3 trillion of
economic impact and
this is new areas quantum
is going to affect everything,
you know, like Ivan mentioned
earlier from the financial
services to national
security, to space
and energy. And
we're really seeing
um major
advancements and people are
investing money to help get
there across quantum computing
quantum sensing and quantum
communications
slide
11.
So
with all of this funding,
all this excitement,
uh quantum workforce
demand is very, very
high and there are significant
opportunities for us to engage
in the region. Um
because quantum is a
multidisciplinary and
multifaceted fields,
um It will really allow
us to engage institutions
across the State
in areas that are
meaningful to each of our
institutions and providing
value for communities
across New Mexico.
When we say quantum, you might
automatically think that you
have to have a phd to
work in the field.
But surprisingly,
less than half of the jobs
currently in quantum
require an advanced
degree.
Additionally, we only
see one qualified
candidate for every three quantum
job openings. So there's
a large gap industry is
having to put a lot into training
their workforce and they're trying
to pull from wherever they can.
And we have the opportunity
to help really meet that demand
and build new
job opportunities for
New Mexicans across
the State. As
we mov'e forward, we we see
significant job
growth opportunities by
2035 that
correspond with uh
these investments, both
federal and private.
Um And we see that
the trend is going to
continue downwards in to in
terms of what degrees are
needed. Um
So more people with bachelor's
degrees with certificates where
others will be able to enter
this really high value
field where the average salary
is 100 and $25,000 a
year
slide 12.
And so, what are we doing about
it? Well, we're, we're approaching
this with, with an idea of building
workforce development opportunities
across the full spectrum.
So from engaging at
the K to 12 level all the way
through providing postdoc
opportunities through
Quantum New Mexico, uh
we've been able to launch first
of its kind programs across the
country um
through our quantum computing
math and physics high school summer
camp. Uh we trained
hundreds of high school teachers and
students a across the State
and across the us in
introducing quantum
concepts without the need
for advanced math
or without the need for understanding
advanced stem concepts.
Uh We've worked with uh
communities in June
for our teachers from
Hobbs, from Gallup,
from Farmington
Riodosa all
over the State. Um Being
from Roswell, I want to see opportunities
for Southern New Mexico for
rural areas.
And in our teacher camp, we
saw 40% participation
from rural communities.
Uh In addition, we offer
student camps. Uh We're in the midst
of ours now, it's a four week
program where we're hosting
at Sandia um in
Albuquerque, as well as
in um Santa
Fe in partnership with Los
Alamos. And we had
funding to expand to
Gallup, but we didn't quite get enough
applicants to make that work.
And so it's on our path to
find ways to reach those communities
and work with the people across the State
to get them introduced to the
field and drive that stem
engagement when it's critical
for the decisions they're making on what to
do with their future.
Uh In addition, uh we
want to make sure that after Q camp they
have the next step. And we're really
excited to be working with Central
New Mexico Community College
on launching the first of its
kind in the country, hands-on
learning lab uh
for community
colledge students and those looking to
reskill and get
certificates.
Um In addition
to the, the elevate
quantum hub, which will um
allocate millions of dollars to
support that and get the advanced
systems needed up and
running. Uh We've been able to
work with partners across
the State. And we're evaluating
ways to work with N
MS U and Navajo Tech and New
Mexico Tech and UN M
uh in partnership with
CNM to provide those
training opportunities that are critical
and often get missed.
Um And then of
course, we have to talk through a bachelor's
and graduate programs. So we
have our amazing traditional and
higher education pathways
uh programs at each of
the three institute, uh the major
research institutions with U and M
and MS U New Mexico Tech.
Um But also the,
the summer programs where we can
bring students across the
State. Uh again, to get
that critical hands-on learning
opportunity for these really awesome
amazing advanced technologies
that you don't get to see
elsewhere.
And lastly, I wanted to just
briefly mention that
with the, the elevate quantum
award, we're standing up to elevate quantum
workforce collaborative where
we're working with school districts,
with nonprofits, with others
to find ways to reach the
communities and get them
engaged. Uh New
Mexico is helping lead the front
on all of these because we've piloted
these amazing programs
and Colorado wants them.
Uh And they're awesome partners.
We're super excited to be expanding
out there, but they've been built
here just like the foundations
for the rest of, you know, the the
quantum field
slide 13.
So we have the R and
D, we have the
workforce. What we
need is industry
and that industry engagement is
critical.
New Mexico checks all
the boxes, right. I
I included here a quote from one
of our industry partners called
Continuum. A start
up of 500 people
who are building
quantum computers right
now. And, and they
see that we have it all, they,
we have the ecosystem,
we, we have the expertise
and they want to work with us
and we see it as our job
to make the, the
community and the ecosystem
to draw them here.
And, and so through Q and M,
we're looking at ways that we can drive
economic development by supporting
entrepreneurs and by
building on those relationships
that we have with folks like
quantum um
from the the start
ups and the folks who are building the
picks and shovels for quantum
building the lasers all
the way through those like Google and
Microsoft who are
gonna be providing the
solutions and we
have those relationships
and students from U and M are
running a lot of those companies, but they've
left and we'd like to bring them
back. We also
want to expand capacity
um through quantum information
or quantum infrastructure
initiatives. Uh We need
to be able to build that here to
maintain the technology, to
maintain our edge and
take advantage of the world class
fabrication facilities that
Sandia offers through our mesa
uh fabrication
foundries.
Um And at the core
of everything we do, we want
this to be equitable, we need
to ensure that communities across
the State are able to
engage with us. And
so we're doing that through our workforce
development. We're doing that through
intentional partnerships
and, and industry is interested
in working with us on this.
So we need to really capitalize
on this elevate quantum opportunity
and, and uh deliver
to the Economic Development
Administration. Um
And we believe that through that
we can really find
anchor tenants for our
quantum industry uh to
start growing in New
Mexico. And with that,
I'll pass it to Doctor
Raan.
>> Thank you. You can
proceed. OK,
please go on to slide
14.
Doctor Deutsch
Mr. Douglas and I are here
today with
a common message.
New Mexico
is poised to launch
a new economic
sector based
on quantum information
technology and
we need to work together
to make this happen.
The legislature
has a unique and essential
role in
early phase nurturing
of that sector.
Using the next three
slides I will discuss
how we see all of that coming
together.
Slide 14. The first
topic is elevate
quantum
elevate quantum
is a mountain West
Regional
Consortium made
up of 100 and 20
partners focused on
advancing quantum
technologies and
boosting the regional quantum
economic ecosystem.
The goal of elevate
quantum is to
keep the mountain West
on top for the quantum
century. And
that flows from our fundamental
premise that quantum
technologies
will be as important
to the upcoming
century
as semiconductors
in the internet were to
the prior
century.
As Dr Deutsch
said, we think this
is something that
works with other
technologies,
supercharging artificial
intelligence and of
comparable impact
and comparable excitement in the
technical communities.
Many researchers at our
institutions share
this view and have enormous
enthusiasm for being part of
this exciting field
uh as indicated in the
graphics, the map, the
tables and logos on
uh slide. 14
many organizations of many
kinds from across the
region have come together
to form the elevate quantum
Consortium
government. So
it's State Federal
tribal
industry, many
companies, educational
institutions from all
three states uh have
come together.
The the regional
span for elevate quantum is
the mountain West
with support from states
of Wyoming, Colorado
and New Mexico
partners from across the
State include
our home institutions
but also importantly
others. University,
New Mexico State
University, Central New
Mexico Community College,
the Economic Development Department of
the State Star Cry
Electronics, which is a small high
tech company in Santa
Fe
on July 2nd, there was an
important announcement for all of
us and that was the
selection of elevate
quantum as a phase
two tech hub. And
that unlocked 100 and
$27 million of
funding for quantum
economic development in our
region.
40.5 from
the federal government from the
uh Economic Development
Department, 76
million from the State of
Colorado, mostly
in the form of incentives
and of course
pending appropriate
approvals uh and
appropriation $10
million from the State of New
Mexico. This
is a historic win
for our region and for the
State. Uh and
it really has created the
mountain West
as the tech hub
for the United States and the
entire category of quantum
technology. We
are of course extremely excited
about this
New Mexico will play a
critical role in
executing this work
and making the tech
hub come into fruition.
We will be establishing
laboratories and fabrication
facilities near the
University of New Mexico main
campus aimed at
accelerating quantum technology
commercialization.
New Mexico will also
co-lead uh the
workforce development programming
across our region through this
effort. None of
this would be possible
without support from the State
of New Mexico.
Uh In particular, I
want to note the support of the office
of the Governor, the Economic
Development Department which
were crucial to winning phase two
tech A uh
designation.
Some of the support
for this comes through a
particular uh
mechanism, the Technology
Enhancement Fund uh
for which we of course have to
thank the legislature,
the Higher Education
Department and the Economic
Development Department uh for
coordinating and managing and
creating that
mechanism.
So we have lots to do in this
project, the elevate quantum
project. Uh It's
going to bring a lot of things
together. Uh But we
are also at the same time looking
ahead to the next major
opportunity. In this case,
a major opportunity for federal
funding as panelists.
Uh Prior to us, we're
discussing there are
opportunities for National
Science Foundation
Regional Innovation
Engines funded
above $100 million
up to 100 and $60
million. And we are
intending to submit a proposal
along the uh along
those lines. Uh
I in only the next few
weeks, uh Our
goal is to secure more
federal resources that will
boost the quantum
technology and quantum
economic ecosystems
for the State and our region.
Uh And the focus of
this particular
NSF
Reine that elevate quantum and all
of us are supporting
as the, as
as its center quantum
technology for the
twin goals
of economic security
and national security.
We believe this will have a big
payoff, but we also
are absolutely certain that we
cannot do this without
support from the State of New
Mexico
switch on to the slide
15.
So as Jake said, we have all
the ingredients for
quantum economic ecosystem
except capital
and companies.
We need a significant
presence of companies
in the State. In the quantum
technology area.
A high tech ecosystem
requires research
and development, innovation,
infrastructure,
education, workforce
development, customers
capital and
companies.
So the thing we need to do is
attract the parts we don't
have. That's part of
why we're here. How do we make all
that happen? It's a chicken
and egg problem and we'll come
to that. So New Mexico
can attract capital,
bring in existing quantum
companies create new
quantum enterprises. And
they're basically three ingredients
incentives, infrastructure
investments in crowding
in quantum
quantum companies want to be
here. They want to be in
New Mexico because of the
educational workforce
and research environment. They
want to be connected with our schools
and our labs. Uh
the closer the connection, the
better, the tighter the
communication, the better uh
the more feedback, the
better they will be.
Uh And now
you know, this is because of the
crowding in factor.
Now, I thought that was a buzz
phrase,
right? It
is OK.
But it's also real.
And our efforts in
quantum, New Mexico
and elevate quantum have led
me to really feel and believe
that that is. So
the economic
development administration's
tech hub opportunity
created the right
kind of incentive that
brought us all together
and that allowed us to create something
that was much bigger
than the sum of its parts
so that crowding in is
real. And it is one of the
critical ingredients that we need
and we need your help to make
more of that happen.
Now, early phase nurturing
of the new Mexico quantum economic
ecosystem is necessary
to overcome what I mentioned before, sort
of a chicken and egg problem.
And it also has to be there
to help develop the
interconnections. An
ecosystem is
a complex web of things
that are all interact with each
other in ways that are not
predictable, not thought
of ahead of time, but must
happen for it to be healthy and
function. We want to
get to that place where all of those
things are there. We know we
can't do that without your support.
A critical element of
this is a
quantum campus.
And the purpose of of the quantum
campus is through
collocation
cooperation and crowding
in to solve
that chicken and egg problem for the
quantum economy
in the State of New
Mexico
quantum New Mexico has been
building the partnerships
needed for
doing this since 2021.
And we feel that now is the
time for investment
in the New Mexico quantum future.
In this way, our
vision for the quantum campus
pulls together and co
locates three critical
things, the education
and workforce development
aspects, the
translational research
and technology development. So that's
getting things out of our
laboratories and
into commercial
commercial action.
And then of course private
companies in
the same campus with the
other things, both small
companies and start-ups
and big existing companies
that are in the quantum
realm.
And why, why is all this
necessary it's to
complete the New
Mexico the the new
Mexico translational
ecosystem in this area
to create high-value
jobs
unify our workforce
development efforts with
world-leading programming
and advanced facilities
and enable entrepreneurial
and industry growth.
All of this is designed
to create a global competitive
advantage for the State of New
Mexico.
All right, let me just wrap
things up. We can look
bring up the last slide
slide
16.
I'm gonna just try to summarize the
things that we just
said. New Mexico
is a research
and technology development
leader in
quantum information science and
technology and has
been for decades,
quantum information
technologies will have a
profound
impact on the
future.
We think they will be as important
to the future to the upcoming
century as
semiconductors
and the internet words the last
100 years,
we have all the ingredients
for quantum economic
ecosystem except
companies and capital,
bringing those things
in. We think will come
through infrastructure
investments
incentives,
crowding in
other states are doing these
things as Mr.
Douglas noted and there's a map
on slide nine.
you can see what the scale
of the investments are
and what kind of things
other states are doing.
Building quantum
facilities,
expanding and
focusing tax
incentives,
creating loan guarantee
mechanisms,
updating the authorities
of their agencies.
So those agencies can do
more and do more
focused things.
You can imagine similar
actions in the State of New
Mexico at a similar
scale to be
competitive. We will
need comparable investment
for achieving such
success. This
will be important for securing
the next scale of
federal funding as
the example, 100 and
$60 million
as our target for an
NSF Regional
Innovation Engine.
So your support
in that direction will be
critical.
Those things together
will set the State up
for even greater
success in the quantum
information science and
technology economy.
We've laid the groundwork and
established a lot of the partnerships.
The time is now to
build a quantum campus
for the State of New Mexico,
develop a comprehensive
set of incentives
capitalize on the momentum
of recent successes
and create a competitive advantage
for our State. I'll
leave you with a final
thought. New
Mexico is a quantum
State. Thank you
very much that concludes our
presentation. We
appreciate the
opportunity.
>> Thank you very much for your
uh presentations. We've
got um
three people on the list
so far. Representative Art de
La Cruz, you are first.
Then we have Sandra Gonzalez and
Representative MEREDITH
Dixon.
>> Thank you madam
Chair.
It it seems to me
and
you know, this is all fairly new to
all of us. I imagine
certainly not being
researchers. The
first time I heard of quantum
computing was on a piece
that was done by 60 minutes. I don't
know if you saw that.
Um And
it appears that we're moving
swiftly into
a an arms race
around.
I don't mean that literally but
figuratively
not un not unlike the
development of the atomic bomb that
Oppenheimer much
regretted. And
I remember in the
piece that I saw that
the developer of
A I, I believe he was out
of,
out of England
um
regretted A I as
well. I
I know that
we almost have
no choice
but to mov'e forward aggressively
to try to
develop, you know,
the most effective quantum
computing available
on the planet.
And I understand the Chinese
are just a little ahead of
us.
We talk about all the positivity,
but I I think it's also important to
understand that there
there also is a
great potential for
some very bad
things to happen.
Can you
address that a little bit? What,
what are, what are the
potential
downsides
besides all the
positive sides? I think that
matters because I think
we have to know
that at the same time that
we're doing this development, that
there are going to be protocols
that matter to control
this potential
entity.
>> Madam Chair
representative. Thank you for
the question.
There are downsides to
all kinds of technological
developments. We are
keenly aware of
those, we're
aware of those current
discussions for
artificial intelligence. A
I many
considerations from the time
of Oppenheimer to today
with regard to nuclear
technology. So
we are keenly aware of these
things. One
of the ones that is a particular
note for us
is the role
of current
technology and
future technology
for secure communication.
Now, you might think, oh I'm
talking about defense
applications, that's part of
it. But every time you do a bank
transaction you want that to be
secured. So I
would say that the key thing
here is
that we have a dual
wor, a dual world, we
can look at quantum
science and technology
can both be a way
by which
codes are current, codes
are
decrypted.
And it's also a
technological method
by which we can make
things uh secure
and impervious to
decryption we are
working on both. So
we have to be a we have
to be cognizant of what
the future potential is
for decryption
and for secure
encryption. Those
are the two big ones
where we see sort of a dual
activity. Now let me give you
another one where we are
actively
concerned
about the long
term impacts.
So we are often
asked about our development
model and
a quick thing that people
look to is, are you trying to
make the new Silicon
Valley?
No, we're trying to make the better
Silicon Valley. OK.
Because the the entire
enterprise of 20th
century development for the Silicon
Valley was a
concentration
of the
benefits,
not a wide
distribution of
all the economic benefits.
And we're really actively
engaged in making sure that
this new quantum
technology economy
doesn't become a means by
which uh power
and and economic advantage
are narrowly
narrowly benefiting one
sector, one part
of our State. One
part of the population of the
world over
another.
So
>> thank you madam Chair
and, and representative for your question.
And maybe I can add a little
bit more to that.
You know, one of the things
about
research is
sometimes you, you don't know
where it's going to go.
Uh You know, we are
as a researcher, often
curiosity driven
and new
knowledge develops and the
technology development
goes in directions that are
unanticipated.
I think it's important
that we're having this
conversation and
this conversation
continues
between
innovators
and policymakers
so that
we are kept informed
with one another
and we can keep ahead of that
curve a little bit
and not be surprised
when all of a sudden
there is a technology
that we
feel
May not be the
best thing for our
society or needs to
be regulated in a
particular way.
So I think the
conversation
between the
research community and
policymakers like yourselves.
It's important to keep this
conversation going.
So because we don't,
we can't look in a crystal
ball, we don't know
what the future will be.
But the the the
more conversation we have,
the more we can make
good, try to make the best
decisions possible
together.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
It it seems
to me that if
you have
a mechanism that can
access some total of
all human knowledge
coupled with the idea
that they can access and
that's what encryptions about, right,
access into things
into.
I don't even have the words
but but it will
access all
information, all
things that are locked
that are that, that it can
access.
Doesn't it also have
the the the potential
for the reverse side of that
to keep
people out of
what it's
doing.
Madam Chair
>> madam Chair
representative. Yes,
exactly. So
and so our institutions
and our colleagues are working
on quantum
communication as Doctor
Deutsch said, this
is the securing
of information in a fashion
that is secure against
decryption
that is currently in
use. Uh And this is
based on using the laws of
physics themselves to
protect this
information. Uh
This is work where Los
Alamos, our colleague
institutions have done
pioneering work
and where we are
soon to be stretching the boundaries
of that. It's also an area
where for the State of New
Mexico. What
what one of our ambitions
is is to work closely
with the Office of Broadband
Solutions so that
we can try to develop
the infrastructure
model for
sharing quantum information
and using quantum
encryption, quantum based
encryption much more
widely than it has been done
before. Right now.
It's a niche
laboratory, a few
companies, big government
agency kind of thing.
Uh It's something that if
we're moving into the quantum
world with
quantum technology,
we want to be able to share
quantum resources and the
advantages of quantum
capabilities across
the State. And so that's something
that we're actively engaged in
using all of those
tools technology and
physics to secure
information in ways that we
don't know.
>> Thank you. Lastly madam
Chair.
Can you
help us picture the
difference
because I understand that A I
is child's play compared to
quantum computing. But
can you help us understand that
a little
better
>> quantum technology
is a kind
of different
way of processing
information
that uses
the physics at the microscopic
scale.
And the physics at the
microscopic scale is
different than just say the
motion of the planets that
new Newton
envisioned in in
the 17th century
or before.
Uh
and it
gives
us
and it's not
that everything is going to be
changed by a quantum
computer.
There are some
tasks that quantum
computers are
excellent at
and some that
the current supercomputers
will be continue to be
better at. And
we're still researching
where quantum computers will
have those
special advantages. One of
those places that we we
think is particularly
important is
in medicine.
So drug
design is sort of
done by trial and error
you know, this compound,
that compound.
But the
molecules at that
microscopic scale,
if we can simulate
them and model them,
we can't do that
efficiently.
Even with A I,
I mean, we do it
and we do it pretty
well but with a
quantum computer,
it will change
and we will be able to
really do
drug discovery and
develop new materials.
Uh So I think
the things that quantum
computer isn't
a, it's, it's
has some niche areas
that will really make a difference
that we hope are,
are things that can help
our society and help
and do for, for
good. Um
But I think
uh in terms of artificial
intelligence,
well, that's a big question.
Quantum machine learning
is an active error
research and we
do think that that is
something that will become
particularly important and
something that we do need to keep our eyes
on as well
for reasons
representative that, that you
mentioned, I think it's quite
important that
when as we race ahead,
we also keep
this conversation happening
as frequently as possible
to make sure that we're also
understanding the needs
of our State and
beyond and as well
to help share that
information with you best
we can possibly do.
Thank you, madam
Chair.
>> Thank you very
much. We are going to Senator
Gonzalez and my list has grown
here. So
we have Senator Gonzalez representative
MEREDITH Dixon Sandra
Shen, representative
Sarinana and Representative
Herndon. So
Senator Gonzalez, >> thank
you. Madam Chair. And with that in
mind, I'll respect the
time.
Um, first of
all, this is
really very, very
interesting
and, uh, I wish
that our percentage from
this morning in education
would be here because
that's exactly what
we're looking at is
what can excite
students to be
in school. You
know, and when it comes to
technology it
doesn't matter what students, they're
very much, very much
into it. You know, they,
they can really do a
lot.
Um I
really feel that,
um, you know, as much
as um with
your presentation, we
probably would need like a week
of this to really get
into really
into the depth of
it and working
with it. And
one of the questions that I
did have and you answered
it a little bit before
is on the medical
part and
I think there is so much
need for that,
that, you know,
how do we work with
that? And then
the other part is that
looking at the map that
you have in
all the other
states that are
involved. So
when it comes to the economic
development, does
that put us in a position
that we're in competition?
And if we're all
driving to economic
development, you
know, I see it as, as
competitive.
Um and, and I'll just
go through a few more things and
then you can react as a
whole.
Uh the other is
so,
so
I guess at different
levels,
would this lead
to any
patents,
you know, and,
uh, and the last
part that I would ask you
is, um,
when you're talking
about the
outreach,
so how does a little
school like
Penasco
approach you or you
approach them,
you know, to get involved or to
get something into this?
And it's very fascinating.
It really is, you know, and
this is what I've
been saying all along with one
of our problems with education
is we have to go
back to
today's world. And
what is the future?
And you know, how can we
excite students to be in
school? And I
think like this is,
this is one of the things
that are very, very
much like I'm saying, I wish they
were still here. So
I'll let you respond to any of those
parts and then I'll pass it on to our
next
person
to
>> Mr. Chair woman
uh Senator. Thank you.
Um So I, I wanted to
touch on a few different
um aspects of the
question. So, so first is,
is the investments by the other
states. Um
And so we
are absolutely competing with
others um
in, in some ways. But
this is an area
where New Mexico is truly
differentiated
and we have the
foundational assets
and the people and the
expertise
where with
the, the partnerships,
especially with Colorado.
Um and the region,
we have the
competitive advantage
to be able to
capture, you know,
various areas of quantum
technology markets as as they're
coming out. Um
The, the partnership
with Colorado for the Ed A
tech hub shows
how we can work with other
ecosystems, especially
regionally relevant
ecosystems to attract
big federal dollars.
And the the other
piece of this is quantum
technology is still very nascent.
We still have a few years
in, in some ways to
get to the applications, but others are
here right now. Uh
And the the field is
expected to grow
significantly, right? So
Microsoft started in New Mexico
and they went elsewhere and that's
a huge field, right? And if we're at a
similar point now where quantum
can start here and
the State can see the economic
impact, uh we will be
competing. Uh But we
also have partnerships and,
and we're well positioned to be
very successful in those
competitions.
Um I I also wanted to quickly
touch on the question
about how to engage with
small schools. And
so if we, if we go to slide
2021
in the appendix. Uh we,
we talk a little bit about Q camp,
right? So this is our, our,
our summer
camps to introduce quantum
concepts. Uh It's not
only high school teachers and
students uh but
also um middle
school and we're trying to find ways to
engage with elementary schools.
And so I mentioned in June, we
held our teacher camp
um and it
was 60%
from urban settings, 40%
from rural settings.
Um We had uh
60% of
female engagement.
Um We had
95% were stem
teachers, but we are also
exploring opportunities to
work with language,
arts in other areas and using quantum
for writing or things of
that nature. And, and
we're doing, we're, we're
working as best we can to
connect with those communities across
the State and understand what's relevant
for them, what's culturally
relevant, what's relevant for
their communities? And how can we
introduce that? How can
we bring the expertise available
for this really complicated field
to, to build out the resources
for the communities that we really want to work
with? And that's, and that's across the
State. So, so how to get
connected with that? Um
You know, we did as much outreach as
we possibly could. Uh We need
to do better on
partnerships with uh various
school districts or maybe some of the,
the educational partners
we work with nonprofits
already. So the Computer Science
Alliance is one that helped us actually
launch this program a few years
ago. Um And they've
continued to be strong partners in
helping us prepare materials.
The teachers can take into the
classroom directly without having to
do a lot of extra work uh
to do that since they're already
overburdened. Um
So I wanted to make sure to
touch on those two points and
that we're being very intentional in trying to
bring the others out. Um
And this, this Q camp
program that we have is
really nation leading.
Um We expanded our
camp out to, to five
other states this year because there is such
strong demand and they paid for it
themselves. Uh And we
just took the, the learning
aspects of it to them
and, and we want to make sure that we're
doing justice here in New
Mexico. Um
and, and reaching the communities that we
can uh as that
continues to scale and
grow.
>> Uh Thank you,
I'll add to what
Mr. Douglas said. Let me
talk about first about patents.
Yes. Uh Yes, Senator,
we have many patents. All of
our institutions have had
patents in this field.
Uh We've just filed
one recently uh
in the area of quantum photonic
technology
of a Los Alamos
uh for provisional
patent. And
then I want to go on to the topic
of uh medical.
Uh so as, as Dr
Deutsch noted the
design of
molecules and
pharmaceuticals will
be greatly speeded
up and improved
through quantum computing.
We're really pretty sure
that that's one where there will be a
big impact. Second
one I want to hit on
is using quantum
sensing
for uh medical
applications. We have a
team at Los Alamos working
on exactly this
for uh
magnetoencephalography
and magnetic resonance
imaging and improving
that with imaging
capabilities that we're
working on right now.
Uh Let me add one
last one. This is on the
medical and
social impact
area. We've had a
recent discovery
uh in some of our labs
using a uh a quantum
technique
quadruple resonance for
people who want to look at that nuclear
quadruple resonance. Uh
and arguably
important tantum
sensing method for
detection of fentaNYL in a
recent discovery in that area.
So we are working on these things.
We are highly engaged.
All of our institutions are
highly motivated to
do societally relevant
art re research and
development and the
application of quantum technology.
Thank you very
much.
>> Uh Very well. Thank
you. Thank you very much.
And uh I do have some other
questions but in respect
to the time element,
you know, I probably will be
reaching to,
you know, to you uh
later to for
further information.
But again, this is very
exciting, it's very
thought the way it was
presented and
I really feel that New
Mexico can be a big part of
this. Thank you.
>> All right. Thank you very much. We're
gonna mov'e on to Representative
MEREDITH Dixon here. Next
Thank you for your patience.
>> Representative.
Thank you madam Chair
and thank you Senator Gonzalez.
I don't know that I'm gonna be
quite as nice in deferring
my questions.
Um uh
This I think has
been a fascinating presentation
and one that I
am so glad we're having
now um as we
talk about diversifying
the economy and where New
Mexico really has a competitive
advantage. So thank you. I
did not know all of the
history um
of quantum here in New
Mexico.
Um I have a couple of
questions
um
first
and I think this is
elaborated on in the
appendices, but um
I just discovered it.
Um Could you talk a little
bit more about the role of
CNM um
in this partnership
and how, how
you all work together to
develop the
workforce,
>> madam chairwoman representative?
Um Yeah, we're, we're
very, very excited to
be to be working with
CNM on creating
again a first of its
client quantum
learning lab that's going to be in
close partnership with Brian Rash
up uh who leads the
ingenuity program. And as
you alluded to slide 22
in the appendices kind of covers us a
little bit where
experts from
Sandia are
going to work hand in hand
with CNM to help
develop new training
courses uh to
help train the workforce uh
of our industry partners that,
that, that there's such high
demand for right now.
So we're gonna be focused on things
like optics and photonics
and vacuums systems and things of that
nature. Um to,
to do both kind of 10
week uh short term
programs that can lead to certificates
and, and lead to direct jobs
right away. And again, these are very high-value
jobs um A as
well as finding ways to get it
into the community colledge
system. Uh Writ
large, uh as I mentioned
earlier, we're working with
universities across the
to bring researchers in
students in uh and
find ways where we can leverage
this facility which will have very
high tech equipment that's expensive
and hard to get, especially in,
you know, rural communities, things like
that. So students can come in
and learn about it and, and play
with it directly, which
is often the thing that
keeps them from getting a job is that
lack of, of expertise and
experience. Um
Additionally, CNM is gonna
be uh leading
major projects
within elevate quantum
itself. And so they're, they're
one of 20 CO
applicants. Uh
The Cu Boulder,
Colorado University Boulder
is the other. And so
CNM is really gonna be a nation
leader in this technology and
they're helping us bring together
partners uh across
the ecosystem to work with the
communities that were really
striving to
engage.
>> That's thank you so much
madam Chair
and Mr. Douglas, one
of the things that I appreciate about
that is that this
is a skill and
workforce
uh that can be
applied around the State,
particularly for some
of our um communities
that are going through
transition.
Um So
I appreciate you highlighting
that and the role of
CNM.
Um Other
question um
I believe uh this might
be for uh Mr.
Raban or any
of you. However, you want to do that.
Um I want to talk about
the campus
and I,
you've got that on page
15.
One of the things that
um I
have been becoming
more aware of is
the importance of
collocation
and
why
it is important. But I'm
hoping that
you three as
experts and
having put this in the
proposal could really
elaborate
for
us legislators as
to why it is
so important
that this is a
component
of the project and
how the State
can be a good partner in
this.
>> All right. Uh Thank
you madam, Chair
Representative Dixon.
Uh We, we want to
emphasize the concepts
of cooperation, colo
location and crowding in
uh the reasons quantum
companies want to be
in New Mexico is because
of the things we have to
offer the
people, the
the institutions, the
researchers, the
technology, uh
the workforce. And so
we're trying to find a way where we
can bring all of those things under
one roof so that there
can be powerful
energies among those
things. So that the
the the
students in the
classroom, getting special
training, you know, in the
workforce development arena
are seeing what is
happening in the companies,
the companies are connected
to the lab,
researchers who have new
technology that is
coming to fruition that
we can use something
like a quantum
campus as also
a central
component of
statewide quantum
networking where we reach
across the State and try to
bring everyone together.
These are the things that we see
happening. And so it's that
synergy that crowding
in that we think is very
real.
Uh
>> Madam Chairwoman Representative
Dixon, thank you. So, so I
just wanted to, to
emphasize uh the, the
fact that this is still a nascent
technology and one that is
very advanced. Uh
And one where we've been
able to build the facilities
and the fabrication capabilities
to make multiple
quantum devices across
all the technology areas. And that's
unique in the world. And
our partners are trying to find
ways to work with us to, to
get access to that
expertise, to be
able to, to build these quantum
systems and get them commercialized.
Uh And we believe again the
partnership piece, the, the,
the reason our three institutions
are here today uh that we're
working so hard to pull in other communities
across the State. Uh It's
critical to have that, that
home and that landing place to
be the convenor uh to
be able to, to bring the people
together and have the conversations
needed uh both
uh you know, kind of on the R and D
side. But again, bringing the
students together and, and, and
others. And so I
think that the partnership
piece, the fact that we'll need
very high tech facilities
to make these exquisite
devices, things of that nature,
which is currently
at our institutions. But
we want to get out of the labs
and something like this would allow us
to, to do
that.
>> Thank you madam Chair and
Representative Dixon for the
question. Uh I
also want to add about
collation relative
to the Cuanta New Mexico
Institute, which
is a joint
institute that is
being stood up between
U and M Sandia and
Los Alamos. And having
us co located
as researchers
and innovators will be
critical to
continuing this momentum.
You know, we can't eat the, see only
the seed corre and we have to keep
investing for the future
and the next revolution
which we're gonna spark.
Uh And so having
us co located
and in a location
that is co located with
our industry partners will
create uh
I think an
unparalleled
uh um
place. Uh We
see some collation
happening in other
states. Uh But
we think this one will
with the with the
elevate quantum
ed A
foundation as well.
I think bringing that all together
will really will, you
know, I've overuse the word
supercharging.
So thank you for your question. Thank
you madam Chair.
>> Thank you. Um One
last question and then I'll wrap it
up um on
page 10 of the
presentation um
in little tiny
print, there's
uh there are a couple of
numbers figures
talk um
describing um
the number of start ups
in quantum computing
quantum communication and
sensing. And I was
just wondering um if
anyone has an idea
of how many of those or
how many um
quantum companies
do we have in New
Mexico
>> madam Chair and representative.
So
as it stands uh
from, from my point of view,
we have one quantum company in New
Mexico right now. Uh and
it's star Cryo electronics
and it's, it's one of the enabling
technology supply chain
companies. Uh We
have partnerships
with uh almost every
industry partner out there.
Um But they're
not here in the State. And so
one of the goals here is to be able to
bring them here, support the
entrepreneurial ecosystem
and, and build out that
third leg for the State
here.
>> Thank you so much. Um Sorry
madam Chair, I just have
one little follow up on that
um which is for the
entrepreneurs and talking about
the ecosystem.
Um I'd love
and you could follow up with me
some of the incentives that you
mentioned other states
are doing to support
the entrepreneurship. I'd love to
hear some of those.
Um If they're at the tip
of your tongue, that's great. Otherwise
I can
wait,
>> madam, Chair Representative
Dixon. Uh So
there's a whole set of
things that can be done.
And if we look at that chart
on page nine, the map, uh
we can in particular, like
decode the one for the State of
Colorado because we
worked with them at
about the same time that they
passed that Legislation.
And so it, that's a mixture of
straight up tax incentives
locate here, do certain
things and we will
cut your taxes. It, it
is also straight
up uh
actions that are similar
to what our tech
transfer arms of our big
labs can do or that
economic development department
of the State can do
where there can
be uh funds provided
to a company provided.
They do certain things, locate
in the State, hire a certain number
of employees and
this reduces the
barrier, reduces their
operating costs
for locating here or
starting here. Uh
There's also uh
in some of these packages,
specific ones for start-ups
of new companies.
And then the last one is the
loan guarantees. I
really want to get to that one
because I actually, I'd love to
be a bank that
seems like the thing to
be. And I'd love to
see the equivalent of a
bank uh for the
State of New Mexico that can
mov'e into this area. So the
loan guarantees are partial
loan guarantees
for the State of
Colorado just enacted in
Legislation this
spring. It it is
the power of fractional reserve
banking that gives them
an enormous leverage
that they think is going to allow
them to backstop
or partially backstop
an enormous amount
of loans from,
from regular
banks that the
State of Colorado then
is acting as a partial
guarantor for.
Again, those companies
have to meet certain criteria. They have
to be working in the right
technology area. They have to employ
a certain number of people. Uh they
have to stay in business in a certain
way. So that's very
exciting. Uh
In addition to that there is the
direct, you know,
example State of
Illinois and you know, they haven't
broken ground, right?
So there's a, there's a lot
of talking
but uh less
action, right? But they,
they have committed to
having the State of
Illinois
build a
quantum campus
and you know, you can look at
their architect uh
or art artistic
renderings. Uh This
looks like a big, a big
thing they wanna do. They're
also at least
talking about co
locating that
with one of their
national laboratories,
how they pull that off
with the Energy Department and the other
organizations is an open
question. Uh But I
think this is all possible.
Thank you very much.
May >> I? Uh so, so
sorry madam Chair representative,
I do want to make one other quick
note on that slide. So,
so what we listed out here are
quantum specific investments
only uh and they're
publicly available. So, so
there's probably other information out there
and we're more than happy to get uh
with our teams and information to
you. Uh For example, that
Virginia funded
$250
million to fund a new
Innovation campus where quantum
is a piece of that, but we did not
include it in here since it's not quantum
specific. So um
we'll get with our teams and get more
information to you. Thank you.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Thank you. All right, Senator
Chando, you are next.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank
you for the presentation. This is a
pretty exciting. I've been
kind of following this
uh over the last
few months. Uh
Some of you May know,
I have a role at the University of
Colorado as my alma mater.
And uh
uh and I
was reading an article that appeared
in the uh Colorado Cu
today on July 2nd that
announced the
uh the Alibe Quantum uh
partnership for
the uh 127 million
regional project that
you guys talked about. And, and that
article, it stated
that, you know, Ed A was
providing 4.5
million, of course, Colorado with
their taxes sentence
at 77 million and,
and New Mexico at 10
million. I was
thinking, I don't remember us
ever
providing that.
And then I look at this
presentation and there's
10 million with an
asterisk. So
is that, you know,
can you explain, you know, was
that part of the proposal as
something that we
were looking at as an investment
if we get it or was
it already in the budget
somewhere? Uh
because I was
trying to figure out
through our budget
process. I don't ever
remember a $10 million
appropriation to elevate
quantum anyway, but
madam Chair, I was just
curious.
>> Thank you, madam Chair,
Senator.
Uh you are
correct. It has an
asterisk. OK. Uh
We have
uh support from
Economic Development
Department and
uh a joint letter
uh uh
pledging this
funding from the
State of New Mexico
signed by the Governor.
Uh and these
are contingent on,
of course, the legislative
process for approval
and appropriation. So
we listed there
because we have
the indications
from other
arms of the State government.
But we know it hasn't
been been worked through
here. Now that
funding is also through
the TEF
I forget what that stands for
without looking at
technology enhancement fund
and how that
is managed and mediated.
I'd have to refer
to our University of New
Mexico partners
in Government Affairs for how that's
managed or their VP RS
office.
mhm.
>> Yes, I
can speak to that. So I think
so in the
proposal, only
5 million
was uh
put in uh that
was the 5 million that was
secured through higher education
TEF Fund. And that
was uh
discussed through our office
of the Vice President of
research, the
additional uh 5
million that we
um we'd
like hope to see
uh discussed and
in the next Session
is aspirational.
Uh and, but
we uh we hope that,
you know, we can secure those
additional funds now that this award
has been made >> Ok,
appreciate it. Thank you madam Chair.
So
I, I guess you guys will come up
with what that 5
million will be about, whether
it's direct funding, whether it's
tax incentives or whatever
that plays out madam Chair with
that.
>> That's correct. I think there is
some direct funding that for
some of the projects that
we'd like to carry out,
especially in the workforce
development as well as
uh the new facilities
that are being built
uh in in in
the new campus there.
Uh These are funds that I think
are are would be very
useful in terms of us. Realizing
the vision for
elevate.
>> Did you have a
common? >> Uh
Yeah, I I was just gonna add
that our, our University of
New Mexico partners are are going to
be running through that uh
with uh
the New Mexico Economic Development
Department and the, the Governor's
office where we've partnered
very closely with them. They're
serving. Um Alex
Greenberg is serving on the
board of the elevate quantum
group. Uh And so
those institutions will be
leading the charge.
>> Um Also in your
report, you
uh
I believe I can't remember what page
it is but partnerships you
include tribes in
there is
that are all the partners
listed somewhere.
I think you listed 32 or
whatever partners.
>> Uh Yes. Um
So those partners
are all the elevate quantum
consortium Members and
they're listed on the elevate
quantum website,
which I believe is elevate quantum.org
uh, but we can get
that information with the team
and, and get it to you after the presentation
if you'd like. >> I appreciate that.
And I think, you know,
we talk a lot
about State in Mexico investment
and so forth. You know, in my
earlier days I worked in the College
of Engineering at UN M
with the Native American program in the
College of Engineering trying to get more
native students
uh in stem fields
and so forth. And I hope that
as you develop this, that we
currently do the outreach,
you know, to the rural parts of
our, our State. And we
also, I also ran the uh
what, what was then funded
by Air Force was the Air Force
introduction to engineering.
And, and this
is for all kids, not just
native kids, but we were bringing kids
from all over the State,
both native non-native
black Hispanics,
african-american,
whomever uh to
one week uh camps
every Sunday, we would get
40 kids and then stay for
a week we expose them to
and these are all uh rising
eighth graders.
Uh uh and it was
a really unique program that
we ran there and I was
api on that project
and uh I, I
think we produced quite a bit
of uh uh
engineering students out of that
program. Uh They went
on not only at UN M but
tech N MS U
and other places and somewhat out
of State. Uh just
the exposure early on
before they got into high school, I
think, really captivated.
And I think as we're struggling
with how we, you know,
uh motivate
kids. I think this
is one area
uh when I was in colledge
back in the eighties there at cu
I had a friend that was in quantum
mechanics. I had no idea what he was
talking about. Uh I was
in a business school and,
and he would describe what's going
on and, and uh
I said that's
too,
that's too small of a scale for me to
understand. I don't, I, I don't
get it, but I've always
had an interest, I guess just for
my friends studying,
you know, quantum physics and quantum
mechanics and things like that. And,
and now,
uh
you know, with, with the,
with what's going on in
today's society and where it's leading.
I, I think it's exciting and I
think we're right
there in the uh
in, in the mountain West, you
know, uh and, and it's
exper uh pretty exciting
to see, but I just hope that as
we expand
opportunities for
workforce development for young
kids and all of that, that we
truly reach out to
all, all citizens of New
Mexico and give them the opportunity.
So
I don't know if anybody want to respond.
But uh
>> thank you madam Chair and thank you
Senator. I think
we, we very much and
part of Quanta New
Mexico's goal is
to make this
a statewide initiative,
all parts of the State and all
peoples and
to really ensure our
outreach reaches
everyone and
and inspires
people also to,
you know, if
this is exciting, you know, maybe quantum
physics seems a little crazy
but quantum computing, it might
sound, you know,
ant man or it's something
that you know gets people
connected and
we're very cognizant of
this and we want to ensure
that what we're doing
really impacts
hopefully in a
positive way broadly
across the State. So
thank you for that question, Senator.
>> Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, madam
President.
Thank you. We've got
Representative Sarinana.
You are next. We
are getting, >> I'll make it
>> quick Chairman.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
I think all my questions have been
asked. I have just one.
What
um
what role do you see
quantum technology
in climate change? And
are there any other states that are looking
specifically at climate change
for this
technology?
>> OK, madam Chair
representative, thank you for the
question about climate change.
So I want to emphasize two
aspects of that. The
first one is there's
an enormous amount of
concern right
now with big data
and computing centers, whether
they're uh traditional
high-performance computing or
artificial intelligence
and the power consumption
and hence impact
potentially on climate
due to use of electric
power. Uh importantly,
quantum technology
is a low power
approach, right. So
when we can solve a problem
with a a quantum
system, it takes very,
very little power. So this
is a like a factor of a
million lower in power
consumption per operation.
All right. So it's a the
second one is
that for understanding
climate change, right?
That is a complex
real world and
science problem. What is
going on? What are
the things we can do?
What are things that we would do that are
not such a good idea which
ones will work uh
and understanding either
regional uh water
resource, I
impact uh
ocean impact,
global climate impact,
you know, not, not just
predicting the weather but understanding
the climate. That is
something that is done by
all of our institutions and many
partners around the world
through modeling.
OK. Uh Some of the
you know, the core
equations, you know,
we can, we can go to
any of our universities and start
looking up what those equations look
like. But the basis of
those equations,
you know, and how you solve
those are things that are bread
and butter at Sandia and Los
Alamos every day for
solving problems,
solving those kinds of
equations, doing models
and assessing did the model
work. OK.
So quantum computing
we believe will have an
impact on the
quality and
future future
potential
lost my microphone there
for just a second. So we
think that's going to be a big impact.
Now then let me just try to like
put something together for you
that I think is very real.
That's coming soon
where we
should be the world
leaders. And
that's the place
where regular big
computers, high performance
computer artificial
intelligence and
quantum computing are all gonna come
together. This is
coming right?
And putting them all together is going
to be a new and
amazing thing.
And I think that's very real and
it's a place where I believe
that our laboratories, our
universities, our
State quantum New
Mexico should be
working to be the world leader
in that area. Uh We have
all the pieces uh
and it's also something that you
can't do. This
is scientific
opinion. In this case, I don't
think it's something that we're gonna do if we have
a quantum computer in
Albuquerque uh and
a uh an A I
center uh in
Nebraska
and a different high-performance
computing regular system at
Los Alamos. I think
this is a place where we're
gonna be combining all of these
kinds of technology
in places, the size of this
room to see how
do we put them all together?
I think this is a fabulous
opportunity and then we're
gonna really learn how we do it
all. Thank you very much. I
got pretty excited there about
the scientific opportunity space
there.
>> Thank you. >> Thank you, Mr. Chair madam
Chair. Yes. Thank you very
much. We've got one more and we're going to
wrap it up after this
because we've got
other items we're going
to work on, on the agenda.
So we've got Representative Herndon.
You are next. There
we go.
>> Thank you madam Chair
and um presenters.
Uh My question actually
is going, there's been a
lot of uh concern
or questions about the
camps and I have one also.
So it looks like the student
camps are from July
1 to July
26. That's a, that's
almost a month.
So once the students come
out of these camps, what
will they be able to
do
>> madam Chair representative.
So, so what we're trying
to do is build
opportunities across the
spectrum so you can go from,
from one thing to the next and
not just come and learn and then get
lost in the ether.
And, and that's a major step
that we're hoping we can
connect Q camp
with the, the quantum
learning lab at CNM or
Q camp to build
pathways into traditional
education path paths.
So uh if you want to
get into the job force,
we have an opportunity there. If
we want to get into higher
education, we have an opportunity
there. The on ramps and
ramps of the, the broader
strategy are really critical
and in what we're thinking about,
um we are still
experimenting with different
formats of Q camp.
Uh We've done three day camps,
we've done week long camps. This
is our first month long
camp. Um And we're trying
to figure out what's most effective
to get students engaged and
interested in on that stem
pathway. Um
But also how we can
continue that engagement piece
with them. Uh We have a lot
of work to do. Uh But we're
hoping through the elevate Quantum
Award uh and working with
our partners at the nonprofits
at the school districts, at the
Innovation Campuses uh
that we can build those
opportunities to continue
on. Um But even
though these programs have only been around
for a few years, we already have
stories and vignettes
of Q camp students
who are now in programs
at UN M that are focused on
quantum or that are entering
the stem pathway and,
and we need more time to really
dive into that data and see how
effective what we're doing is. Uh
But we're being very
intentional about
ensuring that there are pathways
into and out of
the the education realm and the
workforce realm as
we're creating these new programs.
>> Thank you madam Chair and,
and Mr. presenter. So just for
clarification, so
those students who go through
this first iteration of
camps, for example,
if you are having a
2nd and 3rd, they will
be advancing in terms of
what they will be learning
so that we are going
through the process of growing
our own. Is that correct?
>> That that is the intention.
Yes. Um We
are uh this
four week camp uh is
the first time that we've done it.
And we are
introducing not only
quantum computing, which is what we
originally focused on, but quantum
sensing and quantum communications
uh to give that additional
insight into other
areas of the field.
And as we learn what the
students are most interested in,
uh that's how we'll create our next
programming. Uh because
connecting with them, finding
the things that are most interesting
that will keep them engaged, get
them into stem large.
Uh That's, you know, top of
mind and, and especially with the
communities we're working with, we want to make
sure that we're being responsive
um and giving them the opportunities
to continue to grow. Uh So,
like I said, we still have work to do, but
it's absolutely on our mind and on our road
map. >> All right. Thank
you. That would be really great. And
miss madam Chair and
presenters I see
here. It says that it
the first one
was at Sandia.
And if I'm looking at page
21 correctly,
and were there any other cities
where these quantum camps
were actually
presented?
>> Uh madam Chair representative. Uh
Yes. So, so
Sandia has been the lead on
this and we've had
um student
locations in Santa
Fe, like I said, we tried
expanding out to Gallup but we
didn't get quite enough applicants to
make it happen. Um We
had a virtual program
um and, and tested out what
that would look like from uh
participation across
the State. Um
But in creating the
camp, we worked with professors
at N MS U uh
at our nonprofit partners
UN M other National
Labs and, and I didn't include that
information here, but we
had more than 28 contributors
to, to really get the camp
off the ground. Um
And we've been having discussions
with how to reach those other communities.
Uh And we've been successful
with securing federal funding
to do uh our four
week camp and we just need
to figure out what the next steps are to
take it to other communities in New
Mexico.
>> OK. Thank you. I
think I can help you with that.
And so madam madam
Chair and uh Mr.
presenter, one last question
with respect to this quantum
technology and the
application of utilizing
it with drugs is the
intention of the the
program in that respect
to do away with clinical trials.
So you don't need them
anymore.
>> Madam Chair
representative.
Yeah, we do not anticipate
that Now, the three
of us are not medical
researchers. So we want to
make sure that we're not making a
statement in an area
where we don't have that
expertise but
that the quantum computing
community in the
areas of pharmaceuticals
chemistry, chemical
reactions. Uh We,
we do not anticipate an
absence of,
of testing with
people that, that
that would be a surprising
thing uh in our community at this
time. >> Thank
you madam Chair.
>> Thank you very much
for that. I will just
mov'e on immediately. I just want
to say thank you. I'm going to
defer my questions because of
time. But I did hear your
presentation before
approximately two years ago, not
the same one but on quantum
computing. And I was very
impressed. Thanks for all your
movement. Hope you do
well continuously.
All righty Mr. Chairman, do
you? I think we've got
other items we
want to work on. So
>> we're going to get ahead for tomorrow.
So if you'll turn your
tabs and we're gonna
do tomorrow's 1130 stuff
and play catch up Charles. We're gonna
start with
Tab
>> tap in for the
meeting minutes from
June
>> motion by Senator Dollis
in a second
by
Small House
of Representative Small.
Any objection to adoption
of the meeting minutes? See,
none,
Representative Siana objecting.
She raised her hand. No,
sure. All
right.
>> Tab O is
approval of the sub-committee
reports from June
for Child Welfare and
Water and Natural
Resources >> approval. Mr.
Chair
I >> have a motion by Senator
Rodriguez second by Representative
Armstrong and any objection
to the motion.
See none.
The >> tab
P these
are for contracts.
Uh One is for an amendment
for the webcasting services
um for this fiscal
year. Uh The
second is a performance
academy contract that you had already
approved um
for June, but
we weren't, our contractor
wasn't able to make it out.
Um And we'd like to have
him come out in August
to do training on how
staff can implement
randomized control
trials.
>> Any questions on
those
General Rodriguez, I mean,
Senator Gonzalez,
>> and there's
a, >> you're gonna have to turn
on your
mic
>> uh Mr. Chairman on the
webcasting and
to Charles. So,
so every agency
has to do their own
contract.
>> Mr. Chairman, we're
hoping to work
with council service to have
all of that on one contract
uh next interim.
If you recall, uh we
needed extra money that
we were spending for the
um
closed captioning
uh that was built into the council
service um
budget and
we're hoping that next interim
that they will pick up all of the cost
of um our
contractor that runs all
of this equipment as well as the
webcasting. Next
interim. >> Very
well. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
>> and it's about 3000
per meeting
depending on how many limit
bars she eats.
>> And Mr. Chairman, I also wanted
to ask
for approval if you turn to page two
of that we've separated
this out, but there was a
$600,000
appropriation uh
made out of the grow
uh member share
to LFC for the next
two years for healthcare
consulting. And
we wanted to use
50,000 of that to
continue um
working with the
uh consultant that we had this
spring on our data
analytics.
>> Who's the consultant?
>> What's her name again?
Maya Peterson.
>> OK. >> She
has extensive uh private
sector healthcare uh
data analytics
um experience
and has already proved very
valuable >> in which staffers
is she consulting.
>> She will be working with
the healthcare
team with
Eric and Allegra
Kelly Rachel
Nathan.
>> And how long is that for
>> this would be for the next
fiscal
year?
>> Ok. Any
questions?
Did we make >> a
motion
>> representative small made a motion
for a due pass? Senator Rodri
is second. Any
objection to the
motion?
Are you done
next? >> The next
item, Mr. Chairman are all
informational items. If you want to
take a look at them at your leisure,
uh the employment
levels are up uh
slightly uh
State agencies
um
cash balances,
some interesting things to
note. Uh The second
D A had
a pretty high cash balance. We
talked about the bar
um out of personnel
even though they got a supplemental for
personnel. Um
the patients compensation
fund which you also saw bar
to increase expenditure
authority out of on a
cash position is sitting at
250 million
on an actuarial position
that this is driving up their
malpractice rate increases
on an actuarial position. They're in
a different spot. That's a
statutory thing.
Um
And then
I nerd's got 88
million in its disaster
um fund. Uh
The governor's pulled out about
um, 45
million for IMD alone
um to respond to the fires
down in Rio dos. So maybe
about 55 million overall
when you include homeland
security and
uh dot To help
respond to
that
with that, I'd be happy to answer
any of the questions.
>> The budget guidelines, I guess
we need to look at them pretty
detailed so we can get that wrapped
up either
next time or as
soon as we
can.
What about bars
can let you go over bars real
quick and see if there's anything that sticks
out.
>> So Mr. Chairman,
this is on
uh tab
S
overall. We were
uh tracking
earlier this year to have a
decrease in the number of bars
and then we had a flurry of them at the
end of the year. So the total
number is about
626
budget adjustments.
Um
annual increases.
This is usually from federal
funds to agency
budgets total almost $3
billion worth of
uh budget authority
increases outside of the
normal appropriations process.
So this is agencies bringing
in, like I said, a lot of
federal funds are using some of the
flexibility that you're giving them in
the budget to bring
in um other State
funds earmarked
revenues.
Um The next
page,
you can see the kind
of the theme that we've seen
for some agencies.
Here's when health care authority
brought in $600
million from extra
Medicaid revenue
that we got to do a
better job of anticipating
what those federal funds are going to be
upfront and, and
take um
make sure to take care of those.
So here's a couple of
typical year-end bars
of moving money out of
personnel. Uh
1.1 million
um for E ce
CD, uh C
Children, youth and
families, 1.4
million from children's
behavioral health.
The 2nd
2nd D A 1.4
million. Again, they had received
a, a supplemental
funding for personnel
that they weren't able to
hire.
Those are some of the highlights with
the, with the bars. Mr.
Chairman happy to go
into more detail if you'd
like.
>> The bars are so
interesting to me.
Right.
Spaceport Authority
370,000.
Right? And they moved
it over for turnover has caused
vacancies. Funding will go
towards lease
payments.
The lease payments are to the State
land officer who these
payments are due. >> I
believe that would be uh some
of them.
Yes,
>> office, property insurance,
equipment, rental
and equipment and furniture
maintenance.
They moved that
way
that's where they moved out of the FT
category,
right?
So we maintain that
the
the
furniture for Virgin
Galactic.
>> I believe this would be for the Spaceport
offices, Mister
Chairman,
>> the ones in Crucis or the ones
in
>> presumably both. But I don't
have that level of
detail.
Representative >> Armstrong.
You need your furniture maintained, drop
it off of the
Spaceport
>> II. I want to
talk a ask a little bit
about the public school
Insurance authority and then
the General Services
department, those
are really
um
big budget
adjustment requests.
Can you talk a little bit about those
Charles, please?
>> Yes.
So
they have broad authority
to
increase their spending
authority
from premiums that they've gotten
from school districts in order to
cover the health
care costs of their
beneficiaries.
And so this is a year-end
true up for
PS I A
to make sure that they can pay
their providers
for those costs.
The general services
department is the
same thing. The problem
and we'll talk about this tomorrow morning
is
the general services department
doesn't have the revenue
to pay for all of
those claims
and they submitted it the last
week of the fiscal
year and like a
Thursday and I objected on a
Friday to bring that before
you all to talk about
the fact that that fund is going to
be in the red again
at the end of it is
in the red in our
estimation.
Um
So you know, there's
situations where you do want to
provide agencies flexibility
to make sure that if, if they're
bringing in the revenue to pay
for something that
um is it's something
that they're delivering or buying
that they can be allowed to do
that within certain
limits. Um Or in this
case, you want to make sure you can pay
for all of the, the
health care
costs.
>> Then what about the superintendent?
>> This is the same thing to pay
out malpractice
claims. Um
You know, the budget was originally
established at a certain
amount and claims
costs are coming in at a higher
amount and they're
given budget authority
to pull money out of that patient's
compensation fund, which on a,
like I said, on a cash
basis has got plenty of money to
pay for it. Um
In order to pay those claims
out,
ideally, we'd anticipate
those types of big cost
at the beginning of the fiscal year
through the budget process.
Um And that's where we need to work closer
with agencies not to have these
big year-end
things.
>> Senator Woods,
we're talking about the bars in
the, not
the bars in
coral,
>> but this is important
too.
Are we
requiring the
public school entrance
authority to raise your
premium
to cover this? We had
some discussion
about not
doing that.
>> We had discussion about right
sizing the premium
increase in order to be
able to cover medical
costs but
maybe not so much to be able
to build up a huge fund
balance because the general fund
is already, you
know, an insurance
reinsurance kind of in my
mind behind that. And
so their initial
um health care premium
increases were not
all for health care
costs. They were for
health, some health care cost
and the build up fund
balance.
So, but they've been, they've been
increasing their premiums
uh to be able to cover
their healthcare costs
better than GSD. >> So
Charles, we're talking two
unrelated things here.
This bar here at 37
million is
unrelated to what
we were talking about
>> to the
Yes to the premium increases.
That's correct.
>> I
in the general services,
they're, they're going
to,
they're going to transfer
that fund
to health care
authority
and this will true it
up. Now,
the health care authority will
have to,
are they transfer referring
their employees also
with the fund? >> Yes
sir, Mr. Chairman and
the fund we believe will start
out in a negative cash uh
basis. They
did not bring in the sufficient
revenue this year to
cover their health care
costs.
>> So even with this
bar, it's going to be
negative, >> correct?
Because the bar is just increasing
their spending authority, but they don't
have the revenue to pay
for that spending authority.
You gotta have both sides of the
balance sheet.
>> So how do we chew that up?
I mean >> you
tried to chew it up with huge
Mr. Chairman, huge
infusion of general fund.
Uh subsidies
and cost
still outpaced their
revenue that they were able to
bring
in.
>> Mr. Chair. Didn't we
put in 100
million last year, >> close
to 200 million over the
past couple of years, Mr.
Chairman
>> and then we're 50 million
short. They
>> will Mr. Chairman.
We estimate and you'll
hear this tomorrow,
we estimate they'll finish the
year in a negative
cash position of about 15
million.
>> But you, you
protested.
>> Yes, I did not
to not pay providers
the claims because that was already going to
happen regardless of
IED. But
for the, from the
standpoint that we
shouldn't be approving bars
for a
program that doesn't
have the revenue to pay for that
spending.
>> Thank
you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is there?
I mean, is
there a constitutional
issue with that? What is
the,
what is the
recourse? Because
I think we've talked about that.
They're not supposed to do
>> this
in terms of an account being
in, in the negative,
that's against
the law,
criminal penalties
associated with
it.
>> Ok. Ok.
Thanks.
>> I mean, this last year,
that's why we pushed so hard on the
bars. Right. Because
statutorily they increase
the GSTS healthcare. Right.
And we ended up 100 and 50 million.
Now they're saying we're still short.
Right. And they
swore to us the number was
exactly right. And on
and I,
I just think bars
are a place where they can play. I
mean, Spaceport,
no telling what kind of equipment they
bought or what they
did. But there's one other
one here, Charles in the department
environment.
Right?
They, and it says
it's not a page number, sorry,
table, not a
page. The bar
decreases the 300 categories
and the 400
by 300,000
to cover contractual
services
and subscription rules
like A&E
tell me what e and
is
rolling in and grossing. >> No,
it's some sort of subscription
service.
>> So I, I want to get more
interest in the, on the track
services. 390,000
who that went to? And then
the other was I bringing federal
money in, right?
And increasing their two and
300 level pay. But
for what is that, that,
is that where the, somewhere
I read one point
we're paying a federal employee
and get a New
Mexico's Groce
receipts is
that, that >> this
would have to do with their uh
regulatory
responsibilities for
the labs
for, uh,
and so they got an
increase in their federal grant. I think
what's important about this is
that's yet another source
of revenue for
paying for their personnel
outside of the general fund.
And we need to make sure we're accounting
for all of the sources as
you size. What
portion of their
payroll should be picked up by the
general
fund?
>> That's it for bars everybody
good.
We're just looking at
it. So
make sure you look at the budget guidelines
so we can
mov'e forward
>> and the budget guidelines
there in your share file,
there is a marked up version
where you can see what's,
what's new and what's being struck
out. And this is a clean
version. The revenue
outlook will doesn't
get updated until the
August revenue estimate comes
out >> there. There
is a new guideline in there. So
everybody needs the small
agencies,
the small agencies we
want to start doing bi annually,
right, every two years
and just hold them flat. They've had
a 10% increase.
It takes a lot of
time.
We know that this is an
election year. So
it takes a lot of time to go through them
individually and,
and we
don't ever know if we're getting
anywhere with those small agencies or
not. So
just make sure you look at that because
we May, it's
in
woods
>> 25.
Is that that
just
break injection and
that's
how would you say that
>> that's a projection. We came out
with the revenue
estimators
based on what they
they saw in the last
year. Yeah,
last year's revenue
projections. Huh
>> This is
this, this whole section
is in last year's version of budget
guidelines and it's highlighted
because it needs to be updated when
we get the new revenue projection.
So don't spend a lot of time
reading that as
opposed to the other things.
That's correct. We're just want >> to, we're
gonna have a new revenue number
next
month.
Hopefully it's 28
billion.
So just to go back to the small
agencies is just remember,
they've had a how many
percent increase over
three or four years? I mean, small
agencies,
>> it, it varies but small
agencies have
ridden. I have
gotten the benefit
of the budget surplus
as well and
we'll provide that detail to the
Committee and what we're, you'll
see in the budget guidelines, what we're
proposing is rather than having,
you know, four days of sub-committee
reports that we, you
still hear all of the budgets, but
through a staff report and spend a
little less time knowing
that those are probably
all good and we'll
flag for you
agencies like the commission on
deth of hard of hearing who have a revenue
issue that need to go
above that
threshold.
>> And
>> no,
so that's, that's gonna be a big
change moving forward. So
just those small
agencies that
we just go in there and sit
and listen and then just mov'e on.
Right. And
just give him, we just give him
overall rate increase
and we just hold them flat this
year
5 million in terms of.
>> Right.
I, I just have a quick
question on, on that Mr.
Chair. So if they
were in, are we looking at them,
if they were increased by at least a
10% have a 10%
increase, then we're going to
kind of blanket that or leave them
at that flat of a budget
or
are we going to
look at those that didn't get a
10% increase if you
can elaborate a little bit on that,
on how you, if
there's a measure there at all,
>> Mr. Chairman
Representative,
what we're proposing is an
alternative hearing schedule for
those agencies to free up
time for you to focus on where
the money is. Staff
will still have to do an analysis
but not as much time
to knock out the
budget
recommendation.
And we'll still present that budget
recommendation to you just not
over the course of, you know,
four days of subcomittee.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate that
time. And so that means,
but every other year that we're going to
spend more time on that, then
we'll free up the
on the budget year. That's,
that's coming up is >> that
Mr. Chairman, we
would work with the Committee to revisit
how you'd want to do that in the following
>> year. Thank you.
>> And they rode the wave
of increases over time
and never have really come to the
table. Some, a few have
but not a whole lot have come to the
table saying, oh, we need a large
increase or we don't need a large
increase. They just sit
quietly and they get more money and we
don't know what's going on. So
the flatter we can come out this
year because it's gonna be better,
especially with small agencies,
Representative Dixon,
>> thank you, Mr. Chair.
So for the smaller agencies,
one of the things that I
feel happens a lot of times
is, um,
we hear the same issue
year after year, you know,
like the, the hearing,
the deaf and heart
of, you know, and the
issue that they were having with the
tax revenue or whatever and it took
many years for that to be resolved.
So, um,
is this gonna be
in the budget guidelines?
And the reasons that I, the reason I
ask is because
I'd really like to make sure
that, um,
staff when they're going
through those
agencies flag
things that should be
corrected and haven't
been or something like
that, >> that would still
occur. >> Yeah. So if
the flag, if staff flags
something in, in that, right,
we probably need to hear them,
right. If we're not
hearing any flags or they're,
they're saying, oh, we want $5000
for this or $5000
for that they're probably
fine, they'll find the
money. But if, if
staff flags an issue, then I think
we ought to hear those. Right.
But if there's no flags, I mean,
some of those are just,
the sentencing commission is one of
those. It's just kind of flat all the time
and, and so
they just ride the wave up
and there's a few others like that
too.
Ok.
Well, tomorrow
we're gonna start at 6 a.m.
Now we're gonna blow up another
car
>> and then
dinner
tonight
at 530 sponsored
by the city of Socorro at the Jackson
Ranch Steakhouse. So that's, uh,
right across the Street from the
best Western and Holiday
Inn and right
down by the exit when you come
off.
>> All right. Any other questions tomorrow?
Hopefully shorten our timeline a
little
bit.
So representative Herman
can iron my shirts
before I head to Santa Fe and I didn't
bring
iron.
Um, I hold you to that.
Thank you guys.
