Good morning. This 30 days to
this year felt like. And it's my
third year here. It felt like a marathon
for some reason. I don't know if it's because I
turned 70 in October
or, or whatever,
but it just seemed like a long,
long, 30 days.
Was it 30 days, sir? Or
did I get that
right
in our Celtic Franciscan
tradition for our order.
Um We always do something at
the end. When we depart from each
other, ascending blessing,
you've been blessed the whole time we were
here. We had
a bunch
of different faith traditions
and tried to bring
all the petals of the
beauty of the different faith
traditions here to this body
as you bring all that to,
to them.
So as you complete the work you
set out to do in these 30
days, complete with its
triumphs,
disappointments and
compromises,
I pray that you are kept
safe as you return to your homes,
your families, you work in communities
today
and all the days that follow in this
new year
that you live as full and rich as
you can. And with all the things that
occurred, this session
that you see things that you
may have not have seen before
and that those things provide a
clear lens for you to see the
fruits of your work,
especially in the faces
of those you work
for.
I pray that you hold easily in
your hands, the balances of
earth and sky, just as our creator
holds you in his hands
and balance.
I pray that you can laugh,
often cry when
you must no freedom from
worry and
second guessing
and embrace all the quiet miracles
that require no attention,
but embellish your daily
lives.
I pray that you continue to be
grateful for all the gifts you've
been given and
celebrate your life with the grace,
humility, wonder and contentment
that you live it.
And as the Holy Spirit leads
you, I
pray that you are blessed at the
dawn of each new
day and that
each new Mexico sunset
brings God's peace to
you under a heaven
of stars.
I ask all these things in the
name of our Australian God and all
the names we call you holy
father, son and holy
spirit.
Amen.
I pledge allegiance to
the
flag.
I salute the flag
of the State of New Mexico
and the Zia symbol a
perfect friendship among
United
Cultures.
You may be
seated
once again, we'd like to welcome everyone
back to the
30th day of this legislative
session and I'll yield to Senator
Peter Worth to take us to that first order
business. Uh Thank you,  Mr.
President Unanimous Consent. We go to
that or business
announcements and miscellaneous
hearing. No objection. We are in
that order of business announcements
and miscellaneous Senator Peter Worth.
Uh Thank you  Mr.  President
and thank you to our Senate
chaplain for
your sending blessing,
uh which just is a thing
of beauty and
recognizing what's on the other
side. And I just
also want to thank you
for the diversity
of voices. Uh, the
chance to just take time
and pause. Uh,
it's been important to me. It's
important to the other members
and actually, I'd like members. Can we
just give our Senate chaplain
a round of applause for
the job he has
done.
Senator Peor. Thank you,
Mr.  President. It really is an important
part of our day and again,
many, many thanks.
Uh, so,
so we do have
a certificate
that's not gonna be read. Uh,
first we'll go to Leo, Senator Leo
Jaramillo for the George o'keefe
Museum and you might have some guests
and might not. And then we're
gonna go to Senator Campos who's
gonna do, uh,
a final certificate for
one of our members who's leaving
and then I'll give everyone a sense of
what the morning looks like.
So with that,  Mr.
President,
I would yield to Senator
Padilla and then to Senator Jarmil.
Thank you, Senator Wirth, Senator Michael
Padilla. Thank you very much
Mr.  President. As though I needed
to do this this morning. You'd ask consent
to allow cameras in the senate
chamber and the Senate gallery
and you look terrific today,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Michael Padilla seeing no
objection. Cameras are
allowed both in the gallery
and in the
chamber.
Senator had a meal.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Everyone
on your desk. You'll see that you have
a 2024
Georgia o'keefe calendar,
uh Georgia o'keefe lived in my
district in ACU
and I wanted to tell you that the Georgia
o'keefe Museum Museum
celebrates the art life and
independent spirit of Georgia
o'keefe through its
collections, exhibitions,
publications, research
center and educational programs
throughout the state. The
museum contributes to
scholarly discourse
and serves diverse audiences.
The George o'keefe Museum is one of
the only museums in the world
dedicated to a single
woman artist with
international status
and whose work is closely
associated with New
Mexico and more
specifically my district
than at district five.
The Georgia o'keefe Museum is the most
visited art museum in New Mexico.
Drawing more than 130,000
visitors annually.
The Georg o'keefe Museum also
maintains the home and studio
on a IQUE offering
visitors a glimpse into o'keefe's
life in Northern New
Mexico. The museum
held a kickoff,  Mr.  President in
October 2023 to
celebrate the launch of its
expansion which will break
ground this spring in downtown Santa
Fe. The project will
triple the museum's gallery
space to allow for the
museum to tell the story of Geor
o'keefe's life and her
profound time in the beautiful
State of New Mexico.
It will allow for a place for all New
Mexicans to learn to be
inspired and be
connected. The George o'keefe
Museum welcomes thousands of students
every year for field trips and learning
opportunities and the Museum
Art of George o'keeffe Truck,
visit communities to statewide,
to help Children and adults across
New Mexico to explore their own
creativity. Now,  Mr.
President, that's all I have to say about the
o'keefe Museum. But every
morning, I just want to take one more
minute to say something. I
greeted Senator Tallman
with a cheer every morning
and I don't see him here, but I'm gonna do that
cheer one last time for him.
I would tell him T A
double lat,
A double L MA
N. Let's go
Tallman. So with that. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator.
I love it. Said Adam, you after
30 days, you're still cheering
away
any further. Got Senator
BCA. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I just wanted
to, uh, again,
recognize my wife who's
sitting here with me on day 30
as she has been for the other
29 days and
I appreciate her support and
please help me welcome her
one more
time.
Any further announcement, Senator Senator
Morris, thank you,  Mr.  President. I just
wanted to thank, uh Senator
Harilal for bringing the Georgia o'keefe. I
haven't talked to him about this but my
grandmother Aloisa, her, one of
her sisters was actually
Georgia o'keefe's house housekeeper,
family is from the
ACU area. She grew up in Youngsville,
Coyote area, but Longtan
standing homesteaders, not
homesteaders land grant, uh
folks from that
area. So there is that family
connection I'm awfully proud
of. Um, I appreciate
you bringing this Senator
Harmel. Thank
you, Senator Moore. Senator
Neville.
Thank you,  Mr.  President  Mr.  President. I
wanted to take a moment to introduce
my daughter, Kelly Kelly.
What she would stand? Kelly
is an attorney in Laramie
Wyoming and
she's very active in the bar
association. <She is> a past
president of the Wyoming
Bar and they were um
negotiating a
bill before the Wyoming
legislature in the last few days
and they killed her bill
and uh so she
decided she could come and see me
about five o'clock yesterday. She
says I'm coming down and she got here
at midnight all the way from
Laramie Wyoming, my daughter
Kelly.
Thank you, Senator Deville.
Further announcement,
Senators.
Any further
announcements?
Seeing no further announcements,
Senator
Moore's,
I'm sorry,  Mr.  President, if everyone
and um, I'm gonna steal this,
don't tell our sergeant, I'm gonna steal my
name tag and Pirtle stealing this
idea also,
um, if you could come by as
members and just sign your sign
it, I really appreciate it. I want to frame
it and have it. I'd really appreciate if
the members could just stop by and sign these
for us before we leave. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator
Morris.
See, no further announcements,
Senator Pete
Campos.
Thank you very much,  Mr.  President,
members of the Senate as
the audience,
people that have been paying attention to
this and of course, our
esteemed staff and our state
senators, each
of, you know that as we
learn of several
of our members who are gonna be
retiring.
Uh, we've
taken the
liberty if you will to ensure
that we recognize
these distinguished
individuals and their
families. So
we're uh coming up to
the last one
and uh this is
gonna be
probably one of the most
touching because today,
our emotions are high.
We're excited.
We spent the last
29 plus days
going on the last day if you will
together. And
so within this, this is going to
give us an opportunity
to really let if you
will
the bagpipes
flow.
So if you all will get
ready, we're going to do this within
30 minutes. We're going to have
one final
recognition
and  Mr.  President, members of the
Senate, I'm going to turn this over
to
El Caballero
and uh some of you
might say, well,
Canne El Cerro,
ladies and gentlemen, the
cowboy who is
gonna start this
off, Senator
Mark Morris. If you will,
please take
it away, Senator
Morris, thank you, Mister President.
Would the reader read the
certificate?
The reader will read
56 legislatures
second session
2024.
The New Mexico State Senate
having learned of the
contributions of Senator
Cliff R. Perle
to the State of New Mexico.
Does hereby extend its
appreciation.
And whereas
Cliff Pirtle has enjoyed
killing many a bad bill
during his 12 years as a
senator. And
whereas Cliff Pirtle
has always loved the House
versus Senate charity basketball
games. And in
2023
he dropped
23
pointers in the fourth quarter
of the game. And
whereas 2016
was Cliff Pirtle's favourite
year as a senator and
was marked by the birth of his son
George Hamish.
And whereas Cliff Purtle
considers as a highlight of
his career, the year that
he killed a bill that would have restricted
farmers across New Mexico.
And it is, it was
undoubtedly his passionate
and heartfelt speech
that was the deciding factor
in the bill being killed.
And whereas afterwards,
Senator Bill B
o'neill wrote a play
about that Bill and
Cliff Purtle starred in the
dramatic performance of the
play. And whereas
Cliff Purtle is grateful
to the constituents of Chavez
Edie and Otero counties
for the privilege of
serving as their senator.
And whereas Cliff Pirtle was
part of the successful
effort to approve the
expansion of the United States
Highway 380 for
safety and
tourism,
the establishment of
a cannabis
distillery
and ensuring expedited
access for doctors to
rural hospitals.
And whereas Cliff Purtle
worked on initiatives
such as lottery
scholarships, quality
of life, improvements such as
ballparks
and splash pads,
economic development,
infrastructure enhancements,
and advocacy for
second Amendment and private
property rights.
And
whereas
Cliff Perle was
will shift his focus to
family and embark
on his newest venture,
<Homestead> spirits, a
downtown distillery
but will remain a friend,
voice and advocate for
his community. Now
therefore, be it resolved by the
Senate of the State in Mexico?
That
recognition and appreciation
be extended to
Senator Cliff R.
Ple for his years of
service to the constituents in
his district, the counties
he served and the state of
New Mexico signed
and sealed at the Capitol in the
city of Santa Fe.
Senator Gregory, a
Baca Mimi
Stewart President Pro TEM
Sherri de Lujan, chief
clerk, New Mexico
State Senate. Thank
you to a reader and I yield to Senator
Mark Morris.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. This one's gonna be harder
than it was yesterday.
Um
I love a lot of people in this chamber,
but no more than Cliff Pirtle.
We, uh came in together
12 years ago and I
don't know, just something clicked. Uh,
he's my bro. I have a
Bromance with this guy for the last 12
years. And, uh,
we shared an office
upstairs, uh, for
eight years, both in 4, 14 and
4, 16.
And we've sat next to each other on the
floor first with him in front
of me and then with him behind me and
then side to side for
12 years. We sat next to each other in
committee and,
uh, we finished each other's sentences. He's
definitely my, uh, my Senate
spouse up here.
Um, and we, uh,
we have clicked from day one
and, and this man, uh,
uh, uh, despite
his early conversations always
about Australia,
um, that we were able
to get him pass that. And,
you know, this is a testimony
of how small New Mexico is.
Um, we talk
about my treasurer,
uh, is one of his best friends,
also, never knew him before. We
got here in the Senate. Uh,
the, uh, one of Lisa's
partners, Doctor Lahiri,
who's from India,
um, who immigrated to the
US and he went to medical
school is now one
of Lisa's partners in the
laboratory, sat
next to cliff all the
way on an airplane
all the way. Where'd you go? Was, I
was in New Delhi but it was all the way to
Australia if I remember correctly.
Um And so they talked and so
that's how the, the connectors in New
Mexico are and everyone
who knows him knows
his love and passion
and goodness knows we've got
in a lot of trouble, Moores and
Pirtle Pearle and Moores. What are those
two up to? Uh now?
And, and I think we
have killed a lot of bills. We've done
a lot of good. We protected a lot
of our, our rights. I wish
we had done more. Um,
but this man is someone I love.
One of my favourite pitchers in the
Senate is our first
year up in 414. I'm
holding uh Zeke and
he couldn't have been more than what,
2, 18 months
old, 18 months old
and he's sleeping on my chest
and then to watch his
beautiful, uh, three,
Children be born and
then bringing mckenzie in the family
has just been amazing journey
and I love those kids.
I love him. Um,
and he will be one of my boys
forever. Love you, buddy.
And I'll open it up for further debate
comments.
Thank you, Senator More. As we have
Senator
Senator Baca. Then Senator
o'neil,
Senator Woods, Senator Pirtle,
Senator Tip
Pino,
Senator Griggs, did you have your hand up Senator
Griggs? Senator Randley? And then I'll go
from there,
Senator Baca.
Thank you,  Mr.  President
President. And I'll ask
unanimous consent to suspend the
rules because I might have to face him
a couple of times
because I want to thank him.
No objection. Thank
you,
Mr.  President. Uh, uh,
I got to know Cliff
Purtle during my first
election and, uh,
since then, you know, I,
I was always
mesmerized by his
ability
to cite
rule and
teach me decorum
and function of the senate.
Um, I, there's nobody
in this chamber that knows
the rules as well
as Cliff Purtle.
He, um,
understands how we are to
function. He understands the
decorum and the, the
honour that the Senate carries
with it. And I, I
just really, uh, I'm
grateful to him
for, uh, um,
for teaching me those things
on a personal note. I've got
to, I've got to meet his
family, his parents,
his Children, and they've
all become my friends and I'm happy
to say that Cliff Pirtle is my
friend. Um
I've shared a lot of laughs and we've
had a lot of fun in committees
and we've shared tears as
well. Um We
have a great memories and
some scars
and uh uh I
just uh I'm gonna
truly miss
Cliff. Um I'm gonna
miss him. This chamber is gonna miss
him. We're gonna miss his wit
and
humour.
We're gonna miss
his wisdom. We're
gonna miss his
knowledge of the
variety of topics.
One thing that we do share,
we don't share the same
part of the state.
We don't share the same
tone of skin,
but we share
culture
myself and Cliff Pirtle come from
the same culture
in Tul New Mexico.
Thank you Cliff. Love you,
buddy. Thank you, Senator
Baca. We have, we'll have Senator
Ward, Senator Brandt and Senator
o'neill.
Send it worth.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
also rise to
just say a few words about
Senator Pirtle.
Uh Again, he
came in as I
think our youngest member
and got seated right up on the
front row.
And again,
you always wonder
exactly what, what's
coming in and who is this
person? And I think we
all learned very quickly that
this is someone who
has an
incredible intelligence and
was able to navigate through. As
Senator Baca mentioned, not just the
rules but various
laws. He was digging
in and, uh, was a member
of the judiciary committee and took
that to heart. I
will always remember though
putting Senator Pirtle in
that uncomfortable zone
because I would carry some water
bills and these
water bills, I
thought made perfect sense.
Uh, he didn't think
most of them made sense, but
every once in a while, there was
one that would cause him to go wait
a minute. That actually does make
sense. And I finally
got him to vote for one of those
bills. And I think for the first
time his conservation voter
scores went from zero to
about
five.
And I took great pride in
that. And,
you know, over the years,
it's just been a, it's been
fun to work with you and I
certainly agree with the comments
about your understanding of the rules
in decorum. And I
think that's helped this chamber be a
better place. So,
best of success
in whatever direction
you go. Senator Pirtle
and thank you for your service.
Thank you, Senator Senator
Brent
Mr.  President.
And
you know, Cliff and
I were part of that same
class that we've talked
about several times
and
Cliff.
Uh,
and I and Morris have
done a lot of stuff
together.
We were in the same
office suite the entire
time
and I've learned a ton from
cliff,
learn a lot about farming
and ag and things I had
no idea
about,
but also how to be a
friend
up here,
that's not always easy to
do.
But uh with
Cliff, it was always easy to
do.
You know, his, I'll miss
all of his movie
references
and I'll never forget the
debate on the floor
where we were talking about
neonicotinoids,
which I had no
idea what those were until that
day.
And uh you know, Cliff
walked us right through those and,
and the importance
and, and
uh just
uh cliff. It's uh
it's been great to serve with
you. You've been
a good friend
and uh
I wish you the very best
in everything you
do
from this day
forward.
And thank you, my
friend.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator Brandt, Senator
o'neill.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Those darn
neonicotinoids. I still can't say
that or pronounce it.
So OK,
um that darn
Bill man. You, you
know, you convinced you convinced
me to vote against
it. And II, I think
um our pro TEM has finally
forgiven me for that vote.
I'm not sure. But no, but
she's been a good sport about all
of this and, and just
in terms of the play
that I wrote, you know,
that was the start of it
because uh
boy my district
let me know what do you have against
bees? Like we thought you love bees,
etcetera, etcetera. So I
was, I was getting at
in this play how sometimes you
take a vote but you
know, these votes are complicated
and, and there were side
effects, you know, ramifications
to that bill that you convinced
me and, and
Um that, that, that
wasn't the right direction. I
still love the bees. We're gonna save
those bees someday.
But, um but you know,
this play, I,
you know, I took that
as, as the starting
point and then when I had the first
draft, I obviously,
um because the
play really zeroed in
on my friendship with this fellow
over here, um
we wanted to, to make
sure he was OK with
this and he was
on board immediately even
though, you know, it's not
always, you know, it's
personal, it is
fiction, it is a,
a play, but
it's also just based on,
on things that we have shared
in our friendship.
So, um and by the
way, it's quite the thing. I mean,
it, it's uh getting a
lot of interest in it outside
of New Mexico, we've performed
it and um boy with
a professional cast that
in, in Arizona and
Colorado and, and it's
quite timely because it is a plea
for bipartisanship and
in the e urban divide
which I've heard about, which
we talk about all the time.
But I just do believe
in a larger sense that we can do
better, um,
than, than our certainly,
than our congressional counterparts. I
think, I think it's
a, it's just something that we just
need to continue to, to
hold out hope for, to work
together. I do think state
legislatures are situated
such as New Mexico,
um, are situated
better to at least
try. Um, but,
you know, these are honest, philosophical
differences. So, so
anyway, I just
want to point out last year's
game, this guy played
the entire game with a
broken hand,
you know, it's like,
I still can't believe that. And then of
course, he hit those
threes. Um
Also, I'm gonna
miss, uh, the
karaoke caucus. We've
been known to do duets, Poncho
and Lefty. That wasn't, that
didn't go over so well. But,
but other ones like north to
Alaska that, that's, that's a
good one. But, but,
uh, and I will find
I misses crazy bills
like, like,
uh seceding from New
Mexico, you
know, like
what? And,
uh, the one my
favourite is to call
the, to name the
day to declare
the day after the Super
Bowl, that Monday uh state
holiday. I mean,
that's brilliant. What a great
bill we passed that out of,
out of culture affairs.
So, um, but anyway,
yeah, in all, in all seriousness,
I look forward to hanging out with you
and, and, uh, Roswell
and, and, uh, you
know, you're a good
friend. Thank
you. Thank you,
Senator o'neill. We have Senator Woods
followed by Senator Vile, Senator
Tinno, Senator Griggs
and I'll go from there.
Thank you,  Mr.  President
and I to rise to
support cliff,
you know, many times we're
not on the same side
of agriculture
issues and,
uh, because we
don't live in the same
industry, we don't work
in the same exact
piece of the agriculture
industry. So things
may affect one of us
different than the other.
Uh, I talked to
Senator
Sanchez
a few days ago and we talked
about how quick
you can have something paid off
and how quick
things can turn against you and
you lose it,
losing.
And it's something that, that I
don't think people
understand sometimes
when you're, when
someone writes you
a paycheck,
they don't understand
the risk
involved in
business.
And I think that
TPL
Cliff Pirtle,
the risk involved,
the, the, the risk
takers that there are in
this world
and I appreciate
his views,
didn't always agree with them,
but I appreciate him.
So I stand very
much in
admiring grace
of you, sir. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Woods, Senator
Deville.
Thank you,  Mr.  President,  Mr.
President. You know, his trademark
bill was the time change
or not time change or was
it time change? Are we doing?
Is it daylight or, or
regular time
or? I don't even know what time it
is,  Mr.  President. Anyway,
that's been, uh, Cliff's trademark
was the uh putting
us on daylight savings
time year round and
he worked hard at it every 60
day session. He, every
60 day session he's been
here. I think that's been his
trademark cliff's a
very dedicated legislator.
He worked hard. And
what was said before about
him knowing the rules, knowing
the, the laws better
than I do. I want to grant
you that. Uh, but he's
a, he's been a great legislator
and good luck in the future.
Go back to the farm where you don't even care
what time it is. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you,
Senator Neville,
Senator Tip
Pino.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And um, when
you first came to the Senate,
I,
I was really suspicious of
you. I, I did not like
you at
all.
You, you II
I believe this is accurate.
You wiped out the last
Democrat from Southeast New
Mexico
and a
man that we all
loved. And so I went
down, we, we were down in, in
Ruidoso and went to the
event in Roswell
where Tim Jennings was being
honored and
lo and behold there you were
at the event honoring
him and,
and it just struck me and I, we
spoke briefly and, and it
just, and it just hit me.
This is not
personal, this
is about different
approaches to public
policy and
that you could still
appear at an event honoring
somebody that you had just defeated
in an election and,
and do it with, with
class and
I took a very different
attitude to you after
that. And
yes, all the basketball
games that, that
you helped
us win has helped
influence my feelings for you. Of
course. Uh,
but I
want you to know that,
uh, I've really
enjoyed your humour, your, your,
your, your
really wry
sense of humour that comes out
in comments in the committee
meetings on the
floor. Uh, I've,
I've enjoyed all of those
and I also want you to know that
at least twice every year
for the rest of my life.
I will be thinking of you
when I switch the clocks
forward and backward.
Thank you
very much,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator Dey Pino. Senator
Griggs.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. And I
think, I think Cliff
and I first
met
in
Albuquerque at a,
at a Republican meet
and greet and at that
particular time, his
oldest son, Zeke
wasn't much
older than the little one
today.
And uh and
Zeke and I had a, had kind
of a good time, although he must have
been a little bit older.
But uh,
but that was, that was the first
time I'd, I'd met Cliff
and, you know, Zeke and I, I
think are, are still pretty
good friends. Uh
Cliff and I, I think
are too. But,
um, one of the things
about, about Cliff, I mean,
he's a, he's a fierce
advocate for
rural New Mexico. He's a fierce
advocate for
agricultural
interest in New Mexico.
And he brings that
to the Senate
to where those
of us who haven't been
involved in
that
know, way more about it than
we, than we ever
have before.
Uh, as Senator
Brandt mentioned Cliff
and I, and, and
Craig and
Lee and,
oh, goodness, Mark.
And there for a while, Ted,
we, we all shared
the same office
suits. And, uh, so
we've, we've seen a variety
of things. We've talked about a
variety of things
and, and hopefully
we've, uh,
we've enjoyed a variety of
things and
Cliff's gonna
expand into a
new venture. And I hope
that at some point we
get to see how that
turns out. Um,
but,
you know, I'm proud to have been up
here with, with Cliff Cliff
is, he's, he's
younger than my
kids.
And so Cliff to me
oftentimes is just
like one of my
kids. And,
uh, you know, Cliff was over in
Almada one time.
He came through him and his
dad and they'd gone on an,
on an oryx
hunt and we, we
were able to have dinner
over there and talk and
visit and that's really the first time
I'd ever sat down with his
dad. And that
was a, that was just
a lot of fun. We,
we ran into each
other of all
places in high rolls, New
Mexico, picking
cherries
and, you know,
it's kind of kind of
random to run
into anybody
from
this body in high
rolls New Mexico.
But, uh, but we were
there and,
you know, it's just, it's just
been a joy cliff. I mean,
you've, you've educated
me on a variety
of things and, you know, we've
just, I think we've had
fun and,
you know, I'm, I'm hopeful that's
the way we remember it.
Um,
I do have one thing that,
that last year, you know, when you
talked about the basketball
game cliff,
scored more points than
he ever has.
And he did that with a broken
hand.
I think we might be able to look at
that in a couple of ways.
He toughed it out pretty good,
but maybe he needs to
have that hand worked on a little
bit before he plays
again and maybe
he'll be, uh, he'll score
more points then as well.
So, Cliff, thank
you for being up here.
It's been just a real honour,
sir. Thank you. Thank
you so much, Senator Griggs.
Um, I do want to go through the
list that we do have, we
have till about 910. So I
just want to make sure the members are
aware of that. We have
Senator Brantley, Senator
Jaramillo, Senator Shino,
Senator Gallegos,
Senator Sanchez, Senator
Steinborn, Senator Stefani,
Senator IVIS Soto,
Senator Nibert and Senator
Burke.
Senator Brentley. Thank you,
Mr.  President. It's Marian
Elman who
said that in
politics, there are
no true
friends.
I can't.
Marion Eltman did
not know Cliff Purtle
because that is not
true.
We are
sharks
that operate in a system
here that is built on
convenient and
fragile
alliances.
And then you meet someone who
is genuine
and
true.
And I just want to thank you
Cliff.
We were friends before I was
here.
But you know, we
serve in a chamber
where all eyes are on us
all the time and people pass
judgment on us and what we
do. I would
refer to this, this
great poem
Theodore Roosevelt has hanging
in Josh's office, the man in
the arena. It is
so easy for people to look
down on us literally in this
arena and pass
judgment on us. And
yet I have never
met someone
who is kind
and and never
passes judgment on someone and
open
and honest. And I just want to thank
you for all you've
done for me. I want to thank you for
what you've done for my family. We've
been through divorces
and job changes and new
homes and new husbands
and new babies
together and,
and our relationship
transcend, transcends
the senate. And
so for those who says you cannot
meet and build relationships
in this place, they are wrong,
they are wrong because
we are bigger than
this. And I
just thank you for being
my friend. I wish you and
mckenzie and all the kids
the best. This is not
goodbye for us.
Josh and Cliff have become very,
very close friends of mine and our
families and
I just wish you the best
you're doing the right thing.
We're still see a lot of you and,
and, and I love you and I love your
family and thank
you.
Thank you, Senator Brantley.
Senator Jamil.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I think
of Cliff Purtle, not only as
an amazing Southern New
Mexican, but as a friend.
And so Cliff Purtle and I
ran a bill together and I think
so many people were shocked to see
Jaramillo Purtle on one
bill for mounted
patrol. And so I've told
all of you this story that I headed
into the Democrat.
Uh I mean, the Republican
minority office my first year
here and I plopped
down on to a seat and I remember
Senator Pirtle was so passionate
about a bill. He shouted
something out and without
missing a beat, I said,
there ain't nothing wrong with that.
The whole
room laughed
and we said, there's nothing wrong
with that. That became a friendship
Mr.  President, that Senator Pirtle
is somebody I can go and visit,
talk to and laugh with
somebody to celebrate his
baby with. I sent
him off with a, a baby cow
for his new little baby.
But somebody I could always go talk
to and who would listen
and who would also offer advice.
And so Senator Pirtle in land
grants, he took the time to truly
understand what
Merceds mean to New Mexico
and how they're part of our DNA
in northern New Mexico.
You are a true New
Mexican who have the best
interests of your community at
heart. And I do
know that I'm gonna have at least
25 constituents.
We're gonna be sad to see that
your time zone bill
won't be coming from you.
But I want to let you know that if you're ever an
Espanola Senator, it's the
same offer I gave to Senator
Griggs Micasa su
casa. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Jaramillo,
Senator Shino.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
to
rise
and hate to see my friend
go.
Um I, I remember
when we came in uh
Pirtle,
I think his Roswell
had that whole side of
uh the gallery and
I think James Pueblo had
this entire
entire gallery
and it was so awesome to
see. And I
remember, I, I think
we probably took most of the time
introducing our guests
and, and just the family that
he has and, and the family that,
that, that of course I
have and
the friendship was struck, you
know, a lot of times we address
Indian issues.
And a lot of these Indian issues
aren't Republican issues.
They're not democratic issues, they're
Indian issues.
A lot of times ple, you
know, was right there with
us and he
represented, you know, mes
Apache who served as
Indian Affairs for the first four years
together.
And,
you know, hopefully we taught him a lot
about sovereignty,
but what it means to
protect our lands,
our way of life, our language,
our culture, our spiritual way of
life
and on many
trips, you know,
um you
know, I remember visiting
me rouse by, we went to go
eat dinner at his favourite
Mexican restaurant
in our travels. Uh We spent
together, you know,
whether we're in Rodo. So
Las Vegas uh
places where we,
we, where we're together and,
and uh enjoyed our
friendship,
you know,
and
you know, I think
about,
you know, uh cliff
Pirtle, you know, I
most of us are very educated
people. We've
all going to college.
We got our master's, we got our
bachelor's, we got our doctors, we
got our
attorneys,
you know, he, he reminded a
lot. Well, my
dad and my
uncle
never went past high
school, never went to
college,
but the smart that he has
the wisdom and the
knowledge,
it's just incredible.
And you heard it,
you know, he very smart
man, they, they need
to go to college, you
know, to be
smart.
So I always, you know,
valued that
because at the same you know,
it's just many times it's
just,
you know,
your provision and what you believe
in and that's
what Berta was.
I miss my friend,
but I'm, you know, we'll come down
to Roswell, we'll visit
maybe someday we'll go hunting,
you know, together. Uh,
you know, I share a lot about hunting
and what we do. You know, I
grew up in a small farming community
as well and so farming,
ranching all
these things, you know, I think sometimes
out reservation in rural
areas is about
the same, you know,
and, and, and that's why I think
I've always had
to, you know, to,
to this young
man, we came in together
and when he had his second
son, uh
he said, he named him
Hamish. I said, you know,
no, that maybe you named
him Hamish
because
you got that
misspelled.
So how do you spell that?
Because
you know his name is Hamish,
but we as Hamish
people, we call ourselves
in our Indian name, Hamish.
That's really our traditional
way of how we call
ourselves. But
everybody today
refers to us as
Hamus with the Spanish
letter, but in our own
traditional way,
you know, we call ourselves
Jes, which
literally means the
people. So,
so I was teased and so you named
after our tribe. So,
so Heis Amish,
we always have that connection.
So thank you Pearle for your
service and,
and, and, and what you've
been meant to this chamber
and to our committees and, and the
work that you've done. And I'm, I'm your,
you're a young man.
So, uh lot to
happen and I look forward
to uh, look
forward to seeing you prosper in
your other endeavors. Thank
you, Senator. Thank you, my friend.
Thank you, Senator Shindo,
Senator
Munoz.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I, I think
Senator
Chando May said it right in
his language, the
people,
right? You never
see Pirtle. He'll get a little angry
sometimes, but he's always quick witted,
kind of like me,
quick witted, always able
to laugh. Have a good time, not
worry about things in life that really
think people think
affect them.
Well, when it's time to get serious,
he'll get serious.
But life is short and he's
enjoying life. He's going to
enjoy life with his young
kids and
his new kid
and, and that's a great thing to
have. I don't remember
Lieutenant Governor, his son got
sick one time
and lieutenant governor and I went to
the hospital to see his son
in Roswell one day.
And so that
tells you the connection,
right? I know
you named your son George
Hamish.
We've seen them all grow
up. We've seen them
all come along and my kids
have done the same and,
and, and
you know what, Senator
Pirtle, I
think my wife
and I respect you more than
anything. We have a lot
of conversations
probably at our
house about you. Like,
you know, Pirtle Pirtle's a good
guy and Pirtle does this
and my wife says, when are you gonna get
more beans from Pirtle?
And, and, and, but we have
a lot of conversations about
you and,
and that tells you
where you're at in our hearts and our
family, right?
It means you left a mark
on us. It means you're
gonna leave a mark in the state
on the building, the
people, you affected
the things you did
never got time change, but I
will time
just keeps rolling.
Um, but
you know, we love
you. There's no
better thing than love
if we can ever do anything for you
and your family, let us
know. Thank you, Senator
Munoz. We do have
Senator Gallegos followed by Senator
Sanchez. Senator
Steinborn, Senator Stefanik, Senator
IVIS Soto, Senator Nibert and Senator
Burt Reminder we have until
910
to attend to this
discussion,
Mr.  President. Excuse me,
I apologize at 910.
My apologies, Senator Perle for
not observing daylight savings
time. 1010,
Senator Ggo
Mr.  President. I thank you.
I want to go back to the
daylight savings time bill.
Uh, my wife, I remember
when I was in the house
years ago, I
keep telling her she needs to get a life
because she watches what happens
here in the senate floor and back then
in the house floor, she'd
call me one day and asked
you need to go find this
Senator Pirtle
and you need to sign on to his
bill. She
loves the idea of,
uh, daylight
savings and I signed on to the
bill so I could
stay married.
But, uh, I
like the idea of partnering
with Senator Pirtle. Uh,
I did not have a
relationship
that I have now but
to be in this body and to see
what he does for us,
uh, just the wit,
uh, he's able to come in here
smiling and
deal with the issues
of the state.
And when he leaves this place,
he's the same person.
I've been out to their,
uh, dairy and farm
and ranch. Uh, and
they are the same people out
there as they are in
here. If you ever
get a chance to stop by,
they have some
extraordinary,
uh, meat that they'll sell you.
Uh, my wife still
tells me you need to stop by. I've
not done that lately,
but it's just one
of those things that I like
that. He is the same
person inside
these walls and
outside and cliff.
It's been an honour to serve
with you. Uh I
do not know how
you keep, uh, the
smile. Once you
leave this, this room,
you're an inspiration to the rest
of us. And I thank you so
much for having the opportunity
to meet you, become a
friend and to serve
with you. God bless
you. Thank you,
Senator Senator
Sanchez.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
So I can get through
this.
Look the other way, man. You're gonna make me
cry.
Mr.  President. I met
this
my young brother four years
ago and we have made
many, many memories.
This everyone
been here here has been so,
you know, kind and helpful.
But Senator Pirtle,
you know, showed me where the bathroom
was, showed me this is a round
building, showed
me where to drop
my bills, how to make a bill.
He helped me pass my first
bill, you know, just held
my hand through
everything.
Such a great guy. I
mean, it's
many, many memories built
here, like
people have said here inside
and outside, you know,
in the summertime I'll
cliff calls me and I'll be working
on something's broken and he's
working on something's broken. I
was fixing a water truck
or something. I couldn't find the
parts. Senator Pearl
says, well, I have them all brand new here,
man. We never used them on that. How,
how do I get them to you? How do I
help you with that?
So not only here on the floor,
Senator Pirtle, great
outside, you know, we,
we share a farming
ranching dairy
background, so we really
hit it off and it's, it's just
been great to have a friend
gonna miss you
and I miss how you just come
out here and throw
the rules around and
you'll be sitting in the back, not paying
attention, run out here and say, oh man,
that rule's not right or
you know, call point of order on
different stuff and it's
very articulate,
um, just an honour
to serve with your brother gonna
miss you
and I'm gonna stop right
there.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Sanchez, Senator
Steinborn. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. And,
uh, Cliff. I'm gonna miss you
too and,
but I'm sure it won't be
forever in
whatever capacity that may
mean. I just
want to say, uh, you know,
a couple of things about you. Cliff
number one meant a lot
to me
and I know your constituents
at the time, but I hope you go
back and you brag about that time
you voted against
allowing 10,000 casts
of high-level nuclear waste to come
through Roswell.
And it only took me two years
to convince you really,
this is gonna happen.
Don't take my word for it and
then at just the right
time, it's a
crucial moment.
You, you
uh you voted to keep
that from happening. So
that's a good one. So did the guy
sitting next to you. So thank you
guys for that. That, that caught
some people by surprise and
that helped that bill
get through to its final
passage. The other
thing, Cliff is, I hope you consider
writing a book on
how to write an
amendment
because tell me if I'm wrong, I don't
think we have a more skilled amendment
writer in the chamber than Cliff
Purtle and
more creative ways
in one word to like change
a bill or whatever
and 20 different ways
to change a bill. But in all
seriousness, you're damn good at
it and uh you, you
got a few of them
through.
But uh, but I think
that's something you have a special talent
for, but it's because you're
quick wit, you're clever,
you're um
curious and you
really take the time to examine
things and that's really what this
process is about. You only get out
of it, what you put into it
and if you take the time to study it
and do your work, then you
could try to make something better or you can
see that something really is bad
needs to be fought either
way you got to engage
and you did that
many, many times and we're gonna
miss that. Um,
so all the best you buddy
take care. Thanks,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Steinborn. Senator
Stefani.
Thank you, Mister
President and Senator
Pirtle. I thank you,
first of all for your service to
the State of New Mexico.
But secondly,
we could have passed that
Meat Inspection Act
several years
ago.
But, um,
with the help,
the assistance of you coming
to the group
this year working
with judiciary committee
getting the right words, getting
the right format, we
all can take credit and
you can stand proud for what
you've been able to do for the ranchers
of the state. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Senator Stefanik, Senator
Risotto.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I know we're
running tight on time. I just
want to point out a few things. One is, I
believe you have the distinction
being, uh,
cliff the
third youngest
person to ever serve in this
chamber.
Um,
is that, is that the case?
Third youngest?
Yes.
Um, Senator
Montoya, Senator
Candelaria, Senator
Pirtle
and, uh,
and that's, that speaks
a lot in
terms of the confidence
that you've been able to instill in
people.
Uh, and, uh, and
what you've been able to bring.
And, uh, you know,
there's one of the things that,
that I think we all, uh,
this, this
discussion has really brought out
is that there's two different qualities there's
wanting to like someone and there's liking
someone, whether people
wanna like you or not,
they like
you.
And that's just the reality.
And finally,  Mr.  President,
uh, I don't know if
the senate majority floor
leader would be willing to entertain
this Senator Wirth.
But, you know, we have a little bit
over an hour and a half. I don't
know if we can get an emergency bill
going on time
change bill.
Um, but I think
we could probably just barely get
it through. We can perhaps
back, get it through and bounce
it over to, to
uh to the house in just enough time
to get it through and make it the
Cliff Pirtle memorial bill.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator
ever. So I think that could be done if we roll
back the
clock,
Sniber.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
When Senator Pirtle was
first elected, I was chair
of the county commission and I can
tell you that it, it speaks
very loudly when we have
someone in Santa
Fe that represents
the community from which they
come from. And
Cliff has always stand
tall,
not only representing
Chavis County, but the other
two counties that he represents
Otero and, and Eddie.
And so
as a member of this
body now, I want to extend
my sincere
appreciation for the years
of service. He has given not
only to this body
but to the citizens of the
county that I
represented as a commissioner
and as a representative,
uh, Chavis County. And,
and I imagine that,
uh, Otero and Eddie would
say the same thing. Thank you for
your service to our citizens
and thank you for the hard work and
effort that you
engaged on
our behalf up here in this
body. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Senator Nur, Senator
Burton.
Thank you,  Mr.
President. And
uh you know, there's
so many things you can say about cliff. A
lot of them have been said already,
but you know what you see is what you
get. Uh the guy
shows up and
uh uh I think as
maybe Senator Worth
said, not really sure
about the guy and all of a sudden
you start hearing his debates and so
on and so forth and, and
he's super articulate.
He uh is,
is well prepared
now. I don't know how he does this
because most every
time I see cliff, he's like hanging out
in the leadership
office or he's up in the offices
or, you know, walking the
hall, I guess the guy never
sleeps because he,
he does a lot of research and
he is very good
at putting together a
debate and,
and comments about bills
and not
just because
he wants to debate, but he
wants to understand
the crux of the bill, what
it does and
really make the determination
on whether it's good or
bad. Um,
and so when you can
pair up with, with,
uh, you know, folks on the other side of the
fence over there, uh,
you know, that he has done his
research and he knows what's going
on. And I really, really
appreciate that because
many of us,
uh, maybe skim
the surface or take the time to do
some things. But I don't
think into the depth that cliff
does and, and for
that, he should be applauded.
Secondly, he
is,
um, I love
his dad, by the way, we've had several
long conversations
but, uh, uh,
he
is young, aggressive
and, uh, he
explores options. A
lot of people,
especially his age will
talk about. Well, I, I'd like to
do this. I want to do that
cliff actually does it,
you know, and he's about
to probably launch into yet
another business
venture. And,
uh, we're gonna try to make some connections
as well for him as we go down
that road. Uh, but
II, I
really
can't say enough about a guy. I wasn't
really sure of when he first got here.
But, but,
uh,
I think really has gotten to the
point where I can truly
call him, not just a,
an excellent
senator, but I
would call him a statesman
and not too many people
ever get that kind
of recognition. And
I'm honored to have you as a
friend
and a wonderful statesman
for the Senate of the State of New
Mexico. God bless
you, Cliff Purtle.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator
Burt, Senator
Padilla.
Thank you very much, Mister President.
I'll I know the alarm bells
about to ring, as I said,
just came in the same day that
Senator Pirtle came in here
and I'm going to do my best Cliff
Purtle right now,
Mister President. I only have one thing
to say in 27
parts.
And I will tell you that I said
this about Senator Moores yesterday
that it's very hard to find
somebody that will keep Michael Padilla
on his toes. And
whenever these
two got on the mic, I
just knew I had to get my body
in here as fast as humanly
possible because I always had
something very important to say. And it was
very, very good. One thing we
haven't talked about today,  Mr.  President
is there were a couple of sessions over
the past 12 years that
we showed up here in a very
different looking
cliff Pirtle showed up.
I don't know if everybody recalls
that mane of hair showed
up in multiple different
variations. And
well, I wish I had even half
the hair that he has.
Um He kept us on his
toes that way too. There were times I didn't
recognize him at all and,
and  Mr.  President, last thing I will say is
I know that this is absolutely
not. The last thing we hear about
Cliff Purtle. I'm not going
to be surprised if I'm reading in
the, the Wall Street Journal
or the Albuquerque Journal,
uh Cliff Purtle
Esquire, Attorney, Cliff Purtle
did this or that or
Cliff Pirtle the farmer did is
now an attorney and doing
this or that for the people. So
I just want to recognize him and I think
he's done a great job here and I know he's
going on to much bigger and better
things and he's just an all around
good guy. Thank you. Thank
you, Senator for the
senators. Thank
you so much,  Mr.  President. I, I
know we're, we're basically out of time
now, but I, I just have one
word, uh, when
I think about Cliff Purtle
and that word is liberty
and I just very much
respect and,
and, and so much
his,
um, hi, his view on
individual liberty.
So Cliff
Purtle
Liberty.
Thank you. Thank you for your
friendship. Thank you,
Senator Senator
Gonzalez to round it off.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And, uh, also
to, uh, Senator Perle,
you know, the best of luck, you
know, but one
thing that we both had in
common is
for years and years, he
tried daylight saving
time and I tried
standard time
and, uh, some years
he gained momentum and then some
years I gained momentum, but
I guess we're never gonna find out,
but we still have a
large group of
citizens out there that
refer to be in one
time, one
time zone on the, on
our time. But um,
again, uh thank
you for everything. Thank you for all your
work and uh good
luck. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator Gonzalez.
Senator
Morris,
Senator
Morris.
Thing was pre uh president
and you know,
when, um, when I
got here, when you were still
serving with us,  Mr.  President,
I was the fifth youngest
member of the chamber that
year. Um
12 years
later,
12 years later,
Cliff Pirtle is still five
years younger than when I
first got here. That tells
you his accomplishment. I don't
know where I am in the pecking order anymore. I'm
sure it's much higher now.
But then also that, that second
day we were here, you remember  Mr.  President,
there was an article frontpage Albury
Journal that had
the giant slayer, big
picture of him, the giant
slayer in
jeans.
You might remember  Mr.  President the very
next day there was a memo from the
previous floor leader
saying you shall not wear
jeans on the senate
floor. And I
hope that continues uh uh
that, that, that because this is an
August body and it's a shrine
to the people and no one
treated it more with more
respect than Cliff Purtle.
He's a, he's a great man,
Mackenzie. You are a lucky woman
and your Children are gonna be so
happy with this man raising you for
many, many years to come.
I love you buddy with the,
the members will
rise and thank our
good friend and colleague Cliff
Pearl,
Senator Cliff Purtle. The floor
is yours.
Thank you,  Mr.
President.
You know, it's risky giving me the
microphone with only a minute
45 to go and try to put a
shot clock on me.
Um You know, I'm tempted
to uh run it
out as I have in the past.
Um
but I don't know what I
did to deserve that.
That was probably the most punishing
thing mostly because
I wasn't allowed to leave the chamber.
And I think that's the most time I've ever
spent continually
in this, in this
room. So that, that
part was, was quite the
punishment. But,
you know, I, I really
appreciate what everybody said.
I'm glad there's double doors
going out because I'm gonna need it for
my head to fit.
Um, but,
you know,
every single one of you mean so
much to me
and I, and I know it transcends
past this building
and that's
a message that I try to
hammer home over and over
again. That
what we do
here
is not as important as what
we do
out.
What do you, what do you do
when someone needs the door to be
open? Do you open the
door? What
do you do when you see somebody with a flat
tire?
My son is always, uh
giving me a hard time. He says, dad, are
we gonna help those people
too?
Yes.
Every single
person.
And so
that's what I hope my
legacy is
and I hope that's what every single
one of you, your legacy
is
outside of this room.
Help
people.
Thank you,
Senator Cliff
Purtle,
Senator Pic Campos.
Thank you very much,
Mr.  President

majority author Peter Worth.
Thank you, Mister President. So we
are going to go to third reading
on today's calendar
items. 1112,
13 and 14.
We'll start there and see how
we're doing. Item number
11 is House Bill 270.
That will be Senator Souls
item 12 House Bill
207 Senator
Maestas item
13, House bill 98
Senator Rodriguez
and item 14 House
Bill 303 as
amended with Senator Sadilla Law
Lopez. Uh So
with that,  Mr.  President
Unanimous consent, we go to
that our business third reading of
legislation and I yield
to Senator Souls for
item number 11. House Bill
270 is amended hearing
no objection. We're in that
order of business third reading of legislation,
I'll yield to Senator
Bill.
So
thank you,  Mr.  President.
I ask unanimous consent
of the Senate that the records show that all
actions for placing
House Bill 270
as amended
uh on final
passage has been taken and that
is now subject to debate amendment
or substitution hearing. No
objection. Senators
explained the bill.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Uh
This bill deals with
the TEF the Technology
Enhancement Fund
which is a fund used by
higher education.
Um It's gonna be thought of
as it's a closing fund
for grants,
uh universities when they go out
for large research grants
have to come up with some
percentage of matching
costs, some of that can be made
up with things
like in kind of
space, uh
faculty support and other
things. But often there's a very
large cash amount
that needs to be there. In
the past, our higher education
research institutions
have had to turn down large
grants because they did not
have the money to meet the
match. This allows
using state fund money
to make the match that
was already passed. What this
does is it goes
through and
clarifies
some of the review panel
that looks through the research to
ensure that it is appropriate
for the matching grant
that it is often
spread across the research
institutions and it
clarifies some
about which institutions
are eligible and for
how much and with that, I'd be
happy to stand for questions.
Thank you, Senator Sews. We
do
have
Senator Pat. Thank
you,  Mr.  President fully in
support. You have consent
to excuse Senator Correa
Hemphill until she returns to the chamber except for
the purposes of a call. See, no
objection. Thank you, Senator,
Senator
Senator. So
we, we do have debate,
Senator. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I do
have just a couple
of questions here if the responses were
deald senators.
Yes, mister President.
So mister President and
Senator, which,
which New Mexico Schools
would, would qualify for this.
Which ones are the research
schools?
Senator Souls?
Mr.  President, the research schools
are New Mexico State University,
uh New Mexico Tech in
Socorro Un M and
Navajo Technical
Institute.
Ok. Mister President, I wanted to make
sure that it included
Navajo Tech because
clearly they're a research
one. And Mister
President and Senator,
how much money does
this does this
have? And what will that
match with federal
money? Thank you,
Senator Senator
Mr.  President. The
current House Bill two appropriation
is $25 million
for 2025 for the
TEF 10 million of
that would be drawn from the general
fund. 15 million
additional authorized spending would
be drawn from the technology
enhancement Fund. Uh
This last year, approximately
13 million was actually put
out and brought in over
$100 million
worth of research
grants. Uh Universities
have to come up with at least half
of what the match would be
or through other sources,
some of that could be through in
kind. Thank you,
Senator Souls. And then
finally,  Mr.  President,
there's a review board. I I
believe you talked about a review
board there who
is on that board and how do they
get there?
Senator Souls.  Mr.
President, the review
board initially was set
up as members of the Epsco
which are the research universities
and collaboration. Uh
Mostly it is
the V or
the V Pr
S, the vice president of research at
each of the institutions are the ones
that serve on that with also
representation from Higher Ed.
And there may be a few others from the
labs.
All right. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator. Any further
debate, Senator
Brent?
Thank you, Mister President. Would the
sponsor yield? Senator Souls
do yield
mister President, Senator
Brandt? Thank you,  Mr.
President and, and
Senator.
So,
can you help me understand
a little bit of what are we
closing that these funds are
for
Mr.  President? The, the closing
funds? Um,
again, when there's a
large research grant,
the it often
requires a match.
Uh, the match in some cases
can be as high as 30%.
So if you're going out for a $10
million match and you
have to come up with 30%
match, the universities
would have to come up with 3
million. They
don't have that in their basic
budgets. And therefore in the
past have had to turn
down these large research grants
just because of lack of funding.
The way it's currently set up
is the research, the universities
would have to come up with at least
50% of the match
and the other 50% would
be out of this closing fund.
Essentially when they go and put
out for the grant, the money is put
into escrow. If you
will, if they get
the, the big
grant, then the money would flow
out. If they are not awarded
the grant, then the money would go back
into the taf.
Thank you, Senator. So Senator
Brent, thank you, Mister
President. And these are
the
research
institutions. That's,
that's why they
exist correct.
Senator. So mister President.
Yes,
Mister President. What kind of
endowment funds
do these institutions
have?
Mr.  President? I do not
know. Thank
you, Senator, Senator
Brand  Mr.  President.
It's just, you know,
I've, I've supported these
through the years but, you
know, I'm starting to wonder
with what's happened with our universities
over the last couple of years,
especially this last
year.
And they've got, I don't
know about these four
because I didn't
think about asking before
today.
But I know a lot of these universities
have millions and
millions and
millions and some of
them billions of
dollars in
endowment funds.
And I'm just kind of wondering why
aren't those endowment funds since
these are research
institutions?
Why aren't those endowment
funds being used
for these matches? Do you
know Senator,
why they don't use their endowment funds
for these Senator
Brant Mister President?
I do not know why they are
not my guess.
And I am just speculating
but the endowments tend
to be for things and do not
include research,
matching funds
for it. But I do not know.
Thank you, Senator Senator
Mister President. That's, that's really
interesting to me
that
a research
institution,
a research
college
would have
endowment
funds.
I said some around the country
have billions in
endowment
funds
and
yet
they wouldn't use those
for matching funds
for research
even though that is their
purpose.
I, I just, I don't, what else
are those endowment funds used
for?
Thank you, Senator Senator
Souls,  Mr.
President. Uh the
how other endowment funds are
used is really not part of
this uh but endowments
at universities are used for a wide
range of things from doing capital
projects to promotion
to buying
of
endowed seats and other kinds
of
things.
Mr.  President, Senator, I, I've
never heard that last one buying
faculty and dowed
seats. What is
that,
Mr.  President? Again, this does
not deal with the directly what
this bill does, but
in many cases, endowed
seats are where money is put
similar to what we're doing with
funds in and then the
interest off of those pays
for the faculty salary for an
endowed seat.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I, I
just, I just want to
raise this concern and,
and I, I think I
will spend
some time this year asking each
one of these universities what their
endowment funds are and what they're
used for
because we have, we've really
seen some issues, I
think in the
last
year and really called
out in the last six
months
with uh our national
universities. Um
and I don't think we've gotten
really good answers even
from our own state universities
such as UN M and New Mexico
State.
But, uh,
you know, when it, when it comes
to
uh certain issues
and, and I'm not going to bring those up on the
floor today.
But, you
know, I
think we need to
know before we're
using taxpayer
dollars
to supplement
the universities, what they're
doing with their endowment
funds and
what they're using those funds
for because
these are supposed to be
research
institutions. That
is their primary
role. That's why they
exist.
And yet we keep being told
they don't have money for matching
funds for
research.
So it seems like to me that if
anything, their endowment fund
should be used for, it should be
for
research.
Um And
so
I, I think we need to take a real
serious look at what our universities
are using their endowment funds
for. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Brent.
Any further debate,
senators
seeing no further debate,
Senator Souls to close
on the bill.  Mr.
President, I move that house
bill 270 as
amended. Do
now pass, I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records
show that the role has been called
and that all those present
voted in the affirmative, except
those voting in the negative by a
show of
hands.
Senators. We are voting. All senators

No,
Senator Sanchez voting.
No Senator
mccutcheon voting.
No
by a vote of 32 in the
affirmative six in the negative
house bill 270 as
amended has passed
the Senate Senator Souls.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Our research
universities are major economic
drivers in their community
and for the state, this
allows them to keep leveraging
huge federal grants
with a relatively small
amount from the state.
And moving forward. I think
that we will see that becoming an
information state is
going to be part of our new economic
plans. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Soza. Yield to
Senate majority Florida Peter Worth
for the next order of business. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. We're going to take a quick
break to introduce the guest.
Unanimously. We go that business
announcements and miscellaneous
and ideal to Senator
Schmidty's like
Mercedes, Senator Smis
like Mercedes
hearing no objection.
Finish
Mercedes.
Thank you uh
Mr.  President.
And you know,
um Children are a
heritage from the Lord.
The these girls right here

she is a budding extrovert. If
you come in over here and talk to her, she
will ask you 100 and 25
questions. And
so uh just my,
my heritage right here,  Mr.
President. And if the members of
you could uh welcome them
to the body. Thank
you.
Thank you, Senator
Senator
Stewart.
Thank you Mister President. Today
I have a guest. This is David
Trujillo.
David has been a board
operator for the rules in the
judiciary committee all
session. And we've become
friends. He's going to U AND M
in the fall Political
Science. He's a
community organizer and
he just got elected vice
chair of the LGBT
Q caucus and the
State Democratic Party.
So we'll be seeing a lot
of David. He was really
helpful. Help me welcome my
guest, David
Trujillo.
Thank you, Senator Stewart Senate majority
leader, Peor. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. You said we
go back to that order of business
third reading of legislation.
And I yield to Senator Maestas
for item number 12, House
Bill 207. As
amended, there are no objection. We
are on that order of business announces
miscellany, I'm sorry. Third
reading of legislation. I yield to
Senator Maestas. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. This is House
Bill 207
as amended. Uh
I ask unanimous consent of the Senate
that the records show that all action for
placing House Bill
207 as amended uh
on final passage has been
taken and that is now subject to
debate amendment or substitution
hearing. No objection.
Senator me explain.
Uh Thank you,  Mr.  President. So
House Bill 207
is a small tweak to the statute
which facilitates
uh uh public
school capital outlay grants.
Um and it changes are
made to a shell to
help uh with loan
applications with that. All stand
for
questions.
We do you have debate?
Senator
Thank you, Mister President.
So I I do have a question if the
sponsor were yield.
Senator Mai Mister
President. Yes.
So Mister
President and Senator, as I looked at
this, it looked like it was
also for lease
agreements. So,
is that part of the capital
outlay grants
program?
Mr.  President Senator?
Yes, it
it deals with
the,
the answer is.
Yes.
So, so  Mr.  President
and Senator do our
public schools lease any
facilities. I thought we
owned all of our facilities.
Thank you,  Mr.  President Senator.
So charter schools may
lease at first and do
a lease uh to purchase
agreement. But yeah, the
goal is to
uh to purchase the property and
I think statute says
they have to do it within five
years.
Ok,  Mr.  President and Senator.
So this would really be for
charter schools uh leasing
then not, not
the normal
uh public
schools.
Mr.  President Senator, yes, the
charter schools within the public
school system.
Ok. Is there a cap
on, on the leasing  Mr.
President to
per square
foot or per
gross dollar amount or
anything like that?  Mr.  President
Senator? I don't believe so.
Uh if so that would be
in current statute. The only thing this
bill does is,
is a changes are made
to a shall, doesn't change
anything from a practical standpoint,
but the bankers freak out on the
word may that they may get
paid this year.
So this bill would suggest
they shall uh get
paid  Mr.
President that clears it up
completely for me
because I understand I wouldn't
wanna, I wouldn't wanna
least a building to somebody that
may pay me some day.
Might so. Yes,
absolutely. So, I'm in favour,
Mr.
President,
Senator. My,
I apologize. Seeing
no further
debate,
Senator, my is to
close
Mr.  President. I move that
house bill 207
as amended. Do
now pass
and I, uh,
and ask unanimous consent of the
Senate  Mr.  President that the
records show that the roll has been
called and all those
present voted in the affirmative. We accept
those in the negative by a show of
hands. Thank you, Senator Senator.
We are all senators to your
seats if you
wish to vote. No,
please raise your
hand
by a vote of 36 in the affirmative
zero in the negative House bill 207
as amended has passed
the Senate Senator Maestas. Thank you,  Mr.
President member.
We're gonna go on to the next bill that's
gonna be
House Bill 98 and I'll
yield to Senator
Rodriguez. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records
show that all action for placing
house bill 98
on final passage has been
taken and that it is now subject
to debate, amendment or substitution
hearing no objection. Senator
Rodriguez. You've explained the bill. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. This is
a small bill
but it goes a long way.
It brings us in compliance
with federal law
regarding the
Act for people with
disabilities. Uh,
the Able Act is a federal
program that is overseen here
in New Mexico by the state treasurer's
office and it allows
people with disabilities to be
able to save a little
money if they can from their
small disability
check. And,
uh, and yet not, uh, not
have it affect their Medicaid
or Social Security benefits and
so on, uh, the
federal government has,
uh, changed and
increase the age
limit by which a person
can claim the onset of a
disability. Currently, it's,
if you're 26 or up
to 26 years old,
and this one changes it
to 46 years old, which
is going to help many veterans
and other people
who have not, who have
fallen through the cracks and who have not been
able to qualify.
Uh, so this just brings
us in line with the federal
government's, um, uh,
new change and
it also puts into
statute that there would
be no clawbacks
from our Medicaid
programs. For example,
um, the Medicaid
program cannot claw
back any savings. That
is that the person
has saved in this able
account. Uh, and
that able account proceeds are
used like for health care costs
and education. Other
things that, um, that
the person with disabilities
can use it for.
Thank you, Senator
Rodriguez,
Senator
Woods.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. If
a good senator
would yield for a question
or two Thank you,
Senator Woods. Senator Rodriguez
do yield  Mr.  President. Yes,
Senator Woods, I
will,
Mr.  President.
It says that
able accounts are federally
credited tax advantage
savings accounts.
Um,
to me,
tell me how that works. A
federally credited
tax advantage
saving account. So there's some
kind of tax advantage
to this some way.
Tell me what that tax
advantage is. Mister
President. Thank you, Mister
President, Senator Woods. What it is
is a disabled person, for
example, would get a small
disability check, social
security or supplemental
security income, for example.
And when they get that check,
uh, if they're able to put
away from their
tiny, truly small
check, anything into
savings into this able
account that they
open. If they want
open it, they're not required,
then whatever they earn,
if it's a little interest
or whatever it may be,
you know, cannot be
taxed
and
also it allows
them to save that money. Kind of like a
deferred, a
deferred plan
that we know it as
so. That's really
all it does. Yeah.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Yeah, from what I understand,
Mr.  President, it defers
any tax
occurring on those
accounts,
Mr.  President. Yes, Senator.
That's what it does for them,
but most of them don't have
a whole lot in there because the
maximum  Mr.  President
Senator, the maximum they can
in a lifetime
have is ongoing
is $18,000
in the savings
and, and that's, you know, not
good, but that's what they're
allowed. Thank
you, Senator Rodriguez. Thank
you.
Thank you any
further debate. Senators,
Senator Brent.
Thank you,  Mr.  President with the sponsor
yield. Senator
Rodriguez G Yield. Thank you,
Mr.  President. Yes, Senator Brandt, I
will thank you,
Mr.  President. And
I
really didn't see this bill
until this morning when I was reading through
what we were, we were working on
and, and I don't really understand
the issue. Um,
but you, you made a statement
that this will help our veterans. Can
you explain how,
Because I don't know if any
veterans that have any of these
types of accounts? Yes,
absolutely. Um,
it will. Currently,
the requirement is
that if you have a
bi a disability, the
onset of that disability
has to occur by the time
you're 26 years
old. Well, that leaves
many people out if you
get disabled when you're
2728 or
30 or 40.
And so this
here changes
it to comply with
the federal change that
allows people to
qualify
with a disability
up to the age of 46
years old. So
several veterans
will be able to come into
this now and,
and other people, not only veterans,
but it is going to help a large amount
of our veterans because they can,
the onset of the disability
can come in up to
the age of 46
instead of 26 which
was too
low.
Thank you, Mister President
Senator.
So, what kind of
disability are we talking about
here? Is it any disability?
Is it 100% disability.
What, what type of disability?
Mister President, any
type of disability that
is rendered as
disabled per
the current standards of the
federal government? And this
Able Act, the Able
Act is a, is
stands for achieving a
better life Expectancy
Act and it's been in place for
many years.
And so, Mister President,
you, you stated that it's to
bring us into
compliance
with the federal change
where the federal government changed it from
26 to
40
six.
Um,
and that's when they would need to have this
account by right, if,
if they, they
would need to open this account by time
they're 46. Is that the way that
works, Mister
President Senator
Brant. Yes,
the onset of the disability would
have to occur by the time you're
46 and
so you can apply for
this account. Yes, at the
time you become disabled.
And, um,
basically the,
the
federal government
has made this change and
because we administer
the program overseeing,
we oversee it through the state
treasurer's office, this
would make, bring us in line, make
us compliant.
Thank you,
Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator. I
still, I
am not sure which type of
a disabilities
count for this. That's
something I'll have to look into
because I don't think it's every
disability
and you know,
like they only give
you a
tax break
if you're blind
or, you know, there's
certain disabilities that actually
get, you know, that you can
writeoff on your taxes.
Is that what we're talking
about here or do you know
Mr.  President Senator,
when a person is disabledd,
pursuant to the standards
that we know for
disability? So supplemental
security income or SSD,
I supplemental
security
income, it's through social
security. Um,
that is what the
federal government looks at
to allow people to open
an account to save without
impacting other benefits like
Medicaid or Social
Security or anything else.
Because right now
currently, um
I if you have
so much, there's a
threshold for people who are
disabled can save and if you
pass that threshold,
then it starts
affecting benefits and so on.
So I think this is really a
good bill. Thank you.
Thank you, Mister President. Thank you,
Senator. You know, one of my
concerns is always now
the, when the federal
government changed the
Enable Act
or the Able Act, sorry.
Did they require
states to change this or is this
just something we're wanting to do?
Because I really don't like the
justification of we're just
trying to comply with
federal. Thank
you, Senator Senator
Rodriguez, Mister President.
If we're going
to continue to
administer this
program here at
the State of New Mexico,
then we should administer
it pursuant to federal
law and
federal changes,
that's really what we're doing.
Yeah, we don't, we can't, as
we know we can't have our own laws
that conflict with federal
laws and this
truly is a long overdue
bill. I can't believe
that the age limit is 26
either you have to become
disabled by 26 just
to open a savings account
with, with the disability
benefits, which are very
small. This here will
give you a chance to,
to
have a threshold of 46
years old. And if you become
disabled
any time prior
to the 46 year old
birthday, then
you can have this abled
account. It's a savings
that you can
save something and not be
impacted for your other
benefits.
Thank you,  Mr.  President and
Senator. I, I,
I, I guess my question was and
I, I have no problem with the bill
itself. Um, I probably
will vote for it.
But, um,
did the federal
government require us
to change this?
And I think the answer
is no. But, but do
you know that
mister President? I, I
do have someone
out here that's
nodding to me that they don't
require it to do
it, require the State of New
Mexico to do
this. But
it's something that I
believe wholeheartedly needs to be
done to help more people that are
disabled. Thank you. Thank you, Senator
Rodriguez. Senator. Thank
you, Mister President. Thank you, Senator. And
I don't disagree with that. I'm,
I'm just, you
know, I, I just don't ever like
the justification on the floor
that, well, the, we're going to
comply with the federal government
because we actually could say,
have a different standard than
the federal government for these
accounts because
my understanding is that what this
does is
the federal government has their
own tax system. You know, we
all will have to pay
into that by or, or file
that by October 15th.
That's one of those days
in our lives that we all, you know, get
to think about going forward.
Um, but we also have a
tax form and this,
my understanding just makes it
where that
that
account
wouldn't,
they wouldn't have to pay taxes on
our state for
also if
their disability started by the
age of 46 on
this savings account. Is that
correct? Mister President
Senator? Yes, that's my
understanding. But it doesn't do
only that one of the
biggest things it does is
that it
raises the age
threshold to 46
years old by which a person
can, a disabled
person can have an onset
of a disability and not
after, after you pass
26. Then currently
you can't, it doesn't matter if you're disabled
or not, you can't open a savings
account. So,
thank you. Thank you, Mister
President. Thank you, Senator.
You can't open this savings
account because I have
several savings
accounts.
So you can have a
savings account. You just can't open this
one that allows you to, to have
this money that doesn't count against
you on certain things.
So, you know, I just, I just want to
make sure we're clear and, and
you know that that's understood.
Um, I, I think it's,
you know, it's a fine, it's
fine. Um, I, I
may look into it. I've never
used this account.
Um, I've never even thought
about it but,
uh, you know, I, I think
there,
um,
you know, not, not having to pay
taxes on that and being able to put
that savings into, you
know, into savings. So
when they withdraw that money, they also
don't have to pay taxes on it. Isn't
that correct? They only pay taxes
when they get the money
originally on their taxes
if they have a tax
burden.  Mr.
President, Senator
Senator Brandt. That is
correct. And, and
it's used for, with certain
criteria, it's already established,
like for medical costs
or education
expenses and so on.
That's what it is. Thank you
and you, and you're right, the
savings account I'm talking
about and I guess I didn't make
it clear. Is this one
that we're presenting today through
this Able Act?
Thank you,  Mr.  President and, and
thank you, Senator and
I appreciate you sponsoring the
bill over here on this
side and, and I hope that
uh, disabled persons can,
can use this,
um,
do need, I think I need to look
at what type of disabilities
because the federal government is very
limited on what type of
disabilities they, they
allow to,
to receive any of these benefits.
Our state is much more generous.
By the way, when it comes
to the
benefits it provides for
disabled persons way
more generous than the federal government.
And so I think we
always need to, to
call that out because
our state does a great job
with providing
benefits to
persons with disabilities,
much, much greater than the
federal government does. So. Thank you,
Senator, appreciate you bringing this.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Brandt. Any further
debate?
Senators
seeing no further debate, Senator
Rodriguez to close on the bill?
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
move that house Bill 98
do now pass and I ask
unanimous consent of the Senate that the
records show that the role has been
called and all those present
vote in the affirmative except those
voting in the negative by show of
hands.
Thank you, Senators. We are
voting all senators to your seats,
please.
If you wish to vote, no, please
raise your
hand
by a vote of 40 in the affirmative
zero in the negative. House Bill
98 has
passed the Senate. Senator Rodriguez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President, members of
the Senate. Thank you. I'm
gonna go on to the next item on
the calendar that's going to
be item number 14 and that's going
to be House Bill 303.
As twice amended, I'll yield to
Senator Lopez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I ask unanimous consent of
the Senate that the records show that all
action for placing Senate
Bill 303. I mean
House Bill 303
on final passage has been
taken and that it is now
subject to debate, amendment or
substitution hearing. No
objection. Senators
Lopez if you explain the bill,
thank you,  Mr.  President
House Bill. 3303
would create a three year pilot
program within the adult education
division of New Mexico's
um higher.
I'm sorry, I was looking
to see, ok. Uh
New Mexico's Higher Ed Department
to provide recurring monetary
stipends to low-income adult
workers enrolled in time
limitted workforce integrated
education programs
known as IET
programs. The maximum
amount of monthly stipends would
be $1000 and would
not exceed one year.
This would be determined. This
will be determined by
regional cost of living indicators
and other criteria set up
by the adult education
division.
With that  Mr.  President, I stand
for questions.
Thank you, Senator C Lopez
Senators. We are debating
House Bill 303 is twice
amended and I'll yield to
Senator chair. Thank
you,  Mr.  President.
First,
a thing we might have to check
with the chief
clerk, but I
believe that the motion
was that House Bill
303 do
now pass
but it wasn't 303 as
amended. So if we're going to do it,
we need to make sure that's in
there. Thank
you,
Mr.  President. Thank you very
much for that for
that reminder. House Bill
303 has amended
twice.
Um Senator, if you
go ahead and just go through the script
on the closing from the beginning
of that closing,
the
closing,
I ask unanimous consent
of the Senate that the record
show that all action for placing
House Bill 303 on
final has just as
twice amended on final passage
has been taken. And that is now
subject to debate, amendment
or substitution. And
I want to thank the new Senator
Campos, Senator Jamil
for his coaching. Thank you,
Senator Celia Lopez. And I
apologize, I, I think I'm
confusing you as well. So I apologize
for that seeing
no
objection,
Senator share to
debate.
Thank you, Mister President. And
I do have some questions on this
particular bill if the sponsor will
yield. Yes, Mister
President, I
yield.
First of
all
if I understand. So this is
10 of funds
the higher ed is going
to administer.
Is that the way I read this, Mister
President? No,  Mr.
President, the bill was
amended to remove
the Tiff
TANF funds
has the funding source for
this. That was how the bill
initially started. But along the
way that was
omitted, the,
the now the funds are located in the,
in the house in the
HB two
on, I believe it's
page
uh
241.
Um So the A allocation
is House Bill two and they are not
using tenant funds and
that was changed.
Ok. So
Mr.  President and Senator
there still has to be a fiscal
agent is the fiscal agent
of the higher ed department.
The higher ed department
is not only the fiscal agent, they will be
running the program.
So  Mr.
President,
since this is a workforce
program, why
is the Department of Workforce
Solutions not
running this program,
Mr.  President, this
is um a
combination program.
These individuals that are
targeted by this program are
very, very hard
individuals to move
up the economic ladder
ladder. They are individuals
who do not have a high
school diploma, for
example. And so
they're working on their high school
diploma simul well,
simultaneously working
on job skills to bring them
into the uh
into the
workforce
center share.
So
that even confused me some more,
Mr.  President.
So do
you have to not have a
high school diploma to get
to get this
stipend?
Um Well, this is in the
adult education
department but may  Mr.
President I ask unanimous
consent to
um invite my experts into
the chamber. It is uh
Amber Gallup who
is a director of Adult Education
within HED
and Marcela Diaz who
is the executive director
of Sob Pueblo
Unido. Thank you. See, no
objection,
Sergeant Arms. If you can please
escort our expert witnesses into
the chamber
and provide some seating for
them
center once they get
situated. If you can ask your
question.
Once again,
please,
Daniel
Center share.
Um
ok. Thank you,  Mr.  President
and Senator. So
just a few minutes
ago
when I asked why
this was not in workforce
solutions, you made a comment
if I if I remember this
right
about
the people that would be
involved in this
would not have a high school
diploma. Is there a
requirement that they do not
have a high school diploma?
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I spoke to my expert and
all of these individuals are
already in an adult
education program to
be eligible for the stipend.
They will have. There are
individuals who do not have their
high school diploma
and or need
to learn English as a second
language.
Ok,  Mr.
President. So
is is adult education
part of the higher ed
department.
Yes,  Mr.  President, I have
the director right here with me. He's my
expert.
OK,  Mr.  President.
So I, as I, as I
looked at this bill
and if I bring it back to life
here, it
um in
definitions, it says
uh participant
uh means a New Mexico
resident,
my concern with this and I've
seen this in other places,
is somebody from
Texas or New York
can, can come to New
Mexico
um rent a
place and now they are a New Mexico
resident and now New Mexico
taxpayers are going to pay
for the Texan and
that doesn't quite sound fair. So
how do we know they're New Mexican? How
do we define that? They're a New Mexico
resident.
Uh  Mr.  President residency
is defined um as it
is in all cases
for, for different,
for voting for
um
enrolling in public school
for. So anybody who
moved to the state and intends
to reside here.
Um
I think the two criteria intends
to, to move here
physically and intend
to make this their permanent
abode.
So mister President,
this was an objection.
I had to the opportunity
scholarship
because this is a
free program for
a new Mexico resident.
But they could have been a New Mexico
resident for just a
few weeks. So
they come here, they
rent an apartment, they get
the utilities turned into their
name. So now
they have a lease, they have a utility
bill. They've been here for
30
days.
What they're really looking for is free
education at the
expense of New Mexico
taxpayers.
And so
in my mind, there should
be
some kind of qualification
to make sure that New Mexico taxpayers
are paying for New
Mexicans. And I don't
see that anywhere in this bill.
So is there, is there a
safeguard? Thank
you, Mister President Higher
Ed. Just as an example, higher
ed. In order to get in-state
tuition, you have to wait for an
entire year before
you're eligible for in-state
tuition. Um This
program, they verify
residency and
um as I said
to be eligible for this program,
they already have to be
enrolled in the program.
So they've been here for some
period of time
already.
Um And
the thing is, is you don't
know when somebody moves here from
Texas. Uh How
long they're gonna stay? Um,
I know there are several of you in the
legislature who have made this
your, your permanent home
from different states. And I think
that's amazing and wonderful
that to have people come and contribute
to our
state.
Mr.  President and
Senator,
I'm, I'm all in favour
of people coming and becoming New
Mexicans
and then
contributing to our economy,
helping the state
with whatever it is they
do. I think that's great
and we need more of that
actually.
But what we don't need are,
are people coming to New
Mexico
just for a free
education.
And so even in this
case, if they showed up and they enrolled
in this program, how long do they have to
be in this program
before they qualify for this
stipend
New Mexico? I mean,  Mr.
President, I, as I said,
they have to be New Mexico
residents. And
I want to tell you a story,  Mr.
President about when I
was in uh Mexico.
Um I spent
a summer teaching at the University of
Guanajuato. And my
Children were accepted very
warmly into the schools,
the public schools and we had
resided there a day before
they uh accepted my
Children. Um when
my son fell and
split his lip,
um I was able to go to
one of the, the
clinics and they
um sewed him up
immediately because
they knew that it
was important to treat people
who are a and I didn't
have an intention to stay in
Mexico, but they treated
people there as people
should be treated. Um
And, and that is what
this program is. A, is about,
as I said, they are already
enrolled in the program. So they have
been, they have been here some
period of
time.
So mister President,
let's not, let's not
confuse
how we
treat human beings.
I, I
did not go down that path. I'll
never go down that
path.
Humans are
humans.
Humans are humans and we don't
need to be going down a path where
we're starting to imply
that somehow I don't like
humans or I don't like particular
humans.
Mr.  President, I apologize.
New Mexico taxpayers are
going to pay for this.
So how does it benefit New
Mexico? That's where
I'm getting. Not who the human
is.
New Mexico taxpayers are going
to pay for
this.
I don't care if they come from
Mexico or Russia or
wherever, except
maybe
Texas.
I just want them to be New
Mexicans if we're going to pay
for it. So some
of the things that we talked
about in, in
the course of our time here
was how, how do we attract
doctors and get the
doctors to go to rural
areas? So, outside of
the Rio Grande Corridor,
basically.
And so even
though we didn't do it, certainly
the discussion wasn't
where the doctor came from. It's
how you keep the doctor
here
So is there anything in this
program that says if they want to
be a health
care
worker that
they have a requirement to stay
in New Mexico for
X years or months
or, or whatever? Is there any?
So that's kind of where I'm going.
How do, how does,
how do we get the return
on investment for training
somebody? Thank you,
Mr.  President. That is an excellent
question. And on page four of the
bill, um the,
the
bill asked the department
to identify and approve workforce
training programs in
the following priority
areas. Uh industries
or fields, health care,
including behavioural health,
early childhood education
or care, natural
resources management,
renewable energy,
broadband expansion,
first responders,
construction industries,
aerospace
Biosciences,
cybersecurity,
film and television,
outdoor recreation,
sustainable agriculture,
intelligent manufacturing
and global trade. Those
have been identified as
priority areas
um by um
the workforce department
and the, and the
economic development department.
And so the idea is to
get
hard, difficult to
reach disengaged
rural and low wage
workers who
experience many financial
barriers to participating in
traditional workforce development
and skills, build building
training programs. And
what this does is it will
advance their, their
work opportunities and
of course, contribute
to the benefit of our
state.
Thank you, Senator Lopez,
Senator.
So Mister
President, as, as you go
through this list on page
four,
so early childhood
education, but
further down it talks
about
aerospace.
So what
do you do in aerospace
without a, without
a, at least a bachelor's
degree, maybe a phd?
And how do
they
if they start out with
no diploma at all, how long are
they in this program
to be able to be
doing something with aerospace
or Biosciences?
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Both
Biosciences and
um and aerospace
are big industries
that require people
with many, many skills.
And um
because it's such a big industry,
there are many technical jobs
in which an advanced
degree is not required,
but a high school degree is.
And this is what helps them
achieve
that.
And of course, it's coupled with
training, Mister President.
Thank you, Senator Cilia Lopez,
Senator Chair.
So mister
President,
ok, there just seems to be a big
difference between early childhood
education and
aerospace. But I
also see in here some
of the other things and I'm
just trying to get a sense
for, for
at what level are we doing
things? So, construction
industries, I'm
assuming that means plumbers
and electricians and
carpenters and things like that. Is
that right? Absolutely,
Mister President.
So  Mr.  President.
So
to get this in my
mind, so I
show up, I
don't have a high school
diploma, but I
want to be a plumber.
So this
program helps me get
a high school diploma
and then get a go
through the trade school. So I get a
certificate or
does it just do part of that?
What's really unique and special
about this program is it allows
you to do both
simultaneously?
Thank you, Senator CIA Lopez,
Senator Share.
So  Mr.  President,
one of the other things that we
talked about
was
uh English language
learners.
And so some of this
um you know, being a
plumber, maybe not, but
uh certainly some of these
other
things
pretty much require
fluency in English
or that that whole
business be
speaking another
language. So
how long does it take to, to
go from no
diploma to fluency
to then
renewable
energy?
Thank you, Senator
Senator
Mr.  President. The program
is for a year
of this particular program is
uh provides a supplement for
a year. Different people
have different levels
of, of English when they come
into the program, different
levels of skills. Um
So their part, their path
will probably
vary. Um
but what's really important
is that this
program will identify
the barriers that they
have and allow
them in an evidence-based
way. Um A sty
uh to participate
in this program
and they will get both adult
education and
the, the English language
skill training
necessary uh so
that they can achieve
their goal
and, and, and what
this program does is it
helps them get into the
workforce faster
than they would have if
they had to do it first
get your he for your
um GED
and then go and, or
get your, your high school diploma
and then go participate in
a program. So that is
the beauty of this program and in
other states where it's been tried,
um It's been very
successful. Thank
you, Senator CIA Lopez, Senator
Share.
So
Mr.  Pro
Mr.
Mr.  President,
the program
you talked about a oneyear
stipend. But I,
I thought I saw and
I'm looking for it now that
it was a three year,
a three year program that, that
they would receive the stipend for
three years. So what,
where am I missing this mister
madam?
Senator?
I, I apologize. It was my
mistake. It is a three year
program.
Thank you, Senator Lopez Senator
share. Ok.
So  Mr.
President, so the stipend,
then they, they enrol in the
program
and they would receive a stipend
for three years while they got their
diploma, while they would got their
certificate, while
they would become fluent in
English, or at least fluent enough
to, to do the
the job at hand.
Uh So,
so II I, if it were
me, I could have the stipend for
three
years.
Thank you,
Mr.  President.
Again, my mistake. It
is a three year
pilot program but
no individual participating
in the program would receive
the stipend
for more than one
year. Thank
you. All
right,  Mr.  President.
So
I think we've got that cleared up as
we were talking past each other. And
so I, I apologize
that I was trying to keep up there.
So why,
why the stipend? What's the
purpose of the stipend,  Mr.
President? Thank
you,  Mr.  President. That is such
a good question because
what the studies have
shown is with
individuals who are
labelled difficult to
reach uh disengaged
rural, low age workers
with ha they have many
financial barriers.
Um One of them is lack of
affordable childcare options
and transportation,
especially in rural
areas, inadequate
support services for New
Mexicans. Um
uh uh other
support pers uh support
services that they might need.
Like tutoring, lack
of computer equipment and
reliable internet access.
They may have debt that they need
to deal with. That is affecting
them low wages,
inflexible work
schedules. Um
I know some people are participating
in two jobs and
therefore they cannot get
training. So this
would allow them to perhaps get,
uh, let go of one of those
jobs so that they can
put food on the table, support their
families and engage
in this training. Um And
what's lovely about this program
that I've learned? Um,
actually a few months ago
is, um, how
successful it's been when
it's been tried is to
identify the barriers to
people who are stuck in these
um these
situations
that just a little
bit of money, um which
isn't a handout, but a hand
up could help them get
out of it. And, and that's
one of the reasons I was so
enthusiastic about carrying
this, this bill for the house
sponsors.
So  Mr.
President,
Mr.  President,
you mentioned difficult to
reach people.
How do, how do we find
the difficult to reach if they're difficult
to reach? How do we even let
them know that such a program
exists?
I apologize, Mister President. Could you
repeat the question? Thank you,
Senator Senator
Chair. Yes, Mister
President. So
a minute ago you talked
about this was for
the difficult to reach
people. Ok.
So
a what does that mean?
And b how do you reach people
that are difficult to reach? How do you even let
them know that this
program exists?
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Well,
part of this pilot is actually
reaching out to these
program to, to, to these
people and find them
in these hard to reach areas.
I remember growing up in Los Chavez
that was viewed as a hard to reach
area um
because it was rural.
Um But so the reaching out is
important. But remember a lot of
people who would be eligible for this program
have already, uh the
work has been done to find them.
There are about 700
New Mexicans enrolled in
25 programs run through
adult education.
Thank you, Senator Lopez
Senator. So
what were those
700
700 people in
25 programs? I'm sorry.
Was that, was
that what you said? Senator
Senator Cil Lopez
in current integrated
education training
programs, there are close
to 700 new Mexicans
enrolled in 25 programs
right now
and, and so they're not getting the
stipends. These, these 700
people are not currently getting the
stipend. This
will create
a program in which their
barriers to participation
will be removed.
Thank you, Senator Lopez,
Senator. Ok. So,
um  Mr.  President,
Senator,
so if we're trying to reach
more people, so
the the 700 then would
qualify for.
This
is the goal to get
801,500.
And, and then how do you, how do you
find them? So you can double the
number or if that's the
goal? Thank
you, Senator Senator
Lopez. Yes, it is
a goal to bring more people and
I believe these funds would
support about 100 more
people if
they
HED will des design
it and they'll determine the
criteria that they for,
for choosing the individuals.
So it probably be a mix of people who are
already enrolled and
reaching out for new people.
Um This is a small
pilot. So we, we
anticipate that about
100 people
will, will have the
benefit just like when you're in
college, some people get
scholarships, some people get
grants or whatever and
that's what will happen with
this program.  Mr.  President,
thank you, Senator Lopez.
So
Mr.  President,
if, if, if the goal is
to increase the number
and I think that's a worthy
goal,
but if 700
people are already in the
system and they
get the
money,
then we don't have any money for more
people. I
think that's my point.
So if we already have somebody
that's going to, that's going to use
all of the money,
then we don't have any room for growth,
we don't have anywhere to go.
Tha thank you for the,
for this pilot program
is going to be a mixed pre
Mr.  president of people
already enrolled and people
who are new to the program.
Thank you, Senator C Lopez.
Senator Share.
Ok. So
Mr.  President,
is this on, on some
kind of needs base? Uh
because as you pointed out, some
people have two jobs, they have childcare,
they have other other
issues,
but there's also
folks that are, you know,
over 18
that don't have a diploma
but might still be living
with their parents or
they don't have the same
financial requirement
as the single mom with two
jobs. She needs the financial
or the, the
finances, but
somebody else might not
on that level. Is there any
needs bases measure
in this Mister
President?
Yes,  Mr.
President.
So  Mr.  President, can you
describe how
we would measure those needs,
the needs based
stipend, I guess
Mr.  President HED
will determine um
the
criteria.
Ok. So  Mr.  President
the A Ed gets the
money, they'll figure out
who's a New Mexican. They'll
figure out what the needs
are. So they'll have a line
somewhere that says, OK, well,
um you
live at, at home,
you're 18, but you still live at home
versus single mother
with two jobs trying to
pay everybody, uh pay
all the bills.
So they'll take that into consideration
a, trying to define who a New Mexican
is. And then b
what the, what the income
level is for that
student. So, not
necessarily,
no,
I believe that students,
students are different.
So, so we just can't
say, OK, you
get, if you're making
$12,000 a year, $1000
a month, then
you're not OK
across the
board. If
you're making $40,000
a year, you're OK across
the board, but forty's
in Albuquerque, not that much
money. 40 is a lot in
most of the rest of the state.
Um So
somehow they'll, they'll
develop a formula to account
for that. So 40,000,
if you're a single mom
versus 40,000, if
you're uh
just
single
living, living in your parents'
house,
Mr.  President HED
will develop that criteria.
But the intent is for this to
go to low-income
people and,
um, specifically in
rural communities
and specifically for low
wage
workers.
Ok.
So,
and I, and I,
I am glad to hear
you said rural,
um,
because
I,
as I sit here and look at this
far, too much stuff
happens right down the Rio Grande
Quarter. Why? Well,
that's where a lot of people live
but the people that are living in the most
poverty, I believe
live outside the Rio Grande
Quarter now, certainly,
you know, you can go down
to Lee and County
and there are people living in trailers,
but they're living in trailers because,
well, there's no place
else for them to live, but they're
certainly not
impoverished.
Um
but in some of the other
parts of the state,
um you do, you
certainly don't have the economic
opportunities that you have
in Albuquerque or Santa
Fe.
So this, this would really
be focused at them and not
the people in
Albuquerque or Santa
Fe.
Thank you, Senator Chair,
Senator Cilla
Lopez. Yes,  Mr.  President,
I, I think that's a good
description.
So  Mr.  President, this
really comes to the,
to the meat of the
issue.
This is a
stipend.
Why is this not an
anti donation clause
issue? If we're just going
straight up hand people
cash? Why is
it not an anti
donation issue?
Thank you, Senator Chair
Senators Lopez.
President need based programs
are an exception to the anti donation
clause. Thank you,
Senator Lopez Center
Share. So
Mr.  President,
yes, the Snap
Program, uh,
the TF uh
program.
Um, but now we've put this
one in
the higher education
department. So we've taken
it out of
the, of the programs
that really are the
needs based program.
So,
so I think that we've, we've actually
made this more difficult,
more difficult to manage
for one thing because
of higher ed, this is just
not what they do, but
then also more difficult to
define
the needs based program
such as the the Snap
Program. And, and
I I look at this and it
says
develop and administer
an economic support program
to provide participants
with ongoing monetary
stipends to
enable the participants to
acquire training and skills
nece necessary
to obtain
employment.
So, but we
have the the
lottery scholarship, we have
the opportunity scholarship,
we have ways to fund this
today. We already have 700 people
in it. So there's
already a funding mechanism
that's not a stipend
directly to
the to the student.
You know, these are things that
help in a broader
sense, but this is a, a
relatively small
number of people
and and I am concerned
that this will be challenged
as, as
a anti donation
clause because we're
just, we're just handing them
cash that they can do
whatever it is
with the Snap
program.
Yes, you get money
but it's for food
and, and you have to qualify
based on income but
also how many mouths you're trying to
feed?
This is just cash that they
can do whatever they want with.
So how is it
not
anti donation
clause? Thank
you, Senator Senator
Cilia Lopez.
Thank you,  Mr.
President. They will, each
of these individuals will create
a program in consultation
with the relevant state agencies.
And um
it's abased program
which is an exception to the
anti donation clause.
Thank you, Senator
Lopez. So
mister President, can you show
me where, where it says
that it's an exception? Because I
certainly in this bill, I don't
see it but maybe somewhere else
in law qualifies. Thank
you,
Mister President.
Most, most
anti don
issues are not
addressed in state statute.
Thank you, Senator CIA Lopez. Senator
Share.
Mr.
President,
do we have,
I'm confused
now. I would
ask one of our attorneys,
but two of them are over there just,
you know, babbling away on
something. Do we have another
attorney in the room that would like to
help me figure out
where, where
in statute? It says that
this is an exception.
Thank you, Senator. If any one of the
attorneys in the room could, could
help me find that out.
Thank you, Senator. It seems like all
of our attorneys are tied up at the
moment.
Senator Share. Would you like
to yield to the bill, the
sponsor of the bill
for a
response?
Senator Share? All
right. Thank you,
Mr.  President apparently my
attorneys don't want to
client attorney
privilege. They wanted to tell
me why I was wrong without coming out
in public and telling
everybody why I was wrong. But
apparently in our
constitution, there is no
exception. But
we have made exceptions.
Apparently in other places
in statute,
which I'm assuming
if, if one of us
wanted to challenge we
could, that does seem a
bit means spirited
but, but
I guess we could challenge it because
our, our constitution
does not have that
exception.
Um
So Mister President, let me
go back to the, to
this part here. So this
is a three year
program. Let me go back here
where I find it a three
year program
that we will measure at the end
of it to see how
it worked. How are
we going to measure it? How do we know it
worked?
Miss Mister President? That's
the wonderful thing about he,
they will develop the outcomes
expected. And I assume that one
of the outcomes expected will be completion
of the program and achievement
of, of what,
what the goal was, graduation
and,
and credentials.
Thank you, Senator Lopez,
Senator Chair. So Mister
President, I've
taken mine to my car already,
but we've got these books
from
Legislative Finance
Committee that have
measures for various groups
and various agencies and so
forth. And as I
look at these, these measurement
things,
the,
the, the deal
that I see is too many of the
measures are how many
people are enrolled
or how many
whatever. But
it never talks in my mind
anyway
about outcomes.
And so we would need
outcomes
to be measured. And, and
so you, you believe that we would
set this up. So we would say, ok,
X number of people were
enrolled but
why actually completed
the program? Because to me that's the
measure. And then
how do we know that that's a decent
measure?
Thank you, Senator
Senator Lopez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
That is absolutely the
measure. That is how it is done
now. And that will absolutely be
the measure with this
program.
Thank you, Senator Lopez, Senator
Chair. So just to
clarify mister President, so
700 people are in,
in one of the 25
programs. They don't have
a diploma. They
may or may not be
English language learners,
but they're going to become
whatever's on this list here. That's
their goal. And
we're pretty sure they're New
Mexicans.
So we start out with the first
measure. We have 700
people,
but just because we get 800
doesn't mean that it was
successful, but of the
700
650
actually completed the
entire
program. And
now they're
plumbers.
I just want to make sure that we're going
to the end and say now they're plumbers,
but maybe even beyond that
to the next step, now
they're employed in
New Mexico.
So to me, that would be the outcome.
That's the ultimate outcome.
And, and so when
we say that it's
a,
to develop a monetary
stipend, uh,
aimed at increasing access
to living, living
wage jobs,
plumbers, by the way, make a lot
of money and they make a
lot of money because they go places
where most people
don't want to go. Unlike <Star
Trek>, they go down
instead of up.
But,
um,
but I would like to see the,
the matrix that
shows progress, not just how
many people are in it,
but how many people have the living
wage job
or better at the
end?
Absolutely,  Mr.
President, uh they have
data, they're gonna collect more
data and they would be delighted to
share that data with you.
Thank you, Senator Ciao Lopez.
Senator.
Ok. Thank you,  Mr.
President. So on here, we've
got
123456789,
1011, 12
categories
of, of
um approved
workforce training
programs.
Where did those 12
come from?  Mr.  President?
Thank you, Senator Senator
Cedillo
Lopez
to president that
um there was
consultation with
the um
with the E DD,
the Economic development
um department
and the Department of Workforce
Solutions and those were
identified as
areas in the state in
which there are unmet needs
for, for employees.
And um
that's how that list was
developed.
Thank you, Senator Theos.
And so mister President,
clearly, we
have an ever
growing need
for, for doctors
for primary care doctors
as well as specialty
doctors and
we have an ever growing need
for nurses
and physician assistants
and, and so that
level of medical
training,
I don't know because I don't hear
about it, the need for
other health care
workers. So
certainly,
maybe we need more
EMTS because we have
fewer cardiologists. I
don't, I don't know how that
exists.
But,
but I find the health care one
interesting because
most of the time
the primary care
doctor needs
somebody. It
doesn't necessarily have to be a nurse but
somebody to do the
vital signs when you walk in.
Ok. What's your, what's your blood
pressure? What's your
heart rate?
Oxygen level? Those kind of things
that they just do
and, and I don't believe that
they actually have to be
nurses. Do
people like that? Do they have?
Is there a certification
for that level of
health care worker?
Yes,  Mr.  President there
is.
And so that uh  Mr.
President that
certification
here would
then help the,
the
the doctor.
And I hate to use that because I
don't, but
the medical provider, there we
go. That's the word I'm looking for the
medical provider
just to, to
screen people as they
came into the, into
the office. Is
that the way that would, so they're not
nurses, they're not doctors,
but they're the screening
staff. Nurse's
assistant would be
an example of that and
other workers that
do the intake
phlebotomist,
medical assistance.
Yes, Mister Mister President
Emts and
health care. A lot of
these programs. There is a
ladder.
Um there is a ladder
um into
you know, you start as a nursing
assistant, maybe get your nursing
degree and then move up in
that way. But this is to
enter the very first
stage of that Mister President.
Thank you, Senator
Lopez, Mister President. There's
just some really fun words out there
that are in the
phlebotomist.
I know a phlebotomist is
the person that, that drains
your blood and sticks in a little
vial and things like that. But there's
also other cool words
like
moom, which is the thing that you
listen to your heart with.
And those
are, those are hard
enough for me to say.
Um, but they are cool
words. And
so the, the same thing
here with early childhood
education
currently in early
childhood, we've,
we've increased the
standards, uh, for
the teachers. So
they have to have an associate's
degree and working toward
a bachelor's degree,
uh, to be a teacher.
So
this early
child education
program would not be
an associate's degree. So
who would they work for? And what would
their, uh, actual job
be? Thank you,
Senator Senator Cio
Lopez.
Mis Mister President Home
Daycare Education
Aids. Um, are,
are some of the jobs that these
individuals could,
could
start with and
hopefully move up that, that
career
track
senator. So  Mr.
President, the home daycare, I thought
we were actually trying to move away
from, from that whole
concept. Um, I
mean, that used to be the, the common
way, you know, somebody in the
neighbourhood took the other four kids
in the neighbourhood and they all stayed at the neighbor's
house.
So
um the anyway, II, I
don't have to go into home daycare
much but,
but it did surprise me that that
was one of the things
mentioned.
Um I do see the
cybersecurity
um but I am surprised
that we need a program for that at all
because most
kids can sit
at this computer and
tap away and break
into anything.
Um
And so we need, we need
those kids to tell us
how to not break into
stuff.
And uh so I would think
the cybersecurity thing would be
relatively easy. But is there
also a, a specific
uh program
or
certificate that you get for
cybersecurity at that
level?
Yes, there are entry
level cybersecurity programs
and entry level it
programs.
Thank you, Senator Lopez.
Senator Lopez. I'm sorry.
And just, just to continue, it
is a large industry
with many, many
paths up the
ladder.
Thank you, Senator Lopez,
Senator Shariff. So
mister President, my attorney
finally gave me something. Here's kind
of a slow attorney.
Uh
So
aid, aid to private enterprise
is section 14
of uh uh
article nine, section
14, uh aid
to private enterprise, veterans
scholarship programs,
student loans, job
opportunities, affordable
housing. So
apparently there is something in our
constitution that addresses
these uh if we
go down. Uh section
14 B,
uh nothing in this section
prohibits the state
from establishing a veterans
scholarship
program
for Vietnam conflict
veterans,
but it doesn't talk about Desert
Storm or
whatever it was we did in
Iraq and Afghanistan
or whatever,
wherever else we may have
deployed soldiers because we currently
have soldiers in
Syria.
So,
so this is specific for
that. But then if you go
to, to um,
see,
um, it says
the state may establish
by law a program
of loans to students of
the healing arts.
So based
on the constitution, I
can see where we can do the health
care workers and the
first responders
and if they are veterans
of
Vietnam,
they can get a loan for all
of this.
So that's what our constitution
says. And I, I
would frankly
mister President, I was struck by the
idea that
nothing in this
section prohibits the state from
establishing a veterans
scholarship program
for Vietnam conflict
veterans
as opposed to
veterans that
seem obviously
that was written a long time ago.
But, but that seems
like something we might wanna,
might wanna change
here.
But since the constitution
says clearly
for health care,
um
for the healing
arts,
we come back to renewable
energy broadband
expansion, uh just,
just given a stipend for
those. And I think that
that would be something
that,
that we would want to review and
make sure that we, that we
weren't doing
something that was
going to eventually
be challenged in
court. So,
and I'm not going to challenge this in
court. But I just,
I, I look at those
and, but the stipend part that I
talked about before
just handing people
cash
and we hand them
cash
four
um
necessary to
obtain employment,
earn a living wage,
which I also don't know what that
is. And
in the process of acquiring
the training to prevent
income, housing
and food
insecurity.
Um The stipends provided
pursuant to this paragraph should
cover the cost associated
with basic living needs
including housing, food
transportation and the
cost associated with
enrolling in
and attending a workforce
training program.
So, Mister President, all of
that sounds
like a lot of money. But did
I understand Mister President that this
is $1000 stipend.
Did I get that right? Thank
you, Senator Senator
Lopez. Yes, Mister
President, it is $1000
a month, up to $1000
a month
maximum.
Thank you Senator Lopez.
Senator.
So mister
President
$1000 a month is
$12,000 a year.
And so when we're talking about earn
a living wage, well,
certainly in this case, they still
would have to have other sources of
income. They would have to have another
job or they would have to have
something, somebody else feeding
them, housing them,
clothing them so forth
because this says to prevent
income
housing and food
insecurity.
So for a lot
of people, $1000
does just fine. But again,
we go back to the single, single
mom who's already has
two jobs to try to pay her
rent, feed her kids
and things like that is
$1000.
While I'm
curious about actually
giving somebody cash is
$1000 enough,
Mister
President
Mr.  President. That
is a very good question. But
the intent of this is to
fill the gaps
to deal with the barriers
and uh we may have to
come back if it's not enough.
However, uh the
I they have experience with
this and
childcare seems to be
something that is a barrier.
Um, transportation
seems to be, be a barrier,
compu lack of access to
computers seem to be a barrier.
Um So if those, if
they can address those barriers,
that alone will help them
continue.
So  Mr.  President, you,
you brought up childcare,
do we have a program to
help with
childcare
today
for anybody? Not just the
700. Thank you,
Senator Senator
Lopez. Yes,  Mr.  President,
we have a robust program
to help New Mexicans with child
care. The problem
is in, in these
cases, some
the most daycares are
during the day. And so
if you're going at
night
to school, you might need
to hire a, a
babysitter. And
so that's a little bit different from,
you know, not available through
the many robust and wonderful
programs we have in the
state.
Thank you, Senator Lopez,
Senator. So
Mr.  President,
I'm still
not comfortable with the idea of
the anti donation clause. I
do believe that we have
programs like
snap that help. We have, we
have daycare programs that
help. There's lots of other things
out there that I think could help somebody
get through this. I'm
not opposed to the idea of taking
somebody from
no diploma
to a plumber who then
makes lots of
money. So with that
mister President,
she would very much appreciate
it if I stopped asking her
questions. And so I will abide
by that. Thank you, Senator
Chair for the robust debate.
Seeing no further debate,
Senator Lopez
to close on the bill.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I move
that house

19 minutes, here's,
here's what we're gonna do two
additional items. Uh
item number four. That'll be
Senator Lopez
and then we're gonna go to Concurrence
calendar. Number
one. No, supplemental
calendar number three, excuse me,
supplemental calendar number three.
Senator Birch.
Uh and then at
exactly 1155
we'll yield back to Senator
Campos. Uh We
also do have a concurrence

that right now with Senator Munoz.
So I'm gonna go to Concurrence
next, uh and then

Lopez. Do you have an announcement?
Yes,  Mr.  President
Christina Bara has
been recently appointed
to the House and this is her
first bill in the Senate. So
please join me in uh
in uh welcoming
her and Linda Serrato.
I remember I interview
introduced your first bill
in the Senate. So please
join me in, in welcoming
them and celebrating their success.
Congratulations.
Representative
Senator Wirth, thank
you,  Mr.  President Unanimous Consent.
We go out of business. Concurrence
and I yield to Senator Munoz for
concurrence calendar number
six. See no
objection on that order. Business
Concurrence. And now you have to Senator
Munoz. Thank you,  Mr.
President. I move the Senate concur
with the House amendments
for Senate Bill 239 as
amended. Thank you, Senator Munoz. If
you'll explain what those amendments
are,  Mr.  President, it
extends a number of hours. You can
go. We had a problem in our
opportunity in our lottery.
So if a kid wanted
to go during summer school
and that wasn't available
for lottery or
opportunity, if a
kid had over the amount of
credits uh
and
still couldn't go,
he was ineligible for
opportunity and lottery. But this,
this, this amendment
just
puts in rule that the
department will decide three
or nine credit hours for the summer
and summer semesters and the department
will make the rule with that question,
Mister President, I'll stand for a
question.
Thank you, Senators.
We're debating the house. This
concurrence to the house
amendments
see no
debate,
Senator Munoz to close.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I move with the Senate
concur
by a voice
vote.
Thank you. Thank you Senators.
There's been a motion for the Senate
to concur with, with
house amendments to Senate Bill
239 as
amended. All those in favour signify
by saying I those
opposed
nay,
we almost had a ruling of
the chair but
the eyes have it. The Senate
has concurred with house amendments to
Senate bill 239 as
amended.
Thank you, Senator Senator Wirth.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Unanimous consent. We go back to
that order. Business third reading of
legislation. I yield
first to Senator Lopez for
item number four and
then to Senator Burtt for item
number one on supplemental calendar.
Number three. Thank you, Senator
Wirth, Senator Lopez. Thank
you very much,  Mr.  President. I
ask unanimous consent of the
Senate that the records show that all
action for placing
Senate Memorial five
on final passage has been
taken and it is now subject
to debate, amendment or substitution.
There are no objections, Senator
Lopez, if you thank you
very much,  Mr.  President, what
Senate memorial
is proposing is
to create a task
force that
will be identified by
legislative leadership, the governor

Senate Floor Amendment
number one to Senate Memorial
five amendment

Linda M Lopez.
Senator Lopez to move and
the amendment. Thank you very
much, Mister President, I
move Senate floor amendment number
one to Senate Memorial
five. And what
this is  Mr.  President is
essentially adding one
more member who would
be a tribal member with lived
experience of the effects
um of the Federal
Indian Child Welfare
Act as well as the Indian Family
Protection Act
or other similar provisions
of the children's code.  Mr.  President

Thank you, Senator Lopez Senators. We're

See no debate, Senator
Lopez to close on the amendment.
Mr.  President, I now move
Senate floor amendment number one
to Senate Memorial five and I ask
for a voice vote. Thank you, Senator.
There's been a request
to adopt Senate floor amendment. Number
one is Senate Memorial five. All
those in favour signify by saying
aye, those opposed
A the Ayes have
it Senate
Memorial five has been amended.
We are back on the
memorial.
See no debate on the memorial,
Senator Lopez to
close. Thank you very
much,  Mr.  President. I
now move that Senate Memorial
five as amended
do now pass and I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records
show that the role has been called
and all those present voted, the
affirmative, accept those voting in
the negative by a show of hands. Thank you,
Senator Lopez Senators. We're voting all
senators to your seats if you wish to
vote. No, please raise
your
hand
by a vote of 41
of the affirmatives are on the negative. Senator
Memorial five as amended
has passed the senate. Senator
Lopez. Thank you,  Mr.  President,
members of the Senate. Thank you all you
to Senate majority floor leader Peter.
We to take us to the next order of business.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Next
up, Senator Burt for item number one
and supplemental calendar number
three. Thank you,
Senator Wirth, Senator
Burt. Thank you,
Mr.  President. I ask
unanimous consent of the
Senate that the record showed
that all action for placing
house rural development, land
grants and cultural affairs committee
substitute for House Bill
251
on final passage has
been taken and that is now subject
to debate amendment or
substitution. See no
objections. Senator Burt to
explain. Thank you,
Mr.  President. Um
We talked a little bit in
committee about this
about landmark
legislation and we ked
a little bit about it because it's a
license plate bill
But honestly, ladies
and gentlemen of the Senate, this will
change the way that we do
li specialty license
plates. Probably for the
future. Number
one, it will have a generic
plate with a
sticker on it
to indicate uh what
the specialty is.
Number two, there will be a
fee of $50.10
dollars of that will go to the cost
of the plate $40
to uh
the
uh uh
let me see, the energy
minerals and natural
resources for forest
fire protection.
And then it will
have a $40 renewal
fee on an annual
basis. And that money to all
of that will go to the
Energy Minerals and Natural
Resources Department for
forest fire prevention
uh does have a sunset clause
on it as well, which I
think is an interesting thing.
Uh When we get to
September 1st of
2027
we will look back at
the numbers that were sold
in 25 and 26
we'll average those out.
And if the numbers in
27 do not
uh reach
50% of that average
sale, then we will no
longer offer
the uh Smokey Bear
license plate.
The final thing I will tell you, we want
to do this because Smokey Bear is
celebrating his 80th
anniversary this
year. Uh He has
been a, a
tip of the spear
for uh fire prevention
in the forest as well as
uh uh supporting
and helping animals of the
forest. And we would
certainly ask your
support to get this plate
done. And
with that said, Mister
President, I'm
open for debate or
questions. Thank you, Senator by,
I see that there's going to be lengthy debate
on this. I'll yield to Senator Bill
first. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I just wanted to offer an amendment,
Senator Griggs and Moores and
Pirtle and I want to have a
retired legislator
plate. Could we have
that Mister President? Is, would that be a
friendly amendment? Uh I
don't know for this particular
bill, but we can put a
sticker together. You guys have
all four faces on there
and we'll run that next year.
Very good. I'll
hold you to it. Thank you. Thank you, Senator
Burt. We do have further debate.
Senator
Pirtle,
shall the previous
question be?
Now put
senators, there's been a request
for the previous
question.
All those in favour signify
by saying I
those opposed nay,
see no objection
Senator Burke to close on the
bill.  Mr.
President, I move
that the Senate or excuse
me, that house rural development,
land grants and Cultural
Affairs Committee

Do now pass. And I ask that the
unanimous concern the Senate that
the record show that all role
that the role has been called
and all those president voted
in the affirmative except
those voting in the negative by
show of hands. Senators. We
are voting all senators to your
seats. If you wish
to vote. No, please raise
your
hand.
My
Yeah, for
that
by a vote of 41. The affirmative
zero on the negative house
rural development, land grants and
Cultural Affairs Committee substitute for
House Bill. 251
has passed the Senate Senator
Burke,
Senator Tip Pino to
explain your vote. Thank you,  Mr.
President. I can't believe
that the culmination of my
legislative career
will be the final vote
being a license plate
bill. If we had
just done this 10 years ago,
we could have saved months
of legislative time. Thank
you, Senator Burt. Thank you,
Senator Senator
Burr Senator, on behalf
of Lincoln County, smokey bear
and uh myself

Baca,
Senator

Thank you,  Mr.  President. Uh
Thank you for all
of you for all your hard
work. And this
session we had a a
really, I
will say a cooperatives
session. I want to thank the majority
leader um for his
work and his work with
me and managing this
session. Um Looking
forward into the next
year,  Mr.
President, there can
be improvements we can
improve. Um I think
we need to move forward in a more
bipartisan manner.
Um I invite my colleagues
on the other side to
seek leadership of this
senate that involves
everybody
where we're not going
and we're not seeking to
be corrected by the House
as we were this
year,
we want to work with you.
We wanna be
a bipartisan group
and move the state forward with
you. I invite
you to join
us to
seek that sort of
leadership. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator BCA, Senator
Stewart.
Uh Thank you,  Mr.  President.
I just want to acknowledge
how hard it is to do everything
we just did in a 30 day
session.
Um We work
to compromise where we
can. Uh No,
we can't always come
together. I've seen lots
of collaboration in
committees and on the
floor. I want to
thank personally,
Senator Baca and
Senator Wirth for what they
do on the floor uh to
make this work
so much better. We've certainly,
I had some interesting and
creative ways to collaborate
the vote
for my amendment or I'll talk for an
hour. Didn't quite
work. We
look forward to more
collaboration. I'm looking
forward to planning my garden. I hope
everybody finds a way to
find joy. I
also want to recognize the
senators who are leaving.
We are a family and
it hurts when
people leave Ron
Riggs, Brenda mckenna,
Mark Moore, Steven
Neville Jerry,
or Tip Pino Cliff,
Purtle, Gregg,
Mercedes,
Bill Tollman,
and Stuart Ingle and Gay
Kernan. So we will miss
them. We're gonna have a different
Senate next year. I look
forward to it. Thank you, everyone.
Thank you, Senator
Stewart.
Can I ask unanimous consent to the
body that I may be allowed to
share a few words?
See, no objection.
I first of all, I want to thank my
staff who is taking
care of us making sure that we need
all that is done within
the floor in preparation for each
session. So I want to thank my
staff. I want to thank our Senate
chief clerk and all of her
staff for the amazing
work that they do to ensure that
it does run efficiently
and the flow continues to move.
So thank you so much. Uh
Sherry, thank you to your whole
staff, our
sergeant at arms and all
of our attendings,
your kindness, your
service does not
go unnoticed. And we're so grateful
for every one of you that take
time away from your lives for 30
days to be here to
assist us so that we may
be able to be here on the
floor to work
for New Mexicans. You know,
at the beginning of this session, we talked
about generational impact
and what it was done
to get us to that point.
And even though that there's always more that we
can do as Senator Baca has
shared, I also think
that together we did some
impactful things
together. We ensured that
rural hospitals and all hospitals
across the state are
gonna be taken care of.
Together. We work
to make sure that our roads are gonna be
maintained and safe
for people who travel all
across together.
We have the opportunity to make
sure that our educators
are state employees,
our state police,
we prioritized
and recognizing the service that they
provide and when we
look and see what it is that
we've done,
we also took some time to
pay tribute rightly.
So to the senators
who have been in our chamber
who have chosen to
retire.
And even though that this body is gonna
look different next year in many
ways,
never forget
that the impact and significance
that your service provided here in
the State Senate
has had a positive impact, not
only in this chamber
but across the state
in New Mexico. And I
just want to close by saying
how grateful that I am to
be able to sit in this
chair and to preside
and to know what bills that we're gonna
be hearing and to have
communication.
And I want to specifically say
thank you to Senator Peter
Worth and Senator
Greg Baca, because
many of you may not know some of the
discussions that go behind the scenes,
some of the discussions that go to make sure
that this chamber
is able to run
efficiently and
do the work that needs to be done.
And I want to acknowledge those
too because without
them coming together, finding ways
to have negotiations, finding ways
to make sure that we can
uh improve the
state, it
wouldn't happen.
So leadership does
matter. And I'm
grateful that I'm able to be in a room
full of leaders. We're
here today.
May God bless you all?
Keep you safe
and look forward to seeing you throughout the
interim. Thank you
so
much,
Senator Pete
Campos.
Thank you very much, Mister President
members of the Senate.
As you all know, these Milagro
Awards go to individuals
who throughout the
session
work to overcome so
much in their own
personal lives. And of course
here in the Senate
chamber.
So with this, here we
go.
This gentle giant
cowboy
has a folksy approach to
the most difficult complex
issues and
always has a way of getting
his point across.
Sometimes it may take
an hour, but he
efficiently and
effectively gets it
done.
He cares about his
constituents,
likes to stop at cafes
and share a cup of coffee
and a piece of homemade pie with
locals.
He often gets a pie to go
and brings it to the staff of the New
Mexico State Senate
in deep appreciation of their
hard work and service to our
state
Senator Pat
Woods.
His goal in serving
his district is to bring the
rural issues to the forefront
of public discussion.
These discussions assist
him in making the decisions
that are right for his
constituents.
Therefore, he is making
his community
proud.
New Mexico State. Senator
Pat Woods
is the epitome of a down
to earth legislator
with a sharp mind,
always asking the
questions, but
already knowing the
answers,
his statesmanlike qualities
have earned him the respect of
all those who enter
the New Mexico State
Capitol.
Senator Patrick Woods,
please.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you for the, for
the opportunity.
Uh
You
know,
everybody in here knows, I
don't know nothing about
nothing.
It's, it's a great
opportunity to
learn.
I came in here
thinking that
all I had to do
was speak
up and everybody
would
listen
and vote with me, but that
didn't work that
way.
So I,
I appreciate
this honour. Thank you
very much. Thank you
members of the
Senate.
This
I think you all know where we're going
with this?
Any ideas?
Didn't, didn't you all
have a cheerleader in here throughout
the
session?
The University of New
Mexico cheerleader
approaches the responsibilities
of the legislature with a can
do enthusiasm
from leading the Senate members
during confirmations
to being the master of
selfies.
Senator Leo Jaramillo
is a passionate public
servant.
Senator Jaramillo brings
a fresh and vibrant attitude
to the roundhouse
and works to ensure the
legislative process meets
the needs of all New
Mexicans,
especially the most
vulnerable,
a true Norteno
and a native son of the Espanola
Valley. He is
dedicated to his community
and his family.
He is a loving son to
his mother, a
loyal friend and a gracious
colleague. He
shows compassion to everyone.
He meets
Senator Leo Jaramillo
is the epitome of a class
act and is
an honourable member
of the New Mexico
Senate.
He serves with integrity and
kindness
and always puts his
constituents
first.
Senator Leo
Jaramillo.
Thank you so much, Senator
Campos. Thank you. I think
all of you just made it as
members of the cheer team
with me. So I thank you. But
there's one thing I pray
every morning before I come
here and it's that the Holy
Spirit shine with
me through me and around
me that my kindness
would mean the glory of God,
that people would see what kindness
is to be able to
represent. The beautiful Espanola
Valley has been the honour
of a lifetime where we're
brown. We're down and we're
low to the ground.
But the truth is, is Senator
Sedillo Lopez told me the other day,
Leo, I thought I was your favourite.
But the truth is all of you
have something about
you that makes you all of my
favourite. And so thank
you for this honour. To be a
Milagro is amazing. And I
know my brother that I lost
just a few months ago
would sit in that gallery and
give me the thumbs up every
day. Wasn't here this
time but was here in spirit.
And I know right now I'm getting a thumbs
up from up there.
And so this Milagro
word is not just for me. I'm
taking it home to
Espanola. Thank
you,
Sergeant at
Arms.
Mr.  President.
