You have West Matory.
>> Oh, Eric was asleep. I
needed to wake him up slowly
because if I hit, hit the gavel,
he'd have just jumped out of the Chair and said,
what happened
>> all the
time?
The, yeah,
not too much range
and a lot of this.
>> All right, Eric, you want to get us
started?
>> All right, Mr. Chair, Members of the
Committee.
Uh, it's so we're going
to be behind Tab D and your
binders. It looks like this.
It's a powerpoint
presentation
with that Mr. Chair.
Um, I
apologize. I guess I didn't draw
too much of a crowd
today
looking behind me. But
anyway, we'll mov'e on.
Um, I just wanted to kind
of talk a little bit
about, uh, why
I'm presenting today.
Uh going into the special
Session. I was kind of asked to kind
of give us a
little bit of a inventory.
Um, before we go
into the special Session of
kind of where we at as
far as Behavioral health Services
goes.
Um, and then talk a
little bit about,
uh
where we could
poten potentially head
based on some of the
recommendations and
reports from
the LFC that we've done
uh over the past few
years. And so I'm
gonna start off just going through
the kind of some of the
basics, some of the background
and then we'll jump into some of those
recommendations here in a
minute.
So starting on
slide three,
uh
I just wanted to kind of
mention
enrollment uh
in Medicaid. Medicaid
is our biggest payer uh
of behavioral health
services in the State by
far. Um
And right now,
or actually in April, we are at,
we are at about
879,000
and then, um
I'm sorry, 878,000.
And that's basically flat
uh to the prior period in
February. And so we're, we're
not moving too much. Um
As far as
enrollment
goes,
moving on to slide
four, this
is the Medicaid
projection. It just kind of gives us some
of the background
on
spending
in Medicaid over
the past. Uh
I don't know, decade or so.
A little over a
decade. Medicaid
enrollment revenue and
expenditure is approximately
42% of New Mexico
of New Mexico's
population is covered by
Medicaid.
Um And I just wanted to note
there on the fy
24.
Um If you look
there on the right hand side, you'll
see that
enrollment has
dipped quite a bit in
Medicaid down to about
879,000.
That's because of the
um at the
end of the public
health emergency, a
lot of people were
disenrolled
and that's where we're at right
now.
Uh Moving on to slide
five,
I just wanted to mention the Behavioral
Health Collaborative uh
and what they do
in 2004, the legislature
created the interagency behavioral
Health purchasing collaborative
to develop and coordinate
a single statewide behavioral
health system managed by
a CEO. And that's
actually currently vacant and
that's been vacant since
last summer.
Uh The 17
collaborative agencies house
programs with services
contracted through a single
entity with
190 million
contracted out in Fy
25 and
another 830 million
is, is in Medicaid, behavioral
Health.
So their responsibilities
are needs and gaps analysis,
contracting for delivery of
services and
developing a master plan.
I just wanted to mention that
the collaborative hasn't met
since at least
I, I think it's last September
or October and they're supposed to meet on
a quarterly basis. So
um that's something we're kind
of looking
for and hoping that they'll, they'll
get that up and running again
soon.
This next slide
on slide six,
on the left hand side,
you'll see all the,
the HC
A or health care Authority
programs that have to do
with behavioral health.
And then on the right hand side, you'll
see all the other collaborative
agencies kind of
built into that, that
table there.
Uh Collaborative agencies
are budgeted to spend
nearly 1.1
billion in Fy
25 and
that's a 25%
increase since fy
22.
Uh And so, for the last
few years, the legislative
um kind of
focus in behavioral
health has been
on workforce development,
capacity building
and rate
competitiveness.
Uh If you look at
the pie chart there on the
left, you'll see the Medicaid
Behavioral health
and then the Medicaid Behavioral
Health uh managed care
expansion population.
That's a total of about
$831
million.
And over the last
two years, each
year, we've done
7.1 million in
general fund rate
increases, which
when that's matched with
uh federal
Medicaid revenue,
that's 31.8
million each year. So about
62 $63
million that we've done each
year.
Um On the
right hand side,
you'll see the, the bar
chart there
and I just wanted to quickly go
over this. This is the
non uh
health care
authority spending
within the collaborative and
you'll have the administrative
office of the courts.
They have their treatment
courts um
within Children, youth and families.
This is the children's mental health
uh primarily
um
within the
Department of Finance and
Administration. They have the
DW I Prevention
um and treatment.
And then at
the Department of Health,
um they primarily have the
doh facilities
including rehab.
I just wanted to mention on that one,
specifically
Turquoise Lodge Hospital
uh in Albuquerque.
And then the New Mexico
Rehabilitation Center
um Turquoise Lodge had
a capac or a
um
had 41% of
their bid be of capacity
filled while
NMRC had about
23% of their
capacity filled
um back in
May. Uh I don't
have a more recent one than that,
but that's we're not
using all of our capacity. And
I kind of wanted to just mention that
here.
Um In early childhood,
we've, we have home visiting
in higher education, we have student
loan repayment
and in the Corrections Department, we
have Reentry and
uh Inmate Behavioral
Health
Services.
This next slide slide
seven
uh Medicaid behavioral
health, recurring spending
growth. And
it's just to show you
that uh over
the last few years
since fy 22
we've increased spending
in Medicaid behavioral health by
25% and they've
gotten a that's a pretty significant
increase there.
Uh Slide
eight
Medicaid behavioral
health spending.
You'll see this pie chart here,
managed care, behavioral health
expenditures uh
in 2023
uh totaled about
836 million.
About half of that was
outpatient services.
And you can see in this uh
table on the right hand
side there, you can see how that
kind of breaks out the outpatient
services. So,
evaluations and therapies,
applied behavioral analysis,
federally qualified health
centers.
Um and then some of the
inpatient services
um included
uh
residential
um hospital
inpatient facility
um and some other smaller
pieces
there.
So now to the
nonrecurring
that these agencies
have collaborative
agencies received about
407 million
in nonrecurring behavioral health
funding between Fy 23
and Fy 25.
You'll see in that,
um
that column chart there
at the, on the left hand
side, you'll see for
capacity building,
they've gotten a little over 200
million um to
build capacity
and they've just started to grant
some of that out uh between
Fy 23 and Fy
24.
Um they
received a little bit for treatment
and then uh for
workforce
higher ed institutions
have received funding for
um primarily
for workforce
and, or for higher ed
endowments
at the
institutions.
Um in Fy 25
that's the pie chart on the right
nonrecurring behavioral health
appropriations.
Um So they've, they've also
received a pretty big chunk
of funding for this
year which included
capacity building treatment
and workforce
development.
I just wanted to mention that there's
the table there that says,
uh Fy 23 through
25 nonrecurring
includes um
behavioral health providers
start up costs.
That's that 20 million
that went to
CYFD
and the health Care
Authority uh for
capacity building.
Um for more behavioral
health services that
money was appropriated
two years ago and
almost none of it has,
has really moved so
far.
Uh Moving on to slide 10,
it's a little bit of a gear
change. I'm gonna stop talking about
the numbers more and
get in a little more into
what are the needs and gaps
uh within the
system.
New Mexico ranks poorly and
keep behavioral health
metrics. The number
of behavioral health providers
is slowly growing. That's kind
of the good news we are seeing,
um, like the Medicaid
Network, it is starting to
grow a little bit more than it had
been. Um,
but we still do
rank pretty
poorly on a lot of these
kind of key behavioral health
metrics. Um
We are improving
um slowly but
surely, but we're still, you
know, especially for the
youth behavioral
health metrics. Uh,
we're still pretty close to the
bottom. And so,
you know, that's definitely an area
that we need to look at
more
um on behavioral
health needs. On
slide 11,
um fall 2023
LFC Medicaid Accountability
Accountability Report
found that utilization in a
few key areas of physical and
behavioral health have decreased
since 2019.
Um without better access
measures, utilization can be
used to approximate whether
Medicaid Members are
accessing the services
the State is paying for.
However, because
utilization
metric met uh
metrics, the health
care authority tracks
or units of service,
the State does not know if more
or fewer, fewer clients
are receiving services. And so that's
kind of the issue as
far as um we have a lot
of kind of unknowns within the
system. Are there,
you know, a few super users
that are using the
services quite a bit
or is it widespread or
people all over the State
using these services? And so that's,
that's kind of a
um something that
we're trying to work on with the department
to get a better understanding
of
um
this next slide slide
12, however, continue
provider shortages. And a
there's, there's continues to be
provider shortages and
access challenges.
You can just see there.
Um the map
on the left, it just has
those kind of inkblots there.
It kind of just gives us an idea of how
many um
prescribing providers there
are in, in the
State. And then on that right
hand, one, there's the
number of um
latex or licensed
alcohol and drug abuse
counselors out there.
Um And those are kind of an important
group to look at when it comes
to behavioral health because they
assess and diagnose
these
issues.
They do treatment planning,
counseling, crisis
intervention,
um, and a lot
of other services.
Um, and
there's, you'll see on there, there's several
counties without any Late
Act and
there's also other counties
where you might think
that there should be more because
of the size of the population
where there's actually not
too many
there.
Moving on to slide.
13. I
know I'm throwing a lot of data at
you. Um
This is just kind of showing
that we're getting
to,
we are improving our
network. Um,
our networks within Medicaid,
we are increasing providers
out there.
Um,
but
one issue with that,
that I wanted to kind of bring to your
attention is that
most of the providers that
we've added within
Medicaid's network over
the past year or
two was
uh within Western Sky.
That's the managed care
organization
that, um, is
not going to, is not
continuing, uh,
through the new
managed care system of
turquoise care.
Um, and so they're one
of the ones that dropped out. We've built
this, they kind of built up this
network. It's been doing a lot
better, but now we're losing them.
So that's one thing
that we're gonna be keeping an eye on
in the next, uh,
you know, few months or
so is how are, how
do those uh networks
get, get built
as we bring on the, the
new MC Os
of
um United and
Melina.
Uh This next one is
just to kind of give us
uh kind of a shot of
utilization.
This is per 1000
member months. So
basically just per
Members. Uh
there's been less
utilization in these
areas, you know, including
residential treatment center
treatment, foster care,
inpatient hospital days and
that sort of thing.
Um
These are not necessarily
bad that these,
that we're seeing these decreases
in utilization.
Um But
this is another unknown that
we kind of have is, are
these folks, if they're
not getting treatment in a
residential treatment center,
are they getting
treatment elsewhere? You know, are
they getting, if,
if say it's a
um drug abuse issue,
are they going to get Suboxone,
which doesn't require you to
go into
a um facility
to get care, that sort of
thing,
moving on to slide. 15
real fast. This
is a, gives us
an idea of
some of the services
that our Medicaid
program provides through
behavioral health.
Um, the department,
we ask departments,
we pick LFC
staff picks, I don't know, it's
five or six,
programs within the
State to do
a, um, program
inventory.
And at, we asked
them to tell us how many
of their programs are
evidence-based,
um,
or, you know, promising or
whatever research
based. And you'll
see here that a lot of the
programs in
Medicaid, we
don't have them classified
at this time. Like they,
in a lot of ways, they don't
have a great understanding
of whether or not they're
effective
or whether or not
they're actually um
helping to reduce some of
the um,
problems that we see out there
with behavioral health.
So I
do want to mention though the
1.2 billion
there in
unclassified,
um, it,
it has to be licensed,
it has to be certified and it has to
be medically necessary
for people to receive those
services. So there
is that kind of counterpoint
and on one side, we don't
know a lot
about how effective this stuff is.
But on the other side, it is
considered to be medically
necessary if, if the Mc
Os are paying for
it,
uh moving on
to slide 16,
just pointing out
another, another
one, you know,
when it comes to treatment
courts, uh
the legislature has
increased funding
over the past few years by
42% for
treatment courts across the
State.
Um These are like your
mental health courts and your drug
courts and your DW I
courts.
Um,
funding has increased
42% but capacity
is decreased and
usage has
remained, you
know, basically flat or decreased
over the past few years, depending
on, on how you look at
it.
So I'm gonna change gears a little
bit here and I'm going to talk
about um some of the
prior LFC
research
and evaluations
that we've done some of the
recommendations that we've
made.
And so this one on
slide 17 is
about the prison revolving
door.
NM CD does not consistently
use a validated
risk assessment tool for
appropriate inmate security
risk classification.
A recent
validation study
uh from the University of New
Mexico found the
department
excuse me overrides
its assessments 45
45% of the
time
NM CD does not use
needs assessments to reduce
the risk of recidivism
when we're releasing
prisons into prisoners
into the community.
One third of new prison admissions
are for technical parole
violations with most related
to substance use
disorder.
Uh State laws, State
law allows for high
caseloads and there's no
treatment requirement for intensive
parolee supervision.
Uh intensive supervision is
only effective when caseloads
are manageable
and offenders receive
services.
Other states allow
Medicaid coverage for
incarcerated individuals 90
days prior to
release.
And so what are some of the
options to deal with some of
these issues that I was just talking about?
So if you look on slide
18, you'll see
some of the recommendations that we've
made. So requiring
NM CD to use
validated risk assessment
on all those prisoners.
Like I said, on the last slide,
they don't, you
know, 45 or whatever
percent. Um
they, you know, they don't use those
assessments on 45% of
the inmates
we should start uh
trying to wrap that up
and require that on more
inmates.
Uh require NM
CD to use needs assessments
on all inmates prior to
release to determine needs and
reduce incar
reincarceration.
Require the
corrections department to seek
alternatives to reincarceration
before revoking parole
for substance use
violation,
set caseload standards
for intensive supervision
and require services such as
behavioral health
uh treatment
and then seek a Medicaid
State plan amendment to allow
for Medicaid coverage 90
days prior to release
of incarcerated
individuals. And
so this last one here, I
actually got um
an update on Friday. I didn't
get to put it in here. But
um they have
sought uh a
new actually
an all, all new Medicaid
waiver for
um justice involved
individuals.
They say that they think it's going
to be approved
in July,
but that only allows
for services to begin
60 days prior.
But they said that they can look
into
um
providing that 90 days
prior to the
um
to release from
prison
on slide, 19
issues identified in prior
LFC evaluations and
research uh
limited access to care
in high need
communities.
So success. So these are some of
the um
issues that we've identified
successful treatment of
substance use disorder
often requires screening
assessment, detoxification,
outpatient and inpatient
treatment, medication assisted
treatment and
so on. Uh
pharmacies often limit
the types of medication assisted
treatment, drugs
available in areas with high
rates of opioid use
disorder.
And currently providers
must become credentialed
for providers
through each managed care
organization separately
before seeking reimbursement
from the uh managed
care
organization.
So what are some of the options
um
uh to improve access
to care in these high need
communities
require Medicaid funded
certified community behavioral health
clinics in high need
communities. I'll
remind you also that we
did the 15 million
um and grow funding for
certified community behavioral
health clinics. And
then the department also
recently received uh
SAS A grants to
step up these um
certified community health
CCBH
CS
uh authorize the pharmacy
board and doh to
require pharmacies in high
need locations to
make available Medicaid assisted
treatment
and then require Medicaid to
implement single credentialing
through the need
uh
single credentialing to reduce
the need to work with multiple M
CS to become
reimbursable within their
networks. So
single credentialing is kind of an
important thing. Um
so that
if you're a provider, if
you want to provide
services for all
four MC
OS, you have
to um enter
into an agreement with
all four of those MC
Os single
credentialing would allow us to
just go to the
depart, would allow providers to
just go to the department and get credentials
there. And then
um it's, it
would reduce a lot of the
uh
bureaucratic um
kind of work that providers have
to do to get um
in and one
issue with that right now is
that it's kind of dependent on
that miser system that's
getting,
um,
their, it system that's
coming up and running
and, you know, that's gone through a lot
of delays over the
years. Um And
so we're hoping that will be
kind of come online
in the next, uh a
little while.
My last uh
update I got on that
is that we would have that by
October. Um, I
haven't heard anything since then though. It's
been a few
months
uh slide
21
ensure public safety prior
to adjudication. So this is
kind of related
to the court. So standards for
pretrial services are not in
statute.
Pretrial risk tools do
not have statutory guardrails
about validation, real
evaluation
or use in decision
making.
Pretrial services lack
needs assessments. There is no
standard approach for who requires
24 hour ankle
monitors.
There's little statutory basis
for pretrial metrics and
performance data or
how criminal justice coordinating
counsel should use performance
measures.
So, on slide 22
what are some of the options to deal
with those issues?
Uh Outline minimum
standards for pretrial
services
require periodic
validation of risk
assessments.
Um and implement needs
assessments for services
require rules for
when
uh for when and for whom
to mandate 24 hour
live monitoring,
pre uh pre
release via ankle
monitors and
require reporting and use
pretrial performance data to
improve safety and report
findings on public facing
dashboards
and last
slide
um
slide 23
just a few issues. I wanted to kind
of leave you with lack of community-based
treatment options. Continues to
be an issue for
both adults and
Children.
There continues to be a significant
unspent balances of
nonrecurring
appropriations.
Um and we would like to see that
kind of sped up and,
and uh worked through the
system.
And then, uh as I
said earlier, those doh
substance abuse
um
facilities,
they remain, they remain kind
of underutilized. They're not,
um, you
know, using all of their
capacity
with that, Mr. Chairman, I'll
go ahead and pass it off
for questions.
>> So, on a
10,000
ft overview of
this, from the time
of the last administration to
this administration,
where do you think we've done with
mental health? Have we gained
any,
>> uh, Mr. Chair? I, I
do think over the past
maybe two years, three years,
I, you know, um
looking at the data, we've
added providers um
into the system,
we've added not
a lot. Uh,
there's
plenty more to
do. Um,
I do think that the legislature,
Mr. Chair has
done quite a
bit over
the past few years, especially
when you look at those nonrecurring
dollars that have gone out
there.
Um
Yeah. >> What is quite a
lot?
>> Well, 100 what
was it? 140
million don't quote
me and providers.
Oh,
well, Mr. Chair on Slide
13,
you'll see the,
uh,
you know, over the past few years
you have the, each year percentage
change increase
there of providers. So
for example, in a
metro
county,
um
in a population of
250,000 to 1
million,
you'll see that between
2021
and 2023
we increased
providers by
10%
uh within the
Medicaid
MC O network.
But like I said, that has a caveat,
big caveat, right?
That was Western
Sky's network
primarily that got
expanded
>> question from Committee
Members
represented. Oh, she's got
a list. Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and,
and thank you Eric for the
presentation.
Um There's so
many,
you know, we all know it's kind of a
big carry monster.
Um
uh The Gentleman
before had talked about this
90 days prior to release
incarcerated
Vic, Vic to
make sure that the transition
is good. Um I'm
all for that, but my,
one of my questions is who
pays for the
uh
for someone that's incarcerated?
Now, is it the county
where they're incarcerated or
who pays for that? Now,
>> Mr. Chair Members
of the Committee right now,
it's um I believe we're
doing 30 day
um prior
to release. But
if it's, if it's prior to
that, then it, yeah, it's the county
or it's the, the
prison system that does
it.
>> Exactly.
So my my
whole thing is even if you're
incarcerated, shouldn't mean
if you've already, if you already have
Medicaid, why would you
lose your Medicaid if you're
incarcerated? And
that all of that,
uh, cost
goes on to the county.
So we have a, a detention
center here in Socorro
and, you know, a lot of that
cost goes
to the counties. So I, I don't,
my personal opinion they're
already on that Medicaid. They shouldn't
lose their benefits
when they go in and then
it wouldn't be a problem when they come
out. That's just one
thing. The other thing
is provider
licenses in the State of New
Mexico. There's a real
issue there. A lot
of the credentialing issue
is a problem in the State of New
Mexico. Um
I don't think a lot of MC Os
would be happy
with if you just
said we're gonna credential one
area and
you're gonna have to cover
it,
turn this microphone
and you're going to have to cover it. So
I think it's already
a problem with insurance
in the State of New Mexico.
And if we
mandate
more,
the cost of insurance
is going to go up. And so
I don't know that that's such a great
idea to do that.
Uh The credentialing
part. I had a lot of issues
Mr. Chairman with
people who are trying to get licenses
here in New Mexico
and then the credentialing
was so hard
to do the process
because they, they were saying
that the, the Medicare
process was really quick
but it was the private
entities that were slow.
We did change that in
some of the contracts.
We added language in
there where they have to do it within
30 days. But are they, are
they really doing it in 30 days? And are
we watching that
um
uh and then authorizing
the pharmacy board and doh
to require pharmacies
again,
mandating on those
pharmacies who are not
getting reimbursed, like a
local independent
pharmacy will not get
the same reimbursement rate
as corporate
and, and I have,
if we make it fair,
all I want is fair.
If we make it fair,
then I'm fine with that with
the reimbursement part. But if
we, you know, I,
I have a, a
person that told
me about a, you know, a
drug where
big pharma made, you know,
billions off of two cancer
drugs.
And so
we, we,
uh
the reimbursement is an issue
in the State of New Mexico for
independent pharmacies
flat. And
that's it. We had one
here closed here
in, in
Socorro. So
I'm all for making it
better and, and doing,
you know, keeping people
safe and, and, and giving
them the everything they need
to succeed.
But when we talk, we're talking about
mandating here. I, I
get a little scared
of that. So
the 20
million that hasn't been
spent, do we
know why? And are they
working on something? Is there something
in the pipeline.
Mr. Chairman. Go ahead.
Eric.
>> Yeah, Mr. Chairman Representative,
you know,
I, I've had this conversation
with the department
several times.
I'm not, honestly, I don't
know why. Um, it's,
you know, there's a little bit that's been
encumbered, I think.
1, 1.5 million, something
like that.
Um,
last time I looked,
uh, the,
there's a plan,
um, you know,
there's,
but we haven't seen it mov'e
and we haven't seen it really
get spent down. So I,
you know, that's all I have
on that. Really?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and Eric. So there is a plan,
I'd, I'd like to see the
plan. What's the plan?
You know, are we just
gonna spend 20 million
making a plan and then
nothing comes of it. You
know, they're gonna come back and ask for more
money. But I
know this is one of the things
that's, that's on the governor's
agenda, but there's already
money and it's not
getting done and it's not
happening. So,
um any
barriers that we can
remove, I'm all about
it, but
mandating,
we, we have to be fair
to, to everyone
concerned in that. So that's
all. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
>> The
I messed it up when I moved
it.
Um
Part of that question
also was by Representative
Armstrong but at
the meeting
last week
with the L HHS
in Taos,
Senator Ortiz
Pino was very, very
concerned
that the funding had not been
spent which
they,
I'm just based
on what was discussed on the
meeting
mentioned that it would
be basic that there was
a plan and
then it didn't happen.
But he was very
concerned
and I think just
makes it harder, you know, if you
come in for
more funding and that
funding has not been
spent. But
he, he really has
a big concern about
that, you
know, that that was part of the
meeting.
Then I
was gonna ask you
um
by having
the capacity that we
have.
Does that do
anything to us
in the future for federal
funds?
>> Mr. Chairman,
if you could clarify the
capacity that we have now, or the
capacity that we're trying to grow,
>> uh the capacity that we have
now.
>> Um Well, maintaining the
capacity that we have now, I I
think, you know,
it would just kind of maintain the
status quo. If,
if we could grow the capacity,
then we could bring in
those providers and then they would
be able to build Medicaid
and, and
grow their
businesses.
>> Ok. So it's
ongoing
very well then
on page four,
where we have
um 42
approximately 42%
of New Mexico population is
covered by Medicaid.
And uh looking at the
chart,
the,
so
that high point on
fy
23
would that have been higher than
42?
Then
>> uh Mr. Chair and Senator say
that again would have been
>> well, looking at
the, at the chart
and you see that on,
on Fy 23
it's at the high point.
So, is that 42 or
is that
higher?
>> Oh, yeah, Mr. Chair, I,
I'm, I'm sorry? Yes. Yeah.
So that would have been
around probably
like 48 49%
back then. >> So
then Mr. Chairman, we
have, is
that doing better for New
Mexico or we have cut
it back down?
>> Well, Mr. Chair, I, I
don't want to
make a judgment on whether it's
better or worse.
But what I would say
is right now,
you know, um
during the pandemic,
the federal government
allowed
states to maintain
their roles on Medicaid. They didn't want
people kicking,
they didn't want states kicking people
off the Medicaid
rolls uh during
the pandemic. And so they allowed
them to stay on. Um,
once the pandemic ended,
the public health emergency
ended, then
uh the
federal government
required all
the states to go back and
re-evaluate
um
eligibility
for all uh
of their Medicaid
Members. And so that's why you
see that
large drop off or,
you know, significant drop
off
over 100,000 people
between Fy 23
and Fy 20 four. >> And
Mr. Chairman to, to that
part, is that what you meant by
dis enrollment?
>> That's right, Mr. Chair.
>> Ok. So then
did the Majority of them
come back or
was there a gap?
>> Uh It's no, it's, it's
probably honestly,
um this
fy 25 projected
is an, an amount from
their April
projection, I believe.
Um but
looking at the most recent
enrollment numbers, I, I
think it's gonna remain
pretty flat going forward.
So that
879,000
people number, uh,
enrollee number, I
believe that's probably gonna
stay
relatively,
um, flat
over the next, you
know,
six months or whatever,
barring any, you know, any
other big change that happens.
But >> the last
part that I have is,
um, can you elaborate
a little bit more on what you mentioned by
early childhood
home visits?
>> Right? So that was the
um early childhood
education and care department.
And so
um
the
Behavioral health, collaborative
purchases,
behavioral health
services
for um
all of the different
Members that are in the
collaborative, right? So like
they purchase services for
doh for
other other
um you know,
CYFD,
um some of HSD
stuff, a lot of the non
Medicaid matched funding.
Um Well, a big part
of that is they purchase the,
the um services
for early childhood home
visiting.
>> Mm OK.
All right, very well. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
>> Thank
you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank
you for the presentation.
My first question is
on page
five
um in
2004
that we created a
uh collaborative
single statewide behavioral
health system.
If I understood your
presentation,
the
uh
head of that collaborative
position has been vacant
for a year
now. >> Uh
Mr. Chairman roughly
around there.
>> So can
you Mr. Chairman,
can you give me some details
on why it's still
vacant. What effort
that's been put in? How many
people has been interviewed?
What are the, the details?
Is it a failure within our
system?
>> Uh Mr. Chairman, you know,
I know when I was speaking
with the uh
director
of the Health
Care Authority Behavioral Health
Services Division,
um he had said, I think they
had interviewed and this is about a month
ago. So there could
have been an update since then. But
um you know, they
had interviewed several
candidates. I I want to say three or
four. but
none of them
um were selected
for the position.
And so that's the most recent
that I've heard from
that. >> Thank you
Chairman. And thank you. So,
three or four within
the last six months or over the
whole 12 months, >> I think
within the last,
you know, month or so
is when they did that,
Mr. >> Chairman. Thank you
again. So
if I understand
correctly, basically
nothing's happened for 11 months
and then all of a sudden
we, we take, we
try and interview four people in
one
month.
>> That's sort of what it sounds
like, Mr. Chair
representative.
>> It would be great if we
could get an update on that
and understand
prior to the health
care authority taking
responsibility for this,
whose responsibility it was, why
nothing moved or if something
moved, what it
was with
respect to that
Mr. Chairman. My next question
is on the same page,
the collaborative is supposed to
meet on a
quarterly basis if I
understand correctly
and it hasn't met since
last September.
So,
basically four meetings
that it hasn't
had
in, in the last
12 months. We're, we're not that
far away so we can call
it safely, call it at least
three. Do
we have a reason for that?
And do we have,
um,
what I, what I, and I guess
where I'm going with this, Mr.
Chairman is we
continually we, I mean, we
just went through a presentation
of nothing of a whole bunch
of, of reds and
yellows.
We have a situation
here where we have some
have, have an
organization, we have a collaborative
that's not doing their
job.
Do we have I, is
there a step plan on how they
get, get back into
play and
what's the expectation?
And if there's not an
expectation,
how do we give that money to somebody
else that can turn around and do the
job?
>> Uh Mr. Chair
um Representative,
you know, I haven't seen a plan to
get it back online. I, I
believe, you know, once I
think their plan is, you know,
once they hire somebody
um to direct the
collaborative, then they would get those
meetings back online and, and
have them worked out,
you know, like I, I said, I believe
it's on the next slide
there. Um
There's,
oh, gosh, how much
um
well, 100 and 90 million
that gets
uh contracted out
through, through the
collaborative, that's
Nonfederal Medicaid
match money.
Um
And that's, that goes through
a what they call a administrative
services organization.
Um And that's
uh similar to like a
MC O, right? They,
they contract with the providers
directly.
Um
And I, I do believe that
that that part of the
system is moving,
you know, relatively
smoothly. It's just that there's
not a collaborative there to direct
their work and, and
uh make sure it's staying
on track.
>> Thank you, Chairman and thank you, Eric.
Well, I think you kind
of helped one of the
points we have. We're supposed
to have somebody steering a
ship.
We've got 100 and 90 million
out there, then nobody's,
nobody's watching how it's getting
spent.
Not saying that you guys don't
see it,
but the people that
should be
managing it should be
accountable could
possibly be sitting right
next to you.
Aren't, aren't answering
up to that.
You go back
and the
presentation beforehand
and you know, there's
what are the three basic questions
actual plan submitted by
agency, timeline assigned
and responsibility
assigned. Um
I think we're, we're all pretty good
that the behavioral health
collaborative on here
is a no in all of
those. How long
do we go
without
putting somebody on the,
on the hot
seat?
I mean, we proved
that in the 30
day Session when we turned
around with over half
of our agencies
in the red or in the yellow
in multiple areas
and we funded them more money.
We gave them the ability to hire
more people.
The one thing that you never do in
business, you never give a
failing department,
more money to
do less.
It's, it's confusing to
me
and Mr. Chairman Eric,
you know, the, the
statement that you made hoping
that it gets back up and
running. Um,
you know,
um, I, I think we need
to get away from hoping and I think
we need to get into
the legislative side of
our job. We're the ones
that
tell them that this is how
much money they're getting,
getting them in here and holding
them accountable. If
that person's not not
there, bring their boss in.
If that person's not there, bring
their boss in, keep
going until somebody
is held accountable for
it and
brings a plan that says
this is how we're gonna mov'e
forward.
We've increased spending by
25% in two
years, Mr.
Chairman.
Um
I'm not seeing in
any of these slides where we're seeing
a huge return on investment.
I do love the question, Mr.
Chairman that you made with
respect to what are the
key steps between the
previous administration and
this administration?
None of the data we have goes
back prior to 2019.
So that really doesn't help us. But it
would be a good thing to see
when we, when we look at
the 4% from
2019
and the increase to 10%
on that, that one slide that
you talked about, it
would be interesting to
see what the actual numbers
were. Not just looking
at the
um
percentage
with respect to that
on, on,
on a different subject. On slide,
nine
collaborative agencies
received 407
million in non
reoccurring
uh on the workforce
side, higher education
received
um
and has spent
almost all of
their appropriation.
What did they spend it
on? >> Uh
Mr. Chairman
Representative.
So those are primarily
for endowments. And so
when we say that they spent it,
it's, it's essentially
just a, a fund
transfer. It's, they've
taken the money, they've put it into
the endowment. um
and it's being invested and
then over time,
um
as that money is invested,
they'll take the interest
off of it and use it to
fund
um positions
for professors
in social work and
whatnot.
>> Mr. Chairman. Uh I'd
like to request that we get a
list of the endowments that are,
that this money is being
invested into and what
the benefit of each of those endowments
are
and proven benefit.
Not, this is our
goal.
We'll let you know if we hit
it,
>> Mr. Chairman and
Representative on that point, you
basically provided enough
money to double
the teaching capacity of the
schools of social work in the State.
And let's hopefully
double the number of graduates
that they're producing to go work
in the behavioral
health fields, uh child
welfare and other
um other fields
that are needed schools
that are needed around the State.
So that was the, the
purpose of that funding.
We will be
proposing to hold a hearing
on the status of that as well as
other strategies that you'd
invested in, in September in
Albuquerque. >> Excellent.
Thank you for that very
much Charles. So,
with that,
we've put an
endowment in,
I'm gonna speed it up. Thank you,
Chairman. With, we put
an endowment in place. We're, we're
hiring professors
to do the work for stu
students that
we're paying for,
to get educated
in so many different ways and then
not requiring them to be in the State.
So I'd love to know what the
graduation rate is and how
many of those students actually
stay in the State.
And if our investment is
worthwhile, me
May be worthwhile for another
State, but it's not helping us out
any.
Um
I'm gonna last question, I
had a whole bunch more. But
what happened with Western
Sky? Why are they
no longer an MC O?
And uh
who made that choice?
Did they make that choice? Did
the State make that
choice?
>> Uh Mr. Chair and representative.
So it was a, there was a new,
um you know, every
few years the
department has to go through a new
procurement process.
So there is a new
um you
know, request for proposals.
Um The department,
you know, went through the,
the
process
of
um doing that.
RP.
Um They selected
uh
you know, Western Sky
wasn't, wasn't a part of that
selection
and it went to United and Molina
instead.
Um You know, and there are
some other things that happened kind of
in between there but that's
essentially a big, big
picture of what happened. >> Ok.
Fair enough. And with
that, I have some other questions
offline with respect to that.
Thank you,
Mr.
>> Representative Lujan.
We, we might have to do like courts
and corrections and go to
Fivein.
>> That's fine. I'd
be
Mr. Chair.
So page
16 of your presentation treatment
courts. Uh This
is pretty alarming to me that
we have been spending
42% or
putting in 42% increase
into our budget.
And with the a decrease
by 20% and
13% respectively
through those uh those
treatment courts, I I'd ask
that, can we get a
and I know you have this information, but
for, I think it's in September
that Charles
mentioned that we're going to be readdressing
some of this information is
to have all
this,
those courts and their
respected numbers
and
um, the number of individuals
served and where
those courts are. I
mean, all that's
pretty relatives. And my point
being that I would
like, and I'm looking at uh
potential Legislation to
consolidate some of these, these
court services
so that we can
um better manage them.
I don't know if that's the complete answer,
but I've been talking with our
Supreme Court
justices
about this Mr. Chair and I just
like to say that they have
some, they have
some uh talking
points and, and maybe we should
contact them as well on that
issue. Um
Second part Mr.
Chair, I was up in
hh as in
house, I guess
it was a week before last and
talking about the work
shortages in New
Mexico and it was
reported in LC. According to the New
Mexico Workforce Solutions
department,
labor shortage
in the State is health care
workers with a
particularly strong need for
nurses and even with all
the funding that we've given
uh to HED for the
funding, it was in this report
that suggests that
even if all those that
we support
through
the the provisions that we put
forward and we were to
retain all those students
that are invested in
those programs, we'd still be
at a a shortage.
So I wanted to make sure
we're, we're capturing that. Can
you add anything to that, Mr.
Chair,
>> uh Mr.
Chair, >> the amount of money
that we're spending, Mr. Chair
for HED for all
of our healthcare professional
type programs. And
if we were to retain all those
just to clarify, if we
were to tain all those students to work
here in New Mexico, we'd still be at
a large vacancy.
>> Um Mr. Chair and
representative from that report.
That's correct.
>> Right. And so Mr. Chair
and just the last thing I'll I'll add
here is looking at
some of the proposals from
those that are presented
there on the professional
healthcare professional recruitment.
Some of the proposals that
they they asked for were
to increase healthcare professional recruitment
funding by
$2 million.
They say currently there are limited
funds overall because of medical health
profession demand
but very little for active
behavioral health recruitment
and retention.
Um And they
asked for a second thing for
500,000 in
funding to the New Mexico Health
Service Corps for student
stipends and community-based
projects. And
third point to assure that new
Mexico domiciled
masters of social workers, students
attend school tuition
free and to assure
licensure of
BS W graduates in
order to allow them to work
effectively
in community linkages. There
was a whole,
a lot of information there.
And are we doing any of
those things that they asked for?
Proposal Mr. Chair? Then that's all
I have >> uh
Mr. Chair and
representative, you know,
I, I don't believe so. I'd have to go
back and look at them one by one to
give you a definitive answer
on that.
Um
You know, I think you're
maybe quoting from the report
that Rian did Ruben
Esco. >> That's correct.
>> And if, if
those recommendations are in
there, it's because they're not doing
them. >> I'm sorry, Mr., those
recommendations were
from
New Mexico Health Resources
with Jerry N Harrison
PhD.
>> Mr. Chair and representative, I'd,
I'd have to go back and, and
look at those one by one to tell
you if they're in there or not.
>> That's all I have Mr. Chair. I
appreciate the
time.
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for the great brief
uh Mr. Chair first.
Um I just highlight
the, I think some of the loan
repayment and stipend
pieces. We've done a great deal of
work. We've seen
the medical loan repayment
be uh work
very well to
represent Lohan's point. I
think this is
clearly an area where
where there's
more capacity and we can
invest more and
get that sort of uh
return with folks
committed to serving uh
new Mexicans
and build on Mr.
Chair. The
educational
pipeline that
I fully believe is being
committed or
created with
uh the endowment funds.
Um
My one question,
uh you
know, there's so much of this is
implementation.
Do we think that with the addition
of Ruby an and the
additional LFC
health analysts
uh working closely with
LH HS
and other
stakeholders,
can we help the
Executive
implement these
areas? I
think as you know,
the question was brought
up. Yeah, I guess
how can we help the
Executive
implement the funding
that's being provided? And then
we're working with the Executive
to set aside during the
Session.
>> Uh Mr. Chair.
Absolutely. Um,
and, and I, I think we, we
spend a lot of time, I mean, as
staff, we spend a lot of
time,
um, working with the
departments, um,
the different agencies
responsible for spending the
funding.
Um,
and I, I think a lot of
it goes back to
just,
um,
getting that funding out
there. You know, I know, I
know, you see, like, you
know, on the one page with
the, you know,
nonrecurring spending,
you know, there's a, a small
amount that's been spent so
far, but some of that
came from 2024 a large
chunk of it. 100
and some
OD million don't quote me. But,
um,
that came from our 2024
appropriations.
Um, I'm sorry, from
2020 23
appropriations.
And,
um,
they've got the grants out there,
they've awarded the grants
and now it's time
for the, um,
awardees to start
spending that money and getting that money
flowing. And so some of it
just takes time.
Um,
uh, some of it though has, has
just sat around like that $20
million that we were talking about. It's
not really done anything.
>> Ok. Thank you for
that more nuance.
Uh, in
understanding what's
sort of completely
untouched and unspent
versus as you just
outlined that scenario.
Um
So, and, and
appreciate the
commitment from
LFC
to partner with the
Executive
to implement funds
because they don't do any
good not being spent.
Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
>> Thank you.
I mean, I don't know how many years
we've talked about since the last
administration of rebuilding mental
health, right in New
Mexico.
And
I mean, we've thrown
everything in the, by the kitchen
sinking. They're just kind of like
crying
and,
and I don't really know how to fix it
from here on for. I mean, do
we, do you have
any ideas? I mean, the pro
agencies don't spend the
money. We're in
this big scramble. That's all we
hear. I mean, throughout
the campaign season that I was
in, in the
Gallup, New Mexico and the Reds,
right? It was all about
mental health services and,
and I know that it was in
our last LFC meeting
in Gallup in,
I think that was in May, right?
They said there were six providers
within Gallup. Well,
only two had storefronts
that I knew of and
one wasn't really a mental
health, but a physician
that was having
women's health issues
and, and the other one
was a up and coming
company and so
there really was none. And,
and prior to that, I know
Presbyterian Medical Services
had one. You had to
call Monday at eight.
If you didn't call Monday at
eight, or they didn't answer the
phone, they would not
allow you to have a,
an appointment, you had to call
the next Monday. Well, mental health
Services doesn't work that
way. And so
I, I mean, how we
have, what, 980
million. I'm trying to
think. I'm already confused
on numbers today. We spent
almost 980 million. I think
in this report on
mental health services over the
last two years or three
years,
>> Mr. Chairman, it depends
on if you're talking about the recurring or the
nonrecurring. Um
It, it's about annually,
the recurring is about 900
million or honestly
for fy 25 it's about 1.2
billion. Um,
and then the nonrecurring
um is about
407 million. That's out
there right now. >> So
1.5 billion
in total packages across the
State.
That's correct. And we can't mov'e the
needle, we can't
mov'e the needle in crime, we can't
mov'e the needle in mental health.
I mean, 1.2 billion
divided by 2 million. How much
can we give each person
individually to go
find a mental health person
at, at probably $1000 an
hour or something? I mean,
I don't know how we solve this problem but this
is like number one
issue coming, right. It
comes back to crime. It comes
back to kids
that in school that aren't
graduating, it comes back to
every portion to
poverty, to
every portion that
we've that we go to. And it's
gotten worse since COVID
because, you know, now that
everybody needs mental
health or everybody's claiming
ptsd. And it, it's
a real fact. But
I mean, it's, it's every
loet facet
of life. Right.
And I don't know how we get our hands
around it and get ahead. I mean,
ARPA money was put for 20
million and we've discussed that time
blue in the face. And then
three years later it's not
spent. Right. Then they mov'e to another
agency says they're gonna spend
it and they don't spend
it and, and we just keep going
and going and going.
I don't know where you draw the line in the
sand and say, you know,
$1.5
billion
and we
can get services from
Vegas to
Lee County. You just
go in this U shaped
room, right?
How do, how do we, I
mean,
I don't know, I, I'm in
business so every day I have to fix a
problem. Right.
And for
15 years or right
now, right. I've
been here and we haven't fixed the
problem. I mean, it's
pretty sad with
1.5 billion over the last
three years that we can't fix a problem
and nobody's
screaming, oh, we need more money for
behavioral health. They just can't seem
to do it.
And I don't know,
Eric, you're the analyst, you're in the
trenches.
>> Well, Mr. Chairman, I mean, it
all
starts with just
overseeing those
big MC O
contracts and
having higher
um
requirements on those MC
OS to build out their,
their networks,
you know. Um, I
think we've done
a lot in rate
increases as far as,
you know, on, on the legislative
side, um,
spending, you know,
appropriating the money.
Um, a lot of the
ball is kind of in their
court in the Executive
side's court to
make sure they're overseeing,
um,
these contracts
and that they're
ensuring
that
we're getting our money's
worth, um,
as a State out of those
contracts. >> But didn't
we have an MC O contract
that they came
back and said, you're not,
you're not providing this
service. They
said, ok, we're going to find
you a million dollars
or maybe they agreed to a
million, but the cost was even
more and they had, they
did something else with the money
instead
and, and they still got to
mov'e ahead next year and
nothing's changed.
>> Yeah, Mr. Chair. So sometimes
there's
fines or fees that they,
or penalties. I'm
sorry that they put on the
MCO um
for say,
uh you
know, missing
their performance target
on um, well,
child checkup
visits.
Um
and when they miss that, they'll
levy a, a
penalty against
the MC O but a lot of
times what they do is they say, ok,
we'll give you the, the funding
back
um in the form of
as long as you
uh
um agree
to
um ameliorate this
issue using that funding.
Um And so
I don't, I don't know if, if that's
the best way to
oversee those
contracts,
they'll, they'll call that reinvestment
into the MC
O.
>> So, I mean, and I mean,
there's other problems with the MC O
contracts too, right?
In, in health care.
I mean, and we
just have one MC O provider,
right?
>> No, there, there's, now,
there's so there's under the
new turquoise care that just went into
place on July 1st. There's four
now.
>> So then how do we get accountability
to the MCO S?
>> Um, like I said, I
mean, overseeing
those performance targets,
making sure that they meet those
performance targets.
Um And if they don't,
you know, enforcing those
penalties,
um
and I, I do think that there's
probably, probably needs to
be, uh,
you know, maybe some better oversight
on the, on the financial
side too.
>> So I think Ruby
and, and who else is our analyst
for the healthcare
stuff?
Nathan. So,
I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, you're gonna have to put some
performance metrics in there and
then start looking at the Session if they
don't perform, then let's start the
finds that are
nonnegotiable,
right in
statute because
they'll get negotiated down
from a, you know, million dollar
fine. And if you go do this, we won't find
you the money and then you get to keep that
money even though you didn't
provide the services.
So I think those
guys need to really start looking
within LFC
and figure out if they
aren't providing the services, we get the
money back, plus they get
a fine or they lose our
contracts. You gotta have
something to start moving the needle
because it's just not
moving.
I mean, you take 1.5 billion
and you split it before between
four people just call it
400 million apiece.
What they make on their
deposits
at 6% it and
they don't do anything.
It's pretty damn good money.
So uh
uh I don't know,
we're gonna have to really get a
hold of this because it's
starting to irritate me
because nothing's ever
changing.
So it's like
the pothole 940. It's
always
there.
Thanks, Eric.
Thank you,
Senator Bedi. Got his polls
fixed but not
his mental health
yet.
We're gonna go to
uh
Toby, I think you're here.
Yeah.
Is there any one or is it
off?
>> Mm,
good afternoon. Good afternoon,
Mr. Chairman and Members.
Um Thank you for having
us. I'm Toby Velasquez. I'm the director
of the New Mexico State Parks Division
and I have with me, Colleen Baker.
She's the bureau chief for design and
Development uh team with uh
State Parks that
team has our architects, our
civil engineer and
our uh technical
staff that lead the
capital projects across
the division. The New Mexico
State Parks Division has
35 State parks found
in 25 of
33 counties across the
State of New Mexico. We're an important
part of our,
our New Mexico team. We've been around now
91 years
and so we're starting to pivot
towards our centennial uh
coming up in about nine years. So
we're happy to be here this afternoon.
Um I take it everybody has
their presentation so we'll get going
on that um
slide one. I wanted
to provide an update on the
Amer uh the ARPA funding.
I know that's a interest,
a topic of interest as
we just heard and
give a little bit of a status
report on where we're at. With
that. We broke it down
into the primary
um
expense categories of equipment,
professional services and
improvements. Uh Total
expenditures to date is
16.8 just over
16.8 million.
Um The balance is about
3.1 million and we
have a, a future slide
where we will show you where the balance
is going to be expended as well.
Uh Well, before the
deadline uh next
year, um I just
have to say thank you for
that arpa uh
funding. I, I've
been with the division now, almost 26
years. I've never seen so many
zeros behind our
agency. Uh Funding
code. Uh And so
this appropriation has meant a lot
for uh communities
and State parks across the
State of New
Mexico.
Uh As we break into the next
slide, slide number three,
we broke it down by regional
investments. Uh We have
five regions as we manage
for operationally and
administratively within the State of
New Mexico and the State
park system, the northwest,
northeast, southwest, southeast
and central regions. And
you can see the expenditures
and how they were uh what I
feel balanced uh to
fulfill the needs of those regions.
Uh From 3.3
all the way to 4.2 and as
low as 2.7 million.
Um You'll see that there's another
category in statewide
where we invested uh over
$800,000. Uh
that was to infrastructure
that impacts the management
of the system statewide, not
specifically to a park or a
specific
region.
Um Moving along on to slide
number four, some
of the completed
projects in progress, uh
Some of the completed and
projects in progress,
for example, are Fenton
Lake uh campground
and recreation improvements.
Uh Fenton Lake pound for
pound is one of the most visited
State parks in the system.
Um Primarily because of its
proximity to our
largest population
center, uh which is
Albuquerque and Rio Rancho.
Uh Sugary Canyon Dior
campground development. Sugary
Canyon is in Colfax
County in the northeast
region. Uh on the New
Mexico Colorado border.
Uh living desert zoo and garden
exhibits an infrastructure
renovation. Uh
We're one of the few State park
systems, State agencies
actually that still run
a zoo across the country.
Most are run by municipal
or county or private
operations. So we're one of the
few State parks
that still manages for a zoo
and it's an important part of
the visitor experience in Eddy
County. Um
We also invested in our
first State park, Hyde
Memorial State Park.
Uh The Septic system replacement
uh project was a big deal
for Hyde Memorial as
we talk about being in our 91st
year. Unfortunately,
many of the systems uh
below ground
uh have been ridden
several years past their
lifeline. And so
these funds were
prioritized to help
catch some of these parks up with
their infrastructure.
Uh Pecos Canyon is our
newest and 36
35th State
Park uh in San
Miguel County and just a
note. Uh
San Miguel County has the most
State parks of any county within
its jurisdiction. There
are four State parks within
San Miguel County and
Hyde Memorial is one of them.
The other three are Villanueva
Story and Conchas
Lake all reside
within um San
Miguel County.
The Pecos Canyon Recreation area
development was a project
that started under the Richardson
administration when it became
uh acquired for State
Park status. Uh We
were able to uh
finally get the financial
capital and human resource
support that we needed
in order to turn it into a functioning
State park in
2019. And Pecos
Canyon is doing well.
We have uh changed
uh the view of how those properties
are managed in the canyon. We
have high visitation and
we're happy that that recreation
area is being developed now through
the funding provided through
ARPA.
What's left
in that $3.1
million that was left in
Arpa funds which we have
till June 30 to expend
of next year. We
have plans for
Sugary Canyon up in Colfax
County for visitor center,
structural repairs.
Uh Pecos Canyon continued
Pecos Canyon recreation area
development. We're going
to improve the electrical
system at Villanueva.
Uh Villanueva State
Park in San Miguel is another one of those
parks whose infrastructure was
developed in the sixties
and early seventies and
not much had done, been
accomplished in improving it since
then. Uh Cimarron
Canyon is a property that we
actually lease to manage
on behalf of a State park
from the Department of Game and
Fish. Uh We're improving
septic systems, the visitor
center and residents.
Um Uniquely
in the State park system,
we manage housing.
We have 45
homes scattered
across the system,
many in rural areas
that if we did not have
those homes, it would be
very difficult for us to recruit and
retain employees because
there's either no housing or very
limited housing or very expensive
housing. Uh That would
not be conducive for State
employees to be able to manage
for. Um So
these, these, these, this housing
system is also an
investment that we're making across
the division.
Um The Lake Rogers
Road, Arroyo,
uh you know, many of these areas
uh that we manage for. This is an
interstate streams
commission property as well
as a village of Logan property that
we manage as a State park.
And many of these
drainage area areas have
been hampering
operations and threatening
public safety for years.
And so we're happy that out in Quake
County, we're able to spend some
money to improve the Lake Rogers
road, Arroyo and,
and road crossings.
Uh Also down in the southwest
region, we have Leesburg Park
Road improvements. Leesburg
Dam is another situation
where we manage it uh
as a State park on
behalf of a federal
partner. Um
Leesburg Dam is owned by the Bureau
of reclamation and so
these are um collaborations
that we have to have with our co managing
partners. In order to make
these projects come to fruition
across a variety
of park ownerships.
Only nine of the
35 State parks are
owned outright by Amner,
the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources
Department, State Parks
Division. The remain
are owned by federal State
or local partners.
For example, Murphy Lake
State Park which actually
burned in the uh
Calf Canyon. Hermit's peak fire
is owned by the Asias de
La Isla, is
San Jose in Mora
County. And so we have
a variety of partners that we
work with in order to execute
these
improvements.
Um The next slide slide
number six actually
shows a
geographic representation
of where these funds are being
expended and you
can tell that they're all
across the State in the four
corners in the central area.
Uh We are investing these ARPA
funds and have
invested these ARPA funds
uh as broadly and
diversely as possible.
However, the
initial evaluation
was need which
parks needed these funds
the most in priority.
But it's been a nice
distribution of expenditures as
you can see.
Um Next,
we want to talk about the fy
25
appropriation, the 16 million,
which we are again,
very thankful. And with
that, I'm gonna turn it over
to Bureau Chief Colleen
Baker to present that to you
all.
>> Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman
and Members of the Committee. Thank you for
having us here this afternoon.
Uh The next few slides
are going over projects
that we have under development
right now. Um Either
in some kind of assessment
phase or planning and
design phase uh
for the four
parks that were named in the
appropriation and
as, as well as statewide
projects. But for the four
named parks uh
at Conscious Lake, we
have a boat ramp
replacement that we have under
100% designed.
We do have some issues to work
out with the Army
Corps of Engineers lease on that
property before we can go to
construction. But we were
are working towards that.
We are also working to upgrade
the water treatment system. We
have added a chlorine
dosing system uh
but we're in the process of
actually re evaluating and,
and redeveloping that
entire water system for the
park. We are
also in initial
stages of looking at
what redevelopment of the old
marina looks like in the
first stage would be actually
uh remediation of the
old buildings that are there that have
hazardous waste and need to be
removed
in anticipation of being able
to develop that
area
at Story Lake State Park.
We are under design for
electric, electrical
upgrades, a
waterline replacement
for the entire uh internal
distribution system.
Looking at the
old vehicular bridge
that is no longer in
surface um
and potentially
repurposing that as
a pedestrian bridge
and then replacing the
vehicular bridge
uh for access to that part of
the park.
Um replacing
the septic system for the gas
river campground comfort station
that's been out of service for a while
and resto
restoring the visitors center.
There are some issues that building has
is old and, and and does
need some care.
At Elephant Butte Lake State
Park. We are
um just
completed a framework plan.
So the overall design
plan
for
that included connection to the
city of Elephant Butte sewer
system, an RV
dump station,
an aquatic invasive species
station,
improvements to Ridge
road,
um replacement or
repair of the main
boat ramp and
looking at some kind of visitor
point of contact.
Uh We are currently under
construction um
on the
rehabilitation of two of the
main comfort stations at the
entrance and
I have started
demolition of the
comfort station where the
visitor point of contact is planned
to go that the conversation
was beyond repair
and because we have a different
programming there, we took the
time now to begin that
demolition and remove
that that
building so that we can start
preparing for a new visitor
center
at Navajo Lake. We
are underway in
the management plan and
framework plan to guide
development along the river
and also at the reservoir.
We are just
completed an assessment of the
parking and access improvements
that are needed for the pine
recreation area particularly
at the marina.
So we'll be looking at
uh implementing some
of those access and parking
improvements.
We are looking to replace
the the
stations for both
the pine
marina and also
the uh
campground and
also replace the sewer
line. It's an old
cast iron sewer
line that needs to be
replaced.
We are completely
replacing the Cottonwood campground
water system
and we are also gonna be replacing
the water treatment systems
at both the Pine recreation area
and the Sims Mesa recreation
area. And then we
are looking at redeveloping
the lower government camp,
which was the
camp where, where the workers
were housed, when the, the dam
was built,
we'll take it from
there.
>> Thank you, Colleen
on uh slide number
11, I want to take a little bit of
time to discuss
with, with the Committee,
what the capital planning
uh is comprised of and how we
come to these decisions
over the course of time.
Um We are by administrative
rule mandated to
generate fiveyear park
management plans.
Um And we are behind
uh on doing that for
multiple reasons, but
we're back in a groove and I
believe that the management
plans that, that I will speak
about here in uh a few
minutes are the best
version of our park management
and framework plans that we've
had as an agency,
the professionalism, uh
the comprehensive and holistic
approach that are being
taken, not only for
visitors but for
preservation and conservation
of uh the parks
themselves are better than ever
before. Um And
so we are in the
right track, but we have a lot of work
to do. The framework
plan is the overall
plan that
talks about what signage is gonna
look like. What acquisition
or other opportunities
might we might have looking
forward. Um, it
gives uh,
specific
information on how the build
out will come within
the park management plan.
And then we have our capital improvement
plan, the IC IP that we
file for every year
that each of you get and
have the ability to review.
It's a, it's an aggressive,
ask more aggressive than
we've ever had. Um,
over the course of the next five
years, we've uh
earmarked and requested
65 million. Uh
That's something that the division has
never put
together uh through
our support with emer.
Um Part of
that is because we've seen what we
can do. We,
we can do more. We
have, uh over the years
averaged between four and
$6 million in
capital fund, uh capital
projects. That was
really what we were uh targeted
for as far as funding goes.
But with ARPA, we
learned that we could
leverage contractors, we
could leverage uh
uh design
contractors as well as
consultants that could
mov'e the work out of
our office and through
the process. And I think
that the expenditures for
ARPA are an example of what we
can do when we have the
funding to engage those external
resources. That's
not to be said that with this level
of expectation of growth for
capital investment that
we do not need to grow
our design and development team.
We only have one
engineer,
two architects,
a bureau chief and a
planner.
We need to grow that back to where
it was
years ago.
And so we,
we, we hope that we can demonstrate
the need to grow our FTE
staff in order to drive
these capital
projects to the
extent that we need to make these
expenditures out in the
field and have more
of an impact on visitors and our
communities.
Um When we look at the framework
plans, uh
you can see that we completed Pecos
and Eagle Nest. They're available on
our website. They're
two of the the most
uh professional products that we've put
out there as far as our
framework plans go.
Um in progress,
we have Fenton Navajo Living
Desert Zoo and Gardens,
Vado, Heron, Oliver Lee and
Pancho Villa.
Uh Upcoming. We have Concha
story, Santa Rosa,
Ute Villanueva
and Elephant Butte and the
beauty about this framework and park
management plans are that they are
publicly vetted.
These are not plans that we create
internally specifically
with review and approval by our own
staff. We go to the
public with these plans,
we take their input, we integrate
it into the plans. We
um engage
all stakeholders including
adjacent agencies,
local municipal county,
federal. Uh
and it is a vetted plan that
we then mov'e forward with
knowing that the public and
our agency partners
are in tune
with.
And I'll kick it over to,
to Colleen so she can talk a little bit
about looking forward
and what we evaluate
as we look forward in the
present and in the future
as far as uh investments
go.
>> Thank you, Toby.
So, in preparing for
this presentation today,
we were asked,
what our aspiration
would be if
funding wasn't an issue,
where would we like to be
if we could fix everything that's
broken and
improve the parks?
So in looking at
that, we looked
at four general
areas of infrastructure that
we'd like to improve across
the State park system.
Uh The first is facilities and
infrastructure. That's all the
things that we see, the
roads, electrical
upgrades. Um A lot
of our sites, sites still
have the 30 amp.
Most of the
recreational vehicles
out there are requiring 50
amp if not more. Um
but at least upgrading our
services and upgrading our
RV pedestals to
50 amp. Um
is a general
um desire
across the State park system.
As Toby mentioned, staff
housing is critical for
our functioning and being
able to provide
staffing at these State
parks in these rural
areas. Our
water wastewater systems, we've
made a lot of headway over the years
with the appropriations we have
received for water wastewater
improvements. Um,
but there's a lot of miles
of old water
lines and, and wastewater lines
that need to be replaced.
Um, a lot of our
voi vault toilets, we just did an
inventory of all the vault toilets
that need to be replaced.
Um, and unfortunately
the, the costs of vault
toilets has gone up in,
um, significantly over
the years. A lot
of our boat ramp infrastructure
is failing.
Um, it needs to be
replaced
and then just generally
park facilities. Um
the visitor centers, the
comfort stations, uh
Any of the, the buildings
that we have in the campground
facilities.
Another area we'd really like to
focus on is the natural
infrastructure. This is
what people
come to see the
the natural areas,
the the reservoirs, the beautiful
spaces that they like to be in.
So really
investing in
the health of these, these
spaces and
what the the I
think one of the good examples is at
Pecos Canyon where
we've been able
to start resting
and restoring some of the
areas along the river where it had
been hit so hard by
recreation impact
and try to manage that,
try to manage the invasive
species, restore
some of the restoration in the
wetlands and oil
conservation and managing
visitor use. And it
also includes managing
all of the historic
buildings and cultural
sites that we have on our properties.
We've been doing a lot of
work in
stabilizing and
renovating
facilities like it bottomless
with the whole the historic
water tower at Poncho
Villa, with the Customs
House and the old meeting
hall. So those historic
structures, they're
unique and they can't
really be replaced. We
need to do our best
to keep them
um rehabilitated
and in good shape.
Another major area is
energy conservation.
Uh We've a
couple of years ago, completed
the installation of a micro
grid um
at Hyde Memorial State Park
that took the that State
park completely off the grid. It is
now um about
85% solar
energy with a backup
generator. Um but
it is completely off the grid.
So we'd like to expand
the solar energy
across the State parks. A
lot of these State parks are
out, there's
a lot of sun out there
so we should take advantage of
that.
Um We would
like to invest
in ev charging
stations um across the
State parks where it makes sense.
We're working with NM dot
To look at
the
routes that people are taking
and that might make sense for
electric vehicle charging
stations.
We'd like to
trade out our fleet
so that it's electric
vehicles. And
we actually have a pilot
project where we're going to
be turning
trading Messia Valley
State Bosque
State Park, um
turning it completely over
to electric.
So we'll be implementing
charging stations for fleet
there and putting fleet
vehicles in as well
as chainsaws,
um electric
uh tools and, and
those kinds of things. So
we'll give it a try see how it
works, see what the the
capacity is and how that
works.
Energy efficiency,
led lighting and and other
kinds of energy efficiencies
in our buildings, harvesting
water. And part of this
is also just automation of
our staff resources.
So making sure that pay
kiosks or online
services are available
so that we don't have as
much staff
time invested
in in payment
systems.
J
we are actually underway
right now on energy
audits, investment
grade energy audits at
20 of our State
parks to determine
what the energy conservation
measures would be for
each of those parks. And
once we get through those 1st
20 as funding is
available, we will work through
the other
15 of our State
parks >> if
I can jump in real quick. And these energy
audits are important for the
division. Um One
of the highest cost of
doing business is our recurring costs,
utilities uh
can increase
and and usually never go back down.
And so these energy audits
are going to be crucial in giving
us a game plan
for future investments
that will help reduce
our recurring audit, our
recurring
costs
for
utilities.
>> Thank you, Toby.
So, one of the last areas
that we we're looking at is
recreation amenities. Of course, this
is the fun part. This is the part
where people really get to
interact with State
parks. We'd really
like to work on our
interpretive resources,
um Diversifying
recreation opportunities
there's, there's a lot
out there with outdoor
recreation and
the potential New
Mexico has
to, to market
um, New Mexico for
outdoor recreation. Uh,
whether that be
um hiking,
mountain biking paddle
craft, there are lots
of different opportunities for different
user uh groups.
Part of that is trails
looking at, at blue trails,
looking at bike packing kind
of um equestrian
trails. So really
reaching out to different user
groups, um
Looking at a variety of camping
options. We have
Yurts at Hyde
Memorial State Park.
We are just now completing
cabins at Coyote
Creek State Park
and at Charet
Canyon State Park.
So we'll see how those cabins
are received by the public and
whether that's an opportunity
we've also engaged
with
um
other other firms
out in the public that
offer like like tenter
that have kind of
glamping um
opportunities that might,
might work for State
parks.
Uh We're looking at cellular
service and Wi Fi
in the State parks for
because that's
service users are
demanding.
Um, looking at investing
in paddle craft amenities because
we know that the,
the boat infrastructure right now
is very, very geared towards
motorboats and and larger
boats. So we want to make sure that the
panel craft amenities are
there.
We really want to focus on what
an accessible experience
is not just meeting
regulation and code,
but actually,
um figuring out
what a good accessible
experience is for
users and providing
that and
then looking at opportunities
for adding on to existing
State parks and potentially other
State parks. Like we just
completed the Broad Canyon
feasibility study,
but also
added property
to the Coyote Creek
State Park as well. So
where it makes sense,
adding property
to the existing State
parks.
So the four previous
slides were really an
effort to kind of
wrap our hands around. What would
that um
ideal
development of the State parks
look like
to provide kind
of a stepwise
approach to what
would that cost at different
levels? So what we
have on this slide
is
to to to keep doing
what we're doing and kind of triage
repairs and replacements.
So they need to happen. That's
what our current request is for
the next, the IC IP the
65 million and
we can, we're, that's what we're
doing. We're continuing to work on
making sure that the, the
the most need
is what we take care of
first,
in order to take one more
step up
and make not noticeable
improvements that park users
really can start to see like
what we're doing at Coyote
Creek, like the
new comfort station and campground
development that we're doing at
Eagle Nest Lake State
Park. If you've been up there,
those are
taking about
$5 million per
park. Um
So if we were to invest about
$5 million per park,
that's what this next level would
be if
we were to really step up and
be a leader in outdoor
recreation,
like, you know, what, what
there's been some efforts in our
State to do and really
um enhance the outdoor
recreation,
um and prepare
for our 100th year
anniversary.
Then looking at something
closer to a $15
million per park except at our
larger parks. Uh May
be a higher level investment.
That's what the, the third
stage is
at $700
million. We would actually be
able to be a
leader in the Western
States and possibly even the
nation in what outdoor
recreation looks
like.
>> And
so
thank you, Representative
Chatfield, >> thank you,
Mr. Chair.
Uh
Several of these things
are in my district and, and are
of interest to me. One of
them is consciously.
Uh so
a few things uh questions
about conscious you
said the co I, I
assume you're talking about
what I call North Dock.
We used to have South Dock. It
had a, had a
uh lodge
there and they closed it and then
North Dock and they closed the docks
at the, at North Dock,
store, bar,
rest uh restaurant.
It, it's all closed.
Uh So you got,
so did
I understand that you're gonna put some
more boat docks in there
where the North dock is
now?
>> So Mr. Chairman and
representative, our
plan is
to
take those buildings out
and recreate a platform that
someone would be interested in coming
and setting up a concession
or a marina.
Um
We hope that we could bring
business back to Conchas.
And the first step is to
clear the deck of those old
buildings so that there's not a burden
for them in liability
and hopefully find a business
partner that could come in
and come with a marina
plan uh or
a, a whatever plan
to create some
more visitor ship
due to the concessionaire.
So there's going to be an
investment to clean up what's
there? Uh There
is a high level of asbestos
across all of those facilities.
Um
We hope that if we create
an attractive platform
that a business will find its
way to partner
with us at Concho.
>> So Mr. Chair, many
years ago when I went
into that country, uh
conscious was a jump
in place. It had
North Dock which
had a, a store, a
restaurant and a bar.
It had the, the
lodge on South Dock
which, uh,
had a, a number of
activities. People from, even
Europe came there. I,
I've seen met people there
from Switzerland. Then
it had, uh, had
the, uh,
Mac and Mary Busher had a
place just where you left,
uh, left conscious.
And, uh, everybody
went there on Friday
and, and did, did
their thing had fun.
The thing that changed
was, can an Air Force base
pulled their recreation
center out and that
change, that kind of
spiraled after
that. And that
was a big,
uh,
big change in, in
concious and it, and it went downhill,
uh, still
got a good lake there, still
got plenty of water
and, and boats. And I,
is there any,
uh
were you aware of that? And
is there any thought that May possibly
you could work together with the
Air Force Base to
put a recreation center
back in there? I, you got a
golf course, you've got a lake,
you've got all the, all
the things that it takes.
Uh, would that
be a possibility to,
to talk to the Air Force about
bringing back the recreation
center, >> Mr.
Chair and Representative.
Um, we have had those
conversations in the last three
years with uh the Corps
of Engineers as well as
uh the base
and we thought they
were going to mov'e, uh, they had money
to invest. Uh, they were coming
up with plans for
uh soldier enrichment
opportunities in the outdoor recreation.
Obviously, they have one
of the highest suicide rates of
any base across the
country. And we
thought that we were gonna be able to get into a
trilateral agreement
both on the south side and
in the north uh recreation
area with the military
and they pulled out, um, for
whatever reason. And so
they had willing partners with the Corps
of Engineers and the State Parks
Division uh to explore
those opportunities. Um We can
certainly follow back up
with them to determine
whether or not Cannon is still
interested or maybe
seeking other a authorizations
to reen engage that discussion.
But just three years ago, we,
we were working towards this
becoming uh something
very similar to what you've
described
with a focus not only
on, on general
visitor, but
how the quality of
life for soldiers at
Cannon could be
improved to hopefully
reduce the suicide
rate.
>> So Mr.
Chair, I would
love to help push that
forward if I, like I
say that's in my district,
Clovis is in my
district. The Air Force base is in
my district and Concious
Lake is in my district.
I, if I could be of any
help. Uh I ask
you please to keep me in
the in the loop
and uh
uh any way
that I could help push that forward,
I would love to do. I
think that
if you're going to
put in some improvements
there. That's, that would be a
major, major
change in, in that,
in that, uh,
situation.
Uh, you
know, what, what,
what's been there the last
couple of years is nothing.
So, if you guys are
going to put in some docks and
some, um, place
that, uh, concessionaire could, could
come in and do business
that, that I think that would be
a big draw for the
Air Force Base to put back in
there. And then I, I would
love to be a part of that.
What about the bungalows
that uh, that I
think they probably belong
to the Army Corps of Engineers
and they, they have released
them out to other people to run
or are you guys
going to do
something with them? The little
place where people,
the little, I don't know
what you call them bungalows, I
guess, >> Mr.
Chair and Representative
Adobe Bell was the
last
enterprise to run the,
the uh homes
that are on the core property there in
the center of the, of the park.
I don't know what the core
is doing with that. They took over the
enterprise function with those
homes, primarily because
they had to invest some
capital funds to get them
ad a accessible in order for them
to be part of a, a public access
point. But I can
certainly um discuss that
with the quarter manager.
We have a really good uh
relationship with Jonathan
there and follow up with
you and let you know what their plan
is.
>> So, the, my next
question is, uh,
is the stuff down at
Lake, which is also
in my history.
Uh,
sometime back,
the Interstate Stream commission
required everyone to
remove the boat docks out of
lake. And there were
a lot of private individuals
that, that owned the
land or home or
something and they had a little
dock at there. What
is the, what, what's
the plan for the future of
you? Are you, are you guys gonna put
some docks in there where people
can, can
have a little better access
to whatever
they need, Mr. >> Chair and
Representative. So we actually
have the community boat dock program
that there are docks in the water,
uh where uh private
individuals can come together for a
community boat dock. I believe that the
last count, we did an
inspection in April of those
docks. I believe we
had
21
community boat docks
including the 12 shores
boat dock on the south side that
serves that new development.
And so there, there's definitely already
docks in the water. We have a process
and a program for any
other property owners that are interested
in developing boat docks
uh to be able to apply for and
go through the process. So
I don't know if that will be
expanded. I think a lot of
the shoreline area
adjacent to the
um Interstate Stream Commission
area is, is
bought out and those folks
are already in place. But
if there's any additional
that are interested in creating a community
boat dock, which there are
several, uh we have a
process set for that to happen.
>> That that's awesome. These
communities depend on that
for their income. Uh Logan
depends on that lake
conscious when they pulled out
the, the airbase
pulled out, they just died
at Hooverville
and all that
just uh
suffered a lot and I, and
it will make a difference if you
can, you can put in
some improvements there.
Last question,
Oliver Lee
lived in Dog Canyon.
Oh, tell me about the Oliver Lee
State Park.
>> So Mr. Chair and, and
representative Oliver Lee
is one of the jewels of
our State parks in the southeast
region. We're actually
investing. Um
Senator Griggs has given us
year after year appropriations
to invest at Oliver Lee.
We've improved ad a
access, we're improving the visitors
center. We're actually getting a
full design
review to
improve the visitor center, not only
with uh structural
improvements, but also
education and interpretive
uh opportunity for visitors to
learn more about the history of,
of that area in Oliver
Lee. Uh We had a
fire in Dog Canyon
this spring, which was
unique. It was off of the park
property but
um, we responded
to it as well. It was on the
forer property up
in the Dog Canyon area. It
remains a destination, not only
for camping, they get a lot of
off-season visitation.
Our visitation is strong there.
We are working with
um
Holleman as well
as uh BLM
regarding some of the properties where
they allow uh dispersed
camping. That's become somewhat
of an issue of a dump
site on those federal
properties, uh which is
directly adjacent to the
entrance of uh Oliver
Lee Memorial State Park.
So we're, we're doing a lot of work
there. We're making improvements
and, and Senator Gigs
has been a great
supporter in appropriations
for Oliver Lee. So we're, we're making that
money, go to work as well.
>> So Mr. Chairman, that, that
is of great interest to me.
If you will look just
above Dog
Canyon, you'll see Chatfield
Peak. They might have run
around together a little
bit.
Thank you. Thank you,
Mr.
Chair
Center and
develop.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Uh,
last year we had a great uh
visit with
this Committee, went out to the Navajo
Lake and I believe you were there, weren't you
last year? Um
We're trying to do that again for
economic development. This May be the
first you've heard of it, but they're trying to do
go on August 21st.
So, um,
as you know, uh, Mr.
Johnson has spent
many millions of dollars
trying to improve that facility
and he's got a great business going
there. Parking
is a big issue I noticed on your list
and we appreciate that. We've got to
do something there. One of the
things he suggested I want to ask
you about is
any, you know, eight out
of 10 years, the lake isn't
full, maybe
seven out of 10 or six out of
10. I don't know what it is, but
there's an area that's right
next to the marina
that he says
could be grated and
smoothed and graveled for
very little cost,
which would work for
overflow parking during
years when there's not a lot of water in
the lake or at least when it's not
full. Has that
been studied or considered
as far as
overflow parking whenever it's
available?
>> Definitely, Mister
Chair and
Senator
I don't, people are gonna think I
planted that question with you, but
I didn't, I didn't,
we did a
full
comprehensive study of
parking opportunities,
development and
growth for, for, for,
for the Pines side of the marina
there. Uh, Jared has been a
great partner. Uh, they've been, they
were just a few years ago. No,
they were nominated and won
Marina of the year across
the country. Um,
we have a
full
survey and plan
for improving parking,
um, all the way
down to the, to
the area where you're, you're discussing,
which is in that Pine Maine parking
area, but also in the
external areas.
Um, we, we tailored
it down initially, it was
a $26 million
plan and I'm gonna kick
it over to Colleen, she can get in the
specifics. But over the last
few weeks, um,
we've tailored that down to a
much more manageable plan that we
can phase in over time.
With the first phase
being the actual park, uh,
parking area
at the point of access to
the lake. And with that, I'm gonna
let Colleen talk a little bit more about
that and what the cost of that
initial
um
study
was,
>> Mr. Chairman Senator
Neville. Thank you for the questions.
And um yes,
as Toby said, we took on a, a
full assessment uh
looking for as much
parking as we can
to Tofail, facilitate
use of that marina and the
campground and, and recreation
areas around there.
Um We are gonna
look at it in, in kind of a
phased approach because the,
the price ticket
is, is so high. Uh
But we are gonna start
with access improvements
at the, the main
parking lot right next to the
marina. Um,
as well as some a is
improvements to try to
improve traffic
flow, getting to and out of
the boat ramp.
Um
even with phasing,
um and reducing some of
the, the we're going
to put off doing
the additional
lane into the entrance.
That's one of the parts that makes
up the 26 million when
we take that out. It's still about a
$16
million
project. So we'll be
working at, at that
in
maybe $4 million
chunks over the next four or five
years. But we are going
to start with improvements down on
the main
parking lot. >> Ok. Well, it
just seemed like kind of
a no brainer. You could go in there with a
bulldozer and a road grader
and a few loads of gravel. And,
I mean, it May not be that simplistic.
I understand, but it would be
something that could be done
with minimal cost and you could
expand the parking significantly
most years, not every year. Of
course. Uh That
has been a a great
facility as far as drawing
outdoor recreational dollars
into the community. As along with the
river Cottonwood's a great
draw. That's a good
campground. Um
Again, I think
Economic Development Committee is going to try
to get out there. Um August
21st comes to mind
if, if that's needs
to be put on your calendar, put
her down because uh
Representative Gallegos
will be in touch. I'm sure
uh hopefully in the near
future, they just called me last week and
I've talked with Mr.
Johnson about scheduling the date.
So uh
that's, that's the good news.
We, we um
I got, I managed to
talk um
dot into
resurfacing the road from
Aztec to the
lake and
that's just Chipseal,
that's not a permanent fix.
But if you have any
influence that would be useful if
you'd go over and knock on his door and
ask
Secretary Cerna
if he would get
some better. That
whole road needs to be redone.
Ultimately. But that's
an access. What people
don't understand a lot
is that Colorado
is a big client for
the Navajo Lake area
and they come down to Aztec, they
could come into Ignacio
and down that other way. But
that's such a slow road
that they come into Aztec and go
across that. So any
influence you have on getting that road
done, that would be very, very
useful to get help
our outdoor recreational
dollars coming into the
county.
Uh, parking.
They talked about parking structures
and things like that. Are you gonna just
try to expand existing
parking areas or what's the thoughts
there?
>> Mr. Chairman Senator
Neville, we're going to
start with um
existing parking areas.
We did look
into the cost of a parking
structure. The
cost of the structure itself
is so high
and the views
sheed
issues that it will cause
we're not sure that that's the best
investment yet. So we're going to do what we
can with existing areas.
Um and then kind of incrementally
work our way towards the best
solution >> on, on
their busy days. Fourth
of July and Memorial Day and those
kind of dates, the
the waiting
period to get your boat
on and off the lake is just
an untenable
for most people and that
hurts us. Uh People
try it once and they say I don't
want to go back there. So
we want to try to avoid that.
We appreciate your work.
That's big business for
us. And I wanted to say that
publicly. Thanks for
what you do. Try to. Navajo is a big
one for us. But uh
all of that river is a big
draw for San Juan County. Thank you,
Mr. Chair,
>> Mr. Chair and, and
Senator. Just another note we
applied uh with
on RT uh a couple
of years ago and were able to get some
funding uh from
on RT in the, the
Gold King Mine
settlement. Uh And
we're going to build an aquatic
invasive species
uh in Interdiction Center
on the river, uh
which is in the design
plan as well right now. And, and
we're going to be able to hopefully keep
those waters as quality waters
so that the uh anglers
can get in there and catch the fish that
they want to catch. So we're working
with the Department of Game of Fish and the Bureau of
Reclamation on that as
well.
>> Thank you very much. Uh
Next, we're gonna go to represent
Armstrong, please.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank
you for your uh your
presentation. Um
I wanted to know how many
parks, how many State
parks are actually in New
Mexico that you
are in charge
of
>> Mr. Chair and representative.
We have 35 State
parks found in
25 of 33
counties across the State of New
Mexico. >> Thank
you for that. And so Mr.
Chairman and that you said there was
nine that are actually
owned by the State. What
nine are those? So
>> the nine that are owned by
EMD State Parks?
That's, I feel like this
is a test question. I'm gonna try
and do my best
um Coyote Creek
State Park,
uh
Eagle nest, a portion of
it, a portion of eagle
nest.
I have the list somewhere. That's
OK. >> You can, I, I didn't mean to
put you on the spot, Mr. Chairman.
But you, I, I would, I was just curious,
it was just out of curiosity, so
it's fine. But
35
is, that's a lot.
And so I, I
want to talk a little bit
uh Mr. Chairman about the
elephant in the room as far as I'm
concerned and that's the
fees.
Um
First of all, I want to thank you for
not implementing the
first round and for taking a
second look, uh
kudos to you for doing that
and kudos to the people who took the
time to uh to
send comments and, and
take time out of their day to do that.
That that's a lot. And
for government,
you know, you have to watch and you have
to listen and you have to be just
right to timing for that.
So thank you to you
and thank you to the, the people
who actually made those comments.
And so um
when you go back to the drawing
board, I don't know if you've got gone,
I'm sure you have gone back to
some, but people are really
interested that to have 10 days
of camping instead of seven.
I know that's a really,
really big deal
uh for a lot of my constituents,
I don't represent uh
Mr. Chairman Elephant
Butte, but I border Elephant
Butte and, and I just feel
like the people of New Mexico
really want 10 days
of, of camping.
Uh The other part
um
uh the Republican Caucus
did send a letter uh in
opposition to the the fee
structure. So thank you for
listening to that as
well. Um
uh And one of the
questions I have, Mr. Chairman is, do
all the fees collected?
Stay at that park that
they're collected in
>> Mr. Chairman and
Representative? No.
Um
We have parks that
obviously don't generate as much
revenue as Elephant Butte
Navajo
and uh
clo uh and
so those funds are distributed
as revenue back to the
agency to the
parks as as they're
needed. Uh We,
so New Mexico State Parks
is an enterprise agency.
Um The funding model
for us is that 75%
of our operating budget comes
from self generate revenues
only 25%
during certain administrations
under this administration, at least
uh is brought through general
fund about
11 million on average.
And so we don't
have the opportunity to give
Elephant Butte or those other
parks all of their revenue
back because the other parks would have
none. But we know
that small parks, I just came
back from the cabinet in your community,
uh events in
Clovis and Portales
last week. Oasis
State Park is a small State
park in Roosevelt
County,
but we heard loud and clear how
important it is to Clovis
uh and Portalis and
those rural communities,
it doesn't make the money that Elephant
Butte makes, but it doesn't mean
that it shouldn't get some of the money that the
other parks make in
order for it to function.
They're important. These small
small parks are important. If
you have a State park in your county or
your local regional area,
it's critical to
that economy. And
so no, that
those funds generated
at Elephant Butte, don't all go right
back to Elephant Butte. But
I also want to give a little bit of
scale on what we do for parks
like Elephant, but as well as others
right now, we have $19
million in play at Elephant
Butte. There's no
other State park that's had that level
of funding period.
And I'll probably go on the record
in the 91 years.
There's no State park that at
any point in time on
any given day has
had $19 million in
play to improve
it. The Lakeshore
Drive project is an $18
million project that we partnered
with the Bureau of reclamation
on and we
matched the core match
for that fund.
Uh We just started as uh
MS Baker discussed
earlier a $1
million project to improve the
comfort stations. That's
the showers, the restrooms, the heated
water and remove
an old comfort station that was from
the 19 eighties
in order to make way for
capital improvements in the
future. So we
funding comes to these
parks in other ways.
It's not just operating
dollars. There's a
capital funding that come
to these parks in bigger
ways than any operational dollars
would ever do.
>> Thank you for that. I, I
appreciate that more than,
than ever. One of the things
that I'm a little bit concerned about
is that we keep adding State
parks that aren't
revenue driven and we're
dispersing. So it makes,
you know, the revenue for all of the
parks less.
So I hence the probably
the fee increase. Um
But one of the, the,
the
uh
problems that I have is if
we increase fees from
out for out of State, we're going to
hinder some of our tourism
in these areas. And I know, you know,
that I, I know, you know that,
but I just have to point it out,
uh, for, for
the my constituents.
Um, the other
thing
is on the
charging stations at
these parks that you're
considering.
Are you, are you gonna do a
study, are you gonna,
how are you gonna know if it's
feasible to do it
in and at what
parks? And are you
in talks with the rural
electric co ops in those
areas to see if
it's something that's feasible?
>> So I May, uh, kick
this over to Colleen as well.
However, um, so we're
working with the statewide
approved EV
plan, right? So we're not
operating outside of
that if there's any, uh,
CF I federal grant money,
we're working through NM dot
So that anything that we apply
for as far as funding goes
is consistent with the statewide
approved EV plan.
Uh, we're not cowboying
that on our own. We're actually
working through our
energy office, the Energy Conservation
and Management division, which is part
of EMD um
as well as
NMOT
in order to, to make sure that we are
contributing to the approved plan
for electric vehicle, the electric
vehicle charging
network across
the State. It's important
to note that we have two ev
chargers within the State
park system currently,
one just off of
Pruitt at Bluewater Lake State
Park off I 41
at Kahi Lake State Park just
off I 25 south of Elephant
Butte. Uh And
so that has been
uh our first phase of
evs and they've been in for a
while. And so we
continue to work within the
infrastructure that I
believe the legislature has had
input on in order
to contribute to the EV action
plan. >> Ok. Thank you
for that. Yes, I was, I
was just curious about that.
So, what it, what part
is your most visited
and most revenue generated,
>> Mr. Chair and
Representative, you know the
answer, it's Elephant
Butte. Elephant Butte Lake
serves over a million visitors
each year on average. Uh
They also uh produce
a similar income
in, in self generated revenue.
Um depending
on drought, you know, things
change in revenue and visitation.
But Elephant Butte and Navajo
Lake. Navajo Lake is number
two. we
switch off between
Lake and Kayo Lake
and then little Cimarron
Canyon in Colfax
counties is a big puncher.
Uh But because Oklahoma
and Texas love them shade trees.
Cimarron does really well.
Those are our top five
on average year after year,
most visited State
parks. >> Thank you for that. And
what did you say
of >> a million visitors?
And uh the revenue
is right at about a million, but I
I'd have to get that number
more specific for you.
Representative, >> thank you so much.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And so the
the dollar amount of the 18
million that you were
talking about is that federal
or State dollars,
>> Mr. Chair and representative,
that's a mix of federal and
State. We have core
funding as part of the State match
and the larger Majority is
the federal portion of that
match. >> Ok. Thank you so
much.
Thank you for what you do
and you know, let's keep
our
middle and low income
families in,
in check
when we talk about raising
fees for
a State for State parks
and our
veterans.
Uh I do represent the
veterans home
in Tier C. So
that's a big
uh driving
factor. They use elephant,
but for all kinds
of, of
uh mental
uh stabilization
and uh behavioral health
issues. And we really
want to keep it open and
accessible to New Mexicans
uh and keep our tourism
also going. So, thank you so
much for your, all your
input and your information. Appreciate
it. >> Thank you, Mr. Chair and
representative. Thank you. I just will add
that in our second round
of uh information sessions
that we had with the public. We did the first
round where we did 12
and then we did five more after
uh we vacated the
notice of rulemaking uh as you
indicated earlier. Um
We went back to Elephant but, and
we met with that community and
I will tell you this because I'm proud of
it. They applauded us
uh for what we did and how we
handled it and the fact
that a State agency was
out there with them on the
ground, taking their
uh public
sentiment and then
reflecting it
in the changes that were made.
And so I, I, you know, I've, I've,
I've done this for a long time and we were
happy that the, the, the,
the community from Elphin
view as well as other communities across the
State engaged that
process passionately
and constructively
and better informed our decision
making as we continue
to engage the notice of rulemaking
moving forward.
>> Thank you for that. I, I once
again, we appreciate that so
much and, and the
people that actually
made the comments and took
the time out of their day to,
to uh
ensure that you guys get down
there and listen to them.
So thank
you
uh Representative
Baca,
>> thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank
you for your presentation.
Um
I think this is an important area.
If there's any good that came out of
the pandemic, it was
the fact that it forced
as much of the State and the
world was clo or the country was
closed. It
provided an opportunity for
families to go out there
um and explore
our State.
I think that if we spent
more time
with our families
are able to spend more time
from behind these
screens and getting
out into our beautiful land
of enchantment, that's what we get
to from that.
We would have less problems,
we would have more
uh or fewer issues
as far as with our families
and some of the stuff that we have
uh with our families and with our
schools. So, Mr.
Chairman, my question is going to be
this,
what kind of advertising
are you guys doing
to highlight
these uh
State parks?
And uh
what kind of other agencies
are you kind of connecting
with to make
sure that we get the word out
because as
I, as I see,
you know, many of the parts
that were mentioned here, I've never
heard of. And I'm
a, you know, like 1/5 or sixth
generation New Mexican.
So Mr. Chair,
please, if you'd answer that
>> Mr. Chairman and, and uh
representative, thank you.
So we do have a small
marketing team. Uh We
have two people that uh comprise
our graphic design and our, our
marketing manager. Uh
We also
leverage our relationships with
all of the different uh co
managers that we have.
We work with the P I Os
from the Bureau of Reclamation.
Um For example,
but more importantly, we work
with our New Mexico uh Tourism
Department. We're in the co the
co op program with them
which leverages every dollar
we have to $3 that they
can bring in. Uh So
we do uh participate
with the New Mexico true as well as the
other uh tourism uh
programs. We
work with the New Mexico Department of Game and
Fish so that we can
uh communicate
State parks to all of the
anglers and hunters
that they have as part of their stakeholder
community. So we do a lot
of leveraging. Um But,
but I will tell you representative, our
marketing
budget when you
look at other
agencies is not
what it should be. And
um we have asked for those
increases in operating
and, and since I've been
director, we have that
ask for the fy 26
that you all will see. Um
We also are engaged in the
beautification uh initiative
that the governor's office is undertaken
and we want to be able to better
contribute to that beautification
model. Uh not
only from cleaning
State parks but from marketing
of State parks. And so
we are always trying to expand
our marketing. We do a lot of
major marketing in Las
Cruces and Las Vegas,
but we also still buy small
radio, small market radio
in Clayton and Raton
and Las Vegas. Uh So
we're, we're, we're trying to do as much
as we can with
what we have. But part
of the fee increase funding
that we, we are are working
towards will be to
improve our operation. Uh
moving forward and better
support things like our
marketing program. I hope
all of you are part of our social media,
our Instagram page. Uh
It's, it's uh I
if you're not,
please become a follower,
I think you'll learn a lot about our State
parks. Uh We highlight
staff, we highlight projects, we
highlight people, we highlight
places uh through our
social media feeds. So
we also uh with our
central reservation contractor,
Reserve America known
as Aspira, we
leverage their marketing
funds uh in order
to get all of our messages
pushed to every
user of Reserve
America. That's a New
Mexico user or
non-resident user of New
Mexico State Parks
and So we're doing as much and
we're doing a lot, maybe not
enough.
But the
pandemic gave us an opportunity
to create generational
interest. And if
we don't create generational
interest, uh my job
security is probably gonna go
down. Uh
We, we
know that formative experiences
in State parks drive
generational interest
through the course of years.
Um
Representative Baca, you probably
remember where you caught your first
fish
or where
uh Senator Munoz built his
first campfire.
Representative de La
Cruz
operated his first boat.
Those are the experiences that
continue to drive
us to do those
things and then we pass that on to
generations. So we
know that and we want to bring more people
to New Mexico State Park so we can continue
that tradition
>> and, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, that actually
brings me to my next point.
So what types of activities
have you done to interact with
our youth, our young
people, our schools,
our summer youth programs. Because
as we're talking about this,
those are fond
memories before we had all this
other stuff, my
dad would load us all up in the truck, we'd
go out there, we'd visit different
places, we fished.
So my question
is, what
types of activities, what types
of cooperation with our schools?
You talked about the military
bases and God bless them.
We have, you know, a few
military base bases,
but every
county
has schools in it. So
what types of things are we doing to
encourage our student, our,
our young people to get
connected with nature, to get
out there and get off
their screens,
get out and, and
explore and fish and those
types of things, Mister
Trim. >> Um
Mr. Chair and Representative,
thank you again, people are going to think these
questions are, are, are planted
but they're not.
We have a kids and parks program
that uh pays
for school buses and school
drivers to bring students to their
State parks. Uh
Last year, we awarded
48 grants.
Uh We have 89 school districts.
Uh So 48 is, is not
quite where we want to
get, but we constantly
are promoting our kids and parks
programs. I serve as a
school board member in the POA Valley
school district. And so when
I'm in that forum, I'm
constantly expressing to the school
districts that there are opportunities
that will take the cost away
from their operating budget.
Uh like the kids and parts
program. Uh Another
good example is we uh
participated in the National
Girls Love State Parks
Program. We're in our third
year and it's growing year after
year, it used to be tens.
Now we're in the hundreds where we
bring girl scout troops out
to State parks. We
provide education, interpretation
activities, fishing
clinics, et cetera.
Uh We have a learned a camp
program that
uh was
somewhat hampered. It needs to
get kind of a little bit of momentum
under it after the pandemic
where we had donations
of camping gear and we would bring
families for a lot of
people. Camping uh is
intimidating if you've
never done it. You don't know whether you
can make a fire if you know how to make
a fire that learn to
camp program is a program
that will bring the equipment
and all we have to do is have the family
show up and we show
them how to do that. Uh
So we have several, we haven't,
we have over seven. You know,
I, I don't have my annual report in front of me
right now. I can share that with your
representative, uh, after
this 7000
hours of interpretive and
educational response that
we provide from
raptors to,
um, myths about
Bigfoot and, uh,
wolves and
predators. Anything
that you can think of that would draw
people into that interpretative and
education space and
this isn't just kids, it's kids
and their families. Uh We
have a tremendous interpretive education
program across the State. We
partner with those
uh education, uh higher
education uh opportunities
as well in order to bring
in specialized interpretive
education into State
parks.
>> And, and thank you. And I'm gonna
just stop with this
comment. See what
you've described to me
is the need why we need
more advertising and not
just on your traditional radio
spots because whether
it be streaming, whether it
be other types
of, because
I think as we're saying, if we
had more opportunities to
learn how a kid can,
can bait a hook or tie a
line, I could probably enjoy
my fish a little bit better than,
you know, working on my three kids getting
their lines in the water. But
I think because we will touch
base offline, but I do think
that we can, we need to get the word out
more. I do think that
we need to connect with our, our
schools and our and our summer
programs to get
kids and families most
importantly, to spend
time together,
interact uh
and really take advantage of what
we offer. Thank you, Mr.
Chair >> and Mr.
Chair. If I can have one more comment on
that, uh Representative, you know, one
of the things, speaking of our
fees, as Representative
Armstrong provided was
one of the approaches that we took was
to make day use free
for New Mexicans so
that there would never be a financial
burden for those
folks to be able to go on and experience their
State parks, identify their State
parks and return back
to them. There's still a modified
version of that in our proposal,
uh which would enable
free access for New
Mexicans uh from
outside of the peak season.
Uh We, so we adjusted that
uh because obviously during the season,
we have our hands full. Uh
but it also would reduce
our revenue loss
but continue to
engage uh families
and Children and
anyone else who wants to become
familiar with the State parks
to not have a financial
barrier to getting in their State parks.
So that was another strategy that
we hope we, we'll
be able to see through. So
we can again improve that
generational interest in outdoor recreation
and State parks as well as
BLM for service State
lands. We're blessed
with public land in New Mexico. And
so whether they can build a, a
campfire on a State land
property or a State park.
I prefer State park.
Uh But uh we're hoping
to grow that moving
forward,
>> it costs more to park at a
concert than it does to go to the State
park. Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you also, and I know
that it's late and
you've had a lot of discussion. I just
have a few things
on, on
your page 12 where you have
the framework plan.
Uh What was done at
Eagle Nest Lake? Go
ahead,
>> Mr. Chairman Senator
Gonzalez.
So we went through a a
planning process to
update the park management
plan. And as part of that
process alongside it, we
developed what's called a framework
plan, which is a
initial level design
document that actually starts
looking at how we
put the goals of the management
plan on the
ground. And part of
that was the campground
improvements that we're actually
under construction right now, which
is a new comfort station
on upgrades to the existing
campground at Marina Way,
but it also includes a
new campground uh
that we will be looking for
funding for in the next few
years. Uh That's
um along the shore a
little further south
as well as some upgrades
to the boat docks
and uh boat ramps and boat
docks and some of
the other day recreation
areas. So those plans
are available. Um
The, the management plan is on our
website, the framework plan you
can contact us and we can provide
a copy. It's a large document,
but it actually starts to take
the management plan goals
and put it on the ground
um at a beginning level
design so that we can seek
funding
>> very well. Thank you. Um
Several years back,
um The dam part was
still manually
done. So
has that been automated
now or
still?
>> Um Mr. Chair and
Senator Gonzalez.
So that's managed by
the Department of Game of
Fish and the ISC,
we don't really have any involvement
in the dam. I I couldn't give you an update
on that, but I could certainly reach out
to them to see if they could provide
one. That
side of the lake is, is, is
not uh technically part of
the property that we are uh
within our jurisdiction of
administration and operation.
Um But we know that they continue
to release
water effectively down
the Cimarron, both for
recreation and irrigation.
>> Yeah. Uh Thank
you. Um I
believe it was last
year that on the
Committee,
we visited Story
Lake and
at that time,
uh the planning there
was a
training center
for hotshot
firefighters.
So uh is
that part
of
your involvement or that's
completely separate?
Um >> Mr. Chair and, and
Senator Gonzalez. So
that is, that's a,
it's both.
So we own the property that
the, the hotshots will
actually be, the facilities
will be built on. But
the funding and the project
management is coming from the
State Forestry Division
So uh Forrester mccarthy
is leading up that project
and it is underway. Uh
We are a, a uh
co managing partner for
that. So we provide feedback on
how that property is gonna
be developed. Um And how
the access with roads
will not detract from the outdoor
recreation environment as well as
those visitors who are entering the park
right now, they're in the design
phase. Um So they're
moving forward with that project
that will happen
on uh the property
which is known as Story
Lake.
>> And uh earlier on your
presentation,
Mr. Chairman, you
mentioned
housing
for the part of
recruitment and
retention of
employees.
So do you mean
housing right on the site
or would be separate from
properties of the State
park? >> So Mr. Chair and Senator
Gonzalez, we have both. So we
have State residents
housing within the
State park or
adjacent properties
of which we manage as part of the
State park. Uh So
for example, when people go
to Hern and Elva,
if you cruise through the park,
especially the Willow Creek area,
you might not see where the houses
are, but there's an official
access road that you go up and
around and you get into the
housing development. There. Many
of these houses are manufactured
homes that have uh
uh lived well past their
life. Some of them are site built.
Some of them are historic
uh the home at Cowy Creek, for
example, is a historic
Adobe home that we can't do much
with. And so we've just
maintained it as a historic
property, but we
have 45 of those
residents uh scattered
throughout. But for example,
at the Eagle Nest through the
management and framework plan
process, we identified
the need to develop between
three and five housing
opportunities and
in cooperation with the Department of Game
and Fish because they along
with us have a hard
time uh recruiting
and retaining people in the Moreno
Valley because it's a resort
area. Uh There's not
much housing for rent.
If it is, it's an Airbnb and
it's 3 $400 a
night. Uh There's very
limited housing in the Moreno Valley
which we hope
to improve our recruitment and
retention by having housing
um on the State
park property at the south
end where the old windmill
was at to give you a little bit of
perspective. If we didn't
have that type of housing in some of the
State parks, it'd be even
more difficult to recruit and
retain. >> Ok.
Very well. The last
part of Mr. Chairman is
um and uh going
to uh Representative
Baca's thought on
the, you know,
uh
I have been in
dialogue with a, with the Governor
for probably 23
years, especially
in her part and her
interest on the
outdoor education.
And uh what,
you know, I envision, you
know, if you want to have
that full comprehensive
of for New Mexico
to New Mexico
is to develop a
curriculum that
would be scope and sequence
K through 12.
And this would be
bringing in
and at the same time
as you mentioned, all the different
opportunities,
different trails, different State
parks, you know, would
fit right, perfect into
that. Now,
one of the parts that I
have mentioned several
times is
when I was in school,
I wanted to be in
school and
we need to have that paradigm
shift to where, you
know, we go back to. We,
we talk about high absentee,
we talk about, you know,
how can we have our students
born to really
getting involved to,
to being into that
part of, you know, the
attendance.
And uh there was
that
program that was done by one
of the Albuquerque public school
teachers in the fifth grade
where he took the kids for like
15 days
to the Rio
Grande and they
studied everything that you can think
of from water birds and the
whole thing. And
my point to this is
that um during
that time,
the attendance was 98
to 100%
then they went back to the
classroom and the
attendance dropped to like
80%.
So, you know, it
works and we
know it, we know we just need to
have that
solid,
you know, of
continuation into a
curriculum and
it will happen, you know, things
take time. But, you know,
that would be something solid
that would be to
your part. And
the last part of that I
would end up with
is um we always
talk about funding and
we always need more funding
and more
and thinking out of the
box
is, uh I think something
that would be really, really
good and I think it's
wide open and this would take a
lot of work also with our
congressional group
is how can
we incorporate
special,
the firefighting
to help New
Mexico?
You know, and as you mentioned, the
hotshot thing, but that's only
one and
being, you know,
with, you
know, with the, with the
State parks involvement
and also is
protecting our water.
You know, that's very very
important.
So with that all in Mr.
Chairman and thank you, thank you both
for your presentation. >> Uh
Mr. Chairman and and Senator
Gonzale just a couple of
follow-ups. So we do have a Curri
curriculum guide that
we think we can expand
in the way that you just
explained. We have the Bosk
Education guide, which I, I believe
Representative Small is well aware of as
well as Senator Steinborn,
uh that we use in the Las Cruces
and uh uh Rio Grande
Nature Center State Park at Messia
Valley Bosca State Park
down in La Mesa, as
well as in Albuquerque
at Rio Grande Nature Center
State Park. We also
recognize that there's a new opportunity
that through your all through the
legislative support
uh Initi initiated
a uh outdoor
education
branch of the Public
Education Department. It's a couple
of positions we
are starting to engage
with with that portion of
ped in order to
leverage what we can provide
to them uh in order to
develop a statewide model.
But also what has
actually gained more traction in
bringing kids into State
parks um
over Legislation
that you all had a say in
was the Wild Friend Citizen
Science Legislation that you all just
passed. Uh We have
became uh we have become
active Members of that
citizen science group and
we are already hosting
citizen science projects
across State parks. In fact,
we're the only agency who has
stepped forward to be able to host
those. Uh It is a
collaborative effort uh The State
Land Office, uh the Wild
Friends um State
Parks. We're bringing
back citizen science to
help bring people
into the fold of being in the outdoors
as well as creating
citizen science data that
can help us where we don't have the
resources to run bird
surveys. And so we're,
we're, we're, we're, I hope that as you said,
we can continue to use these
strategies uh
Senator to
improve the engagement
of youth and communities
in their State parks and their public
lands. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Very well. Thank
you.
>> No,
thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank
you both for the presentation.
Um Briefly,
uh the
the school piece is,
is right on.
Um maybe directly
we can capture, there's
other states are certifying
outdoor preschools
and sort of taking
some of those next steps as
Senator Gonzalez is
outlining.
Um And really
also to echo the senator's
comments around
the firefighting, you know,
we May need to have more
hotshot crews. You
know, the the State has
done the work
with the two initial
crews. It May be
warranted to expand that
in particular to have that
year-round stewardship
component. Thank you
for State parks to be
so willing to be that sort of
first partner, the Citizen
Science. Also, Mr.
Chair, just thank you for
the work uh with
the feasibility
studies for uh
Broad Canyon State
Park
um on
the fee structure
I recall several years
ago, constituents
who are very frustrated
because there were uh
the camping spots
at um and I
believe it is at Pera, right?
So not quite up at the, but Pera,
it's a beautiful place.
Uh There were out
of, out of State
residents
who were like,
hey, this is a great deal,
best deal in town.
I'm gonna buy up all
of these camping spots
and so local,
uh in this case, my
constituents were unable
to go and utilize
those. Have you
seen some of that
anecdotally, at least?
And where do we
rank if you were to sort of
take Colorado,
Texas,
Arizona, their
State parks? What's our out of
State fee structure?
>> So, Mr. Chair and Representative
Small as far
as uh the
turnover of sites and
that goes back to what Representative
Armstrong was discussing and
it's something that we engaged in the notice of
rulemaking right
now. And the rule is
that 14 out of 20
days um
is, is your limit after that,
you have to leave that park. A
lot of people, for example, in,
in the middle of Rio Grande
will do that 14 day
stay um at
Elephant Butte and then make their
reservation for Cavallo so that they can
leave the park and then come back.
And there's a constant
cycle of that, that we
experience commonly throughout
State parks because
many people have
identified that you can live
in a State park
and it's not necessarily
for outdoor recreation. And that's been
some of the issues that we've had to manage
for is
those annual camping passes
and those term limits or State
limits have become
more of a residential pass
to live in the State.
Long term.
Right now, there's an if
and this is any, anything, anyone,
any if anyone's
interested, go to
youtube and type New
Mexico State Park's camping
pass. There's
entire channels, literally
channels of youtube
videos telling people
how you could live in New Mexico State
Parks for less than $2 a
day.
Um So there are those
challenges that
um those sites can be
tied up. What we
heard when we went out to the public
uh on those information
sessions as was discussed
by Representative Armstrong
was that there was an interest to
have more rotation
from those sites so
that more of us could make
reservations or show
up on a first come
first term basis
without being worried
that they're being taken for long periods of
time. We adjusted
the 14 out of
20 to 7 out of
20
we, we did get
positive uh
feedback in the second round of
information sessions, but
there was still some concern that
we've heard. As Representative
Armstrong said that
well, when we do a family
reunion, we only get to do it once
a year and we try and do it for
two weeks. Can you make an
accommodation there?
And so we're
in that process of review.
Is it seven? Is it
10? We'll still
look at that. But
broadly, we had
a lot of folks applaud
the fact that we went from 14
to 7 during the
peak season,
anywhere outside of the peak
season, it would still
be 14 out of 20 at
Elephant Butte or any other State
Park. And so we,
we felt that that was a good strategy
to deal with peak season issues
so that everyone
has an opportunity
to get uh
their favorite site, whatever
that May be. And
so we do have those issues
uh with those annual camping
passes as well.
And so we're trying to develop
those rules to be sensitive
to those interests of rotation,
but also to those people who are
committed to being there longer than seven
days. >> Thank you.
Thank you very much uh director
and I really appreciate
the nuance that goes to what
Representative Armstrong was raising.
And I think that
that sense of collaboration
and taking
challenges and making
progress while really hearing
from folks is very helpful.
Um
The uh
and, and, and I
think it's, it's always gonna
be a balance because we want
folks to look at New
Mexico as a
good deal from out of State.
We just don't want to be
like the bargain
basement deal, particularly
when, as you outline here,
we've got to continue to
make investments to make sure
that we're
upholding, you know,
the sort of the top
notch topnotch
quality of our lands and
waters and meeting
a big stewardship challenge.
And I encourage you to
for sure,
continue uh
balancing interest,
balancing feedback.
But um
yeah, to push forward
in, in your mission,
and I think what we see here today,
which is State parks
continuing to really
be proud and
be very positive about what
the future holds where
we're a good deal for out of State
folks. We're not that bargain
basement deal. Uh
and we're the best
deal for New Mexicans.
You know, I, I frankly love
the idea, Mr. Chair, the
New Mexicans for the day.
You go to your State park
and you're able to go
free of charge
and how do we make those
memories as you accurately
outlined? It's
by that being
something that is
the easy to do,
rewarding with a wonderful
environment. And
um obviously we've got to
pay for it and I just
applaud the work that you all are
doing and I think you
hear a lot of
really across the board
support and interest to continue
forward. Thank you, Mr.
Chair,
>> Representative
Lujan.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate the
time. So your
questions were elaborated
on especially the park fees and thank
you for all the time you've
taken uh to
um address those, those
issues. I, I too
have heard from
constituents and concerns
Um but I will go to your
recreation um
and uh
the outdoor recreation and
the recreation impact
to our parks.
What I do you have a cost
of the of the impact to our
parks due to the expanded
recreation. We
have
Mr. Chair, >> Mister
Chair and representative,
the cost of increased
visitation
or
>> the impact of use of
the parks and what you have to
do
to triage
those, those places
as Mr. Mr.
Chair. >> Thank you,
Mr. Chair and Representative Lujan.
So
maybe a little bit of background uh
before the pandemic, the
State parks division averaged
about 4.5 million
visitors a year.
Um which at that point, we
thought was pretty impressive.
Uh After 2021
when State parks were reopened uh
to normal use,
we have now served over 5
million visitors on average. So
we, we saw a tremendous
increase and it's average
now over three years,
uh one of those years was almost
at 5.3 million
visitors. So there is
definitely uh an
impact on higher visitation
and interest, which is good. That's what
we want. We want people to, to
enjoy their State parks, but
the operating cost to serve
more people go up.
Um The the
impact on the
resource, cultural
and natural resources
um is something that we have to
take into consideration as you see in
many national parks, they've
gone to a carrying capacity model,
which is not what we want
to have to go to. And so we want to
better manage the
resources before we get to that
because we never want to put a gate
up for someone
to say we're
tapped out, you can't come in.
But there is, there is a
balance in dealing
with more visitation and more
interest, not only
financially but also
to the cultural and natural landscapes
that we our
mission to serve. So
there's definitely an impact in
that. However, the visitation
impact across the economy of
the State of New Mexico is
positive because we
have more people on the road
investing on their pathway
from Albuquerque to Elephant Butte
or from Elephant Butte down to Pancho
Villa. Uh That's
good, but there is a
very sensitive balance that we
have to manage for and have the
resources to do it. Well,
many of you have seen in my
prior presentations in past
years, we offer
much of what a county or
municipality offers. We
have our own law enforcement. We have 80
law enforcement officers, we
have our own plant and water and
wastewater operators.
Um We have our own vehicle
and fleet managers,
everything that you would see
in that offering we have
to manage for as a division,
we have our own trash trucks, we do our own
trash service.
Um And so there
is definitely an impact when we have
more solid waste, more dump
station or RV, waste
that we have to manage for.
So um you know the whole
building and we will come,
they're coming and we need
to be able to serve them well.
And I'll just say this, uh, maybe
out of turn and I, I apologize,
but we do a really good
job in the State of New Mexico
inviting people to enjoy the
outdoors. And we do a
really bad job of providing
the backside of literally
the backside of outdoor
recreation, solid
waste, trash
dump stations.
You know, at one time, we used to have dump
stations at every rest
area. So when you're
on a highway and by way, in the State
of New Mexico, you
knew that after camping,
you were going to be able to pull up to a rest
area and dump your RV, dump station
waste responsibly.
Those are no longer
the Majority of dump stations
provided in the State of New Mexico are
provided by the New Mexico State Parks
division. We have 23
dump stations.
You don't see them anywhere else.
Those dump stations are now averaging
between
750,001
$0.5 million to
develop. Um
We can't be the only
solution to provide
for solid waste
and liquid waste,
blackwater and gray
water in our
State. So their representative
is, is an unintended
consequence of
visitation and destination
marketing that we're not serving.
Well, in my opinion, Mr. >> Chair, I
bring this up because this is a question
I brought up when we initially gave
these huge investments for
this purpose to begin
with. And what I was met
with in response to that
to a two point
$4 billion
economic development
industry was that we
were going to have
other advocate groups
and other and others coming
in to help us with this
lift. Has that been happening?
Mr. Chair,
>> Mr. Chair and representative
from my, from the
perspective of State
parks, we are
serving our needs to
the public. I don't
know what's being done outside of
that. Um But we
serve, you know, we want
people to be stewards and be
responsible for their waste.
And so one of the fee
uh
implementations that we
placed was for anyone
who is coming from outside
of the State park to
use the dump station, that there would be a
$10 fee uh that
never existed uh because
we feel that they need to pay into the
system in order for the system
to benefit everyone. Um
Unfortunately, when you're in
areas like uh as
Senator Campos knows
518 coming out of the
Santa Fe National Forest,
um people stop at Story
Lake simply because they know
that's the only responsible
way they can
dump their RV
sta uh dump station
waste and it, it
overwhelmed the system and we had
to reinvest
half a million dollars
to make it accommodate the
use that was happening. So
that is definitely a consequence
of increased visitation and marketing.
Thank >> you. I just like to end
with, with that because I don't want to take up
too much time. I'd like to a fuller
information piece on, on
those consequences,
what it's costing our State
and where we can maybe even look
to shift some of those costs because
that's what I was told because
this was bound to
happen. And I don't
know that we're completely balancing it
when I go into my Hyde
Park in Santa
Fe, uh for,
and I'm going up deep
into uh hikes and I'm
cleaning up and
bringing back garbage
from the trails. I
don't see, I see
that there are some uh consequences
and even with the efforts
we have, it's not being the,
the effects of what's happening
aren't being met. Thank
you. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chair and Representative Lujan. We're
also working with uh
Representative Castellano
in San Miguel County in Pecos
Canyon. Uh because
there's no services in the Canyon,
it's 17 miles removed from the
village of Pecos. And so what
we find there as
Senator Munoz found in Navajo
on the San Juan River one day
is just um
encampments of
trash where
people know that State parks is
gonna find it and probably do something
to, to deal with it.
And um you know that, that,
that definitely happens across,
especially when you have these large
public land, uh
tracts of land
where there is no amenities
for them. It finds
its way where they feel people
will be responsible and take care of it.
We're happy to do that, but
it certainly detracts from our primary
mission of serving those State parks. So
thank you for that.
>> You're not supposed to wrap me
out.
>> You, you improved
Mr. Chair, you improved
uh the the
the habitat at San
Juan River. >> So
there's a homeless encampment there and
we were fishing, right? And they
pretty much were, there
was a lot of excitement when we drove
by and rode by in the
boat and could
tell what it was. >> Well, Mr. Chair,
if you had not seen it from the river
perspective. We
never would have seen it from the roadway. And
so thank you for sharing that information with
us. >> We're gonna have
a hard stop at 345
and I have three people on the list. Center
woods and pedigree.
Just >> a quick question.
>> Where are you with
your fee increases?
Have you settled on an
amount? Have you
done your public comment?
Are we, are we
there? Uh,
I know that there's been
several comments about it
but I didn't get that
part in my
head,
>> Mr. Chair and, and Senator
Woods. First of all, thank you for attending one
of our public sessions in
Tucumcari. Um
We have gone through the second
phase of information
sessions with the public. We're not
going to engage the
notice of rulemaking process. We
will file in the
New Mexico register for
July 30th for that
publication. We will then
open the 30 day comment
Session through the month of August
and then we will have the uh
actual required mandated
administrative rule hearing
uh in Santa Fe in
September. Um But
there is still some
movement happening in the
last revisions that were
made, for example, the stay
limits uh is one of
them um that we're
still under review but will
definitely be in place.
Uh By the time we go into the comment
period,
>> that's what I wanted to know. Mr.
Chair is,
is
many of my constituents are
asking me about that.
So I I
want,
you know to advertise
when that final rule,
when the final coms
are. Thank you, Mr.
Chair
>> represent
Pra
>> Thank you, Chairman. Thank you
director. Thank you.
Uh I'm gonna get this
right.
Um
Bureau Chief, thank
you for being here.
Um
So I'm
gonna
bring all this together with
one question at the very end and it's
not gonna take that long. I
promise
my first statement
against
uh well,
refering small house to say
I hate day use.
So um
when the Pecos
River,
the Pecos went
to deus areas and
took away so many of our
campgrounds that just
crushed from
a standpoint.
Mm A
couple of things that you can
answer all together.
What do you think our
percentage of out of State
versus in-state is in
high peak area?
Um
When I look
at the increases that
just in the short period that
I've been here, this will be
uh next year will be my six
Session.
Um
I've watched social services
across the State to skyrocket
the amount of money we put to
that is
phenomenal.
I don't see with,
with what we're
bringing from an oil and gas
revenue standpoint.
Why we can't
direct some of that
to where
it
helps to offset
some of the costs
to the service
that you provide
and why we have to take
that from
a overall
stamp from a from
a cost to the end user.
Because when
I first started camping,
um I couldn't
afford the pot with the
PM to
cook. And so
from an overall standpoint,
there's a lot of people that go camping
because, and,
and they start with, you
know, just a backpack and
then they end up with a backpack
and they end up with a sleeping
bag and then they end up with
all the different pieces and they
grow into, to
uh,
trailers that they get to
live in.
So I would think that
that there's a way that we could
look at this from a social
services standpoint.
We with the increases that we're
doing on so many other things
uh mental health,
um we ought to be able
to apply that. And I'd
like for your answer
on, on at
how you respond to
this to also
include how
much effort
your department
director put into
determining the
value of quality of
life versus
the value of money coming
to your
services instead of
us as a State
helping and providing the
service
under the State
parks
insignia. Thank you.
Thank you, Chairman
>> Mr. Chair and uh
representative. Thank you.
So I'll take the first one as
far as um I,
I totally agree. New Mexico
State Parks are an essential
service. We're
not marginal.
We learned during the pandemic
when we were closed
that people's quality of life,
their expectation to be able to
access their State parks
was their number one priority. At that
period of time,
I'll be out of bounds and telling you why
I don't why we're always asking
for money and
not getting more support.
The 7525 funding
model has been effective
for us for
longer than 26 years that I've been
around. There's always
been an intention that we will
generate our own revenue.
Um There are other State systems,
State park systems that
subsidize State parks fully
and there are no fees
but not at 30
million.
As you can imagine.
Um Part of
the fee discussion that
we had that's been referenced
several times throughout today's
discussion is if
you go and access
our uh sunshine
portal and you look at
Fy 10 through Fy
24
and you look at our general
funding for
that period of time, we have
lost general fund
in that course of
time.
We compared like agencies like
game and fish and
others. In that scenario,
we're the only agency and I
can share that portion of our presentation
with you after the
fact that has not
improved that position moving
forward.
So passing on the
cost to users in a user
pay, user benefit model has
been part of
the, the model that we've lived
with and that's the model that we care
uh that we carry right now.
And so that
fee increase
is built off of that model.
If there's more subsidies
uh that were to come through or
some supplanting of
funds, I I would
leave that to, to the
folks around this table to identify
whether or not that's realistic or
not. But I see New
Mexico State parks and many
do in these public sessions.
We had over 500 people
attend and over 1000 written
comments.
Um
People
came out and expressed
how important these parts
are to them as part
of their life. It's
hard to measure quality of life,
but I'll tell you what we are doing.
We are currently in
communication with the New Mexico
State University Arrowhead
Center. We're
going to partner with
them uh
through an Intergovernmental
Agreement to
develop what I think
will be the first ever
large scale comprehensive
economic study on the value
and impacts of State parks in
our State
that's undergo that. I hope
to be here next year to share that
with you so that we can really
talk about the,
the meat and potatoes of what
State parks means to this, this
State and whether or not we're
being adequately supported as
we currently see
it
uh on your, on your last
one, prescription
trails,
they're part of the
opportunities that medical
professionals have to
assign people to lower their blood pressure
and other ailments.
Uh And we're part of that,
there's more and more
movement towards medical
professionals assigning
prescriptive
opportunities in the outdoors
for people to improve their well
being. Uh Those
are the things that we contribute to and we know
that I, I couldn't tell
you how much we can measure
that and I don't know that we can get
the information of people who get that
prescription,
but we know that we're part of
it. And so
the parting statement I will say is
I believe, and I think as
you do that State
parks are an essential
service to New Mexicans
and visitors of this State.
And I would be
happy to
know that we're gonna improve how we
support an essential service with more
funding
it.
>> Yep.
Representative.
Yeah,
sure
time is the only thing we can't buy in
our life, >> Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
Thank you for going out of bounds
because I think that's information
we all needed to hear. And I
think that um
when we look at how
stressed your department
is and um
the impact on those
communities that work next
to the State parks,
in particular Elephant Butte
when it swells into this large
community and how
they're able to
um to really manage
it is really the issue. So I would
really urge
um this
body to look at how we
fund that.
And um, you're
absolutely right, those
issues that were happening with,
with Elephant Butte, the city
were the sewer system and
the trash system and those
were the overflow problems
that they were having and
so we need to uh
dedicate ourselves to fully
funding the State parks
because you have
grown exponentially
and um and it
does harm our communities
that are there because they cannot
then handle that overflow.
So, thank you for what you've done.
But most importantly, thank
you for listening to
those folks at Elephant Butte who
are really screaming and
I, I really commend you for jumping
in there and, and solving some
of these issues. Thank
you.
>> You know, I just,
it doesn't make sense to me and I'm
looking at your rate fees, right?
That, that people have push back
for New Mexico residents to be
for free.
Right?
It was $5 before and
then they made it fee.
You raise the primitive camping
fees and in developed
camping and
utilities, water and electric.
Those are natural costs that
increase. Right?
And, and doing the math in the,
in the sheet 5
million visitors, right?
And you only had
4.7 of
income that tells
you right. Your upside down
in, in Elephant Butte is
very interesting to me
because out of the 1 million
visitors, right?
You lost
$21,000
in that in
year, over year, right?
So, I mean, out of the million
visitors, you're not even getting a
dollar out of their pocket. Out of the
5 million, you're not even
giving a dollar out of their pocket.
Right.
I don't know what a big gulp cost.
99 cents. But a
pack of gums, a buck
10 now. Right. And you're
not even getting a dollar just to
break even. And then they probably
come to you and they complain that
all the restroom stink. We're out of
toilet paper, the doors
broke the shower doesn't work.
Right. And,
and you're in a business
model in the State and if they
want you to have nice State
parks in the operational
cost is, is that
side unless the legislature
wants to determine. Ok. Well, we're gonna
general fund you
and, and we did that
with some improvements.
Right.
But the public use,
right is gotta,
you're there, it costs the
State money just like the
campers that mov'e from one site
to another year round
because they figured they can live cheaper
at the campground, they can in the trailer
park, but
not even $1
per person per
visitor in a State
park. It's
amazing to me. Right. That
you're that far upside
down and that people push
back when residents
were free for the day.
Right.
I, I just, I
don't know, maybe we should just
put a dollar in everybody's driver's
license for State
parks.
And, uh, and that will
fix the problem. But, I
mean,
common sense tells
you 1
$1 per person. Right.
If you charge per head in the day
use resident. Right.
It probably averages 4 to
$5 per car.
Right. When it's,
when we had a, had a scenario
that made it free.
Uh, and then, I
don't know. You know, I know
on national Parks.
Right. It depends
where you go. But an annual pass
is $100 to
$50
is we go to page a
lot and our annual pass is
$50. Right. And that's just
for parking, that's
nothing else but parking.
Right.
And so you think about
that and, and what the
costs are, uh, I
mean, I guess the
legislature could run a bill that
says, you know, we're gonna
increase fees and see where it
goes. Other
than that, I mean, less
than $1 per
persons
per visitor. Right?
Would make you
whole,
if you charge $2 you'd
really be in the
money and if you charge
$5 across the board, you'd
really be in the money.
But when you gave something for free,
then they didn't like the free
that they didn't even understand the
free part. Right. But
they understood the other cost and it
cost me money over here because
I'm, I get to go for
free if I go for the day.
But if I can do anything else it
cost. I know human
nature is just crazy,
uh, to me, but
it's fascinating to me, but I think
somehow we're gonna have to get a handle on this
and, and I mean, but
this is a telling story
when you have the largest,
one number of visitors,
Phin Butte and
Navajo
I'm looking for Navajo 807
30,000. And
you operated in the red
with the largest number of
visitors. So that tells you
your fees are too low and your
operational costs are high
and you gotta fix that and
reverse that. Otherwise
you're gonna
have,
I won't say it, but bad
parks are the
term bad parks or non
serviceable parks. Right.
When something happens and, and,
and that's
the job we tasked you with.
So we got to fix that
problem. I mean,
um, I don't know how we're
gonna do that, but we, we can give
you capital money to
fix this and fix that and it's
a little slow going out. I mean, you have
some big ideas and big
dreams but the, the
COVID money tells us it took you
three years almost to get to,
to construction and get it done.
So, having
that, let me ask you one thing
are the EV chargers gonna include
electric boat
chargers?
>> What I understand Mr. Chair
is that those EV chargers
are for vehicles, not for
vessels.
So I don't think they're, they've
taken, I don't think I,
you caught me off guard. I don't think
I even pose that question as
far as uh, vessels being transitioned
to. Ev
I'll bring it up. >> I did
see an boat
on the Fourth of
July. So it was very
interesting
and we had to pull
up to the marine. I said, so where do you
charge.
And, and so, I
mean,
it's happening. And so I,
I just what
about? And this is another interesting
question in the acquiring
minds. Want to know how
many people have used the charging
station at Bluewater
>> Mr. Chair. Actually, we have
good usership at that
charging point. I I can tell you
what the percentage
per day of use is.
However,
as people have become more aware
of the charging stations at Caballo
and uh Bluewater,
we've had more uh
visitation to the park
specifically because they can
have a recreation experience
while
their vehicles
getting charged through the EV charger.
As opposed to where you go to
uh an EV bank where you're in the
parking lot of an outlet mall that's
closed and
uh, you don't get an an outdoor
experience. Uh, people
enjoy being able to walk
around their State park while
their uh vehicles
getting charged. >> Do they still have
to pay the fee to go in if even
if they just want to charge
>> uh Mister Cherry?
Yes.
However, most Mr. Chair
in the EV uh build
out plan with the
CFCF I grant
that we were applying for through NM
dot Those stations
will be located outside
of the park, uh
fee areas so that
they would be available for general
public use. >> I like them better
in the
area.
Um Thank you for your time and I
asked we'll be talking about,
I mean, it, it's
just amazing me that you, you
got to cover your overhead
costs. We don't cover
your overhead costs. You can't
provide goods and services
right? In the
two largest parks,
right? You're in the
negative on when
it's less than a dollar
per person to go
to the State park on average.
Right?
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you. Thank you,
Committee
Health
Insurance.
I'm superintendent. You're
next
the start this
off.
This is almost the favorite
subject in my
life.
My,
it seems like I get a renewal
every month and it's just
like
who's gonna start us
off?
You need to push the red button and
then
uh
that little person
button.
>> Can you hear me now,
Mr. Chair? Thank
you. Well,
thank you for having us here.
Um I'm
uh Mr. Chair
representative Senator,
I'm Alice Kane. I'm the superintendent
of insurance. Uh
to my left, let
me introduce other people at the
table, Carol
Walker, uh who is
from the Rocky Mountain Insurance
Association
and uh Jake
Clark, who is from guy
guy carpenter and who will be
discussing the reinsurance market
with us. Uh
I think you all have our
presentations.
Mr. Chair, May I
begin? >> Go ahead
and then
you get through them as quick as you
can. >> Ok.
Well, the property insurance
market regulated
by O SI today, we're
focusing mostly on homeowners
insurance, but we do
landlord insurance, renters,
insurance, and commercial property
insurance. The
market oversight O SI
provides, we
license insurance companies
and risk bearing
insurance entities.
We ensure compliance of
rules and forms submitted
by the insurers are
correct and we also
enforce the laws and
regulations.
We review rate filings
to ensure premiums are adequate
and not excessive.
And we do quarterly and
annual reviews of financial
statements of the companies that
are licensed here to ensure
solvency. And
finally, which right
now I think is most important.
We assist consumers with
insurance issues and
complaints.
The key public policies
governing New Mexico's Homeowners
insurance market is
that rates must be actually
justified and cannot be
excessive, inadequate or
unfairly discriminatory.
New Mexico is a file
and use State
that really means
that the insurers
can file their rates.
We will review them but they will
be in use. And if there's a problem,
we will raise issues along
those lines and that allows
the industry to really
mov'e with market trends.
We in some other cases
like uh health
insurance, it's an approval
process
and then an issue. New
Mexico requires insurers to
cover the cost to replace or
repair a property
that's damaged without deduction
for
depreciation.
I think the uh the
main issue. Well, one of the
main issues that we're talking about
today is climate
change. It's increasing
the frequency and
intensity of
catastrophic events.
Uh Unfortunately, we know the
wildfires in Riodosa,
we've had severe hailstorms
on the eastern side which actually
has caused more damage than the
wildfires. We have
hurricanes and again in
Riodosa, we're having repeated
floods. Uh because
of the scar area,
the average claim amount has
increased due to inflation,
rising home value,
co home values
increased labor and building
material costs.
And I think uh
Mr. Clark is going to talk about
the reinsurance market has hardened,
resulting in increased
premiums on direct insurers
for the last several years because
of the increased in severity
and number of
catastrophe
uh incidents
risk mitigation. I
Mr. Chair, I know you're gonna
have a uh another
panel on risk mitigation
but it, I think
I can't go through this without at
least making a short
mention. States
not just New Mexico are working
with insurers to develop science
based risk mitigation
standards to address these
emerging risks. Um
This has been done in the
east and the south on floods
and we're starting to work
uh more more
closely with the,
the uh scientific
developments on
uh uh wildfires,
community level mitigation
initiatives in high risk areas
include forest management,
community building codes
and fire awareness
education,
individual property level
mitigation of efforts
such as creating a 5 ft
defensible space and home
hardening are also
promising tactics to
reduce wildfire risk,
not eliminate but
reduce. We cannot
100% eliminate.
Uh The Insurance Institute
for Business and Home Safety
IBHS has
been here in New Mexico twice.
Uh Mr. Chair, I think
Senator Woods, you were at that
presentation with IBHS
a few weeks ago.
Um They
estimate that each dollar
invested in mitigation
yields up to $6 in
savings of future
recovery costs
O SI is working with key
stakeholder groups to develop
Legislation to incentivize
widespread adoption of risk
mitigation strategies in
high risk areas. But
this, this type of program,
you can't just
do individual hardening, you
just can't do community
hardening. It has to be
focused in the risk areas and
it has to be broad-based
because if one house is hardened
and the rest of the community isn't,
it's not going to work. So
this is really a comprehensive
approach that we're talking
about in the
future. New
Mexico has a fair plan. Other
states have fair plans as well, not
all, but some do. As a
matter of fact, Colorado is introducing
one as we speak.
Uh and a fair plan
uh comes into play when
a homeowner or commercial
property owner has been denied
coverage in the open market.
They can enroll in the fair
plan. The
fair plan covers up to
$350,000
for individual homes and a million
for commercial properties. Uh
that was increased, I
think two sessions ago.
Unlike coverage on the open
market, the fair plan only
covers actual cash
value, meaning replacement
cost and depreciation is not
covered. The fair
plan is funded by homeowner
premiums and
carrier assessments. I think
we had a our first carrier
assessment in about uh
10 or 15
years just last year.
But based on what's been going
on recently, there May
be another assessment coming
for this year.
Uh Len one note
is that lenders
banks, meaning banks do
not accept the fair plan as
creditable coverage to meet
mortgage requirements
because it doesn't cover replacement
value.
Now, let's, I think we want
to turn to our most
recent issue.
Uh This, I want
to share with the Os I's response
to the South Fork and salt
fires in Riodosa.
Uh As you know, the Governor
declared a State of emergency
in June. Uh the
declaration authorizes
O si to issue its own
emergency order.
The provisions of the emergency
order that was issued included
an advance additional living
expense payment in the amount of
$5000 to
policyholders who were
evacuated. This
evacuation was the key
uh
key motivating
factor. Uh It
didn't matter whether your home was lost
or not lost at that point, nobody knew,
but if you were evacuated, we were trying
to get people living expenses
to help them mov'e out of the area.
There was very little uh
space for first responders
and uh we thought that was
really important. Uh
We also waived deductibles.
We postponed uh
policy cancellations
and non renewals for 100 and 20
days and we
provided for 100 and 20 day
grace periods for the payment of
premiums. O
ss. I dispatched a team of
consumer assistance
specialists to Riodosa
to assist policyholders
with filing claims and resolving
complaints. Melissa
Mr. Chair uh
Senators representatives
today, I have Melissa Robertson
who is with me. Melissa has been
up in Riodosa
probably for the
last
uh
how long Melissa?
Four weeks along with
five other Members of our team
to help uh people
with questions and
assistance in filing
claims. Um
This is, this is a
normal uh
step that O
SI has taken over the years
to help people in these
difficult situations.
And we've get, I, I must
say we got a lovely letter
from the mayor uh about
how helpful uh
Melissa and her
team have been
in general. Uh, insurers
have complied with the emergency
order. Uh There has been
an exception. State
Farm has resisted
paying the 5000 advance
living expense. Uh
We uh oss I
went to court and got
an order last week
and I understand from
Melissa and her people that
State Farm is now
paying that $5000
living expense. There will be a hearing
on this issue next
week. Uh
just to share. So you get a
sense of the who, who
actually issues policies
in that area. Uh
State Farm is the
largest writer, uh
almost 1800
policies uh followed
by farmers That's a little over
1100
then liberty and
USA a just
to get a sense of the poli of
the companies that are up there.
New Mexico's property insurance
market share. This is broader than
just what we're
talking about in Riodosa. But across
the State State farm is
by uh is the
largest writer.
Farmers is a close
second with USA
a Liberty and Allstate
and Travelers pretty much
uh I in the same
percentage
and Mr. Chair,
uh Senators representatives,
if you have any questions,
feel free
to ask them or
wait till my
fellow panelists
get to
speak
>> whoever's next and we'll wait for
questions.
>> Thank you superintendent and
thank you, Mr. Chair and Members of the
Committee very much. You'll
>> need to a little person
on your deal. >> I
have such a loud voice that people
usually don't notice.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
again. Thank you Members of the
Committee for inviting
us to be here today. I am
the Executive director of the Rocky
Mountain Insurance Association.
What that is, is a trade
association that represents
property and casualty insurance
companies. Um
Romia as we call, it
does represent
about 80% of
the property and casualty insurance
marketplace. I've been in my
job for 26 years.
We have New Mexico,
Colorado, Utah. And
Wyoming is part of my
responsibility. I always
tell people that um maybe it makes
them feel more compassionate to me
that um on behalf of
my companies, my full time
job is helping people understand
insurance. Um whether
that's legislators,
homeowners, um
State agencies
really trying to take what is
complex for many people, but
something that they have to
have either by law
or for a mortgage
or for really on that worst
day when they need to
use insurance that they have
what they need when they need it the
most. Um I've
been responding to
catastrophes in New Mexico
on behalf of the industry.
That's a key role that I play
for them on being a
liaison with our
State partners and
with the homeowners themselves, with
the insurance companies and recovery
efforts. Um My first
major catastrophe in my
job was the Serra Grande
fire back in
2000. Um
And we're there again
um with the Salt and
South Fork fires and
um the insurance companies have
been on site, they will continue
to be there and committed to
be there as the Economic
engine really that rebuilds these
communities. So,
um again, thank you to the O
SI for all of their efforts on
the ground and um we
will work closely with them to
continue these recovery efforts,
really, to help people rebuild
their lives. Um I
always like to start off these
pre notations of
what is the marketplace in
New Mexico with
something that you all get.
Um, you're living it.
Um But when you see the numbers,
it really is astounding
and how they're changing.
Um In my first
slide, um in
2003, the US
experienced 28
separate weather and climate
disasters that cost at least a
billion dollars.
Unfortunately, that's a record
we never wanted to break, but we
did. Um, so
each year we are seeing
an increase in escalation
of not just the
number of claims but the cost
to pay those claims.
And as we well know in
New Mexico, it's not just
wildfire. Um,
this is a hail prone
State. Um, in fact,
insurance companies pay out
more in hail claims
on average than they do in
wildfire claims.
Um, because they are so
pervasive, you have 1 45
minute hailstorm as you know,
um, on the part of the State
Senator Woods that, um, can
cause, you know,
tens of millions of dollars
and even we've had billion
dollar catastrophes
in Colorado caused by
hail. So what
we will see from that slide
is just a preliminary
report in 2024
of our tornado,
severe wind
and severe hail
events. Um, all of
those dots on the map in the United
States are just what we're
at so far.
Um I thought
it was important in the context
of how
everything that
insurance pays for is
increasing in costs
and also increasing
in the number of claims
to really look. I think that
this map of the
United States where
shows the average
homeowners insurance premiums
in 2023.
And, um, I certainly
know and I feel you're
paying anyone who has their
homeowner's insurance premiums
go up at all or
even double or
even in some cases
triple.
Get a sense though in New
Mexico, when you look at that
map, some of the more
expensive homeowners
premiums in New Mexico are in the
eastern part of the,
the State. Um,
and some of that is due to hail.
So, um, as we're looking at
where those costs are spread
out, I think that you'll
also look at the
next slide where
we talk about where
insurance is becoming
unaffordable.
This report was just
released this week where
they named the 10 states
where homeowners insurance is becoming
unaffordable and you will
see your neighboring
states are
some of those top states.
Um, Colorado where I'm based
out of, out of Denver is
ranked 10th, um,
with a bullet and
then you look at states like Nebraska
and Kansas and really, it's
tornadoes and hail and
convective storms that are
driving those
rates. New
Mexico isn't there yet. So we've
had a lot of conversations
with, um, our fire
officials, the o
si other partners
where we really are at a
tipping point in New Mexico
where we're
not in as bad a shape
as the rest of
your neighbors and even some
places in the rest of the country.
We also understand we actually
call it the pain index.
When we look at data in the
insurance industry
where we realize
because of income levels
that even when rates
rise in New Mexico, you can
feel the pain more here.
So certainly we understand where
you're not seeing some of those
quadruple digit increases,
where you're seeing in places like
Colorado. There is
pain for the homeowners
who are experiencing that.
Um New Mexico
was ranked 30th in the
US for average
premium. And
um it's only 1.4%
higher premium
than the rest of the country.
So as we're trying to
look at solutions and what's
happening in the insurance
market and we know these are
household budget issues
for
folks as they're sitting around the
table trying to factor homeowners
insurance premium and they're seeing that
rise. I think that what
we really need to be thinking about,
ok, we don't want to do some of the things that
we're doing in the other states.
What can we do in New Mexico?
What solutions can we look
at that are going to
keep a stable market
here. We are in the hardest
market in a generation
in this country for
property insurance. So
some of those cycles are
really being driven by what we're
experiencing in our
own budgets. Um record
inflation um
especially in the
construction and trade
sector. So even as
we see inflation
soften finally a little bit,
we're seeing that in our national
headlines, you look at what happened
in the construction
industry
that's still feeling a lot of pressure
is gonna have a long tail
because what your insurance company
cares about, what does it cost to repair
and rebuild. And we
see inflation pressure on
that. We see labor
shortages, the cost of lumber,
the cost of glass, all
of those things increase.
That's putting a tremendous
amount of pressure on
what your insurers need to
charge you for a premium to be
able to pay out those claims.
Um I know my fellow
Panelist is going to talk about
reinsurance. At the same
time, we've seen record
reinsurance rates
with stas insurance that
insurance companies need to buy
to make sure that they can
pay for these catastrophic
events. Um
So those are all things
that we hope are cycling
through, but we know at the same
time, some of those costs
aren't going to change.
Um We know it's scary for people.
We know when someone gets a non
renewal from their insurance company
that they've had for 20
years now, they're
too high of a risk for that
company. What we're seeing in New
Mexico, we have pockets in
Colorado, for example,
where people are having
a hard time finding not
just affordable insurance but
available insurance
in New Mexico. What we're
seeing is if you can't stay
with one insurer, standard
insurer that we are
seeing that people are able to shop
for it and find it elsewhere.
They could be pushed in what we call
a surplus lines or higher
risk market. But that is
something where we're still seeing
a pretty balanced
market, stable
market in New Mexico, even
though we know there's pressure on that
marketplace and we know that
you get a lot of those calls from your
constituents.
Um So just finally, I wanted to wrap
it up and, um, superintendent
Cain touched on this. Um,
we did bring out the
CEO and President of the
Insurance Institute for Business and
Home Safety twice this
year. Um, felt
like it was great to get on
his calendar. Um,
they're part of the National
Conversation of
wildfire especially
is one of those risks that we know the
science shows us
that there's a lot we can do to put
the odds in our favor. Um
As we look at the Riodosa
fires, we will have
examples. I've already heard from
Laura mccarthy, the head of the New
Mexico State Forestry Division
that when she toured it, she
saw home standing or less
damage next to
neighborhoods that were
gone.
And what tells us when we assess
these fires? Time after
time is those homes
left standing. The ones that
withstood the fire are
the ones that did the mitigation.
And as superintendent Cain said,
we're working closely with the O
SI and with
our State partners and fire
officials to look at how
can we scale up that
mitigation? Um
The last slide which I
don't want to take up too much more
of your time. There's a whole
website for IBHS where
you can go on and we burned
down homes in the
lab. One side by side
with products that are
fire mitigated ones that aren't
we test products? We test
defensible space
those are things we want to bring
in real time to New Mexico in
these communities, both at a
personal level and a community
level. So we would be happy
to um when my
turn comes to answer any
further questions about some of the
work that we're trying to do from
a mitigation standpoint to
reduce that risk. So again,
Mr., Chair, Members of the Committee, thank you
for your
time,
>> Mr. Chair and, and,
and, and Members of the Committee. Thank
you. I appreciate the time to
address you this afternoon.
Um I, I'll follow my slides
pretty quickly. Um And, and
try to make up a little bit of
time for you. Um
Starting on the first slide just a
little bit about who we
are. Uh
I, I work for Guy Carpenter,
which is the, the reinsurance
arm of Marsh mclennan.
Um Marsh mclennan uh
is comprised of four
businesses who are in the
consulting area and two
are in risk
and capital management.
Um Our sister company
Marsh um is
the largest global
primary insurance
uh broker.
Um I've spent 30
years now with Guy Carpenter and
over that time, I've worked
on a broad range of
insurance companies
from single State
operations to national
and multinational
companies.
Um What I want to highlight
before I get into further
comments and I'll
echo um a little bit
what the superintendent and,
and um um my
colleague to, to my right
mentioned
um the role of
reinsurance. Uh
So all of
your primary
insurance companies that are
operating here in the State of
New Mexico, um
rely on reinsurance
to help support their
businesses. Um
It plays a very important role
in the industry in spreading
risk uh in
managing volatility.
Uh And uh it
helps primary
companies in essence
expand um their business
offerings and it helps them be
more consistent in what
they do. Uh I'd
argue without
reinsurance, many
of them would have to charge
premiums, multiples
of what they're charging right
now just in order
to bank the necessary
capital necessary
to live up to their
obligations um
and handle uh
climate, weather
related catastrophes in
particular.
So with that, I
turning to
the second slide in
my deck, where does
the reinsurance market
sit today?
Um The placement
environment this year so
far in 24 has been
much smoother than last
year. 23
was is,
has already been said a
very, very difficult
year. There was a lot of retrenching
going on in the business.
Um Program pricing
for catastrophe treaties
has generally stabilized.
Our price index shows
a modest CRE increase
year over year of about
1.2%. And
at mie this year with mie
placements, we actually
saw uh the beginning
signs of price reduction.
Um There are signs in the
reinsurance area that capital
is rebounding. So
last year reinsurers
did have a good year
following some of the price increases,
they needed to take
um that's gone.
Uh That's given
them a good step forward
in addressing the experience
they saw from 2017
to 2022
where, where for the most part
they were um booking
losses.
Um while these
trends are a good sign, we
continue to operate in
the market in a very disciplined
environment. Um
but companies uh
that we work with that show
a command of their exposure
uh and demonstrate
solid risk management
practices. They
will over time uh
secure more consistent
and fairer terms from their
reinsurers.
What remains a continuing
challenge and it's already been talked
about today are the loss
trends and these loss trends
are not abating
year to date
worldwide. Cat
losses have
already come in at over
$50 billion
through June. That's
a 14%
rise
over inflation
adjusted the the
inflation adjusted five
year average.
Um So there are concerns,
there are also concerns
as I'm sure you're aware
as to what this year's storm
season will bring.
Um And certainly any
large scale
cat activity around the globe
can influence how the
market reacts as we go
into 2025.
Um Turning
to the third
slide. Um
I want to talk a little bit and spend
a few minutes on just some of the
drivers that are
influencing um
pricing in, in the
market losses
and poor results.
Um That's an obvious
one.
They drive both price and
available capacity that's
in the market.
Um since
2017, higher
loss trends have been front
of mind for,
um, underwriters in the
field. Five
of the past eight years, we've
seen industry losses exceed
100 billion, which we've never
seen before.
Um And losses are coming
from multiple fronts. So
it's not just the big headline
hurricanes and earthquakes. We've already
been talking this afternoon in this
room about the impacts
from wildfire which you're well
aware, uh severe
convective storm hail
um as well as flooding and
we're seeing it both here in the US
um as well as around the
globe. Um
But losses aren't the only issue,
impacting industry
results. There are also
issues and, and some
concerns um in some
jurisdictions on
regulatory issues,
issues also related
to social inflation
and what we're seeing happening with
court judgments.
Um
Florida,
Louisiana, New York,
California are but a few
states where
regulatory approaches
um do raise concerns
to underwriters.
Um We even
see this as we try to get more
markets um from
guy carpenter involved in
issues, for example,
flood. Um
And as we're talking
to insurance
companies to try
and convince them to offer
product for some of these
lines, some
of them will sometimes
cite regulatory
risk as a reason for
not um getting more
involved.
Um Another
issue um again,
I mentioned in the second go
social inflation
and court judgments leading
to nuclear verdicts. So
nuclear verdicts being
those that come in
over $10 million
those are also hitting an all
time high. So
reinsurers are seeing it not just
from weather and not just from
property, but they're seeing it on the
casualty side of their
businesses as
well. Um And
then finally, economic inflation,
which are um I I'm
sure well aware it's been mentioned
already, that's been
top of mind over the
past two years.
And I suspect because how
the rating systems work
and, and how long it takes an
insurance company to do their
filings and get that
um through the system,
uh their their recent rate
filings probably have not
captured all
of the inflation impacted
losses they've seen over the last
2 to 3 years.
Um Switching
to the next slide
again as
brokers, we sit on the
same side of the table as
our clients. We're helping
them shape their risk and capital
management strategies.
Um Often the end product
of that work takes the form
of risk transfer
solutions. Um
But that process begins much
earlier than that. Um It's
anchored around in-depth
analytics. Uh We
invest heavily in these tools
and they include everything
from actuarial
approaches, loss
models, financial
modeling, uh and
predictive analytics.
And these are all designed
to help insurers
measure risk uh
support their
portfolio management
and help inform reinsurance,
purchasing and placement
efforts. Um
Many of our clients are also
utilizing these tools on their
own um rating
agencies in terms are
evaluating the insurance
companies out there in terms of
how they're applying these tools
and how they are um
good stewards of managing
their own portfolio
and they're doing that as they
determine and assign what they
believe are appropriate
financial strength
ratings.
Um Beyond
measuring the current
risks held within a client's
portfolio,
we often employ uh
with them additional
financial modeling to help
them understand how their business
will be evolving over a
multiyear period
that's becoming even more
germane when people consider
the impacts of climate.
And what are the likely implications
of that as you look
forward?
Um Some
regulators we see are embracing
some of these tools,
some regulators um
have been slow too.
Uh We just simply from our
perspective would make the argument
that these tools promote
stable offerings.
Uh They help increase
resilience and they bring
buyers and sellers of both
insurance and reinsurance products
closer.
Um
The next slide
I'm just underscoring,
right? Our, our customer
base is broad in both
character and scope.
Um It's global, it
runs across different regulatory
regimes we represent,
as I mentioned before, small
regional players to large
multinationals.
We work with um
both insurance carriers
as well as reinsurance
companies. We're
involved uh with
helping and support
captives, managing
general agents and
underwriters and we
work with both private
and public sector
entities. Uh
We have a large footprint
with various residual market
mechanisms here in the US
as well as abroad.
And again, these range
from small fair
plan uh
facilities
in certain states.
Um up to very
large facilities like the NF
IP. Um
In all cases, we're seeking
to help them manage risk,
support their business
plans and match
those plans to appropriate
risk capital.
Um My last slide
uh despite a robust
solution set,
today's challenges do
require flexibility in
new approaches. Uh
We're seeking a means to
take conventional
approaches and reshape them
to help expand the
value proposition
our industry has to
offer. Um
on the international
front, you might be
aware of such efforts that are
being explored through the insurance
development forum in the UN
seeking a means to
embed risk management
tools, processes
and discipline to the benefit
of emerging markets.
Um There's been interest
expressed around parametric
insurance products as a means
to shortcut what can be
lengthy claim adjustment
processes with
traditional indemnity
products. Um
Again, the the the
whole purpose and effort
of that being the sooner
you can inject
uh insurance
recoveries back into a
community that's been hit
hard by an
event, the sooner that
community can get back
on its feet.
Um So
maybe with that,
uh I
will um close
down my comments and, and
await the questions
that you might have. Thank
you, >> madam
Secretary. You all right.
There's a lot of smoke and mirrors
over there that I'm seeing. And I'm looking at
page 12 of your
presentation where,
where the $4
billion in sales? Only
60 I gotta
put my glasses
60
63%
of losses. So that's
roughly a 30%
margin in the market. Sounds
like Jake from State Farm is
not such a good friend after
all. And since
you plan to put a restraining order
against him,
um, but these are the
numbers and, and
if you're operating in a 30%
margin,
net income after
losses, that's not a bad
income. Uh
So I just want to make sure you're right in the
smoke and mirror. Senator share
your with our
first.
>> So start with me.
All right, after smoking mirrors, that's
great.
May be appropriate.
So, Mr. Chair
and I, I want to start with
you, um,
superintendent,
at least for the fires and
floods.
I think an awful lot of
that
is easily mitigated
if the federal government would
allow us to do
so. Uh,
you notice the fires don't
happen on Mescalero because
mescaleros manage their
forests they hire
and they, they happen in
Lincoln, uh
because
the Feds don't
manage that forest
and yet there's a two lane road
that separates them.
Um,
and it's been that way for
decades. Same
with where, where the federal
government literally burned
down 350
acres. Was
it last year or two years ago?
Ok. They literally burned
it down. Not on
purpose, but there's people
that started the fire.
Um,
so
when I'm looking at these and then
of course, the floods that come after the
fire, that race,
you know, everything down and
destroy story Lake or whatever
other things that get in the
way.
Um
A we either need to be
charging the federal government the
premiums
just send him a
bill
uh, every year
or we need your help to
say, hey, let us, if
you're not gonna clean up the forest, if
you're not gonna manage the forest, just
simply let us do
it. So the fires and
floods part of this, I
think
the whole idea that my
insurance is gonna go up because the
federal government decided to burn
down a forest
ticks me off.
I didn't have anything to do with burning down
a forest,
any of the
forests.
So I don't
know what you can do. I don't know what we can
do, Mr. Chair.
I know I mentioned this a
lot. If
my neighbor continues to burn
down his house
and,
and it, and it does something to
my house, then there should
be something we can do to say
stop burning down your
house because you're affecting
me. And
that's, that's
what we have to do in this thing.
And that goes to the, to the
nuclear
judgments.
I don't find it here,
but I saw somewhere where
New Mexico had more
out of State attorneys
licensed in New Mexico
with their ads saying,
hey, if you get hurt,
call me before you call the
ambulance because I'm
gonna get you millions of dollars
and the ambulance is only going to take you to
a hospital that's going to overcharge
you and hurt you. So call me
first.
I think that's because we've
done seriously
stupid things with our laws where
we have intentionally
chosen our attorneys over
our
doctors,
these things. I think
seriously
mitigate
the cost of insurance in New
Mexico.
I'm, I'm
surprised but I'm happy that
homeowners insurance in New
Mexico is, is
lower.
But I do think that there's things here
where our laws, Mr.
Chair,
we can change to
help with this cost. I
don't think this cost has
to be
because we don't have to spend
gazillion dollars.
If we don't burn down the
forest, we
don't have to spend a gazillion
dollars if we just simply
didn't allow the
attorneys from out of State to
practice, uh,
their sue and run
tactics on our
highways.
So
not any particular questions
there. But I know the fires
and floods can be mitigated
if we were simply allowed
to. And I know that
the nuclear things
could go away if we
were simply had sane
laws
and didn't open it up so
large because I don't
think that the rest of the world
is, is taking these kind
of hits with
the nuclear options. There's,
there's caps along the
way there.
Um, and I,
and I know, you know, if I'm the guy
that gets the, the $40
million judgment, yay for
me. But everybody
else in the State, everybody
else in the country pays for
it.
So I
think it makes sense to have some kind
of cap. Thank you, smoking
mirrors.
>> You know what percentage of insurance
companies are owned by hedge
>> funds?
I do not, but probably a
lot
>> we'll find out. Representative
Louhan.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate it.
Um Just a few
questions.
So Mr. Chair, two
years ago, three providers accounted
for about 48 per
48.5%
of the total P and C
market.
So
right now the from the top,
uh, three
providers, um,
I mean, where are we
now? And what are
those, those
top three,
accounting
for
>> what I have here is, uh,
from 2022
the N A IC, uh,
survey that got
us the numbers that are here.
Uh, we're actually
participating with
the N A IC and doing a national
survey to find out
these, you know, the
latest numbers. I don't have
those immediately, but I do
have, uh, the number
of policyholders that are
there and the number of claims.
So it's, it's been pretty much,
I can't say static,
but it's State farm is
clearly the largest
farmers usually runs
second on,
on the homeowners
property. And then,
uh, let's see. Allstate,
I think is next. But if you look at
there's some material in the back
that'll talk about all P and
C and casualty and it shifts a
little bit. But,
uh, but not that
much. And then you see liberty
and, and USA
A and
travelers.
So we haven't seen that much
of a, a shift.
>> So thank you
for that. Um
So my question, how long before
we, we tip into New
Mexico tips into a
noncompetitive market.
>> I'm so sorry. I don't know >> how
>> long >> before New Mexico
tips into or goes
into a noncompetitive market.
Mr. Chair,
>> Mr. Chair
representative, I'm at
this point. I, I couldn't
predict that. Uh
Right now we seem to be
competitive. I think our biggest
issue is access.
Uh the cost when
the policies are issued is what
they were talking about. But I
think we've all gotten
complaints about non
renewals and cancellations.
And I think right now what we're trying
to do is work on some
sort of comprehensive approach
that will provide
mitigation in the
areas where policies
are being canceled and
non renewed and that's
really in the high risk areas.
I have asked for
information about
where there's not. I don't, I
have a right to get
information uh
if they cancel a
line, I'm struggling to
get information in the
areas that there are non
canceling and non
renewing.
>> Ok. So I guess
and I'm referring to the fair
plans. It
your
Yeah, Mr. Chair, thank
you
with the fair plan. It, it's
the, it's a plan of last
resort. Is that correct, Mr.
Chair?
Is that a fair assessment? >> Mr.
Chair representative?
Yes, it's after you've been
denied coverage, you can go to the
fair plan. The fair
plan, uh
uh premiums
are usually higher. Uh
It's usually used
as an interim step when you can't
get insurance. But
it's not helpful if you're having
a problem with your mortgage because
the bankers don't recognize
it. >> So when lenders
do not see the fair plan
as credible
coverage, is
it because of the limitations
to what a fair plan will cover?
And I mean,
what is it covered? I guess we need a
little bit >> the fair and
you come in and you get an amount
like a flat amount, they
call it a cash value amount.
Whereas we,
we require the other, the
policies in our marketplace
to cover replacement value,
which is different.
>> So I guess what,
I'm, I'm trying to get out
because of what has happened in
disastrous areas
and, and with our fires and other
things like that. And because
one of the things that came up this weekend,
Mr. Chair, as a matter of fact, is a
group of, of
constituents in Santa Fe and
saying that their, their premiums are
going to go up so high that they're not
going to have, they're not gonna, they're not
going to be able to pay for their
insurances because of the reassessment
of, of the
um the places
where they live
and with fire
coverage and so forth.
So then the next
step would to go into a fair
plan. Is that correct Mr.
Chair or to look into
fair plans?
Is that correct, Mr. Chair?
Ok. So then
what can we do as
legislators to prevent
becoming
noncompetitive and
expand available coverage for New
Mexicans without
becoming like California
where there's too many of
the, of the constituents
there only have their
plans available to
them.
Is it? It's a
big question, but Mr.
Chair, that's what you're talking about
and that's what we're >> representative.
I, I guess the fair plan is a,
is a plan of last
resort. Uh,
and it, it's
also a limited amount because
350,000 is the
cap. So
I'm not sure
how I
can
>> expand on that. Maybe
someone else can expand on that through
>> negotiation.
I might be able to
help a little with some,
some color, maybe
turn up your micro for a
minute.
So when we look at New
Mexico and you, you make the
comparison to New Mexico
and California, they're
completely different
landscapes going on
there. Um
California,
uh because of
proposition 103,
many insurance companies,
particularly homeowner
carriers, um, are
running loss ratios
that are simply
unsustainable.
Um They're, they're
losing money, handover
fist and
the rate process
in the State is very
lengthy and
it's capped. And
basically you now have
insurance companies that are holding up
their hand going. This
is just untenable. You
might be the ninth largest
economy in the world,
but we don't think we can
make money in this line of
business. And
unless you change it, we're gonna get
out.
That's fortunately
what you don't have going on here.
Right. The fair plan here, at
least as of 2022
comprised less than
1% of New
Mexico's premium
market. Um
There are exercises though
that, that probably, um could
be looked at. Um, and we've
spoken with the superintendent
about some of that to
uh help provide
perspective.
Um, as I mentioned in
my comments, um
uh we work very closely
with a number of
the fair plan wind
pool facilities here
in the US. Uh
And and can help provide
perspective in a game plan as
to how to avoid
um some of the issues
that are happening in other states.
Um But again, um
the the
not that there won't
be examples of
some pain out there
with people experiencing
rate increases, they might
not like to see because
some of that still has to work
through what's happened over the
last six years in the
industry. Um
But from our
perspective where we sit right
now, you're in a far
better position to get
ahead of any issues and
manage those issues.
>> So Mr. Chair, so fair plans
would be a two
parts before you answer. And thank
you for that because that's what I'm trying
to look for is how we can
uh protect New
Mexico in some ways.
But when three companies own nearly
50% of the
market,
the market can't be
considered very
competitive. Is that
fair to say as well
and in that
realm,
uh
I mean, it, I'm putting this
all together and for me to look
at all these, these points and I'm
not an insurance agent.
Um, but
I've been paying attention to what's going
on, especially with the fire mitigation
and what's just happened in
Riodosa and, and two years ago and
everything like that and,
and to your credit uh
superintendent, you've been
looking at how, you know,
bringing to attention
that we need to mitigate some of these
things through, through
insurance,
um
uh plans and so
forth. So I'm trying to put all that
together, but
under the under understanding
some of this, like you have three companies
that are 50% of,
you know, the market. So
how are, I mean, can you, can
you develop that line
of thought a little bit more for me, Mr.
Chair,
what we can do preventative,
what we, so we do not
become like what we've seen in
other parts of the
country.
>> Mr. Chair representative.
I, I think going back a
little bit to California, California
put a cap on the
rates. We have not put a cap on
the rates. We are really pushing
more for access and
availability.
Um I'm
not sure, I mean, there are
other companies beyond
besides the, you know,
three that have 50% of the
market that are offering policies
here. So I'm not
hearing that that's a problem. And
I, I also think, but,
but the cost is a problem.
Uh, but we are still working
on access. I think
that, uh,
uh, uh MS
Walker basically said
there are times that you can't
find insurance from those
traditional companies, but you
can go into the surplus area
or you can come to the fair plan
depending on the, the
what amount of
coverage you need.
So I, I
think that what we're trying
to do and we're trying to look
at a whole comprehensive plan
is to go back to those areas
of high risk. See if we can get
mitigation
certifications,
you know, house by house
mitigation community
mitigation, building code
changes, uh, and
education to sort of
to get those insurers
insurers to come back and write
in those areas. And
we're trying to work with
IBHS, uh to
see what, what, uh,
level of mitigation would
be acceptable for them to come
back and, and, uh, write
in those areas. And that's, that's a
big part of what
my focus has been for the
last, I guess.
Uh, I
guess six months. >> Thank you.
I think it would you like to
expand on that?
Um,
>> uh, thank you, Mr. Chair
and uh, Representative Lujan.
Those are all good questions.
And, um, I think you feel
the concern that we hear
all the time, um, from
homeowners about,
like I said, it's scary,
right? So I think that what
we're trying to do and really strike
the balance as to both of
my co panelists said
is, um,
insurance companies don't like
uncertainty. So ways
to bring confidence into the
market and maintain confidence
in the market isn't a
silver bullet. Um
It's having a good
functioning fair
plan as a pressure valve
release, but not as a
panacea
because that's where
you run into the problems of
California where there's a run
on the fair plan
because insurance
companies are either severely
reducing their capacity
or leaving the State.
Florida. You have the Fair
plan is the largest insurer in the
State. Um I'm on the board
of the new Colorado Fair Plan where we're
building a fair plan and we're
really trying to take
the lessons learned.
You have a good functioning fair
plan in New Mexico. So that
gives them insurance companies
confident that there is
an insurer of last resort for
property. So that's a positive
you don't want to expand that too much
because then that's dangerous.
And then I think the really challenging
part as we see all the costs
go up for insurance
is we're gonna see premium
increases.
What what is
maintainable? Um It's
for most of us, our largest asset.
So people are going to have
to get use as we see the cost
to repair and rebuild. Hier all
these costs going higher
and insurance companies have been
losing money
to adjust to higher premiums.
At the same time,
it's always been a concentrated
market. So there's always
been several companies
that have a large market
share. Um
State farm farmers
Allstate usa liberty
Mutual. Um
because the smaller companies
don't want to take as much risk
on, they can't afford to take as much
risk on. But as we continue
to explore mitigation
options, we
keep a viable,
good pressure valve release,
fair plan. These are
all things that help the
big companies and even the
smaller companies that now will
see New Mexico is
profitable and a good place to do
business and stay in the
marketplace. So,
um again, there's not
easy answers in this mitigation
isn't an easy answer. We've got
to scale that up. We're
working as superintendent
Cain said on legis working
with our file, uh fire
officials on ways to
bring down the risk because
that's ultimately the answer.
How do we bring down the risk
to keep confidence
in tourist companies that are in the
risk business? So hopefully,
that helps give you some context.
If not an answer to your
question, >> it gives me some context.
It doesn't give me any relief to
be quite honest with you. I think
that, you know, we,
we have the O I in
place because it's for the
regulatory purposes. So
where are we there with those
regulatory, you know,
mitigating the risk? Thank you.
That's, that's appropriate. But those
are, those are guidelines. We, we,
we have
to put in place from the federal
government as well because of all
the, the, the, the
forest fires and everything and we are
working on that. But
I don't, II, I
think I have more questions than
that Mr. Chair as far as
like,
there are other authorities too
that you should have at your
disposal that you're, you're working
with. And, um,
I think I'll just take this offline
with more questions for you, the
superintendent, but
this is a bigger issue for me
and, and with the
market as it is and what the
way I read into it. It's,
and we have a pressure volve with
fair, a fair plan,
but the fair plan is limited
and I don't know if that's bringing enough
relief to
our um our constituents
as needed. Mr. Chair. Thank
you. >> Um
Mr. Chair, I'm representative again,
if I can just maybe also
add a little color that
that might, might help a little
bit. Um Yeah, you,
you, you mentioned a
fair concern with
the concentration of
business that that's with
um your top companies.
But when I was looking
at the list of companies
that are here and active in the
State um
across both commercial and
personal lines, um That
number is over 50.
Um So there is
a robust market um
being involved.
Um I, I'd further
think that to the extent
that you're working well with your
insurance companies
on, on some of the
analytic pieces when
they're, when they're making
rate and you have an open
dialogue with them in terms
of how that's happening and
being built. Um
You'll also get a better response
from the um from the industry
in general. So,
um, you've got some good
tools, um I think in
place. Um But I recognize
the questions you're, you're raising
MS >> Richard. If I can respond
to that quickly, what I'm
hearing though, our premiums are going
to be going up. And what I'm hearing from
my community is that they can't afford
their insurance policies
and they need some relief.
So I'm just gonna leave it right there and
we can talk offline. Thank you, Mr.
Chair,
Sarah Woods. >> Mr.
Chair representative, can I just add
one comment? Uh The fair
plan uh has
doubled uh
over this last year in the
amount of policyholders. It
has just so it has
been providing some relief along
those lines. You know, what,
whether, whether we should do more
or not. II, I will say
one other thing I am very
sympathetic to the Senator
Mr. Chair uh about
the uh
the national
Forests and
how limited a
role the State can have
in cleaning them up. I've heard
that in
many areas.
II, I
don't know how to Trump
the federal government. I can
only do what we
can do, but I
think some of this, the
mitigation that we're talking about
in the high risk areas
will be helpful. We've
seen some homes, you
know, survive the wildfires
in uh in
uh Hawaii
and Lahaina. Uh
There's a, when we talked
to IBHS, there's a community
in Argentina the whole mountain went
up. But because there was mitigation
across the community,
about a look
like about 100 homes survived.
So again, it's
not 100% but it's
very powerful if we can
really be committed
to this level of mit that
we're talking about and it's
got to be focused, it's gotta
be community and it's got to be
individual and it's got to be
comprehensive. And once
we get that in, I think
we can go back and talk about
access and
perhaps cost if we can show
that that the loss
ratios can go down based
on, on that kind of
activity, which is
what we're trying to
do.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Uh
This is so
hard
to understand a
complicated industry
in, in a few minutes.
And
I think the key things to
remember Mr. Chair
is the duties
of the superintendent of
insurance and
it's listed on page four
here, uh some
of those duties
and
you know, they have to insurance
companies got to justify
the rates.
And
we see,
you know, I, I love the,
the statement
that was made about
the social
inflation.
I never thought about it
then
in those terms, but we
had that
brought up earlier
today on our
State uh
cost
of, of our
uh
risk management
ourselves,
of the social inflation
that's going on
through court
cost.
I was really
worried.
I I talked to the,
the Governor earlier
uh a few
days ago when she was
in Clovis
and she told me that,
that she
had an idea
how New
Mexico
could become
its own insurance
agency, insurance
company
and ensure
flood and
fire.
But essentially
that's,
that's what we have
already.
No,
maybe explain that
because it,
it took me my breath
away from me and
she told me we is going to self
inure this
deal. >> Mr.
Chair Senator, we are
looking at many alternatives
and we have been speaking with the
governor's office, but
the fair plan is
about is, is not
broad enough to
cover everything
that we're talking about. It
really is an insurer of last
resort and it does have that
$350,000
cap.
And so I
think that's, that's somewhat of
a different issue.
Uh I think the Governor is
very concerned about the area, the
high risk areas
where uh insurers
are, are non renewing
and canceling and
uh how, how we can
we really create a strong
enough mitigation program
to keep the market
vibrant there or is there
another approach
to, to respond to
Representative Lohan's
concern about people not
being able to afford
insurance, you know,
the insurance raises are
there, you know, what
should we be looking at to,
to sort of cover the whole
gamut? And
uh I I we're
trying to talk
about each entry point,
you know, cost access
mitigation,
whatever, but we don't, I
don't have a full plan
uh to, to solve
everything, but we are looking
at different approaches
with the governor's office and
on our own,
>> Mr. Chair, could I follow
up on this?
Just I caution you. Um,
again, I've been doing this a long
time and as you
look at examples of
states or the
country getting into
the insurance business beyond
a fair plan that isn't
funded by the State, it's funded
by its policies
and by the insurance companies, I'm
setting up one in Colorado right
now and it's based just
to get it up and going because we haven't sold
a single policy. It
is funded by
assessments on the insurance
companies. And then if you
have a huge catastrophe and you're
not taking in enough premium
with actu sound
rates from the fair
plan, the insurance companies
are on the hook for the money.
Um And that's what we've seen gone
wrong in a lot of states. It's what
we've seen gone wrong with the national
flooding insurance program at a
federal level where it's
always upwards of
$25 billion in
debt because there isn't a
political will to charge
the right rates, floodings
our most common natural disaster.
So I just caution you as
we're looking at. Yes, it's
good to have an insurer of last
resort, but an insurer of last
resort can drive the private market
out if it becomes an
insurer of choice
and then just wholesale
getting into the insurance
business, um,
is tricky, especially
for a State government. Um
And I don't just say tricky, I, I would
caution that there's a lot of
consequences that have been
played out over and over with
that. So, um, as we're
looking at solutions,
um you know, we can't necessarily
regulate our way out of this.
We have to be working as
partners with the private
industry to try to stay in
the marketplace, expand
the number of insurers you have
here and then bring,
bring, bring down, bend down
that risk. So, um just
on that note, I, I would caution
you to that. Uh, Mr. Chair,
Senator Woods, thank you
>> and Mr. Chair and
Senator. The, the other
observation I I would just
give that you can also reflect
on as you think about some
of those options.
Um In 2017
fema and the NF IP
decided to actually buy
reinsurance for the first
time. So the federal
government has
finally cotten on to the
fact that that our
industry can help them
by diversifying their
own set of financial tools
that they're using to manage that
portfolio and
not just simply rely
on debt and
taxpayers and
often around the
globe, um on,
on public
facilities that have been set
up often
where they go wrong.
Uh in part is
their reliance on
debt taxes and assessments
to fix things when they
go horribly
wrong.
>> Mr. Chair and Senators and
Representative, we are we are,
we have also been talking to Guy
Carpenter about their
experiences both globally
and, and in other states
about some approaches that we,
we are looking at.
So we're trying to get information
broad-based
to see if there's some,
some solutions that we can
bring to this problem.
I don't have one
right
now,
>> Mr. Chair. As you
know, you've, you've heard
my, I'm, I'm talking
to the choir again
and I apologize to
you off the
start.
The State does a very
poor job of
risk management
and we
see it in their
self-insured
health
group
that we're now having
supplement again
after pouring
100 million in last
year, they're
already, well, we're
talking about that in a little
bit.
Everything's
good
if you operate
like an insurance
company,
create a
reserve
and then if that reserve
starts falling.
And anyway,
I, I don't need to explain the
insurance to you
guys.
I can't
see
if, if we go
by your principles
here.
I know
that insurance
costs are
higher to insure my
residence
in Curry
County
because
of the threat of the health
and the lost
premium are the
losses they've had in those
areas over the last couple
of years. Some
of those, some of
those houses
were just rooked
before the next hail
came
and then we had to rew
roof them again.
And, and
you know, the only
people that make money on
that is the roofer
and he does,
well,
he does a lot of
work,
but I am very
reluctant and
I, I, your
boss told me you was the smartest
lady in the State.
So I've got
great confidence in
you
that are costing you just,
it's, it's a, it's a
tough game to try
to try
to solve
all State problems
with government
or maybe I
should say
solve all State
problems with oil and gas
money
because that's where
50% of our money
comes from.
And we're worried
all over
that, that
market May turn
down and all of
a sudden our economy
goes with it.
So
I'm not gonna beat
this horse any
further,
but Mr. Chair, I'm,
I'm very concerned.
I realize that
premiums are gonna go
up in areas where
there are high losses. It happens
to me where I
live
and
there are
mitigations that we can
do.
I'm also concerned
when II I, the
reason I even started this
conversation and the
reason that uh
the State Forester invited
me to your meeting
was because I made a statement
one time
about a public
utilities,
electric utilities
that had
lines going,
transmission lines
going for miles
and miles and
miles.
And then
those lines go down
somewhere
somehow,
probably an act to God.
But who knows?
I was trying to figure out a
way
to give them some
relief
if they were
following certain
parameters,
poll replacements,
maintaining the right of
ways, doing things
to mitigate
their cost
and keeping them out
of the
social
inflation. You're talking
about
the deal that you have
with our own
mitigation is
the same deal.
If we can show these
insurance companies
that we are doing something,
the homeowner is doing
something to,
to limit
their laws, limit
their
uh risk.
Then the insurance companies
should appreciate
that and
allow something
to the credit on their
premium. And that
was a very good
presentation
and it was, it, it should
be watched by all.
So
somewhere in the
middle,
I agree that there, there
should be some
workable solutions
here. Uh
And, and III
I, I'm willing
to look at that and I hope
the insurance companies are willing
to look at that, but I
had a little
heartburn
when the Governor come out
with a health
order
that said
an insurance company could
not
close out a
policy
for not for
non-payment
of the
policy.
And I thought that
was carrying us
deal a little bit too
far. It's
a contract law
and how you just wipe
out contract law with
the,
with the order
like that is was
beyond me,
but
you know, everything's beyond
me.
So thank you,
Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you. We're gonna kind of wrap this
up and I'll try to get a representing
pedigree but,
but I mean, this
is, you know, II I deal
with a lot of interesting in
insurance and,
and I live
in an, I'll tell you the story exactly.
I live in a place where there's no
wildfires. Right.
Two commercial properties right
next door to each other.
Renewal on one.
Right. No claims. No,
nothing. Oh, we're not renewing
the other because of wildfires.
What wildfire on 40
ft from a hydrant. Right.
And this and
these insurance companies
are just doing whatever they
want.
It's a plain fact
that the reason for
cancellations, denials,
non renewals are
based on whatever they want at the
time they want
to do it. And
it's based on a lot of
the, the
brokers that do
this one
broker says I can't get you insurance
from that company. You go to
the other broker and he can get you the
insurance from that company,
the exact policy that you
want. Right. And it's
based upon what margins that they're
gonna make off that broker
and, and
uh what they're gonna make on the
policy
policy increases happen
every single year. Right.
Just count on
68%
right. No claims. No, nothing.
You're gonna have a policy increase.
68%. I
bet anybody that
hasn't had one in this room is
probably a liar. Even if
they had no claims. Right. No
matter where you lived. If you lived in a
cave, they'd still
increase your insurance with
no risk.
They just do it
right. And I look at the
margins in 2021.
Right? And you
had 63%
loss runs right
on a $4
billion net
sales. So your
margins were still
1.61 0.8
billion. Right? I'm gonna take some
operating costs out of
there, but the margins are
still there to make money and be
profitable.
A list. Look at the s
the superintendent
and she has to file a restraining
order against the
largest carrier in the State of
New Mexico to do
what's probably in the policy
somewhere, right? But they
probably wouldn't do
it.
So, I, I
mean,
at some point this is going to get come
to a correction.
So, um, madam
superintendent, I
want to know what statutory
changes you need
so you can get the
information.
There has to be a cat
somewhere
and I know she's batting her eyes
on the insurance company. But I, I
mean, people have had enough,
right? I can tell
you my commercial insurance
in, in, in the
construction industry where
I'm sitting on claims from the
insurance from
a year ago
and they're just sitting there twiddling their
thumbs.
Right. And, and there are
large numbers and I pay,
we pay a lot of money
in insurance. I mean, that policy
is 100 and $50,000
a year
and they're just sitting there twiddling their
thumbs. You make a
claim at your
house,
they're gonna tell you no, the
first time, right?
Until you can figure out how
to push that insurance
company to pay the
claim. They'll say,
well, where's your policy? Right.
Well, where's the original policy?
Well, that's not the original policy we gave
you. And then, so where's that?
Oh, you want to copy the original policy?
Well, that's $35
and, and we'll stick it in the
mail.
I mean, most
insurance companies hub is
owned by
AAA hedge
fund, right?
Hedge funds have to make a
large margins to make their
investors happy
and we know where the game
is and, and where the money is
going. But
meanwhile, you burn a
house down in
something natural disaster,
right? And
they're going to deny the claim.
>> Senator
Mr. Chair, Senator.
We are trying, I think
that's why we have our whole
claims group and
that's why we're asking people to
bring their complaints
to us. So we can,
and many times we hear
about complaints, but people don't
file a complaint with us
and we can't get the information
until the complaint is filed
and then we can go in and ask
for the information
and, and
we, you know, based
on what we find, uh we
will, uh we will
have the insurance companies
comply with what the policy
says and, and what's
required. I mean, I
have no trouble doing
that as you
have just seen.
Um And,
and honestly, I think
one of the problems O SI has
is a lot of individuals
don't know we exist and we don't
get, you know, you get the phone
calls, we don't get the complaints
the more we get the complaints, the more
active we can be we have,
you know, so, so
please, uh I
would, and I would say
that uh the
uh the team that we
had up in Riodosa has
been very helpful
with all the companies
and the companies have been
very,
most, most of them have. We've
not had a problem with. If I had
even a slight problem, I've made a phone
call and they've adjusted their
policies. So,
uh I, I think
they've been incredibly
supportive of the people in
Riodosa. So
there are times when the insurance
companies have to be
held to
a standard and there are other times
they've stepped up and I would
say that in Riodosa,
most of the companies have
been incredibly
co-operative and incredibly
sympathetic. Uh They've
had people there just as long
as my people have been there.
So, uh I would like
to say, you
know, give credit where credit
is due. I
certainly,
you know, where credit is not due, I will
bring it to your
attention, but where it is due,
I would like to give them
credit. >> But isn't that
way we pay our policies for
service,
>> Mr. Chair? You're absolutely correct.
But sometimes people go beyond
beyond. And I
think by setting
up their, you know, setting up
their, their buses, their people
are there, they've been washed away
like my people had
by the floods and had to go,
you know, evacuate themselves.
So I I think,
uh, yes, it is what you pay for,
but they are meeting
our expectations, if not
more,
>> you know, Senator Woods mentioned the
Governor and, and wanting to do a
policy, I mean, for
these people or these people
who claims or just
take my, my
commercial property and then
you are in a, we're not
insuring you because you're in a wildfire
area. Right?
Once that word gets around, you're
not getting insurance
anywhere,
>> Mr. Chair from what I
understand in the
marketplace, there are
places I
think a little bit of the
exchange that you and I had
a few months ago, had
more to do with the agent
wanting control of your
account than the actual
availability of insurance.
But, but we didn't, we
weren't able to get that
deeply into that. I I
think you're absolutely correct. There
was another story
going on there, not
back at the insurance
company.
>> Yeah, but if we, if
someone, if a claims paid
out today and just say whoever
all stay
pays out a claim on a home
and the person says I have a
contractor, we're gonna rebuild
within six months
to a year, right?
And they rebuild
and the value of the
homes and just say
it's 500,000
and, and they say, ok, I need
insurance. Insurance is
gonna come to them and say we already
paid that claim once we don't want
to reinsure you, right
and deny that claim because you're in
a wildfire area and rebuilt
in a wildfire area.
And so then what do we
do? >> I think that
there's a real issue about the
areas that are high
risk and how we
can
uh lower
the risk of the. So the
insurance companies will write.
And I think some of that has to do
with the level, the way it's
rebuilt, the hardening of the home
and what's going on in the
community. But there are high risk
areas that we're, we have to respond
to the industry about and
that's what we're trying to do. That's why
we've been working with IBHS.
That's why we're talking about in
certifications
that would allow
the insurance companies to be comfortable
that the home has been
hardened, that the community
has been hardened and that they
keep up that
effort. And,
uh hopefully,
uh, as we, you know,
we are working with IBHS
to see what the insurance
industry would accept
to go back into those
areas.
>> What's their comments
for the insurance to go back into
those areas? >> We haven't.
I said we're working with them. I, I
don't have an answer yet.
They seem to be rather
open to the
discussion. I think,
uh, when we've
been working with guy carpenter too
to find out some of the things that they
found in other areas that have
worked. It's worked
in, uh, in some of
the flood, uh,
the flood areas in the south
when there's been hardening of the homes
and the insurers have gone
back. So
that's what we're looking at. Wildfire's
a different, you know, we're,
we're, uh, mitigating for
a different risk. But can we
get the, and there's a
lot, the science
in wildfires is
behind the science and
floods because floods have been around
for a while. Wildfires
haven't really been a big risk
until about 10 or 12 years
ago. And in
areas where there was population
and homes, it's obviously
been in the forest.
And so that's
that knowledge is coming,
is coming through and getting
more
accepted.
>> And so as we mov'e towards our next
hearing on insurance,
I'm so sorry as we mov'e towards
our next hearing on insurance,
right? I want to see
what statutory changes you
need to get to, to
get that information.
Right. And
then you know,
the average person and just take an
elderly person that's on,
on a,
on a fixed income.
Right. Her husband
worked hard and she has a
$500,000 home
and her insurance goes
up annually by
6% a year and it's
probably a $3000
policy right
in there. I mean, she's
gonna be out of the market pretty
quick on a fixed income.
And even even if the
person has a smaller home or even
a mobile home, right? I
if mobile
home, you know,
in Riodosa, a whole
trailer park of mobile
homes blocked
out insurance is
not going to come back and look at those mobile
homes and say we built the
structure at a
higher rating. I mean, you can even
sprinkler the mobile home and it
wouldn't matter.
Uh, but that's
the things we're really gonna have to look
at in the, in the wildfire
areas and then
statutory control
of, of some of these insurance
companies just saying we're
not gonna cover you
for any reason,
even though the reason doesn't
apply, whether
it's commercial
or it's residential.
Just saying we're not gonna cover
you when you're not even
affected
it, it is not going
to be a reason anymore for
denial or
non
renewal.
I mean, it's just
not fair to people,
right?
>> I understand your frustration,
Mr. >> Chair. Well, it's not my
frustration. It's,
if I live it, let me tell you
if I live this,
right? And
the commercial property you're talking about is
a mobile home park that I own,
right? If I
see a doubling of
insurance in cost, what
do you think I have to do?
Right? I have to raise the
rent and I,
I haven't raised rent in
six or seven years
right through COVID or
anything.
And so as those
insurance premiums
went higher, I I
didn't raise rents, but
we to the point now
you're gonna deny me for absolutely
no reason.
Right?
Because as you say, I live in a
wildfire, then I live in gallop.
So, you know,
and you say you're gonna die because
you're in a wildfire. I mean, that's just an
excuse for the insurance company not
to write the policy. I mean, either
don't do business in New
Mexico,
right? Or do business
correctly
and, and that's gonna be the
message we're gonna have to send out
to them and
try to do statutory changes.
So you have the authority to,
to, to, to find
them, to get the
information you need
and start looking on on how we
really inure this. Because
if you take
Riodosa
and you take
that workforce
out of Randos, so that
can't afford
uh a
concrete home
or a reinforced
home against fire,
then you take the workforce
out of the community and
once the workforce is gone, the
community is gone.
And so as
you rebuild,
these are all questions
we're gonna have to answer over
the next
four or five months. So as you go to the
Session, we can
get a handle on some of this. I
mean, you
could not even be in the fire zone
and, and they'll use that for an excuse.
So
I think we got a lot of work to do
ahead on insurance. I I
know the risks across the nation
are, are high and
weather related events are high.
And you mentioned New
Mexico May mov'e into that
red. Uh
It'll be interesting to see what they
do uh
because the fires in the north
didn't claim as many homes as they
did. In the south.
And so the damage to the cost
in the house, the south is
higher because those homes
had a higher value too.
And so those
are something, those are all
factors we're gonna start really
digging into as, as
we mov'e forward. And
I don't know if the State can mitigate
that, but I don't think so, but
maybe on the lower
end it could
look at something like that and get
the banks to accept that
as, as
certified insurance so that
if you bought
a mobile home back
that you could get that insured through the
State if, if the
market wasn't
available. Um
So there's, there's just
options, we're gonna have to get
people
and they May get back on their feet and
May be able to afford commercial
insurance again.
If not, we May have to keep them on the
State plan, but we
got to fix some of these things.
And so if we don't do that,
then we're kind of
not doing our
job,
>> Mr. Chair. It's a very, it's a
very difficult situation
having been in Riodosa
myself and see
that, that
uh uh you know, the the
trailer community
and many of them
probably didn't even have
insurance
>> represent a small
>> thank you, Mr. Chair. I have
very brief questions.
The first
one
for uh I
guess for, for the
industry representatives
and also superintendent
Cain 2023
pointed to as sort of
the the worst.
So far, it
seems like there's an
expectation and
a fear that future
years will eclipse
what 2023
did sort of nationally.
Is that your, is
that the insurance, is that the industry
perspective,
>> Mr. Chair representative,
the, we're
talking about the models and I
guess my, you know,
you probably be better at
that, but we did have a meeting in the,
with the western zone of insurance
commissioners about the models
and the models used to be
the past was predictive of
the future. The
past is no longer predictive
of the future where in
a whole new world
of
climate change, whatever you
want to call it.
And uh >> that's
right. I just want and I know time is
short.
>> The answer is yes, you're
correct. >> And it's
not, I think we're,
we are moved past the
point of sort of belief,
perception, etcetera.
Um We know
it's an uncertain, I think
we have to, we
want the best
available
information
and nobody more
vested than some
of the largest private
sector stakeholders
to give us a sense of
what the risk
is. We know it's gonna
be bigger than what's past
us. We can't
say exactly what it
is. But I think
that sense of scope
and Mr. Chair, this
brings me to some of the
conversations around defensible
space which is
critical and
super, I think sort of
anecdotally talking about
communities that have done a better
job.
What I what, what
frankly, Mr. Chair just
really terrifies
me is that
we mov'e into this place
of doing the best job that we
can. And it
seems like what I hear
is instead
of, you know,
uh, God forbid
things like paradise in
California where entire
communities with
dozens scores, if
not more people losing
their lives, that
it's a little
bit less or maybe
significantly less, but
it's still
destruction on a scale
that we haven't really
reckoned with.
And that's
as much of, sort of
a sharing of my
concerns as it is a
question. I
welcome if there's sort
of um
yeah, I think that's just the sharing
of the, of the concern. The a
question here
um
is
from the private
sector side,
you know, New Mexico just
over the past 34
years in broad and bipartisan
fashion has committed and
invested the
largest sums we've ever
thought about much less
committed to
watershed restoration,
forest management
and better
sort of natural resource
stewardship. Thanks in large
part to many of the Committee
Members you see here.
Um as we
do those sorts of things
as a State, I
think what we want to see
from the insurance markets
is a commitment to
work hand in hand.
Sounds like sort of the riodosa
model, right? You know,
continue to work hand in hand.
It's a challenging place.
That's what maybe
I would ask for in
this conversation
is a commitment to
stay. And
as we make the
necessary investments
as we do the necessary
sorts of policies,
>> Chairman,
and
>> there was just one thing I wanted to
follow up on that.
Um Thank you,
Mr. Chair representative
small is um
paradise. Actually in their
rebuilding has adopted the
IBHS building
code um similar in
Marin County in California.
So there's some things being done right in
California. Yeah. And we've really
tried to as a coalition
working with O SI
with New Mexico State forestry,
the fire Marshal to
identify what are some of the
things that we think could
make a big difference.
Um Industry is working
side by side on that coalition
of OK,
things like to the
IBHS building code.
Um The superintendent
brought um strengthen
Alabama the
program that when we had the
crisis on the coast
where they really invested
in the wind mitigation that
IBHS was doing.
So I think that um we
absolutely, the industry is committed
to that. And at the same time, I think
we have some examples
that we can use to get it
right in New Mexico. So I'm sorry,
Jonathan, go ahead
>> and, and um
all I'd add,
it's
a with the examples you're
hearing and, and I've heard them all
before um to solve
some of these issues, multifaceted
solutions are, are going to be
required. Um
We're working
very hard trying to
find, you know,
we, we applaud
the, the mitigation
dollars that have begun to
flow from the federal government
and, and I'm sure you've all
seen the studies where,
you know, for every dollar of
mitigation investment
is made, you're
saving 8 to
12 odd dollars
in in future losses.
What's not happening is they're not
pairing that though
with risk
transfer and
risk management
strategies
because things still go
wrong. Uh
Every time that we're out
talking with states, we, we
have no problem, there's a lot of interest
in some of the ideas that we're coming
up with. We do run
into funding
constraints and there's a
reliance right now
that people are
relying on the Stafford Act
and they're relying on fema and
they're relying on disaster risk
dollars to basically
take care of things
when they go off the
rails. Um
We, we got to find a way
to increase.
I would argue the ties
between our
industry and
government to
get at um
some of the uh
examples um
Mr. Chair you've made
and we, we hear it after
every major C A
event
everywhere we're working.
Um There's an industry
on our side and we see it when we're
talking with reinsurers. There,
there, there are people
that see
the value of trying to
come up with some of these different
approaches and who want to
lean in.
Um uh
my personal
feeling, uh
It's not just what's
happening at the federal
side of the equation.
Um States
and large cities in particular
need to do more,
they can influence their
constituents.
They're in a position to talk
much more clearly to them as
to what they're
doing to mitigate
issues around whether it be
flood, whether it be
wildfire.
Um to the
extent you all
are engaging in risk
transfer, you can better
communicate to, to
folks like, don't
rely on fa
the the amount of
dollar dollars
you'll get as an
individual
totally
insufficient.
So again,
there's not really an answer
there other than
to say to you that
we absolutely see a
willingness
from not
all but certainly a contingent
of people in our industry that
want to try to find a path
through that and, and take
new approaches,
>> Mr. Chair. Thank you both
for that and superintendent
Cain, who we have,
I think a great deal of
confidence in, in her
team.
Um
The
uh sort of,
you know, that that's
very positive to hear
or important to hear rather.
Um I think
my last question
and obviously, there's a lot to
mov'e forward from
in terms of great
the the fullest amount of
transparency
into
sort of both the
the insurance market as
it property insurance market as
it always
functions. And
now in this sort of
increasing tempo
of very
severe crises or
disasters or challenges,
are there additional
legislative
transparency components,
understanding and very much
appreciating that,
you know, while regulatory
uh risk is
far below climate, it
is still one of the core things
that you've mentioned. And it's
important for us to
not operate in
vacuums
would invite if there
are, if there's any additional
transparency pieces
that you all are thinking of.
And superintendent, you're
considering super
helpful for us
and to take away
sort of that call to
potentially
look at integration
between that public
and you know,
private sector side
in this, you know,
increasingly challenging future.
It's a super interesting call and
request and I >> appreciate
it, Mr. Chair representative, I
think transparency is
where we we
both sides need
to feel that we're moving forward
in the right way and there's
nothing being
hidden. I would
also want to say that there was
a lot of success. The
way people have looked at this on the flood
areas in the southern States
is yes, they've done
mitigation. But there's been
grants for people who couldn't
afford to mitigate, you
know, do the mitigation that was
required in hardening the
houses. There's been building
codes that were accepted.
So let
us come down, come with a
list of comprehensive
things that we could check and
say if, if we could get all this
together. Because I think
uh, Senator Woods, when
you were at our meeting,
we talked about some of these and
you basically said,
bring, bring it,
bring it to us simply
and let's talk about the areas
that we do have some control
over and
uh we're trying to
get, we don't have that
yet. We're working on it, but
that is something we are, we
are looking at. >> Got it.
Thank you very much. Thank
you. Thank you very much >> Mr.
Chair and thank you for
your time. You
know, Mr. Chair, everyone
around this table. This is
this is a a
hard problem that
we all need to solve
together and I really do
appreciate your
time.
>> Ok? Thank you guys.
Thank you for being here today and
hopefully no more cloud seeing,
right?
Thank
you.
>> Next time. File an official
complaint. Let me get in there.
>> Ok.
Everybody has directions to the
reception correct?
Tomorrow mornings at 7
a.m. Representative
Chatfield said he's going was the bus
himself
meet outside at 730
or meet out these
front doors? Which
doors?
730.
I, you want to wash your bus at seven?
Which set of doors? Charles when we mean
the front parking lot. It's that
way I think
right
where people came in and
parking.
Ok, we'll meet in that parking
lot. 730 bus leaves
at
745.
Which part,
the one you parked
in? Yeah.
