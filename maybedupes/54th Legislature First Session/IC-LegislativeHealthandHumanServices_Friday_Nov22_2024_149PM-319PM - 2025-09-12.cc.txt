not, I'm an advisory member, but
I would be happy to help Senator
Munoz with this. This is a $1
billion behavioral health trust
fund. It did make the newspaper,
it would cover many things. It's
so it would create a long term
investment in behavioral health
and as Eric uh Chenier,
uh, indicated in his report,
this needs to be a regional
buildup that would be included
in the money as well.
is capital as well as services,
and it would be very flexible
and be able to match federal,
state, and local funding, and
Senator Munoz is the one who
came up with this idea.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We know that we spent over a
billion dollars a year annually
on behavioral health and and it
hasn't really moved the needle
in any way, shape, or form.
And as we look towards this
coming session.
We're coming up with a plan that
starts a behavioral health fund
allows.
Every trigger and mechanism that
you can think of, whether it's
um regional services, the money
to not buy.
Build buildings, but to rent
buildings, startup capital, um,
court systems, police training
and as we start that up, we need
a recurring revenue source and
recurring revenue source is more
important than than anything
than starting something and
stopping it and and it never
will succeed.
As we think of this, this is the
The monster that feeds the the
needs of uh that has to happen.
And so we have the money, we
have the flexibility right now.
We know that this is a number
one issue across the state of
New Mexico.
Whether it leads to crime,
homelessness,
Um, even just in schools or just
what people are dealing with in
their family, and so we in New
Mexico, all of us are gonna have
to build this system and we're
gonna have to build it
correctly. It was torn down in
the Martinez administration, and
it's never come back the way it
needs to come back, so we're
here, uh, seeking endorsement
for a behavioral health form.
But trust fund. Mr. Chair,
members of the committee, I
think you all got a one pager on
about it and I would, I can't
make the motion.
And share, can I make a motion
for, uh, will you approve this
bill for endorsement.
No, I'm not. I'm not either.
Madam Chair, I'll make the
motion. I am a voting member
that the bill be accepted for
endorsement, and I apologize.
How large is the fund?
Great.
So that would be generating
what, how much annually.
40 to 50 million, about 50
billion for 50 million 50
million then 50 million.
OK. Is there any, any opposition
to endorsing this bill?
Seeing then. Thank you. Thanks
for doing this. It's a great
idea. Yeah, thank you. And Mr.
Chair, just a reminder, the
voting members are the chair,
myself, Rep Chavis, Rep Herndon,
uh, Senator Hickey, Senator
Sadil Lopez, um, Senator
Gallegos and Rep Jones, so.
All right, Mr. Chair, well, uh,
and Andrea and I are gonna take
on the rest of this, um,
So, uh, moving on to the next
bill, uh for consideration for
endorsement. We have uh the snap
outreach program, give Grace a
second to put it up on the
screen.
So, um, this is basically
setting up a framework. This is
already being done in the state,
the Snap outreach programs. We
heard about them in Socorro, and
it's uh nonprofit groups go out
and get people signed up for
Snap, basically, um, but there's
federal support that you can get
to help those programs, and this
is a framework to ensure that
this program continues in the
state. And uh Representative
Thompson is the sponsor, so I'll
give her a chance.
Voted to pass.
I guess I will make the motion
for a DuPin. It's.
Adoption. Thank you, Gail.
I have a question, Mr. Chair. Is
this like a PEOsa kind of
concept where anybody around the
state who's in a facility can
You know, like an office of
doctor's office can sign people
up.
Or what, is this just outreach?
This is, uh, sorry, Mr. Chair,
this is more outreach, um, it's,
it's gonna be organizations
partnering with the healthcare
authority, um, and they're gonna
be getting federal dollars to do
this outreach, uh, so I mean, I
guess an office could do this,
but generally it's going to be
more of the food banks and and
and people like that who are
doing this outreach. Well, I'm
just asking that so people don't
have to go to different places
to sign up. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, they
can, they help them sign up
online. Mr. Chairman.
Just a quick question.
Representative Martinez, thank
you, Mr. Chairman. So this will
be
Federal funds, so there's no
cost to the state. Uh, Mr.
Chair, yeah, there's, um,
actually a provision, it's uh,
the very end of the bill that
allows the authority to not do
one of these state outreach, uh,
plans in a given year if they
don't have enough federal funds
or they're allowed to take
private donations as well, but
it, but it, it makes it so the
state doesn't have to cover
this.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Any other questions?
You want to make a motion?
We already did. That's right.
Is there any opposition to
considering this to be an
endorsed bill.
Seeing none will
Put a little check mark by that
one too.
Number 3
Adult changing tables required
in public buildings,
Representative Gates.
And I, I'll just briefly, um,
say, so this bill, the main
thrust of it is to require uh
facilities and entities that
receive state funding to have an
adult changing table in the
building. Um, and so it, it,
it'll happen over a, a few years
of implementation, so it's going
to give uh these places time to
uh install an adult changing
table, um, but that's generally
the idea of the bill and and all
that Representative Kate speak a
little bit on it.
Thank you, cheers and thank you,
Xander. So, um, for those of us
like during the Obama
administration, we had a CMS
final quiting adults with
disabilities to be in the
community for 80% of the time,
um, and so how do you do that,
um, there's many barriers, but
one is not having these adult
changing tables. This bill will
be uh providing more the carrot
than the stick, um, now we're
gonna be providing
An allowance for any public
owned buildings with unisex with
at least one unisex bathroom
that they would be able to um
get a flat amount of money to be
able to install a hydraulic
changing table, you have a one
sheet here. I do have expert
witnesses if you have technical
questions and um and then also
we know that the um
We are trying to increase um our
tourism dollars by making
accessibility for everybody of
all abilities, so this is uh uh
uh ongoing plans to be able to
put this out on our state
website so that uh tourism can
increase with people of all
abilities and their families.
Thank you.
Oh
Questions Representative.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um,
takes you said that these would
be installed in public
buildings.
Um
But I'm showing look on the, I
guess, the 2nd page,
locations to install universal
changing tables, shopping malls.
Arena stadiums, airports.
Uh, YMCAs.
Yeah, thank you, thank you,
Representative. Thank you,
chair. Um, so this page is from
the national effort.
It is not specific to our bill.
Our bill we are asking for any
um public buildings of having uh
a pass through of 2500
individuals per week or more. So
their government owned buildings
and then they're also um public
areas that have been government
funded like the isotope stadium.
We want to see an adult changing
table there or the balloon
fiesta Museum. So this is just a
generic uh uh national program.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Representative Kate.
Are there a lot of companies
that make these or just this
one. Mr. Chair, I had one
installed in a 2018 using a
community development block
grant funds in a facility that I
was running, and uh there's a
whole variety of them, um, uh,
we abs, I mean, we want ones
that are of quality that can
last and that are hydraulic
because some individuals may be
using them for themselves as
well, and so they have to be
lowered.
enough to get from their
wheelchair onto the table. Any
other questions?
Did you want to make a motion
representative?
Oh, that's right,
I move that we um
Approve this.
But adopt this name. Where,
where are you going, Gail?
You're not gonna leave us, are
you?
I can hear you.
Seconded by Representative
Chavez. Any, any objection to
endorsing this?
Seeing none, we'll put a check.
Um
Senator Stephanics, PBM
regulations.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, in
2023, we passed a bill that
would protect about 15% of our
population who are on private
insurance, but this bill would
amend the pharmacy benefits
manager regulation Act to limit
certain fees and actions by
PBMs. It aims to protect
pharmacies and consumers by
addressing unfair trade
practices within the PBM
operations. It supports
Independent pharmacies by
providing clearer regulations
and reducing exploitative TBM
practices.
The bill explicitly addresses
unfair trade practices, ensuring
PBM's operate transparently and
equitably.
It enhances oversight to
mitigate conflicts of interest.
Now we started with our bill,
which is a good uh protection,
but we need to continue it. This
would define PBM as an
administrative function, and
that's why the uh OSI could then
be looking at the fees that the
PBMs are charging.
And that is what this bill does.
It was developed with the
Superintendent of Insurance,
Doctor Mccanini, Presbyterian,
and several healthcare
providers.
Any questions?
Any discussion.
She can make a motion, OK.
You can make a motion,
Senator I move
adoption.
Endorsement of the legislation
proposed legislation, OK.
I'll second that. Is there any
discussion, any further
discussion?
Any opposition.
OK
See none will.
Consider that to have been added
to the list of endorsed bills
and move on to number
5.
Representative Ferrari, allowing
PAs to certify deaths.
Um, thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh,
yeah, it's pretty simple, that's
title really explains what it
does, uh, this is a weird gap
that we have in the system and
currently PAs are not able to
certify deaths, um, and this
would allow them to do that.
I'd like to add, Mr. Chair, that
we do include um uh the
assistance.
Yes.
Yeah
Yeah. Physician's assistant and
Yeah,
oh, OK. Yeah,
that's what I was trying to say
it's just for positions
right, yes.
Any questions?
You want to make a motion,
Representative?
Mhm
Oh you know what I mean.
Mm
Mr. Chair, I move that we
endorse the legislation.
So we have a motion in a second
to add this to the list. Is
there any objection?
Singan will will do that. We'll
add it to the list.
And we move to number 6.
Representative Jones, allowing
PA what we really zeroed in on
PA sir, didn't we? That's great.
Uh, allowing PAs to practice
independently.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. um, Mr.
Chair, um, can you close your
mic of course speak up like
you're in session. OK. I'll try.
This bill, um,
It's a little bit more than
having them practice
independently because they
already do that based on uh
Representative Thompson's bill
that was passed, I think in
2019. They do practice
independently, especially in
rural areas. This is a measure
to um protect access to care,
and what this bill would do is,
is give
physician's assistants the same
ability to practice that we've
already given to nurse
practitioners. It really just
confirms what they're doing in a
lot of our rural areas, and it
ensures that if their physician
that they are um connected with
uh would leave that they can
continue their practice in
providing care.
T.
I.
Are there any um discussion, is
there any discussion or?
So you could make the motion
Representative Jones. I make a
motion that we accept this
legislation for endorsement.
Is there any, uh, a second?
One second.
Um, in the opposition.
See none
add this to the list.
No, no
And then, uh, thank you, Madam
Chair. Um, so, uh, the next one,
also from Representative Jones
on physician assistants, this
one, allows uh like experienced
physician assistants to
supervise uh newer physician
assistants instead of having a
uh a like an actual physician uh
supervising them and uh go
aheadsentative Jones.
Um,
just another bill to um help
with access to care, uh, part of
the issue here is that uh there
aren't enough physicians, that's
what I'm, I'm told to to train
physicians' assistants and so
that has been an issue,
especially in rural New Mexico.
So where these physicians
assistants are already
practicing, have been for years.
This bill would allow them to
train other PAs.
Um, so make, make a motion to
prove this for endorsement.
Is there a second
or somebody has to make a move.
No, she's on, she is, she's she
so we have the second, um, any
discussion or questions?
Any objections to adding this to
the list of endorsed bills.
Seeing no
Seeing them will consider it to
be uh uh uh endorsed.
And now Representative Thompson,
funding for health councils.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, yeah,
so this, uh, gives a, a
significant chunk of funding to
the county and tribal health
councils, um, to really help
them expand those programs that
have been really underfunded uh
in the past.
And Mr. Chair, we'll just add
that um since we
are uncertain about what will
happen with public health on the
federal level.
This is even more important than
it already was.
And I will make a motion to uh
Um, endorse it.
And the definition of
significant chunk is 43 million
that's lower than the billion
from the first bill, so we're
cheap.
So we have a motion in a second
to endorse uh 43 million for the
uh
County and tribal councils, any,
any debate about that?
Any opposition.
To endorsing it
Moving right along.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members
of the committee, the next bill
up on the roster is one that um
is being sponsored by
Representative Hochman V. Hill,
and with this bill would do is
it would create two
classifications of advanced
practice, chiropractors and it
would would allow those
chiropractic physicians to
prescribe dangerous drugs.
And um there would be a
registry, uh, to keep track of
these folks and um that's
essentially the thrust of the
bill.
And it's, it's essentially the
one that was presented to us
when the chiropractors uh came
before us in, Mr. Chair.
Yeah.
OK. We have a motion.
Representative Martinez.
This is the, this is the bill
that um
I had a a.
Long discussion with um
In Rio Rancho.
I, I
opposed this bill then because
These chiropractors are able to
take a shortcut.
And not have to put in the hours
to get the training.
Um, I know I'm not a voting
member, but
Still opposed to it. I still
haven't been convinced.
Otherwise
Um, point of fact, Mr. Chair,
and um have its minority with uh
Martinez. I'm not advocating for
the bill. I'm just providing,
you know, technical knowledge
here and the bill does provide
for additional training for
those uh chiropractic physicians
to obtain that classification
and join the register and
prescribe.
Is the, is the language of the
bill available online?
Uh, it's online. Do you want us
to, to move past it to give you
a chance to look it up?
But while he's doing that one or
2. OK, thank you, Mr. Chair. So
I received a call from um
Not to name names, but someone
who's intimately involved with a
different group of chiropractors
who said, please do not pass
this bill because chiropractors
do not have the anatomy,
physiology, the training to
become prescribers, so he's, he
requested that I not um
Not be in favor of it, and I
have those same concerns.
And, and I will say again that
there's not a single
chiropractic school in this
country that's related, that's
attached or related to a um
Medical school. So you have to
think about that. Thank you. So
I'm a no too.
So that
Mr. uh, Chair, I'm not in favor
of this bill either. I'm
concerned about chiropractors
being primary is there anyone in
the committee who wants to make
a motion to endorse it.
OK, I think we, we've moved past
it then, we don't have a motion
to endorse.
Um
Number 10, alcohol harms
alleviation representative
Ferrari.
And uh thank you, Mr. Chair. I,
I know Representative Ferrari is
a very passionate about this
one, so I will uh let her speak
on it cause I didn't draft it,
so I don't want to say anything
wrong.
OK, um.
And 25 words or less, right? um.
What, um, so do you because most
people are familiar with the
statistics, um, about how
alcohol in New Mexico were
almost 3 times the number of uh
alcohol-related deaths and, and
then the national average, and
it is impacting so many
different things, gun violence,
um, cirrhosis of the liver, um,
Um
Just all the different domestic
violence, uh, crime, car
accidents, I should say crashes,
accidents is not the right word,
um, because they can be
prevented and other health
problems. But um what we um have
come to realize is um with other
bills trying to.
Increase the alcohol excise tax
to do it by retailers or the
distributor level increasing the
excise tax.
To inflation.
From since 1994 to now 30 years,
we, um, would
Raise it to inflation, and then
rely on what they're calling a
modernized uh tax that um other
people consider not regressive,
um, by having a sales point of
sales tax. Um, and then the two
together would help us raise 200
to $250 million a year.
Um, that could be used for
prevention, treatment, recovery,
of a whole list of different
programs in our state that
already exist and need more
expansion as well as for um
expansion of Medicaid and
behavioral health.
Uh, funding.
And so,
This is um something that I
think our state um will help a
lot of different things.
Um
That we're we're just coming up
against our um adverse childhood
experiences and so that
education can do a better job
when they don't have a domestic
violence at home or child abuse,
um, different things that stress
our kids, so they can't learn,
make it so that we have reduced
crime and gun violence and um
fatalities of our um most
important age group of
workforce, um, that we can
help prevent. It costs our state
nearly $4 per drink and all
we're asking is, um, somewhat
equivalent of 25 cents per drink
to be assessed and put into all
these different important
preventive and treatment
programs.
We've also, um, found that um,
There is a paradox of um harm,
and the same amount of alcohol
causes worth worse health
outcomes among disadvantaged
population.
And this is what we are going to
be, um,
Why this is so progressive
attacks.
And we support that. Thank you.
Um
Any discussion or uh questions,
Senator Stephan.
Thank you, um, Madam Chair, I
believe in harm reduction, but I
was wondering, is this gonna
help us align
All of our different alcohol
taxes that we have.
You know, we have some per
barrel, some per beer, some per
glass, all those we have.
You know, many things across the
board.
Um
Mr. Chair and senator,
we aren't changing how the
distributor tax is assessed.
We're just going to increase it
for inflation. Um, which is
about 5 cents per drink, but it
is per gallon and per liter as.
Um
It is already set up. We won't
ask RLD to change all of that.
I'm, I'm sorry caps and rev.
Um, and then the point of sale
would have to be um
At the um
Point of sale.
Thank you. Representative Jones.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Representative Ferrari, a couple
things. Um, did you say that
this tax would be for
distributors.
I, I didn't remember. The um
excise tax is at the distributor
level.
And then the um
Added a point of sales tax will
be per, per, you know, sale.
At either the grocery store or
the bar or wherever.
And it will be a percentage, a
12% uh percentage. I'm sorry I
left that out. OK, and then the
other thing is, I know, if I
remember right, that bill passed
our committee and then did it,
did it die in tax?
It did. Is it, has it changed
since then? Did you make any
changes to it? Yes, what we've
done is made, this is more of a
hybrid from what the other um
uh.
Bill to raise taxes, which it
really didn't, it lowered the
taxes and made um the level of
consumption would go up instead
of his R's, it will go down 5 to
10% and um so we've kind of
incorporated their idea of
having another percent of tax at
the point of sale, so we're
having the distributor excise
tax.
Just raised to inflation and
then adding on this 12% point of
sale.
OK, thank you very much. Thank
you, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair, I move that we um
endorse.
Is there a second?
I'll second.
Seconded by Representative
Jones. I just pointed out that
It's pretty heavy tax. I mean,
this is not uh an increase in
tax. This is a
real kick up, uh, if I buy an $8
beer with my hamburger.
At 66 acres, the price now goes
up to $9.
You pay $8 for a beer. That's 66
acres. Most restaurants are
gonna charge you that.
The distributor part will
already be incorporated, so
it'll just be the 12%. That's
12, that's 12.5%. It's a dollar
on an $8 purchase.
Yeah, it's been 30 years since
we've raised the taxes, but also
I'd just like to add, we are
taxing cannabis at higher level
than that.
Yeah, we are cannabis is less
harmful than alcohol.
Mm.
Um,
I, I just want to point out that
this is a pretty heavy bill.
It's not, it's not a slight
increase. It's a, it's a big
kick.
chair, I have a question.
It was brought up that even
though this tax had not been
raised for a number of years,
but we already have the highest
uh rate of tax on alcohol in
Basically, the country, is that
true or not?
that, um, Mr. Chair, um,
representative, that is not
true.
So where does our text stand
with relationship or do you have
that information with respect to
other taxes.
In, in other states on alcohol
and liquor.
I'm sorry I don't have that at
my fingertips cause I wasn't
planning on presenting I thought
we were just gonna go fairly
quickly, but um other states
have other taxes that they add
on different places.
So, but you have to keep in mind
that our states um.
Has
About $3.7 billion.
Um, cost for
But for deaths for hospital, for
Care, healthcare for loss of
wages, um,
For
What we're giving almost $4 a
drink it costs us.
For all of these different
things, whereas we're, you know,
not collecting that very that
much, um.
As at the sale.
So we're asking everyone, we're
50% of our population doesn't
drink at all or very little to
take on the cost of what others
um and, and also to have it so
that we can prevent young people
from earlier age of onset and be
less likely to become
alcoholics.
OK. Any other questions or
debate. We have a motion that's
been seconded to endorse.
Is there any opposition?
Seeing none will consider that
to have been endorsed as well.
And Representative Ferrari, the
Green amendment, is that really
a health bill?
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, so
the Green amendment, uh,
essentially it gives uh all uh
New Mexicans, uh, right to a
clean and healthy environment,
and it puts the onus on keeping
the environment clean and
healthy on the state, counties
and municipalities.
And this is a constitutional
amendment.
Uh, yes, please.
Um, this is, um, to make it so
that the decision making at the
different levels of government
in uh considers the impact on
our air, water, soil and
environments and we've added
back to healthy native flora,
fauna and ecosystems and a safe
climate and to the preservation
of natural cultural, scenic and
healthful.
qualities of the environment.
And
We want these rights to be
protected equitably for all
people regardless of race,
ethnicity, tribal affiliation,
gender, socioeconomics, or
geography. We are not including
or we have carved out the
Article 20, Section 21, um,
because of the litigation that
is um already in process and we
feel that um this is self uh
self-executing.
And no monetary awards are um
encumbered in violation of this.
It's just a way to um ask for
changes or considerations by our
uh state municipalities,
counties, and um and our state.
Any questions or debate,
discussion of the issue.
Representative Jones.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm not
sure where to start with this.
It seems so.
Open, vague. I guess my first
question would be,
was required and and what's
What would be
Uh, how would it be enforced?
Um, can you
Just speak to that, please?
Sure, real quickly, um.
The um example um is
The consideration of such as uh
the water, um,
Rights or uh
The expansion of Los Luna, you
know, to giving water to a a.
Water Company, um.
And
They um were using 1961 data.
Instead of current data to make
their decisions, so the people
of that community were worried
about their wells going dry, and
if they were to allow this um
extra water to be used, so what
the um commission or uh counsel
should have considered was, is
this really a good evaluation
and how do we evaluate better
and make sure that um they
aren't going to.
Um
Uh, the, the people of their
community won't suffer by having
to drill more wells or, you
know, deeper and have that
expense, um, so the green
amendment will make it so that
whenever decisions are being
made like um.
Such as that, that they have to
really consider and keep in mind
the um
Adverse effects of their
decision.
Thank you.
I still think it's it's so vague
and open. I don't know how we
would decide if that happened or
not.
You know, asking someone, did
you consider that? And they're
answering, yes, we considered it
and then how would you, where,
where are the parameters to
implement what's actually in the
bill.
I'm not sure I could um.
If there's no way to define
that, I don't know that I could
support that. Mr. Chair, and
Representative Jones, this is a
constitutional amendment has to
be vague, um, there is no
monetary, but it would give a
recourse for the people of that
community to go back.
And um
bring, you know, information
and, and say to that uh decision
making body. This is, this is
what's going to happen. You
should overturn this or change
that or not in their first
decision making, make it a
better one.
Thank you. I appreciate the
conversation. I, and I know the
intent we're we're on target
with that cause I want to
protect the environment too. I
just still maybe I just don't
understand it well enough or I
need more information to support
it, but thank you so much. Thank
you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative.
Anybody else with questions or
discussions. A movement that we
where you do endorse it. Is
there a second?
I'll second it, Mr. Chaired by
Representative Herndon.
Any opposition.
And
So we have Representative Jones
opposing it.
And I, I'm, I'm of two minds on
whether I should be voting on
these endorsements then I could
be around. So I'm just laying
low on all of these.
When it's a tie, you're gonna
have to wait. Yeah, if it ever
gets to that point, I might have
to.
Um, and Mr. Chair, can, can I
remind people this is not a, a,
a hearing in front of a session
committee. So we're trying,
we're losing people really fast,
so if we could keep
are particularly our
presentations and explanations,
very short, cause we don't want
to sit here with just the chair
and I, um.
It doesn't, it's not a good
look, so let's try and move it
along.
So the only opposition
registered would be from uh
officially from Representative
Jones to that and then he gets
our endorsement.
is Representative Jones,
allowing certain types of detox
facilities.
To start drugs that treat
withdrawal.
Um
Mr. Chair and members of the
committee, um, this bill, um,
Addresses a problem that um was
brought to the committee's
attention by a gentleman named
uh Phil Houston when we were
down in Portalis, and I believe
he came to talk to the committee
last year, um, in rural areas,
there are uh oftentimes not
pharmacy pharmacies are not open
24 hours, they might close on
the weekends and therefore, um,
this is why it would be
necessary for these facilities
to be able to stock meds that
assist people with getting
through withdrawal.
And that is what this bill would
be asking for to allow these um
detox facilities which are uh
flavor of custodial facilities
to stock these medications in
the event that somebody's in
need when the local pharmacy is
closed.
I move that we do endorse this.
And with her permission, I want
to sign on with Reb Jones.
Yes, I give you permission. In
fact, I encourage it. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Any discussion or questions.
Thank you for bringing this
forward. That was a really, uh,
uh,
Impactful statement to to Phil
made down in Carlsbad, that was
really good.
OK, uh, seeing any opposition to
this?
Seeing none will consider that
bill to have been endorsed as
well.
And then we're gonna go to
several of the bills that I've
asked to have prepared even
though I can't carry them
because I won't be in the
session. So on some of these
I'll be looking for somebody on
the committee who might be
willing to, to carry them, if
not in the committee, I'll have
to beat the bushes for somebody
else.
Um, and so the first of these is
the, it's a repeat of a bill
we've uh we've modified it
somewhat.
I carried last year, he didn't
get a, a message, so it didn't
get.
Introduced
Uh, but it's, it's our way of
making boarding homes. Did you
want to explain it, Sandra?
Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So,
uh, yeah, it's an incentive
process for boarding homes to
get licensed uh with the
healthcare authority, um, and,
and essentially what it does is
it pays these boarding homes, a
stipend for each, um, well,
these licensed boarding homes, a
stipend for each person that
they uh take and house uh who
are leaving from the state
hospital, the behavioral Health
Institute, um, and then the New
Mexico uh or UNM adult
psychiatric ward and um
So, you know, it's an attempt to
try to incentivize more uh
boarding homes to get licenses.
Exactly. So, um,
So far I think they only have 2
licensed boarding homes in the
state.
This was an attempt at making
some
Uh, incentive for boarding homes
to get licensed. They wouldn't
be eligible for the stipend
unless they were.
So I would move the, uh, the
endorsement of this, and if
anybody wants to volunteer to
carry it, please indicate that.
I will suck it, but I, I'm gonna
get my hand slapped if I take on
any more bits. OK, I'll look for
somebody. Don't worry. I think
we can find somebody.
Um, is there any opposition to
the, to the endorsement?
Seeing none.
We'll consider that one to be
endorsed.
Uh, expanding the prescription
drug donation again was a bill
that I introduced last year. I
think we got a committee
endorsement last year, Mr.
Chair, I'll carry it for you. Oh
great. Thank you. This one, this
one, this one, yeah, the
expanded drug donation. I'll
help in the house.
Did you want to explain it,
Xander?
Uh, yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um, so uh what this bill does is
it kind of revamps the drug
donation program. Currently, um,
there's only like one type of
entity that can uh provide or uh
donate prescription drugs and
only one type of entity that can
receive uh donated prescription
drugs. So this is opening it up
to um a lot more types of
pharmacies or physicians who can
either receive or donate, um,
uh, prescription drugs, so it
just
making the program more
expansive.
Thank you. So, I would move the
adoption or the uh endorsement
of this bill.
Seconded by Representative
Herndon and Senator Stephanic
has offered to carry it.
Is there any opposition to it?
OK.
And then the next two
Representative Chavez.
Had independently begun.
Having bills on each of these
topics drafted, she said she
would be glad to have her name
associated with them now.
But the caveat is that
If her bills get drafted in
there, she hadn't read these
over yet, so if they differ
significantly, she would just
drop these and go for hers, and
I said, that's fine.
But, uh, the first of these is
the, is another one that we, we
endorsed last year. This is the
bill that would expand to the
juvenile facilities, um, the
medication assisted treatment
that we have already said, uh,
Should be happening in adult
detention facilities.
Mm
Oh, except that I think she
might be will, she's already
said she would, yeah.
Uh-huh. But thank you,
that we endorse.
And I seconded.
OK, so we have a motion in a
second. Is there any opposition
to that one?
Seeing no
Seeing none will consider that
to have been endorsed and um
we'll ask Representative Chavez
to carry it. She was, she was
drafting a similar bill. It may
be identical, so we're OK.
She didn't have it ready for
endorsement today.
Uh, then the next one is that
constitutional amendment.
Uh, on the children, Youth and
Families department.
Um
Basically just reintroduced the
same bill.
The same uh uh joint resolution
that I carried last year.
This is the one that basically
would remove the department from
the governor's purview from the
governor's cabinet, it would, it
seeks to make it essentially an
independent professionally run
organization, uh, as free of
politics as you can ever get,
uh, the commission would be 3
professionals, uh one appointed
by the governor, one by the
Senate, and one by the House.
And um
They would then hire us a an
executive director, and
theoretically the the executive
director might might stay 25
years in that position, if
they're doing a good job, and
wouldn't change with every
administration.
It would have meetings, uh, of
the commission to make policy
decisions that would be open to
the public, so you'd have
Transparency of decisions being
made by the department, they
would be done with the press
being present and the public
being able to zoom in.
And we think that it would go a
long way toward restoring the
reputation of the department.
Um, so I would move endorsement
of that constitutional
amendment, if you could see your
way to endorsing it.
So we have a 2nd.
Any discussion?
Any opposition. And again, uh
Representative Chavez, hers may
differ, and if so, she'll drop
this one and, and carry that.
Seeing none will consider the
bill to have been the constantly
joint resolution, uh, to be
endorsed.
And then the final one that I
asked to have drafted, oh no,
there's another one down below.
Um, is, is the bill from, I
think 2 years ago.
The, you, you, you, you drafted
that one, didn't you, Andy?
That's correct, Mr. Chair. It
may have even been 3 years ago,
and, and it never, it didn't
pass. That's correct. It's, it,
it simply makes it, you want to
explain what it does? Sure. What
this pill does, members of the
committee, is it um makes the uh
process, um, for declaring
oneself an organ donor easier so
that
any kind of license that um an
individual would, for which an
individual would apply
everything from, I believe, like
a fishing licenses to
professional licenses would have
a check box that would allow
that applicant to say, and by
the way, yes, I'm, I'm open to
being um an organ donor because
as it stands right now, I
believe that the only uh
opportunity for that is with our
driver's licenses.
Yeah. Nice, nicely put, and it
was brought to me originally 3
years ago by a woman who was
working with the organ donation
program, I think she's since
retired, but she's still
available as an expert witness.
If somebody wants to pick that
up and carry that Senator
Stephenix again. Great, thank
you.
Oh, great. OK.
Uh,
Martinez.
So I would move endorsement.
Seconded by Representative
Thompson, did you have a
question?
Well you want to carry, you want
to sign on to, you want to be a
sponsor too, yeah, so Stephanic
Martinez and uh Herndon would be
sponsors of that. That's great.
Thank you. Any opposition to it?
Seeing none will consider that
to be endorsed and will move to
Representative Thompson's
firefighter peer support
program.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, so
this sets up a a framework for a
uh peer support training program
that uh will be run out of the
state fire marshal's office and
essentially what it does is it
it um gives firefighters across
the state, and well, and
paramedics, um, the, uh, the
tools to be peer support
providers for each other,
basically, and um.
So it sets up the framework,
gives them uh uh a little bit of
training framework and uh and
allow it it's not mandatory and
any firefighter or a paramedic
uh department or uh individual
can go and join or they're not
required to.
Mr. Chair, we'll just add on
here. It does say limiting
liability, that may be, that may
change, um, there's uh, there's
discussion between the
firefighters and the
The attorneys, yeah.
So, that will continue, but just
in full disclosure.
I move adoption, Mr. Chair.
And I'll second that.
Um, is there any discussion or
questions?
Any opposition to it, seeing
none will consider that to have
been endorsed as well and will
move to 2 more bills from
Representative Ferrari. The
first is the
Supported decision making.
Um,
You can go ahead.
Do you want me to go ahead? I
can go. Uh, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Um, so, uh, this bill, it
sets up the framework for the
supported decision making, um,
that we heard about in Rio
Rancho last month, and, um, so
it, it, it sets up the ability
for uh people to uh create their
own supported decision making
agreements and um.
And uh as we've heard, supported
decision making is kind of like
a a a a lighter step than going
into a full-on guardianship or
or something like that, uh, it
gives somebody the ability to
still make their own decisions
while building in a framework
that gives them more support
when they're making those
decisions.
Did you want to say anything?
Um, yes, I'd just like to add
that the wings, um,
Committee that we set up with um
representation from all the, the
Supreme Court, um, district
judges, uh, people with
guardianship involved, uh,
disabilities council have all
been part of this and it is,
it's one step that will make it
so people don't have to go and
lose all of their rights, um,
like they do under a
guardianship and um this will
also help make it so people feel
more engaged.
in their life and not lose that
sense of self, um, and this also
is endorsed uh by the Supreme
Court that put it through their
um process of approval.
Thank you.
I move that we um
Endorse adopt approve, cheer
for.
I second it Mr. Any discussion
or questions?
In the opposition.
Singan will consider that one
endorsed as well. And how about
Soteria House?
Uh, yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair.
So, uh, this is a really a
simple appropriation to uh give
Soteria House funding, uh,
Soteria House, uh, I don't think
they were heard by the committee
this interim, but they've been
heard the last few and um
basically it's a uh of a system,
um, to try to treat a serious
mental illness and um uh
psychosis and this is to fund
that program. Did you want to
say anything?
Yes, it is um probably a total,
it's 859,000 a year, we're going
for, um, at least 3 years if we
could get more and it, uh, we
also have a provider Kiva um
centers who are providing
behavioral health, uh,
throughout New Mexico, um, soon.
And this will really help people
to have an alternative to um
having heavy drugs to um
Curb their uh psychosis that uh
eventually um impacts uh their
health and eventual sometimes it
leads to death even. So this is
a more natural way for peers,
uh, to
Be able to help the person
through their psychosis, um,
episode and to help realize and
then to eventually be able to
have uh a healthy life.
So do we have a motion on this?
I've moved uh endorsement, Mr.
Chair.
OK.
Um
I'll second that.
Any discussion or question.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So the
last time we heard from them, I
believe we heard that they were
not evidence-based.
And, and the evidence they gave
us was from within their own
system. So I'm wondering if
we're gonna run into an issue
trying to give state money to a
program that isn't using
evidence-based practices.
Um, Mr. Chair and
Representative, it is experience
based by all the different
programs in other states in
Vermont, um, every year gives a
million dollars to their
program, and it has been
successful in Alaska and uh San
Jose, California, um, the
problem is to uh have it, um,
you know, continue when people
who are instrumental in uh
running the programs, but.
We feel confident that um Kiva
centers will do a good job and
there's a support to expand
throughout the state, but also
there is a support from uh Sam
uh is it, I think it's Samsa.
You know.
Yes.
Um, one other comment on that
issue, you know, we do.
In the home visiting program, we
have home visiting models that
are not considered
evidence-based, so we have to
use state money.
We can't use federal money for
the but but we still fund them,
so I think, you know, there is a
precedent for funding things
that
Haven't been rigorously,
academically demonstrated
through a research project.
But it still makes good sense.
We might not be able to use
federal money, but this would be
all state money.
Did you have a comment?
Question or anything.
Any other discussion?
Any opposition?
Seeing none will consider that
one endorsed as well.
And now we enter the realm of
representative Herndon.
For the next 12345678 bills, I
guess the house has done away
with their
cap on the number of bills you
can carry, is it.
Oh, that was just COVID, OK. Oh,
OK.
All right. Representative
Vernon, shall we start with the
right, we'll just go right down
the order. The first one is
increasing Medicaid
reimbursement for the vagus
nerve stimulation. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. This is uh a
stimulation that will help
individuals who are suffering
from epilepsy. It's put into
their body and it helps to
reduce the seizures and it, they
send the nerve cells, uh, to
your brain. And it also uh helps
if there is a seizure that it
will be not as severe as it
could be.
and to help prevent death. Right
now, Medicaid covers it, but it
doesn't cover it 100%. So we
have to change the billing code,
so it is covered.
Any
Anybody want to move, you want
to move the univorse endorsement
of
this bill. Is there a second?
Seconded by Representative
Jones. She's a nurse. She knows
all about this stuff. Yes.
OK. Is there any opposition?
See none will consider it.
Endorsed you're on a, you're on
a roll representative, go ahead
with the next one. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. We recently took a
tour of a, of a birthing center
and uh they indicated that they
were not reimbursed at the same
rate as hospitals. And so this
uh legislation is asking for
that reimbursement to be uh
acknowledged at the same rate.
Representative Thompson, thank
you, Mr. Chair. Um, my only
concern is, I mean, they need to
be reimbursed more, but
I'm afraid that we may get into
some.
Difficulty getting this passed
in that hospitals have
emergency, I mean, have all
those other things and they
charge those really high
facility fees to cover all of
those other, so I'm wondering,
would this bill allow um a
birthing center to charge those
same facility fees even though
they've got.
Fewer facilities.
So what I would say to you is
that when this gets before the
committees, what will probably
happen is a
A weighing, I don't know for
sure. I think they should be
reimbursed at the same because
of the drugs that are in place
and that there is an emergency
process for if they need to
transport a patient away from
the center, but um at least I
think the reimbursement rate
needs to be improved. If you
could scan it to the last
paragraph of the bill.
And, and, and look at that, my
fear is that um if we do it for
birthing centers, then it's
gonna be, you know, ambulatory
clinics or, you know, this kind
of clinic thing, well, we, you
know, we also transport or we
have, we call 911 to have people
transport. I'm, I'm afraid that
it might open a whole can of
worms about who starts charging
those.
Really high facility fees. Well,
I mean, let's face it, hospitals
have, you know, they have
nutrition and they have all the
therapy, you know, they have all
that stuff, so I'm not opposed
to this. I'm just
Warning that um we may be
opening a box of Pandora. I, and
I think
I think there may be some
protection against that with the
way that last paragraph is
worded, it gives the secretary
an opportunity to
To fudge a little, it wouldn't
have to be $1 for dollar with
the hospital gets reimbursed,
but for the equivalent service
piece of it.
They could do it that way, that
might be the out. I, I, I'm not
a lawyer. Yeah, me neither.
But I, I once played one on
television
OK. Any, any other discussion,
Representative Martinez, I'd
like a chance to sign on that
one also. Thank you.
You were at the same tour of the
birthing center. Yeah, I think
we were all impressed. Not only
that, but they, I think maternal
deaths have reduced considerably
when a woman goes to a birthing
center.
Good.
OK, so we have a motion. Do we
have a motion? Do we not yet. I
moved adoption of the leg just
uh endorsement of the
legislation. Are you a voting
member of Representative
Martinez? No.
But your partner there is which
she and the second, seconded by
Representative Jones. I could
take Senator Hickey's proxy.
Let's call him.
So we have a motion from
Representative Hern in a second
from Representative Jones. Is
there any question or debate or
Any opposition.
Seeing none, you're 2 for 2. OK,
let's see if this house, and now
we have the foundation. Let's
build a wall.
OK. So, Mr. Chair, the next one
is the 2 in uh workers'
compensation changes.
The workers' compensation bill
uh has not been amended since
1992, and there are only 2 items
that are being amended in this
bill. One is the attorneys' fees
being raised from 22,500 to
30,000 and the discovery fees
being raised from $3000 to
$3500. And the reason for the
increase is in talking to
individuals who have who have
been going through workers'
compensation, uh, injuries and
they are severely injured.
Once the attorney reaches that
cap, they can't get any more
money. And many times they are
being left for the remainder of
their, of their injury to fend
for themselves, and that's not
right. So what we should be
doing is actually um allowing
them to have attorneys to be
there to advocate for them and
rather than coming back every
year, there's also an
incremental, um, cost of living,
consumer price index that could
be considered in this so
That, uh, every 2 years, I think
that's the way it's set up, is
that right, Sander?
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative Herndon, it's,
uh, every year, so it will be
adjusted for inflation.
Based on the consumer price
index. The same way we adjust.
Um, Social Security.
So,
Is that worded properly? Is that
the way you want it, I mean,
the, the amount of money that
can be advanced by employers for
discovery costs and, and Mr.
Chair, this, this is kind of a
technical thing, so in a
worker's compensation case, um,
the discovery costs are paid by
the employer, um, but they,
there's like only a certain
amount that they're allowed to
pay for it statutorily, and um
they, they like put that money
out up front and uh if the uh
discovery costs get past that,
uh, nobody.
paying for it. So, so.
The way I understood you
explaining it, it was the 30,000
was for the attorneys' fees,
attorneys' fees only. Does that
include the discovery card, so,
so what is the current
3000 is the current discovery
fee, so it's only been raised by
$500 in this bill, and the
attorneys' fees, which were, OK,
1992, which was 22005 are being
increased to 30,000. Mr. Chair,
I think, uh, Grace, if you go to
like page like 5, I think is
where the discovery, um,
Maybe it's page 4. It's, it's,
um, I tried 4.
And as well he's looking for
that, I should tell you that
this, these changes are the
result of a task force that was
put together in 20203, and it
was uh workers, it was
attorneys, it was insurance
companies, so they came to an
agreement, uh, sitting at a
table for a year to come up with
these amounts that are now being
I mean they certainly sound
reasonable, yeah. I have a, I
guess I'm just, I don't
understand workers' comp. I
thought everybody paid into
workers' comp.
and then that covered.
So that's still in a cost for
the employer, the $30,000 or how
does, how does all that work
with the workers' comp fund, um,
yeah, go ahead with workers'
comp, both the employer and the
employee pay a part of the
attorney's fees. So it's not
just one person that's playing,
so with your insurance fee,
you're paying for, you're paying
for insurance, but it's got a
cap on it. And so at this point
in time, if you are, if you're
severely injured and you have a
continual injury that occurred.
and you need to have uh more um
compensation and the employer
says, I'm through paying for
you. Well, you might not have an
attorney anymore because they
will have breached the cap for
purposes of this statute and
this, and the attorneys who are
representing the employees have
to go before the court and ask
for their reimbursement, but the
workers, I mean the employer,
their attorneys can get paid
right away without even asking
for anything. So I mean we have
some discrepancy there, but most
Importantly, I'm concerned about
the people who go beyond and who
are severely hurt and they need
to be um they need that
compensation and the employer
can say at any point in time,
I'm through paying for you, and
if they don't have an attorney,
what do they do?
Have to get more clarification.
So this isn't the compensation.
This is just how do you get to
how much they will get, right?
This doesn't have anything to do
with the compensation that they
will actually receive. This only
gives the entitles them to an
attorney up to a cap of this
amount of money.
OK.
Did we ever get emotion?
I moved the uh endorsement of
this much-needed long overdue
legislation. I was 2.
Is there any discussion?
Is there any opposition?
me.
Regional behavioral health
treatment centers.
So Mr.
Mr. uh er in our, in the
financial in the legislative
finance Committee.
We had a big discussion about
the lack of coordination and how
we're making sure that people
are getting um behavioral health
services that they need. One of
the ways to coordinate care is
to create regions and to have uh
looking at transitional living,
uh, it's looking at making sure
that there is uh medical
assistance and as we pass the
compact, we're gonna have that.
Of course, all that's not in
here. All I've done is ask for
the regional center.
to be set up and for them to
have a basis of operation. Oh,
it.
I think that uh one of the
things with the behavioral
healthcare collaborative no no
um offense to anybody who sits
on that committee, but one of
the things that we need to do is
we need to do a better job of
what we're doing for behavioral
healthcare. You heard part of
that today with the presentation
by the Department of Health and
uh none of this is coordinated.
So with these regional uh
behavioral health centers, one
of the things that I, that is
the goal of these sinners is to
coordinate this.
Around the, around the state. So
are these inpatient or
outpatient, what are they? It
could be either one, inpatient,
outpatient, but one of the
things that happens right now, I
don't know if you know this, Mr.
Chair, but right now the state
has set up a platform and I
think I don't even know the name
of it. And, and they, they are 5
major counties within this state
that have a different platform
for reporting behavioral
healthcare, and they're not
talking to each other. One of
the things that we need to do is
to make sure that these systems
are talking to
each other and then no matter
where I live, if I live down in
Hobbs, New Mexico or Gallup, New
Mexico. If I move from one place
to another, they should be a
system of obtaining my records
and then also coordinating my
care and never losing me on the
system all the time making sure
that I'm getting the care that I
need.
Representative
So, are you saying um get rid of
the behavioral health
collaborative, I mean, I think
it needs to be reformed. That is
absolutely correct. And then in
terms of, I mean, that's what
synchronous is.
striving to be so to set up
another different system for
behavioral health. I'm not, I
mean, it's really expensive. I
mean, it's really, really
expensive, so I don't know if it
might be more advantageous to
look at what synchronous is
doing and what what they can do
rather than reinventing the
wheel and getting another data
platform. We, we've paid for
this one, and, and as I said
yesterday, the, the, uh
The amount that that Southwest
gastroenterology was paying for
that was $2500 so a smaller
business would be obviously
less, so I, I just, I don't want
to reinvent the wheel and I
should just tell you that
there's already 3 systems,
synchronous is not the only
system, and that's the problem.
So we, and it, uh, the, uh,
department, I'm sorry,
healthcare authority just
put out an RFP that was awarded
to somebody different than
synchronous, and then there were
the 5 major counties that I
talked about, but that doesn't
have anything to do with
creating these behavioral health
centers. Uh, they have, they,
what they will be doing is
looking and putting together um
Putting together a transitional
living, any other type of, of
care that needs to be focused in
one area so that they are, they
are equal no matter where you
are within the state in 5
different regions, we're gonna
have to come to grips with that
platform, whether we have this
system or not, but right now we
have 3 systems, but but my, my
point is, Mr. Chair, is that
Synchronous is the state
approved electronic medical
records, but they have a new
one.
So that's what I'm telling you
there's one. There may be
different places maybe using
different platforms, the state
approved health information
exchange is synchronous. So to
try and steer things off, it's
just gonna be even, you know,
oh, I, I looked at synchronous.
I didn't look at this, this one
or this one or this one, and
it's it.
It's good, I mean, because then
if we put it in synchronous,
that your primary care physician
or the physician who might be
treating you at an ER um
somewhere away from your, your
regular doctor. They can look
and they can see your behavioral
health as well as your physical
health and vice versa. Well, I
will tell you that the
healthcare authority is not
using synchronous. So they
issued an RFP for a different
platform.
But yeah, I don't know, but
synchronous is the one approved
not being used, but that's OK
um, the reason I asked about
inpatient or outpatient is cause
we, we heard this summer interim
committee.
That the department has funded.
7
Um
What do they call them?
Comprehensive community mental
health centers.
How would that the Department of
Health?
No, the uh the behavioral health
authority, the state health
Healthcare Authority, the
Behavior Health Services
Division.
So they have 7.
in Albuquerque, we heard from
the one in Carl's bed. There's
one in Las Cruces, Las Vegas, I
forget, but they've got 7 around
the state now. Wouldn't that be
the same thing as what you're
talking about?
I don't know that, Mr. Chair. I
just know that our conversation
was around uh
And I didn't even bring it up to
them. So this was a conversation
that we had in legislative
Finance Committee about the need
for looking specifically uh how
we are going to be using uh
opioid settlement funds and, and
coordinating uh behavioral
healthcare and the one of the
Big concerns was looking at the
uh
Behavioral healthcare
collaborative. I'm sorry, what's
the same thing?
The the
What is it called?
Comprehensive.
Community mental health service
centers, CMHC.
One is at UNM, one is at in
Albuquerque, is that um
Um, I face.
Those are the two in
Albuquerque, and then there's
one in, so I, I don't want to
create any conflict, but it
sounds like we have it anyway,
whether this is adopted or not.
This looks like there are a lot
of things that are not
coordinated and we're gonna have
to sit down and figure it out.
And it would be a good idea, and
I hope we get it done in the
60-day session.
So we, so did you make a motion
on this one? I did not, so I'll
just withdraw it since there
seems to be so much opposition
about coordinating behavioral
health care. OK. How about
requiring AEDs in every high
school. I'm requesting that
those be placed in every high
school, working with some high
school students on this.
Sometimes students have, they
collapse, they need assistance
in AED would be helping to bring
them forth and I'll ask the
nurse over there, uh, whether or
not that would be a good idea.
These are those defibrilization
defibrillators.
Yes, Mr. Chair, even if it's for
the teachers, there, there are
people there who are, you know,
it's always a possibility that
that would be needed.
I think they should be in every
every public building should
have that available.
Thank you.
And they have training for them.
In uh airports where you can go
and practice and learn how to do
it.
Mr. Chair, what's the um the
Request from LFC.
to pay for these in every school
I think it was 1.7. I put it in
there? Did we put an amount in
there?
I was just curious.
So I want to get the bill passed
and then I'll worry about the
appropriate is that the end of
it there 4 pages.
We don't
OK, so you want to make the
motion representative? I do. I
want to motion for endorsement,
seconded by Representative
Thompson. Any discussion,
debate,
Uh, I just want clarification to
make sure I hadn't made a
mistake anyway. So this, this uh
piece of legislation is
requiring that it be put in. I
will be asking for a separate
piece of legislation for an
appropriation that I'm not
bringing or just.
a line item in House Bill 2 is
what you really to the cover the
cost.
OK. Any opposition?
Seeing
Seeing none, you have another uh
endorsement. And then how about
attorney appointment?
Her indigent victims of domestic
violence, so Mister Chair, I in
my, when I wear my other hat as
an attorney for a uh but not for
a nonprofit law center helping
survivors of domestic violence.
One of the things that happens
too often is that I'm gonna use
women. I know that they can also
apply to men who uh end up going
to court too many times and they
don't have a council, and if,
when it comes to um
custody of the children. Uh,
she's not able to fight for
herself. I have someone to help
her because she doesn't have any
money. Most of the time she
stayed home to take care of the
family, and she's been abused.
So this legislation tracks
legislation that actually occurs
in New York that requires that
there be an appointed attorney,
but there is a survivor of
domestic violence and what we've
been trying to use the 50 hours
of pro bono service that every
single attorney is required to
have, but these attorneys are
very
very busy and sometimes they're
conflicted out and they can't do
it. So no woman should ever have
to go to court without an
attorney.
So is that the end of it, uh,
page 4? Is there an
appropriation?
There's no appropriation with
this.
So, but it is gonna be something
for the courts to determine.
There are court appointed
attorneys and they, the courts
can decide whether or not, what
the amount is gonna be, it would
be on a low bono rate. It's not
gonna be at a full.
Amount that an attorney would
normally get if they are
representing someone who had
money.
So basically you're just adding
this as an option for the court
to
appoint an attorney and then
there would be a basis for them
to be paid to the uh
Administrative office of the
courts. Do you want to make a
motion? I, I move that we
endorse this very needed much.
legislation.
Seconded by Representative
Jones.
Um, any questions or debate?
Mm
Seeing any opposition.
Seeing none will consider it to
have been endorsed.
And we'll go to your increase
the reimbursement for personal
care services.
So, um,
Mr. Chair right now.
What can happen if rather than
putting a, a person into a
A facility, they could stay home
and they can be cared for at
home and so when there's
personal care at home, we need
to find a way to increase the
amount of money that
Uh, Mr. Chair, uh, uh, this
spill is, is uh for personal
care service agencies like Megan
Legino Correct. And, and, um,
and, and Mr. Chair and
Representative Herndon, yeah,
it, um, it, it, it sets a new
fee schedule for them, it
increases, um, the minimum fee
schedule for reimbursement for
personal care services would be
$23.50 an hour under this, um,
and then it also um sets up a
requirement.
In statute that um.
70% of the Medicaid funding that
a personal care services agency
receives has to go to um the
direct care workers.
Uh
So, and it appropriates 20
almost 21 million for this.
Which would be matched with
federal.
Yeah, that's right, Mr. Chair.
Yes, I move endorsement of this.
So we have a motion for an
endorsement, seconded by
Representative Thompson. Any
questions or discussion? We
heard testimony about this in
Silver City, I think it was in
Silver City, Adrian Smith.
Mm
Uh, well, yeah, but, but, but
also Megan didn't Megan, yeah,
Megan spoke to.
OK.
So, is there any opposition to
this?
Seeing none will consider it to
have been endorsed.
And
And then, uh, oh, this is the
graduate behavior. As you know,
we've been trying to get HED to
give us
Um, the best way of going about
making graduate education and
behavioral health fields.
and they have not given us that.
Best approach to use.
As recently as last week, I was
supposed to meet with them, get
their uh recommendation and have
that converted into a bill they
didn't have one. Yeah, they keep
promising they'll have one. In
the meantime, we've created our
own, and I'll let you talk about
how it would work.
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair. So
this, uh, bill is kind of
modeled after the opportunity
scholarship, but it's
specifically for um 4 types of
graduate level education for
behavioral health providers, so
yeah, thank you, Grace. So uh
it's for uh graduate level
counseling, psychiatric nursing,
psychology and social work
degrees and um this is open to
anybody, um, not just New
Mexicans, anybody who comes into
the state, uh, can take
advantage of the scholarship,
um, but they have to
commit to practice once they
graduate for as many years as
they've received the
scholarship, which can vary
depending on the field.
And we appropriate, we didn't
know how much. That's why, but
in the, in the vacuum that
they're um lack of information
created, we decided to
appropriate, try to appropriate
$3 million for the first year,
that would, if the tuition, and
it varies from institution to
institution, I think UNM is more
expensive than Highlands and
eastern and western or less
expensive than New Mexico State,
but whatever, whatever the
tuition is, this would cover the
tuition and fees for that field
for that year.
And so,
3 million, oh, and we, we said
the department can use about
1005%, I think we said 175,000
is what I calculated it would
be, uh, that they could use that
to administer the program.
So they could hire somebody to
keep track of all these things.
And then that leaves enough to
cover uh 570 by my calculation,
575 $5000 scholarships. Now,
Scholarships actually cost 10.
Obviously, we just have half
that many, but I think 5000 is
probably just for tuition and
fees.
Approximation.
And, and we'll get the actual
figures from HED when they have
to do an FIR in this
legislation.
So, I'm looking for a code for
somebody to sponsor this cause I
can't.
I want to, um, I'd prefer a
Democrat
I have a question.
No, that's all right, all the
years that I've worked with him
the first time he ever did that.
No, I'm, my question is, this
is, this is for state funded
schools
for, for, for the, I think the
only graduate programs in, in,
uh, behavioral fields, graduate
programs or state ones in the
state.
And it's not limited to New
Mexico residents, by the way,
somebody comes in from Texas to
go to New Mexico State and get a
degree in psychiatric nursing,
des fine, they just have to work
here for as many years as they,
as they got helped.
I, I always thought the senator
was very bipartisan until today.
So did you volunteer to be the
sponsor?
Oh God. Anybody else wanna be
this, you look great. Thank you,
representative.
So, first of all, let's see if
we get an endorsement. This, uh,
I move we endorse this.
Seconded by Representative
Herndon, any opposition.
Hey, thank you. So you have
another pill one of several that
you.
And you'll do the morning too?
Where is that? That's up here.
Yeah. Uh
Yeah, great, good, Ferrari.
Thank you. OK. Last bill.
Representative Hernon, back to
you for mental health rooms and
suicide prevention. Thank you,
Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair,
2 years ago, we, uh,
This, uh, legislature in a bill
signed also approved by the
governor. We created 14 um
mental health rooms around the
state with some support from
federal funding. Uh, the purpose
of the, these, these mental
health rooms came about
initially because in El Dorado
High School was one of the first
high schools that had the
highest rate of, of suicide in
the entire state. And so they
have the first mental health
room. It has been successful.
That rate.
uh dropped or disappeared
altogether and uh so other
schools I went around to visit
them, Alabaordo, uh, Albuquerque
High, others, uh, to talk about
this concept and each one of
those schools uh that I spoke
with was interested in having a
mental health room that would be
funded or with uh
Uh, resources that would include
having someone who is studying
behavioral health, mental
health, sociology as an intern
in those rooms, of course, they
would be over, they would be
oversight through telehealth
that to make sure that they
could be there and that someone
would always have the
opportunity to talk to them. We
were only, we only had enough
money to do 14, and so now we're
asking for 14 more, and they're
all around the state. In
addition, the yellow ribbon of
suicide prevention program,
which is
program primarily in the rural
areas. We're asking for the
$300,000 that they that they're
seeking to make sure that that
program remains viable. That is
the one that uh we talked about
today, uh, during the
presentation, they said they
were familiar with it and that
uh Michelle Katz is here with
that program. She's sitting in
the audience. Wave your hand,
they can see you and um you
should wear a yellow ribbons so
we could spot you.
Hm.
And I moved up, um, I moved the
endorsement of this piece of
legislation.
Are these, uh,
Um, mental health room staffed,
is there somebody there or yeah,
that, that is a concept and I
can, I can speak specifically to
the one in El Dorado High
School, and what I've asked for,
Mr. uh, Chair, is a, is a report
on the success of these other
rooms that, that were in
existence as a result of the
2022 funding that was made
available for them. So, so the,
the money in here, right, is for
the staff. No, it's not just for
the
staff is to, to put uh the rooms
have to be um equipped with
things when people are going
into a mental health room. Maybe
it's gonna be music, maybe it
might be a chair, maybe it'd be
a, a gate, maybe it's something,
but in addition, that would be
at least one staff person in
every single room. And, and
where are you going to get that
money? That's coming from this
money. So there was 75 $125,000
that was allocated to each of
the other 14 rooms. So this
should
cover that. 14 on, that's all
I'm asking for is 14 more. And
then plus the, there's an
additional 300,000 that's being
asked for for the yellow ribbon
program. OK, yeah, 14 you can
do.
Yeah, that's all I'm asking for
is 14 around the state.
We'll get these 28 before uh I
asked Representative Thompson
for more money, and it goes to
PED anybody from PED here.
They're OK with this, you
already checked with them? Well,
they were the ones who were
helping to support a great
Frosted was here before. Leslie,
whose name I can't remember, was
over the behavioral health, and
she was the one who was, well,
totally supportive of it.
You want to move the
endorsement. I've moved for the
endorsement.
You have a 2nd from
Representative Jones. Any other
discussion on this matter?
Any opposition to 750,000.
For 14 mental health rooms and
300,000 for the Yellow Ribbon
campaign.
Seeing none, we'll consider that
one endorsed as well.
And that concludes the work of
the committee for the today, for
this year.
been an incredible interim.
Thank you all. You've done a lot
of work.
Been a, uh, a tour of the state.
And um
I look forward to following how
you all do uh during the session
with these bills. Did you get
the people that are gonna pick
up mine. I've got him here. I'll
go over it with you.
And with that, unless there's
any other burning issues that
would hold you here and prevent
you from getting home.
We will call the meeting
adjourned.
