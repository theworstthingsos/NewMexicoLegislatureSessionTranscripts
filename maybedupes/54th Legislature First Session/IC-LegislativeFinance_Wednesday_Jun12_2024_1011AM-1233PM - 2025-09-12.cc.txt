We're gonna get started this
morning,
Joey, you're gonna start us
off.
We only hit 47 potholes
going one mile down the
road.
I thought it was
43.
I was on the left
side.
>> So uh good morning,
Mr, chair members of the committee.
My name is Joseph Simon. I am
the LFC analyst for the Department
of Transportation
and we are here today
to uh conduct a
legis that hearing for the Department
of Transportation. This is
dot S first
time before the committee and in a
legis.
Um So I will
just uh very
briefly go over
your staff brief which is behind
Tab G. It looks like
this
and uh cover a couple
of key points
and then hand it over to the department
for their presentation.
So, uh to start
off with, uh
we had identified uh
for the department and,
and in conversations,
three key performance
challenges for the department.
Those performance challenges
are the uh pro
the project management
capacity of the
um of the department,
uh the uh workforce
development program that the department
is currently undergoing
and also traffic safety
in particular relation
to fatalities on
our roadways.
So, um just to give you an
idea of the Department of
Transportation on page one of the
staff brief, you can
see appropriations
to the department from
you all between
2017 and
2024. So this is
by legislative session,
including any special
session that happened in that
particular year. And so
as you can see, uh, in
2017,
uh, the department
had a little less than
$900 million
as of last year because of
some large special appropriations
that you all approved. That number
has gone to over $2 billion
in in last
year. Another
thing for you to keep in mind is directly
below that if you look.
So we've got a 10 year history
of road conditions that are
reported by dot
So you can see more
recently a little bit of
uh of seesawing in the
road conditions. But overall,
uh the road conditions in New
Mexico are have been relatively
flat for the past
uh for the past
decade.
So turning to our
first performance challenge and that's
managing the uh the
significant investments that you all
have put forward. So there's a
couple of ways that we're going
to to look at that through the, through
the legis that process. So
the first would be looking at
the active projects
that NM dot has out on
the roadways. And actually for
this, I'll have you turn towards
to the back of your staff brief where
we have some attachments
and you can see on attachment
one
dot Reports, there are currently
67 active
projects out on
New Mexico's roadways
with a total uh
initial bid cost
of over a billion dollars.
So that is just the
projects that dot is
currently managing
uh in the construction phase.
And on this table here in
attachment one, you can see
sort of when dot
is projecting
that uh those projects,
uh those current projects will
end. You can see the
bulk of them are supposed
to uh complete
within the current calendar
year with a huge chunk
of them uh being completed
in the last half of
2024. So
uh a little more than half a
billion dollars of that billion dollars
that's currently out on the roadway,
roadways um is
expected to be completed in the last half
of the current calendar year. Now,
of course, additional projects
will have started by then we'll
get to that in just a moment, but just to give
you an idea of some of
those large
projects that uh
dot Is planning
on finishing later this
year. We've got us
285 in Eddie County. That's
a $53 million project
that's supposed to close in the
last half of the current year.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with
the, the work that's been done on La
Bajada that uh so
it's listed here as closing in the
last half. But uh the
department has been ahead of schedule
actually on that particular project.
And then as well a a big
uh project, uh well widening
project down in Doanna County
on New Mexico
404.
So those are, those are the
active projects and keeping an eye on
those to see if dot
is bringing those in on time
and on budget um
is one of the, the goals of
the legis that process.
Secondly, we'll move
on to the sort
of short term next
year uh project
schedule. So that's um d
what dot Maintains
on their letting schedule
and the purpose of that letting schedule
is to sort of give the
contracting community
an idea of what's coming down the
pipeline. So that's
been a key performance measure
for the department is ability to
deliver on getting those projects
out to bid on
time. And you can see
um this uh the,
the table on or
the chart on page two
breaks down the that
letting schedule by quarter
with an estimate of the
project cost that's based
on the amounts that
are included in the um
state Transportation Improvement
program. Obviously, the
contractors are gonna to bid on that.
So those costs might, might
vary a little bit from that
estimate.
Uh But so
that's uh the sort
of year
schedule that
dot has in front of it uh
for the next year.
Finally, uh
looking at
some of the major investments that
you all have made in the in
new Mexico's roadways.
We identified 15
very large
projects. And again, turning
you back to that attachment
that's in attachment
three.
And you can see a
number of these are very large
projects. Some of them are
projects that you all
authorized severance
tax bonds for during the
last
last
session.
I apologize. I it attachment
two, I misspoke, I
apologize.
Attachment two. Yes. So this,
it's titled project schedules
for select major infrastructure
projects.
Um I'll just uh very
quick, quickly highlight a couple
of those uh for
you. Um A big
notable one is
uh in Benli County. Um
uh improvements to I
25 from
Comanche to Montgomery.
Uh That's a
$278
million project. So over a quarter
of a billion dollars on
that project and that is actually
scheduled to begin
construction
uh in August. So, you know,
we're gonna start seeing
according to the department, we're gonna start
seeing road barrels go
out maybe in July,
followed by uh groundbreaking
in August. You'll also
see from this, this project
schedule. That's a pretty long
term project. It's not
gonna close until the spring of
2027.
Uh You know, other large
projects there, you can see we've
got a number of large projects
in Bernalillo County.
Um We did select
projects around the
state in all of the
different transportation districts
to monitor through this
process.
So moving on from
the project schedule,
the second item
was actually
identified a little
bit for us. Last,
last meeting when we were
meeting Gallup at the Department of Transportation,
there were a lot of questions about
the department's workforce development
and, and staffing
dot has
has really focused
on maintaining
a qualified and skilled
staff and filling some
of those vacancies as key
to improving
infrastructure in New Mexico.
So, currently based
on the
um the authorized
FTE in the
department's fy 24 budget,
we have about a 14%
vacancy rate in the department.
And as you can see over
time, over the last couple of
years, that's, that went up,
but it started to come down
significantly. One of the
reasons for that is on page five
of your staff brief. You
can see um the
departments made uh some,
some pretty significant
improvements in
um closing
vacancies for highway maintenance
workers in particular.
So that number of
vacancies in that area fell from 100
and 75 to
94 mostly due
through filling
um through filling in
new positions rather than just
eliminating vacant ones. Although there was
a couple of those uh one
area that I know the department is
focusing on is uh
in professional engineers and that's
actually an area where over time
we've seen those vacancies gone
go up slightly.
Finally, our last performance
challenge for the department is
uh in the area of traffic
safety.
So according
to the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, New Mexico
ranks among the highest
for vehicle fatalities in the
country, uh, only
fourth behind, uh,
states like South Carolina
and, uh, Arkansas.
Um, that's particularly,
uh, that's a particularly important
issue in the area
of pedestrian fatalities.
And so, as you can see from the second
map on that, on that
chart, New Mexico is actually
ranked highest in pedestrian
fatalities with uh
4.8
fatalities per 100,000
in population.
Um You know,
so just to give you an idea
of the impact
that has on New Mexicans.
So for overall
deaths, if, if we were
to mirror the national
average of 1.37
deaths per
100 million vehicle miles
traveled, that would be 100 and 14
fewer fatalities on
New Mexico's road if we were just
to get to the national average.
So I know this has been a major
focus area for the department and we're
going to hear from them on this
issue. And,
um, and that
I will, will also just point out
one of the things we've, we
asked the department for is
if they can identify
uh some, some major
areas where we're seeing a
lot of fatal vehicle
crashes.
So on page seven of your staff
brief, you can see sort
of a, a handful of,
of fatal
hotspots for,
um, for New
Mexico's roads. So the
top table shows you
just intersections
with the most fatal vehicle
crashes and this is just
by sheer number. So obviously,
when uh when
looking at this, this
data, the a
more heavily trafficked
area is going to have more
fatalities. You would, you would
expect that, but that's why. So
all of these examples are in
Albuquerque because that's where the heaviest
traffic numbers are. So it's
important to have this information. But
one thing we might look at in the future
is if we can get uh
traffic counts as
well into this data, so we
can maybe identify areas
where for the amount of traffic
that they have, we're seeing
more fatalities
uh in the second a area,
you can see uh areas
where we, we're seeing a high number of
pedestrian fatalities.
Again, those are
either in Albuquerque or Santa
Fe and the characteristics are
a little bit different uh
for, for these
areas. Um
notably that
these areas tend to have larger
homeless populations and that
leads to more
fatalities.
And uh so with that, just
brief overview of the data, I
think we'll hand it over to
dot To do a quick overview
of their data before we get into your
questions.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Good
morning. Good. Uh
Good to be here.
Um It's good to be
back in Carlsbad.
We're gonna go
through this presentation very briefly.
I'm only gonna present one slide and then I'm gonna
hand it over here to Amy
and Denise and they can introduce
themselves um
uh along the lines of
monitoring these uh special
one time appropriations that the
legislature has provided to
NMOT. Um
on this very first slide of the
presentation slide number two,
rather, you see a snippet
from a dashboard that we've
developed and
this dashboard essentially is
tracking the legislative
appropriations from the 2024
legislative session.
And that is um
the, these three buckets that
you see on this slide, about 320
million for severance tax bond
projects, 70
million for special
projects um identified
on the Senate side and 100 and $20
million for maintenance projects across
the state. And so what
we'll do, um we
understood that we weren't gonna be able
to demonstrate this here for you today is
we'll send this link,
it's public facing. Um
But essentially what you'll be able to
do is identify
where all of this
money is being
allocated by project by
district and by location,
the process that we'll be using
for uh maintenance
and essentially the letting
dates for the S TB
projects that um
essentially are attached to bond
sales with the Department of Finance
and Administration.
And the other thing that
you'll be able to identify, especially
for those seven's tax bond
projects is the funding gaps.
And so the
appropriations for the,
the S TB projects
is 320 million. But the
cost and the sum of the cost of all
those projects is greater
than half a billion dollars.
And so you'll see on this
snippet that purple graph
there is showing what the funding gap
is for projects
in district one. And
so we'll identify for you
all from where, you know, we'll
be making up the difference to get these
projects going and underway.
So, uh we look forward
to discussions
around your
ability to kind of
digest that data and
information
um beginning on
slide three and I'm gonna hand this off.
Um As Joey said,
um, um,
very eloquently,
this is a longstanding issue,
pedestrian fatalities for the state of
New Mexico. And you all may recall
those of you
who, who sit on the
um House
Transportation Committee. There was
discussion and debate about this a couple
of years ago related
to a zero
bill that was being introduced
at the time. And
uh what, what we
discussed at the time was essentially
the various programs that the Department of
Transportation has
the plans that it has to develop and the
funding that it receives specifically
for road user safety, all road
user, pedestrians, cyclists,
construction workers,
etcetera. And
so, um on the heels
of a memorial, um
that uh Representative De La
Cruz, uh chair Hochman be
Hill have, have gotten through
is we're gonna discuss a little
bit about how we're gonna
bring all of those resources
together to really focus in
on addressing these metrics
nationally and how we're gonna put a
dent in, in roadway
safety. And I think
it's important that we have the conversation,
we're focusing on this because
even if you take an issue
like um
um wildlife corridors,
right? The idea
that we as a group
have had more discussions about
heating animals than we have about
hitting people
is perplexing.
Right? And so it's not
that, that first issue
isn't important as
much as it is. We have
to have conversations about all of these
things where we, especially where
New Mexico is
ranking in a negative way
uh amongst other states.
So what we've done
as part of this measure is some
organizational restructuring at
the Department of Transportation.
Um And now
overseeing much of this
work are, are these two
colleagues to my right?
Um And I'll let them introduce themselves
and go through the presentation.
>> I just want everybody to note that the
worst drivers on this page
are in
Albuquerque
>> or the
worst
with all the honking senator.
We couldn't hear what happened to their
hands. >> Good
morning, chairman, committees,
committee members, I'm Denise
Peralto at dot uh
like Secretary Cerna
mentioned, I am now the new
director and I have asset management,
traffic safety and planning
and research.
So we'll go through the slides.
Uh You can see on slide three,
this is the top high incident
intersections and it's a little
different than what Joey
explained this one.
What Joey has is all
fatal. The ones that you see
on your slides page three and
four are for city roads and state
roads which
include
other items as
number of crashes, injury,
fatal pedestrian
crashes, pedic cycle, and
percentage of injuries.
So on slide three is
the city roads for fatal
crashes, pedestrian crashes
and cycle and then you go to Slide
four and it's the
state intersections
and again for fatal cycle
and pedestrian.
So those are the numbers for
you. Um Going on
to the next slide is the
data driven decisions
and how we make them for safety and
the data we collect
if you go to slide
six, we talk
about the crash data that we
receive. So we use a
five year period
and we collect the data
and then we process it and
we integrate into reporting and
collaboration and from their
specialized reports
and you go on to slide
seven
and it explains the
steps for each
step from the
sources to the accuracy,
the reporting and the
improvements for the
reports. And we describe
them all there.
The next thing that helps with this
information is slide
eight and it's the collection of the
road conditions data.
This is uh we use a company
called Frow right now and
they collect 20 data elements
throughout the
state. Um
And with that information we use
on the roadway inventory
system and it's
um we from that
data, we we use the
performance monitoring system for all
of our reporting. Then
you go to Slade nine
and this shows a
beautiful picture and
you can see that safety is
28%.
But when we evaluate
for a new project, these are the
items we look at and you can see
9% is multimodal,
11% is econo
economic development.
11% is freight.
13% is general
mobility which includes the number of
cars, 27%
is conditions um that
goes into the pavement and bridge
conditions and
28% you can see a
safety which includes the crash
data.
If you go on to slide
10, these are
two graphs. The
left one is about
bridges. And so this is
what we do to determine
um new construction
projects. And you can
read through these images. The
left side is bridges and how we
select them and how we move forward.
The right side is for pavements.
And you can read if it's a small
scale pavement project, a large
scale or on the shelf.
And again, anything for
maintenance that has to do with
safety like guardrail signal
lighting, we definitely
um have maintenance crews out there to
repair immediately,
moving on to the slides.
Um We're going to talk about the programs
that the dot has
if you go on to slide 12.
Uh the campaigns that the
dot promotes,
we have the buckle up, uh
just drive
for destructive
driving and DW
I and pedestrian safety
campaign. It's look for me,
there's images there for you
guys on
slide 13. It's
the collaboration that we do with law
enforcement. So funding
for overtime, checkpoints,
speed enforcement, officer
training and other
allocations of our
resources.
You move on to slide
14. And
in planning, these are the programs
we have with engagement, engagement
with community and we have the
safe routes to school program,
uh the pedestrian safety
initiatives and bicycle
safety programs. And
on the slide, I describe
each program that the planning
division has
and the last one for
me um that the planning program
has is slide 15. It's
our safety improvement program.
This is a plan that we
have every five years. Uh
We use safety money,
HS IP. And
again, our vision is Target
Zero and
we're using the National
Roadway Safety Strategy. And
that's the picture to the
right.
>> Good morning, Mr chairman, members
of the committee. I see many of you
looking at me quite confused
because you're wondering who is that
person? We know, we see her
face. Um, the last
time that I presented in front of you,
I was presenting for Housing and
homelessness for the Governor.
And so I've recently had
the opportunity to move over
to the Department of Transportation
to take over the coordination
of Target Zero. New
Mexico Target
Zero. New Mexico is
our approach to
driving down tar uh
crash related fatalities
here in New Mexico, as
you heard from Joey and
um secretary
that we are number one
in the nation for pedestrian
fatalities. And so we really
want to make sure that we're
coordinating across
the New Mexico Department of
Transportation with the
many different things that we
have already going
and making sure that we can
sharpen our focus on
safety and all of our
work. All of this
was really um instigated
did by House Memorial
85. And it
really gives New Mexico an
opportunity to align
with the national approaches.
Looking at how do we
build a New Mexico
specific strategy
that really looks at our local
governments, our hospitals
and all of the different things that
are happening around transportation
and different modalities to
make sure that we are driving
down a new Mexico
specific strategy.
We are utilizing our
existing eight programs
for safety looking at a
target zero that builds a
coordinated effort.
And so you'll see on slide
17, all of the
different programs that we
have that are really going to be
focused on this
effort.
The new Mexico Department of Transportation
is making sure that we are
looking at key principles of
target zero to drive this
New Mexico specific
strategy. We know
that every fatality that happens
in New Mexico, it's a person
that's impacting a family
that's impacting our community.
And so we must make sure
that safety and human life are
put first, we're
gonna make sure that we are using
data to drive our
decisions and making
sure that that data shows us how
we can do increased efficiency
and effect EEC
effect efficiency
and effectiveness.
We're gonna make sure that we're building
equity across all communities
and across New Mexico.
And we're gonna hold ourselves
accountable by really
giving partners the
way to build
robust and um
active
strategies.
There are lots of activities
that we can do to make sure
that we are driving towards zero
fatalities. I just want
to highlight a few of those that we're
very excited about getting
started on making sure
that we're looking at immediate
successes, midterm,
successes and a long term
goal of zero fatalities
that are crash related here in New
Mexico. And so you'll
see the whole list of activities
that we're going to embark
on. But the ones that I really
want to focus on for you
are that we're coordinating efforts
across the Department of
Transportation to connect our
safety planning into
our maintenance and also into our
projects and
that we're going to increase our, the
conducting of road safety
audits so that we can make sure that
we're identifying root
issues, not just building
safety for the road, but how do we
also engage in
behavior um change
that happens for pedestrians and
bikers. And then
also we want to talk about how do
we identify and implement
education and campaigns
that really give New Mexico
a traffic safety
culture. And
so, um from there, we'll
stand for
questions.
>> Thank you. We'll start off with uh
Representative
Armstrong.
OK.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chairman and thank you for the
presentation. I
um I'm
curious in
the report for
pedestrians
uh noting
where all of the
majority of the
pedestrian
uh incidents
are, is there,
is it homeless?
And are, is there a way
to account for
where those
pedestrians
um are coming
from
>> anybody?
Um Mr Chair
Representative,
um we can,
we can. So going back
right to Amy's previous role with the
governor's office and coming here,
we believe that there's gonna be
a need to really tap into local
resources around homelessness,
transient community, substance
abuse resources
that play into this, going back to the
two points, right about bad
drivers and bad pedestrians.
It, it's speaks
to this shared, you
know, um responsibility.
And so we have
anecdotally if you take,
for example, an
area that we're all familiar with in Santa
Fe, New Mexico, and you look at clusters
of high incident rates in Santa
Fe and a portion of
Cyris Road right from
Saint Michael's to
say, um even before
Richards Avenue, um
you know, Silo Road
and you look at at, at
the homelessness community
that exists there and the high incident
rates of pedestrian fatalities
crossing four lanes of Cyris
road, we can anecdotally
start to make some
um assumptions
that it does relate in
some way to the need to change
the behavior of the pedestrians,
right? And so going back
to the date debate we've had about
this in in committee
is um you know, it
isn't always gonna be an engineered
solution for road
infrastructure. It's gonna need to
be a collaborative with communities
to say here's the
area, here's based
on the road safety audit, what
we believe needs to change.
What are the social services that are
going to help make that change?
And, and therefore,
you know, we can go on to,
you know, other communities
and, and dut in particular
can say here's where we need to invest
infrastructure dollars. So,
um the, so
the challenge for us in front of
us is when we come to you
all with a number to say
we've done some audits and here are
going to be the resources that we
would like to secure, to
address some of these things. Some of
them are going to be infrastructure related.
They may be socially
social program development.
>> Ok. Thank you for that. Thank you Mr
Chairman and I'm really
disappointed you didn't mention
Zippy.
Come on
does not everyone
know who Zippy is. It's a huge
promotion you all are doing right
now on how
to
every other car
is to merge instead
of when you're coming
up to a lane uh
closure
and you, I always get in the
lane that it says the
right lanes closed. So I get in the left
lane. Well, now they're encouraging,
don't do that. Everybody's supposed to
merge in. So that's
a campaign that I think is a
good one because
tell us what, tell
me what you want me to do and I'll do it.
I'll follow the rules.
But also I think
you need really
badly a
promotion or
something on roundabouts.
People do not know how to use
roundabouts. And so I would
suggest,
um, I, I don't think that
any of these pedestrian
or, or cycle
or fatal crashes are on
roundabouts, but
I've almost been hit several times
in a roundabout. And so I think it
would be a, just a suggestion to
bring out as
to
tell us how to use a roundabout.
We we will listen, we'll follow
the rules if we know what they
are. So that was all. Thank
you and thank you for what you do. We appreciate
you all.
>> I'm sorry. I'm laughing about
a roundabout story at
Al Gaddo. Right. There's
nothing out there,
a gas station on the corner and there's
a roundabout and
this car decided just to
go straight over the top and
straight through.
So evidently
there's a lot of people don't know that
>> Mr Chairman, we have three
in Tier C
alone.
So it's, I think
education is
key,
>> uh, representative Hochman
Vhi.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you, Secretary Cerna
and uh dot members for being
here today. It's always a great
day um, to talk
about transportation.
So a couple of
things, um I want to
start on the safety issue because
we're still on it.
Um
Mr Chair, Mr Secretary, I
know that you guys have done a great job
on collecting data. But one thing
that stands out to me is
missing here is
driver education,
where is driver education
here? And I'm not talking about,
you know, campaigns
and running ads on Kob
four. Where,
where are we
stepping in
in the driver education programs
that every 16 year old is
taking in New Mexico
to address these specific
issues? Um
Mr Chair, I, I
live in Albuquerque. I
am appalled on a daily
basis by some
of the driving that I see.
I I'm actually scared
most days I bought a bigger car
because I wanted to
have more car around me
because I see speeding is a
huge issue and I see distracted
driving is another huge issue.
And so, um Mr chair,
Mr Secretary, do you have any
plans to
intervene with driver education
in New Mexico so that we can teach these
kids how they're, they can kill other
people?
>> Mr Json. That's a good point.
And, and I know it all too well with
three teenage drivers
in, in my house and
one who's probably
added to your larger car
contribution in
Albuquerque.
Oh,
um and
so we, we
oversee the
public driver's ed programs
for the State of New Mexico. And you're absolutely right.
What we've got to do is start inserting
into that program.
Um And those programs typically
like at local high schools, right?
Some of the uh
increased awareness that
we need to see when the
behaviors but the
child, the here's been
our downfall. I'll just answer this
way. What we basically
have done is allow the federal funding,
allow to manage
what programming we offer.
So take, for example,
um road rage
take, for example, drag
racing, OK. Those are
two major issues in some of the larger
areas in the state,
but because there isn't a
federal program that specifically
says here's what we want for you to
focus on. Um Then
we're not focused on it.
And so what we've got to
basically say is, well, what are the
problems and if it's
fundable through federal resources,
great. If it's not that we got to
plug in that gap, right?
And so those are some of the challenges,
I mean, we do have funding
for like a don't text or driver
just drive campaign.
Um And those make their way
into those driver's ed programs,
but we have to do more
based on what the issues are,
not just on what
programs are available
to
through federal funding. >> Mr
Chair and Secretary
Cerna, thank you very much
for answering that
question and I would just
ask that if you do not
have any federal funding
available, come to
us, come to us
early, let us know
what it is that you need because I don't think
there's a single person sitting
in this room that hasn't been affected
by this issue
and we have to do
something about this. We can't be
number one on
a very bad list and it's
getting worse every day.
Um I'll move on Mr
Chair and Mr Secretary. Oh, and
on the same point, I want to thank
Representative De La Cruz for
bringing the Vision
Zero Memorial. It's
obviously made a huge difference
and I think it's one of the reasons why
we're talking about this today,
but um I'll move on,
Mr Chair, Mr Secretary,
I want to go back to the $70
million
project appropriation
from the, the list from the Senate
last year and
you identified one
project on here that was
$250
million more or
less. Can you give us a little more
information on what that project
is
or is it 150?
>> Oh, sure.
This >> is just a
list.
>> Oh, great.
So, um, yeah,
Mr Chair Representative.
So this project has
been uh quilted together by
a number of funding sources.
Um, some of which has been legislative
appropriations, arpa
appropriations
and I don't believe we have
any S TB funding on Montgomery
Clementi at all. And so
this project became fiscally
constrained um a
few months back and
it didn't, I don't believe that we're
closing any funding
gaps or 2024
appropriations. Um
So it, it isn't
included certainly in that list
of $70 million
projects. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair and Secretary Turner. So
to the issue of
gaps,
what is the plan, is there a
plan to, to
fund or match these
gaps? >> There
is Mr Chair representative?
Certainly. And, and I think
you've seen historically and
certainly before I arrived at the do
UT when it's
presented with a list of projects
that the legislature would like to see
worked on it, it gets
to work on those projects.
And so,
um you'll see on the
dashboard, um when,
when you're able to go on there, the
essentially, you know, the
list of those projects and what resources
we're putting there and if we're not putting resources
and why we're not, for example,
in a year, we're going to do full construction.
So let's not burn money on maintenance
right now. Things like that.
But we also know that
the sooner we get the projects
done, the more
affordable they remain.
And so we can assume that
if a project is on
a list and has partial
funding waiting
another year would likely
increase the cost of that project by
5%. Right. And so we want to get
them done sooner rather than later. So
what we're looking at doing is
two things. One is making
up those gaps with federal
target dollars, meaning
being able to say, OK, we're going to move
federal funding on there
and push down another project
that that was going to be used for
or state Road fund
resources that allow
us, you know, a lot of flexibility
to say, OK, we're gonna, we're going
to keep the whole projects. Uh
Nonfederal, put some
state resource on it and try and get it
done. So we haven't been able
to do that. You'll see here in the
snippet for district
one, we have some gaps in
district one that purple
says of those S TB
projects, we have a gap and
so we're trying to close the gap
on, on those
projects to get them done, including
like federal redistribution dollars
if possible to get them done.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and, and secretary stern and one last
question. So what
happens to those
projects that are pushed
down or are not funded that
they just kind of float
out? Stay in the ether
or do we replace them
year by year? What happens
if we give you more
projects?
>> And so Mr Chair representative
and so kind of like the process
that Denise talked about, right, is they
go through like this priori
prioritization, right? These are
the ones we make priorities
and so if they're
designed and shelf ready,
then we have opportunities there
to go after federal grants for them,
they're ready to go when we
get redistribution at the end of the year.
Like we're going through now for like $45
million we can uns shelve them and
say they're ready to go or
if we have savings um
or, you
know, a letting comes in under
a handful of them new and we have
resources otherwise, like
you said, not necessarily either, but then
they get pushed out into other years
and, and they become priorities again
in the future. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair, Mr Secretary. I'm
still waiting for my little baby
Zippy for my
desk. So that
comes out, let me know. Thank
you Mr
Chair,
my baby Zippy. They're going to do
little, the secretary promised
me that they do little
desk
to remind you of the Zippy
>> Mr chair and representative
just real quick on the
on the major project list. Just
so you're aware, this
is not just general fund funded
projects, it's all there are
projects across dot
with a variety of funding sources.
So this includes uh
projects that are primarily,
uh, state Road Fund and federal
dollars as well as some of those major
projects that you funded
with General fund.
>> Thank you, Joey. Thank you, Mr
Chair,
>> Senator Woods. >> Mr
Chair, Mr
Secretary.
We've got
backups on I
40 over by two and
carry that stretching
20 miles.
Now,
what can we do about
it?
>> Will you tell me entangle these
back up
specifically?
>> I'll sure try Mr
Chairman, Senator Woods. Thank you
for the question. Good morning, everybody.
Rick Bedia, executive director.
Um One of
the things that we're experiencing I
40 is really
hasn't been seen in some time and
that basically I 40 is
falling apart before our very
eyes. Um And we're
having a difficult time just
holding it together.
Um We are investing a ton
of money and um
some mill and inlay projects
and with those projects, we're
having to basically cookie
cut the bad parts out
and pave them in there until we can come
back with a re reconstruction project.
So basically, we're duct taping I 40
together. But
you have to remember, I think I presented
this before um to you all
in various committees is
that when you have a lane closure
on I 40 for example,
or we're at like 35
40,000 cars a day
um impacts to
that facility alone are
tremendous. Um A
lane closure will
cause, you know, 1520
miles worth of backup in
no time at all.
Um you
know, uh Chairman Munoz
experiences it on his side of
the state, on his I
40. Um
but any kind of disruption
to the traffic on I 40
will will create
tremendous delay.
Um We do our best to try
to get uh vehicles around
that, but, you know, we're dealing with uh
30% trucks.
So it's very difficult to do.
It's not an easy task
um in order to manage traffic
and to um you
know, preserve the pavement. So
we're doing absolute best
we can. But um we
are in a situation where
um we can stand out at any stretch
of I 40 right before your very
eyes, you'll see it
deteriorating pretty
rapidly.
>> And the question
I have
is there are
some detours that we
could put
up if
we have real time
information
on once those backups
start.
There are places we
can deter a lot of
traffic even
though it will be a longer
ride that
we can actually
deter traffic around
that. And,
you know, I
talked to some of those neighbors
that are over there
and watching that
and they talk about,
uh, one
afternoon, one Sunday
afternoon, they went
home from church and the
backup didn't clear till
the next morning.
Now there's, there seems
to me we could deter
that at Newkirk
and go around
by Conscious Lake and,
and give some of those
travelers some
relief
dude.
So I guess the question
is, when do
we traffic? When
do we see a big enough
problem that we
deter traffic?
>> Mr Chairman Senator Woods. That's a
good question. Um,
we start to detour traffic
when we know that we're gonna be,
um, we're gonna
shut a lane down for more
than just a single day.
So if we know we're gonna be out there
for a couple of days with a lane
closure, we start thinking
about detours at that
point, detours
a lot of times. Um,
we aren't the most
popular bunch when we start
detouring, um, heavy
truck traffic onto local roads.
Those roads weren't designed for that
type of traffic. We
realize, and we understand
what that does to those local
roads. Um, so we
are, you know, we use it as a
last resort because that's one
thing we don't want to do because we're gonna end up having
to invest and local governments
to help them uh keep their roads
up as well because those trucks will beat
that road up as well. So,
um rule
of thumb is if we're gonna have a lane
closure for more than one day, we're gonna
start talking about
detours
>> Dam,
ok. The just real
quickly, Mr Chair,
you made the
statement
that our authority is falling
apart in
front of us.
We cannot come
close
outside of Santa
Rosa.
It is
terrible.
We have to,
when are we going
to come
to the point
of reconstructing
the road?
When when does that
happen? What, what has
to happen
until we realize
the patches
are not working and
we have to get
deeper into that
roadbed
to make
the, make the road
solid. And I know that
that
the whole world changes
in front of you, the, the weight
limits and different things.
But you know, when do we
stretch the, the,
the tires on those trailers?
When do we require,
you know, other things to
happen? How
can we help you with
that?
>> Mr Mr Chairman and Senator
Woods? You know, that's a good question.
Um, a lot of those failed areas
are in development right now.
If we could move those up in the
design process, we certainly
would. But, you know, they do
take some time. So
for now we use main installers
just to hold it together until we can
get there. Um, I know
it's a, it's a big ask
but, um, you know, the districts could
spend their entire budget on I
40 alone and not even touch
another road. So we really
have to be careful and strategic on
how we plan those projects.
For example, like I said, we, we cookie
cutter those, we'll do the driving
lanes this summer since we get our money,
July 1 and we'll start
paving that stretch of I 40 but it's just
gonna be the driving lanes because we can't afford
to do both lanes.
Um, so it's just, we,
we have to sit down and start thinking
about how we, how we
plan those projects and
stretch that dollar as far as we
can >> do. We
do, we try to go to the
federal government and try to
get them to
increase our
share of that.
I mean, it's a interstate
highway.
What can we,
I know you don't have many
more answers than you can give me
today and
I apologize for trying to
put you on the spot.
But this deal
in, in another five
years,
they're gonna go completely
around New
Mexico.
They're not gonna be enough road
there. If we don't start
doing something,
we're gonna take the commerce out
of the
state.
Uh No, I'm,
I'm getting carried away here,
Mr Chair, but
we are in a heck of a shape
on, on so many
roads in the state
that not only the,
the, the
state roads are getting in terrible
shape
and
is it the fact that we're
not building to specs?
Is it the fact that we're
not, we don't
have inspectors to,
to look at the work?
Is
it,
can we have LFC
do some kind of,
of overview
on what it would
take or
can you guys do an
overview on
what it would actually take
to get that
road in
condition
that we don't have to
constantly go back
and, and, and
patch patch,
patch.
>> Uh Mr Chairman and,
and Senator, if I could just to start with your
first question about leveraging federal
dollars, and I can assure you
that um because it
is a federal aid route
that we leverage every single dollar we
can from the feds to improve
that facility. Um
I was just talking to the chief engineer. He
whispered over my shoulder that, that project
specifically that Santa Rosa I 40
stretch will be ready to go
to let this this
fall. So that's good
news. Um
You, our
project offices are,
are manned. We have great
inspectors out there.
Um They do a tremendous job out there
on our roads, inspecting
the design. You know, we use
all the information and data we can
to determine exactly um
how many easels basically in
easels, how much weight is applied to the
pavement in order to
develop a payment section
that'll, that'll handle that kind of
weight. So we're doing everything
we can in order to
um design for the future of I
40. But for right
now, you know, we're
having to deal with, with
basically how it's playing out
currently. >> OK.
11 last question, Mr Chair
and I'll get, I'll move
on. Is there
any way that we can
design an interactive
map
for the State of New
Mexico so
that our citizens
can
place
troubled areas
that you may not know
about a, an
interactive map
that they can get on the
internet and
identify
a big hole somewhere
that y'all haven't got
to yet.
Something that is a real
safety
problem. >> Um,
Chairman Senator, we're working
on that this very second
and we want for drivers
to report for things to
us. It's potholes,
it's debris on the road,
it's litter on the
shoulder and it's areas
in need of snow removal.
And so much like
if you ever use uh Google
Maps, um, you're driving
and it'll tell you that there's a crash
up ahead or that there's a speed trap
up ahead that occurs
because someone has pind dropped
those reportable items
to that exact location.
And so we're looking
at doing the same exact
thing. Um Massachusetts,
we following their model to
develop. Um
My preference is that we build
out our NM roads tool to be
able to, you're driving down, you
see that pothole you PINR
it, it will go to
an area maintenance supervisor who
have to clear the issue
so that we can also track how
long we're resolving those
issues. And
eventually the agency could get
to a point where we might be able to
quantify how much
those issues are costing us.
>> Ok. Thank you very
much for the presentation.
So just for the committee member,
I think I have everybody on
the list. So
you've attracted quite a group
of questions.
Uh Representative Garrett your
next. So let's try to get like maybe
a 35 minute question
and
short >> and sweet. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank you
dot All of you.
Uh two kudos,
the motorcycle alerts are
helpful. Um
Thank you for those electronic
billboards. Having more electronic
billboards for the issues that others
have discussed would be great.
Um My other question,
my other two questions are,
how many phases are
on theone pass?
Phase three is late
2025. Is there a
phase
45,
>> Mr chairman representative? Those
are the only phases that we
have planned. >> Thank you and Mr
Chairman. Last question is
we just toured Melbourne
and they have a totally
robust
internship program for
engineers does
dot
cultivate
internships for civil
engineers, whatever engineers you
need.
>> Uh Mr Chair representative.
Yes. Um And I'm hopeful,
I think um we, we
shared with um Joey
after the Gallup
presentation,
our um our
strategy for growing workforce
and, and one of them is essentially
building out an already existing
internship programs, our eit
engineering and training program.
And um
so we're basically kind of pumping some
steroids into that. And what
we typically do right now
is um
is try and facilitate
those internships over the course of the
summer. What we're trying to do is build
internships across the spectrum,
high school to graduate
year round um
to essentially
connect ourselves with uh
college students and, and
future engineers throughout the
year. But um
that, that's a, that's a big
interest of ours. And we,
we have now represented more than
I think we're at 50 interns
this summer, not all our engineers
but 50 interns across
state. >> Thank you. And if you
can just keep us updated,
that's it, Mr Chair
>> Senator. We
have time. Everybody stick to the
three.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank you for your
presentation on page
three of the presentation.
So I was a little concerned,
pedestrian traffic. Seven
of those are mine and
cycling's four and be
crashes are four.
So part of
it, I think on central, central
is a huge problem is
homeless, but it's also
central and Louisiana
is where the art ends and
people just go everywhere.
So is there a way to control
that? I, I don't know if there
is. >> So
Mr Chair representative, so the the
hope would be is to go out with
the city and conduct
the the road safety assessment,
road safety audit to identify
the issues, right?
And you're right, if you look at
um Louisiana Wyoming, those
intersections are big trouble spots
in in the city of Albuquerque. But
it's really to sit down and,
and as was mentioned before is
it's not necessarily all through the
lens of, you know, an engineer
or a developer, a planner
or as much as it
is, let's look at other resources
and need to come and say, you know, these are the
root issues or these are
the root issues, what are we going to do? But
to answer your question, that's
what we aim to do is go out
identify what the root issues
are and work in collaboration.
Now, what we imagine
is a lot of these
local governments are then gonna say
we can't afford that
solution, right? And that's
where we then come collaboratively
to say, here's what
we would like to do. We'd like to manage
the resources to say we've
done an audit, you hand them
the prescription and then they come to
us and say, will you give us the money now
to fill that
prescription?
>> And just to say on
lous, I live right? By
Lomas, Lobi and
Lom and Juan to, when Manzano gets
out, there's always
accidents.
So
when you're supposed to stop turning,
they just keep going. It's just
amazing. So anyway, I
understand the high school problem, but
thank you. That's all.
That's 10
oclock.
>> Thank you. I will be
brief. Um Thank you for your
presentation, Mr Chairman.
The uh the numbers that we
received do not, do they include
the interstates I
4925.
>> Uh Mr Chair,
Mr Chairman Representative, we,
we, that was the exact question. So
one of the things we're trying to respond to
is oftentime in committee,
we'll, we'll get feedback
that uh, corridor
is like the deadliest corridor in New
Mexico, right? And one of the
questions I go back and
ask our team is, is
that true? Is that really like
the deadliest one? You
know, and,
and that's difficult to
measure, right?
Because, you know,
if you look at I 40 you say,
OK, this is how many crashes were I
on I 40
together? You're thinking that's a lot
of crashes, but is it a specific
corridor? So, uh,
so we've got to do more work
to answer your question to
identify
based on crashes and
fatalities, right?
A single corridor
and then go in there.
Um So if you take, for
example, a section of I 40
by Laguna, which was recently
done, right? To address
geometry related issues,
right? Um And
then you look at the study we've done on
40 that says, let's look at the, let's
look at the length of your on ramps,
right? And that's going to be a major
contribute. So we've got to
do a better job of pinpointing
crashes on
larger corridors like that. And
that's why we focused in on
interchanges because from
a data per, you know,
synthesizing perspective,
that's the easier thing for us to do. But
we've got to be able to do better with
larger sections.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank you
secretary because again,
living in Las Uno
Laguna, many times
the traffic is diverted off I 43
New Mexico six which
is also crumbling.
Um Mr Chairman, my, my
other question is on
the data and I'm just, I know that we're not gonna
get an answer, but it would
help and be helpful for us to
understand some of the reasons for
the fatalities or what was
involved, dist
distracted drivers.
Was that uh substance
is involved? Because if we're talking about
your programs, talking about data
driven decision making,
we need to know where we're gonna fund it
because I also agree with my, my
colleague, Representative Hochman
Vhi Schools are
a big issue. Um My
last is not necessary question
um
Mr Chairman and secretary, but it's
also I would be interested at some
point to hear about what
spe special measures are being
done around schools,
around parks and around
areas that we are trying to as far as
economic development like the
downtown area. Because
as we are encouraging more people
to do this in our schools, we understand
that I would be
very interested to hear is what
kinds of measures or what additional
things are being done around this. Every
life is important to us, every
life matters.
But when we're talking about kids
and around parks, that is
something that I think that I feel
pretty strongly is that we,
that we got to take a look at that.
So I hope that was quick enough.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> It was Brown.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
So we're in house
Transportation district two
today, Carlsbad.
And I think you all know there
is, it's a very large district.
One of the pinch points, Mr
Chairman that we've had is
highway 31 the intersection
of 285
in the previous legislative
session. I had a bill
proposing a joint
powers agreement between
NM dot and
Eddie County Public
Works and Jason
Burns is there in the doorway.
He's our public works director.
So my question is
what if anything now that
the bill made it through the first committee?
But then God held
up in appropriations
due to a lack of time. But
uh what if anything has
happened on you all
working together, Mr
Chairman to get
that issue
resolved? It's been an issue
for a long
time.
Let's get 20 hours.
>> So, um
Mr Chairman representative,
we really like the legislation, first
of all. So thank you for doing
that. But right now, nothing
precludes us from entering into
those agreements, right? To
be able to do those things and we
do that on a number of fronts,
right? Um We were looking
at one yesterday with Navajo Nation
for a signal on a Nava on
a Navajo road and a state road.
Um I know that Eddie
County, for example, is entering one
of those agreements with the city
of Carlsbad for a project they
have as well. So to
answer your question is anytime
we see the need for that collaboration,
we're gonna facilitate an agreement
um much like with
Los Luna um for
their large project in their new bridge
and interchange project. So to
answer your question, we can
facilitate whatever relationship
needs to exist to get
>> Mr Chairman and Mr Secretary.
So I believe that dot
has authority
to enter into joint powers
agreements, maybe even up to
$35 million.
And that's about what I think
maybe was needed to do this
one. So is it happening
or is it not? I think that's the question
you can
but is it happening, Mr
Chairman? >> So
Mr chair
representative.
So of course, we have our
plan for 3031
and New Mexico 28.
So for the specific intersection
of New Mexico 31 and U
25 of
course, we are late at a project
this month that getting ready to go to
construction. Uh you
know, we got a great relationship with
a county. So we have a
continue a continuous
conversation about 31
on what, what's the best and how
we can expedite 31.
And that is part of the discussion.
Of course, we, we, we keep
in direct contact on the
conditions that are going out there,
specifically pavement.
And so we're in a, in a direct
contact monitoring the
corridor. And then of course,
working with the secretary on
continuing these
proposals for Joint Powers
Agreement uh in the
interim while we're working through that. Of
course, we're doing our own development
on New Mexico 31
to prepare
if, if the
agreement wasn't uh signed
and we need to go through the
traditional development
process through an N >> dot
Thank you for that. So
I hope it goes forward and then Mr
Chairman two other
things. So
uh Roswell is going to be getting
the air races that are
um we have been in
Reno and that
will affect highway 380
which is scheduled for some
work. Uh
The races won't be here
for a couple of years is my understanding.
But Mr Chairman, what
if anything do we need to do
additionally to highway
380 to be ready
for all that traffic that's gonna be
coming in, Mr
Chairman.
>> Yeah.
Um Mr Chair representative,
that was good news to hear because we
Francisco in particular had been
part of the discussions with that group
early on to encourage the,
you know, them picking New Mexico
for the next site. So we've
got to sit down certainly with the
economic development department and the
local government there to really talk
about because they have a lot of plans
around um
some uh hotel and
lodging development including RV
parks and other measures. And so
we've got to really master plan
that out to make sure that
what they're going to be doing by way
of um hospitality
and lodging is going to be consistent
with what we need to do from an infrastructure
standpoint. But it's
been described to us as an event larger
than the Ballo Fiesta um for
Roswell. And so a lot of
coordination will need to be done to them.
>> Ok. Good. That's on the right And
then finally,
Mr Chairman, I
um
just wanna put in a plug
as um chairwoman
Hochman V Hill has for the
driver's ed education
that we're doing. Um How
many questions Mr Chairman?
Anybody? Uh how many
questions are on the driver's ed
test?
>> Um Mr Chair, that,
that's not one of the questions, so I
don't have the answer to it,
but,
>> well, II I raise it, Mr
Chairman because I think we can do a
whole lot more and expect more of
our students. They're
motivated to get that driver's
license. We really need to
capitalize on the fact
that they need to absorb some information
before they become drivers on
their own.
And um I have
uh as you know, in the past,
um Mr Secretary, Mr
Chairman, I have
advocated for
educational videos
in the offices of our
MBD, uh our
MBD offices to do education
while people are sitting there
waiting to be served.
And I know there were some
issues about the monitors
that are in those offices and maybe not
capable of doing this,
but we've got to
increase our
education and I agree
about roundabouts.
I almost
lost my life a couple of times
on them because people don't know
what to do. So just,
just underscoring
>> Mr Chair actually
um again, kind of the mantra
lately for me has really
been, you know, what people
referred to R and D as research
design is uh rip off
and duplicate, right? And
so, um,
Georgia Department of
Transportation worked with
their public education department to
roll out a comprehensive
highway user
educational program that's being
taught in elementary grades
across the state. And
so our coms team has been working
on that for months to essentially,
you know, rip off and duplicate
what Georgia did for their
educational programs,
including the development of videos.
And so we're hopeful to have
uh some slow rollouts
of all of that in grade
levels um across
the state. And, and
what we're looking at again is tying
that to areas where we see high
incident rates to say
this is where we need to concentrate and
pilot all those. So we're, we're looking
at that Georgia dot model
as, as the
framework because they basically
have said here it is take it and, and
use it. Ok. That's >> great. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
I represent de la
>> Cruz.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
I understand the secretary
that local governments
really like to have
control of state roads
that traverse cities,
counties,
villages
and for a number of reasons,
zoning is
one
control of, of
that roadway is
important to them. I get that.
But one of the frustrations that I have
Mr Chairman is that
too often. And you've heard
this secretary from me before,
is that too often,
local government is really,
really bad about maintaining
the roads. A good
example in, in, in
my district, Senator Padilla's
district and, and other
Senators and Representatives is letter
Boulevard.
Uh I
can tell you that that road was
completely rehabilitated in
like 2004 5.
And since that time, up
until the, the money that
was secured by Senator
Padilla and others,
uh,
no maintenance had been done
on that road at all. And
maybe this is a bit of a suggestion
or an item to take up as part of the
Transportation. The House Transportation
Committee, is that
a that it is mandated
that if they want to have
that control of
that road, that the percentage
of their, their
annual maintenance funds be
dedicated to that
effort uh
when nothing is done
for 1015
years and, and you can tell there's
never been a patch on that road.
You see it if it was
there, I
think that's important because
uh often
local municipalities, Mr
Chair, like the, the
the glory of, of new
projects and not so much
the drudgery of
maintaining roads
and, and I think it's really something to
consider Mr
Chair that we
mandate that a percentage
of their annual road
funds be dedicated
specifically to
maintenance. And
it's, it's, it's really more of
a of a, of a suggestion and a
comment, Mr Chairman,
>> uh Mr Chair representative,
one of the things that it kind of reminds
me of a funny conversation. I remember we were
having um a
conversation with the, with the local
government and they were
telling us you've got to come
out and fix these lights, these
lights, you know, have been out
for, I don't know how many months.
And we got online and we said actually
your city has a map.
It's interactive and you
can see the ownership
of all the lights in your
city and those
are yours, you know,
and they're kind of like,
well, you know, we didn't know that.
And so the issue
is, is that over time,
municipalities sign
on for road
exchange agreements, lighting
agreements, maintenance
agreements, um
later pick up no removal, you
name it, right? And as
transition occurs, and
mayors are elected and city councils
and county commissioners are elected,
the historical knowledge of those
agreements, you know, diminishes
over time. And
so what happens is
when a new administration
comes into municipality and says, you know,
we want to get this done,
you know, can you help us out with it? Then
we go back in time and
realize, ok, the
deferred maintenance issues are tied to
this agreement and the city didn't
know that for a period of time. And
so now we gotta go fix those
things and then there's still vision
to get big things done, right?
And, and so all at once,
we're trying to resolve deferred
maintenance issues and
then this plan for a really
awesome interchange or
bypass or
whatever. And so
what we've got to do a better job
of doing and we've embarked on this with the
city of Santa Fe A.
How do we make available to
the public? Very simple
matrices and Mr Padilla
and John Romero help do
this is essentially
identify maintenance,
lighting, litter,
um weeds, snow
removal, whatever, whatever
and anybody can go on there
and say, ok, so
this is our job. We got
to stay on top of it. And, and I
think that most
administrations, if they're
aware during that budgeting
process, that, you know, we're
in charge of this, this and this on that
road, how are we going
to maintain it? Because when
the, when the citizens
start to complain about its
condition, its parts,
whatever the buck stops with
us. But a lot of municipalities just
don't know that because those agreements are
longstanding. And so what
we'll often do is we'll sit down with the
local that will ask,
will you take the road back?
And my response is typically
we will that just
shifts the finger pointing
this way, but it doesn't
materialize the resources.
Let's work on getting the road fixed
as opposed to deciding
who's in charge of fixing
it. >> Thank you, Mr
Chairman
>> representing
pedigree.
So
thank you chair and thank you secretary
for being here and your whole
team.
Um
This is
my
fourth year here
and probably
14th or 15th
year with working
directly with the dot
with respect to legislation
and pushing things
through and
that's just
recently.
Um And
so I
watch and I hear the same
story, Mr Chair
every time
and
we get back to a point
where we have an
excess,
we have the ability to
put money aside
to create a trust
or to do whatever
and to ensure that we
continue to move
forward.
And
then as 100 and 12 people,
we choose to say,
sit here and oh my
bleeding heart, II, I
hurt for you. You're not able
to get, get everything
done, but we're the reason
why you don't.
Every year,
every year, it comes
around this
year, we started
uh
a 30 day session
the week beforehand, the first
day. H
AFC. Big
Fat Gose
for projects for you
guys.
And then all the stories that came
along with it. Well, they have a billion dollars
they haven't spent. Well, OK.
Now let's talk about the truth
behind that money
and where it's funded and where
it's not and how,
when we can fund
it.
And then, so then we, oh,
well, we got 50 million, then
we got to 100 and 50 million. And
then we get to a point where,
well, you still have 500 million
that's unallocated. Ok. Now,
let's get to the truth
again about that
500 million.
But each time
between staff and
the committee somewhere,
we keep trying to roadblock you
guys
and then we come in here and we wanna
complain because your statistics
where they're supposed to
be,
we want to hold you accountable
for decisions that we
make
and it's getting kind of
old.
And
so
we, we have the
money,
we had opportunities from the
left side and from the right side
to put the trust together.
This last year,
we blew it
off.
We had opportunities to do
different things.
Um
Honestly, what the state needs
to do is we need to codify the
tip report
and then take it out of our
hands.
Don't let us get in the
way of the dot doing their
job. You got a six year, look
ahead,
get the six year, look ahead
approved between
the ST report, the temp report,
the the trip report, we
have enough data,
we know what needs to
be done.
We need to codify that in
such a way that 100 and 12
people can't sit there
and get in the way
of you being able to do your job and
then complain because you're not doing
it.
And that's ultimately what we see
today.
This is the report we get.
There's so many amazing things that
you do. Are there things that the
department could do better?
Yeah. Francisco and I talk
about it, Rick and I talked about it.
Different district engineers
and I talk about
it,
but at the end of the day,
we create the problem and
then we complain to you for not
working around the
problem.
All it took was a joint Powers
Agreement and we would be
building and
designing 31
and 285 right now,
$30
million.
What was our surplus? $3.5
billion? We couldn't find $30
million. We could
for a literacy center
but we can for a
road that has death
rates on
it.
I'm confused about that.
So I think
I would like to hear from
you on what your
thoughts are. And I've,
we've had that conversation, I'd like
everybody to hear and your
thoughts between either
codifying the ST or,
or putting a trust
fund in the place.
Something that gave you
an assurance that if
you authorized phase
one, that there would be money
coming for phase two, phase
three and phase four. Because
that's one of the biggest obstacles,
right? How do we,
how do we do that?
How do we get the economies of
scale with respect
to knowing that a
contractor, knowing that,
that there's the next
phase and they can
reduce their initial mobilization
or they can reduce their initial cost
because they're already on site and they have a
better chance not
saying that they're gonna get it, but they
have a better chance they can plan
for it. Same thing
with your maintenance plan, we
take $70 million away from
you last year and all of a sudden, we can't
figure out why we can't get maintenance
projects done
because they're spread out all over the
state.
Nobody knows how to,
how to economize
that. No
contractor knows how to co
economize that. So
I'd like to hear my first
question, Mr Chair, uh
Mr Secretary would
be,
um,
what would be your preference to
see the codified
or the trust fund
or a level of
both
>> Mr Chair representative.
Um We have seen some
states that essentially legislate
through their tip and
essentially provide recurring
funding based on a
percentage of what it costs
to, um, to
essentially fund
projects in the step.
And so we can look at
models that do that and,
um, and, and that
provides some stability and as you
mentioned, it's something that contractors are
constantly looking for, which is,
you know, we need to know um
that every year, you know, it's not an
uphill battle to get the funding we
need to provide, you know, work
for our workforce.
The uh we have
seen in some forms.
And I think the early childhood trust fund
is one how
effective establishing a
fund could be and how effective
it could be at generating meaningful
revenue for us. And
so to answer your question with
that so
long that the fund
yields um
you know, meaningful
resources for us because it could
very easily
um become
a discussion point
that says what
we invested 400 million
in the fund, um
use what's in it to
do what you gotta do. And
if it's yielding, you know,
3040 $50 million
a year, then,
you know, we might be in a position to
say we would have much rather taken
the 300 million in cash, right
to do more that way.
And so, so long that it's set
up in a way that it's yielding
meaningful resources
to us that we can get
projects done then
supportive.
Because what we're
looking at now are
measures that increase our
recurring revenue. And there's a
few of them, one of them
is of course, the excise
tax, something that
you're all familiar with, right? Which
would yield something like 100 and
$46 million of
new recurring money to dot
Every single year. And that's big for
us. We also
have done the analysis
on uh what
incremental increases
to fuel tax would look
like and what
incremental increases
to registration fees
would look like. And, and
even the idea that
not only would those
yield increased
recurring revenue to
us, but then
identify new
distribution. So for example,
if you increase vehicle registration
fees by
25%
and you break a piece of that off and
say we're going to use 12
million a year for just
making roads look good and
clean and that would
still yield another $100
million for maintenance. If
you take all those ideas together,
you could be looking at $300
million of recurring revenue
distributions. But
the challenge there is
you're putting that on road
users, right? That's
gas tax, special
fuels, tax, registration
fees. And that's the difference
between a $32
registration fee, right?
And a $39
registration fee. And
so, um,
to answer your question in
short,
recurring revenue
distributions
for the dot Provide
stability helps us to plan
better and will
certainly help contractors
make bigger investments
in doing work here in New
Mexico.
>> Thank you, chairman and thank you
secretary. I agree
and I'll learn to
shut my mic off in
between. But,
um,
I, I think we need to get serious
about that this summer and we need to
figure that piece of it
out.
Um
You know,
my colleague, >> we're gonna,
we're gonna move on pretty quick because we're
gonna get here 1115,
we said 3 to 5 minutes a piece so
we can get everybody. I
still got four people on the
list.
>> Perfect.
My colleague talked about
road notifications.
We, we had I
40 that had some
construction work with more than
an hour delays.
This last this
year,
we have all these
led, we have all these
signs on I I
40.
There would have been nice to
know that we
should have the capability to even
inform people to
know that
there's an hour delay in
Edgewood. If you're
smart, you're gonna go to the mountain range
or you're gonna take I 25
and cut across the San Antonio
giving advanced notification.
It's not like we have a lack of
science
on I 40 I
25 I
think. So there's
other options that, that we
have out there for offside roads.
But you know, there
is a point and I understand
your comment with respect
to destruction of side
roads. I live in
Lovington, a
14 month project that's
now three years long has
destroyed three side
roads.
I mean, totally decimated three
side rooms and we're all
sitting there trying to figure out how we're
gonna take care of
that.
A wind farm project
on 18,
destroyed
18
between Lovington and
Hobbs and
it's still not resolved.
So I think giving
some,
giving some notifications
out there, putting some things out there
would be great.
So, um, I'm
gonna take the rest of this offline.
Um, to disagree
with cutting this
short, I don't like being
presented to for so
long that we don't actually
as the committee get
to ask the questions that are
relative to the constituents
that we have,
we need to get to a point
where we actually have
hearings
and we're able to ask the
questions and
not be stonewalled
by long presentations
on short time frames.
Thank you.
>> Well, we had 17 people
on the list. That's
11 person
didn't ask a question.
So, Representative
Chatfield,
>> thank you.
Let me turn this thing right here
on. Uh, thank
you, Mr Chairman. Uh,
you know, our roads have decayed
in New Mexico over a long
period of time and
we hadn't had a lot of money to
put into them. Now, we have some
money. I appreciate
the good job you all do
and I will continue to vote
to send some of that money to
you. And when we talk
about a, a fund
or something many things,
once you spend it, it's gone. But
on our roads, if we put that money
into a road years
later, it's still there. So it
is an investment in our
state and it's something
that'll last. It's like putting
it aside because
we have fixed that road.
Uh,
Senator Woods is correct.
I 40
is, is terrible. I, I
don't know. It's, the traffic
is
enormous on it. Most
of it, trucks. So we need
to do something that,
what I want to talk about a
little bit was the pedestrian
accidents?
I think we all know
that. It's
probably not
your, although it's part
of your job, it's not your job to
fix that. The
homelessness in Albuquerque
and Santa Fe is
outrageous.
I, I was going down
cris one day and there was a guy
stuck out in poor
guy was just stuck with his little
cart in traffic and he'd pick
up his foot and put it down, pick
up his foot and put it down. He
couldn't go. Finally
somebody, the guy, the
car in front just put his car
in park got out, helped
him across the street. I mean,
there's cars
everywhere and they,
they're all backed up for this man
and, and it's
sad, it's really sad.
We're going to, it's not
your agency that's gonna have to
fix that. We're gonna have
to have a serious
talk about whether it's
ok to live
in the middle of the
median you know, to
be out there
because
if I hit one of
those people, then
it, then it ruins my
life. You know, it's not
good. Last
year during the legislature,
they broke into my car,
knocked the window out, stole
my computer, stole all my
little notebooks which
have
wonderful notes that I take
all these meetings, which mean
nothing to anybody.
I know they threw it in a dumpster
and, and, uh,
but it caused me a lot of misery,
you know, and, and it's not,
you know, freedom is the right
to do anything you want to do as long
as you do harm another person.
It's a real simple concept
that I was taught when I was a little kid,
it's becoming harmful.
So I think we're gonna need to
talk about, I appreciate you
all doing what you
can to do, deal with it. But
that is an issue that
we as a legislature,
uh, we're
gonna have to deal with that
elsewhere with some other
agencies >> and,
and Mr Mr chairman and,
and representative, and
I don't, I don't want to be shameless here.
But, but II, I
ask you all to see the
connections, right? Because as you're
aware, you know, the governor
is working on a special session
to address some of the root issues
that are related to mental
health issues, repeat
offender issues to
homelessness issue. And even the
idea of panhandling in
medians where in
my hometown, like the city of Espanola.
They, they've made some strides to
say, hey, this is a safety issue
on medians of this with
and, but there, there
are root issues that, that
contribute to uh
metrics that dot
is responsible for reporting
on. And that is um
when we start to do these
audits um
issues that are non
infrastructure related but
more social services
related. >> So Mr
Chair, I just would say that
we need to offer help
to these people,
offer them help
to restructure their lives.
And if they don't accept it,
then maybe we need to take a little
more firm stance.
And I thank you for your
time,
Senator
Campos.
>> There you go. Thank you
very much, Mr Chairman. First of all, I
want to thank the dot
Commission. You,
Mr Secretary, your staff
for the ongoing efforts
that you put forward to
keep us safe and to continue
to maintain our roads,
which leads to the
question itself. I'm
real concerned with
the public safety and
particularly the uh maintenance
patrols to get out there to continue
to maintain our roads,
highways, interstates and our
bridges and the
question that I have and then
I'll uh visit with you
offline regarding other
things uh is
with the speed cameras. Did
anything ever develop in regards
to that during the construction
zones? >> Sure, Mr
Chairman, Senator, so,
um speaking of the
special session is we're working with
the governor to align that
piece of legislation with
the special, special session
theme of public safety.
And so we're still having discussion
about a provision that would
allow us with DPS to
do that independent of counties.
Right now, we have the authority,
the legal authority to
work with a county to pass
an ordinance, giving us the authority
to put speed cams in construction
zones. It's an extra step
that we take, for example,
um you know, we could have worked with Santa
Fe County to place those cameras
in Lavalava. But as you can imagine,
that's a measure that takes time.
So the legislation that
we've already drafted would
provision if it is our
road. If it is a construction
zone, we can place them there in
partnership with DPS.
>> Thank you very much, Mr
Chair. >> Thank
you, Representative
Maestas. Thank
you, Senator
Senator. I'm sorry, >> Aute.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you,
Mr Secretary. Um couple.
I know it's a lightning round.
Um
But with regards to
uh pedestrian
fatalities, there
was a, there's
a task force, it's called the
Intimate Partner Death
Review task force or
whatever. And it reviews
all of the domestic violence
homicides. Now,
granted it has a different purpose.
It looks at how many times
that couple was involved in the criminal
justice and where the gaps
were and if any errors were made or
whatever do you does dot
Keep stats
or on,
on the circumstances
with regards to pedestrian deaths, for
example,
uh
you know, with all due respect to the,
to the, to the
decedents they're
in the roadway. You know what I mean? So,
was it, was it at a
crosswalk at
a, at a red light
or, or was it,
um, or was
it in a place where
there was no lighting? And the person
was wearing black clothes? And
the driver was 10
o'clock, two o'clock driving
35 miles. You know what I mean? In other
words, there's certain aspects
of these, the fatalities
that just can't be helped because of societal
problems. Uh, I
don't think a lot of these fatalities
are because of the curves and
the, and the signals of the,
of the roads. It's just because of these
horrible circumstances. Anyway,
do you guys keep stats on,
on the specific
circumstances of those
fatalities and, and, and try
to figure out
why these are happening in
such disproportionate rates to the
rest of the country.
>> So
Mr Chairman Senator, if
you go to like page 19, you don't have
to go there but evaluated and proo for
needed the data and data deci
decision making process.
And so no,
the data that we collect
in a word. No, and we've got to do
better. So the data we collect obviously
is coming from police reports
of the incident,
right? And
so um those reports
then ultimately roll into
a database and we use the
support of UN M to essentially
bring that data to us in a more clean
way. But what can
happen from from time to time
is um
the reason could be listed
on the police report as impairment
and we're unsure whether or not the
impairment was on the driver's part
or if it was on the pedestrian or the
cyclist part, right. Or
on, um,
on anybody on another part.
Right. So what we've got to
do and, and even in some
instances, the location
could suggest that the
incident occurred at the
intersection, but it could have not, it
could have occurred near the intersection.
Right. So, uh we
actually submitted a, a federal
grant that could bring
the resources that we need to
build out that system for more
real time reporting.
But we also got to get all law
enforcement agencies on
board with using it, right? So
that not only are they generating the
reports but they're generating
um the database that we
need to kind of synthesize it in a
more accurate way so that we can
say it was
impairment, but the impairment was on the
driver's part or the impairment was on the
pedestrian's part. And
so there are some states that are
sophisticated enough for
a Monday report is we
can show you where all the crashes
and fatalities occurred
here with
some qualifiers that may
mean, well, this person was
involved, they were injured and they're in
the hospital, but
if they don't perhaps
pass away for two
weeks and we get updates on that.
So we got to do a better job of
getting cleaner data. Cool.
>> Thank you, Mr
Mr Chairman. The um
and maybe we can train some of the officers
because the, the forms, the traffic
forms that officers fill out are
for drivers
impairment, check the box. Yes.
No, maybe so. Maybe in the
narrative they can help us get
compile better stats. Also.
I just want to thank you, Mr Secretary
for the, for cutting
back. Our
eliminating the FTEs
went from 18% down to
14 in a year. That's
fantastic. Uh
One last note, Mr Chairman,
the maybe
we can talk about it in rest up,
but I think this committee needs to
keep an eye on it. We,
our gas tax in 1992
was 17 cents a
gallon. Our gas
tax in 2024
is 17 cents per gallon.
Now, granted, no one's going to raise
taxes with $4 billion
surplus.
But, you know, if, if
more people are driving electric
cars and,
and, and if the surplus
dips, we're, we're
in big, big trouble. So if we
were to say, raise
the gas tax a penny a year
for 20 years
would be at 38
cents in 20
years, that still would be
way behind inflation. 9,
17 cents in 1992
is 38 cents today.
Um And so in
the late nineties,
uh state government
built, you know, Redid, I
25 I 40 did the,
did the road to Farmington
in the early two thousands. We
bonded a billion dollars and did
some good projects in
the teens. We paid,
paid off the bonds,
uh didn't really do a whole lot
and now we have a wonderful opportunity
to really improve the roads and
the economy here in New Mexico.
So, so let's just
keep an eye on it uh from both
of our chambers on what
projects can really boost the
economy in addition to just,
you know, repaving existing
roads. And so if you look on
page one,
the, the blue,
uh the, the chart, the blue
chart says operating
budget, but that's
not the agency's
operating budget. That's, that's
money that comes from the gas tax,
correct?
>> So, Mr Chairman Representative,
that is the agency's
operating budget. It comes from
the gas tax from federal
funds from special
revenues that the department receives
for specific
purposes. So it's, it's
everything that the department
touches. >> Understood. Understood.
Thank you. Thank you, sir, because it's
not necessarily the
the cost of the of the
office building, but it's the money
that's spent on dot
Roads and projects.
>> Mr Chair. It includes
>> both. Absolutely. And
then uh and then
Mr Chairman and gentlemen, the
uh the 544
million uh
in capital
is that,
was that
544
in the capital budget or, or, or
distinct from the capital budget
that we passed?
>> So Mr Chair
and Senator. So that
is the number that was
in the capital bill.
So about
320 million of
that was those major infrastructure
projects funded with the severance
tax bonds. The remainder
of that was there was some, some
money for dot to build
out electric vehicle charging
infrastructure. And then there was
uh funding there for
local road projects. So
money that flows through dot To,
to local projects. >> Understood.
Thank you. And then,
um
and then lastly, Mr Chairman,
uh the uh
and I could, I could,
we could guess on
why, but our gas
tax gets allocated by a
percentage, you
know, uh aviation
this and I, I understand why our
predecessors did that so
nobody could fight and it was all
determined, but that's
like a living in a scarce
resources world.
We no longer live in a scarce
resources world. And so
we should consider
uh not only tinkering
with that but eliminating that
so that the money then
gets appropriated based
on what's a good dollar spent
because many times when those,
those things are earmarked,
it, it becomes a a ceiling
and not a floor. So
we should take a look at those individual
budgets, particularly aviation
uh and the smaller towns to
really boost the local economies
and things like that. Thank you, Mr
>> Chairman. Thank you. I
think we're going to kind of wrap it up
here. Let me ask some questions.
I know that that the
the in the work zones
that the speed cameras need to be put
in place immediately,
not waiting for
legislation to happen.
Those are simple operating
agreements between the county and
the state, right? Every
contractor I've seen a few
of them last week are saying
we want speed cameras in those
zones because of work safety. I
mean, it's their
employees, they don't want to go to
the funeral. So that's
a simple, very simple fix
to get done.
Uh, and not
wait for legislation and,
and do that because that's a matter
of life safety, same thing with
the, the driving and the safety
issues. What's
troubling to me in this legis? That
report is if we look across
on page one in the
charts
and we look at road conditions in
2018, you know,
we're all pretty much
except for,
uh, non,
non highway,
non, I can't
read that
one
and I
see
non national highways.
We were below in, in state
roads but everywhere
else in 2018, we were pretty
much in the, in the 90%
tile. I mean, even
right at 95%
some of them, then
we hit 2021 and we're
seeing this really big downturn
across the board in all
these roads.
Uh,
and
I, I just can't, the amount
of money we put in there
2019 to 2023.
They had
$1.6
billion scattered
throughout some
in specials. There's still 500
million left sitting over
there.
If you look to the chart to the right
in 2024
you receive more than $2
billion in appropriations
for transportation
programs.
$2 billion
right was
appropriated, you can
create a fund. But in,
in road constructions
you need today's dollars moving
today, not
saving money for the future
and saying, OK, we're gonna have this fund.
So if something downturns, we're going to
do this, but $2
billion in 2024.
And how many lettings were there in
this last one? Letting
one
this last month?
Um
Yeah,
and two
lettings and,
and we have $2 billion
that's gonna come out in
what's today?
18 days
and we have
$2 million and we're
only doing two lettings.
Is there a reason for
that
>> Mr Chairman, if I may, if
you would like for us to present
where we are with expenditures
and encumbrances on all of those
one time appropriations, we
can provide that to you by
tomorrow. I think the
suggestion that we're sitting
with unexpended $2
billion at dot
is is far
from accurate, but we can provide you
with. >> That's not what I said. Look at the
legis that to the right and read
it in writing, there's $2 billion
appropriated in the
2424
sessions
in the
report, the
loc report in
2023
through those years, there's 1.6
billion and there's roughly 500
million unspent in that
time frame. So
that's do the math
2.5 million,
right? But we
have the
largest amount we've
appropriated in the last couple of
years and
we're only seeing two lettings coming
out with 15 days coming
into the new budget year.
I mean, that's, that's
not getting money spent
and getting roads fixed and
constructed.
>> So, so Mr Chairman, just for
clarification,
right,
the $2 billion
is our budget, right? And
so 1.2 billion
of that comes from
our, our tax
distributions and our federal apportionment.
So I think that's clear, right?
Suggest it's suggesting
that there was one time
appropriations of $2
billion in the legislature. So
the $1.2 billion
is encompassing of our
operational budget
and that's big, right?
So then what you also
have and, and then just a
reminder right, that this budget
becomes available next
month. And
so what we're doing now
is we're working with the 1.2
billion is our operational budget.
The dashboard which
we've talked about is going to
track the sum
of the $320
million for S TB projects,
the 120 million and the
70 million. So,
um so I think going on
to, I think moving forward,
you'll be able to see where that
funding is going. But the
$2 billion is inclusive
of our 1.2 annual budget,
not just one time appropriations
for projects,
>> but if your 1.2 is inclusive,
then those projects that should be
moving forward no matter on an annual
basis, should be in
your budget and should be bidding
and letting go in those
lettings. I
mean,
plus, I mean,
we're doing rough numbers through your
2023 balances
and coming up with 500
million. That's still unspent from
2020 through the
December of 2023
incumbrance. I
mean, everybody sitting here in this
committee, you
know, we're all concerned about
driver safety, right?
Texting whatever the
cause is,
we can address that
through
whatever issues, more training,
requiring people
to um
they get a ticket, go back to
defensive driving school to get
out of it and, and more training.
But at the end of the
day, you
have what other agency
in the state has $2 billion to
spend,
>> I would defer to Joey, but
I imagine Doh has a larger
budget or HSD has a
larger budget than we do.
>> You might have got that one,
right.
>> So Mr Chair, apart, apart
from public education
and uh and the the
health care authority, so
what you're spending on public schools and what
you're spending on Medicaid
dot has the, has the
largest budget >> and
in, in the, the
history on page one is
not telling the story that we wanted
to tell because the more money
we put in dot
The worse roads we're
getting
that chart should either be
flat or
leveling out or
on the increase for, for
road repair, road maintenance. And
it's just not happening. I mean sure
there was some high cost during a couple
of years but that still
we pump more money and more
money 46%
increase since
2018,
right? We know
inflation hasn't hit that
high at 46%.
So how are we gonna change that
chart on
page one?
So those road, those roads
start ticking back up the other way
and just excludes I
40 cause I 40 is
just,
it's a mess. I I
don't know how you fix I
40
adding an additional two lanes
is 3 billion. We can't even maintain
22 lanes, right?
I mean, it's gotta be law
enforcement that's got to start
maintaining I 40
putting some, some restrictions
on there I mean, when they had
the train wreck at gallop
right outside of gallop of the state
line. Right.
I went out there and the Arizona
State police were begging us to
open the road because Arizona
has never seen that big of a
mess from Phoenix to
everywhere. And so
I 40 is an exclusion. So,
how do we fix these other
roads
with a record amount of money
pumped in there? I mean, do we
have a plan for that or do we
just saying we're just gonna
hodgepodge everything here and
hodgepodge everything there?
>> Yeah, I, I do have a response,
Mr Chairman. So I think
the, the point going back to
last summer, what we were trying to do,
especially with the district engineer
priorities, tying their
priorities to car reports
and tying, you know,
the data that we're talking about
here to what we're selecting
is, is essentially
tying those investments
to where dot Says this
is where they need to go.
But if you look for example,
right at an exercise of
saying, all right,
everybody pick a road. We have
$70 million. We're going to pick a
road without saying
dot Tell
us where this money can best be
spent and
sitting here and answering questions
like when are we going to fix I
40. Right. Well, what if we had
$70 million to put
near Santa Rosa and Tucumcari
and I 40? But now
what we're gonna do is we're gonna put
500 to $1.2
million of maintenance on
small corridors
that dot didn't have
a chance to run through the process
that we say helps identify
where we need roads the
most. And
so I, and again, right,
if you look at the $2
billion going back to
2019,
we've probably received like
25 million of it and
said here, make sure that we aren't
hitting wildlife, right?
But we didn't put it towards let's
not hit people. And
so I think to answer your question
in short, it's trusting
the men and women here to say
this is how we pick where
we need to put money.
And when the money comes,
letting them put it on those
roads, as opposed to
saying, you know, we'd
much rather do it this way
and try and, you know,
make the, the numbers look
better on, on the back end.
And so I think that's
really the answer to your question
is they know better than
I do and they definitely know better
than nonen engineers.
But when they say this
is how we pick our priorities
and, and, and we
first walk into a legislative
session with $60
million to try and fix them
and spend 30 days battling
on the back end. We get a list of
50 roads that
they never put on a piece of paper.
And then you ask the
question, why aren't these roads getting
better. We're saying, well, we probably
wouldn't have put the money there to begin with.
So I think it's
spending the next several months
trusting us and
this team to
say this is where we need the money,
not just in general, we need the money
because, you know,
if you know that
says 40 billion
and we only really had the
discretion to spend a third of
it, then we should only be
accountable for that
third.
>> Well, I mean, you,
you're putting a very good spin on
it, but he drives the
roads at Los Lunas. They drive
the roads in Albuquerque. She drives
the roads at reserve in
that way. He drives
the road to Mascaro
in that way.
Uh I 40
Grant and Gallup, I
go all the way to Shiprock. That
road is, has a better that
Disneyland has just a good a
ride as, as that road of
491.
Um Santa Fe
Albuquerque,
uh Tucumcari,
Farmington,
Albuquerque,
Eddie County
Carlsbad,
Albuquerque.
You guys are based in Santa
Fe. We drive
the roads,
I mean, 90%
of us drove the road
down here, right? And we drive them
every day in our districts,
whether we're going to Walmart
or we're going to wherever
we're headed.
Um The only
technologies that's going to take you out
of legislators picking road is
liar. And
if people didn't see this
slide show, Arizona
requires
Lidar on every road
currently. Now that gives
a road survey and
tells, tells
them what the
road conditions are, where the
potholes are and can
mark those to
exact degrees.
And, and I'm
not a legislature that picks
roads, but I'm a legislator
that drives roads and then I
know the road conditions.
Right. Gallop
to Zuni. I mean, it
just, it looks
like ants marching down the
hill in the morning and it takes
five minutes to get out, but the
same road out, remember the road out
here? I mean, it
took us five minutes to get out
right there. Right. Why don't we put
temporary lights? Why don't we do some
restrictions to, to
start controlling that?
But I mean, with
the amount of money we have that
chart in legist that
has got to start changing
immediately and only
having two lettings knowing
you're coming into
a $1.2
billion plus the other
$800 million
and not having those projects ready
to go in the beginning of the
year. And
it is just not gonna
work. I mean,
I go to Grants and, and
Grants is so excited about
seeing orange barrels in their streetss
because they're fixing water pipes and they're
fixing other
things. I mean, the rest
of us has just got to get used
to. You're gonna have
complaints but you want better roads
but let them complain about it.
But something has got
to change. Uh
And that chart has got to change
rather quickly in the next
year to two years
because
money is not gonna be here forever.
And this is the most money you
guys have had
in.
How, who's been there the longest
Rick who's been there the longest, what's the
most, what's the most amount
of money you've seen in your time at
0.1
billion for one interchange
right now,
you have three quarters
of the 700
some million
in one year just for roads
while there's some interchanges in there
too. But I,
I mean,
we got to get back to that
2018 point. Then we can
begin to, to say, ok, we
can maintain the roads.
But I mean, I had to drive a semi
back from Las Luis the other
day and I
swear wherever the road
went up to the bridge,
right? You better have
your seatbelt buckled
and, and
in a semi that
because it was gonna bounce
you out of the seat.
And those, some of those were brand new
bridges and where they meet,
I mean,
tell us at the point where,
what, where are we
gonna get these jobs, let and where are we
gonna get them constructed and how
fast are we gonna get them
done?
>> So, Mr Chairman, I think Joey's
provided the letting schedule for the next
year and the legislative report. But take, for
example, the 320
million in projects,
right? So those
projects were funded with S TB.
So what we've got to do
because that's different from the way
we were funded in the past
is we have to time the letting
of those projects now with the timing
of the bond sales. And so the
bond sales which will occur in
December and in June of next
year, what we've got to
do is get those
projects ready
and time the letting of the
projects with the bond sales. And so
that's why in the dashboard that
we've created, we'll
show you when we're gonna let them
relative to the bond sale that
we're gonna sell them with.
>> Yeah, but those are sponge
bonds. Those are,
those are cash overnight cash
that are just bonded out and
spent. What was it? 58
million.
>> So, so Mr Chair in,
in the in the letting schedule
on page
two
you'll see in the, in the third quarter
of fy 25 there
is
about 229 million
that does include some
of the S TB
projects. Um, the, those
additional pro so my
understanding is those additional
bonds will be sold in, in the
June sale. And then that
will show up on the fy
26 letting
schedule. I think one of the things Mr
Chair we can do is
work on um
getting a uh a
better list of
the, of the special appropriations.
And when
um
when that money is, is scheduled
to be under construction
and, and out to let, and we
can include that in the,
in the follow up report, we can include that in
the follow up on this hearing.
>> But we, we, we
pre bid or pre lett,
right? Just call it bidding,
pre bid projects. So we know what the
costs are right
and, and pre BD
them. And then when the money
comes in, we say, ok, now the money
is available, but now
you're the contractor, why aren't
we pre bidding
those projects to say? Ok, you
got the contract and
if it's a bridge,
it takes six or eight months
to get the
material.
Uh So, >> so Mister
Mister Chair, I don't, I don't know
anything about
that pre bidding process. I
may perhaps someone
from the department could,
could answer
that
>> Mr Chair members of the committee Thank you David
Quintana, chief engineer dot
So we do
provide that
ramp up time in our
contracts when we know there's going
to be long lead items, Mr Chair,
whether it be signal signal,
a lot of signal
items associated
with signal installations have long lead
times, lighting, um
different uh
uh um you
know, beam, beam, beam
manufacturing, all the, all all
those types of things we provide
that type of uh ramp
up time is what we call it in the
contract in order to get
the project um advertised
and let um when we
have planned. Um
But so we do account for that
in the contract time.
>> Ca what like what's a normal
contract? Bridge is a
while,
right?
>> Mr Chair members committee, it
really depends on the scope of the work,
right? I mean, it, it could
typically be from
anywhere from a year to
multiple seasons
like Lavada was, you know, a
2.5 season project and
we're anticipating Montgomery Comanche
the last three years. So
it really just depends on the, on the nature
of the scope,
>> ok? I,
I just think, I don't know
some of that stuff. We can't create
efficiencies in but a lot
of the maintenance stuff and we can.
So if, if it's gonna take
that long to bid projects and we're just
gonna put more money to
maintenance
and just say, you know
what, once you guys
have all that, that completed,
we'll just put 300
million in maintenance and
you guys are just gonna have to figure out
how you're gonna, how you're gonna cover
the rest of the cost. And
I mean, everybody here has a maintenance
issue,
everybody here has
a traffic issue
and, and there's a lot to
do. I just
Senator Rodriguez.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Good morning Rick
and your staff. And of course, our
staff, uh, let me
just reiterate a
little bit about what has been
said here today because I
carried the bill on the
statewide capital outlay
and we discussed the
amounts and what
would be the best way, the
faster way to distribute
the funds, uh where
it would have to, it would
keep you from having to bond
and so on so we can get the
projects out quicker.
And that was one of the main reasons
why the legislature decided
to go with sponge bonds,
which are overnight cash,
basically. But
then the other
part of this is that the
220 million that
we appropriated in addition
to the 300
some of the 320
of sponge bonds, those
are in specials. And
that is cash too, pretty
much because it's a
general fund allocation.
And so because
it's not severance tax
money and instead it's
general fund, you would
have that available pretty
quickly. And I think
that's probably one of the
things that is crossing
our mind here is because
we went through great strides to
provide outright cash for
you to have. So it doesn't have to be bonded
and wait for the bonds to
sell and that kind of thing
then. Um so
we can get these projects done as
quickly as possible. And
I, I can't imagine your workload.
I'm sure you've got a humongous
one to say the least.
But I just wanted to
elaborate on that a little bit, but
that being said, I just have a quick
question and I'm going to move on
um on the projects
that you have. I
know it takes for your project
schedule. Um
Secretary um
several years, it's a
multiple year process.
Um How
do you end up having
to do change orders for
those during the process?
And how do you ensure that
completion is done and
you follow that over four
years, three years, whatever it may
be because that would be hard to do.
But tell me if you have
change orders happening quite
often or so on.
Thank you >> have,
you can come up and I'll just get started
generally with that. So,
uh yes, those can occur,
right? And so what,
what essentially will happen, especially
with federal participation is that
there's a process that
requires, you
know, approval beginning in our project
managers, approval
at our federal highway
partnerships before all of
those take place. And so the
justification behind
them um or let's just
put it this way. Um The
support of them is for very
limited reasons and I'll let
David talk a little bit about them,
but it's our measure
of ensuring that when we bid
and get under contract for a
project that we essentially
finish that project, um
without having to exceed that dollar
amount.
>> Mr Chair Senator.
Um, so, yeah, every single project
is gonna have a change order in it no matter
what if, if there,
I've never in my life
seen a project not have a change order in
it. That's a regular, just
regular business to do day
to day business, whether it's
um you know, just updating
to final quantity because we
never ever
get, um, you know,
20,000 cubic
yards of burrow right on,
on, on the knots, right. So we
got, we'll have to adjust
quantities and then ultimately adjust
G RT S. And so every single
project does have change orders just
varying degrees. >> I
see. Ok. So I
suppose you would make every effort
as you estimate the cost of
the project. So, so as to
minimize the number
of change orders because every time you
do it slows down, the
process
increases the cost,
>> Mr Chair Senator. So, yeah,
and we also add a contingency
with our engineers estimate,
accommodate for what
we see as a history,
you know, historic average
of, of uh change orders
typically about
5%. Um
And then when you throw in G RT, we
usually use AAA contingency
of about 8% or so.
So, um, we do take
that into account and, and,
and typically we stay
within that contingency.
>> Thank you very much. Thank
you for the responses. That's all I have,
Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you. So
I guess we'll see you in our, our next
meeting, but we're going to get
some numbers and some stuff straightened
out. The cattle guards in
mckinley County had better get straightened
out because those
are county owed, they're not
state-owned.
Um, and
I, you know that our county has
$60 million worth
of
reserves, cash
balances, they
have the money to, to fix those
on their own when
we could spend whatever dollar amount
there is
fixing 491.
Right? I mean, I'm serious
about 491. I wasn't
speeding or anything.
It's pretty much as good as a ride
as, as a roller coaster
Disneyland.
And, and the problem
is
the poorest people
that have to drive the farthest
to work
in a road condition that
damages their vehicles.
It's more costly to them
than it is to anybody
else. And
so those
things got to get fixed in, in
maintenance, but
we're going to be keeping a close
eye. I
really, I
really think if you really
want to get out of
legislators picking
roads,
do a road condition vehicle,
Arizona just passed a law that,
that everybody has
to do a road condition and road
recording and, and
everything and, and I
know that because someone I know
that's in, has one of these on their
vehicle and
they're recording everything they
can in Arizona to,
to give road conditions. And if you don't
want legislators, I don't really pick
roads. I'm not one of those
legislators that said
I want this road fixed and I want
that road fixed, but we
drive a lot more roads
than, than
anybody around.
But this is your way
out of that.
Then you can get road deterioration,
you can get road deal. I
40 is just gonna be
continuing to be a
mess until
you guys get with the state
police and start running a
whole bunch of law
enforcement, get
weight and distance on the
highways, get,
get state police to start
track ticketing those
trucks swerving
and the word word will
spread. I mean,
there's not, I don't think there's a piece
of standing guardrail
from the Texas
line to, to
the Arizona line. Right?
And it's all because of semi just
swerving and
driver distraction
in semis. It really
cost us.
So thank
you guys for your presentation, Mr
Chair. >> Did you want to do
real quick, a recap
for follow up for the next legislate
hearing? I took some notes on,
on some of the issues that were brought
up. So in
the project management
area, it look there
was a little bit of
discussion around I 40
conditions and maybe taking a closer
look at some of the future
planned projects on I
40 the funding gaps
for those projects
in the future as well as
taking a look at U S3
80 as
well. Um Looking
at the
possibility of using some
real time time alerts
to allow the public to
identify some, some current
road issues. >> You know, they do that
in Arizona. I think
there's one every 40 or
50 miles and every
time I go to Flagstaff or
something, it says
one hour and 15 minutes
to Flagstaff, right? Or
wreck ahead in
an hour.
And so you, I mean,
but ours are all
dark. None of them are
ever lit up. The one by
grants I
represent Garcia's
House is just never lit
up. So >> Mister Mister
Chairman, we can take a look at that for follow
up for the oc- October legislative
hearing the other um
in mo in the
um in the project
in the sorry, in the traffic safety
area. So we um
heard some more about a
possible projects
um or, or programs
related specifically to drivers
education and a little
more education for the for the
youth in, uh, in New
Mexico and in
emphasizing maybe the
ability to try to take a
look at what's involved in
fatal crashes and, and building
that into the driver's ed curriculum
as well as the
department's work
in looking at those safety
audits and, and see if
we can identify some of
those issues through
the safety audits.
And that's what I
had for, for follow up for the
October hearing.
I'm sorry, what we
just mentioned about
taking a look at
the special
appropriations and getting
a uh a little clear guide
of, of when,
when the money is going to be let when,
when the, the spending plan
by fiscal year. So you can see,
you know how, how much is going to be spent
in Fy 26 in Fy 27
and Fy 28
>> except you got the month
wrong. July,
August
September.
Ok.
>> Ok. Thank you, >> Mr
Chair.
Uh
Kelly.
Maybe we can use some unspent
capital to get them
cash
to,
can
I don't want to hear my list. I may leave
the room. I know I'm in the red.
I throw up my hands
honestly. Just all
my projects are in the red.
So
>> your capital projects
will not be the focus of this hearing.
Don't worry, Mister Chair.
Um All right members,
we're behind Tab H and your
binders. Um I'm
Kly Cars Well joined
by Antonio Ortega
and we are LF C's capital.
All a analysts
um we're gonna give you
uh another report
on
capital outlay
projects uh and
infrastructure needs in the
community you're in.
So I'm gonna start out with
a kind of overview
of Eddie County
and the communities we
highlight in the project spotlights
which are Carl's bad and
loving and then
Antonio will take you through a couple
specific projects.
So starting on page one of
the memo, you can
see that local entities in
county received 70
capital appropriations
totally for totaling
$42 million
from 2019 to
2023. And
as of April, about
45% of that had not
yet been spent.
Um There are also some
higher education and statewide
projects in this county that has,
have received appropriations
totaling a little over
$10 million over that
same time period.
And then in table one, you
can see how the local
capital appropriations in
this county break
down by entity
uh with the largest
dollar amounts going to Eddie
County and Carlsbad
followed by Artesia
and Loving
if you'll turn to page two
of the memo.
Um
Also wanted to point out that
during this session, local
entities in this county received
a little over $9 million
in capital outlay appropriations
and the largest of those went
to Carlsbad for some
infrastructure needs. I'll
highlight in just a second.
Um Eddie County
was also one of the beneficiaries
of the
transportation package in
the capital bill using severance
tax bonds with up
to 70 million authorized
for improvements to us. Highway
180
um significant to the
capital landscape down here
right now is that uh
many local governments
in this area have seen
revenue increases recently
related to the oil boom
that has increased their ability
to self fund projects
or bring additional
local match to projects
through um
other state and federal funding
sources.
And in the third bullet on the
top of this page,
um you can also see
that the extent to
which local
entities here have
seen uh revenue
increases has varied.
Um So with Eddie
County, for instance, seeing
a much more dramatic increase in
revenue than
Carlsbad and a
bigger gap between
revenues and expenditures
relative to the city,
uh which you can see more
specifics on in that local
government dashboard that Emily
provided at the beginning
of the meeting.
So jumping now to
Carl's bad,
um
We saw kind of some common
trends in visiting communities
down here in terms of how they
were
prioritizing
some of the revenue increases,
we some of the revenue
increases that they've experienced.
So in Carlsbad, in
particular,
um they've
seen an increase in Lodgers
tax uh and
they have used that to
invest in quality of life
projects in the city,
some of which they self
funded and some of which
they've brought local match
um to leverage state
grants.
Antonio will report
on one of those,
the Cavin Theater Cavern
Theater, historic rehab
um
uh which is one of the projects
where they use Lodger ta Lodgers
tax in addition
to state grants.
Also some of the things you
see along the river here,
this new water park,
a new park that you might have seen some
fencing around that's being
improved with the splash
pad. Um These
are other examples of
quality of life projects that the
city has self
funded with that Lodgers
tax revenue.
The city of Carlsbad also
has um some
sig significant
infrastructure needs related
to its growth
and one of the primary areas
of infrastructure need
they have is water
and sewer.
Um
So
let's see
um over
the past four years from 2019
to 2023 and then
also including the 2024
session uh
thematically. So
from that fouryear period, Carl,
the city received
about $15
million in capital outlay
appropriations and
the largest of those were for
water and sewer projects.
Uh This year, again,
the largest capital L A
appropriation they received
was for a sewer expansion
project on National Parks
Highway. And the
size of that appropriation just to
give you a sense of scale was
$1.4
million. Um
So interestingly,
Carlsbad has done a
lot of work to diversify
its water supply and is in
quite a good position.
Um in terms of water supply
going forward, they've
done that through having
groundwater rights to
distinct
aquifers
and kind of the one caveat
here is to
um to really
realize the sense of
security in terms of water
supply for the city.
They will need to
make additional investments
in hard, in hard
infrastructure to
train, translate those
paper water rights which
are nice but
theoretical uh into
actual wet water for the
city. The city
has been in the process
of doing this. But
one of the kind of remaining
areas that they haven't
yet started yet
is building hard infrastructure
to allow the city to access
a well field um that
they have rights to near
tatum. So
these wells look to be quite
productive.
Um And
they're going through the process of kind of
proving that out right now,
but they will need to
put in 20 plus miles
of waterline to actually
bring that water to the
city.
Uh And you can see in the last
bullet under Carlsbad
um that they also have some
significant and immediate
needs to expand their sewer
system to support
growth to the south of the
city. Uh And several
of those projects are
underway.
So and lastly, uh
I'm gonna provide some highlights
on the village of Loving
last month, you asked
us to make sure that we are highlighting
small communities in
the areas that you visit this
this interim.
Um In addition to some
of the larger ones,
uh so, Loving is one of
those. Um it
is a village
about 12 miles from
here of about 1400
people similar.
Well, you can
see in the second bullet here that Loving
has seen quite
significant revenue
increases recently.
So going from about
$2.4 million in Fy
21 to over
$11 million
in Fy 23
uh somewhat similar to
Carlsbad. They have
used some of those
increases to invest in
quality of life projects
and they continue to look to
state and federal grant programs
to support um
kind of their basic infrastructure
needs. Although they have
had a much
uh better ability
to bring state
match to those program, sorry,
local match to those programs
and also to use that revenue to
fill funding gaps for
projects.
Another thing that the village has
done with this increase in revenue
is focus on uh
investing in their staff
and um public
and in improving public
services. So
just a couple of examples of
this, they told
us they're now covering
100% of
um health insurance
benefits for their
employees and 80%
for dependents.
Um and they've also
uh actually closed their
volunteer fire department and
worked with the county
for the county to provide
uh professional emergency
services to the village at
a cost of about
$300,000
to the village each
year.
Um They are also have
been working for many years to
kind of incrementally improve
basic infrastructure including
water and sewer and
Antonio will tell you a little bit
more about that.
Um Some of the
ongoing needs they have
that are things that we see in a lot
of communities in rural New
Mexico. Um
is just the need
for
some both
replacement of aging
infrastructure and
the addition of some basic
features of that infrastructure
that allow services
to be provided in a more
consistent manner. So an
example of this in Loving is
that they need to install
valves throughout their water
system. So that when
there are things like line breaks
that they have to fix, they
don't have to shut off water to the
entire village, which is
what they do. Now,
they told us that they've had about
three of these incidents so
far this year
where water service
to the whole, the whole
community gets shut off while they're
making repairs
and while there may be some
valves in the system, now,
their locations aren't known.
So this is one
of the kind of basic infrastructure
for basic services,
things that they're looking to do
in the future.
Um And
um you know, I
think one thing that we saw
obvious in this
community too
was
um that they really went
to a bunch of different funding sources
to back to patch
together enough money to
get these things done, including
their own revenues. Uh
The Colonial Infrastructure
fund capital outlay.
Um and then federal sources
like the community development
community,
sorry. Um
Development block
grant C
DB G. Ok. Now I'll
turn it over to Antonio and he'll take
you through a couple of specific
projects.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Kelly.
And thank you Antonio. You can
proceed
>> madam, chair members of the
committee. Good morning.
Uh Let's jump into the first
project spotlight the
rehabilitation of the city
of Carlsbad historic Cameron
Theater.
The city acquired the cavern in
2014. And the five
phase renovation will have spanned
roughly a decade when
complete.
The theater sits in the heart of
downtown and has been largely
out of operation since the 19
eighties.
When reopened, the Caver Theater is
expected to serve as a live
performance venue, movie
theater and committee event
space. This
effort is part of Carlsbad's
broader strategy to diversify
its economy and enhance the quality
of life for its
residents.
In terms of financing, the total
project cost amounted to
8.7 million.
Just over half was funded through
local revenues and
3.9 million came from
the state grants.
This is one of the city's quality of
life projects that has continued
to benefit from lodgers tax.
As Kly mentioned, which was the
source of the local
funds,
the rehabilitation of the cavern
theater underscores the community's
strong attachment to this historic
site and the determination
to see it
restored
even so. They decided to piece
together funding over many years
due to its discretionary
nature,
the larger state recreation grant
ultimately provided the crucial
funds needed to complete the
project and the
theater is set to reopen by next
spring,
the city hopes this will be a
big step in revitalizing
downtown.
Now, let's move on to the
second project spotlight which
is the Carlsbad riverwalk
recreation
center.
In addition to the projects
on the riverwalk supported by
Lodgers tax, the city
is using state grants and city
general funds to improve its
riverwalk recreation center
to make it more hospitable during
hot summer months,
originally a power station
and later the boys and girls club,
the building was converted to a
community recreation center in
the 19 nineties and
is free to use.
Construction is underway to replace
the aging HVAC and electrical
systems and exterior doors
at the River rock recreation
center. The old age
vac excuse me,
the old HVAC system
will support year-round use
of the recreation center and enhance
the facility's ability to host
events and
programs.
The improvements are funded by the
city General fund's capital
outlay. Local project
cost overrun assistance through
DF and DF
regional recreation and quality
of life grant.
What we saw in our research in
Carlsbad overall was that
state grants combined with local
revenues have enabled the city to
undertake multiple projects
simultaneously to
enhance the overall quality of
life.
Now, finally, we'll move on to
our last project spotlight
which is the sewer system
improvements in the village of
Loving.
Loving has been making
incremental upgrades to its
water and sewer infrastructure
to improve services and accommodate
for growth. Though
the village continues to tap grant
programs for essential infrastructure.
It is used an increase in gross
receipts tax uh
for local match and
to fill funding
gaps.
Currently, Loving plans to
use $200,000
remaining from a 2019
capital outlay appropriation
for wastewater improvements for
a 750 ft
sewer line extension.
This extension could piggyback on
a road project under construction
with colonial infrastructure
funds.
The 2019 capital
appropriation of
$542,000
was reauthorized in 2023
and originally supported the construction
of a sewer lagoon.
The proposed sewer extension could
support the construction of 20
new homes serve
development on existing town
lots and convert septic
tanks on a public
sewer.
The incremental upgrades and current
projects aim to enhance
Loving's water and sewer
infrastructure. Extending
the sewer line will not only support
new housing developments but also
improve sanitation by converting
septic systems to public sewer
systems. These
improvements are needed to accommodate
future growth and improve
essential services to
residents.
The village is seeking a quote from the
road contractor to include the
slurry line through a change
order and this will
this approach will acquire approval
from the new Mexico Environment
Department.
Additionally, the village is procuring
engineering services for further
sewer expansion to connect
residents on septic
tanks.
The project is supported by a
$750,000
community development block
grant and an estimated
$400,000 in local
match. Though exact project
costs are unknown.
Loving's approach to infrastructure
improvement illustrates how
communities incrementally enhance
essential services over time
by piecing together funding
sources. This
ongoing effort is supported by
village staff with long tenure
and significant assistance from
the council of government
organization according to
the village.
Now I'll turn it back to Kelly for
some ending
remarks.
>> Um Thanks Antonio.
So uh just
one kind of final point I want to add
to on Loving is
that normally with this
kind of project, if we're looking
at it, kind of at this midst
stage, costs aren't
known. We don't
know when it's gonna be completed.
We would sort of consider those
things to create a relatively
high level of risk that the
project might not be
completed or would take a long
time. Um In
this case, I would
say that is
significantly mitigated
just by the magnitude of
the revenue increase the village has
seen recently where they're
probably going to be able to fill
whatever the gap is
and get this done relatively
efficiently. Um But
that same thing might not be true
for other communities
that haven't seen this kind of
local local revenue
bump. Um And
then lastly, I wanted to say that
um folks from the city of Carlsbad
will be here for the quality
of life panel this
afternoon. Um So
you can ask them questions
then about these
projects and the city's
investments and
um kind of
those amenities for the community
as well as basic infrastructure
if you would like. Um
and we invited the Village
of Loving, but I don't think they're here
so we can answer questions
the best we can if you have
them.
>> Brown.
Thank you Mr Chairman and
thank you for all the um very
good information. So,
um this is
all of these projects
mentioned are in my district. And I just
want to point out that regarding the
village of Loving,
we've always had a heart for Loving
because it's a small
community,
very cohesive,
but just didn't have a lot of tax
base. And so Mr
Chairman um there,
there is now, I guess a
gas station
that and plans for
another one coming
in and that's truly the boost
that that's happening here.
So um one of the problems
I I had with Loving through the
years, I'm in my 14th year
now in, in
um uh
in office and
one of the problems was villa. Uh
the village uh people
would ask for more
money than we even had in Cap
Belley to give.
So they might ask for 2 million
$3 million. And it was
almost impossible.
So I kept getting the message through
Mr Chairman that ask for
smaller projects that I
realistically can
fund, took a couple of
years. But I think they're,
they, they've got the point
now um
on the Cavern Theater
in Carlsbad, um just
so, you know, um this
is part of revitalization
of downtown.
Uh right next door is the
jail, the county
jail and uh
the county commission is looking
at uh
abandoning that, probably
raising it and making a parking
garage so that it can accommodate
uh people who will be using the
cavern theater and
other facilities down there.
Uh So that has
yet to be, I think the commission
is close enough to saying that's
what's gonna happen. So that
will be another improvement.
And it is a really,
really neat little theater
and maybe sometime in the
future when we
meet here in Carl's Bed, we'll get a
chance to see all the good work
that's been done there.
Um on
the riverwalk Recreation
Center, Mr Chair. This is
um this
is down near that playground
that I think you might have seen when we came
in on the bus. It's a wooden playground
with metal turrets. And
that was a community built project
some years ago that
really um activated
our community. We had people of
all ages
and it's just right out here.
So all of this
district here along the
river is um
is being very
well developed
and um was a
floodplain issue to some
extent. But I think they found a
way around that, so
proud of that
happening as well.
And just by way
of confession, Mr Chairman,
um the Lodgers tax
change occurred
due to some legislation
that I carried and that was
uh adopted.
Um So
when you go to Santa Fe as a
legislator and
you rent a
hotel room or whatever you're paying
lodgers tax, but there's an
exempt. There was
until my legislation passed,
there was an exemption
if you rented, say a hotel
for more than 30 days.
Um You, the tax,
that part of the lodgers tax
was waived.
But at the
time, we thought this is
a by changing the Lodgers
tax. That's where that new revenue
came from is because of that
legislation. And
I apologize to you because
those of you who stay in
Santa Fe for more than
30 days are now losing about
$700
per legislator. And what would have
been waived in terms of depending
on where you stay. So I
apologize for that, but I
think we did a lot of good
for a lot of communities, not just
Carl's bed. So
thank you Mr Chair,
Representative
>> Ferrer.
Thank you Mr
Chair.
I can
talk.
Hello,
thank you Mr Chair and
thank you for that report. I
I find this kind
of remarkable and
I'm very curious is, is,
can you tell me what is
the uh annual
revenue stream for
Lovington? And I
know they have a population, I think
of about 1400.
And are they an incorporated
city
>> Representative
Pereira Mr Chair?
So just to clarify, it's Loving,
not Lovington,
excuse me.
And the
revenue is mostly G RT
as I understand it. And I believe
they're incorporated
Representative Brown. Is that
correct? I'm not
positive.
>> I believe it is. It's,
it's considered a village
by
population.
>> Yeah, I think so. And they do
have a small like eight
person professional village
staff and so I assume
they're incorporated. >> Yeah.
Uh thank you Mr Chair. So
they have a uh a
small staff of eight
is what you're
saying.
>> I believe so. Yes, right
around there if that's not the exact
number. >> Uh,
thank you. And I,
I also,
you know, it would be
helpful.
I know you're doing this on a
fiveyear basis. It
would be really helpful to look at
this, uh, see the
breakdown year by
year if, if we could see
that too. I don't know if that's too
much trouble or too difficult to
do. But, um,
do you do these, uh,
for other cities too
or is this just something we're
doing you're doing for the LFC
when we go into a local
community?
>> Um Mister Chair representative.
Yes, we're doing them now
kind of tied to the interim
meeting locations.
>> Ok. Thank you. That's all I
have. And uh, congratulations,
uh, representative for,
um, for really a
pretty impressive
growth and it's
really hard in
small rural communities
to, to do that. I
mean, you know, you have a city of
31,000
is that you have a lot more to
work with, but it's a small
villages in rural
communities that are really
hard to stimulate any
kind of economic development
So it's,
it's a learning
lesson for me. I appreciate it. I
appreciate the information. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator
Griggs.
>> Thank you Mr Chair.
Um Thank you guys
for that and, and I want just everybody
here, uh,
to understand too when a
community fills out an IC
IP form, the
C IP form
actually identifies.
Are you gonna use
federal money or could you
use federal money for that project?
Could you use state money?
Could you use local money? So
it sets it up that way.
So you, so you
know how you're
going to, to go about
that? And in
most cases, I, I
would say actually
the top five
IC IP projects
in a community are
not normally the
top capital
outlay projects
that you get a, a request
for and it's usually
because they're too
expensive
if you've got the, if you look
at some of the stuff you saw,
which is Eddie County was
looking at the spending
$40 million
for the bypass that's not
fundable by capital
outlay except
incrementally
annually and annually. And that's,
that's kind of the way
it's been gone
after is a certain
amount every year and that you
spended it to
do it
a little bit at a time.
But I believe,
and, and Representative Brown
can straighten me out, but I
believe now that is pretty
close to being fully
funded to be completed
if it's not.
So
a
lot of, a lot
of good things going on
here
in trying to develop
the funding sources to get
stuff completed. And,
and you see that
uh the Lodgers
tax that
the representative uh
introduced and passed
has been very useful
here. Uh
Most
communities
don't have that opportunity
because they don't have a lot of people that
stay
past that 30 day
time period, which
allows the money to
be utilized for
quality of life projects
because Rogers tax
in its normal condition,
doesn't, doesn't do
that. Uh
So it's at
30 after 30 days
that, that really generates
the revenue for,
for the community
uh to do
things that they
choose. And I think it's,
I think that's really
positive
because you know,
these communities
absent the the big
oil boom,
the opportunities to
develop
and have the
revenue stream
to take care of projects
that really are important,
quality of life wise
are, are difficult to
identify and difficult to
fund.
So, I mean,
Carlsbad is really,
you know, really done some good things
because of that and,
and Kathryn
deserves all the, all
the kudos for it.
Um One
of the things that she mentioned,
she mentioned the jail and
the
courthouse, which is right
there, the judicial judicial
complex. And one of
the things that has happened
the last couple of years
is
there's been a
dollar amount in
the budget for
judicial complex
funding. Now,
it's important, I believe
for everyone who
continues on
is to pay attention to
that and keep,
keep money going into
that fund because there's
numerous judicial
complexes
needed statewide.
And that money is
the most it can do is a
5050 match
to the local community
to uh to
help get that
judicial complex
built. Uh
but it's um
it's all over
New Mexico that
those needs are
becoming more and
more apparent
to communities. So I
think as you look at the budgets
again,
please pay attention
to, to that and try
to keep that funded.
I, you know, the levels been 20
million the last 22
years. It
probably is a bigger number
needed to, to get
that done uh as
we go forward.
But uh yeah, I'm,
I'm proud to represent
part of Carlsbad and,
and some of this stuff has
been, I've been able to
participate in and I, I
want to mention one thing
that you guys talk
about the schools,
Senator Lavell and
I funded
the new uh
hardwood floor
in Carlsbad
High school. And all
we wanted for that doing
that was to get the
superintendent to
put an Alamogordo
tiger decal on
the corner and a Hobbs
Eagle decal on the
other corner and dog
on it. They wouldn't do
it.
So, thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Is that why you didn't seek
reelection?
Representative Garrett
quickly, >> thank
you, Mr Jarrett. Quick
question, Kelly on
the table one,
the money that's already
been allocated.
The one thing that I don't
see is the amount
unfunded.
Are, are these projects
totally funded? And
that's what hasn't been spent
or do they actually
need more
money?
>> Um Mister Chair
Representative Garrett, that's a great
question that it is very
difficult for us to know the
answer to at this
moment.
Um So in,
in developing a
new tracking and reporting
system for funded capital outlay
projects, we're trying to
get a mechanism in there that
allows us to
know. Um
But the main
way to know right now is
is either by asking or
looking at the IC IP
and hoping it's up to
date on that front.
Uh And the IC IP doesn't
link well to the funded
projects at this
moment. So, um
but you're on the
right track that it's a very important
thing for us to know to be
able to get these things
done. Thank
>> you.
>> Thank you. I think we're
adjourned for lunch.
Let's
uh we charge by the second
from here on
out.
We, we build by the >> middle
of >> the second though >> just
two tidbits, Mr Chair for
those of us who have small
villages or whatever uh
small uh local
governments in our districts.
Um What I did with to
grow money this year
is devote
$380,000 of
that for capacity
building through the Southeast New
Mexico Council of Governments.
So they can hire grant
writers to help these little
guys uh try to
get some more funding. And then
finally, for those of you who are not
familiar, uh just before
Valentine's Day, every year, the
village of Loving has a lot
of postal activity
because people from all
over the country send
their Valentine's cards to
Loving to get the postmark
on it. And then the
village is the postmaster.
There is kind enough to make sure it
gets back to the person that
it gets where it needs to go. So,
just to let you know that, thank
you.
>> No wonder the mail so
expensive.
I think we're adjourned,
adjourned. Let's, uh, let's
shoot for 1 1545
minutes enough. Yeah.
