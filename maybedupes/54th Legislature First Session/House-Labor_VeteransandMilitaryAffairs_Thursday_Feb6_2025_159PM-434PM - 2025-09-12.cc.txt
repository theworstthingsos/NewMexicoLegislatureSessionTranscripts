Thank you for joining us,
joining us, Cabinet secretary,
you may proceed. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and the
committee members, thank you
for, uh, allowing us to come in
and give you uh uh a state of
the state of our veteran
services. I worked with uh many
of you, uh, throughout the last
year and a half since I've been
in the, in this, in this role as
well as uh before that uh
serving in the military.
Um, in front of you there's a
presentation, um, I, I won't
because of a timeliness. I won't
read through everything, but
again, uh, I wanna remind
everybody as we do have some new
members that I've, I've not
worked with yet. The mission of
our Department of Veteran
Services, that's to build
healthier communities,
connecting all veterans and
their families to the highest
quality care.
Services and eligible benefits
through advocacy and
collaboration.
I, I believe that is a a
hallmark of this position.
I work for our veterans.
To ensure that they and their
families and all who are
entitled to these benefits are,
are allowed to to attain them
should they, should they want
them.
I believe that's an important
aspect and the synchronization
piece that you
Did in my introduction, I, I
believe is, is really the
calling for this position in our
agency because we have the
federal benefits through the
Department of Veteran Affairs,
making sure that we're a liaison
between our state veterans and
their benefits within our state
and to attaining those federal
benefits to ensure that our
veterans get everything that
they've earned through their
service.
On page 3
Uh, of, of this brief.
There's a, a synopsis of what we
provide and I'll hit a few high
points here.
Our administrative services
obviously by the letter of the
law.
Um, I have my.
My, uh, chief financial officer
here next to me, Mrs. Danell
Lucero. She makes sure that, uh,
I stay out of jail and uh making
sure that we meet all these
states intents and a statute as
has been written by our our
legislature.
The contracting services is
critical because I am not a
service provider at the
Department of Veteran Services.
We liaison to to find the
service providers throughout the
state to provide those services
to our veterans. And I believe
that's an integral part of of
the collaboration that we do
throughout the state.
Our field services, uh, many of
you are aware that we have
certified veteran service
officers.
Currently, there's 33 throughout
the state of New Mexico, um.
And thank you for the plus up
last year that we received an
additional 5 positions on our
full-time manning to accomplish
this. We're still short of where
we need to be, but um we're
continuing to grow and, and uh
apply those services. Our health
care coordination works with
social services.
Connecting veterans with, with
issues over and above state and
federal benefits that they might
have living issues to assist
them with social services and
connections back to uh
Uh, living facilities as well as
community.
Um
Services that they might need to
and, and improve their quality
of life.
State approving agency.
Is
Um, integral part that we have a
through federal funds that
oversees all the higher
education and uh post-secondary
institutions for
Our apprenticeships as well as
uh the GI Bill implementation to
ensure that all of the hired
higher education facilities are
applying the veteran benefits as
their intended by the VA and
making sure our veterans get
their full payments.
Our veterans Business outreach.
Is uh an ability for us to teach
skill sets to veterans who are
willing and wanting to start
their own small businesses, and
we teach them through a
week-long
Uh, presentation, um, in boots
to business and um.
veteran business rebooted.
We'll do this in either a day
transition service on our active
duty basis or through a couple
of days with our National Guard
and reservists to ensure they
have the tools.
Available to start um the.
The task of starting their own
small businesses, we also link
them with the Small Business
Administration.
To ensure that they have the
tools available to them.
Our tribal liaison.
I specifically that we have uh
One individual who basically
provides our tribal and our uh
reservation liaisons to ensure
that
All of our tribal leaders
understand the benefits
available to them.
For the, the, the veterans in
their care through their
pueblos, uh, tribes and nations.
As well as ensuring that um any
injustices that are happening.
For our veterans that were able
to bring those to the state and,
and apply some of those
benefits.
As well as liaison between.
The tribes and the federal
government for the federal to
federal engagements.
And our women's veterans
coordinator is specialized in
ensuring that our women veterans
have a voice and making sure
that as the VA continues to
improve their, their level of
care for our women veterans and
their specialty care, that that
person is there to
To uh
Be a synchronizing effort
between the VA, our women's
veterans, and ensuring that if
there's a need that's not being
filled that we, uh, advocate on
their behalf to ensure that that
our women veterans.
Understand what's available to
them and.
Most importantly, that they come
forward.
We've had a great, uh,
Opportunities to engage with a
lot of our women veterans for
the first time we're, we've been
very successful in getting many
women better to actually start
identifying as such because
that's been an issue that a lot
of women veterans just say, oh I
just served in, in the army for
2 years, where I just, it's like
there's no just if you served
your veteran and getting them to
understand that they have,
they're eligible for those
benefits, as well as some of the
specialty challenges that they
face, such as childcare.
And uh
Some of the other issues as a as
a uh
A a parent and and mother that
sometimes we overlook. We deal
directly with the governor's
office on constituent referrals,
um.
There's a lot of of referrals
that come through directly to
the governor's, uh, constituent
lines and we do direct outreach
to those individuals for that as
well as many of you I think have
called me directly to ensure
that I have a veteran in my, in,
in my constituency that has a
problem and we'll get that uh
addressed immediately. I think
that's really what, what
veterans want is when they get a
phone call to get a warm body.
Somebody answered the phone, be
heard, and at least be given
direction on on the way to go,
and I think
We've vastly improved our
customer service in that area
over the last year and a half.
We certainly uh do the outreach
and if uh
We're unable to solve the
problem ourselves again, that
liaison and the, and the
referral process that we do, we
get them to the right people to
get the resources on time that
that these veterans need.
It's not a foolproof solution
cause there are some very um
Uh, wicked problems that our
veterans um come across, but we
will certainly not stop until
we, we, we get them referred to
the proper authorities.
If you go to page 5,
Our veteran service offices, you
can see that um the locations
where we have veteran service
offices.
And the officers that are that
are placed there.
Uh, the, the chart on your left
is probably an easier uh
depiction to, to look at there.
And where you see the number
that's vacancies, many of those
are already in.
In uh interview process right
now.
And we are, are, um.
Have we'll have those filled
within the next 30 to 45 days.
And that's imperative,
especially for the mobile unit.
Personnel to get them on board
and get them.
Veteran Service officer training
that is required, so we can uh
move that forward.
If you go to page 6.
This is a compilation of the
number of interactions.
That we have had over the last
two quarters with our veterans.
Over emails, claims filed, phone
calls, appeals, addressed.
As well as uh survivor benefits
and that is one area that we've
seen a huge increase as we
continue to communicate and
educate our veteran community is
our, their survivors that we're
able to assist, uh many of our
survivors.
To work through the issues after
a veteran has passed to ensure
that their benefits are
transferred over where they're
authorized, and that they uh
also get the, the benefits
through the federal side as well
for their veteran uh disability
and those uh.
Compensation claims.
You can see the, we counties is
interactions. So these numbers
are, are, are quite large if
you, if you look at them um
across the Northwest region
alone.
You know, you see a 1,0006
interactions and by a single
person.
In, in, in a, in a region at
times because every phone call,
email, follow-up call is an
interaction and, and, and those
could take as little as 5
minutes. It could be as many as
2 hours per veteran.
So the the amount of time that
our veteran service officers
spend with, with, uh, veterans
is.
Uh, pertinent to the issue, not
to the, the time clock.
On page 7.
Last year we uh lobbied and were
successful in in attaining
$600,000 from the legislature
for a mobile unit.
With the intent of making sure
that we take services to where
the veterans are.
And I believe that this
This is really going to and uh
enhance our ability to get out
to some of these areas,
especially in some of the tribal
areas and the most rural areas
of New Mexico.
Uh, these are some very rough
areas to to get to. And this
unit, and these two pictures are
actually our unit in
construction right now.
With the, the lift being applied
um on page, on page 7.
And I I really believe that this
is gonna be
A huge boon for us. It'll have 2
VSOs in it and the ability for a
veteran to sit in there and
actually get some claims done,
it'll have a satellite uplink,
so we'll have on the spot
internet so we can actually uh
conduct these services as long
as we're able to uh gather a
signal.
So, um, I, I think this is gonna
be a game changer for us to get
to some of those veterans that
aren't able to get to us from
some of the most rural areas.
In state benefits.
I'll highlight our tax
exemptions.
That's obviously a uh hot button
issues during this legislative
session as our voters in the
general election in November.
Um, overwhelmingly voted for our
two constitutional amendments to
raise the veteran tax exemption
from 4000 to 10,000.
And also to apply the uh
percentage of disability, um,
commensurate to their their
award letters to their
properties and um.
That bill House Bill 47 right
now is going back into the tax
and rev Committee tomorrow, and
we anticipate that that should
be moved forward and onto the,
the floors with an emergency
clause to get that instituted so
that the assessors may actually
move that forward.
Um, by the first of March for
their notice of values to go
out.
Encumbering that that new um tax
exemption.
For the 400 to $10,000 and then
in FY 26 implementing the
percentage of disability.
That will.
Certainly increase our workload
in the Department of Veteran
Services. We are the
adjudication arm on behalf of
the state to ensure that
everybody has the proper
paperwork to claim that.
Veteran exemption. So all
veterans who are going to be
claiming that uh disability
exemption other than 100% will
have to present their
certificates and we'll then work
with the assessors.
Our honor guard program those of
you that are not aware, we have
29 honor guard teams throughout
the state of New Mexico.
We have 40 registered.
And uh we're continuing to try
to grow those those programs and
working with the American
Legion, the VFW's, uh, core of,
uh.
Our uh Marine Corps League.
Throughout the state to ensure
that we have the capacity to
continue to provide the, the,
the last honors is is.
We should for our veterans.
Uh, the military is pulling back
their support of these programs
with their military funding so
we might find ourselves in the
next 1.5 to 2 years, um, trying
to increase his capacity between
uh the, the military and and our
veteran service organizations to
ensure that every veteran
Has that available to them.
Because um our veterans service
organizations are struggling
with recruiting right now as
well to ensure that they have
the longevity.
Uh, for the out years to
continue this program.
We currently last year we spent
$186,000 supporting this
program. We pay for their
services and some stipends for
uniforms.
And up to this point this year
we've already spent $1,012,000.
So it's a, it's a very important
program for us to continue.
Um, pushing forward.
The state benefits they've
already talked about the honor
guard program and the
amendments.
Um, an update for, for the
Carlsbad Cemetery. This request
has been in, in process for many
years and and uh.
The Veterans Affairs.
Right now is not funding new
construction in, in, in, in most
areas, they're looking at
enhancements and expansions as a
priority right now and with the
changeover of the
Of the executive branch and the
new secretaries were waiting on
on the guidance and the
direction they may go this year.
We were anticipating funding in
26 or 27 for the Carlsbad 7.
On slide 11, I just want to draw
attention to that. Uh this is uh
a, a new ad. Taos was funded by
the state of New Mexico.
And uh the uh
And the county has worked very
closely.
And um
They did a ribbon cutting in
September, it was, uh, November,
I think it was for Veterans Day
that we did the ribbon cutting.
And um they don't anticipate
having the funds to maintain
this, this cemetery for more
than another year and a half.
And the the governor obviously
does not want to see the, the
state capital or this capability
go away and she's asked me to,
to, uh,
Take this cemetery over, hence
the $1 million ask.
For this to be stood up
completely, and that's maybe uh
an overestimation of, of the
resources that are gonna be
required because under the state
capital that was, that was
already encumbered, some of the
equipment that weaving uh
encompassed in this $1 million
budget.
Um, may not need to be spent
again. So we could probably pull
this down to about 700,000
because of some of the uh
Of the equipment. And this is to
re-establish it and hire the
full-time employee employees.
As well as get the operations
costs and all the contracts in
place that will be required for,
for long term. After that, the
operations costs for most of our
cemeteries run run about 400 to
$500,000 depending on, on the
requirements.
So that would be a long term ask
uh to be added in.
Uh, under health care
coordination?
This is our veteran homelessness
and our suicide prevention.
Last year we were uh empowered
with a suicide prevention Act by
this same committee, um,
representative Alcorn and many
representatives put that forward
and we have done an excellent
job of actually, we've
encumbered $209,000 to this
point in contracts for services
throughout the state of New
Mexico.
Uh, to ensure that that we have
suicide prevention.
Activities available throughout
the state. Um, we have
We have 8 different vendors
throughout the state of New
Mexico currently that are
providing services.
And we're uh trying to, we are
in the process of bringing
online a veterans talking to
veterans.
Uh, capability where we're
actually gonna have uh veteran
groups in
The outlying areas of, of New
Mexico actually have more of a
support group, uh, facilitation
of discussion as somewhat of a
mitigation instead of relying on
behavioral health professionals
to, to do some of this stuff.
We're trying to uh mitigate the
risk before it gets to uh an
emergent opportunity for our
veterans.
A rural highly rural
transportation program on page
13.
That is a federally funded grant
that we were successful in
almost doubling this year to
Uh, over $400,000. And this is
funded by the VA and their
definition of highly rural is
More than 7 veterans within a
square mile, and, you know, in
New Mexico, we know that that
that is not equivalent of what
we consider to be a rural area
we're working at the national
level to adjust that definition,
but
As such, we're still operating
within that definition to
execute these and these are the
areas um that are identified on
this map and you can see that
some of the tribal areas have
been included there with Okema,
Alamo, Laguna, Rama, and uh, and
Zuni.
And we've been very successful
in executing this program up to
this point.
The next page is the
Transportation program funded by
the state for the first time
last year of $175,000.
And we've done an excellent job
of getting additional vendors in
these additional 18 counties.
To provide transportation for
our veterans.
Um, the problem we're running
into is not enough vendors.
To continue operating this and
we're probably gonna end up at
this juncture because of the
demand going to an invitation to
bid so we can exceed the $60,000
per vendor limitation that the
state currently places on us,
uh, and go to a more of a
competition bid, so we can make
sure that we maximize the
vendors that are able to support
the capacity that we're seeing.
You go to page 15.
Those are the number of rides
and the miles driven up to this
point this year.
733 rides have been provided to
veterans.
Uh, up till, uh, the end of
December.
170,642 miles driven.
Over 25 counties served.
And in excess of $300,000
expended in providing rides, and
these are doorstep to doorstep
rides for our veterans to their
medical appointments that
they're able to utilize for
For the their VA services.
Page 16 is uh the feasibility
study, or ICIP requests.
This year we uh were given $1.2
million by the legislature to
initiate our feasibility study
for a 25,000 square foot service
center for veterans in, in the
city of Albuquerque off of
Gibson Boulevard.
Um, to ensure that, um, if that
study comes back in a, in a
positive nature that we're able
to start construction in the
next uh fiscal year or two in 26
or 27, and that's currently
estimated at a $15 million price
tag and obviously the more we
wait, probably the more the cost
will go up.
But the 1.2 is now encumbered
and we are uh doing a
feasibility study this FY with
that $1.2 million.
The 2nd priority we have this
year is.
The mitigation uh for Gallup and
Angel Fire.
Um, GSD identified last year
that there was many issues with
warranty work by the contractor
who had built the Gallup in the
Angel Fire Cemeteries.
A lot of the uh
Coaction was not done to the
standard.
Um, so we're having problems
with concrete and some of the
columbariums, uh, settling, so
we're not in dire.
Emergent need right now, but we.
Needed to engage the work this
year, so the money we were given
for improvements for this FY
we've transferred to GSD to get
those contracts for mitigation
in place.
So we're asking for the
replacement of that $4.1 million
that we fronted this year to get
those contracts in place for
next year before we can continue
our safety and security of our,
of our cemeteries, um, and our,
and the memorials that we have
throughout the state.
So, um, you know, in a, in a
nutshell, that is uh some of the
services I did not encompass
everything, but I stand for
questions.
Excuse me
we're gonna go ahead and move on
with the next or both of the
presentations, um, however, I'm
going to that you have some
time, both of you, correct? Yes.
158 and I just uh, is in another
committee, however, I wanted to
do the presentations.
Have her come because it's
applicable to one of the uh the
military presentation and then
have her come up, um, after we
do the military and then.
Representative Sareana, the
bills follow, and then we'll
open up, we'll, we'll.
hear the bill?
Is that still in accordance
with.
That's fine. So we will proceed.
Speaker, OK.
So next, as he proceeds forward,
we have Major General Miguel
Aguilar.
Uh, who started his military
career at the New Mexico,
Mexico.
Major General Aguilar was
commissioned and then came a
platoon leader for a battery.
Well, 1 200 air defense
artillery.
Holding numerous positions
within.
The um
1 200th Air Defense artillery in
2005, Major General training
team, 255.
205th Regional Core Advisory
Group, sorry.
Um, to Kandahar, Afghanistan in
January 2011.
Major General Aguilar became the
commander for the.
1 200th inventory battalion and
deployed the battalion to Sinai,
Egypt in support of Task Force
Sinai multinational force.
An observer's mission.
In August 2018, he was promoted
to Brigadier General and became
the deputy adjutant general for
the New Mexico National Guard
and was assigned as a dual.
Deputy commanding general for
the first Army Division West.
In early 2022, he was selected
as the adjutant general of the
New Welcome and you may proceed.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, thank you very much
for, uh, for taking the time to
Talk about the Department of
Military Affairs, um, I've got,
I've got a slide presentation
for you. I think you both have
it. Uh, you also have, uh, what
we call our annual report, which
digs a little deeper into the
organization that you can look
at, um, if, uh if you're
interested later, uh, don't have
a lot of slides. I will tell you
that my staff started with like
53.
And I got it down to about 4.
So um I think we'll be in really
good shape. So I'll give a very
broad overview of the garden,
what we do and then I'll talk a
little bit about um some of the
initiatives, especially those
things that are relevant to you
as legislators and the citizens
of New Mexico.
So if uh if you're following
along on the presentation, yes,
the PowerPoint one, if you go to
page number 2.
Um, this really demonstrates for
you, um, when I took over as the
adjutant general, I wanted to
sit down and we've been doing
some strategic planning for a
while.
But I took the team and I sat
him down and we talked about do
I need to get back a little bit?
I'm a little loud.
Um, I, I talked to the team
about
Let's sit for, for a couple of
days we went off to Rido so for
uh for a little bit, and we
said, who are we as an
organization?
What's our purpose?
And what should we look like?
And if we don't look like that,
What do we need to do to get
there?
From that came the foundation of
of this slide that you see here,
which is talks about our
mission.
Uh, our state, federal, and and
community.
Um, and the things that we're
trying to accomplish.
Um, there's a little circle
around it that, that, uh, talks
about culture.
And, and what we mean by that is
really the the organization's
culture.
Um, and how we take care of
people and how we create an
environment.
That causes soldiers and airmen.
Who want to be a part of this
organization.
Uh, to create the effect that I
think um
Hopes, New Mexico, which is, we
build teammates, we build
leaders.
Um
We think that the more New
Mexicans that are guardsmen and
spend a significant number of
years in the organization.
Um
They make the state better.
At, at every level and so, um, I
often tell people when, when uh,
when they look at me, there's
nothing special about me. I'm a
kid from Dexter, New Mexico.
Uh, who went to Nemi and joined
the guard. What you see in front
of you is the product of an
organization and what it
creates.
Um, and it creates one of me
every 4 or 5 years, and it
creates leaders all along. It's
a fantastic organization for the
state, uh, if you flip the page,
I'll talk a little bit about uh.
What, what you kind of recognize
as the guard that, you know, the
army and Air National Guard. I
oversee both.
Uh, we're, you know, the, the
army guys are affiliated with
the army. The Air Force guy the
uh Air guard is affiliated with
the Air Force, um, a little
under 3000 Army guard
authorizations as we sit today,
um,
We're, we're significantly less
than that. They're organized
into 3 brigade type uh elements,
um, and, uh, and we have
headquarters and armories all
across the state of New Mexico.
There was a time.
30-40 years ago.
Where we had armories all over
the state and I knew Southeast
New Mexico best because I grew
up in Chavez County, but you
went to Roswell, uh, you know,
down in Eddy County in Artesia,
Carlsbad, Hobbs, everywhere you
went there was an armory.
And the armory was the center of
the community.
Um, if you grew up in that age
and you went to see Elvis you
went to an armory.
Uh, if you want to see
professional wrestling, you went
to an armory.
Married quinceaneras, name it,
you were in an armory, um, and
that's, and that's changed over
the years and some of it is
because our communities have
changed.
Our, our youth population tends
to move to population centers,
and so, uh, we don't um recruit,
we recruit a lot of the same
communities.
They just tend to live in
Albuquerque in the more
populated areas. And so over the
years, we've had a condense the
number of armories we have
because they cost a lot of money
to sustain.
But the mission to the guard and
to the state continues to be the
same, which is we're ready and
prepared, uh, to help the state.
In any way that we need to.
The Air National Guard is about
1000.
Uh, it's gone through several
iterations over the years. At
one time they had a, uh, a
fighter wing. It was the basis
of, of how the Air National
Guard started in in uh.
In in early 2010s, 2011, we lost
our F-16s.
Uh, and we're without a flying
mission.
For quite a while and didn't
have an airplane that belonged
to the Air National Guard.
Until just a few months ago, uh,
where we received our first, uh,
our 3 HC 130J's, uh, that reside
at Kirtland Air Force Base, and
we now have New Mexicans flying.
Aircraft that belonged to New
Mexicans for the first time in
over 10 years.
Um
But there's other things that
they do that a lot of people
don't know about, including the
targeting uh intel squadron that
today has New Mexicans in in a
space at Kirtland Air Force Base
processing, targeting
information or uh for the
combatant commanders around the
world, including the Middle
East, uh, and so if you've heard
of a bomb dropped somewhere in
the Middle East.
There's a very high likelihood
that a New Mexican was involved
in the analysis that made that,
um, um.
Bomb drop exactly where it
needed to drop because they call
them smart bombs, but the
reality is that a human
has to go and look at a map and
look at the data and then plug
in information for those bombs
to do what they do, and you have
New Mexicans doing it.
Uh, it's, it's incredible you
can take an 18 year old kid.
send them to their basic course,
their advanced training within
18 months of them leaving high
school, they're sitting in a in
a secure space at Kirtland Air
Force Base.
Doing these this kind of work.
incredibly, incredibly proud,
and they're amazing, amazing
young airmen.
The other components of the of
the National Guard, you may have
heard of before the State
Defense Force, uh, which were
authorized to have volunteers
who are not in the military, but
still want to serve if if New
Mexico needs them, um, they fall
underneath our state defense
force. It's a, it's a little low
in, in, in, um, participation in
numbers today.
Um, but we have, I think, an
incredible opportunity.
Everyone talks about
cybersecurity.
Uh, and we don't know how to get
it done because it's incredibly
difficult to find people.
Who have the skills and
capabilities to do the things
that we need to, to protect our
critical infrastructure in New
Mexico.
And pay them enough money to
stay.
It's a it's a challenge for
everybody.
The state of Ohio underneath
their defense force.
As a volunteer cyber uh
cybersecurity force.
So that if you are paid very
well at Los Alamos Labs to do
this kind of work.
You can volunteer to do site
assessments and do response when
we need you to, uh, in order to
help.
Um, other, other businesses and
government um keep going in in
in the event of a cyberattack.
Uh, so we're, we're just in
those preliminary discussions of
of trying to influence the
building of that type of force,
but I think that may be a a a
big piece of the way forward.
And the last thing is we're
really almost just kind of a
fiduciary uh pass through with
the civil air patrol is under
the Departmental Affairs, uh, we
provide the, the funding for um
uh that you provide to us so
that they can continue to
operate.
Uh, if you flip over.
Um, to the next page, uh, is
part of our effort in the
community we have our youth
programs.
And they continue to grow
slightly. It seems like every
single year.
So you may be aware that uh that
we have a youth challenge
academy in Roswell that is now
working on its, uh, I believe
it's 26th year.
Uh, or it's 24th year.
They take what we would term as
at-risk youth kids who are,
aren't doing well in the current
like high school environment.
are in danger of dropping out or
have dropped out.
We put them through a 22 week
academy in Roswell.
We try to get him caught up in
in school and either they get a
GED equivalent. They do credit
recovery, uh, so they can go
back into high school.
It's, it's a little bit of a
military environment we teach
discipline, we teach life
skills.
And, and the truth is we're in
the business there are changing
lives. There are kids there who
go through an amazing
transformation over those 22
weeks, and either they join the
military,
Uh, some of them go to the
Mexican military and see. I'll
talk about that in a little bit,
um, or they, they will go into
our next program that is gonna
start in April called Job
Challenge.
Job challenge is another program
that'll go twenty-ish weeks.
Um, where we take kids who are
18 years old, able to go on an
apprenticeship.
Uh, who graduated from the Youth
Challenge program.
And we give them more specific,
um, you know, type training. So
if they want to be an
electrician or a carpenter.
We run them through a program
with either um either the union
or CNM with the hopes of
Doing additional training.
And then set them on their path
to their apprenticeships so they
can start their careers. I
believe it has the ability to
become a very, very productive,
successful program.
And it's on the grounds of Expo
New Mexico, um, in the middle of
Central, uh, in Albuquerque,
where we've put well over $7
million almost going to $8
million to renovate a piece of
the dormitories that you may
have known as the 4H
dormitories.
Uh, on the Expo New Mexico
ground, if you get a chance to
go back there, uh, and take a
look at it anytime now. You'd be
amazed at the transformation of
at least
Half of that space, uh, and
that's where we're going to
reside uh while they're in that
program.
Um
Take you to the bottom
right-hand corner. One of the
things I talked about is Mexico
Military Institute.
It changed my life.
I was just, I was just a young
kid from a farming community,
uh, who joined ROTC at NAMI
because they offered me some
money.
Uh, and I didn't have any.
And so that's how I got into
ROTC and that's how I ended up
in the guard. Didn't really know
what I was doing, uh, but they
did a pretty good job of setting
me on my path. It was, it was an
inflection point in my life that
has led to success.
Um, I want that same success for
New Mexicans. And so, as, as um
Our youth challenge kids are
going through that program. It's
an interesting thing that
happens. They hate being there
when they get there.
We take their phones from them.
We don't let them go anywhere.
They don't get to make phone
calls, but on the weekends, we
totally disconnect them from the
world that they were engaged in.
They ain't happy about it.
Right around week 14.
Things change.
And they start to wonder.
How they're, how leaving this
place is going to affect their
lives.
They start to become concerned
about going back into a
community or an environment that
was unhealthy for them.
That was causing him to make bad
choices.
And I had this idea, wouldn't it
be great if we could put them
somewhere.
If they wanted to, that they
could continue in this type of
environment and then I
remembered.
Right across town in the same
city as New Mexico Military
Institute and the legislature
has done an amazing job of
funding, uh, scholarships so
that New Mexico kids who want to
go there should pay nothing.
And so we started a, a
conversation with New Mexico
Military Institute about
Figuring out a pathway for those
kids that were interested to go
there.
Um, it has, it's been rocky.
Uh, some people didn't think it
was a great idea.
Some kids aren't prepared to go
into that academic environment.
But we are starting to build uh
that path. Right now we have
about 5 cadets there. We've been
as high as 17.
Um, some of them have, have gone
there, got their high school
diplomas, some have graduated
from the junior college.
Uh, some have been there for a
little while, decided it wasn't
for them, then joined the
military.
But it creates the space for
them.
To continue in an environment
that has been absolutely good
for them so that they have their
future.
Um
The new superintendent Mexico
Military Institute is is
Um
Prepare to take over the credit
recovery program that we
currently have with Harman High
School.
To bring those cadets closer.
Uh, to, to becoming.
Be prepared to go in there and,
and achieve academically.
They do great in the core.
He survived the the the rigors
of the military environment
without a problem. It's the
academics that they have a hard
time and then they lose, they
lose, um.
Uh, confidence and then they
eventually drop out or they fail
for grades.
Um, the other thing that we're
working with New Mexico Military
Institute is
Uh, the, the superintendent has
this idea about building
essentially charter schools
across the state.
So that kids who want to attend
the Mexican Military and student
high school.
Have, have a better opportunity
to get prepared for that
environment. Um.
We we believe that the first one
may be in Santa Fe and I've
offered the space center at, at
our National Guard armory here
in Santa Fe as the site for that
school because we think it'd be
a fantastic partnership.
Uh, and a great opportunity for
kids in Santa Fe, but we'd like
to what I think what he'd like
to see is.
Various places Roswell, Las
Cruces, population centers where
those kids from those
communities, if they want
another option.
For middle school, uh they can
take that and then if then be
competitive to attend New Mexico
Military Institute high school.
Um
The last thing on this on this
uh presentation uh or this page
is the governor's challenge
program.
So about this time last year,
uh, it was like a week, almost a
year, uh.
A year and like a week ago, uh,
I was in Washington DC with the
with the governor at the council
of governors, and she walked
past me and poked me and said,
I have this idea for you.
We're gonna do something with
youth.
Like that was it. About 3 or 4
weeks later, she called me into
the office and she said, hey,
Um
We are losing kids at the middle
school and high school level,
and they're ending up in high
school with guns.
Um, I want to do something about
it.
And I think the guard has a
place.
From the military uniform
commands a level of respect and
credibility with kids. I want to
use that.
As a catalyst for creating this
environment that mentors kids
and helps put them on the right
path.
I took that as uh a program that
would give kids, um, the tools
that they need to have the
resilience to grow up in an
environment that they've got to
grow up in today.
Uh, and so with very little
notice and no funding.
We went out, we found some
money, uh, we created a Jimmy
Carter Middle School in
Albuquerque, the first, uh,
governors Summer Challenge
program.
6 weeks in partnership with the
with the principal at Jimmy
Carter and some of her staff.
Um, with some of the literacy
money from the literacy program
at PED with some at-risk money
from CYFD. They were welcome
partners.
Um, we created this program that
was.
6 weeks, 6 hours a day, we
picked kids up in the bus that
registered, um, they got, they
did physical fitness.
Every single day
Um, we, uh, we did life skills
training like we do with Youth
Challenge. They did 3 hours of
literacy. We gave him breakfast,
we gave them lunch, we put them
on the bus at the end of the
day, send him home on every
Friday.
We made him do things that are
hard.
We told those kids, you need to
learn how to do hard things, how
to get out of your comfort zone,
so you build a confidence and
skill that you, that you need to
survive, uh, in today's world
and so we, we took him to a
rappel tower and they repelled.
We took them to a rock climbing
gym and they rock climbed. We
took them to a swimming pool and
we put them in and we taught
them combat water survival
skills.
Uh, we brought them out of their
comp uh out of their comfort
zone.
Um
And they did extremely well.
We didn't get the 50 kids that
we wanted, we got about 35, but
the important thing about it is.
They loved it
They grew
Their parents loved it.
The teachers loved it. Some of
them improved 2 or 3 grade
levels in reading over the
summer.
The principal today will tell
you that every one of those kids
is a better student.
Uh, is a better leader in the
community, um, including one who
I just found out about
yesterday.
Uh, who, who loves the military
uniform, uh, did, you know, just
embraced that kind of
environment.
She volunteered this fall to be
on the student leadership team.
She applied and got accepted
yesterday to attend New Mexico
Military Institute high school
the next year.
That program is changing lives.
We're asking for money.
Uh, because it
I can only do one kind of with
some magical money popping
around. We want to do 3 programs
this year to grow. We want to go
back to Jimmy Carter.
Uh, we want to do another one
in, in Albuquerque, and then we
want to figure out what rural
looks like.
Take a rural community and
multiple middle schools and
bring them into one space.
Uh, to, to provide the same
opportunities and then expand
for growth. So in this year's
budget, we've asked for um for
about $1.4 million to create the
staffing, uh, and the types of
things that we need, uh, to be
able to run that program because
one of the things that we
discovered is he he gave us some
money for the literacy people
and some of the staffing that we
use from CYFD uh at-risk money.
We had to use a temp agency.
Uh, and as you know, when you,
when you pay attention agency,
there's they're they're amazing,
it's great to have them, but
when you pay them $45.
They keep probably 15 and then
they pay the other person 30. I
thought if I get the money, I
can contract them individually,
and I'll just give that person
the $45 and we can start to
incentivize teachers to give up
their summer.
To be a part of it because it's
important to have uh the team
from the school that we're at.
Guardsmen and then others to do
the literacy program in, in, in
this last case last year, we
even used some of the summer
JROTC staff. It's amazing,
amazing program we hope we'll
continue to grow, um.
That, that's coming uh as
hopefully part of the budget for
this year.
I kind of look at somebody who
might be able to help me out.
Uh, if you turn the page,
Uh, I'll just talk briefly about
some of the initiatives that we
have going in the National Guard
and this one I think for this
committee you'll pay attention
to.
Tricare Insurance. So, uh, I
don't know if you know this or
not, but guardsmen do not get
free health care for the
military.
They get health care when
they're on duty.
So if somebody comes to Hondur
weekend, annual training or
they're deployed and something
happens to them, we take care of
their medical.
If they're not on duty, we don't
pay for anything.
So if you're training, doing
physical training.
Driving the day before drill to
to an armory, um, and something
happens to you.
And you don't have health care,
you're on your own.
Um
I don't think that's right.
Uh, I can't get DOD to pay for
all of it. Uh, and they won't
pay for any of it necessarily.
But we've had the opportunity
for many years. Um, I, I'm one
of them to purchase Tricare, so
I paid my premiums, and then I
get Tricare insurance. It's a
fantastic insurance. It's fairly
reasonable. So it's about half
the price.
Of what I would pay as a state
employee for uh, for healthcare
through the state.
Uh, so $53 for, for a single
member, $274 for a family, uh,
for a member's family in order
for DOD to pick up the rest of
it. And I was kind of curious,
what is, what is healthcare cost
like as a whole. I was just
Googling it and it's somewhere
between 8000 and 22,000 is what
an employer pays in their
portion to cover their employees
with health.
So I started trying to run the
bill to cover the premiums.
For our National Guardsmen.
Uh, we have a little over 400
guardsmen today.
Uh, that do not have health
care.
And so, um.
started talking to the
healthcare authority.
And, and they said, hey, you
know what? I think we can pay
for this.
There's plenty of money in the
fund.
And so, uh, I met with him this
morning for about, um, I think
it's gonna be 500 or $600,000
this year, they're gonna put it
into the budget, uh, request for
this year. They're gonna ask for
the money to cover at least the
guardsmen.
Who are, who currently don't
have health insurance.
And then there's a bill that's
about to drop. We're hoping to
get the governor's office to
approve it now. It's gonna amend
the healthcare, uh, authority
statute.
And they're gonna add a, a, a
line in there.
That says that they can cover
either
Partial or all of the premiums
for National Guardsmen who are
eligible for Tricare Select
Reserve.
Here's the other part on the
labor side.
Every employer who hires a
national guardsman.
We'll get a break.
A, a fairly significant break
and so they sacrifice as well
for the service of the guardsmen
when they, when they hire them
because they're gone. What an
amazing thing to tell them, Hey,
you don't have to worry about
health care for them.
And so we're uh we're danger
close to getting there if you
see that bill. I don't have a
bill number yet. We should have
it soon, um, yeah, I would
appreciate your support.
Um, we talked about our
governor's challenge already.
I'm gonna hit one more thing for
you that I think is incredibly
important.
Um, about 2 years ago.
Um, we, the Friday before the
session closed.
We got a bill passed.
That amended chapter 20 that
allowed the adjutant general to
hire National Guardsmen on state
active duty.
In order to support.
Mitigation and prevention in the
events of disasters, right? So
do the pre-work.
On the front end of it, uh, out
of the general fund.
I didn't get a lot of money,
about $600,000. It didn't let me
do a whole lot.
Um, but then these disasters
started happening.
And so we, we created a couple
of full-time positions and then
some temporary seasonal position
for guardsmen to come in
sometime in the spring and be
ready in the event of a
disaster.
Um, and so it was that we had 21
people on state active duty.
The day the fires broke out in
Riodoso.
And the the night that we found
out about those fires.
I sent all 20 of one of them to
Roswell.
Right away to start helping.
And so one of the things they
asked us to do in in I'm sorry,
Rio, so one of the things they
asked us to do in Ride, so it
was Swift Water Rescue. We're
not trained for swift water
rescue.
We have big trucks with big
tires.
And so we, we joined with
Swiftwater rescue teams from
around the country. They quickly
trained our guys and how to do
some swift water rescue stuff.
And that Saturday after the fire
started, the first flood hit.
In the guard, the National Guard
trucks that you saw going out
there were led by this team of
21 plus a bunch of others.
Uh, and we finished the Riodoso
fires, and we said, hey, you
know what, we ought to train
these guys on Swift Water
Rescue. I kept those 21 on
orders and we started looking at
how do we build more because
we'd gotten at least the
notification that FEMA was gonna
give me $6 million a year to
take some guardsmen, train them
in heavy equipment operations
and send them up into that area
where they're having a hard time
getting some of that work done.
And so, so it was right that we
trained uh a bunch of these guys
in Swift Water Rescue.
And in October of this year.
Um
On a drill weekend.
These guardsmen happened to
drill in Roswell.
When it started to rain.
And because they were there and
they were swift water rescue
trained and because they are who
they are, the minute Roswell
called and said, hey, we need
some help because our fire
trucks are getting stuck.
They ran out the door, even
though we had 1824 inches of
water in the armory.
And they set about saving about
300 people out of the water.
Um, this community emergency
response team, uh, has been in
multiple, uh, multiple times
this year saved lives of New
Mexicans, and they did it
because.
You allowed me to hire these
folks.
Um, I'm, I'm going to ask, not
this year, at some point that we
take more money out of the
general fund and just make those
positions, uh, permanent that we
can keep on and then when we can
reimburse the state from
disaster money, we'll do that.
But what an amazing, amazing
group of people who will go
anywhere in the state of New
Mexico, and they're loving it.
And so there's so much
infrastructure work, ditches
that are, that are, that need to
be cleared out.
Uh, culverts that need to be
cleared out all over New Mexico
that this team could shoot out
and help supplement.
The municipalities, the
counties, and the state who are
overwhelmed with this type of
work.
About, you get about a 6-time
return on money you spent in
prevention for disasters than
you do in response.
It's, it would be an amazing way
for the state to spend money and
to help our citizens from losing
our homes.
And maybe just maybe the fewer
homes we lose, the easier it is
to keep insurance in those
communities cause we all know
they're, they're dealing with
that challenge, so with that,
I'll be quiet and then I'll let
you uh talk about uh about the
bill and then gladly, ma'am,
we'll stick around and answer as
many questions.
Uh, as, as you have, uh, for us.
Thank you very much. I really
appreciate it.
We're going to take a question.
After the presentation.
Uh, you may begin whenever.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just
want to say I'm so proud of what
we have here between General
Herrera and general.
That's
Yeah,
the other one,
my dad was National Guard
because as a reservist, you have
pressure, you have a job and
then you have the military. The
other job is here. So it's
afternoon,
Madam Chair and members of the
committee and I'm here to
present House Bill 158.
Military-based planning.
expert witness, sorry,
is podcast, podcasting from the.
Kurtland Partnership and the
military base. I do have a sub.
Um
House Labor Veterans and
Military Affairs Committee.
You need the number or?
We can hear you just a little
bit closer. Thank you.
You want the number for the for
the substitute.
You can read out the number.
Hold on one second I'm
representative, but copy of the
substitute so we need to
transition with new.
We'll pass it out real quickly.
Madam Chair, I need the
committee sub for discussion.
Thank you. There's a motion to
move the sub.
Um, for discussion and.
Representative, will you read
the number now? Sure,
ma'am. 230313.1.
So there's a motion. Do we have
a second to move the committee?
Oh, representative Anaya, thank
you.
Thank you. So we have a, um, you
may proceed. OK, thank you,
Madam Chair. I'm here today to
introduce legislation for the
New Mexico military base. It is
aimed to support our critical
military installations including
Cannon Air Force Base, Holloman
Air Force Base, Kirtland Air
Force Base, and White Sands
Missile Range.
The military-based impact fund
will appropriate $12 million in
grant opportunities to provide
essential financial movements.
Outside of these installations
such as roads, water sources,
schools, and health care
facilities.
As other states benefit from
dispense funds for critical
infrastructure development, New
Mexico at the heart of national
security has a unique
opportunity to strategically
invest in our critical
infrastructure and job creation
efforts.
By doing so, we can enhance the
quality of life of our military
families and ensure that New
Mexico remains decisions.
the well-being of our personnel
and their families, an
investment not just in
infrastructure, but in the
future of New Mexico's national
security.
This bill also repeals the
sunset of the Office of the
Military Base Planning and
Support and the military base
planning commission.
with
this vital legislative

The military installations that
represent that we, we're also

Uh, we feel this with regard to
the DODs.
In states they look at how
communities support.
We are seeing other similar
funds with much, much larger
resources than what we're
proposing to be to think about
and begin this process with.
We see communities are military
communities coming to us through
the

The community or uh uh needing
things that they cannot get
through the national budget.

Committee, also a member of the
New Mexico Military Base
Planning Commission. Uh, I also
have a resolution on behalf of
the New Mexico municipal League
2024-6 concerning funding
support for the New Mexicoil
Base Planning commission,
whereas the economic impact of
military installations in New
Mexico is highly significant.
Uh
Uh, we fully support this, this
resolution was adopted in August
of 2024 by the communities in
attendance at the uh conference
of the New Mexico Miss League.
Uh, therefore, we are in full
support of this bill as well.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, first, I wanna
thank our sponsor for
The thankless task of carrying
this bill. My name's Sherman
McCorkle. I'm representing.
Many of us remember in 1995,
Kirtland Air Force Base was put
on the BAC Committee.
I'm one of the co-founders of
the current partnership
Committee.
We worked in 2005 on canon and
white sand, so we've worked on
these issues for 30 years.
All of us are volunteers.
The Department of Defense.
Has changed the way it works
with states.
Historically, they worked inside
the fence. They did everything
inside the fence.
Healthcare, schools, etc. That
has changed over the last 30
years.
The Department of Defense now
looks at states and asks them.
Do you, what can you do to help
us with healthcare. What can
you, this particular fund.
It is very important.
Because
It will address
Infrastructure immediately
exterior to the military
installation.
Would address things such as
roadways, asphalt.
Intersection crossings.
Uh, traffic lights, um.
Railroad crossings, various
kinds of fencing.
Uh, all the things that are
outside of the fence, but are
critically necessary to this
success. The greater Albuquerque
chamber strongly supports. Thank
you.
Are there any others?
We have no others uh to comment.
Madam Chair
Representative
Witness, thank you all for being
here.
I'm curious
What
I'm curious about the
The Office of Military Base
Planning and Support.
We'll be doing the grants.
To do this.
And it's an, it's.
Right
Madam Chair, uh, Representative
Hall.
We, we believe so. We, we have.
We will have a process.
To evaluate those.
Keeping in mind $12 million is
not a lot of money yet.
But we, we're, we're, we need to
test drive this and add value,
and if that's the case, I think
if I may, is we may need and
meaningful.
Madam Curious, yes sir, that's
where I was heading. Our
military has been in
Incredible part of the state. I
grew up uh
Side note
I love to see the Eisenhower
jackets back.
You gentlemen
But I got to, I would come down
during the Vietnam War and they
put me as a kid, but uh I, I
think this is outstanding. I
just noticed when it's
non-recurring and they're, you
know, they're expecting an 8
anyone doing these.
I, I would just
Um
My concern, Madam Chair, would
be
Will this money
I don't want it to be like this
one time thing either.
Because of the number of people
that are in in our communities
that have military.
Bas
And it's along the same lines,
if I may, Madam Chair, delve
into the prior presenters are
guard, um,
These are, these are assets we
cannot uh yield before.
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative.
Really, the 12 million doesn't
revert at the end of the fiscal
year is we'll need time
program, uh, so we.
In the future
You know, we, we may need, but,
but we need them in a
non-reverting manner.
It would be nice to have
recurring.
Non-reverting money is.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I also
did that caught my, my eye also
that it's uh.
Uh, non, non-recurring and
non-reverting.
But I think um
So since that's been kind of
answered, my question is.
Do you see this funding I chair
representative, uh, expert. I'm
sorry, I didn't catch your name.
Cassidy, um.
Is it, do you see the
possibility of matching or or
leveraging of, of these colors
and what does that mean?
In total dollars that you think
you could leverage this off.
Madam chair and Representative,
great question. I meant to cover
that on the front end of this
this there is a match
requirement.
A 10% match.
OK, so it, you know, you have to
be all in of a local Clovis.
Mhm
uh, if they came forward, they
would have to, they're applying
for.
$1000 of their own.
That's one way, but there's a
lot of Department of Defense
program that are not utilized
and so my our thoughts onation
could be leveraged to maybe.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I think
that's, that's important. I
think if we can not, not to put
down any of those other.
Um
Projects that that have a 10%
match. I mean, you, because you
have parameters to run it. One
project can have more than 4
million, I think. Did I read
that right?
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
Madam Sharon Representative, we,
we did strike that language and
reverted to the language in the
subs so that allows the
commission to debate and think
about how those rules numbers
that would be really
restrictively.
Thank you ma'am. That's what
happens when we have to.
You get confused. So anyway, uh,
Madam Chair Representative, so
the key is, is obviously
delivers the money. I think
that's really the key, and I
would
Anticipate that if.
We are able as a state to um
giving you this opportunity to
show what you can, how you can
expand this to make it.
$100 million or $120 million.
That would be amazing, and I
think it would just allow.
Legislature to see the
opportunity and continuing
projects like this, and maybe
make it a reverting, or excuse
me, a, a fun.
Um
The other question that I have,
Madam Chair Representative, is
do you have any specific
projects that you see.
Um, big projects. I'm not
talking about cleaning a
culvert. I mean, anything that I
can say that we can just couple
that we could understand what
you have plan because I'm sure
you didn't ask for money without
knowing what you wanna do. We,
we have a laundry list of
projects, uh, you know, one
major big project, um.
I
377th on on Air.
That's one thing I, I hear
Clovis, uh, the base has a.
That they would love. Mm-hmm.
Uh, City of Clovis has, uh, you
know, for instance, project, and
I'm getting folks.
I should have first, um, we have
had completed, if I may,
please elaborate here 72 inch
sewer line that's of Albuquerque
into the Midd Heights flows down
south through Kirtland Air Force
Base and down to where into the
South Valley where wastewater.
It was failing.
And we didn't have a source of
money and it paid $15 million
for that project.
Not every, we, we've had 3 mill
funded with uh federal
Department of Defense dollars
that we applied for and the
Uh, we have a great program.
There was another one I can't
remember.
But there's a lot of example.
Madam Chair Representative and,
and so just.
I want to make sure I got this
right just because of bills and
stuff and I might have not.
If, uh
Go this. Is it, is this money
only for capital infrastructure
or correction or is there money
that can be used for
operational.
Uh, Madam Chair and
representations,
funding mechanisms for like STEM
education and other things that
could program.
Uh, educational.
Uh, improvements, so it's not
necessarily all infrastructure,
but it's quality of life and
education is a quality of life
factor, and that's how we view
it.
Thank you, Ma'am your last
question is, and so.
That uh
Some of the projects that you
just mentioned, I'm assuming you
have them possibly shovel ready.
You're just waiting for Lalana
we call it money and
representative.
123, you're done. Um,
Holloman Air Force Base in
school KA is under construction
and White Sands Missile Range is
getting ready to apply for, I
think it's apply for a K8 total
rebuild down at the
At the base of White Sands
Missile Range east of Las
Cruces. Well, Madam Chair,
that's all I have. Thank you,
Representative. We need a lot
more bills like this coming
through this committee.
Thank you.
Thank you, uh, Representative
Nick, we have.
A representative vice chair
Chavez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, my
first question was actually has
already been answered. I wanted
to know what kind of
infrastructure.
And I don't remember who
answered the question.
Um, but the other question that
I have related to that is, you
talk about outside the fence.
So what does that mean? How far
outside the fence are we talking
about?
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative Chavez, it's
immediately outside of the
fence, um, infrastructure.
We've had requests for space.
To, to do infrastructure, road
implementation, but generally it
was road construction, uh, there
was also uh a railroad, uh, uh,
Melrose for the, sorry, the
Melrose range, um.
And it could be anything from
from roads to to fencing road
Clovis Road, uh, uh,
military members cross all the
time where there's cattle out.
Mm-hmm. So lots of just general
things that that are in support,
uh, we don't anticipate doing
things on for that that could be
a problem, but it, we wanna
leave our, our
Or the the policy development
will allow us. Um, Madam Chair
Representative, so when you talk
about when you give the example
of, of, um, the railroad, um,
replaced or whatever fixed. So
I, it would seem to me that
maybe that's a little.
Because I don't think the train
was gonna run right up against
the.
Military base. The other example
that you gave was the um.
The sewer lines.
And I'm a little bit familiar
with the water situation, um,
the contamination from Kirkland
Air Force Base and that's a few
miles, you know, when you go
from, so are those, I mean, does
it just depend on what the
situation is. Thank you, Madam
Chair and we did include in the
bill the concept of base service
area.
So that would cover it. So we
didn't want to be restricted to
a certain number of we, we have
communities that there's landing
zones, there's test ranges, um.
Uh, flight training base, uh,
range ranges.
Uh, landing zones.
Uh, so yes, we think we need to
critical needs that come
forward.
OK
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. The
other, um, I have a few other
questions. Um, so I think that
someone mentioned that um.
There was an issue
With uh federal dollars.
And do we anticipate the federal
government.
Continuing to cut back.
On federal dollars in terms of,
of these bases. I, my, my
concern is, Madam Chair
Representative, is that the
federal government is going to
give the state the response,
Madam Chair and, and
Representative, um, I did make,
I think it was about 80088
billion this last year.
The new administ out there that
they're gonna, it'll be up
things.
Uh
I don't see personally and all
of my readings, I don't see.
Immediately that there's going
to be a drop.
There's a huge amount of
infrastructure.
Um
Deferred maintenance on military
installation, which we deal with
with state buildings here. Same
issue with military
installations and also missions
are two kinds of facilities need
to be built, so there's a huge
demand for I, I don't think that
we're gonna be asked to put a
big box. I mean, they're gonna
go after uh the
fund it.
If we can leverage.
Help them.
Show the Department of Defense
support it any way we can. I
think that that will help us re.
Uh, Madam Chair Representative,
that raises another question
then. You, you talked about
technology in the.
Are are those the kinds of
things that that uh.
A Madam Chair representative,
no, we're talking about basic
infrastructure.
And, and really nothing but
within the gate, which is where
those kind of critical
facilities will be, but that's
what's driving for their local
bases and then, uh, Madam Chair
Representative, are there, is
there any talk about expanding
the number of military, uh, um,
Madam Chair, not at all.
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you,
Madam Chair, thank you for
bringing this. I just want to
make sure I have your name
right, Mulcahy.
your last name?
Cassidy Cassidy.
C
I'm pretty good.
It's a long day
um, Madam Chair, Representative
Sainana is this request in the
budget in, in the executive
budget right now they're still
um when we did the budget, the
senate, we have our own budget,
so I just talked to Amanda this
morning to make sure, but she
said it's it, it's priority and
We're hoping, yes, we're, we're
expecting it to be there.
That's fantastic. Thank you,
Madam Chair. Um, Representative
Satyana, do you think that any
of this money could be used to
match.
Other federal funds like
Repe funds, you know what those
are? Those are Department of
Defense, um, purchasing land
that is outside of the fence to.
Ensure the safety, protection of
the base, often many of these
bases are in rural areas where
Madam Chair and Representative,
yes, we have repi projects
individuals from that as well as
the Clovis.
Before Reppe was around, we
actually had to pay for a 74
year lease to uh expand the.
The uh
Melrose training.
Range by by retiring
agricultural property. So yes,
we're aware that the Sentinel
Project reclamation to expand
water supply over there is a
reppi project.
This, this could apply.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Representative Sariana in
the empire, which I understand,
you know, it doesn't get updated
when we have a committee sub.
There, there's a mention of, um,
up to 250,000 the department or
the office of the military bases
planning and support to do
economic analysis, um, have you
worked with?
Uh, economic development
department because they've got
all kinds of programs right now,
you know, they're on the Senate
side. I'm just wondering if, you
know, can the office bear.
That additional cost of maybe
the FIR is wrong. I'm not, you
know, just, just asking Madam
Chair and Representative, we
did,
I think it was 200 and we have a
new executive director, uh.
Retired Colonel Megan Cornett,
who
Mission supply at uh Portland
Air Force I listen to this.
She's at the Pentagon today, um,
meeting doing what she needs to
do as the new director, um.
Uh, and
Yes, we need to be able.
To, to do a number of things.
This fund is is being called a
we have some a great staff
member resources so that we can
really start supporting the
missions in our communities that
support the missions in their,
their, their hometown to.
To to get programs going and.
Do our work. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Thank you for that. So,
essentially you've asked for
some more operational funds for
your, for the office, um, sort
The wish of the committee.
OK
and the second I represents is
there any opposition have a due
pass on House Bill.
Sorry,
we need to step back one moment
Representative eager, yes, we
have to reframe.
for the start all over.
I'm passing is what we're gonna
do.
You move a do not pass on
Clean it up. I'm sorry about
that, Madam Chair. Madam Chair,
I move, uh, do not pass on.
I'll spill 158 and I do pass on
committee substitution.
Thank you.
Moving a do not pass on House
Bill 158 and a due pass, is
there any opposition?
Thank you. We're going to come
back to um
Both the
An adjunctta.
Aguilla, you both can come and
then um we're back to committee.
And um
Any questions or dialogue. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you.
First of all, I want to thank
you, uh, Secretary Herrera, and
uh.
Thank you very much, Major
General Aguilar.
Or
Your presentations.
Um, you know, sometimes we sit
in committee and through the
interim, and we're, you know,
I've been seeing you guys for a
few years and before that and
stuff and
Um, you know, in honor of, uh, a
former chairman, you know, um,
who passed.
You, you sit there in committee
and you go through these and
over and over and we seem like
we're
Sometimes even chasing our
tails, like it doesn't seem like
anything's happening.
And then you get a review like
this where you get
A briefing of the overall.
Work.
And you see
That all of a sudden a lot of
them have been working on.
This whole committee, not just
me but the whole committee has
been in support of and working
on these, this is nice.
And so you see things like the
field interactions.
How much they increased in in
even just my district, southwest
of New Mexico.
Uh, from, you know, up to 5700
people through here and I, I see
how this um mobile unit.
He places like Katherine County
where they're so rural out there
and to get someone to come into
Silver Cities like 100 miles one
way.
And then you look at, you just
look at the um
FY 24, the state benefits that
The people
Took advantage of with all the
legislation that was passed,
whether it's
Uh, going to Park Pass with this
the tax exemptions, which we're
gonna talk about and will
probably be.
2025, but the point is it's,
we're gonna see a big increase
there.
And uh
All your support for the the
active duty, uh, excuse me, the,
the, uh
Honor guard teams. I work with a
lot of those teams and they're
great people.
Uh, down at Fort Bear National
Cemetery.
And throughout the Southwest
mostly there though.
And you know wonderful.
Young men and women who
Mater and show the fallen
comrades, um, we're lucky to
have.
Uh, groups like the American
Legion, the VFW, Marine Corps
League.
That
If it wasn't for them, we
wouldn't have full military
honors, you know, we only have
sometimes as little as 2.
Uh, active duty members that
come over and, and uh present
the flag, or the flag.
But because of the, uh, and of
course then would pay tax, but
because we have those.
We're able to have full military
honors, which
When I started 30 some years
ago, you, you didn't have this
baby boom issue where you could
send a full team to us all over
the place. We don't see that
anymore because it's very
difficult even for retired,
fully retired um uh person.
And so, um, it's, it's, it's
good and they work really well
together together and uh we
appreciate them.
As I was scanning through here,
you know, um.
I just was curious cause I, you
know,
I haven't personally been to the
Tow Cemetery.
And um
I need to go.
And uh but uh.
How
I'm out of work cause I haven't
gone there.
But
work takes care of everybody in
Southwest, but uh how many acres
is that?
More trivia than anything.
Madam Chair representative, or
excuse me, uh.
A
man with your representative
Terrazo.
I, I believe we're at, at, at 50
acres currently, and there may
be an expansion that it is, is
uh possible uh in the future to
be encumbered there.
OK, and uh.
Just quickly, uh, Madam Chair.
Uh,
Secretary
Have, how long has that been
open?
Um, uh, representative Tarasas
it's actually the ribbon cutting
was done there has not been
unintermined there yet. They are
currently looking at staffing it
uh and getting going and I
believe uh the intent was to
have the federal government take
over this, but there is not an
intent from the federal
government to do that because
it's within the uh circumference
of angel fire and and Santa Fe.
It's uh not gonna be supported
by the VA to have a VA funded
cemetery.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Secretary, yeah, I, I think for
many, many, many, many, many
years.
Um, the two national cemeteries
that we had were
Uh, Santa Fe and and Fort Bear
and it was just one of the two
forever and then all of a
sudden, uh, you know, we have 22
new cemeteries, but they were
needed, they were needed. I
mean, those people, I, I feel
sorry for them. It's a long
travel if you're not in that
part, in regional state,
Northern New Mexico now has more
access to that than we do, but
uh anyway, um,
And then I just want to thank
you for the state, uh, Veterans
Transportation program. It's
just.
Incredible. That's a big need in
our area. I see that you guys uh
provided 150 services to 158
members and
And you know, that's a big deal
for their people and uh uh
actually veterans to the right.
Dress them properly. Veterans
that uh.
You know, they can't drive that
distance and to take him to
doctors and so forth and
appointments, we appreciate
that.
And so, and last, but I'm sure,
I just kind of quickly want to
go over the uh
Uh, Major General Aguilar.
In his efforts, um.
And I just had a quick question,
uh, the lottery scholarship and
the opportunities scholarship.
How's that affecting
recruitment?
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative
Taras says like it it affects
it, um, you know, the, the days
of us being able to sell the,
the National Guard as a way to
fund college.
We're kind of over now, we still
have uh federal tuition
assistance.
And so they qualify for those.
Uh, if you're a service member,
um, and you qualify after, you
know, for the post 9/11 GI bill,
and you serve long enough, you
can actually, you know, pass it
on to your kids. So my
daughter's gonna go to law
school next year. Uh, she's
gonna use up the benefits that I
didn't use.
Uh, because post 9/11 GI bill
didn't didn't exist when I went
to college. And so there's still
some, this Tricare, uh, thing
that we're gonna pass is really,
I think the next thing that you
can say, hey, we're gonna take
care of your healthcare
insurance.
And honestly, dollar for dollar
and it might actually be a
better deal, uh absolutely had,
had an impact, um, and we've
got, we've got a recruiting
problem, so we're sitting at
around about 500 short of what
we could have in the Army guard
about 100 from the air, um, and,
and we're in a really
interesting place where um
We haven't turned around our
recruiting as quickly, um.
There is a realignment for me.
Um, and
There there are some beliefs
that there may be some cuts in
the size of the of the army.
Active duty and the and when
those decisions come, if we're
where we are.
We will likely lose about a
battalion size, um, of, of
personnel, uh, and so, you know,
some of the stuff that we've
asked for I didn't cover in the
presentation, an amount of money
for us to be able to provide a
uh a referral.
Uh, award to a soldier who
brings another soldier as a way
to incentivize the force as a
whole, bringing more in. The
reason why I engaged so deeply
in these community, uh, school
projects is, yeah, maybe talking
to middle schoolers, middle
schoolers turn into high
schoolers and high schoolers
turn into guardsmen.
And so really trying to lay the
foundation.
To make sure that, you know,
that the community knows us, you
know, like I was talking about,
used to go to the armory, you'd
see the guard. It's not where we
are now and so when we started
doing the substitute teacher
mission in the middle of that,
you know, that, uh.
A coronavirus thing.
We had the community saying, why
is the military coming into our
community?
They're like, we're not, we're
not coming into your community.
We are your community.
And, but we've lost some of that
connection and so that's why
it's one of my lines of effort
is to go back into the
community, make sure that they
remember.
That were your neighbors, our
kids go to your, to your, to the
um to try to bring that back and
then the hopes is that we'll get
more.
who come back with a really
great opportunities whether you
do it for 4 years or you do it
for
36 years.
Well, um, Madam Chair, uh, Major
General, I, I think I love that
you're, you're showing that
you're part of the community.
It's not invading, it's that
you're part of the community,
you're working in your
community, you're
You're, you're, you're in the
restaurants, you're in there um.
schools, churches, I think it's
important to show that you're
part of the community. I, I, I.
And I, you took my, my next
question cause I thought that
was such an amazing move to do
the, the Tricare insurance. I
said that, now that makes sense.
And I, I would agree with you, I
think overall it might be cost
savings for actually for you
guys.
Yet yield more benefits cause I
think that's one of our biggest
issues, and you're right on
target when you say that uh how
much uh healthcare is costing
us, so, you know, last, uh.
Seeing the programs that you
have, the, the youth programs. I
mean, I always love to hear
that. I always wanna, one of
these days I wanted attend
graduations.
Um, for any of us that have
Had our children in the, in the
military. I have my, my daughter
who's
Who was in the Air Force and I
had to sign for her when she was
17.
Uh, to, to go to the military,
graduated.
Because of the way her birthday
was and so forth. And uh.
She's in Okinawa now. She's
coming home finally to the
states, which is great to see my
grandson, and so it's kind of
cool. He's, he's a 1 year, he's
gonna be 2 years when we.
But the day that we, we finish
here, I'm, I'm not counting or
anything, but, but anyway, I, I
just appreciate that because I
think.
You have the, the ability and
capability.
And unless you
Have walked that path and you
understand.
What the the the the young men
and women who are entering right
before uh I'll call it boot
camp. I don't know what you guys
still call it if you guys have a
new colorful name, but by the
time they come out,
The transition is incredible.
And when you go to, when you go
to one of the graduations and
you walk in through
the base, and you see how every
single young man and woman
address you with respect.
Yes, sir. No, sir. Thank you.
You're welcome. Excuse me.
It is like another world, man,
and it feels great and so if you
can do that for our kids in my
school, I, I really will always
support you. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, I represent toras
if I could, uh, so I, I don't
know if you see them.
Uh, at every youth challenge
graduation for the last two
cycles.
I, I, I send you a letter that
says, and I'm not, I'm not
calling you out, but I said each
and every one of you a letter
that says, we're having a
graduation.
Here's the number of kids from,
from your area who will be
graduating.
Um, and if you come to the bank,
we, we will sit you with some of
them.
Uh, so that you can meet them,
but they would love to have you
there.
The invitation is also open to
any one of you, and I'll, I'll
help get you there if, if you
need some help. Sometimes even,
you know,
on those flying machines, but um
you are welcome to come speak to
them. I try to get members of
the community leaders in the
community to meet them while
they're in that school.
And just, you know, encourage
them to continue, tell your own
story about your own success, so
that they can, they can
understand and envision success
because some kids
They can't envision the life
that they can have, they just
don't have the imagination for
it yet.
And so every leader that we can
put in front of you want to do
that, Madam Chair, Major
General, I, I, I, I want you to
hold me to that because I really
want to make time for that. Um,
I think it's uh something that I
would really enjoy and I'd love
to see that, you know, the, the
smiles and the just thank you
very much for sharing that and
uh I'll, I think I want to go on
a
What do you call those uh
I don't know if you have a, what
is that the black hawk would
work.
The Apache.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. Next,
we have Representative Garcia
followed by Representative
Mejia.
Thank you Madam Chair, thank
you, uh, gentlemen for your
presentations.
Uh, those are really thoughtful.
And uh full of.
Very significant information.
Um
You know, um,
I've got some real outstanding
uh.
Veterans, my district.
Um
One of them happened to be a
Medal of Honor winner.
Our medal honor recipient.
I don't know if you guys knew
him Madam Chair, uh, Richard
Rockwell.
And um
Uh
So he comes from
On the Atrisco area.
That's the oldest settlement in
New Mexico.
It's a land grant.
Going back to 1692.
Um
I don't know if Richard served
I'm sure as.
Uh, director, yeah, I, I don't,
I don't think so either.
But I did get to know him.
Uh
He was uh
Chairman of the South Valley
Area Council.
And they had kind of taken a
lease from APS, the public
school.
We run this uh old schoolhouse
called the Old Army Horner.
Um
And uh a group of us kind of
formed a community.
It was basically community,
community development
organization.
Focus there in uh Trisco.
Uh, extended into Barrela.
And the South Broadway area.
And uh
Uh, so we were able to kind of
negotiate with South Valley Area
Council.
Or
Converting that old schoolhouse,
which wasn't used anymore.
Or war on poverty programs.
Or a community center.
And lo and behold, uh we.
took off and it went well.
We had a uh
A senior citizen component.
Monitoring traditional dances at
the state fair and the old
traditional colonial Spanish
dances.
You hardly see nowadays.
We had a youth component.
Uh
Targeting the med school there
at Ernie Pyle high school.
In terms of setting up
Tutorial programs.
And we had a land grant
component.
Um
With theatrisco land grant.
And are struggling to regain.
are
Land rights to that 50,000 acre
land grant.
And uh
Lo and behold, uh.
Some of the political forces
tried to kick us out of the
center there.
And at that time, you know,
we're talking late 70s in the
early 80s.
We had a lot of political
Indiarico and far South Valley.
Including one that went to 5
years in federal prison for
political corruption.
Not more than 8 years ago.
And uh
But lo and behold,
Richard Rocco stood up for us.
And allowed us to continue with
our program.
So I always kind of
Uh
Keep that in mind in terms of.
What I do up here.
And
I'm the author of the 100%
property 2003.
But you know, Madam Chair, it
didn't happen overnight.
We started with that legislation
when I first came on board.
Uh, a year after 1998.
And for 5 years,
I brought up my parelasse.
But
Bajari
On Broadway.
And they'd come and testify in
the committee, Madam Chair.
And for 4 years
And in that 5th year, I'm
talking about veterans like
Flavio Chavez.
World War 2, right?
I in the Pacific Rim.
3
Uh, Purple Hearts.
He was left to die on the battle
and the commanding officer let
him.
But because of his guts and
gumption, he crawled.
To the front line where the
troops retreated to.
And uh what happened is that uh
Japanese grenade fell on him.
And he tried to shake it off and
taking it off.
It exploded.
So it kind of paralyzed them.
And uh
The sergeant then called a
retreat and he looked at Flavio.
And uh
I said, help me.
And the commanding sergeant.
See you later, guy.
It was bayonet kind of crawled
all the way.
Those hundreds of yards
Where they had retreated.
And he looked at the sergeant in
the eyes when he got to that.
That line
Hm
As out
Next thing he was in a medical
hospital.
That's the kind of it that came
up here, the lobby for that
property tax exemption.
And I can give you examples of a
dozen more.
You know, Madam Chair, that 5th
year, 2003.
The rich and came on board.
You know, and uh we still had
that same chair that would
always kiss us off.
But the veterans are starting to
see kind of a dynamic.
After the 3rd year, they said,
you and Miguel, we come up here.
They shoot us down
Then we see all these tax reform
bills for the oil, you know, and
they give us the finger.
You know, so that 5th year.
When the committee tabled our
bill, which is customary in tax
and rev, but they knew what was
going to happen afterwards.
Most feds went up to the
committee members and in their
face down USOBs, you better pass
this one this year.
Because you've been doing all
these for the past 5 years have
been kissing us with the oil and
gas company. Now it's your
terminal to, to, to face up.
And, and, and, and help us vets.
Well they, they finally passed
it out in the tax bill that
year, but it took that kind of
guts and gumption from the vets
to make it happen.
So it wasn't an easy process.
You know, and uh,
You know, the other thing, Madam
Chair, that kind of.
led me to see the significance
of doing something like.
Was out of our community center,
the Casa Community Center, and
this is important for you guys
to understand uh history.
What are bits my communities
have had to go through.
VFW, man.
DAV we're not doing anything.
Regarding
The Agent Orange lawsuit.
Against Corporation.
Agent orange contamination.
So what we did as a little
Chicano.
They're in the heart of Arisco.
We set up an agent Orange
outreach program.
Not run by vets.
Is he ever down in the dumps,
they were hiding in the closets
because they were so kind of out
of it.
In terms of the post-traumatic
stress.
So who stepped up their wives?
Their wives stood up.
We set up this little core
group.
About a dozen wives.
Of his Vietnam vets.
And we set up an agent orange
outreach program.
To fill out an application form
to be part of the lawsuit that
the vets had filed at the
national level.
The gain benefits from that
Agent Orange contamination.
So then we with the little
budget manager.
We put out ads in newspapers.
houses.
I carry
Gallop
In terms of getting the beds to
come into our little center.
an application.
be part of this lawsuit.
And
We add in the local newspaper.
The good thing, Madam Chair, is
that.
The veterans for groups.
Offered to put up bands.
And transport the vets.
Get
Bring him in, take him back
home.
Our little senior said.
Kind of uh
Uh, program that we have,
Loaitas Mancha.
I had a lunch for them.
And enchiladas with beans and
chili.
For these people that were
coming in.
All the way from Taos to.
carry, yeah.
And we had hundreds of beds.
But those vets, it wasn't wives
that came.
It was their wives that filled
out the application form.
And it was their kids, man.
They came with them.
You know who their kids were?
Kids with spina bifida.
Is that didn't have a hand.
That didn't have a for on.
You know, and the vets that came
in there.
You know, someone
Right there when we're doing the
application at the center, there
was this car with a muffled
muffler and.
You know, we're going ba ba ba
ba ba ba.
And what did one of the lads do?
You hit the ground.
He's going through post
traumatic stress right there in
front of us.
You know, and uh
So we did an outstanding thing.
the far South Valley do.
They contacted these.
Veteran organizations.
And they told them that we're
helping out with buses, vans.
Transportation.
They told them, what the hell
are you guys doing?
Helping these communists.
Or at the that Arunity Center.
So these vets
group pulled out.
You know who our board was?
A retired justice of the peace.
Vice President
Of the
Carpenters Union.
You know, a retired police
officer.
You know, uh an advocate for
Social Security who herself was
disabled.
She put 95, 90 there Latrisco in
the far south valley on Social
Security.
That was our board.
And that's when these corrupt
politicians are saying that
we're a bunch of communists.
You know, and um,
So all these things, Madam
Chair.
Led me to kind of introduce that
legislation, even though I'm not
a vet. My dad was a vet.
I got a deferment.
Mainly because I was a
The oldest son in the family.
When my dad died in 1969.
You know, and uh plus I had bad
vision, so I got the permit.
But
I went to college.
And I didn't want to go to
college venture.
But what happened August 3rd of
1969.
My dad was on his deathbed. He
brought the 4 oldest ones into
the hospital.
One by one
What he asked of me.
He said he thought all I could
feel that.
You.
It's something I got asked.
I go to college and graduate
from that was the last thing on
my mind, man. I wanted it to be
a va loco del barrio all my
life.
I drinking on Friday, Saturday.
And Sunday to to cure the
hangover.
You know, partying all the time
and going out with a different
girlfriend every month.
That's what I wanted to be on my
life.
But that day with my dad.
But it didn't end there.
A veterans officer.
Pull me over, he was a cousin to
my dad's kumara and compare.
He came in
To the house, he sent me get.
This is what you have.
If you go to college.
He said your mom would
automatically get $150 a month.
Because of benefits for your
dad, and well, hell.
He's my mom.
We already raised 3 elder
siblings.
And my cell
And 4 younger siblings.
On the age of 58, 12, and 13.
That's like, I've got to go to
college.
That's how I can help out the
family.
You know, and uh.
So all these things is what
really motivated me to.
Do that exemption.
You know, and that and
You know, when I come in from
the pea.
Of drinking all night, partying.
You know, whatever.
My mom would always be the
mioza.
A scaredy cat.
He locked the door.
My dad would come in, unlock it,
because he knew that I was gonna
be coming in 34 in the morning.
Well
This is the only thing that that
I learned that my mom and
siblings didn't know.
When I come in, I tell my dad
crawling on the floor.
He was reliving his combat days.
In France and Germany.
He was actually talking to
Conversing kind of like holding
the gun, crawling.
You know, and I said Makina.
It was all I was all drunk.
So man I I can't stand this.
pick him up, I'd wake him up,
wake him up, wake him up.
Take him to the bed.
I did it about 5 times in my
teen years.
Stuff like that is what
motivated me to do that
exemption, you know.
You know, and um, and I'm Madam
Chair, um.
I realized yesterday that we
have issues.
With the two constitutional
amendments.
And I was not aware until
yesterday.
In the tax committee.
You know that apparently.
Things aren't going that
smoothly.
In terms of getting those
benefits out.
To the veterans
On the staggered
On the staggered exemption.
Now we can go to 90, 80, 70.
60, 50, 40, 30.
You know, and then on the other
exemption of 4. So that's my
question to you.
Are we, are we gonna be
Live up to the committee. I
mean, live up to the commitment.
Of those veterans and the widows
of the veterans.
You know, in terms of manner.
And what was the problem?
What, what did we not do in
those constitutional amendments.
That caused us to kind of fall
into this quagmire.
You know, and if you can kind of
explain to the committee what
that quagmire.
Um, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Garcia, thank you
for that and thank you for the
support.
Of, of your, your father and
all, all the veterans.
Uh, to address
Your, your question is the issue
when the
To house joint resolutions were
written. I think it was an
oversight that when the
Language was written to be
implemented in 2024, the
$10,000.
There was an assumption made
that there may be a special
election prior to the general
election of 2024 and not
realizing when the tax deadlines
were for the assessors.
Because the tax deadlines
predate and also the protest
periods predated the general
election for 2024.
So I believe I just believe that
was an oversight when the
language was written in the
joint resolutions and were
passed. So the 24 assumption
that 10,000 would have kicked in
immediately.
When was not
Able to be done because the
general election was already
past the protest periods for any
of your evaluations of, of uh
real estate of, of their
property taxes. So I believe
that was an oversight.
For 25, I do not believe there's
going to be an issue, um, I'm
very confident that the 400 to
10,000, that's an administrative
adjustment on the assessors, and
we have good solid numbers based
on the number of dis disabled
persons in all counties
throughout the state based on VA
data as the close of 2023 that
we have a good understanding
what's the cost to every county
is gonna be.
Because their budgets for 2025
have already been let, they're
executing those budgets right
now, so they will have a, a, a
reduction in, in revenue from
that, from what I understand, in
working with the assessors as
well as tax and rev.
So that is gonna be an easy
implementation once this gets
done and passed, they can, they
will be able to be applied that
to the 2025 tax year, hence the
emergency declaration to have it
done by the end of February.
And signed so they can actually
send out the new notice of eval
evaluation for the properties to
implement that 400 to 10,000.
The next piece for 2026 will be
the
Staggered disability exemptions.
We know that there's another,
um,
Large percentage of veterans
that are eligible for that. Now,
based on the county's statistics
that we have, uh, throughout the
state based on that same data
set from, from the VA.
We're looking at probably 35,000
to 50,000 veterans that are
eligible to apply for that, and
they'll have to reapply.
Come in and then we, each county
based on their breakdowns, we
can actually assess.
That information through DBS
since we adjudicate that and
provide that to the assessors so
that they can in turn make their
budgets and be prepared for 26
and the notice of evaluations to
go out next year.
So it had to be staggered based
on some of the uncertainties of
where the budgets landed and,
and some of those, those issues.
Um, I am no tax expert, nor am I
an assessor, but um we've done a
lot of discussion on this, and I
believe that
The concern yesterday in
yesterday's hearing was
There was no prescriptive
language on the stackability of
these of these because by
statute.
Veterans may get both.
So you will get the $10,000.
Uh, tax exemption.
The $2000 head of household
exemption.
As well as a percentage if you
are also
That so they how to stack those
properly and put them against
the property values, needed to
be discussed a little bit more
in detail, and I believe that's
the language that they refined
so that the tax and revenue
committee would have more
confidence in executing that and
pushing it to the floor for a
vote.
So we didn't run into any uh
Any, any issues with it as it
went forward.
Yeah, well, thank you for that.
Mr. Secretary, I can see, you
know, which I wasn't getting
yesterday on that tax uh.
health practitioner.
Rural healthcare, but I thank
you for that.
Um
And uh
You know, um
General Aguilar, um,
Every year,
Almost every other year.
Which is uh
28 years.
Um, Madam Chair, uh.
I get a request.
From a student in my district.
To to take advantage of the
legislative scholarship for
Military Institute.
And uh
Uh
Uh, last year I had this.
Young man
Uh, contacted me and said,
Representative Garcia.
Um
Is that you have to kind of fill
out a form that the as you
complete in terms of authorizing
the scholarship.
And uh man, the young man sent
me a letter.
Being thankful and grateful.
You know Garcia, my mom and dad
are, are low income means.
I have this vision
I, I wanna
You know, uh
OK
I I when I complete my vision.
And uh
You're gonna me uh.
Uh, the first step.
In that
By getting the scholarship.
Because there's no way that I
could really have gone to any
postsecondary education.
Because of the low income status
of my parents.
Uh, but
You've given me that
opportunity.
And I want to do good.
I'm gonna do good for my
parents.
My parents are elated and
excited that this is happening,
and I'm not gonna let
Then down. I'm not gonna let the
school down and I'm not gonna
let you down.
What a great kid, man.
I.
You know, and I get a lot of
kids like that.
You know, man.
You won't believe.
You know, the kids that applied
for that scholarship. I mean,
they just.
Come out of the
I'm out with these wanders.
You know, you never envision.
That this little action of being
a sponsor of a scholarship.
But instill in a, in a
youngster.
And one last question, um.
General
Ala
I, I, um,
You know, I've, I've always had
high esteem for the military.
My first, uh,
Scholarship
Uh, went to Jose Chavez. He's
good friends with my son.
They played football together,
basketball uh.
And uh
Naturally, he was also low
income means.
But that didn't keep them from
excelling.
And he had wonderful parents.
Um,
And now he's kind of a
Certified
I know
No.
I know one of the highest
rankings that you can get in
terms of a nurse specialist.
And it's good to see kids like
that.
Um
One thing that man I'm sure that
has kind of disturbed me.
In recent sexual harassment.
That has happened at and uh.
I don't know the specifics. I
don't know the detail.
An advocate.
Women not having to experience.
Um
And I hope that things are
getting remedied.
And there's some kind of
corrective action going on.
And that the culprits.
Are fully, you know, and
expelled and whatever needs to
happen.
Kind of maintain that integrity
with our, you know, and uh.
Uh, so I don't know if you can
kind of
You have a briefing?
Small briefing in terms of where
we stand with that issue, Madam
Madam Chair, uh, Represent
Garcia, so I'm an alumnus of the
school.
I don't have any oversight of
it.
So, uh, I don't really know any
more information. In fact, you
probably know more about it than
I do.
Um, there, there is no doubt
that um
The
The prevalence of sexual
harassment, sexual assault.
In the ranks in general in the
military.
Uh, has been a, been very public
over the last few years.
The, you know,
I will tell you how we address
it.
Um, 11 very seriously.
Um, because there's no place for
it.
See, the, the way I look at all
of this is, um,
You know, every career in the
military, you, you go to a map
center.
You raise your right hand in
front of the flag and you swear
an oath.
And you know that when you swear
that oath,
Uh, you may be given in your
life and that type of
commitment.
To the nation
Deserves dignity and respect.
Everybody should be treated.
Um, like someone who's willing
to give your life for each other
because we are.
We lose sight of that.
Uh, oftentimes as leaders.
We excuse behavior because it's
locker room talk or it's just,
it's just the guys.
Um, how we've, uh, like,
When it gets to my level,
It's dealt with is is swiftly
and as harshly and as is and,
and with as much discipline as I
can.
I've kicked lots of people out
of the guard and out of the
military.
Uh, for that, including people
who I personally knew.
Who are my friends
There's no, the answer isn't in
my pen.
And in my authority.
It's in leaders at the lowest
level, believing what I just
said.
And then saying it will not
happen in my squad.
And addressing it.
Right then and there.
Ah, swiftly, not with, not
necessarily with discipline, but
with saying, hey, you will not
speak to one of my soldiers that
way.
This is not how it behaves, and
when you address it.
Humans are humans, they conform.
To the standards of the group.
The standards of the group.
Um, where, where they should
have been.
And in many, many places.
And, and that's how we've set
about addressing it.
I will tell you that I know the
superintendent for time with
him.
He believes what I believe.
And so I, I believe that he's
attacking that problem.
Uh, swiftly now.
And, and that should help
significantly.
Um, because you're right, that
school.
Is a beacon of hope.
It, it, it changes streams, the
legislative scholarship which
you spoke about, uh, the ability
for people who cannot afford an
education to have one.
is powerful
I mean, I, I
It didn't exist when I was a
young high school student.
Um, after all of the Pell
grants,
And all of the stuff that we got
for New Mexico Military
Institute.
My parents' contribution still
was $1000.
And so they went down to a short
term loan place in Roswell.
And took out a loan for me.
To pay for college. I tell
people my dad made a bet on me
with money he didn't have.
Um
No parent should ever have to do
that.
In order to to assure an
opportunity for a student to
have a um.
That lottery scholarship, um.
The the opportunity scholarship,
all of those things.
Are allowing kids.
Who were born to a family didn't
have.
An opportunity to grow and have
an American dream.
Uh, and it's incredibly powerful
that you perform for your part
with the legislature's done and
the governor's done to get this,
it, it warms my heart and I have
a passion for.
Um, getting the most potential
out of our kids because I think
this state.
Uh, could be significantly
better.
I think we have, we just need to
open it up to those kids.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you Presentative.
met him here, if I could just, I
just want to assure you,
Representative Garcia, manager.
The bust of
Of, uh, Richard Rocco is in a
safe place in our Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in Angel Fire,
we took possession of that last
year and it is proudly displayed
as you walk in.
To, to our, our display there in
the museum to ensure that uh a
man as great as he is, is, is,
is uh honored properly uh
amongst his brothers and sisters
there.
Next, we have Representative
Mejia.
Um
So
Thank you, madam. Next, we have
Representative Hall as well,
Madam Chair.
Um
You mentioned you're gonna be
expand mine. I want to
compliment your leadership
through the years. I am a
I
Retired FBI agent who ran the
Farmington and Gallup offices
and frequently worked with
The National Guard.
And uh
Cops were outstanding
accommodating, and that comes
from the.
And uh
We do have a you know a senator,
the minority leader.
Is anemi graduate?
So
You might snag him to take him
down tonemi. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Next we have um Madam.
Thank you, um, Madam Chair. Um,
I actually have a number of
questions, but maybe I can.
Get your contact information and
talk to you about. I'm
interested in the uh middle
school.
Um, if that's in my district.
So the only question that I have
right now is that you made a
comment earlier, Madam Chair,
um, about
New Mexico.
Um
Bombing and I'm the Middle East,
we're sending smart bombs to the
Middle East from New Mexico.
Is, is that a correct?
No, um, Madam Chair, uh,
Representative Chavez.
We have an intelligence
squadron.
That is
They provide, uh, so in order
for those bombs to do what they
do.
You have to use, you have to uh
do targeting data. So, so, so an
airman uh will take a look at
the geography, the target, where
they think, where where they
think people are, whether it's
populated like they take all of
that information.
Uh, and then that, uh, that's
fed into the system, one for,
for that, for that bomb to drop
precisely where it needs to.
Uh, the other is for it to have
the effects.
That the combat commander wants.
Uh, and also is, is cognizant
of, of the damage.
Uh, that would be done by it.
To mitigate any, any damage uh
that they didn't intend to have,
and so.
They, they provide a piece of
it. They don't decide what to do
with it.
Um, you know, it usually is done
way in advance and so they
basically provide the analysis
on the ground and.
And I, and I say all that
because I think the
The, the level of
Uh, critical thinking.
And the skills that we build
with those airmen.
Um
Is is incredible for their
development.
So Madam Chair, can you tell me
which countries in the Middle
Eastpresentative Chavez,
uh, it, it could be any of them.
Um, I can't, I, I can't, I don't
even know which ones in
particular have been dropped.
Um, the, they are given a task
and they support multiple
combatant commands with um.
They, uh, they often don't even
know if their data and their
target was executed.
Um, and so I couldn't tell you,
they're, they're not assigned to
a particular country. They work
in a wide area all around the
world.
Um, and those are, those are
selected and then
Um, Madam Chair, then I would
assume that we're working with
those other countries that are.
Bombing other countries, is that
a correct assumption, Madam
Chair Representative Chavez, uh,
so we don't.
You know, the our, our, our
portion of it is, is very
specific to the technical data.
In, in the assignment that they
get.
Um
How, how the, the, the
agreements between the United
States military, its allies, are
the nations that it affects.
Those things were we're not
engaged in. So I'm, I'm sure
some of those things happen. I'm
not, I'm not well for
So Madam Chair, can you give me
a
Uh
A list for lack of a better way
to put it, of the countries in
the Middle East.
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative
Chavez, I don't have that.
Um,
You know, um, and then I, I,
like if you're, if you're saying
here, give me a list of all the
targets that we've been involved
in, uh, even, even if I had the
list, I couldn't give it to you.
Um.
But um
That's, that's all data that
resides with that combatant
commander.
Madam Chair, then I'm going to
assume that the countries are.
Palestine
Yemen.
Syria
Maybe Lebanon?
Those are the countries that I
know that I've heard on the
news.
That uh
Would that be correct?
Uh, Madam Chair Representative
Chavez, uh, you can assume that.
I don't know if that's accurate
or not.
Um, you know, we've, we've
prosecuted a uh an operation
against terrorist organizations
all over the world.
Um, and so,
Uh, so, the ones in the eachs of
which ones I couldn't tell you,
uh, if you're asking me
specifically as is something
been dropped on Gaza that we had
anything to do with, I couldn't
tell you that.
Madam Chair, I'm going to assume
that we do have a whole lot to
do with that.
Thank you. Thank you and um.
I appreciate your, your uh
presentations today. I think
that um.
There are um.
Particulars.
that you touched on in your
reports. I just wanna make sure
that we're clear on that. I, you
know, having been a a military
dependent.
With a father who was in the
division that.
Doesn't flow to us.
Um, so I just wanted to thanks
where we're at, but I do have a
question.
That is a little concerning.
Only because, and you may not be
able to answer this answer and
but.
I understood.
In terms of the requirements.
Either volunteer or be.
Recruit it, uh, not require a
degree or.
Um, and they would just have 50
on whatever exam that they
tender. So I'm wondering if you
what would be the um place
confirm whether these changes
it.
Madam Chair,
So not that I'm aware of, um,
in, in order to, to, uh, enlist
in the active duty, uh, in, in
the guys back here might correct
me because um you have to have a
high school equivalency.
And you have to be 18 years old.
Uh, in order for you to enter
the active component.
Um, before you go into the
military, you take the ASVAP
test.
Uh, and the, I, I, I joke about
it sometimes with peoples
because, you know, the army says
you'll be all you can be, um,
you take the test and the army
tells you this is all you can
be, right? Depending on how you
score. And so, uh, there are
minimal, uh, scores, and it gets
complicated because some of the
breakout scores also apply to
certain vocations, but
Generally speaking, in order for
you to enlist.
Uh, in, in a position in the
army, like you've got to score
of 31.
Uh, in order, uh, to get in a 31
says, um,
Uh, it's a percentile, so you
have to score, you know, in the
31 percentile of all the people
who have taken the test in the
past.
Uh, the higher you score, uh,
the greater the options are if
you score above a 50, usually
that's the cut for a, a bonus.
And so anything above that, now
you can get
A $30,000 enlistment bonus or
whatever it is it's being
offered. Anything below that in,
in higher than the 30, you can
enlist, um, you just, you just
get a free trip to to basic
training and so um that's kind
of how that works out.
Uh, I'm not aware of any
changes. There, there are those,
uh, even in the guard, you know,
in other states who would, who
were proposing that.
That we maybe change the
standards a little bit.
We haven't heard much from this
current administration. I will
tell you that the sick uh army
and the Secretary of Defense,
um, refused to change the
standards.
Uh, for entry, uh, so that more
people are eligible.
Uh, they want to ensure that
they get a certain quality
recruit.
Uh, there are programs that were
uh are available today.
That will allow them to come in,
uh, select amount of the
population, and if they have
problems, we can run in through
some tutoring.
In the hopes of getting the
right score and the same with
physical fitness and weight.
Um
But they have to meet the
minimum entrance requirements
before they leave that program
and are accepted and shipped to
basic.
Thank you. I just want to make
sure the people.
Um, questions or comments for
those people that
don't understand having been
through it. It's not a
percentile. Would you agree,
Madam Chair, uh, general, that,
uh general that
It's not like we know it in
school, 50's a failing and 60s a
D and C. It's not that type of
of of scoring. So when you hear
that, 30%.
It, it's a different, it's 30th
percentile of the of of what I
guess the normal or the average
person is, is done, is that a,
I, I don't know if I explained
it exactly, but I know it's not
the same great scale as we know
in, in school.
Madam Chair represents Anna,
you're absolutely right. It's,
it's a percentage of the
population who takes the score,
not a score of 30, um, and then
you got 30% of the questions
correct.
Um, and so when you have
somebody, we have some, we just
had that youth challenge kid who
scored the 97% of people who've
ever taken that.
It's amazing and my daughter
scored an 80, the last, the last
question I was gonna tell you,
the, the, and then they have a,
they have 3 opportunities, if I
remember right.
To take, to retake if they
choose, but if they.
lower, it's the next.
test. So if you, they score, I
don't know, 60, and then the
next time they take the score,
Madam Chair representative, uh,
and they take it again.
And they get a 50, I think they
have to take the, the lower of
the two, because it was.
After the higher score, if I
remember right, Adam Chair
Representative Dos says, you are
correct, 3 isn't a limit though.
It's, it's a matter of space and
time in between the tasks, so
some will take it more often
than that.
Thank you. That's all I have.
Thank you and I just wanted to
remind all of us that we are the
labor veterans and military
affairs Committee. So we welcome
you. Thank you so much and thank
