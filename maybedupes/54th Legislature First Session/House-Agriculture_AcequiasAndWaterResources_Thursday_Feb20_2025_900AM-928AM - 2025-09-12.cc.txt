being pushed.
um,
it went, went through, um,
natural resource.
Which
actors
administrative role.
So
the mineral segregation that
that
That that there be no
That that there will be on
there,
but, uh, OK, so, so it'll
prevent new mining.
Uh
And then there's about 20 years.
2 years is usually what
what's typical for as we all
know
other administration so I'm
pretty.
I of course to the
administration.
So, um,
especially with this that we are
on

So so the the
the uh.
Had then.
No, no, OK, OK, we got
segregation
we know
there's a contract
with
No, no, OK, OK, we got
segregation
we know
there's a contract
to get that done,
but that is a good sign of that.
OK.
And uh.
Yeah, shut shutting down mining.
Uh, in that area.
Can you explain that to me to me
a little bit.
Madam,
we realize that.
to our lives,
but there are some areas that
are.
Just
disturbance and services where
we have recover from
traffic,
I don't think you can handle,
uh.
That, that crash after,
um.
In that area, we have many
many hacks. It's been like.
Our community wants to.
Um
Enjoy the benefits of
our
children are gonna be packed in
the water. OK, and, and I can
understand that, uh.
I do.
That, that,
that we need to work.
And, and, and, and uh.
Which, which create
opportunities for the citizens
of the state.
So I, I, it kind of gives me
vations.
On, on
Why can't can't work with one
another and
another.
and
I do understand.
the
one thing that.
at all.
I
Forest fires.
Some of some of the big
disasters we've had.
and
and and.
Ours.
all come together.
To address those those problems.
And, and, and
here with keeping.
Uh,
pickles.
Uh,
pristine environment where
we're not looking at the biggest
factor that we have in the state
and I think they we move
forward, you know, you know, we
learn and progress and
I think that's something we
we.
That concludes my questions.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
legislation here
um this
this movement protection.
Um, so a lot of this language is
also this area just by geography
is of course also impact air. It
was right in the the fire path
right in the burn scar area, um,
and, and again, just this
memorial is, is just a memorial.
Again, just again, signifying
the importance and I am.
I take your, take your
sentiments, um, just as by
nature just being in that area,
um, that is a concern, but this
language is also, you know, kept
OK, any other questions? Go
ahead in a group.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for bringing the
legislation. I do as well as
Represented some more have
reservations about the way this
memorials been chair and and
sponsor, I, I.
Understand the reasoning behind
it.
Unfortunately this morning, uh,
your, your witness, uh,
Made it into my office and
talked to me about, talked to
myself and a couple others about
this. I have an issue with
Locking down.
Mining piece of this.
We have Madam Chair.
Uh, we have the opportunity for
industry. We have the ability.
To do things right and do things
clean.
The ETA is very specific about
um.
Where our goals are headed to
and some of the minerals that
are up in this area would be
specific to that meeting some of
those needs within the state of
New Mexico instead of doing it
outside.
Madam Chair
Representative, I've
A fish that area for I haven't
been there as long as.
Uh, uh, family that have been up
there.
Over that time frame, I have
watched.
Our state parks.
In federal parks get locked
down, areas where I could
Pull in and.
And put up a tent.
And fish for a weekend.
I can no longer do that.
They can.
Or state parks are not taking
care of.
Bill track and other areas up
there.
Um, to
Be able to bring 5th wheels or
anything like that in.
When I was a kid, I fished in.
We would park up there. We would
camp up there. You can't do that
anymore. You can walk up there.
As an 11 year old, we could park
out a chair and, and
representative we could park at
Paella. I could grab my little
Boy Scout backpack and Boy Scout
cooking kit. My fishing pole and
Head, head up to the mountains
and go fish for 3 days.
That's getting more and more.
Lockdown.
As we continue to go.
Yes, I agree that that there are
things that we need to do to
protect that watershed.
And as represent Zamora talked
about, we're not talking about.
Pushing a memorial that that.
Would require our federal
government to clean up.
The forest up there.
And
Comment, Madam Chair and
representative was that, you
know, this river goes all the
way down to Carlsbad.
No, it goes all the way down to
the Gulf of Mexico.
And
Uh, while I agree that we need
to to do things up there. We
should not stop.
Industry
In every place that we continue
to get them.
Everybody's happy.
With
Receiving the revenue from oil
and gas.
But they continue to stifle
industry and the rest of the
state and want to live off of
that road.
I have a problem with that.
I have a problem with not in my
backyard.
And so with that right now.
Thank you. Would you like to
comment quickly?
Um, thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. I
also just again want to bring
back that this is not um.
Putting anything into statute,
um, memorial is simply stating
historical facts as they have
occurred, um, current, just
area.
Thank you. Thank you,
Representative Herera.
Thank you, uh,
While, while they were doing
reclamation efforts there, um.
There's a lot of moving a lot of
that contaminated material, a
lot of that cuttaminated
material was irresponsibly used
by the Forest Service on
campgrounds.
Rhodes
Even in my road on a county
road, um, in Pe or something.
So
Run off
Big runoff came, storm event.
A lot of that stuff went in the
river.
90,000 fish killed off, crippled
our fish hatchery.
Never came back the way it was.
Um, crippled our local economy
for at least 5 years.
And um
