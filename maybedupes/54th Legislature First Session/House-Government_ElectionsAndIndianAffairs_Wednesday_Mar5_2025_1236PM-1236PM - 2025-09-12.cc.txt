Representative Mejia

Zamora
madam, vice chair, madam
chair. We have a
quorum.
>> Hey, I don't have
any housekeeping announcements.
So let's go ahead
and begin with
Representative
Lundstrom.
>> Thank you. Thank you, madam chair.
I do have a committee sub if
someone could please move that for
discussion.
>> So madam
chair,
>> we have a motion for
discussion.
Oh, >> these
are
thank you madam chair and thank you for
committee. Good morning. I'm here
to talk to you all about.
Um the
committee substitute for
House Bill 477.
The first bill that you had
seen, uh and
I'd asked and I appreciate you all
rolling it over.
Basically. Uh I
think was
candidly poorly written
and also uh poorly
titled when it was uh
states. It's an act to
provide an exemption for, for
members of the legislature.
It simply is true madam
chair. What this
is, is a
fix for what happened
in the second session of
2020.
Uh the 54th
legislative session,
the second session of 2020
House Bill
117,
amended the Lodgers
Tax Act to
alter certain exempt
exemptions cer
changing the allowable
costs of occupancy,
tax, tax
revenue and madam
chair committee. What
happened, the issue
that I want to talk to you about today
was, was caught up in that
it was on page seven,
um
lines
34 through
eight. And that's
when the change occurred was in
2020. And basically what
it boils down to
if um
and it does affect legislators,
but there's more legislators
involved. You stay in a
hotel here
um in, in
Santa Fe. After
30 days, you are
exempt from paying lodgers
tax. I don't
know how many of y'all
stay in hotels. I
have for the last 25
years
and the last
few years. And I
asked our hotel
manager why
that exemption hadn't
been provided. He
said, because you guys
didn't reauthorize
it. So
for years and
years, uh
after 30 days,
um the
largest tax is removed
if you stayed in a
hotel more
than 30 days.
But
the other thing about this bill,
madam turing committee, not only
would it affect legislators
that are up here
for
6030
day sessions. It
affects groups like uh
fire Eva uh
evacuees
from uh the area
when people had to move out of,
out of their uh
homes here in the
north, we're looking for
temporary shelter.
Um This would affect
folks like that.
It would also affect
uh what we call unhoused
folks. And
um in Gal mckinley
County, our school district
actually has unhoused
high school students.
Uh, we used to call them homeless
in the day. They were homeless,
high school students and
they'd have to find, uh,
temporary
shelters for them. And
in, in, uh,
certain cases they'd end up staying
in hotels.
I'm not sure if the school
district works that way here in
Santa Fe. What,
what happens when you
have, uh,
unhoused kids
where, where they put them or what, what
hap. I just don't know what they do in
this county, but I
do in my, in my home county,
they find hotel spaces
for them. There's
also a need for this
kind of
um,
consideration
for battered
families. I know
when our battered family
shelter in Gallup
gets filled up,
they then use hotel
vouchers, put
people in. So that's
what this bill is about. It's
a fix to what happened
in the second session
of 2020.
It was house tax and revenue
committee substitute for House
Bill 117. And
I believe that this piece
was, uh just
inadvertently picked up
and I'm here to
answer any
questions.
>> Q representative.
Uh
Let's go ahead
and um
adopt the committee
substitute
so that we can go to the audience
for um,
>> so move madam chair.
>> Ok. We have a second.
Do I have any opposition? Ok,
seeing none, we will
be discussing the committee
substitute for
House Bill 477 with
that. Let's go to the audience.
Do we have anyone in
the audience? Who'd like to speak and
support
any opposition in
the audience. Let's
go
online.
>> Ok, so we're going for
uh in support of the bill. We
have
Talia,
how you can hear
us?
We >> are
sorry, our we
had our hand raised for the next bill.
I apologize. >> No
problem, no problem at all.
Ok. Anyone hop to
speak in opposition to House Bill
477. Please raise your
hand.
>> Representative
Zamora.
>> Thank you madam chair and
thank you representative for bringing this
bill forward.
So
the timing of the bill after
30
days
will, will you still get
taxed on the 1st
30 days and
then thereafter not or
if you stay more than 30
days, you don't get taxed at all,
madam chair. Yeah, >> madam
uh madam chair representative,
you don't get taxed at all
if you're there for more than 30
days, it, the
lodger's tax portion
is removed off your bill.
>> Ok. And, and madam
chair and representative.
So lodgers tax
is something that is taxed by the
hotel.
And then
how does that money get divvied
up from their madam chair?
Representative? >> It's a,
it's a uh
lodgers tax is
imposed by the
Santa Fe and County
and the city of Santa Fe.
So the um
lodgers tax
just would not go back
into their coffers.
It's not, it doesn't affect
the state.
>> So madam chair and
representative, how does
Santa Fe and Santa uh city
of Santa Fe and Santa Fe County feel
about this. >> I don't know
madam chair representative,
I haven't heard anything out
of them uh in
any way regarding this
bill. But I do know that
uh when I was elected in
2000 and started
in 2001,
that's how the system
worked. And I, I
would imagine the thinking
is when you at
least on the legislative
side, the
amount of gross receipts
that's generated by the
activity. And
um that's happening
up in this community
by the legislative
activity more than makes
up what's happening in Lodgers
tax. That would be
my assumption. But I, I just
don't know, I haven't heard anything
from anybody on it. >> So
madam chair and representative, do we
have any kind of numbers on how much
money this could add up to
be? >> Well, what it says
madam chair representative
in the fir for
the first bill,
which I
as again, I do not
believe that it
was
properly titled.
It says Lodgers tax
exemption and it
says uh
here the occupancy
tax for fy
uh 26 is
$30,000
for Santa Fe County
and for the city of Santa Fe,
it says $30,000
but there hasn't been an updated
fiscal impact report
tied to the committee
sub. So
that's as close as I can get
here. >> And, and
madam chair and, and
uh representative,
do you think that
if IR is, is
consistent with all the
groups you just named off?
Like I would think that might
be just for legislators
madam chair representative. >> Yeah,
madam chair representative
II I would agree to, I
mean, I, as I
said before, I thought it was poorly
drafted. I'm
disappointed that there wasn't
one ounce of research done
into this when this bill was
drafted by Ledge
Council.
And um
when I went up and asked, actually
asked him to dig into
this and asked
him to point blank to
talk to the former
directors,
you know, that this was in
place. Then all of a sudden we
find the bill that
inadvertently took it
out.
So, no,
I, if you're asking me, do
I think that is
relevant? No, I don't,
but I don't think
that
um
the other groups that I
named, I don't have
a number for those either
when you're talking about fire
Eva evacuees
or when you're thinking of
um people
that would be tied to
maybe domestic violence
shelters that are filled up and
you need to put people in
hotels
or um,
like I was explaining in
my, in my home
county when we
have unhoused high
school kids,
put them in hotels.
Um So
it would be hard for me to predict
because I don't, I just don't know
>> and, and madam chair and
representative
and this just pertains to
Santa Fe County. Why would
we not do a bill that
would pertain to the whole
state of New Mexico?
>> Um You could
madam chair representative,
I think the key for this though
is is that there, it is
tied to uh
60 days of a legislative
session that brings a whole bunch of people
up here for 60
days. Um
Unfortunately, the
area has been
ravished with fires
which is unfortunate
for everybody
um that these people
would be but
in the
hotel
and
district
>> to meet
it,
>> the
you guys
listen,
>> are we ready to
go again, madam chair?
So, so
madam chair and
representative,
it still seems to me like this bill
needs a little work. If
if, if we're gonna
cover firefighters
and and all these other
uh groups
in this
bill
and just do it in Santa Fe
County.
Seems to me like the
this bill still needs a little
work. What do you, what do
you think madam chair
representative,
>> madam, chair
representative?
Um It could take
a little work. My intent though
is to correct
what happened in 2020.
It wasn't to open
up the whole
can of worm, so to speak on
this issue. It was
to fix what happened
in the second session of
2020 with
House house
Bill 117
>> and and and madam
chair
and representative.
I have some mixed emotions
about supporting it
because
our duty,
especially as
representatives, we need to
understand our duty of paying our
taxes. So
so everybody
can, all these
people can survive all these
government entities, the
city, the county.
And
I just think the bill needs to work.
I think there's a lot of issues with
this bill.
Uh I'll, I'll in the,
in my discussion there and I
look forward to the rest of the
debate and see where we go from
here. Thank you,
madam chair and thank you
representative,
>> descendant of
Luhan.
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
I don't madam
chair
representative.
So the fir in front of it
doesn't capture your
um amendments, does
it?
Thank you. I think
that's a concern for me madam chair
that we're reviewing a bill that
it's been amended, but in the
fir doesn't
capture those amendments,
um
It gives some exempt and
specifically when you're, we're looking at
the exemptions that are
modified.
Um
The, the occupancy
tax shall not apply if
ad has been a
permanent resident of the
taxable pre premises
for a period of at least
30 consecutive days,
unless those premises are temporary
lodging or enters into
an agreement for lodgers. And so
we're,
I think we need
to,
oh, I said unless thoses
are temporarily,
I think, I think we need to
consider that as we're
talking or discussing this
bill, madam chair. Also,
I'd like to um a
question for the
um
Representative Lundstrom
is.
So
prior to 2020 this was
already, this was in
place. Is that correct madam
chair? >> I'm
chair representative. Yes, it was,
it's always been in place
except for the last few
years.
>> Thank you madam chair. So this is something
that's already been in place.
Um
I don't believe there's ever
been any record of any kind of
abuse or
um concern of
corruption. Madam
chair,
>> madam chair representative.
No, there hasn't been
and candidly, I
don't know any
time that we've
had any of the local
hotels.
I'll talk negatively
about this or the chamber
or anybody else.
I've never heard of any
and and haven't received any
comments.
>> Yes. Thank you madam chair. I
really appreciate this. I think
that we're moving into a
place where we're, we're
we're looking and we should be looking at
significant issues. But the
history, the history of
this is doesn't
exemplify some of the concerns that
I'm reading about in this
fir
which
concerns me because
I am a representative here in Santa
Fe as long along
with Representatives
Pansy here and I've
never, this has
never come up for
any concern. Um
madam chair um with that.
Thank you. Thank you madam
>> chair. Thank you,
Representative Representative
Breo.
>> Oh, thank you madam chair.
Um Yeah, I was also
a little bit concerned about
the comments that were made in the
fir
um madam chair
by and representative
by the Ethics
Commission, but
having served on the Lodgers
Tax Board in
Albuquerque, um
I realize that this is really just
a benefit in,
in a sense to
help, you know, people
that are serving their
duty. Um
and we don't get a lot of
perks madam chair
serving in this
position.
Um
So I, I
just, I don't consider this a perk.
I think it's more like
a um
like a, a very
small benefit
and the tax on,
on that for
70 or
however we 100
and 40 legislators.
It doesn't seem to me like that
is a real significant
amount
that you know,
would be going into the coffers
for the Lodgers tax.
So I I
support this bill.
Thank >> you madam,
representative representative
ranking member Belan.
>> Thank you madam chair. Just a
couple of real quick questions for
you. Uh So I
just want to make sure, am I reading the same
f or the same
substitute as you?
Mine ends in
536.1.
Is that ok? Great.
So I the original
bill, it said a
member of the legislature and
it said located in the county
where the state capitol is
and I, I was trying
to find it. Maybe I am. I
gave up coffee for lent. So I
apologize, but
I'm trying to find where it says
the capital city
or, or, or Santa
Fe in the bill. And does
this apply now general
generally to the whole state?
Because I don't really see that in the
the new substitute madam
chair. >> It's a good point,
madam chair. Yes, it does.
Because when you think about the
way this substitute
is drafted, it
doesn't just necessarily
focus in on the capital
city.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair representative. So
it could be for
the whole state potentially
if it's a a state, >> you come
out to Gallup, New Mexico
and you're there for 60
days on interim
committees,
you gonna have to pay for lodgers
tax. >> Oh, good. Ok. Thank you
madam chair. That's pretty much all I all I
had to wonder
about this bill. So I'm sure the
fiscal impact could, could
vary then when
it comes to that, >> I think it could. But,
but when you really think about
it, it's I, I
believe madam chair and I've been
here a long time that if the
fiscal impact was
rippling to
the industry, we
would hear about
that.
>> Thank you madam chair. That's pretty much all I
had. And thank you again
representative and I can't wait
to see you in the interim in Gallup.
Maybe not for 60 days, but
maybe a week. That would be fine.
Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you representative.
Before I call the question,
I would like to say
that I
uh you know, I travel here from
Gallup and
I have stayed in a hotel
for more than 60 days.
And ladies and gentlemen,
with our piem, I went home in
the red every year
for many years.
And
uh I
did receive
the, um, the
discount on the tax
in the past when I've stayed at the
hotel for 30 days
and beyond. And
there were no complaints.
The hotels were very
um cordial
and I didn't hear any
complaints from anybody.
So with that
representative, um I'll
call the
question.
Representative Brega >> just wanted
to make a motion for to
pass on house Bill
five
477.
>> Yes, >> it's on
the original bill and a due
pass for the
committee
substitute.
>> So we have a motion
for a due pass
on house government elections.
A do not pass on
house government elections and Indian
Affairs.
They do not pass on House
Bill 477
and they do pass on house
government elections and Indian Affairs
Committee substitute for House
Bill 477 and a second
by Representative Anya Nou.
Please call roll
>> representative Aaru
representative block. Yes.
Representative Puo.
Yes, representative
Lujan. Yes, representative
Mejia.
Yes madam
floor leader,
Representative
Zamora.
Yes madam, vice chair
madam chair
madam chair by vote of 7 to 0.
You have a due pass
representative
for
>> ok committee members, if
you don't mind,
I'd like to um
hear HJR 11
because I see our senator
in the room
and SJR
11.
>> Thank you madam chair. I was just
texting the Secretary of State's
office. To say I was gonna have
to leave. Um
Thank you madam chair, thank you
committee members for the
opportunity to present
um House Joint Resolution
11. I do want to
thank my cosponsor,
um Senator David
Gallego's former
representative, as
well as Representative
Gail Armstrong
for supporting this
bill. All three of us
are former school board
members and so this
bill uh we recognize
as being very important
if you look at the bill.
Um,
oh, I picked the wrong
one. If you look at the
bill, the only thing
that we're taking out this
is a, a constitutional
amendment is
thank you.
Representative
is to the
eliminate one sentence.
All school elections shall
be held at different times
for from partisan
elections. School
board elections
historically have always
been separate from other
elections.
And the reason for this is
that school
elections were the only
elections that women were
authorized to vote
in. And so I
jokingly say when our
constitution was
adopted. Um
and maybe it's true, maybe it's
not. But um
elections for school
were held at different times
to make sure that we didn't inadvertently
vote for governor or representative
or senator or something we weren't
allowed to vote for.
So what this does
as you know, we've taken
away um
school board
elections from
being at a
different time by
mixing them in with the
local election.
But local elections which
will happen this year in
November is just a
consolidation of
nonpartisan Oh, there
you are. Thank you.
Um, nonpartisan
elections.
The challenge is that
school districts are facing
is that if you
have a bond question
that you need during
a general election
period, you
have to do it as a special
election. You cannot be on the
general election
and that special election
right now, Espanola
and at least four other
districts maybe five
have to do a special election
because they have a bond question
that timely needs to
be asked. It's
going to cost about 100
and $75,000
for them to do that
bond question because
it's all male
and because it's separate
from a, from a regular
election. So for
that reason, we're looking
to strike that um
I would like to give my expert
witness an opportunity
to say something and then
we'll stand for questions, madam
chair.
>> Good morning madam, chair members of
the committee. It's good
to see you all again.
Um I just wanted
to uh to
say that we are really grateful
for the sponsor for bringing this
forward. She does an
excellent job explaining
um the impact of the
change to the constitution
on school board um
ballot questions
and, and school
board elections. But I did
just want to highlight and
be very clear
that um the
members of a school board would
still be elected at the
regular local election.
And the change
does not compel the
districts to
put their ballot questions
on a general election ballot.
So it just gives them
another option
um which is already
afforded to all of the
other local public bodies
in a regular
local election. So
municipalities,
water districts, they
can pick between the
regular local election,
special election and a
general election ballot.
Um um
and, and consider those as
options for their
ballot questions. School
boards are the only ones that
cannot put them on the general
election ballot currently.
So this change to the
constitution would bring them in
alignment with the rest of the local
public
bodies.
>> We should stand for questions,
madam. >> Thank you,
Senator. Ok,
let's go to the audience.
Do we have any comments
and support?
Do we have any opposition?
Let's go
online
>> and hoping to take a comments
and support here. Really? We
have Richard Mason.
Richard. Can you hear
us?
>> Yes, madam, chair members of the
committee. Good morning. My
name is Dick Mason. I'm
the voting election director
for the League of Women. Voters of New
Mexico. The league
stands in strong support
of Senate joint resolution
11. Based
upon the following league
position, the league
supports the consolidation of
elections in New
Mexico.
We do so because it increases
voter turnout.
Additionally, when all bond
issues are on the same
ballot, the voters can see all
of their choices in front of
them.
Finally, SJR
11 if passed by the
voters will eliminate
one of the last constitutional
vestiges of the dock
period when women did not
have full suffrage.
The league wants to thank the
sponsors and the Secretary
of state for bringing this
forward and ask the committee
to give SJR
one a due pass.
Thank you. >> Thank you
so much, Richard.
Anyone hoping to make any public
comment in opposition to the bill, please
raise your
hand.
>> Committee
members,
Zib Zamora, madam
chair Mova Dupe.
We have a motion for due pass
by Representative Zamora second
by Representative Anun Nou. Do
we have any opposition?
Seeing none do
pass. >> Thank you
madam chair. Thank you. Members of the
committee
>> representative
Dow. Are you still
in the
room?
So let's
do house bill
468.
>> Ok.
Thank you. Representative.
Um and the
bill was rolled and it
um as I mentioned,
um being the
newbie, you can come
into a room
and think you have the greatest
idea in the world. And as it
goes through the committee process, you learn
that it can be made even better
and that's what this committee did.
There are no substantive change. There are no
changes to to the bill.
What it does is it applies
a the same standard
to retire
a um a state
flag that is no
longer in shape to be
um flown um
and retired in the same manner as
the US flag. Um
As I mentioned previously, this
was brought to me um
by one of my constituents,
girl scout Adrian
V Hill of Troop
18044
girl scouts of the desert
Southwest. And I
believe she's, um,
has called in, in
support. And so I, I think
I'll leave the story to
her. Um We've
also been in close
contact with a Zia pueblo
and I believe the governor has also
called in to, to talk about,
uh, his support for this bill.
So, uh, thank you,
uh, um, madam chair and
committee. >> Thank you,
representative. Let's go
online and hear from
the governor if he's
available,
Governor Pino,
uh, you could, if you could please
raise your hand so we can hear your public
comment. Oh, here
we go. I think I see
him.
Ok.
Hi, Governor Pino. Can you hear
us?
Can you hear us?
We sure can.
Ok. Um,
my name is, uh
Lamber Pino. I'm the, uh,
appointed governor from the
Pueblo of Zia.
Um,
when we were
at notified
on this bill,
uh, we went
and sat down
with our, I sat
down with my lieutenant
governor, um, the tribal
administration
and, uh, by
temple. So,
um, we're in support of the
bill. I just want to
thank the young lady
that brought it to
the representative
attention.
Thank you.
Do you so much, Governor
Pino
and then we also had
Adria Martinez,
Adrian, uh
Adrian,
Adrian, Adrian, you hear
us?
Let's go to um let's
go ahead and go to public
comment in the audience.
Those in support, please raise your
hands. Uh
Any opposition,
let's go back on the for
support of our opposition.
Anyone hoping to make uh any
public comment in support of the bill,
please raise your hand.
We still have Adrian here,
Adrian, Adrian
here.
OK. We're gonna move on. So we
also have uh someone under
CMG. Can you hear
us?
OK, like we,
that's it
members.
Representative Luhan and
>> madam chair, quick
question.
Um She
sent me her statement and I have permission
to read it.
Thank you.
Um
Adrianne BLL
Martinez, I
mentioned her girl scout troop at
age five. She attended many
ceremonies with Boy Scouts of
America civic events where the
American flag was lowered and
retired with great honor and
dignity and no
such honor of retirement was awarded
in New Mexico flag with the Zia
symbol. When it came, came
time for her to select a project
to earn the highest award
award in girl scouts.
She selected a process
of how to pay honor and
dignity to the new
Mexico State flag in our
honored Pueblo Zia
Cymbal.
This is a, a little gratuitous
and self-serving. I'm sorry. Uh
She believes in eagle
scouts such as state Representative
Mark Murphy should assist her in
achieving a law to honor.
Not only the great state of New Mexico,
but the flag of New Mexico bearing
the Pueblo Zia. She
spent hours over the past year
researching uh
the history of New Mexico and the
flag. Thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Lujan.
I move a due pass
manager
represent a
BREO
madam chair and uh
representatives.
Um Just a quick question
about the military.
Is this the same manner in which
they would um dispose
of the flag as well,
>> madam. Chair representative? Yes, it is.
It is. >> Ok. Thank
you.
Ok. We have a motion for due
pass by Representative
Luhan and a second by
Representative Zamora. Do we have any
opposition?
Seeing none? You have a due
pass
move along to House Bill
405.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you,
committee um
House Bill 405.
is generally a bill
allowing job protection
for our volunteer firefighters.
Um The bill essentially
provides up to
100 and 12
hours of
protected leave
for training purposes
and it provides up to 100 and
12 hours of protected
leave for what is defined
as active
service um
time.
Um And that's
just essentially it. Um
coming from, you know, my
community um
protecting our volunteer
firefighters has been a
definite priority for
me. Um In the County of
San Miguel, we are entirely
dependent upon volunteer
fire. Um When
you're responding to emergencies in these
areas, um
Volunteer fire personnel
are the ones that are responding to
our emergencies.
There's been a significant
decline in
volunteer
recruitment,
retention, um
personnel throughout our
state. Um
Right now in our county
alone, we
are down over 50%
over the last few years due to COVID
due to fires due to
whatnot. Um
And looking at ways of how we can
support this very critical
public safety piece
um to continue to
protect our
communities. Um
So with that, I do stand for
questions.
>> You, let's go to the audience.
Those in support. Please raise your
hands. Those
in opposition. Let's
go online.
Anyone hoping to make a public
comment in support of the bill, please raise
your hand.
Anyone hoping to make a a public
comment in opposition to the bill, please
raise your hand.
See, no committee
members,
Representative
Breco
Madam chair, I'd like to make a
motion for
approval of House Bill
405. I'll second
that we have a motion
for a due pass by
Representative
breo a second by
ranking member block. Do
we have any opposition?
Seeing none? You have a due
pass,
Brady House
Bill
518.
Ok. You may begin.
>> Thank you madam chair. Good morning
committee members. Glad to see you
this morning. Um I have in
front of you today, House Bill
518, which
is LGBT Q plus day.
Um This is essentially
a day of observance
every 60 day session,
the fourth Tuesday of each
January and this
is right alongside
african-american Day, Hispanic
Culture Day. AAA Api
native Hawaiian day.
And it's actually
during a Api uh
native Hawaiian day that
um madam leader
actually said something that really
stuck with me. She said, oh, it's
so amazing to see
so many leaders from our
community here and
represented.
And I remember looking up and
going, oh,
I wish I knew of LGBT
Q members who were leaders and
that they were highlighted. And
so that was sort of the impetus
for this bill. Madam chair and committee
members. Um
I remember being a young person looking
for examples of
queer folks. And
um so madam chair
members of the committee a couple of
facts before I will hand
it back over to you all. But um
young LGBT Q people are
of course committing suicide at a
rate that far surpasses our
straight counterparts.
Um The life expectancy
for LGBT Q,
New Mexicans.
Um Our average age is
37.7 years
versus non LGBT Q
counterparts is actually
49 years
old. Um So that's
quite a difference, madam, chair, committee
members. So the purpose of
this bill is to
celebrate what we have and
who we have while we have
them. And with that madam Cheryl
stand for questions.
>> OK, let's go to the audience.
Those uh please raise
your hands if you'd like to make a
comment and
support.
OK. We'll take
51 minute,
please.
>> Mm. Oh
OK. Uh Hello
madam, chair and committee.
My name is Karen Chavez.
And as a
woman who is
works in the roundhouse and
is married to another
woman working in the
roundhouse. I would
love to come to work during future
sessions and see the complete
inclusivity
and celebration of queerness,
offering a safe space for
all. Let's show everyone
how supportive New Mexico is
and pass
HBIT
>> chair members of the committee. My name
is Isa Viran.
I'm here with equality. New Mexico
and we stand in support of HB
518, New
Mexico has been a minority majority
state since its inception.
We have always been an inclusive
haven and fiercely protected our
diverse communities. It's our
duty to show support to our
LGBT Q community,
especially in times like this
in these challenging moments when minority
communities face increasing threats
and discrimination. It's crucial
that we stand united in
the face of adversity. By
passing this bill, we send a clear message
that New Mexico values and celebrates
its LGBT Q plus community
just as we do all our diverse
communities as we face
national debates that often seek to
marginalize us. We now
more than ever have an
opportunity to lead. By
example, we can show that
embracing diversity and supporting
all our residents, regardless of
orientation or gender identity,
makes a stronger state.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam, chair members
of the committee. My name is
Alicia Crea. I'm from the Pueblo
Santo Domingo and a
registered lobbyist for NM. Need
to vote. I help
to run a uh the need of
Power Building Center in Albuquerque,
which helps to serve
our youth and as well as our
need of Youth Organizing
Council and
our youth have, you know,
repeatedly
have shared
that
acceptance of our LGBT
Q two spirit plus
relatives is a form of harm
reduction. And I think
that, you know, accepting this
at the state level
would definitely
increase
our, our um community members and
ultimately, our family members.
Ultimately, we always
do it for our family. Thank
you,
>> chair and members of the committee. My
name is Kath Sanchez. I'm
the policy director for Bold
Futures. We are a reproductive
justice organization
and why would a reproductive justice
organization be here at the table
for this? One of the
pieces of the framework
of reproductive justice
is the recognition of the intersection
of our identities.
We appreciate the uh
legislator uh
Representative Anaya for bringing
this forward and understanding
just how important it is for
us to center, not just black
indigenous women and people of
color, but LGBT
Q folks who have
not just helped the state
grow but are also
out legislators
currently in in the
session. Thank you. We support
this
bill.
>> OK, let's go online.
We'll take two in
support, one
minute,
speaking and support. I believe
we have Liam Liam. Can you hear
us? Yes,
great. You have one
minute.
>> Good morning. Um
Chair committee. My name is
Liam Simplicio. I am from the
Pueblo of Zuni I
would first like to express my
appreciation for allowing me
to comment on this effort
to recognize the LGBT
Plus community.
Um I believe this is a great
opportunity to shine a light
on a topic that has been a
very controversial but
also very important one to
many people.
As a member of the LGBT
community, I am fortunate to
have not experienced the hardships
that past generations have
endured to that.
I am very grateful and proud of
the people that have came before me
to fight oppressive
barriers, the ability
to push forward, speak out
and fight for rights as a
marginalized community is
one reason to support this
effort for rec
um
um um
recognition.
Um while through
winning efforts made from past
generations, this does not
mean that all is one
today, generations
from uh the
present and future
generations have still have
challenges to overcome.
I myself working
with the youth within
my community have seen
so many. What was
that? >> Thank you so much.
I'm sorry. Thank
you.
All right, we're gonna move on to Daniel,
Daniel Williams. Can you hear
us? >> Good
morning? Thank you madam,
chair and members of the committee.
My name is Daniel Williams.
I'm a policy advocate at the
American Civil Liberties Union of
New Mexico.
The AC Lu supports
this bill. The AC Lu
has been a advocate
for the full inclusion and justice
for our LGBT Q community in
New Mexico and around the country
for many years.
And we're grateful for the
work that this legislature has done
to make New Mexico one of the safest
place places in the
country for queer folks. And I
also want to say
on a personal note as
a gay man as a member of the LGBT
Q community growing
up in Raton,
New Mexico, thinking
about having
a half dozen
openly
LGBT Q members of the
legislature, thinking
about our legislature celebrating
our community would have been
unthinkable for me as a kid
and it would have
probably changed a lot of the way that
I view myself. So not
only do I think you young
Daniel? Thank you as well. And
we support this bill.
Thanks
>> you so much, Daniel.
That's it. >> Um
Can you double check?
>> Yeah, >> we
uh
no more. Hold
on.
We need to take a little
pause. We understand
that the webcast is not
working
or maybe it was from the
past and it's
fixed.
Maybe it was for me
yesterday.
>> The
that
breakfast
I want brunch on
Sunday.
Ok,
>> but I >> thought you liked those
record.
Yeah.
Oh,
>> ok. Let's go back to the
audience. Uh Do
we have any comments in
opposition
seeing? No, let's go
online.
>> Anyone hoping to make comments in
support of the Bill, please raise
your hand. We have
Charles. 000,
sorry. And
so we're moving to uh people
hoping to speak in opposition to the
bill. Uh Charles,
were you hoping to speak in opposition to house
the House?
Bill
Charles? Can you hear
us?
>> Ok,
>> committee
members,
representative
block
>> madam, chair representative and I know we
talked about this bill a little bit before
I did. I still have some
concerns with the
language. And
so I'm one
of these people who's maybe I'm a little
too traditional. I
mean, I'm, I'm one
of the first openly gay members of this
legislature, but
I'm not
good. Well, I'm, I'm just not a fan of the
keyword in the bill. I still
find it to be a slur
and some of my constituents do
too. And you know,
I we've all been called
that if we're part of
this community, unfortunately,
and it wasn't fun for us.
And so
I'm, I'm not one of these people who's like,
let's, let's be empowered and
reclaim a word. It's kind of like
reclaiming the f the other F
word that would
go to people like us
or the
N word for people who
are Black and African American.
So can you can you just give me a
little bit more information about that. I'm
just, I do have a little heartburn when
it comes to enshrining
in state statute
blurs. >> Thank
you madam
chair and representative for bringing up. I
know we spoke about this before.
Um I think one of the
pieces of this is, you
know, it's hard to enshrine
anything in law, especially
with our LGBT Q community
because it is ever-changing.
Um But I will say madam chair and
representative um
from a personal note, I consider
myself queer. And
so I as
somebody who's bringing this bill forward
would really like to see myself represented
in this. And I know that there
are folks from our community who
absolutely identify with this.
Um I also know
that a lot of in our
community, specifically,
those who are of
an older generation actually
don't agree with a lot of these
and they just still call themselves
gay. And to me, it was about
being as inclusive as
possible, knowing that
these honestly like
change very often. It's
actually really hard for me to not
just use the
um originally we wanted
to use just a acronym
LGBT Q plus. Um
But unfortunately, in drafting, we
can't use that. And so
we had to spell it out. And
so madam chair representative
to your point, we really wanted to use
LGBT Q plus because we feel that
that is actually a lot more inclusive
than listing. Um
But madam chair representative. We came
to an issue in drafting.
>> Thank you madam chair representative. And my other
question quickly was the,
I'm guessing you can't put the word
pl us in statute.
So it had to be expansive. Could you
go into that for me? That's >> exactly
it, madam chair representative. Uh
We could not put a plus line
in there and we use the word
expansive um to
help cover that.
>> Thank you madam chair representative. Yeah, I
still have some concerns about that
key word in there, but
I don't know, I'll, I'll listen to the debate.
Thank you. >> Thank
you. Representative
Luhan stepped
out.
Representative.
>> Yeah. Um Madam chair
and representative, it is
only during uh it's
only a celebration for
the legislative session
and so it's not for the entire
state. Um This is
in the same section of the law as
um other statewide
celebrations, but this is just
for the legislature.
Um I've
also had questions asking why
this particular day it's because it
was open.
So madam chair
representative, it is one of the days that is
open during a 60 day
legislative
session.
>> Zanon of Luhan, who would you
pass?
I have a motion for to
pass by
Representative
Wan and a second by
Representative Anan Oru. Please
cover
oh, by a madam floor
leader.
>> Is that on your No
representative block? No,
Representative Borrego.
Yes, Representative
Lujan.
Yes. Representative
Miia, no,
represent Madam
Floyd.
Yes. Representative
Zamora. No
madam Vice chair madam
chair,
madam chair by by
5 to 3 vote. We have a due
pass. >> Thank
you, madam, chair representative.
>> Ok. Let's move along
to house Memorial for
two.
>> Mm.
Um
>> It's just too bad. We can't get
it. I ask him for a
picture.
Here's a picture of the
critter which I've never seen
in my
life.
>> Thank
you.
>> Did you bring a
critter
madam chair? Did >> we bring a possum?
You shouldn't. We
asked everybody for a live
possum and nobody would bring us
one.
>> OK. You may
begin.
>> Thank you so much madam chair and
representative. So I'll give
you a little background on the, the
thought process behind this
bill. So we were thinking
of because other states,
there's New Hampshire and
a few other states that are trying to
pass
bills to
create a state
marsupial
and in
the world, there are lots of
marsupials and there are a lot of
possums. And
so the,
the Delphis
Virginiana,
which is the, it's called the
Virginia possum
is the only
marsupial native to North
America
and uh madam chair.
That's one of the big reasons that we brought
this forward to bring some awareness to
it and to, to have a discussion today
about, about how important this
species actually is
to our state and to our
country. And
so when we're coming,
when we're talking about
the Virginia possum, it's
actually kind of a
misnomer because that's where the
first place is that they saw
it when settlers
came to the
Americas. But
the word actually comes from a
poet on um
word in Algonquian,
which means white dog or
dog like beast.
And so this, this
animal which
is very cool by the
way. And we'll, we'll talk about some facts
about this animal. But
there's a lot of folklore,
a lot of uh
origin stories that have been
in the past. So for
example, the Cherokee nation, they
have a,
a little bit of
a origin story. And
according to the origin story, the possum's
tail became
bare due to a trick
played on it by a jealous
rabbit and a cunning
cricket. So there's
a lot of, a lot of lure to
this, this animal. But
other than just its really
coolness, it also
contributes to our
ecosystem when it comes
to protecting us
from certain things. So
I'm just gonna go a little bit into
that. For example,
it's natural pest
control. They consume
large quantities of ticks,
insects, rodents and other
pests that could otherwise
harm human and animal
populations. They
also eat overripe fruit,
making them nature's cleanup
tools.
They are disease
resistant. They have a really low
body temperature. So they
do not carry rabies like
other other animals do
that are also rodents.
Uh Furthermore, snake
bite immunity, uh they're
immune to snake venom and it
helps to control snake
populations like
here in New Mexico with these
uh Diamondback snakes.
And actually there was a study from San
Jose University in California
that isolated the peptide
in possum blood
that causes resistance
against snake venom. And
researchers have expressed optimism
that finding this could
help create more accessible
antivenom for people around the
world. So this this
species is super adaptable
and it has a really cool
storied history in New Mexico.
There's so much awesome
details that I would love to share with
you guys, but I know that we are crunched
for time. So I'm just gonna throw it
over to Representative Lord
>> and Madam chair. I was very disappointed
that you didn't say awesome
possum
stories.
I just have lived experience. I thought it
was a great idea. We were talking on the phone
and we realized we didn't have a state
marsupial. And I have
lived experience with a friend of mine that
had one and they're just awesome. They
make them, they found
one that was a baby, kept it and
they're just sweet and loving
and tender, not like you would think they're not
scary at all. They're just amazing animals.
So that's all I bring to the table is
that we need a state marsupial
and this is the
only one we have in North America.
Thank you madam chair.
>> Let's go to the audience.
Do we have anyone in
support?
Do we have any opposition?
Let's go online real
quick.
>> Anyone hoping to make public comment in
support of the bill, please raise your
hand.
Right. We have one,
Amy Garcia. Can you hear
us?
>> Hi, I can hear you. Can you hear
me? >> We sure can
you have one minute Amy? >> Yeah.
No, I just had a question. Um I
didn't hear that any other
state had the
same
um, animal
is
um,
>> sorry, this is unfortunately not a
question portion. We were just hoping to
hear public comment in support
or in opposition to the >> bill. Yeah. No,
I can't, I can't support it because I didn't
understand if, if other
states had the same
animal >> got you.
Ok. Thank you so much,
Amy.
All right. Was there anyone who was hoping
to make any public comment in opposition
to the
bill
>> committee members?
Representative Zamora?
Thank >> you, madam Chair.
Where, where do we find
if this animal is native to
New Mexico?
>> Thank you, madam chair Representative. Actually,
interesting story. It's
native to the entire
country. But there are
sightings. I I looked at a
study from the
Southwester Naturalist
which was published in 1995
which is a peer-reviewed
study on these marsupials.
And they have seen
them migrating toward
this part of the country
for a very long time. It started
in the late um
or the early 20th
century when large
amounts of them started, started
coming in here. But
we see according to
this study which I
kind of written
down in a really small way. So
I didn't have to like write
and tell you about the entire
study. Um It was first
reported then
and it, it's in the southeastern
portion of the state and
then by the fifties, records
of the species expanded
uh with documentation
proving their presence in the Rio
Grande Valley, Rio Grande
Valley near Belen, as well
as Bernalillo Quake
counties. They also have observations
placed in diverse locations
including Animas Mountains,
Hidalgo County, Simran, uh
River Valley and
Union County.
And then some, some
other researchers,
pardon me, trying to get that word
out. Researchers quite an interesting
word, speculated that Central New
Mexico's possum population
or opossum population
was introduced while
others like other
researchers, they suggest a natural
range expansion from the Texas
Panhandle. So
that and other,
there was a question earlier from
somebody about if this
was the only state with
this marsupial, it's all
across the country.
But specifically regarding
New Mexico with
these snake populations,
it it does help alleviate
some of those concerns with those,
which is why it's so important to our
state particularly. >> And madam
chair representative, if you go online, there
are actual pest removal
places for possums in Berlow
County because we do have possums
in Burlew County
>> and madam Chern and
Representative Lord,
are you saying that, that there's
a pest removal to remove the
possums?
>> Um because there's madam
speaker and and and representative,
there's a lot of people that are afraid of them
because they hiss and they're actually
very sweet and very gentle
people get or they don't want
them on their property. So they move them to
other locations just
like they do with every other.
>> And madam chair and, and
representatives, I have a
possum story to tell
you. >> Ok.
Here we go. Thank you madam
chair. Excited to hear
this. >> So I was
working on a
and
the owner of the farm
had a
oil house
and he went in the warehouse
one day and there was a possum
in there
and he was mad. Awesome,
was upset
and we
didn't know what
this was. We
never seen one before
and we needed
to get to the plumbing because there were
some issues with the, well and
stuff.
The possum wound up at the
county agent
and
he told us
that he,
he, he defined
what the animal
was.
And then he told us
that the possums weren't
native,
that part of the country which we're in.
Clovis. So maybe
in the way you described it in, in
New Mexico, maybe they're
not. But he, what
the story he told us
is we,
we wondered how it got there
and he said, well, maybe it
jumped on the train
back east somewhere
and then it unloaded here
somehow.
So, so maybe
this was a foreign possum.
I don't know
but
>> Mr Speaker representative that that
is an amazing story of the
hitchhiking possum.
Um
What we're trying to do is bring
awareness that they are here
and hopefully less people
will harm them and realize that they're
part of our society
and that we're just here for
uh possum
equality, >> madam chair.
And also I would love to add to that.
There are other species
of possums or
opossums. However, you
prefer to say it, it was,
it was Americanized from the
opossum before. It's now
just possum because it's way easier to
say. But there's
a lot of them in South,
south of us, in Mexico, parts
of South Central America,
there are possums
that four eyed possums.
They actually don't have four eyes. They just
have little, little white dots that's above
their eyes, which makes it look like they have
four eyes and they're down in
Guana
and in
no northern of Raz, we
also have some water
possums in Costa Rica
and actually the possum,
it usually tries to find a
home near a water source.
So it'll try to usually
find a place which is why it's in
the Rio Grande Valley because
they see the, the river and they
have access to all those bugs,
ticks, etcetera, and also the
snakes so they can help
hone that population.
So it's, it's really
cool. And I I didn't really know as
much about this until I started researching
it. And I feel like
in the next couple of sessions, we will be
bringing forward legislation
to make this the state
marsupial
>> madam chair. I
think this could be a three
hour debate. What time we
do on the floor
>> madam chair and I really wish
that it wouldn't
>> madam chair.
Uh That
concludes my >> question.
Thank you, Representative Lujan.
Thank you >> madam chair. Um
Do we have any other marsupials
in the North state
>> chair? Representative? We
don't,
this is the only one
native to the
Americans
and maybe, maybe people
madam chair may
have ship
some in as pets
potentially, but the
only ones that actually are roaming
free in the country who
are not pets,
for example, although people
do have pet possums like
like Representative Lord's
friend,
>> madam chair um
representatives.
Um are they an endangered
species.
>> Thank you, madam chair representative.
Currently they're
not, but
there are not. The, the
population varies
because usually when a
possum has babies
and what makes it a marsupial
is it keeps the babies in a little
pouch. So usually
about half the litter
survives.
Traditionally, it's about 70
babies that are usually born,
about half the litter survives. So
it is quite a survivalist
species. And then after
three or four months, they will leave
the mother's pouch and then they'll, they'll have
their own cycles of their own
and start new families.
And, and when they're babies, they're
actually only about the size of a bee
each little baby
possum. So it's, it's
just a really cool species.
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
I'm I'm asking these questions
because my daughter was brought
to my attention
that uh the
possums, opossums
uh that there is a, there
is a, some kind of diseases
affecting them in their population.
Are you aware of that madam
chair? >> Thank you
madam chair representative. So
in my research, I did not really
go deep into that, but if that
is the case, then
we certainly should bring awareness to
it. >> Thank you madam chair.
And I, that's why
I'm I'm grateful that you're bringing this
forward so that when you have this uh
expanded conversation and
really kind of dive into
the um
you know, the, these other scientific
um
issues around our, our
animal populations. And,
you know, as our kids are in school
learning about all these different
animals. This,
this spikes their attention,
especially, you know, as
we as legis legislators are paying
attention to them. And
so I, I appreciate you bringing
this forward so we can forward. I
didn't know that we,
this was the only marsupial
um we have in our state
or native to our state
if, if you will.
Um I think it's cool. I love
marsupials. I,
you know, my, my daughter
and her friends love marsupials
and she wants to go to Australia
because of the
indigenous population of
marsupials in Austria's
kangaroos and
other animals.
So um
so madam madam
chair uh
representative. So this
would be a specific classification
as the
um the state
marsupial. Is that correct madam
chair? >> Thank
you madam, chair representative. Yes, that's correct.
Currently North Carolina
is the only state that has a state
marsupial, which is
the Delphis,
Virginiana. And then
in New Hampshire, they're
trying to pass legislation to
make it their states. So I
would love to beat New
Hampshire. So
not, not hoping that they don't pass
theirs, but if
we have to be third, we'll be third,
but it's gonna happen, madam, >> chair.
Thank you madam, chair
representatives. Um
I hope our wild friends out there
are listening and maybe they
can, you can bring him into the
conversation and other groups like
that. Thank you, madam
chair,
>> Zano Breo. >> Thank
you madam chair. I will
support your legislation.
But because I think it begs the
question about marsupials
in our state. But there
are, uh Tasmanian
devils as well
and we had one at
the bio
park not that long
ago that died
and you might want to take a look at that.
But um Tasmanian
devils are also marsupial
animals and
they do exist in,
in the country and in New
Mexico. So I just
thought I'd point that out
because I think that this,
you know, it really begs the
question of, I mean,
the only time I ever heard about a
possum was when I
watched the
Beverly Hillbillies and
granny always wanted to
talk about her
possum. So,
I mean,
I just thought I'd raise that question,
that issue.
Um but madam
chair, I, you know, I do support
it. I just think that we, you
know, we should be looking at all of our
marsupials
across the state because
I don't think this is the only
one. So I'll just point
that out. Thank you >> madam
chair representative. Yes, we do not want
to address uh possum stew at all
in this conversation. Thank
you,
>> Representative. Anya
Nou.
>> Next, >> if
you don't pass this bill, I will
eat >> those
critters
and for the love of God madam chair, I
move it too
fast.
We have a motion for you passed
by Representative Aaru a
second by Representative Luhan.
Do we have any opposition
seeing that you have
a on house memorial?
Thank >> you madam chair. Thank
you all. And I wore my lucky
possum tie today. So
I got my
little my
possum
on our desk. We're very
possum.
No possum stew though, madam
chair.
>> All right.
Do we have
presenters for House Bill?
427.
How about House
Bill?
438.
>> Um Good morning
madam chair.
Um
um To
today we were, I'm
losing my voice hang. I'm gonna
grab my
drink.
The allergies are getting to me, madam
chair members, excuse
me. Um
So today we're
presenting um
House Bill
um 438.
But we have a committee substitute
in front of you
today
that
his manager, it's
231413.1
should
be
>> ok.
Move it for discussion
>> mature you. We have
a motion to move for
discussion. One
second, please discuss the committee
substitute
>> chair and
my um expert
witness today is uh
Santa Fe county clerk
Kathryn Clark.
And
so the the bill by the
title of bills relating to employee
benefits requiring employees
of the state and political
subdivisions of the state to
be provided an
opportunity to exchange
unused
compense uh compensatory
leave for compensation
at least twice
each year, madam chair.
So
the substitute proposes
changes to comp
compensatory
leave policies for state
political subdivision
employees in New Mexico. The original
bill mandated
uh annual payouts for unused
compensatory leave
while the substi substitute
bill requires employees
to be given
the opportunity to exchange
unused compensations or
leave for
monetary compensation
at least twice a year. Both
versions aim to improve
the employee benefits but
raise. Um but
and also talk about the
the significant
fiscal administrative
and operational concerns.
Thank you
mentioned.
>> Hey, we
are ready for public
comment. Those in support.
>> May I have my expert?
Have a couple of words, madam chair.
Thank you. >> Yes.
Thank you madam chair, members of the
committee. Um We made
these changes based on feedback.
Um The idea
was that previously um
they would have to mandatorily
roll over their um
compensatory hours
into a fiscal payout.
In this way,
the um worker can
now choose whether or not
they get a payout.
Um And then they have an opportunity to do
that twice a year. So it's giving more
flexibility to the workers.
Thank you.
>> OK, let's go
to the
audience for a
comment. And
support.
Ok,
>> madam chair members of the Committee Carter
Bundy with, ask me, we want to thank the
sponsor and the expert for bringing
this. This is something that really
does add some flexibility
and make sure that when workers
are working those extra hours,
they're ultimately compensated
for it. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, madam, chair members
of the committee, John Lipshutz with the
new Mexico Federation of Labor,
uh representing all
40,000 plus of our workers
across the state. We uh
again, thank the sponsor
for bringing this up and believe that this
bill is, is necessary
for uh proper treatment
of our workers. A workers. Thank
you.
>> Ok, let's go online.
Do we have any comments and
support anyone? Hoping to
make any comments? Support, please raise
your hand. Looks like we have a Lindsay
Hurst here. Lindsay. Can you hear
us?
>> Yes, I can. Can you hear
me? >> We can you
have one minute Lindsay?
>> Ok, madam chair and committee.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak
and thank you to the sponsors for bringing
this bill forward. My name is Lindsay
Hurst. I'm currently serving as
executive vice president for
CW, a local
7076
and a state employee.
Our union represents state
employees at 13 agencies.
About 2700 positions,
27% of
which are vacant due
to high rates for years.
State employees are being tasked with
additional job duties to
cover vacant critical positions
to meet program needs
and as a result are
accruing compensatory
time in excess
of accrual limitations.
This means that some employees
are not getting
compensated by
leave or uh
by um
compensation uh
for the hours worked.
This issue is impacting our
hardest working and most
dedicated employees,
frequently employees are unable
to utilize a crude comp time
as leave because
management is unable or
unwilling to grant the leave due to
coverage issues resulting
from high vacancy rates. The
biannual payout will allow
employees and program
scheduling flexibility
and reduce the amount of comp time
liability that is being carried
by our agencies.
Please pass house bill 438.
Thank you. >> Thank you
so much. Lindsay.
Anyone hoping to make public comment in
opposition to the bill, please
raise your hand.
No. Hey, let's
go back to the audience to
any opposition.
Ok, one minute,
please.
Oh, >> Mark Allen.
General Counsel for New Mexico Counties.
New Mexico Counties is not taking a
position on this yet. They will
tomorrow at the board meeting will
be given the opportunity. I'm
expressing my concerns.
This will have a fiscal
impact on local
governments specifically
counties. Uh comp
time is governed by the Fair Labor
Standards Act. It's
capped for the first
responders at 480
hours and all other employees
at 240 hours,
they're allowed to take that time
unless it would be unduly disruptive.
It's accrued at time and a
half and all
of it is paid
out. Um The there's
no opportunity for the counties to
not pay out that money.
Another important feature
is fl a
the Fair Labor Standards Act was not
applicable to local
governments until 1985.
Based on the Supreme Court
decision, after
that decision, Labor and the
National Association of Counties
and the national uh the uh
the league of,
of national cities
re reached an
agreement.
>> Any other comments in
opposition in the
audience? Ok.
Seeing none.
Um I'll move
to adopt the committee
substitute.
We have a second madam
chair. So let me
ask a question.
The sub that we have
in our binder is a House
Labor veterans and
military oh
affairs substitute. Is there
another substitute
or was the
substitute already
>> madam chair? I I stand
corrected. There was supposed,
we were working on something
and it didn't get here on time.
So this is just said before
us. Thank
you
to adopt the. So
thank you madam chair.
>> Ok. Thank you
for that
verification.
That was very confusing.
Ok, committee
members,
Bennet Block.
>> Thank you madam chair representative.
So a couple of quick questions
for you.
I see that this will cost
18 million
and
this is about 6 million in
related costs. Is this based
upon the current
uh committee Substitute
from Labor or is
that fir
based on the original
bill? I'm just trying to >> clarify. I
believe this was based on the original
bill.
>> Thank you madam chair and
representative and then also
how, how does this
new change
affect any collective
bargaining agreements?
Can you just go into that a little bit for me?
Thank you, >> madam
Chair
Representative Block.
Um The
it already states in the bill that it's
not going to affect any uh collective
bargaining in section two of the bill.
So we are very careful to make
sure that we are not infringing
on any collective bargaining rights of
any workers.
>> Ok. Thank you madam, chair and
representative. And
uh one other
question is this
retroactive >> madam
chair representative? No, it is
not. >> Ok, madam
chair. So if I
had 20 hours or
something currently,
I couldn't, once this
is enacted, I couldn't use those
20 hours as
leave. How does I'm just trying to figure
out when it starts to count
which hours.
>> So,
no,
so,
so as soon if this
bill is to be enacted, madam c
then that the clock starts
on on that day of
enactment and
those accrued hours
um are part of your
bank. And so
it's not necessarily retroactive,
but already it's
current, it's in real
time manager.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair and thank you
representative and madam
clerk.
Great. Ok. Thank
you,
>> Representative Burgo.
>> Thank you madam chair. Um
And thank you representative
and, and uh madam
clerk, I'm just trying to
understand
um what this
bill exactly what it
does. Um
So
if a employee
has
extra
leave, I guess time,
then they would be compensated
for that. Is that what this is
exactly? Um
>> madam chair
Representative Rodeo,
what we are seeing is that
certain employees
are accruing many,
many, many hours of comp
time because they are
the employees that are
not allowing their departments to
fix due to high vacancy
rates. But because they
are the star employee or the employee
that's essentially making sure
that their department does not fail,
they can never cash
out those comp time
benefits and some
departments are making them zero it
out without that that
compensation ever going back to the
employee because they are
literally so busy, they
cannot take that time.
We feel that that is unfair
and we also feel that it is uh
essentially a form of
wage theft and we
believe that it is only fair
for those employees who have,
who are in departments with very high
vacancy rates, who can
never take the time off
to be able to get some
form of compensation for the
time that they have worked.
>> And that leave
time is
calculated
based on their hourly
rate. That is
correct and what
to employees that
are
not
hourly.
>> And madam
chair representative.
And what and are you talking
about contractual?
Um I'm talking
>> about employees that are
management level.
How are they compensated?
So >> typically there is an hourly
rate um even if someone is
salaried and that would be the
calculus for uh
the rate madam chair
representative. What I
go
>> and madam chair
and, uh, representative
madam clerk. Um,
do you, I mean,
who track this?
The comp
and, and I just
think about like, when I was
working we did a lot
of over, I mean,
overtime, I guess it wasn't really
overtime, it was comp
time and
we tracked it ourselves
and then, you know, our
managers would
decide, um,
especially for management
employees,
um,
because it was kind of considered
part of the job, I guess you
could say how would that
be >> madam chair that's going to
be calculated through
regular payroll,
um, accrual of
time and, and management in
that that way. Thank
you. Ok, >> thank you
madam
chair.
>> Any members
chair, I would move a due pass
on House Labor
Veterans and Military Affairs
Committee substitute for House Bill
438.
Ok.
Um We have
a due pass motion by
madam Flo leader and a second
by Representative
Borrego
Carrow.
Represent for your
n
Yes representative
block. >> No, with a quick
explanation.
>> Representative
Borrego
representative
Lujan
was in Mejia.
No madam floor
leader. Yes. Representative
Zamora
madam vice chair madam
chair
madam chair by vote 53. The
motion motion
passes.
Ok,
quick
block and I
>> just, I voted
no, just because I haven't been able to talk
to my county and my municipalities
yet. And I didn't know what their stance
was. So I would hate to vote
on something until I got that. So that's
why. Thank you, madam
chair.
>> Let's move on to house
bill
571.
>> Thank you madam, chair and members of the
committee. Uh the bill before you
today is the
result of, well, a couple of
things. So there's a, there's
over 100
bills this legislative
session addressing our
housing issue in New Mexico.
And I think there is bipartisan
agreement that we need to address
housing. Um
There's we found an area
of agreement on this bill and a couple of other
bills where we can really
find support. This is a carrot,
not a stick regarding
zoning. So you may be
familiar with main street
designations or perhaps
the family, the um
the Family Friendly Business
Award that's given out annually
for businesses that choose to
participate in flexibility.
Or, and last year, we awarded
over 53 million in grants
to main Street projects.
So it's a voluntary
designation that cities
could take on
in hope that as future
comes, there will be incentives for those
communities who are making zoning
changes for receiving
funds within their district. Now that may
come from nonprofits, it may
come from the government. It
could be federal, who knows
where those dollars would come from.
But it's sort of an ease in and give
some options and some
recommendations to communities
where they could um
adopt zoning
practices that have worked
in other states for building capacity.
And I do have folks here that
would like to speak and support. Also, Carlos
and Daniel with the that will
give different rules. I'll let them
speak.
I want to mess up titles. >> Thank you,
representative madam chair Daniel
Wew. I lead the Governor's Office
of Housing. We supported the
creation of this bill.
Um uh I think
it's important to understand that
um a a recent
pew article, Pew
Charitable Trust identified
regulatory obstacles
is one of the primary
barriers to housing affordability
and housing availability in New
Mexico. Um
This is intended,
it, it says D fa because our
Office of Housing doesn't have statutory
authority yet, but we would intend
to take on this project as the Office
of Housing create a framework
for what best practice land use
and zoning is for the state, something
that's currently not defined.
This would help support adoption
our work in the Office of Housing to work
with local governments to implement
best practices around zoning
and could eventually be used
to direct special funding
housing that's awarded to communities
who make these types of
changes. I think this is
a model that was um
recently passed in Colorado
with prop 123, a
$300 million annual
uh housing funding source
that's conditioned upon local
governments uh improving
zoning frameworks. And that's an example
of how um we
use proactive care
based methods to move folks
in the right direction around regulations
for housing, I
think.
>> And madam chair representatives,
my name is Carlos Camorra. I work
with a company called Site Southwest. I
do a lot of uh affordable
housing plans, housing plans,
economic development plans, comprehensive
plans for uh local
jurisdictions all around
New Mexico. Um I've seen a
lot um how
jurisdictions are are
trying to, to deal with
housing. Um And so
I'm here uh as an
expert to talk about um
some of the, the things that those
local communities are doing and
how we might be able to get more
support for those local
communities uh in
addressing that uh comprehensive
and systemic
issue.
>> Thank you. Let's go to the
audience. Those in support.
Please raise your hands.
Ok, let's do
51 minute comments,
please.
>> Yes, good morning.
Um
I I'm sorry, I don't know the
formalities.
What's her name? Madam? Chair
uh I'm Rebecca Price
with my construction company,
affordable Housing and
I'm in support of this bill.
I've been trying to get affordable housing
to come to the marketplace.
Um We will build offsite
construction. So I'm in
support of this bill because
affordable housing affects
uh health, it
affects crime.
Um It brings down
crime, it supports
health. Um
It is the financial
stability to getting people
into
um wealth for
themselves. So I'm in
support of this
bill.
>> Oh, good morning madam
chair. My name is Marquita Russell. I'm
the CEO of the New Mexico Finance
Authority. My agency
oversees the opportunity
enterprise housing
Development fund.
The law that created that
fund last year requires
that the board give priority
to projects that have implemented
best practices.
There's unfortunately no framework
for that and this bill does
uh provide that framework
and it would be incredibly helpful
to the communities looking
to apply for funding from
that particular fund. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, madam, chair members of the committee,
uh Kent Cravens
with the uh registered
lobbyist with the New Mexico
Association of Realtors.
Uh for all the reasons stated, we're
enthusiastically in support
of this legislation
and we thank the sponsors for bringing
it
forward.
>> Let's go online. Do
we have any comments
and support >> anyone
who hoping to make public comment in support
of the bill? Please raise your
hand.
Ok. Anyone hoping to make
public comments in opposition to the bill,
please raise your hand.
Seeing. No,
>> ok, we'll go back back to
the audience. No
opposition
committee members,
representative block and then
Representative Lujan
>> Madam chair and thank you. Representative
Dow good to see you. Good
to see your experts again. I feel like I
keep seeing you in all my committees.
So good to see you.
So madam chair representative,
a couple of questions on this
one. So first
question is, will
this mean municipalities will
have to cooper
with these state
strategies? Will it be
mandated >> madam
chair and Representative this
is completely voluntary?
Um And
I hope that as
we promote this and
they learn of what the options
are. You know, think about
the folks within your district that may
be trustees, you know, they're
working without a lot of staff.
Um You know that they, that
they see these options and
they see it as an opportunity, but
it's definitely a carrot
gnostic.
>> Thank you madam chair and representative.
And then another question I had
from somebody who asked me
uh if
these state strategies will
support local architectural
aesthetics and if
you guys will respect municipalities,
varying opinions and where to
locate affordable
housing. And then
there's another question, but I'll
let you get those too because it's
a >> lot. Thank you madam
chair. And when you talk about
aesthetics, that's, that's a difficult
thing. This doesn't mandate
anything, it talks about best practices
and zoning. And I think that's
more covenant and
we cannot supersede
uh covenant. I mean, if you want to speak
to that law when existing
covenant,
>> madam chair representative,
um I think in this case,
uh so to speak to the first
part which is aesthetics. This
would not govern aesthetics. This
would govern things like
um the density
of housing, the speed with which
housing gets approved those types
of processes. It's really about the
supply of housing, not the
specific type
or aesthetics of housing.
I'd also say this isn't specifically
about affordable housing, this
is about housing supply
in general that being the
underlying driver of our
affordability and homelessness issues
that we just need more housing in
general, we need to build it quicker.
That helps lower the cost
um regulations and
our zoning frameworks are one of
the big drivers of costs that
we can actually affect in our
state. >> All
right. Thank you madam chair and representative.
And then last question on this
portion of it is,
will the award,
can it, can it be
revoked
in any way?
>> Well, madam
chair and representative, I don't know what the
rollouts gonna look like. Uh
Main Street is a designation
that is a, it's a
mutually beneficial
agreement that's entered into
between the local
municipality and the
state. So if, if
it's similar to that,
um then I I
believe that it would be able to be
revoked. In addition,
if you know there's other programs
out there where people are receiving
supplemental funds or,
or increased
eligibility to increase
funding. They are
sometimes annual. So
I don't know exactly what this will look
like, but it may be
um you know,
you we'll work
closely. I've got commitments from
from Daniel that we work closely
together on this.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair representative. And then a
little, a little earlier we said
this is not just about affordable
housing.
What kind of other housing?
Because madam chair represented in my
district people,
we have a lot of beautiful
houses that are getting built,
but because they can afford to
build these houses and people can buy
to buy these houses.
That's what has a better payoff at
the end of the day. So
beautiful brand
new $500,000
house can be built
because you can
build it like that. And that's high,
that's a high end in in my district.
I'm sure it's higher in Santa Fe, for
example. But could you
give me a little more information on that and
how we're going to try to
push this toward these
houses that can be affordable
for everyday new Mexico
workers,
>> madam chair Representative block.
I appreciate the question. That's exactly
the intent of this.
Uh a good way to think about it
is that um
zoning drives the market,
right? And if you have
say very
low density zoning with
really big lots that
incentivize the developer to
build a big expensive
house to maximize profit.
If you instead allow more
homes on that same
piece of land, the incentive
becomes to build more homes, you
get smaller, more naturally
affordable housing, uh
doesn't have income limits,
doesn't have restrictions
on it. It's just entry level
housing for workers. And so this is
really looking at how do we
design regulatory frameworks
that incentivize building the
type of housing that we really need in New
Mexico right now?
>> And madam chair Representative
Block, if I could just add, um I think
another example that we
were chatting very closely with Representative
Dow about um
existing regulations
might prevent
uh the rehabilitation
of of buildings. And so
one thing we were talking about is how
could we get more
residential into vacant
buildings, especially in rural
areas, not just rural
areas, but that you could
feasibly build more
housing in those areas.
You could reduce the cost, you could
reduce the the regulatory
barriers that are currently
preventing that kind of
housing from being built. And
so we would want to decrease
the cost of that, we would want to make
it more accessible or more
affordable, but we would also just
want to have more of that
housing be able to be built.
So if a jurisdiction
was to be able to create something
that removed some of
those barriers and
made housing more affordable
or accessible, not necessarily a
capital, a affordable for
lower income, but just making
that more affordable than it otherwise
would be or lowering the cost
of construction, for
instance, through streamlined
development review or
reduced regulatory barriers.
Um Those would also be examples
where you're decreasing the
cost of construction for all
housing as opposed
to just, you know,
focusing on one kind of area
of the market. Thank you,
>> madam chair representative. And I agree, I
think that we should
be always looking to
decrease these regulatory
barriers in any way because
they're usually what keeps these
projects from being built in the first
place. So uh
this brought another question, I
apologize. So when it comes to
this, does
it encourage
building affordable but
quality construction?
Because I wouldn't want to
incentivize a bunch of builders
to build really
shoddily built homes on
tiny little lots that barely
have any back backyard
and then they, they have
problems with them 10 years down the
line. And
it, it's, it would rather be
better just to build a brand new house
on that. I just want to make sure that this
is an incentivizing really cheaply
made homes >> that and
representative, it's not, this is about
zoning and so it wouldn't
change building code,
but it may reduce the
burden and the the process
of getting to that point of
being able to build. But I mean,
like II I will give you a concrete
example. Sierra County is one of
the lowest income counties in the
state and there was a
recently an adopted
zone, they adopted some
zoning and it said that you
could not, regardless of your lot
size, you could not have an
RV hooked up in your parking in
your, on your own private
property. So there
was several family members who
started calling me saying, you know, our
disabled nephew
lives in a trade in an RV
on our, you know, one and a
quarter acre lot. And now they're not
allowed to do that. So
they may or may not get
rid of that zone. But it, it
could be one
of the, the options that they
take to receive the award
is rolling back some of the local
zones that prevent people from or some,
not all communities allow an
additional dwelling unit, but that's
your private property. Should you have
the right to have an additional dwelling
unit? No, I'm
not, we're not telling
people what to do, but there will be a list
of best practices.
>> Thank you so much, madam, chair representative.
That's all I have.
Thanks,
>> Representative Lujan and
then Representative Breo. Thank
>> you madam chair. Thank you for bringing
this this bill forward. I
actually was
at a conference where there
was a presentation on, on just
this information and I,
you know, kind of dove into
it and so I appreciate it coming forward
and that we're seeing this as
we are committing
so many dollars to
the uh housing
office. And at D
fa
um
I would say that
um
Right
madam chair, I would say
that
um
as the rules
will be made by
D FA and the housing
office,
did you consider maybe
putting together or
creating a committee or board
or commission who
would promulgate the rules?
Madam? Chair
>> madam chair and representative,
they won't necessarily, I mean, these are
going to be the menu of options
for the communities
to voluntarily adopt.
You want to speak to that or is it different in the
housing
>> madam chair representative?
Um we haven't actually discussed
in statute, the the
process, sort
of the means and methods of
how this is done. I think it
will take extensive consultation.
If you look at the language
in the bill, it suggests
that we need to uh
understand the needs of both
rural and urban
communities. Um I
can tell you that we have been doing
outreach to over 40
communities around the state over the
last year. And so have a
handle of the range of issues
and would love to have input from
legislators and key local
stakeholders around >> this madam
chair, I would just turn to page
two, section
three,
subsection A the department
shall establish a program to
grant an award
certificate to a municipality
that has adopted
or established one or more department
approved strategies
to increase housing affordability
and accessibility. The
war certificate shall designate
a municipality, a
building new Mexico
community so that are there
and lies where you would
be that the
department would be
promulgating rules
for the for the
um the
award. So
who does that madam
chair
>> madam chair representative as
the State's Department of Finance
Authority?
>> That's why I'm asking, did
you consider, would you consider
creating
more gui uh for
me more guidelines
for uh the type
of money that's going to be going
through these, these coffers if
you will madam chair and create
a board, a committee
or commission to help
promulgate those rules
and to oversee this
uh
what you are creating in this
legislation, madam chair
>> madam chair representative.
In this particular case, it,
it's literally gonna end up being a
paper certificate, there's no money
tied or a word tied to this other
than an acknowledgment that
you've chosen to participate.
It could in the future. And I'm
sure if there's an
award or an appropriation
attached to it, that there's going to
be a
process >> madam Chair
representative inadvertently,
wouldn't there be an award
that would uh or
wouldn't there follow
the, the, the
appropriation of the
funding
along with this
award
or after this award, >> madam
chair and representative, not in this
bill, but I'm I hope
that there's another bill that comes
out with awards and I'm sure
that one will have strings
attached.
>> And madam chair representative
I've just offered that
um it made
sense for us to first develop
the criteria before we
tied anything to it, right.
Um And help people understand that
we're certainly committed to
and happy to convene
a working group around establishment
of this >> madam
chair. I appreciate
that.
That's all I have
>> presented by
madam chair. I move that house
Bill 571 do now
pass.
We have a motion for a due
pass by Representative Bargo.
All second please call
roll
is about
>> representative block
pass.
Representative Borrego.
Yes. Representative
Luhan. Yes, explain >> my
vote.
>> Mejia.
Yes, Adam
floor leader.
Yes,
Representative
Samora.
Representative Block.
Yes, madam
vice chair madam
chair
madam chair by Voltaire the motion,
the motion.
>> Ok.
>> Thank you uh manager. Thank
you for bringing this legislation
forward. I think it's really, really important,
but I also think it's, it's very
important and I'm happy to work with you
outside of this because
putting those guardrails in place
are really important. We
have so much money over.
I think the last
committee hearing we said over 100
and $30 million going to
uh these efforts or
possible. Thank
you.
>> You have to
have.
All right, Representative
Lujan. Unless
I see
Cadena,
let's go ahead and do
House Bill
439.
Olivia
done
the
>> ok.
Thank you madam
chair
for passing out some information
and thank you so
much.
Um
My second bill I'm presenting to
committee today is House Bill
439
through relating
to emergency medicine, requiring
public safety, telephon
line, telecommunications to
be trained in
high quality tele
communicator,
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
madam chair.
Um When there is an
emergency, we know to dial
911 and the
dispatchers who answer
the call are often the
first point of contact
in an emergency.
911. Dispatchers have
the unique opportunity to help
callers as they
wait for the first responders to
arrive house
bill. 439 will ensure
all dispatchers are trained
and able to coach bystanders
to perform. CPR.
Cardiac arrest is a leading
cause of death
with more than
350,000
out of hospital cardiac
arrests occurring each
year in the United States.
It strikes suddenly and
without warning. And
what happens in the first few
minutes can mean the difference
between life and
death
madam chair with that.
We, we present
um this bill and I'll
have my expert
witness introduce himself
and have further
comment,
>> madam chair members of
the committee. My name is
Mahesh Sita with the
American Heart Association.
And you know,
uh
uh every
minute, uh
a cardiac arrest
patient doesn't victim
doesn't receive
CPR the
survival rates go down
by almost 10%.
And you know,
we are a rural
state and
ems response, you
know, sometimes takes longer
and it's very critical
for 911 operators
to be trained in this.
So they can at least,
you know, assist
people on the other line
to do, you know
uh uh
compressions.
And you know, the studies
have shown that, you
know, dispatcher
assisted CPR
have higher rates
of survival and
better outcomes, especially
when it's done immediately.
So that
mhm.
Thank you madam >> madam
chair. So this
what we're discussing today is
known as dispatcher assisted
CPR or
telephone CPR.
The goal um Here
is to ensure that all dispatchers
receive this training.
And as a result, all
callers are provided with
this important life saving
instruction. Even
those without previous CPR
knowledge can quickly be
instructed and
this leads to saving lives
madam chair. And that's why we have this
piece of legislation before you
today with that will stand
for questions.
>> Thank you representative, let's go to
the audience. Those in support
who wish to speak. Please raise
your hands
in opposition.
Let's go
online.
>> Anyone hoping to make a public comment
in support of the bill, please raise
your
hand.
None. We'll move on to uh anyone
hoping to make public comment in opposition
to the bill, please raise your
hand.
I see none.
>> Representative Anan
Arno.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank you
representative for bringing this bill
forward. Um Just one
quick question is
what
new or different
training would tele
communicators receive
that they are not
received or trained in
now? Because have
the guidelines changed.
>> So madam CPR,
I believe you're referring to regular
CPR. Um
this would be specific
to telecommunications
on the phone when say,
for instance, uh
you're in emergency situation
and somebody drops to the floor
and they
obviously pulling their,
their heart or you think they're having a
cardiac issue and you call
911, then the
operator is able to instruct
you in the
CPR um preservation
methods. Madam chair.
>> Yeah, madam chair representative,
let me, I guess I'll just
try ask and I don't think I'm making
myself clear. So the
current guidelines
that 911
operators give for a
cardiac event
happening elsewhere? Of
course, are, are we
training them? Are we
updating those guidelines? >> Yes,
madam chair currently we do
not have that those provisions
or the, the that full training
in place? >> Oh, ok. All
right. Thank you. That clears it up for me.
Thank you madam.
Chair
>> members
represented a block and I'm
sure I move a due
pass
for due pass by ranking member
block and the second
by madam floor leader
Sapanski. Do we
have any opposition?
Oh,
go. Do
we have any opposition?
Seeing none? You have a due pass.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you committee
members.
>> The representative
Cadena. Let's
do House Bill 427
as
a
Yes, I think
so.
>> Thank you madam. So and
kot
we just finished with tax.
So I'm glad I got to run over
quickly. Um I'm
here today. With house bill
427 as
amended. Uh What
this bill does is
add a category
of possible spending to the
New Mexico Water Trust
Board that's administered by
the New Mexico Finance Authority.
Currently, there's six eligible
purposes that a
local government or authority
could use um or could
seek financial assistance
for this adds
1/7 in real
time water monitoring.
So, um
this real time water
monitoring would not
interrupt or replace
the regulatory or
compliance responsibilities
held by nmed and
others that have boots on the
ground to keep an
eye on what's in those water sources.
But instead give local
governments and water authorities
real time data to be
responsive and
ready to um
make sure the drinking water
that their constituents have
is safe. So
with that, I will go back
to the committee, madam chair
>> representative, let's go to the
audience. Do we have
anyone who wishes to
speak and support?
Ok, let's do one
minute.
>> Good morning madam, chair members of the
committee. My name is Vanessa Laide.
I'm a registered lobbyist for Borderplex
Digital. And we
agree with what a sponsor
has said with Representative Cadena.
Every New Mexican deserves clean
water. Thank
you.
Good morning madam, chair and
members of the committee. My name is Jennifer
Bradfute and I am an
attorney for a company called
Apo Luma. Apoula
is a digital software
company that's working on
putting together water
monitoring programs
with the State of New Mexico.
We have been working with Secretary
Kinney with the New Mexico
Environment Department. He stood in
support of this bill and the
House Water Committee. He
was unable to make the committee
today but said that I could
represent his support today
as well. This bill will
help ensure that the public
can see what's in their water,
giving transparency to
local citizens to
know what contaminants might
be in their water. Currently,
over 40% of New
Mexico's drinking water
systems are out of
compliance with drinking water
specifications. Thank
you.
>> Good morning madam chair. My name is Joe
de La Rosa. I'm the chairman of the New
Mexico Border Authority.
Uh One of the things this bill
also does is it helps local
water operators including
those in rural areas
of the state and along the
border uh to gather
the critical data that's
necessary for grant
applications and loans.
Currently, there's like a catch 22
situation
where monitoring
data is necessary for the
applications, but they don't have the
resources to actually collect the
data. So this actually
addresses that issue. >> Thank
you.
Hey, let's go online.
Do we have any
comments?
>> You were hoping to make public comment in support
of the bill? Please raise your
hand.
See, none, we will move on to
anybody. Hoping to make public comment in
opposition to the bill. Please raise
your
hand.
>> Hey, anybody in the
audience who
opposes
the nun
Representative
Lujan
>> Madamm. Sure. When appropriate, I'd like
to make a
motion,
make a motion to do pass
>> then a Baggo
chair and, and thank
you representative.
So I
I'm trying to
understand the
bill. Is it for small
really for smaller
communities?
Um Because in Albuquerque,
we test the water
in the Rio Grande on
a, on a regular
basis. So I'm just
wondering
um how,
you know, is it
expanding that
role to
smaller communities or
the AECs or how? I mean,
how does this
madam >> chair um what this
is doing uh is
adding a possible
spend to the Water Trust
Board. So the Water Trust Board has been
around for decades, very well
established. Um Local
governments, water authorities can
go and seek financial
assistance for their
priority water projects. So there's
six potential
uses. They can um
seek that those dollars for
now. Some they go
out as grants, sometimes they go out as
loans. Um The majority
of the money going into the or
a good source of the money going
into the water Trust board comes out
of our severance tax bond
distributions. But then
sometimes, and including this
year, I think as I've understood
it, we put General fund dollars
in as well because we know
how across water
systems, how water is a priority.
And many of our local governments
and water systems need
resources to
get their water, what it needs to
across different uses. So
this bill is not designed
to um positively
impact one particular
kind of water system. Not AECs,
not rural communities, not
urban areas like Albuquerque,
but instead it just
says that real time water
monitoring and protection
can be one of the purposes
that um someone would
go to the Water Trust Board for
and seek financial assistance.
So the Water Trust Board is such
a reputable body in New
Mexico. Um I believe we
Marquita here in the
audience and
in her leadership at NM
fa but what they
do is receive applications,
they prioritize which
projects are ready
um And have uh what
they need to actually move forward
with something they then put
together a legislative package. And
I believe we just passed the, the
this year's water Trust board
uh legislative package
out of the house floor yesterday.
So this is just saying if
someone wanted
finance assistance for real time
water monitoring, it could
go to the water Trust board for that
assistance. It would still follow
their regular process
um go through their
application review and then in
front of the legislature before those
projects were actually funded.
Um I would say that N
Ma also did bring us
some language
uh amendments in house ag
and water that we
uh amended there to make
sure that what our bill
was doing was in line with
their, their
operations at the Water
Trustport. Thank you.
>> Thank you, madam madam
chair and Representative
Cadena that
does um help
me understand what exactly
what you're doing.
Um And I think it's
it's a good bill.
Um It just seems to
me like honestly
madam chair and representative
is what amounts
that are in here really
need to be increased in the
future, but that's just
my opinion. So
um thank you for bringing that
forward.
>> Representative
Zamora
madam chair. I'll second the due
pass representative
Rankin member
block. Thank >> you madam chair
representative. Just a couple of
quick questions about what we're
monitoring. So
are we monitoring flow
rates, uh
dissolved oxygen,
minerals, chemical pollutants?
What what are we
monitoring in
these added
language in the bill? And what,
what would that maybe
bring back to us? So we know what's
in there? >> Uh real
time water monitoring. It's about
what's in the water, whether
in my part of New Mexico and
you may have read the news about crea
we're looking at arsenic in other
parts of the state. It might be PFA,
but it's trying to figure out what the quality
of the water is in real
time. >> Ok.
Thank you madam chair representative. So
I'm just wondering so what,
what parameters are we
searching for? Quality
wise? Is it all of
those
pfos arsenic
or is it, is there a
prescribed number of
contaminants we're looking for
or >> madam chair. This bill
doesn't speak to that. It's just so
that those local governments and
water authorities would have a real
time understanding of what was in their
data, of what was
in their water. Thank
you madam chair. Thank >> you madam
chair representative and then
eligible entities for this.
Would it include
universities
as well or is it
just a
se associations,
land grants, uh
local governments who,
who's included in this madam >> chair?
It would be the same eligible entities
that can today go to the Water
Trust Board with qualifying
projects seeking financial
assistance.
>> Thank you madam chair representative. So that would
not include anyone in the private sector
at
all,
>> correct? So we have our
shout out from the
back. The incredible Marquita
from New Mexico Finance Authority
that says no private entities
are not eligible for
Water Trust board projects. >> Ok.
Thank you madam chair. That's all I
have.
>> Thank you. Ok. We
have a motion for a due pass a
second. Let's call
roll
>> representative Ona Noan.
Yes, representative
block.
Yes,
representing Puo
representative Luhan. Yes
representative Maia.
Yes madam floor
leader.
Yes, representative
Zamora
madam, vice chair madam
chair. When I'm
chaired by a vote of 8 to 0. The motion
passes
presented
>> Zamari
your mic.
So
you said you
light.
>> Ok.
Representative Lujan,
would you please
start? I'll
spill 459
for Ferrari as
she makes representatives
here, madam
chair
may begin.
Representative
>> uh thank you madam chair
and committee members. Um,
I'll do this on the fast
version. HB
459 appropriate.
Oh, could we bring
my expert?
Um, she is under
a Baabb
a, her name is
Melanie
Kirby.
She
is
with the adaptive be bre
Breeders Alliance.
I have a Rosa Maria
Kirby.
Is that her? That
might work?
Yeah. Can, oh, here we go.
I have her,
here
she is in the Dallas
airport going to Rome
for a special,
um uh
ag uh
meeting.
I have Melanie Kirby. Hi, Melanie.
Can you hear us?
>> Yes. Can you hear me?
>> We can Melanie? I'll
go ahead and just introduce the bill
first. Um
HB 459
appropriates 100
I'm sorry, 1.5
million from the general fund to the
higher Education Department
for a program to be housed
at the Institute of American
Indian Arts. I I
A to research
um pollinator habitat
in conservation
and it authorizes the funding
to be spent between um
fy 26 and
28 and allows
up to 100 and 50,000
of the appropriation to be spent
for indirect cost to
administer the program.
Um And so with
that, I just like to have
my um expert
Melanie who's an integral
part of all of this
um to explain some of the
background.
>> Sure. Um
Madam chair and esteemed
committee members. Thank you for
having me and thank you, Representative
Ferrari and the
others on um the
cosponsor list to support
this bill. So
yes, I'm in the airport and hopefully you
won't get too much background noise
but to kind of keep it short and
sweet. Um
hm 33
was sponsored by Ore
last year and that actually
called for a New
Mexico Pollinator Protection
plan working group to
be formed. Um that
was formed and it started meeting
in August under the
facilitation of the New Mexico
Department of AG
one of the requirements of hm
33 required that
a report be submitted
to the Water and Natural Resources
Committee in October of
2024 which
was done. Um That
report actually
included a list of
recommendations
and a lot of the recommendations were
focused on the need for more
research, more
education and more
outreach. The development
of a pollinator protection plan
is still gonna take a little bit of time.
The working group has been meeting
regularly and that's
all rooted actually in a 2014
presidential mandate, calling for
each state to develop one.
We're on a year 11 and New
Mexico still doesn't have one. So
we're really trying hard as a
working group to get one done that
can really encompass and be
inclusive of our diversity
of landscapes across
the state. But
in the meantime, the
working group realized
that in order for them
to really fulfill
the development of a plan,
they really did need some more
information. There's not a lot of
data that exists for New
Mexico pollinators
and So,
um in collaboration
with Institute of American Indian Arts,
which I also serve as an extension
educator there. I'm a pollinator
specialist there. I'm
also on the national
sub-committee um
for pollinators of the
National Agriculture Research
Extension Education and
Economics Advisory board.
And I've also served on numerous
boards relating to bees
throughout my almost 30
year career working as a
professional beekeeper
um that these needs are
not gonna happen unless we get
funding to do it. And
so N MD A had
shared with us at that particular
time back in October
that they didn't necessarily have the
capacity to pursue
that. And so I asked
if we could do a tandem
effort to some of
us in the working group who are interested in
trying to find funds to
help support these
recommendations and the need for
the research and education
and outreach. And so
luckily, Representative
Ferrari um heeded our
call and helped us
to develop this
proposal.
Um One of the things
that we're hoping to do
is I, I
actually already has
five years worth of pollinator
programming. We started
with beekeeping. We now also
do pollinator and plant
research also on culturally
relevant plants. And we
also do a lot of extension
and outreach including
an event today that my
coworker and research
assistant is going to be doing
at the Fruit growers workshop
up in A BCU.
So
basically, there's a lot
of need and this would help us
to further those
efforts to get the,
the data that's needed in order
to further develop a plan.
Thank
you.
>> Let's go to the audience.
Do we have any?
Ok. We have um
comments and support
one minute, please. Thank
you. Let's
take five comments
in
support.
>> Hi, my name is Julianne Salinas. I'm a
beekeeper in New Albu
in Albuquerque and I'm a member of
the New Mexico Beekeepers
Association co-founder
of the New Mexico Bee Collective.
And today I'm here in support of
HB 459 as
a representative of agricultural
network and the New Mexico
Food and Agricultural Policy
Council.
Um with
the passage of house memorial
33 this body
recognized the need for pollinator
protection, education and
research and this
provides the financial backing
to move this project forward
as a, as a beekeeper, I
recognize that pollinators
are a key indicator species
of the impacts of climate change
on our state.
And this bill would
help um
provide the, the funding for the
data collection on that.
Thank
you,
>> madam, chair members of the
committee. My name is Susan Wilker.
I'm a member of the New Mexico
Food Ne Policy Council
as well. I also
board member at Farm to table.
We are in full support
of House
Bill or
59.
Um We've been tracking
pollinator protection for a
number of years. So this is
extremely important.
The plan is extremely
important as Melanie
reported. We're way
behind other states
but also the data is
extremely important. We put out
a Food Charter this year and having that
data is going
to help us
monitor progress.
And of course, the outreach and
education is, is equally
important. So we thank our
sponsors and we're in full support
of this
bill.
>> Oh, yes. My name is Eugene Pickett.
I'm with the uh
governing committee of
the uh A and Food
Policy Council, as well
as Black Farmers and
Ranchers and
uh the National Rural
Coalition. And what we found out
about pollinators
pollinators, which are
now uh identified
as livestock. Also,
we're losing pollinators.
So we've lost on a
national level about
80%. So
the 80% you know, is a
multiplying factor
and um pollinators
actually in the
ecosystem
um
balance
production in
agriculture. So
me being ignorant of
that probably
10 years ago, over
the years, you know, I've gained
that knowledge to say, you know,
the importance
but every uh
um
climate
event as a
disastrous, we
lose pollinators.
So, you know, this uh we're,
I mean, we're, you know, full support
of
459
good morning chair members
of the committee. My name is Hutching Miller.
I'm the Intergovernmental Outreach
coordinator for Santa Fe County.
I just like to simply state
that um the Santa Fe
County Commission has
a resolution
in place for sustainability
and pollinator protection
is a element of
that resolution.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you.
Let's
>> madam chair committee members.
My name is Pam Roy, also
representing um farm
Tabled in New Mexico Food and Agriculture
Policy Council and the Rocky Mountain
Farmers Union. We
stand in full support for
every reason that everybody's
already brought up here and
look for the passage of this
really important bill and
the research to come. Thank
you. >> Thank
you. Any
others. Uh Let's
go online.
>> Anyone hoping to make public comment,
please raise your hand and support.
We have
a
uh
Yeah. Can you hear me?
I >> wish you good. Thank you. Uh
My name is Johannes Lenzer. I'm
with the National Center for Frontier
Communities based in
Silver City, New Mexico and
we operate the frontier food
hub. Um We are
also a member of
the New
Mexican Food and Act Policy
Council where I sit
on the governance committee
and yeah, we work with
small producers
um across the state,
especially in the Southwester part
of the state. We transport
a lot of food around but we
won't have any food without
pollinators. We
really integral to our
ecosystems and
therefore also in support of
this bill. Thank
you
>> so much
John.
Anyone else hoping to make public comment in
support of the
bill?
Ok. Moving on anybody
hoping to make public comment in
opposition to the bill, please raise
your hand.
See. No.
>> Hey, representative
ranking member >> block.
Thank you madam chair. Thank you representative
madam chair Ferrari. Good to see
you. So a few
questions here. I
my first question is
why didn't we
do this at New Mexico
State University
where they do have a pollinator
program at their Los Lunas
campus already. Can
you tell me about
that
>> madam chair? I'm going to
refer to um
Melanie
my expert.
>> Hi. Yes madam chair
and esteemed members of the
committee. So
Las Luas does happen to
have an urban I PM
specialist position.
And in the past, they've had several
folks in that position who
have started to dabble
into um
working with beekeepers
and promoting pollinator, but they
don't have ANAB
program. And
so one of the
things that was suggested to us
because I actually did not
necessarily
suggest IAI a
immediately. But
what was suggested to me by
an MD A and also several
other legislators was
that there's an
opportunity here for us to be
more inclusive with including
tribal perspective
and tribal read research.
Additionally,
um There's a need
for programs
that not only already
exist but to be further
promoted. And so
if it to go to N MS U,
they would actually have to use the
bulk of that just to get stuff
started. Whereas Iai
A already has a
track record of programs
and can literally just with
additional funding, be able to
extend that out to reach more
parts of the state and more
communities.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair. Thank you
representative and and expert.
So then
with the
report that we got
from hm
33 from last year,
what findings did it have
indicating that this was
something that we should
do?
>> Chair and representative
I could be here with the door
opening. >> Sure madam
chair, I'm wondering what did hm
33 from last year,
the memorial that
had the N MD
A have a
report. What did that report
say? And what findings led
to this legislation, madam
chair. >> Thank you
madam chair representative.
Um um My
expert had mentioned it. Do
you want to add anything
more about it,
Melanie?
>> Um Yes, I'll just
add that um
the working group was
established to include
additional stakeholders because
the original plan that
had been put forth already
had been developed over
six years by the New Mexico
Beekeepers Association.
And in addition to a few other
stakeholders including pesticide
applicator representation
and other organizations that
were with, um,
with pollinators, but
the working group was then
expanded to include more
folks. Um, and
so they've been slowly working
through it. We've been, I've been
going to those meetings regularly.
Um, there's been a little bit of back
and forth as to just start with a
new outline to, you know,
work with what already
exists. And so
it's been a little bit of up and down,
but the, the working group is
pushing through. So
the recommendations that were put
forth were basically
required by that,
hm 33
as a report to
demonstrate where we
are standing with the plan.
And so what that report
actually indicated was that more
time was needed to create the
plan. But that also we needed
more data with which to
create the plan. And
so
group morale actually started
to suffer slightly because we
realize it's a chicken and the egg, you
can't do the plan unless
you have the data, but you can't
do the data unless
you know what your plans gonna be.
And unless you have actually the funding
to do the research that's needed.
And so that's what
prompted the inspiration for
trying to pursue a way
to find the funding that's
needed to also
allow the working group to
continue what it needs to do. So it can
better reflect the needs
and also the potentials for
our state. One thing I would
also just like to share that's really
important is that many of
you may not have heard yet,
but there's been over a million
hives lost across the
country just this winter.
And it's really
alarming because now we've
got federal agencies that
are starting to remove
positions that are looking
at different research avenues
and also different
um obstacles
and environmental concerns
that are affecting the
pollinators. So
interestingly, and I'll just share this
briefly. Honey is
valued at about $350
million across the
nation. But pollination is the
real and most important
thing. It's valued at over
18 billion a year just
in the US and globally at
235
to 577
billion. And so in
New Mexico, not only are
pollinators helping to produce
crops, but they're helping to
produce seeds. They're the
ones who are pollinating the alfalfa
for everybody who loves their New
Mexico beef and
they're also helping to
um produce fiber.
So it's really essential that we
get more research money
to help elucidate these
and make a better
plan,
>> man. Chair representative. OK. And then
I'm wondering where I'm
just wondering how many people do we
expect to be hiring with this
1.5 million?
What, what kinds
of programs are we gonna be
running with this research?
I just, it says 1.5
million, but it's not very
specific. So I'm just
wondering what that goes to
how many mo new employees,
how many new programs.
And what kinds of research are we
gonna be looking at regarding
the state versus what's
already available nationwide?
How, how are we gonna utilize
every dollar to make it
count?
>> Melanie if you could explain
that very briefly?
>> Yes, sorry, I get, I
get caught up in the words,
but yes, thank you so much for
asking. Uh When we came
up with this proposal, we actually did
have it outlined out
at minimum, there would be 3
to 4 new hires
and one would actually work
to help facilitate
more stakeholders
to become part of this larger
working group that can then help to
better inform
pollinator research and
needs across the state.
We would also have educators,
researchers and also
provide opportunities for interns
who would then be able to help with
that research and that way we could
better train folks within
our own state to support
our own
state.
We also what? Sorry.
One last thing too is that
Iai A as fiscal
sponsor because they are a land grant
university would also
be able to serve as
um fiscal sponsors to
help do sub awards. So if
there were other organizations
or other researchers
or students who wanted to
pursue some of these
inquiries, they would then be
able to receive a sub
award from Iai
A
>> Thank you madam chair. That's all the questions I
have.
>> Representative Lujan and then
represented BREO.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank
you um representative
for, for bringing this forward. We know
that, you know, there's
been ex extensive
um funding and work done
to adjust the
crisis of our pollinators
um globally, I'd
say. Um but in
the United States
and we know that
if we don't do something about this,
that we, there
are, there are different
crisises um
that we can face with food
supply um and
shortages and, and the
like, and I just want to say thank you very
much for the focus on this.
Um I very much support
this and, and the work that Iai
A does um
here in, in Santa
Fe, I think that, you
know, um our expert witness
is really hitting all the
the the highs of
why it's important to continue this
work. Um My
question
is, is there
funding in the budget
for this manager,
>> madam chair and
representative um
we are looking
at the Department of AG
and um also
there's um
some um
pesticide
um
funding uh
to offset, you know, what
pesticides have done settlement
I should say. So we
are seeking that. >> That's
wonderful. Thank you madam
chair. Thank you
