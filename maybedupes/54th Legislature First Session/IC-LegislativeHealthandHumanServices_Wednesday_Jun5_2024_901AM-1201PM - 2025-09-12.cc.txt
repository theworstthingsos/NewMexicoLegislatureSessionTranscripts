Well,
good morning everyone. We've got
a very
full
three days ahead of us. So
we, we probably ought to get started.
I don't want people to, to
miss too much of the,
uh, of the opportunity to
address this. So, uh, we'll
start with the members introducing
themselves this morning. This is
the, the
second, actually the second
meeting of the legislative Health and
Human Services interim
committee.
And, um, we've
mapped out for ourselves a very
ambitious
schedule.
I, I forgot exactly
27 days. I think
we have of meetings
and,
uh, uh, some
crucial topics, topics
that really deal with
much of what the state
has, has identified
as issues.
They, they want the legislature
to do something about.
So, this morning we're
going to get started with the members who
are here introducing themselves
and Representative Vincent, why
don't we start with
you?
>> Thank you, Mr Chair, uh,
Harland Vincent
district 56. I
represent, uh Lincoln
County in the mountainous portions
of Otero
and it's
good to be back. I miss you
guys a little bit. I
actually do miss y'all. I mean,
you look good. I'm glad
to see
you.
>> Hi, I'm representative Kathleen
Case from district 44
White district is all of Corrales,
parts of Rio Rancho,
northern part of Albuquerque
and the unincorporated area
of Alameda. Thank
you.
>> Good morning, everybody. I'm
Jennifer Jones. I represent the
southernmost district in the state
including the Boot Hell,
Hidalgo County, Luna
and Doanna.
And I've missed you guys
too.
>> It's good to see everybody here this
morning. Uh, Representative
Chavez, we go to you.
>> Uh, good morning
everyone. Eleanor Chavez.
I represent House district
26 that sits on
the west side of
Albuquerque.
Good morning. I'm Representative
Joanne Ferrari from
Las Cruces uh house
district 37
and so glad
to be in Albuquerque.
It's beautiful,
especially right
now.
>> Good morning. I'm Representative
Liz Thompson Dry
Mouth House District
24 which is the
near Northeast Heights of Albuquerque
and I missed you all too.
I actually have dreams
about this committee and
I'm gonna make an
announcement. I
have the chairs
so I can cut mics.
So just a warning,
I'm gonna keep my time
and if you go too long, I'm gonna
cut your mic. Gives me
lots of a real
powerful
feeling
>> and representative
Lord,
I almost forgot how this
works. Good morning.
Thank you, Representative Stie
Lorde, uh East
Mountains and in the part
of Albuquerque and District
22. Happy to
be
here.
Let's have the staff
introduce le Yeah,
let's, let's have the staff
introduce themselves. We'll start with you,
Andrea.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
My name is Andrea Lazaro
and um I am one of the
staffers for LH
H SI just
uh hit my fifth year
anniversary working for the
council service and
it's nice to see
everyone.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. My name
is Grace Balder Ramos and I'm
a proof reader with the Council
service and LH
HS is the only uh
committee that Xander and Andy and
I staff. So we're happy to be
a resource to you anytime you need.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Good morning,
everyone. My name is Xander
Dawson and I
am a staff attorney
for the L CS. And as
grace said, this is our only
committee. So we're happy to work with
you
>> and we have Leo
here, Leo is our
technician and I, I guess
your assigned permanently does because
we see you every meeting. It's good to
have you, Leo
and the,
the instructions we
have are to only meet in
locales uh
where we
can webcast so
that the public has access
to every one of our meetings. And
so Leo make sure that
that happens,
uh wherever we
go, Leo will be
there with us and so will
his incredible
equipment. We also
have a staff
from the legislative
finance committee
who are going to be with us every
single meeting. I think we have
four staff designated
to work with us
and it's an effort at making
sure that
information that's
gleaned by this
committee is
also shared with
LFC and
similarly, and we
try to enhance communication
between the two groups so
that we're not here making
recommendations about policy
and they're in a separate silo
making recommendations about
budget. We're trying to
integrate the two a little more
closely. And so we,
we'll, we'll be hearing from the staff later
on this morning. Uh
but uh Rachel
and Nathan are here and,
and they'll be making one of the presentations
this morning.
Um,
and then I, I'll introduce myself.
I'm Jerry Ortiz Pino. I'm
state senator for this district.
Actually, we're in my district
Senate district 12,
a district which
will vanish in
December and,
uh, relocate itself to
the Rio Rancho
Taylor Ranch area
that number, uh,
and this district
is being sliced up into
six pieces and
divvied up among six other senate
districts. Uh,
this piece I think will be
in, uh, Senate
district 13 and
that the election
last ye
yesterday, uh,
decided that, that the,
um, I don't think she has
a Republican opponent. So I
think, uh, uh,
the, that, uh,
uh, Debbie o'malley,
the former city councilor
and state and county
commissioner will be the
new state senator for this
district
13.
With that, we'll move ahead
to the first item on our agenda
which is Dr Holloway, the
Provost and Executive Vice
President for
academic affairs
at UN M. Good
morning.
>> Good morning, Mr Chair,
uh, good morning, uh,
representatives, members
of the committee, um, legislative
staff um like
to, to welcome you to the
University of New Mexico and
welcome you to Rainforest Innovations.
Um It's uh it's
wonderful to see that you all miss each
other. Um
May, maybe you'll miss me when I'm
gone.
And so I just wanted to share
just a little bit about
where we are and,
and what goes on here. So
we're in, in a
building called
the
UN M Rainforest
Building. And, and the main
activity that happens here
is that an organization
called Un M Rainforest
Innovations is based
here and Rainforest
Innovations is the
university's
technology transferring
economic development
organization.
It's, it's mission
is to foster
the the
transfer of intellectual
property ideas,
technologies from the
University of New Mexico
into the world.
Because one thing we know
is that while
in universities, we create
lots of interesting ideas and
technologies, they
really don't have an impact until
they've somehow been moved into
the world. And commercialization
is, is one of the key ways to
do that. And so
rainforest innovation
works to protect
and commercialized technologies
that we develop here,
including through patents
and through copyrights works
to transfer those
technologies into the market
marketplace,
connects us with the
business community, with companies,
with entrepreneurs, with
investors.
If we look at kind of, you know, what's
what's been the impact of that
to date? 169
start up companies have spun
out of the, the University of New
Mexico in
2022.
Um the um
uh the payroll of those
companies in New Mexico is a
little over $20 million
in, in wages and salaries
and they generated some $40
million of total economic
impact that year.
Um And from the
secondary effects from
the, the other companies and
businesses that support those,
there's another $64
million of, of economic
impact. Um
Rainforest innovation
supports all of UN
M so it supports
the, the academic units
on central campus. It supports
all of the health science units,
it supports the branch campuses
in this work.
Uh Last year, we
saw 78
invention disclosures,
32
issued us patents.
Um We licensed
or optioned um
technologies for
38 different and 38
different agreements.
Um And
so there's been a distinct
impact, something else
rainforest has started to do
recently that we're very proud
of is start to
connect the Health
Science Center with the rest
of campus.
And so as, as
you know, many
technologies that
many ideas, many
approaches to addressing
health care aren't, aren't
seen only through a health care
lens. They may involve engineering,
they may involve ideas in material
science, ideas in
chemistry. Uh And
so rainforest innovations
has started a, a
program called
the uh the
UN M Health Sciences Main
Campus research collaboration,
seed grant purposefully
to get faculty
from across
the university to work together
uh on uh on
ideas
particularly relating
to, to health and health
care. And as some of, you
know, that's one of the
um goals that
we've had for the university as
a whole. Um One of
our um
our um
fifth goal under our UN
M uh 2040
opportunity to find strategic
framework is one university.
It's that we really operate
as one integrated
system.
Rainforest innovations has
done some other work that I think is,
is helpful for, for
folks to know about and one
I'm particularly proud of and want
to mention is our tribal
entrepreneurship work. Uh
And so with support
from the uh
the US Economic Development
Administration, um
rainforest has been
helping to develop
um Native American
entrepreneurs
um in order
to um grow
businesses um
grow the economies
uh and um build the
communities of our Native
American communities
across the state.
A primary
tool for doing this is, is
both training for
small business owners
in
Native American
communities, but also
establishing liaisons
of
accomplished native
American entrepreneurs who
can help facilitate
and foster and
develop other
entrepreneurs within
uh within tribal
communities.
We also work with
um the state in, in various
ways. 11 way that I'll
mention is uh uh
with the New Mexico
Economic Development Department.
Uh And with the Office of
Strategy Science and
Technology. Uh we've
hosted um a set
of pitch competitions for
grant uh grant
funding. Uh And
in the uh the finals
of the um
a pitch competition that just
happened, OS TT
awarded $33.4
million in competitive
grant funding to companies
working on advanced energy
technologies and
also uh about
$760,000
of funding to
uh teams commercializing
ideas coming out of any of
New Mexico's research
universities, Un M
New Mexico Tech and
uh N MS U.
Um
I want to say just one
more thing about kind of
sort of where things are going,
lots of, lots of good
stuff happening at the University of New
Mexico of course. And, and
our number one goal
in our strategic framework
is advance New Mexico.
One idea that we've been
working on uh pretty
heavily over the last year or
so is developing a center
of excellence and substance use
disorders. Um
And, and we have huge
breath in that area across
the university. We obviously
have important clinical
programs in the
University of New Mexico
Hospital, uh important
research programs in the
Department of Psychiatry and the
medical school,
we also support
the center for alcohol, substance
use and addictions,
which is a
center
centered around
the main campus of the
university and particularly in
psychology, that
is actually a nationally
and internationally recognized
center on developing
preventative approaches
and treatment approaches for
substance use disorders.
So we really want to bring all that
together, bring
together the
technology ideas
that have come out in
the medical school of the creation
of new pharmaceuticals that help
treat addiction.
Um the kind
of of um
motivational uh
interventions that have
been developed through um
the Department of
Psychology and
really bring all of that together
into a much more integrated
whole. Uh And
uh so uh over time,
you, you may hear more about that
as we try and really develop this
into a center of excellence in
substance use disorders.
So I'll stop there and
again, welcome you to
the University of New Mexico
and to rainforest
innovations and
uh um hope you have a very
successful set of
meetings over the next few
days. >> Well, thank
you very much, Doctor Holloway.
We
impressive, building
impressive programs
and the dedication of
the university to the
to the furtherance of New Mexico's
health is something we've been really
impressed with. So, thank you so
much. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Any, any members of the committee with
any questions for Doctor
Holloway?
All right. Well, thank you
so much. Thank
you.
If you'll notice the agenda
is focused these three
days primarily
on what's
happening with Children, youth and
families.
And we're going
to start with a,
a
orientation to the
whole notion of the Children, youth
and families department,
what their charge is, what
their um
federal framework
is, what their state framework
is. And to do that,
we have child welfare
101
brought to us by the
legislative finance committee
staff,
Rachel Mercer
Garcia, the
principal analyst,
four CYFD
with the legislative
finance committee
and Nathan Eckert,
an
attorney
who's a senior fiscal
analyst at the legislative finance
committee. And so
we'll, we'll turn it over to
you all for our perm
course on how
CYFD
ought to be working.
I'm expecting.
>> OK. Is this sound
all right.
Uh Like you said, my name is Nathan
Eckberg. I'm one of the designated
staff uh for this
committee. Uh Before
that I was a, a program
evaluator for the legislative
finance committee for over 10
years, uh where I worked
not exclusively but a
lot on um early
child
uh care
and early child init
initiatives and child welfare
um issues. Uh with
me is uh Rachel Mercer
Garcia, who is the
analyst for
CYFD.
Um Today we're gonna be
presenting kind of
uh continuing our series
of uh what
we called 101, I
think uh briefs
on the agenda, but kind
of just a, a primer
on um
uh the child welfare
system. Uh Last
month, I think our, our
analysts did one on behavioral
health and
Medicaid. So, just continuing
along, uh, we'll be
presenting on child
welfare.
Uh So if you'll turn with me to
slide two, this is just a quick
roadmap of what we'll be looking at
today. Uh So
we'll be looking at the current situation.
Uh Key data and child
welfare trends.
Um an overview of how the child
welfare system is organized and
funded. And
then briefly, we'll talk about uh
levers for improving
the system uh that we
won't go into great depth
about this in this
presentation because
um it's my understanding that we
may revisit that uh
later on um
in a in a different hearing sort
of the evidence-based
options to improve some of
the things that we're gonna be talking about
today.
So, getting into the child welfare
trends uh here for New
Mexico on
slide four,
we talk about risk
factors and aces um
also known as
adverse uh childhood
ex uh
experiences.
Um So child safety is one of the
most important issues facing
the state. And New
Mexico has the highest rate
of adults with acess
or again, adverse childhood
experiences with
nearly 25%
having experienced four
or more
aces.
So this is important because
individuals with
more aces are at higher
risk of poor physical and
behavioral health
outcomes and
substance use disorders
amongst other things.
And Children exposed to
extreme neglect have
decreased brain development
and emotional regulation.
And moreover aces
can follow an intergenerational
pattern.
It's also important to note
that poverty is not neglect
or an ace,
but poverty is a risk
factor and New Mexico
has the highest
or is amongst the
highest um
has the highest poverty rate
uh in the nation.
In Fy 20
23% of
New Mexico Children were
living in
poverty.
So turning to slide
five
just kind of honing in on
that child maltreatment,
the rate of child maltreatment
per 1000 per
1000 Children in New Mexico
remains higher than the national
rate at 12.7
per 1000
Children compared to
7.7
nationally. And you can
see that they in the chart
here uh on the
slide with New Mexico
being the red bar
and the national rate
um there in
uh as the Black
Bar.
Uh So New Mexico's rate has
improved since 2020
when the rate was 14.9
per 1000 Children.
But again, still remains high
as you can see in that
chart.
Uh They're in the pie chart here
on the same slide. You can
see that
neglect is the leading
uh type of
maltreatment uh
followed by psychological
maltreatment and
physical
abuse.
Turning to slide
six, we
just talked about
maltreatment. But here
on this slide, six, we talked
about repeat maltreatment. And this
is, this is one of
those things that we really
want to see a downward
trend. Um However,
New Mexico is consistently
among the poorest
performing states when it comes to
repeat child
maltreatment.
And you can see that uh
in the red line here on the
chart,
New Mexico ranks
among the top
six states for repeat,
child repeat child
maltreatment within 12 months
of initial
allegation.
And if New Mexico had the
same rate of repeat
maltreatment as the
nation. And that's the
blue line here in the
chart.
Uh There would be close
to 360
fewer cases annually
of repeat
maltreatment.
So the leading drivers of child
maltreatment include
parental, substance abuse,
poverty,
domestic violence, parental
history of
trauma and other behavioral
issues. And
I think we'll talk a little bit more about
those um in later
slides.
Yep, here on chart,
excuse me, slide
seven.
So New Mexico has a variety of
risk factors associated with
child maltreatment.
Um
And among
child victims of maltreatment,
we have rates of
victims who
caregivers experience
substance use.
Um And this is data that comes
from federal government. So
by far the two leading risk
factors for child maltreatment.
And you can see that in the,
uh the chart here on, on the right
side,
the two leading
factors are
um caregiver,
alcohol and drug
use.
And you can see
um compared
to national risk factors, New
Mexico is higher there in
alcohol abuse and drug
abuse.
Uh Turning to slide
eight just a little
bit. >> Can I
ask, can you explain
why there's no New Mexico
risk factors for domestic
violence?
>> Uh Mr Chair
Representative, this data
comes from
AC F the administration of Children
and families and for some reason
in our 2022
data, um we
didn't report on that risk
factor. So I, I
imagine we have Children who
experience that risk factor,
but in that year
using the same data for all the
other states, we didn't have
reporting there. So that
may sort of be a data anomaly
for 2022.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you. Uh my concern
is that you just made a
statement that you can see
that the highest risk factor in New
Mexico is drugs and
alcohol when
nationally it's domestic
violence
and we just so happen to have
no state.
Um and, and, but we do have a
trend that our state
is above national
average.
>> And Mr Chair representative,
I will note that in prior
years, we
did have higher risk factors
when it comes to
the substance use
categories that we did have
reporting in those domestic
violence areas. And this
is specifically for
Children who are victims of
maltreatment and then looking at the
risk factors among their caregivers.
So you're correct
>> if members could hold their
questions for the end
otherwise this could
last the entire day.
Thank
you.
>> Ok, thank you Mr Chair. So
um back on to slide
eight, just a little bit
about foster care trends.
There are roughly
two
uh Children or two
youth.
Well, two per 1000
Children are also 2000
youth in custody.
And that is down from
3.2
per 1000 Children
in 2019
and also lower than the national
rate of three
per 1000 Children
or 3000.
Um
So there has been a decline
in in these
numbers um
but they are starting to kick
back up. So we do so
it is important to, to
keep track of these uh
of these numbers.
Um
So with 2000
Children in foster
care, uh we only have
roughly 1000 resource
homes in total um
including relative
placements uh which
make up a little bit
over half of all the
resource um
homes.
So, one of the Kevin S
findings was that we needed
more resource
homes. So that's
definitely one thing to, to keep
an eye
on.
So turning to slide
nine our
Cyt Protective Services
workforce,
Uh New Mexico has experienced
a longstanding challenges
related to the child welfare workforce,
particularly in protective
services. Uh This
challenge is not unique to our state
but it is a particular
challenge. And CYFD
has taken actions in the last
year related to this issue.
And uh Secretary Casares
will be here um
on Thursday and
will likely talk about
uh about these
issues.
Um So over time, the state has
appropriated more money for
protective services personnel
and Rachel will talk a lot more about
the uh the funding in
in the coming slides.
Um But you can see a decline
in build protective services
positions and high
rates of uh vacant positions
in protective services here
um on the charts on this
slide.
Um So this
is a measure. Uh the turnover
in protective services is a
measure we track and the rate
hovers around 32%
this year.
Um According to Annie E
Casey Foundation, turnover
rates among child welfare workers
average 30% nationally.
So we are above that, that
national rate. Well, annual
turnover rates
are at or below 12%
are considered optimal.
So
12% is the
optimal
uh considered
optimal in health care and human
services. Again,
we're at 32% and the
national rate is at
30%.
Uh Annie E Casey reports,
high turnover directly
impacts Children and families
served by child welfare
agencies and
is associated with more placement
disruptions time in
foster care, incidents
of child maltreatment and
reentries into foster
care.
Uh The department CYFD
has also historically had challenges
with high caseloads and protective
services. Um
As of this spring, the
agency was meeting targets
to caseloads among
certain workers.
Um Though these are
caseloads in the
aggregate
and there can be a real difference.
Um If you just look at these
numbers uh
at the individual level uh by
county or by region
of the
state.
OK. So going on uh to
slide 10,
just we just have a little bit of
information about how
the child welfare system
in New Mexico is organized.
I think it's easy to
kind of think that CYFD
is the only
um agency
that, that
we're talking about when we talked about
child welfare. But if
you look at this uh this
graphic on slide
11,
um when it comes to preventing
child maltreatment, there are
several agencies that are
involved. Uh
for example, services that
serve the general population
are located across
agencies um
including the health
care Authority or formerly
HSD that
runs the State's Medicaid
program and income
support the
early childhood education
and care department E ce
CD uh runs the
state childcare
program and home
visiting programs in which
any family can participate.
And as we move down this pyramid,
though, you'll see that
CYFD
is the one really who is
tasked with assessing and
addressing cases of child
maltreatment, including
abuse and
neglect.
So if you look at that graphic, we
have a CE CD
pe DDOH
uh HC A.
Um and then as, as we
go down towards that
maltreatment, um
We, we do see CYFD
there
um Switching
pages here to slide
12.
Uh Once a case of maltreatment
has occurred, there are a
variety of agency
involved in responding to those cases
as well.
Um So you can see the Department
of Public Safety has the legal
authority to take a child into protective
custody. Uh The
children's court come
into play. Um
And a judge can decide if
abuse and neglect has occurred
and makes determinations about
whether the Children may safely return
home. The health
care authority um
administrates ad
administers the Medicaid
program, which is a
primary funding source for children's
behavioral health treatment, foster
care and health care for
youth in custody.
And then a fairly new office. The
Office of Family
Representation and Advocacy
or R uh
provides legal
representation for Children and
families whose Children
are in the custody of
CYFD.
Slide 13
uh has just a brief
uh kind of
history of CYFD
over time.
Uh Cyfd came into
being after uh the
governor in 1991
convened the task
force uh
which ended up
creating CYFD with an
emphasis on prevention and
early
intervention
in 1992.
Um the Child and Adult
Protective Services
uh was transferred from HSD
to CYFD.
Uh over the years, you can see
different divisions that
uh were put
into statute that
uh that should exist
within CYFD
and that remained fairly
constant um until
2005, when
Legislation Trusts transferred
Adult Protective Services to the
aging and long-term
services Department.
And then most recently, in
2020
early childhood programs,
including child care
assistance, home, visiting,
etcetera, uh were
moved to the newly created
uh early childhood care and
education department.
Uh Today, the current situation
at CYFD uh
includes for service
areas
uh including juvenile
justice facilities, protective
services, behavioral health
and program
support.
Uh for so for slide,
14, I'm gonna turn it over to
Rachel to talk about some of
the uh spending that goes
on in the child welfare
system.
>> All right. Um So I'll sort
of start on slide
15 and talk a little
bit about the, the CYFD
budget at a high
level and then I'll walk
you through some of the targeted
appropriations you all made in
the last legislative session.
Um So overall,
the fy 24 operating
budget for CYFD
is roughly
$385
million. Um
Much of the
agency's budget is
general fund, but
about two
thirds is general fund and
the rest is federal funding either
directly to the agency
or is a transfer
from the Human Services Department,
Health Care Authority into
the agency. Um
Protective Services. Uh,
there are, as Nathan mentioned
sort of four program areas.
Those are the four program
areas in which you as the
legislature make
appropriations within the
agency. That's juvenile
justice, Protective
Services, behavioral
health and program
support. And you can
see in that, that
second graph sort
of the trend and change
over time in those
appropriations, um,
you all in particular
made significant
increases to
Cyfd. Um,
between Fy 21
and Fy 24 you could,
you can see some of those
increases. And
so that informed
um, the LFC recommendation
and ultimately the, uh, the
Fy 25
budget that you
all as a legislature adopted,
which maintained a relatively
flat operating budget
for Fy
25.
And part of that also,
if you look between the years
of Fy 21 and Fy
24 CYFD
had some pretty considerable
reversions and kind of
funds unspent. So that also
informed that decision,
um within
Cyfd Protective
Services is about
225
million. That's where a lot
of the federal funding is
either um for
federal title four E or
some other things. Um
General Fund makes up about
53% of Protective
Services. Um And
their budget in
that last chart, you can sort
of see, um protective
services spending growth
over time and the share
of that that's dedicated to,
devoted to prevention and
early intervention. And
so in
recent history,
prevention and early
intervention funding has
lived within protective
services. It can sometimes be a
little bit tricky to kind of tease
out what is spent on
prevention and early intervention
versus kind of
the the back end of the
system. But one of the
recommendations LFC
has made over time is
to shift funding
from the back end of the
system. We would, you know where foster
care occurs, very high cost
interventions to the front
end of the system, prevention
intervention and diverting
families from formal system
involvement. But you can
see that still
that funding makes up a relatively
small amount of the overall
protective services
budget.
Um If you turn with me
to slide at
16, um
I talk a little bit about
the CYFD appropriations
for Fy at 25.
So as I mentioned, the
legislature, you all
appropriated a relatively
flat operating
budget for CYFD
um but made some very
specific targeted
investments within
the grow um
or special appropriations.
And these were in that
category of the
three year appropriations
for a specific purpose
to pilot and
evaluate programs
um and
allows for some
tracking of the spending
of those funds and a measurement of
how are those investments
doing. And so I'll call out a
few of those. Um They
total within that three
year, those three year grow
pilots. There's about
18.6 million.
Um and those targeted
investments include
1.69 to
incentivize master's
level social work
licensure, um
4.2 million to
expand and implement
differential response
statewide. So, um
back in 2019, I
believe you all um
passed a bill that would implement
a differential response or
multilevel response
system in our
state, but we really haven't seen that
implemented at scale. So
this money would allow
um for some of that expansion,
um 9 million to
implement evidence-based
um community
based prevention and early
intervention and
then 3.75 million
to recruit support or retain
resource, foster families
um as well as treatment, foster
care providers. So
these targeted appropriations
are really kind of focused on
where do we have some significant
challenges in the system
and allow for tracking of those
things over time and an evaluation
of whether they work. In
addition, House
Bill two reauthorized
several special appropriations
made to CYFD that
had gone unspent
in prior years. So
in particular,
3 million that had previously
been appropriated
checked
yesterday and I think less than
100,000 has been spent to
date for workforce
development. Several
years ago, the
department,
following the Kevin settlement
had developed a workforce
plan and so these are funds
to help that
plan that hadn't
yet been spent. There
was some language
that targeted that
workforce plan specifically
to social workers. That
language was
vetoed. I know
Mr Chair, you've pointed
that out in the past
and then there was also a
$20 million appropriation
made several years ago
to increase behavioral health
provider capacity in
our state, specifically for
children's behavioral health,
that money initially
with appropriate to
HSD has gone
unspent.
And so the
House Bill two this year
reauthorized that
appropriation with a little bit
of kind of tightened language.
It notes now that
10 million goes to CYFD
10 million to the health care authority
and articulates the
specific intended purpose
being to increase
the number of behavioral health providers
who are delivering evidence based
services. So it's really a capacity
building investment. So those
two things were also
reauthorized.
So that's sort of the overview
of uh the fy
25
budget. And then if you look
at slide 17,
um we have noted
as I, as I noted there,
Cyft receives a considerable
amount of federal funding
um but is likely really
under leveraging the
federal resources that are
available. Um So
I'm 17, we
note in
2018, the
federal government passed the Families
First Prevention Services
Act as part of
federal title 40
the intention there is really
to expand
prevention and early
intervention services that are
evidence based and divert
families away from formal
system involvement.
The, the, the uh
funding does have some
restrictions that specifically
notes the eligible
populations to receive
those services and I I call them
out here from the bill language.
Um Those are populations
in which your child is a candidate
for foster care
um but can remain
safely at home with intervention
or a child in foster care
is pregnant or parenting.
But the federal legislation
allows for states to define
some of what, what some of
those categories are. And
state, some states have been able to
define those pretty
expansively. Um
To date, 46
states and tribal governments
have submitted plans.
Our state submitted a plan
that was not approved
and it is our understanding
Square Fty has received some
feedback about improvements
um and plans to resubmit,
but we are now one of
five states with
plans that have not been
approved and it's really a
missed opportunity to leverage
federal funding
um to, to
deliver prevention
and intervention programs to
families. And so this is one
area if you look
back on those special appropriations,
part of um
why the
sort of targeted pilot
investments is
because um
particularly in the area
of prevention and intervention
programs, the bill language
specifies that we should be
implementing programs that can be
picked up with federal funding
over time. And so the idea
with some of those special appropriations
would be to allow to get the
programs up and running. That could
then bill either
Medicaid or Federal title
four E if we can get our plan
approved. So
that's sort of a, an opportunity
for us as a state.
Um So that's sort of
the, the overview of
the budgetary picture and then I'll
pass it back to Nathan to talk a
little bit about high level
how the system might be
improved.
>> Thank you, Rachel and thank you Mr
Chair.
So on slide 18
or yeah, 18,
how can we, how can the
system be improved after hearing
about all these uh
statistics that
can seem a bit, you know,
overwhelming or
um uh
Dyer. Um
One thing that's happening right now
is uh the 2024
Senate memorial five called
for a task force um
to be convened by the Legislative
Finance Committee. Uh
the first
um meeting of that
task force took place
uh not too long ago.
Um
And we do have Senator Lopez
here who's on the task force and also
uh sponsored the uh
memorial that, that formed that
task force. Um
So that
the bill uh named a few
topics that the task force was
supposed to look at
um including
the uh CF
D's mission values and uh
organization compared to
national best practices,
uh implementation of
diff differential or, or, or
alternative response
um availability
needs and gaps in existing
services, best
practices. Um
workforce leveraging
federal funding, juvenile
justice and equity
considerations. Uh So
that task force will meet uh
monthly. Um
Those um
meetings are open to the
public are streamed
and then uh participants have
an option to
uh I think we'll
have an option to attend in person
or virtually.
So we're trying to make it very,
very open and accessible
to get um the
most benefit as possible from
it. So
that task force will make a recommendation
to the legislature and the governor
by, by November 15th of
this year, uh for
consideration during the legislative
session
on page 20. Just
talk a little bit about uh recent
evaluation findings and
recommendations from the
Legislative Finance Committee
over the last few years. Uh
The Finance
committee or LFC staff
have come out with
a number of uh reports
that really focus on best
practices, evidence-based
programs and
kind of recommendations for improving
the system.
Um
So some of the findings
just find
that those steps taken by the
legislature and CYFD
to promote preventative measures
are promising
prevention should be expanded
by continued investments and
enhance piloting efforts.
And the state may wish to make
increased investments in a proven
early intervention programs.
Um One of the reports
LFC puts out, I think
um every other year now
is the early childhood accountability
report. In the most
recent report. In 2023
we pointed out that
funding and like
Rachel talked about funding is
no longer the main
barrier to these
programs.
Um It's
mostly uh
implementation
issues.
So as as those programs
expand with more and more money being
pumped into them,
you know, are they being implemented
to fidelity and
are the best
practices still being implemented
on, on that larger
scale?
Um Early childhood services
can lead to positive outcomes.
We know that um
and investments have increased by
over 50% since
fy 23. Just
you know, going back to that point,
that money is no longer
the the main
barrier.
Uh So slide
21 is kind of a
a teaser
to the more
in depth discussion that we might
have at a future hearing
on these preventative
issues on these uh
issuess of best
practices.
Um
But so
L fc's reports and
findings kind of tend
to fall
within this framework or these
four buckets. And
that's
to implement evidence-based
prevention and early intervention
programs to, to support
families and to divert
formal system involvement
uh to recruit retain
and support uh
professional social
workforce
and or social work
workforce and expand
access to behavioral health
and other services for Children and
adults and
strengthen oversight and
accountability
mechanisms.
So, um
when we talk about this in the future,
uh we can, we can get
into kind of
um
individual programs that we
have found to be effective
in the state including alternative
or differential response
uh home, visiting
nurse, family partnership.
Um And we
can, we'll get into a more in depth
discussion on return on investment
for these programs
and kind of get into
what works, why
it works and what kind of
uh benefits we could expect to see
from
them.
Uh So with that, that kind of
concludes our formal
presentation.
Um So I
think we'll stand for
questions.
>> Um
Thank you very much and,
and I think
we give everybody on the committee a chance
to ask some questions.
Um But we'll start
with you, Senator Stefanik,
you, you raised your hand first. Well, then
we'll just give everybody
a chance to ask
up to three minutes of
questions. Three
or
three,
three. And as
noted before, she is a
very vigorous,
rigorous
timekeeper,
so
>> vigorous Mr Chair, there, there
might be some other adjectives
that, that folks
use.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and good
morning committee.
The I have a
couple of statements and
questions, I'll do it all
together so that they can
respond. On
page four, we mentioned
Aces and I'm wondering if this
committee could think about
some statewide
initiatives for
Aces
because
we have talked about this
and had presentations about
this over the years
and it continues.
We're at 25%. I think
it's probably higher
because of all the
hidden
individuals that are outside
of Cyfd.
So maybe we could think about
that some statewide initiatives.
And then
I'd like to know the
intersection
of, of
with CYFD.
And on page
nine, it looks like the
caseloads have
lightened for the
employees and that's all.
Thank
you,
>> Mr Chair, Senator
Stefani.
I acknowledge your comment
about a,
let me know if you would like me
to share anything but my sense was, it was for
the committee when it comes to
Ofra. So, um
Ofra provides the legal
representation for
Children and
respondents whose
cases are involved in the child
welfare system.
Previously,
that um
uh that function
was a
contract that lived
within the administrative
office of the courts.
And I believe there
was a task force that sort of
identified challenges
and problems with that system,
including quality of
representation and, and
other things starting
this year. This is the first
year. So you all as a legislature
created a new
agency, the Office of Family
Representation and Advocacy
pulled that out of the court
system. It now stands
alone. Um They
are working on a variety of
things um related to
improving the quality of
representation that Children
and respondents receive.
That includes shifting
to more
um employed
attorneys as opposed to contract
attorneys. They also
are beginning this year going to
have a pilot program
that includes and, and
there was grow
appropriation for this purpose
to provide multidisciplinary
teams um
within those legal
services.
And that is informed by
national research
that suggests when
um both Children
and respondents receive
high quality legal
representation, they
move to the point of permanency
more quickly um when
interacting with um the
the children's court system.
So that is um please let me know if
you have additional questions, but that's sort
of a high level of what that agency
does and its um
genesis over time.
>> So it sounds like there's not
much
interaction between the
department and Ofra
>> Mr Chair, Senator
Stefani. I might
recommend asking
to more about sort of the day
to day interaction,
but that agency
provides the legal representation
for the Children or the families in those
cases. >> OK. And the
employee
caseloads
>> page Mr
Chair Senator Stefani.
So again, that might be an area
to explore a little bit more
with the department. This
data comes from a
monthly desktop report
that our um
team receives and
what we have seen is in some
cases, in the
aggregate
caseloads have improved,
particularly in investigations
and placement. I know. So
t has done some work, for
example, in resetting
compensation
ranges for some of those
roles. And so in the aggregate,
there have been some improvements in
those areas though
also not
yet in the permanency planning
roles. I will not. And I
imagine that the department may
elaborate that that is in the
aggregate. And so there are certainly
geographies in the state or
individual caseloads that are
not meeting some of those
benchmarks and standards. But
this is a measure that we do track
over
time.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. I do, I
do have some questions.
Um So
on page
15,
um
there's a bar
there that and I, I
think you spoke to it
a little bit but
in terms of prevention
um spending is
low.
Um And then
um also
on page 20 it
talks about um
how early childhood
services can lead to positive
outcomes. But there's been a,
there's been problems with implementation
and oversight. So
can you speak to both of
those in terms of prevention
programs and
what are the issues that are
preventing
them from being
implemented?
>> Um So Mr
Chair Representative, um
I'll talk a little bit about the
prevention spending while also
acknowledging um to kind
of that slide of the pyramid,
Cyt is not the only
place in our state where
we have place kind of
prevention and
intervention. So if
you think about at the population
level, income support,
for example, um
or um home
visiting that exists within
the early childhood care and education
department are certainly
programs designed
to improve child well being
and, and prevent maltreatment
with that being said within
CYFD prevention
and early intervention is really
sort of focused on
those higher risk
cases. Um
And so, um first,
we'll acknowledge this is not all the
state spends on prevention
and early intervention. This is the
prevention and early intervention
spending that occurs within
CYFD.
This is
in part connected to what I mentioned
about not fully leveraging
Federal title four in the
Families First
Services
Act. So the federal government
has identified a range
of evidence based programs that
have really been studied and are
proven to
reduce child
maltreatment in high risk
risk cases or to
intervene in cases
lower in
cases in which
uh maltreatment has
already occurred. But services can
be delivered within a
home setting and don't
result in the removal of a
family. Um What we
have seen is that historically,
we like many states
put a lot of our resources on
the back end once a
family engages and is
formally removed and in the
foster care system,
and what we have recommended over
time is trying to put
more of those resources
in that targeted way to
intervene in a home
setting and avoid a
removal. We've seen some
growth in that spending over time.
You'll see the tiny little bars ticking
up, but we really still put a lot
more money on the back end. And
so, um
when it comes to opportunities
for funding, that's where
the title for a prevention
funding could really come in
um to
um to maximize
that the legislature, you all have
made some targeted investments
to increase that prevention
spending. So, if you look at
Um on the next
slide, the special
appropriations for CWA
FD this year, I would
call out to that are really
targeted to those things.
First, um
differential response
statewide, which is a
response that is an
alternative to an
investigation when maltreatment
has occurred. And the
second being 9 million for
those community based prevention
and early intervention efforts
and we likely have more
opportunity when it comes to
funding for federal title.
40. In terms of
what programs
you know, some of those really
that are targeted for high-risk
families. The federal government again,
as I mentioned, has developed a pretty
robust clearing house, the programs
that are proven to do that
we as a state
um are are
largely not implementing
those that are targeted at the
very highest risk families.
And that's where Nathan mentioned. I
think Asander, you may
have us uh at
either your July
or August meeting talking about
prevention and intervention
um and can bring
in some more information about what
specific programs
and that kind of thing. And, and actually,
for our Senate Memorial five task
force, we have reached out to several
folks nationally who can
come in and talk about how are other
states um pursuing
those, those evidence-based
approaches? >> Thank
you. >> And actually,
that's in Taos in July
that we, we penciled
in another presentation
on CUFD
by the LFC
stuff,
Representative Ferrari.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair,
excuse me.
Um It concerns me
that we still don't have
an approved plan.
Um Can you tell us some of
the barriers that are
um keeping us from
achieving
that,
>> Mr Chair representative,
I'll talk at a high level
and I would encourage you when the
secretary is here to go
deeper with the
CYF CD
team. I think there are
probably two
categories
for title for
that states have to consider.
One is the targeting of the
population.
And so it is my understanding we may
have received some feed back in
that area. If you look
at slide 17,
the Families First Prevention
Services Act does
say the targeting of
programs have to be to two
categories of population,
a child who is a candidate for
foster care. Though we can define
what that is within
certain parameters and a child
in foster care who's pregnant or
parenting. So it is
my understanding. The first is some
feedback around targeting of
population. And the
2nd may be what
programs we're choosing to implement
and whether they
are within the
programs that have been
identified by the federal government
that they will pay for
within title 40. So
that is my high level understanding
and I would encourage you all to kind
of learn more. As I understand
the team is kind
of really thinking
about our plan and reworking
it.
>> Thank you. And
also um
one of
the
uh aces
reduction initiatives
is the Anna Age eight
Institute and
also having um
within different communities
100% community
program that will help,
you know, not just
Children, but also the families
as a whole. Um
to address those.
Um
So
also the
budget for
CYFD,
um it was mentioned, it was
like flat
um is, but
they put funding
into other programs.
Is there a reason why
we haven't been able to
increase um
their
budget
for the department itself?
Is it because there's so many vacancies
they don't need the funding
or can you
tell us more about that?
Yeah, >> so
Mr Chair representative
and I can share with you some about
what informed the LFC
recommendation which the,
the legislature ultimately
adopted on the operating budget
side.
The first trend is if you look
at slide 15, there
was significant
growth in the
CYFD budget between
Fy 21 and
Fy 24.
And one of the things that we
saw, um if you want, I can
pull up the, the specific numbers.
But one of the things that we saw was
that research, the, the
agency wasn't really able to get
the dollars out, out the door.
They were, they were had
um high
reversions. I, I think when
we looked at fy 23 it was
looking like about 5 to
6 million. And
in Fy 24 it was like a
$50 million increase. And
so what we were seeing was
um challenges
kind of translating
those increased investments
into things like hiring.
So that was one of the things that
informed, um was
that there had been sort of
over the last few years,
um, high rates of
reversion. The
second was
sort of wanting to
make targeted
investments that you all
could track over time.
And so while the
operating budget is,
is flat
for fy 25 you
all made some pretty significant
target investments on
the special appropriation
side.
>> Representative
Thompson. And then we'll
start after her, then we'll go to you
Representative Vincent and come back this
way and then we'll go to
Senator Tullman, Senator
Lopez. We'll give everybody
a chance. >> Thank you,
Mr Chair.
So page
seven, that's concerning
to me that there is
essentially no,
I mean, I don't know why, but
there's no new Mexico data
on, on
domestic violence.
And it may,
it concerns me that
maybe the thinking
is, well, if we don't report it,
it can't look bad.
Um, and that's
true, but to me, it
looks worse. Um,
it's like there's something
is being hidden, so I
don't really need an answer on
that. I'm just, I'm very concerned
about that. And then in
terms of, you know, we keep
increasing the funding
and there's no
implementation. It's
really frustrating. I mean,
we all know that
getting the money,
we thought at least was the
hard part, getting it through the
appropriations
process is, is the
hard part and we do
that only to
find out that
it's just, it's a waste.
It was a waste of our time to
do. And, you know,
we see CYFD
in the news all the
time, you know, that
things are not going
well and here's this
big pot of money sitting
there, not it, money
isn't the answer to everything, but
it sure helps. So
I'm just kind of putting it out
there that, that
we can't do that anymore.
We need to start taking
everything seriously
and using the funding
that, that we appropriate
to CYFD or any
of the other departments
that are involved in this.
And I, I guess
I'm throwing down the gauntlet
that me
personally and my committee
in the house is going to start
taking a really deep look
at how things
are not going. So,
thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative Vincent, and we'll
just move right along this side over
here. >> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
She pretty much asked
my question,
but why
are we not implementing?
Do we not have
direction? Do
we not have the talent?
And I mean that respectfully
why is, why is our
program's not getting?
I mean, we always hear
that we don't have the money
now, the money is
available and there's no
implementation.
Ok.
How do we, how do we
nudge them along to
implement,
you know, things to help
the
Children?
>> Uh Mr Chair,
Representative Vincent, I know
you all have some space and
opportunity um to talk
with the agency
um tomorrow and that might be a
place to explore. What are the
challenges some that,
that we know exist are
things like the
agency has persistently
had very high turnover.
Um Nathan pointed
out, for example, in Protective
Services, um
a 32% turnover
rate. And so, while the agency
has made efforts and
focused attention on
hiring retention
is a real challenge. And so that
can be a barrier to
implementation.
Another is that, you know, that
some of these programs
are about getting scaled
up, particularly
on the prevention and early intervention
side. And so that might also be a
place for you all to explore
with the department. What are the
challenges you all are
experiencing when it comes to
implementation?
>> Yeah. And if I may uh Mr
Chair and representative,
when we talk about, I think
implementation,
it's I think
important to note that we're not just talking
about CYFD and
we're also
kind of talking about the families as
well. Um When we look at home
visiting a program that has
been proven to
be effective um when
implemented correctly,
uh We find that
most families enrolled
in that program are
likely not
realizing
the expected benefits because
the family itself is not
completing the program.
So in the most recent
report that we did on this in
20 fy 23
we found that only 7% of
families completed the program.
So again, E
CD is providing the program,
they're providing the resources.
Um but the families
for whatever reason are
not completing the program, so
that 7% of families
that completed is down from
11% that had completed
in fy 22. So
still not a high number,
but that number continues to
decline. So,
um so it's not
nece it's not always the
department, but it's, it's
ways of finding families to
get engaged in these programs
that are provided. Another
um example of implementation
we find is uh
oversight of pre-kindergarten.
So, pre-kindergarten is a program
that the legislative
finance committee has been able
to prove is highly,
highly effective. We've been able to
track students
from pre-kindergarten
all the way up to college and
have seen a positive result of
pre K but
quality can be difficult
um as both E
CE CD and the public
education department
um have,
you know, roles to play
in that program.
So you have different educational
requirements for teachers uh
whether you know it's a program
implemented by E CE CD or PE
D and there's different uh
reporting requirements
or different measurements
for quality. So
there, so there are many aspects
of when we talk about implementation.
I think >> I know
I'm done, but just,
I wanted to throw the word
mandatory out to you,
just making things mandatory where
you make the families
finish.
Thank
you,
>> Representative.
>> Thank you chair and thank you,
Representative.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask
for briefer
answers because as you
know, we are in strict timelines
um just so clarification,
it's my understanding we've spent
only $1 million
of the allotted, but
for our workforce. The CYFD
is that, that's correct. That's
what my understanding
was, >> Mr
Chair representative as
of yesterday, it was less
than 100,000. So that
money has been reappropriated,
>> ok. And I, and I do
understand that, you know,
and I will ask CYFD
tomorrow, you
know, there's timelines when the
money actually get released.
We know when it was approved but
released is a different thing
and, and then you have to ramp
up your workforce. I understand
that, but I just want to
clarify on
slide nine protective
Services personnel
appropriations and
filled FTEs.
Looks like we filled less
FTEs.
Correct?
>> Uh Mr Chair
Representative. That is correct though. There
has been an uptick in 24
ok. >> So we have
dramatically since
2021
filled less FTEs.
We have only spent
$100,000.
How do we lower case
levels? How did
that happen?
>> So, Mr Chair representative,
that's probably a question
for the department.
>> Yeah,
Representative
Jones. >> Thank
you Mr Chair.
So I have, I can
echo the same concerns
and most of my questions
have been asked, but I, I
just wanted to clarify
one thing
on slide
17.
Um New Mexico is one
of the five states without an an
approved plan. Did
we ever submit a
plan?
>> Uh Mr Chair
representative, we have submitted a
plan. It has not yet been
approved.
>> Do you know when that plan was
submitted?
>> Um Mr
Chair representative, I would look
to it a couple of years
ago. First
time.
Yeah, Mr Chair representative,
the first submission was a couple
of years ago.
Thank
you.
>> Mm
mm
>> Yeah. Thank you Mr Chair.
Sorry,
that was a thank you for everyone.
Yes.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. I set my
timer here
so
I'm really tired of messing around
with child stuff and not fixing
it. It's very frustrating. I'm
not mad at you guys. I'm just extremely
frustrated
that
we're the worst.
I'm over here. I'm like, can
we be the worst in everything?
And we have all
these aces
and yet we're the
second
lowest removal
rate
that's concerning
and we have got people
that are torturing Children.
We have that woman that disturbed her child
to death, her special needs, child
to death
and it gets very frustrating
because we keep putting
money in there. And that's
the first question. Let me just answer that real quick
with a real quick answer. I tried
to give 20 million to CUFD
that didn't get approved, but then they
found out there was $20
million floating around
and they lost it, but now they
found it. So where is that?
$20
million?
>> Uh Mr Chair
representative, that might be a more
targeted question for
CYFD. Um If it's the
20 million for behavioral
health, that was, it
had gone unspent and so it's
been reappropriated,
>> ok? Because that was very
concerning to find out that money was
lost. I don't know how this, so I
guess what I see the bigger pictures.
We're all of us. This is
bipartisan. We care
deeply about trying to fix this
issue. We're all trying to work at stuff.
We're all trying to present bills, we're all trying to do
stuff, we pass
things and then there's zero
oversight and I think that's the
biggest frustration for all of us is
that ok? We've passed all
this. So we're trying to do this stuff and it always
seems like we're trying to do stuff
and nothing's getting accomplished.
Um, we have
got a very
high rate of drug
abuse and
you know what preventable measures
are we doing for that? I mean, until
we address with these core issues of the
alcoholism, the drug addiction, we
get serious about that
and the core issues of Children that
are being abused, it's
gonna be very hard to fix this
system. And then I get
concerned about on
page 17 where we're leaving people
at home. Ok. That's fine in some
cases. But
I worry about
leaving Children at home that
shouldn't be there, that Children,
they need far more over
oversight, the Children that are being
abused
and it's such a huge
issue. I mean,
it is nice to see that housing
and poverty is not on this list.
It's an issue of alcohol and
drug addiction that has to be
addressed
So I'm worried about so many
things with this, but
mostly the lack of oversight,
it's almost like we need to put
a huge thumb on Cyfd
and say everything you have to do needs to be
approved by us. Come to
us. You need to tell us what you're doing with the money.
Are you doing what you need to do with the
money? Is this being implemented?
How, where's it out in the process?
Because we're
passing these things and they're just going
off into space.
And quite frankly, I'm very tired of
that and I think everybody else is.
So I really don't have a question,
I'll send my questions for all this stuff.
But until we address the
core root issues of
breaking this chain, it's never
going to stop. Thank you,
sir. Uh Sorry, I was calling Mr
Speaker.
>> Thank you, Representative,
uh, Senator Tallman and then
Senator
Lopez.
>> Yeah.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Um
See you here. Thank
you. Right.
I don't often agree with the
representative Lord, but
I, so I
certainly wholeheartedly
agree with her frustration
or share her frustration.
So originally I had six questions,
but since I'm limited to three
minutes, that would only give
me 30 seconds of questions.
So now I've reduced it down to
three.
I was hoping you wouldn't count
that.
So,
uh, I,
I was
surprised,
interesting. You said the problem
is not funding
it's accountability.
So
I guess I was under the wrong impression
I thought that
the reason they're having trouble with
staffing,
it's a double edged
sword that they, they, they aren't
paying
enough to keep people and then they have
a lot of vacancies and they are paying
enough to fill those vacancies. So
that's not
true.
>> Uh, so
Mr Chair Senator
Tallman, I imagine it's a, a
complex issue
at, um, when
it comes to appropriations
for CIFD between
Fy 21 and Fy
24 there were significant
increases in
appropriations
in part to address
staffing. Um
during that period of
time, the agency
did have challenges
filling and retaining
staff. So, in that
particular area,
um area,
there have been significant appropriations
that have gone unspent and there
are um
I imagine some complex things
there, there are some additional
challenges they are facing and things
like drawing down federal funds
that may be making
um the problem
more complex. Um
But high level. Yes.
>> So
the,
um,
so
you did,
you only got a 1% or a
flat
increase this year?
So what was, what was it LF
CS recommendation
for? Was that,
was it flat,
>> Mr Chairman
Senator Tallman?
Yes. The legislator
legislature adopted the
fc's recommendation on the
operating budget side.
>> Thank you.
Um
On page 21
you talk about
accountability.
Um That, that,
that's a problem I runs
throughout state government as far
as I'm concerned. We don't,
we don't hold the education
department
accountable. We, it's the same
problem in the health
services and,
and CYFD. It's a common
theme throughout, throughout
the, uh
um, and I think one of
the reasons is, uh
our sessions are too
short
and uh we don't have
adequate staff to help
us hold
the uh departments
accountable. That's just
a,
um,
so
that's in
another,
how can you hold the people
accountable when the
department heads change
so often? And that
makes it difficult to implement
programs when you
don't have consistency
at the top level. That's another
reason why I think we,
we're failing
um,
evidence-based programming.
I, one time I asked a
David Abbey who I
think was
outstanding um
employee and is writing a
book gonna be,
it may be out already. It's gonna
be published by the
University
of
New Mexico Press.
And I asked him, you know why
at
that time, we ranked about
number 38 in
spending and number 50 in
educational outcomes. Now we moved
up to 3534.
So why is that? We gave you four
reasons. One was, we don't use evidence-based
programming. Well,
it's a problem in the education
department. It's a problem in CYFD.
It's a problem everywhere.
And I guess I'm a huge
advocate for the
space program. I don't know why the heck
we can't get
departments to do that. I think
it's a big
problem.
Ok. Maybe I'll sneak it
in later. Thank
you.
>> And we do have for this
section. We do have up till
1030. So there may be a few
minutes at the end for
questions that are just
burning in
your craw that you just have to
ask. So keep that in mind
if there's one that's burning,
get ready to have it
extinguished,
Senator
Lopez,
>> uh, thank you, Mr
Chair. Um
I appreciate the presentation,
um, from our, our team
members here.
There's, there's a lot of information
Mr Chair that we've heard
over the years with regards
to Cyfd,
uh the way I look at
this, um
Yeah, there was, there were questions asked
during session um if
CYFDN is a cri is
in a crisis and yes, we
are. But Mr Chair,
I believe our state is in one
when we look at the issues of domestic
violence,
intimate partner, intimate
partner, violence,
um you know, sexual
assault, I mean, there, there's a whole
sundry of issues
in our state.
And um
although I know that, you
know, the Senate Memorial Five Task
Force is working,
of course, um with, with
many different entities as
well as the secretary who's
also participating in the task
force.
Um It, it
also is a systems
issue
and I believe Mr
Chair that I'm hoping that
as we enter the new legislative
session and come out of it,
that our communities also
need to take ownership of
what's happening
in our own communities.
Um We can't just leave it to
government. We
also have to
um I think own
up for what is happening
in community
and part of that Mr Chair
when we talk about gun
violence, we talk about so
many other issues.
Um You know, with Cyfd, Mr
chair, you have CYFD,
but we also have the Courts.
Um, you know, there's, there's,
it's a partnership
that I think needs some
work. Um,
because, uh, I
mean, there's just so much and I could
go on, I guess at, at nauseam
about what my, my
concerns are, but
I look forward to the rest of this
interim and see
what we can come up and working, of course,
with the executive, you know, with
Secretary Casados and who,
you know, others, but
it's a systems
issue
and schools are part of
it. Our health care system
is part of it. You know, mental
health, you
know, we talk about rehab
services, the addictions that are
there, people are hurting
and they resort back to
taking care of themselves in the
ways that they do and it
hurts our Children.
And when we
have a society that is
doing this,
I only think if, if,
um if we're not able to find
a way that communities can
take ownership
and see how we reach out to
people. Um I think
that's also part of it
and having get off the
campaign trail. I've talked to
many of my constituents who
need help.
They're looking for services, they
want to do the best that they
can. But
where are we? I mean, you
know, our, our health, our mental
health care system was destroyed
on a previous gubernatorial
administration
and we're still recovering from that
COVID did a lot
and I, I just believe Mr Chair
that I'm hoping that this is the
beginning of a conversation
but not the end
because it's gonna take, I
think an effort from all of us as
leaders that are
elected, working in
community um to let
our communities know that we're here to work
with them. Um
because it's not just one entity,
it's all of us working together.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator.
Um I have
a couple of questions and then we'll see if
we still have a little bit of time.
We, we can let others.
It seems to me that,
that the numbers, there were
some surprising numbers for me.
I I was surprised that
that the, that the number
of kids in foster care
isn't a lot higher. I had
been under the impression that we
were taking more kids in.
Uh I was surprised at the caseload
size.
Um
Then I started thinking, where
do we get those numbers?
We get those numbers
from
decisions made by the
state centralized
intake right sky.
Have we done an assessment
of Sky and how it's working
and whether it's
actually
screening
appropriately
cases in or
out of,
of
attention from the
department?
>> Yeah. Uh So mister
Chair LFC staff
have not done an evaluation
that touches on that area.
Um though the agency
I know is doing some internal
work, so they may have some
information about looking
at those
processes.
>> So that that might be another
question to ask, uh, the,
the secretary coming in.
It's a little bit, it's analogous
to the crime
statistics. The
police department announced the crime
is down. Well, that could mean
there's fewer crimes being
committed or it could mean there's
fewer crimes being reported
or it could mean that the department
has changed its definition of what
a crime is. There's lots
of ways to, to fudge
the numbers and, and I
just ii, I guess
particularly on the caseload
size, I
I it's just hard to understand
why the turnover would be as large
as it is with
caseloads, as
manageable as they
are being
reported.
>> Um Mr Chair, I would
clarify that is the
number in the aggregate.
And so in our conversations with
the department, certainly they
note there are
wide variances
when it comes potentially
to a geography or an
individual caseload, but they
get reported up at the
aggregate
level.
>> The department
had requested money for a
family services
division in their
budget request.
And I know the LFC
recommended
recommendation did not
include that uh
but they could, could they
on their own, go ahead and develop
it. And are they doing
so,
>> Mr Chair? I
imagine CFD will
talk about their work when it
comes to the Family Services
Department Division.
Certainly the agency has the
authority to restructure
and change reporting structures
and has done that to elevate
family services when
it comes to their budget
for fy 25
the LFC
foundation did not
recommend pulling
out and creating
a new division.
Um but did make,
when you look at those targeted
investments on
the special appropriation
side funding for the
that type of work
differential response, community
based prevention and intervention,
just not the creation of a new
program.
>> Yeah, I, I guess I, I had
favored their creating
that when I, when I heard about it
at the Kara Summit last
year because
um I thought it gave them
a chance to
differentiate in the public's
mind between their police
function, which their
investigative staff do
and the family
services supportive
function that this
new division might,
might,
might have a better image in the public's
mind than, than the current
uh
investigators do which,
which are seen
as people that take your kids away.
Um But
anyhow, I guess we'll, we'll, we'll
ask that of the secretary
tomorrow.
Um
There was one other question I wanted
to ask about, oh, now that
the Substitute Care Advisory
Council has been
defunded
is that, that's accurate, right?
We're not funding them this
year.
>> Um Mr Chair.
So for the past couple of
years, the LFC
recommendation has
included um
moving
the SC AC
to the
courts that is more in
alignment with the way that other
states structure
that it has been
done through a special appropriation.
It would have required
legislation to also move
SC AC and that didn't happen.
So that funding was
vetoed. But the recommendation
has been to move the
funding um
from the regulation
and licensing department
to kind of a different
location in state government. >> So they
continue to operate and they
still have a budget.
>> So Mr
Chair, it is my understanding
that RLD sort of internally
funds
thatl
uh Mr Chair.
Yes, they are located
within the regulation and licensing
department.
>> These are very informative
meetings. I very
very
anybody else have
questions that you want to ask?
We have five more minutes
if we've cut
you off. Yes,
representative Lord, you've,
you've, you've got three
minutes. >> Yes. Thank you, Mr I'll
be really brief. I was
going back and looking at
the car
recommendations
that they placed and the
vast majority of the car families are not
receiving the support that they need,
which is huge with substance
treatment and
case magic screen identification
of substance abuse of newborn
should be improved. Is anything being
done to work on
that?
>> So, Mr Chair
and Representative Lord,
we did do that uh
report in
October of 2023
on the Comprehensive Addiction
and Recovery Act.
Um
So we did find
that not
all infants
born substance exposed were being
identified and of those that
were being identified.
Um The families
were not opting again. It's a,
it's a voluntary program, they
were not opting to
get
treatment.
Um What we do
know is CYD
as early as last
week has postings ono
for I think
six new
uh Karen Navigator
positions of
17 excuse me.
Um And that includes uh Karen
Navigators in different
regions of the state, including Santa Fe,
Las Cruces gallop,
um also uh manager
position and several
supervisor positions.
So we know that the
um the department is
trying to hire on those positions.
And those navigators
would, um,
if, if
you know, it comes to fruition
would address some of these issues
and that they will be trained
to help families fill out those
plans of care that are part of the
carer process. Um,
would help families
get to treatment,
even help
with trans transporting the
parents to the treatments.
And, um, would also,
they would try to help connect
families with the treatment
services that
they identify in the plan
of care. >> Thank you,
Mr and I appreciate that we're doing something
on that and we, but we need to do something
on the treatment and because I think
handing somebody to
something, say you promise to go
to 12 step is not working.
It either has to be mandated or different
types of care or stronger
encouragement because 12
step doesn't work for everyone. Most people
need more of a behavioral care
type a treatment
and that's not something that's being
offered. And I think as long as we
continue to just say, do you promise to
go to 12 steps or will you go to
12 steps? And that's nothing
bad against 12 step program. We need other
resources and we need,
I'm, I'm thinking at
some point, we have to say, look, this
needs to be mandated if you want to keep
your baby and you should because it's your
child and you have a drug
addiction, we need to get serious
about treating that and not just
saying we suggest or we think or
whatever. Thank you,
Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Just a
little bit of a follow up to
Representative Lord.
Um I
called, I spoke with
Doctor Andy, she who
was kind of the the
godfather of much of
early childhood in New Mexico.
If you ask me and
we talked about the car
a program which he was
largely behind
And he said he saw
two glaring
problems is that
the people who have
been um who have
been hired to,
to deal with these families
don't necessarily have the
training that they need,
that we, you know, that
someone needs to know
about um
normal and abnormal
child development. And
you know, not just someone out
of college who has a degree
in sociology
that doesn't give them the
groundwork. So, so
really looking at
um at what the
qualifications are
and uh of the people who are
doing the work and then
the second part, which is
probably no surprise to any
of us is still the stigma.
What he said is a lot
of the people working with these
families don't like
these families. They're,
they judge these families
as um
unfit or
uncaring or
whatever. And so that
stigma is really getting in the
way of, of
professionals helping that
family because they can't get
beyond their own
um
preconceptions about what those
families could be. So I I thought that
was really interesting and I'm just
throwing it out as food for thought.
Thank you, Mr
Chair
>> Less
Representative Ferrari. One last
comment. >> Thank you, Mr Chair.
And just to also follow up with
Representative Lord, her
concern about the 20 million
that was supposed to go into behavioral
health. I
think it was only
10 million that
eventually is,
has made it to
CYFD
and then the other 10 million is
waiting to be appropriated
for other behavioral
health issues or
programs. >> Thank
you. That's why I
suggest we need oversight. Thank
>> you.
Well, thank you very much.
And we look forward to
continuing the discussion
and and the education of
the committee on
CYFD issues
in Taos in
the first three days of Jan of
July. So thank you
very much. So,
members will go now to the
second item on our agenda,
which is
uh Un
M's child abuse response
team also called
Cart. And
that's uh uh
Leslie Strick
Strickler and
Rebecca
Jurat. Doctor Jurat
is a professor of pediatrics
and uh Doctor
Strickler is
the the section
chief for the child mal treatment
and the medical director of
Cart
Go Mr
Chance.
>> Thank you.
The,
it
sucks.
>> Where's your
colleague?
>> It
the
>> whole
time
that would be awkward. And I realized
I was anticipating perhaps
electronic presentation
of my slidess which I'm not seeing.
So I might need to grab a copy
of the paper.
I believe there's at least one
extra.
>> Yes,
>> thanks. I know, I printed more
than
enough.
>> Yeah,
>> I'll take one
too.
Um and chair TD Pino. If you want
me to pause until the panels
complete, I'm happy to just give
me the signal. You're good.
Ok. Um
First, I would like to thank you,
chair and members of the committee for
inviting me to
represent my programs
here today. And as I
said, I uh Doctor Day, my
partner um is unable to
be here due to lastminute scheduling
conflict, but she has
participated uh in developing
this presentation and is
also a very important member
and leader in our programs.
Um I want to first open
by clarifying a bit about
the title of
the presentation on your
agenda versus what I
will actually be
comprehensively sharing
with you. So I believe the
agenda mentions
a team called Cart, the Child abuse
Response team, which is
a consultation service based at UN
M. Cart is one of
of quite a few clinical
um and intervention programs
we run at UN M but not the only
program that we lead
and I'll actually be sharing with you about
all of the programs. Um Cart,
I think it has the most name
recognition so often tends to,
to lead.
Um I'm a child
abuse pediatrician and a child abuse
pediatrician is a, a
pediatrician with additional
expertise in training and
performing clinical evaluation
of her Children when there's concern
that they've been affected by
child abuse or neglect.
Our field is probably
the smallest in medicine.
Um Currently, there are about a
350 board
certified child abuse pediatricians
in the United States States.
Um And there are currently two
of us here in New Mexico, both
based at UN M Children's
Hospital. And I would clarify
that that is fairly representative
of uh where physicians
like us live and work. Um
As we do have to be affiliated
with trauma centers and tertiary
care centers um to
deliver uh much
of the direct care that we provide.
But I share those numbers too.
Um just to, to lay out
initially that our field is
actually in trouble. Um
like many pediatric
specialties, we are underrepresented
and there are a lot of reasons that
factor into that. Um
in order to become a board certified
child abuse pediatrician, one has
to um engage
in six additional years of train
past medical school
and we tend to land in positions
that are of the lower compensation
with high debt burdens um
and really obviously emotionally
challenging work. So it's been difficult
for us to recruit people into
our field. And um that is
something I, I think that our state leaders
need to hear, not just from my field
but pediatric specialties
um in general. And
I do think there's been some significant
headway made um
in, in improving incentives
for physicians. But again,
I think it's important to open with
that. But what I'm going to share with
you about today again is
the programs that we run at
UN M really
geared at focusing on child
well-being and, and to reflect
that we've actually renamed ourselves
um in recent years
um as a section for Child
safety and well-being because
although my title is a Child abuse
Pediatrician, taking care of you,
Children is not at all
all what I do and much like
all of you, one of our primary
goals and interests is actually
preventing Children from being
affected by maltreatment.
Um And in order to do those things,
we have a few different arms of our
services. Obviously, we have our
clinical teams that provide care
to kids when there's concern, they've
been affected by abuse
and neglect. Um But we also do
a lot of education and
advocacy. Um
And in addition to that, we're really
growing our capacity to, to
do research um
and growing our team uh
helps us in all of
those endeavors. But I'll
first take you so you see, see a little
Venn diagram that I think
incorporates the, the
missions if you will or the
subsections of our groups. And
I'm gonna take you through all of those
one by one and give you some highlights
um about the things that we've
achieved and the challenges we face. I
think since the last time, my
colleague Doctors Day met
with your committee, I believe last
summer. So
our clinical and family support services
I mentioned include not just the child abuse
response team, which is our consult
service to evaluate Children when there's
concern for physical abuse and
neglect. We also
have um a clinic based
in downtown um Albuquerque at
the Albuquerque Family Advocacy
Center called the Pedalos Ninos
Clinic. There, we provide
medical care for Children who have
been affected by sexual abuse
or sexual assault. And
our team is also um a
actively involved in helping
administer and run the
healthy beginnings to help foster
care clinic that's staffed by
general pediatricians, but
based at UN
M. Um
so a big part of what we do as
child abuse pediatricians again is clinical
care for kids. When there's concern, they've
been typically acutely or
recently affected by child abuse and
neglect, but we've developed many
different arms of our service
to, to expand our scope
of practice. Beyond that one
thing, I'm actually really excited and
proud to share with you. Just in
the last year, we've
been able to implement some
therapeutic interventions to support
Children and families. And one
in particular is a therapeutic
program based at the Pedalos
Ninos Clinic um
to provide therapy to
Children who are
causing, having problematic
sexual behaviors are causing
sexual harm. This
is um something that
has really become more
recognized in society and in
health care in recent years. And I do
think pandemic has some interesting
influences on that. And
we're recognizing that there are Children who are
acting out sexually causing
harm to others who really don't fit
within the child protection and certainly
not the criminal justice system.
But there haven't been great avenues
to address those types of behavior
and support those kids and
families. So we saw a
need in terms of increased
referrals in that realm.
And we've developed a therapy program
with support of some of our
uh grant funders
to help treat Children who
are experiencing those behaviors, not
stigmatize them, not criminalize
them, um but support
them um in
learning and growing and
establishing appropriate boundaries.
Um We are also seeking additional
support this year um
to implement um
additional therapeutic interventions
for Children and a caretaker support
program, which I'm really excited about.
And I believe we just heard last
week about some new funding
from um VCA
about that.
Um We're really
trying to increase our social
work and advocacy presence
within our clinical programs.
And I'll share with you that when I
started at UN M as a child abuse
pediatrician in 2006,
we didn't even have a formal
program. We didn't have
any dedicated support
staff, not even our own social
worker. And that didn't
come into fruition until just a
handful of years ago,
which is honestly
stunning. Um But with support
of our institution and our state, we've
been able to implement more
dedicated service and, and
in doing so, we're developing our ability
to provide again, more direct
support for the kids and the families
we serve in the clinical
setting. Um This includes,
again, crisis intervention. Many
of the Children um who are referred
to us are
their families are experiencing
active crisis um
and disregulation. So
we now have a social worker
who is available to meet
face to face with families in our
offsite clinic. And our goal in the next
year is to dedicate a social work
position to do the same at the hospital.
We're not there yet, but that's something we
would love to support with.
Um We have been offering
for a long time, a support group for
teens affected by sexual
assault called segure Fuerte.
And I'm incredibly proud that
our lead on that managed to
navigate COVID
um and have to destabilize
from in-person meetings to
online only and now back to
a model and our engagement
has actually stabilized and
improved over
time. So thankfully, we have
some young technology savvy
people on our team that
have been able to leverage
that. Um And
as I mentioned, we do a lot of case
management services.
Um
I've spoken before these committees many
times in past years and really lamented
the fact that we,
yes,
>> the handout
are printed
every other page.
So we only have half of your
pages
and I've
looked online and we don't have them
posted online
yet.
So I thought maybe if they
were online, I don't
see them
online.
Well, they'll be up soon. Ok.
So they will be so,
so we can follow online
>> and I will openly acknowledge I did
not have an administrative assistant on
site yesterday and this is a product
of me being one and I'm not good at
it.
>> You got the back page
reverse. But that's
another
>> my
apologies.
Oh, I will keep going because I just made
this and >> I think they
should be coming
up.
>> So to give you an update on the child abuse
response. And again, that's our hospital
based physical abuse and neglect
consultation service. When
I started as a child abuse pediatrician
covering that service only.
I had no dedicated time
to do that work. And I did it
in addition to a full time job as
a pediatric hospitalist. And in
2006, we cared
for 200 or less
patients a year in the inpatient setting
only. Um since
that time, um
we have developed not only
an inpatient and emergency services
arm but a full clinic.
Um And every year as we have
expanded our capacity to care for
Children, we've expanded our patient
volumes. And in the past year,
um we have uh participated
either directly or indirectly in the care
of over 700 Children.
And my impression and experience has
been the more we build capacity
to care for kids, the more the
demand for our services
um will increase
some particular um
highlight areas we've
become um increasingly
active in in in the cart
program especially
um is care for Children ex
um exposed um
to illicit or controlled
substances. And there was some discussion
prior to me, I know on, on
that really important
topic and I'll clarify that our
role as child abuse pediatricians
is typically to care for Children who come
to the hospital sick because they've had
a symptomatic exposure
to a controlled or illicit
substance. So I will acknowledge that
we don't tend to participate
directly in the care of newborns, which is
obviously a very important
um patient group as
well. But one reminder,
I think is important for you all to hear
is those effects don't stop
um after pregnancy and they don't
stop outside of the newborn
period. And what we're seeing um
as we continue to see
increased morbidity of substance
use disorders affecting our
communities, families and
population is that trickle down
effects predictably
um leads to Children
being negatively
impacted. Um because
of that, we're seeing more and more Children
again affected
directly by
substances in alcohol,
coming to our hospital very sick
because they've been exposed.
And because the testing
approaches um to,
to assessed for this is actually
quite complicated. It's become
the role of the child abuse, pediatrician to
lead the care of
those infants and
Children. And one
of the reasons for that is the
evolution of illicit and
controlled substances has
outpaced our ability
to detect substances
in the healthcare system.
Um and substances that are of
particular importance
and concern um include
marijuana. We've seen a dramatic
increase of exposure to marijuana
in Children with recreational
use and legalization and an
explosion of edibles because
these are not medications to Children,
they are candies and they are
cookies. Um and they look and
taste much like that. So we
have a lot of work to do to
um entrust the
safety of or ensure the
safety of Children now that these
substances are all
over our communities to be quite
frank. Um
and the other substance that's um
particularly troublesome is
fentaNYL. And if someone
had asked me 10 years ago,
uh, if I would anticipate
that fentaNYL would be a problem
that I would encounter as a child abuse
pediatrician. I would have laughed. And
because 10 years ago, fentaNYL
was available only in the hospital
setting for the sickest um
patients who are
battling substantial
chronic and acute pain.
It was very highly regulated.
Um, but it's also very potent.
It's probably 100 times
more potent than other oral
opiates. Um, and
not unsurprisingly, I
suppose, um, there is now
a market for it and it's, it's
the most prominently
um used opiates
um in individuals struggling
with opiate use disorders.
Um Why fentaNYL scares
me is because very
small doses have very potent
effect on adults. You can
imagine what that does to
Children when,
when fentaNYL first hit our streets.
Um My concern is, I think we were
missing Children who are exposed
because they were coming to the hospital so
critically ill without the
classic signs of an opiate
exposure and that doctors
didn't know what they were doing
or dealing with. So a classic
opiate exposure, someone gets very
tired, they may not breathe
effectively. Their, their pupils
get very, very small and it's a
textbook, any medical student will
know how to recognize
infants and Children who are exposed
to fentaNYL often go
into cardiac arrest. Um
And there are many, many things, of course
that can cause that. And um
it's very challenging for
frontline um responders
ems and frontline clinicians
to recognize this, particularly if
the history is not clear.
Um And
we're losing kids as a result
at the s at similar rates. I think
that we're losing adults. Um
So one seed again, I'll plant,
which I acknowledge is, is pessimistic.
There's a lot of important discussions about
how do we address, you know, the, the
epidemic of substance use
disorders and how it affects families
and kids. And I think
one of the biggest challenges that we have
to acknowledge is the drugs are
different instances
are like, unlike anything
I've seen, they're not the same
as when I was in high school and college, I can
certainly assure you of that.
Um And I don't claim to know to
have the answers. Um
But I think we need to recognize
that we're dealing with a landscape
we didn't deal with before. And
again, our role as child abuse pediatricians
has become to really help care for those
acutely affected Children.
Um In terms
of our, our uh the
other um increased capacity
we've added for the child abuse
response team. Um which
was somewhat surprising to me
is assessment and care for Children
affected by housing
instability. Um And
this came to me in a recent
multidisciplinary team meeting which are
county based meetings where health
care, protective Services and law
enforcement meet to discuss ongoing
investigations and interventions.
And I was asked if I would testify
in a criminal trial.
Um uh about
felony charges for a home that
was so substandard that it was
considered abusive to the
Children. Um And I was
taken aback by that because when the case
was shared with me, it was quite obvious
that the home was not safe for
anyone, much less the Children. And I
really questioned why do you need an
expert to tell you that,
um why you need an expert to
prosecute that case? But more importantly,
why did the case get to this point
that my involvement is
in potentially a criminal
prosecution? To me, that's
a indicator of a systemic
failure of our kids and our families.
Um And admittedly, I
also cringed because I thought, how
am gonna help? What can we
do? Um And what we've been
doing actually is accepting referrals
of Children who are affected by
housing instability. I don't just mean
homelessness. I actually mean Children who
actually may have a place
intermittently at least to call home
as their landing pad, but maybe isn't
safe for them. So we're working
hand in hand with protective services
and law enforcement to help do
assessments of the
stability of those homes from a
physical safety perspective
and a hygiene perspective, an
infection perspective
and an emotional and a
mental health and well-being
perspective. And I've been actually
quite surprised at the volume
of referrals that we are now receiving
where that is either a lead element
or a significant
um um
portion of the concerns
for the child's well
being. And I think it's, you know,
reflective of a lot of the challenges
that we face in our state. And I will
say particularly in our rural and
frontier areas.
Um And certainly there is urban housing
instability, I will be the first to acknowledge
that. But it there are different flavors
if you will. Um
So again, those are areas of dramatic
growth. I think in our child abuse
physical and neglect
program that I I want you to
know about because I really do do think they are
proxies for all of the challenges
our state faces.
I in terms of our child sexual
abuse program. Um as
I mentioned, uh our expansion
of service has really been focused
on therapeutic interventions and
I'm incredibly proud of those. Again,
addressing caregiver support
needs and Children experiencing
problematic sexual behaviors.
We do have increased staffing there
so we can accommodate more clinical
evaluations as well. Our
numbers tend to be a little lower for
that clinic. I mean, uh
admittedly,
um because of the
stigma associated with child
sexual abuse, um it
is harder for us to get kids into our clinic
and that's a national standard.
The no show rates for these clinics and
scheduling for these clinics is quite
challenging. But we have
again, consistently
increased our capacity to care
for Children and these programs
I'm describing to you, I think one thing
that I, I want to point out is, these are
unique in New Mexico. There are no
programs exactly
like ours that exist
in any other community in New
Mexico. And because there
aren't people like us that will, that
will be in those communities. And one of our goals
too is to help support
um frontline caretakers
in health care and child protection
in the more rural areas in, in
meeting these children's care
needs. Um
And I will acknowledge that one of our challenges
is the, the more our program has grown,
the more notoriety we've
uh we been um
fortunate to have throughout the state,
the increase the
the more increase we're
seeing referrals from remote
areas for Children to come to us for
care. And that's been a struggle because
we will provide care to any
child. Um In fact, in the
last two weeks, I have seen
Children from Gallup, from Santa
Fe, from Alamogordo, from
Las Cruces, from Valencia
County, from Albuquerque,
all over the state. They're coming
to us and we're happy to provide their
care. But one of our goals is really to
bridge some of the gaps of access to
care for kids in
this state.
Um
uh And one of the ways to do that
is of course, increase the pipeline,
right? Um Create more
professionals like us who do the
work that we do. And as I mentioned, we're
challenged as a field
um in order to address
that we were actually really fortunate
in the last year that the
School of Medicine and Department of
Pediatrics asked our
section to develop what's called
a fellowship program and child abuse
pediatrics. So this is a
three year course of training that's
been developed um
with approval of the
American Council of Graduate Medical
Education. And I say that because it is
no easy feat um to
get a program approved by that
entity. Um
and we are hopeful that in the
future we can train board
certified board eligible child abuse
pediatricians right here in New Mexico
to someday take over the
reins of care for
kids. And the other thing
I will share openly is I'm
47 years old and I'm very much
the baby of my service.
I've been fortunate to actually
recruit some very seasoned and experienced
child abuse pediatricians, but I think
we all probably have honestly 10
years left before we near retirement
and I very much want to
transition to that to
younger, knowledgeable hands and
training. Um Our own is
the pathway to do it. Um
We received accreditation for
the fellowship just last year.
Um Unfortunately, last year, there
are only 11 applicants
nationally coming out of pediatric
residency training programs who chose
to go into child abuse
pediatrics. There are
approximately 30
fellowship programs in the
nation. So as you may
anticipate being the new program
without established fellows. And we
didn't have someone from our own pipeline.
Last year, we didn't match a fellow
last year. Um We
do have interested premedical
medical students and pediatric
residents currently that we're hoping to
mentor up and train,
but we will go into a new
match um season this summer.
And I'm I'm hopeful that next
year I can come to you and tell you we have
someone to train. But again,
um I am um
realistic about
the challenges we face in
recruiting, but I will say
I didn't actually anticipate we
would have gotten um
approval to start that fellowship
because there's already a mismatch
in demand and supply. And I
truly believe the reason
that we were acknowledged as an
important source of education and
training is, is,
is based on the the first
patient population that we
serve. And in particular,
our potential to serve
not only immigrant
Children, Children experiencing
poverty, university, but also
Children from native American backgrounds.
There's a real gap in, in training
um
nationally, I think
you as you probably all
know. So that's something we, we
have that's really unique to bring
to the table.
Um And, and,
and again, recruiting people
to these fields requires
a lot of investment downstream.
And the other thing I wanted to share with you is
some of our other achievements in
education, you know, as
faculty members at the School of
Medicine, I'm called what
I'm what's called a clinician educator.
So my job is to take care of patients and my
job is to teach other
people. Um When I
was a resident at UN M 20
years ago, there wasn't actually an
educational opportunity for
residents to learn about child malt
treatment. I made the first
rotation myself because I was
interested in it. And we
now have an A CD
me approved um
elective that's considered a core
elective, which means um if
residents choose this selective, they get
credit for it toward their
graduation, which they didn't before.
And we've developed our clinical
services education
to the degree that we have residents with us
every single month. Um
We now educate all pediatric
emergency medicine fellows and that
that includes three a year.
Um And this year we've had the highest
requests um ever for
medical students to come spend
time with us. So now our challenge
again is we are
nearing a point where we have more
learners that we can accommodate, but
we're bending over backwards to
make sure that we can get
all generations if you will of
professional health learners direct
time with our service. And we of
course, provide a lot of additional
education at the community level
for other health care providers
and non clinical stakeholders,
like particularly protective
services, law enforcement
and the judiciary about what we
do and how medicine really
intersects with child
protection.
Um And we will continue
to do that um
with the recent edition
of a second board certified child
abuse pediatrician, which is Doctor Jay who
couldn't join us today. Um She came
to us, I believe in 2020
after um a, a, an
amazing
career in Houston, she spent
about 20 years there developing their program
and I can't tell you how fortunate we
were to recruit
to New Mexico. And
I will say I do think it's in part
because we're quite progressive state and
I applaud you all for that.
Um But she
has a lot of experience again in program
development and research and
advocacy. And in her time
here, she has been a
grantmaking
machine. Um And it really
allowed us again to develop our
nonin capacity
um to provide service to
kids and families. Um She
has in, in allowed us to
increase our, our support from
the Prem Victims Reparation Commission
invoca to, to provide
care. Um She
recently was awarded a grant from the
Kellogg Foundation to support
an initiative she's working on called the
Grand Challenge and through UN
M to really get a better
handle on
prevalence of child maltreatment
in our state. And that might
sound like a superficial
question to be honest. So I think we all know it's a
prop, right? But, but we also
recognize because of the incredible
diversity in our state,
we don't have
well unified
metrics to even
quantify how
much adversity and maltreatment
kids are experiencing
while their Children.
And in part, because we have multiple
different types of jurisdictions
that address that particularly
tribal and non tribal.
So she's convening a team
um to look at that. And also
we look at a, again, the most
significant physical abuse and death
outcomes in the state
because we really, if we're being honest,
we don't know that we have
accurate data
um about that. We know it's a
problem, right? Nobody,
nobody thinks it's not a
problem. But I think you
have to know where you are from a data
perspective to really move
um needles and,
and without
her addition, just that one body,
we would not be
even close to being in a position
to be able to develop these
types of programs. So I'm just so
thankful that she's here.
And what I'm probably most excited
to share with you in terms of
growth is that we will add a third
board certified pediatrician,
hopefully in
January. Um
in order to support again, our Ed
D for education and supporting a
fellowship, one of the points I
negotiated with the School of Medicine was
I need more people to do
this. Um And
we are now negotiating
with a very qualified
experienced child abuse pediatrician
from New England, um
who
it's not, ink's not on paper
yet, but I'm fairly confident she's going to
be joining us in January. And I
cannot wait to see
how much duplicative impact
we will have with another
mind and body like
hers. And I'm so grateful that
and I will say it, it's not
cheap. Again, I want to
acknowledge that and, and, and,
and this
individual she comes to us will be
taking a substantial cut in
pay to do so. And I think that's
a testament to the fact
that we've developed a wonderful program
here. We do focus on work
life integration. But I think she
recognizes that this is a place where
she can be incredibly
impactful and appreciates
the mission of, of what we do
at the children's hospital and
what our state leadership
um uh
emphasizes.
Um I want to share with you
also some information about
the scholarly work that we've been
doing. And again, 1015
years ago, if I were talking to you, I'd be
talking only about the clinical service
I was struggling to provide because that's all
I had the bandwidth to do.
Um The more we learn, the more we
recognize we don't know,
right. And the more we
recognize we need to find out. So
we have been increasingly actively
engaged in research
studies um within
our programs that again, we have some
improved band work to do.
I just want to share with you some
examples of the ongoing
studies and recently completed
studies that we've been able to participate
in. Um first and
foremost, one that's ongoing
is um
evaluation of rates
of a accidental fentaNYL
exposures in Children. Um
0 to 5. So, what we're going to
be looking at in that study
um is Children who come to healthcare
settings who have positive
tests essentially outside of the
neonatal period for
fentaNYL and, and symptomatic
exposures. And Sally
all acknowledge this will include um data
from the Office of the Medical Investigators
because unfortunately many of those Children
die. Um
We are Contin you need to, to
look at outcomes of a,
of a program that
actually our legislature supported a few
years ago um implementing
education about
child, child and infant
development and the dangers of shaking
infants. Um due
to actions of our legislature,
it's now required that all birthing centers
in New Mexico provide education
to new parents and families about
the dangers of shaking babies. And probably
even more importantly,
um some developmental
information education about
why babies cry and why babies
can be challenging.
Um And I can tell you
anecdotally um
that since the implementation of
that program, we have absolutely
seen a decreased
prevalence of abusive
head trauma by what are called
shaking mechanisms in our hospital.
I know that because I'm the one who does
the consults. Um what
we don't know is how
that data pans out statewide.
And um I'm currently in
discussions with colleagues in
the Department of Health about how we can do a
better job to identify
um that data. So I I
that will be a research study that's
forthcoming, but I will tell
you already emphatically, that
program has been influential
and, and that's so important to
me because abusive head trauma is by
far the worst kind of physical,
physical abuse. Um
We address with infants and
Children and families because the mortality
rates are quite high. And
for those Children who do survive,
they do survive with
substantial morbidity
in many cases. So this is the one
we really, really want
to
prevent.
Um We're also looking
at medical evaluations for
other uh Children who have been severely
affected by maltreatment. And again,
it's no secret that maltreatment is a big
problem here in New Mexico. So we do
see high acuity cases
and we've been fortunate to partner with
multiple other pediatric sites across
the nation. Um to look
at the approaches in children's
hospitals to evaluations of Children
who experience torture and
Children who are experiencing
strangulation. So these are ongoing
studies that we're participating in
right now. Um We're
also looking at
a quality improvement
initiative to provide families
um with safe storage for
elicit or controlled substances.
And this is a
multidisciplinary again
initiative that's being led
by the Department of Health, but my programs
will be involved in it and we are going to
be very soon equipped
to provide families affected
by substance use disorders. And
in particular, our patients who have been
symptomatically affected
to leave our hospital
with safe storage in
hand. Um And, and
I'm very excited about that because by
and large kids who are affected are affected
because not only because the
substances are in their environment, but
because they're openly
accessible to them in many
cases. Um and
marijuana substances in particular,
people just don't take the same
safeguards. Um they
should because I don't think people
perceive them um as
incredibly potent
substances.
Um some
other initiatives um that
have been, I will admit more fun
if you will, that we've been able
to engage in with the growth of our
team again, is community engagement
and advocacy.
Um As we've grown,
we've been able to host biannual
events. Um One
typically in November,
which is in alignment with the National
Injury Prevention Day Initiative
and another in April that
aligns with Child Abuse Awareness
Month. Um So we have
um partnered not only with
UN M School of Medicine and Health
Sciences System stakeholders,
but community stakeholders
um to put on community events
um twice a year now
and the last injury prevention
event was held at Explora. It was
incredibly successful as you
probably can all imagine, that's a great
place to find people and kids
on weekends.
Um Yeah,
and, and we brought in
stakeholders to assist
with educating families
about a variety of different
child safety topics
including safe storage of medication,
car, seat safety,
um uh
anti viol initiatives
and all of our clinical programs.
And we did the same again in,
in April with a child abuse
awareness event. I believe we had
20 to 25 different
community partners
um have booth set up on
campus at UN M
Children's Hospital to engage
with the public and even our staff
to share information about
their programs. And it's a really great way
to bring together entities that are
often siloed. And I'm really
proud that we've been able
to do that
um
in terms of areas
uh of what I would call
challenges and
opportunities um
and difficulties if I'm being honest, I
think I shared with you uh
essentially the, the
biggest challenges we face.
Again, we are coalition
leaders in a field
um that if I'm being
honest, maybe dying and we need to
try and reverse that and we need
the support of all stakeholders
um to do so.
One of the biggest challenges if I'm
being honest in my career,
um is bringing together
the right minds and the right people enough
and being on the right pocketbooks
um in the same place and time
um to support the,
the services that we provide.
And again, as a clinician, one
thing that is very unique about
me is that I don't make anybody
any money. Um And
that's really not a great
recipe for viability
in the health care system.
And so when I say that what I will
tell you is a busy day for
me as a child abuse pediatrician would be for
consultations. Uh Most
other doctors would drop
their jaws at seeing only four page
a day, but the care that we provide
is very time and labor intensive.
Um our clinic slots are
90 minutes minimum. If we
see a patient in the emergency department
or the inpatient um
hospital, um
we devote a half day to
that child's immediate care. So
we are, we're a lower volume than
other health care providers, but we're very high
intensity and unfortunately
for us, we don't do any procedures.
Um and those of you who are familiar with
healthcare reimbursement may know
that procedural based interventions
are those that are profitable and
incredibly. So, um
cognitive care
for patients is
not and that's what
we do. So we struggle to
make ends meet if I'm being
particularly very honest.
Um the reimbursement that is
received for our service for the clinical care
we provide doesn't cover even a
fraction of the cost
of operating and certainly not the cost
of sustainability and growth.
And so what programs
like ours nationally have have
done is really engaged multiple
different stakeholders to
support the work that
we do. And I think one of
the biggest challenges we face in
New Mexico
is um effectively
leveraging all of the appropriate
stakeholders to come together in the right
place at the right time
to really be intentional about
investing in these types of
programs. When if we're being
honest, I can't give you a dollar
amount that it's gonna save you next
year because I think of a lot,
a lot of the cost savings that we
produce for our Children,
families and states are somewhat
invisible. Um For
every patient that we recognize
abuse, we can hopefully
prevent maltreatment
from um
escalating. Um On the
flip side, we actually see a lot of kids
in whom there's concern for maltreatment,
particularly physical abuse
and that may be misplaced.
Um We care for a high-risk
population and uh someone
previously shared that there's a lot of
bias in in terms of how
individuals and professionals
um approach and treat
families. And I can tell you
that we get a high level referrals
on Children who have experienced accidental
injuries, um
unfortunate situations and
someone else has been concerned and maybe
even accused the family of abusing
that child. Um I'm
proud to say that over
the 20 years span, I've done this work
for our physical abuse and consult
service, 50% or
less of the Children who come to us with
injuries are actually identified as
having been physically abused.
Um And I share that because we
all recognize it's important to identify
kids who've been abused so we can protect
them. But it's also really
important to de escalate
unnecessary interventions
that are directed at Children and
families that can be very
traumatizing to them. And, and
obviously an incredible resource
rate on our system.
And so we do a lot of
deescalating of care.
And I think that that's almost
as important as
recognizing kids who are affected
by harm and a lot of the
deescalating we do
um surrounds families who
are experiencing risk,
right? Um And
again, you could argue that sometimes
that's families who are being treated
with bias. Um But one
of again, our goals is to, to
be able to look at cases where
child come to us with a particular
clinical question was, was this
child's broken leg due to child abuse?
And we can say no, but what we're also trying
to do is say, why was
somebody so worried about this
child? What
risks exist in this child's
caretaking environment that we can
identify and help
redirect that family
to support of services, to
say, prevent another injury
like this, but also prevent them from
being scrutinized or
preventing a case to
escalating to maltreatment of that
child. So the work that we do is
important on
every level,
um and one of our biggest
challenges is that we are not,
we're disjointed in our care.
To be honest, any of you who have spent time in
the UN M campus know that we're packed
in like sardines, we're
ever growing.
Um uh our programs
with without increasing
space to do so. So
as I shared, we have multiple different
clinical programs, some of which are based
at the children's hospital and one of which is
based in a clinic downtown,
which means for me that I
never see my partner. I
was actually hopeful, Dr Geer J would be
here today because it would be the first time I'd
see her in person in a couple
weeks. Um In order to
provide adequate leadership, we have to
have our physician leaders in our clinical
spaces. So that means we're never
in the same space.
Um What it also means
is that we're not efficient in the
way we provide care. And sometimes
we have Children refer to us, there's a concern
for sexual abuse. There's a concern for
physical abuse and neglect. And we have to
figure out which clinic should we
send them to do? We have
to send them to both clinics
and have duplicated care.
We're doing our best to
streamline that. But we recognize
we're now at a point where our lack
of cooc location and cohesiveness
as a program has really
undermined our ability
to, to continue to grow and
develop the most impactful
efficient care. So one thing that we
are looking for and I will admit
we'll be asking for in the next
legislative session is funding
to co locate our
spaces. Um
Because I really think that's the
next, that's what will get us to the
next level. If you will,
we need to all be in one
space and we need to have
space to exist to fund,
being quite frank. Um
And the other thing that would actually
allow us to do is streamline some of
our systems. We actually have
duplicative um
positions and to
some degree because we need
the same type of position in one place
that we have in the other place and they can't be two
places at once. So we,
we admittedly have some inefficiency
in our staffing um and
and duplication of staff because
of that. Um And I
certainly don't have any intentions to
lay anybody off, but I can tell you that we
can be much more intentional and
efficient about how we run our programs
and how we utilize um
our staff. Um
if we can just get into the
same space. And I and I do
recognize that's probably one of the biggest
asks anybody can come
to come to the
legislature and U and M with,
but it's, it's really our
most challenging. And I
think the other
that's not as discreet
that they have for you though, as decision
makers is
really continuing to be intentional
of taking a lead at um
supporting the integration
of our work. So
we are not supported
by protective services,
right? So we see patients
for protective services all the
time. They refer to us. We are
not under any contracts with
protective. We, we don't
have any financial support from protect
protective services, from
law enforcement to do the work we do.
They're the primary stakeholders
in the outcomes of our
care and in the
years that I've been working to grow
programs, um My
experience has been every, every time we
have an asked to a potential
funder, not
unsurprisingly the potential
funder says, well, why isn't that guy?
Um or that entity supporting
the work that you do and it's led
to a lot of spinning of our
wheels if you will. Um
And I, I will also openly acknowledge
as a clinician. I do think it's important
to have some separation as
well. I like to be able to say I
don't work for CYFD because
I think it makes it clear that
I am not in appropriately or
unduly influenced or biased
by a formal affiliation. But
I do think an area where we're lacking
in New Mexico is, is
lack of more formal
and financially or fiscal
integration of
all of the different stakeholders who do
the work that we do because it's
expected that I allocate
my time um to
communicating and coordinating with
CYFD, with law enforcement,
with the judiciary. And my
impression is none of those entities
have or have directed
budgeting to collaborate
with our services. And that's
where I think we need to see
movement. Um
And I, I will
admit, I, I don't know how
to do that as a doctor. I, I
feel like I make a lot of asks,
but I kind of around.
Um and if you all have ideas
about that, I'm very open
to them. But again, II, I
share this information with a
preface that um we
have been fortunate to be funded by
the state legislature for about 100
and 50,000. A year for the past few
years. And our ask in the next session
is going to be increased and it's going to
be increased to help support us, again, expand
our programs, um
make us whole if you will
and support our need
to better integrate what we
do with other
non um
non-direct health
care systems.
And again, I do apologize that you don't
have all the slides. I hope you've gotten
them at this point in time.
And if there's anything I've missed on the pages,
I don't have, I'm happy to answer
any questions about that or open
it to questions or
discussion
>> this afternoon or tomorrow
long after they're of any
use to us
before we go to the questions.
II, I do want you to
say a little more about
one item that
I may have missed it. You may have said
it. You talked
about how you serve
kids all over the
state
and your slide mentions.
Project Echo. You have an
echo. >> Yes,
there is sorry chairman.
There are slides about project echo.
Thank you for bringing that up. Um
We run an echo program
um out of the section of
child safety and well being called Safe Care,
New Mexico. It's
a, a program that was designed and
implemented to support
um primary care providers and frontline
medical um
service providers throughout the
state who are tasked with
responding to child abuse and neglect, but don't
have access to a Children hospital
um we modeled our
program after a successful
program that was implemented
in Kansas City.
Um that did the
same thing but also had some
infrastructure through the legislature
to support reimbursements for
physicians who would care for kids
outside the children's hospital setting. We
haven't gotten to that point yet.
Um But we had, we implemented
the program as pandemic
started in 2020. Um
we continued to run it since
then. Um We
typically have participants
from all over the state and actually have
participants regionally from
El Paso and sometimes the Phoenix
area which I think speaks to the
regionalization need for the
care that we provide and
we meet twice a month.
And what we do
is either I or
colleagues of mine provide
didactic education to our
participants about select
topics in child abuse, pediatrics.
And those of you familiar with Echo models
will probably recognize there's
generally a shortened
or condensed, you know, teaching
opportunity in, in the beginning
of an eo session. And then we
transition to what's called opportunity
for case for. Um So
participants can bring
deidentified cases to
us for inp input from
the multidisciplinary team on the
Echo um and receive
again education input about
those cases. Um We've
had some incredible successes with the
Echo program and admittedly some
challenges um
while we intended the program to
be targeted toward
primary care, physicians and
health care professionals,
what we in fact have
experienced is that the buy-in
for this particular educational
model has been far greater for
non clinicians. Um
We have most of
our participants um outside
of Albuquerque are actually
based in child Protective
Services, uh social
services and law
enforcement. And we've had
great struggles to
um engage
healthcare professionals
in this type of didactic
model. And I, I think there are a
few important reasons for
that. Um First and
foremost, most physicians
who aren't pediatricians and
child abuse, pediatricians are sure
hoping that no, nothing walks through their
door on a given day that involves child
protection or child abuse. These are
the cases nobody wants to
see um, and deal
with because they're difficult.
Um, they are rife with
conflict. They are very
time intensive, not just
in that clinical setting,
but um what
evolves after a
recognition of a child abuse
case, meaning engagement
with child protection service, legal
services and the judiciary and
testifying in cases. And
I will tell you that physicians
aren't scared of much, but they're really
scared of court.
Um And uh,
they're also scared
of things that they don't do frequently.
And what we recognize is most
frontline physicians
deal with trauma treatment somewhat
regularly but not with a
frequency that it becomes
something they can prioritize
because there are so many other
demands of their efforts
and their time. So what I've
come to recognize is there are very
few frontline physicians who
have um,
2.5 hours a month, which is
what we offer to
dedicate their time to
that sort of education and
I don't fault them for that. I think
that's just a reflection of the reality
that they deal
with. Um
We have had success in bringing
in clinicians as they've had cases
referred to the university and, and
exposing them in that way. But
essentially, our echo has evolved to
be more non clinical than
clinical. And it's been a way that
we can educate non clinical
stakeholders um
throughout the state. The other
interesting challenge we face
with the echo is it has
again assisted
us in increasing
recognition about the services we
provide based here in Albuquerque at
the Children and the children's hospital.
And the outcome that we have seen is
actually we're seeing an increased rate of
referrals um
to un m
from, from the
more rural areas
and, and, and I say this
with as much humility as I can because I
think they recognize the quality of the work
product we produce
and they want the board
certified child abuse pediatrician
on the case. And if they don't
in their community, what I will tell you is they
will drive kids to us from
four hours away and
I don't turn them down. Um
I I very much think that an area
for improvement and challenge for
our field in particular is
finding ways to more effectively
and impact with
more impact, deliver
support to our communities. So we're
not continuing to have to
pull kids in from
all four corners of the state
to provide the care that we provide.
But in, in that regard, we've actually
been a victim of our own
success.
>> The reason I bring that
up is because
it seems to me that that ought to
be something
that Cyfd would
be very supportive of,
particularly because as you say,
it's largely their staff
that are, that are participating
in it, That might be your
entree to an
expanded
contractual relationship
with Cyfd that would pay for
you to not just do
those two, but
maybe more
so that the staff are
getting and
this is what that million dollars
for staff
development might be going
for. I mean, we've
given them a, a million dollars
for staff development. They've only spent
not even 100,000 this
year. If they had contracted
with you for
300,000 of
that,
you could have provided much more
staff development
and reached a lot of
the, the people that, that you needed
to reach. Anyhow, I bring
that up as a, as a, an
avenue you might want to
pursue with them. It just
seems to me that they're,
they're,
this may be unfair, but I have the
impression they're not really
reaching out to the potential
allies they have in the
communities in
a way that would be
conducive to
supporting them.
I mean, what
you're doing would be so beneficial
to so many of their workers all
over the state
and they,
they, at
least as far as the
picture emerging so far, they're
not really availing themselves of
what you're offering to the
extent that they could be,
but it, it'll grow and, and now
that you now one
other quick question before we turn up to
the committee. So it's
you
Dr
and then the new doctor from
Houston,
>> Chairman Dr Jay came
to us from Houston, the new doctor
we're recruiting hopefully is
coming to us from >> new,
is the New Doctor's
>> Newish.
>> So you still have two
and that would be a third one
if you get the one from New
England. Very good
members of the committee
senators.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and
thank you for your
presentation.
Um You alluded to
some of this throughout, but
I would like for you to
um comment
on the is a
interdisciplinary
collaboration at
UN M with
you all, not around the state
with other entities for
and specifically,
if you end up seeing a
child, uh Mr
chair and
doctor that has
um an issue
that you
assigned to
abuse or neglect
or
alcohol abuse
and that goes into your medical
record. And
a doctor in another part of
the system
sees the parent,
do they see that
comment?
Does the doctor of the
parent see the comment that you wrote
about the child
>> chair and Senator? That's a
fantastic question.
Um The answer is
probably sometimes but
not all times and, and I, I
will acknowledge one of the challenges
that we have with
interdisciplinary
collaboration and communication is
there are some very important
um safeguards put in place that
protect privacy of information,
particularly medical
information. And when we
complete a consultation for the
physical abuse and neglect service,
one of our priorities use is
to identify that child's medical home,
their primary care provider.
Um And if that child has a
primary care provider, we uh
as soon as we complete a
consultation note. It is released
to a number of different entities,
anyone performing a child protection
investigation. So, protective
services and law enforcement receive
a copy of our
consultations um and
the child's primary care provider
will receive a copy of the
consultation. Um
We are not permitted
um uh by
patient privacy
laws to
connect with say a
parent's health care
provider unless that parent asks
or gives us permission to.
So we can't do that without
invitation, but
we do place our records in the
medical record, of course, and we
do our best to
ensure that our documentation is provided
to the child's medical
home, which I think you would,
I would argue is a part
of the care for that child's
guardian. I'll admit. One of the
challenges we face is many of the
Children I refer to us don't have a
medical home. Um So one
of the, one of the processes we've
implemented and now that
we have more direct social support is
our social workers follow
our cases um for
3060 up to
90 days to identify
if the child was referred to a new medical
home. Have they followed up, have they gotten
to that appointment? I'm doing
just even some telephone follow up with
families identify what are their needs
to get connected to services.
Again, this is a level of care
we've been able to provide just in recent
years that we didn't have capacity to
provide before. So we do our
best to ensure
that our communication is
efficient and transparent. But I will
acknowledge there are some privacy,
legal limitations
um that create some
restrictions.
>> So Mr
Chair,
she touched on something
that I have heard from past
employees
that CYFD
in their case management used
to do many more
things uh
for the
family, for the
parent and the child and the
entire family.
And I would think that some of
your phone calls and follow-ups
would get into that whether
it's needing
transportation or money
for rent or something like
that. So I'm glad she brought
that up.
Thank you very much,
>> Mr Chair. I, we
have 14 minutes until
so I'm gonna be real. This
might be the time I turn off your
mics.
>> Thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and doctor
Strickler. Thank you.
And I just want to thank you
for being such a pro
um
for, you know, child
safety. I, I know
that having to
look at that on a daily
basis,
you gotta be tough
and I'm sorry that you have to see
that kind of stuff. But uh one of
the questions that I had
was when
you talk about the therapy
for Children with problems
with sexual behaviors,
what ages are we talking
about? And
you, you mentioned that they didn't
belong in the,
you know, the criminal side
of things. But
what if the recidivism
continues? How does that
work?
>> Um uh chairman and
Representative, all great
questions, the
um therapeutic program that we
have implemented, it
is directed
toward older Children. I believe
the low end of the age limit for
that program is 10 years of
age. Um And I would
say that does capture
most of the
demographic of the referrals we received.
But occasionally we will get referrals
in Children even younger than that
um who are alleged to
have engaged in problematic sexual
behavior in many of those
cases of being entirely
honest. Some of those behaviors
are misinterpreted and there's a
lot of interesting unique child
development. I'm just going to be blunt and say kids
are weird. Um
Yeah, that
can, can and does cause concern
and part of our role is again,
educating and deescalating
sometimes with families about that's
actually pretty common. It's
ok. Um But again, so we
do target our, our thera
therapeutic program for the older Children
and who we do have more concerns
for, you know, what, what is going
into those behaviors.
Um And I will
acknowledge our therapist, I think could do a better
job to speak to this with
clear data. But my
understanding is that rates of
recidivism are actually quite
low. Um even in
kids who don't get therapy. So what I mean
by that is a child who's behaving
inappropriate in some sexual
way as a child is not a child who
should be labeled as a pedophile
in adulthood. There's not
that linkage does not
exist. Um
um But we recognize
that there is risk. Um
So, so the the the
interventions are geared again
at establishing appropriate education
and boundaries for those kids at a, at an
early age. And also if I'm being honest
looking, again, what are the other influences
into this? All of the
social ills we've
discussed here and people were discussing
before me don't exist
in isolation, right?
Um The reason that people
have problems in their lives is
because there's other problems in their
lives to put it most simply. And I think
the substance use epidemic
is a great example of that.
Um And
so again,
providing more supports and breaking
intergenerational cycles
of violence and adversity
is really the key to doing that
and getting services to
people early and earlier in
their lives to me
is is the way to
do it. Um
I think the challenge is, again, these
are time and labor intensive
initiatives. You know, we've, we've
had only five Children. If I'm being
honest, go through this program, we
just implemented this year. It takes
a lot of bandwidth from
our, our social worker to
do this. Um It's a
months long
um a series of
sessions for the child.
Um but the
um but the outcomes are
are very promising. And,
and again, I think the other challenge
again is we see that sometimes these
kids get shunted into a
system they don't
belong in and in addition to that
being wrong for them,
emotionally and behaviorally,
there are systems that aren't designed
to respond to this. I think you,
you know, the legality is
that a child can't consent
to any sexual activity
with another child
below the age of
13. So we sometimes
get referrals on a 10 year old having done
something to an eight year old and someone who wants a
sexual assault kit
doesn't make any sense because
it's not evidentiary in, in any
way. And so that's why
I use that example of there are
actually concrete
legal limitations to what
can be done even if people
want those entities
to be involved, which is why we really have to
redirect our support for these kids
and families to noncriminal
nonin investigative
interventions, but therapeutic and
supportive ones.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank
you again, reminder >> that three
minutes includes questions
and answers. No,
I just have to be the mean
cop.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. I'll be very brief
on this. So what I have a question
is I'm very big on, on
science based but going to what
first of all what senator
says that is a good point
because a HIPA it would be nice to
see in real time if
abuse had happened before
repetitively. But I guess that
gets handled once it gets reported.
If it gets reporting gets to the right
person. So I understand
what you're saying on that one. I agree.
Um So what I want to
ask you about what are other states
doing that is science
based, that
work that we could reproduce
here in New Mexico specifically
when it comes to child abuse.
And I know you're doing a study on fentaNYL.
So what, what are our ideas with
fentaNYL and child abuse because that's
up and coming and
what have other states done about that
have legalized marijuana if that
has been the case where there's more cases
of Children gaining their hands on
marijuana. So what I want to
know is what other states are doing and what we can
replicate right now while
you're still doing this research.
>> Um uh Chairman and Representative,
I think that's a great question.
Um
I don't know that other states are doing
anything dramatically different than
what we're doing. And if I'm I'm
being honest, I think in some
ways we're leading charges.
Um I can share with you again
that from the clinical
perspective, what we are
proactively advocating for is
expanded um screening
modalities again, to better detect
Children who are
being affected.
Um There are other states who I think have,
who do have access to more
broad um substance
panels um that are more
easily accessible in their regions.
Again, we're in the middle of the desert.
I there are sometimes labs that I have to
send out to Pennsylvania. Um
If I want them done. So there
are some just resources that
exist in other larger metropolitan
areas that are not as easily
accessible um
to us. Um
Other states obviously
have implemented the, the same
sort of care a initiatives
that we have implemented here.
And I think the reality is that the
outcomes vary
um uh state
to state and population to
population. So I don't know
that there is necessarily
another model
that we can just pick up and
replicate because I think we're a unique
state with unique challenges.
And I think what we need to do
is figure out how to tailor
our interventions to the needs of the people
that we serve. Um
I wish I had the answers to be honest.
I don't know that I
do. Um I
think stabilizing protective services
as well is easy answer.
>> Thank you, Mr Speaker
and uh expert. So when
you say screening and you talk about for
pregnant women that come and would explain to you what
you mean about screening. >> Um
I'm uh chairman and
representative, I'm thinking to get the patient
population I serve, which is
non, non
neonates. Um older Children
who are affected by substance
exposure and the fact that in our hospital
systems, the approaches that
we have to screening for substance
exposure are incredibly
cumbersome. I am currently
the only physician in the UN M health
care system, who knows how to appropriately
order all of the screening
tests to assess a
child who has come
in with some sort of clinical symptoms
causing concern for illicit
substance exposure. And it can't
be that hard. >> And how
long does it take to get those results
when you do that screen? How long does it
take? Uh uh >> chair and representative
some of the re uh some of the screens that
are done in the hospital lab will result
within hours. Um Some
of the screens that have to be sent to our
reference lab, which is called TriCor
only five minutes down the road.
Um uh Take a number
of hours to a number of
days.
>> Thank
you.
>> Thank you Mr Chair and thank you so
much Doctor Stickler for,
for coming. I so admire
your work and thank you for being
here. Um I just
want to clarify a couple of
things. One is
what I'm hearing from you is
that when you're providing services
for Cyfd protective
Services, there is not a
funding mechanism
or is there not a contract
for consistency of a
funding mechanism?
>> Um uh Chairman and Representative
Kate's good question um
because we provide
me primary medical care when
I'm speaking of our consultation services,
our current um web burse for
that is through medical
insurance and the vast majority of
our patients, as I'm sure you're not surprised are
Medicaid patients and the
reimbursement for the work that we do is
abysmal, not the Medicaid
um level.
Uh I honestly don't
look at my reimbursement all that
much because it depresses. But I can
tell you in an average month just
regardless of how many consultations
I see un m probably brings in like
3 to $5000
for a month of my
work, which I think is more
valuable than that. Um
So what other states have done
um to leverage this and recognize
we're not solvent in
typical medical models
is implement um
support from the state
legislatures, support from
contracting with protected services.
Some do it through the judiciary, which I
do think has its own
challenges. Um But I
would, I'll be frank, I'd like to see more
support for the work that we do
from the state, um
from protective services and from
all the, the stakeholders we
serve and >> thank you so
much. II I most
certainly will stand here and I'm sure
most of my colleagues will tell
you that I like the idea of
supporting the growth
and the efficiency and
outreach education.
I will say personally, I've seen
doctor Strickler who has
trained seasoned,
well-educated social
workers. They are still not
medical providers
on identifying
accurately child
abuse and
it, it, it was a
substantial
help to the process
of providing for our families.
Um I want
um uh
uh just also
say, so you need a one
larger building to have
basically two clinics under
one building to increase
efficiencies.
And
um and, and I
also want to say, I
appreciate you may be the only
medical provider in any of these
legislative sessions who
talked about the success of
recruiting other medical providers
to the state based on
the fact that this is the
reason why they started
practicing in the first place. It
is rewarding and it is
impactful and I
appreciate that being part of
your testimony as well.
Um Thank you. Um
I will tell you, Doctor Strickler
once told me that Children
are not small adults.
And so thank
you,
>> Representative Ferrari,
Representative
>> Chavez. Thank
you, Mr Chair and thank you
Doctor Strickler. This is
important work that we
need to be sure
is supported in
every way
you, I
think you mentioned the
collocation
to Coate so
that your services can be
together if that
takes, you know, special
funding that we need to
provide for you and
m to be able to do
that, we should
consider
that now. Um
But also you were
mentioning about
um I think
it was your
awareness events
and I know that's really hard
to do a lot of outreach
or meet a lot of people.
Um But have you
considered or work
with Doh or other
departments
within the state
for media campaigns?
And to get, you
know, radio TV
ads that would help
expand the
information
>> uh chairman and representative.
Yes, we do regularly partner
with the Department of Health um
and their subsidiaries
on our initiatives.
Um All of our media
engagement, obviously, first and
foremost, does have to go through HSC
media relations. So that's just
again, a um
a, a strict requirement that we
work within. And so we primarily partner with
them then to
extend our partnerships
beyond that. But absolutely, we,
we have and I think that's an area
for continued growth.
>> Thank you. And also
um when you were talking
about um
expanding to non
clinician.
Well, no, I'm sorry
to other pediatrics
who are not with a
children's hospital.
Um and especially
in Las Cruces or Southern New
Mexico, do most
um cases get
referred to
um El
Paso
>> chairman and representative.
Uh That's a great question again,
depending on the
region, some of the highest
security cases will be referred
to out of state hospitals. So
critically ill or injured Children
will go to the closest intensive
care unit. Um So in some
cases that will be Lubbock in some
cases that will be El Paso
and those they have some child
abuse services there, but we
often then do follow up care for
those Children. But the that does create
some disjointedness in their care
because jurisdictions get very
messy. As I'm sure you
can imagine when things
and cases um cross
state lines. Um
I think the bigger challenges
are uh the lower level of
cases. I I think
Children in rural and front areas just
often don't get care at
all. Um And
when we speak to that, it's actually
not really even pediatricians
because in the frontlines, those areas,
there are not pediatricians. Um
in the frontlines, in many of these areas, there
are not healthcare professionals
if there are healthcare
professionals, um
they, they tend to be
more broadly trained. So emergency
medicine, family medicine,
advanced practice providers.
And I think one of the biggest
challenges I've seen evolved particularly
as pandemic has um
unfolded and we recover
from that is there's
not continuity of care
in our rural and frontier
regions. Meaning I sometimes take
calls from er doctors
um who are doing what's called
locums work and don't know anything
about New Mexico and they're going to be
gone to a different place.
Um Another in
another week and we rely
on that type of staffing to provide
any care at all. But
um we'd be lucky
if we had pediatricians in
these areas. We just don't even have
healthcare workforces in
many of them.
>> Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
So my question has to
do with um
the, the
child Abuse
Fellowships.
And so your slide says
that there are 11 applicants for 30
open positions nationally.
So what
are you doing
to
let pediatricians
or? Yeah, let
pediatricians in New Mexico
know about this opportunity.
I mean, they may not even know about
it and I don't know what kind
of, you know what
that means for them in terms
of, do they have to go
elsewhere? I
think you mentioned it takes six
years to be board
certified. Um So
what does that mean? And what does it look
like for recruiting
pediatricians who are currently
practicing in New Mexico? >> A
very good question, representative
and chair. Uh The honest truth is
pediatricians who are already in practice
and have completed their training will not come
back to do a fellowship because
it's not financially
feasible for most of them.
So the targeted population
to recruit to a fellowship is our
learners. So medical students
and pediatric residents,
which is why we've expanded our
educational opportunities for those
populations. So our goal is
to capture people early
in their career and and
expose them to our field, develop
their interest and recruit them while
they're still in training. Because to be
honest, people don't come back
once, once they're out
and training is intense,
it's a more intense schedule.
Um and they're paid as what
are called resident physicians. So the
salaries are much, much lower than
somebody out in practice.
So for so for that reason, once
they're, they've been released
from the educational tunnel.
If you will, they, I don't
anticipate they would do a fellowship. So we
really need to focus on the, the next
generation if you will.
>> So Mr Chair,
I, is there any way to change
that? I mean, if we were
able to um
you know, supplement or,
or maintain their, their
salaries. Would that
be a way to be able
to recruit uh
pediatricians to
this field? >> Um Chair
representative, I think it may
um I don't know for
certain and I will share that. Um
I'm not fellowship trained, I
grandfathered into the board and
one of the reasons I did that I didn't want to
leave New Mexico, so I learned it
on my own with good mentorship.
Um uh I,
I think again,
I think the most
likely
pool of recruits
is, is the younger,
newer. But I do think if
there were some financial
incentives that people weren't sacrificing
financially um to do
the training that could certainly
help. I think the other challenge again is
these fellowships are all in
tertiary care centers. So
if, if this is not a person
who's from the metropolitan area
that would also be asking them to
relocate um
for three years and, and
again, if we're, if we're pulling
in somebody who's been established
clinician, then we're creating a
void in their practice
environment. Um So it becomes
some robbing Peter to pay
Paul um Elements
of it if you will. I I do
think another answer though is
to again, increase education
of other non physician
clinicians. So not everybody
has to be a board certified child abuse
pediatrician. We educate
advanced practice
clinicians and
generalists who have interest in
the field. We're happy to do a lot.
But I think again, there are just a lot
of unique challenges in the work
that we do
um that make that
hard.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair.
Thank you. Thank you Mr Chair and
thank you for your presentation.
I admire the you for the
type of work you're doing. It must be very
stressful
and depressing
and, but at the same
time, very important.
So it wouldn't be for the faint of
heart. The
question
>> is,
it's just
like,
yes,
ma'am,
we'll stop your
time.
There we go. >> Oh,
ok. Is this
better?
Ok, thank you.
Um
So we have one of the
highest percentages of
folks in the,
in the country that
don't have a
broadband. So
is the lack of broadband
in the rural areas a
problem when you're trying to
utilize echo?
>> Um Senator and Chair,
I suspect it is, I may not know
because I don't know that those
potential participants even
come um to the radar.
Um But certainly participants
do have to have access
to um reliable
broadband or Wi Fi because we use
a Zoom platform
to engage.
>> Oh, thank you for
the answer. And that, that's all I have.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator and,
and uh one quick question,
Doctor Strick, were
you at all
consulted by the
department when they
elaborated their
plan for Kara
kids
for the kids exposed to
drug abuse
>> chairman, I have been involved
in dialogues informally.
I was no one
on my programs
was involved in a
formal
way.
Um we certainly
do again, work with families, effective
and work with protective services
in, in caring for
families but
not formally and we would invite the
opportunities. >> Yeah. No, I
think it would be great. Thank
you so much for your presentation,
incredibly helpful.
And if, if we can get
Doctor Janay
to join us
at a later meeting, we
would be glad to add her to an agenda
just so we could pick up her
take on what's going on here
as well. >> Thank you,
chair
>> members. We go now
to uh with that, we
conclude that item and we'll go
to public comment
and I've got a long list here,
but I'm not sure. Everybody that
said they want to speak is
here. We will start
with Kristen Conley,
the director of the Karin
Wolf Center for
Child and Family Justice
at UN M Law School.
Then we'll go to
uh the Toledos
uh from Bold
Futures.
>> Thank you, chair
Mr, chair members of the
committee. Thank you for hearing
from us today.
Um I just really
wanted to uh let
you know, I am the director of the
Koren Wolf Center for Child
and Family Justice at the
law school for
27 years,
funded in part by the
legislature and in part
by court improvement
project funds from the
federal government
provide training
and resources
for attorneys,
judges,
caseworkers, social
workers, tribal
representatives,
uh court-appointed
special advocates and other
professionals in the child and
family welfare field
here in New Mexico.
I wanted to let you know that
I am available if
you have questions about
any particular issues
that arise in child and
family welfare. I
myself have
been certified
for 18
years as
a national
child and uh
child welfare law
specialist. I
was a trial attorney
representing parents or
Children in the system
for 20 years here in New
Mexico and it
was part of my work in
Texas as well when
I was in legal aid before
I came here.
Um
We uh I,
I think one of the things
that's very important to hear
when there's this question about
uh workforce development,
that's a large part of
the work that I do is I
provide training,
I want
to raise the
level of practice for
attorneys and for
judges. I
provide orientations
for judges that are new to
child and family welfare
law. And we provide
data reviews
looking at times to
permanency. How
long it's taken a
case to go
through the court system as
well upon
initial orientation. And
then eight months later, we
provide a follow up.
And in fact, this Friday,
I'm providing a follow-up
data review to
our newer judge
Steven Romero
who is up in
Raton. And
I am providing an
orientation for our
newest children's court judge
here in Albuquerque, this
Friday as well. Judge
Diana Garcia, I
also have a training
planned for Judge
Rose in
Tucumcari in another
couple of
weeks
with workforce development.
We have heard a
couple of different times
here.
Senator Tallman mentions
that it's stressful and
depressing work for the
judges who work uh
sorry for the doctors
who work with the
child abuse response team.
And I I won't get the
correct uh
acronym
so I won't try that right
now. And we heard other comments
about that. That's to
me, that's one of the
largest problems
both to maintain attorneys
and to maintain
uh workers in the
system. This is
brutal,
terrible, terrible
work. And even if
you're not seeing
the physical abuse,
you're seeing the results
of dire
neglect or you're seeing
horrible poverty
that has taken a toll on
families. Um
So that secondary
trauma is a huge
piece and to my
mind, workplace, uh
workforce development
involves ongoing
support for
those workers. It's
not just about how much
money that helps
the other piece though is what
is the education that we have?
We do not require
caseworkers in
CYFD to be
trained social workers.
We allow people
who have say criminal
justice degrees who come
in and then who come to
families with a more
punitive
criminal minded
approach to how
this work needs to be
done.
We uh
we also have to look
at uh what
the destruction of our mental
health care system for
low-income people did.
It was disastrous
for us. It was disastrous
statewide. I am
deeply heartened
that our state is moving
more toward prevention
instead of
what there's a common
metaphor that they use
in this work nationwide
that uh
here's people
working frantically
to successfully pull
babies out of the river.
We're, we're saving
the babies, we're pulling the
babies out of the river
and then one person marches
upstream to go find
the idiots that is
letting the baby fall into
the river. Your time is up.
Thank you very much
for public comment. Three,
thank you. And I do have
cards with me if anyone
would like that. Thank
you.
>> We might want to have you
on a future
agenda too,
Chris.
Ok. Now we have
a group of people
from the Toledo
family and bold futures.
New Mexico.
Uh Are you all gonna speak
for three minutes or total of three
minutes?
Ok.
>> We, we
try. Good
morning chair and members
of the committee. My name is
Melissa Toledo.
I am from the pos of Ham
and Taki and I am coming
to you as an impacted
mother.
Um
I lost custody of my
kids and fought for over a
decade, being judged
by everyone around me rather than
offer resources to help me
regain custody. Was
traumatizing.
A decade passed when I was finally
reunited, reunited
with my son and daughter.
And as of February 2023
I gained full custody.
I want you all to remember
our trauma doesn't end our
reunification. It
continues and we still need support
after unification.
Keep in mind, we have to pick
up where we left off
understanding our
Children, building
trust in keeping families
experiencing CYFD
involvement. Every step
is
crucial
to break the pipeline. I
feel that my case could have been
different if I have been
offered more support
and could afford legal
counsel. I
would like to see ac YFD
system that supports
families or resources to
reunifications rather than
foster care being the quick solution.
Thank
you.
>> Yeah. Thank
you, chair and members of the committee.
My name is Kora Toledo
and I'm a survivor of the child
Welfare System. I was
11 years old when I was first
placed out of my family's care and
pushed into the system by
coafd I was
placed in and out of different treatment
facilities and heavily
medicated. I was
later placed in foster care
and sentenced to seven months
in an unfamiliar house
that I was not welcomed in.
During the time I was away from my
family, I was alone and had
no support. I want ac
YFD system
that actively involves
Children in their case
and ask Children that I removed
what they want and how
they can help and support us.
Children. Lastly,
I was taken from my family by
COAFD. Yet
CYFD was never part of
my case, both
placement and after
placement until this
day after reuniting with my
mom, there has been no follow
up with CYFD
nor have they been a part of
my brothers and I's case, I
want AC YFD system that
is actively involved
and checking in on us Children
in our foster placements and in the
treatment facilities
because those places felt so
lonely. I was
not communicated with
what was going
on.
>> Thank you, chair and members
of the committee. My name is Caden
Toledo. I was taken
away from my mom at age
four, I was placed in a
very physical and
verbally abusive home.
My experience after
being removed from my mom was
scary, unsafe and
traumatizing. I
trusted to share my thoughts
on what I was experiencing with
CYFD. But instead they
shared with the do I
was placed with and put me in
further danger after
I was retaliated against by
the do I learned not to
share with the
caseworker? I continued
to deal with the verbal
abuse with the doll who told
me that my mom was unfit
to take care for
me and my sister. But my mom
always loved to and
took care of us. I
want to see ac YFD
system that has
confidentiality with
its Children listens to what
we Children have to
share and to be a safe
place. I want to see a system
that prioritizes
prioritizes family
input and child
safety.
>> Thank you very much. Now,
were you?
Yeah. Wouldn't
the Indian Child Welfare Act have
kicked in and you should have been placed
with a tribal
family.
>> Yeah, it should have been that
way. But due to
ECU being only
federally recognized and not
statewide now
with I A, it is
um I did get my daughter back
through ECU through the state
through Jesus Pueblo.
She was placed with my father
and then re reunified with
me after
the safety plan
expired.
And then in
2022
after I A was
implemented in
March
October 2022
no questions asked or whatever
my son was brought
home.
>> Well, I'm so
sorry that you had to go through all of
this, but it sounds like
you're on the way to healing
and, and restoration now.
So, thank you. Thank you for
coming. Thank
you. And we have
two other bold futures
of spokespeople.
Um Keva
Hubbard and
Saria
Asbury.
You have to turn. There's a
little button.
That's it. Hey, >> good morning
chair and members of the committee.
My name is Cleva Hubbard.
I am a parent with lived
experience. I did lose
my Children and I have been
reunified back with them.
I would like to see more
clinical
experienced
case managers in
CYFD.
Um We are very
aware that the state is lacking
resources for these families
and families are being penalized
for what they can't get.
Right. So if
you're on your treatment plan,
if you're required to see a
therapist or get
anger management or whatever
it is that you need, you can't get
it because we have lack of
resources. And
so penalizing parents is for
what is out of their control is
not. Ok. So
I would like, you know, the department
to revamp their training
include clin clinicians
in that and also
people who have lived experience.
Those of us who are sitting at
this table. We're not here because
we don't have anything else to do. We're
here because we want to see a change
for families of New Mexico.
We stand every day in front
of committees just like this for
that change. And it
starts with having
conversations like this, having
people who are trained
to, to sit in front of these
families and
support them through their
case. I do
understand that Cyfd does
their best but they are
shorthanded.
Being shorthanded is not an
excuse for families to be
treated or forgotten
about on a
constant.
There's
text messages,
emails, families
crying that visits are
being missed because there's
no resources here in New
Mexico. So I would
ask that you all just consider
um having a conversation
about clinicians starting
with Cyfd.
Um the training of
Cyfd,
also implementing
people with lived experience in
all of this.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, chair and members of the
committee. My name is
Shakira Asbury and I
am a bold
feature. Um
Excuse me, a bold feature leader and
I too am a
person with lived experience.
I also had my Children
taken away by CYFD
and I have been reunited
reunited with them since
I would like to see the
department have more
transparency with
families in my
situation. I never saw any
paperwork. The
worker said that in
in house services which
are resources was offered to
me and they weren't offered to me, but
that's what was documented and that was
one of the probable causes
for abuse and
neglect their
word against mine. And I didn't see
the paperwork till years
later. So I would
like to see a department that has more
transparency. I would
like to see them that have people who have
lived experience as myself
such as peer support workers.
Like we said, the
clinicians, I think it should
be a wrap around service
um with a whole
team, a care team,
not just the
workers of the department.
I would also like to
see that
each family gets a option
to work with the peer support. If I had
a peer support worker while I was going
through my struggles, I
believe that that would have helped me
navigate better. Families
are not thinking
clearly when someone takes your
kids, you're not thinking clearly
and not to be able to navigate
the system or have somebody help you
navigate and have the system
against you is
very difficult. And I believe that
more families would be reunited with
their kids and have
less of
um recidivism to the
system if
we offered more support
and I work in the field where there
is where I give out resources, I'm a
peer support worker and I
provide resources to
unhoused to uh
families, people
who have SUD or behavioral
health issues and the resources
are slim to none.
If they are there, there's a waitlist.
So as Cuva said, if
we are mandated to or
court order to take these services
and they're just not there, we are
penalized for it.
Thank
you.
>> Well, thank you both very much
for, for coming and sharing your
experiences.
Um
These are issues that we can certainly
bring up with the secretary
tomorrow when she
comes.
Um, next we
have, uh, Gail
Stewart
G Stewart
here.
>> Thank you so much. Um,
I'm a special education
attorney in New Mexico.
I've been an attorney for
about 41 years. I've been
doing special education work
since the late 19
nineties. Um, and
I'm here to talk about
the same kids you're concerned
about, but in the public school
setting, um,
and what I'm here to talk
about may seem like a
small issue,
but it's a no
cost,
a noco fix
that has been brought to the attention
of the public education department
numerous times. Um
beginning in 2019,
when a group of parent
advocates asked
for rulemaking
to prevent the
covering of classroom door
windows in our schools.
So people may
not know but
throughout the state
classrooms,
particularly housing students
with disabilities,
the classroom door
window that the principal
should be able to see through
is frequently covered.
Uh I have worked with
innumerable Children
who have been abused in those
classrooms, both
physically and emotionally.
Uh Some of them have been seen
at the child abuse response
team clinic.
And the point
is that
to prohibit
the covering of classroom
door windows costs
nothing.
Uh It's not a resource
issue. It's a lack
of willpower in the
state. And
with the public education
department taking on school
districts that are simply
used to allowing
teachers to cover classroom
door windows, it is a safety
issue. If you're
concerned about
trauma to Children and re
traumatizing Children
who have been in
various family
situations that may have been
traumatizing. You've
got to decrease the risk
of harm at schools.
Please, please please
lean in to the public
education department to the
LES C to
talk and think about this
issue. It will cost
nothing. It would do
a lot of good for many
students across the
state. That's all I had.
Thank you.
>> Thank you very much,
Gail.
Next we have
Veronica Montano
Pilch from
uh
New Mexico
casa.
Not here yet or maybe she was
here and had to leave.
Ok. Oh, there she
is.
Good.
Oh,
did you want to say something during
public comment? Ok,
good. Well, we'll hear you at
one o'clock.
Um, Marilyn
Beck,
>> thanks.
Is it on? Ok. Thank you, chair
and members. My name is Marilyn Beck. I'm
the founder and executive Director of New
Mexico Child First
Network. I just
wanted to say it's exhausting
sitting before you for all the men
the reasons we mentioned
today. Um,
my Twitter background says
solutions exist
and quite frankly, I
didn't even know if I wanted to come today
for the next three days because I feel like
we're having the same conversations
over and over
and over again, year
after year. I think
every single thing you heard today
is something this committee has
addressed. I've sat through all your senate
health committees, your house
Health. We've done this, um, things
that stuck out to me today.
What would improve the child abuse
response team is stabilizing
Child Protective Services.
That is something I will hear
over and over the need
for continuity of care,
the need for wraparound services
and peer support workers.
I think on Friday morning, you're going to
hear the Kevin S team.
That is something they filed
originally in
28
we talk about dismantling health
care that happened 11
years ago,
um HSD.
So part of the Kevin S team
is suing HSD, not
just CYFD. So when we
need to build up our behavioral
health system and our support,
that is part of the lawsuit that
was filed now 6.5
years ago. And then
I want to leave you with our top three
priorities are an independent
outside objective ombudsman.
My phone personally
rings 7 to 13
times a day with outrageous
horrible stories, kin
grandparents, foster
parents, bio parents.
Um We need to revise the
confidentiality code and we need
to fix Kara and those are the
same three things we presented in front
of this committee a year ago.
And then I would also look at really
looking at fentaNYL intentionally
and knowingly providing fentaNYL to
Children as child abuse,
which the crimes and court
justice committee did pass
unanimously and it
died in its first committee.
So again, we've
been here before solutions
exist. Our kids are not ok.
We can do better but
it takes leaving this
committee and having commitment to
do better. We need an
ombudsman period. The
department cannot reform itself,
it cannot fix itself it
is underwater
and it is exhausting
to come before this committee and say
the same thing, year after
year after year after
year with nothing happening.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Marilyn. Now we
have two people
online
who've signed up for public
comment. Who,
uh Grace do you have control of
that? I have
Alvin
Sali.
Oh, Teres Yanan Isan
on. Ok.
She left. So we just
have Alvin Sali
and let's hold him to a very
tight
timetable.
>> Yes.
>> Are you there,
Alvin?
Good.
>> Mhm.
Yeah.
Good.
You
said
really
discretion.
Yeah.
Oops,
>> that's very good. Thank you.
Thank you doctors.
And we'll look forward to seeing you
tomorrow. Um,
with that we break for
lunch. Apparently lunch is
gonna be served.
Lunch is lunch has been
served, but we're not
gonna have a working lunch. We have
a break for lunch so you
can wander
around downtown Albuquerque if
you so choose,
but we'll be, we'll resume
at one o'clock
and the timekeeper will be
ruthless in her
holding you to that.
