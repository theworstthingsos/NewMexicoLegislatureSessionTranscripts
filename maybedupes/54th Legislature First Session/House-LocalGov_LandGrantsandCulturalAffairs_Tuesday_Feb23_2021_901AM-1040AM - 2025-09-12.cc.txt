public notices in Spanish.
Thank you Mr chair of house bill
two twenty five he is the result
of
if this is the this came to my
attention does a local
government agency who publishes
public public notices in English
and Spanish in our local English
language newspaper and so the
the complaint was dispersed from
so my constituents was that the
that they're not able to
understand no or even be aware
of any public notices or any
things are coming because they
don't read the English language
newspaper they they their stance
on the monolingual speaking
constituents.
So the the whole purpose of of
public notices to notify the
public and if you're publishing
a Spanish language notice in an
English language newspaper here
in the the alienating a
significant portion of the
population by doing so and up so
this bill is looking to correct
that.
This bill is due to the intent
of this bill is to to provide
equity to all our Spanish
speaking people in New Mexico
the the the good thing about
this that I see is as is an
indirect result of it is also
would apply to to any other
language that has has published
media as far as public notices
are concerned.
With that I would like to
introduce my by expert witness
Mr a journal small ideas in the
comments if you can make a note
please enter.
Gerald bill free to add to the
presentation.
And you're welcome to you.
You're welcome to leverage on
the on your statements.
Most popular think that nowadays
we asked in the it's the year
coming years.
I think it's the norm which are
still.
my last name is of the eastern
European but actually I was born
in South America are proud of
your status and the building in
southern New Mexico I'm I'm not.
Representative what what we all
are okay and and this is not
my second favorite scent this is
not going to get some burgers.
This is that we can quickly
become enjoy everything.
Together and respect each other.
I have a degree in advertising
that I got installed American.
I will benefit from your.
Do.
I noticed when I came to this
region that there was no Spanish
language media I I managed to
local radio stations when the
water is one the US site what do
you have your.
And it always surprises me that
there is nothing published in
Spanish south of Albuquerque.
This is a huge state.
The Spanish archer I'm I'm
surprised we have native
American reservations.
Where they have to have the
meetings.
Domingo a switch restoration to
their own populations are that's
not normally use increase in
their meetings same thing
happens in places like are some
part of.
Colombo's where the majority by
far level elation.
Speaks something in addition to
English or language of all this
is on my speakers that is that
is US Census official okay
places like some long park and
provision of find out how over
ninety percent.
Overpopulation the docks
And then they try to understand
when the next city council
meeting.
All went well the state wants to
be on the.
The couple miles of road.
They don't know.
Exaggerating the simple
sentences sent
People.
And it's a different federal
agencies employment open the
door and if you know what I need
is that you already visited my
area on our story.
So I would.
The legislature regarding how
the things are handled and
languages and stuff.
Right so you'll see.
Thank you comes from the
eighties.
Actually it's a lot earlier than
the eighties but the last time
the state wasn't that we
form updated Representative two
times.
Was in the eighties to wait to
be.
One of the most amazing things
time cleaning president Reagan
through the post office mainly
in rural areas where you would
get in speaker of the following
day or seventy nine.
So.
Good intention was to use.
Something that when you use the
post office your support of
properties created and statement
of ownership is called what you
state are great so many papers
and my on that is there is that
this is the office where you can
send me it in the comment or
complain or whatever and that's
done once a year.
I believe it's in the middle of
October something that everybody
has the bodies that being if
they want to have that's the
tradition from the post office.
But they're all special way of
doing business as the Norse many
advances in the business and
mainly their creativity and
cheaper and the people are used
to begin that's the papers.
You go to a supermarket I think
you're right like that but let's
charge New York restaurant I'm
very happy for.
Well you can qualify for the way
this thing is described in the
current statutes.
Because you have to have a
tribulation according to the
post office.
That was probably to avoid
micro.
You.
Your papers trying to qualify.
Thank you place of religion in
the papers.
Also.
That indication cease to exist.
The post office forty years
change the way things were
classified so they talk about
sickle.
Mail.
The second class permit doesn't
exist anymore.
Thank they replace that
requirements the replace the
names of the things
and they replace the way that
you can get a lower rate which
was the intention of a work
order of shell.
Yeah community media reach out
you look at people.
That way I could send a hundred
copies of my paper to a smaller
community and have a high school
kid to distribute them in stores
or something that.
Now we would close the same day
with the available options that
I have been actually reading the
paper.
So you see something that was
done by good people with good
intentions forty years ago the
last time.
Something that needs to be
updated.
And this is not against
established media by their way.
I know that is a yes and but I
want to sort of explain to you
what happened forty years.
There is not one shaped.
Language publication south.
And I think you're just this
media would lose a bet in your
district vision or whatever
because we are all smaller
community.
The largest ones schools is yeah
okay.
But that you have places like
Google was next to the border
with Mexico.
They don't have evidence that
are.
They just use I don't know
social media.
Social media let me explain why
the.
Young kids know how to use
smartphones and so I'm going to
have lots of the technology.
Other people.
Also I orders.
Do not even have internet access
most of the time.
So what we are tension of the.
Disengaging those people.
But where charging the same
taxes we're asking for them to
participate with us from support
from them we don't give them the
tools.
Because if you go to census they
speak more Spanish at home.
The young kids go back home and
speak Spanish representative.
What do that what whatever it
may be.
New Mexico historically has
being eight rigs language for
and make sculptures Environment.
And I think that it's a starfish
media.
To happen my offered to give
them my contents we're going to
create a sections banished may
be present be placed I will.
North north and Mexico whatever.
Doing it with any profit
intention I'm not sending you
know just making an offer okay
so there would be space for them
to take the Spanish portion of
the building.
In that pages so we went for
everybody.
Thank you and this is one of the
very fast because the statute.
What the current statute
requires.
If you
will creation bad news more than
twenty one of twenty five about
populations be exited from next
page other than English.
In order to be complied yes you
have to do it.
In both languages in English and
other language.
Moreover if you went to some
part for example.
One ninety two ninety four
percent.
the populations the expansion.
In compliance if you see
providers and being.
Expenditures.
The neighbors but I said this is
not forty percent of our.
The state legislative nobody
does it.
What's so strange that.
We are trying to force people
that don't understand anything.
In the dust thank you for being
compliance they have to use the
English language.
Availability in your media.
To but sometimes both or just
the Spanish one or not.
Because regarding that
multicultural traditions.
So.
Trying to.
It was everybody everybody.
What's the include coming up we
have.
As an official because the
statute requires that officials
management page paper.
And when something that region.
A statewide or.
I'll try a local.
To have that thing appropriation
burnished when they're spending
your available.
And the second option to keep
things the way they are.
But I noting knowing the stature
but not going along with Mr
Mattis the I. DS and Google
chrome will be thank.
We have been waiting thank.
The only way to be part of the
American dream.
Is to be different than what we
we are.
And I just missed a lot of.
Attention here the question
because his background is in
school you medication.
So thank you so much of these
bright you.
That when they leave school they
don't have internet access even
if they have the one thousand
dollar fine.
Because it's not existent.
So
tension on the.
We left
behind.
What I'm proposing is to be to
stop being transparent.
What.
For.
Mr speaker is the perceived
respect that.
Thank you consideration.
I'm the part and give their
opinion and know what's going on
and what we are doing with their
money with their government with
every.
I apologize for a long speech
but I just want to the system
one point amending the grant
I wasn't born in America on this
point seven Meg my grandfather
was born in Eastern Europe
that's why might my last name.
I'm very proud to be a very.
What I'm proposing is the
American way of doing things
with everybody.
I don't know if anyone has any
questions or wants to use the
current statutes or go back to
make a lot about it we really
appreciate your your allowing me
to tell you the things that
share of these big
Representative is being thank
you very much.
Thank you Gerald R..
It does not are and.
Is that it on your presentation
you yes Mr chair without we just
stand for questions okay
Representative Lara can you just
kind of briefly touch on the
highlights.
That the general just shared
with us in terms of the
legislation thank you Mr chair
so all online okay one nine
headlines.
So be it what it in in a
nutshell Mr chair this bill is
trying to accomplish a three two
things number one Morton
notifications in and the public
notices in Spanish to Spanish
language media number two to
include up and coming around as
an official of the Spanish
newspaper in in New Mexico and
in the unity also visitors Mr
chairman Mr small also touched
on some.
Issues regarding second class
postage and I think that's
something that also needs to be
considered it and look at
that that language is
constructing the bill and we are
working with the with some on
some interested parties to
update that language however I
would really us suggests that we
focus on the intent of the bill
which is to provide more
equitable access to all the
Mexicans thank you Mr chair.
Thank you for that that.
And the Representative Lara.
By adding a coming Nora and.
As official Spanish newspapers
we're talking about legal
notices.
We're talking about those legal
notices that nobody reads when
the on the last page of the of
the local newspapers that you
know that deal with this or that
going on in state government
this or that going on with city
government this for that claim
with county government so so
that's that's that's that's
important at that information be
disseminated also in in the
predominant language of of our
communities so.
Thank you for that the general
then thank you a Representative
Lara we'll go out to the
audience.

Brian thank now.
And Brian
we've got two minutes.
So feel free to our.
Share your comments to the

Okay Brian here in on mute

Brian on unmute yourself.
Brian we're not seeing you

and go to the next person and
then come back to you.
Merry next we have Lawrence ran.
bring Lawrence over.
Lawrence you yourself can
address the committee in terms
of the your opposition to the
legislation thank you Mr
chairman members committee Larry
around registered lobbyists for
the New Mexico press association
and Albuquerque publishing.
We agree with Representative
Lara in the major intent of this
bill which is to expand access
and notice requirements to those
Spanish speaking or or other
language speaking communities
where we really run into an
issue is primarily what's
contained in section one of the
bill and Mr smaller
made mention of it and we've had
some conversations with
Representative Lara Mr small we
have not been able to resolve
our differences and it really
comes down to on page one line
twenty three through twenty five
where you do strike second class
postage is a requirement for
public notice Mr small is
correct second class postage it
does not exist as something
called second class postage
anymore but it does exist under
the U. postal services a
periodical class and what what
that does although it's a bit
technical but what it does is by
having to apply for second class
postage from you ensure that
legal notices are actually going
into into a newspaper a
newspaper of broad circulation
that that people know we're
issues pertaining to their
property or to or to what
government is doing where they
are and so when Mr Smollett
talks about distribution of
newspapers free newspapers in
grocery stores or to order
convened you know at a circle K.
or something like that that's
not where we want to have legal
notices you would have no legal
notices more people know where
they can get them they know
where they're going to show up
and
places like the Albuquerque
journal the Santa Fe New Mexican
Las Cruces sun news if you if
you are looking for something
that the government is going to
be do you know where to go
there's a reason we don't put
legal notices in the thrifty
nickel or the daily local or the
NMAA you round up because those
aren't newspapers in the
traditional sense that can be
sent to people's homes so we
really have a fundamental
disagreement on that aspect of
the legislation we agree we do
not object adding communal L. as
in Spanish.
Can newspaper we certainly do
not object about expanding
notices to those in the lead in
their language that they speak
we just need to make sure that
we preserve legal notices in
such a way that they are they
are in a place where people can
find them and they know if their
properties being taken of the
government is going to do
something that they may want to
have they may want to weigh in
on so we've had some good
conversations we actually think
we can help Mr smaller get to
where he needs to be with his
newspaper although the one of
the requirement that I will
mention is you have to publish
legal notices in the paper
that's at least available on a
weekly basis at this time the
commuter rail is not so although
it would be inserted into
statute as the official Spanish
speaking on newspaper would not
publish on a weekly basis so it
probably still would not meet
the requirements of legal
notices thank you Mr chairman
we're happy to continue working
with the sponsor on this issue.
Thank you Mr Moran
And Brian will go back to you a
merry bring a brand back into.
The panelists section.
And give them a second try.
And then we'll go to the the
other person after that.
Okay Brian are.
You're on strike to.
Unmute yourself.
Right it is not coming through
brother.
Merry that let's go to a semi
Lopez and the other person this
cause against.
And we'll come back to Brian for
the last time strike three.
Send me are here in I'm get
yourself an address the
committee there you go.
Thank you Mr chairman and
members of the committee my name
is Sam Lopez I'm the executive
director for the New Mexico
press association Representative
thirty eight weekly and daily
newspapers with readership over
seven hundred seventy six
thousand readers.
I'm a native New Mexican going
up on a farm in her Alice I've
been a publisher in New Mexico
most of my career working as
publisher and for some Deming
read also the lan.
Carlsbad Los crucis and
Farmington
House Bill to twenty five.
It looks like it's just adding
on additional paper and which
will we applaud them for for
adding another Spanish language
newspaper to the to the list of
official Spanish language papers
but it also changes some of the
some of the pope public notice
requirements and and we're
concerned about those and but
willing to willing to work
through that through those
issues this this statute also
coincides with many others
public notice statutes in in New
Mexico law including including
requirements for constitutional
amendments and bond issues
the law has been in place for
many years in terms how and who
can publish public notices.
In addition to publishing public
notices in newspapers The New
Mexico press association has a
public notice website we're all
legals published in the state
are posted to this website many
lawyers contractors engineers
and activists use this website
to read public notices and in
fact you can subscribe to this
website and based on keyword
searches you can you can get.
A public note New Mexico public
notices delivered to your email
address
as they appear in New Mexico
newspapers so the people are
reading public notices they are
getting this valuable
information on on New Mexico
government through their
newspapers and through our
website I would be happy to
continue to work with
Representative Lara on to make
changes that fit not only his
needs but this but fits the
needs of the state newspapers
and for the citizens of New
Mexico thank you Mr chairman.
Thank you sent me
Right.
I thank god we did a wipe out on
new I don't see on the screen
anymore.
Whether you are.
Right and you still wish to
speak.
District one more time.
Remember Mary.
There you are okay Brandt.
There you go Mr chairman members
the committee I apologize every
time I tried to get into the
panel on mute at my got cut off
my name is Roy go to it Brian
before he would you cut you
disconnect Agence okay okay with
that my name is Brian settle I
would Albuquerque publishing
company in the Albuquerque
journal as Mr insured we don't
disagree with this bill but
there are a couple of points and
that that that I need to make
everybody aware of one of the
changes that that representative
of the large trying to make says
that Spanish language ads have
to be published in the Spanish
language in official Spanish
language newspaper the bill is
outdated as he mentioned and as
Mr small a mentioned and there
are no Spanish language
newspapers south of Albuquerque
or shelter Santa Fe the ones
listed in that act have gone out
of business in the Albuquerque
area the one in Santa Rosa no
longer publishes and there are
no official Spanish language
newspapers south of Santa Fe and
so if we adopt this language
where a Spanish language add
hast the publisher Fishel
Spanish language newspaper we
cut out sixty sixty five percent
of the state.
And so we suggested changes to
say that published in the
Spanish language newspaper where
available because in the journal
we publish both in English and
Spanish.
for the City of Albuquerque for
the state for the county and and
we just try to ensure that the
an ad in both languages gets the
broadest possible distribution.
There is still postage.
Available to newspapers in yes
second class postage was changed
to something called periodical
postage and the reason for that
is is because that was a way to
prove to the court to lawyers to
whomever question the
distribution of the ad that that
that went out that's why it
wasn't as work allowed in
shoppers because there's no
guarantee that when you leave us
a message or a Albertsons or
grocery store that that people
have picked up the that free
paper and have seen the ad and
so the postal statements were
way to prove that the add one
out the other thing that that I
think Mr her analog good mention
when I was logging back on was
that there is a requirement in
the law as it exists that the
frequency has to be no less than
weekly.
And that is because legal ads
very by court as to the number
of times they have to be
published within thirty days and
if a paper is is bi weekly in a
lot of cases it cannot reach the
required number of publications
in the limited number of days
thank you very much.
Thank you Brian I'm glad we
finally got to they're on strike
right because.

we were struck you out.

thank you Mr chair this is Tim
Davis with the New Mexico Center
on Law and Poverty people who
speak languages other than
English should have equal access
to legal notices and
advertisements that affect them
and their community and this
bill will help accomplish that
goal state agency legal notices
and advertisements are already
required to be published in
Spanish but it's not enough to
these notices are published in
any newspaper having general
circulation because Spanish
speakers may not read the
English language newspapers
mandating publication in
official Spanish language
newspapers will make it more
likely that these notices reach
their intended audience thank
you Mr.
Thank you.
Others in support done.
please hit the race hand icon at

Mr chair not that I can see
okay.
Thank you
well that wraps up the audience
participation I will go to
committee members questions
discussion.
We have a Representative Fajardo
and then Representative black.
Thank you Mr chairman and thank
you Representative Lara.
I just I just a couple questions
because I'm trying to understand
the premise behind the bill I'm
so.
Currently it's my understanding
please you know explain to me if
I'm wrong right now that you
have a population of.
It's over seventy five percent
of of of Spanish speaking then
what happens.
What do you what what are you
supposed to do Mr chair
Representative Fajardo the if if
if if that threshold is met then
if available the Spanish public
notice these to be published in
Spanish media language media
okay Mister and I Mr Chairman
representative there also need
to be published in English
because I'm as I was reading
some of the analysis it it was
only in Spanish if it was over
seventy five percent and my
incorrect and that R. as in
Alice is incorrect.
The Mr chair of Representative
the the it's my understanding on
on the bill is out if that
threshold is a matter of there's
lesson that certain percentage
of the population then the
publication in English would be
sufficient.
Okay so if it's over seventy
five percent miss Mr Chairman
representative does it have to
be it only has to be published
in Spanish.
Mr chair representative it has
to be published in Spanish if
there is a Spanish language
media available if there is an
ending Spanish language media
available we are we are not
asking Mr chair of the
newspapers to have to you know
create a new addition or publish
anything in Spanish they would
continue doing what they
normally do.
Fifty percent if if it's if you
have fifty percent of the
population has to be published
in Spanish.
Mr chair representative I'm not
I'm not sure I don't know why
expert has the answer but I I'm
not sure of that.
Gerald R. can you respond to the
Representative Fajardo is
question jester question.
One of the reasons why I go
these the dating the regulation
I'm not changing regulations
that there as is read today the
district thank.
What Representative Fajardo is
is bringing up is completely
natural and that's why I started
stated that this is not one
which is the other one.
But it makes sense that it's.
Seventy five percent of our
population uses one language.
We want to use resources
effectively and reach out as
many people as we can.
Yes.
Representative Gerald or
question had to do with the
percent threshold.
Current law that and I and I'm
trying to understand the
analysis I'm really struggling
with this piece of legislation.
Isn't that current law that
that's fifty if you have fifty
percent of the population speaks
Spanish you have to publish and
eight in both English and
Spanish.
The answer is.
Twenty five and seventy four the
state use both languages.
And how is your tried to if
there's not being expectation we
there's an argument here but if
there's something I appreciate
makes sense so twenty five to
seventy five you provision both
nobody wanted schools.
Thank you Mr answered the
question Representative Fajardo
that ask your question I don't
think it's still very very
confused I think I mean I'm hi
I'm thinking that we're going
backwards on this on this
legislation you know it just I
understand bring in other
newspapers into it and making
sure that there are certain
publications are provided to
statute and I completely support
that make sure that everybody
has access but the way I am
reading at and the way the
analysis is is interpreting this
is a you have a community that
has a twenty five percent
English speaking it only needs
to be published in Spanish.
Why are we taking away the
English speaking why don't we
just make it if there's a twenty
five percent or more of about
threshold of Spanish speaking in
any community if we if we you
have you been published twice I
don't understand the seventy
Representative I mean my thing
is if you if you have a twenty
five percent of English for
Spanish in any community is to
be published by.
Make it simple I think this is
making it a lot more difficult.
I'm so having just really
struggling with it with that
aspect of it I think we're going
backwards I'm Mr Chairman
representative my other question
is how do you know I mean I'm if
I'm innocent Halicki.
I'm it it basically how do I
know the percent of Spanish
speakers in my community.
Representative thank you for
that Representative Mr chair
that would that is based on
census data.
So I'm Mr chairman so so
Representative so that will
change at the end of this year
that so if I have a community
and eight
I didn't pods that threshold
that would change
It this coming January that's
kind of when we'll get the
census information
and then we ended that'll last
for ten years Mr Chairman
representative.
Thank you for for that and
Mr chair representative so what
happens in the in the meantime
the intro is that there are the
federal government does I think
they're called family surveys or
something like that and that the
the update or the target
specific out of locations and
and and states and groups were
is so the that's it's kind it's
not I'm not a more seats
constantly updated Mr chair
representative but it is updated
on a regular basis I I don't
know if my expert knows exactly
when but you know the the census
Mr chair representative.
Years but there are surveys in
between that those times that
updates information to my
knowledge.
Mr Chairman representative
what's the violation for not
meeting the standards.
Mr chair representative so the I
I think that that's a really
good question and I would say is
that if if of a government
agency willingly does not
publish in the Spanish language
media if it's available and it'd
be the criteria then I I would
figure that they would be able
of the would be have to be held
accountable.
Mr Chairman representative do we
know that what that looks like a
separate open meetings it is an
open meetings act I mean where
lot of we find in this
Mr chair Representative no it's
not open meetings act so it's
all public notices so is the
public notices are in many cases
a precursor to the open meetings
act so so so the way I hate the
way I see this it is that you
know we were policies public
notices you know like it was
sent earlier in thirty days in
advance for this this there's a
hearing that's gonna happen and
in the way the way the way it's
happening now is that many of
these public notices are both
Spanish language in English so
technically according to the
letter of the law the the the
government agencies are
complying with the letter of the
law million in actuality there
in October following the spirit
of the law is brutalized include
everyone in as many people as we
can so a it's been my personal
experience Mr chair I'll
Representative Fajardo that.
There has been a government
agency here locally that
publishes Spanish and English.
Public notices in the English
language newspaper in the
meeting a good portion of the
population and when it was
brought to their attention well
we're just we're we're we're
complying with the law.
So you there is so and so Mr
chair representative so that's
the bare minimum that they have
to do and the way I see that is
that's really unfair to my
constituents and the citizens of
New Mexico if we're only beating
the bare minimum and not making
that extra effort to published
at Spanish notice in Spanish
language media I hope I answered
your question Mr.
You your dad and I appreciate
that and I think and and I think
that goes back to I really think
this is kind of modeled I'll
I'll be honest I don't like a
seventy five percent I think
we're going backwards I'm a
little bit by saying if if it's
seventy five percent and it I
would rather just keep the fifty
percent threshold but we choir
that it be published in Spanish
speaking newspapers where
available that way it covers
your constituency
I get that trust me I mean I
don't I don't like it when I go
to a government agency and I ask
him why you're doing this and
they're all the same they're too
lazy to do the right thing.
I completely support you and
that I think we need to do that
it's a numbers game that's
really bothering me on this one
I would prefer to keep it back
to the fifty percent white is
that weights across the board
but just add language that if
there is a Spanish speaking
newspaper anything of you know
Similar in in within that
community or or that that you
know publishes or distributes
that area that that be included
as well and that's just just my
comments like I said I think
it's a little muddled I think we
can we can clean it up a little
bit but that thank you for
bringing this forward chairman
and thank you Representative I
do I do understand now what
you're trying to get out I
appreciate it thank you
Representative are the next will
go to a Representative black.
Thank you Mr chairman and
representative Laura Act
question do you have.
Someone was spoken in testimony
there that there is no Spanish
speaking newspaper published
south of Albuquerque is that.
Correct.
That you have one in your
district Mr chair representative
black yes it are it is correct
and I wasn't sure on the on the
status of many of those
newspapers but there's one that
I want to add to the list that's
on that's in the bill of rights
community I want someone that
covers our area and they're
dying over the that particular
newspaper Mr chair
representative covers Dona Ana
do not and parts of the terror
county.
Okay thanks thanks for that
Representative Mr chairman I'm.
Representative Mr chairman thank
I am I am kind of stuck on that
that the section one of the bill
that removes the option to
published at what is it that
removes the option to publish a
notice or advertisement in
newspaper that has a general
circulation or that is
publishing printed a whole or in
part.
In a county that can be obtained
by single copy in that county.
So thank Representative.
Mr Chairman.
To me it right by removing that
then then you're saying that it
that it wouldn't necessarily
have to be printed in.
The Los crucis son is is that
correct is that that's how I'm
reading it Representative Mr
chairman and it would is that
correct.
Mr chair of representative in
this in that in that particular
case I would say yes so the the
government agency would only be
obligated to publish the English
our public notice in the Los
crucis and years and that and
then they would have to the
would be obliged to publish in
any Spanish language media
that's available in in our area
for the Spanish public notice I
hope I can answer your question
Representative
yes and yes and no thank you
Representative are I'm in I
guess really might I and I don't
know forgive me Representative
Mr chairman that.
I don't get the Los crucis side
you know I I see some of the
things online.
But wouldn't it make more sense
and and this is just my thought
process.
To require that if you're going
to require a dual language
notice public notice.
I'm that it would be in in a
broad circulation newspaper more
and and I don't like I said I
don't know you said the commuter
rail I believe I'm and I don't
know is that a generally
circulated newspaper like the
last persistent.
Representative book Mr chair
representative so we're we're
we're not requiring that that's
already in in in in statute the
requirement that they have to a
published both in English and
Spanish so so this Mr chair the
intention of this and and my
thinking on this is if the
Spanish language media is
available that they have to
publish the public notice in
that media so if it were and we
were in a community that that
that has a large speaking
Spanish speaking population but
there isn't
of Spanish language media only
English language media then then
the the agency the government
agency would continue Mr chair
Representative to publish their
notices in the English language
media.
A solution that doubt that they
could do in order to that the
publishers can of these because
going to do enlighten it that
this is just a suggestion or
throw out there is that the it
would be make it a lot simpler
if that English language media
newspaper created Spanish
section within the newspaper and
that way they will be able to
publish that Spanish language
and notice in that section of
the paper.
Thank you for that
thank you for that represented
Mr chairman I I I agree I I
think this kind of muddies the
waters
so I I don't know I guess I'm
I'm kind of on the fence on this
and and I really wonder about
What additional costs is going
to be to the local local
governments thank you know I
don't I don't know what.
Because I know currently when in
my field we have to.
The legal notices I'm and I know
that sometimes it can be quite
costly for the local government
so I'm just I'm I'm hoping that
by adding this to just another
Mandate on local government that
we're not going to have make
your city council go broke by
having having to check to pay
for another publication I'm so I
guess that's that's really where
I'm at and I appreciate you
bringing it I just don't know
that and as a Mr chairman with
us sometimes says I don't know
if it's ready for prime time
yet.
Thank you Representative Lara
thank you Mr chairman.
Mr chair if Representative if I
may answer up.
The the government agencies are
already required to publish in
English and Spanish so they're
already paying for that act
walks within that English
language newspaper the only
difference is Mr chair
representative use up if there
is a Spanish language newspaper
that Spanish that would go to
that newspaper not necessarily
English well so that I don't see
the additional cost because they
are already having to published
in both languages.
Thank you for that
Representative so it might not
am I not read it correctly that
it would be an additional
newspaper at different needs
from so are you eliminating the
that that the requirement that
they would have to.
They would have to put it in a
at in two papers I guess that's
my question.
Mr chair representative I'm not
clear on the on the question
that you're asking.
I'm so thank I'm thank you
Representative and Mr chairman
so Representative Fajardo it had
made that made the observation
that depending on what the
population was I'm that it would
have to it would it would
potentially have to be printed
in English and Spanish okay so
if that's the case
Representative
in this bill your requiring that
the Spanish speaker eight in the
Spanish newspaper and then if
you have a percentage of the
population that is in that only
speaks English that then that.
And would have to be posted in
the English newspaper as well so
that's where I that's where my
mind is going that it would have
to be published in two separate
newspapers and and correct me if
I'm wrong on that Representative
Mr chair representative black if
the Spanish language newspaper
is available then yes they they
they they would have to publish
that Spanish notice in that
Spanish language newspaper if
that's Spanish language
newspaper is not available Mr
chair representative then they
would be held to that to do
that.
Thank you for that
Representative and thank you Mr
chairman I answer.
Thank you Representative next we
have a Representative Montoya.
Mr chairman and Representative
Lara thank you so much for
bringing this piece of
legislation forward I just want
to comment briefly there is no
question I'm sensing that it may
not be ready for prime time but
I do want to comment on the
premise.
As a New Mexicans in the Spanish
speaking residents here.
I think it's super important
especially for New Mexico that
that we support multi lingual
communication across cultures
not only Spanish but the care is
the Navajo do what they want to
one I think that we have an
opportunity New Mexico to really
elevate.
As a professional dancer in the
nineteen eighties I traveled
extensively in Europe and I was
so amazed coming directly from
here to there how fluid and
supportive culturally you know
be it Spanish be it French be a
gentleman everyone had this
notion of multi cultural
celebration even to take the
duty to understand I I think I
know I'm getting up in high
level here but I think
principally in a in a nation
like ours that is a melting pot
I do not think our languages
should melt away so while I
applaud this effort.
I want to make sure that we
understand what we're getting at
it seems a little bit convoluted
and I'm not getting clarity on
what the premise of the bill
actually is I will stop their to
NIKIL back thank you.
Thank you Representative on.
Thank you members
Representative Lara
This is this is my
recommendation.
Many because there's a lot of
issues.
And
so I I would
I would I would recommend that
that the you and your expert and
again with the individuals that
brought forth
The committee of the statements
in terms of of why they feel
this legislation
should not move forward and I
think they address some really
important issues that are not
really clarified in terms of
what you're trying to do.
And
I think
Because you're making some
drastic changes in this
legislation.
I for one sponsored a similar
bill maybe about ten years ago
that brought in and Semanario
dental may call but I understand
that that publication is no
longer in service and and we did
it for the same reasons that
you're trying to do
on a smaller scale they just
wanted access to be able to
print the legal ads and that
but you're changing the whole
dynamics in terms of of
Okay this section of law that
not only includes other
newspapers but the way that we
identify the dissemination of
the legal acts and
because you've basically touch
on on certain things is that
you're changing publication.
To population that's a dramatic
change.
You know
You you also in terms of some of
the points at the opposition
race where there is that there's
gonna be some language in there
in terms of the availability
factor.
And also the issue of the way
that the court structure set up
in terms of the dissemination of
of
legal advertisements based on
court decisions
that they have to be done.
I think that there was no less
than weekly this this this most
additional is kind of also kind
of a red herring in terms of of
what you're trying to change
overall in the dynamics of
getting to the that this
dissemination and Spanish of the
legal lands and I think the bill
has really good stylistic
changes in terms of updating
certain terms and also it does a
good job in terms of the gender
neutral.
Elements where we take away that
he you know and kind of add
specific.
Individual
and then in terms of the coming
or add I think you have to kind
of because it was mentioned that
according to the criteria that
we basically have in place at
the coming of wrap doesn't
qualify.
So I think we need to kind of
look at that in terms of what we
add to the bill to make coming
right out qualify.
You know and
so those are just some
suggestions Representative Lara
but I think we can still come
out with something that gets us
close to what you want to do but
at the same time doesn't set
back what is already in place
you know with this that was
published publications and
establish processes you know
that really kind of our does a
whole three hundred sixty degree
turn you know with this effort
so that's my my suggestion
Representative Lara and I hope
you're amenable to that and I
hope that you have on access in
terms of contact information to
these individuals that are
brought these issues forward and
and then we'd like to see a sub.
hopefully by Thursday and we put
it first on our agenda.
If if you can get that done
quickly and in a timely manner
will put you first on the agenda
for for Thursday.
All right thank you thank you Mr
chairman thank you members of
the committee you are there was
some very there was a very.
Good points that were brought up
that now that I haven't
considered and I I do want this
you know this is something is
very important to me and I am
willing and open to to to
suggestions and changes because
what I want is for this bill for
for this bill to give people
access and and that's to me
that's what it's about is access
so I'll be more than happy to
contact the of the members who
who who made those comments and
and have those concerns and
maybe we can you know get
something hammered out as soon
as soon as possible thank you Mr
chair thank you Representative
for being considerate thank
thank you for bringing this bill
for members of.
Next on our agenda is house bill
one thirty eight
Representative Montoya to put on
your legislation increase fine
arts education program unit it's
all yours brother.
Mr chairman and members of the
committee and the audience out
there in in New Mexico listening
in it is a distinct honor to put
forth house bill one thirty
eight the fine arts education
units before I started like to
make sure that my expert
witnesses Christina Gonzalez
Curt Schmidt and Daniel fear or
moved into the proper position
to contribute today.
Scream over there is.
Okay so before I begin.
I'd like to share just a brief
story I am intimately familiar
Representative with our test
program record can you mention
those experts again in terms of
the order that you want them to.
In addition absolutamente
Christina Gonzalez primero
Segundo it's in your Kurt
Schmidt.
In amending.
Daniel fear F. E. A. R..
The waiting I I see them now
excellent.
Thank you for seeing okay.
I am intimately familiar with
the fine arts Education Act
funding I am a professional
dancer a painter previous to
coming back to our beautiful
state I have a great and
wonderful career my parents and
mentors throughout my elementary
education back in the nineteen
sixties I'm dating myself really
allowed for that expressivity as
a unique and and focus leader
that I am today.
Back in two thousand two.
I met an incredible now passed
on state Rep name Max call.
Previous to that five years
prior I was working in the
village of the village at my
local school of a hundred twenty
five kids and I started
something that ended up being
called the fine arts program for
K. six I raised about a hundred
thousand dollars and.
During that time the screen came
to life I can't tell you how
powerful it was to see the
attendance improve students
migrating the nexus of community
in the classroom it was palpable
around two thousand two and
picked up the Santa Fe New
Mexican and I read an article
that Max call was creating the
first provided money for the
very program I was working on I
left to the telephone literally
I called him that evening he and
his lovely wife had me to dinner
and they started to mentor me on
how I could bring funding to the
Espanola public schools and use
my model at the Villar the
elementary.
To work across our district so
for ten years I had the express
honor really it was the most
inspirational transformational
time in my life because I saw
the potential of New Mexicos
classrooms to honor our
languages our culture even multi
culture we had seventy five
artists teaching in those years.
Two hundred and seventy six
classrooms and more than three
thousand students whose lives
were transformed over that
decade.
Thank you for allowing me to
share that from that story a bit
of history.
House bill one thirty eight is
identical to house bill two
thirty nine from last year's
twenty twenty session which
passed this committee and the
house floor unanimously.
A bit of history due to an
unintended consequence of house
bill one eighty eight from the
twenty eighteen legislative
session school districts across
our state saw significant
decreases in arts funding.
House bill one eighty eight
changed the funding formula for
the fine arts Education Act
which which helps to fund
programs across the state from
tiles to Gadsden to Farmington
to Gallup Santa Fe Espanola.
What happened was we lost
funding that included supplies
programs and even many teaching
positions have been eliminated
I.
House bill one thirty eight
correct this loss of arts
funding by increasing the cost
differential multiplier in the
F. B. E. A. formula slightly.
Four point zero five two point
zero five four.
This small increase would nearly
perfectly offset the losses
suffered by New Mexico school
districts.
Here's the catch if adopted
house bill one thirty eight
would costs the state
approximately two point nine
five million dollars to restore
that funding.
My team has created is a special
many documentary film that helps
to tell the story of the arts
and education in our state of
New Mexico I hope you enjoy it.
Very.
Rolette.
Rotate.
I believe Gabby supposed to roll
it or just a roller yes if they
have one.
Okay.
We're patient.
The.
We can always go to our first
expert witness whether finding
that fill in the in the effort
to save time.
Gabby what what is the time
frame that you need to the role
that.
What what.
Is it a fine arts video that was
sent over by Isaac because of
those.
To use for today's hearing Avid
knows about it merry.
We talked last night.
Mr chairman of if I could invite
Christina Gonzalez to start
testimony and then perhaps by
the time she finishes it's only
a minute and a half we might
have the film ready what do that
thing Ellen to meet yourself and
feel free to address the
committee on the imports of
legislation and
Resentment I said you do of a
minute and a half presentation.
I I think it's a it's probably
about two minutes but I will
keep it short and sweet and to
please do that okay good morning
chairman Garcia and members of
the committee my name is
Christina once on this I am
chair elect of the New Mexico
and by re council on arts
education the council has been
advising the secretary of
education and the PED on arts
education in New Mexico for over
twenty years we are a consortium
of professional artists arts
educators and arts
administrators who advocate for
arts education in our public
schools and in our communities I
myself have been working in this
field for thirty years teaching
studio art at the college and K.
twelve levels as well as working
as an administrator and leader
in northern New Mexico at the
intersection of arts practice
arts education and arts equity.
This year I have watched arts
education become more important
than ever for children in
schools as they have been truly
discouraged by the social
isolation of the last ten months
I'm seeing kids singing and
dance draw and laugh in their
fine arts classes and I can't
help but notice the joy and
sense of community being created
and those spaces even online in
this online environment with the
intention arts classes can
provide the best of social
emotional learning.
We have a student in Santa Fe
whose family immigrated from
what the my last use of my and
heritage and this student shared
in a video with her teachers
with myself that she was
experiencing bullying in school
and she was ashamed to speak and
her home language and it was in
her art class when she had the
opportunity to paint a self
portrait and she depicted
herself with images from what
the model out from her village
and it was the first time that
she felt pride in her ancestry
it was in and through art that
she understood and expressed a
sense of self value and self
worth and and her teacher
reflected this back to her and
this is culturally responsive
education at its at its best it
goes beyond the token inclusion
of diverse voices it is about
fundamental identity affirmation
giving students the opportunity
and the agency to share their
unique voice and to know that
they met at our this is what we
do in arts education.
Beyond this year pandemic
closures the research is
unequivocal students who study
the arts have improved academic
outcomes achievement gaps are
known to decrease at schools
where the arts are central to
instruction the arts quite often
are is the vehicle to reach
disengaged students and arts
education will have long term
economic impact New Mexico is
among thirteen states with the
fastest growing arts and culture
economies in the country we
can't afford it to not fund arts
education at this time we asked
the committee today to support
and pass this piece of
legislation it's simply great
policy Mr chairman and committee
members house bill one thirty
eight will restore not increase
we're looking for a restoration
of funding that was lost in fine
arts programs across the state
The New Mexico Advisory Council
on arts education urges you to
support house bill one thirty
eight it passed unanimously on
the house floor last year and we
need your support to move it
forward this year thank you for
your time.
Thank you Christina
Gabby are we ready to go wrong
with the with the lower video
yes Mr chairman thank you for
your patience stamina share my
screen now.
Thank you giving.
I started western dancing
training I was about five years
old I have been dancing
traditionally since I've been
able to walk are is important to
me because it lets me express
myself.
I think there is a way for me to
express my creativity and my
emotions and my imagination my
first aha moment was at Rio
Rancho high school where I
realize you know this is what I
want to do arts education is
important because it's a
different aspect of kids'
amenity no other subjects my
teach them the the the Holland
doing something the arts teach
kids why art is just are there
so many so many more components
are going to working with it
it's not just one.
ILR item it's it's a music box
that has many many working
years.
That turned things that happen
inside the pretty.
This bill seeks to restore
funding that was lost a few
years ago to the finance
Education Act and it's important
to maintain programs give kids
all the access they need our
system microdistrict out rural
New Mexico for all the way to
our large deserves state
education it is very important
for students because it gives
them the opportunity to create
and to feel safe and and
supported by their teachers in a
social way and in a culturally
relative way our students get to
explore who they are when I
didn't have.
The capacity to use my words
they just tell me the dissident
express fully how I was feeling
I turned to dance arts education
in my mind from personal
experience it it activates a
part of your brain that core
classes or other disciplines can
we were not funded appropriately
we don't have to use to send
home with kids that was one of
the things that we were able to
accomplish this years to
participate together the funding
to to secretary is home for
students to use to someone who'd
set says the arts are for all
arts or extracurricular I would
remind them that
the arts have been internal to
the committee forever the first
indications we have a society of
human beings besides the bones
is our work the art.
Is the helping hand that's there
when you feel like there's not.
Thank you Gabby and thank you
Representative Montoya for that
Yes I have to expert witnesses
left there will be very brief I
like to call next Mr Kurt
Schmidt.
I'm yourself and feel free to
address the committee in terms
of
All right here support for
legislation as an expert on on
this bill.
A good morning chairman Garcia
members of the committee my name
is Kurt Schmidt I'm the
executive director of fine arts
for the Rio Rancho public
schools I also service past
chair of the New Mexico by the
council on arts education I just
want to add a few points is also
statement first of all I'm I
want to be a real life example
of what happened in districts
with the formula change in my
district we had to cut to full
time teaching positions last
year and let's clear this was
able to cover all one of those
positions and I was able to
reassign the other teacher but
not every district was able to
make such accommodations and and
many were were there for forced
to make difficult cuts also it's
been suggested that some of the
reduction we saw on fine arts
funding
After the formula change was due
to reduced student role meant
my own districts saw such a
reduction but even after
adjusting for fewer students the
formula change still would have
forced us to eliminate a
teaching position and finally I
just want to say a few numbers
are demonstrating a what age
house bill one thirty eight
would mean for arts programs our
state have the new multiplier we
are proposing this bill been in
place for this school year and
based on projections projected
enrollments Alamogordo for
instance would have received an
additional fifty two thousand
dollars for the arts programs
Santa Fe an extra hundred twenty
seven thousand dollars less than
US eighty two thousand dollars
Las Vegas fifteen thousand
dollars west Las Vegas twelve
thousand dollars bill and thirty
seven thousand dollars estancia
fifty four hundred dollars and
APS seven hundred eighty five
thousand dollars all these
amounts representing a
restoration of funding that
supports fine arts education for
New Mexico students so thank you
again for your time this morning
and we are export.
Thank you Kirk or that the for
that information and and lastly
we have
Daniel fear a Representative
Montoya and if we could also be
brief just wellness presentation
focused.
Absolutely Mr chairman thank
you.
Thank you Mr chairman my name is
Dan fear and I am the fine arts
coordinator for Farmington
municipal schools and I'm also
the chair for the New Mexico by
the council on arts education my
pleasure to speak before this
committee as chairman by re
council I work alongside
brilliantly creative and like
minded arts educators from
across the state all with one
goal high quality arts education
for the children of New Mexico I
have a few points I'd like to
make in support of funding
changes proposed by HB one
thirty eight first I'd like to
reaffirm in reiterate the points
that miss Gonzalez and stir
Schmidt provided the committee.
Second even though Farmington is
considered a metropolitan area
our connections are rural in our
schools are culturally diverse
with needed Hispanic Education
students the restoration of
funding will go far providing
more equity for a diverse
classrooms.
Multiple studies have found that
race ethnicity and socioeconomic
status can predict a person's
access to the arts and culture
of the community it with
minority and disadvantaged
students having the least
access.
Other studies have shown that
the same students have a great
deal to came from the vibrant
arts education and are dependent
upon their schools to give it to
them the gains occurred academic
with a skip that finally
Farmington and many other
communities throughout the state
have received designations as
New Mexico arts and cultural
districts our school should
reflect contribute and nurture
that arts community thank you
for your time and your
willingness to listen.
Thank you thank you for that

Good morning Mr chair and

Clarissa due to and I'm from
Espanola New Mexico and I am the
director of T. two twenty thirty
two you actually we're a
progressive grassroots
organizing league I grew up in a
but I am coming to you today to
ask you to support this bill
because I grew up in a home that
highly valued the arts I was
awarded the rating as superior
four years in a row in the state
music competition and piano this
helped me to receive a caller
college scholarship in music I'm
I went on to my degree in social
work and I am a community
lifelong community organizer but
without the arts my soul would
be on the field so I and my
actually ask you today to
support this bill and to support
youth and adults you know
growing youth growing into
adults who will be well rounded
individuals who will be able to
contribute to their communities
in more ways than you know then
just business as usual but
really coming to our our world
by bringing their souls through
the the fine arts
again thank you to the sponsors
to the experts to all those in
support thank you Mr chair thank
you committee members and please
support this bill thank you Mr
not that does that on our this
participation I will go to
committee for questions
discussion Representative
Serrato questions.
Sorry thank you so much Mr
chairman thank you to the
sponsor of this bill I you know
I'm I'm curious I I appreciate
that the change in there I do
know that you know we were just
got.
Hi can you hear me.
Okay yes we can thank you Mr
chair and representative for
bringing for this bill I know
we've all been kind of talking
about the appropriations this
year and I'm curious you know
there has been increased to or
what may hopefully be increased
to public education this year
and I'm just kind of curious how
this change would impact on that
as well.
Is.
Mr chairman and representative
thank you so much for that
question.
It is true that just yesterday a
draft budget was unveiled to us
in the house and it's it's in
the billions of dollars I
believe the numbers three point
three nine billion for increases
to K. twelve it.
With that risk funding loss of
learning K. five plus it's a
hundred and seventy five million
dollar bond.
I realize that even a small
multiplier change can amount to
a cell that might seem a
challenge to find but when we
look at how are outcomes in New
Mexico have been characterized I
believe the word is dismal.
The Yazzie Martinez lawsuit has
pointed to the in.
Credible in equity.
And the fact that we have not.
Fully in my opinion ever lived
here for almost forty years in
our education system in the
public setting embraced our
culture and our arts and our
languages in a way that is in my
opinion a missed opportunity to
answer your question more
specifically working very
closely with members of the
Education Committee.
I have a meeting tomorrow set up
with Secretary Stewart I have
one following that with.
Chair woman Lundstrom I know
it's a little bit quote unquote
late but if we can argue for the
restoration of this vital
funding on behalf of the social
emotional learning the wellness
of our students emerging from
COVID if this passes that we
restore this funding imagine in
one year from now we will have
replenished this vital stream of
arts learning that is so
essential for the state of New
Mexico I hope I answered your
question sufficiently and I'll
report back any news they get
from those upcoming meetings.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
to Representative for the bill
and for the answer you know I
think I don't have much but I
want to actually arts high
school and I actually attributed
directly as the sole reason wind
up getting into Stanford because
I additions and that was a
unique thing that I was able to
bring to the table really
express what I ended up using
was when we sell this piece an
abuser Shakespeare which I think
was a good summary where was
that at that time and so I do
think that there is a place not
only as so many of the speaker
said of the filling the soul and
having an expressive place but
also it does contribute to a
person as a whole and and growth
and everything like that so I I
do see that a hundred percent
I'm I would love to hear more
about your conversations with
the chairwoman Representative
and chairman I'll not primarily
just because I want to I I from
what I'm seeing here you know
the increase according the FIR
is I believe it's a two million
you know more would be from that
amount and again as you pointed
out we have an increased a
hundred seventy five million
that seems to to to to meet you
know around a one percent
slightly more than that you know
increase I think that makes
sense I'm just making I just
want to check in and hear from
her if I know they do everything
by the the formula and to make
sure that would kind of jive
with that as well thank you so
much I will be supporting this
bill today and I look for the
for the conversations as it
comes forward thank you Mr
chairman and Representative
thank you so much for that
question before we go on to the
next member I want to reiterate
that this is a restoration of
funding in twenty eighteen it
was removed.
And I'm gonna fight like heck
for this in plain language it is
so essential I yield back thank
you Representative the next we
have Representative Castellano.
Thank you Mr chairman
Representative Montoya
you know I've with
Representative Serrato I I've
seen my wife has a landfill
cortical my latest.

Representative Montoya

dance school violated shown of
the boardwalk area and you know

walking very into it you know
every shot in the and then they

Income sole outgoing because
their presence on stage there

is is amazing and you know I I
am also concerned about the
budget but I know that you know
if you have that meeting I know
a I don't want Strom this to
give you a chance to meet with
her and and I am also in support
of this bill Representative
Montoya Mr chairman thank you.
Thank you resent because then on
and lastly we have
Representative the line.
But thank you Mr chair and and
and sponsor for bringing this
bill forward I think.
This is one of the most
heartfelt
Funding that I think I can speak
to I went to
school and Santa Fe New Mexico
and it is a Catholic private
school from grades one through
eight and we were exposed to the
arts in just a very a lot of
ways to a culturally and we had
to we had
Every go the hill one of our
renowned artists in New Mexico
as one of our instructors for
many years because his children
what is what attended the school
with us and she is
has studio was literally right
across the street from our
school from our playground so
having that exposure at a very
young age and then having in in
the cultural
Education that came with that
throughout that that really
education was was vital I think
it really
Made a difference in my life and
the lives of our of the students
in my friends and you know we
still get together and talk
about that and have some pride
in that and then I went on to
study arts in the fine arts at
UNM and this make arts and so I
can speak of teaching in the
schools because we don't have we
don't have the funding and and
our public schools and actually
even going to the schools in
Espanola
you may know press yellow Garcia
who is a a native there too Rio
Arriba and that's make R. two is
teaching the schools and and
other of other students for
teaching another public schools
because there wasn't any funding
and these programs so I want to
say how important this is
ensuring.
Hearing you bring this forward
I am I am so delighted and happy
and understanding that this is a
note that the funding formula
and the budget was changed or
for that PED I'm sorry was
changed that this funding was
taken out two thousand eighteen
I'm not happy with that and so I
I stand with you and getting
this funding back into into the
budget into our schools because
it's very very important
And I to Ms and I have a bill
that's kind of a.
In line what you're doing to get
of funding to after school and
summer programs on the same the
same vein of what you're
speaking today and the
importance of recovery of our
students it's essential and the
funding for those of those
programs is inefficient as well
within the budget so I just want
to say I support you fully with
this I understand you on on such
a
A wonderful level ensuring the
fine arts background with you
and with with many and I just
want to make sure that we're
getting that opportunity to
our students across New Mexico
so thank you to all those that
spoke to this I fully support
you and join you in your efforts
thank you Mr chair and thank you
to the Sanchez.
Thank you Representative next we
have a Representative Fajardo.
Thank you Mr chairman and thank
you Representative I move a do
pass.
Okay we have a do pass
recommendation
Do I hear a second.
A second.
we have a do pass recommendation
by Representative up article in
a second by Representative that
was Representative Serrato is
there further questions
discussion on the motion.
I just have a brief comment
You know we we.
Our members kind of mention.
Kind of initiatives in terms of
kind of mainstream initiatives.
With the.
I know the fine arts.
initiatives in your specific
schools our communities and
But there was initiative an
initiative on as as director of
community center they're not the
school.
Some valley
We established a street theater
group made up of high school
students entry around the high
school.
And
The director was need done in
that state that she kind of came
out of of the moment.
so all right states.
And she studied under respond
just.
And you won't believe the impact
that that street theater group
from high school students that
we are on the high school.
Did in quelling the violence
between District ganks and
southbound.
And the central metro area.
And I'm telling you.
It was incredible.
In fact they did outreach.
That thank dear group did
outreach to the state ban.
And actually brought a theater
group of bedroom prisoners from
the valley to perform before the
street gangs that further led to
a quelling of the one.
To where these gangs.
Develop an intramural basketball
league you know these are these
are games that were killing each
other on on that my monthly
devil you know and so to show
you the power of arts in terms
of kind of bringing harmony.
To kind of apply meant scenario
situation so members were on a
do pass recommendation of
Representative Montoya do you
wish to close on your
legislation.
Chairman Garcia and members of
this committee thank you so much
for the warm reception and the
kind words the passage of this
bill will take my first bill to
the house floor I'm gonna get to
sing I I understand if if if
that's correct.
Is tradition but more
importantly I think we're not
gonna have any problem with the
the why arts education is
important I think any breathing
human with understands the
importance as this young man
rate in will make you go.
I think it's the how how we fund
this and how we car about what I
call a healing modality you know
we I've use the arts as a form
of medicine.
To move children from a place of
trauma to trust for thirty years
I can defend this to the last
breath because I know it saved
my life so in closing I will do
my diligence before I hit the
floor to make sure I have the
clearest concise answers from
those powerful beings that will
help us to Kirk about this money
and restore it.
I close on that in a you'll back
and thank you for the time thank
you Representative Montoya
underscore one last thought you
know as as we were as you were
closing on we do have junior
money.
And you know in your
conversations with the with the
leadership on these educational
issues
you might want to share with
them how we can move some of
that junior money into our this
initiative.
and and where do we park at.
You know what we have to park it
in individual school districts
or can we park it in the in the
larger Fund you know that school
districts can then take from so
keep that in mind because if if
you have twenty legislators that
put in fifty thousand dollars
each you got a million dollars
brother.
You know for this initiative so
so keep that in mind as kind of
an alternative to not being able
to get this in the budget
members are we have a do pass
recommendation on is there for
the question discussion see none
is there opposition to the do
pass recommendation seen none
that the record reflect that all
those present voting from
intervention in Montana you have
a do pass recommendation on
house bill one thirty eight.
Members are that's it for today
they're staying on hopefully
we'll have this up on the on the
Spanish news media of the
legislation and and some other
bills the attack also have a
great day and we're off to the
floor.
God bless you all we stand
adjourned.
Thank you.
