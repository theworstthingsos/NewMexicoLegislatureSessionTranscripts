If everybody remembers,
was it last year, Charles? We did the
pay
study.
Yeah, we appropriate money for this
pay study. And
so as Deloitte,
we contracted with Deloitte to
do this,
this is gonna tell us all
the pay bands.
Well, this report will,
but we're not gonna go through that one.
They've come up with a
number
and spoe is sitting over
here next to
Adrian.
They've come up with a number
that in our
shortfalls and where we're at.
And so we're trying to fix a lot
of this. So as we
go to the session,
we'll have the exact
pay bands where they're
short or who, what
agencies uh is
below and above and
we're gonna try to fix all those as we
move forward. So this
is a study I think 20 years
ago was the last
one,
2001 was the last
pay study. And
so we should be
tuned up as we move forward.
So who's gonna
start us
off?
>> There we go, Mr
Chairman members of the committee. It's so nice
to see you Selena
Bussy with Deloitte consulting.
I hope to lead all of the work that we
do in the State of New Mexico
on behalf of state agencies
and local government. Um
And it's just great to be with you.
I have the fortunate
opportunity to present to the LFC
back in January, um
which was sort of an interim status
report on this project and the
work that we were doing. It's
actually my colleague,
Devin, who's
joining us today, who has led
all of that work along with
the team. Um So he's really
gonna present today
and we'll be able to field any and all
questions that you have about the
project. And as you alluded
to Mr chairman, sort of the
next steps coming out of this as
you all prepare for not
just the summer, but ultimately the
60 day session. So it's
just really nice to see you. And
with that, I'll turn it over to my colleague,
Devin. >> Just remember
we're about 30 minutes late. We
told him to be at the prison around
230. So
we're gonna cut your pay or
increase your pay based upon
this presentation.
>> Uh Well, thank you, Chairman, thank you,
committee for having us today. Thanks for the
introduction, Selena. Um
So we have
been working with the state since
about mid-september
um on
five different work streams.
I know that the compensation
piece is definitely
um a large uh piece
of it and is on top of everyone's
mind, but we've also done
some other work
um that is connected to
just overall, uh helping
New Mexico review the
State um Personnel
Act and improve hr operations
and services. Um
And what's needed to do that
such as the underlying
um underlying
things such as employee
compensation.
So our work to
date, we have five
different work streams. A quick
call out. Um
You might recognize how there's no,
a three or a six.
Those were originally things
that we were potentially going to cover
that were cut out of um
our scope of work so
that it's intentional
that those aren't exactly
sequential. Um
But we started with
the Personnel Act review, uh
where we identified peer
uh states to
use as benchmarks
for hr practices.
Um We'll, we'll talk
about each of these more in
depth as we go along. So I'll just give
a brief highlight of,
of each. Um
A two, the process review.
We looked at the state
of New Mexico's current
recruiting hiring and classification
processes compared them to
the market. Um
identify potential areas
that we could improve, especially
around some processes,
procedures and technology.
Um We then
also looked at the market,
competitive analysis, looking
at the state's
offerings of salaries and
benefits and how those compared to
the external market.
Um We looked at
the job classification review, uh
looked at the existing job
classifications, we know that
uh historically, this
went up from a number of about
200 back
in like 2000 and
it slowly crept up to
I think we were at close
to 1000 um
individual state classifications. So
we took a look at those as well.
And then we also
administered a statewide employee
engagement survey
um that touched
every employee across all
agencies um to
really understand what the
drivers of employee
retention um as
well as employee attrition
were across
agencies.
So looking uh
first at the Personnel Act
Review, um
we identified 10
peer states, we worked with Spode
DF and LFC to
figure out exactly what were
the right comparisons.
Um They were mostly based
on similar
geographies, similar uh
ratio of
uh total
total population to
employees at the state.
Um As well as what
type of hr they have, whether
we want to make sure that we had a good
comparison of
folks who of
states that were, had
a centralized hr
offering model that had a strong
central hr that really dictated
things as well as comparing
um to states with
decentralized hr
operations such as we see
in New Mexico where agencies have
their own hr people. So
um these pure states
were Arizona,
Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada,
Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Texas, Utah and
Washington. So a lot of
states uh within the West
region and neighboring states.
Um So what we found was
there were a few policies
um that could
be updated
by looking at some of the
peer states to find
out. For example, if Colorado
had a
good
stated policy on
how they actively
promote um
employees there. So we
really dove deep on
finding that research and
finding what our peer states
are doing and what's working well for
them. Um
So in the improvement selection,
we had uh
some
um some areas
that we could improve, such as accelerating
the selection to offer process,
we know that's uh
slightly a little bit
long, modernized the
candidate evaluation and
selection process.
Um Potentially
meaning looking
at the ability
to maybe
move away from the minimum
qualifications. Um
As for each
position, again, not to
blankly
blanket
blanketly
state that we would
do that. We know that there are key
uh things like
nurses where you absolutely need
minimum qualifications
um within the
classification policies.
Uh We,
I think that we saw what we
saw was there wasn't really any
auditing requirements to
maintain the job classification
system as we've seen. That's a
reason why it's maybe gone from
200 classifications to a much
larger number these days.
Um
There
should be
some uh
again,
recurring evaluation
of making sure that the
classifications reflect the
job nature, level of
scope and the complexity
of the work that's
being performed
um as well
as also in the
compensation
related um pieces
of the policies. Uh
We recommend
that uh we
know that the State of New
Mexico currently does have
a class, a
compensation philosophy.
It does
not say
much, it doesn't have exactly
the, the details that
um we
would typically see with the compensation
philosophy. So
developing a more detailed uh
philosophy that articulates
the guiding statement on pay
defines the market on
which um we compete for
talent. If you ask,
I, I'm, I'm sure that
if you ask folks around the state,
what's, what's the market
that we're comparing to, you'll get a variety
of different answers. So having
that consistency
of what the state
of New Mexico defines as the
market in which they compete for talent.
Um is certainly
certainly um
an area that we can
explore um
documenting the targeted pay
position. You know,
we've heard a lot
of folks say, hey, yes, we want to
be paid at the market
median. Um Having
that with, if that is the case,
putting that in writing, if
those, if there are the
econom economic
realities um
to where that might not be
possible, you know, actually
documenting that. So those
are the kind of just the details that we
would see in a composition philosophy.
Um It's really, really built
out with a lot of
rigor.
Um
And then also defining the
standards on which compensation
surveys we select again.
Um You know, any employee,
any person really
can go to Glassdoor,
can go to these online
surveys and all this public
information and say, hey,
I I have proof that I am
being compensated
below market. Um
but actually having a
vetting system and putting
it in actual writing
on what we consider to be a
valid um
source of comparison
for our salaries
um is also something that
we, that we found in our personnel
act
review.
Um We then
also looked at
the hr processes
um that really
govern the hr operations
across the state, whether in
o or in the agency.
Hr um
we did a lot
of stakeholder engagement during
um during this work stream,
we had many
interviews, many focus groups
um where we talked to,
I believe over 35
different professionals.
Um We reviewed the
policies of the procedures,
the processes as well as the underlying
technology that we use
um to get some
of these key
uh hr operations
performed such as what do we use
for recruiting and hiring, what are our
policies there?
Um What we
found here
was there was
a lot of
prolonged hiring times.
Um And when we
first asked those questions, you know, the
first answer we get was essentially,
I'm not entirely sure a lot of
the times these,
I don't know where my
request is in the process.
Uh I don't know
who's in
charge of approving it at the next
step. Um So really
having just that
lack of transparency uh
was something that we noted. Um
time, time and time
again from what we heard from the
stakeholders.
Um We
also uh
you know, that heard that
sometimes there's just a
reduced
uh ability, there's just
a lack of funding to
hire at competitive rates
which then contribute to
um the lower
uh the lower
levels
of uh
or sorry, the higher levels of the
vacancy rates,
um We heard
with recruiting sometimes it's tough
to get the actual
quality candidates that we need.
And that might be because
of, um, you
know, inefficient ways that we
advertise these jobs.
There's not a lot of proactive
outreach.
Um There's just
limited external
engagement.
Um
Some of the policies
that we have again, as I mentioned around
the minimum requirements,
um disqualify
a lot of folks who
actually could perform
the job very well.
Um So having those, those strict
minimum qualifications just a
off the bat um
really disqualifies a lot
of quality
candidates.
Um the career mobility,
there's a perceived uh
limited career
mobility and unclear
professional development.
Um whether this
is from
people not
understanding where they can go
just based on their job
titles. Um They
might think that their only way
that they're going to be promoted
is if their boss leaves,
if their boss is not,
um you know, is,
is not going
anywhere for a these folks we
heard there might be instances where
someone says, well, I don't know
how my career is going to grow
within this agency. Best
case scenario in that they look
for a job at another agency.
So at least the State of New Mexico retains
them. But frequently we hear
that people just leave state
government
um in
general because because
they don't know where their career
development and their career
path goes.
Um and then also
just with the technology, we've heard that there
is just a lot of uh there's
a lack of
automation um
in advanced tracking. People don't
know where the recruiting and hiring,
they don't know where the requests are.
As I mentioned,
um there's no
easy way to do this. People
do it outside of the system,
they track where
the steps within just the
Microsoft Excel
document that then has to
be emailed around. So that
lack of a technology and a center
technology that people
use. Um We
know that there is this capability
and share, but we heard that
um folks don't
necessarily use it as
much as they
should.
So um a
big piece of
of this workstream was
in uh late
November. We convened
30
plus hr
leaders from across
different agencies across the state.
Um In a full day future state
visioning lab where we
uh really challenged
everyone to think about
what the future of
hr services could
look like at the state. So,
meaning how do we actually
deliver the hr
services and the fundamental
underlying things
that the employees need so then they can
go do their jobs better.
Um So
we aligned on what the current
state was as
we've heard, you know, there
are there throughout
this whole process, there were things where
people said, oh, I
didn't know that
share had
an applicant tracking
system that I could use
that people didn't even know these things.
So um building that
awareness and, and kind of dispelling
some rumors um and
connecting all on the same page was
a big, was a big win
of this future state visioning
lab. Um We
then collaborated
together to uh
build out what this
potential uh
vision of hr could
look like at the state
um to
figure out uh
how we best deliver these
services. Um And
then also just AAA key
side note of it that was really
cool to see is um
folks mentioned that they don't
have the opportunities to meet
as hr leaders like this
um as frequently. So
just being able to
collaborate with their peers and,
and share, you
know, exchange information
on what's working for them, what's not working
for them. Um That
was, that was a nice
unintended uh consequence
of, of bringing everyone together as
well.
Um So we
also actually developed a North
Star that was based
on the mission division and
values that were pulled from spoe
websites uh to
have hr be a collaborative
and strategic partner that
propels agencies forward
by helping them attract
retain and develop talent
by providing resources,
support and leveraging technology
to improve processes and
tools.
Um So that was one output
from the
uh from the future state visioning lab.
Another output
was this
large
uh intricate
um graphic
uh here that
really shows our uh
proposed go
forward hr
organizational model.
Um We know that right
now, the state of New Mexico has a
very decentralized approach
when it comes to.
Hr
oh, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry. We're on
slide six, I believe it
is. Sorry. Thank
you. Um
So we know that uh the state of
New Mexico right now is a
very decentralized
agency. We have, you
know, heads of hr within each
agencies to,
to, um
you know, deliver
hr how they see
fit uh based
on the unique needs.
That's a little bit unique
honestly from what we typically
see the decentralized approach.
Um but it
really seems to be working
in large part for the state of New Mexico.
So what we
saw there is,
you know, if it's broken, I don't
think that there's any need
to vastly overhaul
this, you know, just maybe
have more
tweaks. Um
Then anything we know that there
was some historical
attempt to centralize hr that
didn't exactly um
didn't exactly go
uh smoothly.
And that's, um
you know, that's not the
recommendations that Deloitte's
putting forward.
Um based on
a, we know that it didn't
work in the past and it, we don't really
see a need um for
that major of a change here.
Um So as you'll see in
this graphic, that's a, a
main piece of this is that you still
have agencies at the
center of this.
Um where ideally
the agencies still have the
ability to make the key
decisions
um that work
for them, make this
to take the strategy that's going
to work for them that's going to meet their unique
needs. We know that the Department
of Corrections have very different needs
than the Department of Health and the Department
of Transportation.
Um
So
having the agencies retain that
ability under,
you know, some wide-ranging
parameters
um is really
the, the overall
kind of consensus that we heard from
that future state visioning
group um
surrounded by the agencies is this
digital workplace. And that really
defines how work gets
done in the future
with uh
technology such
as um you
know, automated process that
helps us automate processes
a little bit easier. That makes
us um you know, that
allows transparency
um into
what we're doing.
Um the
hr operational services,
this could potentially be
and again, this would this
whole um
graphic that we have here would
still need a lot of decisions to be made.
So this is not to say that
Deloitte says, hey, here's
the completely the answers there would
need to be
decisions um
made around
the exact details a little
bit more. But so with the hr
operational services, uh
this is what we would consider more
of like the transactional
hr things. So think
of you things of like vetting
that somebody needs the
absolute minimum
calls, um
processing, leave, processing
benefits. This
there are certain
activities that we think
might be able to be handled in a
centralized area
that takes away from the
burden of
agency. Hr And again,
this would be up for further discussion,
but we would imagine that
this could be the type
of hr work
that agencies are doing that's holding them
back um that
they don't want to do.
Um
We also have hr strategy
here that this
would be like the leaders of
um different agencies,
different thought leaders from
across the state that meet
on somewhat of a frequent basis.
Um to really course
correct on what this or, or
to build
and then potentially course correct on any
strategies like what is the state's
overall recruiting
strategy? It
shouldn't be vastly different
from agency to agency.
Obviously, again, having the
agencies have the ability
to retain
um retain
those decisions and those
strategies to, to recruit
the way that they want to select the actual
candidates they want. Absolutely.
Um But there should be
more uh
concerted effort
on certain things like, hey,
how are we establishing potentially
a pipeline for talent coming
out of universities in
the State of New
Mexico?
Um And
then just two other
quick call outs. Um The
hr leadership over here,
it's intentionally um
meant to show that this is
both hr
leadership as well as
key senior agency
uh leaders
to again, just
really kind
of hammer home the
point that this would be a collaborative
approach between
hr across
the, across the
entire state.
Um And
then we have these
things called potential centers of
expertise. These would be experts
who are dedicated to
handling certain things like
reclassification request,
maybe make making sure
for example, that performance
management is handled the
same way uh across
the state. So having
those key key
hr um specialized
uh specialized
areas of expertise
controlled within some
community. And again, that doesn't
necessarily mean that this is centralized by
any means. Um
But having those people
um create more
consistency would
be a huge
win for the state of New
Mexico.
And again, I just wanna II
I really want to, to point
out that. Um
so Deloitte, when we came
to this, the future state
visioning lab, we had, I,
I believe it was three different operating
models that we
typically
see um
see within state government.
We, what we actually
developed with
the hr leaders
from across the state was a mix
of two of the
operating models to
uniquely tailored to
New Mexico's needs.
Um So
this is, this is certainly not,
you know, an off the shelf
sort of solution.
This is very much tailored
specifically to New Mexico's
um New Mexico's
unique
needs
moving on to
slide seven. So this is where we
start to talk about the
compensation and
um
benefits.
Um starting with the benefits
offerings
um a little bit
across the board.
Um What we found was the medical
offerings were uh
slightly below the market.
The dental
was kind of in between
uh at market and above market. There
were um a couple
state, a couple neighboring states that
actually also provide really good
um, dental
uh offerings,
vision was right at
market the
disability, um
because many
employers now pay
for um short term and long
term disabilities.
Uh This actually kind
of bumps uh the state of
New Mexico down, um
as the peers are,
um starting to
um cover the cost
themselves.
Um Life
insurance was
pretty much at market and then
um time
off the annual leaves
part was below market
and the amount of holidays
um was
pretty much right at
market
when it comes to compensation.
Uh We found out
that what was actually
kind of surprising um based
on what we heard
initially, uh the
perception we actually
found that um
the compensation when compared
to the government
industry um is
actually about 10%
above um
the market median. But
when compared to your
general industry, um
it was about
4.7%
below the market. So,
um you
know, when we were
thinking about this, we then
after conversations between
LFCO and D FA,
we really decided
that the more apt comparison
was the general industry. You
know, if you are an hr professional,
if you're a finance professional, an it
professional, you
can work for the state, but you can also
then go work in Albuquerque for
a hospital. You can, you have a lot
of other, you know, employer
jobs. So just to think of the
comparison against,
against the government market,
um,
isn't exactly the most
apt comparison.
Um What
we also found out right now is that
there are, there's a total of
11 different salary structures.
There's over 100
individual um
pay plans and pay
grades.
Um One of
our recommendations is
to move to one
single pay structure
that
incorporates
um
all the employees at the
state. Um So this would
be a larger pay
structure with 20 pay
grades within it.
Um It's easier to
administer, it works
for um it
works for everyone.
Uh Under this,
um under this
proposed new salary structure,
15%
of the about
11,000 employees
covered by our benchmarking survey
would see an immediate
raise to the minimum
of their new pay grade.
Um And
44% of
employees would
see, although they
might not see an exact
immediate change to their pay
there, they would now be
in a pay grade that has a
higher maximum,
which is
indicative of a future
opportunity to gain more
money. So even though if you're
not impacted
directly right now, it does
um you know, increase
your potential
turn,
um, moving
on to the next slide. Um,
as, as we noted here, this is
really just, um, looking at the
exact at the structures.
So I kind of touched on a few
of these things already.
Um, the fact
that there's 11 different structures and
we know that, you
know, this is the
result of small changes such as
attorneys getting a new pay
structure because the
current pay structure, we couldn't
hire attorneys at
competitive rates within it. So
attorneys now have their
own pay structure and we
know that there was a minimum wage
increase for all state
employees that
um made
some levels uh a little
bit different. So that's
why you, that's why we kind of see
some inconsistencies
in how much,
what we call a midpoint differential.
The difference between the midpoint
of one pay grade to the next pay grade
is usually you would see
that uniformly or
increase, um
at the same rate, it
might start from 10% and
move all the way to 15%.
It's a little bit, uh
it's, it's a little bit all over the
place. Uh right now.
So opportunities
for enhancement here is transitioning
to a single structure.
Implement um consistent
increases to the midpoint
differentials extend the
pay grade progression.
So you have slightly wider
pay grades to allow for
more um more potential
earnings without having
to necessarily set yourself up
for immediate um
pay increases.
Um and then potentially
you know, also re-evaluate the
benefits offerings
um to really
understand what the
employees want.
Um If for example,
you know, the consensus is
that hypothetically,
employees don't value
vision coverage as
much. You could
hypothetically take away some of
the funding for. Well,
let's say, take away, let me
stop, you could
reappropriate
funding into different offerings
that they value more
hypothetically.
All right, going on to the next slide here,
the job classification review.
um we know that there,
there's currently a lack of job
categorization. There is
some level of job
families um
that are a
little bit um
a little bit all over, all
over the place. Um
There's no documented career
tracks, there
is inconsistent,
inconsistent um
alignment to job levels.
We know that some um
some jobs
have Roman numerals at
the end to indicate
levels. Some jobs have
the A bo
um some have the
word senior in them.
Um So the lack of
standardization and job titling
can be confusing all
of this contributes to that
perception where people
think that they might have that
limited insight into where their career
path um
can be at the state
government. So
ways that we can enhance this is
to look at standing
up a classification center of
expertise that really focuses
on uh recurring
evaluations of
classifications
to see if they still make
sense. Um
There were instances and I know that
spoe did a did a good
job cleaning up. Um
A few months ago, just
a, a lot of classifications
that were technically still
active, but haven't had anybody
in them um for
a long time.
Um
So, redesigning the state's job
architecture um by
defining job families
subfamilies, creating
um consistent criteria
between levels for
positions. Um
Not only, not
only does this
help,
you know, dispel a lot of the confusion
that might be going on right now, but it also
helps employees
understand what their career paths are
better. It can help
look into
areas of pay
inequity. Um If
we believe that there might be
instances of that happening when
you have these um
job classifications that are
more apt to the
actual uh
job responsibilities and
the duties that they're performing. It's
a better way to
compare the work to see
if people are actually being
paid
equitably.
Um Also we heard from the
last time in the January
um hearing
that there was
some interest um and
need potential for
analyzing the workload of key
positions. Um
especially I believe around like
social workers and child
um placement
services. Just these folks
who have really, really high
caseloads I thought was
interesting is in some of these instances,
we actually saw that they were
technically being paid
above market compared to
other social workers.
But there is this perception here
that that doesn't really tell the whole story
because of the demands that are
placed on them and the caseload.
Um that
yes,
by the data they are
being paid competitively. But what is
being asked of them is that is
way more than normal and is
might not be really telling
the whole
story.
So, moving on to the
stakeholder engagement and employee
survey, um we
came out with this a a few months
ago um had really good
response, I believe we got over
6000
responses from state
employees. Um
Overall, the
state, the questions
on culture were all
um really positive.
Um Some of the top reasons
that people are staying is
the ability to
maintain a work life balance.
Um The benefits are still
perceived as being
competitive um
And adding to reasons
that people want to work here
um as well as
relationships with managers, which is,
you know, I think feeds into the um
positive uh
the positive statements on
culture. Um
We did see that compensation was
listed as the number one people.
Number one reason that people are
leaving um the
lack of uh
flexibility in remote
work um as
well as the negative
work environment and no sense of
belonging.
Um
So opportunities
that we can do to, to enhance
this is, you know, evaluate the telework
options. Um
And combine that with the real
estate strategy. If there is
a need, we know that
um this is a
topic.
Um that's,
that's, that's been in
discussion um at
New Mexico. So it's, it's
certainly just maybe something to evaluate
what the options are
um establish
a unified marketing
and branding strategy. So people
really understand what their career
looks like at New Mexico,
especially to help with the
recruitment. Um
You know, we've heard sometimes people
say, well, yeah,
II, I get
the, I get the pitch
from dot
For example, or I get the pitch from
the Department of Corrections.
Um And it, it
feels like I understand
what my career could look like there,
whereas it might be more helpful
to really pitch people on the idea of,
hey, this is how you can work
at the State of New Mexico. This is what a
robust career um
opportunity can look like for
you as well
as also implementing an
onboarding program. We know that that
exists uh in, in
the local agencies
um and building
awareness for the existing
professional development curriculum.
That's again, something that we
heard. We heard people
say we wish that there was
more uh professional
development opportunities.
Uh We then
went back to oe and
you know, they pointed out that
all of these trainings exist.
So it is just a awareness
um challenge
in that.
So the key takeaways on the last
slide here um and opportunities
for the state of New Mexico.
Um We identified
88 really
tangible things that the state can do.
Next three of which we
think might be the most impactful
that being that redesigning the
state's job architecture
um to provide
more clarity on employee career
paths, to help with the
recruitment, to help with
workforce planning,
um
implement the hr operating
model that was developed in
November by the HR
agency leaders
um and then
procure and implement
an hr data reporting and
digital technology
uh workflow
technology um such
as hypothetically
uh service. Now,
um these things, they can
really just speed up
key processes such as recruiting
and hiring. So we don't lose
talent um just
based on the sheer sheer amount
of time it might
take.
And with that,
we welcome any
questions.
>> That's a lot
represent what it
is.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair,
as I've stated before,
Mr Chair, I used to be a HR
director for um
state treasurer's office.
And so a lot of these
things you're that I'm hearing today
are a little
um concerning to say the
least. Um when I was an
HR director, um
I, I worked under the
previous administration and the current
administration.
So under the previous
administration, uh
that's when the
hr was completely
depleted and, and was trying to,
they tried to say they're
optimizing and cutting
government by over
30%
and
um
isolating uh
hr into a
centralized
place and that
didn't work. So we
are still filling the fallout
in our agencies as we've had
these discussions since I've become a
legislator or even before that I
knew
because
one key point I, I will
let for just
historical purposes, I worked
in an executive uh
agency office
and we were prohibited
from getting information or
using information from that
centralized, um from
oe when it was centralized.
Um So
that meant a lot
of problems and a lot of things I had to figure
out on my own. And
one thing that I didn't
hear you really touch upon or
maybe we were surveyed were
how hr
professionals really
um are
policyholders
and in charge of a lot
of the policy uh and workforce
policy and management of
those policies, especially when it comes
to um
dealing with
legalities
and investigations
and, and those sorts of things.
So
that's why it's, you know, it
was, it was
not beneficial for our
state to,
to centralize our hr
um department.
Um So I have to say that, but
when you talked about
share
and recruitment and
retaining and,
and
um
putting out um
putting out all the job
uh positions and everything,
what happened,
Mr uh Mr Chair and
everybody is that she cost
us quite a bit of
money to implement.
And we were trained, I mean,
we trained for two weeks
on how to use the new functionalities
of share for recruitment
and, and, and for jobs
and, and I will
say
that
it was confusing because as the
hr director, what happened
was then hr
lost some of their functionality
and a lot of, and this was all
by rule, then
they put
the
responsibility on to
management. So then
management has to
then um
track those
jobs and the recruitment and
everything along with. Hr
So that to me is probably why
they're not using share.
So there's a disuniate,
there's, there's not communication
there. So I would look at
that, I didn't hear too much
about that. Why
it became cumbersome for them
to share because it did
everything. It was a great, it was
a good, it was a little cumbersome.
It could be tweaked and it could be
updated as far as I
was concerned, the big disconnect
for me and for other
hr uh folks was
that we then
put the responsibility for
that recruitment onto the
management and that was
a disconnect. So hr
then lost some functionality there
and the tracking and everything. Then,
then you, you're, you're
telling management
that they're responsible and they
need to follow up and there are deadlines
and there are set times for that
recruitment process.
It wasn't happening. It was, it was
really cumbersome for me when that happened
to be honest with you. Um
And I complained about that.
Um When you're talking
about
the an hr
collaborative, we had
an hr collaborative
and we worked,
we'd have monthly meetings
and I mean, it was, well
attended
and we
also had representation from
labor.
I didn't hear anything mentioned about labor,
what's going on with labor and
our connection. And that also is a
policy function for hr
and really understanding
what is going on with their labor,
with their labor unions
as a
workforce.
Um
And there's different,
there, there are different
approaches of, of what happens
um through hr
and recruitment and jobs,
you have the executive
process through D
FA and you
have the classified process
in most of our agencies that are,
are non-executive.
And then you have the component of
labor.
And I didn't hear anything about that.
I don't know if you looked into that or if
that was any part of your
reporting with Deloitte.
But I think that this
is really great. I, I
appreciate what you've done here. This
is a lot because it's a lot.
I appreciate that you touched on
the, the way that um
jobs are, are
um titled with a
123 that's mostly
executive and then a,
you know, the OAB
all those sort of things was
operative and
then it's by
scale of
experience.
And so with an O
as A as a bottom
line, enter
entering into
state
government work
and then based on your experience
and, and everything else, there's a
whole worksheet, there's a whole
process of developing
qualifications
and then you can be
exempt from some of those qualifications
as well. I didn't hear
anything about that because there is a
process to that based
upon experience
as opposed to having
an education.
So it's cumbersome.
It's a lot of work and I commend
our hr folks out there because
it is hard and what
I'm hearing Mr
Chair,
we're going to get to the question, the
question is coming and I
guess,
and we're hearing from agencies,
I'm just putting this all together. I
mean, I guess I
could have helped with the report
myself.
But are we meeting, uh
did we disassemble
the HR um
group? And, and
what is going on there? Mr
Chair
>> represent that would be a question for
spoe if they want to come
up. We're
getting a short timeline. I got,
sorry, sorry about that.
>> Chairman, Representative
Lohan. We have HR council
meetings once a month again. Since
we've uh since
I've
taken over in uh
in November, we're having
one on Thursday. So we meet with the
HR community all the time. A
third of our state workforce
is represented by
labor unions. Um We,
we have uh uh meetings
with CW A
on Friday state
wide labor unions where agencies
are, are involved as, as well
as representatives. So we are,
we are in constant dialogue
with, with our um labor
unions and, and our hr community
to move forward to make sure that we're all
on the same page. We're answering questions
and so we are supporting
agencies the best we
can. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. So my last question is just
gonna be, how did you
um congregate or
get this, uh give
us a lot of this
information when you're
looking at the different,
um like I mentioned,
the executive
um hires
the classified and then
both, you know, classified and our
labor um
jobs and how,
what is, I don't see a
report on that and how you
assembled that information
or surveyed that Mr
Chair,
>> Mr Chairman and Representative,
we could go back through the slides real
quick, but the
unclassified
employees, whether they're,
you know, governor exempt
et cetera were not part of
this project. It specifically
looked at the classified
system employees within the
classified ranks. So
there's a bit of an asterisk there.
It also did not factor in
legislative employees. That was
another component that was not in
there or judicial. So
there are very specific groups as
you've mentioned that were not part
of this analysis. It did focus on
the classified system alone.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. So will those be next
steps in, in
some of the surveys? Some of the information
looking at this, the legislative,
the judiciary and
exempt
>> Mr Chairman and Representative I
think will, you know, defer to the committee
as well as the stakeholders of D
A and otherwise, if
there would be relevance in
next steps to the project
that would bring in those groups
for, you know, even further
analysis, >> Mr
Chair.
>> So one
thing is maybe we can clean
that those dots
and circles up for so we can read it
very clearly.
It's, it's kind of hard to read
between
the,
I'm sorry, Joey. Did you say
something?
>> So Mr Chair, we noticed
that as well. That was a
printing error. There's a clean copy
on the website.
So >> it's just
a little hard to read from, from
this perspective. So good
that things are clean. So it should be
in our packet to online.
So, I mean, at the
end of the day, there's
21,000
employees, 22,000
state employees. We're
roughly funding,
there's 4000 vacancies
roughly right now, we just did the
math.
2000 of those are
funded vacancies.
2000 are unfunded
vacancies, right?
And we're trying to get to the point
where are we, the people
paid at the right level? Are we not
exceeding pay and, and
benefits at in
this in
Gallup, we're gonna approve
a, a contract change
so they can finish the rest of their
study. Ando, I'm
sorry, I want to say Ian, but it's not
Ian, that's Ian over
there,
Dillon
Dylan and,
and
Ian,
right,
Devon.
Devon
too many.
I
and so they've been working
with the EXEC
and LFC
to figure this out and
o to figure out how
this study is gonna start
changing. I know that
they're gonna reduce our price on our
contract because we're not gonna fund
it at the 2.5 million
because we just
don't have that. So
you guys need to sharpen your
pencils and,
and get there and
then we're gonna come back during the
session and we're gonna fix all
this stuff within agencies
in the correct pay bands and the correct
pay levels so
that we don't see that
2000
vacancies.
One question that outside
of the scope. What
about dot Because they
have a high number of vacancies
where they on the list. Joey's shaking
his head. Yes. So we
did look at.in that
in that string of how
the pay is because I
believe they have
like 600 vacancies
or something like that. They're
one of the largest ones and then they take
that money and use it in other places.
So that's
very,
uh, or
look at, but they're
gonna try to work with
every agency reset
the structure, reset
Popo,
right?
And, and kind of start
from a baseline again in this
next year. So as
we head to the
session,
they're in talks with the unions,
right? The unions
are in conversations
with them about the,
the pay and the, and the
guidelines and
then we're gonna have
to decide as a legislature.
Do we want to do Telework or do we
not want to do Telework?
Because that's a big employee issue
across the board.
Is that split,
right?
And we'll have to mandate
that in legislation
because the exec pulled back from
it and then we had a
big
battle about that and, and
people, I don't know a lot of
people, I mean, we close on Fridays
and in our, in our office so
people can
have more time and
flexibility.
But at the end of the day, this
20 years, this 20 years
since the study, we're gonna wrap it up and
get one box
check that we completed something
and we're moving forward.
Now, the issue
is spe is not able
to handle that massive
change. That's why
Deloitte is going to help the agency
do that. Am I
correct
>> the
approach to compensation
that we haven't done for, for
um 20 years? Do we make
sure that all state employees in the
classified service, including
union employees in the classified
service are, are
adequately in the job
and doing the duties and
responsibilities uh at
that they need and then place
them on a, on a salary structure,
one salary structure, bring
them and uh all
together onto one salary structure
and then pay them uh at
least to the minimum and
starting addressing some of those issues
that, that we see with compaction
or individuals not
doing the in
roles, they're not doing the jobs for
and then paid appropriately.
>> And that may be individuals doing
two jobs for one. Right.
>> Uh absolutely chairman
and, and I must say that
this, that this project has
been, you know, uh about a year
long. It has been
a really, really great
relationship between DF
state personnel and
LFC Joy and
Miela here in particular. And then of
course, with, with Deloitte and the team
here um definitely
has, has uh roots
or now, maybe Devin is, is
getting roots into Mexico. So I
really feel like we can, we,
we can have, have a strong
um uh uh focus
to, to get this next project
done and have a, have a really great
deliverables and, and a project
to present to you. >> So
now when we go to here
agencies and they say,
OK,
I know dot Funded
vacancy rate is gonna be higher
than probably anybody else. PD
would be next. I think
now they're gonna come back and say, ok,
well, we did this study.
Are you correct? Right. And
you can hire that band. So you
have no reason not to
hire in that
competitive or in that market,
you'll be in the market to
hire for those
jobs. And so the
agencies will no longer have
that excuse of.
We got to go to spoe andos
not approving this and,
and everything else because it'll have
done a full
circle through every agency.
So, as we move forward,
we won't see that vacancy rate
as high. Then we should not see that
vacancy rate is high
unless it really specified
jobs. I think the one
thing that kind of touched in,
in my mind for,
um,
oh, for the hacking problem
within,
in, uh, not,
is it do it? That has all
the
cybersecurity?
Right. Did we
take a look at those paying
jobs? Because I know that's
a totally outside
market and that maybe,
you know, cybersecurity
rates are way up
here and
we, >> yeah, Mr
chairman and members
because the the
it professionals across the
state, whether you're talking about chief
information security officers
that live at the agency level,
because most of the agencies have a
CISO and then you have sort of
your broader governance
team and
talent that sits with the Department of
Information Technology because they're part
of the classified system, they
were part of this analysis.
Yes, but they are one
of the interesting categories
of employees that Devin
mentioned that live in
their own structure. So
they're one of these subunits
that have levels of
compensation titles
and the rules that they hold that
look different
and function differently,
which does create a bit of the disparity
in trying to understand across
agencies. And then if they happen
to work at the state centralized
it agency, what that
looks like. So certainly, you
know, cybersecurity never more
important than now and some critical
decisions for the state
to really make of
is the capacity to do it
to support those
efforts. And then where
are they going to be able to do that? Not
just for state government, but
localities, school
districts, cities, municipalities
that, that have some of those same
bandwidth constraints in terms of
attracting talent and retaining
that talent. So certainly
a bigger conversation in certain areas
like cybersecurity, but statewide
impacts without a doubt >> and
maybe those specialized deals, maybe
if you guys look at those and say, hey
maybe you guys need to pull those out
of an agency, right?
And coordinate because we've had two
that I know of. Right.
RLD and,
and insurance,
right? I know my
school district had one,
the hospitals had one
Bernalillo >> County is on that
list. Lots of, you know, city
and county governments are starting to find
themselves in those precarious
situations and,
and typically the need
for external consultants to be
brought in to remedy the
situation. But there
isn't always that next step plan
of how do we prevent it in the future?
They, they handle the, the crisis
that's in front of them. Um,
but it certainly is something that creates
a ripple effect across
all of public service when they're, when
they're going through things like what's happened with your
constituency.
>> And so maybe you ought to look
at those, those little
outliers a little differently
to tell us, ok, maybe
you guys ought to move this agency or
maybe I move that to
specified cybersecurity
department. Right.
I know that you want to do
everything for the entire state.
But I don't know if that's really
possible. I'm
not that, but if there's any more
outliers like that, that we ought to
look at specifically to do some
stuff then and
we can look at that.
But,
>> and chairman, if I could say
one of the thing, uh, members
of the committee, I mean, that's, that's the
goal here, a holistic approach
to all classifications whether
it's cybersecurity or
a management analyst all the way
down, making sure that those
positions are, are, are,
are described and, and
I guess appropriately,
um reflecting
of the qualifications and what the job
duties and responsibilities are
for across the board dot
Do it anybody in the
classified service and
then assigning whatever
internal value that a
steering committee or, or
group that we will, that we will
convene with hr leaders,
agency leaders to make
sure that when we have an
with cybersecurity, we have
do it or somebody at the table who
understands that. And then also
uh these great consultants who
can bring out uh you know,
market information with people who
may be narrow focused and
in, in, in, in their job. So I think
we really are poised to, to look
at all the
issues, all the classifications
and really make um
uh so some great
recommendations. Next, next
January,
>> we'll see the recommendations
in December
so that we can begin to, to
fix a problem because I mean, that's
going to be our last shot at,
at changes in the budget. But
what, what rough number did we come
up with Charles for, for
the fixes
12 million.
>> Well, that, that amount can
change depending on the work
that's done this fall.
Um But right now,
there's a, a targeted
amount of where people are
potentially falling out of the
new uh
minimums.
But what this next phase that
we're gonna be um
asking for a contract
approval and then we'll
do an RP
is to make sure
that when we're moving somebody
into a, a new job
class, say, like just
for discussion purposes,
an engineer that they're
actually like meet the qualifications
and what an engineer
does and that we're not
miss Miss um
classifying somebody as
we move into this new system that
would presumably go
live next
summer.
So that's why that number could come down
because there could be some people that have been
overclassification in the existing
system that will be
appropriately placed on a
go forward
basis.
>> And the number was roughly
12 million, but it could
change. >> Yes, chairman,
it was, I believe
about 12.8 million.
That was only within salaries
too like knowing that the
added cost of benefits
uh might
increase that number. But
and again, some people
will leave state
government, we
will hire new people. So,
but as a ballpark
that I would
guess it would be in that
ballpark,
>> not including benefits, but you may have
turn on one mic if you're not
using it because it, it'll back
feed. But I mean, that's
just, that's just 12
million, but that doesn't include
benefits, right?
So, and benefits may
be an additional
30 to 40%
>> if you, if you look at
it, if you
look sorry
Joey,
chairman
>> chairman, I just heard from Joey that
it's 16.6 with
benefits. I will say
state employees graciously
with your approval will be
enjoying a 3%
increase on July 1.
So that will help the the the number go
down as well.
>> Ok. Yeah, we just have to look at a
total overall number but the
cybersecurity sector
just I don't think every
agency needs a cybersecurity
guy if you have one key
with the with a
master code, right? That
controls the system. I think
that's other agencies are gonna have to
adjust to work through them.
So, all
right. Thank you guys. I appreciate it.
I mean, I appreciate
your time sharpen your
pencil.
We don't have any money in this
state, so just make sure you really
sharpen
it.
Yep. So we're gonna
talk about the tour for the prison
real quickly and logistics
and
Charles.
>> Great. So if you signed up for the
tour, uh we are
handing out a map
uh to the Western New
Mexico Correctional Facility. It's
just up the road,
um, go and park in the
parking lot and head into the main
administration
building and then
um the administrators
there will help process you and put
you in groups um
for a quick tour. We um.
