You one.
What?
You just
right
that
before we get started this morning, I
think
Sonny, I guess there's a congratulations
in
order.
And you didn't tell me
just joking.
You want to tell us about
it?
>> You know, I'll say what I've
been telling everyone this morning,
Mr Chair, which is never
schedule a committee hearing right
after your honeymoon.
Uh, it's not a
great start to
them,
but we're glad to be here
and, um,
uh, I'm still
in vacation mode so I seem a
little,
a little out, out of, out of
character. I'm, I'm just
very happy. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> We're, we're sorry, you're tired,
but that's called a
honeymoon.
And then we have one more thing, I
guess, uh, Senator Padilla's birthday
is today or
maybe we
could
thank you, chair.
Congratulations, Senator Padilla.
Congratulations Sonny.
Um, we're going to try to run
through these pretty quick and, and
yesterday gets a little long and a
lot of pages. I kind of glanced
last night and
over the two day period, I think we've
been through 457
pages of, I may be off a
few
of
presentations. Right.
And it's just a lot to absorb and
we don't absorb anything when
you have that much information.
So as we go
forward, get your bullet
points, get a 30 minute
talk, let's get to what you
really want to tell us what you really
need to us to know
so we can keep that in our minds and
keep it fresh and, and
keep moving. So Sonny,
you gonna start us off this morning.
>> Uh Yes, Mr Chair and thank
you so much for the
introduction with me.
Today is Superintendent
Gary Washburn
um from Carlsbad municipal
schools and he also has
Mindy Rogers here
from Carlsbad as well.
We're going to be in Tab K
starting with this
one page
performance and financial
report. Just the
highlights from
our analysis of Carlsbad's
information, the
districts performing on
par in both math and reading
proficiency rates
uh as well as four
year graduation was slightly higher
than the state average.
There's been a recent spike
in chronic absenteeism
rates and the district is
seeing a large influx in
oil and gas revenue,
which is driving a lot
of new
innovations at the district. And
I'll let the superintendent
and his team talk more about opportunity,
culture, which you're gonna hear about
multiple times today.
Uh They're also doing several large
capital outlay projects
and I'll turn it over to the
district at this point to go into
more detail over some
of those
points
>> hit the
button.
So senator
members of the committee. Thank you
for coming to Carlsbad. Uh
As I say, welcome to the
land of white pickups
and strong opinions.
Uh because I'm sure you've seen a
few of them. Uh We
uh this, this is an absolutely
magnificent community that
I'm starting. My six
years superintendent
in Carlsbad.
Um
I was, I'm
blessed to be here. I was
fishing with my grandson this
morning on that lake
right out there before I came
here. So it's
an amazing community
for all
kinds of things. Outdoors.
You can play a play
golf, go fish,
walk the river and
do that all in the space
of a couple of hours
and it's
just absolutely amazing.
Um The
school district is
doing extremely well.
Uh Charles Sal and
I actually,
our first conversation
was about
uh TC I
and where
Carlsbad was
uh with, with that
and with what that was going to do to
funding what I'm
happy to report is
that we have actually seen an
uptick in that
uh in the new
index and we are on a
path to,
to maximizing
our funding on that as, as
a part of it because
we've been aggressively
recruiting um
senior
teachers and
we are very focused
on raising
our student achievement rights.
So the
things I want to talk to you the most
about are uh
number one capital.
Uh We have been incredibly
blessed uh with
the amount of oil and gas revenue,
tax revenues that we
have, we are finishing
a $55
million
performing arts
center that will see
1800 people.
Uh We are
finishing uh we
finished uh
two schools in the last
year. We are starting construction
on a new elementary and a
new middle
school. Um
What is amazing about all
those projects is
they're all paid for
every one of them.
Um I've been
in this business a long time and
the ability to be able to
pay for things uh
from that revenue
is just unbelievable.
Um And we recognize
how blessed we are.
Uh I want,
I need, I need the
committee to understand where I
come from.
I graduated from Floyd, New
Mexico. My father was
a career educator.
Uh I went
to school
in Fort Sumner,
Dora Roy
and Floyd.
So I
grew up in very small
communities in New
Mexico uh
with those kind of educate,
with working with those
educators and,
and
playing basketball in
places like Encino
that uh Senator
Campos has talked about those
places going away.
And uh so
it is really important as
we move forward with the
blessings that we have
from oil and gas, that
we figure out ways
to maximize that
across the,
the state.
So
as Sonny said, our,
and if you look at our
dashboard, our
performance rates went
down and we knew that and
piece of that was COVID.
Um but we were really
focused on two things,
recruitment and retention of
teachers
and raising our performance
rates. Uh
We
visited uh
Hector County
and they
had brought opportunity
culture in and they had 300
vacancies
and they
had turned those
vacancies back
and had gone to the opportunity
culture model
to staff their
schools. And so
what they do is they take
a veteran
educator
and
they
spread and they
have them
serve as a coach
mentor for
six,
5 to 6
teachers
and
they,
and they do a partial release
model. We do a full release
and we'll talk about
what that looks like.
Um But
what we have
discovered
is that
our staff
at those schools
are completely
energized.
Uh our performance
rates, the growth that we've
seen, we can't get
the state test scores here fast
enough because I really
want to see if our interim
assessments are
going, are telling us
that we're going to see that kind of
performance on our, on our
state testing results.
But we're talking a year and a half
growth
in math and
reading at the
6th and 7th grade
level. And if
you look at performance levels
across the state,
middle schools are where
we are really struggling
to move the needle. And
so for what
we've done and, and
we were really blessed this
year, uh one of our
middle schools would not say they were
blessed, but we were really
blessed. We had one that was doing
opportunity, culture and one that
wasn't. So we actually
have a side by side model
where we have traditional
schooling and this going on
at the same time and we
can look at those results
and see what they are
and they are eye popping.
Um I, like
I said, you know,
I, a
year and a half, two
years growth, kids,
very engaged
teachers, very engaged,
principals, very
engaged.
Um So the bottom
line.
Um,
oh,
because this is
Senate Finance.
Um
So, um
I believe it's
25 is
total opportunity culture
cost. And
if you look at that, I've
broken that out by for
fiscal year
2324.
And what we project for fiscal
year 2024
25. Uh
public impact
is who we are using as a
consultant. Uh
We will spend
$397,000
with them this year.
Uh We will spend
$245,000
with them next
year. Uh They are
actually
designed their program to work
themselves out of a job so
that districts are
self-sustaining and running
it. So it's not, we're going
to be here forever. Well,
I, so uh and
Mindy is a part of that
because we
hired her out of Hector
County uh
Stoler.
Um They will
eventually speak to us
again. Uh
But uh Mindy
has really moved us along
a, a great
deal of ways.
Uh teacher
salaries that are
engaged in opportunity,
culture, those are funded
operationally. We funded public
impact with eer uh
this year, we will
fund public impact
with operational dollars
next year. Uh But
we had $718,000
in teacher salaries.
Next year, we anticipate
uh having a
million
$287,000
in teacher salaries.
The stipends were
100 and $54,000
for the MC
LS and they are
$292,000
next year.
The, the thing
about uh
the way we're using the
model,
if you are a veteran
educator
and you have been
with us for
15 to 20
years, you're
probably making somewhere in the
neighborhood of
$89,000
maybe a little more.
And the stipend as a full
release, MC L
is $20,000.
So those
teachers
can make as much as
a principal in their
building. And that has
created some interesting
conversations
about, you know, how do
we, how do we adjust
things? But
what the model does, it
also frees principles
up to do work
that they've never been able to
do because there's just not enough
time because the
MC LS are supervising
a group of teachers
to, they're responsible
for the data for that group of
teachers. Uh
They're dealing with the
classroom discipline issues
so that principal can
concentrate on other
areas in that building.
Uh And
our data analysis
is much more
robust.
Uh The
amount of attention people
are paying to it is,
is incredible.
Um So
total cost per
student this
year, it's costing us
$983,983
per kid to do
opportunity culture
next year, those costs will go
down to 759.
Uh We have 1408
kids that are being impacted
by it this
year. Um We
will have 2600
and 34 kids
impacted by opportunity
culture next year. Uh
We expect to see
a significant
rise in our performance
rates. Um
And Mindy at this point, I'm gonna
let you talk a little
bit about what
we do and how we do
it.
>> Um So, Doctor Washburn
um did provide
some slides that explain
a little bit more about our opportunity,
culture models. Um Starting
with why opportunity,
culture
and the reason that many school
districts decide to
work with this model is
to use strategic staffing
in a way that we've never used it
before. In our traditional
school models, traditionally,
teachers only had the
opportunity to move
up into any type of leadership
position by becoming an assistant
principal or a principal.
What this model does
is it provides teachers and
opportunity to take on leadership
roles and start coaching
and mentoring a small group of
teachers while still
remaining in the classroom if they
are partial release, MC
LS or while still
working very intensively with
groups of students through small
group instruction if they
are full release, MC LS.
And so it's really providing teachers
kind of another stair step in their
career, as he
mentioned, to make a larger amount of
money while still
directly impacting
students, many
teachers don't seek those types of
leadership opportunities if they don't
want to leave the classroom and they don't want to
stop working with students directly.
So it's really just opened up a
different level of
leadership for teachers
also when we have new
teachers um that have
inexperience and even
alternative licenser teachers that
haven't stepped foot in the classroom
before. Um this type
of mentorship that's very intensive
coaching on a day to day basis,
provides them a lot more support
than what they ever had in the
past. So we also
see higher teacher retention rates
across all of the teams where multi
uh multi classroom
leaders are serving
because teachers feel more supported.
As he mentioned, principals have
so much on their plates these days
and there's it's impossible for them
to intensely coach every single
person on their staff.
So this offers a distributive
leadership model that
allows principals to put
that trust in those multi
classroom leaders to have
more impact than just their
own classroom where they might
typically only impact,
you know, 2435
students depending on if they're secondary
or elementary, maybe
multiple periods of students, but
they wouldn't get to impact other
teachers and their students.
So it extends our
reach to a
greater number of students
by those excellent
teachers.
The vetting process
for the multi classroom leaders is
very stringent.
There's a very high data
requirement that they have to meet
for growth and proficiency
to show that they are growing
students in their own classrooms
before they're offered this type of
leadership position.
We also take into account
their um teacher
evaluation from the state from
their principal through the state system,
as well as their principal's feedback
from their current and previous
supervisors. And
then um they also have to write an
essay that shows us
why they believe they want to
work in an opportunity. Culture,
school, these schools
should be serving our most
underserved populations.
So we do have to ensure that the teachers
have a passion for that if they're going
to take on this type of leadership
role.
Um As Doctor Washburn mentioned,
we have um
prior to my coming to the district,
the district started with mostly
full release, MC LS.
Um What that means is that the,
the teacher was uh
pulled out of the classroom to
be a full release rather than
a partial. So they have the
full day to coach other
teachers on their team as
well as pulling small groups of
students for intensive
instruction. Um We did
have one partial release
MC L that was in special
education and we were the
first district in the country that's
doing opportunity culture to
pilot that special education.
MC L. Um We
found it to be very effective
because that MC L was able to
coach teachers across
inclusion resource
and low incidence classrooms.
Um So she really made a large
impact even as a partial release
MC L while she, while she still
had her own classroom of special
education students.
Um With our full
release MC LS, we've
had reach across 6th
and 7th grade, El A and
math in Pr Leiva.
And then we've also had reach
across uh 2nd and
3rd and 4th grade
and um Cottonwood
Elementary as well
as 1st and 3rd grade in
Desert Willow. And
um as Doctor Washburn mentioned, we've
seen amazing data through
A I station and NW
A maps already
showing the growth that the students
that are impacted by those
MC LS have had.
So we're just very excited to
see the state results and see if
that translates over from
all of those interim assessments
that we've, we've
seen. Um
one of the other important things to
say about this program is the
way that um it
really changes the culture
in a building.
We many of us say
as we walked through our buildings
this year, seeing the difference
that these opportunity culture, campuses
have have had.
There's a culture of coaching, there's
a culture of feedback,
there's not a closed door
culture where many teachers are used
to kind of shutting their door and doing their
own thing. It's a very
open environment where everyone
has a growth mindset
and it really um
translates to the students as
well, having the data
conversations amongst those
MC L teams where the
teachers better understand
how to pull and analyze their
data. They're having those
conversations with their students
as well. So in Pr
Leva middle school, when you
walk in and ask a student, how
many points have you grown in? Nw
A maps this year? They can tell
you because they're having those data
conversations with their teachers
and they understand that they are
growing, not
only focusing on proficiency
but recognizing um
doing certificates and all types
of programs to help them understand
that they are growing
and, and recognizing those
incremental growths
throughout the year, the
small group instruction there has
also been very impactful
um even just 15 to 20
minutes in each
period with that multi classroom
leader working on a very
strategic um planned
out, you know, standard based
on data with what those students are
struggling with. Um
And we've seen great growth in that small
group instruction as well,
even small group instruction happening
more frequently in the middle school
classroom. Whereas they might think
that that was traditionally something that's
only in the elementary classroom,
but it's empowered the teachers to
realize that they could have a greater
reach in their own classroom
um in every period by
doing small group
instruction.
>> So we take some
questions on that here in a minute. But I
the other thing I wanted to
talk about is our
academy model that
we've moved our high school to.
We've gone into
a complete
redesign. Uh
We have a
business and it
academy an
academy of arts,
audiovisual technology
and communication, a
health and human services
academy and a stem
and industrial science
academy. And there are
multiple pathways.
You can see how we've designed those
pathways. We did
this for two reasons. Number
one, we, when the board was
developing their strategic
plan, the community
wanted a educational
system designed at the high
school that focused
on all students
that focused on kids
that weren't going to go to college,
that were going to be moving into the
workforce. And they
wanted something that would address
all pathways.
So we've done a lot of
work on
reaching out uh
surveying the community.
What are the pathways where you need
the most jobs? Uh We
spent a lot of time building an
energy pathway
that started out as an oil
and gas pathway and has
evolved into
a full
pathway for
wind solar,
the entire energy
gamut so that kids
can be exposed to all of the
various ways that they can make a
living. And
they either they can go to
college and be engineers
and move into those pathways
or they can walk across the
stage and walk on to a job
site with job
certifications. Our job
certifications
went up uh
15%
this last year. They would
have gone up more, but we lost
our welding teacher.
Um Welding teachers
are, it's hard to hold a welding
teacher in a place where
you can make a ton of money as a welder
in the oil and gas industry.
But we will have that
program back up.
Um We have,
we are revitalizing our
building trades program
and we will have 20 kids
that are remodeling
a house that we purchased
for teachers to live in.
And then we, they will start
building houses, but
this is a way for them to get
started before we get
there. Um
The other thing I'm really proud
of with the high school
is we survey the seniors
every year
and they talk to us about
what's important to
them, what worked
for them, what didn't work
for them. And we look
at our program
and we, and we
design it based on
that. I've included some
of that feedback in there
for you to read. I'm not
going to read those things to
you. But
what,
what the kids have told
us repeatedly
is they need education
that's relevant,
that shows
them a
pathway to what
the way to where they can
make their way in the world
and where they can be engaged.
And so, uh we
are very excited about the
work that we're doing.
Uh And with that, I'm
gonna stop
and uh I will
take whatever
we will try to answer whatever
questions. Anybody on the committee's
got
>> we stand for questions, Mr
Chair.
Yes.
Oh, yes. We do have a few
superintendents in the audience if
I could have them stand
and I believe we
have Gene
Strickland.
>> Good morning. Thank you all for being here. Gene
Strickland, superintendent of
schools.
>> Duane Haines from Yunis.
Is that >> way? Hays superintendent
Yunus, 36 years,
16 years superintendent
I'm passing on through have
Bruce Hatch who will be taken
over Bruce >> Hatch. Future
superintendent of
Yunus.
>> Good morning, Pam
Quinones Levington
Schools.
>> I'm Lakew
superintendent and
Loving.
>> Is that
a,
it's a tight group.
>> Thank you guys
for being here and feel
free. You want to add anything real
quickly to what he said or
anything that you need to think you
need to tell us to highlight
right now while you
have us
here,
feel free.
Do you have anything you want?
You'll have to come to a MKE
though.
>> I'll, I'll lean right here next to my good
friend, Doctor Washburn. Oh, you're
good.
>> It's so good to see him in blue.
You have no idea how good it is to
see him in blue.
>> We support each other in so
many ways. But
uh chairman members
of the committee again, thank
you for being here. Thank you for being in Southeast
New Mexico.
And I think one thing
that rings true for all of us as
superintendents
is we see our
kids just as
important as every superintendent
sees their kids
and every kid
in New Mexico is all our
kids. Uh The
work that Carlsbad
highlighted I think is
crucial in terms of telling the
story about who we
are becoming
as an entity as
it relates to education.
Uh We've heard loud and clear.
Uh I, I've just had the privilege of being
here just yesterday afternoon. And
then again today and
Representative BCA your
questions
um to, to
uh Mr Parks uh
Ring. So
true.
Yeah,
we're, we're past the time
of a nation at risk
from many decades
ago, but we
are a nation at risk.
We continue to be a nation at risk
and we're a nation at risk
because of a skills gap
that we've long ignored
and we see it in our students
in their engagement
and they
desire to be
engaged in educational
opportunities
that are career
based.
And we strive
specifically in Hobbs, we
strive to create those opportunities
that are career relevant to
students
while attaining a high
school diploma, the diploma
becoming the by-product
of their experience
so that they come to school
engaged in what
they're interested in
that we create opportunities
with community partners, with
industry,
with agencies
that have those students
interests.
One thing remains true of
any choice,
any policy,
any procedure we
choose.
Every child will have a
career,
every child
will have a
career.
It's long past the time that we
expect them to figure that out after they
graduate high school.
So I'm grateful for the work that I
get to do within my
community. I'm grateful for
the work that I get to do with
colleagues that are engaged
in that same work.
And as
a nearly
lifelong member of this educational
system, grew up in Southeast New
Mexico, graduated
from a district just north of
Me Lovington.
They were blue as well.
Um
was educated in the State of New
Mexico at the higher level. Both
my degrees are New Mexico
degrees. I spent
two years in Texas.
But my
professional career of 26
years, 24 of those have
been in New Mexico
enriching the lives of young
people to make our communities
better. And I'm grateful
for each of you that you serve in
that role in the legislative
finance committee
and listen and help make
decisions to make our state
even better.
We're nowhere near where we want to be.
And I, and I can assure you
if that performance
level was 90
95%
we're still gonna strive for that 10
and 5%
because we know it matters, it matters to
every kid.
Um Senator Munoz,
you were in our community just a few weeks
ago and we talked about
some of the issues we were
having the funding formula
and I'm happy to
report that the unit
value has been adjusted.
Uh The initial unit value has been
adjusted and it
has, has had a positive
reflection on our
budgets going forward into
2425.
I do look forward to see how that
plays out,
but we, we do look forward
to continuing
to develop an
educational system
that's built with excellence in
mind and it is
funded with excellence in
mind and
not historically funded where we
funded it with efficiency in
mind. So I appreciate
the work that you do and I appreciate the support
that you have for all of our
kids because it matters to
all of them. When our kids
are successful, our state is
successful. So I
don't know if you asked for that, but
Gary knows when you give me a microphone,
it's a bad idea.
>> So you know that. Thank you. I'm, I'm
really, I mean, I'm,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.
Anybody can chime in. But I, I really
enjoyed that because I can
tell you, I mean,
every kid is a little bit different,
right? And every
kid wants to be at school late in the
morning and take math as
their first class and they may want
to take Welding as their first class
and then make up and go do other
stuff. But I
mean, uh
my wife was a principal
and a teacher and retired,
right. And I live with her and it's
like, you know, we,
we, we've never changed
education in how many
years and now it's really
time to change it.
Right. And
we have the money to make
change.
We just need to do it.
So, >> and,
and you will see in our,
in our, um,
we, we have an alternative
high school and if you look at the data,
it shows that it's in
significant need of
improvement. But what I
want to talk to you about is the difference
between statistics
and,
and action
reality.
Uh We started that
school
uh two
years ago.
Um and
their first graduating class
had 64 kids.
I can confidently say
of those 64 kids,
more than half of them would
not have graduated from high
school. We graduated
67 this
year.
Again, those are kids that
would have never graduated from
high school if we hadn't put that program
in place. Um
We have to find
ways
to make sure that every
kid can get
across that line
because if they don't get across
that
line,
it is a hard road
to hope. And so,
um you know, it's exciting
work I'm incredibly proud
of, of Carlsbad
Enrichment Center. Um
I'm incredibly
proud of our co
early college high school
and we have three different high
schools, three different
pathways. These
kids are,
we're trying to engage every
kid
and if we can get every kid
engaged, we can get
them across the line, but we
got to get them engaged.
>> I guess we'll go to
questions for members.
My wife was a principal
at alternative school and ran the grads
program. And so it's
very interesting to watch those kids
in, in walks of life. And
the conversation I've been having
is where
1100 students from being
in the meeting of the US to
graduate. Right.
64 puts a big
dent in that
right out of a carl
out of one single district in
Carlsbad.
64 is,
you know, what,
9% of what we
need to get to? 1108%
right? Everybody
gets 64.
We'd be in the median of the US
and it just changes the mindset. I
mean, the superintendent
Hobbs has a completely different
mindset that than you hear
in some other places. Right.
Yep. So
represent
baca
thank
you
it up
too.
It's not me, this
>> guy.
>> Ok.
Testing. All right.
Thanks.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And thank you
for your presentation. I will
be brief, but I do
have some very specific
questions and I want to highlight a
couple of things.
So Mr Chairman and
superintendent Washburn. So you
talked about your $55 million
performing arts center.
Uh May I ask, uh
superintendent, what was
the source of the funding for the
performing arts center?
Uh >> We passed a
bond and
uh and then,
and then we,
uh we
literally passed that bond
for
85 million.
Um,
and
we have paid all
those bonds off
so that money is sitting in an account
waiting for,
uh, that project to be
finished and it was oil and gas tax
revenues that, that
paid that off. I
to give you an
idea
15 years ago,
uh, about
35%
of, uh, any
bond that we had
was being serviced by
residential property
taxes and the rest was
being serviced by oil
and gas revenues.
Primarily. Now,
it's up to
uh 93%
is oil and gas tax
revenues and that
residential property
value has dropped. It's
just, it's
just where we
are and we know we're
unique. >> Thank you,
Mr Chairman and, and I, I do want
to not um
drive home
the point again is
that when we're talking about
opportunities, like I mentioned,
you know, for districts and
for that may not have the
bonding capacity or may not have the
property tax or may not have
the oil and gas revenues.
We have a lot of money, Mr Chairman
that sits in capital outlay that
every year this billions of
dollars that are there.
And Mr Chairman and Committee, I'd
really like us to
consider as that money
before reverts back to the general
fund that it be put into a
fund that may be accessed
by our school districts,
even if they participate at that
proportionate chair. Like when they build
schools,
it would be, I think a good
thing for our kids.
And again, I'm talking performance
art centers. I'm talking about
ROTC CENTERS,
all of those types of things because there's
a lot of money that we set out there.
Billions of dollars that are out
there. I would
really like to see those billions of
dollars go back
into our, our
schools uh
for that
um for that
purpose. So um
Mr Chairman, you talked
about TC I, so
Carlsbad is unique as far
as what the t many folks have actually
seen a decrease
in TC. I. Can you tell me, Mr
Chairman and uh superintendent
Washburn, what does Carlsbad
do differently or what do they require their
teachers that
impacts at TC I?
>> Uh Representative
Barker Mr Chair.
Um
we
historically, when,
when uh under
the old formula,
Carlsbad
maximized the
formula by requiring a
master's degree and, and
getting, requiring people to
get to it in six
years when we,
when the, when the formula
reverted, our union
came to us and said,
we recognize that
this is going to be an issue for
us. Uh And
so they shifted
to
the, the levels
and to putting people
on the pathway to where they
had to get to level three
within six years.
So, um
with COVID, we've
been looser with
that, but
histo but we
will, we're moving back
to where if you don't get
there, you're not gonna
be here. I mean,
we're, our intent
is to have
high quality teachers
and to
maximize
everything that we can
in, in driving
uh in, in
driving the funding
formula. >> Thank you. Thank
you, Mr Chairman and thank
you and, and
Superintendent II I for
this next one. As far as just give me
areas as far as
many of the group here sits
on the LES C the legislative
education study committee and
there is going to be a subcomittee
looking at the SCG funding
formula.
Superintendent Washburn and
chairman, can you just highlight some
areas that you believe need to be
considered when
members of this committee and
others look at how
schools are funded
and what may
need to be adjusted or what
has been left out of the
formula that needs to be
considered.
>> Always a scary thing to ask me
this question. Um
I, I would
dearly love to see the
vast majority
of the money
go above the
line to
where school districts can
use it, how they need
to use it. I think the
biggest problem that we've had
is we've had lots
of very well intended
programs, but all that
funding's below the line
and many districts
choose not to access that
funding either because
the communities don't want it
or they don't see a
way. And what
we really need is we
need some way
to
have the maximum
amount of flexibility
in the dollars that we
spend to
design program. I
we're doing opportunity,
culture, there are people all
over the state doing very innovative
things that what
constrains them
is always going to be the
finances.
Um So the
more money that we put in the
seg it goes
straight to operational
without having to jump through a whole
bunch of hoops. The more
innovation you're going to see you're
gonna constrain innovation
when you move that money below the
line.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. And, and thank
you. And this question is
actually for, for
uh superintendent Washburn and uh
Superintendent Strickland, if you want to
jump in as well,
um the certificate
program. So we talk about CTE
but we talk about when you, the,
the question or
some of the, the
um programs that you
have students
graduate with a certificate
that can immediately enter the
workforce. Now,
we know the cost of those
certificates, certified nursing
assistant and other programs.
What types of
uh certificate programs
does Carlsbad
have?
And hobs? And
also how
are, how are those
funded? And what kinds
of programs do you
have?
>> Oh,
lots of
programs.
>> Uh Mr Chairman
Super, actually, what I'm looking for
is really kind of certificate programs
because it, it may
look somewhat different than the
CTE because what I'm
looking for
is really >> is. So, so
you, we
have welding certification,
we have uh work
safety. Um,
we have,
um, I can't
remember what the program is but there's a
construction uh,
certification where a kid,
if they've got that certification,
they can walk on a job site because
they don't have to acquire it
so they can start there immediately.
Uh The nursing
certifications, the
Welding
certifications.
Uh we,
we've got multiple
certifications
in uh
Microsoft Office
and all of those various areas
there. Um
And all of those, those
certifications
uh it's free, I
po free and
appropriate public education. The
kids don't pay for those, the district
funds out.
J
>> Chairman Representative
Maka, thank you for
the question. And
I, I will tell you all of those things
that we do fund
uh are funded
within that
operational budget.
Um
I do appreciate the question on
funding formula.
Um Many members
of the committee may have heard the
phrase before that Hobbs is one of the
least funded school districts in the state of New
Mexico per pupil.
That still rings true.
Still rings true. Being a school
district, that's a growth district.
Still being a district that's a
K 12 plus district. We
still remain one of the lowest funded
districts per
pupil.
With that.
We've had to get creative
and those below the
line things are are things that
allow us to do additional
things. You heard
Mr Parks talk yesterday about
the cost of career technical
education
and my
lens on that is
again, every child will have a
career so every
child should be engaged in career
technical education
certification programs
that we provide in
Hobbs
manufacturing,
which in within manufacturing
includes
welding and
machining. Huge
industry, huge
need
energy, oil and
gas. You know, we
provide certifications there,
Culinary and hospitality,
serve safe. One of our
largest ones,
information technology.
I I
would
take anyone's bet if
you haven't touched technology at
some point today already
this early this morning,
um providing technologies
through comp tia
providing certifications
in the transportation industry
snap on and that
includes both diesel
and gasoline
engines.
Yeah,
I know I'm leaving some out and I
will get in trouble when I get home
because I left them out
um
going through other things. But
I think the point to that
is
if students are engaged in a high
school schedule,
they're earning high school
credits back
to that point of a diploma
being a by-product
of that experience,
but they're earning
industry credentials
and as we redesigned what
we wanted to provide to our
community uh some
seven years ago, now we
began that conversation.
Industry said
we need individuals
that are certified and can go to
work. And so those
credentials, those
certifications
truly allow
employees
to walk in and be employable
by employers and
employers within our community
who support our school district
through their taxes,
through their property taxes,
have a lower
time, a smaller
time of a return on
their investment. They can
be profitable with that employee
sooner.
It's, it's been said that
um for every dollar
invested in career and technical
education, that
region, that community where it's
invested is a $7
return.
That's proof positive that career
technical education
works
to have a
long
view of it. Uh
We, we end up can
continue to invest our
money as a state in
social services
and ignoring
the problems that continue to
happen and solve those
problems or address
those problems or
we can invest in those
opportunities that create
a career
for our
communities so that they continue
to remain viable.
Um We, we are
participating in
Innovation
Zone uh nextgen, which
is rolled in Perkins,
all of those things
that allow us to continue to
provide those certification
programs that we do provide
um
gonna take a moment and,
and share that one of the
largest credentialing agencies
is called NC three.
It's, it's
prevalent across industries
over our entire nation.
It's not a high school based
program only
Hobbs high school we believe
will be the number one credentialing
agency in the United
States
in just a few short
weeks
greater than any
trade school, greater
than any other high school, greater
than any vocational program. We
will have awarded
students who will have earned more
credentials than any other agency in the
nation. And
those are paid for with local
dollars and with those grant
opportunities as we
continue to, to fund
that, uh just a quick
little bogey, we,
we've
calculated
that our career,
technical education,
we're short for every student
that participates in that
by about $1100
we have to find ways to make that
up. I can't
run a negative base budget.
And so the SCG that's
provided the 1.25
multiplier
doesn't cover
that.
>> And, and thank you, Mr Chairman and
thank you, I guess that was really my
point is that these programs are
actually they need additional
funding and infrastructure to get
the certifications and the stuff.
So superintendent and
uh uh panel and also
the superintendents out here as well. I want
to thank you because I like what the
comment that was made. Those are all of our
kids. We may represent our
districts. You may represent your school
district, but all the
kids are our
kids and we need to take measures
to help the kid from the
northeast part, northeast part of the
state all the way down to the southwest.
So thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you. We're, we're gonna try to go
through this pretty quick because we're gonna be running
late if not. So we're
gonna have a lightning round for one
minute. Representative
Sarinana.
>> Oh my gosh. Ok.
Thank. Thank you for your present. Thank you, Mr
Chairman two minutes. One
minute. Thank you for your
presentation. Um
I, I just, we, last
year in Les C we toured
um Carlsbad high school. I did my student
teaching there, so it was a great place.
Um And Anna, we
saw the, what they were doing
and I'm, I'm a math teacher.
So I asked, they were building part
of a house of the, of the layer
of a house. And I asked them,
tell me the math and they knew the
math and they said this is where we're
learning the math. So it's a great
program and I appreciate what you're
doing. I wish we could do it everywhere.
Um Very impressed with um
Carlsbad High School.
Um We
also did the elementary
and that was very impressive too with
math because they were using robotics and
the kids were so engaged
in, in using the numbers. They
understood what they were doing. They
could document it. It was very
impressive. Also on,
on the elementary. The
cost was that a big
cost to the schools? Because
I would like to see it everywhere if
possible. But is that a large
cost, >> are you
talking about the STEM program?
The
robotics?
>> OK.
>> it might be separate, but that's OK.
We won't answer that one. I want to do one since
I only have a minute. I
want to talk to
Lovington.
A group of your kids came up from
America serves and they
came up to my office and they were
talking about all the great things they were doing
at their school and they
were so well spoken and so
impressive, just polite
young people.
But one thing for all of you, I want to
ask when
we talk about gas and oil
and the jobs that it's
producing, welding, all these
things. Do you do
any training
or do you talk about the
toxicity that they will be
exposed to when they go to those
areas?
>> Chairman Representative,
do you wanna rock paper
scissor for him? Go for
them. I,
I appreciate the question.
And
I think one thing to remember
is
the companies that own
and operate and produce oil and
gas.
In New Mexico.
They are the cleanest and
safest in the
industry.
They live, they
work in our
communities
and they want their community
safe. I know
there was in a session yesterday that
talks about setbacks.
And I have an elementary school that is
engaged in that
innocently enough that elementary
school sits on state
land.
Um So as, as we, as
we have that
discussion, it's
a discussion of
all
in relevance to
individual. And
so
absolutely, as
those students are engaged in our
energy based programs,
um
they walk in their lab
where they learn that and they begin
that safety culture,
they're in a clean space, a
safe space. They put a hardhead
on, they put on H two S monitor,
they put on safety
glasses
every day
as high school students,
they begin
that.
So absolutely,
they discuss the
risks associated with
that. I I
would, I would
challenge other
industries
to engage in
those risk
based analysis as
it relates to their work
environment and
how that safety culture
is priority.
Priority. One part
one of
that career.
Thank you for the
question.
>> Thank you, Representative
Garrett. She used all your time. So you got
30 seconds.
>> OK. I'll really go
fast. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you for your presentation. I
too went to Carlsbad and
it was very impressive. Here's
my question and it's, I'm sorry,
I don't know your name, but it's,
you may address it too. The
opportunity scholarship is very
effective. I've been an
instructional coach. I feel
like this is multiplying
that coach role.
How should we pay for it?
You have found all of
these stipends
that of your operational money. Do we
need a new credential
uh category micro
credentials so that
it's in the SCG
and it's not each district,
you know, digging around to
figure out how they can get the
money for it. Do you have
any thoughts on
that?
>> Mindy will defer to me
on that? Uh
The uh she,
she don't want to step on that
landline. Uh
I,
I don't know that you need the
credentialing so much
as um
as you just need to have
enough flexibility in the
scg with, with how we
move things forward. I,
I, I'm gonna say it
over and over again. I think
flexibility is the key.
Um
We
absolutely
with the vetting process
that our MC Ls go
through, they
are
top of the top of our
level threes. Now
we wanted to create a level
four and, and
go through that process. I think
that would take time to do
that. But
I, you know, it would depend
on uh
does the state want to
embark on some version of
opportunity culture across
the state? Uh We're
gonna spend a million nine next
year in operational dollars
on opportunity, culture.
Um But
if I was
having trouble filling teacher
positions, I
would go partial release
and I would spend
$576,000
doing exactly the same
thing I'm doing,
touching the same number of
kids, but those
teachers would be teaching part
time and releasing
to coached part time.
So there are ways to do
those things
um and to make
it work. So it, our
model is,
is spendy to
use a term I learned when I was on
the west coast. Um
you know, and it's
uh and we are doing it the
most expensive way,
but
public impact is designed,
they programmed where
you can fund it
with the limited operational
dollars you have
and accomplish the
same things.
Does that answer your question? >> Thank
you. Yes, it does. That's it a
little over
30.
Thank you, >> Representative
Herrera.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you.
I too is a member of the
LES C who came down here
and looked at Carlsbad last
year. And I said, I don't know why we're coming
to Carlsbad and then I came to
Carlsbad and said,
wow. Uh
so thank you for,
for taking the lead on this.
And what is the opportunity?
Um What is your
opportunity uh
program cost per
student for the whole thing
over a whatever
period of years it takes.
>> Uh this year
we spent $983
per K. Um
That's, that's
consulting
teacher salaries,
stipends
and mening.
Um So, I mean, we've
built all those costs in
next year, we'll spend
$759
per kid. Um
So
um
because
because your teacher salaries
are already built into
the uh built
into your operational
budget, uh those
costs are kind of disguised
in there. Uh
But I'm applying
them directly to
opportunity culture
because that's what we're doing
so that, you know, we're
trying to look at those costs
very squarely.
>> So I guess what I'm trying to get a
handle on Mr Chairman.
So what is the implementation
cost? And then what is the sustaining
cost of this program
>> implementation
costs? I would say we probably
somewhere in the neighborhood
uh first year
of
$400,000
and
probably
in 100 and
$54,000
for the stipends
so that
it depends on how much you roll
out.
So
I would say somewhere
between
405
$100,000 would get
you started. Uh If
you went full
release, uh
probably somewhere in the
neighborhood of 250 to
$300,000
if you're going partial
release, but
that's primarily
public impact
working with you on how
to vet the teachers and
roll that out. >> I'll go
offline on this Mr
chair because I, I would like to take
a deeper dive with Mindy on
that. And I just
want to talk, I just
want to say something very short.
When we went to the elementary school,
we went early. So we saw the
kids coming into
elementary school and I just
want to say the teachers
are out there greeting them and every
child walked into that
school with a smile.
I remember that
vividly
every single child and this
was not a wealthy group
of kids
but to have every child
walk into a school smiling was
pretty amazing. I was pretty
impressed. Thank you.
>> Cottonwood is the happiest place
on earth. I am
convinced.
>> I think she's done. Are you done?
Representative?
Thank you guys for your presentation
time. I don't know
what we
got
Brown. You got 10
seconds. >> Actually, I
need 15 seconds, Mr Chair,
but I'll take the 10
1 question.
We're looking at
Appropriations committee, we're looking
at funding for CTE
statewide. Do
you all believe you're well
enough funded? If you're not,
how much more do you need? So, we
know that number going into the
session.
So that's the question for
anybody.
>> We are not well enough funded.
Uh, the, the problem
is with, with
CTE is
the equipment,
is,
equipment costs are
significant.
Also the
programs evolve over
time. So you have
to be able to replace the
equipment. Uh
You have to have, you have to
have that ability. We
also have to figure
out how we're going to
attract people into
those roles.
Uh as instructors.
Um My
auto, I share
my auto instructor
with Southeast New Mexico
College. Uh He
actually is getting ready to
be his
uh do
his level three,
which he didn't think he was gonna be
able to do, but we've got
to be able to figure out ways
gene. I don't know if you've
got a, a number.
I I, you
always have a
number
>> and typically it's the score of the
football or basketball
game.
Ouch.
I didn't say who won.
Um But chairman
Representative Brown, thank you for the question.
And in terms of an absolute
number, II, I would
caution us against that
because then that puts again
a, an average across
what that costs.
I I can assure you the
students that are engaged in
our career pathway educator
pathway
costs less educate them
than it does our students in the
transportation pathway
and attain those certifications.
Um So
my approach, uh
my, my, my conversation
looking forward to
the LES E study and what that
SCG has the
potential to become.
Um
I think it can become
twofold. I
think you can say, look
as the state we're going to
fund start up costs,
equipment costs, operational
costs
based upon vetted
programs that you choose
to benefit your
community with. And,
and I don't have a number for
that,
but I also think there's, there's a
second prong to that and it
is we're
going to fund in
the subsequent
year, certification
and industry
qualifications
similar to what we do
with teachers leveling
up to level 12 and
three. If we
for or or award
students earn 4000
credentials, there
could be or should be a number
attached to that to create an
incentive for school districts
to provide that to their
communities, to engage
with conversation with their industries
and their employers to say,
what is it that you need
allow us to,
to create the educational
structure and system to
produce employees for you
to enter the workforce. So
II, I think there's, there's two pieces
to that answer or two
pieces to the, to the solution.
Mr >> Chair, um superintendent.
Thank you very much. That was a helpful
answer. I think the point
is we need to hear from you
what you need. So we're not taking
a guess at it. Thank
you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, I think we're gonna come back
on, on CT at some point
in time and really
have that conversation. I mean, you're,
you're exactly right in,
in mckinley County school districts, they're
trying to do a heavy equipment school.
Right. A
bulldozer is
$450,000
and that's not even with a
teacher. And then,
so it's just gonna be different
everywhere. We'll just have to look at that
and, and see how we had that
in that path. So we're
about 30 minutes behind
time right now. So we're
gonna wrap up. Appreciate
you guys
coming. Thank you for telling your
story. Uh I'm
glad pe d
finally learned
that they need to fully fund
the money that the legislature
appropriates to them, that they cannot
withhold that money. Um
That's not their prerogative.
It's the legislature's prerogative
to, to fund what we need
to fund and, and they need to
send the money out so you guys can
plan and budget correctly
uh, over time. So I think
they got that message pretty loud
and clear. Um
So we're gonna
get you guys somewhere else along the
road this summer
and, and really dig into
CTE and what, what
really what you're doing
>> and thank you very much. We appreciate
the time and any of you
that need something to do on Fourth of
July, the most amazing Fourth of
July fireworks show
in the world is out here on this
lake. Come on >> deck. I thought
it was in Saint John's Arizona.
No, >> no, it's
not. >> You
guys got a clean thing
then. Thank you
guys.
We on to next
Sonny. You're gonna bring the next
panel
or?
Thank
you.
You don't want to hear the conversation about
your presentation up here.
Do you have this in
audiobooks
maybe next
time?
Well, anytime there's an
index
II, I mean,
we're just like a student in the classroom,
we can only take so much information
right before
that. We got ring the bell and surrender
and go to the
um coffee break. So
hit your bullet points here here.
What you really need us to
know. I mean,
this is really something that's key
to moving the bottom line.
So make sure we focus on
that.
>> Good morning. I'm Doctor Sarah Andis
and this is my colleague, Dr John
Valdez. We're
program evaluators at LFC
and we're here to present the evaluation
entitled school attendance and performance.
Looks like this and should have just been passed
out. We're
joined today by PE D.
Uh This is uh Deputy
Secretary Candice
Castillo before we get
started. I want to thank the many people
at PE D and
uh the districts including Mrs
Kew over there from Lovington,
uh who worked with us on this
report. I would also like
to thank Margaret Klug, uh
who is an MP P fellow
assisting us on this project
and who is now one of our newest evaluators
at LFC.
And if you'll please turn with me to the summary
on page one, we'll get
started with the
report
in order to get the benefits of school,
students need to attend
class
from school year 2019
to school year 2023
the number of students missing more than
10% of school days,
um more than
doubled and it grew the most
in New Mexico compared to any
other reporting state in the nation.
Even as many states experienced
increases in students
missing school. In
2019, the
state enacted the Attendance for
Success Act which
changed our state's focus
from only students.
Uh with many unexcused
absences to those
frequently absent. For any
reason. The
law also changed the response
to these absences moving
away from a punitive
approach and more towards a supportive
lens.
LFC staff surveyed
school attendance teams
finding that illness, parental
decisions and a lack of
interest in school were the main
reasons for students being chronically
absent yet,
no matter why students are chronically
absent, it can hamper
their educational success.
For example, a
student who misses 10%
more school days
are between 12%
and 18% less likely to
graduate.
While New Mexico's attendance
for Success Act meets
many national best practices
including having tier levels of
intervention. The public
education department or PD
hasn't provided consistent
guidance on how to implement
these interventions. And this
leads to inconsistent district
practices.
The state can help local
initiatives improve
attendance. This includes
allowing for calendars to
be adjusted at the school level in
some instances uh
as well as to require
extra school for some chronically
absent students.
Now, um I'll turn
the presentation over to Doctor Valdez
who will discuss our
background.
>> Thank you, Doctor Dss. Uh
I'll be covering our
background and the impacts of
chronic absenteeism. Starting
on page one.
National research finds chronic
absence in early grades
affects reading and math
proficiency in the near
term and graduation in the
longer term. Chronic
absenteeism increased the
most in New Mexico among
states in the US. After
the pandemic. On
chart one page one,
you can see that from school year
2019 to
2023 the
state saw 119%
increase in chronic absenteeism
compared to a national average
of 71%.
The state's chronic absenteeism
rate increased from
17.9
to 39.2%
during that time. and
was the second highest of
31 states reporting
for the year
2023.
The latest available data,
the 80 day snapshot
which shows data from about halfway
through the most recent school
year uh is represented
by the dashed line on chart
one and page one and
shows a chronic absenteeism rate
of 30.4%.
Again, that's about halfway through this
most recent school year.
This is a significant decline
from the 39.2%
at the end of the 2023
school year, uh which
was the previous year for which we
have a complete
data
on page five. You'll turn
with him into page
five.
We discussed the attendance for
Success Act passed in
2019 which replaced the
measure of absenteeism
which had been habitual
truancy with
chronic absenteeism.
Figure one on page five
shows the timeline of
implementation.
The act counts both
excused and unexcused
absences and considers a
student chronically absent when they
have missed 10% of
school or about 17
days in an average
district in New Mexico.
Um Note that that's a percentage
rather than the number of
days. Besides
creating a comic a common
definition for chronic
absenteeism. The
attendance for Success Act
uh added reporting requirements
for schools and districts with
a chronic absenteeism rate above
5%. And in practice,
that means that most schools and
districts in the state will have
to complete uh an
attendance appro improvement
plan
note in chart four on page
five, we compare habitual
truancy, the
measure under of
absenteeism under the previous
law with chronic
absenteeism. The measure under
the attendance for Success Act.
Well, the measures were relatively
close in 2019, they
have since diverged as
total absences. Inc
including excused
and unexcused absences
have increased
in school year. 2023
124,600
students were chronically
absent in the state
with at risk students
the most likely to be
chronically absent.
On chart five. On page
six, you can see
third graders had the best
attendance in 2019
and 2023.
Kindergartner and high school
students with ninth graders uh
leading the way were the
most absent. And this is
consistent with a national
trend where we do see
kindergartner and high school
students as the most absent
and sort of the middle grades of
elementary school as the
best attenders.
Figure two on page seven,
shows the regional
variation in chronic
absenteeism by school district
around the
state.
On page seven, we discussed
the 2019 attendance
for Success Act, which did
not include an
appropriation. However,
pe D and districts spent at
least $24.8
million in Fy 23
and fy 24 on
student attendance initiatives.
This included $1.4
million in Fy 24
for an attendance improvement
plan application
portal.
In sy 24
PE D was appropriated
$5 million to address
student attendance and
primarily use these funds for
grants and contracted
support.
Since 2020 pe
D spent at least $9.3
million on attendance recovery
through a contractor. However,
while expenses increased,
the number of students served
by that contractor has
decreased. And outcome
monitoring remains
minimal.
Districts spent $19.8
million on staff uh
attendance staff in fy
23 with at least
64 districts funding
attendance personnel with their
operational funds.
This amount uh amounts
only to 0.5%
of the $4.1
billion annual uh
seg or public
school funding formula.
This figure paid for an estimated
354 staff
dedicated to attendance around
the state.
Our next chapter starting on
page 10 discusses our
finding that
absenteeism decreases
academic proficiency
and graduation rates
across the state of New
Mexico. On
page 10 chart
eight shows that in
2023 chronically
absent students were much less
likely to show proficiency
on New Mexico's assessments
including the N ESA
and I station than
non chronically absent
students.
The same held true when we examined
2019 proficiency data
on the Ice station and Tamala
assessments.
In addition, and
consistent with the results of
national research
page 11 of our analysis
shows that chronic
absenteeism of a
few students leads
to lower proficiency
for the entire classroom.
Uh So if we have a few students
that are chronically absent, even the
students that attend uh will
show lower proficiency,
both individual and classroom
proficiency rates are negatively
affected by poor attendance,
but both are also exacerbated
by uh family income
dynamics. So on chart
nine, on page 11,
you can see that the there is an
interaction effect of
chronic absenteeism
and economic disadvantage.
Uh And we paid attention to that
throughout our analysis
on page 11. Toward the
bottom, we consider
the impact of excused
versus unexcused
absences. We found
that while unexcused absences
had a slightly larger negative
impact on proficiency,
both types of ap absences
were associated with lower test
scores. On as on
assessments.
On page 12,
we discuss our finding that
attendance is also a strong
predictor of future
graduation
probability.
Our analysis reproduced
national studies using New Mexico
data uh
to show that
third grade attendance from
New Mexico third graders in
2012 was a
significant predictor of
their eventual graduation
or not. In
2021.
Table three on page
12 shows attendance
of 2012 3rd graders
and their associated graduation
rates. Our
model predicted 83%
of students with perfect
attendance would
graduate compared with only
53% of
students with 80%
attendance or a chronically
absent student.
This analysis showed consistent
results with the same group's eighth
grade attendance records. So
we looked at those third graders
from 2012, we looked
at their attendance in eighth grade and their
eighth grade attendance was also a
predictor of their eventual
graduation or
not.
Figure three shows this relationship
graphically across
the X or horizontal
axis is the percent of days
attended across the
Y or vertical axis
is the chance of
graduation. And you can see
the green line there shows
the increasing chance of completing
high school uh with
higher attendance. And it's a, it's
a pretty sharp uh
relationship where if
you attend more school, you're more
likely to graduate. And we see
this uh across
uh across the
data
continuing on page
13. Our
analysis considered the impact
of absenteeism on
total instructional
time to increase
instructional time. The state needs to
consider the number of
school days in the year,
the number of hours of
school per day
and the and the
attendance of the students in the
school in
2023 the average New
Mexico district had
167
days on the school
calendar. But because of
absences, students on
average only attended 100
52 school days.
Analysis shows with a high
degree of certainty that
the more time a student is in the
classroom either because
they have an extended school
calendar or because
they are absent less often,
the higher their scores tend to be
on state assessments.
Any effort to increase
instructional time needs to consider
attendance. In addition
to both days per year and
hours per day,
page 14 includes
our analysis of teacher
absences. Chart
11 shows teacher absences
are positively correlated
with student absences. That
is uh the more,
the more absences a teacher
has, the more absences their
students also have
in our sample, more teacher
absences uh led
to more student absences
uh which is assistant with
National research, which shows
that teacher absences are
also correlated with test
scores and college
attendance. Uh New
Mexico does not aggregate data
on teacher attendance. So we were
unable to corroborate the national
research but in the schools
where we were able to get uh
attendance data, we were able
to see the teacher absences
were associated with student
absences.
Turning to the bottom of page
14. Uh LFC
staff surveyed school
attendance personnel
who reported illness,
parental decisions
and a lack of student
uh engagement
as the primary reasons
for student absences.
In addition, the survey
suggested interventions are
working to reduce
absenteeism and that
these interventions should focus on
parents, student
engagement and
improved
transportation.
Figure four on page
15 shows a
word cloud of responses
to queries on actions to
improve attendance. Uh The
size of the words indicates the
frequency of that word's usage
in survey responses and
against those are survey responses
of attendance. Uh
staff, so people who
are dealing with
attendance every day,
turning to page 16
pe D in schools need to
engage parents and ensure
that families understand the
importance of attending school
for their students.
PE D is planning to launch
an attendance campaign this fall to
highlight the importance of going
to school for Children
to meet their career
goals. Uh
And with that, I'll turn it over to
Doctor Dz's to discuss
attendance taking practices
and the implementation of strategies
to reduce
absenteeism.
>> Thanks, Doctor Valdez.
If you'll turn with me to page
18, we'll discuss how
inconsistent attendance taking
practices can undercount
student absence.
It's important for schools and
districts to take attendance
accurately for.
Uh and if the state, if these
schools and districts don't take attendance
accurately, we don't have
an accurate understanding of the size
of our attendance problem.
Some districts have a vast majority
of schools and teachers
taking accurate attendance daily.
While others may
struggle. Please
turn your attention to figure six at
the bottom of the page.
And you'll see that this very bus
flow chart is meant to illustrate
the multitude of places where
attendance taking can face
challenges. Teachers
need to take attendance. School
administrators need to
ensure teachers take accurate
attendance and districts
should be reviewing their data
before it's sent to PE D.
However, when any one of these processes
breaks down attendance
data may be less
accurate. For
instance, if teachers
don't take attendance,
most of our student information
systems default to
showing that the student is attending
which can potentially undercount
the number of absences
PE D has yet to publish
former rule regarding attendance
taking. However, it
has issued guidance in March of
2024 while
guidance is useful in
helping ensure that districts are taking
attendance the same way this
information was provided more than
four years after the attendance
for Success Act
passed
through information collected at the
district level and through survey
data. LFC staff
learned that some teachers do
not take attendance daily
if you look at figure seven.
this highlights some local
examples of attendance
taking with up to 40%
of teachers not taking
attendance in some class
cases and
turning to page 19. If
you'll look at chart 14,
this shows that roughly one
third of our survey respondents
said that teachers are not taking
attendance at least 95%
of the
time
to help teachers take attendance.
Student information systems
can automatically notify
teachers if attendance
is not recorded.
This was a practice that we saw at one
Lovington elementary school
and that it can be helpful for teachers
who occasionally forget to take
attendance maybe due to something
happening in a classroom.
And also sometimes in administrative
staff are not
able to send
emails to teach teacher
individually turning
to page
21.
Our state data systems are
both inefficient and
expensive but collective
purchasing of student information
systems as well as PE
D assistance could
improve our efficiency.
So this is similar to what you heard in the
online student education evaluation
that was presented in April.
Um But currently part of our
problem with attendance data
is that there are lots of different student
information systems out there
and they need to integrate with Pe
D's database. But
beyond that, districts
frequently buy their own student
information system.
And uh we in the
districts are their RF
PS individually rather
than collectively purchasing the
software. If PE
D helped provide training
on student information systems
as well as helped with collective
purchasing fewer district
resources would be
needed.
Turning to page
23
we'll go through our last
finding.
Uh that strategies to reduce
absences are implemented
inconsistently. The
Attendance for Success Act
aligns with many national best
practices including
intervention tiers based
on level of student absences
and specifying when
uh districts and schools
need to meet with parents to build
individualized student plans.
Table seven on page
24
shows how PE D
has yet to provide consistent
guidance and rules
to direct districts. Uh
And the result has been
inconsistent quality
intervention strategy
interventions across the our
districts best
practice research is available
but PE D isn't consistently
providing this information to
districts. Uh And
the last column on our table provides
some examples of guidance
that Pe D could potentially
provide. Moving
to page 25
adjusting school calendars
requiring extra school and
withholding credit for poor attendance
can help reduce chronic
absenteeism and increase
our students. Instructional
time. Chart.
15 shows the chronic absenteeism
rate for Native American students
is higher than for other
groups uh in
districts with higher proportions
of Native American students.
Uh We see that students from
New Mexico's tribes and Pueblos,
Miss school for cultural
holidays as well as preparation for
these events. Many
schools serve only one or two
tribes or Pueblos even as their
district may serve more.
Therefore, allowing calendars
to be adjusted at the school
level may promote culture
inclusivity and reduce
our absenteeism rates
on page
26.
Extra school can deter
chronic absenteeism and
recover lost instruction or
provide designated study time for
students.
Lovington, which has a relatively
low chronic absenteeism
rate uses night
school
students referred, must attend
school in the evenings each
week. They do not
receive instruction but
are required to make up miss
work. Another way
to increase instruction
time is through retention
or no credit to certain
excessively absent
students. This
can ensure that students are not
passed to the next level
uh without needed skills.
Pe D should clarify to
districts that they can
retain students in specific
circumstancess.
If you'll turn with me to page
27
pe D is not consistently
providing attendance information
and this likely leads to
inconsistent quality
strategies. PE D is
the oversight and technical assistance
entity to districts and so
therefore, it can provide many different
supports to individual
districts. However,
turnover of key attendance
staff positions has
led to a lack of consistent
guidance. Many staff
including the division director,
Deputy director, Deputy
secretary and attendance coordinator
within the Safe and Healthy Schools
Bureau all changed
in the last year.
PD currently doesn't have
internal process documents
around attendance nor does
it have documents on our state goals
for attendance but is working
to create these documents.
Moving to page
28
districts have little pe D
provided information regarding
how interventions shown to improve
attendance should be implemented.
And this can result in districts doing the
same intervention different
ways. Two
examples of this are
incentives and
notifying parents of student
absences while
all the districts that we
visited.
Uh
Sorry. Well, all the districts that we
visited used incentives,
some provided large items
while others provided small
low-cost items.
Similarly, some
districts may call email or
mail letters to parents about
student absences when
real-time texts or
emails have been shown to have
the most positive impact on
students.
Having pe D provide
guidance on as to
how to implement the strategies
uh that are out there that have shown
to work could be useful and
create consistency across
districts. Now, if you'll please
turn with me to page two,
we'll talk about some of our key
recommendations
the legislature should consider
at mening the attendance For Success
Act to allow districts to
require extra instructional
time for excessively absent
students. Pe
D should publish rules
regarding how districts take
attendance and
produce and publicly post a
list of best practice interventions
to improve absenteeism.
Pe D and districts should
provide parents with information
on the importance of attendance
on their child's academic
performance and
they should implement and evaluate
teacher incentive programs
to determine if these incentives
help increase teacher
attendance. Finally,
districts should allow schools
within a district to set separate
calendars to meet cultural
needs. Thank you for your
attention. I'll turn the rest of the
presentation over to
doctor uh Deputy Secretary
Castillo to provide a
response.
>> Thank you.
Good morning,
Mr Chairman. Members
of the committee,
we have definitely
been
reviewing
all the findings of this
study and in the process
of the study, we had
been working not
only internally but also
showing
Doctor Jesus and
Dr Valdez all the steps
that the agency has been
taking to
address chronic
absenteeism. Many of
these findings are definitely
not surprising. I think that
as an agency, we had
already identified. And
again, we have already taken
steps to address
many of this
in the last
11 months that I have been
in this role. We have
hosted two
statewide
attendance conferences
where we have been working
with all the districts
across the state on
providing those guidance,
including having
one of what I consider
the authority on
attendance best practices
and research, which
is the organization, attendance
works. We had their
executive director
attend our
fall
conference and provide
those additional guidance.
And in addition to that,
many of our
districts, attendance
personnel do
participate in
different webinars that they
have been providing so that we
can enrich the support
that we are
giving to school
districts just to ensure
that we are
helping them tackle
this issue
in their respective communities.
In addition to that,
we, as
Dr Jesus mentioned,
we are working on
launching a attendance
campaign which we
had had a self launch
the last couple of months. But
gearing up to the start
of the upcoming school
year, this attendance
campaign not only
have best practices
around helping
parents understand because
we and that's not
just in New Mexico but
across the
country. There was a recent
story that highlights that
many parents because
they think that when they
see the word chronic means
that every
week their student will
be absent
from school, just helping
them understand and create that
awareness on how
they can ensure that
students are
making attendance to
class a priority.
And also as
as educational
entities, understanding what are
some of the main barriers that they
are facing and how
can we work on
creating better solutions.
So again that our students are
where they need to be, which is in the
classroom. So this campaign
has information for
parents, teachers,
school districts and
even student
engagement just so
that all the stakeholders
that are mainly
impacted by our
chronic absenteeism
can have a better understanding
and can be part of
again, creating solutions that
can help students
be consistently in class
so that their academic
performance is
not hindered. And
so all the
findings that
the study have shown
we have provided
specific responses
that I believe you also
have as part of your package.
So I'll stand, you
know, available for any
particular questions that
you may have specifically.
I'll be happy to
do my best to address
them.
>> OK. Thank you. Thank
you very much for your
presentations
for a minute. So
um let me
go on to
questions uh from
the committee. We have
representative and this is a
current list I found here.
It's representative
Sarinana. You are first and
then we have representative
Gail Armstrong
and
Representative
Oh Senator.
She didn't see your hand.
Thank you. All righty.
So representative, thank
you >> madam chair.
Thank you for your presentation.
Um We have a lot of teachers
here so we, we are fill this
and we, we've seen what happens and we
understand it. I was a math
teacher, um, eighth grade on
up. Um, when
I moved from middle school to high
school, I taught a lot of
freshmen and
that was our biggest dropout rate just
like your statistics. Say.
So these kids,
you know, they're excited to come to ninth
grade, but they just, a lot of
them have just been passed up and
passed up and passed up and not really
proficient. So when they get to
ninth grade, they're suddenly
they have credits, they have
to pass and they can't
and they don't or they don't come to tutoring,
they don't get help and then they drop
out. And
um it's,
it's tragic because a
little work or
help along the way
would, would have been better.
Um I, my last year of teaching.
I went back to middle school to
see why
we're, we continue to pass
these kids and they said that's just what we
do. Well, we can't do that
anymore because we lose too many kids,
too many kids who could do really
well. So I think part
of we have really have to look at
our system and say if
they're not ready, let's not
pass them. We can't pass them,
we can't continue to do this because
it's not good for them. It's not good
for anybody when
they come to a class where I
had three schools
that fed in someone's
own with my high school,
one high end, one middle
and one lower.
And you could
tell who was gonna continue on
and who wasn't and that's not
fair to anybody, especially the
kids. Um,
as far as I, I,
once I retired, I
have my license. So I continued
to, I, I've been substituting,
I have 11 schools in my class
in my district. So I've been
substituting at these schools
and the teacher absentee
rate is, is
crazy. So
I could see why you would get and,
um, the attendance isn't
quite right. I went my last
school. I had nothing. I had no
attendance. So
I took, I, I finally got some,
but it, um, that
should be a priority how
we, how we bring these, um,
substitutes in and
how we really educate
them on. It's not gonna
be easy like they say, it's
difficult to come into classroom,
that's not your classroom.
And, um, I saw a
couple just leave and I was
like, you can't do that. There's
kids in the classroom but it's
difficult. So those are a
couple of things. But I think
when the way we do it now
we, we can't continue to do
it if we want to see success with our
kids. 30%
proficient rate here, even here in
Carlsbad in math.
That's, that's saying you're not really
learning. Um,
so why do we continue to do
that? We have to teach
them even if it means
middle school becomes a, a
pool where we just separate
the kids at their proficiency and
let them learn because that's
needed or make algebra
one, a two year, two year
class. So they learn
it, not just pass them up.
Um,
let's see. Uh,
I have a school so superintendents
here, I have a school in
my district that doesn't
have an attendance person. They, the
funding was taken away. I'd
really like you to look at it. Kennedy middle
school because they need attendance.
They need help on that. That
is something that's really important that they
begged me for it. So, putting
it on you. Ok.
Um, I think,
I think there's a lot of people I just
wanted to get across that ninth
grade is a troubling year
middle school. We've got to figure
out what to do.
Um, the other
thing, um,
kids, you know, when
we have 30 kids in a
classroom and we have six or
seven absent, chronically absent
as teachers, we have to teach everyone.
So it does slow
them down and it was good to see you,
you saying that everybody's
affected. So
we, we almost need to separate
them and say these kids
are here every day, they need to keep
going. We need to take away what's
holding them back even
though it's gonna be hard.
But, and then work on the ones who are
absent in a separate way
because it's not fair to these
kids. It I think that's the big
difference between middle school and,
and charter schools. You
know, when a chart, I got so many
kids from charter schools
before testing
because they could and
we can't, we don't do that. We teach
everybody. So um I
think we need to look at
um how, how
that works because
our kids deserve better
than what they're getting right now. Thank
you.
>> All right. Thank you,
Representative. Did you need an
answer, a response on that
or can you just move on to the
next person?
You go. Thank you. All
righty. We're going to move on
to Representative Gail
Armstrong.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank
you for your presentation. Um
First off, I want to uh
publicly thank the Pe D
Secretary
Romero for taking
the bus ride that I invited
him to in Catch
County um,
uh, quite the trip
that we had and very,
uh, open
to taking that trip.
And it was, it was a
fabulous trip I thought and,
and, uh, got to
experience what some kids in rural
New Mexico actually get to go
through on a daily basis
four days a week.
Um, so starting with
that and then, um,
I would like to
talk about
if there is any reporting
done on how many of
these students
are actually reported to
CYFD? I see on
page six, we have
a side by side
of the attendance
for Success Act
compared to the
compulsory school
attendance. And
so how do we
know a number of kids that were
actually referred to
CYFD?
>> Mr Chair, Representative
Armstrong, we
got a little bit of data from
CFD in regards to those
that were reported habitually
truant. So these are the older
kiddos. Um and
I'm trying to remember the
numbers, I want to say it was in the hundreds
and only about half of those
had some further action.
Once they were referred, I can
provide you the specific numbers if you would
like. >> Uh Thank you
for that. Thank you madam
chair and, and ma'am
because
if we don't know how many
Children are actually being
reported and
we don't know the outcomes of
the reporting
status, I mean,
we we changed, we took the
teeth in my opinion out
of uh
of absenteeism.
And if
we, if we don't have any teeth in it,
then how are we supposed to hold these
kids accountable? Or
the parents,
the parents are ultimately
the ones accountable.
And so I would really like to
see the numbers on that because
as I'm pretty
sure everybody in this room would agree.
CYFD is not doing a very good
job at anything.
Um,
one of my school
districts, um, madam
chair and
representatives
wanted
to
put aps,
uh,
use
absenteeism as part of
their grade.
I mean, they're, they're trying to think
outside the box
trying to make sure these kids
are getting to school
and ultimately, like I said
before, it's the parents, the
parents need to make sure where their
kids are, what they're doing
and, and get their, get them to
school.
Um
I see on
page
I think it was page six.
No,
page 13
targeted
inter interventions
that reduce chronic
absenteeism could have
a greater impact
than adding days to the
school calendar.
So I want to make sure everyone
heard, read that in the
report
and um
we need to fund these
schools to be able
to, I can't even
imagine not taking
attendance
when I was in school if your
name was called and you weren't there.
Your mama was at the front door
with a big stick
and, and I, I was just in
the restroom, you know, I was late. We
had a tardy bell, we had a regular
bell and then we had a tardy bell. And if
you weren't in that classroom, your
parents were getting a phone call
and you were sitting in the office until your
parents got there,
we were in the
classroom.
And so we've
also got
kids
that will fall into that chronic
absenteeism
that are
going to, to
FFA events, going to
4h events,
um, showing their animals
at the county fair, the state
fair, things like that.
And these are, in my opinion,
well-rounded Children
that are learning a lot of
different life
skills
and they're being counted as
chronic
absenteeism.
And so I, I just want
to make sure that, uh,
people understand
where we, where I come
from.
Uh I have 12 grandchildren.
I have grandchildren
in public school, private school,
charter school and
homeschooled.
And um
they're well rounded because
they do all of those
things.
They, they have life
skills that are
taught by their parents
and some of my grandchildren
are raised by a single
parent.
They already have an ace,
they, they have an
ace score
and
um
we just need to
remember that
blanket
legislation does
not
work in all school
districts. Thank you,
Mr Chair madam
chair.
>> Thank you very much.
Um We are going to move on
to Representative Pettigrew.
There you go. We didn't
forget you. Representative.
Thank >> you madam chair,
Mr Chair as
well.
My, my first question
is uh to
Representative Armstrong. Can you give
me that page number again? Because I
missed that quote
13.
Thanks. I
have about 20 page numbers
on here and page 13 and one
of them.
Um
I want to give a brief story.
I will keep it brief,
but let's talk about
productivity.
And in one of
my many things I've done
over my career, I
fixed problems for a company
uh in the North
American
assets,
particular facility I
went to uh was
continuously under
producing
or another way
to say that is they spent more
time
producing
um what they needed
to produce and they should
have. And
to give you an example,
they may make 220
18 inch concrete pipe
on any typical day,
which is a 10.5 to
11 hour day.
But on Saturday, they
could do that in 6.5
hours.
So because they had a motivation
to get out, get it done.
Quality didn't change.
Safety procedures didn't
change. But
productivity
and so
um
what I did is I
brought in a bunch
of rings which are the
forms, the base
form for making a concrete
pipe. I kept
them um
offsite. And
every time they went into production
on that side of the pipe,
I would throw five more in,
I'd still get it done in that
11.5 hours.
And then
the next time they came in the production,
I threw five more in till
I got their man hours to pretend
to where they needed to be.
And then we started working on
motivating them to get
it done quicker.
Ultimately, within six
months, that facility
was doing in four
days, less
man hours more than
they did to begin
with because
we motivated them to
do it properly and they were still getting
paid the same because we increased
their wages
to offset that. We
just didn't have to run the facility three
days out of the
week.
And so what concerns me
is, I look at stuff like this, we
want to extend our, we want
to do certain things.
Um,
and it doesn't really give
a return on
investment
if you take a far fetched concept
of, let's increase the number of
days. So we get the
attendance
in the number of days because the
percentage goes up
right? 100 and 80
days, we get 100 and 52 days
out of it.
So, or we're at
100 and 67 1
52. Let's go to 100
and 80. So we can get to the
167.
That's, that's concept.
It's just
staggers
um
process thinking
we don't do
that.
There's no, there's no industry
in the world that
offsets things that
way you find that
something different to do it.
I am concerned in, in
different
areas and a challenge
that I have because I read
this report and some of this
report, um I
wouldn't have had to go to any national,
I wouldn't have had to go to Google
to, to make some of these
statements. It's just pretty
obvious.
But
um
what
if
the PED
get empowered the school
districts
to deal with their local
community
at the local community
needs
to improve
the tenants.
I like what Representative
Armstrong talked about
attendance being part of the
grade. In other words, if you
don't, if, if you're not in
attendance, that's part
of your grade. You
don't, you
don't pass that class.
I mean, right now we take a state test
that really doesn't have any value.
We don't put a marker
against it. We don't
benchmark that we don't compare
it to anything and we don't
hold anybody accountable for those
scores. Now, it may
affect the school district because
it may affect their funding rate.
But at the end of the day, it doesn't
add any value
to what we do. I mean, we took
that away um
six years ago, five
years ago. Right. We
didn't, we don't benchmark against
anything now. So
what if we gave
our superintendents
and I'm very proud of
Southeast New Mexico superintendents.
I think they do a great job.
Um And I'm not saying
other ones
don't
and I want to
emphasize
the, our
teachers
are amazing.
They have to do some of the things
that they have to
do
and fit that into
potentially one
free class
time frame.
We continue to add more work
on our teachers,
but we don't give them more time to get
that work done.
And so what if we
empowered our, our
teachers
and what if we empowered our
school districts
instead of wri writing a
rule by a department
that's rated the worst in the
country
who refers people
to a department
that's rated one of the
worst in the country.
And we have a problem.
So, PE D
sees an absentee problem.
They send somebody to
CYFD,
two fell
departments
working together to a
positive solution.
I'm not sure that's gonna work
out. Well.
What if we empower
our superintendents?
What if we give them the
strength? What
if we quit making decisions
in Santa Fe
and start holding our superintendents
accountable and let our
communities hold
our superintendents accountable.
They live in our community, they
love our students, they know our
students and they know our
needs.
What are your thoughts on
that?
>> Mr Chair and Representative
Pettigrew, I would agree with you that
there is a need for
local innovation
and local independence
to an extent. But we would
also like to see
the public education department
helping provide guidance
and support for
districts that maybe have less
capacity. And so I
think that ideally there would
be um
a collaboration across both
of those individuals
and you'll see in some of our recommendations
that we do say that
PD should clarify, that districts
have the ability to
do certain things that have maybe not
been explicitly stated
previously. And that has
led to some confusion so
that uh some of our
recommendations, I believe in that last
chapter are
things like that.
Districts. Should I if
you, I will quote it rather
than saying off the top of my
head.
Um
Sorry for
that.
Yes, that
PD should implement rule
explaining that giving a student
no credit is allowed. So that's
something that would be done at a district
level, right? Some districts
may want to allow for
no credit for some students.
Well, other districts may not.
The next one is that uh pe
D should implement rule that districts can
require additional instructional time for
students. Again, that's a district
level uh intervention that
some districts can implement in many different
ways. And so
we through this uh
project saw that some
local innovation was really
leading to positive change and we want that
to happen. But we also want the Public
Education Department to be
supporting those districts that may
be struggling with those
components.
>> Thank you chairman and thank
you for that answer. I
do you know there is
time when, when you want
to bring experts in
and I'm not saying that we don't have
experts within the PE D.
We just have the
system right now that is
fumbling over
itself.
And it's, I think
you all started a conversation
with the chain turnover that's
happened with within PE
D just in the last
year. Well, we
can go back and
continue to look at that for the
last five years.
It's, it's just
their turnover rates
probably one of the worst in the,
in the state with
respect to
uh
leadership.
And uh and
so I, I just
get concerned where
we should be focusing,
we should allow our
focus and, and
provide a carrot
for the ones that perform
well. And
just as we go back to
the previous presentation
where we talk about
opportunity,
cultures
use that opportunity
with respect to our superintendents
and our school districts that are,
that are implementing
concepts that work.
Let's just focus on one
right now, which is
attendance
that are implementing those things
and then empower them
and engage
them to go help the
districts that aren't
performing
to help analyze,
send in a heat team,
send in AAA team
that goes in and can actually
help
when invited
because help not requested
is not help,
that's called
well, in most parts
of the world, that's a
dictatorship.
We go in and we tell you
what to do when,
if somebody then ask for help,
you're not giving
help.
You know, my, my,
my, my wife
asks, has, has
we have conversations
or sometimes she wants to
vent? Sometimes
she wants a solution.
If I try and give a solution when
she wants to vent, I'm not
helping, I'm not
helping the situation at
all. So at the end of the
day,
if we're gonna look at
things like what the
earlier presentation
was on
using opportunity, concepts,
pulling teams together,
why don't we take our superintendents
that are, that are
truly successful
in key areas
and create those teams
that can go help others
that have requested
help.
Because if it comes from a
bureaucracy,
it's not help.
We've thrown more money
at the education
department in
the last five years, then
forever. I I don't
even want to talk about what the
increase in budget is.
The performance hasn't
changed
things to think about
things that I'd like to have answers
at the next time. You guys
come back because I'd like to
see a different approach.
If this is a good idea for
our students, maybe it's a good
idea to help our schools that
need help too. Thank
you, Chairman. >> Thank
you very much. Representative.
Next is Senator Share and we're going
to move on a little quicker because we
are falling quite behind.
Senator in. Proceed. >> Thank
you.
Thank you, madam chair.
Uh, first, I want to turn
to the page 63.
Appendix JJ
is the 10th letter in the alphabet. So
it's too many appendixes in
63 is at least
60 pages too much.
But beside that,
um, as
we go down here and we look at
the big, the big
ones, uh, medical
appointments, not sure you can do
anything about that, but
then we come down to the next
40%
and it's parental decisions.
Ok. Extended
vacations.
All right. Uh,
I don't like that but
you know, sometimes that, that
help or is in the way
homeschooling is
homeschooling really a
an absentee
or they
learning
>> Senator madam
Mr Chair, Senator
Share. Um, I believe
that it's homeschooling when you're not
telling the district that you
were homeschooling, you pull the kid out,
but the district doesn't
know. And so that can be
happening without, uh, while
they're still being recorded as absent
homeschooling can be
very successful. Uh, as
long as there are specific
guard ras, uh,
there.
>> Ok. I've had
my kids and my
grandkids have, I think, attended
every kind of school you can attend,
starting with the department of
Defense schools
and private
schools and charter schools and Catholic
schools and home schools
and I
don't know any other kind of school you can
get out there. I think home school has worked
best for them actually,
uh, lack of interest in
schools.
One of the things that I think we
did, uh, we took
a lot of the trades out of our
schools,
but there is an enormous
amount of math.
They can be learned by
welding
and by auto
mechanics
and by
almost every other
trade, there's also
an enormous amount of reading
that's, that's done in
those,
uh, and they're
interested
so you can put them in a math
class where they're bored out of their
mind or you can teach them to
weld while they'll learn
math because they want to
weld because the welder
out there is making 100 grand a year
or more.
100 and 50.
Ok. And if you're
willing to weld in a, in a,
in a, a
sandstorm when it's
100 degrees, you're gonna make
more.
So, II I think
that this, you know, lack of interest
in schools, which goes along
with the lack of motivation.
One, I think that's
exactly what, what's
happening. They
don't know why they're going to school,
bored out of their
mind.
So,
but then the, the one
technological distractions,
well, you know, if you're playing games,
that's a technological distraction.
But if you're, if
you're
learning something,
then you're learning
something. And again,
uh, we, I, I
think we need to,
to, to
think about that. So you've got all these
lists here.
But the superintendent of
Carlsbad said, hey,
put the money above the line and let
us do
it.
Ok.
Yet in your report, you kept saying
pe D needs to do this.
No, Carlsbad needs
to do it or Farmington needs
to do it.
Um So lit
them, lit them
instead. What we did is
we came back here to Appendix
E which is the
fifth letter in 41
page 41.
Um who got
extra money.
Well, Albuquerque
in Farmington and Gadsden Las
Cruces, a real all with
high absentee rates.
So we, we gave
them money
as a as an
incentive
when we should have just put it above the
line and let them do what they wanted to
do
and these things just, they
don't make sense to me. Why are we giving
money as an incentive
uh for absenteeism?
And we've got the
list of why they're not coming but,
but we're not, we're
not thinking far enough
ahead to say,
ok, if we teach them to
weld, they'll show
up. If we
teach them to play football, they'll
show up.
If they're sitting in a boring
class. Why
show
up?
>> Thank you. You are
done.
Thank you very much for, for
your comments. All righty,
we are gonna move on to
Representative Hernden
and then we've got Representative
Chatfield, Representative
Baca and Representative Garrett.
Thank you. Thank >> you
madam chair and uh
presenters. I would like to
draw your attention to page seven
if you would turn there, please.
And on that page you
describe you present
a,
a chart and on
that chart, you show five
areas where there's 100%
absenteeism if I'm
reading your chart correctly.
And what are those school
districts?
>> Mr Chair members
of the committee representative
Herndon, uh,
the, none of the
school districts actually
have 100% chronic
absenteeism rate. It's just
that the, the colors
start turning to the dark red once
you get above 60 or
70 some school districts
do have really high
chronic absenteeism rates that
are uh closer
to 8070 or
80%. >> So they are
five there. And what
are they? >> Uh
It's Clayton County,
which we are Clayton school district,
which we understand uh
There was a problem with their
student information system which
may be over counting or
over reporting absences.
Uh We tried to clear up that
data issue before uh and it
kind of speaks to our recommendation
about student information
systems. Uh We
also have on their
um
mckinley
um and
gallop. Uh
and I'm not, I'm not sure uh
which what
the figures are on the
other school districts
there.
>> Well, the II I
just pre present
to you Mr Chair and present
is that the fact that they were in red,
whether the colors were increased
and they were high. It was
just important to point out what
those school districts were so that
we could understand that. And
maybe at some point in time, you could
make that information available
and share it with us
Mr Chaney and
presenters. The other item
is you mentioned that there's
problems taking
attendance. Well,
if there's problems taking
attendance, what is the mechanism
you're using for determining
there's chronic
absenteeism.
>> Mr Chair Representative
Herden Hernden.
I'm sorry. We
were using a number of different
mechanisms to determine what chronic
absenteeism was. We were
typically using Pe D's
data
which is reported
by districts.
While we believe
that there may be instances
where the PE D
is significantly
over undercounting.
Typically it's probably
not so
sufficient or so
significant that it is
throwing doubt to all of the
data. It is more uh more
likely maybe a 5
10% difference. And we
believe that having better
student information systems and
having PE D provide more technical
assistance to districts
as to how to operate
those student student
information systems could solve
this problem. >> So
thank you, Mr Chair and thank you being
a presenter. So pe
D has some form of
determining absenteeism
that is reported
to you that is not taken
attendance.
It's it's unclear as to
how you are making that determination,
>> how we got to the the lack
of attendance taking.
We received data directly
from districts
highlighting
what where
teachers were not taking
attendance. Uh Some
of the student information systems
has a mechanism to
highlight that. And so we
got specific reports from
a few districts that showed where they
were not taking attendance.
Beyond that, we did a
survey of attendance team
personnel and asked
attendance teams. Um
what frequency are teachers taking
attendance daily. What we
heard back from them is
while about two thirds of teachers
are taking attendance more than
95% of the time.
Um a roughly one third of
teachers are taking attendance less than
95% of the
time.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and I have one
last question with respect
to your recommendation of more
school days. I'm
looking at the case that is
pending in court right now
asking for an increase of
school days to 100 and
80. And
my question to you
is, are you arguing that
case before the court? I'm
just trying to understand the position that
you're taking in relationship
to what the court has determined for
the time
being.
>> Madam chair Representative
Hernden. Are you referring to our recommendation
to have required
school?
>> No, I thought you were requiring more
school days was one
recommendation with
respect to making sure that
our students were
learning more. Did I
hear that >> incorrectly? I believe
you heard that incorrectly.
>> So what was your recommendation?
>> We have a recommendation
that PED
clarified to districts
that they are able to
require extra school for students
who are excessively absent.
This is something that we've seen
in a few districts
and it seems that
it is successful
and so it
is a natural consequence,
correct? If
you're missing school, the natural consequence
would be more school, but
we do not have a recommendation
to increase the school
calendar. >> Thank
you very much. Thank
you madam chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative Chatfield.
Thank you for your patience,
>> madam chair.
Thank you for some time. I see
the secretary setting out
there and,
and I
appreciate that he stepped into a
hard job and,
and uh don't let
that go past you when I,
while I'm talking today.
But under the guidance
of pe D for
many, many years, we
are dead last in the
nation. Under
the guidance of PE D,
we are dead last in the
nation. The
information that we
just got. I, I live
in the Mascaro school
district which is
right beside the Clayton school
district.
Mascaro. I
assure you does not have
0%
absenteeism.
It has a fairly low
absenteeism, but I assure
you it's not 0% which
is on what, what it says on
the chart. It's light
blue. I think that's
uh zero.
Clayton. I promise
you. Uh
They are a very
dedicated school
district. They, they
uh take things seriously,
I promise you, they don't
have 100%
absenteeism.
Um How
they, how the numbers are
brought, brought to us.
us. I, I
don't, I have no
idea, but I would
imagine that they are fairly
similar in their
rates of a
absenteeism.
I know the families, I know the
kids. I know the schools.
I, I was on the
school board in Musca for,
for 16
years.
So, uh,
I wonder, that makes me wonder
about the rest of the chart. I, I'm
not too sure how
accurate that that
would be.
Oh,
we did page
13
reducing
absenteeism will
increase instructional
time. That is a
and I, I believe that I believe
that's a good recommendation,
but instead the
recommendation is to go to a
fiveyear day
week for
students that live in remote
areas. They need a day to
go to the doctor, they need a
day to go to town, they need
a day to deal with all
the other aspects of life
that they don't
have just one aspect
of life, they have other aspects
of life. So
I just uh
throw it out there that if
you're gonna be culturally
relevant
and it doesn't
matter if you're
on Indian lands, cowboy
lands or in the city,
you need to have local
input. This
uh school that is doing
what I, by the way, graduated
in Carlsbad. And they
have always, always had
CTE, when
I graduated, they used to
buy a lot every
year. And then by the end
of the school year, they would have a house
built on that lot. And every
child in the building trades
program would know a
little bit about framing
electrical. And
that was a long, long time
ago, we had a auto
shop, we
had a variety of other
uh types of
CTE and
it works. So
Kudos
Carlsbad,
um
next comment,
question, whatever is
how does
retaining a student
that has mastered
the subject
matter,
help the
schools, the public
or the student
if they are retained simply
because they miss
school. I mean,
there should be one mark of
passing and that is, do you
know how to read,
write and do an arithmetic
to the level of, of
the grade that you're in?
If you can learn it by showing
up for the lecture and
skip the homework?
Well, fine. You
know, if you can learn it by,
by reading at night,
fine. The goal is to
teach that student how to read and
write. We need to not
let that get away from us.
The goal is not to punish
them to have to come
in and conform
to some standard. The goal
is to teach them to read and
write
and I will leave you with
a question.
Yeah. And that question
is
maybe for the
superintendents of
Carlsbad or Hobbs
or somewhere. What
is the absentee
rate of the
students in your CTE
programs? Because
I think it will be
much lower. Is there
someone out there that would, could
answer that question?
>> Thank you, Representative.
Um You want to take a stab at
that um, Sarah
or one
of you? Thank >> you,
Mr chair members of the
Committee Representative
Chatfield. Thank you for that question.
Uh We tried to gather
systematic data on
the relationship between
CTE and absenteeism
and we're unable to find that.
However, all the school
officials that we spoke with
told us that CT was
a positive influence on
attendance and that students involved
in CTE programs were
more excited to come to school
and there is national research out
there that backs that up.
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to put together that
data to mirror
the national results with
New Mexico
data.
>> Thank you madam chair. That's
all. >> Thank
you very much, Representative
Representative Baca. You're
>> next. Thank you madam chair
and I'll make it brief. I promise chairman
two minutes. You can
gavel me
attendance is important
in reality, I could have you here for
eight hours and not get through all my
questions. Uh
I want to thank you for your
work on the report.
I I will say publicly
that I have questions regarding the
analysis uh
regarding some of your findings
and I, I definitely have some disagreement
in some of the recommendations.
I will say that
I I it is about
quality, not
quantity,
more of the
same poor
instruction will not
get kids in school as
Senator Scher alluded
to.
I think the important thing that we need to
realize and we need to question
is why, what
are the reasons that students are not
going to school?
That's an important piece of
that. And
also uh madam chair
and panel,
I will say
that
any, any recommendation,
we, we talk about the intent of
legislator, we talk about local
decision making, local control.
It has been very well
documented that that is a
bipartisan
uh school
or thought. So we need to
um really respect
that it's not the
local communities and the single
communities have and know what
their students need.
But uh Mr Chairman and
madam chair, I will say
that for Les C when we go to
Chama uh in a couple weeks
and I will definitely
be using more than my two minutes. Thank
you madam >> chair. Thank
you, representative. All right, we're
gonna go to Representative Garrett. You're
>> next. Thank
you madam chair. Thank
you. Um
uh pe D and
thank you all the educators because I'm
sure as you're sitting here
listening to this, the faces
of very specific
students come
to mind. I I know that's
true. Uh One
suggestion I have,
we can't just say parents, I
think we have to say parents,
grandparents and
guardians
because we know that so
many of our Children live with grandparents,
aunties, uncles,
sometimes neighbors. So
that's just a reminder
to all of us
that the grandparents
and parents are experiencing
generational adverse
childhood experiences.
Um The II I
wanna draw
one picture. I had a favorite
sixth grader in the South Valley
high poverty school,
lived in a
trailer, such
a precious child.
She stopped coming to school
often because
she was taking care of four half
siblings while her mother
worked and her stepfather was in
prison in other state.
So we can't,
it's not an excuse
for this, but we can't
forget what
that role plays.
And then the other thing I want to
say is
um
what a
representative
Armstrong reminded us.
We have to differentiate
excused absences,
some parents we know
abuse it, but we
have the the
FAA but we also
have uh many
of our native American students
are at uh all
sorts of ceremonies and that has
to be honored too. And
then finally,
um
on, on page 16,
what I was reminded of PD
and schools need to engage parents
better because of school
shootings and
concerns about safety.
Many of our schools aren't as
open as they were
in my elementary school where
there are 1,101,150
students. The first grade
parents used to gather in the
hallway and
they felt welcome. They're no
longer allowed to do
that. Uh Some
schools, a kindergarten
comes late
and the parent can't ask
escort them to the
room, a staff person
has to do it. So
in the process of
safety,
we've sometimes shut
the door on our
parents and guardians
and grandparents feeling
welcomed and it's just a
reality in
many of our districts and schools.
That's what I wanted to share. Thank
you.
OK, thank >> you very much,
Representative Representative
Garcia. You are the last
person on the list. >> Thank
you, madam chair.
Thank you, presenters. You
know, this, this whole conversation
is revolve around
absenteeism
and how do we fix
it? That
seems to be the whole problem.
You know, I'm looking at page
27 and the
security states here, pe
D has not
consistently provided
assisted information
likely leading
to inconsistent
quality strategies.
And then it goes to say that,
you know, you guys are not doing that
because of lack of staff. Well,
can you answer to that? Why,
why are we putting so much
money into pe D
or the education?
And you guys don't have the staff to
address the problems?
And here we are pointing fingers
at teachers and whatever.
And to me, the
big culprit right here is PE
D.
>> Thank you, madam,
chair representative.
I think part
of sometimes
we forget that
we, we do issue
guidance, right? And
that we that local
education agencies do
have the ability
to set how
those guidance
will be met and
ensuring that the policies
that they're creating for
districts and schools
on how that
attendance
and takes again, meeting
the state guidance,
they do have that
power to
do that. And so
I think part of the
issue or the challenge could
have been, yes, the
transition, not only of
leadership but understanding
the transition when all
of our um local
education agencies
went remotely
and then coming back to
having that sys
systematic
um routine
on what the attendance look
like versus when they
were doing it remotely and
it was COVID and,
and they kind of deviate
a little bit from what
that routine attendance
look like. And so getting
people back on that mindset of
how to do that
structurally have
shifted and we
are doing our
best again
to providing that guidance and
that support to bring them
back. The
one of the men
about the systems. That is
very true. Uh All
the school districts uh might
have different
student information
systems and then you have, you
know, your school districts
that might have a state of the
art um student
information system where you
have an specific chart
and I'm looking at the room and
I can see, you know,
um, this person is absent
and I just have to click a button
and it communicates it
all throughout. And then we
have, you know, school districts
that really have outdated
systems and they have
to do the paper
role taking. And
if that's not your teacher of
record and you have a substitute,
they can be discrepancies because
they don't know the student as
well as their regular
teacher of record. So
there are different layers
of why that
inconsistency can be
happening. Um But I
would say again, we are working
on really bringing back to
having that structure
um system for all
of our um school districts
to understand not
only the importance of doing
this in a, in a
structure routinely way
by doing it um every
day and doing it,
leveraging the tools that they
have to do that
effectively.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Thanks for that. But
why is it that you so
understaffed that you can't
handle what's happening with our school
districts because you know, like you
just finished saying some
school districts have the funding,
some don't to do
this, but it's
the clearly states right
here. That most
of this problem is because the pe
D
and then it goes
on to say because you're so
understaffed, you
know, back to the, the first
part of it. You know, we
put so much money into
education.
Why is it that you're
understaffed and you control
all the
districts.
>> Thank you, madam,
chair representative.
I don't think there
is necessarily a
correlation with
the attendance
taking and the
staffing
number
at the agency. So our
vacancy for
this particular area
that overseas attendance
have stayed
consistent. I think
what the study was
referencing to
is that the person
in place have
changed over the
last year. So for example, I
mentioned earlier um
11 months into my
role with the agency,
right? Um I don't, I can't
tell you how long the person
prior to me was there.
Unfortunately, the person
that was um are
stayed at attendance
coordinator passed away,
that's, you know, definitely
a loss that, that we
had. So I think she
was or the study making
reference to not
having a consistent
long term, not
necessarily not having
adequate staffing
to be understaffed
if I and I'll let Doctor
Vincents clarify. Can I
can I
>> Mr Chair representative?
I apologize. Thank you for letting me come,
come up real quick.
Um Since my
first day here, uh in
this position, we started
off with about 28%
vacancy rates that so that was
an issue not just with,
with this topic, but with
an every topic, um,
as of yesterday, we were checking
we're just over 12%
vacancy rate. So we've had a
huge impact
and be able to hire and,
and retain
at the public education department.
So I feel very optimistic
as we move forward that we'll be able to
better support all of our
school districts and schools across the state of
New Mexico because we have the people in
place. This is the best I've
ever seen it in my 28
year career. And so I want you
to hold me to that, keep asking me that
question to see how we continue
to provide better support
for districts across New
Mexico.
>> Uh Thank you. Uh
uh
You know, I was just reading off of
what I'm reading here and the
lady said that uh schools
are understaffed but this is
pointing it completely
right at pe d not the
schools, you know, and
I, I don't know what the
schools are understaffed
by what whatever,
but this clearly states
that you guys are not doing your
job directly
because of staffing,
you know, and, but you just clarified
a little bit that the staffing
were 28% higher than 12.
So that's a big improvement.
But we need to not point fingers
at the schools, we
need to point fingers at
ourselves as
to why this is happening.
The clear states here because
you guys are not providing
sufficient information
to the schools. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you madam >> chair. Sure,
thank you, Representative. All right, we've
got Representative Brown.
We had to add one
here. So your next and
last >> more
animated, I guess.
Thank you madam chair. And
uh this question for, I guess anybody
who would like to tackle it is
regarding page 63 of
the
handout
and this is Appendix J
and here we're seeing the results of a
survey that was done
about causes
of chronic absenteeism.
Um I would expect looking
at the furthest
right column, I would
expect to see it
total to 100% but
we're seeing
percentages that add
up to more. So if you're looking at, why
are they absent?
Why are we seeing
um it
not really adding up? So,
you know, we would expect it to and
then question is,
could this be multifactorial
madam chairman where there may
be two or three reasons why a
student is absent on a particular
day?
>> Mr Chair Representative Brown.
That's, that's exactly right.
We asked them, uh, please
select all of the myriad of reasons why
students may be absent. And
then we asked them the second time,
select the top three and I believe
this is the from the top
three. And so our number
should add up to 100 >> because of that.
Ok, thank you.
>> All righty. Thank you.
Thank you, Representative
Mayest as quick
if you can, Senator, I
keep calling you. Thank you, madam.
>> Chair on
that point represent Brown.
Do you um did you
ask him why they were absent
on a particular day
or in general? Why is your
kid absent?
>> Chair Senator
Maestas? We asked
them,
what are the main causes for
students being chronically absent?
We didn't ask about absence
overall because
we, we
want to understand the students
were absent more than the 10%
of school days rather than the students were
maybe absent one or two
times. Thank
you. >> Thank you, Senator
and I apologize for
continue to call you representative
sometimes sometimes
I'm getting better. Thank
you very much. We don't have
anyone else on the list
and we just want to
move on to the next
item. Appreciate you
being here and presenting. Thank
you. All righty. We're going to go
on to the 10 o'clock
um item um
that is class size and
teacher supports and quality of
instruction. Annie,
you are it
today. Where is
Annie and
um Sony?
That's great Arsenio.
Ok. Cabinet
Secretary.
Yes, you can proceed. Thank
>> you. Thank you madam
chair.
My name is Sunny Lieu. I am
your analyst for public
schools and I'm joined today
by Annie Armitage,
senior policy analyst for
Les C
Dr Senel
Romero from PE D
Secretary and
Denise Director
of Policy. And
I'll turn it over to Annie to start
with our report, which is
a joint LFC LES
C report on class
sizes under Tab
L.
>> You just say Tab F I couldn't
L. Ok.
Thank
you
and congratulations >> to
thank you so much.
Um Madam chair
committee, thank you so much
for having us today.
This report was spurred by
the passing of House Memorial
20 in session this year
which tased Les C to
work with LFC
um to analyze
class sizes in New Mexico
and to consider potential
um impacts on
student outcomes, staffing
and funding.
So, research is very
clear in showing that teachers
are the most important
school related factor influencing
student outcomes and
significantly the
court in the Martinez Yazzie
lawsuit uh concluded
that the quality of teaching for
at risk students in New
Mexico uh was
inadequate and
New Mexico does face
numerous barriers to
ensuring that each class
is staffed with a high
quality teacher
knowing this, the legislature
has made significant inves
investments in teacher
compensation preparation. And
if you turn with me to page
two,
we can see that the legislature
has increased recurring
funding to public schools by
50% since
2019.
And about 60% of that
has gone towards teacher
compensation.
But despite these investments,
teacher attrition and vacancies
do persist in the state.
In school year, 24 there were an
estimated
1471
vacancies for licensed school
personnel. And of
those, about 751
are attributable to teacher
vacancies.
If you look at chart two
on page two,
you can see that completer from
educator preparation programs
have been increasing year
over year and we're
excited to see those outcomes.
But we do want to note if you can
see that the majority of those
completer now are
alternative licensure
teachers and alternative
licensure teachers of
which I was 1 may
start teaching after taking
one course on sort of,
do you want to be a teacher and without
any classroom experience
whatsoever when you begin?
So it's important to note that the
majority of our completes in the
state are those
individuals.
Um I also want to note
that
t teacher turnover
is pretty high. The most
recent estimates estimated
at about 23%
which is amongst the highest rates
in the nation. And if
you turn to the next page
page three, you
can see charts three through
five and those really show
that fewer and fewer teachers
are remaining in their schools
and districts um from one
year to the next and that
the average years of teacher
experience have been
decreasing each
year.
So, while the legislature has
made substantial investments
in teacher preparation and
compensation, the
legislature has given less
attention to supporting
teachers within schools
once they're there. And that's going to be
really important for addressing
that teacher turnover. That's
happening.
Educators themselves
frequently call for smaller
class sizes. I imagine
all of you have heard of this
or thought it yourselves.
And the Marti Martinez Yazzie
ruling um found
that the state doesn't provide at
risk students
pro proven programs
that they need to succeed.
They cited several of these
programs and one of
those was uh having
smaller class
sizes.
So what does the national
research say about class
sizes?
Um First of all, if we want
to consider the impacts on teacher
retention, there are very few studies
uh that study the
impacts on teacher retention. There
are a few that show some
small correlations
between smaller class
sizes and increased teacher
retention. There
are many more
studies studying the outcomes,
the student outcomes from class
size reductions and
the most uh influential
and credible is called the star
study. It was conducted in
Tennessee. Let
me direct
you to where that
is
that would be on page
four. And what
they did was they randomly assigned
over 7000 students
in kindergarten through third
grades to small
classes that had 13 to
17 students
regularized classes
with 22 to 25
students and regular
classes with an educational
assistant.
And what they found was that on
average, the students who had been
assigned to the small
classes were found to have
grown by an additional three months
of schooling. That's a 0.22
standard deviation
compared to their peers in the larger
class sizes. And this
effect was driven by
the substantial growth amongst
kindergarten students in the smaller
class sizes. I
also want to note that the effect
sizes were largest for
at risk students in those
groups. Overall
meta analysis of
class size reduction studies
have found frankly very mixed
results. Um
that being the most
kind of trusted one,
we we're seeing that it
does um we can
expect some significant
differences in student outcomes
but frankly, those effect sizes
are pretty
small.
If you turn with me to page
five, you can see a cost
benefit analysis of class
size reduction in relation
to other educational
interventions. These are
from 2019 LFC
results first, uh initiative
initiatives
and if you look with me on the benefit
to cost ratio, you can see that
the cost benefit of reducing
class size averages by
one student in various
grades is pretty
low in comparison to other
educational interventions such
as literacy, consultant,
teachers or tutoring by
certified teachers.
However, we also want to
consider the effect size, it could
cost a lot but be
very effective. And
we can also see that the
effect sizes are
relatively low in comparison
as Well, I do want to
note that for the youngest
students in early childhood,
those effect sizes are higher.
So that's where we want to make sure we're
having our smallest class
sizes.
But what do they look like in New
Mexico? So, New
Mexico first set
class size requirements for K
12 students in the early nineties
and has changed very little
since there have been numerous
legislative attempts to change it
since then. However,
if you turn with me to page
six on figure
one, you can see an overview
of what the statutory requirements
are for class sizes in different
grades. Um
Pre K is in the text, it's not
in the graphic, but I can tell you that
for uh three year
olds in pre K class
size maximums are set at 16
students with a 1 to 8
ratio required. That usually
means there's an E A in the classroom
if it's larger and
a maximum of 20 students for four
year olds with a 1 to 10
ratio again, meaning there's often
a pre K in the class
classroom.
Now, looking at that figure
one you can see in kindergarten, the
maximum class size is 14
students with a maximum of
20 if there's an E A in the
classroom. And then if we
look through grades first
through sixth grades, those
maximum class sizes are actually
based on averages amongst
grades. So that can mean
uh you can meet those class
size requirements you
know, 22 to 24 students
depending on the grade levels.
But that can mean that you can have
have substantial variation
between classes within a
school and still meet those
requirements.
If we look at secondary school,
those class loads are actually based
on teaching loads for
teachers. And
in el A there are
actual flat class
size maximum requirements
ranging from 27 to
30 students. Um
that's between middle school and high
school.
So that's setting the
stage for what the requirements
are to try to get out
what is actually happening and
happening in New Mexico.
Staff analyzed pe
D course roster data for
pre K through 12th grade
for the 2022 to
2023 school
year. And charter
schools are required to report
on class sizes and
composition of class sizes by
the 40th day each year.
We do want to know that it seems
that districts are reporting
this data in a very
inconsistent manner which
makes analysis of class
sizes very challenging.
Um Staff
made certain assumptions to
omit certain classes from
analysis. Um assuming
data entry requirements that would
be a class size of one or a
class size of 50.
Um things that we think are
likely a data error.
However, we do believe that there
was enough d present
that seems to reflect
realities reported that
we, we think this gives a good
overall view at a state
level of what we're seeing.
So you can see in chart
six class
sizes from pre K to
sixth grade are
um below or
well below those maximums.
Um We can see pre K
an average of 13.5.
Um well below that 16
requirement and
then all the way up to sixth
grade, the highest at
almost highest at 18.2
average students. Well
below that 24 maximum
requirement.
Um I also want to note that
in first through sixth grades,
these statewide class averages
are actually very
near the small
class sizes that were found
to produce student effects on
learning by that star study
and those small classes for them were
13 to 17 students.
So we're actually right
now on average within that
range,
I do want to note that the legislator
could consider and there have been numerous
bills attempting to do this in the
past years including a couple
just in the session this year.
Um Removing
that flexibility
that the averaging allows
so allowing schools
to meet that um
maximum by averaging,
you could have a class of 30 a
class of, I don't know what that is
mathematically 14 or something
and it ends up meeting that.
So there have been attempts to remove
that. Um We do want to caution the
legislature that
doing that could remove
flexibility um to
prevent strategic local
decisions. So, we've heard
of, you know, superintendents
and principals deciding to provide
a stipend to more experienced
teacher to have a larger class
while allowing a first year baby
teacher to have a smaller class,
which could be um a
beneficial decision in
certain situations
if we want to shift and look
towards middle school and high
school averages by
subject, we looked at the
core subjects. You can see that
on page seven in charts
seven and eight.
we did exclude
analysis of electives
um because they were reported so
differently, It was very
difficult to classify them. But
you can see EL
A math science and social
studies here and you can
see that those averages across
the board statewide are also
quite low and well
below. Even the most stringent
statewide maximum requirements
for secondary grades in EL
A which is 27 to 30
students. We're looking at
averages rating rate,
um sorry, ranging from
15.2 students
up to
21.3.
So these, we still feel quite good
about in secondary
education. They're
also from elementary
all the way to high school quite
consistent with the national averages
and actually just a little bit below
them.
Um I want to note
that while we really
wanted to conduct a lot more
nuanced analysis looking
at special education
ell students,
um
We, we did not
due to concerns about
highly variable data
quality and how it was reported
and once you start getting to those
smaller sample sizes, that
becomes trickier.
So we didn't do that. But I do
want to show you that on page
20 appendix A
does show you district
wide class size
averages
by grade and
subject
and we do have a few uh
districts and charter
schools, state charter schools
highlighted here. I want
to note that those highlighted districts
just indicate um
kind of above average
class sizes. Did you not
necessarily indicate that anybody
was out of compliance with
statutory
requirements?
So,
moving on to page
eight,
what do school districts do when they're
unable to meet statutory
class size requirements? They can
apply for a waiver from
pe D for one year which can
be renewed. I believe a maximum
of one time. And
pe D has reported
I can tell you right
now who those were in the
last two
years.
So in school year
2024 that's the
school year that just ended
districts who had a waiver
were Artesia
Taos Gallup and two
charter schools, La Academia
de Dolores and Huer
uh Huerta charter
school. And in
2023 districts
granted a waiver included
Artesia Clovis,
Las Cruces and
Gallup.
So now I'm gonna turn it over
to sunny to talk about what would
the estimated cost of reducing
class sizes further in New Mexico
be?
>> Thank you, Annie. Um
Stay on page
eight.
I think one of the challenges
of understanding the actual
costs of reducing class
sizes is that it really
depends on where you are in the
state
and there are, there's a lot of limited
information about how many
classrooms physically
in the facility that we have.
We did get receive a data
set from PS fa that
had everything except
Gallup Albuquerque
and Portalis, which is pretty
significant. Uh
But
uh there are a lot of empty
classrooms around the state.
Uh Still
with that assumption of,
let's say you wanted to reduce
classes by five
students which would be
substantial. Uh
We estimate costs about
40 million just to
pay for the additional
staff that you
would need to fill those
classrooms on
average.
And that the infrastructural costs
of moving around
portables or
repurposing certain
empty classrooms or
adding new classrooms would be
about 72 million.
Once again, excluding very
large data
sets of
classrooms that we were unable
to obtain. So the the cost
could be substantially higher than
that. Uh One
thing that you do want to note
if you turn with me to page nine,
looking at that chart,
we are seeing declining birth
rates a lot about
migration from the state. So
your student population
is
declining and
mathematically speaking,
as you can see, the teacher
population is staying
relatively flat from where it
was about a decade ago.
Uh your class sizes will
naturally in some ways
shrink because of that
phenomenon. Now, it may be
very
volatile if you're
in a particularly small district
with certain bubbles of
large students flowing
through those grade levels. But
on a whole, on
average, your average
statewide
class size should be reducing
over time, particularly given
the trends that we're seeing.
So with that, I
think, you know, Annie did a very good
job of describing the problem
statement, which is you've really
made this soil
fertile. You've raised
teacher pay,
you've built strong
preparation programs.
Now, the real challenge is
how do you improve
that practice and
quality within
the classrooms?
Day one.
And I think that as
we look at some of the supports
that you have provided as a
legislature, you
know, there's some that are already in
place,
some that are, we're
really on the cusp of evaluating
to see what really works
and some that are
innovative and
we still don't know, but
the evidence is promising
such as what you heard from Carlsbad
this morning, I'm going to touch
on a few of those and then I'll hand it back
to Annie for a
little bit detail on the
Carlsbad
Innovation
starting with teach residency
programs. This has
been a
Cadillac version of how
you prepare teachers by giving
them real clinical
experience before
they even start teaching with their full
classroom to
themselves.
You as a legislature have
prudently given us
a three year roadmap to
study and look at,
here's a sample of teachers.
We're really giving them the
full
residency experience of
one year clinical
practice.
How are they going to do compared to
their peers who go through a traditional
program or
an alternative pathway
program?
Certainly our recommendation at this
point is to stay the course.
Look at how these
residents perform,
refine the process
as you go along. And at the end
of that sort of three year
pilot, uh look
at whether this should be the new
way we do business in preparing
teachers.
Moving on to page 11,
you have a very robust
mentorship statute
in place. I
think the problem is we have, we
have not really monitored or
looked at whether
mentorship is happening
effectively
within those first
few years of teaching.
A lot of P D's programs
do provide some supports,
but they're mostly targeted
to teachers in their
1st, 2nd,
3rd, more
experienced years. And
so leaving
districts the
responsibility of
preparing those first year
teachers
um can be something
that the state takes a
stronger look at
and maybe it can be coupled with
what we're doing with residencies.
I mean, that is a very
intensive type of mentoring that
is happening already and,
and perhaps these things can be
married together a little
more.
Um
specifically
turning on to page
12, there's been a lot of
focus on the role of
educational assistants. You
as the legislature have recently
increased their
minimum pay from 12,000
per year to 25,000 per
year. I do want to
caution that, you know,
simply adding educational
assistance uh while
that be may be good at reducing
class loads, it's
really important that these eas
have a very strong
working uh
collaboration with
their teacher of
record. Teachers
aren't often trained on how to
leverage their eas
appropriately. E
A sometimes don't get training
on how to support
students um in the
best way, they may be
creating practices that
rely on E A
supports, which
the evidence would suggest is
not um
good for student outcomes.
So having more
supports on how we train
eas how we leverage them and how
we make sure that they work with their
teachers on effective
practices will be the
next step in improving our, our
leveraging of those
individuals. Something
that's really interesting in New Mexico
is that we have a pathway for
eas to become
teachers. So we've
actually looked at them as
a pipeline itself
into the profession, which is
a promising
practice given that we know
that a lot of eas
are members
of the community, they
grew up, they're more
likely to stay. And
so that may be something to look
into, there is a current
program that was paid
through ether
dollars pandemic relief aid
called Educator Fellows, which
the department is piloting.
At this point, we
suggest keeping an eye on
that program and seeing the results
of that moving
forward.
And these are the things
that the legislature
in its wisdom has done
already. Uh
You have
set the stage and you've
put the state on the road
for success.
It's really about monitoring
and making sure that these programs
are producing the
intent outcomes that you
have set forth for them. And I'll
turn it over to Annie to go a bit
into innovative staffing models
at this
time.
>> Thank you, Sonny Madam, chair members
of the committee.
There are a lot of different innovative
staffing models out there. We chose to
look at opportunity culture because
Carlsbad right here in New Mexico
has done a fabulous job piling
it already. Uh We
had a really interesting
opportunity to
compare uh the
educational growth of middle
schoolers in a middle school in
Carlsbad who's implemented
opportunity culture and
middle schoolers in a school that
has not implemented opportunity
culture. And so we looked at the
differences in student growth.
Um over this past
school year, I won't go into
detail about opportunity
culture because I know that Carlsbad
already spoke to you about it this morning,
but in case anybody
missed it or uh left the room
for a second, the gist of
it is taking the um
hiring kind of the most
effective and credible teachers
you have in a district to
become kind of a team
leader and they
are working with
mentoring coaching, providing
small group instruction for a team
of teachers within their school.
So if you'll turn with me
to page
14,
you can see some charts that uh
demonstrate for you some of the
differences in growth. And this is
to be honest, very promising
from their first year of
implementation.
So you can see um
the red is Alta Vista, that's
the middle school that did not implement
opportunity culture. N
Pr Leiva in the blue is
the school that did implement opportunity
culture. That first chart
chart 12. So shows those
differences for all students
in reading and math in 6th and
7th grades, those
stars uh indicate
significantly statistically
significantly. Um
statistically significant
results. You can see
in chart 13 differences
between economically disadvantaged
students and those who are
not. Um sorry, those are
just economically disadvantaged
students in the two schools. And you can
see that the students
in the schools with opportunity
culture did have greater
growth um in
one and in reading in
sixth grade, that difference was
statistically significant.
In chart 14. We see
um even greater differences
amongst English language learner
students. And in chart
15, uh for students
with disabilities, we also
see greater growth among
students in the school
that had implemented opportunity
culture. Um
we can interpret these results
with some level level of caution.
These are small sample
groups and it's the first year of
implementation. However,
I'll note that on page 15, the
next page, there have been
several different studies around
the country. Some a
little bit more longitudinal that
have also found statistically
significant differences in
growth for students who have
participated in schools that have
implemented opportunity
culture.
Um We
did come up with a cost estimate
for what it would be for
the state to pilot
something. Um
maybe not statewide, but half
the state, um half the
state's districts over three
years and
we do have a cost estimate
on that on
page 16.
And we're looking
at $48
million over
those three years to
provide those team leads
a $12,000
annual stipend. That's
really important, an important
component of this model because
it provides
um it provides a way
for teachers who have been in the classroom
for a while and are maybe
looking to do something different, but they
don't want to go into administration,
they're very skilled
teachers and we want to keep
them uh in classrooms,
but we want to expand their influence,
but we want to give them a way to do
something different and professionally
advanced and we want to compensate them
for it. Um That would be
one of the key components of this
model. Opportunity.
Culture provides uh
as the organization
provides different implementation
supports and guidance for
districts and that can
cost, uh, cost
different amounts depending on how
much support you contract with them.
But for this level
of implementation, for half the
districts in the state over three
years, um, the state will be
looking at 16 to
$35.8
million for that level
of support.
And with that all turned over to
Sunny to talk about professional
work time.
>> Thank you, Annie Sonny.
You're in again,
I'm gonna talk about everybody's
favorite subject, which is
time.
All of this does
take time to
implement. Um And there's,
there's been a lot of
research about the use
of, of time and the quality
and the quantity of it.
I think what's often
sort of tricky is
understanding,
you know, when we provide additional
time for educators
to work professionally and develop
together, it's very, it's a
very mixed bag depending on how
that time is used. As you'll see
on page 17,
you could have very
high
performance and outcomes.
If you give very targeted
direct professional
development on say
how to use your data and
how to change
your practice and response to that
data, you
can have absolutely no
impact just by having
a one day conference or
just this drive by sort
of professional learning.
And so how that time is used
is actually very, very
important. And the
legislature in passing House
Bill 130
did provide an incentive
for that professional work
time. I think as a result
of sort of
um
implementation. You've seen
some districts really dive into
adding that time for their educators,
while some have cut
back on that professional
work time and looking at
those challenges, both at
a local level and how
leaders are designing
their calendars is
sort of the next step in this
process. I think
understanding how that time
is used, particularly when you
have things
like the science of reading and that
training coming from the state
as a requirement. Uh
there will be a demand
for more time for educators
to develop themselves
professionally. But we
need to make sure that you know,
we are providing the
evidence-based type of
professional development
that is actually going to produce
results for
students.
So to kind of wrap
this up and
conclude
our biggest takeaways from
this study
and analysis and discussion
of options is
that you really
can't do a silver bullet
approach.
You can't just reduce
class sizes
and assume that things will change
because
you may have to
essentially hire more people
and having 20,000
people being the absolute cream
of the crop is very challenging to
find, particularly in a small
state. You
may have
all your hopes and dreams on
teacher residency programs.
But if they just sort
of become enveloped in
the culture of schools with
real no change in the practice
of the system,
you're kind of spinning your wheels
there, you could just increase
pay for teachers, but that doesn't
change how they practice
or teach
tomorrow. So you
really have to look at all of these
supports,
strategically in
conjunction
and all together.
Um These innovative staffing
models would
do well. But as
you did with the level
12 and three license
structure several
decades ago,
that level three was intended to
be something like an MC
O, but that is not what we're
seeing systematically implemented
today. So
I would caution that
we think
about approaching this
slow and
intentionally
and look at how the
results are playing out before
rushing in to establish
something that doesn't
necessarily
reach the outcome that the legislature
intends. So
as some of our policy
considerations,
thinking about how these strategies
all connect to each other,
you know, we've really done the
preparation piece, we've done the
recruitment piece.
How do we build out that system
within schools and within,
you know, teacher pathways as they
start day one
and what they do when they are 15
years into the profession.
Um Looking
at page 18 through
19, we have a long
list of
recommendations. One
of them is actually making sure
that pe D and
the state has a
assessment system
that provides data in a
frequently enough manner that teachers
can use that data
to inform their instruction.
Uh We're still trying to
build out that sort cycle
assessment in a
robust ways. And as you heard
from any of the data sometimes is
very inconsistent
and that tells us that people are not
monitoring it.
So how do we use the information
first? How do we build in some
accountability to ensure
that that's being used?
And then also providing that technical
assistance. Maybe you do want smaller
class sizes for
first year teachers, maybe
you do want smaller class sizes
for your most at risk
groups, thinking
more targeted rather than
blanket approach
on, on
policy in this
area. And
finally, like leveraging a lot of
resources, there's
federal money for teacher
apprenticeships.
It's very similar to teacher
residency. You know, we should be
taking advantage of all these
opportunities that
are coming from outside the state
as well.
And with that, I think
we'll conclude our report
here and turn over to
secretary for his presentation.
>> Thank >> you so >> much.
Thank you. So. All right,
good morning,
secretary. Good to see
you and you are next
here to speak. So we will
listen. >> Thank you.
Good morning madam, chair
members of the committee uh
first to start off just a few.
Thank you. Thank
you to this committee for your
support in the last legislative
session. Uh We were
able to work very, very well
together to be able to uh
improve outcomes for
students across New Mexico.
Thank you to my peers, to the left
or of course, LFC les
C uh for really
continuing to work with
us. Thank you
for the opportunity to be able to speak today
about some of these important
topics. Uh We know that
uh the key to improving uh
students is are
improving those student outcomes.
I also want to thank the legislator
for legislature for
investing over $980
million into education
compensation since
2019. Uh
This really does support
uh us to be able to retain
and recruit teachers
and we have seen a positive impact
with that. But in addition
to salary, it's important to
address the issues inside and
outside the classroom that
affect educator
uh uh affect
educators and their institutional
instructional practices.
I'd like to talk a little bit about
class size. Uh Both
my peers are to the left. They, they, they
did a very good job about
talking about some of the points. I'm gonna
reiterate here in just a moment
but how that we can continue to
support educators
and their instruction as well
as uh insurance and
unit value. We'll have a little bit of a discussion
around that.
So our my next slide there
under class size,
we know that both students
and teachers perform
better in smaller class sizes
for several reasons. The
workload is smaller and students
have more one on one time with
their teachers. This is
especially important
for students who need the most
support.
An issue that we run into though
is the cost and
feasibility. Given
the current number of teachers and available
classrooms, the average
cost to build a new
classroom is at least
$600,000 per
classroom depending on the
grade. So it's
important for us to explore
exactly how big of an issue this
is and consider a
phase in approach such
as establishing a cap
um one grade level
of over the next six
years.
My next slide educators
uh supporting educators
and and and
instruction.
The educator quality
division at PED is leading
the work on, on providing
high quality clinical
experiences for
Preser teachers and
administrators to provide real
wor world learning
and develop competencies
to support strong
mentorship. So
some of those that I I've been able to talk
with you about in the past.
And uh Sonny did get to mention
these is we do have
our Preser teacher
programs across New Mexico
that we are seeing some really
positive successful
results over the last couple
of years, first is paid
student teaching when I did
my student teaching almost
30 years ago. Uh It
was difficult because it
was a semester long.
I couldn't have another job.
And so that was really your job.
And so this is sometimes a
barrier for
people getting into the profession is
because they need to still be able to
provide for their family. This
has been incredibly
impactful to be able to
provide paid student
teaching so that they can
finish that opportunity
uh without those additional
barriers, uh I've been able
to talk with our uh
uh universities across New Mexico.
And we continue to see a
positive outcomes because a paid
paid student teacher. So thank you for
that. We've got our New Mexico
teacher residencies. This
is so impactful because
we have to, we have a
longer term
opportunity for those
Preser teachers to be in
classrooms, to be able to work with
master teachers and make sure
that they are much more
prepared for the
classroom when they take over
again. When I go back to my student
teaching, uh I did
have uh not
as much time in retrospect
as I wish I could have in the
classroom. And it actually
took me some time once I got my
own classroom to work
with my peer teachers around me to
get better as a teacher. And that
happened, but it happened over
time. Our goal is to make sure
that we are preparing,
our teachers are in
Preser programs to
the maximum extent
you've got principal resid
residency programs.
I went through the same thing as being a
principal. You start off
being very green and working
with peers to be able to
um really get better at your
craft. This opportunity
allows those that are
wanting to get into administrative
leadership programs to
be able to have more time working with
mentors so that they are better prepared
when they take over their own
schools.
Sonny mentioned the Educator fellows
program. This has been I I
believe wildly successful board
continue to monitor this where we
have dozens of teachers
are or Preser
teachers and fellows programs
already graduating are
now taking over their own
classrooms. This has been
very successful
and we're looking forward to
uh continued uh positive
outcomes for that
with respect to how we support
early uh career teachers.
First year teachers are eligible
to apply for teacher development
programs. Of course,
this does not replace district
required mentorships
and a couple of programs to highlight
are Lyft and launch.
We have numerous programs to
continue to support a
wide range of positions
within public schools. Lyft
is a one year program
for teachers with 1 to 5
years experience. Uh
and we serve over
a 100 teachers with over
50 performance coaches.
So we're able to link up these
uh more green teachers
in years, one through five
with very established
mentorships that happen throughout
the entire year. This
is proven to be able to be very
successful to better,
better, have better outcomes for those
teachers and retain those
teachers. We also have a
program called launch.
Launch is a one year program for
teachers wishing to learn
more and set themselves
up for a leadership role. We
are continuing to work towards
making sure that these teachers become
better, become master
teachers. And then, and then there
is an issue with me making sure
that we have uh
people that are able to take over
principal ship roles throughout throughout
the entire state of New Mexico.
This is really a pathway for them
to be able to do that.
Also, we have programs that highlight
our through our priority schools
bureau
uh to administer uh
support for leadership development.
The goal would be to align all
of these efforts between leadership
programs and what we do
to support the teacher
leaders. The first is
a program we call lead,
this supports principles uh
with three or few, three
or fewer years of experience
with leadership development over the course
of the year. What's amazing
about this program? And I actually went to
these, these uh similar programs
when I first started out as
a uh new leader
as in, in a school, uh
really helps develop
a uh uh peer group where
you can network and be
able to get those ideas
uh to be able to bring into your own school
district. When I think
about uh our,
our um our
district that we're in visiting
today, our host district
Carlsbad. Um They
have some wonderful things happening
here. It is very
powerful to be able to uh
set up opportunities for them to
network with each other other
superintendents, other principals
so they can share ideas.
For example, what's happening here in
Carlsbad and bring them back
to their own school districts.
We have another program called Thrive
which supports personnel
including school leaders over the course
of two years in developing
and implementing a successful
and robust system for
observation, feedback
and coaching. This allows
our current leaders across the state of New
Mexico to be able to continue
to be uh help support
classroom teachers through coaching,
observation and
feedback. We have
another program called Rise which
leverages the expertise of New
Mexico school leaders to support
and empower principals as
they work to dramatically improve
student achievement in their schools.
This program is also two
years and we just
started uh I been
concluded our first
cohort of superintendents through the
so program, this supports
superintendents and district
leadership teams over the
course of two years. And
again, this was very uh
widely uh I I
think popular
and we got great feedback
on this because we were able to connect
uh superintendents and their
leadership teams with each other across
New Mexico so they could network
and get better at their craft and share
those ideas.
I go to the next slide entitled
summer reading program. I just want to take
a little bit of opportunity to share
some successes that we've had
very recently. And
I want to thank you for your support
in, in ensuring that we were able to
provide something pretty powerful
this summer. Uh This
was our summer reading program connected
to our uh New Mexico Literacy
Institute. Another
way in which we're supporting teachers is
is by investing
in these programs like the
summer reading program where we
have currently
9362
students across New Mexico enrolled
in this program. We
have 100 and 17
different sites uh that
uh many of those sites have already
started the program. We have a few
still rolling on into next
week. Uh With
that, uh I've talked to
you before about what this
program is gonna look like where our
goal is to be able to have
10,000 students in the
program. I do
believe that we will
get that because every day we
still have continued students
enrolling into this program
to do that. Our goal is to have
a wonderful ratio.
So that's one instructor
for every four students. Were
we able to meet that goal? Uh
which would require us to have
2500 instructors
to be able to, to, to meet
that goal. We were able
to have
2775
applicants to be able
to enroll as instructors in this
program. We couldn't even hire everybody.
So that has also been
wildly successful.
So with that, we've had 28
districts, 15 charter
schools, 15 community
partners, three colleges
and universities and seven
tribal uh entities
uh roll into this program.
Uh I'm looking forward to
once we conclude this
uh being able to share some of the results
of that. Again, we will be providing
a pre-test and a
post assessment so we
can measure what the growth is like
during this program. And then we
will be following these students over the next
three years. So we can do a more
of a long range um
uh uh data
so we can share that with
you. Uh again,
another success. And I do want
to thank our partners at
NMSA LFC
les C um
of course, uh D fa
and, and the work that we do with
NP to really
uh decrease insurance
costs for
districts across New Mexico.
It was a little scary and we, I had a lot
of conversations with superintendents
about some uh budget scares
that they had. Um this is
going to help support, that doesn't solve
everything, but it does support that.
So in March, the New Mexico Public
Schools Insurance authority announced
anticipated premium
increases of nearly
32% for
risk coverage and nearly
16% for medical
benefits. These really
originated increases
were underfunded were really
underfunded by $40
million into the SCG
which have, which would have
required school districts to absorb
the differences in dollars.
So following this announcement,
ped, uh we were able to
help organize uh some
work between D FA
NM CIA LFC staff,
les C staff to
discuss options. And it
was really a really powerful
and a positive
um conversation that we
had where we all wanted
to do something better for our
districts, classrooms across New
Mexico. In the
end, uh the final rate
increase included 10%
increases for medical,
5% increases
for dental, 3%
increases for vision and a
14.99%
increase for risk.
So this is helps
with a manageable
increase as we move
forward. I want to thank all
again, all everybody that was
involved in making this
happen.
Uh Last thing I want to be
able to share in the next slide
is uh our
increase to unit value. We're able
to roll this out on Monday.
Uh I do believe that this will
also help uh uh
support uh district
uh budgets as we move
forward. Uh Our
initial uh increase
was a 3.2%
increase. On Monday, we rolled
that out to be able to be a 5%
increase. Uh I do want to
thank everybody uh that
help uh make this happen
also. So again,
a positive support moving
forward and
my last slide is around legislative
considerations. So
again, thank you for the opportunity
to be able to talk about these
issues. Uh In
2020 the 2025
legislative session will
be administrate in, in a
60 day
session. I'd like to
take this opportunity to not only
ask for your support in these areas
that we are discussing now but
also others that help support
teachers and students.
We ask that you consider
supporting a phased in
approach for smaller class
sizes to
improve quality instruction. We
are interested in strengthening
educational leadership
programs, creating new
licenses for mentor
teachers and for
superintendents and exploring
continuing education
credits.
We would also like to uh your
support with potential legislation
around health care authority
and is looking to get a better,
a better handle on insurance and
ultimately trying to mitigate
insurance insurance
rate increases.
So while we still
have a uh many processes
to determine priorities for the upcoming
public school support
requests, I want to
bring attention to just a few
areas and I'll do this very
quickly. We
have schools across the
state that still need focused
support, schools
that really need more
intentional support
and uh schools that we
that I would like to very much uh
be able to support as
we move forward.
These ped supports
uh really work through our school
improvement and transformation
funding. This year,
our staff is working with 100
and 44 schools
that are labeled C SI and
MRI status.
This work is
federally mandated and it's
focused on a whole school uh
reform. It
includes initial site
visits to assess school
programs and structures
requirements to adopt
evidence-based programs
and ongoing monitoring
visits. So it's, it's not just a
one visit and then we're done.
It says ongoing support
and building relationships with those
schools. It also
includes intensive mentorship and
coaching for teachers and
for school leaders to identify root
causes for each school's performance
and to set improvement
goals.
The statewide math proficiency
is 24% right
now. This is why
we're choosing to strengthen math
instruction. This is
another area that we really want to
be able to focus on as we get into
this next year through
science, technology, engineering,
arts and math. This is our steam
initiatives. Uh and
we have an amazing team
at PED that wants to do
the work with the school districts.
So I would love to be able to,
I'm gonna continue to ask for your
support to continue to
be able to expand and scale
up our supports around math
and steam uh across New
Mexico. We
also know that students have better outcomes
when they, when their identities
and heritage are reflected
in the curriculum and school uh
school activities. It
is so important for
students to be able to see themselves
in the curriculum and see
themselves in their teachers across
New Mexico.
Since signing the law into 2021
the Black Education Act Bureau
has developed a three year
anti-racism course for edu
educators completing
uh nearly
nearly 6000 students have
completed this training.
They facilitate, facilitated
three annual equity conferences
that include culturally censors
of trainings for leas
and have facilitated culturally
empathy workshops
that have been attended by over
2025
edu 2500
educators across State New Mexico.
I think I can talk
to support also through the
Hispanic Education Act.
Our Hispanic Education Bureau
has coordinated curriculum
support for 41
teachers to better support
their Hispanic students across
12 school districts.
Feedback from the programs
uh the from the Hispanic
students participation in
schools and teachers and their
abilities to connect with their Hispanic
students. In this survey,
91.2%
of participating students were
inspired, were inspired to do
better in school.
And of course, in 2024
19 Pueblos and
42 school districts and
charters were awarded
grants to, to
implement the provisions
of the Indian Education
Act uh to
ensure equitable culturally
relevant learning environments,
educational opportunities
and in structural materials for native
students uh in public
schools as well as to promote
cooperation among various
stakeholders to improve
educational outcomes through uh
for native American
students. So with that,
I know I've talked about a lot, I would like
to be able to get to conversation. So
madam chair, I stand
for any questions.
>> Thank you very much for
your presentation and
again for your work, I
can't imagine the the
workload. But uh
did this nice lady want
to say something next to
you?
I forgot your name. So I'll
call you a nice lady. That's
good. But tell me your name. >> It is.
OK. Thank you. And thank you
all members of the committee, Denise
Taraz, Director of Policy and I don't
have any comments, but thank
you
>> madam chair, Denise is here to
make sure that I say everything
accurately. She's she's my
bodyguard here. >> OK.
Well, great, good job.
OK. Now we're going to go
on because we're running a
little short of time here. We're
gonna go on to Representative
Chatfield, Senator
Griggs, Representative
Dixon and then
Senator Woods and
that's what I have. Yes,
of course. And our chair,
um, small, you
want to be at the end or
no? Ok. Thank you. All
right, Representative Chatfield.
>> Thank you, madam chair,
madam chair. I,
I just had a two short
comments. Number one, I do think
teacher training is of
the utmost importance
and and that that
will be the way
that we grow.
Uh Second comment
is on page
five
cost benefit analysis
of class size
reductions.
You know, I was
one of the ones pushing
for class size reduction
last year. You all remember
this year still,
but I don't think
reducing class size by
one, this
shows reducing class size
by one that's
not even close
to what. And I don't
think it's relevant. I mean
it uh
reducing class size by
one is not the
same as reducing class size
by 10.
And uh so
just a just a observation
there when I talk
about releasing class
size, I'm talking about,
I know there's a shortage,
teacher shortage I
I saw on the news so it's got to be
true, right?
Uh
in ap s of like 200
teachers, well,
who's getting those extra
kids who's teaching
those extra kids. So
I I have heard that some of those
classes were as high as 40
even though their average here
shows much less than
that. I think
that if you reduce
a class by
10
you made, I think
that would make a difference but not by
one. Thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much
for that. Did you need a response for
that representative or
just >> madam
chair? I
don't, I would be
glad for them to respond
to me about >> that.
Ok, thank you. Can we have a
quick response to that? Thank
you, Secretary
>> madam chair
Representative Chatfield. I
agree. You know, I think
that, you
know, in, in, in
working as a principal and superintendent
for many years. Uh There
is that sweet spot of
what that means to be able to have
smaller class sizes and
sometimes, um it all
depends on how we report
too. So there
are times where class
sizes can look bigger depending
on how we actually do scheduling.
Um There are some of those issues that
happen. Um I do want to
address maybe a little bit of your comment
about uh our vacancies
across New Mexico. And
so again, if
we go to prior years, I would say that we
were always averaging about
750
vacancies across New
Mexico. We've now been able to
cut that down to under 700.
So we're, we're right around 690
as well as our averages so that we're moving
in the right direction. And I do
see, I attributed
this kind of a direct
correlation to the teacher prep programs
we have across New Mexico that we
mentioned like educator
fellows uh
like uh paid
student teaching residency
programs. And of course, also
aligning the work we're
doing in teacher prep
programs across New Mexico at the
university level, making sure
that they're much better prepared
when it comes to uh structure
literacy and every
other aspect and making sure that
they have and also the
coaching and mentorship that's happening
with them. So we're getting better
and uh continue to ask me that
question because I think we need to, to,
to lower that every single
semester.
>> So madam chair just
11 last thing
before we do uh change
the subject because I do
agree with some of these
studies that show the
most important time for
smaller class sizes when
the Children are younger,
the lower grades uh
is I believe the
time it's most important to have
a small class
size and therefore personal
attention. Thank you.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much
for that. Now, we're gonna go on
to Senator
>> Griggs.
Thank you madam chair and, and
thank you guys for the, the
presentations today.
Um I want to go to
the uh to the
LFC uh
report the hearing
brief and I want to go
to uh you know, to page
two where we
talk about the 2017
Learning Policy
Institute report
that said New Mexico
was among the highest in
the country, teacher
turnover. Uh,
has that changed
any since
then?
Good or
bad
>> matter
madam, chair Senator. That's an
excellent question. We unfortunately
do not have more recent
data. Um That's
actually one of the
main
things I think the legislature
has asked for in the past few
years is much stronger data
systems um about
teacher vacancies, staffing
in general. Um
We do not have the data to be able
to answer that question, But
if we look at the trends
on the following page on
page three chart
three, we can see
that um of the data
that we do have available,
we can see that from year over
year. It does appear that the
district stay in this sorry
teachers, staying in the same district
or school from one year
to the next does seem to be
decreasing over the past few
years >> and,
and madam chair and thank you for that. I
I was looking at that
my myself and one
of the things you go back, if you go back
up on page five, go
go right up above and
you talk about that.
Uh uh we
graduate
1150
new teachers every
year, but we lose
1500
level one
teachers. Uh
And I'm and then we talk
about, we talk about the
programs that we have in
place to
allow for
uh college graduates
to teach
in the in the school
system. And we talk
about that we've got robust
mentoring programs and,
and different things,
uh, to
evaluate the
effectiveness of those, of
those teachers
and I'd,
I'd submit to you a
little bit that it's quite, quite
possible
that the,
uh, testing
requirements that we
put on
those teachers
because I don't know where they're all trying to get
to alternative licensure.
I don't know what their goal is.
Uh, and as
we look at teachers, we
say, well, all of them have to
be uh have to
pass certain
requirements like
reading and be able to teach
reading, but not all
of your teachers, not
all of your level, one teachers
are engaged in
teaching reading
or in teaching
math. So
I, I think it would be
wise
for us to go back
and look at the
requirements or the testing
requirements that we have
that we put in place
for teachers
who say um
sign up to teach
pe
and the requirements for
pe don't
necessarily mean that you
have to be able to teach
reading and, and
writing, you have
to be able to teach other things
to your, to your students.
And I think maybe we need to
evaluate how we have that
set up
to uh to
encourage those
teachers
to stay
because uh madam
chair and, and
members,
I'm just not certain whether
or not when we look at the
data that we have,
why we're getting,
why we're driving teachers
away, whether they just found
out that they, that
teaching is not their,
uh, their
deal or
it's that we
make requirements on
them that
are, are, are maybe
unnecessary for the
teaching they intended
to do or want to do.
Uh, years
ago when I first
got in the legislature, one of the
things that I did is I carried
a bill for
adjunct teachers
and you guys mentioned a while
ago how many teachers we
continue to
uh to not
have. And at that
point in time, we had about
607 100
vacancies
statewide for
math and science.
And in Alamogordo, we have great
opportunities to
access some of the smartest
people in the
world,
but we won't do it
because we won't allow
them the ability to
teach as an
adjunct. We
make it to where they want to
teach. They're gonna have to be moving
toward a licensure.
We, the only way they can,
can actually operate in the
system is to be a, a
substitute or long
term substitute.
And I believe it is important to
consider. As you talk about
Mr Mr Secretary,
as you talk
about
um
changing
superintendent
licensure or saying
changing other
licensure,
evaluate your
programs for
both these down at the
bottom end guys, the
the level one and see how
the, how we can set
that up. But also look at
how can we maybe take
advantage of the
people that we have in
this state that
we, so we choose
not to take advantage
of,
we choose not to take
advantage of. I want to be clear
on that because it's
not that they might not want
to, it's that we don't want to let
them.
And I mean, I've sat through those
committees and I've listened to the
arguments
and I've been told how bad it
is for us to
bring in a guy that doesn't
have any pedagogy
uh
understanding.
I, you know, I, I
get it, I think,
but some of the best teachers I had
in college were
adjunct teachers.
They weren't ever trained to
be teachers, but they
had the subject matter knowledge
that they could really communicate
to me. So it's a little
harder when it's little guys
or, or, or
middle school and high school
maybe. But
I think if we're
ever gonna close that 700
gap, we have to figure
out a way to do it and
we're not getting there right
now and I'd encourage
all my colleagues to
figure out how to do that
because that number
hasn't changed
in 10 years.
We're not closing that
gap. We're not
doing what we need to do for
those students
and making them
continually have
to have adjunct
or not adjunct but have long
term subs
in their classroom
and hope that they
deliver what those
kids need.
Delivered.
Madam chair. I just hope there's a
way I don't know
whether as I,
as the bill that I proposed,
I don't know that that was the right
answer, but I
certainly hope there is one
and I do want you to know that that
particular bill was
supported. The last one I
ran was supported
by NE A,
not by the A FT but
by the NE A.
So I recognize some of the
problems I
have, you know, I got, I got beat
on the head on that bill several
times. So I'm two or three
inches shorter than I was.
But uh but y'all,
I hope that we can find an
answer because it's too important.
It's too important for our
kids all across
the state. And
that's that one. But I
think if, if we
look at our requirements for
those low level uh
teachers level
ones coming in
who have
uh don't
have any teacher training that
we've, we've allowed
to, to be in the system.
I think we, we evaluate
how we address
them that
possibly would keep more
of those and we wouldn't have as
great a turnover
at the uh at the
level one
level. Thank you, madam
chair. >> Thank
you, Senator Representative
Dixon. You are next. Thanks
for being so patient,
quiet there at the end. Calm.
Thank you. Thank >> you madam
chair. Um First,
I just want to um
note my appreciation
for the wonderful
collaboration between
LFC les C
and PE D um on
this topic. And yes,
you know, this is legislative
finance and, and we have
LFC LES
C as well. Um But I
do think it's extremely
helpful for those of
us who are not on education
committees um to
hear some of these
presentations and the flow
of presentations this morning
I think has been very valuable.
Um So I just wanna
um acknowledge that as well.
Um
First um
secretary, thank you so much
for including the update on the
summer literacy program.
Um I'd like to ask
um uh director
Sali if it's possible for
us to have an update
in August
um or at
the very latest
on how everything has gone
with the summer uh literacy
program, including the number of
students that uh completed
the entire duration and
things like that so that we're
well prepared
um to make additional
funding decisions
headed into next
year.
Um
I also wanted
to highlight
um
let's see in my notes here
um for
the uh
educator Fellowship,
this has been an area,
you know, of course, Sunny
is always responding
to my emails about
this. Um
But um
Golden Apple,
um I have always been very
impressed with the work that they've
done and I'm
concerned my
understanding is that they were
not um
provided with sufficient
funding this year. And I just want to
see if I can get
an update on that and
what we can do to make sure
that they are fully
able to provide
services. Uh to
everyone um who
is looking to
have access to that
training.
>> Uh Madam chair representative,
uh again, absolutely.
We have some wonderful uh
uh teacher preparation
programs, educator fellows being one
of those uh paid student
teaching residency programs. And
you mentioned ums
support with
other um uh
partners like Golden
Apple. Uh when
and so, II, I
agree uh Golden Apple
can provide some wonderful
supports. Uh that is
an outside uh outside
partner. And so when we
go through those types of processes,
it, it is an RFP process
that goes through. So, um just
like everyone else, they have to be able
to, um, you know, meet the
requirements of RP.
And then of course, there's competition for what
that RP is. Um
But I'd love to be able to work with you
more on, you know, how we can,
you know, have all of our partners in there because
I think the more uh opportunities
that we have, the more pathways we have,
then we're able to very be very
um specific with different, uh
you know, individual teachers, educators
and students. So, um I'm
all for that.
>> Great. Thank you
so much. Um Thank you madam
chair. Those are my questions.
>> Thank you. All righty. We're
gonna go on to Senator Woods
quietly back here
too.
>> Thank you madam
chair.
Um Some
reading program. I'm glad
that you got your numbers up
on that. I was really
concerned you wouldn't get that
done. So, Thank you
for that. Uh
I want to know the
magic wand on
this
31.86%
risk management coming at
15.53.
Uh you reduced one by
half and one by a
third.
Um
Was the superintendent
of insurance in on any of
this? Exactly.
How was this done? Was at a
bar? How
did that happen?
>> Uh Madam chair
Senator, I
might turn this over to,
to director salit to answer this. I think
you are much better at answering the
technical questions around this.
I just want to say that this was
absolutely a partnership to be
able to make this happen. It
doesn't necessarily alleviate
the increased costs, but
we were able to come to a a process
in which it's much more manageable
for districts to be able to absorb this.
But Director
Shali,
>> so madam chair
Senator
the P SI A
proposed the
initial round of increases
for next fiscal year
at those uh much higher
amounts uh in
part to build up their fund
balance. Uh Those
were not part of House
Bill two budget
assumptions.
And so we collectively work
together with PE D
and P SI A to come to
a much more reasonable increase.
They do need to go up because
costs are going up and
P SI A revised
their proposed increases
to uh the amounts
that you see. There's not quite
as much as, as what they
originally proposed.
We'll have to look at, uh, where
they're at during the session
to see if they do need
an infusion of,
of cash. Uh In
particular, their
liability program
has been hit with
um big
claims for
like a bunch of hail
damage as an example in
Eastern New Mexico, the kind of
extraordinary unforeseen
things. Um and health
care has been hit. They've
got about $40 million
still of, of COVID
cost for health
care that they're, we're
proposing to pass on to
educators. That may be something
that the full legislature wants
to, to not pass on
and in fact use other
funding sources during the session.
So I've committed to work with
them to revisit
what they might need
to have a more
stable and
predictable increase
in insurance rather than these
30 15%
increases that they were
proposing.
>> I assume that's what
happened. We just had a
magic wand that just went out
there and says, poof, it's gone,
we'll deal with it
later. And
essentially, that's, that's
what I assume you told
me and I
understand you're saying
that we will deal
with it at the next
budget year instead of actually
taking a bar and
trying to do anything
today. We're just gonna
say
we'll take a chance that the
reserves are good enough
and we're not gonna have any more
storms and,
and, and cause
any more disruptions
or have
another
huge health
problem like we did with
the COVID.
Uh
I understand what you did
but
it's funny
we spend all this time on
education.
All the educators are
here.
Think about it now while you're
here, you're
teaching math.
This is a math
problem.
This is a math
problem
and I know that we're pushing it
down the road and, and gonna
take care of the math problem
in the budget. This next
go around essentially
what we're saying.
But the reason costs
go up,
it is due to risk
that we're trying to
offset
and keep it off the back of
these superintendents
because they've got a
fixed budget
and we're trying to, you
know, and many of them I
think have already turned their budget
in on
top of all that. So how
do you, how do
you
adjust budgets? It's already
been turned in. But
I understand it all. I just
wanted to make, make
note
that this is
pushing ahead. This,
I've had people ask
me in the past
on why can't
we have input to the
budget?
Why can't we
bring a bill in
the legislature and get
a hearing at the budget
committee and get it financed?
Here's one
reason
this says so much of the
budget is spent on
this.
This is dictation.
They're so you
know,
read between the lines
here, understand
what's happening in your budget.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you Charles.
>> Thank you very much
for that. And
now we've got Chairman
Small. Thank you
chairman. >> Thank you very much
madam chair. Thank you to the
presenters. Thank you, secretary
and your team, madam,
chair
secretary.
I guess I'll briefly pick
up. I, I want to
really share a, a big
thank you to you and your team
director Sali and the
LFC. Uh And
in addition, the LES
C the
two funding issues,
one directly
sort of under your control,
which is the school unit
value. The P
si A insurance
issue governed by
an independent board, but where
we all had significant
uh input,
those are going to save.
Um you know, I think
millions of dollars
across the state,
important dollars that
will stay in the pockets
of teachers and of
educators and their families
all across the state.
Um And it was
done, I think in large part
uh based
upon um
a lot of early
communication, a
good deal of trust
and sort of a together
sense of where we're trying to get to.
Would that be your sense?
Mr Secretary
>> uh madam chair
chairman Small. Yeah,
absolutely. Yes. Uh
some wonderful communication.
We started to have these conversations
early on and absolutely
some trust about how we are going to move
together to support each other as we
move into the 60 day
session. >> That's great.
Uh Thank you for that.
I can recall with uh
on the insurance
issue uh the
school budget convening, which
you all convened uh
there uh not too
long after the session, which really
appreciate knowing
that there would be a lot of
uh you know, uh
pointed and at
times very tough
uh feedback that, that you
all would be receiving
at that budget convening,
we were able to share based
upon the advice of director Sali
and Mr Lou and others
that the the
insurance increase need
not be as
high as it was
earlier proposed.
And that we should fairly
consider other
ways to make sure that this
system is solvent. And I note
that one of those is
here in your legislative
considerations, which is to
really look at how the
health care authority can continue
to manage uh
and uh sort
of lower,
at least the trend for health
care increases. So a
big thank you there
madam chair Mr
Secretary on the area
directly under your control,
which is the
uh the unit value.
Um
Can you explain just a little
bit about why doing
that unit value increase
and announcing that uh
on an earlier time
frame, how important that is
for districts as they consider
decisions moving into the
fall,
>> madam, chair Chairman Small.
Absolutely. It is very
important to be able to
support schools as much as
possible as they're moving
forward. And we got to hear the superintendents
this morning talking about some
wonderful initiatives and much of that is
paid to the increases in
se uh as
we get into this year,
we, we have a process
and we provide a initial
unit value and that usually happens
close to after the end of the
session. So around
March, April and then,
and then we have until January
30th of that next
year to be able to do the final unit
value. Now, typically,
what happens is that you have
somewhat of a conservative
initial unit value because there's some
factors that are
unknown at the time. And one of the biggest
ones is enrollment.
And as you heard Sonny talk earlier,
we do see a decline in
enrollment um across the state
of New Mexico. So we have to be
able to uh
account for that as
best we can. The
thing I would never want to do
if at all possible is put out a
unit value. And then when we
get to the final unit value actually have
to lower that unit value
that can be very
harmful or hurtful on a
district. But it is important
to get as accurate as possible because
this is when superintendents
are making decisions about
hiring, about how many teachers
they have about program
being able to support some of the wonderful
things that you've seen from the
superintendents this morning.
So again, I was very
uh very excited that uh
again, through
a wonderful
conversations about how
we can move forward to maximize
that. Um As
so this last Monday,
we were able to up that to the
5%. But I will tell
you, it's, I, I have a little
bit of worry about that because
we won't know that
impact on
um on, on
staffing, but also
enrollment until the
40th day of school.
So, uh but again,
because of the conversations we've
had because of the trust and
we want to all move forward together,
we will be able to
um to, to do that work
together. So if we get to
the to the point where
um we were right on with
5% and wonderful, if
it gets to the point where we actually
can move it up even to the
5.1% great,
or if we, if we have
those uh um
a little bit of a concern
about not having enough in
there because of enrollment issues,
then I do know that we will continue
to have those conversations about how we can
address that together.
>> Madam chair Mr Secretary.
Thank you that
really uh
music to I think our
ears again, that's
helping districts right
now. It's showing
the strong collaboration which
we see is as
Representative Dixon noted in
the, in the joint
report. Uh and I note
again, the joint Les
CLFC meeting that's coming
up later this year,
we know
that there are really
daunting challenges. I
think we feel like we're tackling
many of those
uh to be able to
be in sort of regular
communication and
to adjust and on
the front end. And I want to thank you
secretary particularly with the unit
value. Uh It was
something where there could have been a different
approach that was
much more wait and
see. And that would
have um you
know, been the safest
but not been
nearly as helpful for
districts all across the state
and, and want to thank
you there. The
last part madam chair, this comes
to a question, you
know, enrollment is
certainly as
we've heard, continually
sort of declining
enrollment, uh different
reasons, population
and demographics, one of
those charter schools,
obviously another,
um
when we think about lower
class sizes,
uh and the
information that we just
got, which is sort of
imperfect but seems
like a decent
snapshot.
Do you have a sense
yet of what that sort
of lower class
size phasing
looks like? Or is it just
more at this point
sort of a
decision that, hey,
at the end of the day, lower
class sizes are better,
this is sort of a direction
we wanna go with detail
to follow.
>> Uh madam chair, Chairman
Small. Um I,
I believe that right now
today, uh there
are many ways we
could tackle that this issue.
And um and so I again,
I think this will be ongoing conversations
how to do that. I think my
biggest uh piece of
feedback for right now is that we
phase it in slowly
because there's many aspects to this. So
one what,
what does that mean to where do we want?
What is global class
size mean? That might be the first
definition. The next
definition is, do we have space
across with
just square footage to be able to make that
happen? And then the other is it's
going to increase our staffing requirements.
And so how do we kind of
massage all those conversations
together? I do believe
there is a path forward and I think
together just like we, we were able
to do with SG we'll continue
to have those conversations about how we can
phase that in over time.
>> Got it. Thank you very
much, Mr Secretary.
My questions. Thank you
very much to our analyst. Again,
it's really positive to see
C and LES C
collaborating on
work product for the committee
makes me really excited as
we go forward into the
remainder of the summer.
Thank you, Mr Madam
chair. Thank you very much.
>> Yes. Thank you Mr Chair.
All right. We're going to go on to
Representative Herrera and then we
have Representative
Garrett and
those are the two that I have
left. Thank you.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank
you so much, uh secretary
and uh and all of
the panel for your excellent work.
It's, it's deeply appreciated.
Uh I guess,
you know, I, I was the one who
introduced and
um uh and
the house passed the memorial
calling for the study
of the SCG.
So we did that two
years ago and we're just,
hopefully we'll be getting,
we're beginning to get the
results on that and hopefully
we'll have the legislation for
the 60 day session and have
it well in time to really,
really examine that
closely so that we can
really understand the
impact and help
schools and, and help the state in
general have a better
formula.
Um, I,
I'm curious,
um, uh,
secretary, how
many school districts in New
Mexico do we
have that are elected by the,
I don't know how to say that
the, the general
population, like I see all
the superintendents here
pretty much have a school
board and it's a general
election. It's not that we don't
have charter schools. How many school
districts do we have? Like
that
>> madam, chair representative?
I want to make sure I understand your question
correctly. Is the question
about how we hire
superintendents? >> No, no. The
question is, how many school districts
do we have that aren't,
aren't charter school districts.
>> Ok. We have 8989
school districts and we have a little
over 100 charters across New
Mexico. >> Thank you. Thank
you for that. And in
those 89 school
districts, how many of those
superintendents
are new?
Like within a year
of being hired,
>> madam chair
representative,
I don't have the exact off top of
my head about how many are in their first
year. Uh But I do have
some generally speaking to
answer that question. We
have a vast majority of our
superintendents that have three or less
years worth of, of
experience. Um
And so I would, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna estimate that being
around 6065 of the
superintendents that are new to their school
districts. Um So this
is an issue also is being able
to retain those
superintendents for their expertise.
When we see the examples of the
superintendents in behind me,
they've been in the position in
their districts for a number of years now. And
this has a massive positive
effect on the work
that they're doing and, and the
outcomes for students. So, one
of my goals and I know that's one of
all of our goals is to make sure that we
can have long-lasting superintendents
in their positions
>> and um
madam chair and
at I would like to say
that's the elephant in the room.
Um We
did pass legislation
so new school boards that were
elected couldn't come in and fire
the superintendent that day,
they will have a kind
of a, a period
that they'll have to stay in three
or four months. So they understand
at least the budget process before
they eliminate the new
person or they,
or they keep a, a
superintendent
on for another five years under
contract which only
eliminates the money that
and this happens, can happen
in small districts can happen
in big ones. But it's, it's a
problem. So we,
we have tried to eliminate
that problem too with legislation
that was signed by the governor last
year.
Um
I would, I
guess,
and I was gonna say the
same thing, I'm sure sure that
Superintendent Washburn didn't
come in the first year and start the
opportunity culture.
You need to have
some time and you need
to have trust in the community, you
need to build those relationships.
So, so I
really, I really
think when
we talk, I also want to say
when you talk about class
size, if
we don't, if we don't have enough
teachers now for our class
sizes, if we're 706
100 something short
now, and if we,
if we have smaller class size,
we still don't have the, the
personnel who could handle the
class size. I think we
would all like that. But, you know,
you have to build a
foundation before we can
build the rest of the house. So I
think, I think we have to be very
careful about class size
because I really think
that's a local
control superintendent
decision because you could,
you could ask 1/5 grade
teacher, 20 year
veteran grade teacher
to take a $10,000
raise and maybe take 20
seven kids
versus a brand new
teacher who's,
you know, maybe, maybe
she has 12 kindergarten
boys, you know, and three
girls in a class. Yeah,
those are local decisions.
I, I really think that's really
important that we leave
that to local
superintendents as a, as
a management decision
on their part. So,
um I
guess,
I guess that's really,
really what I wanted
to say that I think we should be
careful about mandating class
size when we don't have the personnel
to cover smaller size
and really work on, on
getting more teachers
graduated into
classrooms with all these
programs that we're doing.
Uh and I'll, I'll stop
there. Thank you, madam
chair.
>> Thank you,
representative. Ok.
We're going to go on to Representative
Garrett. Thank you. >> Thank you madam
chair. One quick question.
Um I think this is
for um Secretary
Romero on legislative
considerations. Can you just
briefly say what
you're thinking of in terms of
requiring continuing
education units,
>> madam, chair representative.
Uh Great, great question. I've got
to get to talk a little bit more about this.
Uh We have uh level
12 and three teachers
when you become a level
one, you're required to
get to that level two that
requires some additional professional
development. But when you get to
level two, theoretically,
you may not have, you don't, you're not
required to do anything else after
that. Now, I I say
that I don't, that, that is not the case
typically, I mean, the the
vast majority of teachers
do professional
development constantly,
this will allow for us to be able
to really um
document some of that
professional development, make sure that it's high
quality through
and working with our universities, possibly
as a partner to create
this continuing education
credits. Um This will
just be able to tell a story of
how we are all
getting better within
our craft. Um Hopefully,
this will also allow uh
one for us to be able to move
through the licensure system. Uh
There are some conversations
about another idea
around um
providing opportunities for
master teachers and what that may look
like so that we can really help
support them as being mentors
for mentees. But this is
really a way to be able to document a
lot of the wonderful work
that is already happening, but
also put into
effect, that
encouragement that really that
process to, to continue
to, to get better, whether you are a
first five year teacher
or you're a 25 year teacher, we're
always getting
better.
>> Thank you madam chair and I'm
sure we'll have more conversations.
But thanks for the initial overview,
>> representative, I would love to get your ideas
on it.
>> Thank you, representative.
And um I think we're
done with this agenda
item. I want to thank you
and, and staff for
all the great work you're doing. And I
know you've got lots more and many
challenges. And
um as I said before, I
can't imagine the workload,
but there is a lot more to do
as we know. And one
thing that struck my mind
um immediately
was when the staff reported
that they're not getting
the consistent data
consistent is big
um reporting, you
know, for the absenteeism and
so on. And uh
not only are we not getting enough,
but the consistency is really
important. So, um
I know you mentioned how you're
improving things and I appreciate
that very much. But are you continuing
to work with uh
with the state? Have to give them
what they need to so they can bring
it to us as we get our reports
secretary >> madam
chair? Absolutely. I think
there's probably many areas
that can be improved on. I'll start
with, with the Public Education
Department. We're continuing to
improve how we
collect data, run data and be
able to provide data to every
entity. We're also working
with local school districts so that they can
improve their processes. Uh
We do have, we've implemented a
program called Nova to
really update and bring us
into uh 2024
when it comes to collecting data.
This is an implementation year. So I'll be the
first to admit that there are bumps along the
road, it's getting better as
time goes on. But many,
much of those conversations is
with the local school district. So we
can map those
uh relationships and the
conversations and how we
collect data and share data.
Uh You have heard me talk in the
past and you will
probably continue to hear me talk
in the future about have going moving
towards a single student
information system that
may I believe will
make it much more efficient
on how we collect data, how
we support data,
provide guidance and it's
going to be much easier to be able to work with
those school district to help them pull that
data. I believe it's a way to be able
to take a lot of administrative
burden off the table.
>> Ok. All
righty. Well, for the sake of time, I'm
going to leave it at that
and move on. But thank
you very much for all
that you do. And our staff, Sonny
and, and of course,
Annie and Denise, I got your
name now. So thanks
again and we're going to move on
to the next
item here and that's miscellaneous
committee business and we'll defer
to our staff.
Um So Charles,
we, we did act on the action
items yesterday >> and
that's correct and I'll just go through
these really quickly so folks can
get on the road.
But I wanted to make you aware
of a couple of things on TAB
O is our budget
status report
and we're projecting to
end the fiscal year
with the about
a half a percent surplus.
Um But
we've been able to do um
a lot of investments in
professional
development for staff
as well as staffing up the
office. Uh We're almost
fully staffed including
all the new FTE that
you gave us uh that
don't the, the funding
of which doesn't start till next
fiscal year on
Tab P the budget
adjustment
reports, it
looks like we're starting to ease
back into pre pandemic
uh level of activity
for um budget adjustments
as you see about $2
billion most of those
are going to be federal. You can see on the
next page um versus
cash balances,
the amount of money being transferred
out of the salary and benefits
category compared to the
prior couple of years is coming
down. But I would note a
couple of agencies,
one in particular is the
second d who received
a supplemental
appropriation because they
said their budget was going to be
short because of all the
hiring they're doing is asking
to, has asked to
transfer 1.5 million
out of salaries to buy other
things including
supply costs
and expanding their
office
on Tab
Q. The cash balance
report just
highlight a couple of
things for
you
on page four
of that report down towards
the bottom the patients compensation
fund on a
cash basis. This
fund is up from 100
and 96 million in May
of 23 to
279
million in May of
24. So on a
cash basis, this fund
uh is flush
on an actuarial basis
is where there's more work that
that needs to be done is what's
driving up those premium
increases that you're seeing.
Uh your doctors have to pay
for the health care
affordability fund. Uh
Just below that at 100
and 93 million.
Uh you enacted
legislation that will steer more
general fund money
from the general fund to
this patient's compensation
fund starting next year,
that fund will balloon.
We project over
$300 million
going forward. So
that may be something to look at in terms
of how we use that for
um access to high quality
health care.
On page
seven of the
report, I want to
highlight uh a growing
problem at the Children,
youth and families department and
Protective Services
uh where it shows a negative
cash position of 16.7
million. They
may end up in that program
in a deficiency situation
where they're overspending their budget.
And part of that is because they have
not been drawing down federal
funds for um
the staff in, in foster
care. Uh We'll get a
report from them within the
next week on where they're at.
Um financially with that,
they may come in for a deficiency
request. Um
At this point in time,
I would want to work with
the department to see about
getting a contractor to help them
bill for um
claims that they should have been billing
for before you give them
money to fill that
particular hole. They're
also
um
uh
they also have a bar to
increase spending and personnel
where they think they told the
sub-committee, they weren't going to be
hiring social
workers because
they weren't going to be hiring staff
yet. They submitted a bar
because they said they wanted to hire
58 people
before the close of the fiscal
year. So more work to be
done on what's going on with that
department. Uh, just
corrections department. This
is an area
where you've made an adjustment to their
operating budget on a go
forward basis. Basically, they're
over funded in the prison
system and you can kind of see
that on a cash basis. We're
growing from 59 million
last year at this time to
over 70 million.
Um,
this
time.
>> Yes, you may.
Senator,
>> we need to follow up to see
where they're at with negotiations
to help
Clayton pay off
the outstanding obligations.
You did appropriate
$34
million to
pay off the remainder of the
bonds and be able to
transfer that prison
over to the state.
I
don't have any information on the
status of that right
now on
tab R uh
agencies continue to
increase hiring.
Um
The current overall
vacancy rate is a little
less than 17%.
I will say from this discussion that
we had in schools that
700 teacher
um vacant position represents
about 3.5%
vacancy rate. Uh
Now, if you're the parents of a kid
in one of the long term
uh subs classes,
you, that's one too
many, but from a
context standpoint compared
with other agencies, that's
really low vacancy
rate. Agencies like
pe d have been,
you know, hiring quite a bit. So
they're up to 307. I
haven't seen that agency with that
many people.
Um Probably
before the great recession.
Um So you're seeing hiring
at a, at a pretty fast
uh cliff
and with that Mr
or madam chair, I'll be happy to
answer any other questions.
>> Thank you very much. Any questions
from the committee on these informational
items? All
right, you don't need a motion for that. That's
just informational. So, ok,
I think we are done,
believe it or not. I want to thank
each member of the committee
and um everyone
for participating,
helping and just doing
great work. And our staff,
Charles, our
deputies, our staff,
everyone, I just
can't tell you how much we appreciate
you. Gosh, we couldn't
do without you. Let's give you a big hand.
Thanks Charles. >> Mm.
