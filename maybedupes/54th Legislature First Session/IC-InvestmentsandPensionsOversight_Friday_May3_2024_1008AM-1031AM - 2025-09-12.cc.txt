Um state Senator Roberto Bobby
J.
Los Alamos, R River, Santa Fe

Work with nine Pueblo, You know,

Interesting where we are with
our pensions here.
And our vice
And, uh, I believe we have
Oh, very well and, uh, with
that, we'll go to our first
item, and that is the proposed
2024 interim work plan and
meetings that we have our lead
staff on
So, Mr Chair members of the
committee. My name is Christina
Vasquez and I'm, the staff
attorney for the Legislative
Counsel Service Moss Oversight
Committee before I start
presenting the work plan.
Moving on to the work plan. Um,
you will see items A and B on
the work to, um
Items are focused by the
committee.
Item a 40 funds and it will also
cover insolvency of those funds.
Item. B covers the investment in
management of funds by the P ER,
a the ER B, the retiree
Healthcare Authority, the State
Investment Council, the state
treasurer's office and other
agents.
Item. C proposes that the
committee here updates on
strategic goals and the plans of
how to reach the The P ER, a
The ER B and the retiree health.
Item. D request each agency's
transparency practices.
Item E as the committee review
the current or I guess we still
have item F. So item FG and H.
These are all kind of broad
items. They're gonna allow the
committee to address issues as
they arise during the interim.
So if something comes up that
needs review, the committee can
decide at that. OK, So now we're
at the schedule you guys will
see on the last page page three.
We have, um, the dates the IPO
meetings. This interim
Um, you'll see that the meeting
date. I have more substantive
dates listed after that.
Um, these days were scheduled by
the L CS, assistant director for
drafting services with the
attention that the scheduling
conflicts be minimized
specifically for voting members.
Um, if you have any concerns
about the dates that are on this
schedule
Please.
Thank you. Um, the first part,
um
As far as the meeting.
Uh, there's a possibility, maybe
one of the meetings that we will
let all
Members so
Um, thank you, Mr Chair I've
received, uh, a few emails and
there's two topics. Um, that I'd
like to have considered.
Uh, they fit in with the topics
that we have, but under
P ER A. I would like to open up
the topic of the colas.
Based upon these letters I
received
And the second topic actually
refers to
All of our fans.
Whether or not any setting up
any trust funds for these
Would, uh
Safeguard them.
And it's just a topic for
discussion. And I'm wondering if
we could add those two
Uh, as the staff and you
That all
I am saying, treating them
separate. I think that the colas
is a specific issue for some of
our retirees. But I also think
that trust funds could relate to
all of the funds, and we have
talked about trust funds for
water for Children for
Special Ed. We've talked about
trust funds for a variety of
things, and it might be
worthwhile to discuss whether
it's relevant to
But I members that have joined
us if you can introduce. Thank
you, Mr Chairman. It's Bill 31,
our northeast. Thank you. To
both of you, Uh, Martinez.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
Going along with what center
Stefani brought up.
I've also received
I know there are certain rule
Cola, but
I think we need to to, uh
Thank you, Mr Chair, Um, under
E. I am making an assumption
that when we review current
investment and administrative
structures that would also
Include
Reviewing the
Performance.
Of the returns on investments
certainly be interested in
seeing how their performance
lines up with maybe some
benchmarks.
Whether they're exceeding
benchmarks, whether they're
below benchmarks. What plans
they have?
To
At least
Meet benchmarks. Uh
Because I'm concerned that maybe
Some of these funds.
Getting the return funds need to
return to keep, uh keep them at
least with some of the demands
so I'd like to see some of the
Mr Chair members of the
committee and when we talk about
these, I would just like to put
a caution out there, or of how
the tax implication individuals
themselves, especially when we
talk about federal changes in
the tax code. What we've done
already, um, that even though we
increase it, it might actually
Work against them. So just
caution on that. Thank you,
mister Chair.
Uh, thank you, Mr Chairman, uh,
kind of on the cola we've
received in a lot of, um
You mean, um, when we look at if
I remember right, Um, but what?
I was started looking at is
I believe our benchmark is 2030.
It's more. Yeah, well, whatever
that benchmark is.
To see how the funds are
currently doing And whether
gonna hit that.
But then the contributions
Of each category. I mean, state
police don't need to but each
category by 2%.
And maybe three or four to see
what that would do to the
funding fund is
Like
Uh, I. I would like to see what
what that would project out.
Thank you. Oh, and Mr Chairman
that would help.
With the part about trying to
fix Thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you, Representative Ream.
Um I have been approached by,
um, the firefighters in terms of
their fun not being fully funded
and not being you know.
Um
In a I mean, it's it's many
years that it's not been in a
good place. Um, so that is one
thing, mister chair that I'd
like to look at and also the
judges cause last year. I think
there was a bill that did a
specifics are but it didn't go
through. And I think that those
are that, um you know, our our
funds are
Or solvent and then the other
thing that I wanted to mention,
and I thought, maybe, you know,
weigh in on this, but I know is
doing some work around social
and fire both and I think, um,
it's an issue. Uh, look to
supporting them. Uh, because
they're looking at I. I know a
PD or F is but I'm not sure
about the firefighters. But
these are, um
These are issues and and I bring
this up, because, um, my mother
was married to a firefighter,
and she
Seventies, the US Congress.
Um
Fire funds.
That they would they would only
receive basically about
One third of 40%.
Uh, their social security.
And if they hadn't worked that
I mean, it's Yeah, it doesn't
make sense.
But, uh, if you google windfall,
you know, IRS windfall taxes.
And so the F OS are working.
Together trying to get that.
Changed on the federal level.
And 86. Then they forced, uh
Firefighters and, uh, law
enforcement to make so so sense
that date forward, though,
received their full
Social Security for the members,
Um
I think B and PR where we are
today and as we move forward,
But you know what has brought us
to this point?
You know, you can. Uh There's
been some very different
decisions that were made by both
PR for several
Years. Their choice was to
increase to the funds.
Versus Erb.
You know their choice was to put
it in salaries.
So, uh, yeah, for the number of
years that I had a
There any more discussion? Um
so, Mister Chair, perhaps on the
whole firefighter and public
safety, Maybe we could just
document or paper that explains
so that when we go forward, and
we have
Yes.
Going back to, uh
The first original part of, uh,
Senator
To have both.
Uh, is there any other
I wish every meeting was like
this.
This. This does not pertain to
the meeting.
Do you feel that the
I. I think so. I wouldn't need
it to invest on the curve ones,
you know?
