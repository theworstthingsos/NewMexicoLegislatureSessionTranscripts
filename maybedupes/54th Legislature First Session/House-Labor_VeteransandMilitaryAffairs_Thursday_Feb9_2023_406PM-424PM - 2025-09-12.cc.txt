Representative.
Here.
The vice chair of the euro the
sentence
of tier of.
Thank you Mr chairman sure is
here so whenever you're ready
all right thank you Sir good
afternoon members we're here
today to talk about house bill
two ten and this bill is related
to public late pensions.
The the ERA and with me as.
Chairman members group.
with PED are.
With the R&B star Fund director
so this bill basically does Mr
chairman and certainly I'd like
to recognize of the five fox
your ship also that has signed
on with me and I had good
discussions within outlook the
Representative Roybal Cavalera
and senator Bobby Gonzales they
for chair and vice chair I
believe last interim of the I
talk committees so they both are
aware of this and signed on as
co sponsors.
What happened with SB seventy
two which was passed in twenty
twenty.
during the legislative session
we change the cost of living
adjustment model used by P. E.
R. A..
And then over the last three
years most retirees received a
non compounding two percent lump
sum payment which we were
calling the thirteenth chat.
Of the new poll model which will
resume compounding takes effect
this July is based off Paris
investment returns and funding
status the goal of this year
will be a half percent with the
highest inflation over the past
forty years increasing health
insurance premiums we know
that's not enough which is the
essence for this bill even with
social security the federal
government recognize that they
have to give a nine percent
increase.
But with P. E. R. A. retirees
less than one percent.
So house bill two ten would
provide for did an additional
lump sum payment to percent for
the next five years for retirees
age sixty five or older all
these retirees a qualify for the
half percent of the whole of
would still receive that
increases well.
And in additional payments with
go to approximately thirty
thousand retired members this
represents sixty seven percent
of encouraging retiree
population.
And it's an anticipated cost of
eighteen per year general fund
and ninety million over the next
five years so basically Mr
chairman what we're doing is a
continuation SB seventy two
which was passed in twenty
twenty.
Regarding of the new cough full
of model that we use I P. E. R.
A..
And again it's in response to
the fact that
way of collation this is the
fixed incomes in our state.
They need to do something about
that that like Taos I think my
picture to make any comments or
Michael Sanchez.

This chairman members Canadian

executive director of the
retired public employees in

two thousand public retirees in
New Mexico with people
throughout everyone of these
communities everyone in your
community.
the last two years especially
difficult question yeah stand in
cost of everything is going up
this is something that would be
very helpful to our members and
and what a back into the New
Mexico I the money that that
this was back in New Mexico
County well the staff over over
again of this important measure
itself is very much needed for
all all citizens especially
retirees we strongly urges for
this legislation.
The new one is amended by.
There so we have any opposition
right okay I'll go to committee
Representative Martinez Mr
chairman from members of the
committee in full disclosure I
am your a recipient.
Yes but I question.
This money comes from.
Yori General.
Resources.
They thirteen tax associate with
the from the general fund and
then the half percent of which
is the cold please Fund.
And Mr chair representative this
is already impossible to it is
not in the house bill two yet
we're working with the
committee.
At least the first year in there
which is a four point eighteen
million dollars but we have
reached out also to the
governor's office on this.
Actually some of the staff
there's helped us and in
designing what we're doing here
today so certainly we're gonna
be working with
Appropriations committee as well
as the Senate finance committee
to make sure there's general
fund and.
Mr chair Representative thank
you very much.
What else.
Mr chair
Thank you actually
Representative Martinez as my
questions is concerned about the
the funding that we make sure
hasn't come out the pair Fund
and set us back because the
twenty twenty battle over
seventy two Mr chair with hard
and of the and our retirees
filled.
Hurts and betrays because
they've got this was fixed in
two thousand thirteen.
So every time we move forward
and struck back in and do things
were causing more hurt in a row.
Mr chair and sponsor.
They are hurting them because of
inflation.
But if we don't get the money
out of the general fund.
Everybody was gonna hurt down
the road if we take it out of
her.
That's all Mr chair thank you.
Of Representative the
cystic you Mr thank you for
bringing this up because you
know I understand there's some
issues with funding but I think
this is something that.
Public.
Public education the state
should we expect private to do
this this committee so
this
legislation.
Thank you Mr chair
representative.
Also in full disclosure I am
affairs is.
Don't let me get myself into
trouble.
I just had a question
Will the implementation of this
bill Act on the pair's operating
budget all.
If we could
Mr Chairman representative
Vincent it will not since we
paid out these kinds of
thirteenth checks for the last
three years we've already built
into so there is additional
operations to okay and Mister
chair representative would you
would you explain that to that
thirteen.
Please.
Mr Chairman representative of
incentive for this part of the
twenty twenty of reform that
Representative Lundstrom
discussed the stuff the
compounding full of for a three
year period instead it gave the
two percent the cost of living
adjustment but it didn't compact
so whatever two percent of the
retirees that'll benefit we pay
that out each July in the form
of a thirteenth cheque that is
now indeed is part of that
legislation we're gonna go to
this new poll model that model
calls for half a percent
resuming compounding this year
these two percent payment would
be made on top of this social
two percent of their annual
budget okay.
Mr chair representative.
The captain Jim was talking
about in the audience would you
explain that to me.
What what we did and as we
decided that they might be here
if we focused on sixty five
years and older into instead of
Paul retirees just because
without the cost might be
It there was no other reason I
mean I just looked at
both models at sixty five or
sixty seven.
Sixty five tied for neatly and
what's happening with social
security which is the reason I
picked that number.
But I I do know as the gentleman
had mentioned some of the
younger retirees are also.
having having trouble because of
inflation.
Thank you Mr chairman I'll
also like to say full disclosure
I am also if people
target.
I'm not sixty five so it would
not affect me.
Thirty nine.
And if we could he wants to add
to that.
Mr chairman and members of the
way the bill is structured if
you're sixty three to sixty four
today and this actually goes for
one for a fight period you will
get your turn sixty five well so
so it's not just those sixty
five and older today it is a
graduate.
Thank you Mr chair
representative.
But
we have thanks to.
Let's.
thank you Mr chair and thank you
Representative.
I'm happy to.
This
It's particularly important to
me and I
stressed over the statements and
and.
And I hope we answer the
question for how many.
Reference to how it affects the
sixty two sixty three and and
on.
We're I particularly concerned
because I have a large
constituency that are
for some reason I have a lot of
public employees retirees and
district in the bordering
districts in Albuquerque that Mr
those very well the area and
region that I represent they've
been very Mr chair and
Representative they've been very
vocal.
Throughout the years in question
are reforms and improvements
with the terraces them side I
just want to say we appreciate
it we're hearing at.
Particular I'm supporting this
bill because of the effect that
has on on the terraces
sixty five and older are those
that are in.
because I am hearing the
hardships they are all public
employees because that career in
service yet they're finding
themselves in in the low income
category.
And that low income category due
to inflation is causing them to
seek.
The public subsidies that they
had not anticipated four.
It's shameful to me the thing to
do so all Mr chair
Representative and thank you
Representative seeing off always
previous to the point that can.
Which is actually
Committee Mr Jaitley on that
because you actually are
budgeting.
The dissipation one of the few
departments said budget.
or.
Budgets in place and in in the
line item that prepares us for
whatever may happen in the
future talks are employees
selected want to say that say
that as well so I really don't
have any questions that I am I
am very concerned about that
population because that senior
population are actually on
facing.
Security.
They're facing rent and holes in
security.
Possible foreclosures cases I
hear those stories all the time.
Or thank god for families
because they're moving in with
our families with other family
members so I just Mr chair just
strongly urge the committee to
pass this piece of legislation
and trust that we can handle
through the Appropriations
Committee process that's all we
can do
and send a strong message to
them about the.
All right.
Care of this population thank
you.
This effective are it.
Legislature to.
It doesn't.
I don't want to raise a lot
of or something that
might give me a pay raise yes I
am sixty five and the.
Go to the committee for a motion
make a motion to pass.
Through the
gate I have a motion after
motion proper second go ahead
any opposition to this motion.
The show all members present
voting.
Thank you let your provisions.
Committee.
