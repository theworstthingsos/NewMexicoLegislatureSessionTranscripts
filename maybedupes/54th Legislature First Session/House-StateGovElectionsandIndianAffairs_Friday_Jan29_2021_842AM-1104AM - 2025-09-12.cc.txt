First of all
we went to the US the the US.
that's the all The New Mexican
Spanish greeting for the morning
which literally means may god
grant you a good morning.
And the house bill one twenty
four.
We'll create a privacy policy
for all state agencies.
Madam
In the house bill one twenty
four reads that
okay
officer or employee in this
close.
What information acquired by
virtue of his this.
Within the state agency to
anyone outside of that state
agencies.
Madam chair house bill one
twenty four would require.
The employees.
And the sensitive.
Information require their
doctors.
But will provide limited
exceptions for sharing.
And madam chair sensitive
personal information.
This of this legislation is
defined as.
A social a social security
number.
And individual taxpayer
identification number known as
the nineteen.
Which is the instrument that
undocumented workers in our
country use to file their
federal income tax.
I'm so sensitive personal
information is defined as a
person's status as a recipient
of public assistance for as a
crime victim.
Sensitive personal information
is defined as a person's sexual
orientation.
Gender identity.
Immigration status national
origin or religion.
One twenty four provides for
limited exceptions for sharing
of this private information as
in the case.
When disclosure is necessary
very out the function of the
state agency.
In the case to comply with an
order from the state or federal
court.
In the case.
As required by our it brought
at.
In the case where the
information is disclosed with
the written consent of the
person.
In the case when such disclosure
is made or by a court in the
course of a potential receiving
or maybe in a court record.
And madam chair members house
bill one twenty four is much
needed because many state
agencies function properly.
They need to consider for
information for New Mexicans.
When you Mexican provide this
information is they have a
reasonable thank you.
This information will remain.
I'd.
Policy.
Right.
Before hello but the point is.
I'm bringing on what loan for as
witnesses and with that madam
chair I yield to my to
Incredibly knowledgeable expert
witnesses
to kind of a and to the
significance of this
legislation.
Great thank you representative
welcome.
Everyone go ahead if you like to
add anything more.
Good morning madam chair members
of the committee my name is
Gabrielle a long is because
money I and the staff to Ernie
it's almost what loan you don't
a twenty year old statewide
civil and worker's rights
organization.
So by amending the governmental
conduct act it will further lay
out how New Mexicans personal
sensitive information is to be
handled this bill aims to
provide clarity to state
employees on how to handle New
Mexicans sensitive personal
information and by amending the
governmental conduct act one and
one of the main statutes that
dictates the comportment of
state employees there will be
clarity in terms of how we
handle New Mexicans personal
sensitive information along with
providing a uniform policy for
state employees and state
employees across the state by
adopting this policy New
Mexicans will feel secure and
accessing health and public
safety services including
emergency or disaster relief
services
Something in that on the chair.
Maybe a blanket.
Representative somewhere we can
hear you.
Great thank you.
Thank you sorry about that no
worries thank you madam chair so
by adopting this policy New
Mexicans will feel secure and
accessing health care public
safety services specifically
emergency services disaster
relief services which are
critical right now during the
pandemic if we are to again then
the curve in terms of COVID
nineteen transmission
our goal is not to come up the
works of state agencies we
understand there needs to be a
flow of exchange of information
between agencies and there are
number of exceptions that
Representative Representative
Garcia laid out including if for
a.
Court issued subpoena and if
that is the function of that
state agency
and with that madam chair I
don't know if his deals wants to
add anything further.
All right then madam chair thank
you madam chair members of the
committee much some of the S.
the director so motion with no
need all we've been on a
statewide immigrant based civil
and worker's rights organization
for gosh twenty six years now
and thank you for for having us
here in providing that
consecutive interpretation that
will occur with some of the
testimony later on I just want
to add that there are several
cities and counties in the state
in the state of New Mexico as
well as around the country that
have similar of nondisclosure
policies on the books
Albuquerque tell Santa Fe Los
crucis and and as well as
counties that really recognize
the need to create a sort of a
broader protection for sensitive
personal information because we
also have to share a lot of that
information with our local
governments are the only other
thing that I would add is that
we as an organizational long
with a lot of our community
based and immigrants rights
partners throughout the state
we've been working very closely
with the state government and
the administration to narrow the
information gap between.
The Spanish speaking immigrants
Latino immigrants low wage
workers and the state government
local government when it comes
to all things COVID in the last
year so we've worked on you know
setting up testing events of
targeting and specifically for
Spanish speaking immigrants of
factsheets Facebook lives with
folks from the state government
to provide timely and important
information to our community
about testing about information
about economic relief programs
and despite our best efforts
which I think it worked out
really well in the last ten
months we still here on the
grounds that there is fear that
there is a lot of distrust when
it comes to providing sensitive
personal information to agencies
because people are just not
clear whether or not that
information will be turned over
to outside agencies and can lead
to have worse
adverse consequences and in the
case of some of the folks that
would be testifying today on
some of those at risk
consequences lead to deportation
and separation of families and
so these are some of the things
that we're trying to continue to
mitigate with our uniform policy
across the whole state.
Thank you madam chair.
Right thanks to you both thank
you madam chair and with that we
stand for questions.
Right thank you Representative I
am now going to attempt to do
all but if I can't get up and

Okay good morning madam it chair
and members of the committee my
name is Dennis but last year's I
love the Farmington since I was
touring with my parents and my
sisters I recently graduated
from Simpson college.
With a degree in substance
abuse.
I am a member of some section
I personally inspected by the
current system my personal
information specifically my
immigration status was shared by
the probation office in
Farmington was ice and because
of this I'm currently fighting
off to partition unfortunately
there are many stories like mine
in this.
Tension when ice agent has been
ciation for nine years.
Because of my experience and
many others in my community our
families hesitate to access
health services.
For them or their children.
Or to fully participate in
community safety opposed public
health efforts it makes me an
easy December present
information when accessing
services stories like mine
spread like wildfire in a small
community and it sends it and
dangerous message to my family's
and my community.
be careful when accessing any
government agency creates
isolation.
Adopting a nondisclosure policy
from a state.
agency does several things this
is a crucial message to on the
Mexicans like me so immigrant
families can fully participate
in efforts to fight off the
current pandemic like signing up
for testing and registry and
receiving the vaccine.
Restores trust between my family
in these agencies ensuring all
state services are fully
accessible accessible I'm sorry
for everyone who needs it and is
that so far for other non state
agencies to follow I urge you to
support.
The bill thank you so much.

it's in this that.
In the program.
If ever some people are calling
from laptops or computer devices

microphones picked up.
So that might be an issue.
Fifty in the US grow for
nineteen if they discuss them on
the.
Right now she's connecting to
audio the yes yes.
Representative SS.

Bill Jordan you are now unmuted.
Good morning madam chair and
members of the committee Bill
Jordan representing a New Mexico
voices for children.
I am also the convener of the
New Mexico Medicaid coalition
and I would like to say that one
of the challenges that we have
faced for years in getting
eligible children enrolled in
Medicaid is that their parents
are afraid that their
immigration status or other
sensitive information will be
revealed even though their
children are eligible for health
care through the Medicaid
program.
If we want to open up our
schools if we want to get this
pandemic under control if we
want all of our kids and
families to be healthy passing
this legislation isn't
absolutely essential part of
this public health effort thank
you.
Thank you Mr Jordan we are now

the other a yes so yeah keep it
up and use up or you'll end up
in a place that they lay act AC
and billing what the today I'm
here to ask you for the support
of the H. B. bill help us bill
one twenty four and also I do
that I'm not been everyone's
been four months you'll be by
the Civil to.
Which will help us maintain our
confidential information safe
that's second best source Ananya
seven most of them also said
most last where once you broke
the moment that Senator Laughlin
since this.
A pandemic it started we know
that we should.
To get the test.
And all of the COVID taste then
also soon we'll we'll get that
immunizations what is the
address on a simple of emotion I
don't know four months.
For these reasons we always have
to fill out a form people
netting for Musaeum can also in
response instead of going but if
you give information that we
have no idea what will it would
be share with me funding your
and most of the appropriations
most people to hit on was that
the money that my family and I
have tried to protect ourselves
and our community I don't
wonderfully most of Senators up
with what must be the attorney
for must see on a set of
interest on the middle
associated.
But when we went to take the
test they ask this information
about our social security.
C. Danielle most on also what
I'm sat the in laws but I want
that on he said the most the
most about the S. thank you for
must see on.
So it they asked us for a social
security number and also if we
had and medical insurance and we
were afraid to share this
information.
For most of it but I can say it
but I can set up on but the the
because we know with whom it was
going to be shared.
Many of the more but my most of
others you see on the federal.
We were afraid but we made the
decision to do it you know
that's one thousand what we Fund
was he was but at the let me
fund media.
In the results of the COVID test
were positive for all my family.
It means more yes also I miss
the momentum as we go so spent
all that across and that's why
right now my husband is the only
one that is that supports the
house to look at
that a hypothetical that we that
this was settled.
But he had to stop.
I'm working because he had to
take care of his health.
Yes one moment open some most
they open the update on those
people that work in the scene
the moss and build out of in
that one point with that I have
to go to the hospital because my
symptoms got worse worse and
it is to embrace it but I think
in the end of this other than
the almost double but the
pharmacy on but we always work
afraid that we have to share
information personal
information.
This one was which almost gone
was this battle is body apple
Yandle unless I mean yes when I
leave the lake on on the court
and also when we heard that our
state was going to support
families with economic relief.
Also mortality up it'll come in
which available bus you don't we
were very happy but also we were
very worried funding for much
younger than their most can
agree that because of the
information we had to give you
know seven yes any up on but the
the and not knowing with pool it
was going to be shared and
Policy plus you wanted like a
stab almost all members that
is you see on that because what
is the phone the but because of
our situation we decided to
apply for this relief.
More moderate get open and let
them do that the poll that that
I mean for must see on.
As a mother I want to have the.
The peace of mind to give my
information.
A second by the that you need
from me up with somebody as
well.
Without the given my information
without the fear that it will be
shared in our family would be
will be at risk.
Media is that those makes don't
get animals for their on field
and I've seen people C. Harper
even most important ASEAN is a
family of make status we want to
be able to
Be able to trust the
institutions that receive our
information.
What is so and the other only
last for the most part you're
not request on a lady activate
sanderling what that's why today
we're asking you to support H.
B. one twenty four.
Us thank you.
Yes yes okay we are now going to
go to India record.
You are now in muted.
You'll have to anyone you're in.
Okay can you hear me we can hear
you wonderful.
Good morning my name is near
record of the policy council and
regional manager of the ACLU of
New Mexico I'm based out of Los
crucis I'm here today in support
of house bill one twenty four
prohibiting disclosure of
sensitive personal information
by state agency employees.
Although a number of local
jurisdictions throughout New
Mexico have privacy
confidentiality policies that
prohibit the disclosure of a
person sensitive personal
information obtained by public
employees to outside agencies or
individuals we recognize that
there is a need for a uniform
statewide policy to cover and
protect the sensitive personal
information of all New Mexicans.
The state's nonpartisan ethics
commission proposed a model
ethical code first state
agencies however this model code
is only a recommendation
insuring privacy protection is
X. is especially important now
as the state in its response to
COVID nineteen continues to
provide essential health related
services and economic relief
programs requiring New Mexicans
sensitive personal information
including contact tracing and
vaccinations.
For many state agencies to
function properly they need to
be able to obtain sensitive
personal information from New
Mexicans and when New Mexicans
provide this information to
state employees the wi has New
Mexicans have a reasonable
expectation that this
information will remain
confidential.
By adopting a standard non
disclosure policy with these new
categories of protected
information New Mexicans will
not have to think twice before
accessing health public safety
or other government services
thank you.
Thank you that concludes our
public comment so now we will go
to the committee for questions.
Committee members.
Representative Rehm.
Thank you madam chair
where are you and
Representative Garcia when I
look at the we make sure I get
the right FIR appear when I look
at the FIR have you seen on the
FIR on your bill.
Yes I have madam chair.
Okay and the.
I'm trying to I've got so many
windows open I'm trying to
figure out where it is here.
Under significant issues
it says that the federal law
that hit the and the Americans
with disabilities and the family
educational rights and privacy
already cover this and then when
we look at that next paragraph
or two paragraphs down we see
the Attorney General saying this
is going to cause confusion
within all the state agencies
and so I think this is actually
needed and we don't need to put
our
State employees are county
employees or any employees in a
situation where they're going to
be disciplined.
Because all the acts are so
confusing.
What do you have a
Representative Garcia do you
have a response for that or.
Madam chair of in the.
Representative a ring
Thank you for that question
again.
This legislation is exclusively
for the state it doesn't entail
you misspelled he's counties
Other political subdivisions
just the state agencies to
introduce departments of
several.
And I would yield to either
Gabriela
or more sent out in terms of
your questions in relationship
to
The AG our assessment and in
those acts that you mentioned
which choose already include
this language so Gabriele
Marcella Frieder lab right on in
and answering the the
representatives question.
Thank you Representative thank
you madam chair that comment
regarding hippo was provided by
the department of health and yes
but does apply to the department
of health but outside of the
department of health there's
very limited coverage so for
example Hebbe covers medical
information essentially in three
big buckets you know the payment
of health services which is
health insurance Medicaid
Medicare between the health care
provider secondly it obviously
provided protection in terms of
exchanging of information
between the patient and the
health care provider your doctor
nurse practitioner X. cetera and
then certainly the agency that
has the information or sharing
the information must be
considered a covered entity so
if you're interfacing with the
New Mexicans interfacing or
interacting with a state
employee.
Or a state agency that isn't
considered a covered entity
under HIPAA that hit but does
not apply.
And then regarding of the
comments
within the if for a by the
attorney general's office you
know this legislation as many
have noted is smaller in scope
in terms of it regulates the
behavior of individual state
employees and it amended the
governmental conduct act because
that's where it makes sense to
regulate the behavior of state
employees to ensure uniform
policy
you know for example within the
G. C. a state employees can't
use of state property for
personal gain so no state agency
will have to change its policy
in terms of how it handles it
requests but we know some of the
information that we are aiming
to protect is not actually
exchanged within rebel
documents it is the type of
exchanges that occur and perhaps
a more informal fashion it is
the information that you give
for example and HSD clerk or a
clerk and another state agency
and then that information is
divulged either in an informal
conversation or somebody in the
community and of course those
conversations are not something
that you would be able to limit
in terms of dealing with it
brought.
So again no state agency will
have to change how it handles
April requests those requests
will still go to the custodian
of records within that state
agency and they'll follow the
person the procedure that is
laid out with an extra.
Thank you madam chair thank you
very much.
Madam chair and representative
Garcia what you're telling me is
to stand if I if for a a city or
county I could get more
information than I would receive
from the state.
On an individual.
Madam chair representative Rehm
that there are more seven can
you respond to that.
R. Papa thank you madam chair
representative our proposal at
this juncture is just for state
employees.
Madam chair representative
Garcia and Michelle what.
Is that a yes then.
Madam chair representative
winning yes.
Okay thank you.
Madam chair representative
Garcia I want to read a
paragraph on the FIR.
And it says your bill permits
that exposure of information
when quote necessary to carry
out a function of the state
agency and quote and your pro
provides that providing public
records is the function of all
public bodies creating real
ambiguity on the
responsibilities of state
agencies from the New Mexico
Attorney General quote because
violations of the governmental
contact act or criminal offenses
state agencies would put tension
we face a dilemma of either
running the risk of a criminal
penalty for violating the
government governmental conduct
act or face a civil penalty for
violating it brought into court.
How do we respond to that I'm
I'm not in favor of setting up
our state employees could be
prosecuted when they're just
trying to carry out a function.
Madam chair on that point.
Representative Ely on that point
you madam chair I I'm as she's
answering the question I'm
looking at the bill what if you
just deleted a three.
And take out that conflict.
And with that answer I don't
know us with that ladies that
with that answer Representative
range question thank you madam
chair.
Thank you representative Ely
representative Garcia.
madam chair
that we're not going to you know
to you folks to kind of.
Respond to that.
Excuse me Gabrielle at do you
want to.
S. that.
But thank you madam chair
representative I to address that
and also if Marcelo honesty is
wants to chime in as well we
wouldn't be inclined to omitting
of this particular exception
this is something that was
worked out this is a similar
bill that this committee saw in
two thousand nineteen and that
was part of conversations we had
with other partner organizations
and to in order to exempt it
brought and also just to clarify
a point made by Representative
green the language within the G.
CA in terms of of violation of
the act languages specifically
knowingly and willingly so if
there is an inadvertent
mistake by state employee they
won't face that penalty thank
you madam chair.
Thank.
What I'm Representative you
still the floor yeah madam chair
and Representative Garcia okay I
agree that it's not knowingly
and willfully but the issue is
going to be this is your job you
should have known you should not
have released a so it's going to
fill the knowingly or get out
of violations so I mean you look
at this FIR I mean we've got the
superintendent of insurance
against that
Health Department saying they
already get hundreds of request
for a request each year and
we're just setting up our state
agencies for violation and I'm
really worried about setting up
criminal penalties for our
our employees we're just trying
to do their job and with that
thank you madam chair all all of
the others go on.
Thank you Representative Rehm
next we have Representative
Nibert.
Thank you madam chair.
A
couple questions
I I I kind of chuckle when I
hear a hip a violation because
this meeting started off with
probably some of that
I I would like to focus on
couple things of.
All the testimony and all the
information that that we for is
been focused on what I would
characterize as a very.
Limited
Group Rep which raising this
issue at
But if the facts.
Are going to be very broad.
And I'm really concerned about
creating laws for.
Very few that ban have
unintended consequences for the
vast majority of of the New
Mexicans and and what me just
the the.
Talk about a couple situations
that I'm currently involved in
legal.
Our and and maybe get a response
madam chair from the
representative
Because of the.
Sensitivity regarding.
Personal information.
Our courts and agencies.
Have in my opinion.
Very sensitive about disclosing
or.
Releasing information which has
caused
of some problems to conduct
business.
Currently by Representative
I'm a state.
That good to see that maybe some
fairly generous yes to to
minors.
Bruce mother happens to be
In unfortunate situation
involved in drugs and thank you
very uh.
You're not communicative cues
not trusting anyone yeah and
it's it's unfortunate but.
Representing the estate I am
unable to set up trust accounts
for these children.
Because I cannot secure their
social security numbers even
though those numbers are
available or known to children
youth and families in the
couple other agencies and I'm
having to go through judicial
proceedings to you're just
simply set up some accounts for
the benefit of these children
it's called green substantial
delays
you know the way the market's
been on Medicare probably
costing these children are quite
a bit of money and and yet you
know New Mexico boards with the
children and Bill Jordan said we
have to have this to protect our
children well
I need to social security
numbers to protect to children
in New Mexico and can't get that
And so we'll see where that
goes.
The state land office is very
repository of public
information.
Many of its records contain.
What I would characterize what
are defined as the public
sensitive personal information.
And yes that
public repository
Should be available for all
public to to go in and and
review those records and and so
my question there is.
Does this bill okay but.
That agency the commissioner of
public lands from disseminating
records that contain locations
where personal sensitive
personal information on that.
Madam chair of Representative
night Berg
Are you able to my experts to
kind of.
Answer that question
Okay I'm not Marcella.
Yes whoever would like to take
that go ahead and.
Madam chair representative
Nighbor at yes and that that if
that information again because
there is an exception in this
bill for it for a the state
agency will be able to handle
and it per request in this case
the land office as it does
currently there will be no
change in the way that this
state agency currently handles
requests as long as it is done
through the proper procedures.
And talking about it for request
madam chair on talking about the
ability to access the public
records that are in the public
records room of the State Land
Office.
Madam chair representative
neighbor as with any new long
state agencies will have to
review their their policies and
procedures to ensure that they
fall in line with the new
state statute of and again as we
previously mentioned you know
and and and then Virton because
the language within the
governmental conduct act is
knowing knowingly and willingly
You know they they won't they
won't face consequences that
there's an item in Burton
which is the case now.
Madam chair and miss this month
of.
I don't I don't understand of
that response because.
The commissioner of public lands
would knowingly and willingly
and by statute.
Those records open to public
inspection
They have a public a public room
that anyone should be able to
program and access the the
filing information that impacts
that affect state lands
throughout New Mexico and
You know I don't know that the.
This gets passed if you they're
going to be able to say well we
did knowingly I will willingly
allow the dissemination of that
that that information on a I'm
not sure that that.
Passes muster obviously.
I don't think that that
situation dealing with the issue
you're trying to fall.
But you created the bill that's
going to affect everything in
trying to solve a very narrow
issue that that the seems to be
concentrated on immigration
status and things of that nature
of.
It it just doesn't seem to me
that we ought to be taking up
big swipe at changing
State government and its records
to deal with a specific narrow
issue I think if there's a
specific narrow issue then then
try to surgically deal with that
specific narrow issue and allow
the the HSD Easter continue to
perform their functions many of
which have nothing to do with
the issue you raised at and have
been doing so for for many years
without problems but in the oil
and gas contacts which is a
majority of the records in the
State Land Office there's going
to be some information that
falls within your definition
that in many many of the filings
that are made there and.
The public has a right to not
only
go into the room and inspect
those records but copy them and
and to utilize them otherwise
people's interest in and say oil
and gas leases state
agricultural leases state
business leases
would have no value you could
improve you could improve the
title so
I'm really concerned with with a
couple specific aspects that
that I can run in my limited
practice.
As to how it will adversely
affect the ability to secure our
partner and relevant information
and maybe amber Frey that if
this bill passes.
We're going to have the exact
opposite reaction we're going to
have agencies them
put up walls and prevent
access to public records public
information at and that is going
to create I think a huge amount
of problems for people engaged
in your business particularly
with the state land office and
make the other agencies who are
repositories for for public
information that the public
should have a right to go fully
inspect even if they have some
of that data the last time this
bill was brought up we talked
about County clerk's lastly
you're tired and county clerks
out but the you know the same
the same holds true there is
work to affect the county
records so I am I am very
concerned about it
Representative I I.
I'm I'm not arguing against.
You know what you're your
efforts and try to do what what
you want to do and and maybe
protect some some specific
information on a very
narrow segment of our society
but I would say to do so with
with some very precision
language and don't affect the
rest of the.
Of the information that the
government the.
Have and frankly needs in order
to have a civil society that can
conduct its business are you
we're very with a free market
yeah and that's exactly what the
State Land Office does that's
exactly what the your
conservation division does
that's exactly what the
the energy minerals and natural
resources department does and
the environment department the
state
engineer all those records have
nothing to do with what you're
trying to fix yep those records
will be impacted our ability and
the public's ability to see
those records will be awarded if
this bill is passed.
thank you madam chair without
all
Render up before thanks.
Thank you Representative Nibert
is there anyone else.
Committee members.
What is the will of the
committee madam chair before we
do that
I do a couple of questions I I
was just curious this town goes
to Judiciary I'm assuming.
Doing L. Madam chair
representative.
Yes.
you madam chair Representative I
I was wondering if you would
mind that there been some
technical issues raised I I
don't want to hold up the bill
but I I do thank you that it
would benefit from
some amendments as we go forward
and I'm wondering madam chair
Representative EF your experts
would be open to visiting with a
little bit with me to see if we
can go through the Senate maybe
proposed some amendments
Judiciary districts are needed.
Madam chair
I have
No difficulty in terms of
The wishes of this committee
In in terms of meeting with.
Myself and the expert witness in
the addressing some of those
concerns.
Matt Madam chair representative
yeah I I would do them right now
but I'm not clear there needed
and I just want to go through
this little more carefully and
gets or comments I'm listen
carefully to Representative
nitrogen redeem and looking at
the FIR and some of the analysis
so I thought we just kind of
work through it but I don't have
any problems the bill today I'm
just thinking before it's
Judiciary it might benefit from
adjuster further review but I
wouldn't have any problems with
the bill forward so thank you
madam chair thank you
representative.
Thank you representative Ely.
Representative Johnson.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you colleagues and thank you
representative Garcia for
bringing this bill forward so on
that note I would like to move
that do pass with the
proposal that representative Ely
suggested before the next
committee.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you representative Johnson
we have a due pass motion by
Representative Johnson is there
a second.
And.
We have a second by
Representative Ortez
we still have Representative
Chasey stand up right now so
I'll go to you.
Representative Chasey.
Thank you madam chair I was I
was just going to
See if.
You know I am a little concerned
about some unintended
consequences I have no problem
with accomplishing the intent of
the legislation and voting for
that I I just.
I I was just going to see if we
could fix it before exhaustion
addition right that would be
really good.
We're sending a lot of bills to
Judiciary to get fixed along the
way and it it just puts a pretty
heavy load on our analysts team.
So that's just all I was what I
was gonna make thank you.
Madam chair and chair and chair
for
I'm happy to go through with the
analysts I'm sorry the experts
over the weekend
I've sent representative Garcia
my cell number if they want to
call me I should be around after
two o'clock on Saturday I've got
other appointments and we can
kind of go through it and if
there are manage and we can
bring it back before the
committee on Monday we might be
able to get a judiciary and a
cleaner shape if that would work
for both both of my favorite
chairs so if that would work
I'm happy to do that and spend
some time over the weekend on it
to get a clean bill Judiciary if
need.
Madam chair
I am amenable to the wishes of
the committee.
And if we need to go that route
and the committee is comfortable
with that I have no
qualms with that.
I do want to bring up one point
all.
In regards to in terms of my
closing before the committee
decides which action to take in
moving forward
That this built exclusively
dealing with personal sensitive
information.
The wall Jean of sensitive
personal information.
By state agencies employees of
state initiatives etcetera
not the divulging of public
information.
you know and if public
information that's that does
have these components then
that's where this legislation
kicks in but a public
information does not have these
components in that legislation
flows like it always feels to
this day.
So so madam chair
We're at your mercy in terms of
how you want to proceed
amenable to the recommendation
that represented the line maybe.
So we have a motion on the floor
and I know representative Ely
said you work with
The sponsor and and his experts
this weekend one of the things
that I want everyone to keep in
mind is that any changes need to
get to the analysts.
As soon as possible and we're
having issues as it is already
with FY ours not coming through
so that's the only thing that I
would advise that once changes
are okayed by Representative
Garcia that that information
gets conveyed to everyone.
Madam chair on that point yeah I
I hadn't thought about that why
don't we do this I I I as soon
as this meetings concluded
if either Representative Garcia
or the experts together or
separately I don't care have
them call me on my cell I've
given Representative pursue that
number but it's six one zero six
five two nine and we can work on
it today so that it can be back
in front of the committee on
Monday.
Okay.
I I think that would be best
just so we get that information
to everyone and we have
everything finalized before
Monday I hope that folks can get
information to the committee
members on Sunday that way we
can all take a look at it and be
prepared once were having that
discussion first thing on Monday
morning so what we'll do is
we'll just go home go ahead and
roll over one twenty four and
with the changes will add up
first thing on our agenda on
Monday.
Madam chair let me just say that
we just got about nineteen bills
referred yesterday so it doesn't
slow this bill down.
In the queue of judiciary if it
doesn't come out.
on our floor session next week
okay thank you thank you madam
chair will
recognize thank you
representative Garcia and
experts and we will see you on
Monday morning.
Thank you.
So now we are moving to HB
fourteen Representative Dixon is
waiting in the attendees split.
So we can get her moved over to
a panelist.
And then
she does have an expert I'm not
sure if he's able to join us.
But if he is his name is or
excuse me his or her name is
Terry.
Runner.
So I see Representative.
Dixon has joined us welcome
Representative thank you and my
expert witness will be joining
momentarily.
So if your analyst can just be
on the look out but we can start
to whenever the committee's
right.
Great we are ready welcome go
ahead and proceed with a house
bill fourteen.
Thank you so much madam chair
and members of the committee I
am here this morning to present
house bill fourteen which is the
New Mexico grants administration
act the purpose of house bill
fourteen is to increase revenue
and investments in New Mexico by
leveraging federal funds and
philanthropic dollars to build a
better New Mexico.
New Mexico's discretionary
budget is heavily dependent on
oil and gas revenue and as such
there's a limited pool of
resources from which to draw.
Therefore New Mexico must
maximize and leverage external
funding opportunities in order
to continue to grow improve
infrastructure and diversify our
economy.
Unfortunately New Mexico
consistently trails neighboring
state in its ability to attract
this funding.
For example.
In fiscal year twenty nineteen
the USDA made eighteen point
eight million dollars available
in a to rural intermediary
relenting program these are
loans for nonprofit lenders to
make to small businesses but New
Mexico received zero awards.
Two hundred million dollars was
made available through the cares
Act for telehealth project New
Mexico received one out of five
hundred ninety three awards I'm
here point one percent of the
available funding.
And over the past three years
New Mexico organizations have
failed to receive any awards in
the housing and urban
development fair housing
initiatives program to fight
housing discrimination that
means missing out on ninety five
point five million dollars over
three years.
In order to better leverage
federal resources especially
through competitive grants this
legislation will establish a New
Mexico grant administration a
grant opportunities council and
a matching grant fund.
During the twenty twenty
election president Biden
campaigned on a platform to
build back better and that
platform included a proposed two
trillion dollar investment into
rebuilding America's
infrastructure generating clean
electricity retrofitting homes
and buildings and building
affordable housing.
And as we know from the two
thousand nine recovery act
funding it's critical that our
state be prepared and
strategically positioned to
capitalize on all available that
federal funding.
Earlier this week president
Biden announced an executive
order calling for investment in
infrastructure conservation
agriculture and community and
workforce transition.
By creating a centralized entity
and the single point of contact
within the state government for
federal grant applications this
bill will improve communication
and collaboration among all
grant entities.
In order to maximize and
leverage federal funding our
state agencies local and
regional entities tribal
governments and nonprofits need
to be prepared now.
We need to ensure that they have
the access to resources and
support so that we can
capitalize on these
opportunities.
And given the potential amount
of money at stake we have to lay
the groundwork now.
So I'd like to talk for just a
couple minutes about the
components of this bill there
are three components.
First over twenty other states
have established either state
planning office or a grandpa
office.
This legislation establishes a
New Mexico grants grant off
administration.
A grant opportunities council
and The New Mexico matching
grant funds.
First the purpose of the New
Mexico grant administration is
to increase the number of grant
dollars our state receives by
reducing and removing barriers
to federal grant funding and
national philanthropic dollars.
The grant administration will be
housed within the department of
finance and administration.
And it will compile and
distribute federal grant
opportunities and resources to
state agencies local governments
tribal governments and
nonprofits.
It will offer services such as
identifying appropriate federal
grant opportunities assisting
with grant applications writing
and editing grant proposals and
advising on proper grant
management.
You will develop resource
materials trainings and
educational information about
best practices throughout the
course of the grant process.
And the grant administration
will engage directly with the
federal delegation and federal
agencies and will serve as a
centralized location for
coordination.
Second The New Mexico grant
opportunities council will have
the purpose of engaging
stakeholders around the state.
Continuing to advise the office
and providing annual
recommendations to address
additional barriers increase
grant revenues and proposed
legislation for consideration
implementation.
The make up of this council is
designed to represent both urban
and rural areas small medium
large counties and
municipalities grant and
nonprofit experts and a federal
delegation representative.
Final component is the matching
grant Fund.
Federal grants often require
applicants to share in the cost
of a project or program but many
local agencies and tribal
governments are unable to meet
match requirement either because
of budget limitations or time
and as a result they miss out on
valuable federal grant
opportunities.
By setting up in New Mexico
matching grant fund we can
reduce the number of miss grant
opportunities and increase grant
funding that comes into New
Mexico especially into are
smaller and more rural
communities.
The grant office would establish
criteria for prioritizing match
application and create standards
of eligibility.
It would be available year round
eliminating the constraint of
procuring these funds only
during the legislative session.
And further more because match
funding is typically a small
portion or percent of the total
grant award New Mexico would
receive a high return on
investment.
In conclusion now is the ideal
time to establish the New Mexico
grants administration the grant
opportunities council and a
matching grant fund.
If we delay New Mexico will
continue to miss out on millions
of dollars that our state
desperately needs.
This legislation offers a
tangible product and a return on
investment they can both be
measured and attract.
So thank you for your time I
don't know if my expert witness
has joined if he has I'd like to
offer him the opportunity to
make a few remarks and then up
would be I'm available to take
any questions thank you.
Representative it looks like he
has not joined okay so let's go
ahead and go to the attendees
and we're going to take a poll
on whether folks support house
bill fourteen and I will start
the call and open it.
And it is now open so it will be
open for thirty minutes you can
go in favor or against house
bill fourteen right now.
Madam chair on that point I
think you said thirty minutes
maybe thirty seconds.
So there's about fifteen seconds
Representative Ely for those
that want to join the poll.
And if the poll will close in
five seconds.
The poll is now closed so we
have four attendees.
For House Bill fourteen and one
attendee against house bill
fourteen.
So with that we are going to go
to attendees if you like if you
would like to speak in
opposition to house bill
fourteen please raise your hand.
Okay we are talking about
opposition.
And seeing line we're going to
those that would like to speak
in support of house bill
fourteen.
So Matt Thompson.
You are now unmuted.
Thank you madam chair and
members my name is Matt Thompson
manager of governmental affairs
for Apache corporation and will
gas company headquartered in
Houston but with the operations
of production all over
southeastern New Mexico.
In twenty nineteen.
Patchy in nineteen other
companies created the Permian
strategic partnership to address
some quality of life issues
across the Permian basin in one
of the things we noticed rather
drastically was the quality of
the roads and road funding was
set back it could be
intermittent said be safe to say
the best
when we started looking for some
federal grants in the twenty
nineteen at in dot and others
told us that they weren't
prepared to undergo a grant
process because they didn't have
the resources or the staffing
through PSP we cobbled together
seventy five thousand dollars.
To help them with the build
grant application in.
That said.
Five thousand dollars into
twelve and a half million
dollars that was put into
district to for road repair
construction etcetera.
After that process we made the
grant the grand prize a process
more permanent in we have a we
return.
Proximate lead twenty one
hundred dollars school
communities that could be as
little as five thousand dollars
for the Carlsbad boys and girls
clubs which provide meals for a
month
all the way up to something like
that we spent six that one fifty
seven hundred dollars and got a
forty one thousand dollar award
for a few minutes just.
For firefighters in Carlsbad so
Representative Dixon filed this
bill we saw it in were very
enthusiastic that what we have
discovered just in the small
southeastern corner of New
Mexico could be applied to the
rest of the state and improve
the quality of life for all New
Mexicans with very minimal input
so being able to leverage these
dollars as it is critically
important and we believe that
it's time to stop leaving
federal funds available on the
table and into into put them to
work for the Mexico citizens so
thank you madam chair thank you
members of the committee and
thank you Representative Dixon
for this outstanding bill.
Thank you Mr tops I'm send we
are now going to.
Joy as Barzan you are now
unmuted.
Thank you madam chair and
members of the committee my name
is Joyce person I'm the deputy
executive director for New
Mexico counties we do not have a
formal position yet on this bill
but I am standing to say we
certainly respect and appreciate
the intent of the sponsor we
have some expertise in this area
we have had a partnership since
two thousand and five with the
bureau of land management to do
wildfire risk reduction requests
as well as illegal dumping
projects and in that time we've
managed to move about seven
million dollars on three hundred
projects and what that
demonstrates to us is the
significant need New Mexico for
these types of resources because
the counties no we provide grant
programs for specific lines they
contact us regularly to ask if
there's other resources and
options available for different
types of infrastructure youth
projects X. cetera so we know
the need is significant and we
would like to thank the sponsor
for bringing this forward thank
you.
Madam chair you're needed.
Thank
were Catherine you are unmuted
you'll have to a new on urine.
Madam chair members of the
committee thank you very much my
name is Katherine Nicolau I am
the external affairs and
marketing manager for sacred
wind communications and sacred
wins is a rural electric and.
They could win is in our lack we
provide a telephone and high
speed internet to rural parts of
northwest New Mexico and so
stated when supports HB fourteen
because we've been one of the
few companies in New Mexico to
participate in both the FCC
phase one and phase two connect
America fund options in the STC
phase one rural digital
opportunity fund auction in the
FCC broadband experimental
demonstration project and in
four different USDA grant and
loan programs so as a provider
of broadband we support a
centralized coordination in New
Mexico for broadband grant loan
applications it's to give you a
few more examples of some missed
funding opportunities in the two
thousand eighteen FCC connect
America fund phase two option
one point nine eight billion
dollars was made available to
fund broadband expansion in
rural areas across the United
States of half a dozen internet
service providers the rural
electric coops in the rural
telcos sacred wind
communications was the only
recipient we received two point
three million to build broadband
infrastructure and we added nine
additional Navajo chapters to
reach five thousand customers
but again we were the only one
and then in the twenty twenty
FCC's rule digital opportunity
fund option sixteen point four
billion dollars was made
available to fund broadband
expansion in even harder to
reach areas of the United States
only three rural telcos into
rural electric cooperatives.
Participated in the auction
which was an improvement over
two thousand eighteen but the
greater amount of funding
available in New Mexico went to
Texas a Texas company and a
satellite company they could
wind again we won two point six
million but we could have bid
for more if the state were able
to support the required letter
of credit for all winning bids
to acquire in a letter of credit
is very expensive for a small
company and then the last
example is in the latest April
twenty twenty round of USD a
distance learning requests there
were no applicants from New
Mexico so the process for
participation in application for
all of the above is daunting and
consuming for most of the
smaller will introduce the
federal grant loans the
applicants you know they must
either study and understand
these hundred page orders or
consult with the consultants
those centralized grants support
office would help many rural
municipalities and more
companies to take advantage of
the funding opportunities that
the federal government provides
thank you for your.
Thank you we will now hear from
J. contentious.
You are muted.
Okay.
Can you hear me we can hear you.
Can you hear me yes okay I'll be
back on my and good morning
chair woman and Representative
Dixon I my name is Jennifer
contentious and the deputy
superintendent of insurance and
I have a clear for the patient
question of the legislation I
was we are seeking to find out
if an agency will be required to
do you have all their grant
applications process to the
proposed division or is that
offered service first is a
requirement.
Representative Dixon.
Thank you so this is a it's been
offered service although there
would be an advantage should the
state decide to make the grants
administration the inter
governmental review point of
contact with the federal
government.
Thank you madam chair thank you.
we also see that Terry Brunner
has joined us so we can move him
on as a panelists please.
Great and we will now go to
Representative Chasey.
You madam chair just Terry
Bruner want to add anything or
did to do hear any of the
discussion.
Is I know he.
Pardon me.
Madam chair.
You may want to hear from him
first Mr Brenner do you I know
you got on late so I don't know
how much of the discussion you
heard.
I'm.
I've heard some of it thank you
right in there something you
like to add to go had yes thank
you madam chair and
representative Dick sin my name
is Terry printer and I run a
nonprofit organization
Albuquerque called pivotal New
Mexico that helps organizations
in New Mexico get funding
particularly from federal
foundation sources in a past
life I was the state director
for USDA rural development in
the Obama administration and saw
first hand the difficulties New
Mexico had been competing grant
that's direct patient
I'm and I know that when record
needed as a state in seeking out
funding we do a better job
and we know that in twenty
twenty one built on the come out
there already have been recovery
funds and twenty that we missed
out up in will continue to miss
out funds if we are coordinated
our efforts.
Just as two examples you know
there's an app Federal
Communications Commission
telehealth program last year
they came out with two hundred
million dollars New Mexico
received one award out of five
hundred ninety three and we had
few applications and that's
partially because of a lack.
Nation flowing coordination
right now there's a massive
amount of funding available for
behavioral clinic Representative
the state which is a huge need
for us and what the state of New
Mexico should be doing is
coordinating efforts to regrets
office like most states have to
figure out which clinics needs
support how to take advantage of
the money get the word out
because what I fear is going to
happen and we saw this in the
recovery act in two thousand
twenty and two thousand nine
which I helped administer here
locally is New Mexico simply
wasn't at the table for so many
programs
in you know and twenty eighteen
New Mexico receive less than one
percent of discretionary funds
we are forty nine of fifty and
utilization of US probe
development funds
if the grant off could
coordinate thank one thing that
we've noticed is the American
society of civil engineers has
talked out all water wastewater
needs we have over twenty years
it's over a billion dollars you
simply coordinated our water
trust board and USDA funding EPA
funding those twenty years since
our funding needs could be wiped
out in six to ten years but we
simply don't coordinate and
as as Representative Dixon is
shown in our research for this
legislation
other states that take advantage
of having a grants management
type office bring in so times an
extra hundred million into their
state annually that's fantastic
so this simple feature creating
an office like it seemed some
traffic impact for the state so
madam chair thank you for
allowing me to do all.
Thank you representative will
have four.
Thank you madam chair I I really
did wanted to here from Terry
Bruner because when I was first
during the abuse and neglect
cases one of the counties in
which I was court appointed was
similar County and I had talked
with Mr review times because I
always had clients who needed
housing and would Representative
Dixon brought up the whole idea
of that we've been missing out
on opportunities to for huge
grants into portable housing and
that is one of the biggest needs
we have in New Mexico it just
struck me that this is a the
spectacular idea
I also I worked at thousand
senior research associate at the
UNM wholesale to center for a
number of years and.
When we would make application
for federal grants we did have
matching funds.
through other
parts of the university but I
was also the director of a
nonprofit where we had to come
up with matching funds and we
had to do that by fundraising
and you know just private
support of our program.
It's really cumbersome to have
to do that and yet I know that
when you bring in the federal
dollars lots of times they
turned over many many times
every year the tobacco
settlement revenue oversight
committee hears from the
university of New Mexico on it
how much would we give them the
legislature appropriates tobacco
settlement dollars to U. N. M..
That grows exponentially with in
our economy they help start up
businesses and it's it's really
I read that the bill and I don't
think I quite understood the
implication to tell
Representative Dixon explained
it this morning but this is
Holly.
Kind of a no brainer we would
really need to be doing this I'm
in strong support thank you.
Thank you Representative Chasey
Representative.
Ortiz.
Thank you madam chair
representative Dixon and sure
Chasey for those comments I'm
also yeah stand in strong
support of this bill I have a
comment and a few questions I'll
I'll ask my questions first of
Representative Dixon and Mr
Bernard expert witness can you
tell me a little bit how the
matching grant fund will play
with other funds that already
exist in other agencies in the
state.
Thank you madam chair
representative Ortez the
matching grant fund is designed
to be a last resort option for
state agencies local governments
tribal governments.
To go to when there is an
opportunity that is on the table
from the federal government
primarily
and they don't have the money in
the budget allocated they can't
move money around or the timing
doesn't coincide with the
legislative session the grants
office would establish the
criteria create the application
and and do all of that work but
it would really be.
For those in you know situations
where we have this opportunity
on the table and we want to take
advantage of it I think a good
example is up when the
Department when FEMA has a grant
opportunity for a fire truck for
instance in you have a village
let's say the village of Los
Lunas what you know is in need
of this fire truck but the grant
opportunity has arisen and they
didn't know in advance and so
they had not planned for it what
they could do is apply to the
matching grant fund for a grant
of forty five thousand dollars
that would then enable them to
get four hundred and fifty
thousand dollars from the
federal government in a match
and that's you know that's a
pretty significant return on
investment and I think because
of the some of some of the
limitations that we have with
the way our legislature works we
need to have other opportunities
thank you and I don't know if my
expert witness that has anything
to add on that not okay.
No.
Chair representative Dixon
Representative Ortez so so I
think it's important for this
office to help eliminate some of
the hurdles that organizations
perceive that are out there to
them getting a project when we
working needs throughout the
state
committees will say we want to
get the fire truck or we want to
do this economic development
plan but there's always an edge
you know so they they kind of
take themselves out of the
process and thank but we can't
qualified to do that probe
project because we know there's
gonna be match will never that
match so by doing this and
having a fund that can assist
with matches your eliminating
that hurdle and you're also
doing a lot of positive work
with the federal government the
like to see skin in the game in
a sense if there's a
contribution or leveraging
that's going on around the
project the federal government
things hello then then there's
there's more interest in this
project and and more invested in
the project so you really like I
said are taking these hurdles
down in making the.
The ability to get into federal
programs a lot easier on these
communities.
Thank you madam chair
representative sent Mr burner
that was a I think those are
great examples I'd like to know
a little bit more about the
technical assistance and how
that would have an impact on the
nonprofit's of who I recognize
can not right as of this moment
take advantage of the matching
grant fund
but this legislation does talk
about nonprofits being able to
tap into some technical
assistance at this office would
provide.
Yes thank you madam chair and
representative or test the idea
of the grants office is just
sort of offer a range of
services you know there are some
state agencies that have
fabulous grant writing teams and
we do have the supports as
joy of from the New Mexico
association of counties
mentioned we do have cogs and
other entities that do provide
support to some folks so we
don't necessarily need to do you
know start to finish with every
entity but we know what we need
to be able to do is offer
resources trainings and guidance
to you know both the
governmental agencies and
nonprofits in New Mexico so that
they have a better chance of
succeeding and one of those
things that can be provided by
the grants office and
specifically Nevada has done a
fabulous job with this is
providing they will review
drafts they will add it
and assist with grant management
and compliance as well so I hope
that answers the question.
Thank you madam chair
representative Texan it does and
just my my last comment is that
you I I run a nonprofit in a
rural community inTaos and I
know that we leave.
Billions millions not billions
millions of dollars on the table
specially the federal level
because we just lacked the
capacity to apply for these
funds and Mr burners
organizations been very helpful
in you know and and guiding us
but I know that not only from
the nonprofit perspective but
from local government government
perspective it's you know some
some counties just don't have
grant writers we don't have one
in Taos County and I can only
imagine that this division or
would it just would help
counties like ours in tapping
into those federal funds and
state funds as well to bring
more jobs to our community have
funding for infrastructure I am
in strong support of this bill
and and thank you madam chair
representative Mr burner for
your comments appreciate it.
But thank you madam chair may I
respond to that thank you
representative Ortiz and yes
Representative Dixon you may
respond.
Thank you madam chair
representative our test one of
the things that you sort of
highlighted that I'd like to
mention and then see if my
expert witness has some
elaboration is one of the
advantages of and grants
administration is to sort of
develop and facilitate
relationships with the national
foundations and other
philanthropic dollars and that's
an area that you know it's just
hard to tap into and there are a
lot of organizations at the
national level that are
interested in supporting funding
of rural healthcare clinics you
know job training program stem
programs behavioral health all
sorts of things that you know
our local governments tribes and
nonprofits really can tap into
and this would be an excellent
resource Mr Brenner did you want
to supplement that.
Yes Madam chair representative
sent what's what's unique about
this approach is you essentially
have a repository in place where
you're hearing about all the
opportunities and say you're
hearing about what led to
consider doing this got you
coach is and you can also be a
bit of an advocate with the
national foundation we really
only.
Google national foundations that
participate are in our state
it's it's kind of unusual
despite the social economic
issues that we might have any
data at all these national
foundations would be taken into
interest in moving numbers in
New Mexico but we really only
have the Kellogg foundation in
any case you foundation a couple
others we need to be able to you
know go out word and seek out
funding around you know the
unique things that we're doing
to affect positive change here
so some good gone on this grants
this can identify it and sell it
a little bit to other vendors
that are out there they're
interested in making a
difference
and and we see what re
Travelocity some of this work
and talk to major foundations
do you really don't know about
what's going on in New Mexico
you don't really know the access
points to get in and make it so
I'm one of the provisions of
this bill that that's that's
interesting there's several
executive order one two three
seven two that that basically
has you checked the box under
federal application to give
notice to the state that you
filed that application just
having that information alone
knowing what's going on around
the state in all these different
projects will really help and
for everybody about how we can
work together working in more in
getting funding for the good
stuff that's going on.
Otherwise what happens right now
is that there is a fantastic
project in Guadalupe County you
know folks in the state may not
know about it and they may not
know they got a big federal work
or or do something good out
there so this really gets us to
a better coordination point and
information sharing and then be
able to distribute that
information nationwide to really
advocate for for what's going on
in I want to mention one other
point previous question and that
is you know on the this side one
of the biggest hurdles for local
organizations in the state one
one required for federal project
is getting what you call a duns
number into Sam's number and
getting registered with federal
systems so there's a program
right now per shattered lives
thank you that's in the latest
federal legislation that will
allow our the theaters museums
art exhibition spaces to recover
forty five percent of lost
ticket revenue last year I mean
that's a fantastic program in
New Mexico because we're all
about arts and culture we have
these things all over the state
they lost money last year but to
access program you're gonna have
to get registered on the federal
system and you know that's going
to be a hurdle if you have a
state office that could do a
basic training for folks get a
word out and get them registered
so they're wrecked thank the
program when it comes out that
means we all miss out on those
lines in those Main street movie
theaters don't have to shut down
and all it takes is for someone
to have a dream possibly and
show how to do it so I think
that there's a lot of potential
there that technical assistance
to.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you representative next we
have Representative I Burt.
Representative Representative
you're still muted I believe.
Oh I'm sorry.
I have a couple real technical
comments and and maybe points
the first the deals with the
question that was asked the one
of the agencies of the mandatory
or not and you might consider
Madam chair representative but
inserting the words if requested
at the top of page four line one
so the division shall are
requests to the following that
would clarify that are.
But I have the option to do it
Then log in page six.
Seven I'll be focusing my Madam
so on page six winds twenty two
through twenty five.
I think I understand what you're
incentives to get a County
representative from one small
County one medium failure one
large county but when you read
this it says three county
representatives each
representing a small medium or
large population County
of course they would those are
the three options all three of
them would represent one of the
three so I think it probably
needs of sorry three county
representatives
one each.
From.
A small comma medium and large
population county to make sure
that not all three are in one
category.
And that each of the categories
get one Representative same
thing on our municipal
representatives online twenty
four and twenty five.
And then on page seven line to.
About three representatives of
other local governments like
question is that other than
county and municipal about the
correct reading of that.
Yes that is.
So do you like school boards for
water conservation districts
Yes the.
Are are cheating Conservancy
districts
I'm at a loss there there's a
number of other local
governmental entities that thank
you Ross Perot.
Why does the my Lai.
Thank Nico comment on the bill
thank you for bringing.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative my right those
are great at.
Thank you.
Thank you Representative and
thank you representative
neighbored I think before we go
on Representative Dixon and
Representative neighbor I don't
know if those were
request to amend and committee.
And if so if it's because it
sounds like Representative Dixon
that you're grateful to those.
I'm I am I sorry madam chair
Representative Nibert I see no
issue with them
have a this is the first bill
that I presented and Janelle
Mason was the drafters who
worked with me
and so I don't know you know if
if there are reasons that it was
done in this particular way or
if if we should just Amanda I
differ to to you madam chair and
Representative Nibert.
Well madam chair if you want the
number I'll be happy to make the
amendment issue doesn't want the
amendment
All.
B. H. I think this is a logical
for.
Representative Dixon and that's
really your call
if you want to do it and if you
want to make sure that those
amendments flow to the intent of
your bill and then we can wait.
Madam chair I'm of fine with the
amendment on the fly.
Okay the I'm happy to make the
following a member.
on page four line one.
Insert the words.
Comma yes requests after the
word shall so it reads the
division shall comment if
requested.
And then all Representative
Kurt.
Representative you could just
repeat it at least one more time
we have new staff working and we
just want to make sure that we
get this for the committee
reports recorded correctly that
would be great.
Okay.
Thanks for.
One one.
And madam chair Representative
Nibert I apologize
could we it
I forgot about this part could
we actually do the amendment on
the fly for the others and then
I refer to with Janelle about
implications of
if requested I don't I I
realizing that I don't know if.
In the future if there would be
an issue with the state trying
to designate the grants
administration as the inter
governmental review if there
were if that would conflict.
Okay that'll be great and and
just for the purposes of the
public we are not talking about
zero to numbers because this is
an on the fly amendment so till
two numbers are referred to
those that are prepared in
advance for the committee's
recommendation or excuse me for
the committee's consideration.
So Representative neighbor to if
we skip that first amendment and
move on to the others.
Madam chair I would I would have
a response to the the
You know in the future if the
state wants to.
Capture and for small agencies
to go through this process them
I would say the bill or the
statute would need to be changed
to accomplish that yeah and
actually score said I'm just
trying to provide some clarity
in addressing the issue that was
raised because it's certainly
not clear in the language
employed whether it's required
or not required so I'm just
trying to provide clarity you
gotta do on where the other.
Thank you madam chair
representative Nighbor I don't
know if
Mr Brunner might be able to shed
light on that
whether.
it makes a difference I mean the
intent of the bill is not to
force agencies to utilize the
services but we want to ensure
that we are collaborating and
coordinating and so I don't want
to inadvertently remove that
aspect Mr Brunner in your do you
have a sense of that whether the
I would make a difference.
Madam chair representative said
I I think I can speak to what's
required under federal rules and
literally
what happens is on a federal
grant application to check a box
that says you have informed the
state that you're making this
application and sending them a
copy and that's really the full
force of the requirement
and that's only if the state
agrees to participate in that
executive work so the New Mexico
currently does not participate
in some other states down but
so we just complete an
application yesterday we're it
literally is checking a box and
then you take a copy and you
said to the state if if I I
don't know how but should force
there would be behind that I
think it's kind of
voluntary in a sense I don't
think the federal government's
gonna check to make sure you
sent it to the state it's kind
of
a handshake kind of thing we
agree to sent to the state and
and that's that I never heard of
HSD double checking that that
was done so I don't think it's a
real strict enforcement there
it's more of a courtesy maybe
it's best we turn to put it.
I would just suggest to
representative madam chair that
does she look at that issue
before the goes much further in
determining where twice once ago
and provide some clarity use
your was right there my man that
would deal with page six.
Why
twenty two through twenty five
so online twenty two.
Insert the word.
One in the.
After the comma.
Online twenty three.
The legal work representing.
And in lieu there
insert the word from.
On the same line.
The legal work for.
And insert in lieu thereof the
word and a ND.
So it would read three county
representatives
One the from a small comma
medium and large population
County.
This one get one the medium ones
of one large one.
Whatever small medium and large
is.
Online twenty four.
Insert the word one we're in the
after the comma.
One twenty five.
The lead the word representing.
And included there insert the
word from F. R. O. M..
On that same line twenty five
delete the word for.
And insert in lieu thereof the
word and in the.
So subsection B. would right
three municipal representatives
come up one each from a small
medium and large population and
then over on the next page
municipality.
Thank you Representative.
There.
Representative Dixon those are
from the amendments.
Yes they are thank you thank you
I'm so we have a motion to and
then I'll make that second is
there a discussion on the
proposed amendments.
Okay seeing none is there any
opposition to the proposed
amendments.
Okay seeing then we've amended
the bill Representative Dixon.
And
Moving on Representative
neighbor you still have the
floor.
Thank you madam chair I would
just ask that you look at the
other issue and and probably
clarify one way or the other so
that the agencies know if they
have to conform to this or if
they have the latitude to engage
in their own grant providing
without
going through this process thank
you madam chair.
Thank president of.
Representative Gallegos.
Thank you madam chair and
Representative actually I was
going to just ask for
clarification regarding the
council make it but it sounds
like to that amendment it's it's
much more clear so I appreciate
that
the only mothers I I think this
bill is great as I run a
nonprofit and just to be able to
get that information I think
that your witness Mr Reiter also
touched upon a training the
training component which I think
will be so important especially
for smaller municipalities have
you gotten any kind of way and
from the municipal league or the
league of can't of the county
association in response to how
they would roll out some of that
training.
Thank you madam chair and
representative guy a ghosts I
don't have an official statement
from either of those entities I
know that they have been a
reached out to for feedback I
will say that in addition to the
comments earlier from joy and I
apologize because I forgot her
last name up from the counties
Brian Moore did share with me a
statement
but and if I may read it and
it's very brief New Mexico
counties broadly support efforts
by the state to help local
governments access apply and
manage grants to support their
communities the grant approval
process is so complicated it's
very difficult for small rural
communities to provide the
expertise to manage an effective
grant program and as I said that
was from Brian Moore with the
New Mexico association of
counties.
Thank thank you madam chair
thank you representative I just
think this could be a game
changer specially for those
smaller entities and I know that
I have some of those rural areas
in in my district so thank you I
think most of my other questions
have been answered
so once again I just applaud
this effort and am a strong
supporter of your bill thank
you.
