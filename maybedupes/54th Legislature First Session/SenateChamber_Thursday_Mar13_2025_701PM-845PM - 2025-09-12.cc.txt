much, Mr. President, members of
the Senate, uh, I know that, uh,
at that, uh, I'm sure that there
were a lot of thoughts about the
complexities of the amendments
that were made, but in all
reality, there were only 5
amendments that were made, but
section by section.
That the information was put
back in place, that that was
done.
So in the house energy
environment and natural
mistakes that were found due to
amendments being added on top of
amendments. And then so, uh,
continuing just to give you an
idea in terms of what those 5

were the only 5 changes that
occurred and so, uh, with that,

the senator yield for a question

what will
I guess right now I can still

uh, senator Izi.
So the resources that are
generated by fees, of course,
tied also in with uh federal
example to the uh game officers
and uh also for operations. So
that's what the resources would
be used for in terms of what
you're talking about with the

the fee changes that occurred.

Now on the cliffs overlooking
the harbor, a group of seagulls
gathers, not to fish.
But to watch.
They don't dive into the waves
themselves.
Some even tip over nets spilling
fish back into the water.
At first the fishermen can

the sea.
The town wants bustling with
fresh seafood and prosperity
grows quieter.
The markets have fewer fish.
The restaurants close.
The balance is broken and both
the sea and the town suffer.
And so a place that once thrived
on skill, risk, and hard work
We have too many seagulls
waiting around for the next
industry to take from.
That is our problem.
And for that I cannot support
this bill.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
I'm trying to figure out what
this bill is about hearing a lot
about fish.
Hearing about doctors.

been around a long time.
Interestingly, one of the
staffers that I have working
here at the session, Paul
Biederman was one of the
original lawyers who worked on
Right now, uh, Mr. President, if
the senator would yield to a
question, just walk us through.
You know, how this law works and
what's covered under for trade
practices and why you believe
And I maybe send word it's not
quite as uh bashful about doing
so.
You know, Mr. President, um,
this chamber has been good in
all the years I've been here and
Um, I've never brought in 35
years of practice, never brought

for decades.
We're making minor modifications
to the totality of that act.
Congress has largely immunized
the manufacturing and marketing
of firearms.
But
Congress also very carefully
said there would be some
exceptions and this bill is
intended to fall within that
exception.
Of a number of things years ago
when Senator Worth, Senator
Stewart and I were House
members, the idea of an ignition
interlock on a vehicle was

should have an ignition and
locked and have been convicted
of a crime of driving under the
influence.
And I remind people when I
present this bill, I, I'm old
enough to remember years ago.

it was less expensive to simply
pay people who were killed when
their vehicles exploded.
And they burned to death.
and I'm reminded also that only
a decade ago I drive an SUV a
decade ago, we used to read in
the news every night, every day
about rollover accidents, tires
worrying about rolling over.
And not having your tires
explode and not losing your
family in a rollover accident.
And the reason is because

SUVs have anti-rollover
technologies you have braking
technologies. Your vehicles
don't roll over, your tires
don't collapse.

merits of what we're trying to
do here, which is try to make
sure that those of us that are

solution to this problem and
tonight the solution is to make

But I hope the chamber can
understand.
It's hard sometimes to have your
person attacked.
It was devised by people like
Hamilton.
And Jefferson and Adams.
And yes to my Republican
colleagues, men who held our
country together, lawyer like

want any attacks here on the
Senate floor.

That was his intent. That was
his purpose.
This bill is intended to assure
that federal laws that prohibit

That gun owners and people like

device like a Glock weapon and
should have and, and I'll add to
that center worth, it's not just
the mass carnage that these
weapons can inflict.

There's absolutely no reason our
law enforcement should be out on
the streets and outgunned and
