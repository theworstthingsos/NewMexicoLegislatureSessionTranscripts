Crystal Salazar?
We'll go ahead and begin our
meeting and you are next on the
agenda.
So moving on to agenda item
number 2, introduction to
community-based coordination
solutions, CBCS and update on
comprehensive addiction and
Recovery Act, pilot program.
The presenter is Crystal
Salazar, program manager.
A little bit of housekeeping
while we are waiting tomorrow.
Our meeting will be held at the
Santa Ana Star Casino.
At 54 Hamas Canyon Dam,
Bernelio.
Again, tomorrow's meeting will
be at Santa Anna Star Casino.
Thank you.
See the red light comes on.
OK, we're ready. You may begin.
Good afternoon and
Oh
Good afternoon everybody. Thank
you for having uh CBCS here. We
really appreciate your time.
I'm gonna be very honest, I'm
gonna wing this, um, so I'm
gonna do my best.
So,
A little bit about uh CBCS. We
are a, a new program here in New
Mexico. We're currently working
with Kara. Kara is
comprehension, addiction
recovery Act.
And right now our team is
myself, Crystal, the program
manager, and we have another
navigator that works with us. We
started this team with just 3 of
us, a program manager and two
navigators.
So what we do.
With this program in particular
is we work with.
The moms or the family members
of the CAO program.
They're usually identified in
the hospital, the
mom and the baby have tested
positive for some for some uh
opioid or maybe cannabis or
sometimes they've admitted to uh
maybe using it prior. We do have
some that were in a car accident
and maybe didn't know they were
pregnant, but they did test
positive, so we work with the
families to engage them back in
into the back with the.
CEOs and we work hand in hand
with them.
So what we're trying to do is
minimize.
Hospital admissions and educate
the clients on um how important
it is to
To make sure their health.
Health is wealth to make sure
that they understand that baby
needs to come to appointments.
Mom needs to stay coming to her
appointments as well.
I'm really shaky, you guys.
Um.
Yeah, Enrique was a, he, he's
gonna be on here shortly, so.
I'm just gonna let you guys know
what makes us different, what
makes CBCS different. I'm sure
you guys have a lot of people
that come and say, hey, well
we're gonna do this, we're gonna
offer this, but what makes CBCS
different.
We have live navigators 24/7.
OK, well, I think Enrique is
here, so I'm gonna let him.
Take over.
You've been doing a nice, can
you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Yeah, speak up a little bit
more.
OK. Can you hear me and perhaps
see me?
Hello?
I can hear you all fine, but I'm
wondering, can you hear me?
Go ahead and um talk to us a
little more so we can get our
our volume adjusted on this side
so I've been, I've been here
watching the entire time, uh,
for some reason it didn't, the
volume didn't connect, uh, but
I, you've been doing a great
job.
Crystal, I appreciate it. I'm
Doctor Enrique Guidos. I do have
uh a
PowerPoint presentation.
Ready to share with you and
Crystal, you've been doing
wonderfully. I'm not sure.
Do you all have
The capability to view a
PowerPoint.
I, I know Nicole, I shared it
with you ahead of the copy of
your presentation.
So we can just run through each
one of those the pages if you
want from the hard copy, um.
As Crystal said, we're honored
to have a chance to present.
To you all about the program
that we're
Running, uh, and we planned
about a 25 minute PowerPoint and
then
Uh, we're gonna be taking
questions for about half an
hour. The intent is that I've
gone through most of the
PowerPoint and then.
Crystal, who's our program
manager in New Mexico for the
program would uh field questions
along with me, so.
Ah, I'll just run through it and
I'll mention the page number for
each of the PowerPoints as I run
through so you can work with me.
The first page is a title page.
It just has the letter CBCS on
it.
And uh that's really just for us
to introduce ourselves. I'm an
ER doc.
By training
And CBCS got formed out of my
experience over the last 20
years.
Of
Uh, and prior to being a year
DACA was a firefighter, and both
of those in the Los Angeles area
and both of those.
Lines of work.
We would go repeatedly to see
the same individuals.
Uh, dozens of times a year and
particularly in 2006.
As I was a medical director of
the biggest.
New York here in Washington
state.
We ran numbers and we found we
had
Almost a dozen people with 100
or more visits to the ER.
In the prior 12 months. And so,
you know, we do good work in the
ER but if someone's coming 100
or more times, there's probably
something else.
Causing those visits and
I like to say when crisis occur
for folks.
The only places that are open
24/7.
365 or the morgue and a couple
of convenience.
Markets, the police department
and the ER, so we're probably
the better of those options.
But the reality is there's stuff
going on causing those crises
beyond what we could do and
that's what CBCS was about, was
meeting with folks.
Trying to find out what's the
underlying issues and see if we
can address them before a crisis
occurs, and
Uh, we did a real successful
program here in Washington state
back in 2006.
So much so that I got asked if I
could replicate it in other
markets and that's where CBCS
got born. I'm on to
Page number 2.
Just to describe to you a little
bit about the organization
before we go into the carra work
in particular in New Mexico, um,
we are a navigation
organization, and by that I mean
we
We find the unfound so our
clients are typically.
A state Medicaid organization or
A managed care organization we
have actually done work with
tribal communities up in Alaska.
But whoever our client is still
have
Uh, a population of maybe
100,000 lives, and of those
about 2 to 3%.
Aren't found. In other words,
they have a name and address,
but no one really knows where
they are in on average.
Or
Enrollees have about 5.5 care
coordinators assigned to them.
But for this 2 to 3% of that.
Population, none of those care
coordinators really engages with
the individual regularly.
Often it's because the address.
Or phone numbers are wrong.
Sometimes it's for other
reasons, but our job then,
where, where we specialize is to
find the folks.
Engage with them hear their
story. Why is it that
That
There's a disconnection.
Sometimes it's by desire, but
oftentimes it's
Due to uh something going on
that is a disconnect between the
health care system that in all
fairness,
Wasn't created for the
convenience of patients. It was
created for the convenience of
people like me, the docs and the
administrators, so.
We want to figure out where that
disengagement is and try to
connect them then to the proper
resources.
And I'm gonna move to page
number 3.
That's titled Community Resource
Engagement.
In addition to finding
Our clients, we spend about half
our time engaging with all of
these resources, because
All of them tend to have
wonderful people working.
With them
And most of them touch our
common clients.
But we're often working in
silos, and each of those
resources often doesn't know
what the other is doing. So when
we can have a dialogue with the
Patient and enrollee, a member.
And then also hear from each of
the resources about what they're
doing, what's missing.
We start developing a synergism
in the community.
That works really well. It's not
perfect, but it
Uses the community resources a
lot better and ultimately we
tend to deliver a better
Service to our members where one
can do that well.
Um,
Number 4, what differentiates
CBCS?
So care coordination and
navigation isn't new. Every
Community in the country is
doing it. Every MCO is doing it,
I'm sure.
You all are doing it. What
what's different, what's unique
about our services, we try to do
it in a way that really feels.
The gap. We know in spite of all
the services going on, I'll show
you some data here shortly.
We have thousands of people.
Come to the ERs.
Multiple times a year. So if
something's missing.
And where we feel we deliver a
uniqueness that we're
Live 24/7 365 so Crystal and her
team.
going out 2 in the morning to
the ER to the jails, to the
corrections facilities.
We're taking phone calls from
folks at any hour of the day or
night.
That's
A minimum
For us to be able to do this
connection work correctly. We
also have to be
From the communities we serve,
so it's no coincidence that our
New Mexico team are native.
New Mexicans and not everyone.
Has lived experience, but we
certainly seek outlived
experience.
For the issues
We're dealing with, whether it
be homelessness or mental health
or substance or jail experience.
And
We empower our staff with the
tools they need, so our staff
get paid.
About 2 to 3 times the ongoing
rate for positions, we support
them by income, but also
By giving them the tools they
need, so everyone on Crystal's
team has a credit card and
They can
Meet someone at 2 in the morning
in the ER get them food.
Get them clothes and give them a
drive home with no questions
asked. Put them up in a hotel
FDP. We want to be able to
deliver an immediate.
Service to help
Create that engagement.
With the client with the member
that then allows us to continue
in dialogue, develop that trust.
And see if they will continue to
talk with us.
Uh, the other two.
Items that we feel is very
unique and we are very facile in
all of the uh information
exchanges.
And the community works, so we
are very familiar with the New
Mexico.
Point click here database, which
is your uh
Health information exchange in
New Mexico. We also are familiar
with tools like Find help.
And unite us that often work in
the space.
And then we contract that risk.
So if we don't save.
Entity's money.
We don't charge for our
services. So those are kind of
our unique.
Uh,
Things about us. So the next
slide transitions to the Cara
pilot program, but before I
transition, I know we'll have Q
and A.
Coming, but I just want to pause
for a moment, see if Crystal
wants to add anything or any of
you have any questions so far?
All right, I will continue that.
So, um,
In
2022, I got approached by the
director of Medicaid, Laura Lee
Kellogg.
In New Mexico.
Who had heard about our
Work through different uh
Medicaid national uh conferences
she had been at, and she asked
me if we could work on some
issues in New Mexico. I said
absolutely.
And then she proceeded for the
next few months to figure out
how to incorporate us because
technically,
She can't mandate that we work
with the MCOs.
Uh, but she recognized there was
a
Uh, concern with Kara. So CRA
stands for the comprehensive
Addiction and Recovery Act, and
it's abided.
Uh, develop program that
tries to bring
More resources to families in
which the mom was identified as
potentially having a substance
use issue.
During pregnancy or shortly
before pregnancy.
Um,
And in 2023 of the Kara
families.
So to qualify as a career
family, you have to have had
either substance use in your
pregnancy or at the time of
delivery.
There was a substance found in
your cord blood, uh,
Only 17% of career families were
engaged in any
Uh,
Type of work and that was the
lowest rate in the country in
2023. So the
Managed care organizations were
uh gonna get penalized.
And what
Lola Kellogg said it's all right
in lieu of the penalties.
Which summed up to about
$8,800,000.
Um, we want you, we're gonna
give you a chance to work with
this organization called CBCS.
Of the 4th, uh, and we were just
one of many carer initiatives,
but of the 4000 cara families in
New Mexico in 2023.
There were 300 that no one knew
where they were. And so,
Ah, the task was if we could
find more than 17% of those
families and work with the MCOs.
The MCLs would not have to pay
the penalty, and that's how
We got launched, we launched in
February of this year.
And we're contracted through
December, so for a couple of
more months.
And the next slide, slide number
6 is really
Uh, the slide that speaks quite
loudly to the work that that
Crystal and her team have done.
Uh, we've gotten 374ka family
referrals to date. So and
8 months since February, and
Kara, uh Crystal and her team
have already found over half of
those.
Um,
So well above the 17%.
Threshold and
Understand, these were the 300
of the most difficult of those
400, 4000 families. Uh, I've
been out with Crystal and her
team knocking on doors and uh
mobile.
Holmes, uh, and dirt roads.
Very far from the closest town,
and it's tremendous work they're
doing. It's a voluntary program,
so families have to want to
enroll of those 167.
She and her team have gotten 125
to actually enroll in the
program and
Beyond that, we've gotten half
of those to do a health risk
assessment with the MCO. So,
Uh, everyone, both the, the
Medicaid as well as each of the
MCOs are extremely happy.
With
The the data results that
Crystal and her team have done.
We also have gone a little
deeper to try to learn more of
the story and
Slide number 7.
It's entitled SDOH Social
Determinant of Health struggles.
We found that of the
167 that we've
Found 14%.
are struggling with education
and literacy. This is as defined
by the members themselves, but
in most cases, that means they
have not graduated from high
school.
11% are struggling with
employment, so in most of those
cases, the clients have defined
that as being unemployed.
Uh, a 3.
are struggling with housing.
In economic circumstances.
17% feel they're in an unsafe
physical environment.
And interestingly, only 7%.
So 9 of those individuals have
CYFD. There was a perception.
When we started this program
that these were all going to be
quote unquote CYFD.
Families, and that's really not
the case at all. There are a few
in which CYFD is involved, but
I'd invite you to, to turn to
page number 8 that is our
experience.
In our experience, honestly, is
that substance use disorder is
not the main barrier.
Yes.
You know, each one of these
families has been identified as
Having or had had a recent
struggle with substance.
But it's really the social
determinative health issues, the
issues identified on the prior
slide.
That are the biggest hurdle.
For the families.
We're seeing and
What they have told us is that
the fact that we're flexible.
Were available after hours, were
live.
Speaking with them in their
home.
On site
And addressing their immediate
needs and actually just sitting
down and listening to them.
It's really what they feel has
made a difference and why
they've begun to re-engage back.
With the hospitals in the MCOs.
Um,
Slide number 9, I also
wanted to provide a few
testimonials. The MCOs
themselves, Presbyterian, Blue
Cross Blue Shield, and.
Uh, what was Western Sky, and
now it's Molina and United.
Uh, have told us that yes, we,
you know, they have other care
efforts going on, but
The work we're doing is really
complimenting, getting out and
finding.
The unfound. Uh, they
themselves, and we've had the
The head of Presbyterian out
canvassing with us because
said, you know, what we're doing
in the community, really getting
out and and walking in the
community, knocking on doors,
it's something they're not
doing.
Uh, none of the MCOs is doing
that specific work to find
folks.
And they feel that
Crystal and her team have been
very flexible.
And working
With the MCO was working with
um.
And adapting our work to what
they're doing.
Um, we also had
Senator George Munoz, who chairs
the state finance Committee,
write a letter of strong support
of our program to the healthcare
authority.
And while all that data is good.
Slide number 10
You know, we, we like to share
stories and I'm sure Crystal
could share a number of stories.
Uh, I just wanted to take a
couple of minutes to
To share two that I thought
really highlight.
Some of the work, one is a story
we call our stroller story.
Um,
Crystal actually had found a mom
in an ED with her family at a
visit, uh, because we get
notified.
When one of the clients we're
looking for comes to the ED and
early in the morning, like 2 in
the morning, we got a ping and
so we showed up and
told her about the program and
it's a mom that had a child that
That had some gastric
complications and had a G tube
and it turns out.
A lot of people were looking for
this mom, but she didn't know it
because she didn't have a phone.
And she didn't realize people
were looking for her, so
actually Crystal met her and
Gave her a phone that very night
in the morning in the ER.
And the mom was excited and
stated she wanted to set up
appointments with her PCPs and
get good care for a child, so
Uh, we decided to meet the next
day.
At her home and talk to her and
uh we set up a doctor's
appointment.
And actually set up a ride for
her to the doctor's appointment,
but
Turns out the the ride never
showed up. The Uber.
Actually showed up, but because
the mom had 3 kids, she didn't
have a car seat.
And the Uber was unwilling to
take her to the appointment. So,
This mom called Crystal while
she's
Walking down the street 2 miles
down Central Avenue to get to
her appointment with 3 other
kids in tow, late for her
appointment already.
Bristol
So, look, go back home.
I'm gonna call the PCP. We're
gonna reschedule your
appointment.
And we're gonna get you there.
So, Crystal.
All the FQHC they didn't want to
reschedule, but she insisted and
got an appointment.
For later that afternoon, and
then Crystal went out and bought
3 car seats.
So that we could then get an
Uber and take the mom and her
kids to the appointment.
And you think about the number
of times that encounter could
have failed if no one had been
there to advocate for a
rescheduling of a visit.
If no one had given
The ability to get car seats in
real time. Those are the type of
differences that
Crystal and the team are making.
Um, the other story I like to
share is one we call our roof
story.
Of a mother and
The Santa Fe Rio Riba area, a
grandmother actually, who we
met.
And um with taking care of the
child because the mom.
Uh,
Wasn't around. Mom had left the
child with grandma.
was struggling with substance
issues and
When we met this mom.
Uh, we did a house visit and she
was living in a trailer in Rio
Riba with no roof, the only rum
in the trailer had a rope was
the bathroom, so.
The grandma, this 9 month old
child and a 15 year old
daughter.
We're living in the bathroom at
night with the space heater to
keep warm.
While the rest of the mobile
I didn't have a roof, so our
staff was able to
Work with resources to get some
plywood on the mobile home right
away and subsequently.
Work with
Housing for humanity to get.
More improvements done to the
mobile part, but
Those are the type of
differences.
That crystal and the team are
making.
I'm going to transition to slide
number 11.
That says what what's next? So
we got
Contracted on a 10 month pilot.
To help find care of families,
which we've done, but our
funding ends
In December of 2024 and
We've
Found so many of them found car
families. We actually don't have
enough work now.
To continue
With that, and we'd like to take
advantage of Crystal and her
team to do other.
Activities that are possible. So
when I met with the legislative
Health and Human Services
Committee and got invite from
all of you.
It was centered around where can
we take the work that Crystal
and her team are doing.
Uh, and parlay it into something
bigger. So we know there are
some struggles with emergency
department usage.
In New Mexico, we know there are
struggles with jail recidivism.
Substance and behavioral health
usage.
We don't know all of the
Struggles that all of you are.
Experiencing
In the tribal communities and my
hope is
After I'm done with this
presentation, we can listen to
you and see.
Where there may be opportunities
if, if you
are interested where we could
help as well.
Um, but before going there, I
wanted to share some data from
the state. Slide number 12.
I mentioned the uh
The information exchange that
exists in New Mexico. It's
called
Point click here in every
hospital in the state is
connected to that, and this is
data from 2022.
There were 3800 people in New
Mexico.
With 10
Or more emergency department
visits, several with over 100.
In 2022.
Accounting for over.
€63,000. So,
That's, that's a hideous
problem.
If we have people in crisis that
frequently.
Their issues aren't getting
addressed that they have to come
10 or more times to an ER, but
It's getting worse. The next
slide.
Slide number 13.
Is the data from 2023, a 15%
increase.
From 22 to 23, there's
44,000 people last year.
With 1 or more for a total of
71,000.
Yours.
Now
Putting aside all the
Social issues that lead to that,
all the medical issues that lead
to that if we just look at cost
alone.
And I hate to be just focused on
costs, but
Slide number 14.
A HRQ is the uh agency for
healthcare Research and Quality
in Washington DC.
And every year they determine
the cost of an ER visit for
every state.
And this year,
A New York visit in New Mexico
averages $1,722.
So, for those 71,000.
Visits
The state spent $123 million
just on ER visits.
And generally,
Healthcare costs are considered
to be triple that if you include
all the associated admissions.
Transportation pharmacy costs.
So we're talking close to $500
million on that cohort alone.
But, um,
I want to get back to that in a
second. These are the cohorts
that we work with in most of the
communities, not just the carra
communities and this is data
from
Slide number 15.
Irrespective of if we're dealing
in a suburban environment like
Washington State where I'm at,
or rural environment like Alaska
or uh.
Urban environment like Virginia
and Washington DC.
We've typically produced about a
50% reduction in ER uses.
And admissions.
Repeatedly a different
environment. So what I proposed
to the state, to the LHHS.
Uh, last month was
We want an opportunity to try to
work with the MCOs to find
Those
5000 people.
Ah, we generally, even if we
are conservative and say we're
only going to reduce costs by
30%. 1 team, one of Crystal's
teams will find about 200.
240 individuals, about 20 people
a month.
Uh, that program would cost
about 1.2 million.
And just based on the ER savings
alone, not to mention all the
admission savings, we would save
over 1.5 million, so the program
would pay for itself.
And that was the last slide
that's present, uh, we propose
to
L HSS and the healthcare
authority, a two-year pilot
launching in January.
That would be funded by the
MCOs.
By Medicaid
It would cost $1.2 million a
year and our promise was that
our organization would pay back
if we didn't save.
1.2 million we'd pay back the
difference if
We only saved 1 million, pay
back $200,000 if we only save.
500,000 we'd pay back the
700,000. We are so sure we're
gonna
Save money and do better quality
work that we have provided this
guarantee.
To the state and the MCOs.
And so that was the, this is the
presentation I I gave to the
legislative Health.
And Human Services Committee and
so called last month and
I'm so grateful to get invited.
Here to present the same
Presentation. I want to quiet
down.
And
Uh, crystal and I would love to
answer any questions you may
have.
Thank you. I have Representative
Little for a question.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, my
apologies for being late today
coming in later. Uh, I'm very
glad to be here. I'm Charlotte
Little. I represent New Mexico
House District 68, which is
northwest Albuquerque, actually
just at the Centerville County
border. If you know where uh CNM
Community Colleges on the West
Side campus that is the area
into, um, of Northwest
Albuquerque that I represent,
um, I actually come from San
Feli.
and Taos Pueblos as well. It's
very good to be with all of you
here. Thank you.
My questions are, I've got a
couple. Uh, thank you for the
presentation this afternoon. I
found it quite interesting,
um, in terms of, as you were
saying, um,
Mr. forgive me if I do not.
Pronounce your name actually,
would you pronounce your last
name again, please?
Thank you for asking and Guidos.
I'm uh of Spanish.
There's an accent on the eye
that may not be there. But thank
you for asking. Thank you.
Madam Chair, my questions are,
uh, as you were mentioning Mr.
or Doctor Guidannos, the a lot
of communities, uh, provide a
clinical wraparound services. I
know in the community of San
Felipe Pueblo, there's a and in
several other communities there
is or has been the systems of
care which kind of took this
holistic approach to take a look
at the individuals that were in
need of services and
So, um,
I was curious as to uh how Madam
Chair, my question is, how would
you please expand on how CBCS
interfaces with New Mexico's
tribal communities. I may not
have heard that it's a little
bit difficult to hear. So uh if
you wouldn't mind touching on
that and um
And then the second question,
the second part of this is, it's
really, uh, I appreciated your
synopsis or you're getting to a
summary of the of the numbers of
individuals identified to
Be provided these services. I
also, it's very rare to hear,
uh, maybe it's just me, but it
also seems Madam Chair, it's
quite rare to hear about a cost
savings. Uh, that's from
different services, so, um.
I was wondering as to the number
of people that were identified
and able to be provided
services.
Were they from you all, from
your, from your uh organization,
were they also when as
navigators when you refer them
to these agencies or these
specific entities to receive
these services were they able to
get the services that they need
and I'm curious as to how timely
it was, how effective they were
and um.
And any other information that
might pertain to those services
being provided, Madam Chair. Uh,
thank you. I'll wait for your
response.
Uh, so much representative,
Madam Chair, if you're OK, I
would, I'll
Begin an answer and then I'm
gonna invite Crystal to provide.
But, um, in her experience in
New Mexico, so we
As an organization, when we go
around the country.
We will take anyone an entity
wants us to do. We feel our
mission is to find and connect.
And then we invite uh our
Medicaid partners to determine
who who they're struggling with.
But generally when
Uh,
A plan as people come 5 or 10
times to an ER, those are
considered crisis events.
That, uh, maybe go unfound, and
so that's the cohort that
generally folks ask us to engage
with, but we'll really work
with, with anyone.
Um, we haven't contracted with
the tribal community, and so our
contracts in New Mexico right
now are with the MCOs, with
Presbyterian and Blue Cross Blue
Shield, Western Sky no longer is
there, so they are the ones
giving us.
The names of individuals to go
find they literally every month
give us a list of
care of families, a name and
address.
About a third of the time that
information is accurate.
So that's where we go to work,
is finding out the accurate
information and connecting, uh,
and then once we find them,
If they want to participate,
that's when we do the work of
connecting.
With the existing resources
whether it's an MCO resource or
other resources in the
community. Uh, some of those
individuals on the Blue Cross
Blue Shield and Presbyterians
have been tribal community
members, and so we have done.
Some outreach into the the
The tribal nations, and I think
I will invite Crystal.
Now to Crystal, do you want to
mention anything about your
experiences so far in outreach.
Yeah
That question, so what we do, we
collaborate with whatever MCO.
It is. If it's Blue Cross or
it's uh Presbyterian. We work
hand in hand with them with
their CHWs or community health
workers, as well as our care
coordinators and we are a force
to be reckoned with. We really
work hard with them and then we
start as our team start to reach
out into the community.
And start looking for whatever
it is that our client is in need
of.
And we also, we're very
fortunate with CBCS that we have
any immediate access fund. So if
we do have a client that is in
need for this program in
particular for diapers or wipes
were able to immediately get
that from them, then make the
connection with the resource uh
through the community health
worker or uh the care
coordinator to
To see if there's anything um
that we, we've missed and then
we also try to get them enrolled
in WIC. We educate them on stuff
like that. We educate them as
well if they are receiving SNAP
benefits or Tanic benefits, how
we, we educate them on.
How they can kind of budget for
the formula in the event that
they or diapers if they run out.
Madam Chair, I thank you,
Crystal,
if I may,
Madam Chair, so I, I'm more
curious, I think, since we are
talking about uh here at the
Indian Affairs Committee. I am
interested, Madam Chair, and how
exactly when you've had the
opportunity to interface with
the tribal community without
needing to identify the
community. How have you
interfaced with that that
community, a tribal community,
and the services that might be
available
or maybe not available sometimes
and how you help to navigate
that individual to those
services.
So we definitely have had some
tribal members, um, in, in the
CAO program and what we've done
is we reached out to IHS and
we've collaborated with them,
asked whatever team is working
with that individual. We try to
Connect with them. However,
they're not, we try to connect
the dots. If there's something
that they don't have that they
can, they can't offer, we, we
try to offset that. We've also
have met them, met up with them,
taking them food boxes.
Um, mail them items. We also
mail them items. We have items
just shipped to them from Amazon
or Walmart, so they have the
resources, um, the tangible
resources and they're really
good. Everyone has been really
great in this program reaches
out, they do need something.
If I'd follow up question would
be, uh, um.
Evidence of the numbers of
tribal community or native
participants in this would be
really helpful and uh I was
working off of a one that I
printed at home. It's much
smaller, so I'll check out the
full size uh slide presentation.
So, um, will I find that
information in here, uh, the
native.
Uh, uh.
Individuals who have been sort
of family members who have been
served.
Um, I think it is all together,
but we can definitely put
something together separately
for you. That would be
appreciated.
Thank you.
I think that's uh you answered
my questions. Um, oh, no, the
final question, the second part
of that question was about
identifying the numbers of
individuals and the uh the
description was that if
The dollars weren't all being
used, they were going to be
returned, which is fine. Uh, I
was just wondering, we hear
often about the delay in the
upper uh ability for services to
the opportunity for services to
actually be received and I'm
just wondering if that's an
experience that's also uh
hampering some successful uh um
uh.
There's a people's success or
their family's success in in
overcoming the problems, the
challenges that they're facing.
Um, I'll answer some of that and
I'll definitely leave the rest
for Enrique, but I personally
have not that's why we have that
immediate access fund and if
they need something we're able
to get it for them on the spot.
I'll add to that, Crystal, can
you hear me, Madam Chair. I
think if I need something else,
I'll ask her further. Thank you
very much.
Thank you, Senator Pinto, vice
chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee and thank you
for your presentation. Um, this
is the second time I've heard
it, but the, um, and Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
the reason they kind of really
wanted our particular committee
to hear this is because there
are triggers that are available
that allow you to identify and
I, I'm sure he mentioned it, but
could you mention it again so
that our
I think it's like a data point
or something in the system at
the emergency rooms that
We're able to find out.
Yes, thank you. Can, can you
hear me OK? right now. Enrique,
can you answer that one? Yeah,
can you hear me OK, Crystal?
we're talking about the social
determinants of health. I think
Madam Chair, that there was uh
something about when they go
into the emergency room. Oh, OK.
So we do have a system where
we're alerted, our team is
alerted if one of our referrals
is admitted to the ER. We get
that in real time, we
immediately start contacting the
client and the ER to see what we
can do and how we can get there
and we
Basically show up at the ER,
whatever, whatever time it is,
or unless we talk to the client
and they say, Hey, I did have
one that said, Can you come in
the morning and I went in the
morning after they did a shift
change and identified whatever
needs they had at that moment,
but we get in real time and
alert.
And Madam Chair, members and I
believe that was, that's been
available for quite a few years.
Right? That that they're able
to.
I have this little alert.
Can you hear me? I know it has
been since um I started with the
program, so yes.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, because there is
also, but your point of contact
is at the emergency room or at
the hospital.
Right.
That and the clients call us or
we we get the referrals from the
MCOs and then we start
initiating the outreach, the
engagement.
And then we also get alerts from
the ER. So in addition, if we
have clients that we were unable
to engage with through either a
call because we also canvas. We,
we knock on doors. So if we're
unable, if we're unsuccessful,
which is we've had that um
through canvassing, through
phone calls, through text
messages, through emails, we
often are able to engage with
the client from the hospital.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee, thank you for the
work you do, because in that too
with our early childhood or you
see ECD department and also with
some of the other health issues
we have in New Mexico, um
speaking to you like uranium to
the um.
The cancer.
And
We don't have
The outreach or that that uh we
still need to take more steps to
increase the effectiveness of
our programs that are existing.
So there's more collaboration
that can happen between you and
even our um because I understand
there are some of our eastern
tribes, nations that have
community navigators or
community, they use different
names, but to me it seems like
they
I do the same work in that
sense, but they're very
targeted, but it seems when they
come into the health facility,
we are not really asking the
right questions.
That the screening process is
still not up to date in in in so
that there are people falling
through the cracks. Do we know
if that has been um
Because you're saying if they
say something to the doctor, but
really we're not really asking
the right question. Is that uh
And if you or barrier or
challenge that we need to.
Somehow overcome.
So there is any, uh, I wanna say
generic intake form that has
been provided through the Health
and Human Resources department
that
Questions are asked, but we also
have our own intake form that we
um questions that we ask, and
what makes us different, we
build a different relationship
with them.
Um, we get more personal with
them because we become
I don't want to say their
friend, but we are their friend
in the duration of the time that
they're in the program with us
because again, this is uh
Volunteer, you would participate
as, as much as you want.
And can we identify all things
all the time? Absolutely not.
There's things that the provider
will identify that we can't, um,
and, and vice versa.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee, um,
Did they find that the the
That community aspect that
personal relationship has been
one of the keys in getting
people some of the services that
we have available. We have a low
turnout, but really it's just
you bring somebody outside in,
it doesn't seem to be as
effective as having um cause
from the presentation that um
was given before was that you
guys hired community people, the
familiar faces that are here
within the community that allows
That barrier to be overcome. And
I think that's very important,
but I hope it can be expanded
and um actually do
Because you guys also do not
just, um, it's all resources.
It's not just saying if they
might have cancer that you're
just directing them in that way,
but that you're doing the
holistic.
Right.
Yeah, so right now specifically
for the Kara, we're we're
Working with just babies till
they're 1 year old and family
still they are a year old and
what CBCS does is hire people.
With live experience and only
from the community. I have my
own personal living experience
and I am from the community and
proud, proud of that. And I
think that's what really sets us
aside when we do meet.
Some of our clients that are
really hesitant, you.
Why are you different from the
last person, and I hear over and
over again.
How happy they are with us,
their experience, and we go to
their house, we go to
appointments with them. We have
lunch with them. We really make
it personal and
Sometimes the biggest thing is
just listening.
They don't maybe necessarily
need an item or anything
tangible, but they need somebody
to listen.
And that has really come a long
way with our clients.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and thank you for the
work you do and thank you for
your presentation and I'm sure
there's more we can um
collaborate on.
Thank you. Any further
questions, concerns, committee
members?
Seeing none, thank you for your
presentation.
And we'll move on to the next
agenda item.
Thank you guys.
OK, agenda item number 3, county
and tribal health councils, who
is here?
OK, the team is here. Please
introduce yourselves and welcome
and you may begin.
Good afternoon, Madam Chair,
Representative D Wanda Johnson
and members of the Indian
Affairs Committee. Thank you for
this opportunity to be here with
all of you today. Um, we are uh
representative of the New Mexico
Alliance of Health Councils. My
name is Valeria Larcon,
executive director, Geraldine
Antonio, tribal liaison and
Heather Maxi, Health Council and
public health specialist. Um,
I'd love to begin with a brief
um landing.
Acknowledgement
The New Mexico Alliance of
Health Councils humbly
recognizes and acknowledges we
are on Zia Pueblo lands. We give
thanks to the past, present, and
future sorts of this land and
respect all tribal nations'
sovereignty in offering this
land acknowledgement, we affirm
indigenous resiliency,
self-determination and
self-governance of New Mexico's
pueblos, tribes and nations.
Thank you.
Um, I want to begin this
afternoon, Madam Chair, um, and
members of the committee on
behalf of 33 county and
currently 10 tribal health
councils. We want to thank you
with all of our hearts for your
support and your endorsement
during the last um years interim
session and legislative session,
um, the leadership and support
that you have expressed on
behalf of our local communities
is commendable. Thank you,
Representative Johnson,
Representative Anthony Allison
and all
Of you for your leadership.
Um, I want to begin by first
acknowledging the realities that
we face in our state, once
again, you're, I'm sure very
well aware of the recent um
studies from NEKC Foundation,
um, New Mexico coming in as 50th
worst date to be a child, um,
through the America's Health
Ranking Stud in New Mexico 47th
in education and 50th in health
safety.
Um, the opportunity in this
challenge is that we have the
connective tissue. We have the
instrumental function of public
health already in place to
address public health priorities
in the cross-sectional
priorities of public health and
public safety and many other
areas both at the local level
and at the systems level and
that opportunity is funding
county and tribal health
councils. One of the things, one
of the many, many, um,
advantage.
ages of investing in the
statewide function of public
health is that there's so deeply
aligned with the governor's
priorities, legislative
priorities with NMDOH's North
Star, which is, you may know,
right? We are committed to
making New Mexico the healthiest
state in the entire nation by
2040. This is a quick 15 year
turnaround time and thus it
means we, we need all hands on
deck, and I cannot think of a
better
Partner that is connected at the
local level and at the system
levels to get us there. And so
that renders a very clear
solution, a short term and a
long term strategy, investing in
county and tribal health
councils as the local
community-based health hubs in
service of New Mexico. They've
been serving New Mexico for over
30 years. Um, they remain here
today after being deeply
underfunded for.
13 of those years, um, due to
their dedication and commitment
to communities and honestly,
their resiliency.
Um, if we turn to the next
slide, I'm, we're offering some
infographics that depicts the,
the depth and breadth of
alignment of county and tribal
health councils, of course, with
NMDOH, as we know, our public
health system in New Mexico is a
centralized system. We only have
regional offices. Therefore,
county and tribal health
councils act as an extension of
those regional public health
offices and they're intimately
aware and knowledgeable of what
their community needs are and
where
The opportunities for
collaboration are with care
management organizations, state
agencies, and many other
partners to meet the needs of
communities across their state.
I also want to highlight that
health councils are driving
impact along the lines of
Governor Grisham's priorities
and behavioral health, uh,
firearms safety, aging care,
housing, vaccination, community
outreach, food security, um, if
we think about also the $2
billion
investment that we as a state
made in the new healthcare
authority health councils are so
central to their specific goal
around achieving health equity
by addressing poverty,
discrimination, and lack of
resources and of course health
councils work with state
agencies um to uh connect folks
who are under Medicaid, uh, to
their respective services. Um,
we're also in the planning
phases of being a key partner
with the healthcare.
Authority around the food is
medicine RX program for Medicaid
recipients. Um, and on the
system side, right, if we think
of public health system, uh
health councils are the
connective tissue uh of public
health education, prevention,
intervention, and so forth.
We're also in the planning
process, um, working closely
with the healthcare authority in
the New Mexico social
determinants of Health
collaborative, um, in
establishing a close loop
referral system for Me.
Paid recipients statewide. In
addition, health councils also
update and inform resources in
the Share New Mexico Resource
directory, which also seeks to
connect uh community members to
essential services statewide,
uh, county and tribal, and we've
also convened county tribal
health councils with early
childhood Education Coalition
and Behavioral Health
collaborative so that we can
learn about where the
Overlap in the work that we're
doing together to improve
population health is look at
ways in which we can we can
collaborate to increase the
efficacy in how we serve
communities in a way to
definitely break down silos and
be more effective, um, given
that all these three coalitions
particularly health councils,
are, are significantly
underfunded. We also work with
the Center for Health Innovation
Ana Chica program which focuses
on climate health and with
Other um initiatives such as the
100% New Mexico initiative,
whose successes has been
possible in major part due to
the collaboration they have had
with county health councils. So
my friends, we are in this
together as you can see in this
infographic health councils are
not only uh a critical partner
in public health, but in all
other areas in public health
systems and therefore a
definitely worth
While investment to make. I'm
gonna pass it over to my
colleague Heather Maxey.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
members of the committee for
having us here today. Um, as Val
mentioned, my name is Heather
Maxey and I am the Health
council and public health
specialists with the Alliance,
um, the New Mexico Alliance of
Health Councils and county and
tribal health councils were
thank you established in 1991 by
the New Mexico legislature and
the function of health councils
was reaffirmed in 2019 by HB
137, the county and tribal
Health Councils Act.
So there is a county health
council in each of the 33
councils across the state, and
there are 10 tribal health
councils. Um, Gerrilyn is
working to build relationships
with each tribe and each nation,
um, throughout the state and is
working to develop an additional
3 health councils in those
tribal communities by the end of
this year, um, but to be able to
do that, to be able to support
those additional health
councils, um, additional funding
is.
did
And there is kind of a breakdown
of our funding on the next page,
um and as I mentioned in 2010
health councils were completely
defunded, um, but we want to
thank Governor Grisham and all
the legislative support for
allocating a one-time funding of
30 for health councils, um, for
this fiscal year, but this
funding does end in July of
2025, so.
In 2021, I, we received
interview received CDC and
Kellogg funding at $50,000 per
health council, but that funding
did end in May of 2024 and like
I said, we, the health councils
did receive that one-time
funding of 3 million but that
funding will end, so.
The goal for New Mexico and
Department of Health is for New
Mexico to be the healthiest
state in the nation by 2040, um,
if we want to reach that goal,
we need to provide optimal
funding for health councils,
which are on the ground every
day doing public health work.
I'm doing vital and critical
work. Um, so, for example, um, 2
for optimal funding um in New
Hampshire, which is considered
um by America's Health.
As one of the healthiest states
in the nation in 2021, New
Hampshire allocated 47% or $3
billion of their full state
budget of $8 billion to fund
public health initiatives, and
those were initiatives such as
COVID treatment and prevention,
opioid treatment and prevention,
um, and healthcare.
So the next page talks a little
bit about community membership
of our health councils. So
health councils have different
membership based on their
governance structure. So there
are 4 main types, um, tribal
government, a county or city
government, nonprofit or
physically sponsored and the
membership of each of our health
councils represents the diverse
local communities throughout the
state and as mentioned before,
health councils.
are critical extensions of the
Department of Health, they
provide direct services. They
connect people to critical
resources, they provide advocacy
for health councils.
So there are across the state in
both tribal and county health
councils, 109 paid staff and
those staff are the link between
health councils and the
Department of Health and the
link of public health across the
state.
And so right now, current
funding is providing capacity
for that total of 109 paid staff
members, but providing optimal
recurring funding um will expand
that capacity and help health
councils continue doing the
vital work that they do across
our state.
And the next page you're
probably gonna need to pull out
your glasses for to see what
experience is required for
health council coordinators, but
this is just an overview of the
high level of knowledge and
experience and community
involvement that is required for
someone to serve as a health
council coordinator, and they
have, they do far more for
Their communities then simply
holding meetings, um, as you can
see there's quite the list of
tasks and activities that they
perform in support of their
health councils and other
communities. So I am going to
hand it over now to Glyn.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, um,
Yat A. My name is Geraln Antonio
and I am the tribal liaison, and
so on slide 9, I think you're
all pretty familiar with the
functions of health councils,
um, and I just wanna reiterate
health councils have been um
functioning since the early
1990s. However, in 2019
functions were reaffirmed
through this House bill 137. And
so, um, very briefly, uh.
You know, all of this work
listed on this page around
functions. A lot of this work is
multidisciplinary and
cross-sectional. Uh, we work a
lot in partnership with state
agencies and other statewide
coalitions. And so as Val said,
none of this work can be done
alone. Uh, a lot of the efforts
are focused on health education,
prevention, intervention,
assessment and planning. And so
as you can tell, it's a lot more
than hosting meetings. Um,
there's a lot of planning that
happens and a lot of this work
can
be done without optimal funding,
um, and so health councils right
now are currently funded at
$880,00977 per health council
until July 2025. And so quite
the list, quite, you know, quite
the list of functions and to be
able to carry out this work, um,
we're getting closer to funding
health councils at the level
they need to be. Um, on slide
10, um, in the past, Val and I
have talked about the community
health improvement planning
process that's been, been going.
For quite some time. So for the
1st 2 years of this um community
health assessment and planning.
It's all been funded by CDC and
Kellogg funding at a federal
level. Now, transitioning into
this year, July 1st. What's
great about this is now the DOH
um fiscal year 2025 funding will
now fund the implementation of
those community health
improvement plans, but we'll
also support the evaluation of
this work.
So it's a continuum of the work
that's been going on for the
past 2 years.
And also a side note, um, this
community health improvement
plan has been developed in every
county and in 10 tribal health
councils. All of this work is
being integrated into DOH's
state health improvement plan,
as well as DOH is statewide
community health needs
assessment.
So in addition to getting
community feedback and input,
all of this is um gonna be
supporting a systems level, um,
type of partnership and we'll be
informing the state of all the
things happening and all the
things that are needed at a
local level.
Slide 11, excited to share out
some of those chip priorities
may be familiar information, um,
but as we see no brainer here,
um, red alert, uh, behavior
health is something that county
and tribal health councils have
identified. So 56% of our health
councils have identified
behavioral health as a community
health improvement, um,
priority. You'll see at 13,
excuse me, 11%, um 11% of health
councils are focusing on
housing.
And economic stability, 8% are
focusing on our elder and aging
care um population. Um, another
8% on chronic disease
prevention.
As well as access to quality
healthcare services, and then we
got our bottom two here 6%
focusing on access to healthy
and nutritious foods, 3% of
violence prevention and
firearm-related injuries. So you
can see it's very comprehensive
list of health priorities. Um,
in addition to behavioral
health, which we know is
affecting our community
statewide at all levels and also
at the local level, um, and as
Val mentioned, all of these are
in alignment with the governor's
office.
As well as legislative
priorities.
On slide 12, I'm just gonna give
a a breakdown of our tribal
communities. So of the 10 tribal
communities, um, we work with 9
of them are puelos. One of them
is from Navajo Nation, um, we're
working to enlist 3 Pablos this
year in partnership with DOH. So
that includes Zuni Pablo, uh,
Poa Pablo, and Santa, um, Santa
Anna. So we've got quite the
partnerships um developing right
now.
And our tribal health councils
at this point have identified um
behavioral health is number one,
including substance use
disorders at 44%, um, 33% are
focusing on chronic disease
prevention. So that's
specifically around diabetes.
Um, all of the data, um, is
showing the need for more
diabetes prevention education.
11% of that is elder and aging
care.
And we also have 11% focusing on
access to quality health care
services. Uh, this seems to be
more specific to some of the
partnership with the Indian
Health Services. And so that's
um some of the focus or health
councils have been, have been
addressing.
Um, on the next slide 13,
actually 13 to 15, it's gonna be
a regional breakdown, um, by
tribal, by Metro, Northwest,
Northeast, Southwest and
southeast. And so if you take
the time to look here um on page
13, you'll see in our tribal
areas, I know we've got a chance
to look at that. Behavioral
health is number one in our
metro region, we are also seeing
health council identify
behavioral health as a top
priority.
Um, on the next slide here on
16.
There's been a little bit of a
shift in the Northwest region,
um, being the number one
priority around healthcare, um,
access to quality health care
services.
However, in our northeast,
Southwest and southeast um
regions.
Behavioral health again is
number one across the board. So,
um, these charts are really
great to look at if you have a
chance and don't want to break
it down entirely right now, but
it gives you, you know, some of
the priorities on, on, um, you
know, depending on region and
and whatever uh district you
also represent, taking the time
to look at that as well.
Um, slide 15 here, I'm just
gonna end very quickly for a
handoff, um, but we are also
focusing on climate health as
well, looking at the impacts of
that at the community level. So
some of our health councils have
been funded federally by the
Office of Minority Health to do
a pilot project, um, to focus on
policies that influence health
and specifically on drought. So
looking at some of our
communities who experienced the
most drought, and they're
focusing on a priority around
public
Water systems and so some of our
communities, um, based off
health council feedback, feel
that some communities are not
informed of water violations,
um, are not receiving
notifications in time at a
county and tribal level. So in
addition to some of this
community health improvement
work that's been happening, um,
climate health is also a
priority.
Um, slide 16. So some of our
chip priorities, you can see
based off county or tribes, um,
what strategies are most
prevalent. And as you can see at
a county level, um, access to
services is number one, doing
information and education is
too.
But on our tribal side, with our
tribal health councils, there's
tons of information in education
happening. Um, there is also
data collection happening. Uh,
we run into an issue with our
tribal health councils.
Not being able to access tribal
relevant data, um, a lot of the
data at the state is very county
based, so that poses a lot of
challenges, but what's been
great is that as Ja, the
Albuquerque area southwest
tribal epicenter has been able
to fund tribal health councils
at 35,000 to do comprehensive
health assessments. And so Aztec
has been funding um more of a
comprehensive type approach to
assessment, um, in addition to
what DOH has been funded.
It has been funding health
councils. And then you'll see
number 3 on the tribal side is
the policy work happening. As
you know, it's important to
inform and educate our tribal
leaders um on some of the work
that's happening at the ground
level and so what's great is our
tribal health councils have been
keeping um governors, lieutenant
governors, and tribal councils
informed about all of their
successes, um.
So I'll just pass back to Heller
to talk about some of the
impacts.
Thank you, Jerilyn, and thank
you again, Madam Chair and
members of the committee. So as
you're limiting, I'm going to be
speaking to some of the impacts
of those community health
improvement plans, um, and these
are going to be the next couple
of slides, so you feel free to
review those. I'm just going to
go over a few of the highlights.
So there were over 4600 Narcan
lifesaving kits distributed and
over 1800 trainings provided to
community members to administer
Narcan. There were also
Almost 1200 community members
and partners who were trained in
mental health first aid. There
were over 1200 behavioral health
resource guides distributed to
households and share, New Mexico
Behavioral Health resources.
So this, these next two slides
just cover the work that health
councils have been able to do
with limited funding and their
work, the work the health
councils do is far above and
beyond the two deliverables in
the scope of work from the
Department of Health. So just
take a look at these next few
slides and just imagine if
health councils were funded with
recurring optimal funding the
work and the impact that they
could achieve when they've
already done so much with
limited funding.
Um, for
Access to affordable housing um
in Los Alamos, they were able to
provide almost 6000 community
members who were living in 10
cities with social service
related needs. They were also
able to provide um over $26,000
of in-kind gift cards, uh, for
food, for gas, for different
necessities, um, to those
individuals who were
experiencing homelessness or who
were at risk of becoming
homeless in the community and
also for
For access to healthy and
nutritious foods. Uh, there is
over almost 250,000 pounds of
food distributed to community
members by health councils and
over 24,000 food boxes also
distributed to households all
through the work of health
councils.
Also that was over only a 10
month span.
So over an 8 month span um in
for elder and aging care, there
were over 400 elder assessments
performed um for those the older
population.
And in my personal experience,
um, professionally, I have
worked in health departments in
two different states and I
worked on a grant for North
Carolina for smoking cessation,
and I've seen the impacts that
sufficient funding for
these community organizations
can have on the health outcomes
of communities. So seeing
everything here in New Mexico, I
know that with sufficient
funding, we really could be the
healthiest state.
Um, in the next 15 years. So
thank you all and I will hand it
back over to V.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Johnson, members
of the Indian Affairs Committee
and to my team members for this
thorough overview. We look
forward to your questions and uh
comment, but I just wanted to
comment on a couple of things is
that what we know to be true is
that health is not
compartmentalized, right? Health
is intersectional, and this is
the value to the health councils
bring to the table in that
they're comprehensive community
focused and multidisciplinary
approach.
To improving public health
population. So as you can see,
our state is so well positioned
to improve the quality of life
and health of every New Mexican
in our state, um, we clearly
have the dedication. We clearly
have the commitment. We clearly
have the lived experience and
diverse representation, um, and
expertise and most importantly,
the readiness and capability to
do this work. All we need is
The reinstatement of recurring
optimal funding for county and
tribal health councils, um, as
recent as I think it was August
this year, Representative
Thompson did submit a funding
request to legislative Finance
Committee uh for review and
consideration and approval for
FY 2026 of $12 million. Now I
would love for us to imagine,
right, a $12 million averaging
250,000 per health councils in
in an ideal world of recurrent
funding, but in the most perfect
world in service of community
members across our entire state,
counties and tribal communities.
Imagine having health councils
physical health hubs. Imagine
health councils providing
transportation to a community
members to the resources they
need. Imagine health councils
having telemed on site, mental
services, behavioral services,
uh,
Delivering food much like they
are right now, but at a higher
scale. Imagine these local
community-based health hubs
fully resourced to meet the
needs of community members at
the scale that is currently
needed. I think something that
is really um critical to
underline here is that this kind
of investment is ready to make a
significant difference now
within the next 12 months, in
the next fiscal year and for
years to come, getting us closer
to our
Star, New Mexico as the
healthiest state in the nation.
Thank you, Madam Chair,
Representative De Wanda Johnson,
members of Indian Affairs
Committee, um, we're open for
questions, reflections,
comments. Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you for your
presentation and we have Senator
Souls.
Thank you, Madam Chair. This is
an area very near and dear to me
and that I'm part of starting
the 100% community initiative
around in the original one down
in Las Cruces, resilience
leaders, uh, so please, any of
my questions don't take
personally.
Because I'm impatient.
Uh, we've been doing this for 5
years and as a state we continue
to underfund everything while
having lofty goals for what we
think and need and want to do.
And, uh, Madam Chair, let me
start with, we last year had
cash reserves of somewhere
around 35%.
Each 1% of cash reserves is
$1000.
And so lowering the cash
reserves by just 1% this year, I
think their target is 25%, but
that's still almost 10% higher
than is recommended by the, the
rating agencies, but every 1% is
$1000.
And yet it seems like even the
request that's being asked of
120.
is nowhere near what's needed,
and we can afford it. We are a
wealthy state.
So my question, how much are you
all asking for in the executive
budget through Department of
Health to fund community health
centers.
Thank you, Senator Souls, and
just so you know, we're also
deeply aligned with 100% New
Mexico. We're in this together
and I've been in conversations
with both co-founders as ways
and we can further collaborate
because there's so much
alignment essentially in some
areas duplication of, of work,
and I think if we come together
and be very strategic in how
this collaboration can pan out
locally, we can achieve more
faster in service of New Mexico.
So, um,
What is being asked this year's
12 million. At the scale that
our community needs, our health
councils to function at should
really be at $1000 each in my
professional opinion, but I
think giving um
You know, the, the fact that
we're seeking to enlist the the
government to make steps into
the right direction. Um, that's
what we're leaning towards and
of course we would not be here
today if it wasn't for all of
you, um, your support in this
last uh legislative session for
the first time in 13 years,
funding health councils. So
thank you, uh, Madam Chair
Johnson, Representative Johnson,
and Senator Sols for, for your
support. Uh, I hope I answered
your question.
Madam Chair, yes, I think 12
million is insufficient unless
that is just for the health
council because the needs in
communities are way above that,
and we're not asking for that
money either. And so we're, uh,
some of my frustrations are when
we do surveys of the need, and
we come back with that and we
look and it's like.
The needs there, but we're not
putting money into the
solutions. You know, we all
wring our hands and go, oh,
we're a poor state. We are not a
poor state. We can fund anything
and everything we choose to
fund. It's just not the priority
of a lot of people who are
doing, who are on the, the
budget committees as far as the
funding to take care of people.
Sorry, I'll get off that part of
the soapbox, um.
I looked up Donana County and
the community uh group there.
And it had some data, where is
the data coming from? Who's
doing the local surveys as you,
if you're working with 100%
communities, one of the first
things is figure out where the
problems are.
Yet the one in Donana County
doesn't seem to be aligned with
the surveys being done by the
100% community or the resilience
leaders.
Thank you, Representative Souls,
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I'm gonna answer part
of that question and then I'm
gonna turn to either Gerrilyn or
Heather, um, the, the function
of health councils includes
community-based health
assessments and that's what CDC
funding made possible during the
pandemic and that took about a
year and a half to 2 because it
it takes time to bring community
together and collaborate on this
effort, uh, moreover too with uh
leadership and also county
commissioners and other key
partners at the local level. Um,
my understanding, there's again
alignment between the community
health assessment process of
health councils and the
assessment tools that 100% New
Mexico, for example, conducts
the latter is more prescribed,
whereas the former is more
community-based in partnership
with various entities and I
think if we look at that child
assessment and aligned it.
With the assessment that
Let's say in this case 100% New
Mexico and other partners
conducted. I will bet that
there's a lot of synergies
there. And so Geraldine, I know
you have been involved in that
job process if you like to add
to that context. Thank you.
Madam Vice Chair, and uh Senator
Souls, yes, so at least specific
to your question about Donana
County, um, the way the process
worked out for them, um, they
worked in partnership with their
local county health department.
And so the health council also
serves in partnership with them
to release the survey. Um, also,
in addition to that, some of the
work that has happened is that
um they have been able to work
with DOH Eppies.
And so DOH EPs provided support
in providing county-level data.
In addition to that, the Center
for Health Innovation, uh,
Public Health Institute provide
data dashboards for each county
as well. So those were kind of
some of the functions uh or
different types of methods of
data collection and assessment.
Madam Chair, yeah, I went online
and looked and that's not what's
on the dashboard or at least
what shows up when you Google
that and go to their website.
Um, I was just Friday at the
meeting where they had the new
data from the resilience leader,
the 100% community group there,
which is very different from
what they put on the other one,
and I'm just wondering who's
putting that together and based
on what, because the resilience
leaders group has
Very detailed data, you know,
and very, uh micro level of data
where the stuff that's on their
website sounds more like people
got together and said, well,
mental health is a problem.
Let's put that down as a, as a
main issue.
Without real numbers behind it.
So again, I'm not criticism of
you all, but frustration that it
seems like a couple of groups
that are working.
Kind of in parallel without
overlapping nearly as much as
they can. The data that 100%
community and the number of
people they surveyed.
is very detailed and across the
entire county.
Madam Chair, and, um, Senator
Souls, um, I definitely think
there's an opportunity, well,
nothing. I have been working to
collaborate um with 100% New
Mexico at the local and systems
level for obvious reasons and
the ones that you have noted
here. I know that for a
significant number of the local
county health councils who have
partnered with the 100% New
Mexico rendering their success
in their initiatives. They have,
as a result,
Of their priorities and 100% New
Mexico priorities created action
teams to focus on specific
whether it's food security or
essential services. So there is
a lot that's coming out of some
of the individual partnerships,
but as a system, as a whole to
collaborate and integrate and be
more efficient. Um, that's
something that I um continue to
invite that conversation. I, I'd
love to partner with you on
that, Senator Souls. Thank you,
Madam Chair, members of.
And Madam Chair, thank you, and
I'll talk to you kind of offline
about specific ones there, but
the frustration and the
impatience comes that we have
lots in the system area and we
need to get more actually out to
people to change health outcomes
instead of just setting up
bureaucratic systems about
health and around that. And so
I'll leave it at that. Thank
you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator Souls.
Representative block.
Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank
you all for your presentation.
You always do a great job and
the health councils are doing
the Lord's work, so I appreciate
them. So, Madam Chair, I just
have a couple of quick questions
about, I'm just on page 11, but
not necessarily anything
detailed on page 11, but I did
see that it says like 8%.
Of what we want to focus on is
aging and elder care, and Madam
Chair, I'm just wondering
because I know the population in
New Mexico is getting older very
quickly. And so I'm wondering,
Madam Chair,
Why is it such a low percentage
or is that maybe factored into
other things cause I see
behavioral health is huge with
56%. What, what portion of that
includes folks who are also
elders, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Madam Chair. um
Representative Locke for that
question. I think something that
we need to consider, especially
in this process, right? It's
also the assess assessment of
the capacity of that health
council. So although the need of
absolutely elder and aging aging
care is great. We look at our
tribal communities, our county
communities, um, the capacity of
health councils at this moment
may not meet the actual need,
which is something that we're
advocating every year.
Let's resource this critical
function of public health at the
local and systems level so that
we can really serve in this
case, our elder population at
the scale that they need to be
served at and of which we do
have those connections and
intimate understanding and
knowledge of their challenges,
but having the resources needed
to really have those elements in
place to take care of them is
the gap that we're seeking to
bridge. Here, I'll turn to
Gerallinen and Heather and see
if there's additional.
Context to provide.
Yeah. And just to give context
on the elder and Asian care, you
know, some of those specific
goals and objectives is to focus
on dementia caregiver support,
um, bringing home care services
back to communities,
specifically in our tribal
communities, they feel that's
really important, uh, in
addition to that, another big
thing is how to support with
Medicaid and Medicare enrollment
among our elder population. Um,
I think they always say, our
elders see the turquoise fold.
They want, they, they're not
gonna open it until the CHR will
come to the home. So that's the
time that they'll talk about,
oh, I got this envelope, um, but
I lost my Medicaid or, you know,
I haven't, I need support with
getting Medicare, so some of
those things are some of the,
some of the focuses around elder
and aging care, um, but yeah,
no, I think Val spoke about
capacity around these areas and
what's great about these
priorities is these are
identified through um community
members, um.
We had a lot of our tribal
communities and counties work
with their senior centers around
focus groups around some
specific challenges with this.
Thank you so much, Madam
Chairman. Thank you for that,
that answer. That's good to
hear, and I think that that's
probably a big issue, especially
in rural New Mexico, tribal
communities making that
connection because a lot of the
time, a lot of folks, they, they
don't really have time because
they're going to medical
appointments or they're, they're
busy with family to actually
learn how to enroll and also if
they're disenrolled, that just
creates so much.
trauma for somebody to have to.
Call in 1-800 number and wait
for someone to answer. I think
we could probably do a lot
better on that and I, I
appreciate your work on this and
I thank you, but also behavioral
health is huge and thanks for
focusing on that as well. So
thank you, Madam Chairman.
Thank you, Representative.
You, Madam Chair.
Thank you for the another
excellent presentation.
Ever since I was introduced into
the legislature in 2019.
It seems that every session I
was introducing legislation
supporting health councils.
And each time it falls just
short. We run out of time.
Or it passes the house, but it
doesn't make it to the Senate
floor.
The same thing happened with
Elspiel 137.
There was an agreement made in
the House Appropriations
Committee for 3 million was
allocated under the Department
of Health.
At that same session,
There was a new
Entity develop the healthcare
authority.
Everything that
The healthcare authority said
that they would do.
is already being done by the
healthcare health councils.
We don't want repetition.
We don't want to do the same
thing over and over.
When it's already been done. All
the hard work has been done.
To my knowledge,
The task of the
Health council
Addresses the grassroots
solution.
The problems that is seen by the
grassroots people are best
handled by the grassroot people
and that's what the health
council is doing.
The last appropriation of 3
million was made.
In the House Appropriations and
the bill still did not.
Get a full House hearing, nor
did it make it into the Senate
floor, but we still had an
agreement, so
My bill was, I was the primary
sponsor of that bill. I was
asking for a 6.7 million. We
only got half of that and since
3 million is better than none,
we had to settle for it. We had
no choice but to.
Now
With the building of the new
healthcare authority saying that
they're going to do exactly the
same thing that the healthcare
authority has is already doing.
I have
pleaded when we get
presentations by the new
director, Secretary Armijo.
I've been pleading with her, why
don't you just
Enlist the help of the health
councils. That way you don't
have to do any duplicate work
already. You're trying to
duplicate something that's
already in progress. Let's, you
just get together with them and
uh finalize everything, make
them apart under your umbrella,
give them the money that they're
asking for and
I'm just wondering if uh she has
reached out to you because she
said that she was going to reach
out to you, uh, and those
legislative finance committee
meetings. I think I have the
support of my colleague, uh,
Senator Shindo. He was
supporting that as well. We were
asking in the LFC that we wanted
to make that a recurring
expenditure every year.
I think that is a good idea to
make a recurring uh expenditure
every year because
After December, I'm not going to
be around to make, to introduce
any more legislation pleading
for funding healthcare. So I'm
asking my colleagues at the
table today, make it a recurring
expense for the health councils.
So we do not have to introduce
legislation every year to keep
it going.
Uh, just a commentary. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you for
the presentation.
Thank you, Chennai.
Uh, uh, Senator Shendo.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for the presentation.
Um,
Just quickly and, and remind me
again, I know that uh
Out of the uh.
19 pueblos, we only have 9
pueblos that have health
councils. So how do the rest of
the other Pueblos, how are they
engaging? What's your work with
them and how are they operating
or is it or is anything
happening at all?
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
Senator Shendo, so we even
listed the 10, um.
Just a little fun fact here when
I started back in 2020. I've,
I'm the first relison ever for
this organization. So there's
been a lot of relationship
building, um, at the time when I
came on to my role, there were
54 active tribal health
councils. I was able to enlist 6
in in the matter of 32 years and
so my work at least now, um, and
I do this in partnership with
DOA Health Promotion is we uh
make an opportunity to go to
Health
go to tribal communities. Um, we
work with the CHR Association,
um, different CHRs to talk about
what health councils are and
what they do, um, another part
of our outreach is working with
the Al Pablo Council of
Governors. So for the past two
years, we've been able to enlist
their support on behalf of
tribal health councils and
asking for additional funding.
And so sometimes those are
opportunities when governors or
lieutenant governors approach us
and say,
A health council sounds like a
good idea in our community. So
sometimes that's, you know, the
different methods that we do,
but really it's going out to
communities, um, reaching out to
CHRs or their health
departments. Um, so that's been,
that's been one of our good
methods. As far as Navajo
Nation, we've also been able to
enlist him for the past 2 years,
um, resolution in support of
funding for tribal communities,
um, it's been a little bit slow,
to be honest, moving on that
front.
Um, we've been asked to meet
with the Navajo Nation
Department of Health, um,
director, and so we've been
reaching out now for about 4
months. So it's been a
standstill, but um we continue
to reach out and we've had some
support from um some Navajo
Nation Council delegates as well
for tribal health councils on
Navajo land.
Um, and as far as Apaches, we've
also engaged with Apache
nations, um, at this time,
Mescalero denied a health
council at the time, health
councils were funded at 15,000
and so.
They felt with 15,000, that's
we're paid pennies for all of
these deliverables. We respected
the decision, but now that we're
um advocating for additional
funding. We're hoping that we
can enlist, you know, additional
tribal communities. So that's
part of our work is trying to
get more funding and also
requesting DOH at the leadership
level to include a growth rate
because we have so many tribal
communities who have not had a
health council developed. And a
lot of that is because
The funding.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. And,
uh, so, so the follow-up
question, so for those tribes
that.
Uh, that don't have health
councils, are they doing their
own work?
Or do their own funding or
they're just not doing anything?
What's your
Uh, Madam Chair and Senator
Schendo, so at least in my
experience, the work seems to be
happening. Um, what we do is
when we typically engage with
leadership and talk about a
health council, they typically
will refer us to the CHR lead or
the human services um director,
uh, health department director.
And so we see that the work is
happening, but um we can see
it's more programmatic at a
community level, meaning maybe
federally funded
Whatever the means is, but what
happens is when we talk about
health councils is we're able to
bring in community so that way
community can serve on a tribal
health council because the work
that's happening at the health
department, um, you know, that's
under the tribal administration,
but what we advocate for is when
we bring a health council to a
community that there is
community membership.
So the work's happening, but
part of our role is to advocate
for community participation
input and feedback on what where
the funding needs to go, what
the needs are, where are there
gaps in services, um, and gaps
in, you know, resources, maybe
we don't know enough about our
tribal programs. So how can the
health council support that?
Uh, so, so, Madam Chair, uh, so
what you're asking for, uh, I, I
think is, you know, probably
inadequate. I think that both of
my colleagues have said because
if you're excluding, you know.
You know, half of the pueblos
from this, and if they do come
on board, you know, the adequate
resources are not there and I
appreciate uh the comment from
uh Representative Allison, we're
gonna miss him. I know he's been
a champion of this and hopefully
we can, uh, the rest of us can
do justice and and carry this
fight forward, you know, because
this is very important for us in
our respective communities. So,
uh, uh, thank you, uh,
Representative Allison for he's
certainly gonna be missed, you
know, in January for.
All the advocacy and the work
that you've done on behalf of
this organization uh as well, so
thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Senator, I absolutely
agree with your comments
regarding uh continuing to
support the health council, and
then of course, carry on the
work that uh representative.
Allison, uh.
Spearheaded and worked so hard
on our behalf. Thank you for
your presentation. I don't have
any questions. I know your work
and I know you will continue to
do good work and uh I'm pretty
sure we're all in support of um
moving forward in the, in the
January session with whatever it
is that you need, please come by
our office.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. uh Representative Johnson
in all members of Indian Affairs
and a special thank you from all
of us, Representative Anthony
Allison, we will not be here
today if it wasn't for you.
Thank you.
OK, colleagues and audience.
Uh, agenda item number 4 update
from Sandval County.
Who is here?
Please come forward, introduce
yourselves and we are ready to
hear your presentation.
Your update
OK, please uh feel free to
begin.
There we go. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Um, and welcome to
Sandoval County. Uh, my name is
John Buttrick. I'm the deputy
county attorney for Sandoval
County, but more importantly for
the purposes of this, uh, uh,
presentation, I'm the supervisor
of the, uh, the county's tribal
liaison program.
So thank you for having us and
welcome to Sandoval County. Um,
wanna send a special greeting to
representatives Zamora. I
remember our time, you know, uh,
when I was working for the House
minority, so thank you so much
for coming to Sandoval County
and welcome.
Yes, uh, and I also want to take
a special note to, you know,
appreciate all the members of
the Legislative council service
who are here. I worked a summer
as one of their interns uh
during law school. And so I know
all the work that can that uh
goes into, you know, preparing
just one of these meetings. So
thank you so much, uh, counsel
service uh members so yes.
Um,
Before we get into the
presentation, I also wanted to
introduce a county manager Wayne
Johnson, who's in the audience
and uh county uh man uh uh
attorney Michael Eschen. So
after our presentation and after
we stand for questions, I wanted
to give them an opportunity to
address the committee to talk
about Sandoval County more
generally and the different
projects that we're working on
as well. So, um, so with that,
um, let's just get into it. So
the Sandoval County uh tribal
liaison program. The purpose of
the program is promoting the
overhaul.
Health, well-being, and
prosperity of the Native
American residents and
well-being of the residents of
Sandoval County.
And also, before I get started,
I also wanted to introduce uh
the tribal liaisons here. Evelyn
Sandoval, um,
Sheila Herrera and Tamara
Sandia. I'm going to give them
an opportunity at the end of my
presentation to address the
committee as well, so.
So there are 10
Yes.
Thank you.
So in Sandoval County, there are
10 pueblos and 2 tribal nations.
So let me try if I can uh tell
you these by memory, um, let's
see here, Cody.
Santa Ana
Santo Domingo.
San Felipe Sandia.
Zia Hemes Laguna, Samuel De
Fonso, and Santa Clara.
And then in terms of the tribal
nations, the hickory Apache and
the Navajo Nation.
So
Yes.
So, um, and of course today
we're in the Pueblo Zia so we
thank the Pablo Zia very much
for having us today.
Uh, and tomorrow, of course, you
guys are gonna be in the Pueblo
of Santa Ana, and the next day,
so you're going to be here in
Torrance in Sandoval County for
a couple more days. So, thank
you. So, uh, first and foremost,
uh, who is the tribal liaison
program, so I've already
introduced them to you by name,
Evelyn San Sandoval is the uh
Navajo and Hickory Apache tribal
liaison, she provides services
to 3 Navajo chapters, the
counselor Ojo Encino and Tooron
Star Lake, and the hickory
Patchy in Sandoval County and
offers translation services in
the Navajo language, the din.
Sheila Herrera is the Kist
tribal liaison. She provides
services to the pueblos of
Cocheti, Laguna, San Felipe,
Santa Ana, Santa Domingo, and
Zia in Sandoval County and
offers translation services in
the Keri language. Tamara Sandia
provides services. She's the Toa
tribal liaison, she provides
services to the pueblos of
Hemes, Sandia, and Sandia in
Sandoval County and offers
translation services in the Toa
language. Evelyn is a member of
the Navajo Nation and the Oho
Encino chapter.
of the Navajo Nation. Sheila is
a member of this pueblo, the one
we're in now, Zia.
And Tamara is a member of the
Hemes Pueblo.
So the point that I'm trying to
make here is all three of our
tribal liaisons are community
members. They're not just
somebody that we hired off the
street. These people are down
there in the community. They
know what's going on at ground
level and they get their hands
dirty every day and work with uh
the, the tribal members, the
leaders, the residents.
Anyone else that works with the
the tribes and the pueblos,
anyone who wants to work with
us. They, they're, they're
there, they understand the
community heartbeat and they
know what's going on.
So what is it exactly that the
tribal liaison program does.
So it was initially established
to provide just voting and
election education services to
the county's Native American
communities, the try, uh, but
then later the tribal liaison
program uh was created and
expanded to the to what we know
it is now.
Uh, today our tribal liaisons
meet and collaborate with Pueblo
and tribal leaders, community
members, and residents to
address many important issues.
The program is part of the
Sandoval County's legal
department.
So I'm gonna give you a little
more detailed briefly, uh, but
just, just to start, they do
voter registration. They do, uh,
they offer voter uh absentee
applications and then they
collect those later. They do
voter awareness drives, uh, just
a lot of different things, um.
They go to schools and they talk
to the teenagers and uh and
young children about the
importance of voting.
And what's important about that
is
We, we know that those people
can't vote because they're not
at 18 a lot, a lot of times, but
what they do is they take that
message home to their parents
and their grandparents and their
and the people that they're
related to, and they get that
message to the people who can
vote. So that's why that's
important.
So we've talked a little bit
about who exactly the tribal
liaison program serves.
Um, and I trust that you have,
uh, the, the slides in front of
you. So I'm on slide 4 and it's
a pictorial version of the
county and it shows all the
different and it's this uh what
looks like this right here.
And so it shows on uh via map,
you know, where all the
different pueblos and tribal
communities are located in
Sandoval County. So as you know,
Sandoval County is a huge
county.
We touched both Bernlio County,
you know, in the center of the
state, and we also touch uh San
Juan County and the far
northwest corner of the state.
Um,
So the Pueblos are more toward
the east and the center of the
county, whereas the nations are
more toward the west and the
north part of the county.
So I didn't know if you knew
this, but according to the
Indian Pubblo Cultural Center,
there are a total of 19 pueblos
in the entire state of New
Mexico. And I, as I've already
mentioned to you, 10 of those
are within Sandoval County, so
we have over half of the
pueblos, at least in terms of
land in our county.
Um,
So I don't know if any of you
happen to know.
On my, on the slide that I put
together, it says that we're
the, we have the 2nd most tribes
and Pueblos of any county in the
entire United States.
Does anyone happen to know who
is first in the nation?
It's San Diego County,
California.
Which has 18 tribal communities.
Now, from what I understand it
in San Diego County, California,
it's only 200 square miles.
Given the size of Sandoval
County and the size of the
different tribes and puebs
within our county. I would
venture to say that we have more
than 2000 square miles.
So,
Talking a little bit about what
we do more specifically in
addition to voting services.
Um, the tribal liaisons work
with the tribes and pueblos on
alcohol and drug abuse and
behavioral health. I know that
they are on calls with the local
collaborative every couple of
weeks.
Uh, we work with the
governments, uh, the different
tribes and rebel governments uh
with different contracts
regarding road maintenance for,
for instance, and cross
commission of, of, of officers.
Uh, education, economic
development, emergency medical
services, fire and rescue. I
know that we're right now
looking at partnerships with AA
and the Hickory Apache Nation
right now in regards to those
items, uh, horse grazing,
missing indigenous people,
public safety, tourism,
renewable energy, and right of
way issues.
Transportation arose, as we've
mentioned, and then also we can
try to connect veterans to
veteran to benefits to which
they are entitled.
And then also, like we said, you
know, uh, voter services.
No two days are the same.
These these liaisons, as they
will tell you here shortly, you
know, they're, they're they're
there on the ground level and
they're working their hardest
and uh it, you know, every day
is different. So they enjoy
their work very much. I know
because I talked to them every
week, certainly, and, and
sometimes every day.
So at this point, um, I do want
to give each of the tribal
liaisons an opportunity to
address the committee and uh
we'll start with uh Evelyn
Sandoval and then we'll turn to
Sheila Herrera, and then we'll
end with uh Tamara Sandia, but
after that, uh, we would stand
for any questions and then after
we stand for questions, I wanted
to like, like I said, open it up
to county manager Johnson and
the county attorney Eshelman to
address anything more generally
for the county.
So thank you.
Evelyn, go ahead.
Uh, good afternoon, Madam Chair
Renaldo.
Committee
Yeah, they shot it.
Um,
I am a Navajo. I live in always,
you know.
Chapter area in the community
there. That's all in Santa Claus
County.
And oh it's, you know, chapters
located within McKinley County.
It's located in McKinley County,
but we have a contract to do.
We have a precinct there so
that.
Our county can vote for Sandoval
County.
Candidates
But first of all,
I am Evelyn Sandoval.
chain.
Aha.
Proper introduction for Navajos
that are here.
But anyway, I um, I do work with
the um the three chapters that's
located in Sandoval County,
which is Torreonar Lake.
Chapter, counselor chapter, and
oh Eino chapter.
And a portion of the um
Hickory Apache Nation is in
Sandoval also, which I have been
in contact with which we're
trying to do.
Collaborative work with them
also.
We do get involved by being
proactive with voter
registration outreach.
Home visits if necessary.
Voter registrations.
We collaborate with tribal
programs to encourage personal
development to create innovative
solutions to achieve and meet
the basic needs of water,
electricity, adequate housing.
And improving road conditions.
We communicate openly with the
tribes from an executive level
down to the grassroots to
advocate for our communities and
our people, but most
importantly, we will always
provide native language
interpretation.
Which is a necessity in this
job. This job is very awesome
because it can carry you.
And so many different directions
and.
Find out
What the dire needs are within
each community, white families
are going through and trying to
provide and reach out for
services.
For the Navajo area it's all the
way into McKinney County, San
Juan County.
And then we are in the issuing
agency part of it, so we have
very limited um safety. Um.
Police protection.
A lot of the times, we will get
an officer out there a day later
after they've been called in
cases of domestic violence or
anything?
Alcoholism is a huge problem.
We are losing a lot of young
people through suicide drugs.
So these needs are not gonna go
away. So those are the areas
that I concentrate on within my
communities.
Thank you so very much for
giving me this opportunity.
That's tell you just a little
bit about the communities that I
serve. Thank you.
Koiho.
Welcome to Zia Pueblo. Um, I'm
Sheila Herrera. I am from Za
Pueblo.
I am the carers tribal liaison,
and I work with the Puerbos of
Cocheris.
To Domingos Felipe Santa Ana,
Zia, and Laguna.
Our program, it's not just voter
rights anymore. Uh, we handle,
um, government to government
relationships between the county
and the Pueblos.
And that's one big change that
we've had to work with.
And it's been
It's been kinda rough trying to
get out there to get the
information needed to
To get these duties done, but
we're doing the best that we can
at this time.
Um,
Our services
Our services include the um as
John mentioned the education
fire rescue.
Transportation, no roads.
And right now, um, in the
different quibbles I address
those issues and as, as needed
to assist the pueblo, so they
need to communicate with the
county.
And right now, our biggest thing
is voter rights, voter awareness
and the pueblos being that it's
the presidential election.
Uh, we've been out there doing
motor drives, um, working with
the absentee ballots.
And the one thing that I enjoy
is being able to get out there
to the Pueblo's as in the past
few years, we haven't been able
to meet person to person.
So right now, that's one thing
that I enjoy, getting out there
and eating the leadership and
the programs that each p Pueblo
has.
I
pretty much all I have right
now.
Thank you for having me.
Good afternoon, Annamo.
Committee members. Um, my name
is Tamara Sandia Deno.
Um, I'm from the puelo of famous
and I am the tribal liaison
who's the Tola I speak Tolah and
so I'm in the he puelo, um,
community and Sandia. I've also
helped in covered Navajo Nation
with Evelyn and also um with
Sheila too cause I'm the newest
out of all three of us, I just
started in May, so I kind of hit
the ground running um because we
came in.
For the elections in June. I
just started in May and so I've
been kind of pushing a lot, the
voter registration and
education, so my job, I've been
doing a lot of outreach, um,
getting the word out and like
they said doing voter
registrations, um, doing
absentee ballots, and one thing
is that I'm pretty proud of is
uh in the Hamous community is a
lot of our tribal members are
registered, um, our registered.
Voters are already, so I'm going
around and giving.
Um, registration to those who
aren't on the list that I, I
know because that's the one good
thing about us being within the
communities, we get to know our,
our tribes that we work for, so
it kind of gives us a hands up
and to who we need to make
contact with and um I think it,
it helps us a lot while we're,
when we're out there on the in
the community, so I really enjoy
that, um, this job gives us an
ability to work through
Outside of our county and like
he like um John mentioned it's a
vast.
Um, colonies, so we're able to,
to touch a lot of communities
and because we get to do, you
know, we do the same jobs and
we're able to make contacts
within from the to be advocates
for the tribe and be able to go
to Sandoval County and, you
know, be, be the go between
between setting up like the
emergency services or the roads
or you know, trying to be that
goal between and it's, I think
it's um pretty successful.
Um, so right now, I really enjoy
doing voter registration on
getting people to vote because
we have a lot of of younger
generations, our younger
generations don't find value for
some reason and voting, but
that's one of the challenges
that I'm trying to um take forth
and, and trying to convince them
that it is important to vote. We
can't tell them who to vote for,
but we can tell him that it's
their rights as an American
citizen to vote.
So, um, one of the things is
that I enjoy going into high
schools and um talking to them,
even down to the little kids on
the on the way driving over, I
was thinking I need to come up
with uh with the game so that I
can have kids come up and have
cards with questions that I know
the information about town, flip
one of those and ask me a
question so I can educate them.
So that's one of the, I think
the one of the things that I'm
enjoying is, is being able to
educate um all our
members and anyone who will
listen really because we could
hang out at the state fair and
talk to people there, so, you
know, it's very important that
each of us vote. Um, I just
wanted to share some key dates
for um with you, with whoever is
here also that um
hold on.
Hello? OK. All right. So some
important dates coming up with
the New Mexico general election
on October 8th is the deadline
to register by mail or online,
uh, October 8th as the same on
October.
A in person at your county
clerk's office, you can do same
day registration and early
voting begins also on October
8th, October 22 deadline to
request an absentee ballot, um,
November 2nd is early voting
ends November 5th is election
day and November 5th is also the
last day that absentee ballots
can be um accepted. So I just
wanted to share that because
that's kind of the
stuff that we do in the
communities and in our job and I
really enjoy everybody I work
with and I appreciate you guys
giving us the time to let us um
present to you. Thank you.
Madam Chair, committee members,
we would stand for any
questions.
Thank you
Senator, vice chair Pinto.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee, and thank you
for your presentation and the
work you do. Could you tell us a
little bit of the history on how
you were able to achieve the
tribal liaisons and with the
county.
Madam Chair, if I could defer to
county attorney Michael Eshelman
on that.
Madam Chair, in response to the
senator's question, um,
This
This originally came out of
litigation brought by the US
Justice Department under the
Voting Rights Act. The lawsuit
was filed in 1988, so
Many clerks and administrations
ago that the clerk at that time
was not
Providing
opportunities to vote, um, as
part of that, the county entered
into a consent decree with the
federal government to create
these positions. Uh, the consent
decree has been fulfilled and is
not been enforced for at least
15 years. However, the county
saw the value in continuing
these relationships, um, as John
said, originally the focus was
voting because this arose out of
litigation.
Um, but in 2021, um, the county
decided to change it from, it
was, it was previously called
the Native American Voting
Rights Program and to change it
to broaden the portfolio, as I
was explaining is, uh, Evelyn
Tamara and Sheila are our
ambassadors to Indian country.
So voting is a big part of it,
um.
But the other tasks that you
heard, um, my colleagues speak
of are also work, and I can
assure you.
The Sandoval County
administration of 2024 is very
different than those in the past
that got the county sued. We
have been, uh, the county clerk
Ann Brady is absolutely
committed to this. We have a
number of early voting sites in
Indian Country. We are trying
our best to get people
registered to vote, um,
Fundamental change has happened.
Um,
I want to say it's about 250,000
a year. It's mainly for the
liaisons, but we have money for
promotion and materials, we give
swag out at the county fair and
events and.
No, it is all we we pay for all
of this.
Um, there is some, I think we do
get maybe some reimbursement of
the Secretary of State's for an
election, but it is this is a
Sandoval County program, and I
was informed by my predecessor
who did the research, no other
county of the 3000 counties in
America is doing this.
This is a unique Sandoval County
project.
So, Madam Chair, members of the
committee, does that mean we
have to have a lawsuit and I'm
just kidding. I'm just kidding.
Thank you, thank you for the
work you do. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Madam Chair, uh, I know we're
coming up to our time of 3:45. I
just wanted to give the county
manager Wayne Johnson. I know he
has to leave here briefly, but
just before he has to leave,
give him a chance to address the
committee.
Please.
Good afternoon members of the
committee. It's good to see you
all again. I know many of you
from different
Rolls that I've had, I want to
again welcome you to Sandoval
County. This is really about
our, our tribal liaison program.
We're very proud of the work
that they do, um, and back in
2021 when we expanded the
portfolio, it was certainly
started with voter rights. We
saw the value and we also saw an
opportunity to expand that
relationship and we're now
working with Haus Pueblo, who's
working on broadband and with
Zia we're providing EMS fire and
EMS response and for Santa Ana,
and we're looking to leverage
capabilities that you've got on
the tribal level in the tribal
communities with our own
resources to try and benefit all
communities. We see ourselves at
Sandoval County as a connector
of communities, whether that's
Cuba and Rio Rancho or tribal
nations of Zia and Navajo Nation
and uh Samuel DiFonzo or uh
Santo Domingo, any of those
tribes across our.
County, we want to connect them
and make them work better and
work together to leverage our
strengths. So thank you for that
for a few moments to say hello
and welcome and tell you a
little bit about our program and
again we're very proud of the
work that these, these ladies do
on behalf of the tribes and on
behalf of the county.
Thank you, thank you so very
much, and we thank you, county
manager. Thank you, uh, each and
every one of you for your
forward thinking and I can I can
absolutely see that you're
connecting.
The your communities, your
programs between the different
governments, locally,
regionally, and probably
nationally and uh you're not,
you're addressing what gets
stuck in silo work.
Correct, and you're helping
move, uh, projects, programs,
communication initiatives along
and that's amazing. Uh,
committee members, any further
comments, questions?
Senator Schendo.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and, and
thank you for the presentation.
Uh, liaisons. I really had no
idea that you had an expanded
role which uh it's uh exciting
to see.
And thank you, manager Wayne
Johnson and other deputy and and
attorney.
All of you that are here, um,
One of the challenges that we've
had, uh, with some of our, um,
Capital Alley with some of our,
our Navajo chapters and I'm just
curious. I know in the past.
We've used County as a fiscal
agent to move these projects
along.
Uh,
I think years ago I, I remember,
I can't remember what year it
was, but I think uh
You know, with the relationship
and the work that you guys are
doing beyond just uh voter
rights.
You know, we push out a lot of
funding to some of the, the, the
tribes. I think the pueblos do a
pretty good job, but the Navajo
Nation through their 1164
whatever process takes so long
that sometimes uh the state has
turned to counties.
You know, to help maybe be the
fiscal agent so that these
projects, particularly around
roads because uh there's, you
know, tribes don't have the
equipment. Uh, Madam Chair, my
question is, uh, to, you know, I
guess the county manager and
others, uh, what role do you
guys perhaps see uh you guys
playing to support some of these
projects going forward because
at the end of the day, it's our
community folks that.
are not getting the services and
it gets stuck in a process where
sometimes these funds have to
revert back to the state, and we
don't want that to happen. So
Madam Chair,
Madam Chair, Senator Scindo,
you're absolutely correct. The
county, in addition to the
county liaison program is also
building a grants program and a
grants management program. Um,
we already have some agreements
in place with the Navajo Nation
to work on roads. Navavo 474, we
received money recently from
Congresswoman Leger Fernandez.
For Navajo 474, which is on the
nation. We do work with them
obviously we honor tribal
sovereignty. So until we have an
agreement in place, we don't go
out and do the work. There have
been some times in snowstorms
where we've actually called all
the way up to the uh to the
governor's office and, you know,
or the president's office in the
Navajo Nation to get permission
to go on and and take our plows
on so the kids can get safely to
school, but we always honor that
that sovereignty.
So yes, we are building the
program and building our grants
capacity. Currently we have 3
positions for in our grants
management, uh, program. They're
to look at all grants across the
board and our overall goal is to
grow that department to assist
tribal nations like you said,
uh, Senator.
A lot of the tribes do a great
job and the pros do a great job
in their grants management, but
we also want to know how we can
leverage those federal funds and
our funds and other funds that
we have access to that we can
work together to, to get and,
and make them more effective
broadband's a perfect example of
that. And Hemes Pueblo has been
a leader in broadband in the
area and we're just trying to
see how we fit into that picture
to support the work that's
already being done by the
Pueblos in this area. Santa Ana
has also been very active in
that space.
Yeah, thank, thank you, manager,
and, and thank you and then the
other uh question, I know that
uh I, I'm sure Evelyn can uh
speak to this is that road that
goes to oh you know chapter, um.
That's one of the, so who, who
There's always been a dispute
whether it's BIA Navajo count
what's going on with that, uh,
and is there any improvements on
that road? Madam Chair, yeah,
the last meeting back in
January, um, and that has
decided it was their turf.
And of course, you know.
No improvements whatsoever.
And we've been trying for months
and months.
To try to get together with them
to at least try and get another
memorandum of agreement so far.
They've just been pushing.
Uh, for another date, so.
We're working on it, but it's
just hard to get them to respond
to us the way.
So that we could
Come to that agreement. The last
Agreement was
That was signed in 2020.
Expired in April of this year,
so.
Which I since before that we've
been trying to get that
memorandum of agreement to
continue, but so far we haven't
succeeded yet with.
With um Nagamination Department
of Transportation.
Uh, Madam Chair, is that
agreement to redo the road or
fix the potholes or what, what?
It's basically for maintenance
right now.
For no removal.
OK. And other things with with
Sandoval County.
But the other part of it is BIA
and BLM.
I still looking into getting
more money to try to build a
highway.
Yeah. So.
OK, appreciate it. Thank you,
manager, and thank you all.
OK, thank you. Thank you so much
for your presentation. I
absolutely see your value. I
wish we could clone all of you
for each of the rest of our
counties. Great work,
congratulations, and this is
really, I look forward to
hearing more about your work.
Thank you.
And Madam Chair, just real
quick, before the deputy county
manager wanted me to share a
letter that was received by the
from the governor's office back
in September and just regarding
a couple of capital outlay funds
that were passed in the recent
legislative session. It's the
regarding
Let's see here. Let me read the
two.
Let me see, let me find him
here.
Uh, let me find it.
The first one is the Capital
Development Program Fund and the
second one is the NM match fund
and the deadline for uh those
projects to be submitted to
legislative counsel service
according to this letter is
December 13th. So I just wanted
to put that out there for all
the tribes and pueblos that they
know that those those deadlines
exist, and then second, uh, just
lastly, our communications and
marketing director Sean Perry
Turner, uh, sends her regrets
for not being able to come
today, but tonight is the start
of the Jewish New Year, so uh
she did want to acknowledge.
Guys, and that she is sorry that
she wasn't able to come. So, but
no, anyways, thank you so much,
Madam Chair. Thank you for
having us and again welcome to
Sandoval County and uh hope you
guys have a great next couple of
days here in Sandoval County.
Madam Chair, I did want to
recognize one other person who's
part of the team, uh, Peter
Magdalena, um, is, um, Tamara is
temporarily filling in for him
because he's on a leave of
absence because he is the
governor of him as Pueblo. He
has been with this program since
I believe 1999 and um Peter, his
knowledge is invaluable because
he seems to have a Rolodex of
everybody and um his brother had
been one of our commissioners.
Um, in about 15 years ago, so,
um.
It's an important thing. We, our
people are, we try our best
sometimes as Senator Schendo and
that colloquy was that sometimes
we have a hard time getting over
that finish line, but we are
trying mightily.
Thank you, thank you very much.
A
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, I think one of the
things during the interim
that were
We should take some kind of
action here. I don't know,
Senator Shendo, um, cause you
said you addressed.
Or the road, I don't know what
because I know there was one
road that had
multi-jurisdictional issues, um,
where it was running through.
But if the steps have been taken
and you've identified who's
entity and you're before us now,
and I believe we did, we have
quorum.
That one of the things I say.
Suggesting before a motion that
We have a supporting
documentation asking them to
address the particular road
you're.
You're trying to fix.
I don't know how you, how you
feel about that or what um
because this is, that's
senator's district.
Go ahead, um, just up for
discussion.
Uh, Madam Chair, I was just
trying to get clarification if
that got resolved and uh so I
don't know if
There's any resolution that's
required, I think it was more of
a question of
You know, who, who took
ownership of that and, and, and
that needs to get fixed and so
forth. So, but I don't think it
requires any resolution. I just
want a clarification on that.
All right. Thank you.
OK, thank you once again. Thank
you very, very much.
Thank you for your hospitality.
OK, I have housekeeping
announcements before we adjourn
or recess, we need to approve
minutes tomorrow we will be
meeting at the
Santa Anna Star Casino 54 Has
Canyon Dam, Bernalio, New
Mexico, and not at the Tamaya
resort and we have no one, who
has registered for public
comment unless that has changed,
we have committee minutes. I
have a
I thought I had a motion for
Madam Chair, I'll make a motion.
I have represented a block.
And I have a second by
Representative Little.
Do I see any opposition in
improving the minutes, Senator
Schendo, you have a problem?
I'm just kidding. I see no
opposition, minutes are
approved.
And we will see you tomorrow at
9:30 once again, I'd like to
thank the governor and
Lieutenant governor, the
community members.
OK, uh, I will, um, we'll have
closing comments and uh thank
you so very much for your
hospitality. We had a wonderful
day. We feel blessed and
privileged, and it's been a
pleasure to be here.
Uh, before you close
representative Little?
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I
just wanted to uh share with the
committee a piece, uh, some
information that was clarified
for me and that has to do, if I
may take just a moment. That was
the CBCS presentation that was
made earlier and my question was
on how they there was um uh
interfacing how they were
interfacing with tribal
communities. I was mistaken in
the idea
idea that they were able to
reach out to tribal communities
directly. Uh, it turns out
committee members that, um,
because they are under a
contract with the MCO's, that's
who they're reporting to and
that's who they received the uh.
Information on clients that need
assistance. So, um, they do not,
uh,
Reach out. They do not do
outreach. They're not able to do
outreach to these communities
directly except through the
referrals from the MCOs. So that
was clarified for me uh this,
this afternoon, so I just wanted
to share that with you all. Um,
thank you very much, Madam
Chair. That's it.
Honorable Madam Chair, co-chair,
members of the committee.
There is a gift bag that was
provided for you along with the
glass table decor.
Given to you as a token of our
appreciation and attendance.
Honorable Madam Chair, co-chair,
and members of the committee,
esteemed guests, and fellow
leaders. In conclusion, I thank
you once again for visiting the
Pueblo of Zia as we part ways,
let us hold on.
Onto the memories and
experiences we have shared until
we meet again, I wish you all
continued success, fulfillment
in your endeavors. Safe travels
to your next destination. Thank
you and have a wonderful day and
Lieutenant governor will do a
closing prayer.
