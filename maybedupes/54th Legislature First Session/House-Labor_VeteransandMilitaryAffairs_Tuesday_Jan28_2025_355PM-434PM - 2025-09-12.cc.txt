A little bit of this bill is

So currently, currently the US

That's at a 1 to 1 ratio which
we, uh, the industry.
Under the current standards
could increase the over 20,000.
We have a 1 to 1 ratio.
Half of us could be under

So we're not, we're not, we're
not understanding why we
continue to see an effort

immediately after, Madam Chair,
first we're hearing from Duval
Westfall.
Well, good afternoon again
committee and Madam Chairwoman.
Again, so appreciate your time
with this and letting us dive
in. Again, I'm Duval Westfall,
executive vice president for
policy and programs at the
Greater Albuquerque Chamber of
Commerce. And I'm here now to
respectfully testify in
opposition to House Bill 68,
which is in all honesty a
solution in search of the
problem. A 2 to 1 journeyman to
apprentice ratio effectively
balances training, supervision,
and workforce.
It allows the journeyman to
oversee 2 apprentices, meaning 2
apprentices have not only
oversight, but real jobs to go
to, jobs that pay their bills
while delivering hands-on
training and quality
construction work. House Bill 68
will cut this workforce in half,
limiting the number of new
journeymen being trained, as
well as the projects that their
companies are able to take on
and complete. That's not a
formula for growing our skilled
trade workforce or for
completing construction jobs.
on budget and on time. Our state
is already in a workforce
deficit, losing more journeymen
to retirement than it's training
and how Bill 68 can exacerbate
that deficit.
Our contractors need to be
flexible and efficient to tackle
construction projects in this
economy, and they need
flexibility and efficiency when
it comes to bringing tomorrow's
journeymen online. At the same
time, we need to have sufficient
apprentice spot available so
that New Mexicans have the
opportunity to work and learn a
trade at the same time.
Let's not remove that
flexibility and efficiency and
let's not slash the number of
apprenticeships available for
today's and tomorrow's
workforce.
Respectfully, please vote
against HP 68.
Thank you.
I hate to keep reminding that um
if you're coughing or sneezing,
that's all of us, right? So we
have no one else from on Zoom,
those in position who wish to
speak is
we will take the mic and we will
begin on that end of the room
and then continue.

committee, I'm Vince Martinez.

We're not standing in
opposition, we have some
More than questions we fully
understand the intent.
Of this legislation we would
like to know if the standard
will apply to us small world.
Just hiring personnel is a
challenge in rural New Mexico.
So and then with this apply in
every everything an apprentice
does.
Other than construction, so if
they were going out to read a
book with them.
So those are the types of
questions concerned about.
As well as the like this, or if
we're missing a journeyman and
we have an outage.
And that apprentice sponsor.
you'll take note and when
appropriate.
