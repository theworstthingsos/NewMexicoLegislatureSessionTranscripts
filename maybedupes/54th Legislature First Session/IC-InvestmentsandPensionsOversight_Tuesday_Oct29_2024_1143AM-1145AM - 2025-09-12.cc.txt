Uh, because now it was solvent.
But other than that, there is no
mechanism in place that pays for
that cola, and that's why it was

And so, uh, that, that was the
outcome of that discussion. Uh,
I mean, I'm sure they took into

All of the, uh, the, the cases
that were cited.
So, um, I, I know Greg can talk
a little bit more on this.
Thank you.
Very well, thank you and uh also
uh.
Mr. Marcus, uh, we want to thank
you for uh being a sponsor of
the lunch.
You and Art Hall.
