Everyone sorry for
being a few minutes late. Um
Traffic was a little crazy from
Albuquerque.
Uh
Plus I got in from Sunland
Park last night,
so it was three
days of intense.
It was great actually,
um I look
at in, at transportation
a lot differently now
after being there for three
days. So if you guys haven't
had the opportunity
to go to Sunland Park
and Santa Teresa
and El Paso,
please take that
opportunity. Um
We were there for
transportation
and
um it's
far but
just the
trade, the
railroad,
the
um
the relationship with uh
Mexico,
I mean, it was just all
very enlightening.
So, uh yeah,
I would advise people if they
haven't been there to
see what our state
is doing
economically.
That is a real,
real treat.
Um So I'm gonna call the
meeting to order
and um
I wanted to thank
our Senator
Bobby Gonzalez, first of
all, for
being here this morning
and I asked him to call the meeting to
order once we had a quorum
if I didn't, I was
behind like
the slowest traffic.
But anyway, that's
another story.
Um
So I guess we'll start
by taking role

Um Looks

director of the educational retirement
board. And to my right is
Mr Bob Jacks, our chief
investment officer.
And if it's ok with the committee,
I'd like to go ahead and introduce our
senior staff here with
the organization, so you can
be become familiar with
them first off uh Back
here is my deputy director, Mr
RNA Perry, Mrs
Renata Perry Galen.
We also have uh Mr
Jacob Mall. We
have our member services director,
Mr Raul
Dura, our communications director
Rene Garcia,
our hr and executive

Salazar. And we have our
Deputy General Counsel
Minister, Evan Kocher with us

>> Good morning. Um
I would say that you

actually you have quite a bit of
time. Um So
because at 1145
we're gonna do lunch.
So, um
we'll take maybe
40 minutes
of your presentation
and then the rest questions,
if that would work for
you maybe go till
about 11 or so.
>> Wonderful. Thank you, madam chair. There's
a bunch of information that we'll
be presenting to you today and certainly
our staff is here to answer any
questions you might have or any uh
provide any details with
anything that I might be lacking in the
presentation. If
you like to go ahead and uh
skip
>> before you get started.
Can I have a motion
to approve since we
do have a quorum our
minutes of our first
meeting of May
22nd.
Thank you. Any
opposition?
See, no opposition.
Those minutes are approved.
Thank you. Go ahead, Mr.
>> Thank you madam chair.
If I could ask you to move
forward to slide three, just
briefly the Educational
Retirement Act Chapter
22 article 11
spells out
the >> hang on, they're
still handing that out.
So
let's get that out to
everyone.
All right, go
ahead.
>> So on slide three,
there's reference here to the
Educational Retirement Act uh
sections 22 11-1
through 22
11-55
which spells out the the
purpose of the Educational Retirement
Act. And I would just specifically
point you to the board powers
duties and authority, which
is basically to administer the
Educational Retirement Act,
including specifically
the items referenced here below
how the board functions,
the employment of staff
specific to the executive
director, as well as the annual
approval of an organizational
chart that is eventually submitted to the
Department of Finance and Administration,
as well as the Legislative Finance
committee as part of our annual
appropriation request,
uh that they have a duty
to accept donations, gifts and
bequests of the fund. And I know that last
year, I think Senator Stanic asked whether
or not we've ever received any of these,
uh and to the extent
uh to the best of my
knowledge in the time that I've been there, we
have not received anything of the
sort. We're also required
to provide an actuary report
on the financial operation
of the Education Retirement Act
to the legislature each year.
Typically, this comes in the form of
the presentations that we make before
the Investments Pensions
Oversight Committee, as well as the Legislative
Finance Committee. And then typically
during the session, there's a presentation
that's made to both House
Appropriations and Finance as well
as the Senate Finance Committee.
And that's how we fulfill that
obligation Uh, the
board has an authority to adopt
rules and regulations pursuant
to the Education Retirement Act because
not everything can be spelled out in
legislation. So
there's some items that are out
there that aren't, if they're not addressed in policy,
they're addressed by the, the Administrative
Act. If
I could ask you to turn to page
four, the board is
required to invest.
Um I think this last
report and Bob will give you some
information about that. We're up to about
$18.2 billion in
the trust fund. Uh The
board is required to ask according
to the prudent investment standard,
uh and they are
required to take an annual
training. So our board
members are required to get that fiduciary
training so that they can become familiar
with not only their investment decisions
but also their fiduciary responsibility
to our members. We
are part of the organizations you see
listed below, including the National
Council on Teachers Retirement
and CTR,
the National Conference on Public Employees
Retirement Systems, the
National Association of State Retirement
Administrators and the International
Foundation of Employee benefit plans.
Now, these professional development
organizations
are a combination of the
largest pension funds throughout the
nation. Uh not just the
largest, there's a bunch of uh small
counties and stuff, some of which are actually
larger than the pension fund we
administer. Uh but it
basically includes all of the
major uh pension funds
across the nation. So there's lots
of good information that we're able to
obtain by participating with
these groups. Uh lots of
stuff, you know, that's going on with their cost
of living adjustments, with the return to
work with the administration of the programs,
with investment opportunities
that provide us with a lot of helpful
information to administer the
program. If you
turn to page five title
two chapter 82 of the new Mexico
administrative code, uh
82-1 through
82-12
spells out
how we are to administer the
program. These are rules adopted
by the board uh
occasionally revised whenever
laws change so that it's so that
there isn't any inconsistencies
between the administrative
code and actual law.
But anytime there's
an issue that's silent, that's come
up, we try to address that through
the new Mexico Administrative
Code.
If I could ask you to turn to page
six, this provides
you with an overview of
how the program is
structured. Uh
Answer to a
nine member board of directors
that includes broad representation from
across the state, including an elected
official in the form of the state
Treasury who serves on the board. But we
represent several different
organizations. Uh
We have representation
from uh the, the
leaders of the public
education department,
the higher education department.
But then uh basically, I
answer to uh as the
executive director I
answered to the board and then you
can see our senior leadership is listed
here below. Uh overall,
we have about 90 authorized
FTE that reside both in
Albuquerque and Santa Fe. We've
had a number of polices across
Santa Fe to uh to
accommodate our, our
situation until we're able to move into
the new building, which I'll provide a brief
update on here
shortly. Uh But over the
past couple of years after
the recall for return to work
or back in the office, uh we've
had to separate our operations
throughout town. Now we're all
located in one location kind
of pending the move into our new building.
Uh But ultimately, we, we
will still maintain two office
locations, one in Albuquerque and
one in Santa Fe. As we move
forward
on page seven, you can
see the list Mr Archuleta.
>> Did you send this to
our staff so we could put it
posted
above
>> madam chair? I I believe
so. >> Um
could the staff look
into
whether we can follow it
so our viewers
can see
it?
She uh Christina is
telling me that the viewers
can see it online.
We just can't see it here.
So, go ahead and continue.
Thank you. >> OK.
On page seven is a list of
our, our board of directors including
our chair, Mr Russell Goff who represents
the New Mexico Association of educational
retirees, Miss Marylou Cameron.
Our vice chair represents Ne
a New Mexico. Mr
Max Baca, the former Vice
President of Finance over
at Highlands University is one of
our governor appointees
as well as Mrs Renee Ward,
the deputy secretary over at the
Department of Finance and
Administration. Our state
treasurer Miss Laura
Montoya, uh
Doctor Matthias Fontenla
represents the American Federation
of Teachers in New Mexico. He's
a University of New Mexico professor
in economics, uh
Stephanie Rodriguez,
the Cabinet Secretary for the higher
Education Department, as well as
Antonio Ortiz, who's a designee
on behalf of the Secretary for the Public
Education Department
and Dr Riley White, who represents
the American Association of
University
Professors
on page eight again is a
listing of our executive
leadership here. We've listed
them all. I removed the phone
numbers uh from the presentation.
Uh not for any specific
purpose other than so that we don't
get random phone calls. But you've got
our contact information here.
One of the reasons that we removed the
phone call, uh the, the
list of phone numbers here is there's been an
uptick in the number of
attempted
uh hacks with the organization
or cybersecurity uh
breaches with the
organization. So,
uh sometimes we'll be
providing a little bit less
information, not so much that we're trying
to hide this information, but you're welcome
to email, uh any
member of, of our executive
staff and their information is contained
here on page
eight
on page nine
is a slide that shows
you a broad overview
of the members that we, we
represent the benefits that we
provide uh the
actual actuarial
value of our assets as well as our
funded period. So here's the really
good information.
We haven't, we don't have the snapshot
as of June 30th 2025.
That information will be evaluated
as of the process right now. Being
gathered, it'll be finalized
in the fall. We'll be able to make a
presentation at the November
I ac meeting. Basically
by then that information will be finalized.
But you can see here that we had
in June 30th last
year, there were nearly
63,000 active
members, employees participating
or contributing to the program compared
to 61,000 the year
or, or a difference
of about 1500 members.
Uh The number of retirees and beneficiaries
also increased by nearly 1000
members in terms of
payroll. How much those uh
retirees received
uh in that year was in excess
of $1.3 billion
or about $50 million more
compared to the previous year for
those uh 900
plus members. Uh The
average annual benefit uh you
can see is $26,000
for one of our members. Uh
That's about less than just a hair
under $2200 per
month. Uh But we collect
more than $1.2
billion in employee and employer
contributions that
10.7% that they're
required to contribute to the program,
along with the 18.5%
that the employer pays on their behalf
translates into roughly
$21.2 billion in
revenue per year. For us.
Last year, we refunded
nearly $67 million
to people who came into the system
and decided to not
continue their, their service
career with us. Some instances
that will eventually come back. But ultimately,
they sought reimbursement of the
contributions that they made into the
fund. Uh We draw
upon $3.8
billion in payroll from
the institutions and that
participate uh with the
education retirement board.
Uh nearly 220
of those. And the
actual value of our assets
last year reached $17.2
billion or a billion more than it was
the year before. Now in
terms of the funding period or when we
expect to reach that goal of
100% funding, which is
the standard used by most organizations
of having most assets in the fund
to meet our obligations
over the course of the next 30
years. We're expected to
hit that target in the next 22
years. Our funded
ratio as of this last year, slight
uptick compared to the previous year was
at 64.8%. And
I expect to report to you in the fall that there
will be an increase or an
improvement to that uh as
well.
If you turn to the next page
on page 10.
Uh This is a
photo that was taken
last week of our new office
facility down at the south end
of Santa Fe. I'm
happy to report that the building
is basically 99%
complete. Now, mind you,
we broke ground in January of last
year, January of uh
2024.
Uh We expect it to be done by
January of this year.
Unfortunately, there's been a couple of
setbacks over the course of the past
year. Uh mainly access
to city utilities and
you may have read in the New Mexican
about a dispute that
we had with the,
with the city regarding
the governing authority over who has
ultimate approval over
the plan for the building and the way
that this works out now
in partnership with the General Services
Department, Facilities Management
Division who typically builds
most buildings across the state and
owns most buildings. It's a little bit
different in a situation and that the
board actually owns the building.
Our organization is one
of the few organizations that has the
authority to own its
own uh piece of
property similar to the Public Employees
Retirement Association.
Uh You know, we sought
approval from uh
construction industries division
of the regulation and licensing department.
They issued a building permit and we
began construction in January
of last year. Uh We
applied for a water permit sometime in
the spring and there had been some delay in
that uh finally,
after, you know, some, some back
and forth and reaching out to the city,
it was determined that we hadn't,
well, wasn't determined.
We, we knew ahead of time that we
hadn't followed the city's
regulations and ordinance with
requirements associated with their
approval over the building.
Now, we were operating under the
assumption that we don't require two
approvals. And as we understand,
understood the situation,
basically, there aren't any
organizations that obtain both the permit
from C ID as well as from
whatever local or uh
entity would
be approving this
fast forward in the fall. We did
file a lawsuit against the city
requesting uh clarification
on ultimately who had authority. Now,
while the judge didn't completely side with
the city, they didn't side with us
either. So it put us in
a position where we were required
to seek approval from the Planning
Commission who ultimately
authorized authority for us
to proceed with this, but provided
some conditions upon
how it would be approved
for us to get the water,
including uh moving
some solar panels that we had in
place rightfully. So
after working with the, the fire
marshal, it was determined that
they needed to be moved back. It was
in a building design. It was a, it
was an installation uh
deficiency.
There's some access to the building
that they were requesting, including
striping from the the
property across the street that
comes across to us. But ultimately,
if there is a member of the public who is
disabled and they need access.
They needed us to improve that on
the property that has since been
done. Uh There was a
request for us to install roll stops
at every parking space and not just
those that butted up against the
building. Uh, there
was some issues
regarding the lighting.
Uh, our lighting, I think was
a little bit bright, uh, a little too
bright. So, uh we're
replacing uh
the the lamp post as
well as some exterior lighting there.
That's been sort of a bit of a hold up
for us in terms of the, the timing
associated with when we received
that uh stuff
as well as some fencing around the
retention pond uh that
ultimately uh flows
into the Roy since it
exceeds a 3.5 ft depth
and parts of that retention pond,
we were required to, to fence
around that virtually
everything has been complete and what hasn't
been complete will be done by next
week. And we are hopeful
that following that,
we will be able to get the city or
convince the city to come out
inspect the fact that everything has
been completed to their
uh to their liking
and move forward from there
again. We, we sought and received
approval from the Planning Commission uh
on April 17th
earlier this year and
we're still working with the
city uh to try to get that
connected.
>> What is the location of
this again,
>> madam chair. It is located at
5211, Las Aleiss
Drive. So down on the south end
of town where a lot of the
new development is, it's basically
in between the Walmart
Supercenter Office,
Cios and the Presbyterian
Hospital. So it's by
the Para building. It's a
little further
north and I'm sorry, a little
further east of the per building,
but we're
within five minutes of
that property. Thank
you
on page 11. Uh 1 of the other
big projects that we have going on
as big as if not bigger
than, than the building is the
implementation development and
implementation of the new pension
administration system. This
is basically the the brain of the
organization that collects
all the information for
retirees over the course of their
career as a lot
of historical information and is
ultimately responsible for generating
and calculating the benefit
payments that will be made to
retirees in the future.
Now, we started this project last
July uh after two
years of research,
uh consultation
with uh with
various groups on how to proceed
forward. Basically, the program
that we have in place today is no
longer supported. Uh
It's kind of old, it's kind of
clunky and it has limited functionality.
But nonetheless, we're moving forward with this
implementation of a new system.
It expected to be completed by
November 26th of next year,
basically about 17 months
from now. Uh And
the, the groups we have listed
here. Tell us is the product
that we are purchasing through
uh through Lifeworks.
Our formerly Lifeworks, I'm sorry,
the program that
we are purchasing is an off the
of what they refer to as
a uh custom off the
shelf system. Uh
Basically, we're backing a lot of
the processes that we have in place
today into what they
have in, in place for
them uh to sort of
limit uh
human in the
process. N TT
is providing the independent
verification and validation of
the system. SG is acting as
our general consultant and project
management uh to help
us through this process. M BS is
helping us cleanse the data that we
have in our system today.
So that as we move forward into the new
system, any
anytime there's missing information
and we've got a lot of missing information
from 2030 plus years
ago uh will
help us clean up some of them, some of that
data to help facilitate
uh the quick processing
of retirement applications in the
future. And then obviously,
this system will be implemented
and owned by the education retirement
board. Uh For
future use,
you could turn to page 12. Uh
just a brief
listing and overview of the
legislation that was related
to the Education Retirement board. This
past year. You
thanks to Senator Figueroa
for the introduction of Senate Bill
75 which was endorsed
by this committee,
endorsed and then it was slightly modified
by this committee last
year. It did a couple
of real really important things for the
organization particularly to
the uh unclaimed
contributions. Basically, when
someone comes into the system makes
contributions over a period of
time, they disappear
for a while. Um
rather than any obligation
or confusion about whether or not there
was a
in importance that we relay
that information on to
or eventually provide
that information to TRD
if the, the account is stagnant
or hasn't been accessed in a number of
years it would remain with the fund
this way in the event that the
the member ever comes forward
wants the benefit wants a refund.
We have that in place
or if their beneficiary
does. It also
clarified some information regarding
the earning of service
credit.
Um Sorry
here, uh the
the definition
of the disa I'm sorry, not the definition
but clarification on whether or not a
disabledd member will continue to
receive a disability
uh adjustment, which is slightly
higher than the overall cost of living
adjustment for most retirees
after they reach a normal retirement
age, as well as reciprocity
with Paris, so that we're able to communicate
information with them. Uh
whereas in the Education Retirement
Act to species specifically
who we can contact and the
information that we can provide for
them, that's for their protection
as well as ours. But a lot
of times there's some confusion because we'll
have a, a member
who passes away
and we'll have the, the child
or the only living person, you know,
that uh is
left, you know, trying to access the
information, trying to clear up their accounts,
trying to make sure that the taxes are filed.
And unfortunately, we can't share
that information with them. And
a lot of times you'll get a phone call, our
members of this
body will receive a phone call saying,
you know, this, this doesn't make a whole lot of
sense. It,
it does make sense and that we're trying to
protect this member's information, but
this opens it up so that we're able to
better communicate with Per. So if
there's an issue with
someone having information or they
had service credit with Pera, they also have
service credit with us, we'll be able
to bounce that off each
other and hopefully identify and
identify these members. So moving
forward, um,
they'll receive the benefit. They're, they're
entitled to Senate
bill 133 introduced
by Senator Wirth increased
some of the return to work limits
that we have for uh folks
that were previously capped
out at $15,000 per
year, that increase moved to
$25,000.
The reason that that's important is because
when someone earns $15,000
per year and they're participated
in that program, they are
not required to make those non-refundable
contributions that any other return
to work employee would uh
that limits the,
the fiscal impact that it has
to the fund. Uh But this
year acknowledging
the fact that few, few members
actually earn a limit of $15,000
even if they're working
on a part time
basis, they increase
that to $25,000.
In addition to that several
years ago, there was a new bill that was
introduced that allowed a member to
return to work after 90
days or up to 36
months or three years. Uh
That was now increased
because it would have expired this
last year. Obviously, there's, there
remains a return to our a
teacher shortage. So
we move that from 36 months
to 60 months. Now, there
were two bills that were introduced virtually
identical, one of which
had bumped it up to the 72
months. Uh I would tell you
that, that the fiscal impact
on that was larger, the
thought and theory behind that is if
you allow a program to exist,
that would say basically an individual
can, can come back to work
either for a longer period of time
or indefinitely that
that member will return at the earliest
possible time that they can
and the longer that they're retired,
the more money is required to
come from investment earnings that
places additional stress.
So outside of that,
there's an expectation again
that if a member becomes eligible
to both collect a paycheck, there's
an incentive there and a retirement
that they will do so at their earliest
time, that's hence the,
the, the, the need for those
limits around return to work.
Uh,
limitations
Senate bill 421
passed the Senate Education
Committee. It was referred to the Senate
Judiciary Committee
as part of that lawsuit. One of the
issues that was brought up,
uh, on the city's behalf
was the fact that, uh, there
was, there was a
lack of clarification as
to whether or not we could own our
own building or the Education
Retirement Board could own its own building.
We actually own we actually
owned our own building and
had for a number of years,
it was recently sold to the General
Services Department as authorized
by the legislature. Uh,
but that money went back into the
trust fund, but we attempted to
clarify that based upon some
concerns that the city had expressed.
Uh, nonetheless, the bill didn't make
it through the process, but the building
has been sold to the General Services
Department and I think that
the issue uh, remains
clear that we do have the authority to
own our own building.
Else. Bill 251
introduced by Representative Hall
here, uh allowed
for um,
consistency with what is
allowed with the Public Employees Retirement
Association. Whenever that was changed.
It's not clear why it wasn't change with the, er B
but basically allowed you to make a one
time irrevocable change
to your beneficiary following
retirement. Whereas
now, uh if a member,
a member couldn't make a, a beneficiary
change, if they were under part
B or part C or had
opted for part B or part
C, it automa
automatically get bumped up to
uh option A.
So now the member
would have a chance to pick another beneficiary
in the event after the retirement,
I'll spill.
254
passed the House Labor
Veterans and Military Affairs Committee
was referred to house appropriations
again, this was a duplicate of Senate
bill 133 but I think initially
started off as a line member to come back
to work for 72 months.
I think in working with legislators,
we were able to agree that basically
what was contained in 133 was
more important. So we move forward with
that. And then we had House
Bill 454
introduced by Representative
Baca, which was referred to the House Education
Committee provided
for uh supplemental
payments for our members. I think
it basically gave us about
$60 million
which would have allowed the education and
retirement board to provide one
time cost of living. I won't call
them cost of living adjustments, but
supplemental payments equal to about
2% of the members average
benefit uh over the course
of the next two years. Unfortunately,
that failed to gain any traction as I
believe most of the dollars that
uh uh
had been dedicated
during the legislative session had already been
authorized for other purposes.
Now, we just recently
completed our actuarial
audit. I think it's been 10
years since we actually went through
uh that process the year
before we went through a
review of the actuarial
assumptions that are baked into this
system. Uh It was conducted
by the auditor Milliman who looked
over uh Gabriel Roters
Smith's work. GRS is our general
consultant that's on board who
helps us respond to any
questions and measure the output
of any proposals that are made during
the legislative session. Uh
They looked at our census data,
our experience study documents
which was conducted last year,
um looked at our liabilities
and valuation reports in general.
There were some small changes in terms
of the calculations that they had
versus what GRS did.
Uh But ultimately, it
translates to roughly rounding
errors. So there wasn't any major
difference or bombshell
that came out as a result of the a
suggesting that it would,
that any one change would make a
significant, significant
difference in the trajectory that we're on
today
on page 14.
Uh I'd like to point
out some changes because it might
still be fresh in the minds
of, of members.
Uh The board adopted uh
some return to work rule
changes. At
the end of 2023 there seemed to
be an increase in the number of
folks that had violated
um the return
to work rules we have as part of the Education
Retirement Act. Um
The act does not provide
me or the director of this
organization with broad discretion
as to who
violates who doesn't and whether or
not I get to make a determination about
whether or not we forgive
uh those violations.
So basically when a member re
returned to work and had not
submitted an application, it was in
violation or found to be in
violation of our return to work
rules, we would suspend their
pension and we would reclaim
those amounts that were paid to them during
that period of
ineligibility.
Um You may remember
that translated us to
landing in the news and people were
concerned because, uh,
there were some large dollar amounts that had been
paid. And the reason that, that
had, the reason that that
had occurred was because
basically there's
a light time between, between
when information is reported
to us from the local administrative
units. And when we find out that a person
is actually found to be in violation,
we don't get real time data at the
conclusion of every pay period.
Uh, it's, it's leading up, you
know, sometimes it's two months down the
road and by the time it's reconciled
and it's determined we've already
paid a member the last three months
of their pension. And whenever
we go back and we're required to recoup
that pension amount along with
suspending their pension moving
forward, you can understand
how that might cause a bit of concern
for those members. The
good news is nowadays,
uh, basically what's being
allowed is that if you're found to
be in violation, let's say you didn't
wait out the period of time, the 90
days. In that case,
we're going to go back and recoup those pension
amounts. There are certain IRS
guidelines around how
return to work programs may
work. We don't want to be found
to be in violation of that.
That would, could jeopardize our tax
exempt status in
that situation and those are very
few cases we would go back and recoup
those payments as well as suspend their
pension. But if you simply
forgot to fill out an application
or you, you didn't think that it applied
to you. Uh, whatever
the situation may be, we're gonna
give you a slight grace period. So
instead of telling you that we're suspending
that pension, we're gonna go to, we're gonna
send you a letter and say, hey, you've got 30
days to come into compliance with
this, if you say,
ok, well, I'm not gonna do any of that.
At that point in time, we'll suspend your
pension. You will be required to
reapply for
retirement, but we're
no longer going back to seek recruitment
of those funds.
So it created that safe harbor
for those retirees uh who
had returned to work without approval,
uh deleted reference
previously. If you waited
out one year, we had a return to
work program that was in place for a number
of years. I think nearly 20
years. If you, if
you return to work after one year,
there were no earnings limitations, you'd
come back in the system and there was no period
of time in which you were limited to that
work. So we have a number of
retiree in the program and that
will be a part of the next slide.
But if you waited out
the one year again, you could return
to work as long as you're making those
non-refundable employee employer
contributions. That program
was basically replaced by the
36 months, which is now,
the 60 month program,
we're required to make those uh
return to work contributions.
But the wait out period between
when you retire, when you can return to
work is 90 days
one year.
We also
um
part part of the rule is that we're
requiring local administrative units
all 2200 and 20 school
districts, universities and
charter schools to come up with their own
policy regarding how
they apply, return to work rules
and making sure that they're consistent
with the requirements that we have.
Uh basically having the employer
groups, make sure that if an employee
is return to work in most
instances, they know that someone is
returning to work, that they
filled out the proper application,
uh, paperwork with
the education retirement board.
And then lastly, it allowed the, er
b it allowed, the change
made allows, er, b to assess
monetary penalties for those
lau for misreporting
information because that was another
large program or the, another large
issue that we had is they're
misc when they're reported
to us, which makes it more difficult to
detect, hence the life
time and when we actually detected that
they were in violation sometimes three
or four months down the
road
on page 15
is a listing of the
return to work programs we have in
place and the number of participants
in the last two fiscal years.
Um, you can see here
that those people participating in the
0.25 program or 10
hours or less per week,
uh, is increased to
671.
Those earning less than
$15,000
dropped to 390
under the 36 month program.
We have 361 and
24 that grew to
506. Uh
Today, the number that we received
is we have 720
approved under this program.
Uh return to work one year.
You can see there's a continued decline
as some of those people are filtering out of this
system. But there's also an
increase in the number of folks who
retired from PERA and are
now working for an education retirement
board employer. But
overall, there's a slight decline in
the number of overall return to work
participants. Uh year
over year.
Another subject that comes up
that I think it's important for,
for members to understand
is the earning of service
credit on
page 16. It's
titled benefits or service credit
approvals >> just for
the record. You have about 10
more minutes, but I'm going to give you an
extra 10 because you have
quite a bit still to
cover. And I think we have the
time >> I'll make this
quick on. I
I think the takeaway from
slide 16 is that there are basically
four tiers of coverage for members.
Tiers, one through three,
earn a flat service credit
or 2.35%
for every year. They're participating in the
program. And those on tier four,
you can see it based and it
grades up, the longer a
member is with us. So year one through
10, they're earning 1.35
percent over
years. 11 through 20
they're earning 2.35 percent.
21 through 30
the longer they stay, the more they're
rewarded, they would earn 3.35
percent. And then after 30 it bumps down
to 2.4%
for every year service
credit,
then if you turn to page 17,
uh title benefits or cost of
living adjustments. Um,
I think that that was uh some
concern that people uh had
expressed last year. Less
so on our side, I think more so than it
was on parasite.
Uh But
the way that the
parameters set is that it can't
the cost of living adjustment, remember
can exceed 4% or less
than 2% and less.
Uh inflation is
less than 2%.
Uh But then we also
have some additional parameters until we
reach a certain funding
milestones. So
until we reach 100%
no one's gonna get a flat two or
4%. >> Excuse
me, madam chair,
I just got a text
that the public cannot
hear what is being
said on the
webcast. It's not
coming through clearly.
So I don't know if the staff
can do anything about that.
>> Can we ask the staff
to take a look at that
please?
Before we continue the
microphone's
on?
Thanks. Thank
you, ma uh
I was gonna say madam Stefanik
but Senator
Stefani.
Ok, we're gonna take
like should
we take a five minute break?
Do you think
Christina
keep going?
Well, I mean, is the,
is the close >> captioning
working
Georges, one
person said
the,
>> oh, shall we
continue?
Ok. She's gonna go ahead and
talk it,
but we're just gonna continue.
Thank you.
>> So
basically, until we reach full
funding members are only getting
a fraction of the speak a
little >> bit.
So,
>> so basically, until
we reach full funding or
100% a
members only going to receive a
portion of the cost of living
adjustment that they would otherwise be entitled
to. Uh So we're,
we're away from those funding
milestones, but we're
making progress toward
that. Uh But at the very
bottom of the slide, you can see that
about those people that were
earning less than the median pension. Uh
As of last year will receive
a 1.8% cost of
living adjustment. This next
year, all are
the bulk of our retirees. About
95% of them will receive
1.6%.
And those folks that are uh
disabled and retired
and have been retired for more than three years
will receive
2%.
And then if you turn to the last
slide, I'll just make brief
mention on slide 18
about the alternative retirement
program which is
basically
401k that is offered
to certain university
employees. Uh typically
those uh high or, or
high earning employees.
Uh There's, there's specific
reference in our rules
about the members that can participate
in there. Uh But the value
add for that is those members that are
working for a shorter period of time
and don't expect to spend a long career,
uh, working for one of those
institutions would have
the, basically the option of
taking the contributions that both the
employers making along with the
employee, along with them wherever
they're moving on to next. We
typically see, you know,
head coaches and, you know,
the heads of universities participating
in the alternative retirement plan, which
we're responsible for administering.
There's about 4000 accounts and about
a little over a billion dollars in
this uh account administered
uh uh through
two different partners, Fidelity and
Tiaret. And with
that, I will turn the rest of the
presentation over to Mr
Jack Shock for the investment component
of this.
>> Thank you, sir. And did you
say Shaw?
>> Yeah, my name is Bob Jacks
Shaw. >> Mr
Shaw. I'm
gonna, you have about
15 minutes to
go, >> I think
we can do it. Uh
So I'm the chief investment
officer, uh position
I've held for the last
18.5
years uh with
er B
and uh in
broad strokes, here's what I
intend to cover. I
want to give you some context
as to how the investment
operation fits within
the overall organization
and the goals of the
organization.
Talk a little bit about
the governance and the controls
on our activities.
Uh give you some
evaluation
criteria, the
things that we use to look
at to see how well we're
doing and
finally to look at the
results, uh
the results are the
same numbers you'll see
in the LFC
reports,
but uh probably in a
little more depth and a little bit
different uh
format.
So to start with on page
19,
you can see the overall
mission of the, er B
provides secure
retirement benefits.
That is, in other
words, to fund
the paycheck
that they get
next month,
every month for the next 10
years, the next 40
years, I use 40
years on purpose because our
average
beneficiary, our average
participant is in the fund
for about 40 years, about
20 years contributing
and about 20 years collecting
a benefit. So we
do try to take a long term
perspective.
So in the investment part of that,
quite simply,
what we're looking to do is
to balance risk and
return.
That's it in concept,
very simple. Uh
in execution, it's,
it's a bit more
complicated.
Um And I look
at it as if you want to use,
if you have any sports
fans, uh if
you have a football
team where the
quarterback drops back and
throws the ball 40 yards
every time, you'll probably
score a lot of points
and you'll probably give up a lot of
points because he's taking a lot of
risk, he'll get
intercepted, he'll get tackled
all those things. So we try to
balance that.
I'm gonna say if there are questions
while I'm going through this, it's
fine with me. If you want to stop
and ask. Although
depending on the questions I may
ask to borrow uh Representative
Lord's motorcycle
helmet.
Thank you.
Oh yeah.
Um If we could
go on to the next
slide page
20
it's a very simple
representation
of any retirement
fund. This is your IRA.
This is er B
this is Pera and it's
simply the contributions
plus the investment
earnings over
time must pay for
the benefits and the
expenses.
So I'm gonna
focus on the eye
as I go through this.
Um As David
touched on earlier, there was a slide
with contributions
that come in every year
and benefits get
paid out.
You'll notice we do pay out
more in benefits than we
take in in contributions
for fiscal year
25. That's
gonna be in the range of
253
100 million.
That's not unexpected.
We build that into the
actuarial assumption
and the investment
return is there to
make up that
difference.
Our return assumption is
7% per
year and
that's something we'll examine on
how well we've done reaching
that.
If you go to the next page, page
21
this I'll touch on as I mentioned,
the governance and
controls.
This is a snapshot of our
website. Uh If
you care to go there, you can look
at a number of things
including our investment
policy.
Our investment policy
covers roles
and responsibilities for
the board, the staff, our
consultants, our
managers,
it covers guidelines
on what we can invest
in
and it covers
an asset allocation
target as to
where we target
putting our money. So
the playbook if you
will,
and you can also view
all of our other
policies,
uh investment
performance, a number
of things. If you care to go look
at it, it's there
in great
detail.
If you go to page
22
I mentioned our asset
allocation
there. I on the
left, we're showing our
actual allocation
in the various assets we
invest in us,
equities bonds,
et cetera, et cetera.
We do invest in a
wide variety of
different things
intentionally to
dampen the risk in the
portfolio while still
trying to squeeze out
as much return as we
can. And
on the right hand side, you
can see the targets.
I'll just say you'll notice they
aren't exactly lined
up. That's
because uh again,
the right hand side is the
playbook. Well, when
the game starts, you might
run a few different
plays
and uh there is some
difference there. We do have some
flexibility to do that
depending on market
conditions.
You turn to page
23.
Now, I'll talk about
how we look at
evaluating this.
As I mentioned, long-term
results are important,
average persons in the plan
for 40 years. What
happens in a quarter
is not particularly
impactful, what
happens in a year,
not really so
much. We try
to look at this in multiple
years,
risk and return
are equally
important.
It's easy
to look at
the returns. Uh
Those are well understood.
We had a return of
8.2% over this
time period. Risk is
a little bit more nuanced and we'll
talk about that a little
more.
All the returns we
cite in here
are yearly
averages. So if we say
the 10 year,
we earned eight percent, that's
on average 8%. Every
year
risk is measured by
a couple of statistics.
The standard deviation
and a sharp ratio, I'll
talk about those a little
bit more
later
if you go to the next page
24.
So we
compare to the
following criteria.
The first and most
important thing
is that 7%
return that is
required to make
the actuarial
formula work.
Now, that's just one of the things
that's in there. But it, but it's a very
important
thing.
The next thing we look
at
is a pure universe
comparing to other
pension funds that have
a billion dollars or more in
assets.
We use a certain size
because under that size, they're
probably gonna invest
differently. They won't
have the same
availability of,
of assets to
invest in. They won't have the same
staff,
etcetera.
Then we look at our
policy index again,
I mentioned our playbook
and we look at how
we did when we vary
from that, did we add
value? Did we detract
value?
And once again, we do look
at risk.
So if you turn to page 25
let's start with how did we
do versus our
7% target?
And I would just say you can see
in most of these periods
we did quite well compared
to that. The three year
is the exception.
And sometimes
the uh the markets,
markets plural
just won't let you get there.
And that did happen during
the three years.
Uh We don't believe that's
a concern because longer
term we're living up to
what we want to
hit.
You turn to
page
26.
These are the
results
over various time
periods. Uh
You can see,
well, I won't read the numbers
off. We then
compare that to our
policy
index
and then we say, well, did we
add value? Did we
detract? And
in all cases, we did add
value. Uh
And again, these are
annual numbers. So for
instance, the 10 years
is 35
basis points
or
0.35%
per year.
Then we look at that
universe ranking that I
mentioned comparing to other
pension funds,
one is the best you can
do. 100 is the
worst. So
again, we'll look at the 10
year we were in the
sixth
percentile.
This is done on a
percentile basis because
there's not exactly
100 funds in there.
So we rank very high
is, is the bottom
line.
Uh I can tell you,
as David mentioned, we
haven't finished accounting
for the fis
full fiscal year.
Yet through the
end of
May, our
returns were
about eight and a quarter
percent. I expect
June's gonna be positive.
So we should easily be
over our 7%
and we should
have more than 18
billion in
assets.
Turn to page
27. Uh
If you prefer charts
instead of tables, well,
here you go.
The one on the left
is a measure
of risk. The standard
deviation,
which is a measure of
volatility. How
much does our
return
vary over
different time periods?
We're looking at this on a
fiveyear basis.
So that's a fiveyear
rolling number.
Uh for
instance, on the right March
25 that goes back
to, that goes
back five years on the
average
and
over to the left
uh goes further back
in history.
You can see here we're in the
top 10%
meaning the lowest
risk of this
pension universe,
which is our goal.
We wanna have a low risk
portfolio. We
can't afford too many
interceptions.
You go to the right.
This is
our
return ranking.
Our goal here is to
be above that red
line, which is
the 5050
line.
And in
most cases, we did
that, I think
uh
it's about 85%
of the time we, we achieve
that. So
we're uh we think we're
doing what we should be doing
there.
If you go to the next
page,
this is sort of where
the risk and return come
together I mentioned a
sharp ratio.
This is simply a
measure
of
the amount of return
you get for
the amount of risk you
take think of it as
return divided by
risk. You want to
be in the upper part of this.
We are we're consistently
in the top 10%.
And this really
capsulizes what our
goal is. Get
the most efficiency the most
return for our
risk
page 29
to put this in a little
different
context. In
in very simple
terms,
we, we look at these returns
and 35 basis points
here and 100 that
whatever it is,
um
what's it worth?
And the bottom line is
over the last 10
years, it was
worth an extra
1.6 billion
to the fund
over what we would have earned
if we earned that 50%
line that I just showed you.
So it is
worthwhile. And
again, while we did that
return, we kept one
of the lowest risk
levels and
that's very
important.
Finally, on to page 30
this simply shows the
growth of the assets
in the fund. Over
time. We did
hit 17.8
billion at the end of March.
As I said, we expect to
close the fiscal year at
something in excess of 18
billion. Both of those
were new highs.
So cross your
fingers and hope the markets
uh
help us continue
on that path
with that. I will ask if there are any
questions, sir.
>> Do you want to talk
a little bit about your funding
ratio? >> I'm
sorry, can you repeat your funding
>> ratio?
>> The funny ratio.
Uh
madam chair members of the committee, our
funding ratio as of last year was
64.9%. Uh
It's been fairly level
over the past couple of
years. Uh We do
expect an improvement on that this
year given the continued growth in
the value of our assets,
some of it will be offset by the
continued growth in our future
liabilities as well,
>> madam Chair. If I could
comment, that's one of the
reasons we want to keep
risk low is
we want to give
the changes that have been made
over the last few years
and contributions and benefits
time to
bite if you will and
increase that funding
ratio. Whereas if we
took too much risk, we took
too many losses that
would certainly hinder us and
get. >> Thank
you, gentlemen. You
uh had one minute and
33 seconds
left
on my timer.
Um Before we
go on to questions, we
had some uh senators
and representatives join us
and I'd like to start with
uh first of all, Senator
Stefani. Oh,
you already um I'm
sorry, Senator uh
Antonette Sedillo Lopez. And
then we'll go around the
table.
Thank you, madam chair. My name is
Antoinette Sedillo Lopez and I represent
>> District >> 16. Thank
you.
>> Thank you madam chair. I'm Linda
Serrato. I represent the south side of
Santa Fe and House district
45
>> represent deputy Lord and you can
borrow my helmet any time that you
want to. That's totally
fine. Uh I
apologize for being late. It takes much
longer to get ready on a motorcycle that
is in a car. Anyways
district 22. Thank
you. >> Thank
you. Ok. Now we will stand
for questions.
I'll start with the
Representative Duncan.
>> Thank you madam chair
Mr. Just one quick
question for you on page
nine. Uh the
funding period um
in 24 it was 22
and 23. It was
26.
Um Is that,
can you explain those numbers?
And is that a number that
it's gonna take us 22
years to get to fully funding?
Or
could you explain a little bit more about
that >> madam chair Representative
Duncan? That is correct. So just
a few years ago, there was never a point in
time where we were ever expected
to reach full funding or have
100% of the assets in our account
over the course of the next 30 years
and it dropped to about 46
years. Uh The biggest change
there was the increase in contributions
from the employer piece. We are at
14.15%.
It's since grown to 18.15%.
So those additional 4%
points have made a
world of difference in terms of where
we're projected to end.
You combine that with the information
that we talked about our our projected
growth along with our investment
returns in 22 years.
We're expected to have sufficient assets
in there uh to pay our
liabilities over the course of the next
33 years.
>> Thank you, madam chair and thank you
Mr.
So basically
our school districts uh get
funding and as long as
they contribute more of their funding,
this number will stay
relevant and even
lower. >> Is that correct, madam
Chair? Representative Duncan. So
the, the,
the contributions that we receive
from each of the school
districts is flat that will remain
unchanged. Uh unless the
legislature uh decrease
those. Uh I don't
expect that to occur. But as long
as that stays where it
is today, uh
this is expected to hit in 22
years and there might be another improvement this
next year depending upon
how we refine that data. Uh
But again, it's on target
because right now the board's funding
policy is to have it done
over the course of the next 30
years or to 2049.
And it's a, it's a slightly above
where the board that set the target
to be.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you, Mr
Arch
>> and I will go
to uh Senator
Stefani, uh Representative
Lujan and then Senator
Sadilla Lopez. I
think my question is gonna
be
ok. So
a representative
Mohan, >> um thank
you madam chair. Uh
again, some of the, the questions
that we get when we're asking
is that that risk factor
to your investment factors?
And some of the
we're looking at the investment when
you're talking about
the
to the page manager.
I apologize. I did have
it
for this. So
on page 22 we're looking at
the non US development
equity in your
um in your
asset allocations.
Can you, can you describe
what those uh non us
development equity
um
investments are madam
chair?
>> Certainly. Uh madam
chair, representative
Lujan, those
are stocks
in
foreign
companies traded
on foreign
exchanges.
Uh for NON
US developed
would be think
of uh Europe, think
of Germany, the UK
France developed
economies
uh as opposed to
the emerging market equity,
which would be smaller
markets, smaller
countries say
Vietnam might be in the
emerging market.
So that, that's the
difference.
Um
Yeah, and, and what we investing
in the NON US is
is what's called
a
the shorthand is the EFA
index. It's Europe
Australasia and
the Far East. And again,
it's the biggest
companies and countries
in those geographic
regions. >> Thank you. That's,
that's what I was
asking and you just, you just
um said what it is.
So um is there a way
of getting a breakdown of, of
those markets and how,
how they are contrib saying
here? So non
US is just a
5.1%
but is there,
you know, I'd like to see
if we can get that to the committee, madam
chair,
>> madam, chair, Representative
Lujan, I don't
have a background. But
if you were to simply
look up the, it's called
the MS C
I EFA
Eafe
index. If
you Google
that uh
that would have a breakdown
of, of the makeup of it.
I'm sure MS C I must
publish that. >> I
appreciate that. Thank you madam chair.
I might have another question, but thank you
for that answer now.
You're welcome,
>> Senator Sadilla
Lopez. Thank
you madam chair.
Um
Gonna go through my notes.
Um I wanna congratulate
you on page nine on
closing in um
from 26 years
to fully fund to 22
years. That's,
that's great. That's great.
Work is the majority of
that. Ok.
I know we've made a lot of
changes. Um,
is the majority of that
shift investment
return or is
it, is it, are we see
the fruit of those changes,
>> madam chair Senator Sadilla
Lopez, the biggest change that has
occurred uh because we, the
expectation is we
7% has been our
target for, for a number of
years. Um
You know, and obviously, you know, for more than
a decade, there's been a lot of nipping and
tucking on the program creation of
tier four, you know, tier four
is a lesser value benefit than tier
one. So those obligations
aren't expected to go quite as quickly
in the future. >> It
was like 20 years, four years, you
know, I I remembered it being a
long looking
at it long. So I'm impressed
that, that we're seeing
benefits now, that's why I >> ask.
So. So the cost of living adjustment,
there's certain parameters around that containing
how that's going to continue to grow.
Uh But ultimately, the increase in
employer contributions uh is
really what has driven
a large part of the change over the course
of the last three years.
>> So the increase we made in
what the employers paid.
Ok, great. Well,
congratulations. I think that
that's or I guess maybe
congratulations to us.
Um, because we, we
did that. Um,
so the other thing,
um, the, the
study on,
um, or the, the
audit, the actuarial audit,
I remember in the middle of
COVID, um, we
had a discussion about whether
the, the deaths
were gonna affect the
actual actuarial
uh rates
for our
are retirees.
And I guess what,
what I took away from what
you said is no, there was no
impact >> ma madam
chair, Senator Sida Lopez. The
there, there was a marginal, I
think decrease
in the expected life
expectancy overall
COVID itself didn't have
a huge impact. I think
initially, you know, there is a greater
concern about what it would
do. Uh but life
expectancy sort of has
remained flat. So that hasn't
changed a whole lot and
isn't gonna, it wasn't a recommended
change for after they
evaluated uh the
variables that we include in our
annual evaluation. That wasn't
something that came out as being
anything that was gonna change stuff for us
one way or the other.
>> That's interesting to me. I guess
we're just paranoid during the,
during all of that COVID.
Um
Yeah, and
then,
um
I got a little bit confused
on page 12 when you were
talking about the legislation
that we passed. I, I think some
of it wasn't consistent with
what I thought we passed or
maybe I misheard you.
So, um,
could you just
explain a little bit more the limits
that we put on or the changes
that we put on the limits
on, on returning to work.
Um I don't know if you went
too fast and I, because
whatever, well, could
you just explain a little
bit more? I don't need to explain to you
my
confusion,
>> madam chair Senator Sida Lopez.
So up until this
last year, there were, we have three
different return to work programs in
place. One of which is you can return
to work with uh without
a waiting period.
Uh In a
0.25%
capacity. Theoretically,
there's no waiting period, but you can't
apply for return to work until after you've
retired. There isn't any option
for pre
agreement to return to work
because that's in violation of IRS
rules. So
0.25 you know, if you
return, you, you leave on a
Friday, you can
apply for return to work
on Monday and probably be back at
work the following week. Uh
There's no change there.
One of the other programs that we have in place
is after 90 days, you can
return to work and earn up to
$15,000 that's been in
place for many, many years,
but >> that was increased.
>> So that was increased
from the threshold was increased from
$15,000 to
$25,000.
In that situation, the member is
not required to make return
to work or their
contributions.
The other program that we have in
place is after 90 days,
you can return to work without an earnings
limit for a period of up to 36
months that grew
from 36 months to now,
60 months in that
program, both the member and the
employer are required to make both
the uh
contributions
non-refundable.
>> Ok. Um I, I
appreciate that. I remember when we pa
that's, that clarifies it for
me. I think it went by
fast and that's consistent
with what I thought we did. I
remember when we passed
it, um, we,
there was an estimate of, of
the impact on the fund
and the,
the estimate was that it would have
a negligible impact on the
fund. Is that, is
that correct? Is that it's,
and then of course, that was in the middle
of trying to pass these things very
quick. Um
Do you still
agree with the,
the that these changes had a
negligible impact on the fund
or will have not had,
will have a negligible
impact on the fund,
>> madam chair Senator
Lopez. So there, there was a fiscal
impact and I guess,
uh I, I don't recall
the, the number off
the top of my head, but it was in the
millions. I, I think it was somewhere in
the neighborhood of 4 to 4 to
$6 million annually.
Now, $46 million
to me is a lot of money.
But, you know, when we're paying out
$1.4 billion
per year, it's,
it's small, you know, it depends
upon how long and how far we
extend the return to work rules
because, uh, you know, unless,
um, your article is better
than mine, will we solve sort
of the teacher shortage over the course of the
next two years? You
know, there's gonna be a continued
need for return to work
programs, at least in my estimation.
Um, how long we
extend those programs will ultimately have
a deter will have an impact on
how far this would go.
>> Ok? But,
but 66
to 9 million neg
negligible
in in the scheme of
the $17
billion
>> madam chair Suo Lopez,
I would say in my role as a fiduciary,
I'm not allowed to say
that
>> although I do remember that
several legislators testified,
it was negligence.
>> I suspect it's all relative,
you know, but in our situation, we're
supposed to be guarding against every
dollar lost. So
in this situation, it, it, it
has a negative impact to the
fund uh
negligible
perhaps. >> OK.
I, I think that that's important
because the constitution requires
before we make any changes
to make sure that we understand the
impact on the, on the fund.
And so I was really pushing
for that and I just wanted
to, to see if
you know, if it was
correct. Um
Then I have on
page um
on page 15 and
maybe this isn't, maybe
this isn't what you were talking about.
But I understand that
P er, a benefits are
better than, er, B
benefits um
for participants and
that's got a long history
and, and whatever.
So when you have
these mixes and I'm
not sure if that's what P
er A RT W
is, but when you have these
mixes of people who have
some time in, er,
B and some
time in P er
A, how
does that work? How is that
allocated between the two
funds? Can people
choose the higher fund?
How does that impact the
fund? Um I've talked
to several individuals
who've, who've been very
confused about what it means for their
entire benefit for their
retirement benefits when
they move from one to the
other. >> So madam chair Senator
Cynthia Lopez, what we're referencing here
in terms of per return to work
retirees is the number of folks who
retired from a para
employer. So, if I retired
tomorrow and I went back to work
for the, I'm sorry
for Santa Fe public schools,
I'd be referenced as one of those
individuals that's who you're talking
about. If I want to work for
Santa Fe public schools, I would not
be required to make those
non-refundable contributions
to, er, B
so those are the folks again that
retired from a pera
uh employer. Cyfddoh,
whomever E
A and went to go work
for uh, an, er, B
employer. >> So those are two
separate retirement
careers,
not the mix, not the mix
that I'm, I'm talking about. So, >> so
the mix you're referring to is, you know, we
have a reciprocity agreement.
So you're gonna draw a pension from
whoever you retire from.
So you can use the years of service
credit earned with,
uh, er, B to help
you meet your retirement
eligibility with PERA and vice
versa. You're gonna draw
pension from whoever the employer
is and you're right that the average
pension benefit for a state General
Plan member, uh, I
think is somewhere in the neighborhood of about
$3300 per month,
maybe a little bit more, maybe it's even higher.
But I think it might be about $3500
per month. Whereas the average for one
of our members is $2200
per month. Now, there's a difference in the
cost of living adjustment and obviously
now it's, it's lower
for a pera uh
participant than
it is for an, er, v
participant. But the overall
benefit is higher for an
average per, of individual.
>> Mm, I
am. I've
wondered why
we have two
systems,
um, because they're all state
employees and, you
know, and I know it's got kind
of a weird little history.
Is there any benefit
to uniting the systems?
Would it
affect,
you know, just
when you have even greater
assets? Although this is great 17
billion is, is a huge
amount, sometimes there are
efficiencies. Is there any benefit
to, to
thinking about joining them
or is that just >> madam
Chair Cil Lopez? So
from our perspective, the obligations
don't change. So
if you combine the two programs
today or tomorrow or even
next year, it's not
gonna eliminate the
obligations that have
already been
committed, committed
for these members.
It's not going to change the benefits
that have already been earned or >> not going to
increase the benefits for
the, >> we're sort of, we're
sort of downriver from that,
you know, in terms of whether or not there's
administrative costs
that could be foregone
potentially, I wouldn't say a significant
amount if there were only one director over
both programs, you're paying one salary
versus two and you'd have one cio
versus two in those
situations.
Overall. That's not a
significant, it's
not a huge cost, >> insignificant
when you're talking about >> 17 billion
out of millions. I mean, if you combine the two
funds, you're close to $40
billion and we're paying our operating
budget is $32
million. Yes, $32
million is a lot of money and 90 employees,
but not all positions would
simply go away and
let's pack them under one.
So I I
any, any consideration
of, you know, combining the
two, the savings
associated with it a again might
be, I think maybe
a little bit exaggerated,
but ultimately the, the benefits
wouldn't change. You can't go back
and make up for a difference
in the contributions that have been made on
behalf of our employees. Because for the longest
time, I think on paz end for
employers, it's been close to almost
20% up until
recently. For us, it was 14%.
If you compound that over time,
it would be difficult to overcome
that to say, hey, now we're all going to get the
average same benefit regardless
of where you're at. Obviously, both
institutions were started at different
periods of time when things were a
little bit differently. And I
think there was a greater
emphasis on the value of
certain programs than there were to
others.
>> But another
takeaway, I mean, I think that that's
very important and, and we need to
continue just thinking about
it. Uh, uh, but
um, another takeaway
is, is maybe
do, er, b first
and then move to the state and
you'll, you're coming
from, er, b you
probably get more.
Is that
correct?
If you're gaming this? I don't know,
I shouldn't say gaming the system if
you're making financial
decisions. >> Manage
Lopez II, I can't imagine most
people make their decisions based off of
that. You know, I think it's more so the
career that they're probably
pursuing, you know,
you, you know, obviously
there's,
you know, if you, you graduated from
college and, you know, you're thinking about a career
path. I, I think, you know, tier
four, if you're looking at tier four, you
look at the value of the benefits provided there
versus the benefits being
provided for parasite. If those are your
two options, you're earning
2.5 percent under para
and you're a tier two member,
you're gonna get 2.5%
service credit for every year of,
you know, of your career.
Um Whereas in our situation,
you're gonna get 1.35%
over the next 10 years. So do you really
love teaching? You want to be in the classroom
or do you want to be an educator or do you
wanna pursue a
career
with the state agency? It
difficult for me to say. >> Yeah.
No, I just, it's
just happened to, to talk
to a couple of people who've been
trying to navigate
the, what it
meant for the pension after they've
already done it cause you're right. People
don't make the decision based on
pension, but after they've already
done it, they're like confused about what
that means for their pension
plan. Uh And I guess they
should just call your office and try
to work it out and which is
what I advise them to do.
Um
Let me see. I still have
two other folks waiting to speak.
All right.
Um
OK. I I do have a couple of
questions. If there's timeless, I I
will ask
um we will go to
Representative Lord and
then Senator Thornton.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you.
Uh Probably a quick
question and a dumb question.
But how do you guys decide
where to place your
investments?
>> First of all
laid out in the policy
is what areas we
can consider?
And there are targets for
those uh you know, going
back to page uh
22
say, for instance, on the right
hand side, we're
targeting
uh us equity
at 19%.
So we
look at
and by the way, there are
ranges around that
that are allowable.
Uh you know, we couldn't
put 50% in
us equity, that'd be
outside the range.
So we look at
where are we relative to
our policy? We have to be within
policy. Where
are the markets at any
one time? Do we think
we want to be overweight
us equities or
underweight? And we
look at that all across
the different things we invest
in.
>> So uh madam chair,
so you're speculating then what you
think is gonna be a good investment?
Are you just looking at historically, this has
always been a good investment. We're gonna stick with
this or this is
an emerging thing. We should go ahead and
invest in this because this looks like it's gonna
be good. Is that what I'm
understanding?
Yes. Yes,
thank you. So I have to be
thrown darts. I'm just excited
my XRP is going up. So
thank you.
>> Thank you, Representative
Lord, uh Senator
Aunt
Thorton.
>> Thank you, madam chair II
I go my aunt. So that's good.
You can call me aunt.
Um
a, a couple of questions.
Um I guess first one
very beginning of this
presentation, you talked
about meeting
prudent investor standards.
And I'm curious and
it's uh what
exactly
are included in becoming
a prudent investor.
Uh What are the standards
associated with that?
And you also mentioned that there
were uh every
board member had to go through eight hours of
this prudent investor standard
training. And if they didn't, within
two years, they could be booted from
the board. So would you explain a little bit
about what that means?
>> Sure, the uh the prudent
investor standard is
something that has
been adopted some time
ago in New Mexico Law.
So it is laid out
there. But
essentially the,
the
underpinnings of that
is you must
invest as a prudent
investor would
given the conditions
at the time,
it allows for
investing in what might
be considered risky
assets
in terms of a
portfolio.
And by the way, we pair
everybody who's
investing long term
has risky
assets. Uh
but combined
in a format that
lowers that risk.
So it, it's a very
broad standard
um
in legal terms, it,
it has been tested where
someone made an
investment, investment
lost money.
But as long as
it was prudent at the
time considering
uh the risk of
investments, the
environment.
Then it's, you know, it was
a prudent decision
and prudence, I guess to some
extent is in the eye
of the beholder, it is
not really
narrowly
defined.
>> Thank you for that madam
chair. I so second
question then is regard
to risk. How do you
define risk?
Do you consider
volatility risk?
>> Yes.
Um
>> and the reason I ask that
because I, I
don't consider volatility
as being risk. I understand
volatility can basically
mean things change
rapidly, but
it doesn't necessarily refer
to risk. But
I'm, but that's why I was asking
your definition of risk,
>> madam chair
Senator ant
Senator Thornton.
Uh
when we talk about risk,
we should really add an s
at the end. There are
many types of
risks. For instance,
if you have a bond,
it is subject to
interest rate risk. If
interest rates go up, the value
of your bond goes
down and vice
versa. Equities,
public equities have a different
type of risk. Obviously
the market risk,
bankruptcy risk for the
company. Um
other types of things we
hold have
liquidity risk. We
can't get out of them quickly
because they're private investments.
So you're right. volatility
does not cover
the landscape in terms
of risks. When
we're making investments,
we look at all the
various risk factors
and we're trying to combine
a portfolio of those
that are different, you
know, let's have some
bonds and if
interest rates go uh
go up, well, maybe
stocks will go up
as well or some of the other
things. So we balance
that out
when it comes to after
the fact in
terms of measuring a
portfolio. My
answer is yes, we look at
volatility. How did
that combination of
risks result
in, in the outcome?
So you
are right, just saying
risk is volatility
is a very incomplete
answer. But as a
measurement, it's a
standard measurement that's
used across the investment
industry as
shorthand if you
will.
>> Thank you for that.
Um
I I might want to have a discussion with
you afterwards uh with regards
to this uh on
page nine, where you
went through the chart of
when we're gonna hit the 100%
you said in 22 years with regards
to the uh meeting
the mark of having 100%
ratio.
Um, question
you set a standard for 7%
as kind of the goal, the nominal
goal for returns on an
annual basis.
Um What if you were
to set that goal to
9%?
How would that change
the, the argument with
respect to meeting the goal
earlier? Do you have
any sense of feel for
what that would be? How would that change
our?
>> Mm um,
madam chair
Senator, we
set the goal
based on what we think
we can reasonably
do. We do not
reasonably think we could make
9% if
we did. And we
said yes, let's raise
that. That would shorten
that period.
How much I don't know, probably
considerably,
but we
uh we don't think that's a
reasonable goal.
And when you
look at all of the
factors that you put in an
actuarial
equation, one of
the outputs of that is
how much should you have in
contributions? How
much can you pay in benefits
to balance that C
plus I equal E
plus E? And if
you were to take an
unreasonable
return assumption
down the road, you would say,
oh, we didn't make it
now. We're not gonna balance
this out. We need
to put more money in
or, or, you know, you
might pay too much in benefits,
not have enough contributions.
So we don't think a
9% goal
is reasonable in
short. >> And the reason
I asked that and the reason I I asked
that question is because
uh I know that
7% is great, especially
when the government's telling you inflation
is 3 3.5%
or whatever they claim it's to
be, we know it's not
that we know it's actually much more
than that. In fact, it's typically
about the equal to the M
two money supply, which is
about 7%.
And so what you're really saying is
you're matching inflation rate,
which is OK because you're
not hurting anybody. But we're
actually, we're
actually staying about the level
that M two money supply is being entered
into the, into the
uh environment if you will.
And so, so the concern
here is that if you really want to
get ahead of the game,
my challenge is to see if
we can do better than the
7%
so that we
can make sure that everybody is
covered in the long
haul. Um
And so that's really my
challenge. I think 7%
sounds great.
Um But I think it's really just
matching what, what the M two money
supply is currently being
inflated at. And
so,
so there was a push to,
to make you think maybe,
maybe a little bit differently about
how we can do a little bit better
than, than the 7%.
That's, that was the only challenge
I'd like to present to the committee.
Um One
last question, it's in regards
to I, I
think uh Representative
Ward say asked the question, how do
you make investment
uh decisions and maybe
there are some policies in wine
and since I'm new to the board
here, I'm, I'm trying to understand all of
this. I noticed
that you had two things here and you
had real estate as one
of the things that you invest
in are those like reits
in terms of reits
or investment,
not, you're not actually buying
land. It's my understanding is that
>> correct? Uh
Mr uh Madam
chair Senator,
uh our real estate is a
combination of
res publicly
traded uh real
estate investments and
private investments
and those private
investments.
We invest in a
fund. We hire a
manager through that
fund to go out and
make individual
investments. They will
buy,
build uh
apartment buildings,
retail
office buildings,
industrial properties,
a wide variety of
things. So it's a
combination of public
and private. It is
mostly
private.
>> Ok. Thank you for that. Uh
Madam chair. The other question I had with
regards to the corporate bonds.
Uh are these us treasury
bonds and, or corporate bonds
or are they just us treasury
bonds per
se,
>> madam? Chair Senator. The
core bond segment
is a combination
of investment grade
bonds which includes
treasury bonds.
It includes corporate
bonds that have an
investment grade rating
and we have the ability to do a
small amount in below
investment grade rating.
It includes mortgage
backed securities
and other types of
asset backed securities
which might be a pool
of auto loans, things of
that nature.
>> Thank you for that madam chair. One
last question with regards to
uh on this
allocation and
maybe it's included in the
diversifying assets. But I noticed
there are no commodities included
in this. Is that, is that forbidden
or is that, or are they
included in, in the diversifying
assets?
>> Um Madam chair
senator, uh
in looking at this, I see
a couple of categories
got dropped. I'm not sure how
that happened. One of the
categories we have is called
real assets.
We generally don't
invest directly
in the commodity itself.
We're investing
in the producer of
that commodity. So
maybe it's an oil and
gas company.
We do have oil and gas
investments or
uh a company
that
uses farmland,
uh timber.
So we do have what we
call a natural resources
portfolio that
is commodity
related.
>> Thank you for that um Madam chair.
I think that's all the
questions I have. Let me just
check real quick.
I think that's all.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
>> We are going on
to
the people who haven't
asked any questions
yet is a Senator
Iguela, uh
Senator Gonzalez.
And then if we have time, we'll
go back to Senator Sadia
Lopez
and just in the interest
of time. Um actually,
our lunch will be here closer
to noon. And
today our sponsor
is Marco Gonzalez from
Capitol Complex
strategies. We are
having Chinese food
for a change
and Um
I did, I have
to say I did forget to
order drinks guys. So
you guys have to be on your own
for your own drink. So
um water is
nice. Um
So uh Senator
Figueroa,
>> thank you madam chair.
I'm going to reference
page 20 just a little
bit to get some
clarity on how
this works.
The contributions
include the contributions
from employers,
the schools and school districts
and the employees. Correct.
Right now, our employees
are paying 10.7
percent and
the employers are
18.5%
1518
18.15.
Thank you. I can't read my
own writing.
Um
And we have raised both
of those
more than once in
the last decade.
Correct?
Yeah.
Um
and then the investments
have
KS according to the charts, they're
7% target over the
last decade.
But in
general terms,
how much of the monthly or
you can do it annually,
income
or revenues are
from contributions
versus investments.
Is it 50 50
90 10? What
is it? >> So madam
chair and Bob can uh include
on this, but basically, you know, last
year we collected about one point
and it's referenced in one of the
slides here so
that it's,
it's
the difference is much less than it
was three years ago. Three years ago,
I think the difference is about $400
million per year. This
last year we
collected uh
retiree payroll was
1.3 billion. We
collected 1.2 billion from
employee employers. So about
$100 million difference
for the period that ended
June 30 last
2024. You reference
now the difference is about $250
million this last year.
But uh it varies each
year.
>> Madam chair and director. I
think you misunderstand the question.
I don't want a comparison year to year.
I want a comparison
of what
comes in via
contributions. You said
1.3 billion and
that's a year and
what comes in from the investment
returns in that same
year, >> madam
chair. Um
Senator, if I may,
I don't know the
exact
proportion. But
I know some years ago
our accounting department
studied that. Uh
I know it was there
was, if you looked
at each dollar going
out, more of
it came from investments
than from contributions,
I think it was something like
6040
that is a little bit old.
That was before a lot of these
changes. I don't know
that we, I don't think we've refreshed
that. So
historically, I would say
it's probably about
6040
>> and 60
was investment.
OK. That's,
that's what I was looking for.
Thank you. Um And
then the other side of
the equation
benefits right
now are going out in three
different tiers, madam
chair and the benefits
at each tier are
different. Who
has changed those
benefits in the last decade.
Again, those have been
changed um
multiple times, does
the legislature change
them? And this is for the benefit of
the committee because we have new members,
madam chair and we all need
to understand how this
works. Madam, the
legislature sets the
contribution percentages.
We are entirely in charge of
that sets the
benefits,
>> madam chair Senator Figueroa. So
the legislature sets the
contribution levels, as you mentioned,
they also set the
cost of living adjustments.
That's not something that the board has
authority over, but
they also set those
tiers. So those tiers have been
set by the
legislature.
>> Thank you, madam chair
and thank you, director.
That's what I wanted to make. Sure
everyone understood that these
are decisions we make as
legislators and these
are the decisions that have
changed the
funded ratio and our
funding period.
So dramatically
in the six years
that I have been on this committee,
I have seen it change
from that downward trend
where there was no point
in the future where we were going
to be fully funded
and there was a point where we
were going to start
totally dipping into
the fund and
eating it away to pay the
benefits required and we
have made some really
hard changes
to turn that around.
Um, and while
it's always good for
us to consider
how we can make improvements,
um, I think we need to recognize
the changes that have been
done and
that they have been
in the span of a
pension,
recent changes
that need to take
hold and
fight
to use. Mr Jack saw's
words um
so that we can continue
to see the
upward trend as
long as it's upward
will be ok.
Um But that was my
point there. One last
clarification madam chair on
expenses. The
expenses refer to the cost
of paying our staff, paying the
er b paying the
director,
um the building,
the electricity, getting those
checks out
to all of those
retirees. Um
those are expenses.
What percentage
is that of what's going
out every month?
Because I believe
you said 32 million.
And to me that seems like
0.07%
ish. >> So madam chair Senator
Firo. So that's just the
operating expenses of the agency
that doesn't include money management
fees or anything we pay for the
investors separate.
He could give you a separate figure for that. But
yeah, basically your
budget grows to about 33 million
this year 33 out of the
1.3 billion that
we're paying out as a small
fraction of the overall
cost. >> Ok.
Thank you, madam. Chair. Those were
my questions.
>> Thank you, Senator
Gonzalez.
>> Thank you madam chair and
thank you for the presentation.
It's always a
uh refresh it and then
lighting to go through
all these numbers.
Um
The, the part that I was
gonna ask is
um it
was mentioned about
the teacher
shortage.
No,
you know, as the
education program
as retirees,
we're always getting the
individuals where they're at the
high point.
So they would be
drawing, you know, to
wherever the equation falls,
you know, with their retirement
and what I'm seeing is
so
on, the shortage
part,
should that be something that
we should
start working
in some manner
to how does
that equate to
do what he does to the
program,
>> madam chair Senator Gonzales.
So, you know, just in
recognition of the fact
that I don't anticipate, you
know, every year around this time we'll
probably receive, you know, on the
news, we'll see something about, you know, there's
a number of shortages across the state
and specific school
districts. I don't know
that pension
changes with regard
to return to work are gonna
make a, a
significant difference on
whether or not that reverses
or that there's gonna be an increase in the
number of folks that decide to go into the teaching
profession because of, you know, a
return to work allowance.
I think, uh from my perspective,
it provides a temporary patch,
you know, and it, the,
I don't know that it's necessary a
solution, uh,
for this.
But certainly, you know, in
recognition of that, you know, we're
not, um,
I'm, I'm not
standing here adamantly
opposed to mo
modifying the, the period of
time in which people can make those
changes from or 36
months to 60 months. Even though,
you know, it costs the organization
money. Um, II, I
don't know that, that necessarily answers
your question other than, I don't
know that the teacher
shortage is directly related
to return to work
allowances or
uh what's going on with
the pension allowances or the benefits
that we provide? >> Oh
madam Chero,
and you work with
what comes to you
and uh what I'm seeing
is so maybe
one year might not be a big
thing. But if you look at 10
years and if it
continues,
you
obviously will not be
receiving the
contribution
at a higher level
versus that if he was someone
that's qualified.
And uh and this is what I'm
seeing is uh
uh is that something
that um I mean,
as our part,
as legislators that we need
to recognize that
and work with that in a
different form
because uh
10 years of uh
whatever it is, 1%
2% eventually
does make
AAA Dent
into
it.
So madam chair, that's
my part. I think that we
uh I don't know how we would go
about that, but I think
something that maybe
perhaps more incentives
into
the part of
working with the universities
and enticing more
individuals to going into
the field to have more
choice and more
certified individuals
coming in versus being on a
shortfall.
Thank
you.
>> I think we got everybody's
questions. We're gonna go back to
uh Senator Sadilla Lopez
briefly.
Um Thank you, madam
chair. Um And this is
actually related a little bit
to um what um
Senator Thornton was
talking about um this
whole volatility volatility
issue on page 22
I was looking at the actual
allocation versus the
target. Um what
accounts for
the difference between the actual
allocation and the target.
And what I was thinking about
was how
are you dealing with all the crazy
volatility we've been
experiencing
recently
and um
is that related to the difference
between allocation and
target?
>> Excuse me, madam,
chair representative.
Thank you. I, I'll start
by saying, you know, I mentioned I've
been doing this about
18.5 years for
year B I used to have
hair when I
started.
Uh
Yeah, there, there has been a lot of
volatility lately. Certainly
a lot of it's been around the
tariff issue
and that has been
difficult to deal with
because in the morning,
you might have a 50%
tariff proposed on
somebody. And then
uh as as it's called
taco hits
and no,
we're not gonna do that. It's
10%. Uh
We try to keep a long
term perspective
and in fact, we have to,
because some of our
investments
are in long term
funds that may have a 10
year life and
we do not take
that money out during the life
of the fund. Uh It
comes back to us as things
mature
as to why there are
differences. Some of
that is certainly intentional.
We did
in March lower
our equity exposure as
we expected, tariffs would
hit the market
in a negative way.
Um We did
reverse that when now
it seems the market is not paying
as much attention so we're
closer to our equity
targets.
Some of the times are,
are locked up by 10 year
investments. Some of
those have gone up in value
quite, quite a
lot and
it puts us higher than
we want to be in
terms of a target.
But that's a good problem to
have >> the value
in >> it so
that some of it
is intentional, some of
it is not intentional
but a good thing. >> Great.
Great. Thank you.
And I know we're,
it's controversial to
look at what's hap
with the policies
of the entities that
you uh invest
in. But something that I've been
seeing a lot um
recently is these private
equity funds, these, these re
these private equity
real estate funds,
uh purchasing properties
in, in New Mexico and then
just squeezing them dry,
not making improvements,
raising the rents, whatever.
And I know that's controversial.
But do you ever give any thought
to that? Because I think that's
gonna bite them in the
end, I hope, I hope
it bites them in the end because
I hope that the value goes down
or I hope we do something about it.
>> Yeah. Uh
madam chair
representative,
as I mentioned, our perspective
is long term, that's
a short term
perspective that
you're right in the end may very
well not work out
in terms of private
equity.
We emphasize
private equity managers
that are going to add
value to a
company. They
may do it by
improving the
operations. A lot
of times they'll have a uh
a consulting
board that can help a
small company
grow, going
into new markets, uh
better efficiencies,
um
or they can,
they can take what's called
a platform. They will
have a company
that they will add new
companies to and build a
bigger company and
ultimately sell
that. Uh
we
typically don't
do managers
that will just buy companies
and put on a lot of debt
and cross their fingers.
We don't think that's a reliable
way to produce
returns for the
fund.
>> Well, yeah. Well, we've
been seeing it with the real estate,
with this private equity
funds and I'm glad
I'll talk to you offline about whether
there's a way to identify
them, um
to,
you know,
to avoid them. Um
And then I think
I had
um just a very quick question
on page 29
the 1.6 billion
um which is
fantastic.
Um It returned
but does that, is that net of
expenses?
>> Uh madam
chair >> representative,
>> yes, all of the returns
in this, in this
presentation are net of
expenses. We
don't think it makes sense to
give you a gross number
before expenses
because that's not what we get to
keep in the fund.
So yes, everything
is net. >> Thank you. You should put
that because it's even more impressive.
>> Uh There is, I did
put it as a footnote on
one of the pages
uh
page
26.
I believe
it's a small footnote
but, and I
think >> all right, I
see it in this
presentation
but I just that when you're
talking about the value added,
um I mean,
the expenses are, I
don't know what the expenses are,
but I'm glad to know that it's net
net of expenses and I
appreciate it. And I think a
footnote there would have been really
powerful. >> Thank
you. Thank you.
>> Thank you madam
chair. >> Thank you. I'm
gonna go back to Senator
Bobby Gonzalez.
>> Thank you madam chair
and uh also to
my colleague
to my left um
based on uh what I
brought up, she went back
and did some figuring
that equals to
4%
you take 4%
say even
five years or 10
years. So
the point here is on the
contribution coming
in versus
what the actual
would be and not
having certified
individuals.
So say, even if it's
half of that or a quarter of
that, you know, that's quite a bit
of an
impact.
Just wanted to share that with the
group.
Good
research.
>> Um Thank you. I think
we've got, we've
uh gone over everyone's
questions and actually,
I was, I had a list of questions
and as we went around the
room, I crossed
off the question, the my
questions because they were
answered, but I do
have um
uh two,
well, actually three
really quick questions. Um
How many managers do you
have? And how many have you
fired
in the last
year?
You and, and if you don't have the
answer, you can get back to me.
But I'd like to know just
in general terms.
>> Um in terms of
the managers, we've
fired, I
don't think we've
fired any.
Um
Typically,
um we
don't madam
chair, we want to take again
a long term view. And
if a manager isn't doing
very well for a
year
or for any period of time,
we'll look at that, we'll say,
well, are you following
your strategy?
Uh Is it just
bad market
conditions?
Uh And you know,
can you recoup
this?
So,
actually, historically,
public pension funds
are somewhat famous
for firing managers
just at the wrong time just
before they turn around.
So we tried to avoid
that. Uh I mentioned
we have a lot of,
and I, and I don't have the number
in front of me. We have a lot
of, uh,
locked up
investments.
You can't fire those
managers unless
they are really
doing something wrong
and the investors get
together. We're just one of
many. And you
say, ok, you're out, we
have done that.
Uh, as I think about
it, maybe in the last year
we did fire a
couple of them
on those long
term.
>> Maybe after COVID, I,
I'm, I'm
guessing
>> that gets to be rather
messy. You have to bring in
another manager.
Uh, there's contractual
provisions on
the monies they
get. So
you don't like to do it. It's got
to be pretty extreme, but we have
done a couple of
those. Um,
in terms of the
number,
I'll just just throw out a number. We
may have 100
managers. We have a do,
do have a large number >> and
then related to that
question, I just wanted,
wanted to know,
how do you all look at
your fees for those
managers, um, when
you're doing the contracts because
fees can of often
take up a
significant amount of
uh funding
from the fund. So I
just want to know
how you guys manage
those in just
briefly if you could
>> madam chair,
um, the amount of
fees will depend on
what
sector the manager is
in. If you were
hiring uh a public
equity manager, that
fee would be relatively
low, you're hiring
a private equity
or private real estate
manager, those fees
will be quite a bit higher
and they'll be structured
differently.
What we try to do
is we try to look at
what is our net
expected outcome,
given the fees, given
the return they can
produce. And we
evaluate that over
time. Every
year, we go
back and look at all of our
private managers and
say, did they produce
a better return
for all these fees we're paying
them versus what we could have done
more cheaply in the public
markets. And
again, we look at that on multiple
years, we try
to negotiate those fees
as low as we can.
We've been successful a number
of times in getting
lower fees,
but it, it
depends on the individual
circumstances. We,
we are sensitive to
fees. Again, our
target is that net return.
We know fees reduce
that.
>> Thank you. I'm I just
wanting for the
for all of
our knowledge.
Um When they do
these negotiations on the
contract, those fees can
often be significant.
So I'm glad you guys
are cognizant of that.
And then the my last question
before we take a break, I
think our food is almost
here.
Um
is
in order to
bring
the fund
up to 80%. And I know
you have a strategy over
years. What would be that
bottom line cost?
That just
so we all as legislators
know if
we were and I know your,
your target is 100%.
But if we were to bring
up the fund to 80%
fully funded, what
would be that
range of
in, in terms of dollars?
Um How much are we talking
about? Just
uh and you may not have that
number now, but if
you don't, that's
fine, you can send that
to all of us because I think
that's a significant
um number
that we should
kind of be thinking about
and give us also
100% if you
would. >> So madam
chair, uh
madam chair, basically the number of the
difference between we're
about $9 billion
from where we need to be
in order to hit 100%.
Uh So to get to 80%
I think somewhere in the neighborhood of
like 3 to $4
billion would
get us to that 80%. And obviously,
as those, I mean, it's measured
every single year, you know, the
year that it goes below and it's
78% they're not gonna
get that adjustment,
but the number is substantial
>> and I realize it's not that simple,
but I just want
to have
an idea of what we're
talking about in terms of
getting to 80% and
getting to 100%.
So what we know
sort of the variables
and I know that contribution
rates are different for
Pera and all the
different however
many plans they have now
42 or whatever it is
and you have now
how many you have three tiers,
right? So it's
all those contribution rates
may be
different, >> madam
chair. So the, the contribution rates,
what the employee and what the employer
pays is the exact same
regardless of the tier that you're
participating in. We have four
tiers and that
basically means
that benefits that they earn on
an annual basis is
different. >> Ok.
All right. Um
>> Madam chair, if I could go
back to fees one more
comment, um
One of the ways we need
mitigate fees
is we do internal
management, but we
talked about core bonds
that's managed internally
by a small
team when you
can manage something
internally and
you can do it as well as
hiring an outside
manager.
You will pay less
in fees period. Now,
we're limited in how much
we can do there, but we do
a couple of things internally
to, to lower the
amount of expenses we
pay, we
do what we can
>> and you guys are doing a great
job. Thank you. Um
I don't see.
There's one more question
from Senator Figueroa.
>> Thank you madam chair. Your
question. Actually made me
think of this. And
I'm looking on page
617,
page 17 in the
conversation of how
Cola's we have a
funding period. Now
that's been brought down from
26 to 22
years. That's a funding
period to 100%.
But the Cola
adjustment factor
will start
changing and
factoring Cola's
will start going up when
we hit 80% fully
funded. So do
we know
how far ahead on our
current trajectory?
When what's the funding
period to the 80%
mark >> madam chair,
Senator Figuero? We do, I don't have
the number in front of me and I don't want to quote you the
wrong amount, but there was a calculation that was
done this last year about when we kind of
plan on hitting those targets based
on all our assumptions,
meeting expectation.
>> Ok. Thank you madam
chair. You can email me.
Appreciate it. All right.
Well, >> thank you gentlemen. Uh
Mr Archila Mr Shaw,
great presentation. It's
very informative.
Um Our food
is, I just
got a text that our food
is uh coming
up, almost coming
up the elevator. So we
should, it's uh
chopsticks in the
middle of construction
zone. So getting
to the capitol is backed up, but
they'll be here any second.
So we will reconvene at
one o'clock with
uh P
>> er A Mr
>> Chee. Thank you.
