certainly stayed in touch and
and we would talk and and text
back and forth about the various
bills that were coming up in
committee and she would voice
voice her opinion and and and
help guide guide us by her
wisdom and all of her years of
experience at every level in
public education so it was very
sad and I was very saddened to

Reasonable or at least of the
there are more palatable than

As you know there is some
additional work for these be
done on this bill and so Mister

six and I move this ammendment
at this time Mr speaker and kind
gentleman.
Gentleman and I believe it's

website we can fees for the two
oh two number.
Mr speaker the tier two numbers
point two two zero zero eight
two point four.
Gentleman to explain the
amendment.
Mr speaker and.
The amendment essentially
there's a couple things
The person that makes clear that
bank accounts and M. investment
accounts the
that or has the ability to
protect twenty four hundred
dollars
amounts over that amount can be
subject to attachment.
We make sure that there's clear
language about state total of
twenty four hundred dollars not
twenty four hundred dollars for
account and so we have a
language that the deals with the
we also
have cleaned up some of the
language to.
separate the procedures by which
garnishment is from
attaching those accounts the
next major thing to.
Burden.
From the Committee substitute if
they have unlimited.
Household goods and furnishings
and the procedure and we have
limited that amounts to seventy
five thousand dollars for all
household goods and furnishings
that would be subject to
exemption and unable to
Be a patch by the judgement
creditor.
There are several.
Where a wide wage
in certain portions of the bill
I'm happy to go through those if
you wish one of the managers of
time on his hip the majority are
areas.
Next the.
major item is the.
Unpaid.
We strike the existing paragraph
nine and we include a new
paragraph nine to deal with the.
Fifteen thousand dollars
The interest you personal and
tangible and intangible property
benefits for a variety of ways
to deal with.
Things of and the person's
wages.
The amount of.
The
gentleman from consistent rules
to allow members to bring
pillows on the floor.
Lows and blankets.
The rooms are spending.
And I appreciate everybody to
sleep all be happy to get
through it
we we also have
some changes going back for more
the original language
that was in the original bill
with been changed in the
committee serves three for
bringing back that language for
claims of exemptions and
priorities and section merry.
the with that I will stand for
questions Mr speaker.
Is this a fund management Mr
speaker this is not the most
exciting.
Yes it is.
Okay is there.
Discussion on the amendment.
I'm gonna give members a moment
to say there's discussion
Senator needs to.
Gently Chavis to is to debate
the amendment for the bill.
Generation Chavis Representative
Ezzell.
Mr speaker thank you very much
well the gentleman from.
Chairman.
End of two zero in the early and
Lincoln you please.
Mr speaker in time lady I will
you'll.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Hold on just one moment.
Mr speaker I know that is as far
as this particular bill goes.
I have gotten lots and lots and
lots of emails from.
There is institutions located
throughout our.
Right state here in addition to
lots and lots of phone calls and
emails.
Have these particular entities
been notified about your
amendment that you are
proposing.
Mr speaker and gentleman our
gentle lady I don't know whether
all the institutions have been
notified us to know if
we contacted
one member who we've been
working I don't remember one
person that we've been working
with from the one of the banking
associations and I requested him
to also notify the other thank
you so situations to make them
aware of the amendment and to
garner there
review and support.
Mr speaker I.
Like all the phone calls emails
and everything I've got
regarding this I just want to
make sure that this amendment
does take care of the concerns
that have arisen from my.
Correspondents and and the.
Boys concerns and I know it's a
fairly long and management.
So Mister speaker I.
Thank goodness survey internet
is back up we're if there is a
concern we can hear something
from them shortly in the course
of the discussion on this
amendment Mr speaker and
gentleman thank you very much.
These are for the.
Is there objection to it.
The house floor amendment has
taxation and revenue committee
substitute for House Judiciary
Committee substance for us just
six is adopted gentleman from
Chavis and Lincoln you still
have the four.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman just a couple
questions to get paid for a
general idea of what we're doing
with.
This bill allows.
Of course to.
money to exempt from attachment.
Certain property and certain
valuations those about.
That is correct.
Mr speaker gentle like could you
briefly talk about the exemption
for the primary residence yeah
maybe the value there
First of all I dress concerns.
Mister Walker with the bankers
association and administrative
chair Senator bankers
association had been tapped to
this morning.
We are.
Of this bill and.
So what is that expansion I.
That.
Sure.
We had to buy a hundred.
Association chairman of the time
we got to the house taxation
committee members yes that was
part of the negotiations for the
homestead exemption is
increased.
Sixteen per person.
Procrit the.
Proportion.
For a couple that's a fifteen
percent increase but it has been
since two thousand seven.
Exception for people succint
that disabled people fifty five
and older.
Two forty so Mr speaker and
gentleman I hope that answers
your question.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you and so everybody
understands.
If you or.
There were new also no secured
creditor over that amount and
nothing in this bill deals with
secured creditors so let's make
that perfectly clear secured
creditors of people holding
mortgages for having a security
interest in property that's not
what this bill for tax or exams
Representative what we're
dealing with is an unsecured
creditor has the ability to
attach items of property.
That or that or.
And exceed the amounts that were
set forth here and and so Mister
speaker and gentleman what I
heard you say is if it's a
married couple.
That have valuation of a home
the full two hundred eighty
thousand dollars that would be
exempt from attachment is that
correct.
That is correct.
And so.
Judgement creditor and secured
judgement creditor would be able
to attach any would be over and
above the hundred and eighty
thousand dollar
exemptions provided in the
statute.
That is also correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman another
major item will be personal
property and household
furnishings and things like that
the limit that we now please
stand this legislation is to
allow people to exempt from
attachment also birds and and
items and furnishings I think
it's called in the amount of
seventy five thousand dollars is
that correct.
Now provides for that that is
correct.
And so Mister speaker and
gentleman.
This the efforts of this bill is
to allow people in the state to
continue their life in a
reasonable fashion but still
a lot of judgment creditors to
secure a judgment and.
Realize the proceeds of the the
assets of the dead or that
exceeds the exemption of miles
but it's our intent and has been
our intent for many years to
allow people to reasonably
liberal hundreds yeah I'm sorry
monogram of standard of living
but not an extravagant wanted
without being actors statement
Mr speaker and gentleman.
What.
Mr speaker and gentleman for
also limited the amount of money
that the a judgment creditor
could attach to forage Fund and
also right there thank you
sounds similar investment
accounts and so we've we've
dealt with those issues so that
the person still receive use a
portion of their income still
has twenty four hundred dollars
of thirty can use of in the bank
that can't be attached in the
executed on them so we are I
believe this.
It is one of those bills that
balances the needs of the
creditors to secure repayment of
the debt rates at the same time
allows our citizens at least
some modicum of the standard of
living that will not force them
into bankruptcy will not force
them to be tossed out on the
street and they can continue to
live their lives and hopefully
continue to be productive
citizens Mr speaker and
gentleman I thank you for
bringing this bill thank you for
working with the group of many
stakeholders that were involved
and coming up with some
resolution to the is a very
difficult issues and recognizing
that the nineteen seventies or
eighties when the what when the
bill that were amending was last
amended that we bring those up
to reflect more modern are
levels of that would indicate so

gentleman from Bernalillo
Representative Martinez are you
reading on house bill one
twelve.
Yes please get me to the point
Mr speaker and gentleman I
collection necessary for placing
House Bill one from the Senate
on final passage has been taken.
Gentleman to explain.
Thank you Mr speaker has won
twelve is amended and it's
locally funded health programs
like indigent care programs from
discriminating on the basis of
immigration status
Mr speaker most communities
already do the right thing and
they don't discriminate but
because we federal law passed in
nineteen ninety six
some community still have a very
narrow analysis and so have
continued some of these
practices that federal law
allows those communities to
provide those services so long
as there is affirmative state
law allowing them to do so our
bill today would be that
affirmative state law and with
that Mr speaker I stand for
questions.
Gentleman from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr speaker.
The gentleman from from
Bernalillo.
I yield to the gentleman from
someone.
Thank you Mr speaker
So I was reading through the
previous provision and it's more
one sentence counties by there
county commissions are
authorized to make agreements
with state or county agencies or
other agencies for the care of
sick and injured persons.
Yes that is what we're replacing
that correct Mr speaker system.
the that is correct Mr speaker
and gentleman.
Yes Mr speaker and gentleman
in your
opening statements.
The statement for the purposes
of this to allow contingent
non residents to be able to also
be able to.
take advantage of the same
healthcare that's offered to.
Residents in engines that
correct.
Mr speaker gentleman
these are indigent care program
so I I would call them health
care programs that are usually
served a purpose of last resort
that can help people cover a
very small part of their
hospital bill ones are out but
but yeah that's the that's the
intent.
Thank you for that.
I guess the reason I'm asking is
because why didn't I just have.
A simple sentences says
regardless of residency status.
Mr speaker and and gentleman
yeah I mean that that's that's a
fair question I think that
because a lot of different
the way I understand is a lot
different statutes are touched
by these into care programs and
so hence why the bill is six
pages and not just one sentence
I mean that's that's just part
of the drafting process but yeah
I mean I I would agree if we
could do it once and we would do
in one set.
So Mister speaker and gentleman
as I'm reading through this
And I I look at the fiscal
impact report which I think is
very inadequate.
because it takes this.
And then added and on page two
of section one
under subsection be.
For the purpose of this section
health care services means
treatment and services a line
that designed to remove.
Help improve health including
primary care.
Prenatal care dental care
behavioral health care provision
provision of prescription drugs
preventive care or health care
L. the services provided by
stating agency county local
government for state educational
institution named in this
article.
so Mister Bennett says of
article twelve section of the
constitution Mexico foreign
entities with which the state
agency County local government
or state education institution
name in article I section
whether the constitution of New
Mexico.
Contract to provide such
services.
That's very specific language Mr
speaker and and and gentleman
that that that actually seems to
maybe be in
More specific maybe than than
what the original statute was
meant to include
Mr speaker and gentleman I.
Is it necessary to define that.
Mr speaker and New York and San
Juan you know each each
different local community has a
different type of indigent care
program some of are going to
include some of the things that
you see on here some of them
will not hence the use of the
word or toward the end of that
paragraph right so if you're
Pacific specific County and
there is program provides all of
these things.
What we're seeing here today is
that residents of that county
who are not here with
you know immigration
documentation that they are not
left out of the services but it
does not require any community
to find all of those services it
is only if they already provide
them within their scope that
they open those programs without
discriminating.
Mr speaker I'm reading this with
the edits in context and it says
and the war.
Which to me would seem to be
that this is a requirement.
Regardless of what they are
already providing.
so it just seems to me this
becomes a mandate for all of
this the way I'm reading it.
Yes my my copy does not state or
S. as in.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
think regardless of the issue of
this building
Trying to add in non residents
to this to to make sure and and
as you stated that from what I
understand from our local
hospital that is already a
requirement Mr speaker and
gentleman is to
they already provide yes if
you're in a genuine Gen the
matter and in those questions of
immigration status are not even
something that is that is done
and so but what I see here is a.
What what could be for many
hospitals a dramatic.
increased to this to the scope
of this section
since they can't all do and and
maybe can't afford all of this
what I'm seeing now is a mandate
so the money from my standpoint.
Thank you for this if this bill
were to just add.
To the end of the section there.
To.
Important for not to exclude.
There are persons based on
immigration status that would
make sense because in reality I
think across the state and
that's exactly what's happening
anyway what I'm seeing here.
Is a prescription for indigent
care that might break the bank
if you're old if you're at a
hospital because now you're
asking a local hospital.
I to provide primary care.
I don't care.
and if that's not something
they're already doing is not
already their scope of practice
this this is a huge mandate on
hospitals.
so Mister speaker I'm I'm just.
Wondering eight I think that you
can get everything that that
that the title says that you're
looking for.
Is to make sure that
Non residents are excluded in
health care that that is
provided for indigent care and
needs of local communities but
what I'm seeing here is a
massive.
Increase.
to the scope of what they're
gonna have to find
maybe you could explain it to
the left for that because I'm
not seeing an exclusion as you
described.
Yes so Mister speaker and
gentleman I I will we'll agree
to disagree
for purposes of this section
health care services means
treatment and services line to
promote improved health
including primary care prenatal
care dental care behavioral
health care provision of
prescription drugs preventive
care for health outreach
services so if a particular
County provides everything
individuals you care program
which they probably don't
because these are very very
limited purpose but if they did
then that's what all of these
would I.
More than likely they don't and
so whatever little they do
find that's what we define.
So Mr speaker and gentleman I
think what I'll do is I will get
a hold of my local hospital and
let them know.
That could mark this date and
time on house for to to so they
can.
If there is some push for them
we have to increase care that
that that they can afford that
so we can point to according to
what you're stating here is the
intent.
Wall
is to just as as I'm
understanding the state today
the only thing that your intent
is just to make sure that
whatever is provided to you to.
Residents indigents would also
be available to non residents is
that correct in my understanding
that one hundred percent correct
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman that it
is I said all this is doing is
allowing local communities to
open up their into care programs
to people who otherwise meet all
the eligibility criteria income
levels residency what not just
don't tell them no because they
don't have immigration
documentation that's always.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman on just trying to make
that clear because a once again
as I'm as I'm reading this just
seems like a machine.
On funding and attention the
mandate so thank you Mr speaker
John.
Thank you gentlemen there is
further debate the gentleman
from Lee Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo yield.
I yield.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
believe Russell one of the
analyses.
The potential cost creating the
counties.
Was served on the server million
dollars to two.
Do you recollect State leftovers
are.
I do not Mr speaker German.
Mr speaker and gentleman who was
actually calculated to.
Hope.
Has a one hundred dollars per
month.
Non residents turned on eight.
residue.
Multiplied by the.
Just to let of the.
Hello.
The number of people here.
And here's the question would be
to for.
All the gentleman from Sam wants
line.
Could this be a.
Hey mandate that is not funded.
Mr speaker and gentleman not I
do not recollect seeing that
that costs in the in the fiscal
analysis I do not believe is an
unfunded mandate Mr speaker and
gentleman let me reiterate once
communities are already opening
up their programs to to people
without you know without proper
immigration status it's already
happening and and most most
counties
this will be clarifies that in
fact and then and the few that
are not it's asking them to open
up their programs to those folks
the reality is number one we're
not asking for more funding
we're not asking for more
services all asking is that
programs that are designed to
support indigent patients do not
discriminate against this
particular group of people and
again most communities already
do the right thing they have
nothing to to to worry about.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo could I refer you to
the first page of our fiscal
impact report down toward the
bottom third of the page
crash states.
Sixty six thousand noncitizens
who are uninsured of fees
eighteen thousand of income
limit below a hundred and thirty
eight percent.
Of the federal poverty level
eleven hundred sixty eight
dollars per insured individual.
With the potential.
Our.
Seventy seven point one.
Million dollars.
Mr speaker and gentleman what
are are creating with you the
most counties in the state for
our whole ready providing the
services for those that are not
all.
Your current the Hey.
For a significant increase in
the fund's record to provide.
Those services.
Would you.
the speaker Gilman I I think I
think the the program you just
read the analysis which is yes
and that's assuming that
currently none of these folks
are receiving services through
local into care programs which
as I stated earlier is just not
accurate most communities
already allow these folks to use
the services I I don't think
that number is accurate I think
I think the input into their
analysis is is wrong and
therefore the output is wrong.
Okay Mr speaker and gentleman
of course institutions would
normally be providing these
indigent care services operated
for example in my community is
mostly hospitals is there.
This is a similar situation here
in a for a statewide.
Mr speaker gentleman I I believe
that's the case I believe most
of these agreements are set
between local governments and
their local hospital.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Do you believe that most to take
care of that occurs in these
hospitals is so minister.
In the emergency room.
Mr speaker gentleman I.
I don't want to
that that would be my assumption
tell you why I think that
because there's a lack of health
care coverage health insurance
type of coverage across the
board I think the most.
Folks are gonna end up in the
emergency room unfortunately
so my assumption is probably yes
I I don't have hard data from
the.
You Mr speaker and gentleman
from Bernalillo nor do I
believe is the experience and my
County.
Mr speaker and gentleman do you
know what.
Hospital would normally charge
for emergency room visits.
Mr speaker and gentleman
Too much.
Mr speaker and gentleman hi I
completely agree with you all of
long
term care stands on a three
legged stool one of those Lexus
quality.
One of those is four ability and
the third is availability.
And our policy with respect to
pedicle care for all of our
citizens for particularly those
or not paying anything for the
services is simply need to make
some attempt to introduce some
rationality into that.
Price.
Services model.
I think emergency room visit.
For a person to be with
insurance would normally base
somewhere in the neighborhood of
six hundred dollars and I agree
with you yes it is.
This is a whole lot of money
beyond the reach of most two
digits one of the reasons why
that.
His first in such a manner is
the services have to be provided
for free.
Somewhere Mr speaker and
gentleman.
There's a better one.
I'm not sure that just solves.
One leg of that stool which is
availability thank you Mr
speaker and thank you gentleman
from Bernalillo for your answers
thank you.
The gentleman there is further
debate the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker and all the
gentleman of my neighbors from
Bernalillo county yield a yield
to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
Thank you
Thank you from bringing this
gentleman and and I just have a
couple of clarifying questions I
hope that helps clarify Mr
speaker and gentleman is
indigent care a comprehensive
cover everything mandate
mandated coverage such as you
get with an insurance policy.
Mr speaker and gentle lady nope
no it is not it really covers
the bare minimum usually to help
people cover the costs of that
emergency room visit and usually
only a fraction of that cost.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
gentlemen and is some.
Is a county or a hospital
required to continue providing
coverage if the indigent fund
state has been maxed out.
Mr speaker lady no.
thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I think that's correct
and having utilized not
personally but professionally as
a therapist on behalf of
patients trying to access the
indigent fund.
over the years and in different
places it it runs differently in
different counties depending on
how much funding they have
available how much is given only
getting utilized and a service.
For instance one here I might be
able might have been able to get
indigent fund to cover for one
of my patients.
And the next year or not
because of of availability of
funds as well as the priorities
established in the in the
community as to how extensive
and it wasn't just hospital
services necessarily although
that was probably the priority
and many hospitals Mr speaker
and gentleman have outpatient
departments for for different
things so it's not just the E.
are just impatient
but it is
Depending on the individual and
the priorities and availability
of of of funds that
services can be provided or
assisted in the and not
necessarily completely free
either but assisted in covering
the services but.
If from Mr speaker and gentleman
if someone can't get assistance
to go to outpatient or to to get
a service where is it that they
and up getting the chair.
Usually.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
service programs would usually
get the chair of the local
hospital.
although in communities like
Albuquerque we do have
a network of community clinics
that often times will work with
the hospital of the community
clinic will provide you know the
the preventive care the primary
care usually through through you
know philanthropic dollars and
and low cost
fees but often times these here
in our community renew county is
you know there's a need for yes
or there's a need for you know
something else that the care
program is supposed to and in
some cases it's supposed to
support but sadly as you said
earlier I mean most of these
services are are very very very
involves and you know it it is
what it is you know health care
is expensive an indigent care
programs are there to help
support the poorest of the poor
which is a fraction of the cost
I also want to add one last
thing if I may Mister speaker
deleting you know these are free
services
these are people who work and
pay taxes and contribute
yet they can fax it is things
like insurance through the
health exchange for Medicaid or
or any of the programs so this
is really just a way to.
Make things a little bit more
fair not quite fair enough just
a little bit.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman yeah you're right
about the the community clinics
does it have
at community clinics or what we
call federally qualified health
centers have some state funding
and federal funding to help
Hey some of the costs of those
services but those those funds
are also limited and provide a a
limited scope of services if you
will so primary care and so
forth but someone might need
something more and if they don't
end up being able to
say see a specialist or
something as their beyond the
scope of all of the health
clinic
where they end up is
eventually probably the E. R.
which is the most expensive
place to to try and get regular
care Mr speaker and gentleman
you you
Also raise another issue is that
there are a number of
individuals whether they are
documented or undocumented but
as non citizens who cannot
purchase insurance through the
exchange nor might they be able
to get Medicaid.
And Mr speaker and gentleman of
the current state of affairs is
they really can't purchase it
off the exchange either there is
very little insurance available
for people to purchase who don't
if you don't have who are
citizens.
And and so this is really an
issue Mr speaker and gentleman
where people are really caught
in between even if they could
afford to pay something
and could have afforded to pay
for some insurance they may not
have that available to them but
they can't pay a hundred percent
out of pocket and need some
assistance.
And in Mr speaker and gentleman
it I think it's true that around
the state most smaller hospitals
use their indigent funds for a
for a citizens of their
community regardless of
citizenship status
Committee and in Albuquerque at
the at the university Mr speaker
and gentleman of the university
hospital also gets
none of the funds a great deal
of middle of the funds to
provide indigent care and Mr
speaker and gentleman
The university is one of those
hospitals that has
Read about the interpretation of
the federal law and whether
they're allowed to offer their
indigent program UNM cares to to
non citizens is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentle lady that
is correct.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman this is the this is a
significant problem and in
Bernalillo county in particular
and so I just want to thank you
for bringing this four and and
make some of those clarifying
points that
for some people Mr speaker and
gentleman they don't have other
alternatives
to get insured and
they're going to end up and by
federal law has to be seen and
treated in the ER and if they
don't have a way to help pay for
that it may be uncollectible
debt but that's the most and
expensive place to receive any
kind of routine or specialty
care is in the E. are so
inability to not just pay
hospital but you UNM it would
apply in their UNM's care I
think to their out patient and
so forth not just impatient for
E. R. but more broadly than that
so again Mr speaker and
gentleman I just want to thank
you for for bringing this
forward in some I believe
everyone has a has a right to
access health care and we put up
a lot of barriers that I hope
this helps eliminate some thank
you.
Thank you very much there's
further debate next is the
gentle lady from Travis
Representative Ezzell.
Mr Smith and Mr.
Members we want to make sure
that we have a clear pathway to
Representative Ezzell.
I've got a clear pathway.
The gentle lady from Travis
Representative these L..
Mr speaker I will proceed thank
you Mr speaker for stepping over
Mr speaker will the gentleman
from Bernalillo yield.
I will yield to the gentle lady
from Travis Mr speaker thank you
very much a Travis county does
have been into to fund and I
know that once upon a time there
was
a period for that indigent fund.
Was almost nonexistent and this
was ghosting I can't remember
how many years ago Mr speaker
but that was the time that a lot
of.
People that were coming again to
New Mexico
trying to get citizenship and
this is not that long ago that
this happened that fund was
almost zero and Mister speaker
I just want everybody out there
to realize that the indigent
Fund in those hundred and
seventy federally qualified
health cures cities centers in
New Mexico is paid for by the
citizens of the county Mr
speaker would you agree with
that gentleman from Bernalillo.
Mr speaker and a lady yes the
the funding for of any of these
programs comes from the people
who live in those communities.
All of a hundred to seven of
them to be exact Mr speaker
there's twenty seven non federal
qualified health centers in New
Mexico is that correct Mr
speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Thank you lord for it Mr speaker
gentle lady Mr speaker gentleman
from Bernalillo you're the one
that has the bill and you should
know those numbers it is twenty
seven.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Of our rural areas struggle
already with health health care.
we see.
The number of doctors that we
have a our rural areas areas
declined to go all the time.
it's a struggle for lots of lots
and lots of areas outside of the
metropolitan areas Mr speaker
gentleman.
Two that come to mind.
R. von New Mexico which is I
don't know if you're aware for
bonding is.
Of it is as you are leaving
clines corners going towards
rules will you will drive
through phone the other one is
care of those so which is north
west of rudos of New Mexico.
And right now.
If this bill is adopted.
I want to know how this will
affect those two towns that I
just brought up that part of the
twenty seven non federal
qualified centers and in New
Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentle lady all
this bill does is it will allow
them to serve every residents of
their local community assuming
the meet all other eligibility
criteria without regard to their
immigration status the and again
that's assuming they don't do so
already they might already do
so.
Lots of berries in our state do
that it already Mr speaker and
gentleman from Bernalillo but
also those those.
Twenty seven areas that I'm
concerned about.
Because all the one hundred and
seven federally qualified health
centers in our state.
We are ready at the state of New
Mexico already has a large
population of the handicapped of
homeless.
Of elderly.
And they don't receive these
benefits.
Why are we trying to reduce the
health care for the those.
Certain popular members of our
population.
In.
Our effort to try to take care
of everybody else Mr speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker and and lady those
folks all of receive these
services assuming they are
income eligible.
Mr speaker maybe I didn't make
myself clear it does include the
homeless.
So.
I'm kind of curious about the
less statement you made Mr
speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Mr speaker gentleman.
In your bill on page I think
it's page two yes it is at the
top of the page to visit these
services are designed to promote
love of of primary care prenatal
care dental care behavioral
health care.
Prescription drugs preventive
care health outreach.
But it also will take care of
the ambulance services is that
correct Mr speaker gentleman
from Bernalillo.
Mr speaker and enjoy the of the
indigent care program the local
community covers that cost thing
yes.
Mr speaker and gentleman will
also cover burial expenses.
Mr speaker really that's a good
question it actually came up in
committee and I cannot recall I
think he was one of our
colleagues who brought that up
but I cannot recall.
And Mr speaker is it covers all
hospital and medical expenses
the more correct there.
So long as that's what is
covered under the particular
indigent care program.
Mr speaker I'm afraid.
That I cannot support this field
mainly because of what it's
going to do our smaller
communities such as funds such
as cares those and those are the
two that are most familiar with.
They do try to take care.
Of these people that we were
discussing here in your field.
But I'm afraid with.
This being mandated now.
That it is going to break the
health care system.
That is already broken in the
rules parts of our state Mr
speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you for your
answers.
Very much stimulating then you
have a continued debate
listening the gentleman from
Bernalillo civil and
municipalities across San Juan
and Valencia Representative
Garcia.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
kind gentleman from Bernalillo
P. yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
all those counties.
thank you Mr speaker and fun and
gentleman of.
The can you to provide certain
noncitizens for me please.
Yes Sir these are folks who are
in the country some of
undocumented others documented
but not quite captured by you
know by the way some of these
programs administer their
services right so that you can
you can have a permanent legal
residents for example for kept
out.
Fund document could have certain
refugee populations I have a
refugee community in in here in.
Mr speaker I I lost two point
engine the legal.
Can you can you hear me now I
can answer going.
Yes so the speaker down into
your question these are folks
who might be in the in the state
without immigration documents
rate undocumented people this
could be some legal permanent
residency could be refugees
there's a host of immigration
status means
you know that could fall out of
coverage but they live here they
work here they pay taxes here
the worship with you and me they
go to the same school as we.
their neighbors.
Mr speaker and lunch to begin.
I think the advantage of them
and
Thank you Mr speaker run the
gamut from Bernalillo the reason
I brought that up is you know a
lot of these are not documented
renewal of ages we want to call
them survive Mr speaker funding
to move toward your they do pay
taxes you know in a lot of the
people that are paying taxes
either through the right culture
number wrongful skewed number
the bill pay tax in the system
Mr speaker point and of and they
get no benefits out of the you
know into may that is just.
And the people that are working
deserve to get coverages to the
state for all rural we need to
do it of Sri Fund in the.
Because you know they're they're
paying they're working they're
our neighbors we will have
dinner with sometimes and that's
the the whole state so we know
we can change that Mr speaker
point in June but ledger but the
bill of you know I know personal
friends of mine there are the
legal for non documented that
are working in there are working
people the P. their taxes like
we do and the date of I think
we're one of the representatives
of the can you buy insurance
because they don't have
documentation and they are
willing to of by their own
insurance.
If the state will let them with
the insurance company will let
them.
You're not allowed to do that.
Just simply because you don't
have papers and they're working
here Bobby harder most with more
than this State Mr speaker point
in the film those are just
concerned online and comments
and you know I appreciate your
bill may be sheet Spiegel you
serve Mr speaker I yield my time
thank you thank you thank you
very much gentleman there is
further debate the gentleman
from Travis Etienne Otero
Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman yield.
I yield to the gentleman.
Thank you
Representative.
I am familiar with the the fact
that.
Hello some counties handled
there enter the indigent care
what I'm trying to.
Understand I thought I heard you
say.
I went back and read this that
there was a.
Is there a separate fund that's
out there the state will
participate now to the county
level.
The speaker Dylan most of these
this is local programs will fund
the program out of out of the G.
R. T..
and my understanding is that the
second part of that money to the
state and then the state
redistributes it back
but like I said earlier they're
they're pretty limited
unfortunately there's just not
you know a great deal of of of
funding for these programs.
Yes.
So I can double check.
Your order for your bottles yes.
And J. I..
Payments for the lack of a
better word.
Reimbursements a percent back to
cities and counties that
included in that is a line item
for ended here is that correct.
the speaker gentleman I I don't
know the
you know the technical process
in which it is done in accounted
for lander standing is that you
sent in the form of a
reimbursement to the local
hospital directly on behalf of
whatever in teaching care
program exist
that's my own.
What I'm trying to.
Understand is.
With the passing of this piece
of legislation.
Read one hundred percent of the
indigent care costs be covered
by the state.
Mr speaker don't anything really
depends on on the local
community but it's it's I think
for the most part supported by
the local community.
And in general and then.
Would I be correct in saying
that the only support.
That County maybe get.
From the state would be.
That.
Portion of G. R. T. that they
get back to it and I guess the
county directed toward the
indigent care should they so
choose.
Mr speaker and gentleman I again
I think local governments have
their programs set up
agreements with local hospitals
are made and on
care that is not paid for by an
insurance policy or the
individual will become subject
to whatever indigent care
program that individual is
eligible for so I I you know I
really depends.
Okay Mister speaker General
thank you for your answers.
Thank you very much gentleman
there is further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo for
Roybal Caballero.
Thank you Mr
Speaker and thank you
Representative I'll I'll be
really quick I had lowered my
hand but since you called on me
I will
wanted to just clarify a couple
of things I noticed that I saw
in the bill and I think this is
important to note that there's a
whole new section
Called new material starting on
page five and that is the
statement of nondiscrimination
and I as I read through the
entire bill and in terms of the
purposes of the changes Mr
speaker Representative I just
wanted to make sure that we're
doing nothing other than on
ensuring.
That the state of New Mexico
continues to protect
against all forms of
discrimination according to not
only the constitution of the
United States but the
constitution of the state of New
Mexico is that correct Mr
speaker and representative.
Speaker gentle lady just.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you
Representative I think this is
incredibly important we know
that health care has been one of
the areas that has been.
Exceptionally are prone to on
discriminatory practices against
our vulnerable communities and
as Representative on Garcia
mentioned in his comments Mr
speaker and representative I
think we have an obligation to
do everything in our powers
within the state of New Mexico
to continue to protect
especially our most vulnerable
populations and I'm speaking Mr
speaker and and Representative
particularly reference to the
most recent
Comments and
Statements that have been made
when we were discussing
repealing an antiquated to bill
in our most recently and those
were that we heard atrocious
stories about women and women of
color particularly being
discriminated against but not
only that harms in irreparable
manner because of their
particular status either is
women or as women immigrant
women and we have absolutely
No business in any of our
affairs of the state of New
Mexico allowing discriminatory
practices which is why on you
and I and others in the in the
Senate have been very strong on
our anti racist institutional
racism bills and efforts across
the board in the state of New
Mexico so Mister speaker and
representative I commend you for
bringing this bill forward I
think our immigrant families as
representative Garcia mentioned
we are are contributory are in
every manner as as in our
workforce in our communities as
our neighbors and I as taxpayers
and so they must be afforded the
exact same protections against
discriminatory practices so
Mister speaker and
Representative thank you very
much for this bill I support you
one hundred percent thank you
very much gentle lady there is
further debate the gentleman
from Bernalillo of of some
Garcia.
Thank you is the most speaker.
The gentleman from Bernalillo
you'll.
He'll to the delivery of.
Thank you is the most bigger
German from Bernalillo.
as well.
The gentleman from Bernalillo
this is a very commendable piece
of legislation.
I just hope that the body kind
of in the face of into
consideration in terms of a the
flag.
On the final passage.
Is the most Baker
Mr speaker general member of the
office.
Me give you an example.
That I experienced.
As a student at eastern New
Mexico university sophomore.
Back in nineteen seventy is the
more speaker.
It is very relevant to what
you're bringing for the bank.
Speaker
No we don't want to repeat.
Those.
Thanks in the past that that
would discriminatory practices
towards accessing health
services.
This must be
I bet though is the beautiful
AP.
Earning with Sally Sanchez.
her mom was a.
A single mother farmworker there
in the.
In the Four Fonda's area.
meaning that a lot of of farmers
in the Phoenix.
which part that is is world
famous for stimulus seeker.
And
I was I was pretty young no
nineteen twenty nineteen years
old when I baptized Jr.
sophomore.
At eastern New Mexico
university.
And no the child I thank you for
picture my wallet.
To this date.
As the more speaker and
Little selling.
got sick.
She came down with the real back
case of dysentery.
And
Re uh vomiting.
Michael Monday.
Go to the hospital but I miss
madam speaker and
Basically the the baby was
denied trading.
And
You know pale as point sheet of
paper.
and
so she went this must be good to
the General Hospital there but I
was.
And
I had a policy.
fifty dollar deposit.
even in this case in terms of
emergency treatment.
Naturally Michael monitor.
Didn't have as a means fifty
dollars back in nineteen seventy
you can imagine what that would
be worth today speaker.
And the former occurred.
can afford that much less.
Even if a regular citizen only
none of.
Nine to five job five days a
week.
Fifty dollar depositors must be
fair.
So what happens is the most the
printer from Bernalillo is
Committed to settle settlement
And she died early the next day
early in the morning.
Former complications.
Mr speaker
as of the end of the story.
went to kind of students on
campus it and I was chairman of
the Chicano organization of our
our.
As we set up on a good line at
the hospital.
Demanding one thing.
Is the more speaker at the
hospital drop their
discriminatory policy charging
fifty dollars deposit.
And our.
Because we're not.
It is a bigger one on.
It brought in many people.
Of all colors.
And David was instrumental
estimates the current kind of
really making headway.
Is that the local K. as a church
the pastor and all the prisoners
join the picket line.
And also.
Provided for funeral.
Expenses.
My commodity very settled Sallee
two more speaker.
It is the most because I think a
line you had both of your
participation at that figure
money and use it for eastern New
Mexico very helpful fun games
must be.
Financial is no speaker the
hospital at no.
Course.
But to change our policy.
That.
Thirty days after that'll sell
the direct.
So as the most because from
Bernalillo.
I can relate to your
legislation.
No because I could see what can
happen.
You know if we don't.
Implement.
The legislation in some type of
legislation.
At the races right those
barriers.
Hello but actions are the.
Regardless.
Economic status.
Misleading.
Rations that is.
Age etcetera.
Thank you is the most Baker
thank you gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Gentleman there further debate
the gentleman from San Juan for
five years.
Thank you Mr speaker the
gentleman from Bernalillo
currently you'll.
Able to deliver on our.
Thank you Mr speaker thank the
gentleman from Bernalillo.
as I understand this bill I
think one of the the benefits it
will be to our state if I'm
understanding this correctly.
Is currently making the county
emergency funds if if those are
depleted that how I understand
this legislation is that it will
allow
The difference to be paid by the
state instead of the county
having to pick up the difference
is that correct Mr speaker.
The speaker domain the bill
doesn't speak to that all the
bill does not and gentlemen and
ensure that local community.
And implement their your program
is unique on the.
Thank you Mr speaker
and no expert on this front I
thought this does help the
counties but maybe there are
some other discussion to have
That was one reason why I think
we should support this
legislation but beyond that I
also want to ask questions to
make sure that the language
doesn't have any unintended
consequences.
Mr speaker under the affordable
Care Act unlike most of plans
there's a certain enrollment
period.
And it's my understanding that
batter Roman period.
Restrictions don't necessarily
apply to undocumented persons.
And so my question Mr speaker I
just wanna make sure that the
language that we have in the
bill today.
Isn't going to change the
outcome for undocumented
persons.
Mr speaker and gentleman
undocumented people cannot do
not qualify for any of the
federal exchange programs
even if you had a pocket and
they're not allowed different
injector programs have different
sign up periods of mine here in
Inverness county and sort of on
a it's it's rolling you can go
in at any time and and and and
and roll for an indigent person
each community has their own
process.
Thank you Mr speaker and senator
three quarters nothing in the
text this bill is going to.
Interesting that for in the
undocumented persons.
Mr Chairman one hundred percent
like I said access.
Image coverage and in some this
is axes and.

Gentlelady from Bernalillo
Representative seven Jana are
you ready on that I don't want
to get the chance to get me to
that place the first insurance
the more I can let the record
reflect that all action
necessary for placing House Bill
one forty one on final passage
has been taken and that it is
now subject to debate amendment
for substitution gentlelady to
explain the bill.
Thank you Mr speaker house bill
one forty one amends the
definition of education
technology infrastructure using
the public school capital outlay
act it uses part of the ten
million dollars from the public
school capital outlay fund
deficiency correction program to
cover the cost of infrastructure
and services this is to provide
temporary wifi hotspots prepaid
subscriptions or service plans
to teachers and students for
access to remote learning all
over our state Mr speaker I
stand for questions.
There is the big the gentleman
from may Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker will Jim
ladies to.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from Lee.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
The previous definition of
through this education
technology infrastructure was
limited to physical hardware and
now we have added services to
prepare sufficient physical
hardware implies capitol Monday
at one time expenditures for a
not all growing requirement to
six PM Monday.
Not just finish your repairs
down the road Hey we need to.
Characterized as change as of
now allowing funding to the span
for cooperation rules but it
spends.
Operational expenses thank you
Mr speaker and gentleman family
this is part of the capital
outlay fund it has a part that's
deficiency correction programs
and this would this would
correct a deficiency in our
education process in helping our
kids get the wifi hotspots they
need and prepaid subscriptions
they need and service plans to
the students and the teachers
all over the state and this may
not last forever but right now
it's needed for the education of
our kids this is very important
to a lot of kids all of our
state and our teachers all over
our state and
it's something we need to do and
that's what the funds for to
help our help our state.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady.
You just or this provision will
allow for the placement of on
going service plans and
subscriptions.
Of of operational nature not
paid capital how one of the
major.
Mr speaker Gen printed to them
let me talk to my experts maybe
I can clear it up you can clear
it up a little bit more I will
be right back.
Mr speaker gentle lady one more
question is are creating for
your call could be recorded for.
Is there a sensor for years
where it would go back to more
capital related functions when
to comment pandemic is I just.
All right Mr speaker and kind
gentleman so we did go to your
right is it it is not capital
but the board council we went to
them and asked me if I
definition of work for but the
fund is used for and they said
yes they believe this is those
this is an acceptable expense on
your second question doesn't
have a sense that no the reason
it does not have a sense that is
right now we're using it because
of the pandemic it's than the
pandemic has opened our eyes to
all the kids who don't have
access to internet and that just
isn't going to stop is it going
to stop just because the
pandemic goes for still going to
have kids all of our state who
do not have access to this needs
to go on for a while.
We we don't need it when the
when we have a thank you for
that the wires late for the
satellites for we need them to
to so that everybody can access
the get it have a connection
access wifi but right now we
don't have that and right now we
don't know when we're gonna win
this when we went everyone in
our state will have the
opportunity to get a good
education and use the wifi we
need so it doesn't have a sense
that but when we get to that
point we can have a sense that.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for the answer.
Can you understand why there
might be some consternation.
Thank you for home growing
operating expenses if you will
all of capital outlay funds.
Do you know could you describe
for me the source of the funds
that are going to be used to pay
for these ongoing expenses is
yes.
Cool is this Robert COVID
consequence of the soil of
phones for example.
Right now I know the capital
outlay there's ten million
dollars from the public school
capital outlay fund deficiency
correction program I don't know
as far as severance of funds but
I believe that is what it's from
but I let me just right.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
All right Mr speaker and
gentleman it is from
supplemental severance tax
funds.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady.
On going efforts is from bonds
which does give me pause.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady for answering my
questions thank you kind of.
Generating I don't see any
further debate the gentle lady.
No but.
On the border in the.
There is no okay now we see the
gentleman from Lee on the board
there is further debate
gentleman from Lee
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you Mr speaker with Joan.
Finally do you.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from the.
Speaker primary.
Can you explain to me the
outcome of the city council
outreach lawsuit and have
impacted their original sin
million dollars.
That was allocated to some and
sixteen.
If there's he care in kind.
Going.
I will have to get specifics on
that I will be right back.
Thank you.
the SUNY capital outlay lawsuit
created the state and local
match and that works directly
with our
how our schools are funded and
our schools are funded we have a
specific funding formula makes
everything people are.
Thank you.
Mr speaker and.
And to go back to them in time a
little bit with respect to the
ten million that I think was.
Written in the law in two
thousand fifteen and then act in
two thousand sixteen.
At the time in two thousand
sixteen.
By my calculations about eighty
five percent of the school's
connected.
In the average.
Broadband speed Martin fifty
seven filled by for secretary.
In the.
As we move forward through the
years we got into two thousand
twenty Mr speaker and cuddling.
We are now at ninety nine point
eight percent.
The schools connected at an
average speed of five hundred
nineteen kilobytes per second
this is my data and calculations
confirm with yours.
is referring committee.
I don't know I don't know what
those are but I'm sure you're
correct.
If that's if you look at.
Thank you and as I understand
the state schools Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
Is to have connection somewhere
around one megabyte for
students.
Perspective for students that.
In my reading that correctly.
Yes that Mr speaker and
important so in the
Because it looks like we've got
the majority of our schools
connected right now but we're
not by this is feed the the.
Those two phones from the state
level and then feeding bill.
The.
Senator.
We there for for students but we
are working on that Mr speaker
and gentleman.
I was.
This.
I apologize for the
interruption.
In order to multi tasking.
all of us the way I read the
data and I'm I'm excited that we
we've gotten to the goal almost
all the way to the goal of.
with respect to connecting our
schools I think we still have
some up for.
The needs to get there to
actually get to the original
full.
Five years ago getting the one
megabyte per per second per
student.
Which of the I have a goal.
And so
As I look through that.
Mr speaker and filling.
As I look at the numbers.
It looks like about only eight
percent of the ten million
dollars of one.
For setasides in the public
school capital outlay.
For this please use last year is
the that number correct as of
September the LC Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
I will need to technically
expert witness Mr speaker and
kind hold on.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
Mr speaker kind gentleman we
have ten million to use and one
point eight million was set
aside for broadband projects
last year.
Thank you Mr chairman thank you
kindly for that that means my
number of eight percent of those
are fun the twelve percent from
closer to twenty percent of
spending in the Mr of the total.
So if we if we have a phone
service side of of fifty
million.
Over the last five years what
what what are total spend offer
that fifty million Mr speaker
and kindly.
Mr speaker kind of and if you
ask the question again so fifty
million over five years what
were you asking about that
please.
Mr speaker and then kind lady
That's the bill we started
spending in two thousand and
sixteen.
We've got three two thousand
twenty.
At ten million a year total of
service I would have been we're
actually the fifty million.
And.
Looking for some kind of number
on actually how much we just
spend Mr speaker and finally.
Mr speaker and provide element
of the fifty million nine point
four million were spent over
those five years.
Thank you Mr speaker paneling.
Can you do me a favor and
explain what happened.
Mr speaker and leading to the
other forty one point six
million dollars.
Okay hi Mr chairman and Mr
speaker and gentleman so
That money was
spent and but it it doesn't mean
it has to be spent over period
it is unspent and used for the
capital outlay for.
That is the we still have forty
one point six million.
leftovers that the effective
house bill one forty one should
have the would would apply to
this what this house bill one
forty one where does that mean
forty one point six million that
was not spent.
Way back in just the.
Public school capital outlay
than was available for schools
to use for any other projects
that may fall within the the
normal public school capital
outlay a program.
Generated the grown New.
So I'm sorry Mr speaker family I
did not understand your answer.
All right Mr speaker and
gentleman yes what you just said
was correct.
Everything.
Public school capital outlay the
forty forty one point six would
stay there until needed for use
I would buy the definition in
the capital outlay at.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
kindly.
So.
Go through.
The end of your bill.
Simply put for me for for
current family and the objective
of your bill is connect promote
teachers and students.
In the The impetus for those.
Who's really what happened Mr
speaker and family over the last
year due to the pandemic with
that being for substance.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
would be a fair assessment but
what it did was really let
everyone know that there are
people there are students out
there I think it's sixty six
thousand students who do not
have internet service twenty
thousand didn't have computers
it you know when when kids Mr
speaker kinda then when kids
come to the classroom and you
asked me if they can do their
homework the state yes yes maybe
they have internet they say yes
but a lot of them don't and and
that's what we're finding so.
So we have a problem as far as
connectivity sixty six thousand
kids without internet internet
as an intern the ability to have
internet is a large number we
need to fix this this is why we
brought this out we have a a
broadband bills and this is just
part of that bill to make sure
kids have what they need to be
successful it's an equity issue
that everyone rural or rural or
inner cities have with the need
to be successful
that's what we did this that's
why it's needed this is going to
go any away anytime soon and
that's what we have this bill
thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Thank you Mr speaker and finally
I I.
Totally support with the the
emphasis furnaces and and with
the statements that you've just
made I agree and Mr speaker and
traveling when we heard this in
house transportation.
One of my concerns at the time
was whether or not.
this is going to be a violation
of the anti donation.
And.
So and I know the house joint
resolution line is passed
through various these continue
on over to move to the Senate Mr
speaker and families Fund and
the bills with a piece of a.
In talking with legal counsel
a multitude of them.
When asked how how could we
accomplish this the goal of this
bill.
Mr speaker internally without.
Filing let's assume that house
joint resolution.
Nine didn't pass social Senate
joint resolution nine didn't
pass how do we accomplish those
without.
Violating the anti donation
that.
And in so.
Creative minds work through this
and and then came back with Mr
speaker and families of as long
as.
The public schools.
Issue this money out.
To the school districts the as
long as the school districts
maintained ownership of.
Property whether it was inside
personal property or not.
Then.
We could we could.
In theory skate around the
inside the nation costs
Mr speaker currently is that the
panelists here experts are
telling you as well that is
correct because coming from the
school it does go around the it
does not affect institution
class or is not affected by the
answer and I division class.
That's what we did teachers
also.
Yes Mr speaker and on line and I
appreciate that and then I'd
bring back to your earlier
statements that and talk to
students to have the tools they
need and sometimes also yes and
sometimes will say no
Firstly in in my district.
You know we place an order in
June Mr speaker paneling for.
Over two thousand years so we're
supposed to get.
Free State within six to eight
weeks
The cost of a little over six
hundred and ten thousand dollars
to as an unfunded mandate.
And we didn't receive those
computers until.
February of this year eighteen
Mr speaker paneling that that
you can imagine.
The point school districts
needed two thousand Chromebooks.
To be able to service for rural
population the student
population and have the work
without those for.
Some German six months even I
think I can fully understand the
frustration with the this is
potentially there for every
school districts in the state
and again.
As we talked about house
transportation I really truly
want to support this bill but
there are some things about the
bill the phone lines still
struggle with.
Since I continue on Mr speaker
impending.
As as I read.
The public school capital outlay
in state local match calculation
sheet Mr speaker and family.
The calculations are defined.
In this bill from.
Item page through L. on pages
two and three.
Sen Bynum ever were the first
first things binance Mr speaker
kind lady.
Only.
Fifteen percent of the schools.
the yield calculations Mr
speaker Pantaleon for the new
calculation.
are eligible.
For a funding rate of seventy
five percent or greater from.
From the state.
And so what that means is that.
In.
Areas where we have really low
density.
And.
This morning very in in some
areas
school districts that.
Don't have.
Percent percent of amortization
covered by revenues high enough.
Only fifteen percent of our
schools Mr speaker and finally
actually qualified for the ten
million dollars a year.
That is right of the state
paying seventy five percent in
schools and twenty five percent.
In any goes a lot.
Thank and it gets worse as we
continue on.
For for for a multitude very.
For school districts.
Only thirty one percent of.
Of the total school districts
rating on.
So the first listed on the stock
in the.
We're able to receive funds for
a fifty fifty right which means
that they needed to borrow a
million dollars.
They had to come up with five
hundred thousand.
This doesn't seem very.
The cool Committee.
Yeah so this the the bill and in
this case Mr speaker I'm
waiting.
I think the pandemic.
Proves the point totals with
respect to our lack of
connectivity across the state
important and I agree multitude
of bills that are running
through the house right now and
on the Senate side we're trying
to correct those.
In some form or fashion.
I agree with some of those bills
and I disagree with some of
those bills.
On just based on language and
how things are done for.
In this case.
One of the one of the things
we're doing is we're trying to
connect students for trying to
connect for most teachers.
Because of the situation the.
Stated in costs.
And there's no the quality.
For that cross the state in just
as you described on the Zuni
capital outlay lawsuit.
I don't think the system thanks
for the full year.
The.
So I have concerns move with
with how we approach this and
also in the school systems
Are going to be able to actually
access those funds so Mister
speaker and timely can can you
walk me through that because
again I have concerns the this
this isn't.
This is a.
Who cross the border.
Albuquerque didn't create the
situation Mr speaker finally
we can increase the situation.
San Juan increases nobody
created the situation.
But.
We're not treating you will be
fully.
So Mister speaker paneling and
like trees for a little bit of
time if you could.
Help me wrap my head around.
How this is going to be a good
bill for eighty nine different
school systems across.
The state of New Mexico thank
you Mr speaker thank you kindly.
Mr speaker and gentleman give me
a few minutes all right back.
All right okay Mister speaker
and kind gentleman so this is
what I would have heard the
public schools state and local
match calculation is designed to
account for local property
wealth.
That can be raised to local mill
levies eight and and do do and
and Gallup do not have that
wealth in order to raise this
but you're area in Albuquerque
public schools and and of
different areas due to the state
and local matched trying to find
Gallup and SUNY more revenue to
make up for that.
And it's more about equities any
quality Clinton's.
Yes
the formula formula is a bigger
debate and just a really part of
this bill Mr.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you.
Mr speaker thank you kindly I
agree that for those of our
conversation but the formula
gets free to the answers and so
that's why I'm asking about it
I'm not asking about how we
calculated this.
Looking at how's calculated and
I do agree finally uses this is
about equity and.
The.
I was discussing this the other
day.
I'm sorry.
This is kind of a weird analogy
but in in my eyes just because
someone Mr speaker and family
can afford to go buy a new car
first is a new car for example
necessarily mean that they need
to or should be made to go buy a
new car would you agree.
Mr speaker and gentleman I guess
I believe I would have to know
the value of the New Mexico or
if I had to walk twenty miles
that new car would be of value
so Mister Mr speaker and
gentleman.
I understand I understand and I
appreciate that answer I guess
the point I'm getting to is that
they shouldn't be made up to.
This is a personal choice.
kind of and I ask my students to
do homework every night and I
almost have to make them because
a phone.
Just.
And then again Mr speaker
translating they make a personal
choice on whether or not they
choose to do that.
And there are consequences to
that.
And so to each decision that we
made in so Mister speaker
internally
I would just there's a few other
hands of and of shares of
working on the members of the
house Mr speaker I and you'll
buy more time with the
opportunity to come back from
the amendments but.
Thank you very much Madam
there's further debate the
gentle lady from Santa
Representative Powdrell Culbert.
Generated please and thank you
the lady.
This.
For Google.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from Santa
this agency.
I think the one your bill was
for
the.
What what.
We have knowledge and
considerable effort over the
years to
To.
yes.
Where there's no connectivity.
But for those areas.
Most of them have cell phones.
The New Mexico all over the
country.
For the part of federal money.
That is the latest.
For technology connected with.
All right.
The move our arms is a small
percent.
The state for whatever part of
this from but your telephone.
Or cell phone.
Of course.
So with this is our way the June
that's fine to me.
The schools that are in those
in more remote areas.
Any of those twelve months.
I am thank you Mr speaker kind
gentle lady yes we have
leveraged we need to use the
right funds.
I have come to the state of New
Mexico.
Mr speaker and kind in the lady
at the averages about
fifteen million per year.
Okay.
How
for the areas of the state of
thousands have been this first
and because I understand it.
But those dollars to come to the
state.
Is it has the.
By the individual schools.
And approval the qualified for
the low income programs like
free lunch free breakfast.
In those types of programs.
And speaker in Madam speaker in
kind gentle lady it's Mr speaker
kind of waiting sorry
the the application process
varies but it does go over the
state
and it's through PS that eight
but like I said it does go over
the state.
Madam chair from.
Mr speaker I'm sorry.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Where I'm going with this is is
what we look at productivity and
and on the legislature's along
with I have.
What the what.
Our department was set up.
And that was one of the main
goals was to make sure some of
the remote areas had the
negativity.
And so at this time we're still
nineteen years later we're still
talking about some of those
areas.
And.
I know that some of the areas
have.
A lot of the money that has come
into the state something like
seven hundred million dollars.
To address that issue.
And so I'm not sure if they can
apply for the right dollars
every year or or how that works
so.
And I.
They have applied.
Then.
I would like to know.
How work remote areas that have
received those dollars.
Because what has so far
individually when you say
fifteen million have come in for
the state.
Well fifteen million have common
to the state for house of
fifteen million.
For the state of what remote
areas of.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
gentle lady from Santa the the
the information you want is
pretty detailed it would take a
spreadsheet that I could
probably get you after the
debate but I do not have those
answers right now.
What do all of that work for our
it's important to note.
We start asking for the dollar.
Know what hours have already
been.
Because I know of those dollars
in contracts that was given out.
Not just the native American
community as a whole staff for.
That there was a movie that made
to take it.
To.
Barbara reservations.
But it may be too.
Of the reservation.
For the community.
Was fifteen twenty are you ready
for that one that was in the
reservation so I'm just trying
to understand the negative in
the process but I look at all
the dollars that have been
address the issue that you're
asking for for funding.
For this bill is a legislative.
Mr Chairman and Mr speaker and
kind gentle lady again I could
give you the information it's
pretty detailed it would be on a
spreadsheet we can get that
information to you if you if you
want.
Okay Mister speaker and gentle
lady.
It would be nice to have that
information because each year we
talk about the lack of
connectivity.
And.
You know you have all these
different parts of money.
That are out there that can be
utilized federal dollars that
dresses addition and this is a
nation that has been in the
forefront like I said ever since
I've been in the legislature and
it would be interesting to have
the information.
To see how those dollars are
connecting.
Because New Mexico this is the
state and as partially.
But look at all the dollar.
That we have committed to
address this issue seems to have
never been address.
And unfortunately for us.
It's come up now a bunch of
kids.
We're not able to.
So that they could be in schools
during this this
sentiment.
So if you can get that
information I'd appreciate
having.
Also that's the wrong.
Millions of dollars.
On the night of that has never
taken place so Mister speaker.
Similarly thank you very much.
Thank you I'm fine lady from
Santa.
Thank you very much the lady
there's further debate the
gentleman from Colfax curry
Harding play rules of semi on
you center field.
Thank you Mr speaker doesn't
gentlelady yields.
The speaker I yield the kind
gentleman for those counties.
Very remote area in out.
Out there we long ago
Begin to take advantage of some
of the technology available and
We purchased computers a school
Rosencrantz and purchased
computers and we just check them
out to the kids with school
there and they were responsible
to keep them a good care of them
and bring them back in good
shape and.
And is that is that.
Mmhm is that something that
would be available through this
program.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
we're looking in this bill
specifically it connectivity
So we're using my career my
computers or just connected.
just so the years I was curious
as if it would be.
In our case we bought laptops
and we checked them out to the
to the kids and they can take
control
use them and bring them you know
that they usually have the for a
certain amount of time that
computer and they would bring it
back to our.
Well the person would go to the
computer make sure clean it all
up make sure was in good working
order and we would check it out
to another child with that we I
just wanted to would that be
available and also would that be
a possibility with this.
Speaker kind and then yes that
would be a possibility and I do
that to other schools in
Albuquerque we gave at ours I
came to my freshman yes that is
the that would solve the problem
of the anti donation clause
because the computer would bore
me along to the child provide me
with blows to the school
although it was being used by
the child.
Correct Mr speaker and item is
just like a mouth full we just
let him are we get the full set
of our yes you Mr speaker
currently.
The that seemed to work pretty
well for us
Secondly.
Of committee of the if
Thank you know if you have one
house way out somewhere may be
different but if you brought
connectivity into a library or a
public building that was easily
accessible by.
By these folks and the you.
In wifi in that area is that
something like what would happen
in this area for the the one I
would reach.
All over a commonly used
building or for maybe even the
LA Crosse Senator holes for
rural necessarily have to hard
hardwire all the homes you can.
have wifi that extended through
them he is is that something
that this project what did.
Thank you for your kind and then
yes that would be allowed in the
libraries to all of our
neighbors already have it
through the REC program they
have their connectivity.
So how how would this to the
hands that.
I'm sorry could you repeat that
Mr different.
so the libraries have a
connectivity.
We what this funding to do
something a little better than
that
with the broadcast that can
connect to the wifi out for four
years
the fear we would obtain and in
different areas
so.
question I'm sorry I I know
somebody else this this and I'm
asking you again just Mr speaker
currently wondering if.
This would enhance that.
Mr speaker and gentleman you can
is the intended to be as
flexible as possible so this
bill gives wifi hotspots are
prepaid subscriptions for
service plans for the kids to do
that for remote learning a
that that answer your question
and gentleman Mr speaker.
Yes ma'am I think so I'm just
trying to get a good picture
what's available to you know
it's hard for kids to learn when
they can't get of up to the
school right.
In the.
The the broadband itself I know
that.
I say I live in a remote area
it's available through
satellites currently.
And it's
You know in our area would
we have to we have it available.
In other in other ways to a
couple other ways so with with
the primarily here look at
bringing in broadband primarily
be.
through cable laying of cable or
or would it just falls from the
satellite in areas that the that
the does not have broadband
available are we looking at what
we're looking at.
Over to keep and contentment Mr
speaker and gentleman are
looking at is giving those who
do not have connectivity wifi
hotspots are prepaid subs
subscriptions are service plans
or or satellite but but that's
that's that's all we're doing
we're not laying cables as part
of the big broadband bill so I
mean what they need
with these.
Well with these hot spots are
prepaid subscriptions.
So with the help Hey there.
three there's subscription to.
Forming the.
Mr speaker the lady.
Is is there a picture of it
there wouldn't be Mr speaker
gentle lady a subscription for
individual it would just.
paid for the hot spot show
subscription for Schricker.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
correct.
In the last.

of with the representative
yield.
From from Chavis can.
Thank you in my to understand
that if you display on an
internet.
Advertisement that would not
make you a dealer but if you
sold more than four cars in a
year in New Mexico that would
make you a dealer is that
correct.
Gentleman from Chavis you are
correct in solution so.
Because
of subject to become.
And do we have any idea of the
number of internet automobiles
sales sites that are currently
dealers in New Mexico Sir.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis we don't have that.
Madam chair and in New Mexico
dealers advertise on the
internet.
I I state thank you very much
for that Sir that all I think of
at just one last question
relative to internet
automobile sales I'm thinking
Sir more about of not so much
New Mexico dealers advertising
on the internet is so I am
thinking about of at home at
night and you go to Amazon you
go to cars and you buy a car
it is that transaction qualified
to be in New Mexico Cardi there
Sir.
Transaction occurs in.
Mexico then yes and for the
current other states no.
Thank you very much for that Mr
speaker that concludes my
question.
Very much German.
Further debate on the amendment.
In their opposition to adopt the
house floor amendment number one
to house bill sixty is amended.
Soon junction house for one to
house bill sixty as amended is

Now back to debate on the
amended bill first the gentleman
from Travis sitting and although
Representative Townsend.
Thank you.
Mr speaker I'm calling from
Chavis.
Thank you for grant this is.
A community and
I've had.
Handful of phone calls about
something that I think might
want to consider.
I thank you I understand exactly
where you're coming from a
speaker phone as five trips
down.
But
for example I have a gentleman
in.
My district who is retired.
And thinkers all the time
on old cars fixes them up tries
cellum.
And and us.
And he was adamant that
but he did not
With the with with the major
cried a lot.
If you so.
Six cars were over.
Twenty years older fifteen years
old would that be something that
you would consider on this bill
and with that that I think that
would be family.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis the proud moments that is
current law.
Although it's been mentioned
here changing current law and I
understand that completely I'm
just asking.
Could would and I'm not saying
here today we can determine the
Senate if if if you were
amenable to but if you made a
change in that bill that
allowed.
An individual in the cell.
A certain number of cars over
certain age so they weren't
competing with car lots would
that be something that you would
think would be
family.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis motions legislation that
is supported by the other ones
of social emotional news car
dealers of Mexico I will take
your suggestion to them but
right now we can't say if they
would support it or not I just
got appreciate Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Very much German there's further
debate the gentleman from Chavis
and Lincoln Representative
Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield.
Mr speaker I am
calling from Travis county.
Mr speaker and gentleman I was
pleased to read by all your a
member of of the rest of the
staff through because I was
concerned initially that would
prohibit sales of fairgrounds or
other places but I see the
existing statute covers a is
that an actor reading of this
legislation.
Mr speaker can I just and
gentleman from Chavis chance
marker phone having trouble
understanding.
In a room for them and can use
the microphone.
Thank you Mr.
When I read the.
Of.
Language.
Representative Russ a bill I
think I'm satisfied but I just
wanted to confirm that.
The bachelor and.
Wanted to have sales of the
fairgrounds in certain times an
hour or sometimes at a
location that.
This amendment does not prohibit
them from securing the permits
and so the fact that and turn
and location that I really the
bill correctly for the current
session correctly.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis question does not limit
them we'll have those offsite
singles that is conducted by
them thank you.
Second question is is kind of
similar to the first of and I
watch.
One of the several cars then
sold and I believe insurers on
another locations were usually
hi and
oftentimes restored vehicles a
bring substantial prices and and
I wanted to just make sure that
there's nothing in this bill.
And the.
to.
The New Mexico from having a
similar type of action that
would bring it Madam only a lot
of that of of people transaction
volume potential a lot of the
economic of.
And then trys to our state.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis I don't think this was
restrict them and having of
sales of.
Michelle that quantity of New
Mexico and so we're going to
have to be the only substantial
or or.
Licensed under.
no action has I suppose would
not normally have an there was
lessons with the.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis spreading.
But they would be able to use of
partner up with a bachelor's
financially as well as.
MMR final question Mr speaker
and gentleman is.
I'm here with a lot of
experience and.
You know more more recent
the sentence Brian with of more
than five vehicles.
There is this
Bill.
But the personal representative
of the state from.
Trying to sell the vehicles of
the Santa train convert the the
those assets to cash to make the
distributions of the descent of
man one.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis I thought of that in the
past.
On the current state laws since
you canceled more than four.
I think that Department movie
called stand stand
the rules to allow that type of
committees
one time exception if you will.
Mr speaker and gentleman I want
to consider a twenty minutes
thank section for
personal representatives dealing
with the sentence of states as
an exception to that requirement
because obviously they're not
curbstone in or whatever the
term is they're just trying to
perform their statutory duties
to wrap up the decisions affairs
so I just point that out
remember may not want to add
something as it continues on
thank you Mr speaker I have done
in the thank you very much
gentleman there's further debate
the gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder.
By auction cars at auction over
in Texas and
Okay usually helps friends in
the neighborhood solver vehicles
and things of that nature.
He does it from another dealer
Carla I think she does it
The different locations it may
have occurred at my house and
you'll send somebody about or
something like that.
It is prohibited to continue
that activity in bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis and I understand the
question if you about it Texas
in broader terms sold it.
Of.
It doesn't prohibit any that.
Okay and and thank you
Mr speaker
just help people selling cars if
I haven't picked up the phone to
cell in that column say Joe I
want to send a card if you find
some of the no he brings some
metal bands performing the car's
not this title.
But he makes the the sailing was
a licensed.
this is a twenty prohibited
under your bill.
Mr speaker Sir Bill Evans
prohibit.
This call for taking it to a
dealer and allowing him to sell
it.
Okay so thank you Mr speaker but
it doesn't have to be dealing
with law it
can sell it he lives up to my
house of my neighbor's house of
something I I just want some
clarification.
Mr speaker and gentleman of.
And what you have on your
private property so if you
infanticide disappointment call
on your personal property drive
way we can't limit that but
section.
Of this legislation on page two.
The lights what is currently of
preventing an individual from
the school.
This call are not as per car for
sale.
Thank you Mr speaker and
and gentleman I second question
is at that one point time.
Senator self storage units and
and from time to time.
Some of Mister miracle
disappear we would wind up
having to sell that vehicle
would have to get a.
The public safety and find out
who is.
And all that
It was easy to have three point
five mins per year.
if you.
Hello just read for someone so
I'm wondering.
How does you affect the self
storage in rural district on.
some of the storage facilities
are strewn proper trailers and
vehicles and different things
that nature does your bill will
impact the sector which were
storage industry.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis again the current balance
if you sell more than four
million portion of the building
Russian standard of those
financials that will.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman appreciate you happen
kind of understand where I have
this works for sure.
Thank you very much the
gentleman there is further
debate the gentle lady from
Travis Representative Ezzell.
Misters.
can the bad echo Mary's floor
might.
We're trying to get it offers
for you gentlelady.
Mr Mr speaker speaker thank you
I do I still still have the echo
echo.
Then maybe.
Mr speaker thank you very much
and thank you for fixing that
echo will the gentleman from
Bernalillo yield Mister speaker.
One of my colleagues in Chaves
County.
Mr speaker thank you very much
one of the.
Previous questions that was as
to you Mr speaker and gentleman
from Bernalillo prompted me to
just this question.
Is this going to prevent
anybody.
From advertising in newspapers
about selling their vehicles.
from Chavis will.
Okay that that's good to know
but Mr speaker my next question
is because I have been down this
road here and it proved to be
somewhat of a problem.
Of the as most of you all know
a.
And then M. involved in farming
and ranching and after.
My parents had passed away we
were trying to get rid of some
of.
Miscellaneous stuff around
there.
And we had to go down to the
department of motor vehicles to
get fourteen different vehicles
re registered.
Because we were going to sell
them in a far more options.
And so that important option was
not on our property.
And if we did the title
transfers.
and we did take the majority of
these vehicles over there if
this bill passed with that have
been a violation of what you're
trying to do here.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Chavis I actually don't know how
to answer that.
At the auction I would
anticipate that they are aware
of the state of some informed
and consenting their so I.
I don't know how to answer that
specific question Mr speaker
that gives me great concern then
because these important auctions
they they're always.
Old pickups that were used for
your geisha purposes or checking
cattle out in the field or
whatever the case may be.
But at these auction there are
several.
Vehicle sold at one time and
there they hope most auctioneers
that's what they do for a living
is auction things off and it
does include farm vehicles so
I'm just.
Very concerned I do not want to
do is to limit their ability to
be able to dispose of a person's
property or a confinement type
option for farms and ranches or
or even in the state and.
Our Agpiece.
I understand what you're trying
to do here in to its fullest
because yes there are it's cute
unscrupulous dealers out there
that do bring in vehicles that
have been through a flood or a
bed bed brick in they've re
furbished outside of a but that
frame is still be in or whatever
the case may be I do get that
but my concern there is.
It has to do with the auction
sites and.
I will probably go ahead and
supportive it will I know I'm
gonna support you build just to
stop.
A person from being taken by
somebody that does want to make
a quick the.
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo thank you very much
that's all I have.
Generally there's further debate
the gentleman from coal I think
query results and we go and you
Representative feel.
Thank you speaker does deal when
you.
Calling from Colfax.
Which reeker gentleman I think
the lady the gentle lady from
Chavis just made my question.
But I probably feel a little
differently than our about it
because it does apply to me and
it does apply to point for no in
my life and and for that reason
I'm sorry the phone will not be
able to search for your bill
thank.
Thank you Mr speaker I yield my
time.

Yes unless the allegations were

The bill expands required
training for the detection and
reporting of each child abuse
neglect for ethical misconduct
to the training to be to all
employees including non licensed
employees school and here's
contractors a contractor
employees.
The requires PED to keep a list
of persons reported to them for
ethical misconduct over felonies
or misdemeanors involving moral
turpitude analysts must be
updated monthly the bill
requires multi agency
collaboration between PED CYFD
and local law enforcement.
Mr speaker the vast majority of
educators educators take
seriously the responsibility
placed on there so shoulders but
for those the plan and practice
ethical misconduct and maybe
students down a road of abuse to
include sexual abuse they have
broken a sacred trust we must do
everything we can to make sure
they never set foot in another
school.
This is the school the ability
to weed out bad apples before
they are offered employment.
Mr speaker I'd like to defer to
my co sponsors beginning with
Representative Christine
Trujillo
two for additional comments
thank you Mr speaker.
Yes thank you Mr speaker and
members of the.
The the assembled I strongly
support this bill simply
because.
Veteran educator and as a former
board member.
Of the.
I'm sorry excuse me for just a
minute.
As a former elected board board
member of the state board of
education we dealt with many
many cases.
Of the so called yes the trash
in which
The board had to deal with
revocation of licenses because
Certainly educators behaved
inappropriately and students and
I believe that
This has continued over the
course of time and it's about
time Mr chairman and members
that the we actually implement
something solid and for school
to ensure the safety of our
kids.
In other.
In the classroom.
Can you down this road where we
pretend that is happening but
actually there's some very
dangerous people in some of our
classrooms thank you.
Very much general Uh in the Mr
speaker I have one more.
The lady thank you Mr speaker
I'd like to have enjoyed
Representative Joe garret's
become also make some comments
generated from Bernalillo.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
This is really important to me
because I saw it actually
happened we had a district
leader was hired and did not
going be all.
Very serious agreed yes action
that should have prevented him
from ever being considered also
in my own career we reported
somebody and rather than
directing him to the proper
authorities the principal again
that for I a recommendation so
often we don't want to be the
title Taos we don't want to be
the bad guy said we we don't
report these things this makes
it mandatory.
Lujan called dimension of this
legislation for New Mexico is
that it takes into account that
many small districts would find
it difficult for the
superintendent to designate a
representative to act on their
behalf in investigations of
ethical and sexual misconduct
designated representative in
this legislation.
Lewd a regional educational
cooperative I think it's very
important that small districts
have these kind of resources to
rely on to carry out the
legislation thank you Mr speaker
and I yield back to the gentle
lady.
Thank you very much Sanchez we
have a debate on the bill the
first will be the gentle lady
from Dona Ana Representative
Kevin a.
Mr speaker and gentle lady from
Bernalillo thank you gentlelady
doing you yield.
Yes I Mr speaker yes I yield to
the kind lady from done in.
Mr speaker gentle lady I rise in
strong support today of this
important piece of legislation
as they so often name
my purpose in this world
revolves around raising to happy
healthy children and when I send
them to school I have an
expectation as all New Mexicans
should they will be safe and
taking care of Mr speaker gentle
lady I want to name in honor all
the incredible educators that
show up in our children's lives
every day and know that for too
long we put the burden on them
to figure out how to get rid of
their colleagues who have acted
inappropriately and harmed our
kids Mr speaker gentle lady I
appreciate this legislation
because it helps clarify what it
means for our good actors to
show up and be protected in
their workplaces when they raise
concerns as needed.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm
feeling incredibly emotional
today just this morning as I was
speaking about.
Hometown with one of my dear
friends and and trusted
confidants I heard another story
of an educator who was released
from our school district decades
ago and has landed somewhere
else as a principal in another
school district and that sits
with me because in that moment
and they talked through a
conversation with someone I
trust.
We had to ask ourselves what do
what do we do now later this is
still happening it's been
happening and we can't let it go
anymore so Mr speaker and gentle
lady I just want to name the
courage of representative
Sarinana the gentle lady and the
other co sponsors for bringing
this important issue to like and
certainly you've inspired to me
as I've heard of this decades
old story to make sure I do my
own follow up so that someone
that was being inappropriate
with someone I love in the
nineties certainly has some
follow through now as they've
been passed around and still in
the lives of too many children
so Mister speaker gentle lady I
urge my colleagues to again take
the vote that New Mexicans
deserve thank you.
Senator and further debate the
gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you gentle lady would
gentlelady from Bernalillo this
year.
Mr yes Mr speaker thank you kind
gentleman from.
I yield I.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady on page three of
your bill.
Under item two sections C..
Let's talk about this at the
bottom of that paragraph I'm
sorry is under section item
being gentle lady.
The talks about if you're
There are charges against you
that are pending are under
investigation.
And that caught my attention
gentle lady in in your opening
mark of.
Opening comments.
You mentioned the if you have
ever been charged or accused of
abuse toward accused.
So delighted I wonder.
If you have been accused and
found innocent.
Are you still the do you still
care this record with you.
Could you walk me through the
process just a little bit of a
little bit generally.
thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman so.
In in in that particular cards
so they have to do a written
statement and doctor anything
that's related to child abuse or
neglect but that's last part of
that was unless the allegations
are false or unsubstantiated so
as
let me does that answer question
are you a more specific of.
Mr speaker gentle lady can you
lead me to that language in your
bill that says unless you were
found innocent or charges are
dropped order just Mr speaker
and gentleman just give me a
second.
Right Mr speaker and gentleman
it is on the top of page four
wine to in the committee so.
In addition were false or
unsubstantiated.
Okay and that would be at the
last of the paragraph a is that
correct utility.
Item two item as that is
correct.
Okay so if you're accused.
And they were false or UPS
unsubstantiated.
Does that have to the Falsen
no unsubstantiated have to come
From court process for.
I I I I'm just curious
in the society that we live in
today there's a lot of people
that are are harm greatly by
accusations that are later found
out to be false but normally
there to claim falls.
Reproof process and you know
just.
Does your bill so that has to go
through the judiciary processor
anything to show that there were
false or unsubstantiated.
And again kind and then let me
get back to that one second.
All right thank you Mr speaker
and thank you kind of men for
being so patient so an
allegation could.
For.
Hold on one second an allegation
could be explained but would not
be true unless proven.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
I I read right above there were
it says that if if the.
Ethical misconduct investigation
by an employer law enforcement
agency for other state agencies.
Unless the investigation found
allegations but I don't see that
they were in that language the
talks about due process in a
court of law be aware of and and
like I say we live in a society
where so many people are accused
of so many things analyzer
destroyed.
In a very uncomfortable seeing
that go on someone's record if
in fact they're innocent and
they haven't had an opportunity
to go through due process simply
a an employer our law
enforcement agency or other
state agencies was the judge but
not due process and
All continue to listen and and
think about your bill
I have a little bit of a pause
button all continue listen thank
you Mr speaker thank you gentle
lady thank you very much
gentleman there's further debate
the gentleman from Bernalillo
civil McKinley sickle cell phone
and the lenses Representative
Garcia.
Thank you Mr chairman all.
To address all of this all of
the long range from zero three.
yes the ideals thank you.
Thank you Mr Mr speaker
Representative Crowder kind of a
question away my concerns are
and you should at the beginning
of your all of.
Testimony that if your and tools
used.
This.
Large without violating the
rules.
That would be of I believe the.
The public good nobody with the
other phone nobody is that
correct.
Mr Mr speaker could you repeat
that I'm sorry.
The the beginning of your of
your presentation you mention.
That involves a person is
accused.
Misconduct.
That would be of record impacted
my correct.
What they have to do well I'm
not sure in the questions I
would like to cancel.
I'd like to ask Representative
Matthews if you can help me
she's also comes in Sir.
You madam madam you're breaking
up online can hardly hear you.
We.
Representative reminder for me
when the state on mute and to
back to the gentleman from those
counties representative Garcia
asked the question again.
Thank you Mr chairman of the
volume eighty under under begin
every step of your presentation
you mentioned then somebody's
accused.
Of misconduct.
In in the school yard against
Stroman whatever.
That would be of record of my
correct.
Mr chairman I mean Mr chair Mr
speaker and gentleman I don't
understand what you mean as far
as on record
if they are.
Mmhm Mr speaker madam mall
Committee in other words if
somebody gets accused of
misconduct.
And this gentleman get struck
terminated for some reason and
goals for fly in another school.
That is going to fall in that
correct that again education and
then falling to the next time
for is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman right
now no it doesn't have to it
doesn't follow that depend on
the school district and what
kind of recommendation they give
but a lot is but right now thank
that isn't always true.
The this stuff that's what the
law Mr speaker and
the young lady.
You also mention.
This is a we saw investigation
done on this individual.
That become public record my
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman with
this law PED does have to keep a
list of of anyone who has been.
PED has to keep a list of
persons reported to them for
ethical misconduct of found for
felonies misdemeanors involving
moral turpitude analysts must be
updated monthly.
Mr speaker a unity what I'm
getting at is if somebody gets
accused of doing something wrong
that is going to stay with them
the that's the bottom line Mr
speaker in need of if I'm of
school teacher in your school
and there could be some and they
get terminated for some reason I
go to the next screen to apply
for a job in the check back on
your screen see what happened
why got terminated that's going
to be a public record and my
correct.
all the Mr speaker and gentleman
let me let me just for
clarification for.
Mr speaker Mr speaker and
gentleman the investigation
itself would not be a public
record.
Investigations that would not be
part of public record.
Thank you madam of a Michigan
man one eighty the reason I
brought that up is because.
thank you for having issues she
way of being I'm not a child.
Regarding found guilty or
innocent it is of record and
stays on your record dot going
is that going to happen with the
with the what you're trying to
do here if somebody gets accused
and seized from.
More reason though for that
condition.
Is that going to be of record
that he was accused of that's a
personal thing to get to.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman when we get back to
you with the specific school.
Unless.
All right Mr speaker and
gentleman so we're trying to
promote disclosure of proven
past misconduct so if there is
no past misconduct with and be
promoted but for only working
with proven we're trying to
promote disclosure proven past
misconduct that's what this bill
wants to do.
In their one and they want to be
able to talk about our state.
Mr speaker minimal all you need
I understand what you brought
into line and I'd like to build.
You people should be held
accountable for my concern is
that people get accused of a
crime they did not do and it
did the day it stays on the
record.
You know I had a fun isn't it
happen to be fifty years ago no
going to Canada madam speaker
madam the meeting and that still
came up I never went to court I
will never nothing ever happened
but it was still my records in
in my Mr speaker and million
needy my concerns are if
somebody gets accused of
something.
Propose in Rome and regional
career all over again over an
accusation those are my concerns
of this.
Thank you for them.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman if it if it hasn't
been proven that it will not be
disclosed it has to be proven.
To be disclosed.
Okay Mister speaker the men and
women in other words if somebody
gets terminated from the school
and your place in another school
and that's will come back and
says well we drove back going on
here in a week that will not be
disclosed that the raptors
Department correct.
thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman can you repeat that
one more time.
Mr speaker maybe okay say
somebody's accused of them of
wrongdoing.
He leaves school rules for the
next school and apply for
employment a week later after
he's done been terminated Rabin
was under whatever school for
the next school apply for a job
individuals the us where we were
driving for me go back to your
screen.
That be disclosed.
This will be told later told why
he left here because there was
an accusation against him that
will not come out until it is
proven innocent or guilty.
The.
Mr speaker down your phone she
moved against.
Representative I she's talking
on witness could just a minute
I'm sorry thank you.
That's all right Representative
to let it happen again okay yeah
sure.
is.
I thank you Mr chairman Mr
speaker and the kind gentleman
for being so patient so what
we're trying to do is avoid that
moving from school to school all
right so we we want to invest in
we have to investigate
and we want to this bill we want
to encourage people to report it
and it will be investigated but
we want to this bill wants to
stop the practice of you know
committing abuse some kind of
abuse of the child and then
moving to a new school and then
you get there's allegations
against it and then you slip
away move to another school and
nothing is reported or nothing
is continue so we would it would
be investigated if you if you
let the school would be
investigated and then it would
have to be reported to the other
screen so that's what's
happening now we have teachers
who are abusing kids the biggest
case was the greater case
started in nineteen ninety four
new tough moved to Santa Fe area
within the Santa Fe here in
Espanola airy went to four
different schools and views kids
of four different schools so
that's what we want to stop we
have to stop is the moving
around not being reported not
given us and given a good
recommendation just so that Lee
and and then going to another
school and doing the same thing
so it's about keeping our kids
safe.
Mr Garcia I don't know if I
answered a question for victims
are good kind and then from a.
I don't know if I injure
question but that's what the
bill is trying to do
you Mr chairman Mr speaker and
young lady.
I know it's all about the German
kids and we do not support that
one hundred percent my concern
is somebody's getting accused
wrongly accuse and it follows
them through the whole system
that's the bottom line I do or
rebellion I respect we're trying
to do and I understand what
you're trying to I'm just trying
to protect the person that is Mr
person to conform you choose Mr
speaker madam chair I mean lady.
Are
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
So many times this happens
during the spring close to the
end of the school year and then
the person moves to a new
district or school districts so
what we want to do is.
If it's reported it must be
investigated.
And if they are found.
If we.
Yes.
If they are found and it's found
in substantiated.
Then.
The school could give a
recommendation that that to
clear UP next school funds.
for them one more time sorry.
You Mr speaker and gentleman if
if if there is not patient must
review the report if it's not
reported if it's not if it's if
it's found to be false it will
not be reported or and or if
it's found to be
unsubstantiated.
Mr speaker young lady thanks for
that answer you know I will be
supporting the bill my concerns
are I hate for somebody it's
innocent to get the.
Tags and some didn't didn't
happen just received just
because he was accused of it
doesn't mean that he was
innocent and I just don't want
that follow it is some people
around the rest of their career
thank you ma'am thank you Mr
speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo
county yield.
Thank you Mr speaker yes I yield
to the gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln.
Mr speaker just to.
Start out the I believe the the
representative from McKinley
Then the state.
Guilty instead of it as a the.
That that points out the real
concern is being expressed here.
For a very fine line between.
Protecting our children.
The people who Fabiana Santos
pointed out by the
representative.
Hello little bit.
Difficult to get that line place
to directly right.
Our have supported this bill and
committees.
Are more likely to do so here on
the floor but I do want to
express my concerns that the
following may be moved a little
too for our.
I'd like to look at some
language because we focused on.
Child abuse.
But.
The builder words for the gold
misconduct.
All right I take that those
words as meaning you're wanting
this bill not only to to look at
maybe sexual misconduct of the.
Applicants.
But it's also bringing anymore.
Allegations of potential ethical
misconduct Rep Marian are really
go to the protection of
children.
In order to the person's honesty
but it doesn't go to the primary
issue that I heard you
articulated earlier in order to
get your thoughts on that issue
of.
Slides so it's not only captures
the sexual.
Of abuse or child abuse aspects
but also encompasses a more
esoteric concept of ethical
misconduct.
Mr chair or Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I believe this is
where the performing part of
this comes in we have a teacher
or or somebody who
Is around kids when they are
like I think in in committee to
talk about a coach giving a
student a rider being in a car
with the students those
blooming.
Keep those grooming aspects of
this
let me
as my expert witness that one of
the I just.
Create a carefully
To provide inappropriate.
Is inappropriate misconduct.
And
Mr.
Benjamin Mr speaker Mr speaker
and gentleman.
That's all I can tell you as far
as the definition of of ethical
misconduct people work together
to get this right and they they
were from all different entities
and
the provide an appropriate
misconduct.
Mr gentle lady you would agree
with me the ethical misconduct
would involve more of them.
What you called rooming
activities would you not.
Mr speaker item yes I agree.
And so Mister speaker and gentle
lady if if the true efforts.
Of this legislation is to
provide the very difficult wind.
Between protecting the rights
of.
A person who has not been
convicted has not had due
process.
The same time protecting our
children.
It seems to me that the.
For should be carefully.
Given to.
Crafting language that
specifically addresses.
That very issue and then to bill
go the whole address in the the
the true issue what you're
trying to prevent and it sounds
like what you're trying to
prevent is the child abuse and
possibly the the child sexual
abuse of that could occur by
having these bad actors around
children.
I miss construed what you stated
in committee and then I'll on
the house floor.
He is currently.
Speaker and gentleman I believe
you're correct in this is in the
school it is in the public
school close to it is in
reference and it references for
shipment Services students and
children I'm not sure if that
answers your question but
Mr speaker.
Gentle lady the the issue that I
see is.
I agree we need to.
We need to protect our children
and finding the outline of our
food known as as an extremely
difficult task.
When you put the words.
For ethical misconduct.
This bill.
You are capturing.
Host of.
Allegations.
I don't have anything to do with
interactions with students.
Protecting
from students from abuse for
sexual exploitation.
You're capturing a host of
things that may go to the fair
for the individual if those
allegations are true.
But the address the phone line
Warren that I think we're trying
to to to protect here and I'm
I'm I'm worried about.
at that particular language.
Because of that one and and
As a representative from curry
county pointed out.
Does that.
Two four here
Disqualifying.
People who should be considered.
Because.
Judicata but I haven't had any
due process.
For some very serious of the
allegations.
Is not the to do with relief
protecting the children and
that's what I'm grappling with
what what I agree with for a
prickle misconduct because.
It it seems to me.
That a personal misconduct.
Things as simple as.
Misappropriating some money from
the student council for from the
concession stand up the at the
band our concession stand
football games for
You know maybe.
Change integrated for for
another favor something not Rep
Phelps at the goal misconduct
but it has nothing to do with
the issue.
That I think we're trying to
address here.
That that I will I will agree
that that help it go misconduct.
Is Granger's and should prevent
the employment but this bill.
This call.
At the Asian of ethical
misconduct will procure but that
person from stealing that job.
If.
The goal misconduct is is funds
of state initiated around for
that if I read the bill
correctly
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Would you agree with me Mr
speaker and gentleman no I
respectfully disagree.
it is very carefully to provide
with no gray areas in this bill.
What was conduct is.
Mr speaker gentle lady censored
so clear with you of fell more
directly with the goal
misconduct means in this bill.
The.
Contacts version.
it's.
Thanks
six.
Representative fortune three.
The find of the misconduct.
Representative it's on page
eleven of the amendments in
context.
The look on the next page
subsection I.
Basically brings in any other
behaviors prescribed by
department rule and I'm not
familiar with the public
education department rules.
But I would suspect.
The the definition would
encompass.
Much greater.
Subjects in just the for
subjects that are listed above
that the section five
That was taken out in the that
is no longer in part in the
committee so.
Section five.
Mr speaker gentle lady and I ask
for it's more fair fits on my
computer screen.
Mr speaker and gentleman I am
working from the office of the
committee the committee set for
house bill one twenty eight.
Gentlelady are may be computers
but I I think we updated the
amendments and contacts
On our website.
And if it's not there it's not
there but if it is there.
Madam I suspect that there's a
whole host of other things that
are broader and someone to look
up gentleman if I could
Representative Nibert so the
amendment the amendment contacts
are on the web show the bill
before it's been such as the
gentleman of.
So it hasn't been updated.
Okay.
Seven.
To be clear we should be looking
at is the committee substitute
not the equipment and context
that when you'll get to the
current.
Generation of the bill.
Mr Mr speaker.
All
of the German if you want me to
I can go to the next recurring
come back to you the only two
that are.
Mr speaker and not I for the
gentle lady had something to say
I just have one last question
and in a deals with the the
definition of ethical misconduct
it's on page two of the
committees lines twenty two and
following
So the goal misconduct in
braces.
Discriminatory practices and it
goes on about photos.
Conduct certainly doesn't deal
with the issue of protecting.
Children from abuse four
certainly the sexual
Here's the we've been talking
about.
So you have the highlights food
difficulty of finding that line.
Yeah highlights the difficulty
of making sure we capture the
people who would otherwise go
through the employment process
may be squirt some very
important issues of of district
needs to though.
But it also brings up at least
some points.
That we're capturing more than
just the subject matter so we're
trying to.
Right and so
again Lagos stated our I support
the bill but I I do share the
representative from curry
counties concerns in trying to
find that line and thank you at
least some areas we more from a
little too far again because
you're dealing with people who
have not been convicted of a
crime and have not been extended
due process in that regard Mr
speaker gentle lady thank you
for answering my questions I
yield the floor there is for the
debate the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
Johnson.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman yield.
I mean the gentle lady from
Bernalillo county I'm sorry.
Mr speaker thank you Hon the
lady from really I do you okay
so thank you Mr speaker and
gentle lady I think people who
haven't worked in schools don't
really understand how this works
and I have a story that will
hopefully will help to our.
Bring it into focus a little bit
so I worked I won't name the
school district it was a school
district outside of Albuquerque.
And we had a teacher in a small
rural school was a special ed
teacher and was caught
physically harming the children
striking calling calling here
kicking all of those kinds of
things she was never charged she
was never convicted and I don't
know that that would ever be
possible actually because the
kids she worked with for
nonverbal
so we see it at the to have
witnesses to take her to court
would be next to impossible the
staff knew what was going on to
a certain extent of the
principal didn't want to know so
didn't hear and so she was just
her contract was not renewed she
went away quietly and we all
agree that I really and a few
years later I saw a story on the
local news about a teacher who
worked at a school in
Albuquerque with the kids with
severe disabilities and she was
seen with her students on Lomas
Boulevard of walking with them
and physically abusing the
children.
So she is trash I'm just as this
bill goes she is the trash that
we're talking about she was
never convicted she probably
never could be convicted
because I mean that that's a
high standard but we don't want
her with our kids we
particularly don't want her with
our kids who are who are non
verbal and our our
already marginalized so madam
Mr chair Mr speaker and gentle
lady do you have the figure
about how much the state has
paid out in claims for sexual
abuse physical abuse all the
kinds of abuse that school
employees have done to children.
Thank you
Thank you madam the twenty
twenty.
Mr speaker kind and ladies spent
eighty million since the.
Since the beginning they start
so they started tracking service
created the over the last three
years has been twenty million
dollars they paid out this the
last three years.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady that twenty million could
go a long ways in some of these
programs my I'm just going to
throw it out there my special ed
ombudsman program is two hundred
ninety five thousand dollars
that we can't find that but we
can find twenty million to pay
out for people that should not
be with children and and you
know saying that they have to be
convicted and all that we are
going to allow a lot of people
who have no business being in
our schools in our schools that
we're going to continue to pay
out millions of dollars to
families who are harmed I mean
it it's much more than the money
the child is harmed forever the
family's farm for ever so you
know this may not be the perfect
bill I haven't run across the
perfect bill but it's way past
due Mr speaker and gentle lady I
believe I hearing this similar
bills from years ago and we've
been working on it for years and
it just hasn't happened so thank
you for doing this and and if if
you don't understand how this
works talk to someone you know
who works in schools just about
everybody who's been around for
more than a couple of years has
seen this happen thank you Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
Are there is further debate the
gentleman from the
Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo yield
Mister speaker yes condemning
the yield to the gentleman from
the.
Mr speaker gentle lady just a
couple of questions.
One of our concerns are suppose
is.
Is with the with the question of
volunteers.
Could you describe for me Mr
speaker gentle lady waterfall in
June will have to go through.
To be able to serve for school.
If this bill passes.
And Hanover differs from
current.
Mr speaker kind of them and
well tears will go through the
normal FBI background check but
they also they also of we will
have to go through training for
required training on the
detection and reporting of child
the blues music lessons and
ethical misconduct that's new
because they never had to do
that before
and this includes not only
volunteers it's all non licensed
employees because it's been a
license employees we have a lot
of training we do and they will
now volunteers non licensed
varies contractors contractors
employees will all have to go
through this training to detect
for detecting reporting of abuse
and neglect of ethical
misconduct.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
What will be estimated time and
cost to record for training.
we're trying to restrict.
You Mr speaker in kind of a man
under Nipsey is going to be
doing the training or or well
there because of they're going
to pick up the cost but they're
going they're trying to restrict
it to twenty five minutes of
trading
At this point so no the
volunteer will not a human costs
will be for the benefit and
hopefully run twenty five thirty
minutes.
Remember we've never had
training in this for these
people for volunteers for non
licensed employees for
contracted we've never had
training they've never been
given this training so.
It is so much to understand what
what's involved with effortless
conduct when you when you heard
it in your and you learn had
reported for these type of
things then.
Then you at least are aware of
what's happening and and
understand what's going on in
schools this is to keep our kids
safe.
This is to train the people who
are around our kids sometimes
and supervise so that they know
what is expected of them what
was that the committee is with
child abuses
this is something we haven't
ever done before so.
Fire training in the detection
reporting child abuse and
neglect and ethical misconduct
that's what they will be going
through before they can be
you for the work in the school.
Mr speaker generated work maybe
I'll turn to the.
The problem of maintaining.
Disciplines in order.
from members teachers.
Since March.
Injury and of the legislature
that.
That is becoming in.
Increasing the horrible.
Maintaining discipline order is
becoming an increasing problem
because of the need for.
Of consequences that are
available.
To the teacher.
To provide to support.
So.
Let me offer Mr speaker and
gentle lady an example of.
In relation to the.
Who is physically removed from
the classroom.
Which results allegations of
misconduct.
Could you address.
What the consequences will be
for the future.
In the event this bill becomes
law.
Mr speaker and gentleman you're
right of.
Discipline is a skill that takes
teacher the wild and to be able
to participate in the class and
it's getting harder I've been
teaching for the last twenty
years.
But when it comes up in our
staff meeting do we stop of I do
we do this what because of what
could happen
But I do believe it the training
is there.
To help teachers deal with
discipline and it is a skill not
everyone can do it.
as far as this bill I need to
speak with my expert witness to
give you an answer all right
thank you Mr speaker thank you
can elector.
Right Mr speaker and gentleman
So there are
So if the teacher is a four when
they're trying to remove a child
from the classroom or remove a
child from a from the area then
there would be consequences.
Let's there's there's a twenty
lowering their because I know we
had a it was in the if there was
a fight right in front of my
classroom and the kids got in a
circle in and have their arms
loss but two kids were fighting
and when was getting seriously
hurt so I had to move the kids
wait.
Moving in moving away took a lot
of strange.
I didn't heard but I moved in so
I can get to the fight to stop
it so there there's a fine line
there because as a teacher you
have a duty to keep our kids
safe but as and and it's because
of what it took to to to.
To get to that point where I can
help the students who needed
help so I'm not sure
if if.
There are consequences if it is
if you said if there's abuse by
the teacher what is going
towards helping another student
or helping during the fight or
helping them I don't know that
there could be consequences for
that but if the teachers abuse
yes there will be consequences
Mr chair on that point as a co
sponsor.
Thirty two point.
Yes
you know there are a lot of
hypotheticals that are being
brought up but when you're
teaching you have to use the
best judgment you can and make a
good faith effort in trying to
ensure that you have a classroom
that is not a new ruling and
that is not hurting and that
kids are hurting each other
however.
The issue at hand isn't so much
Of kids hurting each other and
then the reaction from the
teachers right now it's the
issue in which a teacher
initiate or at least a school
leader initiates.
Her full.
Sexual possibly and other other
actions that are hurtful to the
kids into each other and I think
the folks are asking the
questions are misconstruing the
issue at hand which is a trying
to get.
Bad teachers and.
And and bad thanks
but those are the issues not the
fact that we how do you read the
react when a kid of is a newly
and you have to
Stop the fiber I mean those are
risks you take when you're
teaching and interacting with
kids but I think that some of
the questioners are are
misconstruing the whole point
thank you Mr chairman thank you
my
Cosponsored.
Representative community solar
for.
Mr speaker and gentle lady are.
I certainly do understand of
the.
A reservation he's here.
But.
Confuse your his.
Is frequently in the honor of
before holder for for example.
I'm really student
administrative level based
teacher is male or by
commercial.
It looks to me like this
legislation creates the
opportunity for an allocation.
Unsubstantiated beyond the
testimony of the people involved
in that altercation.
On.
to impugn the reputation of of
otherwise competent teacher.
Can you understand the the
hesitation lawyer and it goes
for Mr speaker and gentle lady
to that long time the gentleman
from Travis county was
describing and we're.
Do we draw the line between
protecting the.
The people that are trying to do
a good job against.
With with students thank you
that is not.
Always considers exemplary.
Where do we draw that line what
we're trying to the catcher is
the predators and has this
legislation would go on to for
Mr speaker gentle lady.
And Mr speaker
with all due respect again the
the issue of concern is.
It is a fine line but remember
that teachers are already
expected to import adults that
are caring for kids if they are.
I
feel that and and that's a huge
issue right teachers are
expected to report adults the
care givers sometimes the
parents.
If they suspect that there's
abuse we teachers are in a in an
environment in which kids don't
don't control that environment
but we have to use the best
judgment that we have so
everything is is not cut and
dried you teachers are expected
to make wise good faith choices
there isn't a black and white
issue to this you have to trust
that you're that the people in
the classroom with the kids that
are are trying to protect those
kids are making good faith
decisions and and again remember
that we're making that same
decision when it comes to
protecting kids and in
somebody's the the the kids from
abusive parents abusive
caregivers those are.
Again good faith attempts at
trying to protect kids so we can
do.
B. thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker gentle lady you can
understand that in the heat of
the moment.
And a destructive situation.
Decisions by the minute that
with twenty twenty hindsight
would look.
Perhaps not totally appropriate.
My concern remains the this
proves true for.
For the truly run and perhaps
long foreigners.
Protecting the teachers from on
substantiated allegations let me
move on to for current.
Gentle lady Mr speaker.
Of course there are a number of
homes sure teachers and service.
In my community or those folks
presume for their higher to
have.
Her plainly records you too
will.
Mr speaker kind of them and they
still have to go through
background checks to the FBI
background checks just like
everyone else.
So
as far as that goes yes.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
for your answers.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from McKinley and
San Juan Representative
Lundstrom.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
for the gentle lady yield
perfect comments.
Thank in late thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady just a couple of
comments for the last twenty
years I've been listening to
various education bills.
And some of them I've had to
take a second thought out this
to me is the most important
education bill what they were
saying go through the system.
And the reason I say that is
because.
As as as the budget chair and
I've watched millions and
millions of dollars to be paid
out.
Because of lawsuits regarding
what happens to kids in the
school districts millions of
dollars and as she was able to
get caught.
My feeling about it is when I
hear about these people being
passed along from one school
district to the other.
I did some fun fact research on
it and it seems like they all
end up in the rural school
districts is there a good place
to hide.
It's a good place to hide if you
want if you want to get just
lost some fires going to one of
these very rural school
districts when I Representative
when you're out there you know
fifty sixty miles away from any
any city.
And you're just out there with
all these kids in in in my case
law these kids live in
dormitories.
And these teachers live in
temperatures.
I see in this
the gentle lady I've seen how
they get passed around I see no
dangerous it is to kids and you
know I think it's a heck of a
lot easier for adults to be able
to demonstrate.
If they are you know up standing
in the state they are.
You know innocent as it is to
try to.
Have these you know these kids.
Stand up and tell what's been
happening to them especially
these rural school districts.
So like I say gentle lady and
members.
That's probably the most
important education bill I've
ever seen in twenty years and I
hope everybody votes for.
You.
There is further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Matthews.
Thank you Mr speaker have you
members of the house I am also a
sponsor this bill and I'm proud
to be sponsoring it.
we talk a lot about some really
important issues and I when I
was a criminal prosecutor
Attorney General's office are
prosecuted white collar sexual
predators I call them predators
because you're always multiple
victims and I talk about I call
them white collar because they
had a word it's the these were
not situations where
you it was it a crime of
violence by a stranger these
people were doctors they were
psychologist they were the kind
of people that.
once of individuals trust and
that we trust with our children
and we trust with with with our
lives.
Most of them were serial rapist.
That's I don't know what else to
call them.
we saw last night on the news
that there was another fellow
who'd been involved with
gymnastics for years and years
and years and he was now in
charged with child abuse.
Sexual misconduct with your neck
region is and he committed
suicide.
We've talked a lot about the
balance and we want to get the
balance right but I would
suggest to you that
a priest.
And a child.
It's believed the priest.
If it's a coach and a child is
believed to coach if it's a boy
scout leader and a child who is
believed.
The trough boy scout leader
if it's a doctor in child who
gets believed the teacher in a
child who's gonna be believed.
we have seen that happen time
and time and time and time again
and until it finally the dam
breaks and we realize that the
balance was always put on the
side of the adult and and never
you sensually on on the side of
the child.
Because this is an equal balance
from the beginning.
Sexual assault is a really ugly
crime and when it's done by
someone you trust it is even
worse the first case are
prosecuted about the
psychologist.
And let's talk about an ethical
problem.
The psychologist
with his female patients when
they came in for therapy he
would explain to them how fond
he was of them and how much you
really love them and he would
choose sessions to have sex with
them.
Amazingly that was not a crime.
It probably was an ethical
violation this psychology rules
but it wasn't a crime and the
first victim I met was in the
mental health unit and casement
hospital because the that abuse
of the trust that she had put
into him to help her.
It was just devastating to her.
So.
That to me we're worried about
what an ethical violation is
that was more than an ethical
violation and later I was one of
several people who work to get
passed in the legislature
Legislation that made a
psychotherapist to mental health
person like that of taking
advantage sexual advantage of
their patients eight a felony
and I later prosecuted some
cases involving that this fella
we prosecuted in for insurance
fraud because he would charge
the insurance companies for
those therapy sessions refer
really sexual exploitation
sessions.
So.
The bill becomes really
important because.
It's it's going to be a rare
situation where you've got
somebody who just inadvertently
touched a child and there was no
intent or anything else and
somehow we destroy their life we
are not talking about criminal
prosecutions we're not talking
about proof beyond a reasonable
doubt we are talking about
whether people can get a job.
And there's no constitutional
right to the job as such and I'm
the same way that you have a in
criminal prosecution would when
your freedom is at stake also
it's important that.
When we talk about the balance.
We first of all understand
always the child is at a
disadvantage compared to the
adult.
And that what we're talking
about is not the right to
freedom.
We're talking about should they
be employed as a teacher in this
particular case and I think this
is an incredibly important bill
and I think that the balance is
It's good it's good because it
recognizes how long both the
child is relative to an adult
and with that I would.
Stop.
For the debate the gentle lady
from the arena Santa Fe and pass
Representative Herrera.
Thank you Mr speaker I with the
kind mania.
Thank you yes I think I yield to
the kind lady from tells.
I think the the mmhm the most
important minds are on page
eighteen nine twenty three and
page nineteen line twenty and
the reasons that of people
weren't reporting this is
because before a loss and they
and they didn't have to use that
the issues with the
the Sanchez crossed out of this
law the reasons shall not be
publicly disclosed by the local
superintendent state agency
administrators local school
board or governing authority so
when you terminated person you
were not allowed to say why they
were terminated we we need to
know why people are terminate we
need to know why employees in
school districts are terminated
I mean if they're bad math
teacher and that dog can't we
have to know that if they have
sexually molested a child we
either know that if you go down
to the beach nineteen
line twenty for license
employees the same thing neither
the local superintendent or
state agency administrator nor
the local school board or
governing authority shall
publicly disclose its reasons
for termination that has been
deleted now we need to know that
information there is no way you
can check if no one's allowed to
say that and I think those are
probably two of the most
important paragraphs in this in
this bill and I I think the
gentle lady for bringing this
forward I'm proud to be a co
sponsor and what I would say to
everybody in this body there is
every single reason to know why
teacher has been terminated
thank you Mr speaker currency no
further debate the gentle lady

house taxation and revenue
committee substitute for House
health and Human Services
Committee substitute for house
bill twelve.
Is a work in progress Mr speaker
you all have seen this bill
before his legislature this
chamber I should say passed a
version of this bill two years
ago.
This bill has gone through
countless committees.
This bill has been
vetted through the intro three
number of working groups
including Michele governor
Michelle Lujan Grisham's
Canada's working group last
year.
This bill has gone through a
number of different iterations
it is a breeding living document
Mr speaker and members one thing
that we should know about what
we will be voting on today is
how awesome of the
responsibility rests upon us as
we begin the process of creating
and building a brand new.
Industry here in New Mexico and
an industry that is one of a
kind.
Industry that is slowly but
surely.
Coming to this country think of
it as a snowball this is normal
that you know right now we are
still at the forefront right now
we are still one of very few
states should this be passes
over the governor that legalizes
adult use of cannabis.
What eventually and before we
know it this local is gonna be
pretty big.
It is no longer a matter of when
of this Mr speaker it's a matter
of when.
It will be legalized across this
great country of ours.
Mr speaker members of the body I
would be remiss if I did not
mention that I am by no means
the only one that's involved in
this work is work predates me
there have been incredible
people who have worked on drug
policy reforms including
cannabis legalization for many
many years I'm simply the next
person in line taking the baton
running as far as I can and and
and I will soon pass on the
baton to others.
Mr speaker members of the body.
We are embarking on the creation
of a brand new multi million
dollar industry.
Mr speaker members of the body
this is a big deal and it should
be I'm proud of the hours of
debate that have been had in
committees on the house side and
on the Senate side I'm proud of
the hours of conversation and
it's the legit listening that
we've all done over the course
of the last few years through
the different task forces and
working groups.
Mr speaker for two states have
already legalized adult use
cannabis including our neighbors
to the west Arizona.
For you should also know that
most of those states have
legalized through ballot
initiatives.
What does that tell you what is
that's only a lot of those
places have to come up with the
legalization framework over the
course of three months once they
legalized the ballot initiative
that created a number of
headaches that there's still
trying to address to the state.
Mr speaker members of the body
only only two other states have
legalized through the
legislative process.
That is the state of Illinois.
In the state of Vermont.
And to be perfectly honest with
you is speaker of the body
legalize and it's like a patient
have document didn't give much
guidance.
illinois' of only one that's
actually really got into the
into the weeds no pun intended
and and really figured out how
to do the legalization framework
that works I will also add that
when it would normally pass
their legalization framework
they did so a couple of months
after we had passed our
legalization framework in the
state house and many of the
ideas that they've implemented
actually came from us so so
there is that.
Speaker members of body before I
get into some of the Pacifico
bill I I wanna I wanna make a
few more points.
I would like to express to the
body into everybody watching at
home.
Why I'm so interested and you
know emotionally and and
spiritually and otherwise
invested in his work.
Speaking as a body I grew up as
you know
in Albuquerque and selfie sites.
Where I saw the impacts of the
war on drugs on my neighbor's
family.
A little children at the school
that I went to the missile
interim on their parents
I saw what the war on drugs and
what prohibition really did to
that community.
But I also rural part of the
time south of the border I grew
up into that's what is where you
find one of the largest
international border cross
points in the entire world.
As a result Mr speaker and
gentleman as a body where you
have the wealthiest country on
the face of this earth are
probably in the history of these
of of of of of the world.
I'm here a few miles from a
developing country.
And you have this drug.
And weapons and violence being
trafficked and money being
trafficked not only for north
from south to north but also
from north to south.
Mr speaker and members of body
you know.
Our friends our family our
neighbors in that neck of the
woods also saw.
How terrible is worn drugs is
and has been for those
communities I've seen both sides
of the coin Mr speaker and
generating.
And.
As I dove into his work years
ago.
I realized that to me.
Realizing we control cannabis is
not about the money it's great
but it's a great revenue source
for the state that's not why I'm
doing it.
The rising recruit adult use of
cannabis.
Is probably going to be good for
tourism.
Legalizing is probably going to
be good in terms of creating
jobs in a new home grown
industry.
Really when you get to the core
of why I'm doing this and what
I've worked on this for solar.
It's because I have seen.
The faces of the people who have
most been impacted.
My name is.
Thank.
All in on winnable war on drugs.
It is a war that we cannot win.
It is a war that we can drop as
much money as we want to and we
will not win.
But we speaker members of the
body we have as close to a
silver bullet as you can have in
that war.
Recreational cannabis.
Russian state cannabis is one of
the largest cash crops of these
drug cartels.
Representative.
The daily United States of
America legalizes adult use
cannabis.
I believe.
I believe that the drug cartels
as we know them.
Probably cease to exist will
reimagine themselves into some
other form of criminal
enterprise some short.
When we know them now he will no
longer be.
Mr speaker members of the body.
In front of you there is a bill
to legalize adult use cannabis
in New Mexico.
And there are three foundational
principles to this bill.
The first foundational principle
Mr speaker members of the body
is to protect and enhance our
medical cannabis program.
We know for a fact and we'll
hear more today in testimony at
the medical cannabis program has
been a godsend for many people.
it's been a godsend to people
who suffer from chronic illness
and chronic pain.
Cancer patients for whom maybe
there's no other source of pain
management.
But also for those who suffer
from.
Mental health problems veterans
coming back from war and dealing
with PTSD.
Coming back from life
threatening injuries and have no
other way to manage their pain.
The medical program to me Mr
speaker Representative body and
to us as Sanchez Bill is
critically important and we will
work our hardest to ensure that
these new legalization framework
keeps them first and foremost.
Mr speaker members of the body
the second foundational
principle in this bill is to
ensure that whatever
legalization framework takes
place in New Mexico.
Addresses.
Generations of inequity.
By promoting diversity and
equity in this industry.
There's nothing more on just Mr
speaker members of the body.
Into the headlines for the sake
of legalizing.
And have an entire new
industries that for fifty years
we have frowned upon for laws in
our policies for fifty years we
course rated people and twirled
their lives in unimaginable ways
there's nothing more fair the
legalizing now to the benefits
of some interim measurement of
others Arbil Mr speaker members
of the body believe I believe
accomplishes a great deal.
Of that particular go.
Last but certainly not least Mr
speaker.
Let's talk a little bit about
the numbers.
This is a brand new industry.
We want to make sure that in
whatever ways we regulated we
tax it we do it in a smart way
as possible.
I don't want to create an
industry that cannot get all the
games that cannot get up on its
feet one industry that can grow
and thrive one local economies
to enjoy.
In two budget for one jobs to be
created we want entrepreneurs to
take root in our communities.
Participate in an industry that
by most accounts will be more
multimillion dollar industry in
New Mexico.
The speaker I believe that our
bill achieves that smart
taxation regulatory framework I
believe that we have hit the so
called sweet spot of taxation
for taxing enough to be able to
not only pay for the program to
be able to generate resources
for critical needs across the
state.
We're not taxes so high.
That we don't make a dent in
addressing.
Issues and the problems that we
have with the listed marketing
cannabis.
Mr speaker I will resume with my
remarks I promise of got a
couple more things to say and
then the president to Michael
sponsor for her remarks.
Mr speaker members of the body
why should we legalize why now
why today.
The speaker we have an
opportunity to reduce heart.
We know is as well as I said
earlier the criminalization of
cannabis.
Unfortunately has harm young
people and people of color and
has sponsored violence and
corruption in governments here
and run.
And by the way.
Use taxes has not increased
under the listed market.
This is the body through this
bill we can create jobs.
We believe that more than eleven
thousand jobs could be created
by these new industry in its
infancy.
Mr speaker members of body we
can in the tragic and long term
consequences.
Of cannabis possession
convictions on members of our
community members of our
families.
Mr speaker the front of you
insures that one hundred percent
of the revenues from his new
industry going to the general
fund so that the appropriating
committees for the on the house
and the Senate in their own
wisdom can invest those dollars
rather most needed however our
bill does create to funds one of
them is a medical cannabis
patients subsidy fund for low
income for medical patients of
of cannabis.
And we also create the community
reinvestment fund that is a fund
designated to invest some of
those dollars in communities
most impacted by the war on
drugs.
Speaker members of body I will
conclude my introductory
comments at this point I'd like
to yield to a poll sponsor for
some comments and Mr speaker if
you come back after that I would
appreciate it before we go to
debate.
All right to.
Okay.
Fund the gentle lady from.
Santa Fe Representative.
Romero.
Thank you Mr speaker it and
thank you gentleman does the
gentleman yield.
I think you just said that but I
want to make sure.
I think.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
body I am so proud to be a co
sponsor of this legislation
and understanding everything
that Representative Martínez has
presented to you because of the
social justice components that
we have throughout this bill
because of how we basically in
lay on the funding that will go
to any possible a problem or
situation that we have a more so
Mr speaker body regarding the
opportunity for for re inventing
our state from something that
has been tragically targeting
many of our communities of color
and I just wanted to share with
the body some stories but I am
collected living and I'm very
Moul side generational family
spoken to my grandmother's and
them knowing that I would be
sponsoring the.
Thanks
The.
State students speaking to you
today I spoke with my
grandmother who grew up in house
and I said.
Have do you know anything about
this legalization and and she
said oh well this is not
anything new to us we had it
throughout our community it's
been Medicine forever except for
the fact that we couldn't
access.
Thank.
In the war yup thank.
My aunties did my PS they did it
but they had to do it in secret
and until it became exposed to
that my grandfather this is my
grandmother
born in nineteen thirty four
speaking now she said my
grandfather was ill.
And he could not walk here the
phone very very L. we believe
that he had cancer throughout
his body and certainly
throughout his legs where he
couldn't walk but of course the
That is the full folks
throughout house where she lived
in front of us there was a very
rich culture of using herbs and
remedies Remedios to be able to
heal except she remembers it was
very thoughtful.
Very ritualistic and between the
six and a week he was walking
again.
And she remembers that at some
point maybe the neighbors got a
hold of the knowledge that they
had this for committee that will
force stigmatized outlawed and
something that they could not
access it's.
And so unfortunately Mr speaker
members of the body this is the
feature that is been in put it
in something that has been
medicine for so many for so
long.
And in the distribution of New
Mexico.
it's.
Speaker members of the body we
have a knowledge that however
we've wrestled with it and the
history of the way we
stigmatized this drug in
particular first to have the
name cannabis pre nineteen
hundreds and then as we were
integrating our societies within
the United States we started
stigmatizing it calling it might
wanna being that it was Mexican
of the.
This very very Mexican and
sentiment in which case New
Mexico carries that sentiment
New Mexico has been part of that
Keyes and cracking down on the
use of this medicine starting in
nineteen twenty and for
seventeen years to be the
marihuana tax act of nineteen
thirty seven started looking at
our own communities and
reflecting upon ourselves with
that criminality it drew fear it
to havoc in many communities
that New this cannabis
responsibly but because of the
problems that we're just.
So seated with the use of
cannabis
Mr speaker well I don't know my
video is going to work.
It says the hose to cut me off
that's final keeping go and.
The of the body is about that
access to justice in the
connection.
We.
I have within our communities.
You hear me okay Mister speaker
so one of the reasons that we
can hear your audio better but
you're still cutting out quite a
bit so we're working on it I
apologies my apologies everyone
So essentially we're New Mexico
has always been at the forefront
of ensuring that the way we
engine the way we reconcile that
criminalization and understand
the medicinal properties of this
plants Mr speaker members of the
body is that in New Mexico in
nineteen seventy be a we're the
first.
State in the entire country to
explore the use of medicinal use
of cannabis we've always been at
the forefront of progress in
reconciling our our own unique
make up of demographics around
our state and being able to
ensure that we create equity and
justice in the process of how we
protect our citizens Mr speaker
mentor members of the body.
We see this opportunity now when
we talk about what will probably
here today in reefer madness and
the gateway drug theories that
we all hear that even when we've
commissions many many many
different studies starting at
the earliest stages of one we
really wanted to make this drug
a bad thing among communities of
color that every single study
that came up starting since
nineteen thirty seven was
talking about the medicinal
opportunities within this plan.
And how folks experienced and
that it was safe and that folks
knew what they were doing and
they could figure it out of
course fast forward to twenty
twenty one we're in a different
state and right now with an
unregulated product that's on
the street we don't know what
it's laced with it was regulated
taxed and put into stores in our
state Mr speaker and members of
the body we would know what was
in it we could control that
substance we could be able to
ensure that children would not
get their hands on it.
What it has been unfortunately
being that it's so stigmatized
Mr speaker members of the body
is that this gateway drug has
not been a gateway to eviction
to deportation to arrests to
criminalization of addiction and
more what's unfortunately become
the gateway within this drug is
is how we end up criminalizing
our communities of color
thankfully two years ago we
decriminalized it but we still
have work to do Mr speaker and
members of the body this is
about justice equity and
continuing that work we started.
And the war on drugs was never
about the drug.
It was never about making sure
that people are safe that making
sure people were in control of
themselves it was never about
the drug itself and it never has
been Mr speaker John is a way to
unfortunately create criminality
and stigmatize people of this
state and people across the
United States in particularly
people of color what we've seen
as its connection to the arts
within jazz within B. culture
within the hippie movement and
has so many other components
where Shakespeare himself we're
finding use the substance Mr
speaker gentleman and so when it
comes to that access to justice
we need to do X. the stigmatize
it across all cultures and we
need to do it in our state.
And with that comes an amazing
job opportunities for many many
many people eleven thousand
possible jobs in the first year
alone and even in our neck of
the woods up in Espanola the
northern New Mexico college's
created account of this
establishment technician course
which helps folks get into the
medicinal cannabis industry
certified to be able to practice
their to make sure that people
can get their medicine and that
they can contribute to the
future of New Mexico it's an
entry level can't met medical
cannabis program and it's been
very very successful and very
highly interested from folks
around the northern part of our
state.
One of the parts of this bill
that so important to me and why
it's so strong is the public
health advisory board.
When you're talking about all of
the different components of what
we seek to achieve through this
bill Mr speaker.
And members of the body is that
we have built in our safety nets
throughout the bill.
And when we talk about what we
want to reconcile with as we as
we experiment through this in
our democracy we want to make
sure that we have dot every I
cross every T. when it comes to
the safety of our people.
And so with that you Mr speaker
and members of the body of four
to a robust conversation I hope
you keep an open mind that's the
name of the game it's Friday you
know we've got a lot of work to
do so let's go with that Mr
speaker thank you members.
Thank you Mr speaker before we
open it up for debate Mr speaker
I do have a floor amendment to
present to the body and and you
all should have it already down
there.
and I can read the amendment
number to make sure that you do
have the right one Mr speaker
that number is point two two
zero.
Two to three point two.
The second.
This is the second all right
it's on the web and it has been
passed down gentleman to explain
the amendment.
Mr speaker and members of the
body in house tax and Rev in
that particular substitute that
are committee passed out when
the bill was re written by
council service the internet Lee
left office section
that would be section sixty
three of the bill and now this
ammendment points that section
back was because of the body the
the section that was University
defeated is a gross receipts tax
deduction on medical cannabis
products this was in the
original bill it's been every
single bill we've seen
On the amendment.
Jackson to adopting the
amendment.
Mr speaker.
Yes Anderson.
The gentleman from Chavis Lee
emotional Representative
Anderson yes Sir.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
our sponsor yield
Representative I I yield to the
gentleman.
Yes on the amendment
do we have a a number of a
fiscal do we know what that the
of net effect I understand that
we're adding something that
might have been inadvertently
deleted you may get very clear
Sir but Mr speaker I'll hi I was
wondering what is the financial
impact of the amendment.
Mr speaker and gentleman
according to the FIR of the bill
which this in it he was eight to
nine million dollars.
And thank you for that Mr
speaker that eighty nine million
dollars
that would be let's see if we
adopt the amendment we are
reducing our gross receipts
taxes to the state of New Mexico
by eight or nine million is that
correct Mr speaker up and and
gentleman that is correct keep
in mind that this provision
would not go into effect until
sales of recreational cannabis
begin so by that time they'll be
a lot more gross receipts tax
available.
Thank you Sir my mic computer
equipment fire dept new cut off
but I know what your point was
within Mr speaker
hi I think my point is simply
this
I am concerned that.
We are missing an opportunity.
on taxes and I'm going to speak
to this later in this debate
with with another and and and I
just want to point out in my
mind that one we're adopting an
amendment that will.
Reduce gross receipts taxes the
state of New Mexico by eight or
nine million that was my point
at at this point on your
amendment thank you very much.
Is ready for the debate on the
amendment.
Is there any objection to
adopting the amendment.
I see none the amendment is
adopted.
Gentleman we were back on the
bill there is debate the gentle
lady from Bernalillo
Representative Thomson.
You Mr speaker the gentleman
yield.
I will let me yield to the
gentle lady from Bernalillo.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman so how many states
have have legalized cannabis.
Mr speaker and gentle lady there
are fourteen states that have
legalized adult use of cannabis
otherwise known as recreational
cannabis.
Thank you Mr Mr speaker and
gentleman how many of them have
done it legislatively Mr Mr
speaker and and gentle lady from
Bernalillo only two and those
would be the state of Vermont
and the state of Illinois and I
should note as I noted earlier
Vermont's legalization framework
is literally like two or three
pages it doesn't really give a
lot of detail or direction also
they've got a more than they've
had their struggles in
implementation Illinois is the
closest thing to order
attempting to do it's very
detailed and it provides a great
deal of of guidance.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
What what is pulling up New
Mexicans look like in terms of
legalization.
Mr speaker and and only you know
I've as you know I've been
involved in these issues as I
got elected and public opinion
has just can continue to shift
in a very positive direction
every single year the most
recent poll all that I've seen
Mr speaker and gentle lady
showed overall seventy four
percent support for legalization
and regulating cannabis
opposition is is only twenty
five percent it's it's a pretty
big shift if you go back to up
to a poll back in oh seven only
for only thirty four percent of
New Mexicans at that time
supported legalization fifty one
percent opposed it so we've seen
a complete shift in the last
twelve years or so.
Mr speaker and gentleman that to
me it looks like a forty percent
forty percent swing in the
course of fourteen years with
yeah that doesn't happen very
often and I'm glad Mr speaker
and gentleman that that the
gentle lady from Santa Fe talked
about the racism and I just I
just did a quick Google and the
law enforcement view of
marijuana was indelibly shaped
by the fact that it was
initially connected to brown
people from Mexico and then
subsequently with black and poor
communities in this country
police in Texas border towns
demonized the plant in racial
terms as the drug of immoral
populations who were promptly
labeled
marijuana fuel.
and this is that legal scholars
Richard Bonnie and Charles white
I had to check twice because I
couldn't believe someone's name
was actually white bread but it
was his name
But the jobs popularity among
minorities and other groups that
were out of favour shall we say.
Practically ensured that it
would be classified as a
narcotic in a tribute with
addictive properties that we
heard of you know the gateway
drug and all that stuff that it
did not have.
And so I mean this is this.
I essentially have that have
that roots in racism is that
true.
Mr speaker and gentle lady you
make some really really
important points.
There's a will come
that I recommend everybody read
if you have the opportunity
called chasing the scream.
Getting out just a few years ago
and it was written by a British
journalist who can have some
sort of accident and had been on
opioids to manage his pain
and of course we know the rest
of the story he got hooked on
the on the on the pills and and
then eventually resorted to
using heroin and and was in a
very very bad spot in a very bad
place he reemerged and it was
really just troubled by what he
had gone through so we started
researching with different
countries are doing it and he
ended up in Portugal Portugal
Mr speaker and and gentle lady
over the last few years has
really diverted a lot of other
resources a lot of their public
monies.
From enforcing all these drug
laws to treating people into
treating drug use disorders as
public health issues and not is
crime.
and so.
As a result of his research he
actually goes into the history
of prohibition.
And the war on drugs
and he ends up really just
narrating a fascinating story
it always reads like a like a
fantasy novel like one of these
crime novels like a John Grisham
novel is so well written in the
story itself is so outrageous.
of how we came of how the water
drugs came to be and everything
you said is is true no there
articles written about cannabis
where they called it the the
quote unquote Mexican drug hence
the name is as Michael Sanchez
stated so eloquently earlier
money one that ready to Spanish
word it scared a lot of people
back in the thirties and forties
you know it's it's
the war on drugs in the policies
that were sought after by the
federal government and by state
governments consequently
are really rooted in that space
right and and you talk to people
you know I I I I have friends or
lawful enforcement and we we we
shared stories and I I tell them
this this history and therefore
no write most of us don't know.
It's a very very obscure part of
history yet the continues to
drive so much of what we do case
in point Mr speaker and gentle
lady student loans.
When I graduated high school you
know we went to highland high
school also want to have a lot
of money we got a couple
questions here and there but we
have to get schools we have to
get federal financial aid.
There is a question and I
believe it's still on the fast
if you are paying convicted of
you know but drug related
offense right.
and in many cases of you know
people who are otherwise
incredible people but who maybe
one or two mistakes in life in
the past because of those
draconian.
Drug laws in the books at the
federal level they are
completely based out of any
opportunity for higher education
so I appreciate your points very
very true very sobering and
sadly a part of history.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman in district go on a
little further by the early
nineteen thirties more than
thirty states have prohibited
the use of marijuana
and the stage for federal
suppression with that in New
Orleans were prominent doctor
blamed he called that mobile
payments and I just wonder if JK
Rowling got for Michael's for
hearing potter from from that
but that's when he called
cannabis users and he blamed
them for an outbreak of robbery
for robberies the city was just
launched in sensationalistic
newspaper articles that depicted
pushers hovering around the
schools turning children into
adding.
And not Mr speaker and gentleman
I I believe that I mean and
there's also that thing that
affects insects training killers
that that mob hit man did did
marijuana before they did their
crimes to give to build them up
and there's just so many.
So and Mr speaker and gentleman
have you ever watched reefer
madness.
Mr speaker and and a lady I've I
heard the term I know the term
I've never seen it.
Mr speaker and gentleman you
have to watch it it's at
hopefully for most people it's a
role in the aisles comedy I mean
the things that they that they
report and and Mr speaker and
gentleman I was I was a good kid
growing up I never did anything
but the people around me all did
you cannabis and not and the one
thing that I noticed that it did
was very much relaxation
Milonakis not not going out and
committing robberies and killing
people Mr speaker and gentleman
can you address that a little
bit.
Mr speaker and and and gentle
lady you know
The the the idea of that
Cannabis leads you to.
Committed you know violent acts
or look up that.
There there is simply no
evidence to show that can.
Is in any way
even as dangerous as alcohol
community agencies and tobacco
it's not
Sadly sadly in the licit drug
markets you know when you deal
with cannabis coming from and
this is sources.
Quality control you know these
drug cartels on how testing
facility to ensure that what
you're ingesting is not going to
kill you.
These folks don't care they're
there to make the money in there
to stretch the product as far as
we can you know a good friend of
mine was reminding me the other
day as as as you know and he's
not fully on board with this
because of the the right don't
don't don't get me wrong but he
said look a lot of people say
that cannabis is a gateway drug
he said the real gateway.
Is that on the street corner
she's a gateway.
To hard drugs he's a gateway to
heroin two men.
To crack cocaine to whatever
else that they're using their.
Is there's there's really just
no evidence that the that it is
now all that to say all that to
say Mr speaker and gentle lady.
No one under the age of twenty
one should be smoking cigarettes
vaping drinking alcohol for
smoking cannabis you shouldn't
your body's developing your
brain is developing you know you
and I have done a lot of work on
early childhood there's no one
who knows how to explain adverse
childhood experience better than
you
and.
Dabbling in this stuff when
you're not emotionally
physically mentally mature is a
bad idea that's why our bill has
specific provisions to deal.
With those issues right and
that's why our bill is twenty
one and older and there's some
pretty strict guidelines to
ensure that that that that
happens
so you'll need to change your
question to me okay cannabis is
not you know it's it's not that
danger is terrible things that
we've been led to believe.
we've been led to believe that
because of the societal norms
that have been adopted as a
result of these draconian laws
that were imposed on us sixty
years ago.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman and you talk a little
bit about alcohol and I remember
it was a documentary or all
right read it somewhere that
there was and I want to see hers
but I could be wrong one of the
the robber Baron for lack of a
better word I'm back in the day
who who were making a lot of
money on alcohol and they were
also involved in demonizing
cannabis to prop up their own
industry Mr speaker and
gentleman do you know what I'm
talking about.
Mr speaker gentle lady but I do
I do not okay I don't have the
facts so I won't I won't take
that any farther Mr speaker and
gentleman do we have any way to
estimate how much how many
dollars that could be going to
New Mexico are currently going
particularly to Colorado but
also to California soon to
Arizona do we have any even yes
about how how much that is Mr
speaker gentle lady you know I I
don't and and I don't really you
know if if you talk to folks in
Colorado particularly the border
towns
you know with New Mexico the
there does seem to to be quite a
traffic in in fact I was on a
call.
Over the summer with with
somebody up there
small small producer up there
and I think it was in Trinidad I
remember correctly but but there
is a lot of cross.
a lot of traffic that goes up
there and you know he's out for
the day or whatever
I would assume that it's it's
quite a few right and and you
know that's that's one of the
bright spots of having a
legalization framework like ours
in New Mexico that those
frontier communities you know
those tourist towns in in the
southeast right near near the
border with taxes you know new
Colorado because our product is
under our framework it's gonna
be a lot cheaper and there's
Arizona and I don't remember the
tax rate in Arizona but I would
be surprised if there any lower
than what we're proposing
You got communities and in in in
Oklahoma other neighboring
states who who I think you know
eleven Mexico the lever
disposing of our food you know
they love whether they love the
outdoor activities and this is
another piece of that equation
of that hospitality industry
right we would be able to build
a few days ago on liquor
licenses right and and how they
were into the those are
instrumental to reviving that
hospitality industry this is
another part of that right and
so I I think that.
Right now we we send dollars out
we would love to keep those
dollars here but most important
to love to get the new dollars
from those places as well.
Thank you for that Mr speaker
and gentleman the reason I ask
is I have some friends who were
in Trinidad this weekend
actually
and they said about seventy five
percent of the license plate for
from Texas and the other twenty
five percent for from New Mexico
so Mr speaker and gentleman I
think there is definitely money
to be made and I'm just I just
walk in with with it seems a
little silly but get some it's
true we could call milk a
gateway drug because almost
everybody who's addicted to
anything that I think has had
milk in their lifetime so we
could say that mail is that
gateway drugs to being at a at a
thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Thanks for the debate the
gentleman from Dona Ana
Representative small.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
and does the gentleman from
Bernalillo yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
the onion of.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlemen I'd like to pick up Mr
speaker and gentleman we heard a
little bit about really the
roots
in the incredibly harmful rural
routes of the war on drugs and I
I'm sure we will and we need to
hear more of that during this
debate but I want to Mr speaker
gentleman to ask you specially
based upon.
Your discussion about working on
this for a long time in the many
different folks who have been
part of it can you talk to us a
little bit more about what the
group of stakeholders that has
helped build this bill what that
group looks like is that
stakeholders just from the I.
twenty five corridor is that
stakeholders from one industry
or is it a broader group of
stakeholders that has helped
bring us to this point today.
Mr speaker and gentleman
that's a great question and and
that's something that the I
think it is is Morris mentioning
again and and diving into a
little bit more detail.
Of your bill's up as I said in
the beginning you know this bill
I I sort of inherited from now
the signature workforce
solutions who was and
representative bill mccamley and
we had put in a lot of work with
with advocates property clearly
folks at the drug policy
alliance who at the national
level have been at the forefront
of many of these policies across
the country in in here in New
Mexico as well.
Over that process I would say
you know the circle is pretty
small I mean as as you heard any
of the polling the polling was
was only sort of an interesting
point friends right because we
knew we knew that the polling
ten years later was in that much
different which does but back in
oh eight or nine twenty ten
twenty twelve.
Only because one the more you
know people just weren't ready
for it and I think some people
are looking at Colorado and kind
of checking out that experiment
first to see what it would be
like and I think once people
realize that the the sky didn't
fall
you know people became more
comfortable of the other piece
of that equation though to is
are are very smart
medical cannabis program the the
legendary compassionate use act
which another one of our co
sponsors was insured
instrumental in in building that
in improving that over the last
few years but as more and more
people kind of became accustomed
to the idea of cannabis in that
context as the medicine is
something that is not going to
do something that is not going
to.
and you know and we're still
making it funny but in that
context of the medical account
is program and actually in the
meeting Spain and makes you feel
better and allows you to be more
functional in your everyday life
so
Fast forward to twenty.
Seventeen twenty sixteen I think
that group begin to roll you
know you start having more
people who engage in public
health having more people fully
engage you know in the medical
cannabis industry we started
having medical cannabis patients
come to the table as well saying
wait a minute.
This has been got sent for us
this is a program we deeply care
about whatever you do if you
legalize adult use cannabis
please do not do it at the
expense of our program and so
those folks were among the first
in amongst the most diligent in
in in not only having a seat at
the table but at demanding us to
the table and rightly so.
in in twenty in twenty nineteen
which is when I really think you
know I think what they want when
you're fifty years from now
we're all gone and there are a
bunch of the legislature's and
somebody's looking back of
twenty nineteen is going to be
that federal year twenty
nineteen is going to be the year
when.
Cannabis came to.
Mainstream support in our
legislature up until then it had
been sort of a pet project of a
few provided tors I never really
get over the hump in the middle
of twenty nineteen we came up a
little bit short of you know we
we ended up in Senate finance
committee Senate finance.
with like two days ago and ran
out of time but the fact that we
were able to get that
particular bill out of two house
committees
six hours of debates combine and
then a three hour debate on the
floor.
Which by the way if you remember
that floor debate we had about
two hours of incredible debate
and then working movie so much
some Republican senators.
All to reach an agreement on
something that they could
support and we ended up passing
that bill out of this chamber so
as a result of that twenty
nineteen experiment is as a
result of all that work you know
I think you really force the
issue.
To to to to societal mainstream
as I said earlier this was in it
had achieved mainstream within
the legislature thanks.
But it was after that session
was over that I think society
was seen wearing a minute ride
why are you legalizing it what's
the problem and that really I
think was one of the motivators
for our governor to to to set up
the cannabis working group and
call it a working group not a
task force because of so many
folks call the task force but it
was really just working group
I'm not sure what the difference
is honestly but I think the the
the terms working group made it
so that it was a little bit more
flexible less formal you know
people in and out as opposed to
an appointed body that you know
two points or whatever that task
force was very diverse on that
task force you had medical
cannabis patients you have
members of the medical cannabis
industry these are the folks
with licenses now that produce
and sell medical cannabis public
health experts.
You had physicians early
childhood advocates that law
enforcement professionals.
You have had a couple
legislators myself into
Republican senator
from I believe he's from a I
think he's he's from the
southeast part of the state from
the state
you had you know economic
developers you have
representatives of the tribe's
you had a whole list of experts
around the table not only that
but these experts round the
table ended up reading over the
course of an interim in tables
all across the state.
I think you're elderly
Fund center for a couple of
Santa Fe and then the rest of
the management other parts of
the state I'm not exactly sure
where but they they definitely
get Lee
you know Albuquerque.
and this explains where from all
over the state in fact one of
the medical cannabis advocates
was from I believe he was from
either read also a loss when one
of the two
and so it was them that really
crafted what became the twenty
twenty the cannabis legalization
bill our chamber didn't get to
hear that bill because it didn't
get out of the Senate but it is
that bill that became the the
model for what we have in front
of us today and quite frankly
with very few changes most of
what was in that building twenty
twenty that was developed by the
working group is still in this
bill with some relatively minor
differences.
Thank you so much Mr speaker and
gentleman.
The your rich knowledge and that
incredible history in the idea
of welcoming everyone to the
table reaching out across all
parts of the state welcoming and
stakeholders with diverse
viewpoints saying that they
should be part of the group as
you said to continue working on
this and to build the the
framework we see today is
excellent and I wanted to spend
a couple other quick questions
going through some things that
of particular importance to me
and have also been questions
raised by constituents I heard
the number the seventy four
percent support from New
Mexicans certainly resonates in
conversations that I've been
fortunate to have with different
folks back home.
But one of the things that folks
of frequently brought up is that
it and the recreational cannabis
for adults over the age of
twenty one it just it makes
sense but we have to make sure
and do it right and one of the
areas that they've highlighted
in Mr speaker and gentleman from
Bernalillo gentle lady from
Santa Fe one of the things that
actually they really highlighted
are the environmental
protections and I think those
focus Mr speaker and gentleman
certainly around care for new
Mexico's precious water which I
know we've had wonderful
discussions on here in this body
they focus around things like
soil health and making sure that
the energy that's going into
producing our food that we're
trying to do that in a way that
sufficient that states that some
of our mentally friendly did
some of those concerns come up
during this working group and do
some of those inform the
legislation that you're
discussing here today.
Mr speaker and gentleman this is
yes this
a lot of those concerns that
were raised raised in in the
twenty nineteen interim with the
working group and even before
that keep in mind
How often do we get to say Hey
there's this really will time
hundreds of millions of dollars
industry and let's build it the
way we want to build
Representative we get to do it
with alcohol we didn't get to do
that with tobacco we didn't get
to do that with oil and gas we
we really don't get to do that
with renewables although you
know in some ways we get to
but with this one.
Really make that there can be an
industry unless there's
legislature votes yes.
And once we do that we would
have done so in our own more
with our own vision which is
really exciting and like I said
at the beginning it's an awesome
responsibility don't get me
wrong
you know I don't I I I I I'm
gonna lot of sleep the last few
minutes is kind of thinking and
rethinking this bill over and
over again but it is a really
incredible opportunity that our
children's children will look
back and say oh my god that
billion dollar industry a
multibillion dollar industry
perhaps.
You know it was started from
scratch.
With visa hundred and twelve
provided towards putting their
heads together and and debating
in clashing and and getting
going so.
Session yes the issue of of one
of of of going to continue to be
good stewards of the environment
has come up in in this bill we
have created a within the
licensing structure.
a ways for the for the for the
cannabis control division as a
take applications for licenses
and is they make a determination
chair to look at things like are
very clean water right for using
renewable energy right are you
insuring that there are adequate
ways to
to disposed of of waste water if
you're in the manufacturing
space all of those things will
be C. components of the
licensure process and you know
we've got a we've got a is as of
beginning got a hit that sweet
spot right we want to ensure all
these things would give
regulators a little bit of
flexibility because this
industry just coming right up
right it's not like the
industry's gonna take off in an
instant it's gonna take a little
while but we cannot forget those
critical critical issues again
because we are starting from
scratch and we get to build
those industries in our own
vision in in our our with our
own values so I really
appreciate the question because
again we have been able to do
that other incredible industry
right those industries just kind
of came up and and then there
are wanting to kind of just were
there and then we're going back
now in trying to regulate in
some ways or maybe we under
regulate made available right
you know but with this one we
can really get started on solid
footing and you know do this
right on the one that's not to
say Mr speaker and gentleman
that is not to say that this
bill is perfect and that is not
to say that my Sanchez and I
have the perfect system here.
I don't.
It is a lot more than was in
twenty nineteen and a lot more
perfect than it was in twenty
fifteen when Representative my
County for sentences I got
assigned to five house
committees I.
You know between this mail to
you right now if we're not back
here next year and the year
after that in the year after
that making some tweaks then
there's something wrong with.
Because we absolutely will be
coming back and we can missing
we should this document doesn't
die and the dates passes I'm and
governor this document continues
to bring in a live the way it
has for the last fifteen years.
Thank you so much Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen and that you
know that that closing is so in
keeping with this diverse
broad inclusive group of
stakeholders that you haven't
discussed here today that
collectively have brought this
legislation here to us from all
corners of our state from all
perspectives from different
walks of life and so I think the
the work to get here today is so
impressive I appreciate you the
visiting about a few of these
key questions I'll just close by
saying that I appreciate deeply
all of those pieces and also
again the highlight the
inclusion of the department of
agriculture which I see is in
your legislation the department
of environment which is tasked
with important work within your
legislation specifically because
they have a great experience in
our state ensuring that what's
grown is safe that it's grown in
the best possible sorts of ways
they're going to be there to
bring it by and guidance in the
sorts of rules I think are
necessary to create as you say
this new industry in a way that
begins to crowd out the very
worst things that have been
visited upon New Mexicans and
all sorts of negative
consequences and to replace with
a vibrant safe well thought out
industry and approach to frankly
Representational democracy that
is inclusive that welcomes folks
to be part of the solution and
that is always working to make
things better and so I am very
excited today I appreciate this
time to get to visit on these
issues with you and your co
sponsors and with that I would I
would set up thank you.
Thanks for the debate the
representative from Bernalillo
Representative Stapleton.
Is.
The gentleman from.
I yield to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
This.
listen to
one of the first.
Also responsible.
Yes.
The discussion going into the
different types of.
Of.
The subject matter wanting to
the different type of.
Of
the kind of this that was
recreational cannabis cannabis.
So this.
Then.
The.
It is speaker and gentle lady
from Beverly hills
That's a that's a really good
question
so let let me let me backtrack a
little bit here and so you know
there's there's medical cannabis
which is kind of is that would
be used
by by those who are operating
under then and there and
compassionate use act so you
know there's a list of
qualifying conditions that you
must meet in order to be able to
get that card
with this bill you know it's I I
I try to I try to use the phrase
adult use cannabis verses
recreational recreational I kind
of feel it makes it seem like
we're just Chillin at the park
and lighting up a joint and I I
you know that nobody not nobody
does recreational drinking you
know we don't refer to
recreational drinking or
recreational smoking you know I
may go hit up a winery or two or
maybe go to a micro brewery or
or maybe go to my favorite dive
bar in the neighborhood
and maybe I'm doing it for
business meeting with somebody
over a beer or maybe a meeting
with a constituent over
microbrewery at the you know a
retractor brewery in wells park
he'll this is really just
another layer it's it's another
thing to do it's it's adult use
cannabis having said that you
know I think a lot of us also
use word recreational very
loosely the media I mean every
time there's a media article
about there's a talk about
recreation.
it's really adult use cannabis
if you use it for recreational
purposes that's great and if you
use it for business purposes
that's free to
in terms of your question re for
god yeah I I don't know I don't
know where those two terms fit
in here I don't know the history
of those terms I'm not sure if
if if you know as as Michael's
foster explained earlier you
know the term might wanna has
some very negative origins I'm
not sure of the two terms that
you use have the same margins
but I would love to learn more.
but.
So just mention thank
you.
So smoking.
So this is.
I guess.
Medical cannabis the cannabis.
Recreational cannabis.
In the same.
In my opinion from the.
What.
Thank you Mr.
Understood Mr speaker understood
thank you there is further
debate the gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr speaker.
John please you.
I yield to the gentleman from
curry.
Thank you I appreciate you
yielded a gentleman in your
opening remarks I believe I
heard you say that there are
fourteen states now that have
of.
Recreational cannabis I believes
the term is that correct
gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman of the
that is correct fourteen states
have legalized cannabis for
adult use.
Okay and I think I heard your
predecessor stated that this
this bill was originally kind of
modeled after Senator the other
states that have already adopted
similar laws.
And
it is that still true is this
follow some of the laws have
been adopted by the other
states.
Mr speaker and and and gentleman
you know I think I think the
bill in front of us takes a lot
of lessons learned from some of
these other places
you know particularly in places
like Colorado and it really
really tries to not make the
same mistakes for example
Colorado other tax rate I
believe is way too high you know
as we were really really
cognizant of that.
As I said in my opening remarks
Illinois is the closest thing to
us.
I was.
Right now it's longer and and
they were very excited about the
model and and said you get
followers who and and I kind of
took some offense because we
have added that bill before they
had their bill the only
difference is our bill passed in
twenty nineteen and there's past
like two months later so if
anything our bill is being used
by others as a legalize their
own cannabis industry.
Thank you for that Mr speaker
and gentleman
in the state of Colorado when a
pastor along.
Allowed the communities and
cities the jurisdictions that
wanted to opt out.
The cannabis programs in the
state of Colorado no.
Arizona I believe there are a
few communities but before
falling into a fact passed
ordinances so but they could opt
out.
Not sure about all four but I've
heard that they may have some
options and I noticed your.
The gentleman on page forty five
has strict language.
this is a community of
jurisdiction cannot requirements
testing licensee.
Senator licensed premises to
relocate or in so you can't you
can't push people out.
Once this is passed and there is
no opt out plans.
in Mrs you.
Cannot completely prohibit the
operation of the licensee with.
I I I don't believe that's.
Better than this in the heart of
New Mexico I don't think that
the state of New Mexico is in
the habit of forcing the
communities to do things against
their will.
In order to offer an amendment.
To your bill.
Mr speaker I believe it is been
passed out.
The two oh two numbers two two
zero one eight four point three.
The moment gentleman.
Gentleman from NASA but we're
waiting to see if we can get on
the web so be patient please.
Thank you Mr speaker second
time.
The online.
Thank you Mr speaker gentleman
who explained the amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker of.
From Bernalillo this this
ammendment on page forty five
between line wanted to inserts
one new paragraph this is a
local jurisdiction may prohibit
by ordinance the sale of
cannabis products in the local
jurisdiction.
Within six months following the
effective date of the cannabis
district right wreckage motion
act.
So there's a very small window a
six month window.
They can do it would be
inappropriate would not be fair
to have this forced into the
community and then for some out
that is that's not fair but if a
local jurisdiction decide they
don't want to their community.
They can do what some cities in
Colorado did some in Arizona
they can opt out and notify the
state immediately that the.
Their jurisdiction by your
agency is going to prohibit the
sale of cannabis.
Also on page forty five of the
district's progress to its
entirety that's the paragraph
that states.
They are completely prohibitive.
We cannot completely prohibit
the operations of a licensee
for licenses.
And then
of page forty five one sixteen
if the would relocate.
It says the the cannot require
an existing license.
Licensee of a licensed premise
to relocate.
And then it says.
Are provided with the local
jurisdiction has not prohibited
by our agency the sail cannabis
products.
The reason I bring this forward
Did you know way back in time we
would be I was very young and
then you were yet to be born.
a lot of the communities within
our state decided not to allow
the sale of alcohol.
And so we had wet counties met
drive counties and gentleman
until November of twenty
nineteen the county I'm from was
dry.
So about a year and a half ago
that County the Senate bill
would go ahead and allow alcohol
sales but for many many many
years as a dragon.
So gentleman I would just like
to four.
To the local jurisdictions the
option.
A very short window to opt out.
We also have the ability to
offer back in and if they do
they can't opt out again there's
one opportunity to opt out if
you missed that window your
chances are missed so gentleman
hope you find this is a friendly
amendment.
And now stand for questions Mr
speaker.
Our this go back to the sponsor
Representative Martinez
gentleman from Bernalillo is
this a friendly amendment.
you Mr speaker very respectfully
this is not a friendly
amendment.
Illinois
is in today on the amendment.
Gentleman from San Juan
Representative lane.
Thank you Mr speaker to your
gentleman from Currie you'll.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from San Juan.
Mr speaker thank you gentleman
from occurring.
A couple questions ensure
understand what this amendment
of the U..
Of this amendment would not
prohibit a person from.
Possessing cannabis consistent
with this bill if an effective
local municipalities opted out
that's correct.
The gentleman that as I
understand it this amendment
would prohibit the sales of the
product within that
the community.
Mr speaker gentle at all costs
question differently night
sometimes so for me I have a a
practical example so.
I live in affect.
Bloomfield is just south of
where I live so if after quarter
past New Orleans under this
amendment says.
filter not permitted within
affectof of Bloomfield chooses
not to opt out.
Can I as a citizen drive over to
Bloomfield and purchase
cannabis.
Dr Wecht affect and and still to
this and still be okay
underneath this bill.
Mr speaker gentleman as I
understand it yes.
The Mr speaker this amendment
would.
Cause any kind of hardship on
people who desire to use
cannabis consistent with.
This bill is that a fair
understanding Mr speaker.
Mr speaker gentleman yes.
And.
Mr speaker Jennifer curry can
you just maybe push out a little
bit more for me why.
we should take a jurors
distributors to combine
jurisdiction approach rather
than a top down approach from
the state.
Mr speaker gentleman is as I
stated earlier about comments
there are jurisdictions that
were for for not have sales take
place in in their jurisdiction I
talked to a couple of years that
have indicated they would they
would prefer not to have
recreational cannabis sold in
their jurisdiction and
I was encouraged to bring forth
this ammendment just to give
them the option let's let them
have the disorder decision made
by local elected officials.
Mr speaker Jennifer from current
thank you.
And I noticed in the text the
amendment.
Mr speaker at limits.
The time frame to six months.
From the date this bill would
become effective in order for
gonna spell of the.
To opt out Mr speaker can in the
German speaker you just help me
understand what the thought
processes and and the six month
time frame.
Certainly gentleman it takes two
or three months to get an
ordinance introduced before the
governing body you have a
Public comment period and you
implement the ordinance make it
official.
So there is a time.
Needed for the time that this
becomes official this that it's
a it comes in contact in the
state of New Mexico it's a very
brief window but bill out the
opportunity for them to opt out.
They can under this amendment
all back end if they so choose
at some point.
But that six two month window is
the only opportunity to opt out.
It has to happen at the very
start of the process so that
everybody knows you don't want
to have people come in and
invest money into the community
I buildings built buildings have
distribution centers and then
opt out that's not fair.
Mr speaker Jennifer Kerr is so I
think that the lack the last
twenty maintenance what I was
trying to really understand so
I.
As a business owner but let's
assume for discussion purposes
if this bill were to be
effective as of July one of
twenty twenty one.
I as a business owner
If I stay with the what day in
July of twenty two I decided I
want to open of tennis shop
within a particular jurisdiction
this amendment would not allow.
Mr speaker that jurisdiction
then pass an ordinance to
prohibit sales.
because of.
The six month time frame it are
expired correct.
Mr speaker gentleman is correct
the only opportunity to opt out
would be from July first to
December thirty first.
That would be the only period of
opportunities statewide there is
no extensions in this amendment
there's one opportunity.
And Mister speaker gentleman are
you aware are there other
jurisdictions that that handle
the I also need similar fashion.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I mentioned in my
opening comments the to the
Colorado has not felt I just
found out that I believe it was
either Illinois or Indiana I
have no doubt.
California I believe has an opt
out and there are a few
communities within Arizona that
have opted out.
I don't know of others I did not
have time to do a lot of
research.
Mr speaker Jennifer curry so
this is not a unique concept and
in fact there is a you know you
the gentleman gave California as
an example there is a website
actually.
where you can search every
single municipality in Arizona
perceive in California every
single County.
so that way there's transparency
about what's permitted and
what's not permitted but they do
have a similar concept as I
understand it in terms of
allowing.
The local jurisdiction to opt
out
I do want to say Mr speaker.
Jennifer curry as as someone
who's been involved in municipal
government as the city attorney
for.
Are going on eleven years I can
tell you that these type of.
Issues of work comes to.
Our state's creation versus
local creation local
municipalities.
Really appreciate
and fill to important to have
some local control.
but I think Mr speaker general
inquiry what what makes this
amendment more you need to what
I appreciate about it is it just
limit the time frame that a
municipality can opt out the
six more I think that is really
important.
For the body to understand that
so you you get on that that
tight time frame to either stay
in or opt out and if there is no
opt out within those six months.
Then that municipality would
forever fall under the state
provisions and fell underneath
this bill would be permissible.
So I think that's important
wrinkle
Any given.
Some control the local level
some some flexibility there and
then even if the local ministry
we opted out at some point they
could pop back in and that
which point that that option
would be permanent.
So for those reasons
because of the short time frame
because of the local control.
I I appreciate this moment I
think it's important.
And is it is a good addition to
this legislation about a year
back Mr speaker.
For the debate on the members of
the gentleman from Dona Ana
Representative small.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
Mr speaker does the gentleman
from curry yield.
Mr speaker I yield to my
colleague from Georgia.
Thank you so much Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen thank you
for bringing this forward but Mr
speaker gentleman I do have a
couple of questions Mr speaker
gentleman was this part of this
amendment or kind of a rough
approximation was part of the
legislation and in twenty
nineteen is that your
understanding and money.
Of Mr speaker gentleman.
I would say that for likely I I
don't know
I I do think that it was similar
to some language in one of the
Senate bills are here so ago I'm
not sure of that okay thank you
Mr speaker thank you gentlemen
and it's my understanding and I
think this really goes to to my
core question my understand and
understanding Mr speaker and
gentleman we've heard earlier in
tonight's debate the robust
group the working group that met
to discuss this
and the fact that there are a
number of law enforcement
professionals were part of that
group so Mister speaker
gentleman
my worry with this amendment is
that we could potentially create
a checker board all across New
Mexico of the legal uncertainty
would that be a fear that you
might have Mister speaker
gentleman.
Mr speaker gentleman I I would
say that know that there are
several states California
Colorado and many others that
are already doing this the
president is already there
it is a model the that seems to
work any other jurisdictions and
so no Sir I I don't believe that
would be a problem I think.
The problem that I perceive and
I believe a lot of the local
leadership perceives as of the
state is is again trying to
mandate something trying to
force it into the local
communities for the one or not
and they're not providing the
locals an option.
I I don't know how many mayors
were in that group I don't know
how many county managers or or
county chairman were in that
group but I have heard that
there are several that would
like to opt out if possible sure
that thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentleman I appreciate the
you know some of these states
and as we've heard earlier in
the debate most of the other
states who have legalized record
adult cannabis have done so by
these ballot initiatives where
we can dive into the specifics
Mr speaker gentleman I think
that we have the benefit of
working to set up a system that
is the very best possible that
minimizes some of the risks and
potential negative
consequences and Mr speaker
gentleman I do recall clearly
that law enforcement during this
twenty nineteen working group
and I think for good reason it
was deeply uncomfortable with
the idea of this provision
because Mr speaker and gentleman
if if there is
The more legal uncertainty the
more patchwork of regulations
that exist the more that there
is a checker board of okay here
not okay here that actually
creates the gray area of in my
view Mr speaker and gentleman
that creates this legal gray
area and that frankly Mr speaker
and gentleman the black market
the illicit market the market
that is unregulated the market
that does so much damage to
families in communities all
across not only our state but
the world those are the times of
uncertainties ambiguities
patchwork network of regulations
that that market thrives upon
and so Mister speaker gentleman
I deeply appreciate the intent
was which you bring this
ammendment forward but it is my
substantial fear Mr speaker
gentleman were we to adopt this
amendment contrary to the wishes
of law enforcement officials who
participated in the twenty
nineteen and subsequent working
group that we would only in fact
and and with no intention but
with and potential unfortunate
outcome of preserving an illicit
market continuing some of these
negative consequences caused by
that illegal market and not
getting rid of the illegal black
market and instead having a
safe regulated system that will
be there for for adult New
Mexicans who choose to to
partake in it so I appreciate Mr
speaker gentleman you bringing
this forward unfortunately I
can't support it but do
appreciate your answers and
discussion thank you Mr speaker
thank you.
There is currently a gentleman I
apologize there is further
debate the gentleman from Chavis
and Lincoln representative
Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from curry county
yield.
Mr speaker gentleman from Chavis
I yield.
Mr speaker and.
Gentleman from furry.
all of the comments from the
representative from San Juan and
I have a lot of questions along
are the only one that the I have
the was it in that line of
questioning was.
Is it possible for a county to.
Thank you very job your
amendment yeah the where the
county to be prohibit the sale
in the county but yes us the
municipality within that family
could do the exact opposite it
could remain subject to this act
and allow the sale of these
products within the city limits
are within the municipal limits
of that city.
Mr speaker gentleman from Chavis
it would be
my an educated opinion yes that
would be permissible curry
county had the City of Clovis
within curry county that was
swept.
While curry county itself
outside the city jurisdiction
was dry and I'm assuming that
that this would have that same
history of law behind it in the
summer.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
exactly how I read the a member
of
so you could have one
jurisdiction that would be use
the word Rohingya the other
jurisdictions
in the third grade to to sell
products or be subject to the
act that I don't see the.
Problems of the representative
from Bernalillo county was
raising because this does not go
to the issue of possession.
This goes all the way to the
issue of whether that the the
municipal or county at fifty is
going to allow the sale of these
products within the its
municipal or county limits and
so would you agree with me that
the
Since it deals only with for
sale.
Permitting licensees to sell
these products.
Would not create the law
enforcement dilemma the
representative from nineteen
pandemic was talking about.
Mr speaker gentleman from Chavis
are I would completely agree I
know that the communities that I
come out of we have a local
police department is a municipal
police department and we have a
county sheriff's department in
their jurisdictions are
completely separated they do
cooperate work together very
well but there are defined clear
lines of jurisdiction.
Mr speaker and gentleman I think
that with respect to the the
sale of a product it would be it
easily recognize statewide is
the gentleman from San Juan
pointed out in the state of
California.
You can go on a website know
what the locals are certainly
the police of the sheriff's of
members jurisdiction are going
to know that so what
jurisdiction does allow a
licensee to give a license to
sell these products another
jurisdiction does allow the
permitting process to continue
my job to their business it has
nothing to do with possession so
with that Mr speaker and
gentleman I thank you for your
answers and all support your
amendment.
Thank you gentlemen.
There is for the debate the
gentle lady from Chavis
Representative Ezzell.
On the amendment.
Mr speaker thank you very much
for the gentleman from curry
county yield.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Chavis I yield.
Mr speaker thank you very much
gentleman I like your amendment
of I just I have a couple of
questions and the.
My first one is is it in any way
will this interfere with those
people that have been given a
license to grow medical
marijuana will this interfere
with their ability to be able to
grow.
Mr speaker dual it is I
understand that they would be
under a different act.
This act this is for adult
recreational cannabis okay Mr
speaker and no wave with your
answer on that part of it these
people that are license to grow
medical marijuana in the state
of Maryland medical marijuana in
No Way impedes their ability to
be able to do that as well later
is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady us Mr
speaker you were talking about
your law enforcement in Travis
county is the same with the
jurisdictions within the
municipalities are surrounded by
our sheriff's department and I
have to.
Give.
A round of applause to our
shares Department and to our
city and municipal police that
are there they do an excellent
job.
It I think that what you're.
Amendment is going to do.
They will make it a lot clearer.
In our counties what is
happening there because they do
know which people are allowed to
grow medical and so medical.
Mr speaker the gentleman from
Dona ana that was talking about
the problem of the checkerboard
effect Mr speaker I understand
what you're saying about curry
county
my mother was born and raised in
Patel's actually she's born in
Hobbs raised him for dollars I
do understand the effect there
the between the dry economic
with county and everything that
checkerboard effect also applies
to hunting.
And so person does need to know
where the a jurisdiction does
take place or where something is
prohibited.
Between the state and the
federal land and private land
that is a checkerboard effect
there too so a person can make
themselves educated on where it
is of where it is legal and
where it's not legal it's very
clear this just gives are
counties the right to say no we
at this time we are not
interested but later on if
through the voting and what
takes place with county
commissioners and our city
councils and everything they do
have the opportunity to often
after the six month period I
think it's only reasonable that
we do allow are counties to be
able to make that decision
instead of one more time
mandating from up here in the
legislature what are counties
have to do I'm tired of the
legislative body stating you
have to do this this is a
mandate now this is our counties
the opportunity to make that
decision by consulting with
their constituents Mr chairman
you Mr speaker and gentleman
from curry county.
Then from the.
As the local option with the
time frame put in place Mr chair
Mr speaker and gentleman from
current this is a great
amendment and I do plan to
support thank you very much.
Thanks for the debate on the
amendment the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker and well
the gentleman from curry county
yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the gentle
lady.
Thank you
Mr speaker and gentleman are you
aware that in this
And in this bill the cannabis
regulation access all functions
of the medical cannabis program
are rolled into
the same Division and control
over licensing of
those who can grow or
manufacture or sell cannabis.
Mr speaker gentle lady no.
As so Mister speaker and
gentleman all functions except
for
identifying what individuals
qualify as a medical patient for
purposes of being able to
purchase some of the medical
program are now under the
cannabis regulation Act.
And so Mr speaker and gentleman
is
The medical cannabis says of
medical care or that a patient
I would purchase isn't that
cannabis product.
Mr speaker Jody would you
restate your question please.
So whatever a patient in the
under the Lynn and Erin
compassionate use act were to
purchase from the dispensary
isn't that a cannabis products.
Mister speaker July yes that's
cannabis products so Mister
speaker and gentleman I think
that your amendment does include
medical cannabis within it and
so you have just allowed local
opt out of anyone being able to
grow manufacture or purchase a
cell or or purchase cannabis in
that community of for medical
purposes and that I just wanted
to point that out because it
appeared Mr speaker and
gentleman that you didn't
realize that the two were rolled
together thank you Mr Mr speaker
gentle lady I think you if it
does not prohibit growing this
is simply says that they can opt
out of the sale of cannabis
products in local jurisdictions
the card does go to neighboring
cities or counties to still
purchase for the could grow
their own under the
under this bill under this
amendment gentle enough and Mr
speaker and gentleman than
someone that has a local
dispensary so that they can
purchase it locally would have
to that dispensary would have to
close and then they would have
to travel somewhere else to get
their cannabis I just want to
point that out to the body that
this doesn't exam medical thank
you Mr speaker.
There is for the debate on the
amendment gentleman from San
Juan Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr speaker doesn't
current yield.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan I yield.
examples currently in New Mexico
where there is
Products that are not allowed to
be sold in their jurisdiction
that you're aware of.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
would assume for the question
you're aware of some sort I
would be happy for you to
educate me.
in San.
And in McKinley county the
Navajo reservation is
technically dry the products of
of alcohol.
spirits
are not allowed to be sold on
the reservation there in San
Juan County in McKinley county
except at casinos.
and so the speaker.
Proposing is not.
that is something that is
happening right now in New
Mexico I would imagine.
tribes the and and problems
across New Mexico may have
similar laws restricting the
sale.
alcohol on their sovereign lands
and Mr speaker and gentleman.
The.
They're not able to sell the
products are not able to be sold
in a liquor store or grocery
store or a convenience store gas
station out on on the
reservation in San Juan County
The.
Drugs themselves are not able to
have.
Some.
Not allow the sale.
Without prohibiting the
possession.
As to exactly what you're.
It would do is that correct Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan yes I agree.
This is Patty were to opt out of
the sale.
The opportunity for G. R. T..
The taxes a.
noted that in that county or in
that municipality is that
correct Mr chairman.
Mr speaker deliver from San Juan
yes.
from what I've seen from the
recreational.
Lana part of of a.
The house bill twelve.
The
additional G. R. T. on on the
side of marijuana substantial
I'm not as high as our
neighboring states.
But I think percent.
Is what the tax would.
on marijuana says is that twelve
percent Mr speaker.
Mr speaker gentle from San Juan
I believe that's the number that
are purchased.
Some
the fact that.
Products with the.
Recreational cannabis products.
Are going to.
Potential.
a decent amount of tax to that
community.
opting in the possession of that
is not changed it doesn't.
Would be that high for community
to opt out because really they
the state what what percent
problems and I have one with
cannabis in their community.
all
me is one of the problems go
with Singh said all of.
Want to add things that
dispensaries is that correct Mr
speaker and gentleman.
Mr speaker gentleman yes they
would be opting out of the
revenue they will also be opting
out of all the.
unintended consequences the
problems that come with it
I I would say there are
significant because I'm standing
here trying to pass this
ordinance on behalf of some of
the small communities.
Mr speaker thank you for that
answer because that is exactly
what I was going with this
Mr speaker and gentleman we had
a Joint Task Force and officers
from across the border in
Colorado from San Juan County
and what topics with the was
about the unintended
consequences of the state of
Maryland a for recreational
purposes in Colorado.
What I was.
At the presentation from those
officers from just over the
border.
Was that there were several
unintended consequences.
That is recreational
dispensaries our cash.
It's a very
hi
Cash product sales.
And so what.
Having was the idea of
a lot of calls from law
enforcement to these
dispensaries because of some.
Throttle another of potential
theft robbery
and so the speaker and gentleman
I was one of the consequences
from the sales.
And so.
If.
Jurisdiction.
Will determine that they wanted
to opt out of the sale.
of
It was still legal to possess
their communities.
To opt out of this so.
Not because one thing that
percent.
George but because the.
Our problems.
That come with the sale
It's.
As a.
As a panacea today that there
are no problems with this but
of
For.
From Colorado has basically
said.
Rushed into this.
This properly if we had it to do
again price pushing it in the
same fashion.
and gentleman the tax burden.
the societal consequences not
talk about that with the
sponsorship and that.
Of the law enforcement and.
Causes problems with
dispensaries.
Is an
then that is the best phone
carrying this.
that.
Want to opt out and I I was
assisting.
The statement made by.
From Santa that that law
enforcement does not want to
deal with a checkerboard.
And for my community.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
not from.
Law enforcement from across the
state so I'm not forced the
agency spoke on behalf of first
and then I speak on behalf of
law enforcement.
And San Juan county so
A critical understand quite what
you're looking.
We have a lot of local options
for the
products that which federally.
Pass this legislation it would
not rise as mentioned on saying
I want to which is to
criminalize it.
so Mr speaker and gentleman
I I stand with you on this I
think this is a good time that
we can allow local control and
allow the communities to not
have something forced on them
but I think this is a
substantial credit as well for
these communities of of those
that that madam but I allowing
folks to opt out I think it's
it's something that it's just a
matter of respect for on local
officials and I don't know if
you want to come in and that was
the but Mr speaker and gentleman
I plan on supporting your
amendment.
Mr speaker gentleman I I
appreciate your comments are I
believe that the law enforcement
in my area
would like to have the
opportunity to opt out I don't
think there is a concern about
Chakraborty if there is they
have not mentioned to me at all
and so I I think would be fine
there
Mr speaker
I would like to thank you for I
have the opportunity to withdraw
fall this ammendment for just a
moment I would like to deal with
the
Medical cannabis issue I think
that this amendment can be fixed
so that the medical cannabis is
not affected by this amendment
and and I would just if I might
have that kind is from your.
Gentleman give if you are
withdrawing the amendment I can
come back to
and have you propose a new
amendment I will however do it
in substitution for you so I'm
gonna try I'm trying to call on
both sides so it's alright with
you when you come back let me
know and I'll work with the
leadership of the of the risk of
your party to ensure that it's
done fairly but if you're
withdrawing the amendment it'll
be considered withdrawn I will
go back to debate on the bill
said acceptable.
Mr speaker yes I appreciate that
very much I I do understand that
I I did not.
I did not the.
Consider how this might affect
the the medical cannabis and I
have no intention in this
amendment to do that so Mister
speaker thank you for the
opportunity to address that I
appreciate
our work in a gentleman with the
leadership we will go back to a
discussion on the bill there is
for the debate so we are now
back on the bill the amendment
has been withdrawn the rep at
the gentle lady from tells
Representative Ortez on the
bill.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo
pleasing.
I yield to the gentle lady from
dollars.
Thank you both and thank you
that gentleman from Bernalillo
and all of the other sponsors
for bringing this legislation
forward
I'm from a rural districts I'm
also from a district that
borders Colorado.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I am
thankful for all the work that
you and the sponsors and the
task force and everyone that's
been involved in in creating
this legislation to ensure that
social justice measures are part
of the bill thank you for that.
She did
for me so in my rural district
right next to Colorado this this
bill is important in other ways
I think we can all agree that
economic diversification is a
priority for state in the last
year there's been so much
volatility in the energy sector
we've seen reductions in tourism
due to the COVID nineteen do I
think that really showed us how
much we need to diversify our
economy and bring in other kinds
of markets new markets really in
into the state.
At the same time you know I've
been watching the how the
legalization of recreational
cannabis I have been watching
very closely over the years and
and what we have seen in other
states is that really the it
seems to me like the economic
benefit from the cannabis
industry really is in the hands
of just a few people.
So Mr speaker and and gentleman
I what I really appreciate about
this bill and what really sets
H. B. twelve part is that this
bill really takes a different
approach one that I think holds
great opportunity and great
promise for rural New Mexico
where I am and and local
agriculture which I really care
about
you know the local entrepreneurs
small businesses they can apply
for licenses great small family
farms can get a micro business
licensing your available to
enter the market with lower
capital costs that's really
really important for our small
rural communities this bill is
so it's so important for us out
in the out in the hinterlands
away from the city Rainford for
me I see this as a you know that
that the license.
The commercial a possibility for
small farmers that's really
important in my district
I know that they care about this
you know I've been getting calls
and emails from folks asking me
where I stand on this I I know
they care I really care
Mr speaker and and the gentleman
you know I really I really love
a lot of parts of the state.
one of my favorite parts is
built that into the polities are
are able to generate the revenue
for the things that small small
towns like mine really care
about those local taxes that are
collected from the sales of
cannabis really can be used at
the discretion of the local
government I think it's really
important that small towns have
that flexibility the need that
for some of the ability they
know what they want to fund and
what they support and in the
case of my community and all the
communities in Taos County you
know I I can only imagine what
we can do with those resources
to tackle issues that are you
know that our local homegrown
issues our housing crisis
poverty behavioral health you
know we can use those funds to
tackle the things that we care
about that matter to us you know
I and I think it's important to
note here as well about the
tourism you know that that many
communities especially money
really relying on so you know
we've seen in Colorado small you
know lots of small mountain
towns have seen an upset at not
taken tourism and I imagine that
that we will to
I really just I I truly believe
that you know with this
regulated industry it'll be a
real boon for us in in rural New
Mexico we need jobs we need that
tax revenue in in all of our
communities and this this is why
I whole heartedly support this
bill.
That said I do I do have some
questions you know I think it's
important for folks watching you
know that that they understand
you that you know some of the
ins and outs of this bill so Mr
speaker and and gentleman I can
explain to me with the processes
for small family farmers you
know applying for a license what
does that what does that look
like what to look for my
community.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
gentlelady from tiles that's a
fantastic question.
So much of what's in our in our
legislation in terms of the
licensing process will be
determined through the the read
the the regulation process that
the cannabis control division
which is being created through
this is bill will you know will
will come up with right and
there are a couple of advisory
bodies that will be created as
well to help those regulators as
we go through the process but in
terms of the nuts and bolts of
all that of that framework you
know your community it's I mean
you know by the way it's a
beautiful community and can we
competitive to be over because
it is one of our favorite hang
out spots for for my family and
me.
but you know for your community
what it means is you know small
local farmers you know maybe you
got a maker to lance.
you know you've got your your
access to your water that you
know probably has been passed on
for generations in those
families with those communities
it's not going to take a whole
lot for those folks to come
together
applied for the micro business
license with very very small
amount of capital you know the
the actual costs hold one of
these licenses is going to be
pretty low I mean we're talking
you know I six thousand dollars
maybe
as compared to the bigger
licenses which are going to be
obviously a lot more that
license is gonna allow you know
of that neighbor of those two
three neighbors who came
together in this business to
grow up to nine nine plans those
that they will be allowed to
manufacture products using those
plans whether it's you know
flower or whether it's you know
mandibles.
the data by by all the same
rules in terms of labeling and
you know making sure that
children in our can see picking
up the child prove packaging
whatnot.
those seem licenses their call
the need to go vertically
integrated my for business
licenses what part of the that
license will also allow
those folks to to sell
to sell retail
you know whatever products
they're they're small companies
produces the bill also calls for
the division to create some sort
of
labeling requirements so you
know when I go to you know my
local dispensary.
X. Y. Z. you know whatever big
company
I would be able to go and look
at the shelf look at the product
and there's going to be you know
perhaps the boxer G. R. bag or
something with you know thou's
collaborative you know locally
grown organic are fed with owls
valley water.
that's the kind of stuff that
will go on the table
because there's gonna be a niche
market for those small
operations not unlike you know
we go into the coop and getting
some apples from Dick's work you
know some you know some green
Chile from hatch or or limit our
the data if you're if you're
closer to them and how much
it's gonna allow those small
communities to really if if they
want to get in thinking it is
and that was one of the lessons
learned of of of other places
places like Colorado where you
know I don't know what it's like
now but initially was very hard
to get in you know if you were
one of these local farmers and
in the
You know in in the rural
community in Mexico in in
Colorado you probably weren't
able to get in and right now
it's probably even harder to get
it you had a lot of outside
money coming in so the couple
everything up we're trying to
avoid that you know we're trying
to strike a balance right
between ensuring that the small
local communities farmers
entrepreneurs
can get into this business in
whatever way they choose to that
same example I gave you who
knows maybe those three bodies
are really good at what they do
and within three years you might
be able to get a full out
license right one of these big
licenses that will allow them to
expand to you know communities
across the state and who knows
maybe even to expand to
the communities in other in
other states where where he's
brings legal as well so it's
it's a fantastic business
opportunity with tremendous
growth potential
it is the the way we crafted
this again as I said at the
beginning of the debate
you know if you show up with
your application and then you've
got
system to recapture rainwater or
something you know or to recycle
the water we all of those things
will be in your favor as you
apply for a licence first is the
guy who's gonna roll in which is
here you know typical typical
application without any of those
different ones coaches of the
the last single stated that Mr
speaker and and gentle lady.
you know at the beginning of
your comments you mentioned the
ability of the flexibility of
local governments to be able to
tap into these resources and so
in in this bill I'm actually one
of the amendments made in the
house tax a substitute for you
know the bills was to increase
the the local tax went from
three percent four percent
at the same time we lowered.
The the state excise tax so the
way it stands now is the state
excise taxes eight percent local
option of four percent and then
you know and then you get into
the whole issue of if an
incorporated county and city so
like if you're in Albuquerque
Bernalillo county you know
whatever is sold on on the
county line if you will stays
with the county whatever sold in
the city side stays in the city
it is my understanding from TRD
that there are these
memorandums of understanding
that
you know that that that other
industries that that that
counties and cities have with
regard to other parts of the tax
code for the share some of the
revenues rise and so this is one
where we would expect that to
happen hopefully.
this and these are resources
that will go into these
communities to help pay for you
know law enforcement to help pay
for social services you know
perhaps to go prepare a pothole
or two it's it's it's a revenue
source that wasn't there before
that's not to say that it's all
you know rainbows unicorns and
yeah I mean you know I think
with as with any new industry
you're gonna have some growing
pains and so our approach is to
ensure that
governments have the resources
available to be able to mitigate
whatever growing pains Madam
come of this
one lasting about that piece is
local governments not only will
enjoy to use the four percent
excise tax they also have the
replicable gross receipts tax on
top of that also that's another
revenue source for the Mr.
Mr speaker gentleman that that
that was so helpful thank you I
think it's really important for
whoever's listening to really
understand how how this works at
the local government level and
what the opportunities exist for
our our local entrepreneurs you
know that there are.
You know I'm not gonna give you
a number for their there are
entrepreneurs and house County
who I think would would welcome
the the news that they can
engage in business that is
legitimate and that can be taxed
and that goes from you some of
those taxes go right back into
into the community and and so
I'm I'm grateful that this bill
really sets you know says the
framework for that that's so
critical for for local economies
but also to address some of the
the you know the issues that
that folks have been
experiencing all fall around the
state so thank you and and we we
welcome you and your family a
fact Intel's when whenever it is
it is safe and maybe at that
point there will be lots of
entrepreneurship happening as a
as a result of of this bill so I
just wanted to make one more
more point and this is with
reference to the
the gentle lady from Santa Fe is
a comments about canvases as
medicine you know I
I think we've all suffered from
growing pains growing up you
know are you your legs hurt your
arms more is your you your child
you're growing and the and you
have some pains my grandmother
my getting the
this is a you know potion.
That she that she use that was
remarkably effective was a
bottle of rubbing alcohol with
some leaves from the pepper tree
and some leaves from the you
know from the cannabis plant.
She had a bunch of stories about
where she got it you work work
work she was able to get her
kind of as mostly from my cousin
Frankie but you know that it was
it was medicine and when my legs
hurt which was you know a lot
when I was a kid she you know
she open about bottled put into
her hands warm it up and and
massage my legs and you know and
it helps all of us right and and
I talked to her about how she
made it and she you know she was
she was pretty cryptic about it
but you know I think about all
those and then the she had in
the videos of our ancestors and
and how it's it's just a shame
that it's some criminalized.
And now it won't be and now we
can we can use this with the
with COVID with the votes from
this floor to you know to
envision imagine new remedies
new new ways to keep us healthy
and and safe so I thank you Mr
speaker and gentleman I yield.
There is further debate.
the gentleman from Santa of
Representative Lente.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield.
I yield to the gentleman
thank you gentlemen you know I I
can appreciate all the work that
you put into this piece of
legislation any cosponsored and
all of those that have come
before you we have inherited
this type of work and and you
and I Mr Mr speaker and
gentleman that conversation in
regards to this matter in
particular and and you know my
personal thoughts on this and we
can we have a separate those
personal bottoming comes to
Madison legislating in boarding
on matters on this floor or
virtually on the floor and so I
would hope that you understand
from coming from but I have a
few questions in regards to
native America and New Mexico
and as you might know that I
represent house district sixty
five that includes a very much
larger portion of native
American New Mexico I have seven
of those I have five chapters of
the Navajo Nation and I have a
committee of pagination within
my district so I I represent a
very broad swath of them and you
mentioned early in your
presentation in regards to
equity and diversity and and I'm
all about that you know better
than I than I do that you know
we come from a place where we
want to make sure that we are
Representative of our people and
we want to stick up for what's
right and I think I absolutely
and so Mister speaker and
gentleman a just a couple of
questions really the first one
is if they chose to do so.
Any of the problems nation tribe
be eligible to partake in in
this program through your the
legislation.
Madam Mr speaker and gentleman
yes yes as you know
the the issue of of tribal
sovereignty and.
You know sort of this
Imposition or oversight or you
know whatever we want to call
this this federal government
verses tribal government
relationship that has been in
the books for for much too long
that complicated relationship
has its own for admissions
probably more likely than not
however in the this bill we do
allow the state of New Mexico to
enter into government to
government
grievance to ensure that our
communities in in in native
American New Mexico USA are also
able to participate in this
industry things which used to
you know those those agreements
you know would probably have
been
Be executed in a way that you
know tribes can remain in
compliance with whatever
you know federal laws they've
got to comply with but we did
make it a point in this bill to
ensure that we afforded that
opportunity as well to to those
communities that
you know that that make up news
land right and and communities
that were here long before New
Mexico is.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman for your answer and I
appreciate your section forty
seven specifically to Indian
nation tribe within your bill
but I I guess my my question was
more so which is typically
speaking in regards to because.
Cannabis is still a schedule one
controlled substance to the
federal government and is
restricted on tribal lands.
Could we.
Still participate in this type
of programs.
Mr chairman and Mr speaker and
gentleman
I don't know I don't know the
answer to that I mean I I
suspect you probably do my mic
got response we I don't think so
but you know I I know of at
least one one tribe I think in
particular that does participate
in some sort of medical cannabis
operations I don't know the
specifics of how that works but
I I know that there is at least
one that I know of that does so
I I would assume something
similar would be followed for
any tribe in New Mexico that
would want to
participate in this new
industry.
Your speaker and gentleman thank
you for that answer I think
perhaps the the tribe of the
public you're talking about is
the pick a reserve level up in
northern New Mexico that that
tried to participate in the
medical marijuana of growing
market but
with very transparent about it
but in November of twenty nine.
Eighteen was raided by the
federal government and the
agents because again of
marijuana and cannabis is still
a schedule one controlled
substance per federal rules and
because try to technically on
tribal federal land at the the
the the the phase in like that
very much and we're essentially
I guess at the end of the day
targeted for trying to expand
their economic opportunities
unfortunately by people that are
supposed to be their trustees
and so Mr speaker and gentleman
that that would mean because
again representing a large swath
of native American Mexico the
last thing I want is to create a
a targeted defense of or focus
against those tribal governments
that and would like to partake
in something like this expanded
economic opportunity but still
yeah at the end of the day
sounds great.
In the state and federal
legislation but would just agree
and then you go any federally we
cannot we cannot and so I think
it's important to to find that
the station for the money simply
because as a representative of
the New Mexico I don't want
there to be some type of
assurance that maybe we can
partake in there's a section in
this in this piece of
legislation that will allow us
to when we cannot but my second
question Mr speaker and and and
gentleman Representative from
Bernalillo is.
if if any information or try can
not participate in the growing
or cultivation of recreational
cannabis even medical cannabis
at that at that since what about
tribal members that live on
tribal lands let me suppose I am
I am we're twenty one and I want
to partake in the program hi.
Participants.
Mr speaker gentlemen you don't
look a day past nineteen for the
record but
You probably lose me.
I you know I I don't I don't I
don't think so I mean I think if
you're if you live on tribal
land you're still on tribal land
I I'm not sure how.
So currently the medical
cannabis program allows patients
to you know to grow we grow
their own cannabis I'm not sure
how that is administered at the
moment I'm not sure of a member
of a tribal nations has a
medical cannabis card.
If they're able to
they're able to do their own
home girl I mean you just
explain to us very eloquently
that that as long as the feds
don't allow it tribes can not
participate by growing or or you
know producing on tribal land.
but you know there's nothing
there's nothing that says that
you are doing tribe couldn't
introduces agreement off the
reservation for example right
off on tribal lands.
I mean I think that that's
really the spirit or language
here is understanding the
limitations that we have to you
know to.
you know.
Trump from committee we're
trained federal law when it
comes to their relationships
with tribes you know I think
that what we really want to
ensuring our bill is that we
don't forget about those
communities but to your
particular question I I don't
know the answer to that I don't
know if you could you know Mr
speaker and gentleman you know
on your property on your farm I
don't know if you could money
personal level
grow your own I I would assume
you can't because you're so all
federal land
although I would also say that
if you preach to the converted
difficult for the feds to
enforce
you know hold grow for example
if if if that's what you did.
And and so Mister speaker and
gentleman I appreciate your your
your comments to that and so I
think what I was going with this
is that.
I still don't think that if if
Derrick Lindsey wanted to try to
home grow a plant that my Pueblo
would allow me to because again
it's it's still a controlled
substance but what I was going
with this is perhaps a
hypothetical may help is that if
I go into my neighboring town of
Bernalillo or Albuquerque go to
the go to the dispensary and
pick up an allowable for
I'm not and then drive back home
and when I get back home I have
it on my person the substance
controlled substance on federal
land.
And and I guess my question is
how do we save the state county
sheriff following legislative
cop sees me and says Hey we're
gonna stop you because we're on
federal land now I think we saw
you pick up some some
recreational cannabis.
we're gonna put you to the
tribal police because they have
jurisdiction over you as a
tribal member.
R. is this loss setting me up as
a tribal member.
And other tribal members across
the state for potentially.
Criminal prosecution imposition
over and over and over again
because again we have this
jurisdictional issues.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
wouldn't say that these laws
setting you up for that I mean I
I I would use if you live near
the border of of and and now my
borders are getting smaller and
smaller because Arizona's
legalized but if you're on the
border with Texas for example
a new purchase cannabis on the
New Mexico side you you're not
supposed to go into the Texas
side and I would assume it's the
same thing in your hypothetical
but I would also say you know
this is not sitting well for
that I mean it seems that you
know if if.
If if that's the case on the
other side in line and then you
know you've got a I I would have
to live.
you know hence the discussion
earlier about you know local
offense right if you have this
checkerboard approach in your
driving through four counties we
might be breaking the law from
two of those four counties.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you for that clarification again
it it just brings up a lot of no
for me and and again this is
these are not personal these are
matters of the logistics from
you representative so many so
much of native American Mexico
and so.
Bill eight I just worry
that maybe there's an unintended
consequence that perhaps through
this piece of legislation that
we may be and that
discrimination is a tough words
are we're gonna be that's the
long working and I apologize if
it is.
Discriminating against the
population based simply on the
race and domicile arrangement
that is maybe outside of their
control meaning outside of my
control yes I can I can move my
family and my home to Bernalillo
or Albuquerque if I want to
partake in this program but I'm
just in the tribal members I
love living at Sandia pueblo I
would never leave here and so
Mister speaker and gentleman
it's you know I.
I take it because in terms of
regarding the comments made
earlier in regards to equity
diversity because it worries me
that other native Americans in
New Mexico a little over ten
percent of the population of New
Mexico and native Americans that
may be impacted by this piece of
legislation and and I say that
openly and candidly because
again you and I know each other
and and I love you as a brother
but the same time we're here to
do the work of the people were
doing the work of the people and
representing them on this
virtual house floor to a point
where we have to talk about
these issues openly and candidly
and and objectively and so I got
one follow up question then Mr
speaker gentle and I and I will
peel my time
What what about the police the
B. I a better police or even
tribal police
how will they be instructed to
prosecute or how the be
instructed to to police their
respective lance.
Mr speaker and gentleman I mean
that's that's a question for the
federal government I mean I
think what we see what we've
seen the last
the last couple of
administrations under Democrat
in a Republican it seems sort of
a hands off approach on these
issues for the most part I mean
I know that there there are
examples of including the one
you mentioned earlier but I
think that for the most part the
taken not hands off approach I
would assume that
you know I I I I highly doubt
that the Feds would have been so
much time prosecuting perhaps
cases of possession
you know versus maybe large
scale operations those obviously
are two very different things
but you know in terms of how how
to be a police or whatnot that
would be instructed I'm not sure
I mean that's not really the
question before us although I do
appreciate your points Mr
speaker and gentleman of of how
how this affects specific
communities like yours give in
that very very difficult tragic
ingest relationship with the
federal government I I one
hundred percent understand where
you're coming from
I will I will I will also say
though that you know this this
bill really is providing the
pathway toward toward
legalization
all the substance that for too
long has been used as an excuse
to prosecute
communities committees of color
primarily but really you know
lower income communities and
communities have been
marginalized for.
Generations including the ones I
speak of
and you know through our
legislation you know even though
I appreciate your your comments
concerns because I think that
they are very well founded
you know the fact remains this
is simply a pathway.
and.
As the federal government
sees the light and I believe
they will like I said at the
beginning it's not a matter of
of on if it's a matter of when
and I think we're very close to
seeing it happen the sky has not
fallen in any of these fourteen
states that have legalized there
have been some issues are been
some issues with the medical
program that been some issues
with the tax structure there's
been some issues with in terms
of market there being issues you
know with equity you know
Illinois has had a tough time
getting their equity pieces off
the ground even though it's a
maaf this is no different I mean
this is a path way toward and
we're gonna work out all of
these different teams and and
all and and and not just the
kings but the very difficult
aspects of this which are some
of the ones that you're bringing
up you know my my expectation of
the federal government will
legalize sooner rather than
later and you know if this
passes the session and there are
remains in place with with
tribes across the state and
maybe a couple of the stripes
you know invest in operations
maybe off off tribal land but
the best non the less in
operations that are within the
state of New Mexico once of Feds
legalize those same business
interests can immediately pivot
and go back to their tribal
communities and set up shop
but your concerns are very well
founded and I as you know I I
respect you and and that far you
and I'm I'm glad that you're
raising these issues because
they need to be race and they
need to be debated in the need
to be spoken to.
thank you very much gentleman
and Mr speaker and gentleman I
appreciate your your your
comments back at the same time
yet for all the reasons that I I
stated earlier the unintended
consequences the the unknowns
that you know if if this is
already on control federal
substance schedule one substance
and and I would have not have
these questions and I think it
would be kind of like okay well
thank you for this in the bill
we're fine that's that's
continue for but the fact that
we were working off of a perhaps
and date of the fits me take it
off the schedule one controlled
substance list is kind of an
unknown and and for me that's
that's too much of a chance for
for for me to take on behalf of
the constituents that I
represent simply because again
not only just on a governmental
level but on a personal
individual tribal level the
perspectives that that I should
do or do not have prophetical
could be soon to come in when
this bill passes if this bill
passes because at that point in
time then then they will allow
life to play out and see what
happens and and for me as a
representative of of.
Tribal American New Mexico I I I
can't I I can't take that chance
at this point and perhaps
you know if if there are things
to be worked out that could be a
true focus of that and so Mr
speaker and gentleman I
appreciate the conversation this
evening I appreciate your again
your your diligence and your and
your focus on this matter but
respectfully of the reason that
stated earlier I will not be
able to support your bills so
thank you very much Mr speaker
and gentleman.
Thank you there is further
debate the gentleman from San
Juan Representative Montoya
thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from Bernalillo yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
someone.
to.
Of the question that uh
representative Lente brought to
I understand with local
police said.
Forces across the state there
there the the idea of small
quantities that are of
possession of not being pursued
This is a Representative does
have I think it's a real concern
with what tribal law in addition
different try is and then the
idea of the federal lands I
think those are concerns and I
think it is right to be
concerned
And and.
I just wanted to ask additional
questions triangles with quick
estimate several questions on
quickly.
this
is.
So rising decriminalizing.
And it's kind of out of.
The things that was presented
with.
economic benefits in New Mexico
and and it appears that that
benefit from an economic
standpoint it is not for it it
was.
so if inform.
Is going to.
Just from out of state and she
was going to population in
Mexico
School is is.
to
Nation and.
This disposable income
this
I was wondering why as soon
financial benefit coming because
of the folks who are purchasing.
Purchasing other items food
clothing.
Entertainment and is like this
would just be.
A priority and changing to.
to
One of the cells instead of four
purchases instead of the some of
the other things so control.
The actual benefit and economic
impact will be to the economy in
New Mexico.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman that that's a great
question and and it's a question
that came up in our in our
previous committee
and it's a question that came up
I believe the last time we were
on the floor
So the the the economic impact
of this it is very similar thing
FIR certainly takes a very
conservative approaches as it
should.
there have been other economic
analyses presented there is one
that was done by
believe it was Dr Kelly
o'donnell who many of you
probably know
she she's one of New Mexico's
top economist and we the go to
for a lot of this work and that
was presented to the rural and
economic development contract
committee and I think it was
also presented to revenue
segmentation Tax Policy
Committee
of what those numbers were much
much higher than McAfee FY are
if you were offered to feed four
hundred million dollars in sales
And
a big part of that assumption
was that about forty to forty
two percent would actually be
dollars coming from out of state
particular needs Texas
I believe that analyses mailed
also counted there is owner
because at the time Arizona had
individualized but still a very
very large amounts of that of
those dollars came from out of
state of Arizona's you know did
legalize in the November
election and and then take up
the I guess the ballot
initiative called on them to to
to get the program off the
ground almost immediately which
they did
Colorado course already did
Oklahoma has medical I believe I
don't think Utah has anything
taxes doesn't Texas obviously I
think you would be the biggest
you know the the the the biggest
cash cow is you know we talk
about the economics both in the
southeast part of the state and
then also near the end process
crucis area in terms of the
dollars that are you know in
state dollars in the disposable
income you have a you have an
excellent point I mean I think
you know all of us to make
choices every day so how we
spend their disposable income
right and I I I can give an
example you know we we we eat
out way too much you know we the
roots and R. dash and whatever
other options out there for
deliver food to us from local
restaurants way too much that's
where our disposable income goes
instance right private vendetta
responsible income went to movie
theaters there's a great movie
theater in town where you can
buy a beer local beer you could
food and catch a flick that was
our family date night once a
week you know and now we have to
make a choice right they're not
there anymore so now we have to
transition and we do what we do
now
you know prior to the pandemic
you know we would we would
frequent our favorite
microbreweries in in my district
kitchen till family games you
know lower fuel monopoly or not
the idea or whatever and spend
an afternoon right people make
choices all the time and I
suspect that people who will
make choices once these
industries comes to be but you
know I I I have high hopes no
pun intended high hopes and
expectations that the reports
that we've seen are actually
true and accurate and that a lot
of this when you come in from
out of state he will be simply
recycling money internally but
money from out of state coming
in
Ashley Mr speaker and gentleman
you know just anecdotally again
prior to pandemic whenever I
would go to a thousand servers
you know had over angel fire Red
River you know the number of
Texas plates that are there
during ask.
Pieces instance astonishing to
me
I see dollar signs you know once
we legalize this industry and
that industry becomes part of
the hospitality industry that
helps prop up a lot of the
stones so you know I think large
mechanism comprise state and you
know local New Mexicans will
make the choices that they make
every day with their disposable
income.
Mr speaker and gentleman I.
Is really just a bit of
question is that throughout all
of this has has bothered me
because the the numbers I I
F. R. seven six hundred twenty
five thousand
it was Hey I'm I'm not exactly
sure that we're missing.
Because I think we're going to
this is people purchasing that
instead of purchasing something
else and so I I at least with
Mexico I don't see this as a big
benefit
Another question here and I I I
couldn't find this document but
is prohibition as to where
someone has been smoking.
The marijuana cigarette.
If you are.
Public place unable to do that
on the street in a park.
If any restriction is there as
far as to smoking and in public
places.
Mr speaker and and gentlemen
the bill allows for
private consumption spaces
within
within a licensed premise right
so if you're on one of these
vertically integrated licenses
that house you do everything
from production manufacturing to
to to retail sales of those
operations can have
a consumption springs
you know thank you copy shop if
you will
public smoking is to prohibited
and it's approachable by fifty
dollar fine you cannot smoke in
public.
No I I that I can find it and
that's why I asked that
question.
once Senator.
Descriptions of the.
On drugs and how drugs was.
so racist and ever
that the I mean there was a
good.
Five minutes at least of
conversation they're about
housing
Was
handled as a as an effort to
tune proshare a racist narrative
so when was this questions kind
of tongue in cheek but Mr
speaker and gentleman.
as Mexico is the cultural Mexico
racist against Mexicans.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
that's a great question
that you asked it yes racism
exists everywhere racism racism
is based on a system of white
supremacy Mexico is doing all
was conquered land by the
Spaniards the Spaniards for you
know came from Spain into rural
rural
acts
killed and raped and maimed and
tortured and to this day
that
not only not only Mexico but any
other country that has built a
cold with with with
with with these aspects of
colonialism including Africa and
other places continue to move
with it you know New Mexico when
I was younger you know that
there is a saying and it's a
terrible saying but you know if
if
if if somebody married to
somebody who was later color
Mexican they would say requested
US improve the race
and I cannot tell you right now
that I think back when I was
little kid hearing those things
in our neighborhood and and just
how painful that is so yes yes
racism exists in more places
than we think in New Mexico
certainly no
no no exception you know when it
comes to the war on drugs and
when it comes to what you heard
of the opening from from some of
the members of the war on drugs
was rooted in that review system
hi mange I mentioned above kind
but you'll read chasing
Strittmatter if you can see with
the but I.
but it is a fantastic book Mr
speaker and gentleman that gives
you that information I give you
that very painful history of
over the war on drugs again and
end and they're and they're
these pictures in here that the
other cartoons
newspaper cartoons from back to
back you know sixty seven years
ago
where they had is very racist
cartoons of you know these these
young kids smoking the the the
the Mexican money Honda you know
and and they were they were
designed to to to to freak you
out you know if you need to nine
one somewhere and you have never
met in Mexico he was designed to
scare you right there there was
a there is a a study that was
done
not a study buddy the survey
that was conducted by the FBI is
they were sort of starting to
designed some of these laws
and they put out a call to all
these doctors about cannabis and
whether or not it was that for
you and and and I don't out of
all the survey doctors only one
came back and said yes this
makes you go crazy including the
Mexican that needs
it's it's a it's a fantastic
question and I wish I I wish we
had another bill to debate race
upon because we would have a
fantastic conversation yes yes
the the the country of Mexico in
the country.
in the countries of Africa and
and and and the state of New
Mexico over a gruesome feeling
those five hundred plus years of
of of another group of people
coming in and saying you're not
worth it.
You're less than us some of you
don't deserve to live so we will
kill you others three fifths of
what I'm bored so you will work
for me for free for seven or
eight generations.
and we're still dealing with
those issues Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Right.
Thank you Mr chairman I actually
appreciate the answer
for years I've been told because
minority report of a minority
group I can not be racist and
and as I said I have not heard
some of the things that I've
heard
from people that I've been
around so actually appreciate
the fact Mr speaker and
gentleman from the.
Discussion of race and whether
or not
minority group can be racist
that's that's always been in
that's always been a downplayed
and so I I guess are specific to
the question.
This is.
Drugs New Mexico based on racism
because as of yet
the cultural Mexico has not
legalized.
One.
It is still against the law in
Mexico and those laws were put
in place in the nineteen
twenties so that's that's a long
time after
the colonization took place
there and so the.
That's a that that racism would
be behind Mexico's trouble as is
is something that will be vetted
incredulous to hear.
A different question.
This is a subjective I hurdles
that campus is not addictive.
Answer I just want to.
That I sat on the side
psychiatric times and it says
that.
One is less addictive if you're
over twenty five years old.
But that.
Act
and today that that cannabis is
not addictive and so I'm just
wondering where you are.
That or or.
the description that cannabis is
not addictive.
I mean psychiatric times is not
known as being a right leaning.
organization so I was trying to
find out.
We're getting these talking
points that cannabis is not at
all indicative.
Yeah that's a that's a fantastic
question gentleman from some
point
before I answer that one let me
backtrack a little bit or not
backtrack but let me step back
from minutes and just remind
myself and for the body you know
racism is about power ultimately
and again you know racism I will
be with us until we decide that
we no longer want to and then
one day we'll get there and not
just our country but other
countries around the world
to your second point about the
war on drugs you know we I think
we I think we can all agree that
American foreign policy dictates
a lot of what other countries do
and and New Mexico there's a
saying
you know.
This is on being so far from god
but so close the United States
because so much of our policy
dictates how they run their
country quite frankly that's
probably why I'm here right now
is immensely toward building on
cannabis because my family
decided to leave because of the
power structure in making calls
that was very presses against
people like us but then also
because of the domestic policy
that Mexico implemented and
continues to implement the have
the United States that forces
people like my family needs to
leave
so you know twenty get that out
for the for the record and for
those watching at home
is cannabis of the building you
know I I think that I think you
can certainly develop a
dependency I think some people
in on a case by case basis might
develop an addiction but I think
the point that would be made
over and over again at the
beginning of this debate was
that
Canada is is certainly not
nearly as dangerous as some of
the other things that we
regulate and tax and legalized
alcohol being one of and you
know we students for just a few
days ago trying to fix actually
a bill that you and I care
together with with a couple of
our other members trying to
modernize these these liquor
license system I to ensure that
more businesses have the ability
to get into the base but as an
economic development tool but
also just as a matter of
fairness right
this substance that we hope we
will legalize this year is a lot
less addictive than the
substance that we chose to
expand here a few days ago
you know again children and
young people should not be using
this or any other substance
although if my sixteen year old
seventeen year old ever decided
to use anything over that rather
than views.
Making the added tax seed
cannabis then drink a bottle of
Scotch I'm a lot more freedom
the Scotch and I'm definitely a
lot more freedom the tobacco
and I am on campus.
Thanks for that Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Transition once again not a
right leaning organization the
National Institute on drug abuse
states that.
Thirty percent of those.
On may have some marijuana use
disorder conscience the talking
about addiction there it says
here that.
Particularly people under twenty
five years of age
and that the problems with the
developing lined.
Is
things memory loss and.
And and I have I was just
running out of time Mr speaker.
But I wanted to ask about our
another section of very.
That has not been discussed at
all this evening and that is
the social justice provisions in
this bill
so I understand.
Mr speaker and gentleman that.
Portion of this bill is it is a
completely different section of
of the New Mexico code.
The criminal justice section.
Straw speaker and gentleman.
I understand that you
would.
Go back retroactively and
our.
It's a sentence for a drug
related crime.
L. and the records will be
expunged.
and SO was signed because that's
not the question I understand
that's in the bill.
Find.
Was jailed for.
Trafficking.
Sampling the.
cannabis previously to a minor.
Now if someone worked.
Mexico law.
Happen.
yes.
Sell black market.
Purchase it legally and then
turn around and sell it as if
they were the producer of it.
And.
Happen the second part of this
question what would happen if
someone who purchased the
recreational marijuana.
Medical marijuana whatever and
have possession and sold it to a
minor what happened.
We're going to place after.
Already expunged.
the records of folks may have
done this exact same thing.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I I
kind of lost you there a couple
of times into the refreezing of
your of your question can you
can you rephrase that for me
please.
Yes I'm just get to the end of
the question.
For what happened this.
were to.
Get caught selling on the black
market
One.
And what would happen if there
were to also.
So that product to.
Minor are the penalties.
they well first of all Mr
speaker and gentleman the would
be breaking the law the
penalties are gonna depend on
the amounts and circumstances
you know we're in a in a school
or in a you know I'm sure
there's a bunch of different
other contexts there that would
apply but it would be legal we
would be legal for that person
to do that.
The gentleman
expands.
Out of jail for essentially.
I'm doing that now.
Released from jail and
expansion the record for.
The exact same that would still.
After this bill would be passed.
Mr speaker and gentleman this
bill only would expand to
records of people committed
crimes that are now meeting
legal by this legislation this
legislation does not allow for
the sale of cannabis to under
age people.
Just.
Or to have sold
cannabis previously is that not
one if they account for that and
they were sending some sort of
sentence for that or they have
that in their past record.
would it would not those folks
be I have a record expunged.
Mr speaker you know then if that
person sold two grams of
cannabis to another individual
over the age of twenty one that
record would be expunged now
under this bill but if that
person sold to grams of cannabis
to a seventeen year old the
record would not be expunged.
Some.
I just want to sell on the black
market.
Thanks at the exact same
parameters insisted discussed.
Happened to the
black market so if they were
over twenty one is that now not
illegal is that black market
Senator now legal.
we know that illicit market so
as not legal because that person
is operating outside of what is
specified for in this bill they
don't have a license they're not
in compliance are breaking the
law I'd be like me selling
Scott chair for dinner thank you
laugh out of my garage I can't
do that it's against the law.
This
exactly what my point is.
I expansion the record of
someone who sold on the black
market is expanding.
To sell on the black market.
We explained the records and
this person has done this
multiple times and is serving
for that.
To be caught selling on the
black market.
The first offense that makes
sense to me I would have that
provision
of this legislation can explain.
One to listen.
An expert.
For the exact same thing that
would be.
Legislation in place.
Mr speaker development if if
you're convicted of the cannabis
related crime.
for a few years ago ten years
ago.
that is now.
Maybe Neagle through the
cannabis regulation act your
record will be expunged however.
that means that if if you again
if you sold cannabis to somebody
in your age for example that may
be able to do this in your
records are expunged if you.
Sold cannabis again to simple to
a twenty five year old the
twenty five year old buddy
and sold in Canada is ten years
ago and was illegal and it's on
your record
this bill would expunge that
record if that same person
commits the same crime again
they're breaking the law now to
your question why would I
expunge the record of that
person.
Knowing that they committed the
same crime ten years later I
mean I I I I I can't you know
I'm not a fortune teller
McGuiness I get a legislative
based on what people are you
know might do I do think though
that
you know as as utilizes industry
I do think that
if that twenty five year old who
sold sold a little pot to twenty
five year old buddy
chances are that now they would
probably be able to enter the
market assuming they're a good
person assuming they're not you
know a hardcore criminal or you
know some sort of you know
violent offender or federal law
breakers something like that
they would be able to to to do
it legally so you know again
back to my example if if I wanna
sell thank you live better get
out of the car license
but if I don't get that because
licensing and selling it and
breaking the law and and now
will be punished accordingly and
the same thing in this example.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
thanks for the answer but it
doesn't to make logical sense to
expunge the record.
And then if someone does the
same thing it would be
considered a first offense
problem probably.
We're really reducing
Expanding something that would
still be a crime today that that
does not make sense.
Just to the point on selling to
minors.
That.
You for selling to minors
selling.
Minors in style less than what
it would be if you were to be
caught selling alcohol to minors
and I think that's a discount so
that should be fixed as well
I I.
But I need to move forward.
as this is
Mr speaker and gentleman
Representative Crowder
put forward but it had and there
in.
approved a provision that.
Would have captured
but styles as well as
recreational sales.
That we have now has taken that
out and then Mr speaker and
gentleman I'd like to.
has floor amendment one to.
House health committee
substitute for house bill twelve
as amended.
Mr speaker.
Tensions.
Four point four.
This is a second second
amendment Mr speaker engine.
His name and the madam clerk is
the management okay the
amendment has been passed out.
How will check to do is give us
one minute to make sure that it
is on the website.
Zoom website.
Gentleman the German currency is
expressing some sort of the
motion with his hands.
I can't quite tell Mr speaker I
think he's trying to fly.
That's not the kind of high they
were talking about gentleman.
Mr speaker.
The present a box on your desk
is as acts I think.
Two two zero one eight four
point four.
Explain it again shortly please
explain your amendment thank you
Mr speaker this will allow local
jurisdictions to be able to
restrict the sale of
recreational marijuana in their
jurisdictions it would not do
anything to change whether or
not the
whether or not marijuana for
recreational purposes would be
in those jurisdictions chest the
sale of recreational marijuana
would be affected with this
ammendment.
Sure how much debate we need to
have on this this is something
that was debated to extend
earlier and then that was called
back because it internally
affected medical marijuana as
well as recreational marijuana
okay gentleman we are at the end
of the debate so I'm just going
to go to the gentleman from
Bernalillo to ask him if this is
a friendly amendment and to tell
us why it is or is not.
Mr speaker thank you seventy and
again respectfully this is not
the friendly amendment Mr
speaker and and the gentleman
you know I think I think the the
the the the core of the problem
remains
Two versions of this bill ago
we took great care to ensure
that the local communities could
remain
you know in charge of of of of
of an opt out mechanism if
feeding want to to have
that activity having in their in
their community and and and the
way I remember structuring that
section that one here we allowed
locals to opt out of everything
I think except position I think
that's what that's sort of where
we we we left it but you know I
think ultimately after listening
to to law enforcement and and I
recognize Mr speaker and
gentleman from someone I
recognize that you know law
enforcement is very diverse we
know that you know we've seen in
a number of different issues
where we've dealt with I was not
here in our legislature each
county sheriff who have their
own opinion each of local police
department will have their own
opinions and often times more
often than not the the online
and they're in agreement often
times they don't this is
something that was explicitly
told him
by and I believe this was for
the governors of fourteen group
I remember correctly there
members of law enforcement are
working.
and we were told time and time
again and and you know law
enforcement has has a few
concerns here and I'm not saying
this is our only one by any
means this was one of the ones
of the state if you legalize
adult use of cannabis you can
not.
The checker board approach to
legalization it's going to be an
enforcement nightmare for us
especially for those for those
communities are cash strapped in
that particular bill two years
ago if you opted out you
couldn't tap into the tax
revenue right and so you're
gonna have to use apartments
that are not benefiting from
that tax revenue knowing for
seeing cannabis laws in their
own in their own counties so at
the request of law enforcement
you know we decided to take out
that prohibition or that low or
that opt out mechanism other
states that have been mentioned
here one of them that was
mentioned a few times Mr speaker
and gentleman from San Juan I
was a state of California I was
in California a couple years ago
and I had a meeting with a
gentleman who had transitioned
from a medical cannabis producer
to to adult use cannabis
producer and he said the same
thing he said the biggest
mistake made here other than the
tax cuts pretty I was to allow
local opt out it's created a
nightmare it's actually fit into
the blue orchid because counties
that are that are clinically
drawing now have a sort of micro
scale of this market that takes
place in those counties
I I respect the intent of the
amendment
I I I appreciate what you're
trying to do
to the gentleman from curry I
really really appreciate you.
Stepping back a couple hours ago
with your amendment to get re
written to ensure that medical
cannabis patients you know they
course plan to leave
you know follow heartened by
this I really really do
appreciate that but I think that
if we adopt this amendment and
if this bill is is passed and
signed with the local opt out
mechanism I think we are going
to give to regret it
I think that local governments
through our bill have every
ability to regulate these
industries are just strictly as
they want to we have here in
this bill the ability for local
governments use our local zoning
codes to restrict these
activities to very specific
parts of their town or the city.
the us to you for example
the micro breweries you know you
can't have microbreweries
anywhere they're restricted to
these industrial areas in many
cases here they brought life
back to those industries areas
that maybe had long been
forgotten and and and divested
from
Our local government also allows
for specific activities to take
place for example taprooms right
taprooms can exist in a strip
mall somewhere in a commercial
area of but zoning code in my
city and probably most of years
doesn't allow for commercial
activities to happen in
residential areas for example
they definitely don't allow for.
Miter heavy manufacturing to
happen in in the in residential
areas for commercial areas I
believe that we have enough
protections for the locals
to be able to.
NABBA to to be able to regulate
these folks in a way that their
communities and the values of
the communities see fit but I
think that by allowing for opt
out you're gonna get two or
three counties that again opt
out is going to create a huge
headache for those communities
is going to create a headache
for law enforcement and so for
all those reasons Mr speaker and
gentleman who someone again I
very respectfully because I
respect the intent of this
respectfully will disagreement
in and and I will call this an
unfriendly amendment.
Gentleman from Bernalillo.
