veterans or members of gold star
families with the use process
for unlimited entry to state
parks or other recreation areas
operated by the state parks
division of EM and our the.
The free access to New Mexico
state parks is a small way to
think America's veterans and
gold star families for their
support of our country and to
encourage them to explore
recreational opportunities on
our public lands and waters.
Our that's all I got a stand for
questions Mr chair.

I.
Madam vice chair
thank you my hand my little
regular hand down here is not
been working thank you Mr chair
I do you know
it goes without saying that this
is an incredibly important bill
I would have thought that we
would have done this a long time
ago speaking from one of those
families that
comes from a military family and
background
and honors veterans
to the team I wholeheartedly
support this and you are correct
Representative then this this is
a this is a fairly easy only
because it's the moral thing to
do and it's the right thing to
do so I appreciate you bringing
it forward along with all of the
co sponsors on this bill and
wait past time.
Thank you thank you madam I
share.
This race.
Representative allows us.
I will question.
Mr chair why haven't we done
this before at the introduces
bill before because so wonderful
bill it's it's I'm just teasing
you.
Mr chair usually I have a
question so I thought all have
to make into a question but
anyway I just wanted to thank
Sanchez is a wonderful bill it's
a well deserved
Given to our veterans and and so
I'm very very happy to support
this bill god bless.
Thank you.
Anyone else.
Mr Chairman can I make a motion
to pass you should get.
And I can accept that hello.
And I have a motion from
Representative black in the
second Representative the last
US.
I am before I go to the lower
day just have the.
That was.
I really love the meal before a
it was introduced.
Wondering why we didn't lose.
The military that are serving in
the state of New Mexico and this
will.
So what I'm drafting a to a
floor amendment for this to
handle the process for and for
requesting an annual pass I
would love to add that to the
amendment sport do another
amendment because I agree with
you
I I had a drafted for this
committee but didn't do it in
time for the twenty four hours.
That has actually both of those
in that.
Next it's not it's a single
referral there's.
Yes it's going straight to the
floor to the floor so it'll have
to be a floor amendment
yes some I don't know there
when you're drafters.
Thank you thank you basically
thank you very assigned to the
state of New Mexico.
So we don't have that much
confusion I think the this is
making a really extremely
wonderful meal and will help
those who are in the the ratings
that we're looking for.
You know.
We Fund so hundred and I'm gonna
space for that would do
Do we understand where we're
going to incomes in New Mexico.
And the what things is that
we're just not far away from
being green under score card as
far as DOT is concerned nineteen
this would help with some of
course.
What is the other bills and I'm
working on I'm basically year
for that purpose.
What will I think that's a good
idea and I will definitely.
We'll see the amendment is
somehow and.
One thing that the industry was
here I am on this my thirteenth
year and this is the first time
that I've ever lived closely of
with the definition of a veteran
was.
The so when people ask me now I
can tell of echo.
In
first of all I was thinking to
myself will just wouldn't cover
somebody like myself will serve
ninety months active duty.
J. was only shown nineteen
months active duty but I didn't
get money this.
Well I had.
Basically served six years.
I and I had to have confused was
in fact the research until I got
to the six year period and then
they sent me my discharge what
I'm seeing the.
And I see it was exemption for
and assigned to duty for a
maximum of six continues years
so that covers a somebody that
is certain.
Separated from the military when
they're assigned all the way up
to the end of the six year so
with that
I don't have any other
questions.
Question.
No.
Okay so that the secretary if
you would call the roll please.
I think we need to let the
opposition to the motion.
Hello everyone present in the
affirmative how does that.
With.
Thank you Mr chair.
Everybody was Raz thank you Mr
plus thank you.
