from the one teacher that we
have rented and then uh.
Teacher housing was not included
in our last bond. We will be
going up, I believe, next year.
on council's actually in the
room.
And, uh, that may be something
that we look at next time.
But again, our bond capacity has
been small enough that we've
needed to use that for athletic
facilities and classroom
facilities and so we have not.
Move forward in that direction
in the past. Operational funds
will not be used for this
project either.
And I was asked to include our
audit.
Findings and summary, so that is
on the last page.
That is all that I have, have
any questions for us?
Hey
Well, thank you for your
presentation. As you know, we
have a.
Ilot housing program going on in
your.
participating in that.
need to do that. It's been.
Difficult implementing it with
the need so great.
But uh again, thank you for
coming forward so I would open
it up for questions from
counsel.
Le
presentation
You have
Last testaments, but you went
for these 5 units.
We're, we've estimated it'll
take about 115,000 to.
And stall, purchase and install.
Those are preliminary quotes.
I'm not sure if the quote
included air conditioning and
that I went and visited another
company while I was off on um
voting day, I stopped by
solitaire and Deming to to get
quotes from them and they said
there.
Theirs did not at that price
include air conditioning. So I
need to make sure what we
received from the other
companies in Las Cruces did
include that. So, um, Hatch
Valley is a very warm place and
if our teachers are living there
all year, we need to provide air
conditioning.
The preliminary, we're looking
at about 100 or 5,025,000.
But again, there may be hidden
costs that I'm unaware of.
So we are getting official
quotes now.
What level of home are you?
He's like
Tapes and texture.

Is it like old kind of thinking

And of the newer just
Modular built off site, but
Located like, you know, slab.
For example,
Like, what are you, the quotes
that I've received have been.
Uh, manufactured homes and more
like a, a mobile home where it's
purchased and then delivered. So
it would be completely put
together before it arrives.
And I believe we were looking at
ground set, putting them on
concrete.

Thank you, Mr. Chair, just a
couple of questions. Um, how
many teachers do you have?
How many teachers do you have
altogether?
District.
So 43% of them commute out of
district.
That's a lot.
In, uh, he joined us.
Any questions?
I'm sorry for being late. I was
across the street.
Very traumatic.
Um, I
I, I would encourage you to
You look into um
More substantial.
They are more expensive.
Dear
Significantly
Robust instruction.
I would, I would, I would
Lisa.
Consider that
OK.
It's working. Uh, thank you. So
I have a, so just kind of to
reiterate, so you mentioned that
you're gonna be using some of
the existing infrastructure
that's already there, such as
sewer, water, so.
It's already in place, so a
matter of just tying in to
what's there, correct?
We are hoping that that's all it
will take. We did put a buffer
in our original ask for that
we've received quotes from our
electrician, we've used many
times and then a plumbing
company that we've used many
times to, to get preliminary
idea because we were not sure
what it would take to actually
tie them in.
Yeah, what other just just the
comic and uh something that's
often, you know, talked about,
you know, in this committee is,
you know, teacher housing as far
as like as your housing
available and, you know,
surrounding communities, you
know, what does that look like?
But, you know, you mentioned
something that I think is in
this whole thing is community.
You know, having teachers, you
know, in the school district to
be able to support not only the
community but the the the the
students, you know, to, to be a
part of that, so I agree with
you 100% on that and uh I, I, I,
I think, you know, through this
process is, is definitely
something that we need to
consider. It's about community
having the teachers engaged and
having them a part of the
community, so thank you for, for
saying that because I agree with
you.
No, 100%.
Thank you, chair. Um, can you
say more about how you arrived
at 5 units. Is it just capacity
on your land, given that you
have 5 folks that may be on the
waiting list.
Well, well, we have, um, open
positions every year and we
currently have 2 unfilled
special education positions,
which
It is a big problem for us, and
we have been recruiting. It's
hard to steal a special
education teacher from another
district as well.
And at this point in the year,
it's very difficult, so we're
hoping that teacher housing
would allow them to come into
the district and then stay
because they've become a part of
the community. Um, but we do
have, um, 5 teachers on the list
to vacancy, so that's a total of
7, so 5 doesn't even cover the
initial need that we have.
That's what we can see initially
for spots that are, should be
quickly tied in to the current
infrastructure. We have other
that if this, this goes well in
the future years we could look
at using our bond and passing a
bond for teacher housing to
more.
housing. I can say that.
vision.
We had a big, much bigger vision
and uh but we also know that
we've got to take steps toward
that, right?
And so when I arrived in in the
Hatch Valley in 2019.
school board members, that was
one of their visions is how can
we address, you know, housing
and the need for housing, you
know.
But it's, it's really easy to
say, well, we want people to be
part of the community, but when
there's.
Uh, housing that's not available
or that it's overpriced to a
point that um that we can't
afford it or people can't afford
it. It makes it really, really
difficult. But the, the vision
was to use, you know, the
location, and we've got lots of
land in that area, so it, it's,
it's, um, it's something that we
said, OK, well this will be like
phase one.
You know, if, if we could get,
if we could get started and get
moving in that direction, you
know, and
in
Um
years in the upcoming years,
maybe look at it and adding
another 1 or 2 every year until
we have a small little
community.
That
uh teacher-based, family base um
that.
Then become part of the the.
Community and benefits the
district because they bring
their kids with them, right? And
so we saw a decrease the so
mentioned the flood back in
2006766, um, there was a
decrease in enrollment after
that, and, uh, as Miss Hoff had
said, you know, people left and
never came back. And so, and
part of it is, you know, coming
back to there's just we just
have a lack of housing.
And so, um, and so it's one of
those things where we're trying
to build capacity within our
district trying to bring
families back trying to bring
students back because um I know
we have other superintendents
here and other uh districts that
are uh uh represented today, but
Hatch Valley is, is we're the
tops.
And, uh, and we want our kids.
We want our kids to come to our
district and, and experience
what we have to offer.
And so, it, it is, it is part of
a much bigger vision.
chair Miss off it,
superintendent, thank you for
that answer and thank you for
your presentation. Um, may I add
something to that?
We have many of our um
uncertified.
Staff
Currently taking classes to be
teachers and live with their
parents. And so as they become
adults, there's no housing for
them. So the, the need will
continue to grow, as are other
staff become adults and, you
know, on their own. Right now
they can't move out of their
parents' houses. So, but they
want to stay in the valley.
And
We've got uh
And we've been trying to grow
our own.
for years, so we've taken
advantage of the different
programs that uh PED has pushed
out such as the fellowship and
fellowships and.
And and things like that, but
you know, we've also got our Ed
Rising program. So we're trying
to even get our, our high school
kids, you know, to really think
about going into education and
so we're, we're doing everything
we can to, to address, you know,
um, the.
have with with
teachers, this would just be
another part of that plan.
Um
You've mentioned the about the
vision that the board board had.
I'd like to hear from board
members. Board member Grey.
Or uh Montes.
We'll try to tackle that one,
It's all natural disasters, you
know, everybody's around the
state has seen some of that, but
uh.
After 2006, um,
Whatever housing market we had.
All that just
Disappeared and there hasn't
been much growth.
And part of that plan, even with
the previous administration was
Let's try to get together. Let's
try to get some housing done.
this and that and stuff, but
that never came to fruition, so.
We have these wonderful people.
Working for the district.
They're spearheading this plan
and and it it makes sense for
all of us.
Especially when it comes down to
who we serve, and that is our
children.
Oh
Open
Hoping for the best.
Thank you, Chris.
Yeah
Um
at that.
Um, there was a house that went
up for sale.
gone in a day.
One day.
And that's it, and it was bought
by a family member.
So it's not
You know, we need
More housing
Our little district we have one
grocery store.
That's it. One gas station.
And it runs out of gas all the
time.
So these poor teachers,
there
they come it runs out of gas all
the time. They're coming in.
to have these quality teachers
and we need to be able to keep
them.
We, we, we, sometimes we get
them.
But we can't keep them.
Because of the transportation or
their kids being in a different
district.
So we need to have that option.
So that we can retain.
good teacher.
Um, an educators.
And that's the only way that our
kids are going to be successful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for making the trip as
well. You didn't bring any chili
with you, did you?
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I know, I
know we've got a lot of
presentation.
um
I had a couple, I guess,
questions to follow up with. We
don't have to talk about it too
much here or with staff.
Um, you mentioned that you, you
didn't include this in your last
bond.
Election
Now you're looking specifically
at your teacher.
Here.
Support your local match. Do you
have capacity in that, in that
last bond issued to support this
like
I, I, I, I tend to agree that,
um, I think the mobile home
pieces, you know, we've we've
encouraged people to be very
efficient with it, or to find.
You know, uh, affordable homes.
Obviously, we don't want people
splurging on.
Mansions necessarily, but I
think there's also a
piece about this where we want
teachers to feel valued, feel
like this is a home for them
too.
Um
So I guess I'm just curious
about like overall capacity in
the district and whether or not
you have additional funds to
support a larger match if you on
something that.
Expensive or
Um
If you've thought about that at
all, and again, we don't
necessarily have to talk about
it here, but I think it's
important that
Um
That you're not just going out
and buying the cheapest thing
you can.
can afford right now. And I know
you're, I'm, I'm seeing nodding
that that's not what you're
trying to do, but I also want to
make sure that
That whatever that, that thing
that you land on.
It lasts and that teachers
actually want to stay in it end
up spending something that you
don't want to anyway.
For
Thinking about
City within.
Now, Mr. Senna, one of the
things that um
Um
You asked about our
family, you know, I wasn't
included and and um and.
Quite honestly, we've had so
many projects and um.
If you looked at uh at our
facility master plan.
strut 4 years back now.
You'll see that we've completed
about 90% of it.
95% of it. So we've been
very, very intentional about.
um, looking at our facilities
master plan, making sure that
we're addressing all those
different pieces. This is where
we're kind of at the end of, of
the plan where now we're looking
at teachers and so as I stated,
it is part of, of a bigger plan
that we've been very, very
intentional about making
improvements and upgrades to the
district, uh, that had that we
just didn't have the opportunity
to do previously.
And so we've been in, in a
sense, playing catch up.
So, but we're there, we're we're
moving in that direction and
this is where we're at. Very
good.
Anyone else?
Now thank you for coming. Uh
thank you for bringing your
team.
Superintendent and
Of course, uh, you'll be working
with staff as we move forward on
this project and we can, we can
see you again.
Thank you. Thank you.
Mr. Chair and members, uh, next
up we have Corona Public schools
also requesting future housing.
Units, um, so I will introduce,
uh, Superintendent Kirk Cl.
And to make sure the financial
guys here, so.
Thank you Mr. um,
thank you for having me speak
today and present on the teacher
housing needs at Corona Public
schools. I have Nicholas Kane
from Stifel Financial Advisors
who's our district financial
advisor as part of our planning
and you're going to hear a lot
of things that Mr. Chavez echoed
that I'm gonna echo Corona.
Um
First, uh, Corona, as you know,
is, is a small rural district in
northern Lincoln County. We're
about 2 hours away from the next
largest metropolitan area that
we can get access to.
We are very similar to hatch in
the ways that we have one gas
station and 11, it's not even in
all. We have a small mini market
and general market that serves
our entire community.
Um
Currently, we have the potential
of 3 to 5.
Teacher retirements in the next
2 years.
After the two I've already
received for this year.
So that means I have a potential
of 7 teacher openings.
In my district within the next 3
years.
With that in mind, our housing
situation is desperate because
our original units are put in
with FEMA units in the 1960s.
So they are over 60 years old.
District in the late 90s and
early 2000s, renovated all five
of those units put in roughly
about $350,000 at that time to
make them last as long as I have
right now.
So right now, our housing
situation is past the point of
usable use.
I went through a process when I
came on board in Corona last
year in October, working with
Mr. Kane and Stifel and
associates, as well as my board
to make a determination a cost
evaluation of what our current
teacher units are, are doing to
us.
I just did one unit in my first
year and and to bring it up to
code, we currently have one
condemned unit. We were looking
at trying to bring up to speed.
Um, and it was initially a
$75,000 quote and they paid
$50,000 for the house back in
the 1960s, but we've maintained
that facilities very well and
we're at the point now we're in
crisis mode because much like
rural New Mexico, we had 3
properties on the
books when I wrote this
proposal, one at $450,000 which
is a large ranch north of town
and then another one at 1.1
million and another one at
650,000. Well, the $650,000.01
went off the market last week
and 2 more came on their 1.7 and
1.6. We are in a primarily
ranching area, so the large
properties is used for farming
and we're also in the Lincoln
Forest, so we do not have access
to a lot of land in that area
where we could build. So we're
very limited in our options.
Unfortunately for our district,
we do have 5 current lots, and
we do own land north of our
current high school complex and
school complex.
That is being used and
considered for other uses
because next year we'll be
coming back as part of our
master facility planning with
North Star LLC is looking at
upgrading our facilities and
looking at going for a new uh
combined school, elementary, K
through 12.
With pre-K in it.
Because that building was last
built in 1962.
And we maintain the maintenance
and we've done the cost
evaluations of the maintenance
and we did a bond.
Last year for providing juices
that steeple was involved in.
And we passed it for $995,000.
The first time we went to PSFA
for any type of bonding capacity
for our district and we're
working very closely with Steel
to make sure our bonding
capacity can meet the needs of
teacher housing as well as our.
needs with new classrooms and
buildings and so forth.
So this has been very strategic
to the board. I've only been at
Corona for a year, but the first
thing the board told me when I
came on board is we need to
address this issue. So we made
it a priority, started doing the
facility evaluations and
everything else, so I worked
with two general contractors.
That are very familiar with the
modular housing market in our
part of the state, they're
actually working right now with
the Mexico State University
because they have a lab facility
in my district located out, so I
was directed by uh the director
of those facilities to contacted
two contractors and we worked
with them very closely. So we've
talked with both of them and we
are looking at putting a
pre-manufactured modular hosing
complexes on the current line
that we have in condemned
facility.
There's enough space. It is a
large lot. If you could look at
the map that is on page 43. If
you look at that map in the
back.
Those 5 lots that are circled
are about 1 mile south of the
school complex. So it's very
close in proximity if any of you
guys have been to Corona, which
I know Mr. Yan has, uh, you're
not more than a five-minute walk
from most any place in the town.
So it's very convenient for
teachers to be there currently
of those 5 units, like I said,
once condemned, we have 43
current teachers are in there.
One of them will come open.
And the plan is for the long
term as we look at our facility
needs and evaluation is to
create this as phase one, much
like Mr. Chavez says, so we meet
an immediate need to use that as
swing space.
For when we're doing other
projects and working that so we
can get like two duplexes put on
that lot which could be feasible
based on the price that we
receive.
Duplexes are 2 and 3 bedroom
lots depending on how expensive
currently, but we understand
there's gonna be some cost
overruns because by the time
we're able to do, we all know
inflation's hitting.
All those things with
construction, so we put taking
that into account. So those
modular units they were looking
at the duplex are roughly about
1100 square feet.
Uh, they run anywhere from 1800
to $210,000 of the bells and
whistles that are in them
depending on whether
You want to have cost efficiency
lights, LEDs, those types of
things, all the evaluation has
been done and we've also worked
very closely with our elective
cooperative to look at the needs
of ours because we are maxed out
currently on our electric grid
for the town of Corona.
If you guys do not know anything
that's going on right now, we
have, we become trailer park
capital of the world in Corona
because of wind farms.
We have added
27 students since I came on
board last year from wind farms.
So we've had rapid growth. I
came on board last year we had
74.
We are currently
And we were at 115 at
40 day count and we've lost.
5 because wind farm people keep
moving.
So we also have that rapid
growth and that project set to
keep going on for 7 years.
So we're gonna have a need to
hopefully add more teachers as
well to meet the growing need,
um, right now, my largest class
size is 16, but in the next 5
years, if the
Jacksons are right by the wind
people. We could see class size
of 20 in current which never
been done before in our
district's history.
So we, we're on that flex point
right now that we're gonna have
rapid growth. What's going to be
the long term impact on our
region and housing is critical.
For our people.
So, as I explained, we have 5
current units. One of them is
condemned.
And I talked about the, the
value of the properties in our
district and we're gonna have to
replace those teachers with
either level one or level 2 low
experienced teachers.
Um
budget-wise, but if I keep
getting student growth, I gotta
add teachers. There's no place
for them to live in my
community.
Currently, this, I mean, just to
set things aside. I am living in
Vaughan teacher housing right
now because
Because Superintendent Padilla
had an opening.
Otherwise, I'd been commuting an
hour and a half to get to work
every day.
But since
Mr. Pad and I have been talking
quite a bit about cooperatives
of using his space and our space
because we're only 30 minutes
apart.
On how we could cooperately meet
needs for our region as well as
Cody Patterson and Carrizozo.
That is a drastic need in our
part of the state because what
we have to recruit teachers in
our area. We don't have the
nightlife of an Albuquerque.
And those types of things. So we
have to give those people the
opportunity to live and be part
of our community. I'm gonna echo
a lot of the things that Mr.
Chavez said about being part of
our community.
Our teachers thrive in our
community.
And we've been very fortunate to
use Ed Fellows.
And all those programs.
At internships, all those things
that are going on that we've
been used to recruit, but I'm
also at the point right now
where I'm surprised Mr.
Patterson and Mr. Padilla
because I stole a teacher from
his district and one from the
from the other district because
they lived in my community and
we had openings at that point in
time.
We're robbing Peter to pay Paul
with the teacher situation.
And we have to entice rural
areas for, for especially young
teachers working in small
complexes to get their feet wet.
To be able to do that and
teacher housing would be an
incentive.
So it's the plan that was laid
out by the board and was stifled
with the finance. We did pass
that bond last year for
$9,995,000 for preventive
maintenance to go into our
current facilities and part of
that was being used for teacher
housing.
So we do have our local match
either through the bond or our
local capacity through SB 9
because we've got $300,000
reserve in SB 9 that we could
tap into to beat the match.
So the plan is currently,
depending on what happens to the
cost of the duplex modular
units.
Um, they also meet HUD
specifications, um, both of the
contractors I worked with have
met the federal HUD housing
requirements, a part of that, so
they're metal constructed.
Well insulated and you're
required to have air
conditioning in. Those are three
primary ones that you have to
have in order for them or let's
say HVAC. I don't say air
conditioning, it's an H complete
HVAC process that's in there.
So those modular units would be
laid on the current ground. Uh,
we have set aside some local
money for demolition surveying
and all those things that are
necessary for that, our city
just went through a massive
upgrade of utilities with sewer
connections.
In the last 5 years, so that
part of towns could probably be
redone, so we would just have to
redo the connections from, from
our connection to the lot.
And if we add a second lot,
there's more than enough
capacity inside the sewer to do
it.
Also, the electrical
co-operative done an evaluation
on the homes. We will be putting
energy back into the grid.
Because of the efficiency. Right
now, we have like 1940, it looks
like 1940 Transformer outside
that.
They will replace that
transformer when we come in. It
is part of the long term plan
for the cooperative to go to
that part of time that's
happening this summer.
So they do have a phase and
we've been working very closely
with all the local utilities on
this as we move forward.
So the funding request we're
putting forward right now is
estimated $480,000 but that was
done in September of this year.
We understand there could be
some cost overruns as well, so
we've set aside some local funds
for the funding of that through,
we also have windmill money.
That we've set aside for
upgrades and things such as that
that we can use as a cash
overrun, but, but Nick has done
a great job with our board
position ourselves financially
that we may not have to tap into
that. We have the bond money. We
have our SB 9 money, while
planning for a new building and
facility for the future that we
can be set up very well sound
financially going forward for
our community and our town.
Also, as you look at this, um,
in the long term for us.
Like I said, this is phase one.
This is what we call the swing
project. In order for us to get
teacher housing built. We got to
put one up to swing the ones we
have current residents in to go
into and come out.
Fortunately, we'll have one unit
come open when my husband and
wife team retires this year, but
unfortunately,
Boards asked me to move into it,
but I've also told them we have
a teacher, teacher has priority
over me.
I need to get teachers because
schools don't run without
teachers. We all know that.
So I think we've done a very
sound job of planning long term
for our district, knowing we
need a facility as well.
And be able to move forward and
be able to meet the current
needs.
Um, like I said, we've hired 3
teachers through the Ed Fellows
program.
Um, currently, we've done a very
good job of growing our own, uh,
and that program's been very
beneficial to Corona.
But I think we've hit the turnip
too many times. I think we've
run out of people capacity
coming in, and I'm 4 years away
from getting my next teacher
going through it because we had
one that left and went off to
school in Texas Tech and is
wanting to be a teacher.
But that's 4 years away. I have
an immediate need for that right
now. So as we look long term,
we'll keep doing all the things
we do in rural New Mexico to
make sure we have
Teacher housing available for
them and make it.
Conducive for them to have a
successful here coming to
Corona.
And if you, if you guys know
anything about our district, for
a small district, we are very
High on the academic standards
in the state.
I can't talk about the
embargoed, um,
Test results that are coming out
recently, but we've always been
in the top 5 to 10 in the state
as we've been in Corona. We put
a lot of value into educating
our teachers and our kids.
And I just want to stress the
point that this is a this is a
critical need for our community.
We have 60 year old buildings
and we're spending over $300,000
preventive maintenance, right
there is one project.
For a district. And we can do
that.
It will go a long way towards
helping building a new facility
for our district. We've been
very strategic in how we
presented this.
We have started a strategic
planning process with Ian Harmon
out of Northstar talking about
our facility needs, our
financial needs with Stiefel,
Mr. Kay's come to our board
several times.
So
I think we're well positioned to
carry this forward and be in
support. So.
I turned over to you guys for
questions.
Thank you, Curtis. Appreciate
the presentation.
I think you've covered quite a
bit there, so, uh, questions,
counselor.
Yes
Thank you for the presentation.
Uh, so you mentioned that you're
working with 2 contractors. Are
they two contractors going to be
actually building these modulars
or they were ones that were
recommended by CES to use as
project planners.
Um, they could bid on it.
Um, we did a request for
information. Those were the two
contractors that came back.
So they wouldn't prevent them
from being able to bid on it if
we go forward, but they were
very strategic because like I
said, the ones in New Mexico
State, I talked a lot of people
in New Mexico State that had
worked with them quite
extensively on their projects
over there and they were the two
that are most recommended.
They've worked a lot in rural
New Mexico, so I imagine they
would be the most logical ones
that would want to do this
because they've already got
existing work in our area.
Right. The only thing I would
add is that, uh, for this
teachers housing whoever does
this, they have to be modular
approved in New Mexico to be
able to do this. So I would just
caution and make sure that
that's the case, that they are
modular approved if they are the
ones that are going to be
constructed they are because
they've already done that
through New Mexico State.
So they put modular classrooms
out in New Mexico State as well
as a ranch house, so they had to
follow the same standards
because I looked at the Mexico
specs, so they should be able to
meet those requirements as they
go forward.
OK.
Uh, that's it. That's all I
have.
Thank you.
else
Again, um, so you currently have
5 units, you said 1 is
condemned. Yes. And I hope he
didn't hear that because.
Nobody's living in it currently,
so you know.
But uh so you're gonna add 2
more.
Yes, what we're planning on
doing and one thing that I would
like to say depending on the
efficiency we would like to get
to 6.
Conceivably, if we can do that,
it means we can sell the other
lots because there is a desire
of the community or the town to
buy those lots for other
facilities.
So that's part of our long term
financing plans. So once we get
to page one and we get through
all the planning, we'll be able
to do the next steps and look
at, if we can put two duplexes
on now, we only look at putting
another duplex on because we're
looking at maybe 6, maybe 8 max
units for us looking at filling
that need that's going on, but
it gets to that sweet spot is,
that's right now, but I got a
plan also for growing, what do I
do to meet an immediate teacher
need if I got a teacher
mid-year. So the the initial
plan was for us to look at a
10 units, but that sweet spot
was 6 to 8. We're trying to look
at it. We budgeted for worst
case scenario and what our ideal
scenario are, so we can move
forward and look at that.
Unless there are any other
questions, again, thank you for
coming uh to make the
presentation and.
Good luck to you and we hope to
see you soon. Thank you.
Thank you.
Right.
Next on the agenda we have Rio
Rancho Public schools and
there's 3. Sorry. uh, Mr. Chair
and members, next up is Rear
Ranch Public Schools. They're
here to, uh, make their
presentation for 4 potential
awards.
War. Um, the first is a
standards-based request for
Lincoln Middle School currently
ranked number 88. This would be
for a, uh, renovation of the
existing spaces and system
upgrades.
Secondly, a standards-based
application for Rear Rancho High
School currently ranked 99 for
an addition and system upgrades.
And then 2
requests one at Shining Star
Preschool for a kitchen and
cafeteria edition and then
another one to convert Questa
del Sol potentially into a pre-K
facility.
that, I will turn it over to
Superintendent Cleveland,
Patrick Martinez.
Like Baker and tea.
Good morning. Good morning,
Superintendent. How are you?
coming in and members of the
committee, uh, thank you for an
opportunity to speak to you this
morning.
Uh, I want to say just a couple
of very general things, and then
we'll move right into the
information we'd like to share
with you. Our goal like all
districts is to maintain the
facilities.
Um, and to move our students out
of portable classrooms, which
are, um, not only very expensive
to maintain, but also, um, not
very secure in the world that we
live in today. We made a lot of
progress in that area. We have
gone from the start of the
district to 2/3, 3/4 of all of
our children were portable
classrooms and with your help
over the years.
We are, we are down
significantly, but we still
have.
So.
that are around a very old
portables.
Uh, we like other districts are
really facing challenges in
terms of special education.
These are the very specialized
programs that we need now to
support um the, the students
that we are facing. We're also
dealing with a lot of issues
with general education students
today in terms of behavior as
well. It's not just children
with disabilities.
And um
The the last comment is that the
utilization of space we have
today looks very different than
it did 20 years ago based on
programs, based on student
needs, uh, based on other
challenges that we have.
Um, I'd like to start with, um,
sharing a little bit about
enrollment.
Uh, we have seen, uh, um, a
decline in enrollment.
And uh it it's not always for
the reasons you might think.
The, um, we certainly have seen
a national trend for um
enrollment numbers going down.
And ours have come about for a
different reason and I alluded
to that earlier and we'll, we'll
speak more to that, uh, during
the presentation. Uh, we have a
lot of issues today with with
behavior, um, which is, uh,
having some parents pull their
children from our schools, uh,
because they don't want their
children exposed to some of
those behaviors.
Um, but the biggest loss is a
couple of years ago we lost over
500 elementary children, and
that is because we had with the
new requirements for hours and
uh the the lack of
Um, buses, the number of buses
that we needed, we had to take
and divide our elementary
program into two tiers. We now
run 4 tiers, uh, for, uh, for
transportation in our district.
half of our children in
elementary, were forced to start
at 9:20 a.m. and many of our
working families told that
that's not very family friendly.
That's just not realistic for uh
for us we may live in Rio
Rancho, we may, uh, work
downtown Albuquerque. We may
work at Sandia, we may work at
Kirtland, and so, uh, 9:20
start, uh, we had many parents
pull their children and find
another place where they could
go, uh, so that they could start
earlier in the day.
The um
We also uh though on the other,
other hand, um, for during COVID
we saw, uh, overall, uh,
community growth just kind of
come to us.
Uh, as a major slowdown, but
that has turned around
significantly now.
So the last several years we are
up to 4390 building permits. So
we're thinking that we've had a
lull and, and, and, uh, and
growth but the building permits
would suggest that we're going
to see an uptick in that.
very soon. How many children
will come with that. We used to
be able to really predict that,
just, you know, easily predict
how many children per household
can't do that as easily now.
We're having a delayed birth
rate with some of our
millennials, and yet many of the
Some are now making that
decision to buy homes and have
families. They face, as you very
well know, some real struggles
and, and getting started.
And so, uh, we do see a major
growth in housing developments
throughout our community, uh
right now. So I think that,
that, that's probably going to
turn around.
Uh, shining stars, we'll be
talking about pre-K today.
Uh, these are the
for our pre-K enrollment, we
have, um,
We really have lots of students
in Rio Rancho, and that's been
addressed uh our district with
LFC, um, we have a, a very large
percentage of students not being
served in our district, given
the size of our district, that
has always been due to a lack of
space and uh also due to the
fact that uh because of that
lack of space, we can only offer
half day program and half day
program again is not
particularly friendly or working
families, they find
very hard to manage. The state,
as you well know, uh, early
childhood is really pushing full
day programs for all children
and that opportunity, um, that
would reduce the number of
children that were serving by
50% unless we can get some
additional classroom space, um,
we did survey our parents with
young children in the district
and it was overwhelming.
Um
Uh, feedback that they would
prefer a full day program if we
can manage to provide that for
them.
La Roman or middle school
enrollment is is down somewhat
and now again, I think I've
already addressed some of the,
the, the reasons for that.
But we do believe that's going
to, to turn around. Lincoln is a
very, um, is one of our older
schools. It predates the
creation of the school district.
It's uh approximately 40 years
old. It was built by the
Albuquerque Public School
District and uh that school has
a lot of, has a lot of needs.
Our, our high school enrollment,
we have, I believe, the last
numbers that I looked at.
We have the largest high schools
in the state of New Mexico.
And uh they are very large.
Uh, we have, um,
We ran high now it's almost 30
years old.
Yeah that's amazing. You think
about how fast time time flies,
but uh it was not really built
for some of the programs that we
provide students today, and it
is certainly in need of some
major changes, some major, major
upgrades to bring that school
up.
Um, again, yeah, we would prefer
not to have high schools of over
2500, but the cost of building
high schools today is, is
extremely expensive and um we
have looked at trying to
mitigate that somewhat.
Um, this next year we'll open
another.
building a career technical
center, which we hope will move
some of the students out of
those two comprehensive high
schools and give us some relief
in terms of enrollment, but they
are very, very, um, full
schools.
One of the things I, I'd like to
just very briefly address with
you, special education. I think
everybody is dealing with the
needs of, of children today, um,
that have um all types of
disabilities. We have, um,
A a lot of children are very
severe disabilities, you'll see
that breakdown in terms of the
numbers.
Um, a majority of our children,
of course, are A and B, but we
have a large number of children
who are C and D.
We have
Uh, about 2500 transfers due to
special education across the
district.
including the outer district
transfers, about 3 of those are
related to special education. We
have approximately 800 students
who transfer into Rio Rancho
School District, about 20% of
those transfers in are special
ed children, and they come
generally with very high levels
of of need and uh we welcome all
children, but with these
children do come in, uh, they do
present some facility and uh.
A staffing challenges for our
for our district.
That's, I, you know, we, we have
about 20%.
cent of our children in Rio
Rancho with disabilities.
And that's high, and when I
checked with other districts, it
doesn't seem to be higher than
others, um, and so we just seen
maybe part of that is better
identification, but I think a
lot of it is just we have more
children at risk and at need
today in our schools and in our
communities. And not only do we
have more in terms of numbers.
The, the actual disabilities are
much more challenging.
I'll give you an example, yeah,
maybe 10 years ago we might
have.
Across our district, 3 or 4
really very high need children.
Today we have 3 or 4 very high
need children in every single
school, elementary level.
And at the secondary level it
has grown as well, so.
Um, we have a lot of kids
transferring in for special
services. We have a lot that are
living within our district.
And the needs of those children
are unlike anything I've ever
seen, um, over many years. We
even have one child that we have
to place out of the district and
that that one student is uh uh
very challenging about a quarter
of a million a year to be able
to provide the services for that
child.
Shining stars is our pre-K and
as I mentioned to you earlier,
um, very full. We have a a lot
of children who uh will, will
turn 3 and will be counted in
those numbers, so we'll address
that a little bit later.
Um, but we have a lot of
children we cannot serve because
of a lack of of of space and and
resources and uh we do know um
that we have more and more
children that are coming
developmentally delayed.
And that's just in general, in
general, and that's part of the
legacy of COVID.
But our teachers tell us that
they see children that are 1 or
23 years behind when they come
in the door and so makes pre-K
all the more urgent for all of
our, our, our, our districts and
our kids, because we can tell
the children who've gone through
pre-K in our district look very
different from the children who
have not had that, that service.
Why do we not take all kids, it
comes down to space and it comes
down to a lack of full day
programs.
And half day programs still work
for some families who may have a
stay at home, uh, parent or who
may have a grandparent or
someone who can work that
schedule.
But for many of our families,
they simply cannot manage with
a uh a part day program.
There are um
You know, it, it's me again, as
I said, we have a low percentage
given the size of our district
of children who are covered in
our program.
Um, we have the numbers for
Lincoln Middle School Special
Education.
And um all the numbers can, you
know, are, are high, the C and D
out.
I, I, are, are more needy than
we've seen in the past.
Some of these children are, are,
you know,
Very low pupil teacher ratios.
Only a few kids can be in the
classroom. We have one classroom
where we have 11 adult for every
child, uh, based on the severity
of those children's needs. Other
states have some other
alternative programs that
address these, um, the support
for some of these high estate
gifts. We don't have that.
In New Mexico and so all of our
children are served in our
distri, and we very much support
that. We welcome every child,
but it's really difficult, um,
to, to meet their needs.
We also have a lot of children
that, as I said, don't qualify
for special education, but
they're right on the border.
And they have very high needs
with their don't quite qualify
for services.
Rio Rancho High School, um,
again has uh
A a very large number of
children receiving services and
one of the things that we see at
the high school level in terms
of special ed is the need for
more transition services, more
services are gonna help these
young people get out and be.
successful in the community, and
we do not have the, the, the,
the facilities to really
facilitate.
That kind of transfer, uh, to
the community, but we do have
some programs that try very hard
to accomplish that.
Um, sorry.
So I'm not gonna turn it over.
To, um, um
I
Oh, I'm sorry, Cha's next,
sorry, sorry, join us.
Thank you for having us. My name
is Janice Shannault and I
supervise our elementary schools
and our preschool and 2024
September, we got.
Notice that our pre-K was gonna
have to move to full day by
ECECD and our application was
going to be due this coming
school year. So that gave us
about a year and a half to plan
what we were gonna do to move to
full day.
So we started our first
committee in September of 2024.
The grant application that we
have in Rio Rancho is only for
our pre-K, our 4Y students and
our current application is for
4104Y students. So we have.
Currently, 422. We used to have
a wait list of anywhere from 300
to 400 or why students waiting
to get into our pre-K.
Once ECECD offered full day pre
precare at other facilities,
that number reduced drastically
for us and our waitlist is a lot
shorter.
But our preschool serves all
students with special needs in
our district that are 3 and 4Y.
So we have 3 year olds there and
4 wives that are in our one
preschool facility. Every year
our preschool is maxed out, but
we have to take every student
that qualifies through Child
Find services or if they move
into our district and there are
34 year olds and they have an
IEP, we have to serve them at
our facility. So it is an
inclusion model currently.
You can see from our numbers
that we have 1773Y.
And we operationally pay for 50
GE peer models, we don't get
funding for that, but we believe
in that inclusionary model as
much as possible. So that's
increased dramatically in the
last 10 years, we used to have
maybe 8 students we do one per
classroom.
But we keep it at 50 right now
because we need room for
students who will qualify.
In our queue, we've tested 1493Y
students and currently we have
53 waiting to turn 3, that will
be placed.
And that's before December, so
we have 53 IEPs to do.
That'll bring our capacity up to
almost 10 it'll be about 183Y
students in our school.
For 4Y we currently have 422
students, as you'll see, we have
166 of those are receiving
special ed services and 256 are
general education students, so
you can see out of the grant
over half of those students are
receiving almost half of them
are receiving special education
services.
We have 6 students in the queue
that will qualify before
December. That'll bring that up
to 172.
Um, our biggest challenge is we
would like to go full day based
on what we talked to our
community, we asked, we had 1300
respondents, a little over 1300
that had children from 0 to 4
years old that we're going to
be.
Moving into pre-K, if they
wanted a full day or half day
and 75% said they would prefer
full day services.
We asked how many of them would
need transportation to access
pre-K and about 70% said that
they wouldn't need
transportation to access pre-K.
So based on the information from
our community, we really want to
try to figure out how we can at
least offer full day to some of
our families, and currently with
one facility, we can't do that.
I, I would add just one thing
too that when the uh.
When students go to the
non-public education
alternatives for early
childhood. As soon as that child
is identified as with a
behavioral or uh a special
needs, um, issue, they
immediately come back to us, so,
um, you know, they certainly are
not prepared to um meet the
needs of children that have high
needs.
Uh, good morning, uh, Mr. Chair.
Um, the next section, just want
to talk about some of the
funding, and as you can hear so
far this morning, uh, we do have
Many needs, especially uh in the
special ed.
Uh, area which requires quite a
bit more um space than our
general led students.
Uh, on your page, I believe page
57. Uh, there's a list there of
the
Some of the schools that will be
receiving.
Uh, this bond.
I don't know if this is coming
across too well.
The list in front of you
represents about 50% of the
school sites.
We do, we do have significant uh
issues at all of our school
sites, and as you are aware,
Um
In August of 20.
22
We did complete our our 5 year
master plan.
And that a plan called for $378
million over five-year time
period, uh, where our schools
need to be uh upgraded.
Our financing situation,
fortunately, uh, we have a
community that supports
Uh, the school district and in
2023.
voters did approve an $80
million bond issue.
And I know that sounds wonderful
and it is wonderful. However,
when you compare that to the
$378 million of needs across the
district, there's an obvious
deficit.
And so typically we
Uh, will receive approximately
$20 million each fiscal year.
We get a bit more than 5 million
in SB 9 money, so those two
funds are bonds and our esB9 is
what we use um to maintain our
facilities and to upgrade those
facilities.
So each year we, we have about
25 million, um, and over 5
years, that would be about 125
million as compared to 378
million.
Which leaves a deficit of 253
million.
Over 5 years or approximately
$50 million a year, um.
And, and needs for the district.
That's the, the financing
component and in this particular
year, all of those uh items on
the list for this particular
bond cycle, which is a 4-year
bond cycle is we take a look at
our priority one projects, so we
don't have funding to go beyond
those priority one, you know,
and, and Patrick will, um,
Speak to those
So I will revert.
To uh Patrick to to talk about
the specifics of the projects.
Thank you. Good morning. Um, so
as you heard, you kind of got a
rundown of our enrollment kind
of where we stand. And so the,
the 4 projects that will be
coming to presenting to you our
two standards-based projects and
two pre-K. The two
standards-based projects, uh,
one for rear Rancho High School,
um.
And what's included in this
would be uh special education
classroom creation, um, roof
replacement, HVAC upgrades,
electrical upgrades, and fire
alarm. Um, now, as you heard,
uh, from Doctor Cleveland, uh,
regarding enrollment, um, and
specifically on the special
education side. Um, what, what
we intend to do is we do have
about 9 portables currently on
site that are being used, uh,
and they're pretty much used for
special education programs. And
so what our goal is, is to bring
them
Inside what what we'll also be
working on is securing the
campus. Richo high school, you
know, it's a beautiful campus,
but it wasn't necessarily
designed uh with security in
mind. And so as we've worked,
you know, diligently to
Really tighten up the security
of the campus, um, those, the
students with the highest need
are kind of left on the outside.
And so what we're, what we're
proposing is is creating a
classroom building to be able to
bring them in, bring them in the
secure perimeter but also
provide the necessary facilities
for those students, um, another
one, and if you, if you go to
page 61, talking some of the
system upgrades, um, you know,
the roof replacement, uh, as
Doctor Cleveland said, we're
coming up on 30 years, uh, for
this school, so a lot of the uh
necessary uh systems are at
their have reached their
lifespan, roofs being one of
them, um, HVAC is the other one
currently has a boiler system
which
A boiler system isn't a bad
system. It's just, uh, it, it's
outdated and then trying to find
people to maintain a boiler
system has also been a
challenge. So we intend to
upgrade that system. Um, and
then whatever necessary
electrical upgrades, uh, to
accommodate the new systems. And
then one of the biggest
challenges we have on that site
is drainage, um, uh, the school
was built right at the kind of
in a bowl and so the drainage
has always been an an issue
there and it's starting to show
and starting to wear some of the
facilities, so we intend to uh
upgrade.
that as well. Um, along with the
fire alarm, which again, you
know, bringing safety back to
the um to the discussion, um,
the fire alarm is the original
fire alarm system and so we
intend to upgrade that as well.
The next project, um, on the
first standards base would be uh
Lincoln Middle School, Lincoln
Middle School uh was uh
A part of APS prior to it being
a part of Rio Rancho. Um, it was
built in 1983 is, is definitely
an aging building and we have
been fortunate enough to
Upgrade systems, um, but what
we'd like to do is complete the
upgrades for that school, which,
uh, one of the large one is a
complete the roof replacement
for that school. Um, a lot of
the ADA restroom or the
restrooms, um, have ADA
compliance issues and a lot of
the, the fixtures and finishes
are starting to really show
their, their age and, and in
addition to that, the fire alarm
upgrade, um, but as far as
standards based, you know, we
intend to, again, this school
has old portables.
Um, that have been there for a
long time that have reached
their lifespan. Um, and I
wouldn't say they're condemned,
but they are definitely in bad
shape. And so the intent is to
bring those classes into the
building and utilize potentially
existing space within the
building to replace those
classrooms, um, and
What came out of our 5-year
master plan is that there are
some uh inadequacy specifically
surrounding science labs and
things of that nature. So it's
our intent to um bring those in
and, and give them what they
need.
Um, and then on page 20 you'll
see some proposed costs, um,
which again have been have been
brought from our five-year
master plan, um.
Which would accommodate these
projects.
The next set of projects are,
are surround pre-K and and as
again Janna and Doctor Cleveland
touched on is, you know, that is
a that's a big, um, that's a big
item right now uh in our state,
but also in our district and,
and what we're able to serve,
um, and so the idea right now is
that we, we currently have
Shining Star Preschool, which is
an amazing facility, but if we
go full day, we'll be in need to
serve uh
Lunches throughout the day and
so the goal is to have to be
able to provide a cafeteria
facility, uh potentially a
kitchen facility for this so
that we can serve.
students full day.
Um, the other idea that we have
in another project is Costa del
Sol Elementary, uh, potentially
being repurposed for a pre-K,
um, as, as Janice stated, you
know, we do have a pre-K
committee that we're working
diligently on the best options
for pre-K and one of the things
that have come up early on is,
is repurposing an elementary and
lusted del Sol from a facility
standpoint, we've, we felt is is
one of the easier schools to
utilize for pre-K and the way
it's designed, it's designed in
pods.
which would require a little
less, uh, a lot less, um,
upgrades to restroom facilities
and the classroom facilities to
make it pre-K ready, uh, and so,
again, that's, that's what our
goal is for that school and um
and as you can see on page 67,
we have some proposed costs
there as well to
Which really looks at that, um.
What the funding might look like
for those, um.
So I went through that kind of
quick, um, but I think a lot of
it really is based on a lot of
the information that Doctor
Cleveland and, and Janna
presented, um, and again, these
projects really come from our
five-year master plan. Um,
they're the high priority
projects and
Really they're, they're
Specifically to standards-based
projects are, are some of our
oldest and, and really aging
schools.
Um, so with that Stanford
questions and.
So that completes your
presentation.
Thank you so much.
That's a lot of information for
us, but again, uh, we'll open it
up for questions from the
council.
Yes, Mr. Chair, thank you
everyone for uh the presentation
of a couple of quick questions
that you may have gone over and
I may have missed. So my first
question is how many classrooms
are gonna be um added to uh
Roancho High School, um, to get
rid of those portables and then
the second question is for the
Auesta del Sol repurpose, how
much of that facility would be
repurposed for pre-K.
So to to answer your first
question, uh, currently they
have 9 portables which equates
to about 15 classrooms. There's
a variety of single portables
and double portables. So the
goal would be to um do an
enrollment study to make sure
that we're replacing uh what's
needed, but the idea is that we
would bring those 15 classrooms
into the into a building.
And for pre-K, ironically, it
would be 15 classes just to
maintain, we wouldn't even be
able to expand our enrollment.
We'd need, we have 30 classrooms
at Shining Stars. So if we went
half day, we would have to do 15
on one side and 15 on the other
side.
As we're looking at
pre-purposing, um,
Or so and it's one of the
options that we, we are looking
at but the whole school would be
repurposed.
OK.
Thank you.
First
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
for the presentation. Very
informative. Um, a couple more
questions on the pre-K, um,
superintendent, I think you
spoke to this.
Uh, in your introduction and
kind of overview of your
enrollment trends.
But, you know, we were a little
surprised to see that you've had
a whole
Elementary school that you could
repurpose.
Um
And so it is the
Availability of that capacity
mainly due to the transportation
issues that you mentioned and
Can you just um give us a little
more detail on that, like how it
is that the district has had an
entire elementary school become
available.
It, it's um
The entire small elementary
school, a lot of your rancho
elementary schools are 8 900
approaching 1000, but I
Yeah, it was a shock to us too,
so we followed up with those
parents, and we asked them why.
I, I mentioned that the two
reasons.
One was, um
the issue of some behaviors in
classrooms.
the inability to remove
disruptive children, and they
did not want their children
exposed to that.
a serious problem because a lot
of them.
Some of these children are not
even um
Special ed, their general ed.
I, I can just share with the
committee um a conversation
kinda.
It's just kind of
Surprise me. I just fucking with
the parent, um.
having some problems adjusting
their child and was trying to
decide whether or not.
their child, and she said we
never said no to our child,
ever.
We believe in parenting.
child will find their boundaries
somehow and and I.
I thought, well, for me and that
kind of, I understand that that
child was being extremely
disruptive in that classroom.
Classroom was having to evacuate
the classroom.
Several times a week.
special needs child. It was a
regular child, and so this whole
issue of where we are right now
with children in terms of some
coming developmentally delayed,
but many I not very well
socialized for school.
It's, it's a legacy we're gonna
have to deal with in schools for
a while.
Primarily following COVID, but
we saw those trends even before
COVID. It's not strictly a COVID
issue.
And so we're having to look at
perhaps classrooms where we can
remove disruptive. Children get
them the help they need, get
them back.
the classroom again.
It is, uh, it is amazing to see
some of the.
Um, some of the, the behaviors
and what children are not coming
to school with today.
Um
Just a different time, but the
primary overwhelming reason was
the transportation. I just said
that 9:20 start time does not
work for working families. We
did provide before and after
care, but people have to pay for
that.
with, uh, maybe 1 or 2 children,
and if they have a larger
family, it's very hard to afford
those before and after school
programs, and so they just
simply chose to go somewhere
else and, and
We were extremely shocked and
caught off guard by that. We
knew there was a lot of um
anger.
That you know, directed at the
district with the light
transportation start.
I can tell you we tried every
single thing we could do not to
do it.
We would like to go back to a
single tier for elementary.
A reasonable time for children
to go to school, but it also
impacts things like professional
development for all of our
elementary school teachers. It,
it just makes for a lot of
challenges on that.
year.
So I would say, you know, the,
the feedback we got is
overwhelmingly transportation,
lack of sufficient number of
buses and going to a 9:20 start.
Also children out late in the
day.
OK, well, that comes into their
time to do things as a family,
and it also gets into the things
that children sometimes like to
do after school, whether it's
recreational, uh.
kinds of things because it's so
light in the day.
So, um, we had a huge community
of satisfaction with that.
when it start.
May I just add to that, um, so
is the population isn't small
compared to other districts that
have repurposed schools. But
what we've learned as the
committee, we're either gonna
have to reverse the school and
put students in the vacancies in
the other elementary schools to
create a pre-K or we're gonna
have to fill up those schools
with pre-K slots and so
traditionally having all of our
pre-K services in one building
has been what's most successful.
So that's why we're trying to
figure out how to contain it as
much as possible. We're gonna
fill those buildings that have
empty spaces either with.
OK or with other elementary
students and it just seemed like
that was the best option to
maintain the integrity of, of
what we've seen at Shining
Stars.
We have had tremendous
light was shining stars. We have
had
districts in our state come to
visit. We've had people come
from other states. We've had
them come.
Over the United States to see
that school. It has, it has done
an amazing job in providing for
young children, um.
But obviously, we're, we're
really short.
asked me the last board meeting,
what's the ideal? Well, the
ideal would be to, to build
another big or two,
And um, certainly the boarding
has some concerns. The community
has some concerns about.
Living children from Boston.
In other schools, whether they
will be overcrowded, uh, but we
do, as, as you know, we do have
some room at some schools.
to be able to accommodate that.
That transfer.
And anytime you try to close the
community school, very hard on
the community.
We have had a lot of very
unhappy.
Individuals that have have
to us in the morning. So, uh,
you know, the idea would be to
build another. The other comment
I would make is that ancillary
is very expensive.
Um, when you spread ancillary
services over a larger area
number of schools. It takes more
and it's more costly, but more
than just the money for
ancillary, it's the immediate
need that children have. So that
child is melting down. It's in a
really bad situation. You need
that help them, you know, oh
well, you know that, uh.
I'll make it to your campus,
maybe this afternoon or maybe
early next week.
And I think that's been one of
the successes of a centralized
program is that child gets that
help.
That specialist is right there
working to de-escalate that
behavior.
We're helping a child with some
of the other things, but it
costly, uh, spreading it out.
raises ancillary costs and
ancillary, as you well know,
very expensive.
When we can't find a lot of the
ancillary that we need. So we
moved to um contracting and that
was outrageously expensive.
So, uh, I, from an economic
standpoint, what we see
naturally is more a move towards
centralizing those services
because of cost, because of the
ease of delivery for.
Inyi. Thank you.
Thank you. Uh, is the core
transportation issue, just lack
of drivers or?
Is, is the core of the
transportation issue that
to you having to do later start
times that's not an element,
it's just lack of drivers. Yeah,
um, hiring drivers is a huge
challenge.
uh, equally is having.
buses
So if, if we had extra drivers.
It really wouldn't do us any
good at this point because we
don't have.
buses
So when you look at rearrange,
we are
few systems that are actually on
a four-tier system.
And
deposits for tier system. You
start very early.
First year starts very early in
the morning.
Doctor Cleveland said.
Last year
Elementary,
Kids are getting to school at
night.
20
It's very disruptive uh on
families. So it is a twofold
problem.
But
First thing we have to resolve
is
Acquiring additional buses and.
our desire to be.
For those buses.
that
Because our buses um and, and
they're nothing.
There to some others, so I
would, I would say that a
friend.
Yeah, that's a leave a little
before 6 o'clock.
But we're finishing up around 6
and maybe a little sometimes in
the evening. That's a long day
for drivers, and of course I'm
not driving every minute.
There's breaks between the ears.
That's one of the reasons we
can't recruit or retain drivers
if they had better salary if
they had um
Uh, a more reasonable workday.
I believe that we could recruit
and could retain drivers. I, I
don't know, you know, I, I have
to tell you a bus driver's job
is very different than it used
to be.
One of the hardest jobs in our
school. It's a very challenging.
Uh
You have children.
of that background.
Um, and, and I think
transportation.
the state.
In terms of
sufficient and
Um, being able to maintain and
retain, re, retain our drivers.
But I think the other day we
could probably keep more drivers
than we do.
Thank you. Um
So
You know, just a comment. I
mean, it seems like
That is an issue of the state
should work.
with you on, that's a pretty big
loss of
students.
Or what hopefully could be a
solvable problem over time.
You know, I
I, I'm gonna add, many of them
said they would come back.
If we could get the time
adjusted.
Um
Yeah, so I, I guess, you know, I
would hope we could look at how
we could address that problem
and then, you know, if
If there was a solution to the
transportation issue. Do you
guys have capacity at other
schools to start, you know,
absorbing students who might
come back. I guess I'm just
wondering like is the
I repurposing this elementary
school gonna cause any
Um
You know, I don't know what the
word is, but is it gonna cause
any, you know, like sudden
problem where you don't have
capacity if you are able to
bring students back or if you do
are able to bring students back
cause they're gonna be a need to
build a new elementary school,
um,
Somewhere, you know, kind of
what like the ripple effects of
doing this look like for the
district. Yeah, that, that's an
excellent question and
Our fear really is, is more on
the long term.
Because Rio Rancho, one of the
few communities in New Mexico is
a growing community.
But we do have some, you know,
some members of, uh, in fact,
Doctor Cleveland talked about
building permits. Right now, I
think uh
2024.
Mother's over 900 building
permits this year.
And so,
Uh, as families move in, um,
are our needs
For
space increases and
So it's, it's been kind of an
interesting last few years
really post COVID, what our
numbers.
have done, uh, basically we, we
Actually law student enrollment
because of COVID. We
Captured a number of students
post-COVID, um, and now we're
seeing kind of a leveling off,
but we do anticipate uh
That those numbers will actually
increase because of the
increase in development, uh,
and.
Show and with that we do have
the capacity currently, but if
we take one school offline.
Potentially could cause
overcrowding at our other
elementary schools.
It's Doctor Cleveland indicated,
um, the
solution for
Uh, it's actually to create.
A brand new school
Another shining star preschool
that we would situate that at
the south end of the community.
Uh, this way we would have
plenty of capacity.
4 elementary students, uh, well
into the future.
I, I would have just one thing
to give you a little bit of a
historical um
Perspective.
Um, we had several years ago,
both we show in Las Cruces.
The contractors had our
contractors walk on us, said it
was no longer profitable for
them to, to run buses in the
state of New Mexico. And so we
had a choice of either going on
our own.
Or, or trying to find another
contractor.
We were not able to find another
contractor and we, we.
it up ourselves. Las Cruces was
able to find a a contractor a
little bit different direction.
But at that point, we had to
come up with the buses because
Graham took the buses with them.
And so at that time, at the they
had to look for buses all over
the state of New Mexico to give
us enough buses to get our
children to and from school.
Particular time we lost a
significant number of buses
simply because I couldn't find
them.
And so I think that's kind of a
watershed moment for us where
we, we had less bus than we had
had previously.
Um, and it is
a lot of transportation issues
for us over many years. But that
was a catalyst for.
emergency situation. So we have
your buses today than we have
that.
OK, thank you. Um, just a couple
more questions. What is, what's
the current enrollment at West?
The Romans approximately 500 and
5550.
OK. And those students, you said
would be absorbed at other
schools. That's what we're
looking at. I, I can tell you
I'm gonna be huge respect from
the community about it.
You know, uh, we have really
mixed feelings about it.
But um
also know that if we don't do,
we don't get to more children.
OK.
It's going to impact the student
performance for our entire
district for years to come.
And so that's why we are trying
very hard to find any way.
To at least keep what we have.
But hopefully to grow the number
of children.
We can, we can serve, so.
I, I see it as that foundational
piece.
I have, I have.
that with all
schools and we have talked with
kindergarten teachers.
They they tell us that children,
um, that come from pre-K.
My experiences are so much
better off than children who did
not get that opportunity.
I also share with us that
children are coming
significantly.
What I am historically seen over
many years.
I, I think it's important to
know too as a part of.
so specifically with that
project and during the design is
to kind of
built off the what our committee
is working on now is to really
look at what that means and to
really kind of
That, that project would be
right now we're looking at the
entire school, but as our
committee.
to me and we get
to uh potential design for a
purpose, you know, a lot of that
will give us more information
once we, once, you know, that
decision is made. So I think
it's important to note that, you
know,
Doctor Cleveland
said, you know, we do have mixed
feelings about it, but we're
we're very diligent in how we're
looking at it and what the
impacts are and it's
unfortunately, it's not a
decision that, you know, can be
made uh very quickly.
It's something that we're having
to look at a lot of different
avenues and a lot of different
perspectives on what that would
do to the.
community and what that our
district, both short term and
long term with pre-K and then
the.
elementary.
Thank you. Um, well, kudos to
you all for looking at, you
know,
Potentially tough decisions um
to make this possible, I think,
from E LSC's perspective, you
know, we share your view that
being able to expand your
Pre-K program is really
important for your district and
for the state given um the
number of students that you
serve.
the success of Shining Stars so
far. Um, so just one more
question and I'll stop, um, you
mentioned that your
application to ECECD for full
day was only for 4 year olds,
but you're maintaining your 3
year old program. Is that right?
OK.
Um
And then
On your pre-k enrollment slide,
you know that, you know, you
would expect
a significant jump. I think I'm
reading this correctly, that if
you do a full day, you'd
Experience a significant jump on
in the number of kids on your
wait list.
So
I guess my question is,
You know, what then and like
should we be looking at
doing more and
We're looking at here, or is
that kind of like a next step
for the.
I, I would think and I respond
to that as well. I think France
is a triage.
situation now. I'm trying to
deal with this short-term issue.
But long term.
We would like to see far more
children be able to receive
services. So, um, you answer
yes, we've got short term need
emergency, long term you of
where we need to go.
That things were we're trying to
avoid is turning shining stars
into just a special education
setting.
We could put traditional pre-K
students at our elementary
schools we visited, um, some
other elementary schools and
EPS, and they only take students
that don't have IPs. So they
have traditional students that
are
Um, maybe getting speech and
that's it.
And that's not something we want
to do. We wanna make sure we're
as inclusive as possible. So one
of the challenges is how do we
Only one facility. We really
have to send all of our special
education students there and we
don't want to do that.
So we have talked about, do we
do like a pre-K2 school atlasta
and see what happens with
enrollment at Questa and if it
doesn't continue to increase,
then we go full force to pre-K
all the way through and just
move 3 through 5 the first year.
So we're looking at some other
options and looking at what
are doing, but we know across
the state, they're all moving
to.
everybody's moving that way.
other things, um, and I'm sure
that uh you're very much a
winner.
The, the pure model has been one
of the, the, the cornerstones
of, of the success of this
school.
The children, young children
learn from each other every bit
as much as they learn from
adults. And so when you put
children in in the school that
are developmentally on target.
Children who are not, look at
them, they watch them. And, and,
and children learn from each
other as much as they learn from
adults at that age.
And it's also been wonderful, I
think in the.
For the community to have strong
support for them.
School.
And, and, and it's good for
children who are not
developmentally delayed to
develop an understanding and
compassion for children who are.
And so it's the, the pure model,
I think it's just been a
cornerstone of of it being more
inclusive, but it's better for
both groups of children.
And we're really proud of that
school because we, we really
have results that we can show.
Where's,
I said this and it's kind of an
emotional thing. But if there's
something that school that you
would visit in our district that
is close to being a miracle
worker kind of situation.
Stars preschool, and it's
amazing what children look like
when they come in and then what
they look like when they.
OK, thank you and um.
I
Assume that space is also a
limiting factor and only
pursuing all day for 4 year olds
currently, correct? OK.
All right. Thank you, Mr.
You.
Question, yes, Mr. Chair, uh,
Superintendent, thank you for
your presentation. Uh, regarding
uh what Kelly brought up for
transportation earlier this
year. PED did go look and
evaluate your routes, followed
your bus drivers, noticed how
buses weren't at full capacity,
um, after discussing with
transportation, um, I was told
that you're we're looking into a
consultant to um about
reevaluate operations, your
tears, um, is that something
you're still looking into as a
district?
I'd like to address that, so,
yes, the PED.
did send down uh a couple of
people. They never did uh
complete their analysis,
however, uh, we were a bit
disappointed in that. Uh, they
were only down for a few days
and, and we have a pretty large
district, um.
Uh, and you know,
A lot of folks don't realize
that we have a lot of dirt roads
and we have a lot of rural areas
that are buses travel.
And so yes, it is true that um
our buses are not necessarily at
capacity. And, and the answer is
actually fairly simple, and
that's a concept called time and
distance. And so because we're
on 4 tiers, we can't afford to
have a bus tied up for let's say
an hour, 1 hour and a half by
filling up.
And so to fill up that bus, uh,
it would take a lot of time and
then that bus could not get to
the next tier.
So we have to keep our routes
relatively short, so that bus
gets to the next tier. So that's
a difficulty that we have
because we don't have enough uh
buses, uh, PED's recommendation,
uh, again, they did not complete
the analysis, uh, and we did ask
for input afterwards. Uh, we got
no response.
Um, but they did also recommend
that we hire a contractor to
re-evaluate our routing and to
see if we could increase some of
that efficiency.
Uh, we have hired that group.
They are looking at our system
right now. Currently, um, the
work that they have done, we
don't have any changes yet, um,
but their work has not been
completed.
So we're hoping that uh maybe we
can see some efficiencies uh
after uh the contractor is
completed with their work, but
quite honestly, at this point,
we don't see that there's going
to be a real big change.
That it
Yes,
Thank you.
Thank you, Chair. Thank you for
the presentation. Much
appreciated. Uh, I definitely
gonna focus on the freaky. I'll
try to be fast cause I know we
need to to get through one. I
hope, um, as ECCD I just think
there's lots of opportunities.
To uh talk about some of the
half day, full day, you know, we
have been talking um at UCCD
about maintaining what we call
the basic or half the option for
the purposes of the fact
facilities are in need, and we
want to maintain inclusive
environments for children who
have a right to service when
they're 3 and 4, and all the
things you know, so I'm hoping
uh unrelated to this, we can
have a follow up about that. I
think for the purposes of the
committee today, a question I
have, and it may not be for
follow up today. It might just
be for follow.
up as we consider the award is
one, I think like my fellow
committee or council members, I
would encourage the growth. I
mean, Rio Rancho is, is growing,
as you said, and far below the
average for the number of 3 and
4 year olds that are served. He
serves 63% of communities in,
you know, in your district,
including community or 63% of 4
year olds, excuse me, and 17% of
3 is much below the state
average, of course, of 80% for 4
and 50%. For 3s, and that's
because of facilities both up on
the district side.
And the lack of community-based
uh license providers as, as you
all well know. So I think if
there's anything that the
committee or any way in which um
EC ECD could help think about
that consideration of, of
looking towards the future and
expansion, um, that we would
love to do that. The question I
have that may require follow-up
is just an understanding of how,
um,
Your 3 year olds are supported
all with uh Part B 619 funding
um for children with special
education needs and just also
wanting to know that for your 4
year olds, I think that would
help with strategy and kind of
reach as far as pre-K if you
would be able to follow up with
PSFA on kind of that budget
information. I think that would
help the conversation move
along.
We would be glad to do so. Thank
you.
John.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just
have one question, uh, on page,
your page 20, our page 64, I
guess. Um, the cost, the cost
estimates that you have for
those two projects at Rio Rancho
High School in Lincoln Middle
School. When were those, uh,
Estimates developed.
So they were, uh, those were
Developed during our five-year
master plan about what we've
done is we've obviously increase
in costs since that was done.
Um, we've kind of taken that.
and up the percentage just based
on the inflation for those, but
those were initially developed,
uh, based on our five-year
master plan.
So when was that?
0, 2022. It was completed in
2022. And, and what did you, did
you put like a flat sort of
percentage increase based on
inflation or what did you do
increase based on inflation. So
it was just a flat rate each
year since then. OK.
Thank you, Mr.
I have a couple of questions,
so.
Uh, first, uh,
I wanted to compliment you on.
When you're doing the overview,
Doctor Cleveland, you talked
about.
Focusing on career tech at the
high school level.
To alleviate the enrollment size
in your high schools.
So you to be complimented on
that, you also took a deep dive
into special ed, uh, sort of
districtwide but focusing on
several schools.
And uh I saw easily that the
special ed component of the high
school project is in there quite
uh.
In a quite and will have quite
an impact. I didn't see the.
The same
Break out in the budget for the
other projects that you have.
As it relates to special ed, so.
I also saw that.
Uh, all of the
That you provided.
Uh did not cover elementary
school's special ed.
focused on pre-K.
High school and middle school,
so is it?
Maybe you could shed some light
on that, on those things.
Um, so we
Most of our elementaries are
about 20%. We do have one
elementary school that's at 30%
special education, so that's
anywhere from 20 to 30% across
our elementary.
Now.
The, the other thing that we've
seen a huge increase in our
students that are not.
Um, best served in the inclusion
setting, so we're having to
create a lot more of the smaller
group settings. Definitely a
huge increase in medically
fragile. We're seeing a lot of
students who have, you know, new
syndromes, new things that we
haven't seen before, which
increases the health need and
then obviously I think we're all
seeing students with autism
increase across the district.
And then students that um we
don't quite know.
Where that lack of self
regulation is coming from, but
their general education students
coming into our district.
So we're also as part of our pre
pre-K committee looking at
transitional kindergartens for
next year as an option for some
students and maybe looking
differently at how we do
kindergarten.
For some students who may not
quite be ready, coming out of
preschool or not having any
preschool coming into
kindergarten.
I would say on average we're
still at 20 22%.
Thank you. And uh one final
thing I'd like to add, you know,
we've heard from school
districts around the state in
terms of our.
Our legislative program coming
up and one of, one of the
priorities, of course, is going
to be transportation.
We know that many of the
districts are putting in.
General fund to help meet those
needs and uh I thought I had
heard a very high number for Rio
Rancho and Las Cruces as well.
I know that uh some of the other
schools are facing that deficit
as well.
So do you have some numbers in
terms of how, how deep you're
getting into your general fund
for transportation.
We have, uh, this year
it's been a good year. We thank
the state for helping us this
year.
I can tell you prior to this
year, um.
Um, we have significant losses
out of our, our general fund,
uh, well exceeding $10 million.
Um, for, for hospital
transportation, so we really
applaud the state for taking a
really good look at.
Transportation needs in our
state and uh and having a plan
and not for now but for the
future and it's a
Um
When when you take money out of,
as you well know, when you take
money out of your operational
budget for transportation. There
are other things that don't,
don't get taken care of. Things
like special ed classrooms,
things like, you know, the money
comes right out of the classroom
and
So I think that's what districts
have, have been asking for is
that we do not have
transportation, um, costs that
have to be subsidized, uh,
directly out of the classroom.
Did you have a
What was the number you
Fine, you said.
This year, uh, we, we did better
than we have done in years, but
prior to that it was over what
uh uh my cousin exact numbers,
but it was over $10 million.
Yeah, so over time, um,
Over the
Last number of years it added up
to over 10 million, um, but last
year, typically our numbers
fluctuate between 2 and $3
million. And because of the
legislative action, uh, when
they took a look at the formula,
one of the things that really
hurt our district and some of
the other districts of similar
size, had to do what's called
the density factor. And so they
took that density factor out of
the formula, uh, and because of
that, um,
The
new formula essentially uh meets
our needs on transportation
costs.
I, I would add that I wanna
really stress, you know, that,
um, the way there's a loser's
peace.
It is, is what we don't need.
And everybody doesn't fit the
same exact situation across the
state, as everyone knows, we're
very diverse state.
And so our position has always
been that no district should end
up having to subsidize out of
their operational budget.
And, and
That's been a problem of over
many years as winners and
losers. Some years you may be a
winner, some years you may be a
loser, but for almost a decade
we were a loser.
In terms of transportation.
Thank you for that response.
Uh, unless there are any other
questions, again, thank you for
presentation. I think it was a
good discussion.
We appreciate your, uh, your
service.
so much for listening. We
appreciate you.
Thank you.
We'll move on to Bloomfield.
Mr. Chair and members, are you
ready for the next one? Yes.
Next up we have Bloomfield
Schools. uh, they are here to
make their presentation for the
potential standards-based
application.
To consolidate and replace 3
schools, which includes Central
Primary Schools, ranked number
37, Nabahani Elementary School
ranked 58 and Mesa Alta Junior
High School, ranked 71.
And with that, I'm gonna turn it
over to Superintendent Summers
and.
Thank you.
Morning, chair again, uh,
members of the council.
My name's Kevin Summers.
Superintendent of schools I have
with me today.
James Olibus, he's our director
of operations, Stacy Babcock.
She's our director of finance,
Kaylee Weimerskirs with RBC
Capital. Uh, also in the
gallery, we have our president
of the Board of Education, Mr.
Delmay.
And we also have Colleen
Martinez from Visions and
Planning, uh, our consultant for
our FMP.
Um, thanks for allowing us to
present to you. I promise I'll,
I'll try to keep it uh concise
but yet clear.
Uh, ultimately, um, as, as Ms.
Ramos said, we're looking for
standards-based awards for the
replacement of 3 of our
campuses, um, that are currently
ranked in the top 100. These,
these schools have served our
district very well, uh, for very
A very long time.
But the aging infrastructure is
now gotten to a point where it's
actually impeding educational
quality and operational
efficiency.
Um, each campus is dealing with
outdated systems from electrical
and HVAC to fire safety, and
these systems are well beyond
their life expectancy, uh,
requiring frequent and costly
repairs, that is if parts are
even available. Uh, some of
these systems are so beyond life
that, uh, it actually requires
full system replacements. Um,
and so I, I kind of like to
liken that to a new constructed
house versus, you know, a
centuries old house.
Um, and the systems that are
involved with that.
Despite the age of our campuses,
uh, our team has been excellent
stewards of our resources. We
maintain 100% performance
rating, um, our last
preventative maintenance plan
was rated as outstanding and our
FMA average is 84%, um, which is
significantly greater than the
70% recommendation in the 71.6%
state average.
Um
I think that this commitment
demonstrates our district's
dedication to maximizing the
lifespan and utility of our
facilities and for context, the
original construction of central
primary school was in 1958.
11 years before we put a man on
the moon.
Um
Whereas, uh Mealta Junior High
was constructed in 1960, 1 year
after the
49th and 50th states joined the
union.
Uh, and while youngest of the
three Nabani Elementary was
built in 1982. Uh, that was
still more than a decade before
the internet became publicly
available.
Uh, and so I think now is the
time to kind of, not only right
size uh some of our facility
needs, but
Considerably update them.
So our proposal is to
consolidate Central Primary
Nabahani and Mesa Alta into two
campuses at the current Mesa
Alta Junior High site.
This new configuration would
include a middle school serving
grades 6 through 8 as opposed to
the current uh 7th and 8th
model, uh, as well as an
elementary school that would be
serving grades 1 through 5. this
consolidation provides a number
of advantages, uh, including,
including right sizing capacity,
uh, by aligning student
populations to the functional
capacities of these schools, we
can reduce vacant classroom, uh,
and improve.
Overall efficiency.
Operational efficiency, uh,
building these campuses adjacent
to one another allows us to
combine facilities, uh,
Shared resources and spaces such
as libraries, cafeterias, common
areas, gymnasiums, resulting in
both immediate and long-term
cost savings.
Um, enhanced modern, uh,
enhanced safety and
modernization, uh, new campus
will allow us to incorporate
updated safety features that are
tailored to current educational
and developmental needs, not
those from 60 years ago.
Um
And then reduced physical
transitions for students, um, a
consolidated campus will lessen
the number of times a student
trans uh uh excuse me, transfers
campuses over their K-12, uh.
Uh, career. So currently in
Bloomfield schools when a
student enters our pre-K
program, they'll remain at the
Bloomfield Early Elementary
campus for pre-K and
kindergarten.
Then they'll transition to
central primary for grades 1
through 3, Naba Ani Elementary
for grades 4 through 6. Mesa
Alta Junior High for grades 7
and 8. And then finally, one of
our high schools where our
comprehensive traditional high
school or alternative.
So they have 5 they currently
have 5 transitions.
this project, uh, which is the
preferred, um, option in our
facilities master plan would
ultimately translate to, again,
not only immediate cost savings
but longitudinal cost savings.
Um, from an immediate
standpoint, uh, it's estimated
that it would actually be a cost
savings of about $5.5 million
and it would allow us to not
overbuild, so we would uh yield
a
A campus that's about 19,000
square feet, smaller than if we
were to rebuild all three of
those campuses individually.
Um, our enrollment data, which
you can see on pages 80 through
82.
Um, demonstrates a, a pretty
steady decline over the past
decade.
Um, again, underscoring the need
to kind of right size our
facilities.
Since 2014, Central Primaries
experienced a 21% decline with
another 30% projected for the
next 5 years.
Um, similarly, Nahani's
enrollment has declined by 26%
with another projected 14% over
the next 5 years.
This is a little bit of an
outlier.
Um, they've only experienced
about a 10% decline in
enrollment and actually has a
projected 2% increase.
Um, but even with that increase,
we sell to operates well below
capacity, um, somewhere in the
neighborhood of about 73, 74%
utilization.
Excuse me.
We've been uh really diligent as
a district in providing safe and
and comfortable learning
environments for our students.
But as of today, central primary
has a total of 68 systems that
are either
Excuse me, that are beyond the
end of life.
So, uh, we also have another
36s.
they're either at or within, uh,
within the next 5 years.
Um, Navalani follows suit with
57 systems beyond end of life
and another 13, uh, either at or
within 5 years of end of life.
And Mesa Alta has a staggering
112 systems beyond end of life.
with an additional 49 either at
or within 5 years. Many of these
systems include foundational,
uh, systems, walls, and several
condition-based weightings that
you'll see, uh, through,
through.
the facts.
And if, if you could, I would
like to direct the council's
attention.
To page 88
your packet uh where you can
literally see daylight through
the cinder block walls.
Of the library at Central.
Uh, primary.
Um, although we beautified it a
little bit, brought in the
sunflowers.
But we do have some significant
structural needs.
Um, as a district, uh, from a
financial standpoint, we're,
we're deeply committed to making
this project viable. Um, our tax
rate has been in excess of 10 mL
since 2015 and in August, our
community authorized a general
obligation bond of
up to $28 million.
Um, with the first sale of that
plan for, uh, January of 25.
We also plan to dedicate 1.5
million of SB9 funds annually
and another 2.5 million uh from
district cash reserves.
If approved, this puts us in a
strange, uh, world where we
actually have to live with 1 ft
in the past and 1 ft in the
future, maintaining the current
facilities while also planning
and constructing the new
facilities. Um, and so in doing
that, we also recognize the need
for us to be pretty prudent.
With our operational cash
reserves, um,
Being able to, you know, replace
the roof that a meteorite fall
on the roof while we're building
the new school, um, but also
taking care of kind of our daily
operational bills. So, um, an
example is that our
district's payroll each month
is, is approaching a million
dollars, um, and we also carry
really large uh
reimbursement-based federal
grants, such as Title One and
the Kenny Bento.
Um
So to that end, uh, our request
in, in the uh replacement
consolidation of these campuses
is for um
Uh, local match reduction for
phase two. We currently have all
the funds to fully fund our
portion of
Phase one, as well as contribute
to phase 2.
Um, and, and I recognize that
it's undoubtedly a big ass.
Um, but this project isn't just
about building. It's about
investing in education.
Uh, specifically the needs for
not only our current students
but our future.
And with that, I, I would.
And for any questions that you
all may have.
Thank you for that presentation.
We'll move to questions.
from
Council members
Yes, Mister Chair
Superintendent, uh, thank you
for your presentation. Um, it
went through it very well, and I
appreciate the financial
analysis that was included.
And one question I had, as you
noted that enrollment will be
declining even more, uh, or
you're projecting over the next
5 years, uh, considering that
the project is a right sizing,
at what point in time would you
be sizing the facilities, uh,
given that projected continued,
uh,
Enrollment decline.
I think that that's a, uh, Mr.
Chair.
Miss Leach, I think that that's
a great question and not
necessarily when I have an
answer to right now. Um, I think
that it's kind of an evolving
model for us. However, it looks
like Ms. Ramos has, uh, uh, some
input for us, but if I could
beforehand, we also have um what
we call a community school in
the community of Blanco, uh, New
Mexico. Uh, it's currently a
grades, it's currently serves
grades 1 through 6.
Um, we suspect that several of
those students will also be
Coming to this new campus as
we've seen across the state when
Farmington High School is new,
they pull some of TV's students
and and vice versa. Uh, so we,
we recognize that there's going
to be a little bit of
fluctuation with regard to just
even the population that we
currently have.
Uh, Ms. Ramos.
members. I was just gonna
mention that.
Typically we always go to the 5
year projection for that.
Thank you.
You
Um,
It just was
Contemplating a
Your
I didn't hear anything about
demolition or what, what, what
are your plans with the
buildings as you, when you
replace them.
Mr. Chair, Mr. Ingram, um,
He caught me.
Uh
Um, obviously, we're, we're
gonna have, uh, two new
buildings, or, or excuse me, two
vacant buildings and one is uh
actually being requested to be
demolished and built at its
current site.
Um, so we would have two vacant
buildings. We're a little early
in this process, uh, to, to make
definitive plans for those
particular buildings, um, but we
do not necessarily plan to
continue to have them house and
serve students.
Um, in fact, at best, we
probably only would retain one
of those properties.
Look to refurbish it for other
purposes, maybe training of
staff.
essentially pre-K services, and
things of that sort.
But we, we don't have any
finalized plans.
No.
Oh
Question. Um, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you for the
presentation. So, on the local
match reduction request.
So you're showing about 32
million. Is that the total you
expect to have available for the
project?
Mr. Chair, yes, ma'am.
OK. Um, and just on the
I, I'm sort of a little
surprised there's not more of a
cost savings from the approach
of building one school versus 3
replacement schools. And I know
these are like very preliminary
numbers, but, you know, it sort
of asked PSFA to look at that,
um, assuming this award is
approved and you guys go
forward, um, you know, just the
cost of like mobilizing 3
different projects I'd expect to
be quite a lot more and.
It sort of looks like the per
square foot cost is actually
higher.
On the 2nd option.
Um, so,
Maybe we can get those numbers
down a little bit more.
A lot of what you see is like
the cough that we
For this projects.
But the long term cost that
you're gonna save.
Hi.
Streamlining all those services
within this.

will help not just.
Yes, you

Construction costs.
Now, the elevated cost as well,
uh, working with visions of
planning, he asked them to.
Also help us consider and how do
we innovate these.
that we're not coming to you and
asking for me.
More money to make these
innovation is possible.
So like, how do we address like
ADA style?
OK
it comes to restrooms.
Or even

How do we, uh, make the impacts

that.
the impacts that we

about our, our classroom.
So just put those things in
place now so that we are
planning and prepping in
advance, that's why we have that
escalator.
Mhm
Again, we don't want to have to
keep coming to you.
I hope in the in the short
amount of time that we uh come
to that we've demonstrated that
we listened to what the vision
of the SCOC was in right sizing.
Making them efficient and
Having buildings that
are, are safe and secure, um,
and then also
Meet the challenge of what we're
here for meeting the needs of
students and doing great things.
I would agree with you. I think
that the cost savings.
It seems a little small. It
seems like it should be uh a lot
higher just from a construction
cost perspective.
I've never built a school
before. Uh, so, so I don't know,
it's just, it, it does seem like
it should be uh a much greater
cost savings. However, the, the
numbers I've provided to you,
uh, actually came directly from
our facilities.
OK, thank you. Um, and yeah, I
would say, you know, generally,
it, you know, it's
It's great to see you, right
sizing the schools individually,
and I think going towards the
consolidating into one, probably
makes a lot of sense for the
district.
So that's good. Um,
Is your community supportive of
That idea. I, I, I, I would say
so. Um.
That's actually the uh
exact platform that we ran our
uh $28 million bond on, um, it's
successfully.
was approved by 66% of voters.
We actually had a greater
turnout in a special mail-in
election that we've ever had,
uh, even with the last general
election.
All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
That's really good to hear and
congratulations on that.
Thank you.
Um
I do have a couple of questions.
Uh, one is um.
Uh, you
What is a comment first on the
numbers on your maintenance, uh.
Activities that those are some
of the highest that I've, I've
heard.
And uh of course, that's one of
our priorities is making sure
that you're taking care of what
you have and it looks like, like
you have these are very old
facilities, but they, they seem
to be working still and.
Um, but we do recognize the need
for, for new facilities.
Uh, the other thing was, uh,
But like the previous question,
how does your community feel
about this? And I wanted to to
put uh president uh based on the
spot and ask him.
If
He wants to

born and raised.
Um

You truly are, um.
I, I will be sure to, to pass
your compliments on to them as
well, but I would be remiss if I
didn't.
Uh, share another quote with
you, and I won't out who told
this, told us this, but uh one
of the uh team members from PSFA
did say, wow, I can't wait to
see what it looks like when you
get a new building, because of
the, the state that you're
current buildings.
We really do take great.
part
Thank you
And I just wanted to make sure
the, the site that you're
proposing, is it the site with
the map in here with the in the
in the yellow area? Correct, uh,
so that is the current location
of Mesa Alta.
In junior high, um, the blue
area is what we currently own,
the yellow area is what we're in
the process of acquiring.
And there's no problems in the
acquisition of that. So far not
yet.
Good.
Well, again, thank you for your
presentation and uh we
appreciate you coming down and.
We look forward to seeing you.
Thank you for having me.
We'll move on.
Mr. Chair and members, one more.
Next up we have silver we have
time for this one?
Should we send it home
hey Will, come back.
Just kidding, just kidding.
Thank you. Go ahead, next up is
Silver Consolidated Schools, um,
care for their application for a
standards based.
Potential project for the full
school replacement of Cliff
Schools, which is currently
ranked number 11.
Just as Bloomfield's, the
district, uh, has sufficient
funding for phase one, but we'll
request a local match reduction
for phase 2.
And with that, I will turn it
over to Superintendent Hawkins
and his team.
Welcome
Did you know?
I, I have to tell you this tie.
I'm a Thai person, I have like
480 of them. I had to reach out
to someone to create me a tie
for my campuses, so I wanted to
stay in line. So it just so
happens.
to
Superintendent's mom, who lives
in the cliff resident, so I, I
expect to see you having a flag
back there,
um, I'm not.
This wonderful presentation is a
product of education in Cliff.
that out
I took credit for that. Did you
see how we did? I got you.
So Mr. Chair and members of the
council, thank you for your time
this morning and giving us the
opportunity, all of us to
present to you the needs of our
schools and our districts in our
community with great pride that
I'm here to sit.
For you finally and have a
conversation about schools. When
I first relocated to Silver. It
was my job to learn the culture,
the community and learn
everything there is to know
about Grant County. Um, when I
went out to Cliff, I was a bit
nervous because it was a
consolidated school district. I
wasn't sure how they um
Interacted, you know, when
you're driving about 29 miles
outside of town, you know,
outside of town. You're not sure
you want to make sure that
everything is meshing well for
the most part, it absolutely is.
It's a wonderful community of,
of uh of resourceful individuals
who have been there for a very
long time. Um, but one of the
things I heard very frequently
every time we turned around as
what are we going to do about
our schools, cliff schools. What
are we going to take care of
cliff schools, um, and likewise
in town I would often hear the
conversation. What are we gonna
do about our schools? We need to
address this need or that need.
or take care of this. So the
course of this presentation,
you'll hear of the culmination
of conversations not only with
our community.
silver, but also our neighbors
and community in cliff and the
need that we needed to do
something about our schools. Um,
I'll go through this present
presentation hopefully can
concisely and clearly I tended
to talk fast if I start to pull
sweat at the top of my head,
you'll.
Just kind of start to fan me and
let me know I'm going too fast.
Um, likewise, just look at me
and do this.
A
Right.
Moving on from page 97 over the
998, uh, I will talk briefly
about the Cliff School's
history, our existing building
information, our enrollment
trends, capacity and needs.
Likewise, I'll give you
information on our financial
data. I am accompanied here with
Michelle McCain, our business
manager.
Antonio Andezola, who is our
director of transportation and
maintenance and Mark Valenzuela
with uh our bond advisor and so.
Hopefully we'll be able to
answer all the questions you
have, um.
Moving forward, ultimately our
request is for a phase one
approval to begin our process in
phase two consideration waiver
match.
The schools, um,
Beautiful place if you've ever
been out there, if you know
anything about cliff, we're a
basketball community just like
much of New Mexico. You've got
Pete Shodale Shock you currently
have, um, Brian Chalk is the
coach. Um, we serve the
surrounding area on this side of
the reserve, the Buckhorn
surrounding area, Glenwood
community as well as the healer,
right? So it's a beautiful area
that also serves students who
are on the outskirts of silver
drive out.
You're a student at Cliff or a
parent or a member of the
community, the cliff, you know
several things. You know that
basketball is where you show up
in the gym every Tuesday or
Thursday or Friday, and we
travel everywhere around the
state. We participate in the
cake auction that raises over
$20,000. We have veterans
programs that honor not only our
local veterans but those in the
regional area.
Um, we host the county fair that
is well attended far and wide.
Um, community, family,
resilience, supportive,
kind-hearted, generous people,
but they're also patient.
Cliff Schools moving on to page
99 was established in 1936, and
in recent years, they were a
fundamental belief that at some
point their school was going to
get the attention it deserved
and being an AD
year old building that has long
since outlived um it's, you
know, original intent.
Um, through a variety of
different circumstances.
We have managed to maintain that
school to the best of our
ability as a district with the
funds we have, but we were never
able to really go in and have
the investment in that community
that they needed to have for
their school until now.
Um, so 1st, 1st, you, you know
that it's 1936, 88 years old.
I'll drop that from time to
time. Um, I know that there was
some statistics as it relates to
the 1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. I
don't think anyone here was
around in 1936, so I don't have
to make up any information. It's
that old.
Um, when we look at the campus
and the number of students it
serves, it serves approximately
181 students. There are 6
permanent buildings out there,
um, as you know, the schools is
ranked 11th, um, but despite the
age of the building and the fact
that it has some significant
standards, uh, needs and systems
issues, it is a spotlight
campus, uh, series of campuses
across the state. We heard from
Corona where we talked about
where they rank at the top of
the state, um, year after year
Cliff is no different.
Small classroom students who are
focused on learning and their
education. Um, you'll notice
that you don't know this here,
but I could tell you every year
schools around the state are
asked to
randomly
Um, take the NAEP test to go
into the average as a
representative of New Mexico.
It's weird to me that that
random selection almost always
exclusively has cliff at the top
of the list. Why?
Those students do it well. They
excel well. They're bright, um,
Moving on to page 100. Now, we
had a facilities master plan um
that was developed, um.
by approximately 55 members of
our community, of parents,
staff, representatives, leaders
of Grant County with the work of
Capital AE to facilitate the
development of this plan. Um, it
was approved and uh this past
spring in May.
It had 5 central elements that
we need to.
Make point of one. We
To right size our elementary
schools to align with the
current projecting uh
enrollment. It seemed to me
there's a trend today in
conversations of declining
enrollment in how we address our
aging buildings and what they
were designed for. Sover schools
is doing the exact same thing.
That's a conversation that we're
currently having.
Um, we also need to really
address the
rebuild of cliff schools. We
also have states and security
needs. We have to upgrade our
bin out to Murano sports
complex. Then we have at least
to try to tackle $22 million
worth of priority 1s and 2
repairs. Those were the target
areas of our facility's master
plan.
If you look at the bottom corner
of the map, if you're on page
100, you can see the outline of
the schools, those in red, or
those immediately identified for
likely um
solution. The side of the campus
is enclosed by a perimeter
fence, but with the buildings
being so spread out around that
campus, um, security remains a
concern, so we've got the age of
the building, we've got
security. There's a a lot of
things in that space that we
need to address. Currently, if
they're in the if that campus
was going to be locked down in
the event of an emergency, it
would be very compliment uh
complicated. And again, just to
point out the obvious here, this
is about 29 miles away from
town.
And you'll find that many
schools in rural New Mexico,
it's important to not only look
at the modernization moving
forward, but also making sure
that you can secure those
spaces.
It's going to 101. I'll start to
go through the next six slides
real quick 101 to 106. I'll just
outline and give you a view of
what it's like to be a Cliff
student or staff member on our
campuses. As you look at the
rock building, the famed.
Rock building right in 1936,
you're going to see an aged
outdoor, outdated exterior,
you'll start to notice as you
walk through the campuses that
our restrooms are relatively
small and cramped, right? They
were not built in a time when
the ADA consideration was a
concern, um, I suspect you had
to be about this then to get
into the restroom and listen to
get into um the those spaces.

Some of these gyms that were
built.
Almost 100 years old, there's a
classic feel and smell that
comes in. Mostly it's not the
smell of asbestos, but um
there's
Definitely a smell of history
when you walk in, um, that's
what we're on the walls,
potential issues with insulation
and energy efficient, that
wasn't a concern back in the
day. Um,
that these are not ADA
compliant, if you can zoom in on
the picture looking at the gym,
you would notice those are
raised to bleachers with stairs
without ramps. Um, so if you're
coming with the wheelchair or if
you're going up, uh, with

they all pose potential hazards.

It was some tough conversations,

We did have a few uh folks who

While we had an overwhelming
support for the global bond, we
fell short because people did

have to go back out this benign,

So SB9 did not pass um at that

OK
you have a thing you want to
122, you can see that just like
A lot of districts, we, we
Yeah, we did see a slight
increase in operational
reserves, but then we also saw
that operational reserves.
They could take over the last
couple of years as contributions
from the publication.
Um
back, for example, we were one
of those, one of those districts
that Doctor Cleveland spoke
about where
we saw Hi in our transportation,
right? Um, and
We saw about $360,000 taken away
from us, um, in July.
360.
Thank you 306. She's a business
person, she gets to know her,
right.
$36,000 and so um with the
months to spare, we had to go to
our, our partners in the
community and say we need you to
continue to transport our kids
with less money, less resources.
You can't fire anybody because
we need all those vessels to
run.
Those are tough conversations
and
To have in a community like
ours. I understand that
declining enrollment is a big
deal.
And the ideas you've got to fill
up those buses, but I love his
analogy of time and distance and

you've got 2 kids on the road or

So the maintenance of those

Likewise, we saw the same hit

Mr.
Oh
Yeah
Don't worry about that just go
by that.
FY 25 lea assistance award.
We have a recommendation from
the awards selling.
overview of the.
Mr. Chair and members, uh, this
is the FY 25 Lese Assistance
awards that, uh, this is a PSDFC
funding program that occurs
annually.
Um, I would like to, um, go over
the motion with you. There are 3
parts of this. The first is to
adjust the memory for the 2023
consumer price index for the
United States, which equated to
3.4%.
Just, um
Yes, if I could turn your
attention on page 127 is to help
me explain.
Um, by adjusting this, uh,
memrate for the CPI. Is that
upward?
I'm sorry.
Adjusted upward to adjust it
upward, yes. OK.
Um, first statute since 2009.
The, um, CPI must be added to
$700 starting in 2009 and
increased annually by that CPI.
This creates the not to exceed
amounts, um, which this year
would equate to $1,022.45. This
is the amount that the PSCFC
could award up to for the
membranes.
Secondly, in the motion, uh, we
have to determine the PSCOC rate
per mem to calculate the least
assistance awards on the same
graph on page 127. This is the
orange line that you see on that
graph. This is the memory that
has been awarded annually that
you can also see in the table
below. These are the dollars per
mm.
I have been ordered each year
and you can also see the
percentage changes that have
occurred over time since FY.
29, and it was, excuse me, F19.
Um, so today,
The first part, the first two
parts of this motion are to
Approved thee not to exceed
amount.
And then to determine the memory
for this year, so that we can do
number 3 to approve the lease
assistance award recommendations
as specified in the detail page
which is on exhibit B on page
128.
Um,
So right now,
Um, the awards subcommittee
approved.
Um, pre-approved and recommended
this with a 0% increase, which
would result in $22771,338.
Um, if I may go through.
Um, the rest of the executive
summary to point out a few.
Um, facts
Um, on page 125 of the executive
summary, there is one charter
school that we are deferring the
award to at this time that is
law academia and the Esperanza.
That is due to the fact that we
have not received the PED
approval letter for their PED
lease purchase agreement
amendment. It is our
understanding that the LPA has
expired, but they have um
An amendments, but we do not
have the LPA approval from PED.
Therefore, we cannot make the
award.
Additionally, one charter school
closed last year, William and
Josephine Dorn, so therefore
they did not apply or receive an
award.
And one charter is no longer
authorized um by the PEC so
therefore it's not eligible to
receive uh a lease assistance
award that is San Diego
Riverside Charter School.
And 2 charter schools moved into
new facilities without approval
as required by statute to
confirm the statute requirements
are met. Um, those are both
collegiate preparatory and
explorer Academy of the.
Which once we learned that they
had relocated through the lease
assistance uh review process.
We have gone and assessed those
two facilities and confirm that
they do meet statute
requirements, um, and have
reconciled with them.
Um, as well as some of you know,
but some of you don't know since
um we have a new council
members. um Lisa's assistance is
determined by calculating two
formulas for each charter
school, the first of which is
based off of men, but we take
the prior years 80 and 120 day
average mam, and then we
multiply that by the uh memory
that we were just speaking to.
And that is used to calculate
the potential award amount and
then we compare that to the base
rents of the lease.
Um, which is also the 2nd.
potential of word of mouth, the
lesser of those two figures is
what is awarded.
um, lastly, just um to note that
in the 2024 legislator
legislature, um, house Bill 207
did pass, which made this
program mandatory, it changed um
in May to a shell, so this is
the only PSCFC funding program
that is now mandatory to the
council.
Um, and with that, Mr. Chair,
um, I think I will stand for
questions or I can provide more
detail or explanation if needed.
that presentation. Did you want
to add anything?
First
Subcommittee discussion.
Uh no, I think Miss Ramos
covered all the details.
My subject here, so.
you
I understand.
I thought um
I don't think San Diego
Riverside is yet it's still.
Right
I strongly advocate for charter
schools.
In this situation
In the charter schools are

I, I know that they're operating

So I want to strongly advocate
for that first.

As was presented before with
these other.

And, and I just feel like
to

They need to have similar at

Is
So, and they are being asked to
do far more with every
legislative session, far more
with the little bit that they
have.
So, I want to strongly advocate
for that.
Um, funding increase for the
increase in the
reimbursement, it only goes up
to the amount of the lease.
So if a
Um
I read 80% of the schools if
they went to the
80% of the schools would be
still paying some money out of
there.
SCG points.
There's money that's leaving the
classroom to pay for.
So
I just want to make that request
and.
Advocate for that position.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um.
I apologize for not asking the
question.
because this is sort of you need
to the, the recommendation to
obviously to increase the
Max allowable amount I guess to
the 3.4. Makes sense. Uh, why,
why the recommendation not
the actual.
Mr. Chair and members
historically, um, and typically
since I've been here 5 years
that I've been running this
program, um, we start
TSCOC starts with a 0% um to the
committee, um, and then from
there, we can increase it on
page 130, we do have potential
scenarios to pick from if
needed, um, but historically PA
started at a baseline 0 and and
waited for the committee to
guide us to a higher number.
Um, additionally, it is
important to note.
That's, um, on page 134, we have
um comparisons of last year's
man versus this year's men and
the percentage change as well as
the least amounts from last year
to this year and in total, we
have 70 charter schools
experienced a 0% change in their
lease amounts and only um.
Overall, there was an average of
13.6%. Those that did experience
increases, it was largely
because they had amendments,
they relocated, they expanded,
um, and for those purposes, um,
so.
For the most part, the lease
amounts have stayed, um,
stagnant.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks,
Eli. Um.
But the, but the least
reimbursement amount or the
least assistance amounts were
never based on what they were,
what they were paying to begin
with, right? So, so whether or
not we
You choose to increase the lease
assistance.
is independent of whether or not
they're.
actually go up.
Um, that is true. It, it's just,
um,
Typically, um, there is
and, and consideration if the
lease amounts did increase per
the CPI for the that previous
year, and that is not the case
overall.
Sure, thank you, Mr. Cha.
Thanks, at least. Yeah, again,
it's new to me.
And so I was just kind of
curious about the recommendation
itself and at what point did the
sort of 00.
are flat footing essentially.
When did that start? what was
the rationale?
Uh, Mr. Chair and members as, as
we did speak about in um
Subcommittee
It has been, um,
Since this program has existed,
it has not been the primary
mission of the PSCOC council. It
is not a capital.
Outweigh, um, it is to
supplement the funding for
charter schools. It was never
intended to fully support the,
the lease amounts for charter
schools. Um, however, the
charter schools have a
dependency on this program due
to their, their high lease
amounts and they um length that
this program has existed.
And, and so it is the primary
funding source for these charter
schools to fund their leases.
Um, however, over time,
especially in lean times when
the PSCOC did not have um large
Funding sources, um, there were
a few years we didn't make.
Any or um
Any awards, um, and the, the
lease assistance, um, stayed,
um, stagnant, due to that fact,
um, but we did continue to make.
those lease payments.
Thank you, Mr. Cha, thank you,
um.
Again, this is
relatively new to me.
As far as actual school
districts, um,
Do you know if they're, they're
actually paying leases if school
districts are also paying some
buildings that they generally
own.
in their building.
Um, Mr. Chair and members, we do
have quite a number of charter
schools at least from.
School districts.
Um, and in those instances, most
of the school districts
stipulate in the least amount
that the uh lease.
Excuse me, they stipulate in
their lease that the least
amount will be based purely on
what they are awarded from the
PSCOC so they're not charging a
specific dollar amount, um, I am
There's only one district school
that has applied for.
Lease assistance that is Roswell
for the early college high
school. We do not know of any
other district schools or
districts that are.
Leasing facilities for school
purposes or sub leasing.
facilities to charge.
Yes, thank you. uh, thanks,
Lisa. I guess the reason I asked
the question again, I'm I'm just
learning about it, but um,
Mr. Ingham's point, if school
districts aren't leasing.
Buildings, right? Not, not
leasing out buildings to other
people like charter schools,
leasing buildings for use.
Um, that's a, that's a cost
they're not incurring, although
they have other.
Associated with
I guess I'm just just trying to
understand the dynamic and how
these assistants.
Plays into how this districts
are able and charter schools are
able to use their operational
funds to its way. I don't know
enough about the relationship of
lease payments to charter
schools incur.
Versus the
You know, similar to the
transportation.
Discussion we had earlier,
you're having to supplement your
lease.
Payments with operational,
that's money that.
I use it
I guess I just, I
No.
We're gonna have a motion here
in a minute. I would just ask
staff.
have
A little bit more research about
some of those, those issues for
future discussions because I
think
The the idea that we start with
just because leases aren't
haven't gone up or because they
haven't gone up substantially,
we're not going to recommend.
Increasing the lease amount or
lease assistance amount.
Doesn't because they're not
really related at.
to me
Just, just a little bit more
research.
you.
Um this one is not.
And now with the
Nervous. It would be able to.
It's
game.
Um,
So now I think
As well as
now.
OK
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Cha. Thank
you, I, I just, I just, I guess,
I guess I'll say one last thing
is.
Um
Again being very need to process
all the processes.
idea that
Funding facilities for students
in any school.
The priority
One
It doesn't quite make sense to
me either. I understand the lean
times of being able to, you
know, in lean times we can't
build new schools either.
That still what we want to do.
So how we support students and
facilities.
Imagine that's a, that's a
priority regardless of.
And Mr. Chair and members, Mr.
Senna, I do have um the answer
to some of the questions that
you did ask last week. Um, we
have
Two charter schools, the, the
lease assistants, um,
There's less than 25% of the
lease covered by the award, only
2.
I'm 28, it's between 25 and 50%
of the lease is covered by the
award.
29, it's between 50 and 75% of
the lease covered by award, 11
between 75 and 99% of the lease
assistance for the lease is
covered by the award in 100% is
at 33%.
That, uh
Uh, how many of the
Charter
s are with private.
entities.
versus public
Mr. Sharon members, we have 23
charters in uh private
facilities, 28 in public.
agree with the foundation and 51
with a lease purchase agreement.
The lease-purchase agreements
have really increased over the
last couple of years.
At least purchase enables them
to come to.
councils. Those numbers have
changed over the years.
I remember when
This award was 15 million.
To 22 million.
this point. So there has been a
steady increase over the years.
In the council and staff have
been cautious as we move
forward.
The other thing I wanted to
mention is there are several.
school districts that are
leasing property.
may not be coming to.
to the fund.
But uh,
The district that I was in.
see.
and land.
No.
In
But again
I've seen
The assistance roll and that's
not to say that it shouldn't
continue to grow.
Especially now that it's
mandated, but even though it
wasn't mandated before there was
never a year that we didn't find
it, so.
language helps.
Maybe it gives us a.
opportunity
uh
we've seen that.
Was there any other questions?
We've heard the motion.
Those in favor of approving.
So.
right now is.
that portion of it.
I can see that it has.
Look at age 127 again.
All those in favor of approving
the
subcommittee motion, please
indicate by city.
Thank you.
We'll
earlier
And
We can't finish,
Out of cycle awards with 2 of
them.
A twin booths Looney High
School.
Albuquerque preschool for the
New Mexico.
for the devil.
If Mr. Ficklin and Mr. Parks
large important project.
Hey
Mr. Cha members um like to start
off, uh, this is a request from
um Zuni Public Schools for twin
buttes.
High school, Zuni high school.
Uh, Zuni Middle school, um, I'll
go ahead and read the motion,
council approval to amend the
current standards based award
language to ZUY public schools
for ZUY Middle School, Zuni High
School, and twin buttes.
High school to include
construction phase funding
totaling $115496,323 for a
consolidated replacement
facility totaling 109,200 gross
square foot.
581 students, grades 7 through
12, um, and that that comes with
the state match of
$115,496,00323.
Um, the district gives
requesting um construction phase
funding for uh consolidated
replacement facility for 100 and
13,146 Gross square footage.
Um, PSFA staff.
Um, is recommending, uh, uh,
construction phase funded for
109,200 gross square foot out of
that 10013.
Uh, just some key points here,
uh, kind of get through it here,
um.
Uh, this replacement facility
will allow the district to right
size the middle school
facilities and allow for better
utilization at the elementary
schools.
Um, this facility, uh, will
consolidate the existing middle
school, existing Zuni high
school and existing twin buttes
high school into one singles
consolidated facility.
Currently, uh, Zuni Middle
School serves grades 6 through
8.
Um, and those 6th graders want
this new facility is completed,
we'll move back to zoo.
Uh, that will move back to ZUI
Elementary School.
Um
Therefore, increasing the
utilization of the elementary
school.
Um
And then let's see, there is uh
a little bit of above allowable
square footage that we, uh, uh,
that PSFA staff deemed above
allowable, which I'm sure Mister
Romine here in a minute will
speak to that that extra space,
um.
But we could justify some space
that was over a rid the original
amount awarded and that uh that
space.
Uh, basically lies in the sub
cultural classrooms, some CTE
space, a little bit larger
administrative because you're
serving multiple grade levels as
opposed to one,
And with that, um,
Mr. Chair members, I will stand
for any questions. Oh, by the
way, this, this one came in
fairly expensive at $9262 a
square foot.
Um, which is in line
geographically with the area and
what we're seeing in cost right
now and with that,
Uh, Mr. Martin Martin Roma, um,
and I and Ryan Parks will stand.
Mister Roma.
Yeah
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, thank you for having
us this afternoon, accompanying
me today are Mister Clayton
Caltoa of our board.
Mr. Matthews Snyder, our project
manager from Jane's Corporation
and the project estimator, Ms.
Candice Yazi also from Jane's
Corporation. We're grateful to
finally be here for final
funding. I know that this is the
3rd phase of funding for this
project.
As I was mentioned before when
we first came to this committee
with the idea of this project
was to.
Right sizes of the schools as we
had a lot of excess space in two
buildings that were in dire need
of being replaced. They were in
the, obviously in the top 100
and also to efficiently use the
space that we have, the one item
that I would like to address is
the difference between the
district requested square
footage and the PSFA
recommended, which is basically
the difference, the difference
is basically
Bleacher space for what has been
referred to as a secondary or
auxiliary gem but is actually
Zuni Middle School gym. It is a
competition, gym, as we bring
these two.
Are these three, schools
together.
There will be or the basketball
season, 5 boys teams and 5 girls
teams. There will be occasions
where we will have.
All 10 team or we'll have.
Basketball games going on for
the high school teams and the
middle school teams on the same
night in the same facility.
If we
If, if PSCOC approves the square
footage without the bleacher
space, then we will not have
bleachers for those middle
school games that happened to
that happen on the same nights
as the high school games. It is
not a secondary or auxiliary
gymnasium as some have
considered it is actually
learning space it is will be
that it will be the PE classroom
for, for the middle school, uh,
students as well as their
competition.
Gymnasium
As I say, when we brought this
project forward, it was to make
efficient use of the, of the
school building as we had excess
space in the other two
buildings, but it is also to
Maximize and bring together and
and.
Make efficient use of uh of
staff.
So I would ask the uh this
committee to consider the
district's original ask,
including the square footage for
the bleachers at the middle
school gym as it is actually a
competition gym and not just a
practice gym or secondary
auxiliary gym.
Uh, if there are any questions
from the committee for me from
board members C Ooa or from our
contractors from James
Corporation, we will stand for
for questions at this time.
Thank you for that. Anything you
want.
Before we go to question
Uh
Mr. Chair, I think these two
gentlemen covered everything,
but I, I will just say that um,
You know, we did
We did scrub the, the, the
documents, um, and make sure
that we turned over every stone
to, to make our recommendation
for approval.
Um
The, the two gymnasiums as this
is a combination school, they
are um
Allowed, if you will, to a
middle school gym and a high
school gym.
Um, based on the combo school
criteria. Um, so we understand
that part definitely where we
got into a little bit of the
snag in the bleacher space was,
um, it's just over what the
adequacy planning guide
calculates that we can
Um
Make a recommendation for. And
so that's why staff
Uh, decided to, to make that
recommendation not to support
that 3900 ft. We understand, um,
and we hear all the time that
They, they need that capacity
for those athletic programs, um,
but as many of you on the
council know.
Um, we, we grapple with
athletics versus educational
delivery, and that is the
dilemma that staff found
themselves in for this extra
square footage.
However, um, for, for the above
allowable spaces.
Um
from the original gross square
footage as Mr. Fickle pointed
out.
These are um very valid spaces
and in fact,
as you're all aware, we are
updating the adequacy standards
and eventually the adequacy
planning guide.
this increase in square footage
falls in line.
With the trend that we are going
to be recommending to this
council, um, for square footage.
Increases about 10%, 10 to 15%
in schools.
And that's why we feel good
about making this recommendation
for the um square footage over
the original 97,000.
Let me ask a follow up there.
With the change
Would it help the
The gym portion.
Mr. Chair,
Um, Mr. Chair, some of the items
that we, excuse me, that we
agree with our um
Do have to do more with.
The, the gym, the, the locker
rooms for middle school and high
school coaches offices, storage,
those were the, those were the
items that we heard in our um.
And our public
Meetings on the adequacy
standards, of course, every
district, uh,
did say we need big, we need
bigger gems, we need bigger
bleacher space and um
wholeheartedly understand that.
Uh, but again, it's, it's that
balance of athletics versus
educational delivery that we
We as PSFA staff, I think
struggle with.
Um, making a recommendation for
increased bleacher space.
So that, uh, again, my question
was with the change in the
adequacy standards address that.
Mr. Turno
Yeah.
Let me whipping it up for
questions and.
The additional leisure space.
What's the
A different.
And will the district be, will
you be moving forward with the
extra
Bleacher space
Because you think it's a
priority and we'll just figure
out how to use your impact date
for it or what.
Uh, Mr. Chair, Mr. Seli.
At this point we have had that
discussion, but we were waiting
till after this meeting to make
a final decision if we decide to
continue with it, we would.
We would look and see about cash
flow.
Projections to make sure that we
would have impact aid money
coming in to cover that in the
time frame of the construction.
Or we would, we would consider
possibly eliminating that, that
uh square footage from the
building. We just wanted to wait
till after this meeting was
completed to to make a final
decision there.
Mr. Chair
Do we have an idea about how
much
Because extra bleacher space
means larger roof space, right?
Larger footprints. So like
what's the
How much are we talking about?
Mr. Chair, members based off of
the square footage as a whole in
the percentage of the above,
it's a uh the the percentage of
the, the square footage above.
It's about you know like how
many.
scenes.
Mr. Chat's roughly 800 seats. I
think it's 765 was the number,
if I remember correctly.
And staff recommended him.
Um, it's based on the adequacy
planning guide and I don't have
the exact number, but it's
almost, it's almost half of what
the bleacher space um proposed
in the, in the drawing.
Could you tell us
On page 146.
You have a list of
Uh, did, uh
alternates or additions.
This includes bleachers and a
lower rates.
Maybe
I have several things that are
above adequacy. Let me uh.
Cedar that page. I have not seen
that one yet.
Uh, we have looked at all of
these above allowable, there was
a larger list.
Uh, we did accept each of these
bidlos and the district does
have the uh the cash on hand to
cover the additional bid lots uh
on this page.
We are
Went through these
With the
Design team
I discussed them as a as a uh
leadership team in the district,
the ones we did not want, we,
we, uh, rejected and the bid
lots that are listed here, we
have agreed to already and as I
say, we do have the funding in
place for them already.
And this includes bleachers. uh,
the bleachers, gymnasium
bleachers and bid lot number 9
were.
bleachers for the high school
competition gym.
We are
At the time did not know that
this issue with the bleachers at
the middle school gym would come
up, so we did not and they were
not included in the mid lots.
Um
This
Lists that cost at 220,000. The
amount you said for the middle
school was.
Um
Mr. Chair, so I think this is
this bid lot is probably for the
bleachers themselves, not for
the, the building that would
house the bleachers in it. So
that's where that 2.220 he is
correct. That is just additional
bleachers, not additional square
footage.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh this is
sort of a hypothetical, cause I
know this is a combined campus.
Estimates are based on.
Is that right? Like there's a,
there's a different set of
measurements that we're using
for a combined camps. If these
were two different.
schools
Middle and high school.
Would that change the situation?
Like would we actually allow?
The same amount that they're
asking for in terms.
Spatial this based on just the
standard.
Mr. Chair, uh, Mr. Sanna,
that's, that's a great question.
Um, so,
They would have the same amount
of bleacher space because we
took the total population and
multiplied it by
calculation in order to come up
with what's allowed for the
adequacy planning guide.
Um, it would change things if
you had separate schools.
Um
Just
The sheer nature um of a combo
school, you get
You get those efficiencies of of
use of space of the cafeteria.
that kind of thing, but no, no
sir, not for the
Bleacher space in particular.
Other questions a quick a quick
question, so, so with the
bleachers, the square footage
would be 113, 146.
Mr. Chair, Mr. Romero, that's
correct.
Romero, there was um 837 square
foot that was deemed in the
drawings above allowable
already.
So it would actually be.
113 minus 837, so 112 something.
63.
Mr. Chair, 112163.
And the added
Aust was 2.5.
Mr. Chair, Mr. Romero, that is
correct.
That's just a guesstimate for my
so.
Thank you.
No question.
in terms of the current.
Gymnasiums that are in Houston.
This is uh
Will they continue to be used?
I assume there's enough are you
referring to the gymnasiums at
the current high school and the
current middle school.
Plans for the, for the current
high school is that building is
in poor enough shape that it
will be demolished.
It, uh, they're just.
We, we, we, we asked the
question about perhaps saving
the gymnasium, and they said
that that portion of the
building was in the worst shape
of the entire building. It has
some wall separations and it's,
it's not salvageable. The Sunni
Middle School, the plan is to
convert that building.
Into student housing.
Zuni does not have a what you
would consider it on the street
homeless population.
When you look at the uh actual
title of homeless it's people
that don't live with their
actual families. We have a large
population that fits that mold
that we have students that don't
know from one night to the next
sometimes where they're going to
be sleeping.
And we have talked about turning
the Zuni Middle School into a
into a student housing building
to meet that homeless need.
In many cases, districts find
ways to keep their gymnasiums,
uh, even though we're.
Replacing but uh
again, yeah, you have other
plans for that.
Um
I would suggest in in terms of.
This issue
That
You indicated that you the.
The board would make a decision,
you report member here.
Down the line in terms of enough
revenues to take care of that
yourself.
In addition to these other items
that.
Decided
To approve.
With the local funds.
So I would suggest that maybe
Take a look at the resources
down the line.
This will be a, you know, maybe
a few months before you.
You have to make that decision
hard and fast.
But uh and possibly come back at
that time, that work for you?
Chairman McGee and members of
the committee, we can, we can
accommodate that request, yes.
Something that you know.
I was not
Not all of us are present at the
award subcommittee when those
discussions are held, but.
What I see is a Mister Chairman.
So this school is being built
for less than 600 students
across 6th grades.
Yes, that's correct.
So for like the middle school.
Athletic needs.
for
Less than 200 students per 7th
and 8th grade.
Yes
And we need a gymnasium that
would accommodate.
765 people.
Chair, Mr. Chair, Mr. Sali.
I am honestly not sure where
they, how they design team came
up with those numbers, uh.
I do know that we get a good
turnout for for um middle school
games probably about 765.
So
It's possible that we could
downsize.
That space and the number of
bleachers.
I
I believe PD funds 1.5.
percent of the student body, so,
uh, we'd be looking at
downsizing to maybe 30 seat 300
in there.
So, that's just
Something for, I spend a lot of
time in gyms, but I also have a
hard time figuring out like how
many people like.
Reasonably accommodate versus
uncomfortably accommodate to.
But uh I think that's important
for us to all recognize the
The important role that sports
do play in academic.
Program.
What role it plays in some
communities in an outsized way,
including a.
Cooney.
Something that like the chair
said, we can.
Potentially revisit, but I think
for that amount of money, maybe
if it's really a priority,
something that we looked at the
district and see.
How you like to approach that.
Mr. Chair, members of the
committee, if I might.
Uh, I will be meeting with the
design team in a meeting with
district different matter
tomorrow.
Um, I will visit with them
about.
Aligning the footprint of that
auxiliary gym.
To see the 300.
300 spectators and see that, see
how that affects everything, and
we could bring that back to the
council at that time to see uh.
To seek
Funny if that's what we need to
do.
I think that's important,
especially because uh hopefully
there's recognition that
We're kind of front running the
new adequacy standards with this
project, not trying to hold it
up.
we really see that there's
additional space, we've
accommodated.
For things that in the past.
Supported on the flip side of
this.
So it's not as if
staff aren't coming forward with
the recommendation.
Being innovative and and forward
looking.
Trying to accommodate space that
As we
And with that, Mr. Chairman, if
you're ready for.
Yes.
So I
Um
Move that the council approve
the amended current
standards-based award language
to the Zuni.
public schools for Zuni Middle,
Zuni High.
Twins Buttes High School include
the construction phase funding.
Totaling 115.
496 323 for consolidated.
To 109,000.
Gross square feet for 581
students.
grade 7 through 12 state match.
115 million.
6
2 $3.
100%.
OK
Is there a second to the amended
motion?
in a second.
Any further discussion.
All those in favor of approving
the amended motion, please
indicate by saying I. I.
was a post
S jerky and members of the
committee, thank you very much.
on the agenda is.
Turkey Preschool.
school for the deaf.
harden us while we shuffle, Mr.
Chair.
And we have a motion from the
uh.
Subcommittee.
Mr. Chair, members, thank you.
Um, so first off, I'd like to
introduce Jennifer Herba the.
Superintendent of New Mexico
School for the Deaf.
Um
With her as her interpreters.
So I'm still learning this or
how we uh communicate, so, uh, I
think it's gone pretty good
today, but.
I'll go ahead and start off, uh,
this, uh, request is for
additional construction funding.
To procure the design
professional services for a
replacement facility.
I
I
read the out in council approval
in the current pre-kindergarten
award to New Mexico School for
the Deaf.
the Albuquerque Preschool
facility in to include
additional design phase funding
for replacement facility
totaling 30,000 gross square
feet.
With a state match of 835,000 in
the local match of 835,000 for a
total of 1.6 million.
On completion design phase work,
the district may return to the
PSCOC for an out of cycle
construction phase.
Finding
The district is requesting
funding to procure design
professional.
Services or uh MPSFA staff
recommends participation.
An additional design based
funding.
From this, this school has a
program.
Uh, uh, has programmed a
replacement facility totaling
about 30,000 gross square foot.
Um,
The district's preventative
maintenance plan is, is
currently not correct, um, but
I, I have spoke with DSFA
maintenance team and
are working with the district
maintenance staff.
get the PM plan updated.
And we hope to have that um
before we come back.
Um, and then just, uh, real
quick, I think, uh, base this
request off of $500 a square
foot, uh, because that's the
cost we're seeing around the.
Metropolitan area.
I'm pretty hopeful that it'll
come in at 400 or 40.
But, um, just to be a realistic,
we, we set that at $500 per
foot.
That, Mr. Chair, members all
stand.
Welcome.
Oh
Is there anything that you would
like to add to that person?
Mr. Chair, members of the
council.
Uh, not much to add, uh, we're
just in the divi the design
funding phase. Um, but with New
Mexico, uh, HED capital outlay,
PSCOC and PSFA funding.
we're able to move forward
through the stages and we've
gone through, uh, before we
thought it was gonna be very
minor renovations, and now we've
moved on to expanding the
preschool. We've actually
doubled in numbers, uh, in terms
of our student population and
our adequacy standards, we're
not there at all at this point,
far below, increasing number of
students that were serving,
we're really proud of, and it's
not just the Albuquerque area,
it's Los Lunas, Berlin,
Edgewood, Rio Rancho, of course,
Albuquerque as well, that's
where our children, our babies
are coming from, but.
Just a big thank you for your
continued.
say that the council has always
valued this project.
Because it serves the the
youngest.
Of our children
And uh makes it a lot easier and
more proxim.
Questions.
Um
Hey, good to see you.
Um

Is the project had in
discussions with citing the new
facility. I know that.
You're next door to some APS
land and you're going to engage
in conversations with

This will come out during the
design phase of figuring out
where exactly the site is and
but can you tell the council a
little bit about

You're a little bit confined to

some cooperation.
Certainly.
Mr. Chair, members of the
council.
Yes, really, the original vision
was to stay where we are now,
but with that comes its own
issues where we would put the
kids while we were demolishing
the building.
And whether or not the current
site is adequate for the size of
students that we now need in
terms of parking and playground
space, etc.
Um, so there's a variety of
challenges that we faced in
that, in thinking through that.
We have 3 options right now, and
that's where we really need to
design professional to help us
analyze.
So there is a little bit of
property that's next to, it
belongs to APS. Um, we're not
sure if we could negotiate with
them to be able to use some of
that property.
Um, we could stay where we are
in the same footprint, or we
could move completely to a new
location.
We do have some small property
that belongs to the New Mexico
School for the Deaf from way,
way back.
And we're hoping to be able to
sell that property to then
purchase the land if we need to.
So some studies certainly needs
to be done, but we can't do that
without the design professional
to help us analyze all those
options.
I think that's just important
background for the.
counsel to know why.
The stages of funding is.
So important
The other thing that the
subcommittee talked about is
Um
School for the Deaf, not sure
about the school. The special
schools like had in the past
like a match requirement.
That essentially just required
them to get money from the state
from a different.
But
Me, it's just like the color of
money is slightly different, but
it's still coming out of from
the state. And
It's, I think, held up projects.
caused a lot of confusion for
difficulties for the school.
For this one what we talked
about was the

That part of the motion, but I
did want to just bring it up for

in the project.

something.
I think it's something we need
to have a discussion on the

Ready to
lunch?
Mr. Chair, now.
Look at a few more
We still have
several.
OK.
So
Well, again, thank you for being
here to present.
And all those in favor of the
subcommittee motion.
For this project, please
indicate by saying I.

Motion passes and
congratulations and we.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Thank you.
We're uh down to other business.
And there's a couple of, I guess
3 items on there.
We do need to run a timeline
for.
Item B
Because one of our members needs
to leave, but if we can talk
about the annual report quickly,
we maybe we can do.
Absolutely, Mr.
Chair,
committee members.
Everybody's doing well. I hear
your stomach's rumbling. Item 7A
regarding the draft PSCOC and a
report.
is presented as a handout.
This afternoon.
And I won't go into the motion
yet. I'll just give a brief
overview.
New Mexico State statute by
December 15th of each year, the
council shall prepare a report
summarizing the activities and
milestones achieved for the for
the prior fiscal year.
Since 2004, the PSFA has
diligently prepared an annual
report, articulating performance
data-driven milestones in the
areas of funding funded
construction projects both
complete and in progress.
The annual report also includes
mile maintenance information,
broadband information. It is
presented to you this afternoon
as a draft.
like your input absolutely, uh.
red pin it up and get the
information back to us, we'd be
excited to make the adjustments.
and move forward with the
quality and
a report, I stand for any
questions.
the first.
Look, it looks nice.
Questions?
Mr. Chair, I'm Larry, we need to
act. This is an action though,
correct?
Yes ma'am,
it is,
yeah, and I noticed in the
booklet that we don't have any
uh uh emotion, but I can give
that motion for him. So AMS
motion is to approve the uh
FY 2024 annual report for the
public school Capital LA Council
and public school facilities

to staff to make any final
corrections or changes, uh,
based on input from the council
members, uh, or any other
corrections that they identify

discussions or questions.
You want to set up a
A deadline for comments.
Uh, Mr. Chair, I would defer to
Larry on when they report is due
in December 15th.
I would guess in the next my
recommendation would be within
the next 3 weeks if you could
please provide input, uh,
recommendations to either Iris
Romero or executor or myself,
that'd be more helpful December
7th 8th.
December
December 7th. Yes, sir.
Right.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
All right.
Move on to local match reduction
process.
Well, there's been a lot of
work.
thought put into this so.
OK
Subcommittee motion.
Yes, Mr. Chair, so, um, the AMS
subcommittee is um.
Uh, make has moved, we're uh
recommending the PSCOC, uh, may
consider a district's bond
adviser Mill levy data and
projections to determine if the
district has made a good faith
effort to use all of its local
resources in order to grant a
local match reduction to a
school district when awarded
PSCOC funding. Um, a few
comments on this, if I may, Mr.
Chair. So, uh, as part of the
work, as you recall the last
year was some discussion around
whether, um, you know, the PED
uh certified mill, uh, levy
data.
was necessary uh in making
determinations on waivers with
the concerns brought up at that
time that that could create
delays for the school districts.
We had a lot of uh good
conversation. Um, I met with
PED, uh, representatives, uh.
Um, in the interim on this
matter, and then we also
requested a legal um analysis
from uh Mona with PSFA. Take a
look at the statutory language
and determine kind of what our
options are given that language.
And a few things that came out
of that was that, um,
First off, um, while the mill by
PED is the best to be able to
utilize. The timing isn't always
going to work for the school
districts as they come forward
for waivers for phase 2. So, um,
in looking at the analysis, uh,
on the statue, ECOC does have
flexibility to utilize another
mill source, including the bond
advisor data.
Uh, we also did some additional
review or PSFA staff did some
additional review of PED on, um,
you know,
Previous awards that were made
using the BondAdvisor data
versus what the mills actually
came in when PED certified, and
all of them were at or above the
10 mL, so you know, the bond
advisor data does seem to be
tracking. I think there was one
instance where that data didn't,
that came in below 10, but it
was due to a factor that the
school district couldn't
control, and I know, uh,
director Romero will kind of
mention that a little bit more.
But also the other um uh piece
in the statue that was
compelling to AMS was uh
language around the good faith
effort for a district to meet,
uh, we, uh, you know, in the
statute, we do need to look at
the mill, um.
Great, we do need to look at
several other factors as I know
uh staff have presented before,
but it is, um, the PSCOC's
destruction, discretion to make
sure that we're evaluating the
effort of the school district in
making that. So those were the
two pieces that we really
evaluated that foundation that
staff continue to utilize uh the
um.
The bond advisor data when it's
necessary because of timing
issues, uh, that being said, I
think I would recommend too that
we ensure that we're still
gathering the mill, uh, levy
data, uh, certified rates from
PED in September and doing an
analysis of where those mills
came in, uh, for those projects
that.
Um, for which, uh, the, uh, uh,
bond advisor data was used.
And with that, uh, Mr. Chair,
I'll defer to Director Romero
for any additional actor from
the district is that yield to
that or piggy backing off and.
District is coming for a waiver
to see continue watching that
and so we're we're not just
disregarding that.
we're still gonna
