We go on. Um
and I think we'll go to introductions
first, so we
have a forum to continue.
So let's start off.
Let's let's go start here
with them.
Representative Roberty
Ker.
>> Good morning, madam,
chair, vice chair,
members of the committee

Uh
Thank you madam chair. I'm
Representative MEREDITH Dixon
from House district
20 which is the
southeast corner
of Albuquerque. Thank

Bobby J Gonzalez

Senate District 12. Uh
after the
elections,
Senate district 12 moves
up to Rio
Rancho, half in Rio Rancho,
half in Taylor Ranch
or something like that. Some,
one of those far distant
areas that
uh will be a
very different district from where it's
been in the past. But, uh,
it, the district 12 has been
cut up into six pieces
and I think this particular
piece will be a part
of Senate district
13.
>> Thank you, Senator. All

of us and all of our districts. I

Ok, so
madam chair with you your permission,
I'll go ahead and uh give you the
updates uh and
things that have happened since
we last met on November
the uh the ninth of
2023.
Uh So it'll be just
a very high level
overview. Uh We will
not uh cover a lot of the
details. We'll cover those over the
next five meetings, but I'll give
you some uh information
at this point. Uh
The New Mexico Housing
Trust Fund uh
uh give you an update
on that all the
2023
funds. Uh
and I'm sorry, madam chair,
those are not in your packet.
These are just some verbal
comments that I'm making and I'll
refer you to the packet here in a little
bit as we're going through it.
Um.
>> Oh,
ok. I'll do it again.
Thank you

nice. Thank you.
Um, I'm Nancy,
Senator Nancy Rodriguez.

committee for 29 years
too. And so
Senator Gonzalez and I have
seen it
and I'm happy to be here.
Many of you may have heard. I will
be retired after the first of the
year. Um
almost three decades in the
Senate. And I thought if I
do another four, I'll
be 34 years.
I don't know.
So I decided this
is a good time for me and my
family. So
starting January 1st
quickly, I
will be having a cup of
coffee and not having to look at my
schedule. I hope.
Thank you very much. Thank
you, Mr Vice
Chair. Thank you madam >> chair and thank you
Mr Vice Chair. Uh
So a quick update on
Mexico Housing Trust
Fund. Uh
We received the first
installment, if you will of
funds for the reoccurring
funds uh in
July of 2023
wanted to report
to you that 100% of
those funds and that was
$37.5
million have been procured
for uh we've issued
procurement documents for those we've
awarded uh with
the uh support of our
board, 82% of
those funds and we are currently
at 25%
expenditures
um with regard
to the 2024 housing
trust fund of.
We are expecting
about $34 million that
will become available on July
1st. Uh
Our board just this last meeting
already started forward
allocating to a couple of
activities for next
year's funds. Uh
The demand is there and the need is
great. And so we've already
forward allocated on
uh some rental
uh activities, some
weatherization and also some
manufactured housing
activities. Uh That's
the recurring part of
it. Uh I
do want to say that our board
also uh just this last month
approved the allocation of
the uh $50
million. Uh That
was the one time
highest amount of funds that we
received into the housing first
fund. Thank you very much for
your support and I'll mention a little bit
more of that to here in a little
bit. Uh
I was also talking a representative
case here a little bit. She was
attended a, a groundbreaking
for a development uh in
Rio Rancho uh not
too long ago. Uh
That is one of 52
different developments that we
have active projects that are
going on across the state.
Uh That's close to
4500
rental uh
units uh places
that people will call home uh
for them located
in 27 municipalities
and 18 counties across the
state. The total
development cost of all of
those 52 developments
that I just mentioned is over
$1.1
billion. Uh
100 853
million of combined funding
from M fa into those developments.
And uh in large portion,
a lot of those to the housing trust. And so
I want to thank you there.
Uh not only is it
providing uh homes
uh for families,
but there's also the economic
impact that those have
525 million
in a very conservative numbers
of economic impact and
over 7000 jobs that, that
will create,
uh, on the single-family
production. The,
uh, programs
that we're mostly known for
are homeownership programs.
We are way ahead of last
year's uh, production.
Uh At this point in this fiscal
year, we've already reserved
close to 2000
loans this year.
Uh We're averaging
over $13 million
in reservations on a
weekly basis compared to
last year at 9.6
million. So,
uh, in large part, due to the
below market interest rates that we
have, we average about
uh 50 to 75
basis points below the
market. And,
uh, thanks in large part to the
housing trust fund, we're also
offering downpayment assistance
of $10,000.
Uh, and that's attracting a lot of
folks to our developments or
our or our programs.
Uh,
we, uh, had a
program that was funded by the federal
government called the
Homeownership Assistance
Fund for folks that had fallen
behind on their mortgages,
uh, due to COVID,
uh, happy to report
that we've assisted over
4500 families with
that program and
expended. Uh,
but $47
million that program did
close a couple of months ago. We're just
now processing the,
the applications that have come
in. Uh, but
that program is for
all intents and purposes
closed and want
to thank staff for all the hard work they did
over the last two years. And that administering
that program
also, it's part of your reference
manual and you should have it in front of you.
I'll just give you a quick highlight. This
is our annual report
that we published a couple of months ago
from last year.
Um just hit the
very high
level uh
highlights here. It's
uh over 19,000
families that were served
with $585
million and 3700
homes were produced, financed or
preserved. Uh
I also want to inform you
that in large part to
our policy and planning
folks and our folks
in uh the departments,
we realize that there's a great need
out there and we've been very aggressive
at pursuing other funding
right now. We have applications
in that total about 100 and
$50 million
in competitive applications.
We're hopeful that we can get even if
we get half of that amount.
Uh It'll be great for us to
be able to uh get
those funds in and be able to
serve uh
those range from uh
whethers to manufactured
housing. Uh
So more to follow on
that as the applications
are due and get closed and
announcements are made,
uh, our intent for
this year, uh, and I'll close
it with this is that, uh,
we plan on covering the full
continuum of housing
from homelessness to homeownership
and give you highlights at every one
of the meetings that we have and
also bring some partners in for
that. Uh, we'll
update you on a monthly basis
on the housing trust fund and how
that's doing. And we'll also
give you production
highlights uh on a
regular basis that I'll, that I'll
bring to the committee
uh the agenda
for today. Uh
We'll in right after this
uh pending any questions that
you may have. We'll introduce our
staff. Uh Then
I'll briefly go over the reference
manual that you have in front of
you. Uh
Jeff and Donna will give you an
overview of the housing
programs and then we
have a Monai Silver with a new
Mexico coalition to end homelessness.
We'll give you an update on
homelessness.
Uh and then we'll go
over the interim committee procedures
and adoption of the work plan.
So madam chair with that, I yield
to any questions that you or the committee
members may
have
>> what we do. Representative,
we have a new person
joining us here.
Representative.
>> Thank you, Senator
Representative
an
No,
>> sorry.
>> Thank you very much. And yes,
and then we've got um
Representative Borrego
for a question or comment and
then we've got Senator Ortiz
Pino >> just a very quick
question, madam
chair.
Sorry.
So my question is
um the trust fund,
is it only state money?
Does the city,
any of the municipalities
put into that
fund,
>> madam chair and Representative
Borrego, it is a state
funding. Uh the
municipalities uh
do not contribute
to those funds, although we do
leverage those funds
with funds that they have and
other federal resources as
well.
>> Is that it? Representative?
Yes, sure. Senator,
what is? >> Thank you madam chairman
and thank you Mr Hernandez.
The, my question has to do
with, I
think we, we've expanded
the purposes to
which you might expend the
money in the
trust fund to include housing
renovation. Is that going
on yet or is that still in the
future
>> madam chair and Senator or
Tip Pino? You are correct.
It did get expanded and
includes housing
rehab and we are
currently doing some of that with those
funds. That is
correct.
>> And thank you just to,
to what extent, how much have you done
this year? Is it just,
just getting started or have you done quite
a bit? >> Uh It's just
kind of getting started. Uh Senator
Madam chair and uh and senator,
we have
a three different
programs that we're working with right
now. One of them is our
uh there
are some areas in the state where we
don't have partners. Uh
And we, our business
uh model has us working
through partners across the
state to deliver at the local level.
Uh But in some areas, we don't have
some partners to deliver the rehab
program. So we
created a, an
internal department to help us
with that. It's called the housing
Programs on the
eastern part of the state is a pilot
program. So we've
often, I think we have a 10
to 15 applications
in the pipeline that are currently getting
evaluated. We have
funding uh some
weatherization and
energy efficiency improvements
with the uh the money
don't have those details. In front of me,
but I will have that to you
for the next meeting. I'll
provide you an update
on all the rehab money
that have been expended or
actually the, the total housing
trust fund. But those are two
examples of where the money is
going.
>> Thank you, Senator. If I may elaborate
a little bit on that on it, only
because I was a sponsor of the bill
when we did expand it and
we expanded also the
need. We, we allowed
the housing trust fund to
be um allocated
based on specific
need. For example,
before there was some
broadness to that and
we wanted to make sure that it went
to the places that were
the highest in need, of course.
And so that's clear now.
And um anyway, just
wanted to elaborate. Thank you
uh Izzy for that. Thank
you, Senator. Anything else?
Ok.
Then I think we can move
on um easy
to the next
item. >> Thank you
madam chair. So now we have uh
introductions of
a key staff. So I'll introduce
uh some of the key staff and then
there are the chiefs are going to
also introduce the, the
directors that are here present
and those that may not be.
So I'll start with uh
Anna Maestas Deri

up. Anyway, stand

I'll tell you about here in a little bit
and she's been with us for four
years next
to her. We have uh actually on
the other side, there is we have
Dottie Bose.
She

about nine months. She

Compliance and
Initiatives department.
And Julie has been here

amazing job. My whole team
is doing an amazing job, but
I have Kelly Tillerson

development. She's been here
one year and
then we have Christy

legislative oversight. I feel
lucky in order to introduce
my direct reports to you

been upholding with
100% dedication
every day and this

>> Right.
>> Thank you madam, chair
members of the committee. I,

let me just turn around. I'll
start at this
end. We have George
Maestas. He
is the, the director of
Housing Development that
that group deals
mainly with uh multifamily
uh financing.
And I think most
of us have been here about the same amount
of time, just a little over seven
years.
Uh Renee Acuna
who is the director
of our housing
or homeownership department.
Uh His group deals
with uh helping uh
uh first time homebuyers
and others to purchase
homes and, and uh
create gene generational
wealth. And uh
Renee has also been here. He was
hired just a few months ahead of
me about uh it's about
7.5 years, 7.5
years
ago.
And then um
we also have
the, our director,
uh senior
director of
of it, uh
Joseph
Navrati. And
he's not here in this meeting
today, but he is
uh he and his team are
key in making sure that
everything runs smoothly here
from a technological standpoint
and they protect
us from bad
actors out there.
And then uh also uh
who someone who's out
of the office is
uh Olivia Martinez
and she is the director
of our secondary
market department and
they are tasked with the
selling and
securitizing the loans
that we purchase from lenders
out into the secondary market,
which allows us
to be able to provide
uh funding for down payment
assistance uh to
the folks who are trying
to get into their first homes.
So that's our
group. >> Ok, thank
you, Jeff. Um
I do you have anyone
else >> you? Thank you madam
chair. We wanted to introduce our
staff here, representative of the
various departments, we have
100 and 27
employees and these
are the the leadership for all
of those departments and some of those
directors that were introduced
will be presenting to you over the
next few meetings that
we have. So thank you for the
opportunity to introduce
them to you. >> Thank you
to you and all the staff for the
great work that you do. Truly,
I've gotten a chance if I may just
barge in here for a moment,
I've gotten an opportunity
to truly
see the hard
work, the committed
work and the competent work
that you do for housing
with the limited resources you have
had in the past,
you have done so
much and
considering that the need
for housing and
uh rehab and and just
more help for people in general
with the housing
industry and so on. You
have done marvelous work
and I want you to know. I appreciate that
very much. Thank you.
All right. And before I go on, I
do have a note before me
here that um our staff
passed on to me
and um it says,
would you mind making an announcement,
asking all members
uh to remember
to use their microphones?
It is important. We use them for
that people who have to use close
cap on the
webcast. Uh Some
people can't hear or
they just, they
don't hear it clearly or they have
hearing impairments or whatever it
may be just so that we make
sure we have the
our words and our
presentations clear.
And uh so I'll
do my very best to
remember to turn mine
on always. Thank you.
All right.
>> Thank you madam chair. The next agenda
item that we have is going over this
uh reference binder
here. Uh
I'm just gonna take a few minutes
to highlight some things on here.
So not to worry,
I'm not gonna go into detail in
it. Uh So
you'll notice that the table of contents
right before tab
one.
So it has the Mortgage
Finance Authority, the Oversight
committee members. So you'll see your
name listed on there.
Um Behind
Tab two is
the Mortgage Finance Authority
Act. Uh
as you'll notice in there when
you and you, this is something that you can
take with you and keep a reference
for later on. We are
created in
1975
So our 50th anniversary
uh is coming up uh next
year and we're planning
a, a big celebration and I hope
that you can make it to that uh
more information to
go out as well as we get closer on
the planning there.
Um Also
one of the, it
highlights in here that we have
seven board members. I'll mention those
a little bit later creates
our oversight committee.
Uh It also designates
uh em fa
as a state housing
agency that uh was
done back in
1998.
Uh It also has M
fa as the trustee
for the Housing Trust Fund,
gives us oversight of
the Regional Housing Act and
the Affordable Housing Act.
Uh and also the trustee for
the Land Title Trust
Fund. Uh So
those are some of the highlights of the
act.
Uh behind
Tab three is the rules and
regulations.
Uh These rules
and regulations are brought before
you every year for
review and potential
updates. So we'll see
that before the end of our
last meeting this
year.
We also included in here,
the Affordable Housing Act and the
Regional Housing Act, which I
mentioned earlier
there behind Tabs four and
five just for your
reference uh
behind tab six
as a reminder that was our
legislative agenda for this
last session that just passed
in uh January of
2024. We
had two legislative
items uh that,
that this committee endorsed,
one of them was for $500
million for the housing Trust
fund. Uh
Well, we didn't get a $500
million. We did get $50
million and that was the
biggest or the largest
one time allocation to the
housing trust fund. So
I want to thank you for your support
there. Uh We
also had a bill for
$500,000 for the
Affordable Housing Act. Uh That
one was not successful at
obtaining any
funding.
The behind tab
seven, you'll see the M
fa board of
directors,
seven members there. You know
the three ex officio
members, uh which is
the lieutenant governor, the attorney
general and the state
treasurer, the governor
appoints four other members.
We have an Reyes from
Taos. Some of you are very familiar
with him, the president
of Citino Bank.
We have Derek Waldo, he's
our vice chair and he's the
chief, the CEO
of Aran Risk.
Um We
have, uh if you turn the
page, we have Rebecca
Wurzburger. She's a strategic
planning consultant from Santa
Fe. And then
the last one is a
Patricia Sullivan, a
phd and associate
dean from New Mexico State
University.
So that's behind Tab
seven,
uh behind Tab
eight. You'll see uh em
fa s uh uh
leadership and the folks
that I just introduced to you. And
we also have a
uh an
organizational chart that is
behind that.
Tab
behind Tab nine
is the annual report
for this last year. I just
made some highlights a little
bit earlier. So we won't go through
that. Uh
behind Tab 10
is the M fa strategic
plan uh we
have a uh five
year strategic plan that is
ending at the end of this year. So
we are right at the
beginning stages of uh
creating our new
strategic plan with the
input and surveys that we're
sending out and getting
our board input, doing a
swot analysis and an enterprise
risk management.
That plan currently
contains five goals
and 30 different benchmarks.
You may recall that on an annual
basis, we bring to you the
benchmarks that we have
in our status that obtaining
some of those. And we'll do that before
the end of this year as well
to give you an update on
that. Um
The next
tab which is TAB 11 is a
new Mexico Housing
strategy strategy.
An executive summary,
if you will recall,
we convened about two
years ago, a 19 member
advisory committee to help us put
that plan together
that spanned the full
scope of uh the housing
continuum from homelessness to
homeownership uh
and from different parts of the
state. What
we did is we did
a comprehensive look at all of the
housing needs across the state,
comprehensive look at all the
resources that are available.
Uh And then obviously,
there was a a gap between
the needs and the resources
uh much more need than there is
resources. And then we
came up with strategies to fill
those needs and some
of it was uh getting recurring
funding into the Housing Trust
fund. So thank you. For that. And
there's several other strategies
there as well that are being implemented
and we'll provide you an
update on that.
Um
The next uh sl uh
tab is TAB
12. That is
a summary of the audits that we
received. You'll see that we have
over a dozen audits on an
annual basis. Uh,
that coincides with
over 40 different funding
sources that we have. And as you know,
all the funding agencies
want to make sure that we're using the money
appropriately. And so uh
we are a heavily
audited agency
and I'm happy to report that we have
worked 30 years of
unmodified
audits.
Uh Chap 13 has a
housing continuum. I'm not going to
go over that because in a moment
that Jeff and Don are gonna cover
the housing Continuum.
Uh I will
uh direct you to
Tab 14,
which is the MA S
funding sources.
We have over 45
different funding
sources. Uh Some
of them are federal funding
sources that I'll cover here in a
little bit. We have the
state funding sources.
We have uh ma
sources that we put into our
housing opportunity funding and we
also have some private
uh funding
sources as well on
that particular uh Tab
14, you'll see a pie chart
there that uh if you add all
of the pieces of the pie up,
they add up to uh
$997
million. The following
page gives you the details
of the funding sources
that we have uh in each
of those areas.
Uh One thing
that I do want to highlight as an
example would be at the
very top of the private
activity bond cap.
It mentions tax exempt
multifamily revenue bonds,
multifamily, those are
not direct funds that ma has
control over. Although we do
issue the bonds and some of those
multifamily development
uh properties,
some of them are actually issued
by the local governments. So
uh Santa Fe and Bernalillo County
are examples of that. So that's not
all money that actually passes
through uh through M
fa and you'll see the
detail there of all the other
funding sources with
the longest list coming from
the federal government. And then the
state list has grown
quite a bit as well over the last
couple of
years.
The next slide
or a tab is tab
15. These are the federal
funding sources.
Uh There are
four different federal
agencies that we receive funding
from. The one
with the most funding
sources is hud
uh and we
receive about $34
million from
hud on an annual basis.
Uh We also have some department
of energy funding for a
Weatherization program.
Uh Some funding for
the uh
uh health
and human services. That's the light
heap money that comes into the state
and some of it gets diverted to us
for our energy efficiency
program. And then we
also have uh some
funding from the treasury,
which is for the tax credits and
the mortgage revenue bonds that we are
able to issue. And that's
where some of the authority
comes in that, that we have is to
issue those bonds and
allocate the tax
credits.
The next
slide or a tab, sorry
is uh 16.
Uh 1 of the things
that, uh
sometimes we get criticized
for is for
uh, uh allocating
all of the funds uh to
the urban areas or
versus the rural areas.
Uh That is more of a myth
than uh the actual,
you'll see here with the low-income
housing tax credits as an
example, uh the
majority of the funds go to
rural areas. It's not
by design, it's just, it so
happens that that's where the need is
and the uh
projects or the developments
that uh that score higher are
being awarded. So you'll
see there behind Tab
16. Uh
If you look at the top
of the page towards the
far right, you'll
see that on the
9% tax
credits,
48%
of almost 49% go to
the urban areas
and a little over
51% go to the
rural areas.
So that's just an indication
of where the money is going. And
there's a lot of detail here and all
of those developments across the
state uh to show
you where all of those developments are
going across the state. Uh
So good uh
dispersion uh and
making sure that we hit every corner
of the state and not just the,
the the metro areas.
Uh and the last one, madam
chair is uh Tab
17 and that's just
the housing acronyms
and glossary of terms. We
tend to use a little bit different
terminology here at M fa
sometimes. So I wanted
to make those available
to you so that you, you can
refer to them as you need. And
as we make our presentations
over the year, we'll try to use
as little acronyms as
possible. But if we
miss some, please do
uh do ask us a question
or refer to the binder here
to, to clarify
madam chair with uh that
I'll uh take any questions
you may have on this reference binder.
>> Thank you very much is a good
job. Um Are
there any questions? Yes, we've
got Senator
Padilla and then Senator
Ortiz Pino so
far. That's it. Thank you,
>> Senator. Thank you madam
chair and thank you and thank you
to the staff and everybody's just
working really, really hard
on
away from this a little bit. So I
can
we anyone's ear out,
excuse me.
So, excellent
planning documents and
information. Do
we have a data or a
current set of
data or will we be presented
with data on like with
the housing shortages in New
Mexico for
2024
as we go into the
midyear
>> uh madam chair and Senator
Padilla, we are uh at
the I'll,
I'll ask Robin here.
We are currently, uh putting
our housing needs assessment
together or updating it
from the plan that we have from
two years ago and it should
be completed here pretty soon. And we
will be presenting.
Do you mind Robin? Uh,
giving us an update on
that.
>> Yes, madam chair and
Senator. Um, we
have the housing needs assessment
is being updated and it will be
available. Um,
maybe not
by the next meeting, but by the third
meeting, I think we're anticipating pre
presenting it. Um
and it will also be published on the
M fa website. >> Uh
Thank you madam chair
and uh uh Izzy
and, and thank you very much for the
the update there. So uh can
you just give us the highlights? What will it
include? Is it gonna include
just affordable housing data and
information which is highly
important? But will it be
the comprehensive in terms of,
you know, everything, workforce housing,
what we're missing in
regions and things of that
nature? >> Uh Yes,
madam chair, Senator Padilla, it'll
be a comprehensive look
at the state.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair.
Just to make sure that we have that top of
mind and we're always looking at that. Thank
you. >> Thank you,
Senator Senator Dizz
Pino. Thank >> you madam chairman
and, and thank you Izzie for running
through all of this.
Uh This
is the first time though I think
I I had ever
fixed on those
tax exempt
the private activity bond
caps. And I,
and I wondered if you could just
explain those a little more.
Uh, for example,
uh, this is in
tab 14, uh,
the, the second page
of that cap. Um,
who sets those
amounts if it's
capped? Where do those caps
come from? And,
and is there any way
of
a, or
do we need to help them?
Iii
I, I'm really fuzzy on,
on what they are and where they come
from and what they
do.
>> Thank you, madam chair and
Senator Ortiz Pino.
Uh The private activity bond
cap is set by the US
Treasury and it's a function
of the population
uh in the state. Uh
It comes to uh State
Board of Finance and State Board
of Finance then further
allocates within
the state. Uh em
fa has the authority to
issue tax exempt bonds. But we
need the private activity bond
cap uh
allocated to us to be able to
do that. And State Board of Finance
gives us that bond cap
uh on the single
family side, on the
multifamily side, uh
it's also usable for
that and
some of that gets allocated
or set aside for multifamily
M fa issues some of those
bonds. But as I mentioned earlier,
some of the local governments
uh if they have a development
in their county, Bernalillo County
is an example. Uh
they have the ability to issue
those tax exempt bonds as well and they
go to the State Board of Finance
uh and request
that similar to what we do on the
multifamily. Uh
I will say that
uh the bond
cap that we have here in the
state has
traditionally been
sufficient for
our needs. Uh
However, uh there
are other states that their
bond cap runs out
and they don't have sufficient bond
cap. Uh And when
it comes to multifamily,
uh some of those developers now
are coming to New Mexico
to because it's not
a what they call a bond
constrained state
like some other states are. So
we're seeing a lot more activity
uh hence the 52 developments
that we have uh at different
stages of construction.
So we are starting to
become a, a bond
constrained state
where we would need
to uh potentially
start making some of the
uh multifamily
bond issues a little competitive
or uh the allocations
of those bonds competitive to make
sure that we have
enough allocation to go
around. And >> madam
chairman and, and then
the, the
uh US
Treasury,
where do they,
where do they come up with? The
figure? The total
figure of which our, ours
is a based on our
population.
Is that, is
that an appropriation from Congress
or where does that come from?
>> Uh Madam chair
and Senator TC Pino. That
is a good question. Uh I don't
know if it's an allocation. We'll, we'll
find the answer to that and I'll get it to
you. I'm not sure that big
picture if it's a
congressional allocation, if it's
something that's in the budget, just,
uh, that's on a
reoccurring basis, I'll, I'll find
out for you. >> Ok.
Uh,
thank you. So, our tax,
the, the,
um, the
tax exemption, the,
the tax credit financing that
the amount we have
is based on
that
>> uh madam
chair and, and, or tip
pino. So there are two different.
Uh, I want to
make sure we don't get confused. So the low income
housing tax credits are separate
and apart from the bond cap,
separate, separate and apart
from the bond cap and those are allocated,
we get about 6.1
million which equates
to $61 million on
an annual basis,
uh, that we
allocate. Uh,
and those are also based
on uh, population
for the, for the state,
but that's, it's
tax credit for rental
development. The private
activity bond cap is separate
and apart from that,
uh, and
one of the benefits, uh, I'll
give you an example on the single-family
side or homeownership
program, we are able
to issue tax exempt
bonds. The
investors in those bonds are
willing to accept a lower yield
on those bonds because they don't have to pay
taxes on them. So we
can borrow cheaper than
say a bank can borrow. We
pass those savings on to
our first time homebuyers,
uh, and offer below
market interest rates. Uh, and
that's one of the main benefits
along with our downpayment systems,
uh, for our homeownership
programs. I, I hope
that addresses the
question. >> Thank you. Thank you very
much, madam chairman. >> Thank
you, Senator.
Ok. Uh, we have
Representative >> Kate
next. >> Uh, thank
you, chair and, and thank you for your
presentation. I'm just
gonna follow back up with, uh,
Senator Padilla's, uh,
line of questions. Sorry,
Robin, you may have to come up.
Um So,
uh when we get our housing
needs assessment,
it sounds like
it would be most likely in
July or August.
Um I'm assuming
that the needs
are uh
providing us demographics
such as household income
maybe by age or
race. Is it
by um
occupation or
work force
such as
educators,
engineers, medical
providers,
>> Robin? You're
it.
>> Thank you very much.
>> Thank
you.
Thank you madam
chair.
Um
So, one of the
issues that I was talking to
earlier with,
with um this
beautiful young lady in front of
you um
was
the gap financing
for
um
when, when a project
is being proposed
and I had this issue on,
on my side of town. Actually,
when I was in city
council
um madam chair,
um we,
we were able to run the
numbers for some property
that we were trying to develop some
affordable senior
housing um
around Sebola Loop
area. And
um we ran the
numbers through,
you know, the city and hud
and through you
guys several
times, but there was
a gap and
we couldn't meet that gap.
And so the project
wasn't, we couldn't initiate
it. And so I'm just
wondering um
what
is available
and if
there's a way that we can start
to look at filling that
gap
for. And I know this
is more developer driven,
but I think it's
important because
I mean, obviously they're the
ones that are putting
their resources into
it. So I'm
just wondering if, if that's
something that you guys have thought
about
madam chair and the
representative.
Um Thank you madam chair.
And uh yeah, probably
we, you know, I was,
this is a couple of
years ago. It's like three years
ago when we ran those
numbers. Um and
we were working with Rick Heon
in the city, but
that was a big
issue madam chair
and members is
that, you know, we
couldn't build
that development
because
of that gap financing
that was not um
available to
us. So
thank you. >> Thank you
for that. You know, many
times we just
failed to see those little
holes, those little gaps
that inhibit our ability
to fulfill the the mission
we're we're going for right,
develop housing.
And so thank you for bringing
that up. Thanks Susy. All
right,
good morning again to both of
you. >> I see you often
here. >> Thank
you.
Thank you. I was
on this >> other
narrow one. Thank
you.
Great. >> Thank you
very
much.
Posture just
ain.
It happens. Yeah,
thank you representative. No
worries. It happens
>> broken.
So.
Thank you. Uh The
New Mexico Energy Smart
Program is part of
the Nationwide Weatherization
Assistance program.
Um It's administered and
funded by the Department of
Energy. Um
New Mexico's Weatherization
program is considered
one of the best in the nation.
Um The program
provides energy savings
measures and home repairs
for health and safety reasons
and they're provided at no
cost to
the occupants.
Um In it at
ma what we do is
we layer the funding.
Um So we
include the Department of
Energy Funds, the Low
income Home Energy
Assistance program funding
New Mexico Gas, PNM,
El Paso Electric,
Otero electric, and
also some New Mexico Housing
Trust funds.
Um The WAP
Emergency
FRF again,
this was funding that
we used to get
homes ready to weatherize.
There's some things
like roofs or
windows that
the doe funds won't
cover because they don't have a
measurable, they can't
measure the effect.
So, um we use this
FRF funding for that and we
also use some of the New Mexico Housing
Trust funds for that those
weatherization
um the Homeowner Assistance
Fund, um this
was the funding that Izzy mentioned
it was through Treasury.
Um This was COVID
funding and it provided
assistance with delinquencies
and mortgage payments, property
tax and insurance.
And the homeowners had to
experience a hardship
that was due to COVID.
Um Again, we
are almost, the
funding is almost spent. We
spent over $48
million and assisted
over 4500
families. The application
portals closed and we're
just kind of spending the last of that
money but very
successful.
Um Next
slide.
And so these are some
other programs that
um M FA offers and I'll
just move on to the next
slide to describe
them um
the emergency housing
needs. So this
is a new program and
it's for us to be
able to respond
to emergency housing
situations very
quickly. Um
Some of the funding was New Mexico
Housing Trust Fund or our general fund
for this. So
uh most of the federal funding,
as you know, has a lot of restrictions.
So we wanted to have some
funding where we could move
quickly and help people in
various um
emergency situations,
the state and local fiscal
recovery funds. Um
This was through
treasury and
it allowed state uh
local government,
tribal governments um
to respond to the severe
economic impact resulting
from the pandemic.
Um These funds have been
expended
and next
slide please.
Our Housing Innovations
Program um This
again is funded by New
Mexico Housing Trust Funds
and it addresses housing
needs that are currently not
being served through other
M fa programs.
So it allows um
various entities to apply
for funding if they have innovative
ideas or
if they need assistance with something
that our other
funding can't provide. So
this has been really
great. Um
Also congressional community
project funding
and it's for fire affected
counties and that
includes Colfax,
Lincoln, Moura
Sandoval, San
Miguel, and Valencia.
And the funding supports
fire victims with construction
of housing rehabilitation
and support
services.
>> OK. So the next
slide uh
concludes our presentation,
there's some production highlights from
last year.
Um You know,
almost 19,000
New Mexicans served
in over 40
programs. So this took a
while to go through. But uh as
you can see, there's a lot of things that
are going on and
we're happy to answer any questions
that you might have.
>> Thank you, my goodness.
Thank you very much there
so much. The m does
many programs. I feel
like an infant even after almost
30 years here and I still
learn every time I come.
Thank you very much. All
righty. Uh We're gonna go
on to questions or comments
from the committee. Senator Gonzalez,
you are first and
then we, we got
Representative Lujan
and if you introduce yourself
when you speak in a minute,
that would be great. Um
And so then we've got
Representative C Rodal
Cerro. Thank you,
Sandra Gonzalez.
>> Oh, thank you madam
chair and thank you vice
chair.
Oh, I guess
so. You know, when I
look at the
presentation,
I just look at everything, you know,
from the directors
to your comments
to uh what
has been brought to us. And
uh and as I
mentioned at the very beginning,
you know, with a number of years
that I have been here and
I have really seen us like
from here to like being
here. And
I think there's probably
within the
last 5 to 10 years
that we have a
overall,
you know, that big awareness
for homeless and, you
know, the home improvement and
loans and everything
to bring to
where the
request that was for
500 million to the
trust fund and receiving 50
million. And
I hope that we just continue,
you know, with bringing
more because I think
there's more support now than we
have ever had before.
You know, I really see and you really
have a very strong
board uh with
that, I was just gonna ask a
couple of things. Um
and this is, uh Jeff,
uh when you were
talking about
the introduction of your
staff, you
mentioned one and
you said something about,
uh I didn't quite catch,
it was so
II I know if it's a
department or a
person
to
protect bad, bad
actors
and, and maybe if you could just
tell us a little bit more on
that >> I chair
and Senator, I was referring
to our Director
of Information
Technology or
Technology
and uh we
have to be very careful
uh in
protecting the
information that we
have from people
who would try to
um
to uh
infiltrate
our, our uh data and information
here. So that's a very
important part of what ma
does we have all these programs
that we're administering for
housing. But
yet there, there are also
some, some great
things done uh
by departments who
are maybe not as
directly involved with
the, the lending and
the, and the servicing
of uh loans
and, and uh
and housing.
>> But, um, thank you. Uh
I uh I
really see that because,
you know, in today's world,
you know, and, and
other agencies within
the state and government
that are,
you know, taking so much
proactive into working
with this and, and I guess
there's no end, you know, there's
just has to be
something that we just continue
to build on and to be stronger,
to resist
that, you know, to,
for, for that protection. Thank
you. Um The
next question that I was gonna ask
you and it's right here
at the very end on
the community project
for fires affected
counties.
Oh, guess
what I'm seeing is
so as
a state as we go
forward,
you know, we have
done a lot with
this,
but I really
see with a
condition that we
are, you
know, with the dryness and the
drought and serving
that this eventually will come
like a permanent department,
a permanent
setting that we work
with and
because we never know when it's gonna
hit and where, you know,
so,
uh, I really feel that
we really need to build
on that, you know, a lot
more
and be
as prepared as we
can and I don't know how much
we can do that, but
it just keeps growing. You know,
now as we are
today, there's a
numerous new
fires which
will have an effect
and then, uh, were just starting
the season.
>> Madam chair Senator
Gonzalez. Absolutely. This
is congressional funding, but we'll
see what happens in the future.
And also a big issue is
homeowners insurance. You
know, in California, a lot
of uh insurance
companies are leaving the
state. And
so with the
increase in fires that
that could become an issue here
as well.
>> I uh madam
Chero, thank
you for that, but I, I think it's
already here.
You know, we already have members
that are experiencing
no, some kind of a
communication with her insurance
company of not
continuing them or
different things happening.
But as a state,
we really need to step
up also big
time. And
with that all, thank you and thank
you for your work. Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you. Thank you,
Senator. Always. Where the
wisdom? Um
ok, we're gonna go on
to Representative Luhan
just joined us and
you can introduce yourself and then you may
have comments or questions representative.
Thank >> you. Thank you madam
chair. Uh, represent Harry Luhan.
I, I represent uh
house district 48 in
the capital city and
very happy to be here. I want to
thank uh M
fa for all the work that they do.
And
ma'am sure I've been
on this
committee since I started
and I've
learned so much and, and there's so
many things going on
that affect
the programs and everything that you
do. But your
longevity and the things that you
have produced
have
um been
very fruitful and productive
for our state. So I want to thank you for
that. Uh My
questions go a little bit uh
deeper dive when we're looking
at policies and
we're looking at programs and putting them
all together and the layering
those, those effects
of those programs for our
housing. And
in Santa Fe, we just
had uh
an initiative from the city that
was on the ballot last year,
that was just got a ruling from
um uh
from the judge
that it's, it was
not, I believe
constitutional or was
not able to be move
forward anyway. And
that was with the tax initiative
for housing. Um
So we are looking for
solutions all over the
place. And one
of the things that we have in our local
governments in, in
Santa Fe, particularly
um stay
focus is language
when we have developers
coming in. And that
language has the language
fee in lieu of
now, there was an initiative and
to amend some of that
uh for some of the development
that was going on in Santa fe
particularly in my district
which I supported.
And I want to know when
we are doing all these programs,
we have all these, you have to
contend with all these
programs that then go into
and affect local
governments.
Obviously, you're having a an
easier time in our rural areas
because like
you said that the, the
scale or the
um the scaling of
that is easier when you're
dealing with um
areas like Santa Fe and even
in Bernalillo, and you run
into these issues where we have
that type of language
that then allows for
developers and industry to come
in. And then we are not seeing
the full effect of the amount
of money that we have because
in reality, we have
a lot of money, but we
don't have all the resources
to build and develop
and that is really a big
problem and concern for us
all. And I'm wondering how you
are dealing with that madam
chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Jeff. You want to
take a stab at that
or Donna, I'll take >> a, I'll
take a stab and then maybe
Izzy can help us out.
But
um
madam chair and
representative,
we, we
do, we
do uh rely on the
developers,
the developers that we
typically deal with
for the affordable
projects that we
uh finance
are,
are
used to the
to the ins and outs of the
various communities
that they're working in.
And uh so
we, we really rely on
them to be able to navigate
that for us.
Um But
uh it is a, it is
a difficulty and a concern
that we don't have enough
developers out
there.
>> Madam chair Representative Lujan.
Thank you for the question. It
is challenging because every
local government or
municipality has
a different challenges.
Uh So we
rely on the developers to, to
know the landscape there and in areas
where we uh where we can,
we, we help. Uh I
will uh let
you know that uh you'll be very happy
to hear that. Uh You mentioned
the low income housing tax credits
uh awards that were
made uh just
a couple of weeks ago, our board
approved five
developments, two of
those were in Santa Fe with
Mr Ed Romero.
So there's some progress being done.
There's obviously more need than
what's happening
in Santa Fe or across the state.
Uh And there's some
challenges that some uh
localities will face
with regard to planning and zoning
and some of the things that you mentioned
there with that legislation
or maybe initiatives
that were passed in
our maybe
having to backtrack
a little bit. >> I
have one more question. Thank you madam
chair. I appreciate those answers because we do
know that the challenges with the
zoning as you mentioned as well. Those are the
real things that are really
inhibiting and creating
barriers as well.
And we need to, we need to be focused
on that um
madam chair when we have
all these programs again and the
layering that we do with them,
do you prioritize
those, that those
programs that or those
um mechanisms
say, for instance, if they, they
get this one loan,
then that um
advances them to get this
and that and so forth if that
makes sense, so that they're
layering in
some kind of prioritization.
Um So that
um funding
and everything is, is being utilized
efficiently, madam
chair.
>> Thank you.
Thank you, representative. Can we
just make our answers a little
bit more shorter only
because I've got
123456
probably? Ok.
>> Thank you and representative,
thank you. We do
try to use the match
the funding sources to
the to the need.
So we have money
coming from different sources and
we'll, we'll some
projects might need uh
this type of funding more
than another. So we do try
to, to prioritize
those >> and I'll
talk a little bit more about you, maybe
even creating a type of a carrot,
like if you're able to secure this,
then you're gonna move into this. And
it's very clear that
those, those are the securities
and, and the funding are, are
reached. Thank you madam
chair. >> Thank you
representative and thank you
staff for
that.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank you very
much for your um thorough
report. I
have um
three questions.
They
not too complicated.
The first is, uh,
and I'm hearing this quite
a bit. I hear it all the
time. We're
having um an aging
population
that is not
able to keep up with
uh the mortgages
or are being forced
into homelessness,
um,
homelessness
in our cultural tradition,
of course, doesn't mean out in the
streets that means that
they're losing their homes and
they're then going
back to living with family
and extended family.
So that's a
problem. So I'm interested
in knowing my first
question. Um
Do you have, have
you conducted studies, do you
have data
that um
indicate
uh that this is
happening? And how
many aging or
seniors do we have
that have lost their home
and that are homeless? Do you
have anything of that
nature?
>> Madam? Chair,
Representative Roybal
Caballero, our, our statewide
housing strategy does
have that information. It
does show that there
is an increase of
seniors. Um
There are quite a few of
the 9% light teet projects
that are just senior projects.
But as far as the
details, I would have to refer
to Robin to see
how detailed that information
is
>> Robin. Thank
>> you >> madam
chair and Representative
Roberto. So I think
when we present our housing needs
assessment, we can definitely,
and we'll plan to do that in July because
it seems to be a topic of, of
interest here, but we can
um sort of hone in on the,
the senior population.
Um and we don't,
um you know, while
data and reports are important
for us to understand the depth of the problem,
we know that it's happening
um anecdotally and we
see, you know, we see the
results of people
that um are on
a fixed income and
cannot keep
up with the rising rents.
Um We did have
a groundbreaking
um here in Albuquerque
uh last week or the week before
on a senior project
that will provide um
affordable housing for
seniors and
um those units stay
affordable for 40
years. So you don't have to
worry if you move in that your
rents are gonna increase
and that's where we see
um that
and other initiatives that other people
are undertaking to
meet the needs that we're
seeing with our
seniors.
>> Um Thank you for that and
sort of correlate it. We all
know that housing is probably
one of the most critical
problems crisis.
We're in a housing crisis.
That's um
without any doubt we're
in that have been in that
for a long time. It's been
kind of gradually
going up. So related
to that perhaps
is um
the foreclosure rates.
Um How are those
correlated? How
or can we correlate the
foreclosure rates with
that aging population
because something has to happen to their
homes, they're losing their
homes. Uh The family
members can't pick up
the additional mortgage they're
doing, they're barely two or
three families living together,
barely keeping up with the mortgages
that they currently have
and they can't afford to
pick up their parents or whomever
is aging
out of their for uh
properties.
So
is,
I guess we
need to look at
how we can correlate
that information
and that would be very helpful for
us if we one time,
several years back. I don't remember
how far back um
we were provided with
lists foreclosure rates
per district
and that would be very helpful to
us and that have the
demographics
related to the
foreclosure. Was it what
age group? Was it a young first
time buyers where
you know what all
of the correlated information
demographically that we
can associate with the
foreclosure rates per district
would be very, very helpful for us.
So that was my
second, the third
and final question
has to do with
um the
discussion we had prior
and it and is about the
developers.
So I know that
there's private
for profit developers
and then we have nonprofit developers,
we have those that are
community development
conscious developers
which are very different from
just your general
developers. And
Representative Bredo and
I are real familiar with
that because we come from the
School of Public Administration
at U and M that focuses
on having
community conscious
developers. Do
you, can you tell me how
many of those
nonprofit developers you're
working with? And
what projects and around
the and, and,
and um
uh how they're
reflected around the state. And
if you can't tell me that right
now, um
perhaps you can give us
that information later. Thank
you,
>> madam, chair
representative.
We uh I don't know
off the top of my head, but we do have that
information on
our website. Um
I will say that there's
quite, it's quite
common that a for
profit developer will,
will partner with the,
with the nonprofit
developer uh to do some
of these uh projects
as well. So we see that quite
a bit.
>> Thank you madam chair and,
and
there's, there's a lot of discussion
about that relationship
because what we're
looking at is reducing,
ultimately the cost
to um
the homeowner and the
renter,
the more
developers involved
and the higher the cost
construction and everything
else related to the
development costs
related. All that
means is it becomes less
and less affordable.
And so, and,
and, and even though we
have all these programs to
support the
affordability,
we're looking down
long term has to
be affordable for the long term
and not just the short term.
So um I
would be looking at that very
carefully because
I'm in a numbers person,
I'd like to see the, the
relationship there and
exactly what
the costs are that go to the
development, to the
developers
in those relationships
because somebody has, everybody
has to get a cut.
And so um
the more people involved
in the development of the post
projects, the more
cuts there are the higher the cost.
So that's just
so that's something that
I'd like to see down the
road. Uh report
it back. Um
How that relates to
affordability and
long term sustainability
of the affordability.
Does that make sense? Thank
you very much, madam. Thank
you. >> Thank you representative.
All right, we're going to
Oh, did you want, did you
want to respond to her
comments? No, I didn't request that.
Thank you. We will move on then
to represent.
Oh, is the, I'm so sorry. I have
so many here. I'm just looking at my notes.
So tell me you were gonna
say, >> just wanted to quickly
respond and, and say that
under the programs that we
fund, whether they be tax
credit or the gap
financing that we have, whether it's a
housing trust fund
or federal
funds that uh
that pie is only so
big and if there's one
developer or two developers
or three developers, they share in that
pie. It does not increase the
cost for the renter.
In this case, the income
limits are the same regardless
of who's involved and the
rents are the
same. It can only be
a certain amount. So
uh uh
regardless of whether they're for profit,
nonprofit or a combination of
those, so that's the way our programs are
structured and we can definitely
provide you more information on that. So
you can see the, >> thank you madam
chair. Yes, I would like to have
that how that's broken
down more specifically.
So it's starting with the total
project costs
and then broken down
per project. So
that and then longevity.
Thank you. >> Thank
you very much, representative uh
representative Oro you are
next.
>> Thank you madam chair. I'm
actually gonna time myself
because I sometimes tend
to get a little long wied.
Thank you in these kinds of
conversations.
Um,
so,
you know, having worked
for the city, we had a planning
department and we
did studies and we,
and I'm gonna go from sort of the
macro to the micro.
Um you know, and
I just wonder does Emma
a do that? Do you guys look
at, do you have like a group
that looks statewide
to
determine
um housing needs
by sort of
geographic areas of the
state from
a population standpoint,
geographic standpoint,
socioeconomic
standpoint,
all of these
needs. Is there
some entity in
the state that actually does
that
>> madam chair and
representative, we do have
the statewide
um housing needs
assessment. It was a
report that we
brought together leaders,
housing leaders throughout
the entire state and then
hired a consultant
and so we do have detailed
information about
>> that was completed as a
result of that.
And when was that done?
>> And I believe it was the
end of 2021.
And then,
and then every year we update
that. And so that was the report
that Robin spoke about earlier,
that will be
2022
at >> some
point,
>> madam chair and representative
that was completed in September of
2022. And
that's what Robin mentioned a little
bit earlier is that we're looking at
updating that and should have a
report to you
in the >> July. July. That's
the July thing that you're
talking about. Ok,
then, um,
just sort of a follow
up on that and I
really am very, very
interested in seeing that.
Um, the, the
next question I have is
with regard to
zoning and that's, you know,
that's something and that's why I said I'm gonna
go to the micro.
Um, that's something
that I've worked
for many, many years.
And um and I know
how difficult that is
because many of
these housing developments,
madam chair and
numbers are saturated
in certain areas
and they just
continue to
saturate and they're
not distributed
throughout maybe the city
of Albuquerque or the State
of New Mexico
because of zoning
constraints.
And um representative
Luhan uh
alluded to it a little bit.
But my, my
deeper question really
is
and I know like for a lot of
public projects like
parks or
roads or things like that
we are, we have
eminent domain.
Um Does M
fa can
you, I
mean, is that a
tool in
your toolbox
that you have to
develop any of the this
type? Especially when we have the
need that we have.
Now
>> madam chair and representative,
we, we
have to abide by the,
the uh
laws and regulations of
the local governing
authorities.
>> So the answer is
no. OK.
Thank you. Thank you,
madam. >> Thank
you very
much.
>> Thank you madam chair and I'll be extremely
brief at all. If at all possible,
I was really thankful
and happy to hear about
the uh involvement with
the uh aging out
foster you. Uh So
I created a program called Fostering
Connections a couple of years ago
and that is all of those supports
that's provided at that, at that
point. But my specific
question is, is
there uh inventory
on in, in your
valley wick that's subdivided
just for that purpose? And,
and are you the only ones that provide
housing for that purpose or
how does that work?
>> Um Madam chair and
Senator Padilla. So
this program
is um
CYFD
finds the landlords
and they actually place
these use as they come out of
foster care and
then ma the portion that
we do is we work with the
landlords. So when they have a
claim, um
then we research
that the, the invoices
and we pay the claims.
So we are not actually
providing the
units per se, but it's
been a very successful
program. >> Thank you
madam chair and thank you. And that's exactly
kind of where I was going with that.
But, but then to follow on that
very quickly, uh Is there a
discussion that M fa has
with the, the
the we came up with the term
of art called aged
out um
sorry, aged out
young adults, I believe is what we called it
in the legislation where
you have a conversation with them about
homeownership
because that is
right when you want to get them because
that way they are on a path
to homeownership,
but then it also directs them
to keep the job
to go to school, which are all supports
within this program as well.
And, and that would ideally help
the reduction of one of
the big goals I had with that legislation
was to reduce the
number of uh
repeat uh
fostering
scenarios with kids that have been in
foster care. So in New
Mexico, 80% of our
Children that were ever in foster care,
their kids wind up going to foster
care. We have the most
comprehensive program in the country
now with what, what we created here.
And I'm very proud of that,
but the states that have done it, even
without a comprehensive approach, they
see that fall to less than
30%. So I'd really
like to just kind of shrink that as much
as possible in one great way. I'd
even thought about it until you, you were
speaking. Uh wouldn't
it be great if we had uh
these young
adults
immediately, you know, moved
into understanding how to
own a home and how that works. Do you do
any of that
>> chair, Senator Padilla? We
don't actually do
that. They're case managers with
cyf, we kind of help them
with those type of life
skills. But definitely,
I think it's a great idea that we could
reach out to them and
educate um these
case managers as
to the programs that ma has
because we do have a lot of programs,
these down payment assistance
and first time buyer
programs. So that's something I
think we can expand upon. And
it's an excellent idea.
>> Well, thank you madam chair and I
appreciate that,
that,
that
is
just
to help young,
but this is one that would really
kind of get them on the right path
down the road and then it becomes
to, you know, kind of family,
you know, uh wealth
over the years of owning a
home and understanding how that works.
So madam chair real quick, full
stop. Second question should be pretty
easy. What is the current
waitlist for uh Section
eight housing uh where
M fa is concerned? Do, do
you have anything because I, I get
these calls all the time and, you know,
I just, I guess I've
been on this committee now for 12
years and I guess it only
dawned on me a couple of years ago that I
should actually be sending them directly
to you guys. Am I doing that the
right way? And what's the
actual wait
time? >> Um Madam chair
Senator, I would have to find
out that. As I mentioned,
we oversee about
86 properties. I
could find out what the wait list
is. Um But again,
we don't oversee
the um section
eight vouchers that move with the
tenant. Um
We only oversee
the project
based vouchers but I I will
find out what the waitlist is and
then report back. >> Thank you madam
chair and I'll, I'll wrap up very quickly
now. So does that, I hope
that that informs, you know,
the the waitlist
informs what you need to
go out and cultivate
as additional options
in that area. Because I, I
have been told by the last maybe
three or four that have called me about
this and I'm
over here trying to run my
business and figure out how to help these
folks um
that it's pretty significant
the wait time, you know, and, and
I understand there's a number of reasons why,
but I hope that importants what you're up to. Thank
you,
Mandr.
>> Thank you. Thank you very
much for that. I did it
need a response. Sorry.
No, thank you. All righty.
We're gonna move on to Vice
chair Corn. Thank you,
vice chair. >> Thank you madam
chair, just real
quick. And
uh the
community uh projects
for fire uh
protective counties. Are you
working with fa on,
on that
funding,
>> madam chair,
Representative
Alcon, this is
um separate congressional
funding, but we do
sit on a committee that
fa hosts
and I
want to say it's every two
weeks. So I
know that um
Julie who's our compliance
manager sits on that
committee and
I believe that a few
people have
not been interested in this
congressional funding because they are
waiting for fa
funding.
Um
So we
work with them. We are aware
but it, this funding
is kind of a different
bucket.
>> Ok, thank you. Ok.
Just, uh, and this is the way out
of that field. Uh, madam
chair, uh,
Representative Re
Caballo was talking about
senior citizens
and I was wondering, is there
anywhere that a senior
citizen can go
so that they can get assistance
with paying their property
taxes and they
don't become
homeless?
>> Um, madam
chair and Representative
Alcon, um, we
had the homeowner assistance
funds for
COVID related and those
funds are over. But
anybody that's delinquent in
their property taxes, they
can work with the county.
Um, if they
continue to be delinquent
after three years, then that
debt moves on to the
state. The state
does have a program
where they will allow
the homeowner to make payments.
So that would be the
best option, but I'm not
aware of any programs that
actually would, would pay their
property taxes for
them.
>> And the only reason that I'm curious
about that madam chair is because
of home taxes
and, uh, especially in
Albuquerque, I just get
into where, I
mean, they're almost
equivalent to a house
payment
with that in mind that I
just wondering if there's something
we could look at in the future that
we could come up with some kind of
assistance, especially
for seniors,
>> madam madam madam chair and
representable. There's also a
program, um,
if somebody makes
it's low income and
I, I'm not sure what
if it's 30,000 or
40,000 a year? But if a senior
has a very low income,
they can go to,
um, the state property tax
and, and lock in
their, their property
taxes
at, at the amount
I believe. I, if,
when they turn 65 I'm,
I'm not sure of the details, but there is
a program for seniors as well.
Very low income
seniors.
>> Thank you. Um, thank
you for that. Um
And I think that I really
appreciate that uh
question and comment.
Um Vice Chair Comb
because we had visit,
I visited with Izzy. Remember we talked
about that because I did get a call
from the, from the county
requesting um if
we had any kind of programs for
that and it turned out that it was just
during COVID. Uh
and so, um
M fa is
apparently and is it correct
me if I'm wrong looking
at um at the
possibility of establishing
a program that would be
ongoing, however, they do
need funding. So
that's the the key here. Thank
you. All righty. So
I don't have anyone else. Oh,
yes, Senator Ortiz
Pino has a question. >> Thank you
madam chairman. And
so like several
of the members have
mentioned the
the information you all are
providing is is very good
and, and every year I learn new
things. This,
this year, one of the things I've heard
for the first time about is the
state affordable
housing tax credit
is that being heavily
marketed? Is that being, is
that well known or
is it being fully
utilized
>> madam chair and Senator, we
have been uh trying
to uh make,
make people aware of that
um uh actively
we're advertising, I believe
with the, with the
uh CPA S
and, and
uh but it could be
utilized much
more, but we are attempting
to make sure people know about
it. And, >> and do you gather madam
chairman, do you gather any information
about how much uh
of a, of a
fiscal impact it has for the
state and,
and, and how much you know, how many people are
actually utilizing
it?
Um
That would be useful
information for us to know because
that would give us some idea about
whether that needs to be
beefed up or more
more widely
marketed
>> madam chair and Senator, we have
not used the
amount that's been
given uh set
aside for the state tax credit
yet. We're trying to
make sure that happens. But
>> good and
madam chairman just one other thing
II I
and I don't know how people feel about
this. I know it's very controversial
but the situation in Los
Ranchos
within housing
project
And I think, do you have some money in
that one?
The, the one that, >> yeah,
we,
we Mount Mount
chair and Senator,
we uh
we involved with
the uh the tax
credits. >> Yeah,
this is
staggering to me that a project
can be a year and a half into
construction and a court
rules that it has to stop.
I mean, that just makes no sense
whatsoever by any.
Maybe, maybe people
had a legitimate concern before
it got started. But once
it's up, it's up and,
and, and I just wanted to
mention that the State of Colorado
has recently passed some
laws that
heavily limit
the ability of local governments
to impose very restrictive
zoning rules.
And, and I think that's something this
body might want to start considering
because this is craziness.
All that does is drive
up the price of housing
and it expands the gap
between the wealthiest and the
poorest New Mexicans.
When you have a situation where neighbors
can say my view of the
mountains, my tranquil
pastoral life is going to be impacted
by this project half a mile
away and
stop it in court.
That is a very dangerous
situation. We're never gonna be
able to fill the gap if that's
the case. I mean, every
project that, that, that you
fund and that the
state puts affordable housing
money into is at risk
because of this. I I
just, I just think that,
that, that this is
that, that this next legislative
session, we might very well want to
take that Colorado bill
and, and, and amend it,
adopt it to, to, to
fit our circumstances and
take some action.
But I just wanted to make that
point, madam
chairman.
>> So that the A
I know because we were seeing
several pieces.
>> I'm sorry, I didn't put it
on. Uh We foresee several
pieces of legislation coming
up and that's a very good point. Thank
you very much. Now, we're gonna move on
to Representative
Kates
next.
>> I just want to thank you
chair and, and
thank you again, Senator
for being so
brave and speaking what needs
to be uh spoke.
Um I wholeheartedly
agree with you on the
dangers of what's happening
in Los Ranches right now.
Um I just would
like to suggest to
the M fa that
instead of talking
to CPA
S and
um accountants on
your tax, understand
that people that need this
assistance do not have CPA
S and accountants.
So, um
I would
suggest that
doing a robust
education
to lenders
who work uh the M
fa programs
already and maybe
even gar your real estate
association because
those are the relationships
with the individuals who bought
their houses with their retirement
money where cash
and now they may be having
problems um
with the property taxes, they
might reach out to them.
I know that um this
Friday, I'm sitting through a
large M fa
industry
um uh that will
be with multiple
lenders. It's just
that individuals
who are having problems
with property tax are
most likely
not with the CPA.
And so I just
suggest that we look in
other places to advertise
that program. Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much, Izzy. You want
to respond to that madam
>> chair and Representative
Kates just to make sure there's no
confusion. The state tax credit
program that the
North CNO asked about
is for people that want to donate
money towards affordable housing
and they get 50 cents back on the
dollar under state
tax liability has nothing to do
with property taxes
separate.
>> Thank you. Thank you for
that.
>> Um
I want to make sure,
comment more
than
more than
the
$50.
>> There we go back to this. You
mentioned the $50 million
that the legislature
appropriated as we
put that funding into the
LFC um
budget. Um
It had to do with a bill that I
introduced for $500
million
requesting
uh general fund money
for the affordable housing
trust fund. Recognizing
always that 500 million
is a big lift.
Um However,
uh when you've been here a few years,
you understand that sometimes
it's better to
request an
amount that is
higher and you may
get something even if it's a little
lower or lower
than start off very
little and not get
anything at all. Especially
considering the need as
it continues to grow in New Mexico.
So that being said,
what I'm trying to get at is
that the $50 million that
was appropriated through
the LFC and the
legislature now
is General
Fund money. And
it is also
um give me a second.
Yes, and it is going
to be leveraged
like every dollar is
through the ma
the M fa will leverage
that amount up to
2129
to 1, sorry, 29
to 1 in return.
So we're not that
far off from the
$500
million that were requested.
In fact, we may
even supersede
that with that
in other buckets of
funding that we appropriated.
So we ended up actually
coming out ahead
more than the 500
million um as we can
see that, but just wanted
to, to bring that up.
So it's not a 50
I'm sorry, you're not 500
yes, $50 million.
And that is it because you think 50
million is a lot, but it really
isn't when you compare it with the cost
and, and the needs that there are,
it'll just disappear in an instant.
But when it's leveraged with the great
work that m does,
it does go a long way.
So thank you for
uh for that. And then one other
thing is we're talking about local
governments here and I
wanted to elaborate a little bit
on that and that I
just passed a bill
um,
that it amended
the public project
revolving funds for
the State of New Mexico. The,
the law that, that,
that guides that
in, in the statutorily
um mandating certain
things having to do with local
governments. And
one of them
has to do in the
same bill, I kind of thought,
oh, maybe I won't be able to get this
through there, but I tried it and it
worked in the same
bill where
I did the amendments
to include the affordable
housing uh
nonprofits for
affordable housing through the New
Mexico Finance
Authority. So we
don't confuse it with the M
fa um
when I amended that I
amended that same
bill to
include
the local government
planning fund
for the state. That's another
fund that we have
that allows for grants,
not loans. The, the
first one was loans,
very low income
loans. This is local
government planning fund
grants for local
governments. And so
now local
governments will be able to
apply for grants
for housing
uh for the uh for
their planning for their
housing plans and,
and so on.
Um And
I specifically put
in there the for
affordable housing, affordable
housing so that
they would um
there'll be no confusion that
they would be able to apply for this.
What happens many times is
that they
can, local
governments can do
um affordable housing
projects, but many times they
just don't have the funds. We
have some small counties and
small areas that don't have the
funds to even do their plans
for affordable housing.
And so they come to the M
fa to
assist with that
and the MF I
mean, it's not a, a never-ending
fund, right? We with the
affordable housing trust fund and
so on, it's just everything
is falling on the
m to do this and that.
So we thought, ok, we're gonna
do, we're gonna
allow the local government planning
fund now to help
with, with planning
grants also for
housing, not only for
other things. Um
And so now
it's gonna be grants instead
of worrying about having
just to go for loans, just
wanted to mention that.
And then, um I
think um that's
about all I have
um for now,
you know, on this topic,
I just wanted to clarify some
things. So thank you very
much and we're gonna move on to
the next item, Donna
and Jeff. Appreciate your
work. Monette.
I see that
where you are. You walked
in and there you go. Good
to see you. Yes,
and you can come up for the
next item. We have homelessness
in New Mexico lessons
from the frontlines.
Monette. You are
great. And Robin,
thank you. For all your
work. I got a chance
to work with you a little bit during
this last session and I so
appreciate you. Thank
you. >> Thank you. I'll
just give a brief introduction
if that's ok,
Senator.
Ok, thank you. So, yes,
many of you may know,
um, the
uh executive director
of the New Mexico Coalition
to end homelessness. Monet
Silva, uh Monet
has been at the coalition for
about 2.5 years,
year and a half. Um But
she's been um an
advocate for
housing and homelessness
for many years.
And um the coalition
is a great partner to
M Amon.
Talk more about what the coalition
does, but um
I can vouch
for Monne as an advocate
in this space and uh
as as also somebody
who is really informed on
policy, so we appreciate
her being here and she will be
talking about the
homelessness
um perspective
as she sees it from, from
her organizations. Thank
you. >> Thanks. Thank
you Robin. And thank
you.
We can hear >> you
madam chair and
committee like Rob
said, my name is Moet
and I'm the executive director
for the Coalition and Homelessness.
Um I
know we're getting tight on
time. Um So I
will move
as quickly as possible through
this. Um I wanted
to first start by giving
you all the
mission and vision of the
coalition and then also
talk a little bit about
what we do with the coalition
because it will inform some of the
data and stuff that I'm gonna give
you um a
afterwards.
Um Do
I need to tell you next? Is
that
next?
And you can actually go one more or two
to the mission vision.
Um So our
mission is to assist communities
to create solutions to homelessness
from prevention through permanent
housing by using
action, advocacy and
awareness. Um The
vision of the coalition is a New
Mexico where everyone has
a home.
Uh Next,
that's OK. That's
OK.
You can go to the slide, that's the
programs and
initiatives.
Um And some of these
programs and initiatives you've
just heard about. Um
the prior speakers were giving some
information of kind of how that overlaps
with ma um
One of the things the coalition does
is the COC which is the
continuum of care. Um
And so we are the
organization, we
write the collaborative application
for both Albuquerque
and balance of state, which are
all the jurisdictions outside of
Albuquerque um to the
federal government. Um
And that's to bring
everybody in anyone who's applying
for funding. Um And we
work through that process. The
COC also
um provides
technical assistance,
um education,
um all of those things
around hud
and coc funding so
that we make sure that
the agencies
are as well informed as
possible. Um When they're
applying for funding or looking to
apply for funding. Um
Coordinated entry um
is something else that the
coalition does
and coordinated
entry is a
mechanism for people to
get an assessment um
which I don't know if you all have heard
of the B espada, which is what we
use here in New Mexico.
Um And they're assessed and
we get
people into housing based on
their need. So the most
vulnerable are at the top of our
list, both in Albuquerque and balance
of state. Um down
to the, you know, the least
vulnerable. Um The idea
of coordinated entries that we want to get
people into housing that are
most in need.
Now, not all of the funding
that comes to the state or
that's used in the state or the
cities um use
coordinated entries. So there are some
ways um City of
Albuquerque has general fund.
City of Santa has general
fund that they can use
outside of that, but we really are
trying to get everyone kind of on the same
page. Um So
that we're all in the same system, it
just decreases barriers and
makes things a little bit more smooth.
Uh Next slide,
please.
Uh The coalition also
runs the Homeless Management
Information System which is
HMIS um which
is our data system
um to be able to
see
who, what, when, where and how
um all the things around
um homelessness.
Um And so when people
get um an assessment,
they get put into the system. And so
this is where we're able to really
see what our numbers
are. Um
demographics of people that
are experiencing homelessness.
Um
And let's see.
Um Built for Zero
is a new initiative
that the coalition is doing
and um
built for zero
is um we started it
both in Albuquerque and in Santa
Fe um last
year. Um And
the focus in
Santa Fe
is youth and veterans
and the focus in Albuquerque
are families and not to say
that's going to lead up anybody else. But
we're really trying to
um decrease those
numbers, get those numbers to
um zero or functional
zero in those
populations and then we'll continue
to move on to additional
populations.
Next slide.
Um The
previous presenters also talked
about um YHDP,
which is the use homelessness demonstration
project. Um We do
have two of those in the state.
We have one in Northern New
Mexico that has
been around
since 2019
and we have a new one in Southern New
Mexico that is um
actually just getting started.
And so that was a big
deal. That was a little over
$2 million that was brought
into the state specifically for Southern
New Mexico.
Um So
we're, we're working on that as well.
Um The other piece
is the
advocacy. The
coalition has always
worked with the legislator
legislature and
um with city
council, county commissioners,
all those types of things.
Um We really, I want to take
a more center stage
um, in doing that, there's a lot of
things as you all are
aware, um around housing
and homelessness that need to be addressed
in um in our
state. And so we really want to
make sure that we are
um part of the
voice to um to
do that. So
let's see next
slide and you can go to the
next one.
So for the data, I
wanted to give you guys a, a
little bit of
different data. This is the most
updated pit count. So this is
the p um point in
time. Um Sorry,
let me back up, point in time count
is um
a count that is required
by us um by the federal
government to do.
Um It's actually every other
year. Um In New Mexico, we
choose to do it every year because we want
to make sure that we have the most updated
information. Um
It's done every
January. Um And it's,
it's one night that
we go out and
try to get a point in time
count. Um See
who is
on the streets at that point.
Um We
know that these numbers
that we're getting back for the point in time
count are a severe
undercount. Um
of the numbers that they really are.
Um
I think it's helpful in
letting us see what's
actually happening in that moment
right there. But we know
that the bigger picture of it um
these numbers really don't
compare to what we're actually
dealing with in New Mexico.
Um So we did see a
slight um
uptick in
um homelessness
in both Albuquerque
um and balance of state.
You can see our um numbers
went up a little bit um
persons in transitional
housing. Um We had a little
bit of a decrease
in that and that might also
give us some reason why the
unsheltered population went
up. Um Some as
well. Um But
you can see that those numbers are are
up. So we're looking
at, um let's
see, Albuquerque
2740
balance of state
1009
09.
And if we go to the next
slide,
we can see
that the real numbers
that we have from 2023
of individuals experiencing
homelessness in New Mexico
is around
27,000.
So when I say severe
undercount, it really
is a severe
undercount of what we're actually
dealing with. Um, some
of those reasons. Um
People know when the point in time
count are gonna be, they don't want to
be counted. Um We have to
get their permission in order
to um count
them. Um It's
done in January,
it's cold. Um
People are trying to be
places that are warm
and um get away
from there. Um There are
also,
um, you know, encampments
that are being moved and so
we lose a group of
people that, you know,
we thought we gonna be part of the
count. Um So there's a
lot of reasons why that number
is off. Um In Albuquerque,
we have a much more
robust
volunteer um,
group that goes up and does the
point in time count
um, in the balance of state
that looks very different, right? We're
talking about um
different counties, different
cities that we're trying to,
to manage this and we're just not
getting um the
numbers back in. And I, I don't
know that through the point in time count, we
really are ever gonna get up
to this, you know, 27,000
number. We're not gonna get them to match.
Exactly. Um
But I just, I wanted to make
sure that you've got the point in time
count numbers, but also understand
that this 27,000 is
actually what we're more
dealing with.
Um, the
14,002 13
that are in coordinated
entry. Um Those
are people that are enrolled in our coordinated
entry process that I talking
about that they are getting the
assessment, they're in
HMIS they have their assessment.
They are being, they're on
our list and we're working
through those lists both in Albuquerque and
balance of state. Um
The other 13,000 are
people that are not in coordinated
entry but are part
of partner organizations
around the state. Um
As you can see, we're kind of, we're
almost at a 5050 split
there, um,
which there's,
there's goods
and
turns into a
whole other story. A lot of other
things happen there. Um,
22%
with no health insurance.
Um, again, that's, you
know, the income, um,
all of these things and
then 5.5%
of our clients
are
veterans.
Uh Next slide,
please.
Um You all
were presented with,
um I believe you should have gotten
two documents
which um were
the um analysis
of resources needed to house
everyone in New Mexico.
Um Hank Hughes, who is our former
executive director in
2019, um
wrote a white
paper and
um giving really
clear of what we're
looking at how many people
what the cost would be to actually
get people into housing.
So that's the 2019
1. Um You also
have a 2023 1. I
asked Hank um
after he left before the
last legislative session, if he
could give us um an
update of what that looks
different. Um So I wanted to make
sure that you had both of them, the
2019
version um
really goes much deeper.
So you're getting definitions
and um resources and all
those things. The 2023
1 is really just an
update so we can see those
numbers. Um
So, so the total
number to address homelessness
is 100 and
36 million. Um,
and some change,
um, homelessness prevention.
We're looking at 34
million and then the grand
total you can see is around 100
and $71 million.
And then the one time construction
cost of 96 million would
be to actually build,
um, build or
modify, um,
existing buildings,
um, for,
for housing.
Um,
we know that the number is
really large. Um,
It's, it's a really large
number.
Um
but we also know that we have a real
like we, we see it
right? We're seeing this every day that
this is increasing.
Um and
just to know that like once
we
can take care of this and get
people into housing, it
leads to so many other things, you
know, we, I often tell
people I
have an issue right? With somebody
who has a job who has health
insurance, who has money
of sitting on the phone and
dealing with, you know, my HMO
or, you know, whatever.
So imagine when you
are on the streets,
you're trying to find a place that's
safe to sleep,
you're trying to find um
food, you're trying to find all
of these things that, that
just goes up. And so we know that
housing is the key.
Um So if the state
can make, you know,
again, it's, it's a large number.
But if we can make that type of
investment, um the
other outcomes that are going to come
from that are gonna, right. It's
just going to multiply into
other outcomes. Um
education,
um uh
jobs, all of those
things, this is going to impact all
of those things. So,
um you
should have these, if you don't, I'm
happy to send them to you. Um
They're really good read and they're
really informative about
what is going on in our
state.
Um
Let's see, uh next
one more slide
over.
Um So just real quick just to
talk about some of the
obstacles um
that we see in, in
homelessness in New Mexico.
Um So the
barriers, um
just overall, the system as
it, as it stands
is a barrier to ending
homelessness. Um Just,
just the system
um in general,
um One of the
things we really run
into is the different
definitions of what is
homelessness, right? Hud
has a definition mckinney
even so has a definition.
Um And those
definitions differ from each other,
for example, h definition
is that we have, somebody has to
show that they're literally homeless
for a 12 month
period,
12 months. So we
are telling people they have to stay on the streets
for 12 months in order for us
to even take action
on, on helping them,
on getting them into something.
And the moment they get into
something, whether that is
transitional or anything
different, if we put them up for
long, if they get into something for long
enough, they're no longer
homeless and their 12 months starts
again. Right.
So there's, it's just this
cycle that continues
on top of itself and it doesn't
allow us to um
to get out of that.
Um Housing
is a huge thing. We know that our
housing stock
is very
low. And then on top
of that, the affordable and deeply
affordable housing is
um you know,
even lower than that.
Um collaboration is
another part of the barrier we
have um
nonprofits,
um
governments, all of those things
that are working in silos
um as opposed to together
as right, like let's
inform this all together and make
sure that we're doing these things
together. Um And
it's not right, it's not the
perfect um way
to move things, but we just really want
to make sure that that's happening.
Um
um our behavioral health
system,
um you know,
the um getting people employed,
these are all issues
around the barriers to
getting people off
the streets. Um
Another one of the
obstacles is
criminalization. Um
We are seeing across
the country actually, a lot
of bills that
are being introduced um that
will further
criminalize
homelessness. Um We have
some of those here in our own state
and our cities um
that are either doing that
already or seeking to do
that. Um And we
know from best
practice that
criminalizing homelessness
does not um
make things better, it
actually makes things worse.
Um You've now put
more, um
you know, they have something on their record
now, um,
you know, all of those things. So
we, we really want to get
away from the criminalization
of homelessness.
Um
I
the Supreme Court
is right now deciding on a
ruling for the
grants pass motion that was
introduced to them in last
month, I believe. Um
And I think we're going to hear
their decision in June.
I think we all have a feeling of which
way it's gonna go, um
which will definitely impact
the way that
um both nonprofits
and governments and community
are able to move in this space
um of what that looks like for
us. And so we're really keeping
that on our radar
to um
to pay attention to and how we're
going to move forward. Um Once
that comes, we're trying to do some
um preventative
stuff before it's
even uh
the decision is
put out. But um
we will have to kind of see what happens
on that one.
Other obstacles are
um policies. We
want to make sure that
um you know, I am a
like, I
love policy, I think
um a representative an
Nou had on a shirt the other day that said
policy is my love language and
that's really what it is, right? We
want to make sure that we have
really strong good policy
in place um to
make sure that we're addressing the
issues for um
you know, the most vulnerable in our,
in our state.
Um And then again, I
spoke about collaboration just
making sure that we are
um collaborating.
Um also being really strategic
about the way the money is
spent across um
across the state, the
millions upon millions of
dollars that go into housing and
homelessness in New Mexico.
Um You know, if we look
at what each city is
putting, what comes in
from the federal government, what the
state is spending, it's,
you know, it,
it's a lot of money. Um
And we really just want to make sure that we're being
more strategic on, on
that spins. Um,
next slide and
then, um, just to wrap up
here, best practice,
um making
sure that as we're making
policies,
um
as nonprofits are moving
forward with, um, plans
that we have that we
are really listening to
the voice of individuals who
lived experience.
Um We make
sure that on all of our
boards, on all of our,
um, we have people
with lived experience as well
as we make sure to pay them for their
time. Um, that we
don't want to just have them
there, you know, reliving
their trauma and bringing that back up.
We really want to inform
how we're moving forward.
Um, the data
again, we want to make sure I gave
you, um, some numbers,
you know, those things are, should really
inform the number of
people that are experiencing homelessness.
Um The demographics of people
experiencing homelessness of
um how we are
moving forward with um
strategy policy,
etcetera,
um deep
investments in housing
services. Um and
the community, right, we, we want
to make sure that we are
um building those
things up. And so that
ask of the,
you know, 171 million
and the 96 million
for um
building costs is
uh it's a deep investment
but it's what's needed to
get um where we need to
get. Um
And then making sure again, policy
and collaboration, just
making sure those things are at
the top of our minds, whether that's
from, you know, counties
to cities to, to the
state. Um
And we also work very closely
with um some national
policies that are um we're
working on as well.
Um The last slide that
I have for you are just,
um and I'll let you read those
just some impact of the
way that
um our system does
and doesn't work for
individuals experiencing
homelessness um in our
state. And so I'll let
you read those as,
as you can.
Um And that is
all I have for you today.
Um Try to make it quick. So if you
have any questions, I'm
happy to answer. Um
what I can.
>> Thank you, Monette.
Thank you very much for providing
so much information here.
And um before
I say my part, let me
go on to Representative Lujan
who had a question or comment.
>> I appreciate it, madam chair. I have to get
back to Santa Fe for
um Water Natural
Resources Committee. Um
Thank you monee for being here.
Uh You have a lot on your plate.
Uh We've had, and
one thing that I didn't really hear too much
about was some of the legislation that we were
talking about in the housing and maybe with
the, your coordination with the governor's
office and working on the
housing
office and maybe having
the, the homeless
um
office or
sub office. I don't know how she, I I
really talked to the, the
governor about that and
really wanting to have if we
were to pass that legislation
and we didn't, but I'm
sure we're gonna move forward with
it again in the 60 day session
and looking at that collaboration,
I really do believe that that's where
that, that um
the issue of homelessness
really needs to be
uh combined with our
housing. And if we are to have a
housing office, I don't know where
you are. All that. That's not a question.
That's more of a comment.
So one of the
questions I do have madam
chair is
um
you mentioned uh
how you're focused on the
different uh
communities uh of
homelessness in, in different
parts of our, our state.
And you mentioned in Santa
Fe, uh
the, the
population is more geared toward
our youth and our veterans.
Thank you for that one
thing I want to ask is what is
your one on one engagement?
You mentioned that you have a point
in time, count
one time.
But what is the continued
engagement with those,
especially those that are
new to
um, homelessness?
How are we capturing them because
they are a pivotal
population that needs to
immediate engagement?
I understand. Or I've been
working on, on, on this
issue for a long time and
in my own district
um is
the greatest population
of homelessness in Santa
Fe. And I want to
be very specific with this
because as I said, I have been
working years and
years with Hank Hughes, your
predecessor
and you took some concern
even with some of the legislation that I
had and I never
heard from you directly.
And so as we are looking and
talking about collaboration, I want
to make sure that we're engaging and
that I'm engaging as
a legislator and understanding
um where you're coming from
and some of the issues that you are,
you are working on and
how you're prioritizing those
madam chair. Thank you.
>> Thank you madam chair
representative.
Yes.
OK. I will be
um
we are um
to your first question about
how we are interacting
the one on one.
So specifically
at the coalition, um we have
a group of navigators
that are going out in their, the
assessments, they are going
into camps, they are meeting
people at um
Pete's Place at
Consuelo's at, you
know, wherever they need to meet them
to, to get these assessments
and find out what are
people's needs, what's going on, help
them. Part of our navigation is to help
them get the actual
documentation that they will
need to get
into housing once they get there.
So, um I DS
birth certificates, um
all of those things um helping
them to show
their 12 months of
um homelessness. So we have to
make sure that that's documented before
we can put them into,
um, into the system
as well as our
Navigators. Um, work
very closely with the Navigators
that are at different organizations
as well. Um, the
County of Santa Fe has
Navigators. Um,
LifeLinks has
Navigators.
Um,
there's a few other places that, that
we work with directly, but really
making sure that we are going to
them. Um, I tell my
staff all the time that we need to
meet people where they're at.
Right. We shouldn't expect them to
come, um, to us. So
we're really working on that,
um, every day to make
sure that we are addressing that.
Um, something else that I will add
in there is that from
the, um, grow Fund money
last year, which I know we won't see for
a little bit. Um,
the coalition got,
um, about
$900,000 over
the next two years to work
specifically on homelessness prevention
because we know that that is
right. We're having people that are just
new to um,
homelessness. So how do we
quick grab them and get them back
into health? And also how do we
make sure that we can prevent that
from them actually, um,
getting onto the street? So I hope
that
>> I, I really appreciate that. I would
also just like to
say I will
work in
further engagement. I
actually
go out into the public and
actually engage
and I meet with people I meet
with our homeless populations and I ask the
different questions. Is
it scary? Maybe
sometimes. Yeah, I, I tried to
put that aside but I,
I, I get different responses
from them, especially from my
youth and they're,
they're afraid and they're living
in these, these back
areas and trying to commune with,
with one another, but they have no
act, they, they don't know anything
that's going on
and um
I work with other people that have
businesses and
believe it or not have gotten them
some work. Um
And I just like to maybe
further this conversation so that I
can even be more engaged. Thank
you, manager. Appreciate
it. >> Thank you
very much, Representative
Lujan. All right,
Isser Gonzalez. And then we
have Representative Borrego,
Senator Ortiz Pino
after that. Thank you. Thank
>> you madam chair. Thank you, vice chair
and I'll try to be very brief.
Um um
Thank you for the presentation
very, very, very
clear and very
thoughtful.
Um I guess
so, looking at
this. So
I see it as so
very sensitive
and at the same
time,
you know, uh it's
hard to understand a
country like ours to,
to be seen this,
but nevertheless, it
is
and uh on this number,
so percentages
that you mentioned to
us, do you know how many
of those are school age
Children?
Um
>> madam chair and Senator,
let me grab
that real quick.
Um
So I,
ok, so on here we have
it broken down 0 to 18.
We're looking at about 23%.
Um, so
6400
I can break that down even
further for you and get that information
to you. So we can, are you kindergarten
to high school? Is that what you're looking
at? >> Uh, mam,
sure, that will be fine. And
also maybe in college
because I know that we do have
quite a few that in
college. Uh,
the other part that I was gonna
ask is,
um,
uh, do we have a
percentage of
knowing like
we talk about housing? We
talk about different
programs, but
how many of these
individuals
really would not be able
to function by
themselves?
They would actually need
to have
whatever you wanna call it
if it's a Navigator or
mentoring or someone
just being right side
by side with them. So I
don't think they can,
>> uh, madam chair
Senator. That is
a great question. Um We
know that there is a, I don't
have the the number in front of me, but I
will make sure to get that to you.
Um We do have a
large number of
individuals um in
Albuquerque around the state
um that do need
wraparound services, right? We need
the permanent support of housing and
sometimes even um deeper
than that, that they are with
them, you know, are
able to provide more support.
Um We
want to make sure that as we
are
looking at policy, looking
at, you know, the type of housing
that we're building, all of those that we're
really looking at the data and letting the
data inform
how many more caseworkers do we
need in New Mexico in order
to do that, what kind of training do
the caseworkers need in order to
provide that type of service?
Um but I will get that
number for you and get that back
to you and I'll, I'll make sure the whole
committee gets >> the
last part of madam
chair, more of a comment,
but you mentioned of
the different definition for
homeless. Uh
We have the same thing
with the definition for
mental health.
I mean, there's so many different
ways of,
you know, of, of the
thinking behind that, you
know, that
that's also a very hard one
to, to really work
with. And
uh and for many years,
we never really addressed
that, you know, it was something
that just developed
to where we are
today, but
very well. And thank you Thank you
for your thank you madam >> chair.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very
much.
Yes,
thank you. You did.
Ok. Representative
Borrego and then we have Senator Ortiz Sub
Pino. >> Thank you madam
chairman.
Um You
know, I was just
and first of all, thank you so
much for taking this
position because I know it's
not an easy place to
be. Um
Mo I'd like to get your number
before I leave because I'd like
to talk to you
further.
Um and looking
at um the total
population of New Mexico,
which I just pulled up
for 20
2400 and
29
388
467.
That's the number that came
up and I divided
or I multiplied that by
35% which is
approximately what you
your number was.
I mean, I'm 27,000,
I'm sorry. Um
which gave me almost
35% of our
population is
homeless. And I just
wanted to make that point, madam
chair again, the
population total
population of us of New
Mexico times
27,000,
which is, I think the
number you gave
35%
of our, of our
entire population
is homeless. And
I, I just wanted to make that
point to the committee
because I think that
when we start looking at that
percentage
it's really interesting. And
I would like to, that's why I'd like to reach
out to you a little more
to see geographically
where those. And I know Bernalillo
County is huge,
but the rest of
that is somewhere
else around the state.
And I think that
we need to be very cognizant
when we're talking about policy
for funding of
where those distributions
need to go. And
madam chair, the reason I raised
that issue is because I have a
mother that lives in
Espanola
and they just um the
city council
just uh
pushed
out or eliminated
the tent um
city that they had
living under the bridge.
So they're moving them
out. These
people are just walking
everywhere and
people are living in
fear. I have a
96 year old mother
that every day
sees these people. I
have friends that
own businesses up in
Espanola that are
finding them living in
their, you know, the back
of their businesses and, and
we see it on Central Avenue
and Knob Hill all
over the city, basically
central avenue mostly.
Um but they're everywhere
and you know, these people,
these are people, I mean
that deserve a
decent life.
Um So I, I
appreciate what uh
representative
Lujan was talking about with the
policy,
but
we as legislators
really need to look at the impact
of our policy and
how we're making a
difference.
Um The other question
that I had and, and
those are really comments
but the question that I
do have is how
the travelers
impact those numbers
as the,
the uh
summer
you know, comes along because
I happen to know that
people send their homeless to
New Mexico as
well. So I don't, do you want
to comment on that? Thank you
madam >> chair madam, chair
representative. Um
We do see, thank you for,
for sharing that and
um yeah, the, the
numbers, it's
hard, it's, it's a large part of
our um population.
Um We
do know that
um
you know, just like
anywhere in our country.
Um we have people
that are not
from here that end
up here, right? Whether it's the weather
or whatever it may
be. Um That is
not the majority of the population
um of the of individuals
experiencing homelessness.
Um
So I want to make sure that we're,
we're looking at that also
that um
you know, most people are
either from here
or this is home,
right? They've been here for a
number of years. We are seeing
a little bit of an uptick in people
coming in. Um But that
is not um I know
that that is a um
kind of a narrative that is being
told, it's not what's
impacting um
our homelessness issue. Um
As much we are seeing
um like Representative Lujan was
mentioning um that,
you know, people that are newly
homeless, um they're coming
in. That's why we saw such an uptick
since COVID of people
that, you know, we always
talk about, um, you know,
people are one paycheck away from
being homeless. Well,
it happens. Um And now
we have more people that are
newly homeless. A lot of those are
families with, um,
with small Children. And so we're,
we're definitely
um
looking at that and paying
attention to it. Um And I
just also wanted to say that,
um, you know, we
want to make sure um
there's this kind of idea
of the not in my
backyard, the nimbyism.
Um And
we want to make sure that
we're understanding and
realizing that
like,
right, we, we've got to build the
housing, we've got to build the services
for people to, to get
there. And so like, how do
we as citizens
try to help that as much
as well? Right? Not just the
nonprofits in the government, but like
as a community, how do we
boost them up and to kind of help
get there as well? >> No, I'm
sure, I think the reason that I bring
that up is because the that
link between her
data and the
and how we set it is just
like so important.
So thank you. Thank >> you.
Thank you very much and you're absolutely
correct. It's that connection that
we need to have. So thank you very much
for that. We're gonna move on only
because time and we're losing
our members, but Senator or TZ
Pino is next.
Thank you for your patience. Senator.
Thank >> you, madam chairman. Thank you
Moet for your presentation.
I wanted to ask about the
point in time
count data
because the one that jumps
out at you is the
decline in
the number of people
in transitional
housing. How could
that be? But
what, what would be your
because that would be you think
of relatively
dependable number
account,
but it's, it went down
from last year. What
happened? >> Um Madam
chair Senator,
what we're seeing is
one is that there's not as much
transitional housing available.
Um We have people,
we hear this almost on
a daily basis that
people have their vouchers
for whatever it be transitional,
permanent support of whatever
whatever kind of housing they're looking
for and they can't
find it, they can't,
they can't get it
to them. Landlords are not renting to
them. We are
seeing, we only have
a very few number
of transitional housing
programs in New Mexico
>> fewer than last year,
>> which we need to, we
need those dollars to increase
for. Um, and whether that's,
you know, the federal government doing that or
the state or the cities,
we do need to see more
dollars there. Um because
we know that that right, it's
transitional housing for a reason.
It, it's kind of that piece that
helps to move on to the next
um that next stage. And
so yeah, so that's what
we're seeing is that the
vouchers are not being accepted, there's
just not enough money and transitional
housing um
for what we need.
>> Thank you and madam chairman, that
brings up another possible
piece of legislation. I know we
kicked it around a little bit last
year. But the idea
of legislation that would
prevent landlords
from discriminating based
on the source of the,
of the
payment, you
know, that we'll, we'll take you if you're
paying your own. But if you're taking, giving
a voucher, we won't take you.
That discrimination
is something we could address at the
state level where
you all could address, somebody
could address whoever's gonna be
there can address.
Thank you. >> Thank
you very much, Senator. You're
absolutely correct.
Um, ok. Then
is that it Senator or did
I cut you off? I want to make
sure. Thank you. All
right. And I'm gonna
defer my questions because of the
time so we can move on to the next
item. But let me say thank you
profusely again for
all your work. Um,
and I can't imagine,
um, what you see
and how hard your work
must be. Thank you for all your
work. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate
you. Want it. Take care.
All right, we're gonna move on to the
next item. The interim
committee procedures and adoption of
the work plan.
Um, the procedures
are usually
very much,
um, the same as
we do every year. It's a
common practice that we
make that we approve
these and they're before
you, um, in
your packets. And
um so if
you need to Izzy, do you want to
talk about those briefly
or do you want um
just to us to review them
here quickly and make a
motion uh tell
us where you are and
Christina >> madam
chair, I will defer to Christina here.
I don't have any additional comments other than
what you mentioned. Um >> If you
guys just want to look over everything
that's fine with me. I have a little bit
prep prepared. But really,
if you look at it real quick, you
see that the statutory stuff
is um
subs or letters A
through D that's, that's
required by statute.
And then if you turn the
page, um we
also have some additional
items, there's eight things here and
this is all the stuff that ma wanted
to go over this year and if we
went over this stuff last year, so it's kind
of something we've been working on
um through the years. And then also I
just want to bring up that in the folders.
There's a pink sheet with all of the
interim committee
reminders.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much for
that. Um As
I mentioned earlier, these are
um very much
a routine things we have
we adopt every year.
So um is there a
motion or
crossing?
>> I'm sorry. Thank you, madam
chair. I got the
red button.
Thank you madam
chair. I move that we
accept the work plan
as presented.
>> Second, that >> motion. Thank
you. There's, there's a motion
and second to approve the work plan as
presented uh in
opposition.
Yes, thank you. Now, we're
gonna go on to the schedule.
The schedule is attached
to the work plan. And so I just
wanted to make sure the members saw the
schedule. It is attached.
The schedule has been approved by the
legislative council.
They try to do all their,
I mean council, as far as
moving it around in the schedule,
the full council has enacted
is my understanding until
the latter part of June,
uh to approve
the final uh final
meeting plans and schedule
times places and so on.
But this is very much what's
already been presented and
included in the,
in the um current schedules
to make sure that we minimize
the conflicts and
so on with the, the
dates. So, thank
you. Are there any questions on
this calendar that we
have um for
the dates of the meetings?
And if not, could we have a motion
to approve this?
There's some schedule. Yes, to
approve the schedule,
make a motion to approve the
schedules. Thank
you.
Thank you. We have a motion
and a second to approve the
schedule was presented um
in the opposition.
Thank you. Thank
you to staff and thank you
to um uh
Izzy and to
all everyone for
being here today, didn't
I? That's all we have on
the agenda, right? I'm thinking, why
am I looking like I'm missing something,
but I guess not so.
Thank you so much, Izzy,
did you have anything to say? You
look like maybe you wanted to say
and I'm taking over here not letting
you say anything to >> thank
you madam chair. I uh,
Robin got me the answer
for Senator TC Pino's
question a little bit earlier on how
the private activity
bond volume cap
is, uh, uh
determined and I'll
just read it real quick. Uh
So the IRS calculates each
state's private activity
bond cap volume cap
facility manually using a formula
based on a and they cite
the uh law
that they have in there. So they have the authority
to set this based on this
law. Uh
The 2024 formula
is a greater of 100 and
25 multiplied by the
state's population or
378 million,
whichever is greater.
This is an increase from
2023 when the formula
was the greater of
100 and $20
multiplied by the state's population.
So it's a formula that the
IRS has in
statute that they are able
to uh to use
and how we set that. So,
thank you, madam
chair.
>> Thank you, Izzie for that.
Senator. Did you want to add
anything?
Ok. Thank you very much.
And thanks to everyone. You have a
wonderful day and
we'll see you again very
soon.
And a motion to adjourn we have a
motion. Thank you, Senator,
motion to adjourn in
second, in
any opposition. I don't think
so. Thank you.
>> We're adjourned.
