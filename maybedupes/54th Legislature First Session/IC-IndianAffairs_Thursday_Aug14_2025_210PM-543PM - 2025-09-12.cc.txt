And we are back.
So we
are at our
third agenda item Navajo
preparatory school
update and we
have our head of
school,
Sean Alison Vicente here
joining us and uh Mr
Robert
Aa. So you may
begin
>> um Yat a madam chair
members of the
Indian
Affairs Committee,
Aha Ntsu for
um giving us this opportunity
to provide an update
and presentation and
especially to those either newer
members to learn a
little bit about Navajo
Preparatory school and
share
Ry with you.
And it's one that
we are
always so thankful
to our state
legislators
and all their support
and also to the local
communities and our tribal
leaders. She
Shana Ais and Bii
Initia A
and
be Makini
Dashi Okla
A mans.
I'm Shana Bisan, the head of
school. I've been head
of school since
for eight years. I'm going on my
eighth year. I'm a graduate
of Navajo prep and
have returned back
to now lead the
school part
of I know that we
all have our story in our
why as to what brought us
in this room today.
And I'm truly
thankful that my why
begins with my family,
my father, my mother
and all of our grandmas and
grandpas who have
gone and who've really led the
way for us all to be here. So
I just want to honor and thank
them at this moment for
that
to begin. We have
an impact video. I
just would like to take you to
the screen behind
you. And then we
will start with the
presentation
that
every year we
create an impact
report and in our impact
report collab,
we look at our
data. How well are we
doing from
every aspect
of from home life in
our residential program
to what, what are
we serving in our
nursing in
our school based health center that we
have? What are the
key areas
that we can support
students? Because we find
with our holistic approach,
we really look at the whole
child in all our
endeavors. I
do have to celebrate,
we have some great accomplishments
that we've made this year.
Um I I
am when I found
out that the
IB the International
Baccalaureate
has accepted or
found that our language
is sophisticated and
intellectual that
they now have
created a standard
level course in the Navajo name
language under the IB program.
This group, the juniors
will be the first group
who will now experience
the IB course before
they had to choose
Spanish, taking
Spanish and now
they can choose to
take Navajo.
We still have
students who do dual language.
They'll still take Spanish and they'll still
take Navajo but
at least that option is there
and they can still get their
diploma that they're meeting
the International Baccalaureate
diploma. The
other, we've got to say we're
state champs like three
boys, girls,
boys, cross country
and our girls basketball.
It is hard
to be an athletic athlete,
an academic athletic
athlete, you know, and so you think
about the demands of
the International Baccalaureate
program and I, I
hope you saw those
numbers, you know,
253 that
are athletes to
310.
I'm sure if we did that
calculation, we have over
75% of our
students who are athletes
and are involved in athletics.
We are supportive of
activity because
we know keep kids
busy and focused
that's going to lead to
success. We
also are proud
that we had 45%
of the Navajo Nation,
bilingual recipients
across the Nava
nation. They
came from Navajo prep,
it speaks to
our faculty,
it speaks to our
DZO Institute, it
speaks to
our strategic priority
that we made that, that is our
number one goal. So how are we
living it and how are we
supporting it?
Thank you so much
for building and
helping us build a new
home, that new
home has allowed for us to
increase our enrollment to
offer and expand
our services to more
students. It
also has
brought in a
home
that truly
feels not like you're
walking into a dormitory,
it has open
concept, Jack
and Jill bathrooms
and, and it is
the first one,
first coed, um,
home that we were able
to have and that we were
successful
and I'm knocking on wood
because remember
we just started another school year.
So, um,
other is that,
you know, when we look at,
when we look at our
accomplishments,
you know, there was and
I'm gonna, I'll go through and share
with you some of the
actions that the
legislator has
had. But it
has been a celebration. We
have the largest International
Baccalaureate cohort
in school history.
60 students
have committed
to going
the extra mile.
And what that means
is they're
writing in an extended
essay, they're
involved in cast
projects. They're
taking six rigorous
courses that they will
sit for exams their
senior year.
So it's, you
know, you know,
the International Baccalaureate
Program, we're just really proud
of the partnership that
we've created and the how
it's really complements the
overall holistic approach
of Navajo prep.
I would be remiss if I didn't
start off with our story. And
I know everyone has our
story about how
we came to be in this
space. You know,
I'm thankful that we
are that we are
still living in the grounds
of the Methodist mission.
Many of our buildings still
date back to
1912,
1920
1930
we were able to do
some renovations to still
be able to say, look, we're,
we're, we may be
operating in
that federal policy
of assimilation. But now
as we're moving into
this new era of
21st century learning
and skill, you know,
we also are very
thankful that we're able to
renovate and really
see and use
those buildings and
the grounds because
I know, I always say if
the buildings and trees could
talk, what would they be telling
us and what would they
be sharing to us
as, as now new
inhabitants of the location?
So I'm thankful
for our journey and it's part of
our story that we've been in
education and
Western education
and now in a blend and balance
of it here for
100 plus years.
And so I'm really thankful
to all those
who were part of that
Navajo Preparatory
School was established
in 91 by the Navajo
Nation. They, the
Navajo Nation leaders
wanted to
create a college
preparatory environment
and we have stayed true to
that mission. That
is our focus is college
prep, everything we
do. Our, the
the mission,
the vision, everything is
reflected into
college prepatory.
If you look at the
Congo, not a, that's our
motto.
Everyone knows it,
leaders and into
the future. How do we
embody it? How is
it reflective in our
curriculum? How is it reflected
in the activities? How is it
reflective even in the
leaders that come
before how are we training
our student senate
and our different advocates?
How do we ensure that
leadership qualities are
embedded in everything that we
do? Because our,
how if
we're truly saying we're creating
this community, this
being a nation builder
for our Navajo nation
and the larger tribal nations
and even just the larger
community as citizens
of America. How are we
ensuring that they are ready
and prepared and it's by
preparing them with
the necessary
needs,
truly understanding what
whole child is.
And that has always
been our number one
focus Navajo
prep. We are proud we have
a 94 graduation
rate. It's been since
2020
94% graduation
rate. 100%
of our students go
off to college.
90% of our
graduates do enter
college. We go out of
the college clearinghouse.
We are always looking at
our college clearinghouse data
to prove because if
we're saying we're college preparatory
and our first year of
them admit getting to college
isn't there, then that's when we
then go back. What are
we doing? How do we
support our students even
through their first year of
college? Um One
thing I did like that, the team
um broke down was
our graduates who attend
college in New Mexico.
I'm really proud to say we
have 27% who
take advantage
of college here in New
Mexico and the tuition
offers the free
tuition that they eventually can.
If after they prove themselves
And so I'm really proud of our,
our communities that we still
have 27%
going to college.
You know, Navajo prep, we're
a small little institution,
but I feel like we're this big
old, huge arms.
We have a huge arm.
It just doesn't extend to
our school, but our arm
really extends
to being a support
even to our nation.
I'm fortunate to sit
on the Tribal Interior Budget
Committee. I get to go
before the Bureau of Indian
Education and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs and speak
with the Department of Interior
about bie funds
because that's who we are.
We're a tribally controlled
school and
100% of
our money goes
to comes
directly from the federal
government. And in this
process, it allows
us to have those relationships
with tribal leaders across
the United States with
and being involved in the
National Congress of American
Indian, having creating
our own little coalition even
with the Ogallala tribes.
And because our fight
is everyone's fight
and we all know that
it begins with,
it begins with
schools. When we look
at economic development, it
begins with schoolss. When we look
at social
justice, it begins with
schools. When we look at anything
that deal with the health
and wellness of our communities,
it's in
schools.
Um One of
the things that, you know, I'm really
proud of our team is that
we've been able to
um
utilize
um and
ensure that
we are good stewards
stewards of
New Mexico
money.
And I feel like that
slide speaks for
itself and the
work that it takes,
I'm on the New Mexico capital
outlay, funding
the work that it takes to
spend. It's
kind of crazy when you think, oh, you
get money. But there's a
lot of steps
that it takes to spend the
money and be
able to
ensure that
we are using the
dollars
one appropriately.
We make sure that we have a clean
audit every year.
We are not on at risk.
We, you know, with our federal
partners, we, we take an
audit every year
and I just
can't express enough
that this right here
is the support
of this body
and I can't
the level of
work it takes to be an advocate
of your community.
This is what we
do. We ensure that our schools
are safe with. It
started out just increasing
cameras and
really helping, helping
schools because unfortunately,
we can't access
some of the
safety and school
safety dollars that are around
the state or even at
the federal level. But you all
started it.
We are at,
you know, when you look at 2024
money and you know,
that money
helped us pay for
this new home
between 2023 and
2024 money
helped us with the support
of the nation, the
nation also contributed
to that new home.
Now, we're in this new
era of
2020
25 funding
and
I'm excited to
share what's in the
future and what
we have because
our buildings and our grounds
are 1920
buildings and there's
a lot of a, a issues
that are the reality
of what we have to deal
with. The
next is, you know, we,
we also through
all of your
advocacy on
different legislations
that have been enacted on
the body from the body.
We've had grow fund
money. We're
thankful that I know that was once
called Junior Dollars. Grow
Fund money. We
will be submitting for
Growth Fund money this year
once again, because
we did lose out on
21st century funding.
And so that will support
our out of school time
money. When
you're a residential
school, our
students are on
campus from Sunday
evening
to Friday
afternoon
and it's a
24 hours
in that time
frame and so added
to school time or any after
school funding is.
So
I can't even express
how important it is to
look at how
the state. And I know the state
has been very supportive
of out of school time
is what it's been when it comes
to the, with New Mexico
state money
funding
at the federal level, it was called
21st century funding. And
through the Bureau of Indian Education,
it's 21st century, but
they make that competitive.
And so when they
make it competitive,
you know, if you
are, you are, it's like
a crapshoot. You pray, you get it.
If you don't, then how are we going to
sustain it? Because we have
to do after school
activities, we
have to support our
Children after school,
they don't go home.
So I am just
kind of putting in a little plug
about grow fund money
and the potential for
out of school time in
that area.
That HB 52
was huge. I think
Representative Allison, he
introduced it
and it's to support our
IB fees.
Currently, the state
funds half of
our advanced placement
fees. And
with this, we were able to add
IB fees because it's
just the
same. It's a more of a
rigorous exam. And if you
score at a certain
number, you
can go into college
already, not having to take
entry level courses.
The next is
the HB two with
our Innovation Zone and
HB two
with the NEXTGEN
CTE, I
can express that both
of these funding structures are
frustrating
and I would really challenge
the state legislators
to look at how
they can support
bae schools
with this funding
we
are,
we submitted a
reimbursement for
$87,000.
And at the end of the day,
was told only
40,000 would be
reimbursed after
we had signatures of
support prior, we
got it pre-approved.
And then so I,
I know that there's very
few Bureau of New
Mexico tribally controlled
schools who even go
after this funding because
it is so
heavily
regulated and they
nit pick every
aspect of this funding
dollars even after they are
pre-approved.
But we still go for
it because it's still funding
opportunities. I'm
thankful that I have a team
who,
who can navigate
but not all schools have
the capital, the professional
capital to navigate
these
very,
I need a word
complicated. And I
think Dr
Tabram in the
back,
thank you. All I
have to say is thank goodness for
her and the business
office. So I just
put that as a red flag.
I'm, I'm really
thankful to the funding
opportunity and what
it does provide, but they
make it very difficult to
spend
and especially when you
are a tribal
nation and a tribal
school. And,
you know, and you've already had
approval, you know, you would think
that there would be some kind of
a autonomy or at least
some, you know, you're,
you're being measured to your own
policies. And
so,
um but that's, that
would be one area that,
you know, I really would just
kind of want to emphasize,
I'm thankful to the Department of
Ed. I think they have been
doing great
job and especially
working with Bureau of Indian Education
Schools because sometimes we
forget that there are other
schools in New Mexico that are
not just public schools
and, but we
appreciate
their program and their
support.
I just wanted to highlight
the Navajo Nation because the
Navajo Nation has
contribute to the Navajo
prep. They are
investors in prep
from the time that they
agreed that we would
be a college preparatory
school to even
establishing or
giving us an additional $3
million for a student
home.
Um As we look, as we
move into the future and
we think about what does the
future hold for
education,
we know that there's a bit that,
you know, when we look at 21st
century skills and we look
at um where we're
headed. Um
You know, how
do we, how do we ensure that
our school can sustain
itself even for the next 100
years? You know, I'm
thankful to the builders
of that 1920
19 thirties. I
mean, they
are some of these old
homes, but now it's hard
to renovate
because of AD A
and that was the number one reason
why we had to
tear down
36,000 square
foot admin
building and
it was not cost effective
for us to renovate
it because
of 88. And
I am a supporter.
I always say we need
to look at our school grounds.
And, and
if we were ever to
um you know, whether
it be a physical disability
or both,
you know how we ensuring that our
schools are accessible.
And so when
we look at them, you know,
we, we
appreciate the
work and we also
appreciate the support.
We did submit our IC
A P and it's always through
this body
that we get support for
that for our IC A P.
Usually there's a letter
that's written
in support of our
initiatives and it helps
when going before
LFC
that they also have that
to complement our
programs. Uh
My first is
Indigenous steam building we
received and I have a whole
breakdown of
our indigenous steam building, what
we've already done to
go after a lot of
funding for it. And
I'll kind of break down our indigenous
steam building in the next slides.
The others are just, you
know, capital outlay
drainage, all the fun
stuff that we do. You know,
there's technology
always seems to be moving
pretty quickly.
And then um
our student spaces,
you know, when, if we're the home
to our students
um 24
7
and there's the only soft
space to sit
on your campus
is in the library
and on their bed,
then we need to be really
looking at
furniture opportunities
and how to redesign for soft
spaces because
our kids can gather
in our schools for,
you know, and they um
we may be sitting here but
we also can go home to
comfy couches and
and kind of um
chill out if you will,
you know, in soft spaces.
But we just noticed
around our campus there's, it's
very limited.
So and, and so
that's um just the
fourth other area of
request.
So this dream
of the steam building, I
just kind of want to take you
through it.
I'm thankful to,
I think it would be easier
to maybe have this
conversation if you
turn to
the page on IC
IP 44123,
the roadmap.
And then I'll go back to
the um indigenous
team.
In 2024
we received a congressional
direct spending from Senator
Heinrich for $2
million
and that was for
our cultural, this cultural
center.
And in 2025
we also received some
capital outlay
that we're going to use to
build these classrooms.
The first part of our
classrooms,
we did attempt to do
the tribal in infrastructure
fund. Um We did that
we didn't get um
selected but
we're not gonna just
not try again. I
think when we have
our um our
construction
preconstruction, 100%
designs, I feel,
feel like that's going to be more
substantial to go in
and have the tribal
infrastructure and
we are in the process
of making our request
for $6 million from the
Navajo Nation.
So if you go
back to now, the Steam
Building,
we are, we broke it up into
three phases.
And the first phase is a
pre design
build, preconstruction
that is already in the works.
We've been working with
our architects
and our design team, I mean, our
construction team
and we are
in the process of designing
what this, what this
whole project
could look like
and that
we're, we're viewing that
as phase one,
our phase two is
to create those classroom
spaces. And it's
specifically for
um
I don't think, oh, specifically
for
film, we
have a strong film
program.
Our digital arts
program
are DNE material
arts. So we've
incorporated a whole
weaving, a weaving
class, silversmith in
class, you know, to really bring
back the foundational
some of the foundational values
of, of
art.
And then our music,
our music program is currently
in portables.
And in order to
have this
space
for the arts,
it will also include
a our robotics
with a maker
space where it, we'll have a
small welder this
space of we're
kind of really supporting
entrepreneurship
and,
and even
science, you know, if
there's a larger lab or a
specific lab,
but that's what these classroom
spaces will
be
we have
right now, you know, as
we look at phase two
with the nation,
with the State of New Mexico
and with Heinrich
funding
to build these classrooms.
So we're excited about that.
We're
um we, we, we
need those classrooms um
and especially to be
that opportunity
for um exploration
and really support student
students.
Um
I always say, you
don't
know
what students need to
know when they leave school, that they
can do everything and anything and
do they have the skills for it. And
that type of creativity
is something a I cannot
do.
And I feel like we need to
remember that
in creativity, in the
working with your hands
and in the human experience.
That's this
program.
The second is
the third phase is an
auditorium. We right now
have no large gathering
space in our large gathering,
we gather in the gym
and, and just
to have a stage or at least a
place of performance.
And so that's the third phase
that, that new money
would help support,
but we still have a ways to
go. So, you
know, we're still trying to dream
through that process.
The next are just pictures
of our current program. So
you see the students in the weaving
classes actually
having a space that
could support all the weaving
that that happens.
One thing the students know
if you look way up there in the top
corner of or the corner of the
picture that's her
woven rug, they'll start on
it. They actually
learn how from start to
finish. But if they
don't finish by time school's
out, guess what happens to that
rug,
they undo
it.
That's the teachings
of rug
weaving is
that you,
you don't, you should have
seen these kids right at the end
of the school that last week they're
sitting
there,
you know, because it's the
teaching, you start
it, you have to finish
it and just think
of the value that we're teaching
in the students with that
perspective.
So
um and then our film
program, you notice that
I did have
a video, another video of
kind of what happens in the classroom.
You can see it right there
behind you.
It's the
having those, having those
space to be able to do
production.
Um
>> No, I
I hear
that.
>> So it's just, you know, when
you look at what the IB
stands for is providing them
the tools to be creative
in all that they do. That's
really the foundation
film is an IB
students can um
diploma in the film
program and they can
also do a diploma
in the
um
digital arts program
and that other picture
shows, they have to do
eight pieces over
a whole two
years and you see
the along the pictures in the
corner on this slide
here, that's them,
they have to do an exhibition
but their eight pieces is
by different mediums of art
so that there's a variety
of, of what they have to
showcase and
then we do a whole
exhibition for
it.
Um
I know when you
look at the end of the day, when
we're, we're all
in this space to
support education
because we know that they're the foundation
of our why when
we look at
creating
and sustaining
positive communities,
communities, that thrive,
it's that investment in
Children and their
work. And I'm just so
thankful to
the state for all
your work, all your
support. And
you know, and I've always
said, you know, how can I help?
How can I be a part of
the bigger picture, be the
advocate? And I know you see
us at the roundhouse
with students and they love it.
They're loving and
even now, even having some
who said, you know, I never thought I
would go
into um I want
to be a legislator, you know,
so you are making an impact
on Children and I
love that. That's what
they're saying and that's what
they want to do
because they see your
work and they hear your
voice. So
we'll stand for
questions
and Sago madam chair and
we appreciate all that. You
do.
>> Thank you. Thank you for your
presentation Representative
Hernandez,
>> thank you madam
chair and
again
for your leadership
for what you guys are
doing
to uh uh
always continuing
to raise,
raise the uh the,
the, the bar. You know,
I'm proud
to, to know
that novel Prep is
in my district and I
share it with Senator Cher
who's also a real
strong supporter
of, of the school.
Uh you know, and
he even has a nickname as
Che to,
to the students.
So I'm, I'm really,
you know, it's stuff
like that that really makes
uh you know, the, the policy
work, you know, really
um meaningful
for the community
of, of, of.
Uh and, and,
you know, it's beyond
just uh
Navajo, you know, I
think the impact is really
uh helping
our, our state
um succeed.
And so madam
chair um
um Miss
uh Vicente,
um
what would you say would be
like a like a priority?
Like if, if we were gonna like,
you know, uh
put, put our, our,
our minds
together. Uh what
would be your number one priority?
Thank you, madam,
sir.
>> Thank you madam chair,
Representative
Hernandez. You
know, that one's hard, but
you know, I'm, I still see the steam
building as being, you know, we're
so close,
we are very close
and I know that,
you know, we're not only just
looking at
doing the advocacy at the
federal level as
well
to see this auditorium
through,
it would be such a win
for San Juan
County and
for the Navajo nation.
I think that you look at a
space that could truly
provide,
you know, showcase of culture,
showcase of language
and showcase of student
leadership.
It's, it's something
that it's, it's how we're
designing.
>> Thank you. Thank you, madam >> chair.
Thank you, Representative Fernandez,
Representative
>> Little.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you so much for the presentation.
Really happy to see all
that's happening um
in your presentation, you were talking
about the funding that you received.
And madam chair, my question
is actually on um
you were pointing out the
complicated
regulations
that are established
that, that
impede the ability
to spend the money.
Um
If it's possible to
uh provide a
brief overview
of
of
brief overview.
My question to you,
madam chair is
whether you have
suggestions on
streamlining these regulations,
given your experience
and the second part of that
is do other trebly controlled
schools have similar
issues? Are you aware of this?
And I'm just wondering
how we might be
able to help that in
that, that piece?
Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you madam chair and
Representative Little at this
time, I I would go
ahead and yield to doctor Tabram
who can kind of share
a little bit more insight
because she's in the midst
of doing this
work.
>> Hello, everybody at a
thank you for the question. Thank
you, Mrs Pundi for the
chance to, to
answer Representative Little's
question,
the question about competitive
um funding through the New Mexico
Public Education Department.
We've been really grateful
for the support of the
the different departments, particularly
the Indian Education Division.
They've had quite a
lot of experience from my
perspective at Naval
prep, the Indian Education
Division led by Assistant
Secretary Winni has
had a lot of experience
in working with sovereign
nations and they have
a, a very in-depth
understanding of tribal
sovereignty and the
way that a tribally controlled school
can help to exercise some of
the that
intent through the
tribe.
Other departments like the college
and career readiness
department have shown
great interest in
supporting our schools. They're
really committed to
ensuring that tribally controlled
schools receive
funding, that they
are
trained in some of the
practices of using that
funding. However,
through some of the, the
rigid program requirements,
there's, there's not as
much
flexibility for
tribally controlled schools to
meet the unique needs of their
their nations.
Um So
this may be related to
federal funding guidelines
through grants like the Perkins
funds, but it might
also be related to
as Mrs Vicente
referenced
um a a need for
additional
support
when it comes
to
honoring some of the budget
adjustment forms and,
and allowing budget
request to change
as programs are
implemented.
If that answers your question,
madam chair.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Um It, it
it does, I'm sure
it's a you might be able
to uh
may I request
actually um
um madam chair.
Um It would
be really helpful
uh And I don't mean to
speak for anybody else
in in the committee, but I think
it would be helpful to have
something in writing
for us to
consider.
Um
And
uh that
can be reviewed
and requested as
well on the other
side uh from the
other side. So
um
if that's possible
madam chair, I think that could be
very helpful
>> and representative in
working with Navajo prep
too Well, actually not just
the Navajo prep, there was other
entities that were
awarded
and then it was clawed
back and some actually
didn't even receive their funding.
So we have a system that's
a little bit splintered
that needs to be worked on.
So we will,
I think that's one of the things we do need
to continue to advocate
for exactly who do we talk
to. So, but
I keep these guys in mind
and some of our other programs
and stuff and that, that
that's what happened to them.
So we should be questioned.
So before the
end of the interim, we will
move something forward.
Thank you. Do you
have any
>> madam chair Representative Little?
We will submit um some
a letter um prior
letter in writing and document
and writing and just
and also if,
if we, if there's
any really, if they
could follow even I A DS
processes, it'd be
great.
So
>> as I understand too, with
CYFD, some of
their, however,
they're doing their program
money is a lot
quicker. They're getting their like it
was weeks but other
departments and agencies
in our in the state,
I don't know what process are. If it's
a technology thing,
it's taking like months
for these requests to fall
through and get
reimbursed and all of that too. The
turnaround
time.
>> Thank you madam chair. No, that's
one of my questions. Thank >> you,
Representative Representative
Roya
Caballero.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank
you and so good to see everybody
again. Thank you very much for your
presentation. I
am
uh just to start off,
I, I do have a couple of
questions, reference
to the page that
had HB two
fif HB 52 and
all of that, your
commentary also
had to do
with
excuse me, the allergies
are headed in this
area,
having difficulty or facing
obstacles in
drawing down
or reimbursements.
And um
so I'm curious as to
whether you've been able to ask
or request Indian
Affairs Department
to help advocate
for you. I know that
we have a lot of difficulty
with
those processes
across the board, but
it's even more difficult
for our tribal nations and
pueblos because
they sometimes have multiple
layers that they
have to go through. And what
we want to do is remove
those barriers. Madam
chair,
particularly
for the
communities that have faced
generations of
disparate
assistance and, and,
and from
rightfully should
have been receiving.
So that is
my first
question.
>> Thank you madam chair and
Representative
>> Roybal Caballero.
The double L is pronounced
like a Y. Thank
you.
>> We, we
definitely would love,
you know, in that same letter
would address to
the Indian.
I think that I
think you're right that they are
a really good advocate for us. And so
we will make sure that we
will address the letter to
them as well, seeking their
advocacy for
us, >> madam
chair. Thank you for that because that's
really critically important.
And I think Mr
Apodaca madam
chair. Is it ok for Mr Apodaca
to go ahead,
Mr
>> madam, chair
representative. Um
I think one thing that would also be
helpful moving forward,
you know, as legislation comes
out, um We find ourselves
always having to maybe go back and
add tr controlled
schools to legislation
to make sure that we're included.
So, you know, you know, maybe
at the Legislative Council service with,
with staff, you know, maybe
that becomes a practice
of including
some of that that would be helpful
to us because we're, you know, I
would have to tell him having to
make sure that we're part of this
conversation. So, thank you madam
chair.
>> That's actually very important
language matters in
getting things done. And
so that
has to be definitely
amended or corrected.
So we will work on that. Thank
you for that Mr
Raka related
to to to this.
Also, I was looking
on
um I
forget now the page
that describes the
services.
Um Anyway, the
question has to do with,
are you able to tap
into uh
USDA
for Food services?
U United States
Department of Agriculture to
help uh
supplement or pay
for the food
services? I'm imagining
that the income levels
of the students more
than qualify. Have
you gone that route
yet?
>> Thank you madam chair and
representative. Yes,
we have applied
for Federal. They,
we're thankful also that
we were able to
access state funding as
well with the after school
or evening dinners.
So and with
the governor's,
her feeding of
Children has
increased from
like a dollar that we would get
from USDA
to I think now it's
3 $4
per meal.
So it is a
significant increase
because we have to remember as a
residential school, I always
tell, I try to always remember
even lawmakers when I'm at the
federal level talking about us
d money
as our students,
we feed
them from
the morning to evening.
And imagine these,
we have some that are growing
young men, growing young
women. They don't get
to just go home and go into the
fridge and just have access,
you know, where their meal.
And so we do go in the
red. I think
our grocery bill, we go at
least I
want to say
maybe about
$300,000 a
year in the red. But when I say in
the red, that means I have to
take from certain funding
in order to make it up. But we do
that because we, we feed
our Children well,
and it's good food.
So you all would
like to eat our cafeteria.
We have a great salad
bar probably the
best in Farmington.
>> Thank you very much. And that
was my concern because
I, you know, I do have grandsons.
I have sons
and it's
never ending. I mean, we
have to be replenishing all
the time, just never-ending
hunger. And,
and that was a big
concern for me too when
I was sending our oldest
grandson off to school
to public
charter school
wondering after
school that he was going to
be there for several hours. My
first question is, oh my gosh.
Do you have a good snack pack? And
they said, no,
absolutely not. The school
recognizes
the importance of
feeding them. And so
and how important,
what role it plays in
their lives in their education.
So, thank you for
that.
And there are other
sources, Mr
Paka and others I might
want to,
there are private
philanthropic
sources that
give to
um
particularly
our communities of color
that live and reside
in pockets of
poverty. And
I can't give you the full list of
them when you put in the search
engine and go into
the, there are several
sources for philanthropy
and just put in
feeding the hunger
or feeding whatever. And there
are several national and
international groups.
They're busy overseas
right now, but they
actually have a
bucket. Uh They
call it a bucket that's
available for
uh depressed communities
in the United States.
So I I would look at
that too to help leverage since
you're mentioned madam
chair that you're in the red.
We don't, we want you to not
be in the red. I guess it
is very difficult to
maintain a residential
school around the clock.
I've seen it here at Indian School
and others. So thank you.
My final question, madam
chair has to do
with you. Have
your educators,
parents,
community members
been participating in
the Yazzie Martinez community
meetings.
>> Thank you so much, madam
chair and
representative.
We um
they recently had a for
in, in Farmington,
I think at the Sycamore
Center. Um We
definitely share the
information. I
love to say that
Navajo prep has been
the beacon of
culturally responsive
education and prior
to even any
court case,
II,
I love that
one that, that
it's been such an
important even
for public
ed and even just for
even bie schools
is that we're being very
cognizant of our
communities and
the identities of our communities.
And how are we ensuring that
curriculum,
student experiences
and policy
development are
always
focused on access
and supporting all Children?
So I'm really thankful
to that. So, but we do
share when we receive the
information
we are,
I feel like, you know, as a
school that's been
founded
in what we've been doing that
we, you know, ensure that,
that we have met almost every
aspect of that
lawsuit,
>> madam chair. And
thank you for that And the reason I ask
is because this is very impressive,
all that you presented was
very impressive. This is a
model for
this is a successful
model that needs
to be shared
with our state public
education department
so that they can witness
firsthand what a
successful model
means and looks like.
And this is owned by
you. This is owned
by a tribal
control school.
So if anyone should
be
providing that
input, So I'm very happy
that you are doing that because
this, there's
no reason why we
cannot be doing this in our
public education across
the state of
100%
graduation
uh in the in
the, in 2025.
That that's
we're not even close to
that around the
state. Someone
needs to understand and hear
and look at what needs
to be incorporated
if you don't mind sharing
the successes because
these are definitely successes
that need need to be
embedded into our
overall education
system for the state. I'm gonna hold
on to this uh
because at our
education
committees
interim and in
session, they need to know
this. And right now
during this process, given the
report, we have to give to the
judge this.
If we don't incorporate
your input, relevant
to all of this, then
I'm afraid that that
might be not looked at very
well by the judge. But
anyway, that's my
little
interjection there. Thank you
madam chair and thank
you, you should be
exceptionally proud
of your school. Thank you very
much. >> Thank you, Representative
Representative
Block.
Sorry. Actually, I have a little
prerogative. The chair
closed captioning
is not working on the
webcasts. Please ask
the chair to acknowledge
it. If
you need closed
captioning, go
to the Zoom broadcasts
out there and there's snacks over here
for
those.
Thank you so much for
providing it and then also a
little participation from
Representative down to go
retrieve it. Thank
you, Representative
Block. >> Thank you madam
chair. Thank you all for your great
presentation. You always do a good
job. It was great to be at your
campus a couple of years ago for
the health committee, I believe.
And uh got to see all the
cool sites that you have a
couple of questions. I'll be brief.
So madam chair
panel, I'm wondering when it comes to
the the building that you had to
demolish. Unfortunately,
which kind of is stupid. In my
opinion, the federal government.
It's, it's very uh ironic
honestly. So
uh I'm wondering, did
you guys consider for other
buildings that may be in that same
time period to
try to get a
national historic
site designation? Because I know that
they do have some exceptions
when it comes to ad a accessibility.
I know it's generally very
broad, but there are some exceptions.
I'm just wondering if you guys looked at
that.
>> Thank you madam
chair and Representative Lock
for that question. We
did consider
historic
preservation. Our
school is not under
current historic preservation.
We did let the Navajo
Nation come in and they
went and did
pictures and kind of
went and did their part
prior to us being able
to demolish the
building. But
they didn't give us any that
they would put it ever or
deem it as a historical
site. So,
um that's kind of, and
then trying to go
after funding for
historical preservation
dollars, it was,
we searched that first,
but it's so
you have to come up with all these
matches and,
and we already know that
if we were to have
renovated it probably
now with
GMP prices
being at
nine in
some parts of the state, $900
a square foot. I
just don't know how realistic
$36,000
at that level would ever
have happened.
So we
weighed the options.
We did do a structural
analysis
and found that the
structure would not
even if we would have renovated, we'd
have to completely
restructure
and do supports
because the rebar on
the very bottom stairs
were already exposed.
And they said there would
be no instructional engineer
who would even sign off on
that building. So
we did do an extensive
research prior to
making that
decision.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you for that.
And yeah, I it's just
sad to see all that
history, but I'm sure there's
pictures or what or whatever, but a
picture can never be
replacing that. So uh
madam chair representative. Uh
not representative. Pardon me?
I, I feel like I'm back in session.
Right, madam
chair representative. So I
guess my next question is actually
in that same vein when it comes
to, to tracking down all these
dollars for funding
all these programs, buildings,
etcetera. How many
people on your staff are
dedicated
specifically? Or maybe,
you know, we're all jacks of all trades.
So how many people are really
working on following the money
and getting it in the bank
for the
school?
>> Um Thank you for that question,
madam, chair representative.
I think it's us in this
room.
We're, we're a small
team of, but we're a mighty
team.
>> That's amazing. Well, you're doing the
Lord's work. I don't know how you do
it. So, you know, we
need more legislators like you
guys and people in our in all
over the place just working hard like
you guys because it's amazing and,
and we're very blessed that you guys
continue to do a good
job and continue
to preserve the culture, which I think
is just number one priority,
which is amazing. And I loved,
I loved your presentation when you
talked about the different
skills that they're learning, especially
when it comes to weaving. I
had no idea that
that's how it's taught.
And so it's amazing that
these young people are
getting these really powerful
skills to pass
on. So how many,
how many students do you usually
have in a classroom when it comes to
something like
that?
>> It's a madam
chair representative on two
things. It's
a, the
Demato Arts class
is in our group
six component of the
IB in the Middle years
program. And so
I think right now we have about
80 students,
freshmen who take
that course.
And then,
but also when you look
at just organization
of a school entity, I
I would be remiss if I didn't
shout out my campus development
team, we
meet at least every
other week
and we look at our dollars,
we look at grant
dollars, we look at capital
outlay dollars. We
prioritize our projects.
We have, if they're going to
bring anything before us, they have to
have a budget in place.
They have to know that they have
either three quotes, knowing our
procurement rules, three
quotes or
or be a ce S
vendor. So we're very
organized for a small
little school in
our campus development conversations
so that we can be
efficient with state dollars
and federal and tribal
dollars. >> Thank
you. Thank you so much, madam. Chair and
thank you for that. And also
it's good to see that some of
these students came to the roundhouse.
If they ever need someone to
to shadow someday, I would
be happy to have a, a
couple of students or three or
four or however many they'll let
on the house floor because we
need better. We need, we need
people to, to follow
good legislators,
right?
Thank you madam
chair
that
>> madam on on that
point. Um
Do all of you guys have, you
guys have visits with our students
at one point or another? Is there
anybody who hasn't?
So we can send them to you? Yes,
they are. So and again,
this is just part of that curriculum
that um
that Naville prep is in still
learning this process which
has been used.
So >> don't even
let them observe
block.
>> Oh, I'm sure they're observing
that
>> 99% of
it. Representative
a
beta.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you
for being here to
Navajo prep team.
Uh I appreciate
the conversation and
your handouts.
They're very informative.
Uh But just going back before we
get to the Indigenous Steam
Building, how many students
apply to Navajo prep every
year?
>> Um We normally have about
200 or 215
applicants
and this year we accepted a freshman
class of 85
>> 85. Thank you.
And what's the eligibility and
criteria you use to accept
students?
>> We have a holistic application
process So our students
um must have a minimum of a
2.3 GPA in their
middle school. But
we're really proud
and honored to serve
so many different communities from
across the Naval nation, Phoenix
Albuquerque. We have students who come
from other states out of the
area. Um So
for us and
interest and willingness
and passion to learn. Nave
language and culture is a really
important component.
Our application process
includes a student interview as
well as a family interview.
Um Those students also
write a short essay about
how they want their education
to serve their
themselves and their community.
Uh We also include a
new a test um just
to determine
um levels of
math and English. And
we're actually expanding our admission
process to include naval
language um
assessment data as
well.
>> You need
your
Yeah.
>> All right
madam chair
um is 85
your hard number for
acceptance
or is that what you
have capacity for? How do you get
to 85 from
200?
>> So 85 is an
increase for us in the
past few years, we've
seen that our
freshman class
increase to
the number of 85. We
are uh as MP
was explaining earlier, operating
in some older buildings that have
smaller class sizes, which is
also something our students and families
love. So we have
an average class size of
about 18 to 20.
So based on our current
capacity, our class
sizes, the number of classrooms.
We have the number of teachers.
85 is
the negotiated freshman
total that we can,
that we can ensure we're
providing support through our academics
department as well as
residential.
>> Thank you uh
Manager
Navajo prep. T My next
question is about
um your capital
outlay. Who is your
fiscal agent for
that
>> madam chair? Thank you representative.
We are, we are our own fiscal
agent.
>> Thank you and just clarification,
you all fund this yourself
and then you get the
reimbursements,
>> correct?
>> Thank you. My next
question about your indigenous
steam building project. I see
you have a couple of
million that you've already
received. Who is
your architect for the building right
now?
>> It is um F
BT out of
Albuquerque.
>> And when madam chair
team, when do you expect
for your design to be
complete?
>> We're anticipating
for a January
14th,
2026 design
build, 100%
preconstruction
designs.
>> Can you help me understand what that
means? >> It means
that when
you, when you do a
design build, you
um we went in with a
contractor and an
architect, our contractors
FC I
and we
are, we'll be
staging, we'll probably this
first, maybe by October,
we'll get conceptual
designs and then maybe
by, well
October, I think, and then we'll
start going 50%
designs where we are able
to change and say,
ok, yes, not
a bathroom there or maybe
this. But by the time we
get to 100% designs. That
means we're ready to break down
and go for
and they can actually
start the construction
because everything will be
determined. Heating
cooling
corridors.
We'll have already had
every aspect of
that. We'll have already picked
out what doors, what
flooring, what
doorknobs everything
and we'll have that by
January
>> manager.
No, prep team. Thank you. And that's
January 2026
goal. Yes.
Ok. And then
construction would
begin.
>> It's all dependent on
all of that funding coming
together. I need the Navajo
Nation support. >> Thank
you madam chair. Thank you, team.
And I ask only because these
are significant amounts
of money and my concern would
be any exploration on
them or how fast you're
able to expend them. So,
thank you. That provides a lot of
clarification. I
think those are the only
questions. Thank you for your
presentation. >> Thank
you. >> Thank you. Any
other questions for members?
Representative
Zamora? >> Thank
you madam chair and thank
you presenters. I want to
commend you on your work.
I want to commend you on your
school. You guys,
it's very impressive when we go
there and we see the students and,
and, and their character
and, and, and how
they present themselves
very, very good
job on your part and your
team
and madam
chair and, and presenters,
what, what led
to the highest count of
students that you have now? Is it,
was it the money or was
it where
you're at on your
growth or, or
what made this
this uh
student body that
you have now the highest count?
>> Thank you so much madam chair
and representatives more for that
question. It was the building
of the new home
that led to being
able to accept more residential
students and
we wish we could accept
all students
and be,
you know, I I even still
getting challenged,
do some satellite
schools and go out here.
I'm like, you know,
but that's something that's in the
future is, you know, how do
we again expand
that reach so that we can be
impacting more? But
it's building of that new home that
really contributed to increased
numbers. It opened
up that we can admit more
students
>> and, and madam chair and, and
presenters and that's because of your
persistence and your hard work.
And it's, you're, you're
reaping the fruit of, of your hard
works and that's great to
see. Thank
you madam chair. That's all my comments
and questions.
>> Thank you. May I think to
members here because Representative
Zamor has been on this committee
for, I think since I,
I think since we, since
I started
chair.
So and even to
the school here
that they,
this is all evolved out
of many, many years and
it's gone. I mean,
we're still, there's still some
work to be done, but it's, it's
come a long way. Um,
since the, since
the inception
of it and a lot of it
too, when we look at some of
the presentation materials back
then. But
I know there's just a couple of
things that weren't really
mentioned. But keep in mind as we
move forward with the
transportation part, I
understand that, you know, you
do have spending there
and with the kids
or students coming into
the area
because I think that's something we still
haven't really tackled
too much moving
forward and the music
program too because
Navajo Nation has a band, but
it's dwindling very
quickly and
we haven't really had too much
push, I think throughout the state
as far as music and getting
that going because I think
there's a lot of benefits to having
that the,
the funding that we put there
too is also
assuring that with the,
you know, adjustments to inflation
in that, you know, you
have that request there.
But those finishing
funding mechanisms within
our budget be there.
So when they do, if there
is a shortfall that
we're not, you know, coming back
to too long
to to fill it
so that they can finish these projects
to our members, especially those on
LFC that are
here and I appreciate
the work
with the portfolios on the
artwork because it is a
process in
order to move forward, especially
if you want to enter into
that, that area of
school. And
the assess one thing I would
like to ask is the
assessment that you guys
have the students take
more or less
in regards to the students in
New Mexico, if
they don't meet the
criteria, if
you could help us or
have you been provide
or has there been an inquiry
about the data
for the students like the schools
that they're coming from where they're
not not
qualifying to be
at Navajo prep
and where we're really
hurting there and
where our students
are applying because
students that go to Navajo prep,
it's not like, oh, I'm going to wake
up my freshman
year. I don't want to go to Navajo
prep. It's a decision
that the family does know
in our area with, especially
with the nation. It is
something you planned for.
And that's why we also get a lot
of alumnus coming through
because somebody in the family
really saw the benefits
of pursuing a great
education. But the work
that you guys do is
invaluable to us in that
area. I think
that's the only inquiry I have
represent Hernandez.
Did you have something
else?
>> Thank you madam
chair. I just um
remembered a chapter
meeting. I attended Shiprock
chapter and
they expressed concerns
with the
uh Sassi Shiprock
Alternative Schools
Incorporated,
their um
federal
cuts that they
received. Uh
having to let
go. Uh
the entire residential
staff
over
at, at school.
Are, are you guys
having
anything
any similars because
Sassi and Nava
prep are
almost like the in the
under the same umbrella. Is that correct
madam chair? Or, or,
or can you explain
the difference between you and
other Navajo Bie
schools madam
chair?
>> Thank you madam chair and
representative.
There's
Sassi is a tribally
controlled school as well. They
still receive federal
dollars.
I can't really speak
to their whole funding
structure, but I can speak to
our federal dollars.
We
are
as part of our advocacy
is always to ask
for additional funding even
through the federal government. And so we
do do a lot of advocacy at
that level and
we reach
out to lawmakers and
appropriation committee members
so that they know
that as they
redline certain
out of budgets that
there's schools that are
impacted. And so we do that
work. We're very active, not
only in state, but
at the federal level,
I don't know as
the particulars,
but we're not impacted
by current federal government,
federal funding just
only the 21st century
competitive grant process.
One, that's all that
we, we were
delayed. I think everybody
was delayed on title one money
that comes from the US Department of
Education.
But for the most
part, we've all
received our disbursement
since because
we're for funded through the
federal government.
And we're on a current
continued resolution
which now we're anticipating
another continued resolution
going into this next
fiscal cycle,
we will stay
stagnant. We'll
stay at the same funding
flatlined at the same
funding levels as I
think 2024.
So I,
I do know
that they're
still trying to create their
residential program.
And I think, you know,
our funding is based on
weighted student unit
and we get extra dollars
when we have students
who are
residential
students. So if you don't
have students in the residential
program, there
could be impacts for
that.
So that
potentially could be,
but I I can't speak
to any of their budget or what
they do with their
funding
>> madam chair on the
residential program
that you guys have. Uh
there's also another
residential program,
uh
bie
program in
Aztec, the Kintail
Dormitory,
madam chair. I'm just
trying to see, you know, would, would,
would that, you know,
has, has that been explored
or is there any relationship between
Kintail and
Naval prep madam
chair? >> Thank you
madam chair representative
for that. Yes, we have,
they too are
a residential
program. Their students
attend Aztec high
school and they
do receive residential
money so
that they stay. And there
has been,
you know, if, if we ever needed
an overflow site, we've
actually looked into that
location. I'm
proud that I think
are they receive
federal funding for a new
residential
facility?
And that's, that's
one thing they're kind of waiting on
before we start
sharing
space.
Thank you madam >> chair
because the grant schools are
are for funded. But if it's
still like the bie controlled,
it becomes a whole different
entity and it is on
your thing.
And I think that's one of the points you
guys every time you come to
session is
it's not, they
get way less funding
per people than what we
provide as a state which causes
some of these. So any kind of
budget issue, it also
increases that as we move
forward. Um
But I was going to go back to the letter here.
So we have the letter here
for the, but we don't have
quorum So, but I think
tomorrow we'll have quorum, that's why we
haven't um adopted the
minutes, but it is in your folder.
So look it over and then
we'll entertain
this letter tomorrow
again if need be
for Mr Apica.
And
>> thank you for that, that I was going to
bring that up. Um,
but also, um,
tomorrow we're going to be meeting with
LFC staff,
you know, in addition to kind
of have the same
conversation, uh
one area that we may need
some help um
with during the legislative
process is um
talk to um
Mr So about, you know, some of
the, you know, the fine
financing, what's going to be available and
whatnot looks like. There might be a lot
of um
you know, one time funding
opportunities. Um
But we're also trying
to, and you guys have been very gracious
in helping us get on the statewide
initiatives. We're also going to
be having a conversation tomorrow with
LFC about on the General
obligation bond
package. So,
um
some of the initial conversations
like they're like, no, you're not eligible,
but we, we, we
have,
I don't evidence that
there have been precedents.
So stay
tuned. >> I think the
thing with the go
particular it was because
of the
mine and the power part
shedding. There were some
issues with
extending that
debt in that area,
but we will see
to be continued on that
representative of
a >> thank you
chairwoman for indulging me for one more
question. Thank you. Team.
I noticed that there was a
98% figure
in here for Native American students.
So your 2% are
they eligible for
the weighted student unit paid by
the federal government? So,
how do they pay
for school or
is it waived? How do you, what
happens there? Because
we're hearing that on
the state side.
10,000, your
side? 7000. But if they're
caught in that, in between,
what are they paying? Thank
you. >> Um Are
those that don't have a
certificate of Indian
blood they
pay? I think a $3000
fee
and for the whole
year and
we cover the rest.
>> Thank you, >> Representative
Dow.
>> Thank you madam chair. That is
interesting to me because you're a public
charter. Is that correct?
>> We are not public charter.
We're tribally
controlled through the
Bureau of Indian Education,
tribally controlled grant school.
>> So then do you accept
scholarship tuition
for Bella
or
there are
several?
>> We don't have a tuition,
we just call them fees.
You know, because of
that gap that you see, of the
weighted student unit and
even from what we received
the f we just make
it up in other grants
and other ways that
we've come together. So
our students pay a
fee and,
but it's not viewed as a tuition.
I think if it was a tuition,
I would, you
know, we know what, even our state in
Mexico, if all the kids actually
paid for what
we provide.
I'm sure they would be
in the 30 to
40,000 and have some
ticket price like
Albuquerque Academy or some
of these local
schools,
>> madam chair and
committee. I
believe Albuquerque public
school. When you count their
property tax, the
mill levies and everything have
now exceeded $35,000
per student for the public tuition
cost, which is
greater than Albuquerque Academy,
which is at 28,000 based
on their endowment.
I think next is like Sandia
prep at 17,000
hopes around 11 and throughout
the state, it's less than 10.
So thank you
>> if I can add madam
chair. Uh we do have
scholarships that are available to
our students through private
donors that are given
to the school and then
distributed through a selected
application process that we
administer.
Yeah. Um and one
more addition to um
madam chair's inquiry
about the assessment
practice, our, our
admissions is truly holistic.
So we look at the entire
students application and story
that they're sharing. And
for us, one of the
really important components
is serving areas that
have not previously been served.
So looking for students
who are the first from their school to ever
apply to Nevo prep is really
important to us. A
couple of years ago, we got a
call from White
Rock chapter and they
said your
graduate was the first
student from our chapter to
ever get the Chief Manito
scholarship and things like
that mean a
great deal for us
because of the reach
that we aim to serve
the entire Navajo nation and
beyond. >> Then
the lifts can
do a tremendous lift to the
community for the
student scenario. So thank you for
all the work you guys to do. Thank you for
being here, even though it's
we're way over
here
in this other area,
but appreciate it
anytime come and
see us and you know, you have
my support. So
any closing remarks or you're
good?
>> No, I just can't express
enough um
that we are
thankful and
also appreciate the work that
you do. Um I know
that it it can
be a lot and sometimes
they're long days, but I
just really appreciate all
the work and the love that you have
for your
communities
>> madam >> chair. I am so sorry. Ok,
I love this letter and
I'm just wondering, did you guys
support? How did you feel
about Senator Shinto's
Tribal?
Yes.
Did you support your
>> um I could say that I would
have wanted to create
a K
eight compact
school that would then feed
into that prep.
That would be wonderful. Thank
you,
>> Representative
Block.
>> Are you sure we don't have a
quorum?
>> I have
one or
two
Johnson's not
here.
>> Her under the bus.
We're
>> one.
>> We are
madam
madam
chair, >> Representative
Caballero has two
Mikes so we can count her
twice
>> if you want. We can make a phone
call,
we just need one more
and we could, we can
make that call, but it does take a little bit
of time for approval, but we'll move
on to the next presentation if you
want to hang around and let's get
that through if you guys want to
entertain a motion. Is that
my understanding, sir,
I'd like to make a motion.
Ok? Once we get the approval
and our quorum, then
we'll come back to
that.
So again,
the the closed
captioning is still not
working.
So you have to read our
lips,
they're not working. So go to
the zoom and we have our next
presenters. Please come
up and members
be mindful of the
time we have
here
um For
if you want to get on the road
or
with your questions
because some of these conversations
can be taken aside too if
there's even some
bigger
concerns
>> to.
>> Ok, we have the
update from the Office of
Indian Elder Affairs at
the Aging and long term
services Department.
Emily and
Melissa
secretary and director.
Welcome. And you may join us
and have you used the mics
before you're familiar with
it. Red light
on. Try not to have to on.
All right, >> thank
you.
I got
the
Yeah,
>> thank you, madam,
chair members of the
committee. It's such
a pleasure to be here. My
name is Emily Kaltenbach.
I'm the Secretary of Aging
and long-term Services.
Can you hear it better now?
Thank you, madam
chair.
Um With me
today is our office
of Indian Elder Affairs
Director and our tribal
liaison, Melissa
Sanchez.
Um and I want to just take a
moment to introduce
two of our staff who traveled
up as well.
Bianca Mitchell, who's our
deputy director of the Office
of Indian Indian
Elder Affairs, who's behind
you, Julie
Sanchez, who just joined
us as the Director of Policy
and planning and special projects.
So I just want to thank them
for getting us
here and helping out
with the presentation
today.
I know I've worked with many
of you with different
hats on over the years.
So it's wonderful to see you
um for those of you who
don't know
me and I've been with the
department now just since
November um
of this past year. It's
been an amazing
now, gosh,
89 months
and I, I
was with the department
back in
2006 through
2011. And
so it feels really great to be
back working on these
issues that are
impacting our older adults
and adults living with
disabilities.
Um I also want to thank all
of you for
all of your support and
funding. I just want to
share that over
$13 million
that you appropriated
are going directly
from our department
out into our tribes club as a
nations for both capital
outlay, direct
services in
senior centers,
as well as food,
which we know is hugely
important through the New Mexico Grown
program. And we'll talk a
little bit about those programs in a
minute. But um
thank you so much for that
ongoing support.
I'm gonna, we have two
handouts today
um For you. One is our
tribal collaboration report.
Hot off the press. Uh
So I just want to let you know you have
that and then here's a
slide deck. We're not gonna
walk through all
the information today. It's
really long, but we
wanted, we always want to provide
more information in writing
and happy to follow up with
any of you if you have questions.
Um Just briefly, uh
not all states
have a department of
aging and long term services
and so proud of New
Mexico for
elevating
um our, our
older adults.
I'm sure you've all heard that.
But in the next
five years, 10
years, we're
gonna be almost leading
the nation in the number of older
adults, a number of people
over 65.
And we have to
be paying attention. Now, when
I was with the department almost 20
years ago, we
saw this demographic
shift coming, but our
funding has not kept
up with the
growth. And
so,
you know, I just, I want to
highlight and call, it's a
call to action that we
make sure we're supporting our older
adults, many of whom
we know live in rural
areas, many of whom
we want to keep healthy
in their home and community because that's
where they want to be.
Um And we
don't have a lot of caregivers
as you know, and so we rely
often on our
friends and families
and neighbors to provide
the majority of long-term care
services in the state. They are
really the backbone of long term
care. And so I'm
very proud of our department
because we are
hyper focussed
on these issues.
And um I'm gonna share a
little bit with you
about um
the work we've done.
Um
I'm not, again, I'm not going through all
these slides, but if you look
on page four at the top,
you can see our little
org chart,
what is not
represented there and
very exciting again, because
of your support. And thank you
is that we've relaunched
our long term care division as
of July 1st.
And the
reason I just mentioned this
and highlight it is
that that
department or that division
within the department is
focused on
making sure that
people can get the services and
supports they need in their home and
community and
supporting their caregivers. So you
may have heard about the New Mexica
program, New
Mexica are for,
we're paying
informal caregivers
every month
um for the care
that they were already providing.
Um that
includes um
members of tribes, Pueblos and
nations. And so
that's up to $1400 a
month. These are for individuals who
are not eligible for
Medicaid, they may be right
over that threshold.
Um And so we're very
excited that that
program has launched.
Um And we
are about to roll it out in
Bernalillo and Dona Ana
County. Um And
we've been able to triple the number
of enrollees
since in the last
nine months. Um So I'm
excited about the long term care
division. I just wanted to mention
that, but you can see
we
are the agency of
record for the
federal government. We are the
state unit on aging
and so federal dollars
come into our department
and go out to
local providers for senior
services. That's meals, that's
transportation, that's
respite care, that's health
promotion. We
combine that with our state
dollars. Um
We have a consumer
and the rights division,
a central intake for
all calls around the
state for
people who are trying to navigate
a very complicated long
term care system. That's
our Aging and Disability Resource
Center. We are Adult
Protective Services
many years ago.
As many of you remember,
we, we separated
from Children Youth and Families
Department. We have an
incredible team
out in every
county across New
Mexico,
protecting
our most vulnerable who are
often uh victims
of abuse, neglect and
exploitation,
financial exploitation,
fraud. We're seeing real
growth, a lot of self
neglect and a lot of
really complex behavioral health
cases that our
investigative workers come
across.
And um and
so that's, and then our ombuds
ombudsman team. So those
are individuals who go
protect the rights of,
of our residents
who are living in long term
care facilities
um and who need
to be there, but they need
an advocate. They need a
voice. Um
Someone who's ensuring
that there's quality of
care.
Ok. I'm gonna share,
pass over the
mic to Melissa
to share a bit about our Office of
Indian Elder Affairs. Thanks.
Thank
you.
>> It's the first time I've used one of these
ones.
Gois
Iho
Melissa Sanchez,
Alco,
Elta. I'm
Melissa Sanchez. I'm from
Acaa and Laguna Pueblos.
Hello, everyone,
madam, chair members of the
committee
Yate.
Um Just happy to be
here and I'm
happy to be able to have this
opportunity to speak
to you all. Thank you, secretary.
Um, wanted to go
over a little bit about Office
of Indian Elder Affairs
and that
is slide
page four, slide
eight.
The Office of Indian Elder Affairs
was created in
2004
and it's within
our aging and long term
services department.
And we serve as the office
that supports New Mexico's
23 tribes, Pueblos
and nations in the
development of a comprehensive
and coordinated sys service
system, senior service
system of tribal
senior centers and adult
day centers. Our
general operational
functions include
advocating for and
facilitating state general
funding allocations.
Um I
I AAA and N AAA.
We'll explain that in a bit
contract management of
state general funds, technical
assistance, advocacy
and training. Our
mission is to coordinate
and enhance a system of
services that empowers American
Indian elder elders
with support and resources
to live a healthy lifestyle
with joy, respect and
dignity in their
tribal communities.
I want to go to the next slide,
please.
So right now,
Office of Indian Elder
Affairs is fully staffed.
We have um six
staff members and currently we
also have an additional staff
member through January
um within the
AmeriCorps
Vista Member grant.
Um She's uh she
will be working with us
a few more months, there has
been a really great addition to the
staff. So you'll
see. Um I'd also like to
point out that
um we have uh
two D on our
team and we
also have uh
two Pueblos. So,
um I guess we just need Miss
Apache.
So we want to go to the next
slide. The
secretary.
>> Thank you, Melissa. So,
when I mentioned earlier, we
get federal dollars
that come down
to the state
and that's through the older Americans
Act. Um
However, and
this is, it's a little
different um
because
they are both title
$3 and
they title $6
if we could go to the next
slide.
Um How the older Americans
Act works is that
there is a state unit at
aging
and then
it is required under the
older Americans Act, which
has been around a very long
time, very
old perhaps needs
to be updated as well.
Is that the money comes,
then it comes to us as
a state unit on aging and
then it has to go out to area
agencies on aging.
So those are either
public or
private nonprofit
agencies. It can't be the
State United Aging and
then they
contract with local
providers.
The intention was great
in the sense that they wanted to make
sure that there was
more
that, that the dollars
were addressing real community
needs and that the
area agencies on
aging had a better
sense of what the community needs
were than the state.
But as one can
imagine their
administrative costs. So
we're, you know, when
it comes down to the direct
service providers, they're getting
less dollars. Really.
It's the seniors who are
getting less services,
but that's the structure that we have
to work with.
Um, we
have
two, actually,
three federally
recognized
ale A. So that's the
metro, which is the
Bernalillo County and the city
of Albuquerque actually
c
serves as the,
the AAA. Then
we have non metro, that's
every single
uh county outside
of uh
the Bernalillo area.
And actually, oh, thank you. So
you can see on this
slide and
then we have the Navajo Nation
AAA, our
dollars, our federal
dollars actually, we have
a tri-state agreement
with Utah and Arizona.
So our dollars go to
Arizona. Arizona is the
fiscal agent for those
federal dollars for the
nation. We
also pass through,
we have direct contracts
with the nation for
our state General Fund, but the
federal dollars go to
Arizona our portion
and then they
manage that. And then
we have
Indian A AAA
that is our office of Indian
Elder Affairs
though that
A AAA only manages General
Fund money. And I'll explain
this in a minute. So they manage
just the General fund money
and potentially title
III. So if we go to the next slide,
I know it's very complicated but I
want to, sorry, this
is just a map. So you can
see the different
areas. And
Bianca the next one.
Ok. So we have our
state and our federal
funds
and this is on
slide
14 on page
seven.
And under the older American
Act, we have title six and
title $3.
Title $3 flow
through aging and long-term services
department. Title
$6 go directly
to the tribe's pueblos and nations.
It is complicated and
I'm not, I don't expect anyone
to understand, but I want to just
share how complicated it
is because
our tribes, clubs and nations and
senior centers have
to manage title
6 $6.
They have to manage general
fund dollars
and they
have the
opportunity to apply for title
$3. I
bet you can imagine that there are
different reporting
mechanisms and
data collection
and eligibility
requirements. So it's
not easy and it's something
that we want
to make sure as a department, we're
communicating better and we're
working with our tribes puu and
nations to provide that
technical assistance and support
because of the complexity
of it. So we actually
hosted some tribal
consultations
in the late
spring, early summer
to start talking about
this relationship
and how we can
better support our
tribes, pueblos and nations
in getting title $3
because right now, no
tribe, our pueblo
gets title $3
because they haven't applied
for them. So those title
I dollars are going to
the other senior centers that
are not on tribal lands,
but our tribal seniors
need to access those dollars
that it's intended for them because it's
based on census
data. So we're working
on a way with
um our tribes pueblos and nations
on how to better streamline,
how to better support and
how better
manage all of these
different dollars and
partners and
intermediaries. So
again, I'm gonna stop there
with the, the funding
outline, but I just
think it's important
to share how complicated
that is and how much
technical assistance is
needed. And so
I just want to commend the
Office of Indiana Elder Affairs.
Their staff are working
with the
directors of these senior
centers
and trying to provi
provide that technical assistance
and education and are doing
an incredible job
uh back to
you.
>> Thank you secretary madam,
chair members of the
committee.
Yes, it is complicated.
Our little
structure there helps
sort it out. But it
also,
I guess we should take into consideration
that some senior centers,
some centers, Adult day
receive tribal
funds as well. So they're having to
manage that as
well
also. So we wanted to move
to the next slide,
please, Bianca and
this is where
the funding really
benefits the tribal elders.
So within the I AAA,
there are 21
senior centers and four
adult day centers. And
the A AAA A
is are the Pueblos
and Apaches. You have
the Navajo
Nation AAA A
A and there are 29
centers within
their, it's under
the Department of Aging
and long term care services
department.
This one's New Mexico only.
Yes.
And amongst those services,
you might find incent
meals, home delivered, meals,
case management,
transportation,
etcetera. Um
It just really varies per
center on what is
available and also has
a lot to do with other factors such
as staffing. Um
So we can get into that in
just a little bit.
So on page
seven of the State Tribal
Collaborations Act, you will find a
list of the centers.
So Bianca, please go
to the next
slide.
So uh just a little
bit of a summary.
Um
throughout. Uh as FFY
25 began June
July July
1.
Um Oie A
in partnership
with
the tribal Senior and
Adult Day Centers focused on
supporting
effective standard operations.
What the secretary was referring
to. We did an
assessment and we will continue
to do so to
enhance those systems.
Um make user
friendly a to use the term
user-friendly for our
tribes.
Really always
trying to increase our communication
and outreach and some of the key
initiatives are a gaps
in needs analysis and we'll talk a
little bit more about
that. Also capital
outlay support all of us know
that capital outlay can get super
confusing. Um
So there's also the resource
of capital outlay support and
emergency funding through A
LTSD
bless you. Nutrition
support is
a big
concern for our
tribal elders and
services expansion was
also through the
Senior Services
Initiative Expansion
Grant and we'll touch on that as
well. Um
There were some challenges
that and
for our tribes,
um some of
those uh continue
to
um be
persistent and that's
the extremely high
staff turnover
and understaffing.
Um We're doing our best
to support a
staff and then
um perhaps for many
reasons, the staff turns over
and then we will have to retrain
as best we can. So
we're continuously
supporting them in that
way. Also some
senior centers great,
they are under
upgrading or
additions. However,
some have experienced
construction delays.
There was a COVID
resurgence which affected
some of the programming and
also had
some closure impacts
natural disasters, forest
fires in Mescalero,
we were able to help by sending
1500 meals to
the Mescalero Senior
Center. Um,
and also I'm, I know
we're all aware of the federal
concerns that um, we
all have especially the senior
centers, um,
they're affected through title
six. So,
um throughout the challenges,
so the dedication of the tribal
providers is evident through
increases in elder
participation at the
center, center
activities, the
meals, the amount of meals
both in center
and home delivered
monthly meeting attendance
for us and
funding allocation
expenditures with
a focus on nutrition. Those are all
increasing and those are
while they are challenges they're
being faced in um
being addressed.
So I want to go to
the
next slide
secretary.
>> Let me that. Thank you,
Melissa. And I just want to share
that this last year. We
were, the contractors
were able to draw down a lot
more than they have in previous
years. And that was really
a testament to the work
of the Office of Indian Elder
Affairs and that technical
assistance, both our New
Mexico Grown dollars
and our direct
general fund dollars.
So the Office of Indian Elder
Affairs, we,
they manage these contracts,
but they're also instrumental
in helping all of our other
divisions and
the collaboration with, with
tribes, pueblos and nations. And so
I'm not going to go through this, but just
some highlights
include obviously the
capital outlay. So a
huge amount of dollars,
as I mentioned, I think here,
it's like over
what $6 million in
capital outlay just this last
year. Um Those are
for new projects and we're
still
managing all of
those past year projects
as well. It is
hard to get those dollars drawn
down and that's hugely
important. And so why we need the
team to be focused on
that? Um A couple other
real exciting things we were
able to get what are called
smart TV S in, in
almost all of the
tribal senior centers
um where we can actually
provide real time information,
health promotion activities.
Um It's a way to just
have uh be
able to
pipe in information
directly into the senior center.
It's a way for us to communicate.
And so that's very
exciting and just went live this
year
so
quickly, we'll do a
couple of accomplishments
from a Indian Elder
Affairs and we'll close
out.
>> So we want to go, I wanted to
point out on the handout,
my apologies.
Um This
information didn't all fit
on the slide
19 there. It is
in 2021.
So to clarify
that.
So we are going
to
on your handouts.
Uh page
10 slide
20.
Sorry about that.
The one of
our accomplishments, um
You'll see it all listed out and it's
referenced and supported in
the state Tribal Collaborations Act
report, but improve
communication outreach.
Um We're
constantly in touch through meetings,
uh email communications
and we've launched two newsletters,
one specifically for
tribal providers and
one for the general public
audience who has an interest
in Native American
tribal elders, healthy
aging. So please sign
up, um
get a plug in there.
Um Also um
the a and
our own uh capital outlay,
they have really
um increase
their amount of
communications in regards to
the applications cycle,
the timeline and
assistant
um Our office of a
secretary has been
making center visit
site visits, um
attending tribal meetings, A
PC G.
Um She mentioned
before tribal consultation,
we did 1 to 5 of
those meetings um
early spring, late spring,
early summer and
then um going
on to number two
of accomplishments.
Um We've implemented
department and Oie a initiatives
and one in particular that's it's
ongoing now is we've
launched a gaps and needs
analysis. Um This
project strives to improve the
quality of life long
term for our tribal elders
through accurate data from
the tribal providers.
Um We have
our little team of
um Antonella Harrison,
special projects coordinator
and the AmeriCorps Vista member. I
mentioned Juliana Wagner
um in the
from February to June, they
visited 16 sites and I
think just in the last month have
gone to six more sites since
then. Um And what
they are doing is
input on
um
on
barriers, challenges
and also successes
at the tribal providers,
the senior centers, Adult
Day Centers that are
specific to them. We
know in rural
Navajo nation land, it might
take longer for an ambulance to
arrive than it might
than a pueblo that's
closer to Albuquerque.
So that information is super
important. It hasn't been on
behalf of a LTSD
and we hope long term that that will
help us strategize for
the tribal providers.
So we also
have been implementing department
and OIE A initiatives.
There's a whole category
there. The Vista
project budget training,
new manager training,
nutrition training, new
Mexico grow, training. If you
need training, we got
it
our oie, a newsletter
and technical assistance
training, which
is
really
important in the process
of expending the
funds. So
uh we'll go to number three
and we increased support to
the tribes to
improve operational
effectiveness. Um One
thing in particular
that we're trying to be
assist uh of
assistance with is helping
um our tribal
leadership fiscal teams.
Um The provi
tribal provider teams
understand where they're at within
their ias each
quarter. Um
Meaning, um
how much have they spent
down? Have they
gotten their monthly
activity calendars? And
we have a little sheet that
lets them know this one's
missing. Um This is
where you're at. Great job
and if there's
an expenditure that isn't
happening, um
we get alerted as to why
so we can follow up with
them is training
needed. It
helps us start those conversations
about how we can support them in
100% funding
expenditures.
Um And we
disseminate those to
the uh tribal
leadership
whenever we have an opportunity.
I think the latest opportunity was
at the state Tribal
Summit at San
Union School
for our tribal A LTD
has
dedicated
a line within our
800 number for
OIE A and we are
continuously receiving
an increased amount of calls
from tribal members
looking for information
services, resources.
And then
it has been mentioned before.
There's more
ongoing interdepartmental
collaborations within A
LTSD
and that's been really nice to be
a part of that and having those discussions
on how we are all helping
the tribes and how we can
accomplish more on behalf
of the tribes. So we want
to go
to
goals and objectives.
Um Secretary
mentioned title three
and title six previously,
So we will go
to number
two technical assistance
to approve improve
senior services and that's tied
in the first one with the
AmeriCorps Vista project.
Um in that
those efforts will help
support a Ltsdoie,
a strategic plan on
behalf of our tribal
providers and identify
the challenges they are
facing um
training and training
development. We
will continue to increase
training by equipping
our providers and their fiscal
staff with tailor technical
assistance of each tribal
administration structure
varies. We all know that.
And so what
works at one tribe might
not work at the, the other.
So we're trying to make sure that
we're aware of those
contacts within there and
their own structures.
Oie A 101,
an introduction to a
Ltsdoie
A and the aging network,
which is part of what you just
saw. We're a complicated
system and
we want to make sure that we're
being um
supportive and
help our
stakeholders, our tribal
partners. Um
our and our own staff
understand our structure
and Oie A's role.
Um This would be particularly
helpful uh with
newly appointed or
elected tribal leadership and
administration in orienting
orientating them
um annually as we
know that um some
administrations turn over
annually
and then three
important to a
ALTSD
as to update our
own state tribal consultation,
collaboration, and
communication
policy.
So you'll
see an elaboration on
all of those within the State
Tribal Collaborations Act
report. And
I want to turn that back over to the
secretary.
>> Thank you, Melissa. I, on
this last slide, I just want
to mention goal four
is really important and it's
new and
it's,
it was
created directly from our
tribal consultations.
And we
appreciated
that the tribes in Pueblo
as a nation came forward
and asked that
there is a specific goal
on how to
help
address the
complexity of the federal
and state funding and
help develop a better way
to manage those
dollars so that the
dollars get to where they need to
go. And those are
two
our elders in tribes Puan
nations. So this
has gone off to the federal government.
This is required every four
years. Hopefully
we'll hear back from them. We know
it's an uncertainty
every day. We, we sent
this off to the administration of
Community living, which now
we've learned is going to be
dismantled and absorbed
into the larger HHS
structure. Our
um contact who
is our regional manager is no
longer in his position.
And so we're trying
to figure out
who is going to be
overseeing this work, but
it's into the
federal government and we will
be working on
these four goals no matter what,
it's, it's going to be baked
into our strategic
plan and
I'll end with
an invitation. You all
should have been invited to
our upcoming
conference on aging.
It's our 47th
annual. We're going to hold it
back at Glorietta.
That's where it used to be
a long time ago. We're
very excited. I just
learned. We have now
we're nearing 500
resi registrations
already. We hope to have
1500 to 2000.
It's really exciting. We
are, we raise
sponsorship money so
that elder seniors
that are in our senior centers don't have
to pay for lodging. It's a
free event for them.
We're gonna have transportation
to and from Santa Fe,
not everyone can stay at Glorietta.
So we're gonna be, we have room
blocks in Santa Fe. We
invite you all to attend.
We'd love it if you joined
where it's gonna be over three
days. And so, um
I'll follow up with all of you but
uh to see if you can make
it and um
really appreciate the
ongoing support
and for you all at the
champions, you all
are for our seniors.
So thank you madam
chair. Thank you members,
appreciate and be honored to
be here today. Thank
you.
Thank you, >> Senator
Souls. >> Thank you madam chair.
And just, I have a very quick
question
that we hear about all
of the funding cuts at the federal
level are the title
iii and title six
funding. Are
they at risk in jeopardy?
And what are the totals on
those?
>> Thank you madam
chair and, and Senator,
thankfully, we have
not received
any word for cuts
for the title
$3.
Um It's millions
of dollars as you can imagine, but I,
I would like to just high and
we can get that exact number. I
want to say 13
million flows
through a little bit
more. The title
IX money goes directly
to the tribes plus as a
nation. So I actually don't have
that specific number, but
we can get that for
you.
So we are whole at this
point. But
the state of New Mexico actually
puts in, I
think almost
$4
for every $1 of
federal money um
for our seniors
through the Senior Center
program. Um I
think that used to be
probably 6 to 1,
but a lot of states
don't have
uh the the level of
support from
their state legislators. So
thank you.
Um I just
want to share that. Um But
hopefully we're whole, we
are concerned a little
bit about our senior
employment program
dollars. We haven't received
our notice of grant
award that funds
26 seniors
um where we provide
a stipend for them to work
in different locations around the
state employment locations.
So that is a potential
concern for federal
dollars and we
might see a slight decrease
in our nutritional
support through U SDA
A. We don't know yet what
that looks like. Thank
you. Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you madam chair. You
know, because some of the concern we
often, you know, the
numbers are reversed that for every
dollar we put in, we
leverage a bunch of other federal
dollars. But still, if there's
25%
of the monies
that are being used are at
risk, that's a
concern
and I didn't need an exact
number but knowing that it's
on the order of 1213
million, not 100 million,
not, you know, 1
million makes a big difference.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator
Soul's Representative
Roybal Caballero.
Thank you madam chair
and thank you very much. For your presentation.
It's always good to hear from you.
I have just
a couple of questions. I know
that one of my concerns
in having
accessed
or try to at least get
assistance while we
were taking care of my
elderly
Alzheimer's mother-in-law
was the
lack of
Spanish language
assistance and
it was just the two of us
taking care of her and we needed
respite care and
we just could not find
respite care. And
so, you know, we,
we tried
that could speak
Spanish.
And so I'm wondering
if these,
how, whether these
services have been,
have you found a way to
do this? And
this is languages across
the board for all our languages
in the state of New Mexico because
I'm finding that more and more of
our families,
our goal
is to keep our family
members at home
and our goal is
to care for them as
long as possible.
So with that in
mind, we
don't turn to assisted
living or long term care.
We, we kind of help reduce
costs on that level on
that side
of the services.
But I'm really concerned about
whether we've improved
that. And
um have we, you know,
we have the language Access
Act that
was, I
always forget the year I think it was
2019 that
was passed requiring the
departments to
also
equip yourselves
with
the languages spoken
of this
services that you
provide in those
populations. So that's question
one and then real quickly.
I do have a quick other
question. Thank you, madam
chair. Thank you secretary.
>> Thank you madam chair
and representative um
really critical points
you're making. Um We
have, we do have contracts
for language lines to make
sure we're um meeting
that need. And
um I'll let Melissa speak a
little bit to um some of the
adult daycare programs
that are very successful
um in some of our pueblos,
uh I visited Santa
Clara actually a
month or two ago.
And it's wonderful to
see culturally appropriate
adult day care
services so
that those older
adults can actually stay in their home and
community. We did
receive a federal
grant and we're
applying for continuation for
respite.
And so we're working
with tribes and other communities,
make sure they're culturally
appropriate. But,
well, I know we're short
on time. So, but
I'm happy to talk to you about those
programs. >> We can do
that one
comment that I want
to just go to because this was
part of my second question
and I am interested in knowing
that. So we'll
talk.
So how
does your office actually
ensure
that we are
offering culturally
relevant
um programs
that incorporate traditional
knowledge because
we don't want
our elders to go
into outside care or any kind
of care
and not be
excuse me, not
receive their
from a point of traditional
knowledge. I think maybe
Melissa can answer that. But
um that's really concerning.
I've been to a lot of the, the
centers as well. We've been
invited to attend
ribbon cuttings and
different and services.
And I'm really impressed too.
But what is the assurance? How
do you check off that
list
that
>> madam chair, Representative
Roy Roy
Bal
cro
and
with the guidelines
that are in place for
the services that
the senior
centers or the adult day
centers,
they are,
they have the
capacity
to incorporate
cultural,
cultural understandings,
cultural connections,
traditional foods
within the services
that they provide. And
the adult days
that centers that
secretary was referring to
are in the Pueblo Isleta
Pueblo of Zuni
Pueblo of Santa Clara
and the Pueblo
of Santa
Ana. Yes.
So I also
am aware of at least
one home health agency,
which we, we are
looking into seeing
how we can work with
these health, home
health agencies
that have care,
speaking home health
aids. >> Thank
you. And I have visited
Pueblo Vlera and
it's really helpful also that
we, we could probably
engage our
elders to
help us
inform and educate
those that are giving our
the assistance because
that knowledge is valuable.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you very much for both of
you.
Thank you, Representative
>> Little.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you so much for the
presentation. It was really nice
to have a, an overview
um that was as detailed
as you provided.
Um You were
talking about um
the
uh provider,
some of the tribal provider
challenges
and uh
in the um
specifically on page
eight slide
16. And
I was just wondering
uh in the
madam chair in
the
challenges that you face,
you're talking describe the
um or note
the extremely high staff and
management turnover.
And I'm curious, I can
understand the construction
delays and the cost
and so on and
as well as all of these other
issues, the other four
listed below
the high staff and
management turnover.
And I'm wondering
uh madam chair
whether if there
is an issue
regarding compensation
for uh for
recruiting and
retaining
those who provide
uh servi these
services?
Um I'm curious,
maybe more specifically
is like, what's the average
range of
pay for
these
individuals
>> madam chair? Representative
Little. Thank you
for the question. In
regards to
the retaining
and recruiting related to
compensation salaries.
We don't have that
information
because the tribes are sovereign
nations.
If we
ask for the
information, it is
at their discretion. If they would like
to, they controlled
>> the employment
through the state.
Yes,
>> thank you. Um So
I'm curious as to when
and why this
is um might
be of importance is when
they are developing their
budgets. I
I having worked
as a travel administrator before
I understand that they
are control
the pay scales for their
staff. I'm just
wondering if they
might um this
might be a topic
that some of them may have
um
have, may have risen to
their priorities
in terms of
funding requests
that are coming
through.
Um And if you
don't have a response, that's, that's
all ok. I'm
just
>> madam chair and
representative Little. I do want to also
add that this is an issue that
we heard across
all senior
centers. And a
few years ago, we actually
did have some supplemental
dollars that
we shared
with the, you know, pass
through the AAA
if to raise some
of those
salaries.
I don't know if all those
dollars were drawn down
specifically for that,
but that is an
issue we heard
statewide.
>> Thank you. It's uh madam
chair. It's very good to know that you've have
had the opportunity
to address this as well.
So thank you for that
information. Um
Finally, the second question I
have the last one is
that um you
described um
the
uh
interagency or the
collaboration.
Um I'm
wondering which
department
have you had
success in
being part of the
collaboration? I see
all of the um
I do see
the,
in the report,
uh the
Collaboration Act report on
page 10 that you've
listed the
uh aging and long-term
services uh
um
divisions. Um
But I'm just curious as
to which departments
outside of aging
and long term um
have been part of
this collaborative
efforts,
>> madam Chair, Representative
Little. Do you mean State of New Mexico
Departments? >> Yes,
I do. Thank
you.
>> Um Oie
A has a
good relationship with the
tribal liaisons of
HC A Home Care
Authority, health Care Authority
and um Department
of Health. So when
we are
in need of resources or
information
as tribal liaison, I reach
out to my
fellow tribal liaisons
on specific
questions in
terms of um
starting to work with
them um
on collaborations.
I would say that that is going
to occur this year and
I'm happy that we're at that
step now
>> and, and madam chair and representative,
if I could just add uh department of
Veterans Services and
Indian Affairs Department.
Um And many of those
departments are actually helping
sponsor the conference on
Aging and Indian Affairs
Department is one of our key
sponsors. Thank
>> you. OK. Thank you very
much madam chair. That's the
end of my
questions.
>> Thank you,
Representative
Hernandez.
>> Thank you
madam chair
and uh
presenters II. I
want to get to this
to this
report.
Um
on
page
page 15,
the Chapter Senior
Centers
just, just a madam
chair clarification,
uh my uh senior
center. Um I, I see
that it's
just common among
tribal governments
and maybe that's where you're getting the, the
spelling.
But uh the
the traditional
like community like we, we
spell our community
ga aha with a
G and if you go to
our, our, our uh
website, a chapter
government website, you'll see the
correct spelling of that.
And it's just uh
yeah, they,
the, the, the C is
not the correct spelling.
The same thing with Hogback.
They would rather be called
Setta.
Uh uh That's what they
want to be referenced as
uh said the
Conor. So, and that, that
spelling is on their website
as well. So I just
want to point that out for
you. And
um the, the other
question uh well,
madam chair, I, I had attended
the Northern Agency
Council meeting
and um
uh Cove
Arizona with
the chapters from
Northern Agency
and um one
of uh
uh the chapter
officials, II, I
must have been
the past the deadline
for applying.
Uh They, they had
expressed, you know,
if there was any of
funding available
and I, I, I have
my notes from that meet
from that meeting and I
could follow up offline.
So, uh but they, they
just reached out to me.
Um And so
I just want to mention
that that the, you know,
they, they look at at, at
your services as,
as critical
needs for,
for the
day to day operations and
they really appreciate
the help that you guys
have. But I I know
that there was a deadline
and not everyone applied
for that. Thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you,
Representative
Abeyta.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Thank you, Secretary Kaltenbach.
Thank you, MS Sanchez.
I'm so happy to see you. This is one of
my favorite teams, one of my favorite
departments.
Um So I'm not
biased. I just know what I
like
and I just want to
say thank you for all the services
that you do. And um I
want to ask if you would be
willing to travel
to my district and visit
the senior centers in my district. I
have three Pueblo senior
centers. I have
two
day and nursing facilities,
one in Isleta, one in Laguna.
And then I have the
Navajo Nation uh
senior Citizen centers that
are all spread out through my district
through 10 chapters. I'd
love to go visit them with you. But
also if possible,
I would like to host a
meeting for the Navajo
senior citizens in that area
um as well as the
supervisors because
I do see a breakdown in communication
of what services they can apply
for what resources
are available
and even
funding requests, madam
chair, I had
a few senior citizen
programs visit me during the
session and they said, oh, we put in
a capital outlay request for X
amount of money. We hope you fund it.
But then when we seen the
list they weren't on there
and they had applied through a
separate portal and they didn't
know there were two.
So >> I like to get some of those
um clarified
for them. But ultimately, I'd
like to support you again in this
next upcoming session if there's
anything I can do, but I invite
you to come to my district and
visit my constituents
and help because so
many of my constituents
are elderly and they're
aging into that category.
And I want to make sure that these resources
are there for them and I will
see you in Glorietta. Thank >> you.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Representative
Dell.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank you secretary.
Thank you for your work.
Um I, I'm wanting to
know on
um non metro
Navajo, Indian. Can
you tell me a little bit
about the difference
between the
reimbursement rates? Are they
similar
>> madam chair and
representative? So I'm clear
between non metro
and Navajo
and Indian.
So
because it's, it's a
little back to that
complicated thing. So
Navajo goes through Arizona,
so we don't have those
for the, for the federal
dollars. Um
We can you
speak a little bit
to
the AAA
five and six.
So Navajo AA AAA A and
Indian
A AAA and the, and the general
fund they
get actually a set
amount.
So it's not based on
reimbursement per
individual. It's a set
dollar. >> Thank you madam
chair and thank you for that. Has that
created a sustainability
for them that we're not seeing
throughout the rest of the
state.
>> Madam, chair representative
Doh. Um
Just want to clarify your
question. Are you
asking
how
well the um
centers the tribes
are expanding.
>> Madam chair secretary? No, I'm
I just know that down in my area,
the senior sites are closing
or in jeopardy of closing
and the formulas are all different.
And I wanted to know if there's more
stability
in the on the
for through this formula or
if, if it was similar or different.
I'm just trying to understand for
>> the tribes. Yes, please.
Ok. I only know for
the tribes. Um
What the what is beneficial
for the tribes especially is that
the state of New New Mexico
automatically
allocates
to the tribal senior
centers.
Um
So they,
um I have heard
often I'll
speak on their behalf that are
very appreciative of that.
And in
addition to the
state general funds, they
also apply for title six
funding. So they have
that additional funding
source. Um
and most
more likely they
apply for other
grants and
often the tribes also
invest into their own senior
centers. >> Thank
you. Thank you madam chair and thank you for,
did you want to add something? >> Secretary? I
was just gonna say um
transportation, fuel
costs, meal's
impacting
the, the tribal senior
centers and the non tribal senior
centers. So there are
definitely strains
regardless of the funding
mechanism on
all of the senior centers around the
state. >> Thank you madam
chair and thank you for that. Are you
hearing of any pending
closures for
the tribal
sites,
>> madam chair representative?
No, we're not. Ok.
>> Thank you.
Thank you and
a couple of questions. So you said they
have the smart tvs.
Do our senior centers
have internet? I
understand that because of
the technology we try to
incorporate there,
do they all have
internet?
Mainly speaking to the
tribal
>> madam chair um
within the smart TV
program. Um we
installed internet
too,
transmit the data >> so
that Starling because
I don't think we have a hardwire
still sitting in some places that
have been put >> in the ground. If
I'm not mistaken, I'd have to ask
it. But I think it's
satellite
>> and then even on that
with the technical
assistance, are
we up to date with
our technology within the senior
centers? I mean, you can provide
them technical assistance but if
the take
the the equipment is just very
old, I mean that,
that,
that, that hinders
it >> madam chair.
Thank you. Yes, that
is a challenge
with some
um it varies per
tribe. Um In
one location, we may have
great access to
internet, um modern
equipment and in
others um
later models
and um in
internet infrastructure
is lacking. So
what we do is
do our best to learn
about those particular
challenges, work around
them. We do offer that
the tribal providers are able
to come into our office and
utilize our own equipment
and input from there.
>> So we don't have a funding source
for them to update that
equipment or get to uniformity
with all the senior
centers throughout the state of New
Mexico
>> madam chair, not through A
LTSD
and I will turn
over to secretary.
>> There we go. Uh Madam chair,
I I do want to share
that we're working off
really old it
systems
and we talked
about data collection.
They are not where they
need to be. We need to update
those systems
both for the
tribal senior centers
and across the state.
And so we are working on
identifying new
systems that will better
count and not
have not create
such a burden on staff
because of all this turnover that we
have better systems in place. So we are
doing that assessment right now.
Thank you >> because
my understanding is the staff is
overwhelmed with the amount of work
they have to do. As far as input
and just try and keep track
of the books representatives
on you have something >> just
really quickly madam chair, since you
talk about systems. So
I am doing with my other
committee, Science and Technology. We're
looking at all the agencies
and the technology
that could be
affected by the,
the hr one.
And one thing that
was asked is that make sure every
agency puts in
their
request for
maintenance for everything
because this year, I'm gonna go before
them and say this is what we
need because you know, we
need this and they give us
this part. So I
want to make sure it's a priority
that we have everything you guys need
and we'll vetted through science and
technology. We'll be asking you to come before
the committee and then
we present to LFC. So
they cannot just kind of sweep
us, you know, under the coverage or under the
rug. So thank
you. Thank you. Thank
you >> and
the senior
centers. Do we have anything
on how many of them?
Because we in our area,
we get requests for capital
for
Heaths. And I could
see when you were talking about, you know, being
out very remote.
Um I, I would say,
well, there probably should be a correlation
with the senior centers in
these helipads, but I
think one place they moved
their helipad plan like
three times. I don't
think they lost their funding.
Um Do we know if there's any
kind of speaking and in that sense,
as far as um
safety and the
safety, emergency services
in those areas,
>> madam chair, that's a very
good point. And no,
there isn't any current
conversation. However,
I would um I
think it is of
the utmost importance that
all our tribal administrations
prioritize the
senior center's needs
as it is now.
Um as we go
through the turnovers
and the management and,
um, and our own
team being on
the ground, understanding
what they are lacking
or what they are facing and what they're
succeeding in is
becoming more apparent. Um
We do need that support
especially so and again,
we appreciate everyone's support here
on behalf of the tribal
elders. >> And
I think with that correlation
to with the internet because,
well, I'm an iphone user
and facetime is very
um
when you can't get
regular cell
service that I
call my mama over the
internet and that connection's
a little bit more reliable,
but even with emergency
services, excuse
me, because of our next
presentation and even
concerning our senior centers
and even our young head
start areas
that internet connection
is a connection to the
outside. And I'd like to
see one of the things
I'm trying to explore is
the um
incorporating
facetime
into that
with our 911
correlation so that there
is some collection of
evidence in that sense and
even the more
reliability in that sense of
making sure. So I'd
like to see thoughts on that
as we move forward.
12 little
things, one was about food
pantries in the
facilities in some of
our senior centers
because there are some
nonprofits or some entities
come in and they do food
donations, but they don't have anywhere
to store it because they have their own
kitchen and you can't have
that mixing
of what you guys
provide and then
what is donated to them because
that's for the community members that
come in. So there needed to be a
storage space. And I don't know
if they needed more
refrigeration either
or freezers in that
sense because of the
some of the frozen food products
that do come in for
distribution of that
temporary storage
and then recreation
money because you have
programs listed. But
do those programs incorporate
because one of the other aspects
of seniors is the social
a bill of socialization
there. So just
keep those in mind because they asked
me how can
we get some money for a Christmas
party so
we can have their little giveaways.
So because they're
like, we already expended it for
this, you know, and that
so just keep those in mind.
But thank you very much for the work you
do. And any other questions
from any of the members? Thank you
and we will see you again. And in the meantime, you
need to come before the committee if we
need support from us for
any request.
Thank you so much
and to our members, we do
have a established
decorum. The chair will entertain a
motion back to
the letter that Navajo prep
has. Do we
have?
>> Thank thank you madam chair. I I
would like to make a
motion
for the
letter.
Yeah,
to, to adopt letters. Thank
you madam
chair. I
second that madam chair.
So >> you have a motion by
Representative Hernandez
and a second by representative
block members. You
had a chance to look over their letter.
Is there any um
any objections to the
letter as is as far
as putting our committee
support on and signing
on to this letter if there are
no
objections.
Thank you members. And
now we move on to our update on the
turquoise alert systems and
we will have Lieutenant
Philip Vargas and
Sergeant
Ricer.
I will also a
motion I
move adoption of
the last
committee's and I think
it's just 11
meeting and I'll second
that we have a motion
by Representative
block for
the minutes
for July 16th 17th
and 18th and
seconded by Representative
Roybal Caballero if
there are no
objections
and now we move on and you may
begin and I think you
have you presented with
the familiar with the
microphone system here.
Red's good. It's on
hot mic and,
and just try to just have one mic
on at a time. Thank
you.
>> Ok, madam chair, Senator
Representatives.
Oh, yeah. Thank you. Thank you for
having us here today and those in
attendance. Thank you for having us today.
So, just a quick
update on the,
um, turquoise alert.
Um, and before
I, um, just update,
um, just to go over basically
what the turquoise alert
entails just to refresh it.
Um, everyone
on the turquoise alert.
Basically, it means a notification
relating to a missing
person who
was enrolled, uh, an
enrolled member or a person eligible
for enrollment in a federally
or state Recco Indian
nation tribe Pueblo
and the person is
one missing due
to involuntary unexplained or
suspicious circumstances.
Two is at risk due to safety
or health concerns.
Three or suffers from a
mental or physical disability
or substance abuse disorder.
So those are the definition
criteria for the turquoise alert.
Um If they meet those
um criteria,
um then we do
one of two things we either
um, issue
an alert. Um Basically
that goes out to um
law enforcement, it goes
out to media outlets
and to the public through
um social media. Um
And that basically is if a
graphic or flyer that state
police pushes out um
statewide, um
I'll let Sergeant Peret talk about
the second alert that we
actually push out if it meets this
um, other additional
criteria.
>> Thank you, madam, chair and committee
members. So that's the,
the first edition, I guess if
you want to call it the, the version
one, what's simpler for me to
understand uh
is, is that
version and then there's a heightened criteria
version which is, uh
which activates the ipos
system. So
in the event that
uh there's a missing
uh native American,
um and
they're at risk of
great bodily harm or excuse me, if there's
evidence to suggest that they're
at risk of
great bodily harm and, or death,
and there's enough descriptive
information about that
missing person. And then
in that, at that point, we would
issue a wireless emergency
alert. Uh and
we would utilize the ipods
system that is provided
by FA
um so that would
send out a mobile alert
similar to the Amber alert
to everybody's phones
within a designated
area. So,
um you know, if we have reason to believe
that somebody is
in the mckinley County area
and the alert would target that area
if, if we have reason
to believe that they are
in different parts of the state or
uh if there's not enough information
to suggest where they might be.
Uh then in that, at that point, we would
probably look at targeting the
entire state. Um But
we do have the to
geo target certain areas
um just to
uh minimize the intrusion
on the public, but still maximize
the effectiveness of the alert.
Um So that's, that's
what the, the heighten criteria
uh version of the alert
does for
us.
>> And then so far, uh madam
chair and representatives, um
we have
issued three turquoise
alerts since its inception,
July 1st, um
two out of Gallup
PD and one out of Farmington
uh Police
department.
Yes, ma'am. >> Thank
you. I have Representative
Zamora.
>> Thank you.
Thank you madam chair and thank you
presenters and
uh thank you representative
a beta for bringing this bill
forward as
legislators.
You know, we we deal
with, with the
well being of the people a
lot in, in a lot of different
ways.
And
on the house floor, I debated
a little bit and then asked representative
a beta
about
why can't
we
incorporate this
with the silver
alert?
And so
I have the same question
for you officers
here today
is so
now we have in the State
of New Mexico, we have the silver
alert. We have the
Amber alert and we
have the turquoise alert.
Does that cause any
confusion, madam? T does
that cause any
confusion
for you guys as to
how you're
gonna put out an
alert?
Does it
create
any kind of problems
with deciding?
Is this a native? Is
this a Hispanic
guy or a white guy or,
or whether
it's a female or male
or whatever? How,
how do you guys handle all
that? And how do you go about
getting to the
proper procedure?
Maum term
>> madam chair, Representative
Zamora. Thank you for that. Um
Is it Zamor? Thank
you for that question. Um And so
basically, um there
are five different alerts
um that are
across the state of New Mexico.
There's the amber alert, missing,
endangered alert, silver
alert, Britney alert. And then now
the the newly formed turquoise
alert. So we have
five of those alerts.
Um They all have their
definitions um
um criteria. So
for instance, I just read
off the, the definition and criteria
for the turquoise alert. Um
and that's specific to that
alert. Every,
every alert has
their specific definition. So for
instance, silver alert would be
the individuals missing
individuals over 50
has some form of Alzheimer's
dementia or um um
degenerative brain
disease.
And so that distinguishes
that alert from a Britney
alert, which is developmental
disability and
health at risk,
which distinguishes it from
another alert and so
on and so on. So, uh
yes, they all have their
diff uh different definitions
which when we get the call
from law enforcement,
um you know, they basically
give us a quick synopsis as
to what it is, they're looking
at the individual missing.
Um And then we go
over the definition so
that we know what
type of alert we're looking at
um sending out.
And then once we
have that understanding,
we look at the, the
specific criteria for that
alert to see if they, the individual
actually meets that criteria, the
state um
criteria for us to send out an
alert because we are, we are
obligated to look at the
statutory requirement
of that definition
and of that criteria in
order to send out an
alert. So if it doesn't meet that
definition doesn't meet that
criteria, then
um an alert will
not go out from the State
Police
>> and madam chair and
presenters.
So I
am in support total
support of every alert
that we have.
But at some point in
time,
do we need to combine these
somehow and make
it, make it
not so complicated? And
so
uh
and create a liability
for you guys is,
is what my concerns
are. How,
how do you look at all
that whenever you, whenever you're doing
your job, madam?
Sure
>> madam chair representative. Thank you
again for that question. Um So
basically there's one alert,
it's called the missing endangered
alert that
encompasses
all of that.
Um So
to your question, yes,
um there is
one alert that that
would
um
that would encompass every
single silver alert,
turquoise alert, Brittany
alert, missing endangered
alert. Um and that's the missing
endangered alert. So there
is one, however, we
have um
five. So
we have to look at all
of those five
independently because
they all have their own
definition. But there is
one that,
that defines all all of
that
>> that are, they're
funded from different sources.
Is this, does that,
do you have? I >> don't
have knowledge of that. Sorry madam
chair
>> and madam
chair.
So
when you do a
turquoise
alert,
does it restrict
where you're looking for
somebody, the
area? Because in
today's world,
somebody could be
in Farmington or
Navajo country
anywhere
and be
across the state of New Mexico there
where I live in Clovis where
there's not any
kind of uh any native land
over there. So does it
restrict you or,
or does it actually
help to know that it's a native
or what?
How does that play
out mature
>> madam chair representative? Thank
you again. Um So,
um ba
let me just cover how,
how state police gets involved
from, from the alert perspective.
So initially, a
law enforcement agency, say
again, we had two in Gallup
and one in Farmington for the
turquoise alert specifically.
So Gallup
PD would reach out to
our dispatcher, get a hold
of the pio office
which issues the alerts,
um, contact uh New Mexico
State Police pio, we contact
that law enforcement agency and
then we get all the specifics.
Um If it's a silver alert
criteria, we look at
that. If it's a, if it's a
native individual,
then we'll, now we'll
look at the turquoise alert.
Um, and then,
um, once we
establish that the criteria is
met, we'll send
out the alert. Um, if the
criteria is not met
based on, on
again those definitions or
criteria, then an
alert would not go out,
um, from the state police,
but it doesn't inhibit
that agency from still
listing that individual in, um,
national, the
NC IC, the National Crime
Information Center, um, which
goes out to all law enforcement
in the country, right, as
the person's missing, but they
don't quite meet the endangerment
for an
alert.
Um So,
um what was the second
part of your question? Sorry,
representative.
Um
What we think
so,
so
the whether or
not?
Oh yeah, yes, they can be. Yeah, the
missing endangered
alert really
encompasses
everyone. So, and
it's one
alert
>> and, and I
still,
you know, you know, madam chair
and members of the committee
in, in New Mexico, we have so many
license plates and
after a while you get confused
about all that, but I'm
wondering if that's where we're
going in, in, in the, in
the sa if we're going in the same direction
with, with
having all the different alerts
and, and letting just
to me,
should we, should we
go back, take a
look at it and let
you guys have one alert and you
guys describe it
to the community as
to
what, what your alert is
about. May maybe
you guys need the authority
instead of us
creating all these
laws that,
that makes you go
into all these different places
for one purpose
is and,
and, and madam chair.
I, I don't
even want
an answer on that,
but it's, it's, it's my
concerns. Are
we making it too complicated? Are
we putting too many things on the table
for you guys to do your job?
Maybe you guys need more
authority and, and
less
people to tell you what to do
madam chair that concludes my
questions and, and >> comments
madam chair and representative. Thank you
again for, for the question. And
so I remembered what your second
part of your question was. So,
um, it was, it was, you know,
um, uh, basically,
if we're looking for somebody
in one area,
um how does that affect,
looking for somebody in another area
because you already lived in Clovis
and there aren't any
um, sovereign nations
near that area. So,
um, basically, we rely
heavily on
the investigators. So
again, for instance, if Gallup
Ped D reaches out to
us
because we're stat, we
have the statutory requirements,
we ask specific questions
as to, to
gather as much information as
possible so that we know what
type of alert it is.
Um And we
know based on the
investigation from hearing
from the primary officer or the
detective,
do they have reason to believe
based on their evidence that
the individual is outside
of, for instance, mckinley County,
right? Or if the individual
is statewide
somewhere that we need to notify
the entire state,
um, or
are, are, are we just
saying for instance, in
this case, if the person is in imminent
danger of great bodily harm or
death, is it something
that we that statewide? We
want to wake everybody up at two o'clock in
the morning for or is
it mckinley County
based on evidence?
And so we do have that
option, um, with
the mobile phone, we don't
have that option for,
um, putting a graphic
out. Um,
unless Gallup
PD specifies
and we're only looking for this person in mckinley
County. You don't need to
say statewide just,
hey, this person is still believed
to be in mckinley County area.
Public's assistance is appreciated.
Please contact Galla py
for whatever.
So, um,
so yeah, so we do have
that ability to,
sorry, we do have that ability
to um
on the mobile phone
to GEOS um
specify what
areas um
but typically in a
graphic or a flyer that state
police sends out statewide
to media, social media,
it gets blasts out
statewide to
everyone.
>> Thank you. Thank you for your
presentation.
>> Thank you, Representative
Representative
Dow,
Representative Rob
Caballero.
>> Thank you madam chair
and thank you very much for
your presentation. And
I want to start, I know
that this is not Representative
Zamora's intent, but to
your point, Representative
Samora, I think it's
incumbent,
I guess my feeling is the
more alerts there are
the better when lives
are endangered. That's my
first statement,
but it's incumbent upon
our systems, our bureaucratic
systems to
reduce
the red tape, the
complicity of what
we're doing in order to protect
lives
and to facilitate
these processes as
seamlessly as possible.
It's incumbent upon us.
We're the ones that are
responsible for saving those
lives. So
reducing it, you're right.
We have, if
they look at it, they assess it,
they evaluate it and they
determine we have
all these alerts.
Well, so be it right,
because it's saving
potentially endangered
lives. How then
do we look at
them in order to be
able to make them work
better for us faster
for us? Um,
reduce the
complexity of it,
all of those things? Right.
And I'm assuming that you
would be doing that on
a regular basis anyway,
because madam chair,
that's what you all do as an
enforcement agency anyway,
not just with our state,
but on a national level, I'm
aware of that because we've
had some really good
presentations from
your leadership and
others throughout the years
about what you do
on a regular basis.
So, I, I wanted
to say that because it is
incumbent upon
those systems,
we all want
to protect lives. We all
want to do that.
So,
um, I
have just my,
um, your public
information office
uh through
DPS.
I'm curious as to
who's doing the public
awareness part of all of
this? Who's,
how are we reaching
out to the general populations
in general
across the state?
Billboards, radio
announcements,
ads of any kind,
all of that? What
kind of public awareness
efforts are we
do we have in
place in
order
to,
you know, alert,
alert our communities
that these alerts are in place
and what numbers to call?
That's my one question and then I
have one quick one after that.
Thank you.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank you
representative. So,
um since the
alert uh was
adopted, uh and
when went into law, uh
we've
mobilized, uh I
would say a pretty uh
good campaign
to
educate the public on this new
alert. Um
I personally have done
uh
at least two interviews
uh with multiple
uh local
news outlets.
Um We also created
a educational
or instructional video if you
will for law enforcement
agencies across the state.
Uh And that has been uh
pushed out, I believe we discussed
this at the, at the last,
at the task force meeting, uh madam
chair. Um So that
was done and that has been
sent off to uh
every law enforcement in the state
uh via the LE
A or the law enforcement academy.
Um
So, uh in, in addition
to that, we have several
uh upcoming meetings, I, I
believe we're meeting with uh uh
we're, we're attending a
Tribal Leaders
Summit on the 20th.
Uh that is gonna be hosted in
Albuquerque. Uh There's
another event uh if I'm
not mistaken, uh that
the DOJ is gonna be hosting
on early, early
September, I believe September 6th.
So we're gonna be attending that to
educated more people
on the alert. Um But
outside of that, we're making ourselves
available. Um
What we don't want is we don't want
people to receive the alert or see
the alert and ask what is a
turquoise alert, right? Because
if, if that's what people
are, are gonna
say, then um
you know, it's, it's gonna confuse them
and we don't wanna, we don't wanna add
confusion. So to your
point with more alerts, you know,
we want to save lives at
the same time, we don't want to confuse people
with an abundance of
alerts, right?
Um So because then
we have to educate everybody on what this
alert means and what that alert means.
Um And then to what
representative of moral's point
was about,
uh if there's any
confusion, um it could
get to the point where
uh the circumstances of
one missing person could
qualify for multiple
alerts, right? So at that
point, the question
becomes, what alert
do we send? And
at that point, we
start um
going over
um
thinking about
what alert we want to send as opposed to just
sending out an alert and then we'll
find the community, right? So we
don't want to delay. Um
you know, it's, it's, it's a matter
that needs to be pushed out
immediately to notify the public
um to not to mobilize
the public. So
>> thank you madam chair and thank
you so to that point and also
again to
kind of help with
the points
that Representative Samora made,
which were very
on point in the sense
that
there's got to be a way to
constantly be finding
the best way
to reduce
the
confusion, possible
confusion. Look at
what is working with us, not
how to consolidate what
makes consolidation
worth it. What makes
separation
important?
Because
what we're facing in our state of
New Mexico is we have
one of the highest numbers
of missing and murdered
indigenous
populations in the
nation. And so
because of that, it makes
the Turkish Aler
alert
probably highlight
it as a
critically
important
alert
when we can get it
into that
response
call and then
response. So
I would, I would say that I
would ask that you continue
to look at that because
what we don't want is
to cause
confusion because
confusion can
put people at risk
more so than what they
are already initially
at risk. So timing
from what I understand madam
chair from your reports, timing
is critically important for
these efforts.
So I would
just, the
other thing I want to say about your public
information is
if there's a way
to
um
partner, I know like
the law enfor local law
enforcement entities
go to our community neighborhood
meetings.
Um provide
the information maybe
having while you're sitting in a
waiting room, um
having these tags
running,
informing the public
succinctly about
this is a turquoise alert.
This is what call briefly,
choosing some language,
having them run as information
pieces in
clinics, in social
services,
department of Health
and human, whatever, as
many outreach possibilities
as possible. But
cutting something that can
be used in that manner
and then again, the
languages,
I don't know how you overcome
getting public
information
um out
using all the many
languages that we have in the State
of New Mexico. So again,
you have quite a bit
challenge.
So with that in
mind, given
that we are
facing
cuts at the
federal level, I
don't know if you can answer this, but
perhaps you can get the
answer if you aren't
able, what
type of funding or
legislative support is
needed to
strengthen the
system's reliability
and
the reach and
reliability.
What I don't, I know
you've just begun this.
But if you could be thinking
about that
because we are going to be
facing a lot of cuts and we
will have to be stepping
up. So,
in that
mindset,
what can we be
doing to continue
to enhance
these efforts,
particularly in the
Turkish turquoise
alert?
I don't know if you can, if you can't
answer it, can you?
Um
>> So just continuing to
work with our law enforcement partners.
So for instance, if
again, if mckinley
uh or Gallup PD,
right, is the one that reached out to
us again, you know, I want to make
it clear that
madam chair and representatives,
excuse me. So I want
to make it clear that when
these agencies reach out to state
police for an
alert, state police does not
take over the investigation. It's
that agency that reached out
to us, it's still their
investigation. So it's Gallup P
D's responsibility
to get a search and rescue.
It's Gallup P D's responsibility
to call state police for more
resources. It's Gallup
P D's responsibility
to also put the word
out, right. It's not, it's
not, doesn't fall on state police to
conduct the investigation, it
falls on state police to
push out the alert
and unless gallop PD reaches
out to state police for
more resources, more
personnel, more whatever
it is that they need, that's
where state police involvement
ends.
So it's up to that
individual agency,
that law enforcement
agency
to continue to conduct
the investigation
in whatever that means,
right, following up on
leads, um
you know, cross
jurisdictional things
from an investigatory
standpoint, from a state police
issue. There is no jurisdiction
issues because we're the state police.
So if you contact state police,
we can cro excuse me,
cross into any jurisdiction.
Um And if
we get um
governor's permission
to go on sovereign land and we can
do that. So from the state police
perspective,
there really isn't, it's,
it's, it's a question of that
investigating agency
making sure that they're doing
continuing to conduct that
investigation in as
a thorough way as possible
to bring that person back
home unless they
contact us for assistance
in which again, if we
have the personnel, the resources,
etcetera, um
State police is always available to
assist. So
>> thank you madam chair. So then
that's where we come in. That can
that need, we need to be
helpful in that
local district,
by district, community, by
community in making
sure that the local entities
understand that when they need
or lack resources,
they need to reach out to
us, but they also need to
convey that to you
so that we don't
impede the investigative
processes at all
or the search,
whatever needs to be done.
We don't want to impede it
because we don't, we
lack the resources.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you so much for your answers. Thank
you. >> Thank
you.
Thank you, Representative
Abeyta.
>> Good afternoon. Thank you, madam
chair. Good afternoon, Lieutenant Vargas
and Sergeant
Reita. Is that correct?
Thank you. Welcome.
Um Just to
disclosure, I did talk with
the Cabinet Secretary
of DPS Jason Bowie
a few weeks ago when we started
to get calls and get
inquiries about this. I just want to
provide that context
and, and then just also
on a lighter note, this is my
second favorite department
award team colors
today.
So did Charlotte, all
of us did except
chairwoman.
Uh Yes.
So what I wanted to
talk about was
uh and I have the legislation
pulled up here. Um
One of the concerns I have
and just these,
some of these terms are loaded. So
let's just go back a little
bit. The
people who are in the state, they're
state citizens, but
some of us have
dual citizenship.
We have tribal citizenship
and that gives
us a separate
political status. So
this is not based on
because you're Indian because
just your race, it's
because of a political
status. So I just
want to make that clear too.
But with that comes
lots of jurisdictional
issues. And what
I'm asking today is,
are we doing a good
job of working
with non or excuse
me, with tribal law enforcement
agencies with
this bill?
Maybe that's, you know, good
could be very up to
interpretation. But what are
we doing to work with tribal
law enforcement agencies? Let's
start there. >> Thank you, madam,
chair and representative. Thank you for
that question.
So
it's kind of a loaded question
because so
again, we pushed out
three turquoise
alerts
um in my
almost two years
of, of,
in this being in this position,
um I
can probably count on one
hand how many times
I've actually gotten a
call or my, my shop
or my division has gotten a call
from tribal law
enforcement.
So
it's extremely rare that we hear
from tribal law enforcement
from sovereign
nations.
>> And that, that's one of the
things members
is the
because I go to all these
meetings and learned over the
years that
that origination of
the report,
if it doesn't leave that office
and each, each
agency has their own
criteria that they
have to meet. It's not uniform
and that's what we're hoping
to get there.
So if the tribe
or nation are Pueblo's
informed and they go
through it, if they
don't meet all that
criteria that they have,
it won't go any further.
And it's not because of
the sovereign nations, it's
not incumbent upon
them to when
they get contacted
to like you said take
over the investigation, it has
to go back to the originating
source and that is,
I know that's an issue with
Navajo Nation because of the
capacity. >> Thank you. Thank
you chair. And that's
exactly what I'm getting to
because when I
read the legislation
again, I have it right in front of
me. There's no rule
about where the person
went missing or
what law
enforcement entity started
the investigation. It's
if you are
a missing
person and you
are an enrolled member or eligible
for enrollment in a federally
recognized Indian Nation
tribe or Pueblo, you're
eligible for this and
what I've been hearing
and just like
Sergeant
Pereda, I thought I was doing good
education to my
community through social
media through my constituent
letter through talking with
people and families. And
then I come to find out where I'm
not. There's so many people
in my district who still don't know
what a turquoise alert is or
where they can go.
And just a few
weeks ago, we had a 16 year
old who went missing
in the middle of the night on a
Thursday, her
in a tribal community in
Toha, her grandmother
called the Navajo Nation
Police. They
said we can't come until
Monday because we're
having Easter Navajo
Fair and we're low on law
enforcement. So five
days went by, I said,
call the state police,
call the county sheriff,
call someone else. She said the
Navajo police said I can't
call them. I never verified
that statement but
I asked her, are you willing
to go to Albuquerque? Maybe I can
meet you there. We can talk with state
police because my understanding
of this bill was that
anyone could use it. There
were no jurisdictional
issues. So that
led to my conversation
with Cabinet
Secretary Bowie
and or Bowie, excuse me.
And he had
the same idea that
Navajo Nation did where
he said it's
going to start wherever the
person went, that's the jurisdiction
and we won't get it unless they
ask us to take
it. And I said
that's surprising because
that's not how it's written
and that's not how I
advocated for it.
And had I known
that these would be the
barriers
I would have put specific
language in there that
said it
doesn't matter what jurisdiction
it starts in the state can
intervene and help with an alert
at any time because
that was the purpose
how it got delayed
in Navajo Nation. Law
enforcement is the very
reason why we should have
turquoise. So you don't lose
time and you start
the investigation immediately.
Five days went by
thankfully, she
was found, I
think maybe five
more days later, the
police finally showed up to
Maryanne's house on Monday.
They did a report. She was found
a few days later in Cameron,
Arizona, but
the family was doing
their own social media posts.
Navajo Nation finally did a
missing person's report
finally. But we never
got the turquoise alert.
We never got a, an
Amber alert and it might be because she
didn't hit that criteria, which you
mentioned, but that goes
back to the education.
So my concern
here is if
that's
the,
the, the
position that dps is
taking that if it starts
in the tribal jurisdiction,
we're not going to touch it until they
ask us. I think we have a
problem because
that's exactly the
roadblock that's happening.
That why we pass this. So
if you want to expand on it, go
ahead.
>> So they can't make the
tribe or nation call
and that's where, that's what,
what we and we can't
make, we can't put it in statute
where we make them call
because of their sovereignty.
It's
>> chairwoman, respectfully,
I understand that. But the
family should still have the
ability to go to state
police to file a report
because they are still a state
citizen. It should
not be on
where did they go missing or
where did the call originate from?
Maranne should have been able to
go to the state police or
the Navajo Nation should have been
told, should have told her.
Yes, you can go call
the state police, but
that's my concern. Is, see
exactly the way it's
bottling up back home.
It's doing that again. And I
thought we addressed that
>> she, she can go.
But who, who did she go
to? The initial? That's
where we're, we're trying to work
on that because whoever they're going,
talking to at the police
department is not
advising them. So that
website, what we have
online, that's one of the things we're
trying to do is a checklist.
You know, if this doesn't
happen, go here and put
a shot clock on it and say if you don't
get a response, then
you go over here, but a lot of
them don't know they can report
to the state police
too.
Madam. Can I ask a
question?
Can
>> madam chair representative? Thank you for the
question. So, um
I think there's a little bit of
confusion with that. So
basically
any law enforcement
agency can
take that report.
The problem is the
investigatory piece.
So if,
if they report it
um to state police,
we need permission to go on
sovereign land to conduct
a through investigation. That
investigation may take
a very long time
to find this individual. So it it
goes into witnesses,
finding witnesses, any evidence
left behind things that we have to
follow up on. So the
constant hey, can we come
over today
to wit, to interview a
witness and they're not
home or whatever it is, right?
So you run into the
investigatory piece,
not necessarily the
the um reporting
piece, the reporting
piece,
100% any law
enforcement agency can take that missing
person report. However,
that doesn't mean they're gonna be able to
conduct the investigation because it's
on sovereign land.
>> Thank you, madam chair. Thank you,
Lieutenant Vargas. So
does that mean that this
may and maybe I'm thinking
about it too simply does
it need to be separated?
That
DPS can still be
an alerting agency?
But the investigatory
component can still stay with
whoever has jurisdiction
for it.
>> Yeah, go ahead. I was
gonna mention. So it's already
uh structured that way. Uh
Representative.
Um Thank you for the
question, madam chair
representative. So it's already structured that
way. So DPS
is the alerting authority
uh and the
investigation
remains with the originating
agency. Um
but to Lieutenant Vargas's
point, right, is
I, I personally have experienced
this not in a missing person's
investigation, but in a
separate investigation where
we need access to,
to uh
to sovereign land in order to,
to do anything uh to,
to
um
interview witnesses much
less enforce any laws.
Uh Excuse me even
more so with, with enforcing
any laws. Um
So that's where you,
we require the
um
uh the collaboration
from tribal leaders,
right? Um to
possibly uh
adopt a turquoise
alert on, on sovereign land,
right? Giving us granting
us authority to go in and
investigate these
specific cases if that's what they
choose to do. Um
But ultimately, we can't
just go
to um
Logan Aama for
example and
initiate a missing person's
investigation. We have
to get permission from the governor to do
so before that
happens.
>> Thank you, madam chair. Thank
you um Sergeant
Brisa.
So
if this is not working
in the intended way, which
is to get alerts out
and you still have the jurisdictional
issues, what is your
recommendation
to strengthen it for
new Mexican citizens
who have Native American
political
status,
>> madam, chair representative.
So
bottom line is that
the, the sovereign
nations have to
conduct their investigations. They
have to contact us when the individual
goes missing. Um,
because we, as we've all
said, right, the, the time
is of the essence, so five
days is in my opinion,
completely unacceptable.
So if I'm looking for
an individual, and again, I've, I've
done investigations for 10 years
prior to my current position
and I've looked for people
who didn't want to be found, let
alone people who were in
need of being found.
So, um, I
think
really we've had
this discussion before the task force.
Meeting it all boils down
to
those,
um, law enforcement
agencies that need specific
training and how to conduct
a missing person's investigation.
If that's not done,
I don't know what we're
doing. Like
we're, I'm sending out an alert,
but if the agency doesn't
know how to conduct an investigation, then I
don't. That's it. I'm done.
My, my piece is
done. So,
and if, and if, and if
you know, those agencies
need assistance, all they have
to do is call state police
and we will assist in
training and how to
conduct missing persons
investigations. Like
what steps they need to
take, why it's
important to contact us
immediately.
Um, and that's,
that's really it. I think it's just lack
of training. I think it's, I
don't know if the turnover rate
on, on sovereign
land with law enforcement is
high low. I have
no idea. I don't know if they
contact the FBI, I don't know if they
contact the BI A because
the same thing, right? So if that
individual
on sovereign land is missing
and is endangered,
then the
FBI should be notified. Bi
A should be notified and if those
individuals aren't notified, why
not? Is
that dropping the ball from
that law enforcement
agency on sovereign
land? Um, can
the family reach out to the FBI
since they handle
sovereign crimes,
um, from a federal
standpoint? Um, but
I can tell you that
since I've been here, I haven't heard
word one from bi A on a
missing individual on sovereign
land. I haven't heard word one from the
FBI from an individual on sovereign
land. And like I said,
I can probably count on one hand,
probably less,
less than that on how many
times I've received a phone call
from a sovereign law enforcement
agency about a
missing Native
American. >> Thank
you, madam chair
and Lieutenant Vargas.
Respectfully. I disagree
because I'm reading the language
again and it gives
you the authority to
either wait for the lead
investigation, law enforcement
agency to make an independent
determination or
for the Department of Public Safety
to make the determination. To
me. That means you could
do this, you could
do this. It doesn't,
that's what I'm reading
and, and that's
my concern. Now
is are
we missing, where am
I missing? >> So madam chair
representative, so that has
to do with the alert,
putting out the alert
so we can put out the alert.
Any alert that a law
enforcement agency contacts. We're
not conducting the
investigation, we're
putting out the graphic,
the flyer,
that's all we're
doing.
>> But you're saying madam
chair, you're not going to
do it unless you
have the information or the
background. No.
So you would still do it.
>> Yes. So
any law enforcement agency can
contact us for
an alert. Um
If it, if it, for
instance, it's say it's, it's
Navajo PD.
Um who doesn't want to
take the call of the
missing female
and Gallup PD does,
right? So say Galip Pedi takes
it even though the individual
went missing on sovereign land.
Galip Py takes it and says,
hey, I'm calling State Police.
This is what we have the family
came in today um
to fi file a missing person's
report. Ok. What do you have?
Give us the information if
it meets the criteria, we push the alert
out. I don't care,
I don't care where it's from. I don't
care what jurisdiction. I don't
care if it's sovereign land. I
state police does not care
if that person is missing
and it meets the criteria. State
police will push out the alert.
We don't, yeah,
the phone calls aren't happening.
Like, like there's
nothing and we, there's nothing in
the state statute. Well, there's
nothing like, like madam chair uh
stated,
we can't make anybody
call us.
So if we won't
know somebody's missing unless they call
us. >> Thank you, madam
chair. Thank you. I understand
that. But just a moment ago, you had
said that your education
was good and that there were
trainings and works
with law enforcement agencies. But
now it sounds like there's a breakdown.
So I'm trying to, that's
what it sounds like to me because why
are they not
calling?
I have no idea.
>> Nations >> try
>> to,
nobody applied
to have them come out and they
were even going to go out
there to there instead
of them having to come in.
And eventually they
just started to have the trainings in
Albuquerque and I
don't know what the turnout was,
but they didn't really
like doing that because it was taking
their law enforcement for the whole day
to come out and do the training. But we
offered it to, for us
to go out there. And this
was
when I put that 2 million
into the, into there
and and I don't even know if any
of it got spent because
it was there. >> Thank you madam chair.
Are those recent
trainings?
>> Were they were available
back in
2020
I think is when we put it there and
that money was sitting there and it was
available for them
to come
out and even
put these IGA ands
used for the tribes nations and
PBS. But they just did
not
initiate within their
departments to,
to, to create something
and that's where we're like, well, do they
need an
office or FTE
in there specifically for
this?
Nothing got back on
that. Thank you
guys are the only ones of
the law enforcement that
came before the M
I task force. We have not had
any of the other tribes
nations or Pueblos, although there are
members from certain
law enforcement agencies
with our tribes nations and pueblos
that are members, but I don't
know if they attending all those
>> meetings. Thank you madam chair. I think
2020 is a very
long time ago and
this was just passed this
year. I think
another training
is needed. Another
call for training, another
call for collaboration.
2020 is unacceptable.
Thank you madam chair. Um
As far as
my questions,
um Just let me know
how I can be a resource and how I can
help if there need to be any,
any amendments or
advocacy for additional
funding for this. Um
But I want to make
sure that it does work
for New Mexicans as
my vision
was as was
Senator Charlie,
um, and Senator
Charlie and I live along Interstate
40 which has
a lot of high crime.
Lots of,
it's a, it's a dangerous
highway and
I'd like to just be a
resource to you all and
help. Thank
you,
>> madam chair representative. Thank you
again.
Um
So yeah, which is
because of the, the,
the implementation of the turquoise
alert, which is
again, one of the reasons why we're
doing so much training
now. Um because we
realized that that was
ii I basically, I realize
that the task force meeting that that was
falling short. So
that, which is why we're agreeing to
meet tribal chiefs
on September 6,
why we're going to the tribal
law enforcement on the 20th,
which is why I'm meeting with
Senator Charlie on the 22nd.
So which is why we put out
numerous news releases. Which
so, I mean, there's, you know,
again, it's
unfortunate but
uh yeah, from a, from,
from my standpoint,
if people would call, we
can get the alerts
out
law enforcement. If law enforcement would
call. Yeah, if law enforcement
would call, you know, and it
meets the criteria then
we can get the, the alert
out. Um One of the
other things, um you
know, again is that I, I
don't, again, it's,
it's difficult
to,
to
say where the
breakdown is
if we're
not
involved in some
way to assist
those law enforcement agencies
that don't understand themselves where the
breakdown is.
So if state police
were, especially the P I
Os, right? Because we're the ones who issued
the alerts. If we
had a better understanding
of where
those
shortcomings are coming
from, then
we can fix that or
at least educate those law
enforcement agencies on, hey, this
is how you fix it. But
until that time happens and
they reach out to us and
saying, hey, we were having
issues. Um
you know, we had
four missing Children. They none,
none of my officers
called you guys. I
think there's an issue here with lack of
training. Well, then call
us, we'll go give that
training like there's
no way we're not gonna do that
as an agency. We
and II I
ask everybody here if you
need our
assistance with anything, reach
out to me. I'm gonna, I have
my card with me. It has my email
on it, has my phone number on it,
call, email me. So I have
your email. So I have your contact
information and
say, hey, I think
I spoke with
tribal chiefs in my area
and we want a
training, call me,
email me and I will get there
whether it's myself the sergeant
or one of our other P I OS will
conduct that
training
>> Representative Hernandez and
then I got Representative down
Representative Block.
>> Thank you madam chair. There's, there's
just a lot of things I'm hearing for the
first time, you know.
And, uh, I, I
think, uh, uh, you
know, I'm gonna do a better job attending
the, uh, tribal task
force meeting because
there, there's a lot of answers we need
for, um, communities
back home who,
you know, like,
I, I think the information about,
if, if, if, if we
can't get
our local
officers to move
on to, to, to
move, to, to activate,
to communicate to you,
then we could go ahead and
talk to another law
enforcement
agency. Because right
now the thinking
is that, that, that we
have to wait for our local law
enforcement officers
to, to make those,
those first moves.
And I didn't know that we
could reach out to like
city of Farmington, San Juan
County sheriff, you know,
to have them, uh
you know, activate
it or to communicate it
to you. And so
it madam church stuff like
that, that we got to make
sure that that information
is out into the
community that the
public that, that
the, um
the, the public that's,
that's showing up to
these uh searchs
searches, you know
that uh that
do go on in, in,
in, in our
communities.
Um
madam chair, Lieutenant
Vargas, would you, would you
characterize the
Torque Lyrics as a
former mutual
aid madam
chair,
>> madam, chair representative.
Can you clarify
that?
>> And I'm just looking
at this as, as how we
can help another
agency, how we can help,
uh you know, um
provide
assistance. And,
and I'm the
other part of my question I was going to get
into was,
uh, is there any opportunities
to provide wraparound
services to
activate, like
maybe behavioral
health uh uh
personnel
or is there, you know, is
there any way, because,
because often
madam chair >> just
be mindful of who you're talking to.
These guys are law enforcement.
That's,
and that's one of the things too, even
with search and rescue and some of these
resources that we
would need to access
to tackle the issue.
They're not funded, search and rescue
doesn't receive any money. It's
all volunteer.
So activating that
we're going to, it's available,
we're going to call them up right away.
It's a volunteer basis
are available and sometimes
that to them does
not happen. So they don't know
whether they need to come in until
after the fact.
So
that they law enforcement,
you're talking about behavioral health,
but there should be money
going that way. But
>> thank you, madam, I'm
just, I'm just bringing that up
because
once someone does get
found.
Uh I, I just
don't know like what,
what the procedures are with, with
law enforcement, do they
just
uh is, is, is
that all or do we, do
we connect them with other
services? Like for
uh you know, the families.
Thank you madam chair.
>> So madam chair representative, thank you for the
question. So basically if,
if the individual
is in danger and we push out an
alert um
and they're in
danger because of some kind of false
imprisonment, kidnapping, what have
you, then
100% from the state police
side, we'll connect them with
victims advocates and
resources for them. Now
again, I can't speak for
other law enforcement agencies.
Obviously, I can't speak for a sovereign
nation at all. So
I have no idea what
resources or
what victims advocates they have
for them. I, I wouldn't
have that answer. So >> that's
where the CBRC and that's
where I put some of my money
to, into the
CVRC for recurring funding for
the victims and all of that supposed to
be accessible.
>> My last question,
I guess would be for the
investigation purpose
um
with, for, for law
enforcement,
um madam
chair, uh
does, does
surveillance
recordings, is that
helpful and,
and
um
going back
to, to,
to get more information
on,
on
uh
finding more
clues, I, I'm trying to find
name, you know,
like, and I'm talking about like the
ring door camera, I'm
talking about uh
surveillance cameras
at businesses. Is this
something that,
uh you know,
if we were to
have more of those out
there? Is this something that law
enforcement, uh what would
help law enforcement
like?
>> So madam Chair representative, thank
you again. So, yes,
um, surveillance
footage uh in any
investigation is extremely important.
Um Again, it's
only as, as
good as the
investigators
looking for that information.
So if the investigators are
not good at
conducting a thorough investigation,
then they will
not
uh get the
surveillance footage, they will
not download it
properly, they will not collect
it as evidence properly.
It all depends on
who's, who's running the
investigation. Um
But yes, uh surveillance
footage uh in, in
a missing person investigation
is hugely beneficial
um in,
in, in a number of way to find
the victim to find if that
person was abducted
or just left on their
own.
Yes, >> thank
you madam chair >> and, and if, if
I may just add one thing to that
uh madam chair
representative um
additionally, uh not
just surveillance cameras, but another form of
technology license plate readers.
Um They are huge
uh capital, huge,
huge uh for us
in assisting us in
in locating missing
persons, wanted,
wanted persons.
Um And I
personally can attest to how
beneficial it has been.
Um You know, we've acquired
several in the last legi legislative
session. Um
but they play a
monumental role now in
law enforcement um
in helping us locate
people in general.
So that's another piece
of, of technology that we're
utilizing actively.
>> And that's, that's a tool,
but we must be mindful because
there is legislation that's been
proposed to disclose
their locations.
And I was like, you're
working against what we're
trying to do here as far as
protect the communities.
So we must be mindful
of what I know
I talk about transparency,
but there's, there's a fine line there
of what it hinders of
Representative down.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you, sergeant. I'm just gonna
ask some questions in the scenario
of this 16 year
old,
if there was,
um, everything worked out
great, would you be issuing
an Amber alert and a
turquoise
alert?
>> So it would
depend on the, the
situation. So if the
individual um,
met the criteria
for great bodily harm or
death, um,
then they
would get uh, the amber
alert because they're under
17 years of age.
Um, if
it did not
meet that criteria
and it was
a like a
flyer graphic,
then that's, that's
the, the means we would,
we would um send
that out
>> madam chair and
Lieutenant, what would the,
what's the difference on the criteria
for the turquoise
alert?
>> So, if, um
for instance,
so there is no age on the
turquoise alert, right? The amber alert is 17
and under. Um for the turquoise
alert, there is no um,
minimum or, or, or
required age.
Um So
great bodily harm for
both is,
is, is, has to be there
um for an Amber alert and a turquoise
alert for the phone, mobile phone
usage, right? So we're just
talking about using the mobile phone.
So, um,
so great bodily harm or
death is there for
both.
Um,
a
whether we use
Amber alert, whether you, whether
or or not we use turquoise
alert. I would me
personally, I would probably that has
not happened. Of course. So
I would say probably an Amber alert
because the people understand
statewide, understand what an amber
alert is and
statewide. Not everybody
still understands what a turquoise
alert is.
Um,
not even close.
So,
um,
>> thank you madam
chair. Thank you, Lieutenant. And
would your answer be the same if
it was a missing senior
citizen, would you pick
a silver alert, turquoise alert or
would both be issued if
they met the criteria?
>> So at this time, it would be a silver
alert because of, again,
not having individuals
call like law enforcement,
not really knowing what a turquoise
alert is, whether it is
on state land or,
or sovereign land.
So I would issue a silver
alert
if that individual was in great bodily
harm or death.
Yeah.
>> Ok. Thank you madam chair.
And thank you for that
Lieutenant
Sergeant.
You mentioned that there
could be an agreement
if there was an
Interagency agreement or
Intergovernmental Agreement.
And that
tribal law enforcement
had said in the case in the
case of Turko,
whatever, if a call
comes in, we are granting you
permission. Is that's not,
that's just an alert. They're not saying
come on to our sovereign
property. Are, are you
suggesting that one solution
would be Intergovernmental
agreements for these
alerts that would allow a family
to call you
without?
I don't understand how you're supposed to
determine
that they're at risk
to rise to the level without somebody
filling out some form of
paperwork. I can't just call
and say my child's missing or
someone's missing because they want evidence.
When we, they last seen 24
hours, 40. You're saying
criteria that
would have to have local law
enforcement action. Is that
correct?
>> That is correct, madam
chair representative. Um,
I don't want to speak too much
on any governmental agreements
that's way above my
pay grade. Uh,
but yes, at least
some, uh,
uh, there needs to be a
connection, um,
because we can't just go on to, on
to sovereign land and
like I said earlier, initiate some kind of
investigation. We need to
be granted permission to go on to
that sovereign land.
Um, and whether that
means we have to get, uh,
like Lieutenant stated
earlier, uh, permission
every day, like I used to do
with when I worked investigations
and I needed to go on the sovereign land,
but to get permission every single day.
Um, and then we were escorted
throughout, uh,
throughout the sovereign land.
Um, or whether there's
an existing agreement that says
we can go on and uh
investigate right again
if that was a state statute that
was um
uh
adopted and in
collaboration with
sovereign land. And, and that,
at that point, you know, if we
had legal authority to enter
sovereign land and then we
would, we >> will
have a presentation
on commission and
about that, that or the existing
statute for
mous to be created
And also the,
what was the other? So if there's a
natural disaster
too, the
governor of the State
of New Mexico can't declare it
for the Navajo nation.
The Navajo nation president has
to declare it first and then it
goes to the governor. So
even though you have these emergencies,
there's still
>> stuff. Thank
you. And then madam chair,
I think I know the answer to this, but just my final
question. So I'm
Cherokee, my Children
are enrolled, Cherokee. If
my daughter were missing
and my
sheriff or city police
said this
girl is missing.
Would there be a turquoise alert or
an Amber alert? I'm in
Sierra
County.
But but I'm just
wondering
it just it.
Ok,
>> madam chair representative.
So that is
100% a dilemma
with all of these
alerts, right? That,
that kind of cross each
other. Um because
there isn't any clarity
on, hey, we
want a turquoise alert no matter
what, right, no
matter what. Ok. Well, then that
means we have to wait for that
investigator to
determine whether that person
is an enrolled member or
eligible to be
enrolled. I would
prefer to just put out the alert
and find that person, but
it's up to that investigator
to have that
wherewithal and understanding
of how to investigate,
to get all that information
right away so that I can use
that and figure out which
alert I need to put out right
away. >> Thank
you, madam chair. >> Thank you,
Representative Representative
Block. >> Thank you
madam chair. Thank you Lieutenant. Thank you
Sergeant. So quick
questions uh regarding
the bill itself, I
couldn't find an appropriation on
the bill. So I also
looked at our budget. It
was not listed in the budget
under turquoise alert. So I'm
wondering the two point I think
it was $2.5 million
it would cost.
Is that just something you guys
have to eat or is that built
into the budget somewhere else
that you that you know of madam
>> chair, madam chair
representative? So yeah, that was
uh I think that's a department
of Public Safety
question.
I don't have the answer to that as a state
>> police. Totally.
Thank you
>> representative
with the money we put to for
the train and stuff and went to the
administration of the court
and that's where they because they, that's where
all our local agencies,
our justice system per
se because they're not the only ones
involved with it.
Receive their
are, are the
agents.
>> Ok? Thank you madam chair. Thank you, represent
Senator and
uh, Lieutenant and Sergeant.
I'm just wondering because I
want to make sure that if there's any kind
of confusion, I want to
make sure that we nip it in the bud.
Right? So if,
if there's confusion on how to use
it, like with these tribal
entities, yeah, we can't force them to the
table, but
we certainly can incentivize
them. And I would just love to
see maybe legislation to
try to implement this
legislation instead of
just
a big pot of money at A OC,
which sounds great, you know,
but those guys have a lot, a lot
of work to do. And you guys too, you guys are
very busy. So, thank you so much.
I think that's all the questions I had,
but I really appreciate both of
you. I have the greatest respect,
respect for state police and
all the officers and I, I thank you both
for your service. Thank you so much madam
chair. >> Thank you,
Representative Little. >> Thank
you. Thank you so
much. Uh Good to see you
again. Uh 11
madam chair. My
question is
um
we're hearing about
the communication
now. This bill has been in
effect for less than
45 days. It actually is
45 days tomorrow.
So it's not surprising
that it's still
unknown that it's not
clear that there's still issues
that are rising coming
from this. So if
communication
is the issue madam
chair. Uh I'm
my question
is how
did the,
how were
tribal law enforcement or
tribal governments
and their law enforcement
departments
uh
informed about
the turquoise
alert being in
effect
and,
and uh
and
whether
there was an
indication in communication
with them
about
offering assistance from
DPS.
Thank you, Manager,
>> madam, chair representative. Thank
you. Um From the
DP, I don't know from the DP. Si
I, I don't have
any,
I can't answer for, for
Department of Public Safety if there was
anything that was
pushed out um or
not. Um
Yeah, I just know from the state
police side, the things that
we've done and the things that we have planned.
Um So yeah,
I can't speak for D
BS. >> Thank you,
madam chair. OK. The and
then the next uh
item I see the
issue that I see
is a
campaign to educate,
not just law
enforcement but the
community. Uh
we were at a
committee meeting
um last
month and
uh there
even among
the communities,
the the citizens
uh being informed about
this bill, about
this law being passed about
the opportunity
to
address the issue
of in
this time of
unfortunately, with human
trafficking. Uh
and how hard hitting
it is along that corridor
that was being described.
So,
um it, it's a
bit concerning
uh to me
that there, I
would like to see funds
available to
establish a campaign
to inform and
educate
communities, not
just law enforcement, but
do people know
madam chair, what
kind of information is
needed to
when they make a report? I
mean, it's a crisis
situation, you you're
talking about your loved
one. You don't
have the presence of mind
to
have like a checklist
available
but can.
But madam
chair, that
is part of what the
education is. And
if those tools are being
developed, how
can we facilitate,
helping this
information go out.
I've worked madam chairs
on census.
I've worked on a
number of statewide
uh um
uh
activities that
required reaching out to tribal
communities. It can be
done, it is successful and
it can be done successfully.
The key is that there need
to be resources. And as,
as my, as has
been asked previously,
you know, how, what is
this going to take
it? It is going to
take resources if we
want to implement this. And I
feel very strongly
about the fact that we
need this because this
is to address that
crisis that's taking place
now with human trafficking
in the silver alerts,
it's to it
actually, it's helpful to know
that you're working with a
person who may have dementia
who's walking, wandering
around, who may be
agitated or whatever,
if it's an amber
alert, a child.
Uh how do you approach
them when you do find them? I
mean, there are in my mind,
those are specific
categories that are
important
because they
kind of dictate
also how
I would imagine how you're going
to approach
the situation
when that person is
identified, how,
how, how, how,
how that's going to happen.
So, um
those are the two
pieces I would like to
know and I would like to request
madam chair
that um
respectfully from the
Department of Public Safety.
How information on
how this in
the uh turquoise
alert was
uh
um
how uh tribal
governments
and law enforcement were
informed. Um
II, I think that's kind of a simple
thing, but
I'm very interested to
see and, and ask
as well, uh inform
you for us as
to what
was communicated.
That would be a,
I think a very
good place to start.
>> And to my understanding, >> madam
chair. >> Thank you. And to my understanding,
this was an Indian Affairs Department
um
legislation supposedly
in that sense. So,
um and that's where
the original task
force was created.
So I think that's where we
got to bring in that entity
to as we move forward because
these guys are, are law enforcement
and we put a lot on their plate. I don't
think it's up to you to educate
um in the sense
train. Yes. But as
far as um putting some of
that out of, of what we're doing
for our tribal communities and I
believe our Indian Affairs Department
does have funding
to do such as far
as um all these
other collected
tobacco stuff like
there's little pockets there. But if they
need more, we need to find out.
Thank you, Representative
Representative Zamora.
>> Thank you madam chair
for allowing me to speak a second
time. Uh madam
chair and presenters
have the sovereign
nations ever been
denied to use any of
the other
alerts
madam chair,
>> madam chair Representative
of to my knowledge.
No.
>> OK. That concludes
all my questions, madam chair. >> Thank
you. Thank you, Representative
Royalle. >> Thank
you madam chair for letting
me on again in
listening to
all of this. I think I
have a clearer
understanding.
You explained it quite
simply, I mean, quite
well. Um
I think what
I said earlier about it's
incumbent on us
as legislators
also to
ensure that our
communities
are informed and educated
on the things that we do. And
this is one of those critical
areas that I
think we need
to really
step up and
do it as quickly as
possible
and include it now
as a regular item
on our
newsletters or
town halls with
our district legislative
aides and all of the
ways that we have
to convey this point of
information, critical
information and who to reach and
who's responsible for the
alert and
how to report.
So there's two things that I
see going on madam
chair. One is the
reporting part of
it, which
eventually has to get
to you based on
who the
family or the
persons reported
to. They
reported to their local
law enforcement
agency.
It's up to the
local
uh law enforcement
agency to
then
assess,
evaluate and come
up with
a plan of
response. Does it,
does it meet this
criteria? If
it does it goes
to this
for this
alert.
I see that quite
well, how it's being
done or how it's
being expected to be
done.
The question that or
the cloudy area that I
see. Madam chair
is
in what you all
identified is,
you're not getting
those reports
in order to be able to
activate an
alert, your job
is to activate the
alert. But
unless it gets
reported, number
one goes
to the law enforcement, the law
enforcement in
CSSA determines
it qualifies for this
alert, then it doesn't
get done.
So, we're on tribal
sovereign, tribal
nations and Pueblo's sovereign
lands.
Um, we have an added
layer
of
problem
and um and that
added layer, I think
we as the Indian
Affairs Committee
together with
all of our entities
need to pull
together or facilitate
and use the passwords,
whatever entity
we need to do to
facilitate
and um
and make it
mandatory
um
meeting
of the law enforcement
entities on
tribal lands nations and
pueblos that are responsible
so that we
are communicating
on the same
page.
I don't know what it's
what, where the breakdown
is with our tribal,
our tribes, nations and
pueblos on land. I
don't know where that,
why that's not happening.
I don't know if it's not happening
because our public
community
doesn't know that
they're, they should be
reporting this and that they
should be reporting this as soon as
possible because time is
of essence and
then who do they report
it to when you're
in a moment of crisis like
this with a family member,
you don't think
you don't think you
just act
instinctively
and sometimes your instincts
don't lead you to act in the
manner in which is
gonna respond
as quickly as you need
to. But in
what you described here
today, I
think we have a
um a a
breakdown
with the way
in which
this particular turquoise
alert
is being
um
understood or not
understood in
terms of tribes,
nations and pueblos and
perhaps in the tribal
leadership summit
coming up,
I don't know, but I think that we
have a responsibility
madam chair to
facilitate some sort
of a exchange
so that you all
can explain
it, chart it out,
start from step
one to step
10
and who's responsible,
create a flow chart,
let it flow and
then boom. And
then Dia's second
component is the public
information and
that, that's what I started
with and that's all of our
responsibilities.
So madam chair, I would
say that we really need to
help facilitate
this clarification,
this gathering, this
meeting, this whatever we're
gonna call it. But we
need to facilitate something
because I
even for our purposes,
we're not understanding that
flow chart. I can tell
just by how we're sitting
here asking
the kinds of questions which is
important to understand
that. But also we're
still not getting
the full clarity
that I think uh
would help
get this resolved or
get it moving forward in the way
that we anticipated it
with the legislation.
So I just wanted to offer
that however way we can
facilitate it. Like I
said, tribal
summit coming up, we
appeal to the
governors, appeal to the
president, the
councils, whatever
we need to do. But we have
an obligation to do it
and I would suggest that we do it
as soon as possible
and I don't know how to put in the
form of an action item, but we
can think about it and deal
with it tomorrow maybe or
another or quickly.
But thank you, madam chair and
thank you all. I, I hope I,
I got it right.
Thank you.
>> Thank you. And to the members
here that
everything you're talking about,
that's where the portal comes
in that with what we
put into the
administration of the
courts through the
doj's office and having
the attorney general be
the one generating it. So
right now, we actually had a
meeting this morning with
my
subcommittee's.
They have been brought up
in that committee and
they are supposed to submit,
drop the reports and submit
that very soon. So that
is still being generated. The
portal is there,
but it does need some
work and
even our advocates
and the victims' families
too have their little
input in there. So it
will be improved.
All of that's going to be there. There is going
to be improvement to the data
that some of the requests out
there, even these flow
charts to educate
those to go in because
you go right in there and it
says report a,
you know, make a missing person's
report. But
there is that education
part and that little bit
of a checklist and a flow chart
of what should happen, how long
should it take? You know,
all these other little things, what
does a family need to gather
before they submit this
report to really help them and
guide them through it?
And even how do we
put some triggers in
place as far as behavioral
health so that they
know where the, the where
to go, but not
that where they're having to
kind of go search
for these resources,
but specifically
to what is their
situation that
maybe that outreach can actually
come in this other communication
direction instead of
them having to do the outreach in
there. So the the work still
be I'm done.
I'm
me and I
know little is at the last
meeting but it
is a lot
gets processed
in there, but not everybody's at
the table to put their
input. But I appreciate you guys
coming in and enjoy
the presentation of their day even
though it was pretty intense.
A little there.
Put in the hot seat.
Oh, I
think I, I don't know if you'll
join us again on my
request, >> madam
chair. I just got back from
a reel to reel training with
active Tudor scenarios. This
is probably not a very intense
day for these gentlemen at
>> the task force meeting at
all.
But thank you for joining us and thank
you for the work you do and continue
to help our
people. >> So madam
chair and representatives, thank you again
and again, it's an open
invitation. Please
reach out to me if, if I,
I'm gonna be gathering my
things and I'll stay for a little
bit to hand out my
cards. Uh,
again, we're,
we're, you know, I, I got into this
job to help people 20
years later. That's still why I'm doing
it. And so
that's
why we're here. So,
whatever that means,
whatever that looks like,
I don't really care. I want to help
people. So
um reach out to me, we'll get the
training done. We'll
um you know, go to whatever
meetings we need to go to if
it has to be through teams, if it has to be
in person, I mean, we drove in
from Albuquerque just for this
so that we can answer these questions
and hopefully bring some light
and, and hopefully,
you know,
you know, alleviate some confusion
with this. So thank you
>> all. Thank you for indulging
us because we, we do have some new
legislators here, especially
on this particular issue and then
some on, on this committee
that have been with us as well and some
are are new too. So
thank you so much for the information,
knowledge. And if anything with
the committee members, our staff
will have their contact information
if you're not able to get it here and just
reach out to Nicole on that.
But thank you very much, safe travels
in safe endeavors as you go
forward, we will go into
recess until
730 in the morning.
I'm just
kidding.
9 45
9 45 to
noon tomorrow. I don't believe we
have any public comment
um in the room or on
zoom. So we will
be in recess to tomorrow morning.
