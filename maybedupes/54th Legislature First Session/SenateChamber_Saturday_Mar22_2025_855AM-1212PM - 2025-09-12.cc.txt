meaning of that is, what the
intent is there.

legislation that is going to be
heard that they have at least.
Senator Brant.

By the economic development
department.
And uh this would be to develop
the ports.
While I was being somewhat
facetious, uh.
I believe and, and I just want
to clarify this, that in this
case we're talking about an
inland port.
Where things can come in from
state of New Mexico. Is that,
did I, did I get it right this
time, Mr. President?
Mr. President, uh, Senator, that
is correct.
So, Mr. President, do we
And Mr. President, so if we have
an inland port.
Say in Gallup, just pulling a
place out of, out of thin air.
Uh, what would they do with that
inland port in
Mr. President and Senator, he
would be a logistic and

OK, Mr. Cargo ports.
I put on rail and then the rail
just comes all the way to
Gallup.
And in Gallup is where we then
sort it out and send it to
be anywhere, different parts of
the state or elsewhere.
OK, Mr. President, if there was
an inland port.

think I'm a happy camper now.

necessarily, but there has been

make the most sense since we

a few years, President.

there's many variables that can

the water fund project yesterday

they are still sleeping. I'm not
sure. Yeah, I know we went
really late last night, um, but
those same people are making
that argument today, aren't
making that or yesterday aren't
making that argument at all. And
yesterday.
Would, would you, do you see it
that way, Senator?
Senator Gonzalez, Mr. President,
be glad to. So yesterday we, we
passed the, the uh, uh, I can't
remember what the name of the
bill was, but, um, where we were
looking at
funding
To put in desalinization plants,
is that ring a bell? Yes.
Yes, now it does this present
several people in this chamber
were really, really upset.
You know, I believe that people
are willing to invest their
private funds and
With the help of the state, or
maybe even, you know, because we
My only concern with this bill
is really what I would call the
lack of transparency in this
bill.
But we really haven't gotten
many answers when I've asked for
them.
already.
I don't get any solid answers.
In fact, even when my own
chamber of commerce came to me
and said, you know, we like this
in Sandoval County.
So I see, it seems like, you
know, they're trying to say,
hey, just put it out there and
vote in faith.
Have faith in us.
His present senator, I will say
that you have never once lied to
me.
But I'd like to get the whole
I have no idea where they're
planning to go. I have no idea
what we're planning to do. I
have no idea what the
environmental impact will be of
them. I, I have no idea because
no one's willing to talk about
Or how they're going to affect
our communities or how they're
going to affect our traffic
flows or how they're going to
affect anything.
I just want some transparency.
everything's supposed to be in
the public eye and how
everything's supposed to be
transparent.
And yet on this particular bill.
I get no answers.
at all. I get a little sheet. I
don't have it here with me
today. I did yesterday.
But some of them may be
communities.
they would have to apply and uh
to uh some of your comments, so
this establishes the framework
and the state of New Mexico has
been working with this for quite
example in 599 here in Santa Fe,
where you have a jaguar Jaguar
Drive, that was completely 100.
% you know, done by private uh
more information, but you know,
just working with the framework,
and then it does require that
reporting will have to be done
it's been uh practiced in many
other states, but, you know, at
this time, you know, this is
where we are today with this
legislation.
Senator Brent.
Mr. President, uh, it's, um, in
different parts of the country I
know that Colorado has done
quite a few.
some, so, uh, I don't have that
information right in front of
me, but I know that as we have
worked with this in prior years
so you know that other states
have already established this.
So that the proposed trade port
district shall meet as many of
the following criteria is
feasible.
The time of designation.
Uh, the beneficial impact on a
economically disadvantaged,
distressed community, including
the county where the poverty
rate greater than the poverty
rate of New Mexico.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator, uh,
there's various, there's several
counties within our state, for
example, one would be Gallup.
So Mr. President, Senator, those
counties are gonna get a higher
priority than other counties?
Mr. President, uh, senator, that
availability of qualified labor
pool.
Are those counties.
You're gonna have a qualified
labor pool?
labor pool.
Do those counties have a
qualified labor pool? Are we
ready to go there?
Senator Gonzalez. Mr. President,
that part of the criteria that
it's asking.
Uh, Mr. President, uh, Senator,
another one of those nice vague
answers. Appreciate it. Uh,
So
Does that mean Sandoval County
doesn't get this or Bernalillo
County can't get this.
Um
So
According to the bill, they'll
Those counties would be like the
Don't even put a weight scale it
says they shall.
It's a wonderful word that we
always argue about here on the
floor, May and Shell.
county will be welcome and
following the criteria that is
established in the legislation,
you know, if they work for that
Is that what you mean by that?
Mr. President and Senator, no,
would be the same.
Senator, is there any county or
Community has a federal
designation as a foreign trade
zone.
Or sub-zone.
County and there's also one in
Donana County.
And there's a couple of others.
Uh, Mr. President, what about,
So with number 4, we got a
proximity to a designated
federal interstate highway or
other four-lane vehiclecular.
into that one right on I-40, um,
or I guess that's McKinley
County, sorry, uh, in Bernna Leo
County, maybe Sandoval and
Bertollio Township area.
So that might help my community,
OK?
Um, what about proximity to a
class one railroad line.
I don't think my community's got
that one.
Class One railroad line, Mr.
President, Senator, yes, yes
they do. Bern Leo probably does
as well as Donana.
Uh proximity to an airport. How,
how close does that mean,
proximity to go through the
chair. I'm sorry, Mr. President.
international passenger and air
freight service.
Do we have that in McKinley?
So as as far as how close the
proximity is will be established
by them. We're letting them do
that in the rule.
Mr. President, that is correct.

down to a minimum so that the

of interest.
That's, that's a good thing.

And hopefully it's something
that will bring jobs and
economic growth to our state.

be owned by the investors.
Senator Gonzalez
Mr. uh, president, Senator, uh,
Thank you, Mr. President and I
think that was some of the
concerns yesterday on these uh
desalinization plants.
Um
And I can see some of that
million to build one and the
state puts $40 million into one
of them. Will the state owned
40% of that, or will the state
just be giving that?
To whoever's running it.
overall, you know, how it's
putting together with uh with a
plan that will come forth.
Thank you, Mr. President and
Senator, you know, we,
bit about Israel's
desalinization plants and.
You know, when, when Israel
invests in something like a
trade port.
that company.
Or a 30% share of that trade
report. They do this with
technology all the time.
You know, that's actually become
new ideas and starting, uh,

the ones that have been working
on.

developments in AI for driving

It just, it seems like a very
logical thing. It's the same
thing if we're.
Having our universities do all

I actually would support.

Of

That normally would make about
$25 an hour for that work.
This is almost, I represented
yesterday.
Mr. President and Senator that
So, um, I know that this will
make our make our union friends
happy.
But the question remains as to
is accepting a grant or a loan
from the state.
Thereby increasing substantially
Like, uh, I guess the question
is about prevailing wage.
And why this would be inserted
into the program and why we
with state help. I is that
Is that a wise use.
Of these precious taxpayer
dollars.
You know, within our state, we
have many.
Areas and different employments
that we do support the
program also um more for also
with um.
Having uh employees.
Be more with more longevity and
You know, any time that you have
a very good employee that uh
that service is done and you
know, I think it works both
ways, but um it is uh.
Very typically, or not minimum
wage jobs. The one that I just
referenced took.
business owners that these
act
increase costs farther than
that.
Because
So,
Mr. President and Senator I
strongly disagree with these
increases the cost of our
capital projects, some 15 or
more percent over what they
would cost. I don't believe.
If we were not imposing these
mandates. Thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator,
for your answers.
Senator Munoz.
Thank you, Mr. President. You
Uh, and, and they try and we
struggle, they put a rail loop
in. I don't think there's
anybody on that rail loop. I
don't think a lot has happened.
And so this is the next thing
uh, Tucum Cary, I think there's
other trade ports. I can't
remember them all, um, but we're
not gonna develop if we don't
risk the money, uh, that's one
thing, the economic development
that'll happen because the roads
haven't been built on the
Mexican side. Uh, ports are
going to move things around and
product around, uh, but we'll
see what happens. Uh, we had to
no, and now we got some review
and some oversight over it,
which will be a good thing, but
All in New Mexico needs to
develop. I mean, Gallup grants,
you, you can name it, all rural
Rosa and so the rail will
develop along with the roads.
Uh, we'll see what happens in
economic development. It's going
to be a long, short struggle,
money to go around, but they're
gonna have to make this work
because
If we're watching what's
happening in the federal
government, every day when I
turn on the news today was kind
of sad because now they're
grow in New Mexico, um, because
we've struggled with that.
We'll see what this economic
development secretary if he has
any leadership to create jobs in
New Mexico and not just, uh, uh,
chase every outside company
across the world, but Mr.
President, I don't know if you
know this, but do you know that
on cloud shoes?
How can we help New Mexico
businesses, but whoever comes
with a little shiny lure from
out of state, we bite every
single time and we bite big and,
and we don't see that come to
fruition.
Mexico, otherwise, New Mexico is
gonna continue to struggle to
not grow with no jobs anywhere.
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you, Senator Munoz. Senator
Block.
Thank you, Mr. President. Well,
in, I think phase one of this.
This is called the I-40 trade
port corridor.
Which starts at the port of Los
Angeles and then goes through
um, Senator, this is a very
important bill. I, I wish it
would have been, um,
Discussed earlier in the
session, this is a potential for
Mr. President, Senator.
Do you know how many, and I know
the different trade ports are
different sizes. I get that, but
approximately, do you know how
many jobs there would be if we
there's a, a projection of at
least 2000.
Thank you, Mr. President. And
when you mean qualified
workforce.
port district shall meet uh the
following criteria are those
criteria, um, weighted
differently by chance?
Senator Gonzalez
will be set by by the rules, so
they, they uh would be having a
different weight, yes.
Thank you, Mr. President, uh,
Senator, um, you know, one of
the issues I think that we're
Is the, you know, the qualified
workforce, I think that, that
would be a challenge, but I, I,
I, I would argue, um, Mr. uh,
President and Senator that if
correct, Mr. President, Senator,
one of the other issues is the
speed of infrastructure here in
New Mexico, uh, my colleague on
this side was talking about PDV
I is that one of the challenges
uh that you see here with this
bill is just the speed of
infrastructure.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator, uh,
that is a very high possibility.
The brand new um economic
development secretary Mr. Rob,
Rob Black.
It's, would he not be in charge?
President, Senator, yes, he
would be in charge.
Thank you, Mr. President and uh
Senator, I, I talked about the
I-40 trade port, um.
Mr. President, Senator, I've
been informed that they're
working on it as we, as we're
here.
includes, uh, Senator, um, trade
ports, uh, being planned in
Texas and Oklahoma and speaking
of planning, uh, one thing I
didn't see in the bill, but is
already developed, uh, sir?
Mr. President, Senator, yes, uh,
the Senate Finance amendment
that was placed uh includes
that.
infrastructure enhancements in
regards to airports, runway
extensions, uh, rail yard
extensions, um, obviously road,
last one, Mr. President and
Senator. Is there only going to
be one trade porter there,
you're looking at multiple trade
ports because I would assume um
Uh, Mr. President, Senator, when
you mean multiple, uh, do you
mean 2 or more or 3 or more.
depending on how we're working
with this, the framework and the
progress and also the success of
the once established that uh
there will be definitely more
Mr. President, Senator, based on
which locations will be picked
for trade ports?
Mr.
designed and also with uh seeing
the framework, so that is
forthcoming.
Thank you Mr. President, and,
uh, Senator, uh, and I'm sure
your experts know because it's
fulfillment Center in FedEx
there and um and development
going north of there is, uh, is
this group uh looking at any
Mr. President, Senator, that
would be an opportunity,
definitely.
OK, Mr. President, Senator, I
think this is a very important
quite an ask.
Um, and I think Senator, um, uh,
from McKinley County over there
kind of captured that sentiment
well, but for me,
state, so I appreciate you, um,
Senator, bringing this forward.
I appreciate your experts being
here and I would just say, um,
Sandoval County and Bernalillo
Gallup and Grants and sent, uh,
Santa Rosa, so, uh, I look
forward to this. Oh, Mr.
President, Senator, is this
gonna, uh, send a report to the
be annually, but you know, that
can change, maybe it might even
be twice a year.
Mr. President, Senator, thank
you very much. I yield. Thank
you Senator Block. We have
Senator Tobiasson next.
Senator bison
Mr. President, one of the top
reasons why I ran for office and
why I'm standing here today in
And I'm sorry, it's, it's hard
to hear, Mr. President.
Thank you, Senator Brison. Thank
you, Mr. President.
is saying more people are
fleeing from New Mexico than any
other state in the country, we
should all take a pause and say
why and what can we do?
that just while we've been here
in the 60 day session, the price
of a barrel of oil has dropped
about $14.
It's a volatile business.
Mr. President, unless we take
opportunities like this to grow.
To look at our economy from a
new perspective.
We have them closing, we have
them fleeing.
So Mr. President, I'd like to
ask the sponsor.
Do you have a projection of what
Back. Thank you, Mr. President.
um, while the debate was
happening, I did a little
In that one port, it is housing
over 70 companies.
That employ over 4000 people.
Mr. President, sponsor, do you
know how many businesses we have
in the state of New Mexico that
generate over $300 million a
year.
Senor Gonzales.
actually don't have that answer
either, but I do know generally
speaking, the vast majority of
the businesses in the state of
New Mexico have 20 employees or
opportunities, I think.
What can the harm be?
Of investing in these critical
New Mexico and diversifying our
economic system.
We at some point will continue
to just say we're closed for
business.
do our best to diversify the
economy.
Grow job opportunity.
Bring low wage workers, bring
All the focus we have on
education and higher education
that a skilled labor force would
not be a far reach when you're

referring to when it says
skilled um and prepared labor

uh, Mr. President, uh Senator,
into the trades. I know one
association just off the top of
my head that heavily recruits
right out of high school.
President, you can have a high
school degree in the state of
New Mexico and make $100,000 a
year, maybe the first year out
of high school. That's what
skilled labor is going to do for
high school, get them interested
in training.
Train them through their last
years of high school and have
opportunity abound, just waiting
for them to walk through the
juvenile offenders that we spoke
about last night actually become
vibrant and, and thoughtful part
of our communities.
Because they see hope.
that we are passing legislation
that brings opportunity to the
state and brings a sense of
hope.
That something different is
ecosystems and have a vibrant
growing economy in the state of
New Mexico, so Mr. President,
sponsor, I am so thrilled that
you have brought this forward.
and hopefully discuss it again,
but what do we have to
lose
Our children feeling like they
have zero hope for their future
here in the state.
Mr. President, if you send your
children off to college.
Every senator that's in this
chamber that is going to place a
vote on this bill.
That you ask yourself.
Have you helped create an

that would manage those

that they can one have a

And another real concern is
having a complete board, that
there is taxation without
representation, and I think it's
why it's so important for them.
They're coming to us for help
and allowing them to appoint
that they can go out and fulfill

is to manage these dams.
