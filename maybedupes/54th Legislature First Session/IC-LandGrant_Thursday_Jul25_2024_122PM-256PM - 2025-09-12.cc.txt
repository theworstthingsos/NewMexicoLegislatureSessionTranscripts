Steve. That was a
good lunch break. Thanks to
Northern New Mexico College and
La Cocina de Espanola
for hosting
lunch. Today, we
enjoyed some red and green
enchiladas, frijoles,
and rice
tortillas. And so next,
we're gonna move on to the next
order of business, which is a status
update, the Merceds
Unida Center,
formerly the Piedra
Lre Visitors Center.
And I want to welcome Leonard
Martinez, the president of the San
Joaquin Del Rio, the
Chama Land Grant Merced
and my good friend Steve Polaco,
the president of the Land Grant
Merced de Los Pueblos,
the Tierra Amaria. Good
afternoon,
gentlemen.
>> Good afternoon,
Mr Chair
madam, vice chair
members of the committee
and all the audience.
Thank you very much for having us
here. It's always a
pleasure to talk to you.
Uh You've helped us
in so many ways
uh uh enhance
and, and uh make better
our land grants
uh through capital outlay
and uh your advice
as to what and
how to do
things.
First of all,
Leonard will introduce
himself as
well.
>> Good afternoon, Mr,
chair, vice
chair members of the committee.
Uh Thank you for having us here.
Uh Members of the
audience and uh Sanu
Kind Clan Grant. Thank
you also for your
time.
>> Yes, Mr Chair, madam, chair,
madam, vice president and
uh madam chair,
vice chair. Um
I'd like to start with
uh the Mercedes Unidas
Visitors Center.
Uh It's uh
used to be the old ghost
ranch site
where they had the lives
of Beaver Museum. What
have you? A lot of people
remember that when they were
Children, they would go
out there and visit it with
tours with the schools and
etcetera.
Uh What we're doing
now, the three land grants,
there's one Bautista
de Valde, the
San Joaquin
del Rio de
Jama and the Terra
Maria own that
property. And
um we
have been
uh
left with a heavy
chore uh
that was left by
uh the, the
National Forest Carson
National Forest
with these buildings that
were uh vandalized
as far as
uh uh all the
electric, electrical copper
was taken from the
buildings. So
we had to hire a
uh electrical
engineer to come up with a new
plan and new schematics
to, to replace
that. Uh We
hired him, he, he did
that and after that,
we went through the bid process,
we hired on with
a contracting uh
electrical uh
uh company
Sands Borough out of uh
Calen.
Uh they've performed, it's
taken because of
the, of the COVID.
Uh There was a hold back on
a lot of the panels.
So it took about a year and a half
before the panels came
in, they finally came
in and, uh, January
1st of
2024 they started
working on it.
Uh They
finally finished,
uh, uh, except for
one panel that was
a hold back
and I spoke with the
foreman,
uh, day
before yesterday.
And, uh,
he told me that the
panel finally came
in and that was
last Thursday.
So, um, it
was installed on
Friday. So the
job is complete.
All we need now
is for it to be
inspected.
Once it's inspected,
then we will
have the electric co
op company from
uh Chama, the
Nora Northern Rail,
uh Electric Co Op,
they'll come in and hook us
up. So once
we get that,
then we will
proceed with
the priorities
such as uh
the, well, there was a well
that had a uh
uh a pump, a Submersible
pump that was stuck
in the well, about 250
ft below
and he was gonna come in and,
and haul it out. I don't know
if uh
I haven't contacted him,
but I spoke to Leonard
about it and I don't know where
he is and he'll be able to address
that.
So, um,
this is what we're doing.
And uh, and we're also
working with um
with uh
uh community development
consulting associates, which
is in the brochure that I gave
you. I wish I could
have had
more. But
anyway, thanks for Mark. He
did print out a lot more
for, for everybody to
have and there's some more up on
the desk if anybody wanted to
look at that.
Uh, and we're going
through a, um,
uh, a Joint Powers
Agreement uh
between the three L
grants, uh, which
is being uh,
uh directed
or, or, uh
by
uh Holland Hart
attorneys out of Santa
Fe. Uh And,
uh, we went through
first procedures on,
on how to do that.
And basically what
that's gonna be is
the discussion is that
each land grant will
be a mother land grant
and they will pick
odd numbers from
1357
to, to create a
board.
This board will be,
uh taking care of
the business at the
Merced, uh
Unidas. So
that they'll have their
bylaws, they'll
have everything and once
they create their bylaws,
they bring it back to the Motherland
Grants and for our
approval,
any, once we approve
it, that any kind of projects
that they have, they
will, they will go
through it. And then same thing
again, they'll have to come back to the Motherland
Grant and we'll
have to approve whatever jobs
have to be done. We're
trying to get as much of
these jobs, uh
done with
contractors that
will agree to hire
some of our locals to help
do some of the labor or whatever
they can do. So our la so our
co la so our
locals could have
revenue.
So, um,
there is a, a lot
of opportunity there
for us.
Uh, it
sits on highway
8464.
There's a lot of traffic
traffic that goes through
there. The Continental
Divide trail goes right
through there. Well,
RV Station
is, was something that is
really big that we might do
there. Uh, also
we've been talking with the Rio
Rival County Sheriff's
Department who
wish to have a
substation there
if we had a substation
that would, uh, create
revenue because of the
lease. But also
it would, it would provide
security. Another
thing for security we
would want to do is put
in and I, I, this
is our Thera
Maria idea
in order to have, uh,
security would,
would, would be, uh,
to have Wi Fi
because if we had Wi Fi,
then we could, uh,
vision whenever
something's happening. It's, it's
instant vision on our, uh,
we'll be alerted with that
and that way we can get a hold of the
sheriff department or
who have been really cooper,
they've come down
and they, uh, they, they
stop by there, they do their
reports and
show their presence. So
it's helped a bit.
Uh, the second thing that we've
done is we've allowed the helicopter
EMT to land
there because we're so far
away, they come in
and they pick up people
there or, or,
and transport them on
to the city hospitals,
uh,
etcetera.
So, um,
right now, um,
um,
we're looking forward
and thank you so much
for the monies that you
have allowed us to
go through capital outlay.
We're trying to get these grants
through uh
through the community development
consulting uh
associates,
which, which are gonna be
the facilitators are Roger
Valdez, he's a consultant
in Amalio Madueno
who have a pretty
good experience at,
at the uh getting
he giving help
and money to help
our land grants and other land
grants. So in
that um members
of madam Mr chair
and madam vice
chair and members of the
committee, I'd like to hand it
over to uh president
uh Leonard Martinez from the
Rio Chama San
Joaquin,
>> um Mr
chair, uh madam,
vice chair and members of the
committee. And thank you, Steve for that great
presentation.
Um uh
Before you also presented the
spreadsheets, let me start by
going off logo to the
back page. That is the
initial uh
capital that we
got was
uh six hun uh that,
excuse me, that's the issue
of grammar amount
of capital that was
905,000,
$600,000 went
to the purchase of the
property, ok. That's
how much it cost us to buy it from the US
forest service.
We go on to the first sheet
in the front.
Uh Our treasure
set this up and sometimes we have a hard
time going through her uh
spreadsheets. There is an
ongoing, we're moving
to Quickbooks, so it should be
better next year. Uh
is the first uh is
what we paid through the
2023.
Um We had
$305,000
left. We spend
3000
$366.28
to Ralph's lack lock
and key here in Espanola,
we re keyed all the locks
changed them. So
uh the only one that access
to the
old PCIO,
which is the Mercedes you need. This
property is uh
Steve, the
president of Tierra Maria Land Grant
myself and
the Juan Bautista Land Grant.
Ok. So those are locks that we have and we
changed the locks at the
gates.
Um Next one
we did is uh is
RCRWC
Enterprises. And
Atlas, we paid
2200 and
$40 for the engineering
project. We had to do the whole
electrical system. It got
torn out. We had to redo
the whole engineering process and
that took a while because it
is time consuming for the engineer to
go in and do all that.
The next one is for
$6465.94.
That was for the,
well, the well person
to come in, he came in and pulled the,
well, it got stuck. So
we had to send a scope down to the
bottom to see why it
was stuck. Uh
So we're there
with that trying to figure
out how to get that out.
Um We
also the, the
video, well, log was another
$2351.25
because
the person
RWC Enterprises
doesn't have the capac capacity
to be able to look down and see
what the problem was. So we paid
that separate.
Uh We did also
purchase 2
40 22
40 ft containers
so we can store stuff there,
secure stuff that we, that we moved
out of some of the buildings. We have a security
inside the containers.
Uh So we have somewhere,
we can store some of the stuff the
forester left behind so
it stays in a secure environment
on the property.
We did have
uh air, air
photo tree tring to come into the property
and remove some of the trees. We had
some uh invasive
species trees on the property. We had
some uh uh
we also had some aspen
trees that were inside where the museum
was. We started to lean, getting
old and we
were afraid it was gonna damage the property
more. So we had that removed
all sagebrush removed and he
cleaned it out front and back,
trimmed the trees that were
still, that were still
surviving, trim, the ones that were still we
could use and
he did some other stuff for us on the
property.
Um
That cost was let
me get to, it was
$34,167.
Um And the electrical
work which uhe
alluded to was with was
with uh
sands, bro Electric.
That was $95,000.
And with that, we had to do
a what do you call
it a um
seal, a seal bid
basically where they come
in and because it's over $50,000
we have to get a advertised,
right? And then we describe what the project
was and they bid on that project.
We, we had two
bids. I think one was another
company in Albuquerque,
but that one came in way over
cost. So we went with
Sands Borough.
Um
on the other page you'll see on the
second page, you'll see our spreadsheet.
Uh the so kind Chama
Andren is also the physical agent for
the Mercedes Unido.
So we track
all the payments for
the Nora
uh which we pay. Uh and
we, any costs that
come in, we, we add it to that.
It's, it has some of ours
because it has to be included
in our spreadsheets when
we do the for D
fa. So you'll see some
of our dues and stuff in there. But the
cost uh is
on there for capital
deposits.
Uh We do have
uh let me go back to capital
outlay. We have
100 and 54,363
$63.43
left in capital left
over from the 905,000.
We did receive another
60,000 in capital outlay this
past year. So we have a total
of
$214,363.43.
That is still that we have
to be able to spend on, on some
of these projects.
Now, the $154,000
and 3300 and
$63.43
that is subject to being
recouped. Uh,
so we're gonna, um, uh,
myself,
our Arline Grant and
Tierra and Grant are gonna,
and try to meet with the Mabasa to
get that encumbered before
the legislative session. So it
doesn't get swept back in.
So we're, we're gonna have to do some
work, some basically to get some of this
stuff. Uh,
we are also waiting
for RWC
enterprises. They're gonna
come back and give us a cost to pull
how much it's gonna cost to finally pull that.
Well, now that we get electricity,
pull it out so we can hook
the water back up and hook the
electricity so we can pump
into the building to see what
lines are still. Ok. What's,
what's gonna be fixed plumbing? You
know, it's gonna be the next issue for
us.
Uh, and we will do some of
the restoration. Uh, Steve
want to do some of the stucco and
repairs to some of the buildings. So
that's some of the stuff that we want to get
encumbered this with this
fall. So it doesn't get swapped back
in and with that
all in for any
questions.
Thank you, Mr Chair. >> Any comments
or questions from the
committee?
Sure.
Representative Miguel
Garcia.
>> Thank you. Um,
Mr Chair. Thank
you uh uh
presenters
for um
for the presentation on the
visitor center.
Um Well, you
know, I'm a visitor center. Yeah,
Mercedes Unida
Center.
Um
you know, on that,
um
uh
on the spreadsheet where
you have the balance of 100 and
54,363
that's capital, that's capital,
outlay money.
>> Mr Vice
Chair and Representative
Garcia. That is correct.
We have no,
we have not received any
grant money or
federal dollars for this
project. >> You know,
if for some reason you're not
able to encumber
that uh you're
not gonna lose it
because we need,
what we need to do
is Mr Chair
is do a reauthorization
to extend
uh to extend
it for another year. I think
the extension
is maybe two years.
But uh so keep that in
mind if, if for some
reason, things don't
kind of uh
pan out
uh in terms of encumbering
it that we,
we have to go into the
session and
do a reauthorization
for, for whatever
balance you have
to kind of uh
extend
uh the purpose.
Um So you
won't lose it.
Um The
um
and
you know, you guys are really kind
of really
focused on
and um
how, how is
the, the
um the Juan
Bautista Valdez, how, how
are they partnering? I mean, are
they, they've been through
some real hardships
lately
and um have they
been able to kind of resurrect
Mr Chair from,
from those hardships and kind
of really, you know,
come on on
board, uh, with
their responsibility to
the Mercedes
Unida Center or, or
just, uh, uh,
just what is the status
in terms of how it applies
to, uh, to the center?
>> Yes, Mr Chair
madam, vice chair, Mr
Representative Garcia,
they have had some
hardships, Uh
They're having a hard time
coming together. We were hoping they
would be here, but evidently they
couldn't be here.
Uh, they've been missing
on a lot of the meetings that we've been
having on restoration
of the building and of
the, the land itself.
Uh, we try to encourage
them to come, but,
uh, they're having
issues and
hopefully we, you know, we
reached out, uh as
the T A has reached out
to them, I talked to
them regularly
about trying to make these
meetings, give them
an ample time
to, to come to these
meetings. Uh
But uh, we have
hope we have hope
that they will get it
together because they
did have some hardships.
Um,
so
with that,
um, yes,
there is hardships and hopefully,
hopefully they can come through
with it, uh, because
we do need them. They are part
of it. They need to be
involved. It
makes the whole world
go around with three of us
working, especially with the,
with the agreement that we're
trying to get between. It's a
governance that we're trying to have
uh with the rules and
what have you.
So this uh joint
powers agreement is very
important for them to
uh attend a lot
of our meetings.
>> And
>> Mr Chair, vice
chair Representative
Garcia, you know,
the Juan Bautista
Panders Land
Grant is
um our sister
Grant. We were created at the same
time and
uh we're all
related, you know, our line
granted. Third, we're, we're
just, you know, we're only
about 14
miles of the crow flies.
So we uh I reach
out to them. I speak, I try to
just like Steve here, we try
to reach, reach out to
them and,
and
they are having some difficult
issues. Uh, at the moment.
Um, I spoke to the
Sergeant warms on
Diego Serrano a
couple of times. Uh, who's a good friend
of mine from high school. I spoke
to Mary Lou was
also the vice, the vice president
who is also I've known for
years
and, um, I think
they need to have,
they need to sit down and reorganize
somehow how they gonna, how
they're gonna operate.
But until they do,
I think we do a
disservice to this committee
and the state legislature by not moving
forward. Uh We
still have work to do.
Uh, we will wait for them
as long as it takes, but
we cannot wait. We have
capital eight, capital
$8. We have
expectation from our heirs
on both sides that want
us to move this project forward.
So we will move, but
we will still keep
them informed of what we're doing.
And if they have any
objections, they, they, they,
they could show up to the meetings. They, they know
where we, we'd let them know where the
meetings are at. So
let us hope that they, they
do come around
soon.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chair and
thank you for that. Um,
you know, you mentioned
the possibility of
having a Sheriff
substation
at the center.
Um
What, what, what is the
process
um to
kind of make that
happen,
>> Mr Chair uh
madam, vice chair,
members of the committee.
Um Representative
Garcia, uh
we had
the, the uh community
development consultant, asso
uh and associates
uh uh consultant
Roger Valdez, right at
mou uh
that he suggested it's a
draft uh to
send to the Rio
Riba County Sheriff.
I forget his
name. But
anyway, it was a
draft. We have to meet
again so that we can
agree on that draft. Uh
the mou
we're not ready to have
them move in yet because we
have to get the well
situated. We have to make
sure the water quality is
fine. We have to make sure the
plumbing is good.
We have to make sure everything is
functionable. We
have to use
a lot of this money on,
on uh
weh the buildings,
um etcetera.
So, uh
but that's the process
is getting an mou with them.
They've shown interest,
interest in it ever since we
had a, a celebration
back three or four years
ago. Uh, they showed
interest. We had a tour and they
like the spot, they like
the office where it's at because it
has a, it has a kitchen,
it has a bathroom, it has a
little back room in the back and
then it has a storage room on the side
where they can keep their records or
whatever. So it's
ideal for them to have
it. So, um,
that's, that's the process of
doing the mou and then
proceeding from there, but
we're not ready for that yet.
Once we get our elect all
of that situated, then
we'll make the move on
having them
proceed. >> Yeah,
thank you for that Mr Chair.
That, that was my second question
is the readiness of
the facility. But you,
you answered
that um the,
the other thing Mr
Chair that you mentioned,
Steve was this
um
this medical
helicopter
um kind
of a
landing site
where, where in
the facility
is that happening?
>> Um Mr Chair
madam, vice chair, members
of the committee, Representative
Garcia that's
due north of the parking
lot. They've been using
it for years,
but they now that they
know that uh that we're
there, they contacted
us and uh
I told them that we have it locked
for security purposes. So I
gave them the combination
for that property
and they've been using it. So it's
very helpful that they, for
them. And it's, it's
great for the communities
surrounding that
they are able to land
there. It's
so, it's due north of the
parking lot. >> Yeah.
And, and Mr Chair,
who, who
operates
the, the
helicopter, the
emergency helicopter.
Uh, >> I think it's,
well, Dulci
EMT
cha EMT that
basic. I'm not sure
who the, the main
owners or, or the
people from the helicopter
company. I'm not sure who that is
but it's through them.
It's through the Dulce and,
and Chama and
the uh the La
Clinica del Pueblo
in Tiara
Maria.
>> Um Is there
some kind of monetary
exchange?
Uh
>> No,
Representative
Garcia, members
of the committee know there isn't, we're
just allowing them
to, to use it because it's
an emergency. It's,
it's something that we've
been trying to
emphasize is to help
our communities as much
as we can. I mean, we
need help. They
also need help and
uh as long as we
can allow them to do that, it's a
matter of life and death.
So that's why we're allowing them
to do that. >> Yeah.
Well, Mr Chair, that's very
honorable that you're
doing that, you know, at, at no
expense to
them because these
are really outstanding clinics
that we, that you mentioned
that have been in the business
for decades
and doing an incredible job
in terms of providing
health services to
our populations out
there. The
um that, that's
all I had, Mr Cherry. You kind
of, you really keep
up the good work that you're doing on that
center and, and
uh, you
know,
and when the
session is near,
you know, uh let us know me
and the senator, you
know, how,
how that 154,000
is, is looking.
And if we need to do a
reauthorization,
um going into
the session,
go in the session, we
still have maybe about a week
to make that determination,
but no more than a
week. But
if, if, if, if it's
the decision is made before
the session, that's even better
that we need to go that route. Run the
reauthorization.
>> Mr Chair, vice chair
representatives,
Representative Garcia,
members of the council.
Um that
landing uh
pod
where the helicopter uh
lands is
all gravel
weeds. What have
you? It would be nice
in the future to get
it paved and
have
a really nice spot for
them because it's
important to our communities if
we can get enough money to do that
with a nice payment, like such
as what they have at the
clinica in, in Tierra Maria.
That way, if
ambulances come in, they won't
get stuck, etcetera,
they'll have a nice pavement to
go in and we'll have
a maybe an electric gate
that, that they'll be able to come
in instead of having to get off
somebody doing the
combination. It's timely.
So if we can do something like
that, that would be ideal.
We haven't spoken about
that. That just came up into my mind
now that we're talking, but
I would like to bring it up to the
rest of the land grants
that that would be another
uh priority that we
might want to do
in the future. And hopefully,
uh this would serve
our communities not
only the Tre Maria up
north, the, the Andrada
to the north there, but
all over Gina
everywhere.
So that would be an ideal
thing to do. >> Yeah.
Well, thank you for that,
Mr chair, you
have that
>> um Mr Chair madam,
vice chair and uh
represent and represent
Garcia. We did look at
the escalating to see how much
that will cost
done in the past. And it came in
that like at 100 and $50,000
to do the whole because they will have
to rip up the old
payment and put a
new one and then, and
put it up to
how to standards
of the state of New Mexico. Because we have,
since we need government, he
would have to meet the state standards
for payment and whatever
that, whatever that means, that's what they
told us, but they would cost us 100
to repave that whole parking
lot, not just the, the one that's
in front of the center, but the
off uh we have the parking
to the left of it. That's
the, the overflow
parking to do both
parking. So just,
just to let you know, Mr Chairman.
>> Yeah, and Mr Chair. Um,
you know, and what's, what's to keep you
guys from, from,
from kind of, um, you
already have an estimate,
but what's to keep
you guys from kind of doing
a full estimate
in terms of not just including the
payment, the
repaving, but also
the situations with the
fencing, the gate,
etcetera and
kind of having that estimate
and maybe submitting
something in the next
coming session.
Um, you
know, uh I'd be willing to
be one of the partners and
putting money towards that
to kind of uh
kind of make it a team
effort. So,
uh uh in terms of
legislators. So,
um I keep that in mind,
I mean, if it's something
that can be done
uh immediately,
uh you know, that you
guys have a lot of support in
this committee, you
know, in terms of the initial
funding for the center,
naturally, the governor put in a big
chunk of what was
it? Um
300,000. What,
what was the, the the
amount that the governor
put in towards the capital for the
purchase?
>> Mr Chair
madam, vice chair members of the
committee represent
Garcia. I think the governor
originally put in
400,000
and, and, and
it's Mr Garcia
is also, it's in our ac IP that we
did request that money so
the money is in there for
to redo the parking lot.
It's just that
when we get funding,
we get
in
this, this, this land granting committee
knows we, you know, we
get uh capital
a small
chunks so
we, we appreciate anything we
get. Don't get me wrong,
but it's kind of hard to
be able to do a project
for 100 and 54,000 when
it, that's all our capital.
All a is gonna go there on that
project. >> Yeah.
Well, if you, I mean, you've got
that balance Mr Chair, but I'm
saying that seek
additional capital
for the,
for this project that
you're talking about and
I'm pretty sure that a
lot of us in this committee would
be willing to partner up
and whatever.
But
for 40,000
each and before, you know, you
got
or 20,000 each
and, you know, among
six of us and you've got
your project
total. You know,
that just a suggestion, Mr
Chair, >> good
suggestion, Mr, chair,
vice chair
and members of the committee,
Mr Garcia.
Um The issue
that we're going through with Caple
and D FA is
the time,
uh, a lot of times
they're overwhelmed with all
the requests.
So when a
contractor gives a
bid or what have
you, they're backed
up and plus they have jobs
that they have to do so they need
to have their schedules
going. And there's,
it would be nice if there was
maybe more staff
in D FA to help
process these monies
and so that they can
be, uh, more,
uh, more so that we can
get the money faster
so that there's no hold up with
contractors. That's the experience
that we've been having in the
Terra Maria with some of these
monies, it has to go through that
process. Sometimes it takes
2 to 3 weeks or even a month
before and sometimes
these contractors,
they kind of lose interest
so they get
frustrated because
it takes so long for them to
get paid.
So if there was something that
could help speed it up, like maybe
more staff, I don't know what the answer
might be but something
like that would, would help.
Thank you, Mister Garcia.
Representative Garcia. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. That's all the questions I
have. >> Thank
you, Representative
Harry Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
You know, I, I just have a
concern.
I've been listening to the
conversation
and uh you have three land
grants that are partnering up.
You know, you know, I've been a
businessman for 40 years
and partnerships don't work.
And you know, my concern is what
the questions that were asked, Mr
Chairman and what you were answering
is one of the
land grants is struggling.
What effect is that gonna have on
the other two land
grants if this land grant can't
do it. So now
two land grants are putting in
pitching the money and doing all the
work and one land grant
is kind of kicking back.
What effect is gonna is that gonna
have in the long long
term?
>> Mr chair, vice
chair, um
members of the committee,
uh Representative
Garcia, that
is a dilemma
because it's not
fair that
we do our share and they
just sit back.
That's why we have hope and
that's why we try to tell them, you know,
we're helping them, not
only us, but the land
grant council has
told them if
you have any questions, if you
need any guidance, we're
there. The staff has told them
the program manager,
Arturo Archuleta, the
whole committee,
the whole council has told
them this, but we're
not getting a response and I
hate to think about what's
gonna happen when
everything is already done.
And we have a saying up North
Panna seo
Calvados, unal is a,
is a whole when
you're raking or, or Hoing
to paca, to
paca. So we,
we fear that that won't
happen. We have
hope that they get their,
their organization
put together and work
with us. Uh I
hate to, to, to
come to a conclusion on what
might happen,
but we have to
expect uh we
have hope that we have to expect
the, the, the bad stuff
that might happen.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair and the presenters,
you know, because that, that is an
issue
and, and the
reality of the whole
deal, you're gonna have to
face it sooner or later
and it's not fair
to none of the lying
grants
to
take the brunt of the thing. And
at the end of the day
when it's finished, he say, well, look how
good we did here. And, you know,
you guys need to uh
before you get too far ahead of
yourself, you might need to address
that issue before it
gets to that point. You know, and I'm
just an outsider looking
in, you know, Mr
Chair and the presenters,
you know, I have a couple of land grants
in, in my district
and, you know, partnerships are
terrible at the end of
the day. They just,
I don't want your whole project to fall
apart over a bad
partnership and you
guys really need to
address that issue before you get
way too ahead of
yourself. Because at the
end of the day, if you
wanna break the
partnership is gonna fall
apart, everybody's gonna
be mad. The other
landman is gonna be saying, well, how come
we didn't do this before and that
kind of stuff? That's just my common
concern. Thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you and seeing no others.
I just have a couple of questions.
So I do know that you said the
copper was stolen,
which is a major issue in
this area. What
do you do for security? Do
members of the land grant just
cruise around. Have you worked
with the sheriff's office to
help, to provide more
of a presence to
serve as a deterrent?
>> Yes. Uh, Mr
Chair, vice
chair and members
of the committee.
I am a barber
and I,
uh,
one of the sheriff's,
uh, one of the deputies,
uh, from Chama is
one of my customers and he's been
my customer for a long time and
we've been talking about this
for a long time
and I gave him the
combination
to, uh, the
property and
they do come in,
they'll park there,
they'll, they'll go into the
parking lot
and, and they'll
show their presence. So
that helps. But
once we get things going,
especially the, we, we,
after the electricity,
that's the time to get our wifi
in because as soon
as we get that Wi Fi,
we'll have better security
because, you know, ring and all
of these other,
uh, types
of security, we'll be
able to see something. It'll
come to each one of our
phones, probably the
pres, each one of the presidents
and we can call
right away because
they're always patrolling
and they already know.
So we have made
steps, we have been making
steps to do that >> and
then I don't know the answer to
this. But
if the sheriff's
office does come in, can the county
then help you with infrastructure
improvements? I don't
remember that if it's leased.
>> Um, uh
Mr Chair, uh,
I've been talking to, uh,
Commissioner Moises
Morales about that
and he's been very helpful.
He wants to help as much as he
can. And I've
been, uh, telling
him because we do know they
have revenues and what have
you. So, uh, there
is discussion
>> and just everyone knows, just a
comment. Our county is so
big that
having a substation
would make sense right
there because that's
center. If you think about
it. And that way they don't have to always
drive into Espanola to their
headquarters. They'd have that
substation. That's something I
definitely support and I really
appreciate it. Representative
Miguel Garcia's comment
about allocating
some of his capital funds.
I'd also pitch in for
that. And so I want to thank
you for being good stewards of your
community and assisting
with those helicopters that come
in because we understand the
importance that time is
of the essence we need to
get your loved ones to a
hospital.
>> Uh, Mr
Chair, Ramilo, Vice
chair and members of the committee.
One thing that, that was stressed
to us by the previous,
uh, Sheriff's Department
was they need
wi fi for their
computers to do the
work for, for security is another
reason, but without
electricity, we couldn't
get wi Fi. So
that's why we're very
happy to get this
electrical work done
so we can do a
security system up in the property.
That is, and one
thing I would urge
is this
committee is to help line
grants with
the getting
insurance for a building like
that. That has been one of the problems
is insurance.
The reason being is because it's
owned by three land
grants and the
governance structure is not completed.
So they're really hesitant
on ensuring the
buildings.
Uh and
then uh is it
Gsggst?
I think it's the one
they won't, they won't touch it with a
temple poll.
So, uh we, that is
one of the problems we're having there,
Mr Chair. And I hope
uh you guys, um you know, this
committee can help us with that.
Thank you,
>> Senator. I mean,
Representative Ortez.
>> Thank you chair.
Um Is it, is the
issue that there are
three land grants that own the
building? Is that the issue with the
insurance?
>> Well, uh
madam vice chair
Ortez. Um
yes. And
uh but I think there,
there are companies out there
that might, I've been speaking
to an insurance
company up
in Chama who
insures a all
of the Tara Maria, land grants,
properties and buildings,
etcetera. So
um I I mentioned it
to her. Uh we
just need to get this uh
powers of a
joint powers agreement
settled. Once we get that
done, then we'll have an
easier uh
chance of
getting that, that kind of insurance
for, for us.
I believe
uh the liability
might, that might be
easiest, but we have to
look at all of that stuff.
But yes, thank you.
Thank you, >> Matt and Representative
Christina Ortez. And
right now when we do our general
liability for that, so Joaquin
Chama Grant,
our general liability
is only, is, is for the
sul line grant,
but it also
it ups our liability
because since we're
the, the physical
agent for that property,
it falls under ours.
Uh, and, uh, so
if anything happens on that
property, it's not
gonna be with the other line
Grans, it's gonna be with just the
song we can Tolan
Grat.
>> Um
Madam Vice,
um,
the
contractors that
we contract to come and do
work, we
ask them, we,
we demand that they
have liability
for whenever if anybody
gets injured, they'll
be covered.
But us as a board
or any of our people, we
have to work on
that.
>> And I got a text message
from Jolene Jones of the
State police. That state police
are also doing rounds,
not always entering a
code, but they
patrol and are keeping a
watchful eye of the senator
as well. >> Yes, we
were approached by the state
police. They also
were thinking about having
the doing,
doing the same thing as, as a
subtype type
station there.
So if we have both entities,
that's even better.
>> So my last comment is I hope
you put a selfie location that's
gonna have something nice in the background
when I take the senators selfie
with the three merceds
on there. And so thank
you gentlemen for that presentation. We
look forward to continuing to work with you and
getting updates from you.
And so with that, we're gonna stay with you,
Steve for the
last item on
our agenda, which is the update
on Laguna del Campo
transfer and other
issues facing the land grat
Merced de los Pueblos
de Tierra, Maria,
>> Mr Chair. One last thing, can
I add that I spoke
to Marco Legislative
Service Council about
maybe next year. It's been 10
years since this
land committees visit us.
So we extend the invitation for
next year >> and I believe
that Representative Ortez as
the incoming chair would accept
that invitation.
Yes, I would >> Mr
Chair. I think I've already
promised with
your permission.
Mark.
Not
no,
Leonard is there wi Fi at that
location.
So we gotta, we gotta build it.
We can't have a interim committee
meeting in a place with no wi
fi.
It's true,
>> Mr chair, vice
chair members of the committee.
We do this. We're going to
do it. We're going to look at the
Cajon communities here in
Cajon that is
within our former common Ls.
So we will probably do it
there and that should
have wi Fi there. >> Otherwise we're
going to use Representative
Lorde's
hotspot.
>> No, we're gonna do it in Klo. Thank
you.
>> Yes, Mr Chair
members of the committee.
Uh I brought along
my vice president,
Melvin
Apodaca Sergeant of
Arms, Berardino,
Jose Berardino
Arteta and our
project manager
Alberto
Martinez. Uh
We've been working
diligently trying to
improve all of our properties.
We did uh a
choir
property in a lawsuit
that was headed by
Hector Balderas when he
was Attorney General's office
where uh
we have uh La
Colonia. We call it, it's
100 and 216
acres, which was known as La
Terra Muerte property with
the Flores case.
Uh
We
were approached,
well, there was a, a meeting
by held by the Game and
Fish Department
back in 2017,
it was the previous uh Game
and Fish Commission
where they had
had this meeting
in Clayton, New
Mexico. And we
demanded that this meeting
would be held in
Tierra Maria.
So they adhered to our
request and they
had that meeting
in that meeting. They
discussed that they were gonna
uh uh
get rid of the uh get
rid of the, the lake completely.
They wanted to breach the
dam, they,
and we said, no, that's
our jewel. Uh It
was on common land.
So we uh
we, at that time,
we were accompanied by
Representative Garcia
at a meeting down in, in
Albuquerque at the Marriott
Hotel, uh
the pyramid, the old pyramid
building. And
we waited all day for
their uh for their
decision or whatever they were gonna
do, they put us last on their
agenda. So we
waited, we waited, we waited.
And during the time when we were waiting,
we had a strategy as to
how we were gonna talk and
who was gonna say what?
But as soon as they came out of
their, their uh meeting,
it was a, it was a closed
door meeting. Uh
So they came out and
they approached us to come up, we're
already sitting up on in
front and they
told us that they had come to
the agreement that they were going to give
us the
lake
Lock Stock and barrel the
whole ballpark.
So we were surprised.
So we started
working with the pre with that
uh coun that
committee, the commission,
uh the land, uh
the Game and
Fish Commission.
And at that time, they were
working with us, uh giving
us everything and then they
had a, they
had an election, I guess it
was, and there was a whole new
commission that was
created at
that commission. We had a
meeting down in
Albuquerque with
them and they were gonna
write out the deed. In fact, the
deed was already written out
to us. But at that
time, the chair of
that uh commission
decided not to give it
to us. Uh For
reasons. I don't know why,
but they did. And that's
when the problems started
pro I say problems
because since then
it's been a back and forth
thing. Uh
as to
their claim for
the water rights on there
as to management.
Uh We've had we in
within, in five
years and this is
the six year it's been
back and forth. They've
come to an agreement,
they changed the agreement
you and it's
just been a nightmare for
us. We submitted
our last request, this letter
that I it's in your hand out. This
is our last request.
And uh II I
it's self
explanatory. It
tells, you know,
everything that we've gone
through with them. Uh
And hopefully
they will adhere to that.
We submitted this on July
1st and
hopefully they will come
to their senses
and allow us to take this
lake because it's
in bad need of care.
They've neglected this
lake uh for
all the years that since
2017 that we know
of. And previously it was the
same way. Uh
It seems like gai and fish
has, has just dropped
the ball on that lake.
It's, it's,
it's just a mess.
And the last presentation,
the last several uh
presentations that we
gave on the Laguna,
it hasn't changed. It's even gotten
worse. Trash is all
over. Uh Our
community goes there
and, and they, they
voluntarily pick up
trash. Uh The,
they don't use the outhouses
inside because it's
just, it's
just putrid.
So people are starting
to use the, the restrooms
outside and that's
unsanitary. It's really
bad. It's
environmentally and
unsafe. It's just so bad
that it's, it's it's
ridiculous that gam and fish
is doing this since
they own it. And there's supposed to be a state
entity protecting the
public. Uh
We intend to go
in. We've got
plans to, to
clean it up. We
want to do handicap
uh uh uh
easements, uh uh
accessibility
to get in. We want to put
platforms for people in
wheelchairs or what have you can
get on these platforms and
fish with a cover on
them to protect them from the sun
and, and elements. Uh
We want,
uh probably to, to
get rid of the outhouses and
put in some kind of a septic
and sewer type
leach fill type,
uh uh accessibility
for restrooms. There's
just a lot of work that we want
to do. It's gonna take
money, more capital, outlay
money right now.
Since it doesn't belong
to us, we haven't been able to
ask for any money for that.
We did get allocated when we
first thought that since
the, the committee
granted us through
a resolution that that
was our, our lake,
but game and fish is
just, they,
they, they've
done everything
uh to, to hold us
back. It's been a big stall.
It's been a very big disappointment
on that entity.
We went along. We did
have a little bit of money, so we did
buy lawnmowers,
weed eaters. We're
ready to go at it,
but we just
haven't been able to do it because
they haven't
agreed.
So that's where we're at with
the, with Laguna Del
Campo
and there's other issues. But
if you want, if you have any
questions about Laguna Del
Campo, I'd like to take those
and it's up to you Mr Chair,
if we can take
it in sequence or if we can
address them as, as they come.
>> Thank you, Steve. What we'll do is we'll hold
questions till the end of your
presentation.
>> Another thing
uh
um
we
had come to an
agreement with the Rear
County to have
an inner governmental
transfer of property
of the old
uh superintendents
Chama Valley superintendents
administration building.
It was built in
1936.
It's all Adobe. It's
a two story and a basement
where the, where the
boilers used to
be.
The code will not
allow handicap
to go upstairs because
it's, the stairs are,
are pretty bad.
So we're trying to see if
we can get a
grant
through
um through
the um the
same uh
process of
uh of
uh getting
architects, getting
gener uh uh
contractors
to come and look
at the, look at the property and
figure out where
that elevator could
be. We don't want
a big elevator, in
fact, Melvin
and I rode the elevator
here. Uh and
it's the right size.
So we're gonna try
to have this
grant. We, we
try to work through, through,
through mainstream
but um
Main Street, but
uh we've had bad
experiences with Main Street.
Uh They, they didn't really
under get things going
for us with the Mercedes
Unidas. So
we're going along with a grant
writer that is being
paid through with the help of
Representative Herrera.
There was uh
there was a bill or, or
something was we >> both
funded our junior funds
to make sure that you get
those.
>> So, uh we want to put
that in uh the
building is really good
condition, very good
condition. Uh
So um uh
that's one
obstacle that we need to do there.
We just now went through an upgrade
because it was a 100
amp. So we
upgraded it to, to a
200 amp. Uh, we're
waiting for the inspector to
come and, and,
and give us a, a green
light. Once we get the
green light, then we'll have Nora
hook it up and then we're
ready to proceed
with, uh, with
the
plus. Uh, we want
to, uh, get rid
of, we, we got to take a
sample of, of the
flooring because we think it might be
asbestos.
And I've got a company in
Albuquerque who if we take a
sample to this company,
uh, they'll tell us if it's
asbestos or not.
Hopefully it's not.
Uh We all, we,
we also
have a
La Colonia, which is,
was the property
of the Terra Muerte
property where we're
going through a mado system
for fuel wood uh
program for
locals to have fuel wood
uh and help fire
prevention. And
also we put in a, a
stock pond,
uh, an old stock pond
was there. So they came in and they
cleaned it out and
made it uh
uh accessible
for livestock
for uh
wildlife.
Uh uh
And, um,
and uh, we
also have a container up there.
We have a skid steer that we
purchased, uh, to
help uh
uh get wood out of there.
Once we get the, the program
going and we put
in uh electrical
uh line,
we had to hire Russom
trucking with their
bulldozer to put in a power
line in
a knock down trees and those
trees were using for fuel
wood. We have our community
come up and our project
manager, Alberto
is, is directing all of
that. Uh He's an
expert. He's been in
the business for many,
many years, over 15
thir 20 years of it,
he's experienced
in uh operations of
backhoes, bulldozers,
heavy equipment,
etcetera. He's been a
very good asset
for us and
uh the council has
been uh
working uh
to get the community.
We had our first uh
uh meeting up
there since uh
uh
and everybody uh
who attended our meeting,
uh uh really
enjoyed that and want to have another
final meeting up there in August
before the winter comes in
because uh some
of you have been up there and you can see
the scenery is beautiful.
You can see the Brazos, the,
the Chama peaks, the whole
valley and we call
it the Del Valle de Terra
Maria. Uh
So, uh
uh if there's anything that
maybe any of the members
here would like to say that
we
>> here
and now we have a house,
the land ground, we have a house in general.
But thank thank, thank
everybody. Good commissioner.
The reason I came over
here,
it's been seven
years.
Look, I had
100 and 30 people in, in the
commissioner's room in Tierra Maria,
100 and 29 were in favor
of one against it.
And we had a meeting from,
from, from Carls
back from Flores from
Clayton Albuquerque
Espanola and de Quierra
attended that meeting
from Belen. As soon as they came
to preserve La Laguna del
Campo. They call
me, I've been fishing there all the
time, teach my grandkids
my kids it all.
And uh they call
me Larin
Juana Eral, la una del
Campo la
Junta la Turo in
Clayton.
They had the meeting in Clayton
in Metana Mando because I
fish all the time. II, I am
fishman. I like
that lake was to sneak before it was
giving fish was to sneak there.
So anyway, uh
we had that meeting,
July the
17th.
The commissioners passed
a resolution
to adopt a resolution
to help us get this
Auna Campo.
And it doesn't help only the
fishermen help the, the,
the, the stores, the
hotels and moel people that go
from here and stay
there.
You know, August the
17th, August uh
24th of
2017. We had a meeting
in La Bur, we went over and sit
down all day long.
We didn't wish for it like
Tammy Campo Commi
uh manager went Tay
Campos and the commission and he
said, be careful what you
wish for. We didn't wish for it.
They came out and said, I mean, we're
not gonna close Laguna
Campo.
We're going to give it to
you,
Tala Susana
Martine,
Ala Ala
Susana uh
Sandoval,
Isda Jaramillo,
Donald Jaramillo. Call me
be Amino there. After me. A lot
of people, I will go
on Sundays after ma and tell him and
call, call, they give me a fish. I'm
tired of calling me. We're gonna
have a meeting in Car Maria the
17th.
So he helped me with the
gravel
Leno
Jaramillo a
long night. He helped me with the
gravel. So I stepped up
going and, and we got
involved the L
to, but now
it May, May,
May the
May May. The
first launa company
opens. It was a
disgrace that treasure was over
there. The witch will not.
God.
H I live on
a me, I talked with the
same guy from, from the game and
fish that works here. He said
we don't have enough help.
We don't have enough help. I wish
you get that la una Campo. We
don't have enough help. He
has four workers
from outside. No new local,
but they don't care about it.
Well, they're not
from there. So
Orra, uh I've
been working on it. I
got some pictures over here. I'm
gonna show it to you. It's,
it's a disgrace.
It's a disgrace. What's
happening.
I'm gonna show you you can use the
road, what
they did with the road there, the
gravel, the trash.
And I'm gonna show you out here
handicap. We don't have a
handicap. There's not a
handicap, the poor
people. I mean, I, the people
that go, that's how I got involved.
There was a veteran sitting down with
one leg in the rocks,
sitting a veteran.
Uh uh Yeah, pass it
around. Uh, I think you
sitting, sitting down
there, you know, there
was a lady carrying a little
girl just like that because she couldn't get
off all the way to the
gravel. So I got
more involved. No,
I went to Sim Marron
and Cimarron. They have,
they have bridges, they have seats, they
have everything over here.
The ramp. I already have Russells,
San Andre say, but, I
mean, I'll give you, I'll give you the
material to make a ramp. There's no
ramp right
now. The weeds are 5 ft tall.
The trash, I went and picked it up.
The rests. Don't have
tissue
and
the, the
manager from the, from the, from the
game, you know, we don't have
time, we should get it. I go
out, I go fishing, you can even
fly fish. We 5 ft
tall, you can throw a screen of 5
ft tall. The kids,
the crow, you're gonna see it there
to, it's, it's 10
ft wide. We
like to pay that around
it. So the wheelchairs can go
through and put some as up
for the baseball field.
Put it there.
You can even go to. The kids
are going, there's
rattlesnakes,
you know, he goes to see by
the, by the, we are high. They're
tall. My son
took those pictures. I went over there,
you know, and it's a
disgrace the way it
is, but it's not
their fault. The guys that work
there. Like they say, it's not, they have too
much to do, taking
fish and everything. You know,
it's a disgrace.
It's seven years.
Sloan and the G
and Fisher, the
board of the, of the, of
the game, doubt what they
did
a area. But we tired of it
if they're going to give it to us,
if they, the, I say you
gonna che on the power to get
out what they will want to do
what they want to excuse the word.
But they are not doing that. It's a
disgrace. And people came
are, you know, pick up
Morales was
the game fish is a,
I'm gonna pick up the
garbage.
Yeah, they want to pick it
up. Well, you
call and tell him no, you want
to
what they're going to do it this
way we can take over,
we can build handicapped
grounds so people can fish you
with the chairs,
the soldiers, you
know, they don't go by
themselves, take them and park them there
and fish and
fish there. You know, it's a beautiful
lake full of water. There's plenty of
water or a,
plenty of water in that lake.
La Puente.
They complain
about it. The bridge,
the lake
is full of water running, you
know. So we want you to
take action of those.
If you can help us, all of
you help us with this deal
and talk to the governor. If they're
going to give us that lake, I
have a lot of volunteers
that let me know we're gonna help you with donations.
No, no
donations yet.
After we get to Zuna, you
can get a donations. We put it in the
bank, no cash or not. Put
it in the bank and you can help us where we want
to. I have Tomas
Tomas photograph who used to
work for the K. He's a, he's a,
he's a, he's
a engineer. Uh I'll
help you. A guy from her. He
said I'm an engineer.
I'll help you with our, you know, we'll help you.
We will help all the people from over
there. Please
stop over
seven years ago or seven. You know,
I don't want to, maybe I'll get to
get another seven or 1020
more years. I don't know. You
know, thank
you very much. If you can help
us,
Malan do something about it.
You have to, we're tired
of it. It's a shame that
people go, can't even fish. I
say one day go and they take off to
another place because they can
fish.
Nish maja, all of you and
thank you all of you for having
the patience and, and the
to us a keep.
That's a way that's
thank >> you, Mr, chair members
of the committee. Yes,
we do have a lot of issues at the
Laguna Del Campo. That's our
thorn that we've been
dealing with for seven since
2017.
We can't seem to make
them move or agree.
They took half of the water rights.
When, when the original
board was gonna
give us the all of the water
rights. I hate to go into
litigation with this to
go take it to court,
but hopefully this is the last
straw and
hopefully we don't have to do
that.
If there's any questions, I entertain
any kind of questions that you might
have. Thank
you,
Representative
Lord,
>> thank you, Mr Chair.
Um I'm seeing if there's any,
these are the pictures that you showed
me
and more you
showed me more than that. It
was pretty gross.
Um So explain
to me how this worked out. So they
give you this
lake,
they gave you the full
water rights, then they're saying
half the right water, right? So
that's the first thing. And
two in that agreement is that
fishing game was still
upkeep, upkeep. This not
just stocking but to do
all this work. Is that correct? Is that what
the original agreement was? >> Mr
Chair madam
Representative
Lord. Yes,
that was, they were
gonna stock it
and they were
gonna be cleaning it all
along. It hasn't
happened
year after year since
2017. They
uh you go to
their, to their
uh
workshop, we've
been in their
workshop,
we've been in their workshop
and you see
lawnmowers, you know, torn
apart. You
see uh
weed eaters
just hanging
around, nothing, clean
tools scattered all over.
They're not organized. That's
a shame that they're a state
entity and the
workers, I don't know if the super
supervisor uh
directs them
or, or, or even
tried to direct and they keep
state property
uh up to date,
but they
haven't done their part, they
haven't done their part and it's,
the lake has deteriorate. No,
not the lake but the
outhouses,
uh, there's, there's,
uh, uh, structurally,
uh, eroding.
Uh, what have you? The
outhouses are
putrid. It's
bad. They have not done
their fiduciary
duty of keeping up that
lake.
>> Yeah. Mr Chair actually
saw the pictures of the
bathroom and the, found, it looks like
one of the pillars that's out in the front is
rotting from underneath.
Ok. So
they,
they did, they quick
claim it over to you. Is that how that worked
out? And was there an agreement that, because I
think I saw that there's a quick
claim deed and
then there was a contract
of some sort.
Was it a written down contract that
they were going to maintain it and stock the
fish? >> That's
what we've been negotiating with them
because they're saying that
at time of, if
we have to do any kind of work
on the lake, they
wouldn't stock it,
but then we would have
to restock it in order to
keep it open since it's a public
lake, we would have to restock
it and that we wouldn't be
able to charge any kind of fees
even though we pay for
the fish to be stocked.
Uh, otherwise
they stock it for free.
Uh, but, uh, there's
just a lot of, uh,
rasm and Taz that's been
going on with game and fish
that seems like they just don't,
I don't know, they don't get it.
They just don't get it.
And, uh,
the, the commission
uh, previously wrote
a resolution
that gave us
the whole lake
at the beginning in 2017.
>> Ok. So Mr
Chair, my question
is,
does somebody have to have a fishing
license to fish in that
lake?
So it's not a privately
owned lake. Therefore,
fishing game has to maintain
it because if they're collecting that
stamp, that
stamp is for part of
stocking the lake and maintaining
the lake. So that
alone should be enough
for you to have standing
because it's not a private lake. If it's a
private lake, then you would put a big
sign, private lake and stock with big
giant fish and charge people
from California and Texas
$500 to go fishing for
the day and then you keep the
money, but that's not the case.
So they are supposed to,
they are bound to take care of
it. So then the issue becomes,
should we, I mean, other
than writing a letter,
Mr, is there anything else that we do? Like,
hey, game and fish?
Clean up the
porta potty, at least. Jeez, it's
horrible. Uh You know, do what
you're supposed to do. What can we do at this point?
I guess it's my question for
you,
>> you know, excuse >> me,
uh, the
structures
on this lake,
uh, they are
still, they
can get fixed,
they're not
completely
that bad gone. But
if they keep on leaving
them the way they are
without no attention,
they will be destroyed.
They'll have to get
removed
>> another question. So who is, who's
cleaning out the porta
potties
>> and
>> the,
but that all summer
long they, no
tissue? No,
it's, I go
to Colorado fishing.
You should see that.
There are
people, they have
time for them
have time to say they don't
have time for it and they
don't hire people in the summertime.
They don't hire kids to
help them up even if you don't
hire kids. So I don't blame those
people.
They,
it's, I don't know,
>> it's a
representative
since we don't
have a quorum, we can't take an
action for a joint letter,
but the vice chair
and I can have a letter drafted
that will be sent and say we
do have the support
of a majority of the
committee and we'll
sign our names on to that
letter asking that action be
taken immediately.
And we'll have,
um, that letter
will also be sent to all of you as
carbon copy and you can
piggyback and say you
agree, but we'll, since we
don't have a quorum, we can't vote on getting
that letter out from the entire
committee. >> Yeah,
thank you. M I think this is something
that we should do, think
of doing immediately and then think of
the long term things
if anybody has.
Um,
because
all I'm trying to do is figure out a little
way to put a little pressure on them
you know, so right now to get the ball
rolling,
um,
also we need to look
at
my, my
question to you is,
is there
a legally bound
contract without there being a
contract? Just because of the fact
that there, you have to have a fishing
license?
Ok.
I we'll look into that because I, I'm
very curious myself because
it should be, if you're getting a
fishing license and that would, that money
goes to, then there
should be some sort of
standing or something that's
in their own bylaws that
says that they will maintain
the water and
the property and the porta
potty and all that stuff. But I
just,
the things I learned in New Mexico
are amazing. Thank you. That's all the
questions I had >> Mr
Chair, uh uh
Representative Lord,
uh I spoke with
Melvin and I, my vice
president May had
a tour day before
yesterday and I took
all the pictures that I showed
you. And, uh I
met up, I heard some voices
and I saw a game and fish
truck on, parked on the other
side. So I
walked over, Melvin couldn't do
it because of the weeds and it's hard for
him to walk there. He's handicapped
as well. So
I met with one of the
supervisors, they were on
the other side and I talked to them about
the issues and he
says, yeah, we haven't gotten
to the septic tanks.
I mean, uh cleaning
them out but we'll do
it and,
uh, they've told us that
before and they haven't done
it, they just
haven't done it. It took me
three
hours.
Thank you, Mr Chair,
vice chair
and members of the
commission. Now,
>> before you walk away, Mark
Edwards does have a couple of questions
as well if you don't mind. And then
Representative
Garcia,
>> thank you, Mr
Chair,
Representative Lord brought up
a number
of the questions
that I was going to
ask myself.
Um So
the quick coming deed went
through, you actually own
the lake itself at this
point or not. >> No,
we don't.
We own well.
Well, what we own
is what the, the commission
gave us through the resolution.
There's no deed. Every
time they send me a deed,
it's, it's not for what
we agreed that was going to be
on the deed and
I don't sign them >> because
the property has not transferred
to you yet, >> only through
the through the,
the, the resolution
that was transferred to us. But
Gaiman Fish itself has
not given
us a deed that we agree
on because they keep going,
changing the wording in
the deed,
>> ok?
Um
It strikes me that part of the
problem is that Gai
and Fish doesn't get
money from the general fund.
So the legislature
has less leverage over
them because their
budget is all from those
permits.
So, if they're
not going to own it, if they don't
feel like they own it, they don't
want to use their budget
for it and
you don't want to take it until they
fixed it up. Is
that the, am I
correct in, in
how that's framed
Mr Chair?
>> Ok,
Mr
Chair
and members of the
committee,
it's a liability
if we go on there and
it's not ours.
We, if something
happens, getting bit by a
rattlesnake or falling down
on the rocks or where the
dyke is where there's big cement
blocks where the rebars
sticking out and one of us falls
in, not only one of us but
the general public that goes
there. If somebody gets injured,
then who's going to be responsible
for that. And we don't want to do
anything because we're not
covered. So,
>> so, so the original
resolution was
approval by
the legislature
for the
gai and Fish
to do the transfer
that it wanted to do.
That was what the resolution
we, the
legislature ratified.
What it thought was a
decision by the Game and
Fish Department to transfer
the property to you.
It wasn't a bill requiring
them to turn it over. It
was the process
is they ratify that
decision.
So what it
sounds like is this properties
for the last seven years has
been in this limbo
of, it's not
really owned by you,
so you can't claim it and
do stuff with it that needs
to be done. And yet
they feel like it's kind of
in the transition
out. So they're not putting
any operational
money to it.
So the question
is if
they just, is there
any way that you would
take the property
and take ownership and
claim it, what would,
what would be
needed for you
to own this property?
Because that was the original
uh
Mr Chair. I'm trying to figure
out
the original intent
of the resolution was to
facilitate a transfer
of the property
to the land grant and the
land grant was going to,
it was going to become the fishing pond
of the land grant
and it's just kind
of sat there not
doing either and it's
falling apart. So
the question is, how do we make
that happen or do you even want
that at >> that Mr
Chair,
Mr Edwards?
It has to be done through
a deed, a quick
claim deed and
that's where the issue is.
They keep changing the wording
on that quick claim deed
when we have
numerous meetings with them
and, and work out the
details on what the deed
should say.
And this is the
final
uh
request. This
is the final document that we're
gonna submit to them
to
make this deed
so that we can sign it and take
care of it. Now, >> Steve, we have an
Norteno in here who's on
that state commission. Have you
collaborated with TJ to
see how TJ can
get help for
us and can
champion
the transfer >> over?
Well, Mr
Chair, to tell you
the truth,
we
helped him get into the
commission to help the land
grant with this issue
and other issues.
It hasn't been done.
I hate to say
that when we were negotiating
the water rights,
there was 10 CFS
that was supposed to be
included with the lake.
We negotiated with
them. We said seven
CFS is
what we agreed the board agreed
on, but we will not
go any lower than
five at
that time. The
commission said, ok, we'll go with
five. But
unfortunately,
Mr uh
Lopez
said he did not
agree on the five.
He would go for the four.
So he hasn't really helped
us.
I hate to say that, but that's
the truth.
I wished that
he would have helped us
more to help,
to get all of the water rights
and to push the game and
fish to help
us do
what we need to do.
But he, it,
it, it's something
that he hasn't
communicated with us.
Uh We tried
to communicate on
certain issues
and uh it just
hasn't worked that way.
I hate to say that, but it's the
truth
>> representative. >> It's,
it's, it is in
limbo. That's the
problem. What
would, what would the quick claim deed have
to say to you to get you to sign
it
today.
>> Mr Chair
Representative Lord,
it's on that document that
I said that is the request.
Yes, that is the
final request that we're
asking them to
end this
issue,
>> ok? And their reply and so
you've sent it certified mail,
so you sent
certified mail, you've done all the
things you do. And the reply
is >> we haven't had a
reply,
>> ok? That makes it a little bit
more complicated mister because
it's, it's, there's
this resolution that says,
ok, you get it
and then there's a deed that's never
been done. So it is in
limbo. So nobody is gonna
take care of it is what I'm looking
at until there's
some resolution. But even
even if it does get transferred
over to you, how would we make
sure that it's because
it's,
it's not really private. It's part
of the land grant,
correct? So it's
part of the communal property
of the land grant,
but the game and fish would still
be required to maintain it.
It's just a matter of >> no,
no, no, no, they won't maintain
it. We maintain. So >> you, so
you're gonna maintain it. >> They
stock the fish
and that remains >> public
but they, so you, you're
gonna maintain the grounds,
they're gonna stock the
fish
and they're, they're going
to pay a license. So you guys get
no monetary benefit
from, ok,
I think that's,
but it still goes back to Mr Chair
that this, why are
they not signing the
claim? Because there's got to be a
lawyer somewhere involved somewhere who's
looking at this and say no, there should be
some response. So
maybe the letter should be something of forced
response other than
it up. I I don't know that
one, >> Mr
Chair
representative Lord
uh legal aides Dennis
David Benavides has
been helping us all
along. So has
the new Mexico Council
with Arturo
Art. They have
been uh help us
all along. Uh
So, um
they would
be um
they cited that in
order for us to, to get
any kind of revenue,
it was charged a
fee, parking fee.
Uh and that would go
to
infrastructure. It's
not for anything else but
infrastructure,
uh trash,
pickup, maintenance of
weeds, etcetera.
But that's the only revenues that
we would be able to collect. And they
told us that we, they
will not help us in any
way with any kind of money.
And, >> and I, I think it's still
Mr She goes back to
you guys need to
come to a conclusion on
this. I think it's more
maybe what the letter needs to
state, maybe you should clean
it up. So it's still kind of yours
technically and you need
to
resolve this or send, have a
letter or you guys send us uh
what you're gonna do within 30
days or whatever. I, I
don't, that's all I could think
of >> and I, I think you're absolutely
right, representative, we've been going
around and around them since
2017
and something needs to happen
to resolve it.
Representative
Garcia
>> and Mr
Chair.
And,
you know,
um
this has been problematic in
many ways,
it wasn't
problematic, Mister
chair.
Um, you know, the Game
and Fish Commission
um
was very
um
amenable
back in 2017
to do the transfer.
Um
They kind of fast tracked
it, you know, we
went to that meeting in Albuquerque
before the commission
to basically make the request
that we, the Terra
Maria land grant would
like to uh
assume possession
of the lake so that we can
save it
from uh you guys
breaching the dam and
basically discontinuing
this uh
a recreational
activity.
And uh the thing
is Mr Chair that
uh this Laguna
del Campo
is a destination
site
for many New Mexico
residents from Southern
Colorado all the
way to Southern New
Mexico.
And it's
multigenerational
and people have been fishing at this
lake from throughout this
area. Um
And
it's become a tradition with many
families that this
is where we take our kids, this is where
we take our grandkids,
you know, and we enjoy the scenery
and we enjoy the sights and
we enjoy the people of the Tierra
Maria,
you know, and that's what the Terra
Maria Landgren
offered
the game and
fish
that they would continue
that tradition of
making this a hardy
lake, a
viable lake,
you know, a lake that
will continue in the generations
to come.
And it would be a
meaningful lake
and respectful, you know,
people's values
and uh respectful
of uh
of this lake,
right in the heart of the Terra Maria
Landre.
And
things started to change
when uh Governor
Michel hungers took
office
and things started to change in
terms of the vision
with the directorship of
Mike Sloan.
And from the very beginning,
there was politics
involved
because one of the key
opponents
to
the land grant to the gaming
fish moving forward
uh with
the
transferring
with the completion of the
deed
was an individual
that has a lot of
political influence up
in, in the
Chama area, Tero Maria area,
who is an ardent
supporter of Governor
Michel Lojas.
And he was raising issues in
terms of the Asela,
in terms of the
CFS
that, that the
Maria felt was needed to kind
of maintain
the subsistence in the
survival of the lake in terms
of it being a hearty and healthy
lake. And
what game officials were posing
was just the
opposite in
terms of what they were requesting was
the basic deterioration,
further deterioration
of the lake.
And uh and I think that
played a lot
at the beginning
and as the years went by, I
had a, a
feeling uh Mr
Chairman that
maybe I should file an
ethics complaint
against Director
Sloan
because of this
past work experience,
professional experience that he
had with this
political
uh individual
in Terra Maria.
That was a cause for
basically stymie
stifling.
Uh the movement
forward on
the, the Laguna
Del Campo,
but it's not just a matter the
legislature did their
due diligence.
Anytime a state agency
transfers property to
another agency or to
private ownership
or public ownership,
we do a resolution
and it passed unanimously
and then the
nuts and bolts started
to unfold
in terms of
let's do the deed.
Well, game and fish
was not,
was not really willing to
do an open
and above board deed
they put in a
lot of
conditions.
And that's where the problem
lies
in those conditions.
And that's where we're at
today.
And those conditions came
about because of this political
influence
in, in in the
unfolding of
a final decision
regarding the
transfer.
And as to why
that's still happening
today is
mind boggling
because
the Tierra Maria will take
ownership of the lake
in terms of what they see fit
in terms of the CF
SS that will adequately
feed the lake,
you know, to a point where
it's not deteriorating
and where there isn't that loss
of enjoyment
for the lake
and for those late
Goers
and Fisher
people.
And um,
but most important
madam chair
is
that the Terra Maria is
willing to step up.
And from the very beginning, they
lined up legislators
to provide
capital outlay
and they had
estimates
and they had an idea as
to how that capital they will
unfold.
But that's
not happening mainly because
the game of fish is still
adamant on
having it their way,
you know, and
uh and no other
way.
And um
so I don't, I
don't, you know, I'm
frustrated
because the Thera Marias have
acted in good faith.
Uh But it's the
commission and the
director that
have basically
a different vision
in a different way forward
and that is status
quo,
you know, and to help with the
people that you Maria,
you know, and to hell with the future
generations,
you know, and, uh, let
them fish in
that pig
hole, you
know, with, with those bathrooms
kind of overflowing with
sewage and weeds all
over the place to where you can't
even walk, you
know, and ramps that are not
ramps, you
know, and no accessibility
whatsoever for the handicap,
you know, I mean, hell,
those handicapped veterans, they
can go somewhere
else.
That's the mentality that we're
dealing with when it comes to the
game and fish,
they just don't give a
damn,
you know. And
so I don't see
how this
thing is gonna move forward
short of some legal
action,
you know, because
I think the game and fish is set
in their way,
you know, they're already knee
high in
concrete,
you know, because every time
there's a proposal that's
open and aboveboard,
they just keep sinking in that
concrete,
you know, in terms of the
response and
actually, you've seen what the response
has been madam chair, there's
no response,
you know. And, uh,
so,
you know, it's real frustrating, but I
think we have a very incompetent
director, a game and
fish.
It's real evident, real visible
in terms of legislation that we've
tried pursuing
in terms of creating a more
democratically
elected,
uh appointed uh
board of commissioners
that is accountable to the
people of taxpayers saving in
Mexico
that is not accountable
uh to
uh one person,
you know, that is not
basically accountable
to individuals in management
positions in the gaming fish
that basically
there is no room for
negotiation,
you know, and,
uh, and that's why a game and
fish finds themselves where they're
at. You know,
they have very little credibility
with the state legislature,
mainly because of the record
and their persistence
and being
irrelevant.
And
so,
you know, I mean, it's good that we're putting
out a letter madam
chair, you know,
and kind of keeping that issue
um
in the front burner.
But, uh, I think
it's gonna take more than this, the
letter
and a
uh, and I'm
still,
you know, uh wavering
in terms of filing that ethics
complaint against Mike
Sloan
because I think that's
might be
the,
you know, the turning point
to this whole process
in terms of really coming
down and
giving the
Terra Maria land grant
that respect that
credibility, you
know, and that authority
as a political subdivision
to move forward
and making that destination
site a
jewel
of Rio Riva County
of the Terra Maria land grant
of the State of New
Mexico
Gracias,
>> representante Garcia.
Thank you chair.
I just wanted to
know that if, if the
member of the Game Commission
is still here, I
would like to know if
he has reviewed that
letter since I sent
it off in July
1st. If they
have had any discussion on
it, I think if we
had an update on it, it would
be very helpful. >> So what
we're going to do because it's not on the
agenda and there's 10 minutes left if
you can have a conversation
offline and we didn't
prepare him with an agenda
item, but you can speak to him
offline because I still
need to get to public
comment. >> Thank
you, Mr chair members of the
committee. >> Thank
you.
Now, I'm gonna move on to
public comment. And
so I think people might have signed
in thinking it was a sign in
sheet. And so
I'm gonna just call out names.
If you're here, come up to the
microphone and
let's hear from you.
So first Jose
Archuleta,
any comment, any further
comment?
>> Iii
I, I, I happened
to be to go to, I happened
to go to
when I got
17 years old. I, I
was gonna go and, and
be a mechanic and a
carpenter. But
I've been involved. I used
to see uh
when Pueblo
Lacee,
I was 15 and
I was paying attention,
paying attention. So when
I went there to, to study as a
mechanic and study
as a carpenter,
Guina,
uh I said this is not,
this is not
me.
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm in the history
of the Tierra Mayar land grant
tried to preserve and learn
more about the ancestor
involved in the T I was 15 years
old. So this, this is
not for me.
So that got 50 years ago.
I got involved in it in the
land grants and everything. At
the present time, I've been for 50
years and, and I've
been helping my community.
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm in
the board of the, of the
ambulances. We started
Laina 50 years ago,
Mr Jaramillo. Thank you for helping with the
ambulance and, and the
money. Uh I, I'm
with a senior citizen. I'm a vice
chair, I'm with the Water
Association. I'm with Renado
Valle and because
people don't want to get involved.

And so we have no public comment, but
I want to make just one last comment
is my intern is
Dominic Sandoval
who helped me when I first
ran for commissioner. He was
in sixth grade and he
decided he would go to do to
ask his neighbors to
vote for me as his
commissioner. And when
I decided to run for Senate
during the pandemic,
he knew all about technology
and what he did is he
jumped online and made
phone calls to ask people to
vote and he has dreams
of replacing me as a
senator. And so he
also has bigger dreams
of becoming president of the United
States. He'll be entering
his sophomore year at Brown
University and Dominic
I just wanted publicly on
record for everyone to know
how proud I am of you. I'm
excited of what the future
holds for you. And so
Brown University actually
pays him to be my intern
during the summer.
And so Dominic I
appreciate
you,
>> Mr Chair. Um We
also would like for Dominic
to replace
you.
>> I'll work as a campaign
manager for that time is
right. But we're gonna
take a short break after
an inter, I mean, after some
comments remark and then we're gonna go
cruising and so
all of you, I hope are gonna be
joining us. The Lowriders
are lined up outside and
so the staff is welcome
to join as well. And anybody
in the audience, you can jump in a low

a of the beautiful Espanola
Veli.
>> Thank you, Mr. Thank you, Mr,

committee, the
