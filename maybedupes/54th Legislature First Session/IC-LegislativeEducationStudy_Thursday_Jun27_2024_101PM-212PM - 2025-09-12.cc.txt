All right folks,
I hope you had a nice lunch.
We'll come back to
our next presentation under
Tab nine. So
school safety. So we
have four
of our policy analysts
working on this. So
um whomever may be starting
off?
All
right,
it will be the red light,
the person and then the red
light should come
on.
>> All right, this one's working. >> All
right.
>> Ok,
Mr, chair members of the
committee. Good afternoon
and thank you for the opportunity to discuss such
an important topic with all of
you. My name is Connor L
Hicks. I'm a policy analyst for
all of you and join me on this
panel today are Merit C
Andrews senior policy
analyst, Mark a Montoya,
senior policy analyst and Natasha
Davalos policy
analyst. And so
today's presentation and
accompanying report that you'll find as
the chair said behind Tab
nine is a
first installment of a
two part LES C study
of school safety, both here in New
Mexico and across the United
States in
November. We'll again present to the
committee and offer policy and
budgetary recommendations to
support school safety efforts. While
this one, well, this part of the report
will focus mostly on a landscape
analysis of existing
practices and trends we see
both here in our state and across the
country. And so
before I get started, I'd also like to
offer a quick thank you to a couple of folks
that have been very helpful as we've done this
work. I'd like to thank the Albuquerque
Public Schools Police Department
for their provision of data regarding
shelter and place incidents and
firearms. I'd
like to thank Penasco independent school
district for their providing of
data for restorative
justice work and pe D for
disciplinary data as well.
And palms and associates for
facilitating a lot of our work
together
for students to thrive academically
and socially. It is vital. The
learning and environment is safe,
inclusive and supportive.
And as a concept, school safety
can be best understood
as encompassing three
dimensions,
prevention response and
recovery. And all of these play
a part in a holistic approach
to this effort. Now,
over the course of this presentation,
we are providing an overview
of this landscape that we see
in school safety here in our state
and across the United States
through the lens of two overarching
themes, preventative
efforts and physical
safety.
But before we dive into that
discussion, which will comprise the majority
of our report, I would
like to provide a quick review
of national trends that we're seeing
in school safety and student
needs.
The first I'd like to start off with
is student mental health. Uh
As I'm sure all of you
are aware, student mental health is
a key contributor
to student's academic
success
across the United States. We have seen
a growing number of Children between
ages three and 17
experience anxiety or
depression and from
2016 to 2020
that percentage of Children with anxiety,
depression has increased by
3% points from 9
to 12%.
This has especially been
significant in the wake of the
COVID-19 pandemic which will
again, not be surprising to anyone
here. I imagine since
the onset of the pandemic and the
subsequent school closures,
70% of us
public schools report an increase
in students seeking out mental health
supports.
However, as that that
need has increased, we
do hear that less than half of
public schools are
confident that their,
that their schools will be effective
in providing those services to
their students. Raising serious
doubts about the capacity of our
school system currently
to provide the support our students
need.
Turning now to behavior and
safety. I do
want to talk about the fact that
educators across the country,
as many folks here have said
as well. We've
seen increased behavioral challenges
in our classrooms and in our schools
since the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic, the
learn disruptions brought about by
COVID and according to educators
survey by EAB
have resulted in delayed social
development for students in the areas
of self-regulation and relationship
building. And as we all know
school is not just a
place where we learn about math
and science and reading and writing.
It is also a place where we
learn how to interact with one another,
treat each other with respect and honor
each other. And so
this the the impact
the pandemic has
reverberations throughout their
educational experience and their
life beyond the
classroom.
At the same time, we're also seeing
that physical violence in schools,
both against fellow students
and against teachers
has risen considerably nationwide
since 2018.
In the five year period between
2018 and
2022 the
percentage of educators who observed
physical violence between students
or against teachers effectively
doubled.
Now, when we talk about
behavioral issues and
school safety in general,
uh we often think
of physical security
measures. And so this next
part, I'd like to talk about what
we call hardening of schools
and it's often brought up on
the heels of school shootings
or other tragedies that
happen.
Now, along with these national trends,
com this common effort
uh manifests itself in the
in target heartening which includes
metal detectors, security
cameras on site,
armed security personnel,
whether it be school resource
officers or non
law enforcement, security
personnel.
However, despite the
investments we've made both here
in New Mexico and across the country
on that front. A broad
body of research concludes
that these efforts on
their own, have minimal effectiveness
in reducing the threats
that schools face.
Additionally measures like student
resource officers and metal
detectors have a disproportionate
impact on students of
color with discipline
rates in schools uh being with
discipline rate increases
related to SR Os being
higher for black students in a
study from the University of Texas
at Austin and national
data showing that metal detectors are
more prevalent in schools with higher
percentages of minority
students.
The report does a deeper
dive on the impact of
various physical security
measures. Uh So II I
encourage you to review
those but at a very high level
you'll see here. Uh
I've from the
National Center for School Safety.
They have this uh graph,
this chart here that does a good
overview of the different of the
research bases. We
find for various
measures to improve school
safety. Uh The ones I've
highlighted those three are all
typical examples of quote-unquote
hardening measures.
And you'll notice that all of those
fall either into the developing
evidence-based category
or the little too mixed
evidence category.
So just I, I wanted
to put that as a to really illustrate
that
while we have done a lot of
efforts on this front,
that the research base is
not necessarily there to support
continued investment in that
regard.
However, you may be asking
yourselves. And I've certainly asked myself
this question many times through the
the work of this report.
If on their own,
these measures aren't going to be enough.
Then what is?
And an example
of a holistic school safety
approach is a systems
based approach as outlined in a
2021 rand corporation
report. And this
multi-layered effort combines
three dimensions of security, the
prevention efforts that identify and
respond to risks at early
stages. So I think threat
assessment groups, mental health
supports those sorts of
things, protection and
mitigation measures to detect and
lessen the impact of a threat. That's
where we get to the security measures, metal
detectors, security cameras,
security personnel,
and then response and recovery procedures
to return the school to normal
operations and address
consequences of an incident
that can include emergency medical
services and first responders. It
includes mental health supports again
as well as the process by
which schools and emergency
responders reunite
families with their students in the
aftermath of an
event.
But just as important,
if not more important,
perhaps as
all of these measures and the
physical measures is the
school climate and culture that
we have in our
places.
It's an integral part of the school
safety landscape. And I don't
imagine that is a shock to anyone
here. Relationships
are a key component of
building the climate that
creates a warm, welcoming
and inclusive place for schools
and for students,
research has demonstrated
repeatedly that teachers
that strong relationships with
teachers lead to positive,
greater lead to positive benefits
across the board for students, whether
that be greater student
engagement, fewer
disruptive behaviors, improved
academic performance and
higher rates of attendance to
name just a few.
Additionally, it's
incredibly important as
part of building a culture,
especially in the state as diverse as
New Mexico to ensure
that we are addressing culturally
and linguistically responsive
education practices.
These help improve school safety
by acknowledging and valuing the
diversity that is inherent
in our student bodies and
promotes understanding and reduces,
reduces instances of
discrimination, bias and
bullying.
And with that, that concludes
my section of the national
trends and I'll now hand it over
to Natasha who will
offer one more national trend
before diving more into
preventative
measures.
>> Good afternoon. Um I am
Natasha and I will be
going over um chronic
absenteeism, school discipline
and bullying and I will lay
down some information
that you guys heard yesterday.
Um So as mentioned in the
LES C report from November
of 2023 and the
LEFC report
presented yesterday, chronic
absenteeism plays a significant
factor in school safety.
Both reports identified
aversion to school as a
significant factor contributing
to chronic absenteeism,
students may develop these
behaviors due to
various barriers and challenges
to name. A few causes
may be due to trauma,
lack of health or
mental health care, poor
transportation and
other socioeconomic
factors. In New
Mexico, our state law
defines chronic absenteeism
as missing 10% or more
of classes or school
days equivalent to two days
per month or 18
days. In 100 8080
days school year, the national
chronic absence was
about 30% in the
2021 2022
school year for New
Mexico, that
absent chronic
absent rate decreased from
about 41% in
2021
2022 school year
to 39% in
2022 2023
school year. As you'll
read ear early on in the
school safety in New Mexico
and United States report
in 2001. The CDC
reported about 9% of
high school students
surveyed nationally
reported missing
out missing
school, out of the fear of
their safety in New
Mexico. The number of high
school students skipping school
due to safety concerns, more
than doubled from
2013 to
2021.
Ensuring students are
present and engaged in
school fosters a
safe and supportive learning
environment
on the next slide for
school discipline. Um I want to
talk about the dashboard. So
PE D currently tracks
disciplinary data from New
Mexico schools through the
Nova Data collection
system which was formerly
known as Stars.
Um Discipline data includes
information on student
infractions and the responses
by staff to address those
infractions. Pe D
is in the process of creating a student
discipline da dashboard
that will display student
disciplinary infraction
data starting with the 2014,
2015 school year
for all schools.
According to the preliminary data
currently available on the
dashboard in the
2022 23 school
year, 4.4%
of discipline responses
statewide use a restorative
justice approach.
Research supports the
implementation of restorative justice
practices as they reduce
violence at school.
These non exclusionary
disciplinary programs in schools
are innovative approaches
that focus on repairing harm,
fostering a sense of community
and promoting accountability
rather than relying solely
on punitive measures.
This practice involves
um open dialogue and
collaborative problem solving
among students, teachers and
other educational staff
to address conflicts and
misconduct
because the discipline dashboard is
still a work in progress
to provide a snapshot of
discipline trends in New Mexico
and highlight restorative work
currently in place.
Les D uh les
C staff gathered data from
Penasco independent school
district which has implemented
restorative disciplinary practices
in recent years with
the help of Pals and
Associates
on slide 11. The graph
to the right shows the consequence.
Data, Penasco uh
Penasco middle school
and high school for the school years.
2022 and
2023 and 2023.
2024 school
year out
of school suspension was still
the most common measure
particularly in the
2223 school
year with 18 middle
school students and eight high
school students suspend has been
suspended
by the 2324 school
year. These numbers decreased to
nine students for middle school
and two students for high
school. With the
new restorative disciplinary practices
adopted by Penasco independent
school districts for the 2023
24 school year.
Alternative consequence
measures have served
13 middle school students,
specifically five
students use wellness
rooms and eight students
participated in
of practices. Whereas
no high school students are receiving
these intervention services.
I also want to note that in fiscal
year 2024 the legislature
appropriated
$200,000 to
fund a pe
DL pilot program
for Wellness Rooms in
public and charter schools.
In fy 25 the
legislature continued to fund Wellness
Rooms with an appropriation of
$200,000.
On the next slide, I talk about
bullying and
bullying can significantly impact a
person's overall well being.
So what is bullying?
Well, bullying
can take many forms including verbal
harassment, rumor spreading
and intentional in
exclusion.
Not forgetting to mention cyberbullying
which involves online
harassment, often
anonymous, leading to public
shame and humiliation
at the hands of strangers.
Both bullying and
cyberbullying pose
significant challenges in
educational settings.
In 2021 the New Mexico's
Children cabinet reported on
bulling data comparing trends from
2019 to 2021.
Bullying rates decreased
on public school property with
42% of middle school
students and 14% of high
school students reporting
incidents in
2021 which is
down 7% and
22% from
2019.
However, cyberbullying
significantly increases among
middle school students with
27% reporting
incidents in
2021. A
37% increase from
2019. In
contrast, cyberbullying among high
school students decreased to
13%. A
6% drop from
2019.
New Mexico has taken preventative
steps to ensure school safety.
For instance, as you are all
familiar with. In
2019, the New Mexico
legislature took a significant
step toward ensuring student
safety by enacting the
safe schools for all
students act. This
legislation requires school districts
to develop and implement
comprehensive bullying prevention
policies which must
include clear
definitions of bullying and
cyberbullying, effective
reporting and investigating
protocols,
consequences that focus on
restorative practices rather than
suspension or expulsion
and annual training for students
and staff, meticulous
documentation and re
recordkeeping for a minimum
of four years. The
ultimate goal is to create a safe
and supportive learning environment
free from bullying and
cyberbullying where students
can thrive and reach their full
potential. Thank
you and I'll pass it on to my next
merit.
>> Thank you, Natasha.
As Connor mentioned earlier,
mental health is an important
component of overall
health and wellness. And
according to the Federal Centers
for Disease Control and prevention,
Children who are mentally
healthy, have improved quality
of life can function
better at home
in the in school
and in their communities and
are better able to cope with
challenges.
Data shows you suicide
and suicidal behavior
is increasing in New Mexico
and the United States
pointing to a need to
bolster resources
to support student mental
health.
As illustrated by the graph on
this slide, youth
suicide attempts in New Mexico
have consistently outpaced
the nation even
before the COVID-19
pandemic.
In 2019, New
Mexico's suicide attempt
rate among students in grades
nine through 12 was
10.5%.
Compared to the national
rate of
8.9%.
The prevalence of suicide
and suicide prevention
programs or the
prevalence of suicide and suicide
related behaviors can be
reduced through comprehensive
suicide prevention programs and
policies, providing
services to high-risk
youth and supporting
youth who have lost a loved
one.
School based suicide
prevention efforts should
begin with strategic planning
that assesses local
context and availability
of resources.
Strategic planning can
help schools determine which
student populations to focus
on. Identify
programs and policies
that will be effective in
preventing suicide
and prioritize efforts to
achieve maximum
impact
in New Mexico. Safe
school plans must
include recommended
procedures for supporting a
potentially suicidal
students as well as a
referral network for suicide
assessment and intervention.
Schoolss could and
possibly should
use a strategic planning
approach to youth suicide
prevention as part of
already required school safety
work.
Moving to the next slide,
New Mexico uses the
youth risk and resiliency
survey, otherwise known
as NM years
to assess the health risk
behaviors and
resiliency of New
Mexico secondary students
through survey administered
to a selection of schools
in all school
districts.
Topic areas for
NM years include
risk behaviors related
to suicide ideation
and attempts, alcohol
and drug use,
unintentional injury,
violence, tobacco
use sexual activity,
physical activity and
nutrition,
resiliency factors
that are tracked um
include relationships in the
family, school
community and with
peers as well as
health status such as
body weight and
asthma.
The Department of Health which
administers NME
recently released
new data from
2021 including
a fact sheet that highlighted
comparisons between students
in New Mexico in high school
and students across the country
according to the Department of
Health. And unfortunately,
as Natasha mentioned earlier,
New Mexico High School students were
more likely to skip
school due to safety
concerns and were
more likely to experience
frequent mental distress
and were more likely to not be
physically active in the last
seven days.
However, data also
revealed some encouraging trends
in other areas. So
as illustrated by the graph on this
slide, I
important risk factors
including violence and the
use of alcohol, tobacco and
other drugs decreased
over the last 10 years.
However, it's important
to note that current e
cigarette use also
known as vaping
decreased from a high of
33% of
students in 2019
but still remained at
25% of
students in 2021.
So one in four
students,
now turn it back to
Connor.
>> Thank you, married.
And so that concludes our section
on preventative efforts.
And now I'd like to turn to a
discussion, uh consisting
of testimony for myself
and mark on physical
safety. And starting off,
I'd like to talk about an issue that I
think, uh, has
been in the news far too often in
recent years,
uh the firearms on school
grounds and school shootings.
And now as we're all aware,
uh these discussions about
school safety often come on the
heels of these events,
these tragic events that rip a hole
in communities and exact a heavy
toll on the impacted school
community and leave educators,
parents and students alike
fearful of a shooting happening
at their school.
I think survey data going
back several years has found
majorities of students, parents
and teachers are all at least somewhat
concerned about a school shooting,
impacting them
as these levels of fears
persist. However, we're also
finding that one in four
teachers report experiencing gun
related lockdowns on their
campus.
This graph that you'll
see on this slide here
is a plot
of all school shootings according
to the K 12 school shooting
database between
1999 and
2023
nationwide. I
selected 1993
1999 rather, even
though the database goes all the way
back to 1966
because 1999 as I'm
sure you're aware was the year of the
Columbine High school massacre,
which was really an inflection point
in school safety discussions in
the United States.
As you can see the trend
here has been relatively
flat in both incident
victims and deaths from
1999 until about
2017.
Uh, once we hit 2017,
we see a nearly
500%
increase in school
shooting incidents between
those between
2017 and
2023.
And well, that is certainly
an alarming trend line and one
that needs to be taken
seriously. I do
want to point out however,
that on this next slide, you'll
see that it's important to note that data
surrounding firearms
and other weapons being carried
in New Mexico schools and
schools nationwide is
more encouraging.
Uh while New Mexico does
remain above the national
average in the percentage
of students carrying weapons on
campus, both the
states and the nation in general
are seeing overall
declines in this percentage.
There has been a slight uptick in
the aftermath of the pandemic,
but overall the trend is still
down
pe D discipline data.
However, uh from the dashboard
that Natasha mentioned earlier,
uh finds that in
2021 and to
2022 and in
2022 23
both those school years saw
firearms and fractions
reported in the high double digits
with 7078
firearm and fractions reported
respectively.
Moving on now, I'd like to discuss
school lockdowns. Uh
and just
to recap, a school lockdown
refers to an effort by a school to
protect their internal community
and from a threat by closing
off entry to school
buildings and instructing students
and staff to shelter in
place. Uh
to highlight how a
district tracks these incidents.
Uh We worked with Albuquerque
public Schools Police Department
for data going back several years
back to July 2021
to highlight the shelter in place
incidents that have occurred
in those years. Now, I'd
like to note that uh
I've at the top of
this section, I said lockdowns
and then I started talking about shel place.
That's because aps no longer
uses lockdown terminology.
The most analogous
thing to a lockdown
is a shelter in place
incident where there is not an
immediate threat to the school, but
there is a perceived one. So they
put the school into a shelter in
place. Whereas
if there is an immediate
threat, they do what is
called an outhouse
protocol.
And as you'll see on this chart
here, there have been
186 shelter
in place incidents since
July 2021
and I do also want to note,
uh, we do see a ver a
pretty low number in this most
recent year in
2024. Uh
but at the same time
that does end in May. So
there were still several weeks of the school
year to go after
that
and now I'll turn it over to mark
to discuss some of the investments New
Mexico has made in physical
security
efforts.
>> All right. thank
you, Connor. Uh Mr chair members of the
committee. Uh From my discussion, I'll be
focusing on statewide
initiatives that have been funded
by State New Mexico
since Fy 21.
What I'll be doing is I'll be providing a
brief summary and a
brief explanation of what the funds are
used for. So we'll start
with school panic buttons
between Fy 21
and Fy 25. Approximately
$5.6 million
was allocated for school
panic buttons. Uh This
specific item, I'm gonna be diving into
a little bit deeper in the report. So I'll
say that for a little bit later.
Um school bus cameras,
approximately $1.4
million allocated for school
bus cameras. Um
The idea behind school bus
cameras is to
deter uh
bullying, disruptive
behavior and other dangerous
activity on a bus that could,
you know, cause an
accident. Also,
footage from those cameras can
be used to later assess and mitigate
future risks. Uh The
next item. Uh Oh,
sorry. I want to give
you a little bit context of the cost of school bus
cameras. So each school
bus camera cost
$2500.
There are 2000 school
buses throughout the state.
Um
560
of those school buses have been equipped
with school bus cameras. So to equip the
rest of the remaining school buses,
we're looking around $3.6
million.
Safe school summits.
Approximately $400,000
has been appropriated for
school safety summits. There was
200,000 appropriate for Fy
24. Another
2000 appropriate for fy
25. The first
inaugural summit was in November
of 23 and the
focus of the summit was to
provide les with
training technical
assistance and developing
and implementing effective
emergency operation plans.
It also put them in front of
subject matter experts
and solutions that they could use in
schools to mitigate
health safety
concerns. House
Bill 505. During
the 2023 legislative session,
$35 million was
allocated for
school districts to
improve their security
infrastructure. This
allocation was for fy 24
and subsequent years. Uh
items that were
um paid for with
this allocation included
access control system,
wearable crisis devices,
consultation services and
I have some more examples on page
16 for your
review,
moving on to
school security awards
um in response to the fatal
shooting at the
Aztec
and my time is up just
kidding. Um
In response to the fatal
Aztec shooting in 2020
2017 $10
million was set aside annually from
Fy 19 to Fy
22 for
security improvements
throughout my school schools.
Um However,
um there was no interest
or activity participation
in this program which was facilitated
by PSA or the
public um
public school Finance
authority, sorry, facilities.
I came from NM FA so I keep on
doing that. Um
So they were in charge of that
but there was no uh participation
and the reasons for that are believed to
be that the
process of
the award
um
processes by the,
the PFS A uh
were very lengthy and
complicated and
also this was based on their state
and local match. However,
districts still continue
to request um
access to accessible and
flexible funding for security
measures um to
briefly move on to adequacy
standards. Um The
statewide adequacy centers
require minimal physical
security elements. The
topic of security is
mentioned twice in the
new eco administrative code.
The first one is a requirement
that school buildings must have in
working order, a two
way communication system
and a security system. This
I can mention is that
schools are required to have
safe and secure site,
fencing or other barriers
with accommodations for safe
passage. But
that's more focused on traffic
hazards, railroad tracks,
steep slopes, animal
nuisances and to
discourage unauthorized
access state
statute. Though uh does
state that the PSCOC
or the public school Capital Outlay
Committee? Um
in consultation with
PSCU if the task force
shall regularly review
and update statewide adequacy standards,
adequacy standards, uh,
applicable to all
districts, um,
additional funds. As you are. Well
aware, schools do
receive additional funds through
junior bills or direct um,
appropriations. Historically,
these appropriations have been used for
security and
safety
projects as well.
For instance, Senate Bill
275 of the
$46.5 million
allocated $7
million was authorized
for safety
projects.
And with that, I will move on
to safe school
plans.
The district Wellness policy
um does require that a
safe school plan or an
SSP be in
place for all public school buildings
throughout New Mexico. Uh
Pe D does
require that a school
which provides an updated
SSP every three
years for their approval and
those SS PSS have four
basic elements. Uh
The first is an introduction,
basic information about the school,
two school policies
and procedures, three
preventative measures and
lastly four a school
emergency operation plan or
also known as an EOP
pe D does provide
guidance to school districts in
creating an SSP. Um
This includes rubrics,
templates,
uh
training providers and
contract information for contact
information for other related
resources. Um How
are S SPS utilized
and how are they enforced?
Um pe D
requires school
districts to upload their
SS PS to their website.
It's a self reporting
mechanism. Um
They do follow up
on any schools that are not
up to date. With that. However,
enforcement measures are limited.
Um, they have shared that
they do send letters of non
compliance for any schools that are not in
compliance with this requirement.
Um Pe D's um
Health Healthy Schools
Bureau does,
um,
does not currently collect
any data on this other
than seeing if schools are
compliant and just verifying
some basic information that are included
in the SS PS.
However,
SS PS, the requirement
to provide those isn't
seen as an accountability measure.
It's seen more of a way
to provide an opportunity or a
mechanism for school districts to
sit down and discuss
the threats or dangers that are present
in their community and to
discuss ways to mitigate and
plan for those. So it's really to
provide a safe and healthy
school environment.
Um As promised,
I'm gonna dive a little bit more into panic
buttons and discuss
uh one of one specific technology that's
been used across the state.
So panic buttons are commonly
are common
technology aids in
schools
and slide. Thank you.
I did good for everybody else. I did good for
myself though.
Um, so
these panic
buttons are used in schools
and what they do is they're,
they're app based,
the one I have. But I know
I was speaking to one of our tsas
and they're telling us that they do a
wearable button
where you can report an incident.
But what these buttons or these
apps do is it provides
an easy way for
staff and administration
to report any incidents that
are occurring, whether it's
fire active
assailants, natural
disasters. And not only
are they able to quickly report that
information, but there's a lot of
information that's provided to
dispatchers as well as far as
location of the school.
Um where the
the report
occurs, they can kind of map out where
the incident is and
also they can
be provided with
information about the school.
Now, this is very important because
when a responder shows up to a
school, they might not know where the
cafeteria is the theater
and they kind of have to figure out when they get
there. However, by
setting up this program in
schools, schools can
outline and if you look on page
19, you'll see a
diagram of what's
called geo fencing. A school
can kind of outline where their school
is and kind of depict where the
buildings are that way. When a first responder
shows up, they know where
everything is and they can be more
effective um
to, to point
out why this is
important. I'm going to walk you through
pretty a pretty commonly
known chain of events.
Incident happens. The
victim would call into
911911.
You know, obviously, the reporter
probably pretty panicked and in a distressed
state, they're trying to get information
over that dispatcher is not
only trying to decide what's going on,
but send over responders
to the location with
this type of
app, they have a lot of
information ready so they can be talking
or they can be doing
multiple things simultaneously like
a addressing the
the situation and sending needed
medical law
enforcement or fire
um responses
to the responders to the
the scene
of the, of the the
events. Um
and just put time into
context. I looked
at, we looked at a joint study
with the FBI and Texas
State University. And what
they did is they analyzed 63 active
shooting events from 2000
to 2013
and they found that 44 or
69% of
those events ended in five minutes or
less and 23
ended in two minutes or less.
But even when uh responders
were on the scene or were able to get
there in a timely manner,
students and staff were forces
making life changing
decisions.
Um I
think um
what I'll go on to now is why
we chose rave panic
buttons to
highlight. um the reason
we chose that is because this is the most
widely used system across the
state. Um According
to information that was provided
as of May 24
May 2024
570 of the
800 schools in the state are
using this software.
244 schools are
reported that they're using other
software. Um And
83 are reported
that they have no system in
place. Um With
that, I'll pass this over to
Connor.
>> Thank you,
Mark.
So I know we've
just thrown a lot of information at
you uh spanning a
broad range of topics
all under the umbrella of school
safety, which I hope illustrates
just how multifaceted this
topic can be and
is.
But so we've talked a lot about
where we have been and
where we are. Um But
I imagine this also raises a lot of
questions about where we're going.
And so in this moment, I'd like to
take a moment to talk a
little bit about the next
steps for us, of the
staff as the committee
and also as a state.
So in the
aftermath of
whatever a tragedy may be
that impacts a school, there's
this
well intentioned rush
to do something.
You know, we want to safeguard students
and ensure that they're protected
from the dangers
of the broader world that
quite often are outside
the control of
schools.
But this well intentioned urge
frequently manifests itself
in efforts that rather
than supporting school
safety actually undermine
it. It reduces perceptions of
safety for students and makes them
feel ized
or victimized.
And so, while concrete
protection and mitigation efforts
are an important piece of this
puzzle,
policymakers and school
officials must exercise
caution in selecting which measures
to implement and understand
that on their own. They
will not be as effective as they
might otherwise be as part
of a broader systems based
approach. The hard
truth with this topic
is that there is no
way to eliminate all
threats that schools
face.
But there are concrete steps
that legislators that school
officials can
take and should
take to increase
and create secure,
inclusive and supportive
environments to propose both
student safety and
success.
And so. In the second installment
in November 2024
of our school safety report,
we'll use the lessons learned from
this landscape analysis
as well as broader research and
stakeholder engagement
to provide policy and budgetary
recommendations to lawmakers
to ensure that schools in every corner
of New Mexico have the resources
they need to create
welcoming, inclusive environments
that make students want to be
there and feel safe
and supported while
also ensuring that they have
the systems in place
to address threats should they
arise? And with
that, we will
stand for
questions.
>> All right. Thank you. All so much
questions,
folks.
Oh, so Senator
Brand,
>> thank you and I appreciate
the uh
information here.
Um
What do we see as we
have you looked at where
there have been school
shootings? Has,
has it mostly been
a student
uh or someone
that's not related to the school
at
all?
>> Mr Chair, Senator Brandt,
I can't speak specifically
to New Mexico data on that
or, but very
speaking very broadly about national
events, especially high profile
ones. I, I
don't think there is a clear
trend one way or the other.
There is not, it's
hard to identify one
specific reason for
why a school shooting happens.
Sometimes it is a student
and in the case of Columbine,
sometimes it is an
an outside individual such
as the case of Sandy Hook.
So there are plenty
of examples of either
>> and, and correct
me if I'm wrong. But the one in
New Mexico and Aztec
was a previous
student, I believe
that's correct. Yes. So there
was some connection there.
OK. So,
um and I
like the fact that you talked about there's no
silver bullet, you're not gonna be able
to fix this, uh,
you know, with just one
change.
Um, so I think
we, we see it from both sides.
You have the one where the,
the son
of a student came in.
Um, I, I
lost track of which ones go
with which ones. But,
um, so you,
you know, that was a connection
to the school. At least, I think the
one in, in Texas.
I'm not sure there was a connection
to the school there if it was just an
opportunity.
Um, it's,
it's very, so, so hardening
the facilities can
stop some of them.
Right.
But if it's
a student that's really hard
to stop.
Um, do we know with, with
the students when it's happened with
students?
Um,
has there been any research
done as
to
why they,
you know,
came in and did that?
Uh, do we
know of anything?
I mean, we hear a lot where people say
anecdotally it's bullying, it's
this, it's that. But do we have
any actual research that says it's
those things,
>> Mr Chair Senator Brandt, I,
I would say that.
Well, like
you said, the anecdotal evidence
is that what we hear that it's
students that reported being bullied
or feeling left
out or struggling
with mental health
uh
National research and the
broad body of research that exists on this
topic finds that there is no
one cause of school shootings.
Uh We can't point to a specific
reason saying, oh, it's mental health.
Oh, it's that they were bullied.
Uh So I don't think it's easy to
draw a clear line between
um the challenges a
student may face or an outside
individual may face. Uh
and the actions they
take.
>> I mean, I, I think
an argument could be made that
anyone that would go into a school and
shoot Children has some kind of mental
health issue. I
mean, that's again
anecdotally because we haven't seen that study.
But um
I think it would be hard pressed
to think that a normal
thinking person would ever
do that. So,
um I think that's, but
what, what caused that? Was it
an underlying problem? Was it,
you know, something that
was caused by bullying?
Um, the other issue on the
cyberbullying?
Um
How do we deal with
the,
if it's not happening
at school? So I'm, let's
say, you know, and I know kids
don't use Facebook anymore but I'm
old. So
I do, I don't what, I
don't know what kids use today
x whatever
Instagram, you
know, whichever one they're
using. But
um
if they're
bullying someone on
Facebook
just because that's what I
know.
Um but they're
doing it at home.
How does the school get
involved without violating their
first amendment
rights?
>> Chairman Romero. Um
Senator Brand. Thank you for your
question. Um Actually,
that's, well as you will see
in the report, I've also mentioned
that it's really hard to report on
those, especially when people
don't know that it's actually happening
or who is actually
being bullied by who.
Um So that's going to be a part of my
next step and um
coming up in our November report
to dive into that deeper so I
could have those answers to you a
little more clear
then
>> I know. I mean, this is nothing
new. I was, I left the
school board 12 years ago and we
were dealing with this cyberbullying
question even
then. So this
is, is not something that's changed.
And I think that was one of the big questions
for us as a school board is how do we
put in a policy
that
affects what they can do at
home
when we also have the
constitution that says you have
constitutional right to free
speech, whether
we like the speech or
not. And I
think that's where we have some, some
conflicts. Um,
the other issue that's come up
several times, uh
is the whole
counseling idea at
school.
Um What we call
counselors are not
counselors,
they're guidance,
they're curriculum guidance
counselors, they're
not mental health counselors.
So, um
have we looked at or are we
going to be looking at
uh what
is the best approach to deal with
getting mental health
assistance? Is it to have a
mental health counselor in the
district or is it to
refer out to
a mental health counselor within
the
community?
>> Thanks so much for this
question, Chairman and
Senator Brandt. So
going back a little bit into
Natasha's point about cyberbullying,
I just also wanted to stress
that behavioral health is really
important there. And
then continuing with your question on
counselors. That's something
we began to dive into in
this report. And one
thing we found that was very
interesting is that
we actually have a higher
ratio of counselors
to students, New Mexico
than the nationally recommended
average. We don't
have a great understanding of their
workload. And to your
point, if counselors are
actually attending to behavioral
health needs of students or
attending to um
behavioral health
duties as, as they should
be. So that's another
really important step for our
work to make sure that counselors
are able to attend to those needs
and that we have adequate staffing
and funding to support
that. >> It's, it's
one of the questions that we've had to come
up for several years
is the whole counseling
issue. Uh
I've brought it up several times.
Um, you know, my minors
in family
psychology and counseling.
So, but that's a totally
different thing than, than
your guidance counselors that we
talk about what class you're
gonna take. Um And
I hate that they're both called
counselors um
within our school system.
Um because there's no,
when we talk about
counselors in
this type of setting, we're
talking about mental health counselors
and it's illegal for a guidance
counselor
to
try to
cross over and give mental
health counseling because that's not what
their training is at all
unless they're actually certified
as a counselor,
um which takes a whole lot
more than my minor.
Um They, they've got to go
back, get their master's degree, then
do all the practical. It's almost
like becoming a, a
medical doctor
um to be able
to do that. And, and I don't think
we have a whole lot of those in our school
systems. I think we
need to
address that need
within our, our
schools and within our
Children.
Um, and I think
we as a legislature need to
figure out, you know, what's the best path
to do that? I think
it may depend on,
you know, the availability
in the community may be
what determines what's the
best path for
a school district. You know, but
one of the things we may need to look
at is for,
for families
who don't have the
means
or they don't have the
insurance that will cover the mental
health counseling for their Children.
You know, how do we make sure they get that
counseling? That may
be something we have to provide funds
for as, as a stop
gap
measure uh
for students that need
that because I think
we're seeing more and more and I
think, I think two
things COVID is
uh made the problem
worse, but it
also brought, brought a
problem that was already
existing to light
that we didn't see. So
I think it did both. I think it brought
it to light and I think it made it even
worse and I thought it
was interesting, the suicide numbers
stop it coded
um which we know in New
Mexico, we had a huge jump in
suicides uh with
Children uh during
the COVID
uh
lockdowns. So
thank you for the report.
I think it's very important.
This is the reason I stayed for
this afternoon instead of going
fishing. So,
um I appreciate
it. Thank
you.
>> Glad we could keep you in
attendance all right represent
baca >> thank you, Mr
Chairman.
And
in full disclosure, school
safety is one of my priorities. In
fact, we could talk about it for
eight hours and we'd only scratch the
surface but out of
respect for my colleagues in our
times, uh I'm gonna
be very kind of direct
and, and ask
questions. So please in your responses,
you know, don't feel you have to
um give
us a full, you know,
um these
long-winded answers.
So I will point you
Mr Chairman, you guys to some
districts because I, I'm very
active in school safety
at the state and national level.
I'm gonna tell you some school districts
that and it's again, it's not
a full in all inclusive
list but those that I know are
doing it well.
And that would be, of course,
Aztec
Rio Rancho
schools,
the Las Luna schools,
Belen and Artesia.
So if we're talking about
important, it's important to
know national trends.
But in New Mexico, I want to know it's
what school safety looks
like and how we
have. Uh
because we're a small
state and we have
just one or two degrees of separation.
These school districts that can
collaborate are
sharing best practices that are
helping with their schools. So,
in your work and when you come back in
November, I would definitely
talk to those school districts.
Um I know the
Lass uno school district received
the NASRU, the National School
Resource Officer model
agency. See
what they're doing, Mr
Chairman and panel.
Um when
we talk about it and Senator Soul
says all the time we have
money and,
and Mr Chairman and uh
panel, how
much money, what is our total
budget? And I'm gonna refer to Daniel
actually, uh
Daniel, how
much, what is our total budget that
we spend on public
schools in in New
Mexico?
>> Mr Chairman in Fy
25 you all
appropriated $4.4
billion to public school
support and >> thank you Mr
Chairman and, and Daniel,
how much have we appropriated
for school safety?
>> Mr Chairman Representative
Baca in Fy 25 you all
appropriated a nonrecurring
appropriation of $1 million
for school panic
buttons as
mark mentioned in Fy 24.
You all also appropriated
$35 million from
the public school capital, all a
fund for
school security. You all
did not continue
that appropriation in fy
25.
>> So thank you, Mr
Chairman and thank you, I'm
trying to raise a point here
when we talk
about,
you know, we say about our kids, what are our two
responsibilities? We
educate them and keep them
safe.
We're talking about 4
billion and we're talking
about 35 million.
We're talking about having, you know, we're talking
about school form of learning,
talking about Maslow's hierarchy
of needs. Never thought
I'd use that when I was learning
about it in high school. But I say it all
the time if our kids
are not feeling safe, if
we're not
properly doing
everything we can to
create that healthy learning
environment and culture
that we're missing the bolt.
Um Mr
Chairman, I, I also
think uh in committee,
we talk about
school safety plans and,
and I'm gonna refer to my
colleague and friend
uh Representative Rio
Loba
that
we have one person
that's talking about school safety
at pe D. My,
my, my question is why do we
not have a division? Why do we
not? Because school safety
is more than just
safety plans,
it's providing resources.
And so my recommendation
is we're looking at this is
we need to create, we're, if
we're going to create a division and we could do them
all time.
Maybe we need to look
at having
more than just one person
looking at school safety because
it's more than plans and more than just
numbers. So,
um,
Mr Chairman,
the other,
as far as your work
plan,
um when we're
talking about this, it's people's
opinions and I, I'd be interested to
hear what are the, the different
stakeholders opinion on school
safety? Are we out
there? We're talking about schools, but are we talking
about parents? We're talking about
teachers that are in the classroom
and we're talking about students.
And I think that those as a
consumer, those that live it every
day because I have three kids in
school and I can
tell you that there's not
a day that goes by that, you know,
it's not in the back of
people's minds,
but I would uh respectfully
request that we take a look and
see. What
are the public opinion about
school safety in
New Mexico?
Um Now I'm gonna get to my direct
questions.
Page three and
your, uh this is your
brief. Um,
let's see, maybe not page three.
It's in your, it talks
about the 2009
study. It, it's not page three.
I actually wrote it wrong.
It talks about the,
you know, as far as the study
about school resource officers
and having police in schools,
um
causes more
as far as incarcerations and
folks that can, you just
elaborate briefly as far as that
that finding and, and
compared to like what we see
in New
Mexico,
yes, it is.
It's in the, in the next steps, I
believe. Sorry. Thank you,
Connor.
>> Yeah. So Mr Chair
Representative Baca, I believe you're
referring to the 2009 study
about from general criminal justice.
Is that correct? Yes.
So just to recap
for us there, that
study did find that in the presence
of a, of a, a resource
officer in a school
without controlling for economic
disadvantage led to a
402.3%
increase in disorderly
conduct arrest rates per
100 students. Uh
Disorderly conduct is
admittedly a very broad
idea. Uh And that
actually is one of the
points that this study
makes is that uh
disorderly conduct
is a fairly subjective
charge. Uh And
so there are concerns raised
about how that impacts students,
particularly, uh
you know, it can vary based
on the relationship that a teacher has
with a student. It can vary based
on the
relationship an SRO has
with a student. Uh
I, I can't speak specifically
to how it has changed in New Mexico,
but I'm happy to do a deep
dive more into that and get back to you on
that. >> And thank you,
Mr Chairman and, and I thank you.
And part
of this is we're talking about school
resources in Mexico. It
may not be utilizing them correctly.
It may be that the
school resource officer may be doing
discipline as opposed
to what they are and that administrative
function Oron
is being passed on to the officer
and they're being put in a place
in a situation that they really
shouldn't. Uh Mr
Chairman, um
and panel,
one of the requirements
for our school safety plans
is anonymous reporting that
every school district do we have
any data or any information
regarding the
anonymous, the anonymous reporting
of, of
incidents? Um
And if you don't, that's, that's
ok.
But
>> Mr Chair Representative Baca,
no sir, we don't have data
as of yet, but I can definitely
request that and dive into that.
>> Well, thank you,
Mr Chairman and thank you panel because I
want to say is that school safety is
the responsibility of everybody.
It's not just the administrator, it's not
your school resource or it's every student,
it's every staff member, it's every
parent in the building.
And if we give our, our,
our folks our communities
an opportunity or an avenue
to report
security concerns,
then that needs that, that needs
to happen. So,
um and I'll end with
this Mr Chairman.
Um We actually
two things.
One of the, I actually had
a saw a presentation yesterday
um regarding
rocket. Are you guys familiar with the
rocket is like a school?
Uh It's for young Children
actually, it was regarding
school safety and it was a
cartoon red dog and
it, it was a, this,
this, this
program and again, I
I saw it yesterday and I said I was
going to bring it up today,
this, this group
and again, I'm not promoting
them, but they are
trying to reach students and talk about
school safety, bullying or otherwise at
young grades. And
I think that looking at some of
these uh
software programs or these
other supports to
get the message out would be an important
part of that. And
so it was funny,
um they were talking about how
it may be hard for a kindergarten
or first grader to talk to an adult
or police officer about something going on
here. But how many kids disclose
it to this animated cartoon,
Red dog about that they
were aware of being
abused. And
so that's an important piece of
it. And then finally,
Mr Chairman School
Safety Summit,
you know, I was fortunate enough to
work with the
Lieutenant Governor Morales on
that we
had, it's the response
has been so overwhelming that we actually
had to get a bigger venue this
year because we, we were
actually we expected
400 more came. And so
now we're actually have to move it. So I think
that as moving
forward that just tells
me that we need that this conversation
of school safety needs to be
ongoing. So
I appreciate that. I
hope that as far as when we come back
in November, that we have some clear
ideas as
far as how we can as
a committee and panel
really make an impact with school
safety rather than kind of
just giving it live service like which I feel
we have. Thank
you,
her pres. I'm Garrett.
>> Thanks Mr Chair. Thank
you for your report.
Um My first request is
that you look into safe to
tell.org and
I, I sent the
um website
to um, the
director and the deputy
director. It is
designed for young people
in Colorado. It's been in action
for 20 years. It
allows for anonymous
reporting. I
know it. You know,
you know, someone has a
gun, you don't want to walk into
the principal's office and
tell them, oh, you
know, my best friend has a
gun and
things aren't anonymous. Somebody
sees somebody. So it's a
system that's been at work in
Colorado and it would
be, I think worth our time
to look into it.
Um The second thing is
um, we've had a big increase in
juvenile crime
and I think many of
us are aware of the 11, the
11 year old who was involved
with 14 year olds and,
and a group there
in a car stealing
thing they're posting on social
media, they had guns, they
shot. And,
um,
so that's a bigger
problem that
unfortunately is affecting
our schools,
uh, kids having
guns and there's no consequences.
So I just want to report
that. Um, there's
a lot of attention and
c in the courts,
correction
and
justice.
And, um, I know I, I was
on a panel this week
and the four of us, two Republicans, two
Democrats talked about
it because when
there's no consequence
for a juvenile
with a gun,
then they go back and they tell their
friends, oh, I had a gun I
was picked up. I was let
go. And so that's
just something that
we have to be aware of
and work on in conjunction
with law enforcement
attorney general. So I just want to
bring that to our attention
because it's, it's
chilling to see the number of guns
found on campus. Those
were the ones found.
And um, at my elementary
school we had a five year old show up
with a gun in his backpack,
you know, toy gun. Who
knows? He picked it up.
I had a seven year old commit,
kill himself in my
district. A couple blocks from my
house, guns left
on the counter.
So the gun violence
is a big
issue and
we have to address
it um
through various means. So I just want to make
that comment. Thank
you,
Senator Soul.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh a couple of
questions and things and, and
some of these high school
I was used to work
at,
got bigger and bigger and
bigger, you know, was
designed for about 1900
students and we got up to almost
2300 students
and the number of
bullying and
incidents and crime
and everything went up
substantially when the new high school
was built and the school
dropped down to 1700.
They went three months,
I think in the fall
with no
fights.
And we looked at the
effect of overcrowding
in our schools and the
tension that brings as far
as causing, you
know, some of the, the underlying
causes of
bullying as we build
larger and larger schoolss in
psychology. We talk about it,
the dein individualization,
you know, they, nobody
knows who you are in the school
and therefore, you
know, the the fights, the bullying and
other things are there.
Just, you know, it
was a curious thought about
things is, you know, how much
size and
overcrowding more than
actual size contributes
to the stress that leads towards
fights and incidents.
Uh So
not really a question in
that, I was
shocked when you indicated,
uh merit
10%
attempt suicides each year.
And that was prior to the
pandemic, I
immediately go to seeing
pictures of my students
in class and it's like my class
of 25 more
than two of them, they're gonna
attempt suicide.
That's frightening.
Um And I come
back to, and, and I think
Representative Garrett alluded to
it a little bit. It's the
guns, uh
suicide
attempts with a gun are
95% effective
where it's only about 10%
effective for other mechanisms.
And if we don't deal with
the gun culture and the
readily access
ability of
guns, we are
ensuring that our kids
are going to die through
suicide if not through
other shootings at
schools. And
to, to not
discuss that
as part of school safety
is, you know, we have to
recognize it's the
guns, school safety
is broader than that certainly.
But it's the guns.
Um,
we put a lot of capital money
into hardening schools,
putting fences around them,
foyers, uh locked
doors, all of
those.
But if we really are gonna take
that seriously
where, you know, if that
really is the
strategy,
does that mean we're not gonna have kids out at
recess?
We're not gonna pe classes
outside,
you know, is it make us
feel safe or does it
actually make kids safer
when we know they need
to have outside time?
We cannot protect them
at all those times. And so
I think it's an artificial
safety that the real
prevention comes
in all of the discussion of
other things about relationships
with adults, healthy
communities,
uh feeling
wanted, uh making sure
that each kid knows that there are
people there who care about them
are the real prevention.
The other things are illusions
of safety, not true
safety.
Again until we're gonna make sure
kids don't go outside at all
during recess, lunch
pe before
school, after school on the way
to the bus. You
know, if you think about
it as those
are times they're vulnerable
and we kind of ignore that, but we
give the illusion of safety.
Um
OK, here's where there's an actual
question and I think it
was Natasha, but
I can't remember on the talking
about the panic buttons. Maybe it was
mark,
it indicated that about
two thirds or more of our schools actually
have those. Is there any data? Have they
been used?
How many times have the panic
buttons been used
that they're now installed
or we're hoping
they never do and they're just
background? >> No,
uh Mr Chair uh represents
Senator so sorry. Um
No. Uh we do look at some of the
data that was available. Um
They do have a fair
amount of criteria that
reports fall into
but um reportedly
there was some miss
um
categorization. What
has to happen is after
an incident is reported,
the teacher or staff has to go back
and kind of categorize what actually
happened. We did note that
there is some um
skewness there, there's some
unreliable information.
So I don't have real good numbers
as to how many times it was used and
its activity
at this point. But that is something that
we do plan to dive into a little bit
later in the next portion of the
report. >> Thank you
and, and Mr Chair. I was
just wondering
whether since they're installed,
have they been utilized
uh when there's been a lockdown
or a, a,
what's the other word for it?
A shelter in
place incident
where those as a result of someone
pushing a panic button until
things got sorted out with
it. But
again,
it's the guns, we need to make
sure that we're not spending huge amounts
of money chasing ghosts
of the illusion of
security uh
when it's a
bigger society problem.
And if we're truly worried
about protecting kids
and with the high rate of
suicide,
we've got, we've got to do
something
culturally as
society in
the readily access of
guns because it's killing
our kids in schools.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you. Other folks
represent a lot
of,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you for the presentation. II,
I appreciate all the
information on
page 19 of the slides
for the safe school
plans. I'm
wondering
what
resources does
pe D especially
that second bullet, which where it says
works with schools to ensure
compliance. And I'm
asking how do they
work with schools to
ensure compliance? Is it
check the box type thing
or does somebody go actually out to
the school site to see if
these things were actually being
implemented?
>> Uh Mr Chair Representative
Lara, I, I
um have bespoken
with pe D um in
my and of course, please correct
me if I'm wrong in my understanding. I
know we have some members here,
but I think the enforcement
mechanism is really just
ensuring that they do
supply uh SS
SP and then as far
as following up with it. I think there's a
reminder, the support, but it's
more of a letter of
non-compliance, the enforcement
mechanism isn't quite,
that's limited.
>> Ok. Thank, thank you for that Mr
Chair. So then there, there isn't
somebody who physically goes out there
to see if the school
or the districts in compliance is
just, you know, you didn't turn it
on time, you know,
check this box
or, or do we have the, does
pe D even have the personnel
to, to make sure that these
plans are
put in place that can go out
there and see. Hey, yes,
you know, I'm trying to get into the school, the
door's locked. Do I have to
ask for permission to buzz in? Do
they, do they card me?
You know what I I'm
wondering if this is something that
Mr Chair, if
it's something that pe D needs
as more as a resource to
help them do this or,
and, or if you know, I don't know if you
know or not, how many people actually
work on the compliance on
this? >> Uh
Mr Chair,
Representative Lara this
moment, I would like to invite pe D
up to speak to some of their work
on
this
>> Mr chairman and
Representative Lara. I
don't know, but I appreciate
your questions. I am sure
that the programmer,
Deputy Secretary Castillo
could
have those details and I'd be happy
to follow up
with you on that. >> Ok.
Thank you, Denise. Thank you, Mr
Chair. I'm very interested in
how, if pe
d, you know, we need to
support pe D to get more
staff to, to, to ensure
that compliance instead of just checking the
box. Yes, they did
it or yes, we're taking the school
districts word for it.
Uh, because, you know, II
I just, I just want to make sure
that, that if we
have this,
the law in the
books and,
you know, if it, if it just,
if it's just a matter of checking a
box, you know, and
if something happens,
well, on the school plan, it
says that this and this and this,
but we didn't check
to see if it actually was done
and there was an incident, you know,
there's gonna be a lot of finger pointing.
So what I want to do, Mr Chair
and panel is make
sure that if pe D needs
those resources
or needs to hire additional
personnel to do that, if there's any way
that we can assist with that,
because it's critical to me,
Mr Chair and panelists
that we,
that it is more than checking a
box that is somebody
actually goes out there to, you know,
uh RL D has sends
out inspectors all the time,
you know. Iii I
don't want, I don't want RL D to get
mad at me, but maybe we can get RLD
to work with pe D to make sure that that's
happening at the schools. I don't
know that's just an idea, but
I'm just curious about how
we can support PE D
to make sure that it's
more than just checking a
box on
an online submitted form.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you other questions.
So I did have a question since
this has come up. Um
In the report, it talks about
the Safe School
Summit that
the money
has been allocated to for
the next couple years. We
had our first one back
2023
November. Do we
know the outcome
of the School Safety
Summit? What happened? It
mentions um
training plans
to the districts. Do we
have what those
trainings may have
been
>> Mr Chair? Yes, that's
a great question. Um There are
actually I went to the website
for they have a dedicated website
and they have a really good
description of all the events
and panels, I believe.
Um Representative Boco was there
as well as some, some of the staff that
there might be a little more knowledgeable.
I got to read about it. I didn't get to
attend. Unfortunately, hopefully the next one.
Um but yeah, there was um
um for
example FBI
director spoke about
different topics, there were some really
great panels. Um but
I I would, I can send
you the information from the website. There
was detail information on the panels
and the agenda and everything
so >> I can do that.
Cool. Thank you. I I was just
trying to Google the
website you mentioned.
Um Do we know how
many districts or
schools participated
in the summit?
Mr Chair? >> No sir. I don't have
official but I can definitely find
out.
>> No,
somebody may know
I'm hearing represent BCA
maybe
>> Mr Chairman
Tim might be able to address this,
Tim and I
attended
>> two attendees.
Mmh
>> uh Mr Chairman, thanks, thanks
for the question. The School Safety
Summit was, it was actually a really
awesome convening,
as Mark said, and I'm
sorry, I don't have the any
additional details on
exactly the topics that were covered.
But uh the
the information is all available
online. It was very
well attended. From what I
saw, I spoke to individuals
from three different
districts from all over the state.
I think the they
had an entire ballroom full
of, of individuals. I think
a really unique outcome
of the
summit was
the ability of school
districts to see what
kind of technologies
vendors are offering.
Uh the types of things that
exist and, and
really start to think
critically about the money
that you have provided for
school safety and how to spend that
money. Uh So
an example might be
they, they, they were able
to, to sort of walk around
to different booths
that vendors set up.
One of those booths might have been,
you know, bulletproof
glass company
and they didn't
understand that the technology
was readily available there.
There was somebody right there
who could install it for
them, you know, within,
within a year. So
I think there was a really
unique outcome that, that the
Safety Summit sort of brought
everybody together to
connect resources
to the technologies that are out
there.
>> So then with the money that was
appropriated, there will be a
subsequent
School Safety Summit.
Ok, cool.
Thank you all so much. And we look
forward to your uh
your continuation of this in
November. Thank
you.
Um We're a little bit
ahead of schedule.
Yeah, we'll take a break.
We'll come back. We'll see
if our presenters are ready by 230.
Does that work? Folks?
It'll be a little bit ahead of,
if they're here by 230
we can start at 230.
Uh Well, you're overruled
there. Vice
chair. All right, we'll come
back 230. See
where we're at.
