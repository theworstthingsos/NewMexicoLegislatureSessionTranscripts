consent. We go that our business
announcements and miscellaneous
seeing no objection. We are in that
order of business announcements

So as I mentioned, what we are going to do
is uh three
certificates honoring
uh three of our members
who are leaving us up
front and
Senator Campos will lead us

before we do that. However,
I think Senator Dew has
a unanimous consent
request that
has been reviewed
by, I know Senator
Brandt's not there, but he did look
at it. This is just to clean up
the table on a committee
report. Thank
you, Senator De. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. A
unanimous consent to expunge
the committee report
for Senate Memorial.
One from
Rules. Thank you, Senator Do,

Munoz Duhigg

and sealed at the Capitol in the city

Senator William F.
Burt Mimi
Stewart, President
Pro TEM Sherry
D Lujan, chief clerk,
New Mexico State
Senate.
Thank you to our
reader,
Senator Burton.
Thank you,  Mr.  President
Boy. Where do I begin?
I mean, you could hear all of the
things that Ron has
accomplished in his
12 years.
So I guess the first thing I should say
is Ron, look what you can do if we
can ever get you off the golf
course, you can do
amazing things. We appreciate
you doing that. Uh
It has been my pleasure
to
be my, have
Ron be my partner. We're
very fortunate that we're both
from Alamogordo and
Oer County. Uh
He has the, the
lower half, I have the upper
half, but the
coordination and the
cooperation that we've been able to
garner even
with some change
over in our house member
from that district
uh has been great
and uh we,
we're constantly talking, we're talking
about what we can do, not only
for our districts,
but we're also talking about
how we fit into a
state, the state
picture and, and things going
on throughout the entire state.
And it's truly been my
honour to serve with Ron. I hate to see
him go because I, I have no option
to get back up here if
there's a problem. But I guess
we'll have to figure that one out.
But  Mr.  President, I'd like to open
up to the floor to
see if there's anyone else who would like to
make some comments and,
uh, and uh, see what
they have to say about our Senator
Ron Griggs. Thank you,
Senator Burt Baca.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. It's
my greatest honour
to stand up
here and honour our own
Senator Ron Griggs.
Um I have a name for him
that I've never really told
him, I call him the
state's
mayor.
And so being
the state's mayor, what he does is
he reminds us us of
the local impact
that our legislation has
and how it might
impact his own
hometown of
Alamogordo. And it reminds
me of my own hometown,
Belen and what things,
what things that we do
here might
affect them. And
so with that,
he's always looking out for his
district and has
always been an
effective legislator
for representing what
they need in that
district.
Additionally, he's always been
a sound mind and
a very calming voice
in this legislature
when things get heated
sometimes.
And Senator Griggs
comes up on the list,
um, you can expect that
the temperature goes
to a moderate rate
where it usually needs to
be. And so
I've always appreciated
that about him
and what he, what
he talks about what he
represents, his
own attitude the
way he has served this
legislature with
honour with the support
of his lovely wife, Joan,
who is also just a, a
wonderful person
and supportive of what he's
done and who he
is. And uh together,
I know that Almog Gordo
will open their arms back to
them and they
are lucky to have them back
and we will surely miss him here.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator Baca, Senator Wirth.
Thank you,  Mr.  President
and thank you
Senator Griggs
and Ron and Joan.
Uh again, it's a team
effort. So also
Joan, thank you for 12
years of having him up
here. Um
You know, I have had the
pleasure of working
on water issues
and liquor issues and tax
issues and
uh this
session, uh
we certainly worked hard
on a, on a
comprehensive tax
reform package
and you know what,
it's when both sides. Once
again, this is the interesting thing,  Mr.
President, you know, we had some conversation
about the importance of
bipartisanship and it seems like
every time we stand up and talk about
folks, we're talking about all the
bipartisan things we did
and I just am super proud of
the tax package we did
this year, even if there's a
piece of it, that's a little bit hung
around my neck still. But that's
ok. That's ok.
That's what compromise
involves. And
certainly we've always joked, I
think, uh, I had a
new copy of Senate Bill
665 delivered to me
personally with the signature on it,
which I will keep and always
remember you a little water
bill in the past. But
you've just been a terrific member
of this chamber
and the state has been
lucky uh to have
you here. And certainly your
community has been lucky to have
you here and they need to hear that
and know that. And we
certainly wish you the best in
the next journey
and always know.
And we've talked a lot about the
legislative family and
we'll be here. So
don't be a stranger. If you come up
this direction, come check on
us. And again, many,
many thanks. Thank
you, Senator Senator
Brent.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And you
know, it's, it's an honour for
me to be able to stand here and
talk about my very good
friend,
Ron. I, I didn't know
Ron when we came up here
12 years ago at
all. I'd
never met him.
I didn't even know really all
that much about
Alamogordo.
And uh
Ron has become
one of my truest
and best friends up
here.
And any time that
I was struggling
uh with some of the
pain issues that I struggle
with or just, you know,
some of the other issues I could go
to Ron's office and sit
and, and,
uh, you know, sometimes I get a little
excited. I know most people don't
know that. But,
but, um, you know, if
I, if I would go talk to Ron,
he'd, he'd calm me
down
and bring me back to the level I
needed to be at
and I'm gonna mess him up
here. Uh I
do promise him, I'll call
him and bug him like I do Lee
Cotter. Uh because
I, I still talk to Lee all the
time and,
you know, 11 year,
uh Lee myself
and Ron drove
across country,
just the three of us together
to Kansas. I don't know if Ron
remembers that,
but that was a great
trip. Uh We
had a lot of fun together and,
and just really enjoyed
that time. Uh
Got to know Ron a lot
better but, but I will
definitely mess him up
here and it
seems like today and, and
this year I'm saying goodbye to,
to most of the people I came in
with. I was just telling Pat
that him and me are
the only two left on
the Republican side from that
class that are
planning to run again.
Ron. I will miss
you. You've been
a great friend
and, uh, thank you so
much for everything you've
done for me
here. You
mean a lot to me? Thank you,
brother. Thank you,
Senator Brandt, Senator
Mres.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I'm wondering what we're gonna
do. Uh, Senator Lee Cotter's,
uh, going
away
since you brought up.
Uh, the best
thing, um, Ron Griggs
ever did, um,
or talked someone into and
was marrying him,
Joan.
Um, that's definitely the
best thing you ever did, Joan. You are
a true, gentle lady and
it's been an honour and,
uh, I've, I've, I've, it's grown to love
you and Ron these last
12 years. I was part of the class
that, uh, Craig
just, uh, talked about. I think there
was over a third of us in the
entire chamber, came
in that class and I guess
most of us have left or are
leaving except for a couple
of you have left. But,
you know, we share those suites
upstairs together and had a lot
of great memories and Joan was
part of that. And,
uh, we we sat there in 4,
14 and 416 for eight
years together and
you've always been that true
gentleman. And if you
guys ever drove, drive through
Alamogordo, you'll notice
everything. Every park, every
road, everything is named Griggs.
But that's not, it's
not like Questa, it's not like
named after Senator Griggs.
Um It's uh uh
it's uh his father
and his family has been so
instrumental in that
community for many, many
generations. And you
did, you made your family
proud for your service up
here? You're a good man.
You're a good lady. You
are a true genting and gentle
lady of Almog Gordo
in Artero County. I
love you both. And
I guess we're walking out
together, arm in arm as we
walked in all those 12 years
together. Uh, so love
you guys and
III I, I'm
about to cry again. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator
Moos. We have Senator Padilla followed
by Senator
Shino.
Senator. Thank you
very much, Mister President.
This one's going to be kind of hard for me.
I, you know, I, I've been saying,
you know, this and that and you know about
the folks that are leaving and I do
love Senator Moore's and
the whole gang that's walking out this
year, but always
a gentle touch
to absolutely every single thing
that Senator Griggs did and I'm
that from the bottom of my heart, I've
had some extreme highs here and
it's some extreme lows
and, and in the middles.
And there have been times where
he's just kind of moseyed on
up and talked to me and calmed
me down and said, you know,
tomorrow's another day and this
and that, and I really
truly am gonna miss him
because at the end of the day, he
could, you know, uh,
question you for two
hours in a committee or on the floor
or whatever and, and still
vote against your bill, but you just feel
good about it. I don't know how he does
that. And so I
just, I'm gonna miss him very
much. Um,
I didn't, as Senator Morris
just said I did or, or
sorry, Senator Brandt, I didn't
know a lot of about a mado. I think
I'd only been there one time but
I know a lot about it now
because of their senator.
And that says a lot about a
leader from a community coming
up to Santa Fe to work for the, the
people that he represents. And
I, I think I'm very lucky to
have him as a friend and I
will say  Mr.  President, if you
need anything at all,
Senator Griggs, you can call on me
and I'm happy to help you.
Thank you, Senator Padilla. We have Senator
Shindo followed by Senator Neville,
Senator Stefani, Senator
Maestas, Senator Ortiz
Pino, Senator
mckenna, Senator Sanchez, Senator
Hickey and Senator
Woods.
Thank you,  Mr.  President, I to
rise.
So if you give words to my good friend
there from Hela Mordo.
Um you know, we've been,
as Mark said, we all came
in, I think uh 15
of us came in into this chamber
back in the
2013 worked
together. And
uh and I have been in,
in a
business and transportation for
the last eight years and
really enjoyed him. Uh
this, you
know, um
this year as a ranking
member and
truly, you know, just a soft
spoken man. And I think everybody
has says that just
really calm
and, and really a lot of
expertise in local government
and, and when, when we're talking about
counties, talking about
cities, I think
it's really important, you know, that he
shares his perspective.
You know, Ron's also a,
a really good golfer, you know,
city champion.
That's one thing that Ron and I have never
done and hopefully we can do that here
now that you're retired. And hopefully
I can come down to Ellen Mordo
and play a round of
golf and uh and just
enjoy the day and
also want to thank Joan,
I can see her forehead over
there for all the
times that, that, that,
that you support it, you know, uh
wrong and
all the end and, and, and just
always a pleasure to see
both of you and, and have
dinners with our committees and
in the travels that we've done
together. And
so I have uh
one last gift from, from
our committee. I have
this little sign that says
ranking member
Senator Ron Gritz
and this is what I'm gonna
give you so that you can have this
in your home. I know that he
asked my committee if you could take. This
is the only thing that says ranking
member in the committee brought
it down this morning is that make
sure you give this to Ron uh,
before he leaves. So,
uh congratulations from,
from my committee staff as
well. So, thank you. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Sino
Senator.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.
Um
You know, I had a flat
tire one time and
it was in Ron's district and
it was bound to be his
fault.
Uh, but,
uh, he's
been a great friend,
Mr.  Chairman. Um,
he knows a little bit about the oil and
gas business because he was
in that for a while before he got
into the title business.
And one
of the things that we spend a lot
of time doing is talking about that
and, and what it does to the
economy in New Mexico
and we got to figuring out
that he was a former mayor
and us, former chairman of a county
commission and there's some laws that
affect both of us, the
hold harmless laws which
still are wreaking
havoc on a lot of our communities.
And I hope someday the
legislature decides to fix
that, but uh our
communities are suffering there. But
Ron and I have talked about that many
times we've had some bills we've
discussed and
uh he's, he's got a
strong interest in the
community and trying to
make things better. I
appointed Ron to be the
uh what we call the clear
chairman in the Energy
Council for representing
New Mexico. And the clear
is uh the educational
side of the Energy Council.
They educate you on
wind and solar and nuclear
and oil and gas and everything there
is. And Ron served
diligently on that. He replaced Carol
Lavell who served in that position for
many years. And, uh,
anyway, Ron's been a great
friend. Uh, Joan
Joan and Tammy, my wife,
they've wandered every town I can think
of all over the place trying
to find a place to eat or go
shop or whatever they needed to do
and, uh, been
great friends. And that's
one of the things that I'm gonna miss most
about this place is the great friendships
we've had. Ron. Congratulations
on your retirement and
I'm gonna be in Alamo Road in about
three weeks and we'll look you up.
Thanks. Thank you, Senator
Neville, Senator
Phoenix.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
It's been my pleasure to work
with Senator Ron Griggs.
Um, we've been able
to work on a few bills
together, but even
if we haven't, his,
um, arguments
have been well reasoned,
they've been kind
and I truly appreciate that
here in the chamber. Thank you
very much and I hope you have a great
time. In retirement, travelling
to see the grandkids
and the Children. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator Stefani.
We have Senator Maestas, Senator
Ortiz Pino. Senator
mckenna, Senator Sanchez,
Senator Hickey, Senator Woods
and Senator Gago.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
just want to take a moment to rise
and share the love
with the Senator Griggs.
A lot of senators don't
really take the time to get to know
house members.
Um, but we did,
uh, but I knew that
Senator Griggs was pushing
the envelope on a
liquor license reform
for years and years.
It took 40 years to crack the
dam on that, on that policy
initiative. So
when we uh when we, when
we were working on liquor license reform,
a couple of years back,
uh Senator Griggs
was all about his district,
he was all about Alamogordo.
He was all about his local
businesses and, and
building that economy back
home uh regardless
of the winds that were
swirling around us. And it
was, and also with
regards to uh the
uh immigration detention issue,
he was about Alamogordo,
he was about his
district and,
and the jobs in his community.
But even though those were highly,
highly passionate
emotional issues,  Mr.
President, he was
always uh uh
professional, so
passionate in his
own mind, but dispassionate in
terms of his negotiations
and his leadership and his
political prowess. So anyway, I just want
to wish you the very, very
best. I wish I could lean over
and look at you,
Mr.  uh Senator Griggs.
But, um,
but I just wish you the
very, very best we look forward to being
down in your neck of the woods and visiting
you and you made a
heck of a contribution to the
state and this body
uh with your leadership and
your uh and your, your class.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Maestas,
Senator
Tinno.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And, um, I, I got
to know uh
Ron when
we work together on spec
and
his,
his calm manner has already
been alluded to by a lot
of, a lot of people who have
spoken, but it really
worked in that committee.
He was so
um uh careful
in what he said and,
and so
calming on everybody
in the II I
in the committee that
he was an incredible
contributor.
Um
his knowledge of
government, especially local
government and its needs,
I think are gonna be
um uh
an incredible loss for this
body when, when he retires
now.
And
one of the other things I,
I always want to
mention when I, when I think of,
of course, his, his
contribution with the liquor reform,
I think is gonna have an incredible
impact on the state. That's
something that, that
uh will, will
continue to have
positive benefits in the
state for many years to come
and, and he was really
able to work on that so
effectively. But what
I most think about
when I think of Ron
is,
if he gave you his word, if he
said he was gonna be for you,
never, you never had doubts.
He never, if
he said he was going to be against the
bill, he explained
why and he was very
clear, he said he's going
to be for a bill. He explained
why and, and,
and you could take his word.
And, um, I've
really enjoyed working with
him. He's been a
great senator,
a great person
for the state, but also
as, as Senator Maestas
mentioned for his district
for Otero County
and, and he just has
fought tooth and nail
for Otero County, making
sure that that
whatever happens here will
work to the benefit of his home
county. So,
um I'm, I'm missing you.
If I get down to Alamogordo,
I'll look you up, Ron. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator Tip
Pino, Senator
mckenna.
Thank you,  Mr.
President and
thank you, Senator
Griggs.
Um I got
to meet the kind
senator when
I joined this
fine body in
2021. We both
served with
the on the Indian and Rural
Affairs Committee
and what an experience
because we spent
all of our meetings
virtual.
And um it was
just a testament
to
Mr.  President to the
senator, how
well versed he was as a
public servant
because when we
talked about bills,
we had discussions and
dialogue.
Um and it was
always a really
cohesive and
enjoyable conversation.
So I really enjoyed serving
with you Senator Griggs on
that committee.
And I am,
I had no idea,
Mr.  President that we're having
such turnover
that we're losing yet another
senator, um
such rich
um
institutional knowledge.
But I, I really am
pleased that I got to
serve with Senator
Griggs and
um I wish him
and Joan all the
best, Joan,
the incredible musician.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator mckenna, Senator
Sanchez. Thank
you,  Mr.  President.
And I echo what the rest of the
body has said. What
a great man when I first met
him, Senator Griggs.
Uh, you know, I come into my
office in the morning and get my
stuff situated
and then I go into Senator Griggs office.
Our offices are right next to each
other and we'll
start talking about bills or the
day or what happened
and, you know, and then we'll get down to
business, but he
really held my hand through a lot of
stuff. We, I, I
had the honour to share tax
and business with him, Indian affairs
with him for four years now
and just sitting by
him and him
teaching me the ways and,
and you know how to look at the
bills and where to look and
just all the knowledge he's
gave me these
last four years. He's been a great
mentor, a great
man. You know, we're
gonna miss you, Senator Griggs. We're
gonna miss the knowledge.
Just, uh, I'm
gonna miss the mornings coming
in and you with your
tea and me with my coffee
since you don't drink
coffee,
but just all the great
talks and all that, you know, and even
through the summer, you, you know, I
call Senator Griggs here
there. He always answer the phone, always
has a kind word, uh,
whether we're talking business
about Senate or just what's
going on. But
I, I just really appreciate
you. Thank you for taking me under
your wing. Thank you for, you
know, sitting next to you at the
committees and, and
showing me how
the whole process works and I
just, I'll be Deb
it to you forever. I appreciate it. Thank
you, Senator  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Sanchez. We have
Senator Hickey following Senator Woods
and Senator
Ggo.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Very simply, Senator.
If, if I can look at you,
um, just a
role model. I was on
Senate tax and business
in a committee,
thoughtful thinking,
always cordial.
Uh, but I've had lots
of role models here,
but he is
just been the most even
toed and kind of when I
think of the word senator
and the decorum
and the approach
he's it. So,
thank you.
Thank you, Senator Hickey, Senator
Woods. Uh, thank you,  Mr.
President.
Uh,
Senator Griggs is a really
a classy guy.
Uh,
you know,
they talk about people
and personalities
and,
and he and
Joan are, are just
a step above
the kind of people that
I'm generally around. He
is just such a
classy
guy.
And so many times
we me and he would,
would decide to take a little
walk, go somewhere,
we'd get on the subject
and he
explained to me all the way
down there
while we
eating
and all the way back. And
generally, all I had to do is
nod once in a
while.
I appreciate you,
sir.
Uh
I live in a whole different
environment than you
do
that would need.
We had a great friendship.
So, thank you very
much.
Thank you, Senator Woods, Senator
Gago.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Uh, appreciate
this opportunity to talk about
Senator Griggs. I,
when I came in in
2013
and I got to go to our first
capital outlay meeting
in Carlsbad. I got to meet him
and well, then we had
Caro be gay Kernan and
Ronald Griggs and
it's really important to learn
from them. Uh They
knew so much more
the newbies did. Uh,
but they would give really
good advice and just to
watch them, the three
of them deal with some of the
issues in Carlsbad.
I now have Senator
mccutchen's and I also
share Carl's bed with him
now and, uh,
it's gonna be hard to
replace his knowledge
that he has for
both Mordo all the way
down the mountain and into
Carlsbad. Uh, there's
people there that respect him and
they're gonna have to learn
to trust, uh, Sarah
mccutcheon and I,
and, and like they were saying
earlier that Jones always been with
him, she's very class
act. Um,
I guess my thing is, is
the biggest thing
was to be able to see him
work now that I
came to the Senate from the
house. Uh,
I didn't get to see him work
much when I was in the house,
but to see they talked
about even killing and
being a gentleman.
It's evident. Uh,
I've never heard him lash
out. I have a problem,
uh, because I'd like to,
uh, but there's people
around me that sort of govern
that and, and keep
the house member out of me.
But I just wanted to give Senator
Griggs my,
my thanks for everything he's
done and just my
prayer that you'll enjoy
life and grandkids
and, and golf. So,
thank you for that  Mr.  President,
Senator Griggs. Thank you,
Senator Gallego, Senator
Jamil
Mr.  President. I have to say that I miss
my neighbour. I came in
as the pandemic class
and was fortunate enough to sit right
next to Senator
Griggs, a man
who is even tempered and
kind. And although we
might not always agree
politically, we
agree that we're New
Mexicans and the
beauty of his heart for
Alamogordo and for New Mexico
is something I'll always treasure
and something I'll miss.
Now, one thing he always
did is he always reminded me
my role as a county commissioner
and how I could pull in from that
experience into my role
as a senator. And we'd
have conversations about what it
meant to be a commissioner.
What impact state policy
could have when it comes to local
governments. And so
I'll always remember that
and I'll remember also walking
into the Senate lounge with
the Republicans. My very first
year it turned dead
quiet as I walked in,
I sat down and I said, I hear
here's where the best snacks are
in the roundhouse. And sure
enough, the snacks came out, the
conversation started. We didn't
talk politics, we talked about who
we are as New Mexicans.
We talked about family,
we talked about friends, we talked
about community and
you'll always have a friend in me.
Senator, you'll always
have a place in Espanola
when you're ready to come up north.
You let me know my
home. Mi casa es
su Casa. Thank you,  Mr.
President.
Thank you Senator Jamil, Senator
Rodriguez
working
like,
thank you,  Mr.  President.
Um And I to stand
in support and, and
extreme gratitude to our
great senator here,
Senator Griggs. I'm gonna miss
you very much. Um,
I agree. You know, you're just
very kind and gentle
and always approachable.
It's someone we can go to
and, and not have to worry that
because you're under stress that you're
gonna blow up or anything like
that, you're just even tempered. You're,
you're great. And,
um, you know, you,
you, um, really,
uh, know so much about
local governments. And
I recall very much
your, your
sincere um
admiration for,
for the counties and, and
municipalities and in trying
to help them. And then with your
understanding that they just
don't have enough funds to
maintain their buildings.
As you may recall the bill
that you and I talked about to
help counties maintain
the buildings that they have
responsibilities for,
but they don't have funding
to maintain them and yet they're
obligated by statute.
And so I
really appreciate your efforts
and, and all that you did and
have continued to do. And you know
what? I have a feeling that even after
you retire, that you
will continue to, to
serve in some capacity
um and continue to help because
that's who you are. That's your
heart. And I appreciate
that very much. So
the magistrate courts, another
thing you recall, we spoke about
that and it was through your
doing that magistrate
courts have really become
just better, better and better, more
improved and have more
buildings and more state of the
art facilities. Thank you
for what you've done. And
that's just counting on a few
things that you have uh
you have spearheaded
and uh and made happen.
So just know that I have
learned a lot from you and,
and I will continue to
learn even when you're gone. You
know what? We always look back
and say this is how Senator Ron
Griggs did it. This is how he
thought this is the way he,
he pursued those things
he wanted to do. So,
thank you. We will follow
your steps,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator Rodriguez.
Senator Pirtle.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And, uh,
I was in on the class 12
years ago when we came in
and, uh, you know, I
was, um stuck
in an office next to
Jayron
and, uh, you know, it wasn't until
four years ago. I finally got away from
him whenever Senator Morris became
caucus chair and I was able to move two
offices down.
But in that
eight years, we spent many a
morning, uh,
with, uh, Senator Co
our first four years up
here and, uh,
we just talk about things and
get to know him and
his family, Joan and his
granddaughters and his
kiddos would come visit from
time to time and
to uh see him light
up and talk about his family is,
is really to understand
uh Ron Griggs. But what he doesn't
know, it's a similar story to Senator
Woods is, you know,
the drive from Roswell to
Santa Fe can quit, get
quite dull from time to
time.
And we all have people that you
can count on when you call them. And if you
call Ron 99%
of the time he answers the
phone.
And, you know, I'm
not ashamed to say, I've never
told him this, but I, I used him
a few times to fill up that
airspace between
Vaughn and Rosswell because
you can always count on him one to
answer. And then two, there was
always something to talk about
and you might
go through an area where you
really couldn't get a word in because
the cell service wasn't that
great. Um, but a lot
of times you didn't have to
and, uh, I, I would use that
opportunity because he does know
so much about so many
things and it was just an
opportunity to, to make
that connection. And
I would use those opportunities say, hey,
I hadn't talked to, I hadn't talked to
Ron in a while. I'm gonna give him a
shoutout. And,
um, and so I'll always
remember that and know that,
uh, with Senator Griggs, you can give him a
call, always
willing to take the call and,
and, and talk about whatever
it is you want to talk about.
And there was one
session that, that really sticks
out for me is, uh, when my
grandfather passed away.
And, uh, I was gone a few
days and didn't make a, a real
big deal out of it,
just kind of disappeared for a few
days and came back to
a, a really heartfelt letter that
I, I still keep in my office
to this day and I, I'll
let you know Senator, I'll never forget
it and I appreciate
you.
Thank you, Senator Pirtle.
Senator
Burt,
thank you,  Mr.  President.
And, uh,
so many good things about Ron. I,
I have to tell you and it's been
said quite a bit, you're on the floor.
You know, the, uh, uh,
he's even
killed,
he's methodical
in the way he handles
things. But don't
let the, the good old boy
demeanour fool you.
He is one of the
smartest
people I've
ever met when it comes
to, uh,
cities,
counties, lands
and so on and so forth. He spent
20 plus years as a
land guy for
Texaco.
Then he, then he came
back to Allen mcguire, opened a title
company and got on
the city commission was
on the city commission for a total of 12
years. And I think four of those, at least
four of those were mayor.
So he continued to learn.
So, uh you know,
and then on top of that,
uh he took on
this job up here another
12 years up here.
And uh I think
if nothing else, he certainly
earned his time back
on the golf course a little
bit, but it's not
just Ron, I mean, this is a family,
family deal. Uh
And we've talked a little bit about
Joan. Uh
I don't know if you know it or not, but
Joan is
an incredibly
accomplished cho and
pianist and
she's played with the symphony up
here in Santa Fe
before. You just don't walk
in off the street and go, hey,
can I jam with you guys?
Uh Joan
knows her stuff
and he talks
uh and Joan talks about
their kids and grandkids
and, and that's certainly their
pride. Um,
I don't know if Ron's ever mentioned it or not,
but Ron
and jones' son is a
bank president in
Alamogordo and
has been for years and well-respected
within the community involved
in the community, uh,
in the chamber of commerce and, and
things of that nature.
And Aaron was Miss
New Mexico
2002. I
think that's right.
2002.
And, uh, Erin,
although she lives in Tennessee
right now, she
is an event planner.
Uh Aaron doesn't,
she's fully capable of this.
I mean, she could do weddings and reception
all. No, she flies
all over the world. Setting
up months
at a time, setting up music
festivals, celebration
festivals, um
places like Dubai, I
think and, and Qatar
somewhere in those areas over
there. Uh Europe
Orient, she's, she's
all over the world and she's in
demand
and uh
so
every person in the family is
in, uh
uh just extends
themselves to
their job and
whatever they do and
excels and all that they
do. And,
uh, and by
the way, Ron's dad
was a city commissioner before he
was. So,
uh he's, the whole
family has been uh
generational into
Alamogordo and Otero County
and uh uh we
wouldn't be that same place without
the rigs there
and just like icing on the
cake. His aunt
is former representative
Tuts Green, who is my
treasurer for my campaign
So, it's, it's kind of incestuous,
but, I mean, it's ok. It's
not a big deal
but, uh, good people
doing good things all
over the state and
an exceptional person
and an exceptional couple.
Doing great things in
Otero County and Oval. Gordo.
I'm gonna miss you a lot. Well, we'll
see each other but
I need to bounce things
off of you. So we'll have
coffee. Right.
Right. Ladies and gentlemen,
my honour to
honour tonight,
uh, retiring
senator
from district 34
Mr.  Ron
Griggs.
Ron, stand up
rigs.
You know, the, these kind of
things are
you, you
guys are way much nicer.
But if you, if you think
back there
was a, there was a TV
show and I, I think
it was something that was Dean Martin's
Roast
and it's just kind of
like that in a
way, but you guys are so
nice
and, and they
weren't. But,
uh, uh,
the Senate is a special
place. It's a
special place
and it will always be
special to
me.
The, the
demeanour, the operation
of the Senate
is extraordinary
and I didn't know,
I didn't know exactly what I was
going to get into when I came
up here. And I don't
believe any of the rest
of us that came up here at
that time really
did. Maybe, maybe Mark
because he had the opportunity to sit
up there. But,
um, you
know, it's, it's something, it'll
always be
really, really
special to
me and
uh love all
of you. Yeah,
even worse. But I
mean, it's, it's
no, you, you guys
are just way special. You
really are. Our differences,
are our differences,
but in the
end, we're all New
Mexicans, we
all want what's
best for this state.
And I hope that as
you guys go forward
that you find it and
you really make this the best
state it can possibly
be. So, thank you,  Mr.
President and thank, thank
all of you. Thank
Joan,
uh, the
kids. It
because it wouldn't happen
without them. So,
thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator

Thank you to our reader, Senator
Deles. Thank you very much,
Mister President.
It's,
it's an honour and a pleasure
to begin if you
will with the comments
regarding
our friend, State
Senator Brenda
mckenna.
I recall the very
first times that
we got together and we
were working on
the transition where she
was becoming our caucus
chair. And
within that very
humbly, very
forthright,
very visionary
and most importantly, with a
lot of compassion,
Brenda brought forth so
many thoughts and
ideas to
each and every one of us. She wanted
to ensure that our voices
were heard
and in that with the voices that
were being heard, it was not only
about ours
but the constituents,
the environment,
the way that we all treat
animals.
Brenda has
a heart of gold
for everything in
life. <She is>
an individual who when
she goes forward,
she always
keeps the
environment, people
and most importantly,
everyone in mind
through the spirit,
she has that spirit
that whenever you visit with
her, what really
resonates is
everything is heartfelt
in Brenda's life
for everyone. And
so with that  Mr.  President,
we're open to others who
may have thoughts
and ideas or words to
share, but
I'd like to yield to Senator Peter
Wirth to begin this. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Campos Senate
majority leader, Peter Wor uh
Thank you  Mr.
President and
thank you Brenda
for an
amazing service to our
state. Just for
all of those listening. I don't
think anyone
can truly appreciate and
understand how difficult
it was when you walked
in the door here with your
class in the middle of
COVID.
And I mean, trying
to do this when
we're all here in person
without walls and screens
and masks. Is hard
enough, but coming in
brand new uh in
that environment was
extraordinary and you
took on a leadership
role in our caucus right out
of the gate. And I
was, I will always forget
you did something that is not
easy to do in, in as
you're managing a caucus all
on Zoom
and is get getting
certain members and
figuring out how to navigate.
And so that it was fair and
it wasn't one or two people
controlling the whole agenda.
And I think you really changed
how we did things in our caucus
for a good way. And
I've been uh incredibly
appreciative of what you've
done for our
animals.
And I mean, these are huge
bills that you were able
to get across the finish line and
that we had worked on for years
and years. Part of the
bipartisanship,
it took that
bipartisan support and
bipartisan opposition
and you were able to get that
done. And so I just
wish you the absolute
best in the next
part of your journey and
please stay in touch and
we will always
cherish what you did for
your district and for the
state and for all of us. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator Wirth. We have Senator
rigs followed by Senator Pope.
Senator Stefanik, Senator Padilla,
Senator Jaramillo, Senator Schmid
and Senator
Tinno,
Senator Griggs.
Thank you,  Mr.  President
and Senator
mckenna has just been a
joy to get to know,
uh,
she,
she just a wonderful
lady and
she conducts herself,
uh, very,
very well and it's just, it's
been fun to be around her. It's
been, it's been fun to
kind of guess what hat she
might wear the next day.
Uh, but,
uh, I haven't seen too many of them
quite this year. Brenda.
But, uh, but
she, she just,
she just real special.
She came to one of
Janss concerts and we had
an opportunity to visit
some and, and it was
just, it was just really sweet
that she did that. So
she had, she
stayed longer and longer.
She would have just grown
in the, in the job.
So  Mr.
President and Senator,
thank you for voting your
time.
Your family's time
here,
taken
the opportunity to serve
your district and do
the things you did
in the way that you did them. You
should be proud of that and we're
proud of you. So thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator
and you send her Gregg, send her
Pope.
Thank you  Mr.  President.
You know, it's just
been
such a joy to
get to know Brenda.
I uh actually
got a chance to meet her a little
bit while we were campaigning
in
2020
being really close
together and being
close to Albuquerque's West
side. And there were
a few times we did a few uh
outdoor events. We were over
there by uh
Cottonwood Mall on the West side
with our campaign signs
as five o'clock
traffic was coming on the west
side. And,
um, really, the
first chance I really got to
meet her, I had never known
her and
then we came into the
Senate and I just
really got a
chance to see her passion
and her heart for really
what she believes in.
Um,
and she
just really finds a way
to have
that passion and that
drive
but not be
disrespectful to others or
make it personal.
And that's something in some ways that
I could, I really want to learn
from her and I hope
I can do that.
Um
I'm really gonna miss
you.
I wish you were
still
gonna be here next year
where, where I hope to
be
and I hope we continue our
friendship
and I'll say something I probably shouldn't be
saying right now. Um
But, uh, you know, we have
a little group text some of
our, our, our freshman group
and she
always just out of the
blue out of nowhere puts a
funny gift out there for us
to, to laugh at. We don't know
where it's really coming from.
And a,
I just hope you remain in our group
chat no matter what.
And we can always
just continue to chat
and talk about what's going on
in our state because
regardless of you're a senator or
not, I
know that you're always gonna be
fighting
for New Mexicans.
So I appreciate you.
Thank you. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Pope, Senator
Fanni.
Thank you,  Mr.
President. I stand
to
thank you, Senator Brendan
mckenna for taking
on the complicated
issue of wild horses.
Wild horses affects
many different counties in
our state and
reservations
tribes,
Pueblos,
uh Lincoln
County, uh Bern
Leo County, Santa Fe County
and many others.
It's a complicated
issue but you were
willing to talk to the
opponents, the
proponents
and Senator
Woods myself.
And I know
that we have opened the
dialogue to do
something better for the
people of our state. I
wish you all the best
as you go forward with your
new endeavors and
your next set of
your life's goals.
Thank you very much. Thank
you, Senator Steane, Senator
Padilla.
Thank you very much, Mister President.
I also want to just say thank
you to Senator mckenna. A couple
of things I was going to say have already been said,
but one of them that really gets me the
most is uh when I'm
really super duper stressed
out running around with like a whip
and circling this and that
and in the building here on the
floor, whatever, every now and then I'll just,
I don't know if she sees me or
she just decides to just
drop a, a very
creative meme or
phrase or phraseology
or whatever she's doing at that very
moment. She might be outside, she
might be meeting, bless you
whoever that was,
um,
bless you
again.
And so as a result
it always puts a smile
on my face and I really
appreciate that about Senator
mckenna. The other thing I'll
mention, Mister President
is I, I don't think I've met a
state senator or a legislator
that is just so very
genuine with absolutely every
position that she has
whatever it may be
and not shy about.
It just tells us exactly how she
feels. And I think that's, uh, that
just bodes well and it says
a lot about her character and who
she is. And I've just
always enjoyed working with her. <She is> a
calm, calming presence.
I'm kind of over there the other day. I
was walking through the chamber trying
to figure out where everybody was freaking
out over here and I see
this hand kind of come up out of the
bottom of her desk. I
had text her or called
her. I'm right here. Here's my, I,
I stuck my hand up so you could see
me. And so she
was under her desk just kind
of keeping the peace
and doing her part and being a
part of the team. Thank you,
Senator. Thank you, Senator
for the Senator Jaramillo
Mr.  President. If this was a
yearbook, I'd be saying cheers
to one awesome woman I met
during the pandemic Senate
class. Stay cool
and don't change for anyone
kit class
of 2021 rules.
But the truth is  Mr.
President, she is a
servitude leader who rule, who
leads with heart, a
woman who will do
anything for any one of
us in this chamber. Um
When I was feeling a little
homesick during the pandemic
because I was staying here and of
course, I couldn't see family. We were
staying safe. Brenda would
bring me homemade tortillas
and she would sl them over to me
and say here's a piece of home for
you. And so I'll never
forget that she's a woman who
continues to fight to
keep her language alive,
working with other women
in the pueblo to ensure that
the tewa language will stay in
Nabe. And a woman who knows
that I'm in bed by 8:30 p.m.
every night. So I can wake up at four
to do Los Alamos work
and I wake up every morning
at 4 a.m. to 10 text
messages from Brenda that will
read. Are you awake?
Are you awake? Now,
what about now?
Wake up and
then I'll have several other messages
from Brenda and that's how I start my
day every single morning.
I'm gonna miss you, Senator Makena, but
this isn't goodbye. I'm
excited that you're not only a
friend to me, you're a member of my
family. And so I will
always be here for you. And
when you're at Namba Oing,
you come to me in Espanola
so that we can have more tortillas
this time. I'm gonna make them for
you. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator
Senator
Sms. Thank
you very much,  Mr.  President. I just wanted to
say I, I really, I
really appreciated serving
with Senator mckenna
on sack.
One thing I really
appreciate about her
is very, very
often. She will give
a very heartfelt
reason for why
she is either supporting
or opposing a piece of
legislation. It's
always very, very interesting to me
to listen to her because
we're,
we're very much
um often
on the pos side of
things,
but to bring that up, we had
that very common thread
of very,
very, very often, if not
always being
on the same side of
the wildlife issues that would come
through our committee. And
so it's neat to, to
have that, that common
thread and I very much
respect uh her, her
passion and her
leadership in that area. And it's been really
neat to, uh to
just serve with her, especially in that committee
with all the legislation that comes
through.
Thank you, Senator Schmitty, Senator
Disip
Pino.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And my
first thought when,
when I heard that she was leaving
was, oh,
too soon,
too soon
because
in a lot of ways, we
lost those first two years with the
pandemic
and she's
just,
every time we have
a meeting you can see her getting
stronger and,
and, uh clearer
and, and,
and able
to convert her passion
into really effective
work. II,
I understand why she
has to leave. <She is> she's,
she's following a passion
of her own. Uh,
but the potential
for being such a great leader
in this body is there
and she's already done
so much as, as
our, uh, caucus
chairwoman and,
and, uh, the legislation
she's brought forth.
Uh I just wish you
really every success
senator in, in, in the
future. Uh, it's been a
joy working with you.
Uh, people don't
realize, I, I think unless you,
you're, you're with her at every meeting,
just how mischievous a sense
of humour she has
it, it, it, it,
it suddenly will come out
and, and, and leave you
kind of where did that come
from? But it, it's
been just a joy working with
you, Senator and I hope
everything goes well for you in the future.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator Tiano, Senator
Hicky.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Um I'm just looking at
her and seeing that smile. I
know I'm supposed to be looking for her. But I
can't help it because
it's been such a joy to have
next to me for these last
four years. I mean, I
can't tell you when
some of us are down and
really burned out. I
mean, she's, she's there.
Yeah. Ok. This is tough.
But you know what? We have a
reason to smile because
we're here and we're doing good
stuff.
Um, you
know, people have talked
about her
passion,
um it's
her passion for
compassion.
I think of
so many of the people who I've
worked with on committees. I've
never seen such
an advocate
for the dignity
of the individual as
her and particularly
for those who are
much worse off.
I mean, she puts the
human being
first
and that is so
admirable and many
of us need to think of that at
times as we're trying to
solve problems,
but not
only will I miss her presence. I
mean, and actually
that's with a Ts at the
end. I mean, sunglasses,
little insect,
animals and
candy. And I can't tell
you what, what comes in and comes
over my way has been
phenomenal. And
uh so, um actually
I was just kind of writing here
and actually what it was, I've given her a
lot of free medical advice in
return and I think, you know,
I figure that was worth
a few more free gifts before
she leaves here. But
anyway, she has been a joy
to work with. <She is> part of our
pandemic cohort
and that we are definitely gonna
miss her and you have made a
great contribution to the
state in helping
us to have deep
compassion. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Hickey, Senator
Woods.
Thank you,  Mr.  President and,
and
Senator mckenna.
We've been, I've been
with you for a lot of it and
against you on some of it
and I guess that's
just the way this deal works.
But we've, we've done a
lot on them horses.
We, we, uh,
we rode hard
and didn't get
to the finish line. But I
golly,
we, uh, we tried
and I've met a lot of your
constituents
during those trips
and, and I thank
you for the diligence that you
did in that.
Um, I'm
afraid that me and
my barn cats couldn't
support your co
bill.
Uh,
we,
we love you, my
dear. Thank you for
being here.
Thank you, Senator Woods. We have
Senator Steinberg followed by Senator
Lopez and Senator
Morris. Senator Rodriguez and
rounded it off with Senator Tallman
and Senator Shino.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Um, Brenda, I'll keep it simple.
You have integrity
and, and you kept
it and you're leaving with
it and, uh,
I'm gonna miss that
and, uh, whoever replaces
you, that, that
will be the deepest shoes they have to
fill is,
is, is operating with the
same integrity
that you have every day with
every vote. I think Senator Hickey
said it wonderfully about,
about you. And
uh and of course, we share a
deep love of the environment
and the planet and you've
been a real ally on all those
issues and spoke
some amazing truths on this
floor when we had some of the most
incredible debates
that were profound
and, and
you know what they are. And
anyway, we'll love you and we'll
miss you and only happy for your
future. And uh and I
hope you mentor
your, whoever
takes a seat to operate
with the same integrity
as you know, that's the most
important thing
here. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Brenda. Thank you, Senator
Steinborn, Senator
Lopez.
Thank you,  Mr.
President,
Senator.
You are a
mujer
Kanas.
You are a woman of
strength.
You are a woman with
passion.
You are a woman
who sticks to what
she believes
in
and you have
patience.
You dealt with us during the
pandemic as
caucus
chair.
It was a new world for all of
us because we
weren't in person,
but you kept your
calm. You
kept the cool.
You called some of us out of
order and into
order. You did a
phenomenal
job
where your dreams are taking
you.
I wish you the
best and
I know you're gonna kick some, you know
what?
You have friends
here.
I am here to help in any way that
I can.
I still have your cell
number. You have
mine
to lose a strong woman. On this
floor,
but knowing that you are moving
on to another
endeavour
that strength is going to carry
you.
Love you.
Thank you, Senator Lopez, Senator
Morris. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Brenda.
Um
You know, in a lot of ways, your
COVID class got kind
of the shaft. Um
because the first two years
we had a unusual
session, so I didn't get the chance
to know you. I think it was the
third year before I ever saw you without a
mask. And then this
year you had to be
masked up again and miss
so many of our hearings.
And, uh, as mentioned before,
when we did the, my, my
earlier, I've, I've always been passionate
about animal welfare issues and you
brought up the coyote killing, uh
uh contest
that
Senator Woods was much more
gracious to you than he has
been to me over the years.
I guess he left the very
first bill I ever passed mister
President when you were in the chamber was
how to deal with animal
animal rights. It had to deal with.
At the
time, the law said that we
had to auction off
service animals, service
dogs from the police department
or corrections and a
constituent uh, animal
protection service brought that to
me. And that's when I
first started, I was
always an animal lover and that's when I first
started, um, uh,
passionately fighting for animal
rights in this chamber,
uh getting partisanship
and everything else is something I believed in.
That was the very first bill I ever passed.
Second Major Bill was
partnering with, uh, Jeff
and, and you on the Coyote
killing contest.
And then of course, you
become a senator and
we didn't get a chance to actually meet
in person for those two
years. Um, but
when animal protection voters,
I think they reached out either to me first
or you first or both of us
simultaneously. I was like,
that is perfect. Let's let's
partner on the bestiality
bill. We were one of two states that
didn't outlaw bestiality,
believe it or not. And it just
made sense. And you and I
worked together,
got that done, uh, very
easily. As a matter of fact, after
all these years, um,
and then this year, uh, working
with Senator Stewart
Ivy Soda, we were able to help,
um, the horses, um,
to make sure they weren't being slaughtered.
So that's something I'm very proud of you
and you were there the whole
time and you've been
such a great,
um, advocate
for animal rights like
III, I think that's part of
my legacy also here
in this chamber and not worrying about
partisanship. And you've been such
a great, gentle lady
this whole time and I just really
appreciate that. I do
wish you nothing but best,
uh, in your future endeavors. Maybe you'll
tell me someday what you're gonna do.
I, I've been hounding you for that.
Um, but I really do wish you
nothing but the best. It's been a
pleasure to get, you know,
better. Um, I
guess the last session and a half
because those first two sessions really
were robbed with us and you
guys didn't have a chance as your
freshman class to really
get to appreciate what this chamber
really can be. So, uh,
those who are staying, hope to
take advantage of that,
uh, and start reaching out across
the aisle and try to develop those
relationships because this chamber
can be uh very
rewarding. And I do consider
you a good friend and you are
passionate and you're gonna do
wonderful things in your future
life. God bless.
Thank you, Senator Moore's rounding
things off for us. We'll have Senator
Rodriguez followed by Senator
Tollman and Senator
Sino. Thank you,
Mr.  President. I to
stand in support and
honoring our
friend, our great Senator
Brenda mckenna.
Um You know, Brenda, you are
truly so nice, always
very quiet, calm
and just a great
spirit. Um
And I just appreciate that
very much, especially around here where
we know we're always so rushed and
under tremendous stress. You're
always very calming and good.
Um I do have
to agree though during the
pandemic, as Senator Wirth
mentioned when you were
the chair of the
caucus chair and
having to get
to us through zoom and so
on. I didn't even know
what Zoom was in the
beginning. I don't, well, many of us probably
didn't because we didn't have it.
But I remember when they said
that we were gonna get a Zoom
link. So what on earth
is that on top of everything else we're
going through here with this pandemic?
But Here it goes, Brenda and you
show up really calm
in the zoom and, uh,
just helping us
all and some
braves can be, you
know, that's really, really
something I, I was amazed
to see how you, how you
handled that. I don't
think I could have done nearly
as good a job as you
did. But one thing I
remember  Mr.
President about Brenda is
that she is
always
looking around to see
where she can pick
up the stuff that
others leave behind to
recycle, just
taking care of our earth, our
things cleaning
as we've talked before
Brenda. Um,
and she just, she's not
afraid she'll go and pick up anybody
else's stuff that they
leave there and take them over to the
recycle bin and separate them.
If she finds a little pile of rubbish,
she'll separate the things
and just so that she can recycle
some things and save trees
or something else
here in our, in our
great uh earthen
area that we're in.
And, um, anyway,
I can just go on and on
talking about the about
how much I've learned from Brenda
being so, uh was
from being quiet and
calm and gentle all
the time. Too bad. You're
with us for such a short
time, but our friendship
will last forever and
my respect for you and,
and my honour for you is just,
will just go on always.
Just remember that. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Brenda. Thank you Senator
Roga Senator
to.
Well, thank you,  Mr.  President. I stand
in strong
support of this
certificate.
The first time I met
Brenda was she
invited me to have coffee
and, uh,
it was several years before I
got out of the elected
to the Senate and
she of course, wanted to
talk to me about
her
animals. I forget
exactly what the issue was.
But I was really
very impressed with
her strong
advocacy
and uh love for
animals. So
Brendan and I are both
graduates of Syracuse.
And so I always hold a
special place
in my heart for fellow
graduates of Syracuse
since Syracuse
has meant so much to me
in so many ways,
I won't bore you with the reasons
why. So we, we have
a special bonding over
that.
And um
yeah, she, she's, I
have a always
admired her for her strong
efficacy for,
for um
animals. And
I always felt I
sat, I sat next
to Brenda
in the spack
and oh,
so kind
of guilty when I
voted
opposite of her,
which wasn't very often,
but
I was felt
kind
of,
I almost felt
bad uh
because I know she
was so such a strong
supporter of the
position opposite
mine.
And um
so I
and I, I admire her
for her strong advocacy
for, for
and not only animals, but what
other people have said at
her,
her passion for the less
fortunate.
So
I look forward to learning about
the next phase of Brenda's
life. I have a feeling that it's gonna
be something really special
and something pretty exciting.
So I look forward to learning
about, um,
your next moves and I, I'm
sure it's gonna be something pretty
special and wonderful and I
wish you the very best. Thank
you. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Collman, Senator
Shino.
Thank you, Mister President. I too
Rice in support of the
certificate
and, uh
recognizing our, our, our Pueblo
sister, uh,
from the, from Naan Bay.
You know, when I came into
the Senate, I was the first Pueblo.
Uh Brenda was the second
and I'm alone
again, uh, and so
forth, but tremendous
courage. II, I first met
Brenda, you know, during her work with
the congresswoman.
Um, and, and doing all the
work in, in, in, in that
district
and it's
just a strong
pueblo woman, you know, strong
convictions
and, and, and the courage,
you know, to come in and run for
caucus chair. I, you
know, I mean,
I, I guess her love for animals
taught her how to her cats, you know,
and, and, uh, you know,
I'm trying to, you know, be in our
caucus chair during the
time of COVID talked about,
you know, and it was just
different, you know, I think
all of us that came in into
this, you know,
building together
can talk about that.
But for that class,
it's just hard,
you know, we never got to interact
in a way that I think many of us
did when we were able
to bring our extended
families and
in our, our communities to,
to be a part of that celebration
and, and that's part of it, you know, that
I think it's always hard,
you know, because it's almost,
that was taken away
and, and, and so forth.
But, you know, you've
been a great
colleague, you
know, and, um,
every time I, I'm, I'm
driving up, you know, there's,
uh, I, I look at those horses
and I think about Brenda,
you know, past San Felipe, I
look for the ride and there's a
few horses and, uh,
Brenda mckenna and, and
trying to do
her thing to protect their
animals. So,
you know, animals and
hats, you know, I, I think
that's, uh, Brenda
and, and, uh, wish you well
with your new endeavour
and I hope you continue to do
all you can on behalf of, of,
of the people that, that you love so
much. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator
Shino, Senator
Gonzalez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Um, I know that
all the beautiful
words have already been taken
and said, but they're well
deserved
and we are gonna miss
you. But, um, for
the members, her and I
have had a, an
ongoing little joke
for quite some time.
And those of you that travel
north, there was this little
restaurant called
Sugars
and, uh, everyone
loved Sugars. It was just
an excellent little place to
stop, including
5000 motorcyclists
that would stop there all the
time.
And so they
had a sign for
sale
and we kept saying, well, let's
put our junior money into that
and let's buy sugars.
And so it went back
and forth and, um,
so up to now
it's, it's all shut
down and, you know, it's
not the same without having
that little popular
little place to eat except
though also that
the food was so delicious, you
know, especially their,
but we say, well, sugars
closed down because we didn't help
them. The junior money didn't go
through. So
anyway, uh the best of
luck and thank
you for being a good friend
and being with us. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator
Gonzalez.
Send the
compost.
Thank you very much,  Mr.  President,
members of the Senate, as you can
tell, there's
definitely a lot of love and
respect here in the
State Senate
and um with
Brenda, I just
close with this to each and
every one of you as we
were listening
to the description
of a fine lady,
Senator Brenda mckenna,
a loving leader,
making sure every
voice in their
own language is heard.
Our environment is clean
and animals are
protected.
Ladies and gentlemen, join
me in
congratulating
Bren,
my
oh
Senator
mckenna,
oh  Mr.  President
and colleagues.
Um
I've never cried on the floor
and I wasn't expecting this.
So
uh you
hit, you hit me hard, but you
hit me good. So,
um thank you.
I,
I know that we're getting late
but I, I do
have a
couple of ideas. I'd like to
share with president and
uh my
colleagues.
Pardon
me?
Um My very first
visit to the
roundhouse when I was,
I was a citizen lobbyist
and
new resident to New Mexico.
I have been gone for about 12
years
and my co
my new neighbours are
telling me how
accessible
New Mexico legislators
are compared to other
states.
And,
and I later on, I said
I can relate to that
because
approximately nine years
ago,
I was roaming
the Senate leadership
halls. I was
looking for
Senator Peter
Wirth
and I
found him,
you see, I was advocating
for the bill. We've been talking
about this today.
It was scheduled to be in
heard in the committee
and I just wanted to gauge his
support for it
because people told me you got to go see
Peter.
So
what I was so impressed is
that he didn't
shoo me
away.
Um
He spoke with me
and
engaged in my
advocacy.
Uh
I'll never forget
Pat
and Senator Morris and
Steinborn. I've mentioned this
today, but the
two of you were so
terrific
to work with when I was that citizen
lobbyist
and
you cosponsor that
legislation. And now it's
law,
Mr.  President and
colleagues,
I think of our role
title of
Senator.
The
following
the difference we have
for our constituents in
our state is
that we have more
responsibility,
more
responsibility.
It's not just a
title.
Yeah. So in
that vein,  Mr.  President and
colleagues, I've always
reminded myself
as I was taught by my
re my elders of the
pueblo, always
be and remain
humble.
And so if any of us are not there
yet strive to do
so
as public servants, we need
to be the humblest of
them all.
Um Senator
Burke,
I will continue to develop
our radio,
digital
radio, subscriber
fees bill
um in the interim
so that you can help it. So
sure
soar to the finish
in 2025
Senator Woods,
I will continue to work on
our free warming horse
bill. I have a
assurance from the governor's
office
this year and
I hope you'll consider
possibly working
with my successor in
2025.
Um
Set her compost.
I look forward to receiving
voice
lessons.
Um geni with your
respect.
Now we were
to
me
not MBITA
E
ITO,
I mean he
won't.
Konda
Waha
do Yang.
Thank you, President and
colleagues.
Thank you, Senator
mckenna.
Thank you, Senator
mckenna,
Senator Pete Campos.
Thank you very much,  Mr.
President. Members of the
Senate. They
the last is
really not
last
whenever we recognize each
other, whether you be at the
first of the line or towards
the back or
if you will, even sometimes
in the middle,
each voice that is
heard is important.
And the last individual
tonight that we are going to
recognize
his voice definitely is
clear,
very responsive
and one that we all
look forward to listening
to right
now. So
if I may,  Mr.
President, what I'm going to do
is to turn it
over to uh
Senator Gallegos
and let him between
him and you then
start the proceedings
for the
esteemed state
Senator Greg
Sms. Senator
Gallegos, please. Thank you, Senator
Campos.
Mr.  President. If I could start
the introduction, then we'll go
to reading the certificate.
I have the
great honour to present
today. A very
good friend of mine,
Dr Greg.
Senator Dr Greg
Sms wanted to just give a little
bit of background to the body
in about 2016
or 2017. He
was an expert witness for
me in the house
and he came in and I've worked
with other doctors, other
people that would help us as
expert witnesses, but
we really became friends
because of the knowledge
and his compassion for what he
does. Uh I had never
met anyone that was really
truly 100%
body and to be able to
explain what he
does and what he knows
to the people around him.
Uh
We, we were able
to
watch him in the Senate
or in the house, then we came
over here to the Senate. But when
he was in the house, it was extraordinary
to be able to hear him
debate, the
knowledge that he has. I've seen him
study the time that
he takes on a bill,
the passion that he has
even in, in the study part of
it. Uh So is he
was in House district 22
for two years. Uh Between
18 and 20. Then
when we came over to the Senate
in 2019,
we came over together. We've
been here the four years. I
actually expected
him to stay
longer than I would
because, uh, he's
got some real
talent,  Mr.
President buddy. I, I just want to
let you know even during
COVID, uh he
has over 88,000
followers on
Facebook.
He would give classes
during COVID
about the mask, about
COVID about
medications. I
got caught up in
watching him on
Facebook and my
wife and girls would watch
and I thought it was so incredible
because as a doctor,
he not only took care of his
practice, but he
took care of people
in the, in the Facebook
world. Um
I do want to say though before we
read the, the
certificate that I'm very
proud of him.
Um His
wife homeschools her
four girls and four
boys. Kelly
does an extremely
great job with their kids. They
come into into this chamber
and they're well behaved and very
knowledgeable. I met
him at the mall in Ha, in
Albuquerque and they
come up and shake hands
and speak. Uh, so
he's got an incredible
family.
But my
thought, just my
thought,
Doctor Senator,
Doctor Schmidty's,
if I had eight kids
at home,
I'd stay in the
chamber.
Mr.  President. Can we have
the certificate
written?
Thank you, Senator Gallegos.

Senator David M
Gallegos, Mimi
Stewart President Pro
TEM Sherri de
Lujan, chief clerk, New Mexico
State Senate. Thank
you to our readers, Senator
Gallegos,  Mr.  President,
I'll yield to the body.
Thank you, Senator
Baca.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you Senator Gallegos for
sponsoring this
certificate.
Um You know, it
has just been my honour to
know uh, um
Senator Schmidty's and
I'm gonna yet
lay another title
at his foot if he'll
accept it. And that would be
Senator Doctor
Greg Smee's
Esquire.
I think we've heard some of
our most eloquent
testimony
and argument from
the good doctor thought
out different.
I always, I always
think when I'm sitting here
listening to him that
as attorneys, we
believe it or not regurgitate
a lot of the same argument,
we go back to what we know
back to the statutes.
But his unique
perspective
gives us a different view
on argument, a
different way
of thinking
a different way forward
and I really appreciate
that about him.
The other thing that I'll say about
our good doctor Senator
here is that,
um, he
leads you in the right
direction. Um,
if I'm ever feeling
really great about myself
and what a good job I
did and what a good
person I am. I
can always go to Doctor
Schmidty's to bring me
back to earth
because this man has a moral
compass, like few people
I've ever met in my
life and should
be and is a
model for my own life
and how I look
to act and treat
people and conduct
myself in
society, uh, with
his good natured humour,
humour, his love
of people, and most of all his love
for God and
family. And that's
all I have. Thank you. Thank you,
Senator Baca. We have Senator Moors
followed by Senator Woods and Senator Brand
to start
off.
Thank you, Mister President.
You would think a
doctor would know
how eight
Children. I mean, come on. You would
think after a while you would know a
doctor. How that
works.
This
Greg, you are, you are a true
gentleman. And, um, you
know, I probably have, uh, behind
closed doors, probably the mo more
salty of language in
this chamber.
And you, uh,
whenever I look up and I see
it's you, I'm like, oh, no, I did
it again. One of these days
I'll learn and maybe I
got one more day left and maybe
I'll learn. Um, but you,
you've been for the
last 6.5 years knowing you
6.5 years, I think.
Um, you really,
what Senator Baca said
you are, you're really
one of the true intellects, uh,
out here and you've
been an absolute pleasure. You've helped me
on a personal level. Um,
and I know you have done that. You've
stepped up when a number of people in this
chamber needed your expertise
as a doctor. And you've
helped my wife out and you've helped my baby
out. You've helped me out. Uh And
I know, and you've helped a lot
of other members of this
chamber in the same way.
And you've always helped, not
only with your knowledge but
your guidance. You're
truly a one of those North
stars that
you, you know what's right
in your heart and you know what's
wrong and you cannot
deviate from that path.
And I respect that and too
often in politics, uh,
we deviate from our
path and I've
never seen you do that
and that is something we all should
respect and know.
And you were walking out of
here, your head is
held high and you've
done the people of New Mexico.
You've done your family
proud and you've done yourself
proud and I'm proud to
be your friend. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Moore, Senator
Woods.
I think  Mr.  President,
you know, all I can say
is big
brain
any time you got a brain
like that,
man, you got something
and he can just lay
things out as well as
any attorney I've ever
seen. He lays
his argument out
and if you can poke a hole on
it, just try it.
And, and sir, I'm
just so happy to serve
in this chamber with you.
And really,
it's been my pleasure,
sir. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Woods,
Senator
Brand.
Thank you,  Mr.
President
Dr Smitty is one
honour.
My honour. It has been to serve
with you
an honour to call you a friend
even before
that,
you know, uh,
I respect
you and
you know, my, my wife yesterday,
text me while you were speaking
and said, man,
he's preaching a
sermon
and, you know, you're
never bashful about your
faith
and I appreciate
that,
appreciate
what you've done for us on this
floor and
we will mess
your,
just the way you come
at bills is so
different.
And I said there going,
man, why didn't I think of that
argument?
But all of us think
differently and all
of us come at things differently
and, uh,
we're gonna mess you, we're gonna mess your
presence. Um, but
next year when I get sick because
I will get sick every year, I'll
be calling you.
Um, because, uh,
I'll probably get bronchitis
again like I do up here every
year. Um But,
you know, during COVID, when
my daughter-in-law almost
died,
you stepped
in and helped me a lot and you helped
her. And I just
want to thank you for
that.
Most people don't really know
about that.
Um, but you were there
for my family
when we needed you. And
so I thank you for that
personally,
your great friend
and we will mess you up
here. Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you, Senator Braton. Senator
Pirtle.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And, uh, you know, it's been a
pleasure serving with Senator
Schmid's because
sometimes if I'm not paying
attention, which is most of
the time, uh,  Mr.
President and he votes.
No, I can count on whatever
reasoning he's come up with
that. I probably think
the same way. So it's safe
for me to raise my hand
as well and, and walk
over to the good doctor and be like,
why'd you vote? No,
but increase government? Ok.
Good, good. All right. Then that's
why I voted no or,
um, you know, it's, it's an
appropriation and then we're just spending too
much money. Ok. Yeah, that sounds
pretty good to me too. All right. So
that's why I voted no.
Um, and so it's, it's
been a pleasure just
serving with him. And,
um, you know, one thing I think
that we should all take note from
Doctor Sms is how many
times his chair
sits empty
and this
place can very easily take
you away from the things that are really
important. And Dr Schmidty's never
let that happen,
whether it was work,
you know, important surgeries
or time with the
kiddos or whatever it
was. This place wasn't
number one
priority on his list all
the time.
And so for those that are sticking around,
just remember that, that it's
ok not to be in your chair,
it's ok not to come up here. It's
ok to prioritize
other things
whenever it's not really
hot button issues in this
building. And I, I
think that's probably the 11
thing I take away that is free
throw shooting is, is
horrible.
Um,
but
he's, when he's in his chairs,
there's nobody better and when he's not,
there's always a great reason and I
think that's, that's what I respect
him the most for.
And, you know, he's actually a celebrity
in Roswell and, and it's
not for being a doctor.
Uh, how many people that come up
to me? He's like, do
you know Senator Schmidty's? I'm like,
I, I do, he's like, oh, I
follow him on
youtube or I can follow
him on Facebook or
whatever. And I, I think more
people know him in Roswell than,
than know myself or, or
any of the other legislators
from there, which is, is quite
funny and quite interesting. But
it is, it, it has
been a great four years.
I know when he was in the house, I didn't know him
quite that well. But,
um, you know, I'm, I'm gonna
miss you, but of
course we're not gonna, we're not gonna let
leaving this place take away
from the friendship.
Um, and, and
hopefully one of these
days you can make it down to the dairy
farm, get that raw
milk that you asked me about
way too often.
Um, but would
be happy to, to show you where milk
comes from.  Mr.  President and
Senator.
Um,
and you know,
II, I think,
um, this place is gonna
miss you when you pull that scalpel
out and just dissect these
bills and just
cut them up. You know, it's,
it's gonna be something that's gonna be missed
and, and I know I'm gonna miss sitting
there paying attention and listening
to you because there's few senators that when
they talk, I pay attention
and you're one of them.
Thank you, Senator
Pirtle,
Senator Wirth, followed by Senator
Hickey, Senator TC Pino, Senator
mckenna and Senator
Steinborn. Senator Wirth. Uh
Thank you,  Mr.  President
is one of the
fellow members of this
chamber who came from the other
chamber. Uh It's
always interesting as folks
come over. Uh,
you, you just don't know exactly
what you're gonna get and I'll be
honest, Senator Sms,
uh I had the sense you were coming in a
little hot when you came
over just again
from the times that you
served in the house it was
pretty darn hot and it
just was a different world. But
I have very much appreciated
having you in this chamber. And we've
joked about the fact that
you and I sometimes will come
so far to either side that we
end up in the back end,
working together on something.
And that's a good thing.
That is a really good thing.
Uh It is
an incredible
appreciation for what
you have done to be here in this
chamber and to give
us and to give the state four
years of service
and we appreciate it a bunch. And
I just want to say thank you.
Thank you, Senator Senator
Hickey.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Uh, kind of ironically
in the certificate. I want to
congratulate us here in
the Senate as
we are, uh, with
Dr Sme's
departure,
uh, helping to solve,
uh, one of the great crises
we're having in the state and that's the
doctor shortage because he's
going back to full-time work as
a physician. And I
tell you, the people in the community
are really gonna love
that. Um,
I, I also want
you to note that, uh,
being a, a fellow
physician, I'm gonna miss
you very much in that
regard. And,
um, you know, we haven't always
agreed you're kind of,
uh, over on the other side of the
mountain from where I am
and, and we have
looked at things differently in different
committees, but I've always
appreciated your,
your intellect and,
and, and that confirms
what I hear from my colleagues
in the, in the private
medical community. They
have great regard for
you and your ent
surgical skills. And I
don't know that everyone here
knows that, but he is a highly
regarded ent
surgeon in
Albuquerque. So
go back and do great things
there. Um I, I'll miss
the debates here and
maybe not. But
um anyway,
oh and, and lastly, I wanna,
I do have to say you
saved my life. Um,
about 2.5
weeks ago, I had a wound
infection after a mose surgery
on my leg. And it
was getting pretty, it looked
like it was gonna turn into an
overwhelming cellulitis.
So I thought, you know, maybe something's
wrong here and he happened to be out in the
garage and I said, hey, will you
look at this and he just
very calmly in the way he
talks and thinks he just
kind of said, dude,
what's the matter with you?
You need to be on
antibiotics and get that
thing. And anyway, I,
I did the next day
and, and it's doing very well,
but I want to thank him
for that little bit of free
doctor advice.
So anyway, all the
best in your endeavors
and I will miss
you in the committees in the chamber.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator Pino. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. And
I, I just marvel at
the, at the
energy and the efforts you
put into the research on the
bills that we have come before
us. Insect. I
mean, not
just what, what does the
bill say, but what
did the researchers in Sweden
or France or,
you know, Johns Hopkins,
what do they say about it? Uh
It, it, it's brought a
remarkable dimension to our
discussions and, and I want to
thank you for that, but mostly
what I want to tell you is, I think the
real Greg Schmied
comes out when your kids are
here. It, it is,
it's just so beautiful to
see you and your and your
sons or your, your, your
kids uh interact.
Uh I, I just II
I know you're a great
father and
it, it, it comes out in
just the pride you have in your Children
and the love that radiates from
you for them. Uh It's
beautiful to watch and thank
you. Thank you for being such a great
example here. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator Tinno,
Senator
mckenna.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
And I too want
to give my high
regard to
Senator
and
Dr Schmid's. I got to work
with him in the
wonderful
committee
sack and I to
marvel at
his, his
adept at all these
facts and yet I
know he's got, he's a full
time medical
doctor. So I was just always
marvelling at
his, his, his
ability to,
to do the research
and to really
give us pause
and careful
consideration for each
bill. And
all I ask, um,  Mr.
President and colleagues is
that you welcome
Senator Moore, Senator
Schmid and I, when
we return as citizen
lobbyists for
animal rights
bills,
thank you.
Thank you, Senator
mckenna, Senator
Steinborn, followed by Senator Burke and
Senator Avis Soto. Thank you,  Mr.
President Greg. I
want to say something similar to you
that I said about um,
Brenda. Um
I really admire your
integrity and
I really admire your
consistency.
You know, you are a true believer
and you were consistent
and that is integrity
man, whether we agree or
not. I love it. I
love that and I love that
about you. And
uh Jerry Ortiz, he's
talked about doing research so
hard to argue with a guy who starts
quoting the Helsinki Institute.
You know, it's like, oh gee
uh well,
all right. I don't know about that research
but uh at my point
of view, but anyway, and I
really respect
also your
um several,
several policy positions,
but your embrace of
transparency, ethics
reform, you were an ally,
a bipartisan ally in those
things which I really
appreciate and I'm gonna miss
um
and uh and I appreciate
your uh feeling the burn too, your
little burn thing that
happened here at the end and
supporting these
good things to
help patients out and,
you know, as a provider,
you know, we know that's where you're coming from.
And those uh I think you're
you're one of the most respected voices
in the body on that, that we're of
course, also gonna miss.
So I wish you well, my
friend, it's been a pleasure
serving with you. Thanks  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Steinborn
Sander Burt,
thank you,  Mr.  President. And
uh, Greg Smedes is
who I want to be when I grow
up. He's,
uh, I mean, he cuts through
steel like a hot
knife through butter. He is just
an amazing guy.
And, you know, when I
talk or debate I get a little
passionate and,
and I know even the president
is kind of said,
back off there a little bit. Burt,
you're getting a little, um, you know,
but Speedy's is like, he's so
even keeled
but it's not so much his
temperament when he,
when he's debating or
talking, it's the
content that this guy
has. He's absolutely
amazing when he
gets up to debate any
subject, uh, and over
and above all that. What I really
appreciate is
he, he is
so involved with his kids. I
mean, he, he brings
them in well dressed. They're
like little adults
and, and it's not that they're
geeks or anything like that and
it's not that they're, they're,
you know, kind of outcasts
or, or wild kids or anything
like that. They're just like
normal kids
and they're all involved
in activities and all this stuff.
I, I can guarantee you if,
if all eight
of them have some kind of schedule
of whatever activity he's going to
know when it is what it is
and, and whether or not he
could be there. Uh,
he's just an amazing,
amazing guy. I, I
so much appreciate
everything that he brings
to this chamber and we are
definitely gonna miss you,
Greg, not just
your debate, but your
friendship and
your ability to
channel through the sharks.
And so we really
appreciate you very much
best wishes and God
bless you. Thank
you, Senator Burt, Senator
Aviato.
Thank you very much,  Mr.
president,
you know, it's,
first of all, there's
something to be just
naturally appreciated by someone
who is both
deadly serious
and who
never loses his sense of
humour.
Um, at the same
time
and, and both of
those are always
present and
sitting next
to you,
Senator Schmid's.
Um, I know that
because, because we're
always trading comments
back and forth
and, and laughing
even in the midst of really
serious discussions
about things and even while both
of us, each of us is being very
serious about something and,
and, and while we're being very serious
about things where we're not
agreeing,
we're able to
laugh
with each
other,
disagreeing
politically
and enjoying each other as
humans.
And it's just been one of the
most wonderful experiences
for me sitting next to
you.
Um It is,
it is also,
and I, and I, you know,
I uh shared
this experience a couple
of years ago when my seat
was back there
uh during
COVID, but I'm gonna share it
again, which is,
which is when I came down with
diverticulitis.
And, and
I
woke up on a Saturday morning,
I could not move. I had
a very difficult
Friday night. I was,
it was pain I had never
experienced before.
And, um,
and Paula,
our sergeant at
arms
came to see me that morning. She
called you, you were, you were at
home. And as
soon as you heard that there's something wrong
with me, you
immediately told her,
let me get dressed, I'll drive right
over and you drove
over to where I was here in Santa
Fe.
And,
uh, and,
and my pain was in my abdomen. And,
and so you came in and you,
and, and this is during the height of COVID
and, and so you, you came
in and you said, ok,
listen, Daniel,
I'm gonna ear, nose, the throat guy. So that's a little
bit further south from what I'm used
to looking at.
But, you know, uh, let
me see what I can do.
Uh, nonetheless, to at least get you
stabilized. The good news
is as you, you tell me as we
know, it's not COVID because that doesn't
exist.
And,
uh, and
so,
uh,
but the, you know,
but, but you got me stable,
you got me stable as you could.
And then, and then he said, listen, you
know, I'm gonna call a couple of colleagues
who deal with the abdominal area,
see if I can figure out what's going on. I
gotta go to committee, I'll
try to be back in a few hours. But
if you just pray hard enough, it'll
all go away.
And, uh, and,
and so, you know, sure
enough. I, you know,
somebody else came by later and I ended up in
the emergency room and, and
things, it, it did finally go away.
But, but nonetheless, you were there for
me as a friend if nothing
else. Uh, and,
uh, and I know that if I ever have an
ear, nose or throat problem,
who to call,
uh, you're the person for
that. Uh, and,
uh, but also I
know that if I have any
problem as a friend, you
will always be there for
me. And I just
want to thank you for
that.
Thank you, Senator Risotto,
Senator
Brantley.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I
love hearing these remarks
about Greg Schmidty's because I think
they are so accurate.
I have never
seen, there are very
rare
examples of
integrity that
actually serve in the legislator.
And you were one of those rare
examples, Greg.
It is, it's, you
make this look so
easy because you
have purpose
and you are driven and you
are disciplined
and your beliefs
and it's, it's looks so easy
for you and, and, and I, I
envy that about you.
You, you know, you are
what you believe in
and you are such an
example of,
of just what like
living with
integrity looks
like and you are gonna be
miss for that reason.
You will be so
greatly miss, we need 100
more of you, you know, just
principled and, and, and
purposed. And I will tell
you, you
can tell a lot about
someone by their kids
and you have raised
the the most
polite,
happy. You have such a
happy, sweet
family. You were such a good dad,
Greg that as much as
I want to beg you to stay
here. I don't
blame you at all for
leaving and, and our loss
is their gain and so you
go enjoy it all. Thank you so
much. It is really, it
really has been an honour,
serving with you. You will be missed.
Thank you. Thank you, Senator
Brantley, Senator
Gallegos. Thank
you, Bobby. I appreciate all the
kind words. I, I
wanted to close just by
saying, um,
uh, Doctor
Sme's helped my mom
before she passed
and it was incredible because
you could talk to him
about what she had
and he could manoeuvre
her. It was something in her
ear. Some
pieces were floating
out, causing her
ial and he was able
to do it in one setting
by just maneuvering
her. So I see
that you've done this for other people around
the, the Capitol and I
appreciate you.
And it's been an honour
to work with you and,
and to know you all these years.
But now I'd ask our members
to help me show our
servant leader
Senator Dr Greg
Smets. Esquire
our love in this chamber.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Meeting
before I leave mister President.
I better tell you all how to say my
last
name.
Dids Munos have it right
the whole time.
Oh my God,
Senator Brand knows it,
but he might be the only
one in the
chamber.
Well,  Mr.  President, it's,
it's Smay like
Mercedes.
Uh as you can tell, I
don't really care what, what you call
me so
I'm used to
it.
Um You know,
I um what,
what do I say?
Um I, I
do, you know, we, I hear
a lot of comments about,
you know, my, the,
the privilege that I have
to, to be a doctor
and you know,
I, I remind myself
of, I just,
I just love that medicine
is, is so pure, it's
not as
messy and,
you know, crazy as
politics and III
I love being
able to
connect with
people.
Um and
uh on, on a, on a
health level and
I just wish all of
you the best, the best health,
the best success. God bless
you and your
families.
Um
And you
know, when,
um when I'm just out in
the community in my district
and it's about to
be, you know, sessions
coming up, I get a lot of
comments about,

it's how, how do you do
that? It must be crazy and all
this stuff. And I say, you
know what? It's, it's
honestly not because
there's actually there is just
so many good
people up
here in, in the
roundhouse and in the
Senate and I
just stress that to people
and, and you know, they really, when they
hear me say that they,
they, they really do get
encouragement for the people that
can't really come up here and
see um a
lot of what happens and get to
know us. Um,
and all of you,
um, you know, that that's what I
tell them about this place.
I say it's, it's, it's gonna be
really good and I'm really looking

that and so I'm glad I
can share that, uh
that positivity with my

and we'll see
what else comes in. Uh, with
that,  Mr.  President Unanimous Consent,
we go that our business third reading of
legislation. I yield to
Senator Rodriguez on number
two, House Bill 250
Senator Rodriguez. Thank you,
Mister President. I ask
unanimous consent of the Senate that the
records show that all action for
placing House Bill 253
on final passage has
been taken and that it is now
subject to debate, amendment or
substitution. No objection,
Senator Rodriguez to explain. Thank
you, Mister President. This
bill would establish a
trust fund for
capital outlay funding
so that we someday
will not be at the whim of
the revenues
moving up down
and in chaotic
ways. And so
that's really what it would
do. The risk that
our high um debt
capacity poses
to the state's bond
ratings and the
long term oil and gas
revenue declines and
the up and down that
we see all the time could
jeopardize the state's
ability to make new
investments in capital
projects and protect
and, and to protect its existing
assets. We discussed in
the LFC during
the interim,  Mr.  President
and uh decided that
this would be a good move to
set aside a trust
fund so that we
can generate some funds
uh through investment returns
and um hopefully
one day and not too
long from now, we will
be able to fund our capital
outlay uh
infrastructure
entirely through this fund.
That's all it does,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Rodriguez.
See no debate, Senator Rodriguez
to close on the bill.  Mr.  President.
I move that house Bill
253 do now pass
and I ask unanimous consent of the Senate
that the records show that the role
has been called and all those present
vote in the affirmative except those voting
in the negative by show of hands.
Senators, we are voting to your seats,
please. If you wish to vote.
No, please raise your
hand. Senator
Maestas is voting
now
explain my
vote.
I vote of 39 affirmatives
01 in the
negative house bill 253
as amended has passed the Senate.
Senator IES to explain his
vote. Thank you,  Mr.
President Senator, truly
appreciate what, what's being done
here. It's probably wise and
prudent, but I just
can't support continuously
putting more money in the
mattress
instead of spending it on building
an economy and a future for the State
of New Mexico. Thank you,  Mr.
President Senator
Rodriguez,
Senator Rodriguez. Oh,
yes. Thank you,  Mr.  President, members
of the Senate. We'll go on to the
next item on the calendar. That's item
number three and
I'll yell to Senator
Stewart.
Ok, thank
you,  Mr.  President. I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the record
show that all action for placing
house
bill.
236 your board
is not accurate.
Ok. 236
on final passage has been
taken. It is now subject to
debate, amendment or substitution.
Thank you, Senator Stewart. No
objection, Senator Stewart. If you'll explain
the bill, uh, thank you,
Mr.  President. So, uh this
will seem familiar to
you. You've already voted on a
version of this bill.
Um This allows
only certain
public employees
who've retired
by December
31 of last year to
return to work on a very
limited basis.
This is only for
safety issues.
So we're talking adult
correctional and detention
officers, juvenile
correction detention
officers, courthouse
security officers,
emts
paramedics,
firefighters,
public safety, tele
communicator, sheriff's
deputy state police
officers. The
two
added section
that the house
did on the floor was
to add
a CYFD
protective service
investigators
and peace officers
who are charged to
investigate and execute
warrants. So
this was Senator Brant's
Bill early
on
that bill seems to be stuck.
So this is the house bill coming
over and I stand for
questions. Thank you,
Senator Stewart.
See no debate,
Senator Stewart to close on the
bill.  Mr.
President, I move
that.
Oh, house
Labor
voters on your pink sheet.
Senator, it's on
here. Oh, thank
you.
House Labor veterans,
military affairs. Affairs
Committee. Substitute for House Bill
two thir 236.
Do now pass
and ask for Shahan.
Thank
you
senators. We are voting
on House Labor Ves and Milita
Affairs Committee. Substitute for House
Bill 236 is
twice amended if you wish to vote. No,
please raise your
hand.
Senator worth voting.
Now,
Senator Morris is thinking of
voting. No, Senator
Moore's voting.
No.
As long as we got it covered, I didn't
want
by a vote of 33 in the affirmative
two in the negative House
Labor Veterans, military
Affairs Committee. Substitute for House
Bill 2, 36 is twice
amended. Has passed the
Senate. Senator
Stewart.
Thank you,  Mr.  President, members
of the Senate. Thank you. We're going to go
on to the next item item number for
our house bill 165 is
amended and I'll yell
to
Senator
Stefanic.
Excuse me. I, I
apologize. I think it's Senator
Brantley, that's going to be doing
that. Senator
Brantley
House Bill 165. Senator
Brantley  Mr.
President. I ask unanimous consent
of the senate that the
records show that all action for
placing
house bill 165 is
twice amended amended
on final passage
has been taken, it is now subject
to debate, amendment and
substitution. See no
objections. Senator Brandley, if you'll explain
the bill. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. This bill
simply asks that
locally owned
community-based pharmacies
be appropriately reimbursed
for the cost of medications
that they must deliver to
their Medicaid patients
by M CS.
So we look on page, I want to
clarify that constituting what
that is, is community-based
pharmacy providers
are being reimbursed simply
for the cost of prescription
drugs. It also
requires the Department of
Health Care Authority to
set a fee schedule
in a, in a research
study. On page three. It
explains exactly who applies
for that. They must be open to the
public located in the state
of New Mexico and not
government owned.
In addition,
it places,
creates a fee
schedule of $10.30
a dispensing fee that does
not generate profits, profit
for the pharmacy. It simply
covers the cost of
dispensing the
prescription.
Mr.  President. If I may,
I'd also like to yield
to Senator
Campos for a few words. Thank
you. Just before I yield to you, Senator
Campos, I just want to explain that
the webcast is working, the
audio is working, the
board has gotten stuck. So
I just wanted to make sure that the
public knew that
the board is stuck and uh and
yet you can still view it through
Webcast Center Campos. Thank
you very much,  Mr.  President. Thank you
very much, Senator Diamond
Brantley, in essence,
as we think and talk
about this. Uh
According to the National Community
Pharmacists Association in
2014, there
were roughly 100 and 20 independent
community pharmacists in
New Mex pharmacies in New
Mexico by
2021. The number has
decreased to 59.
And so  Mr.  President, of
course, members of the Senate
in essence, what this would do
would help the small
pharmacies in our small
communities. Again, I
really commend Senator Diamond
Brantley for bringing this forward.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank you,
Senator Campos, Senator
Brantley.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. We stand for
questions.
See no debate, Senator
Branley to close on the bill.
Mr.  President, I move
that house
Bill 165 is twice
amended. Do now pass
and request
a
show of hands.
Thank you, Senators. We're voting
on
Senate,
We're voting
Senators
House Bill 165.
If you wish to vote, no, please raise your
hand
by a vote of 37 in the
affirmative zero in the negative house bill
165 as amended has
passed Senate Senator Brandley.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. We're
gonna go on to the next item. We're gonna
go on to
item number five, House Bill
29 and I'll yell to Senator
Rodriguez.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Let me just get my folder straightened
out here.
I ask unanimous consent to
the Senate that the records show that all
action for
placing
House Bill 29 on final
passage has been taken and that it is
now subject to debate, amendment
or substitution. There are no
objections, Senator Rodriguez. You'll explain
the bill. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
This is a bill we do annually
through the public project
revolving fund.
Um It is through the
New Mexico Finance
Authority and it's an
appropriations bill
and I am carrying this
legislation on behalf of the new
Mexico Finance Authority and it's
been endorsed by the interim
committee. And what it
does is it merely
moves 13 million from the
public project revolving fund
to three identified
funds in order to
match these with federal
funds. And we do this
every year to be able to get a
return from the federal
government, uh, of the
13,000,006 million.
It goes to the drinking water
state revolving fund
and it's all through. And
the new Mexico Finance
Authority NM FA and
2 million to the local government
planning fund
and 5 million to the
Cultural Affairs Facilities
Infrastructure Fund.
And that's all it does,  Mr.
Chair  Mr.  President. Thank
you. Thank you, Senator
Rodriguez.
See no debate,
Senator Rodriguez to close on the
bill.  Mr.  President.
I move that house bill 29
do now pass and I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the records
show that the role has been called in all
those present vote in the affirmative
except those voting in the negative.
I show of hints. Thank you, Senators.
We are voting to your seats,
please
by a vote of 36 in the affirmative
zero in the negative house
bill. 29 has passed the Senate.
Senator Rodriguez  Mr.
President members of the Senate.
Thank you. We're going to go on to item number
six and I'll yield to
Senator Steni
mister President. I ask unanimous
consent of the Senate that the record
shows that all action for placing
House Appropriations
and Finance Committee substitute
for House Bill 33
as twice amended
on final passage has been
taken and that it is now
subject to debate amendment
or substitution. No
objections. Senator, if you
explain the bill,
thank you, Mister President.
This is a prescription
drug transparency
bill. 22
other states have passed this
drug pricing transparency
legislation.
44% of New
Mexicans in a statewide
poll reported either not
filling a prescription or
rationing their medications.
The ever increasing cost
of prescription drugs is the
primary cost driver.
This drug transparency,
it's basically a report
will create more understanding
by decision makers and the
public of the price mechanisms
of drug manufacturers
have a deterrent pressure
on drug manufacturers
develop more trust and
partnership in New Mexico
among drug
pricing players as well
as business and
provide the informational basis
for the state based solutions
to lower drug costs.
The
appropriations was stripped
out 100,000 was
put into House Bill
two. The other
amendment deals with
changing the word
biologics to
biosimilars.
The supporters
included the Albuquerque Chamber
of Commerce, a <ARP>,
the American Health Insurance
plans,
um Social
workers, the
center on law and poverty and the
voices for Children. I'll stand
for questions are coming. Thank you,
Senator Stannis. Seeing
no debate.
We do have debate Senator
Schmidty's.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. I don't
need to um
uh I don't need for the sponsor
to yield, but I, I do just have a
couple of quick notes on
this bill.
Um I'm gonna, I'm certainly
gonna support the bill.
Um, by the way, I it
sounds like, uh, once
you get a send off, it almost sounds
like you need to be done. But,
um, but like I said,  Mr.  President,
I do have a couple of things. I just wanted to point
out, you know, in the title of the bill, it says
transparency.
Uh but on on page
10, it says
do not disclose
on page 11. It says shall
keep confidential
below that it says do not
disclose.
Page 12 shall
keep confidential. Page
13 do not
disclose
um and
page 14 do not
disclose.
Um And
so really
what I want to point out
um
is, is that
I, in my
view, this is transparency
for the government
to know some of the price
information,
but I I don't want any
of us to be fooled these drug
manufacturers.
They at all
cost.
They do not want
the sick people knowing
their prices ahead of
time. That would
just be devastating to that industry,
how they make money.
And that's the transparency
that I want to see. Not
transparency for the government
or for the office of
superintendent, but
transparency for the
patients.
We got to empower the
individual
and not be
looking at just
trusting the government with this
information.
And so I I just wanted to
say that we see a lot of do not
disclose, do not disclose, do not
disclose. It doesn't really seem
like like much of a transparency
bill, but once again, I don't want to
beat it up too much. I just want to
remind us that we
cannot, this
is not a bad bill. It's really
not a bad bill,
but I, I don't want
anyone thinking that, hey, we've
just got drug transparency
now in New Mexico.
Um, we, we've got a lot
more work to do. Thank you,  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Smedes.
Say no further debate,
Senator Stefani to
close mister
President. I move that
House Appropriations and
Finance Committee substitute
for House Bill. 33
is twice amended.
Do now pass anays
unanimous consent of the senate that
the record shows a role has been
called and all those
present vote in the affirmative
except those voting in the negative
by shelf hands. Senators. We are
voting to your seats, please. If you
wish to vote, no, please
raise your
hand.
I voted 37 in the affirmative
zero on the negative house appropriations
and finance committee. Substitute
for House Bill. 33 is twice
amended has passed the
Senate. Senator Stefani.
Um  Mr.  President, I'd
like to thank the members of the
Senate, but especially all the health
care professionals in the
audience. Thank you. We're

181 and I'll yell to
Senator Hickey.
Thank you,  Mr.  President

unanimous consent of the Senate
that the records show that all
action for placing
House Bill 181
on final passage has been
taken and that it is now

much,  Mr.  President. This
is a memorial that Senator
Brandt and I are bringing
forth tonight. Uh being
cosponsor with
the chair of the House Health
Committee, Liz Thompson and
Representative Stephanie Lord.
So it's a bipartisan
bicameral memorial.
Very important to study
medical therapeutic
silo Sibon
Mr.  President, which
is medical
mushrooms. It
turns out that
uh medical mushroom
silo sein has proven
to be medically
efficacious effective
um for the use of
major behavioural
health issues
and the Veterans
administration is studying it.
The FDA has twice ruled it a
breakthrough therapy.
Um and it can
help um alleviate
and be an alternative to
major antidepressant,
anti
antidepressant drugs and probably
other drugs that have serious side
effects and can bring real relief
to New Mexicans. And
for that reason, we're,
this memorial calls for the
state to look at that
data and to begin
to act on it and
to put politics aside
because this is about helping New
Mexicans. And with that mister
President and I'd love to
invite my cuss to say a few
words. Thank you, Senator
Steinborn.
Thank you,  Mr.  President. This actually
ties in really well with the last
bill that we just did, you know, I
first learned about these, these
mushrooms and I'm not even going to
try to say the name of them,
but actually
around the VA hospital
and reading
through some of the veterans emails
that I get, the
Veterans administration has taken
a very serious interest in
this along with the
FDA A looking at
treating veterans
with traumatic brain injuries
as well as PTSD
and several other
issues as
a way of, of treating those
disorders. This
has shown to actually be very
effective. It's, it's very
different as I've learned more and
more about it. Um
This is not a treatment that you
take on your
own once a day or once a
week or even once a month,
but it can be a treatment that's
done uh about once
every six months to every
year as needed.
And sometimes one treatment
is all that's needed to actually cure
someone of a traumatic brain
injury or of
PTSD. And so this
isn't actually a really exciting
cutting edge technology,
um that they are finding,
you know, a way to use these
mushrooms and, you
know, as a believer
and I, I think Dr Sme Smes
has talked about this a lot
lately, but, you know,
God seems to have provided
a cure and we
just need to figure out how to use that
cure. And I'm, I'm pretty
excited about the,
the work that the VA is doing
in this area as
well as as other mental
health practitioners,
especially when it comes to
treating traumatic brain
injuries and PTSD.
So I, I hope the body will join
us in asking the
Department of Health to join with U
and M to continue
to research this and see
how we can help to make
this a reality in our state. Thank
you,  Mr.  President. Thank you, Senator
Brandt. We do have debate on this.
We have Senator Pertell.
Thank you, Mister President. Will
either of the sponsors yield.
Senator Brandt.
I'm glad to yield Senator
Pirtle. Thank you, Mister President. How many
other states are already studying
this or have
perhaps legalized
this for, for the treatments that
you described?
Senator Mister
President? I know that Oregon has,
I'm not sure if any other states
have actually
started using this for
treatments, but I do know that
Oregon, I also
have Hopkins who's been doing
this research for about 10 years
now with the approval
of Theda and actually U and
M is already involved in, in doing
some of this research
and  Mr.  President, all that Colorado
just, just did it
and multiple
jurisdictions are decriminalizing
it. So,
thank you, Senator Steiner, Senator Pirtle
and thank you,  Mr.  President.
Um If Senator
Steinborn would yield, how, how
are these grown, how are they
harvested? Uh where,
where will they potentially come
from? I know this is just a study but
I, I'm sure that's the
research has already been
done,
Mr.  President Senator, as
far as, you know, in a medical
sense, I'm sure they'd be grown in a very
controlled way.
But, but it is a mushroom
and I don't know if that's what the
gentleman is getting at, but,
you know, they're grown in ways that mushrooms
are grown, but I'm sure that
includes hydroponic and
medians. And who
knows? I'm not an expert in
that. But, you know, I think the important
thing here though is that
because of the substance we're dealing
with from a therapeutic
medical standpoint, you want it to be
grown in a very controlled
scientific measured
way before you give it to people.
Senator Brett and Mister President.
You know, it's kind of interesting
after the committee meeting that we had
on these, I was actually
approached by a
company
that, that grows
mushrooms,
not these kind, but the
kind that you eat, uh
very interested
in uh as this
becomes uh
legal and
is, is used for medical
purposes into maybe moving
into that area as well and adding
that to his business.
So I think you'll see a lot
of that, uh because
the, the way that the mushrooms
are grown is pretty much the same.
It's just, you know, the different
type of mushrooms do different
things. Thank you,
Senator Senator PTO.
You still on the floor thing,  Mr.
President, I think most of these mushrooms grow
out in, in cow patties
across the state of New Mexico.
So hopefully,
uh they won't put any amendments
that, that says, you know,
legislators who are cattle
ranchers can't, can't
grow this or, or do this
and, and, you know, I'm,
I'm really curious,  Mr.  President
Senator, if, if we'll be able to have
drive up windows for
these. Um,
but no, I, I definitely support
this. This is something, it doesn't hurt to
look at it, um,
study it and then see where,
where it takes off in the future.  Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator Pirtle.
We do have further debate, Senator
Hamlin, thank
you,  Mr.  President. I don't need the sponsors
to yield. I just want to
stand in support of this
because uh there
are opportunities that we are missing
out in order to help people
who are experiencing
PTSD. This is
also a natural way of going about
it where it's supervised
and if we can move ahead on
that, um I'm in big favour of
this, this because
uh it's going to be helpful for a
lot of people. And so I
just want to thank the sponsors for bringing
this bill. Thank you,  Mr.  President. Thank
you, Senator Hamlin, Senator
Hickey. Thank you.
Just one last comment.
Um You know, the phrase there is a
fungus among us,
um The first fungus
among us that turned into
a medicine is called
penicillin,
blew into a
back to a a Petri
dish full of bacteria,
pneumococcal bacteria.
And all of a sudden they started
dying. And that's how
we got penicillin the
first really workable
antibiotic other than sulfur.
And now we're going to get the
same way, the same
natural
naturopathic cure
for a lot of mental situations.
So, thank you, Mister President.
Thank you, Senator Senator
MS, Mister President. I think I have
post-traumatic session
disorder. Where do I get my
shrooms? Thank
you, Senator Morris. Would you like
any of the sponsors to yield?
I just want my
shrooms.
Senator Morris. No, I just
think I am on Shrooms. If
Senator Brandt and Senator
Steinborn are working on a veterans
bill together after these years,
I'm glad we can, we can
go take a little mushrooms and
come together finally, after all these
years of veteran cohabitation.
Appreciate it. Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Thank you, Senator Morris. See no
further debate,
Senator Steinborn to close on the
bill.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
Appreciate the interest in this.
And you know, this is just
actually a really important
opportunity to help give a natural
alternative to New
Mexicans who are suffering different
ailments. And so
I think it's a serious
matter and a great opportunity
for New Mexico. And with that,
I move
that we do now pass Senate
Memorial 12
except those voting in the negative
show hands. Thank
you, Senators. We're voting on Senate Memorial
12 as amended
if you wish to vote. No, please raise
your
hand
to
get
by a vote of 37 in the
affirmative zero in the
negative Senate memorial
12 as amended
has passed the Senate
Senator
Brent
Mr.  President, members of the Senate. Thank
you. And I think this
research could be very exciting
and as a veteran, I appreciate
your support for it. Thank you,
Senator Senate majority
leader Peter or take us to the next
order of business. Thank you,
Mr.  President. Unanimously,
we go that our business announcements and
miscellaneous hearing, no objections.
We're on that order of business announcements
and miscellaneous Senator. Thank

161 twice
amended. Thank you
Senator to explain the
amendment. Senator,
we to explain the amendment.
Thank you,  Mr.  President.
The amendment.
Um They didn't like my
title  Mr.  President and
they needed to further explain
what I I'm trying to do
here, uh
provide certain health care
services to the sick and
injured people
and they made three,
wanted to further explain the
three criteria.
Uh First one was merging
to medical services,
in-patient service related to
maternal child and
family health and in-patient
acute care
services and
So essentially
they made a better bill out of
it. So
I will stand for questions.
Thank you. Senators are debating
Senate concurrence
to house amendments. See
none. Uh,
Senator
Woods,
uh,  Mr.  Chair, I
do ask for
concurrence on
this
bill with
a voice vote. Thank

of the 168 is twice

screen doesn't show it
just wanted to make sure that we were clear,
especially those that are watching via
webcast. Senator, but explain
the amendment. Thank you very
much,  Mr.  President. This
required an awful lot of work to get
done and the changes
in the House were related to the
courts and the administrative
office of the courts and we found
that they were already meeting all of the
expectations, so therefore they
needed to be exempted from the
legislation. Thank you,
Senator.
See no debate, Senator
Padilla. Thank you very much,  Mr.
President. I move that the Senate
