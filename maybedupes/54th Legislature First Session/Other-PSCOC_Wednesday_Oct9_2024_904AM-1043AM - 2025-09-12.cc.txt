Uh,
Uh, uh, I wanna thank the staff
for all their preparations and.
Subcommittees for all the work
that they've done in getting
this ready for today's meeting.
Um,
Go ahead and call.
Yeah.
Yeah
Here.
Thank you.
We'll move on to approval of the
agenda. Are there any
amendments? Mr. Chair, remember.
But then entertain a motion to
approve the agenda.
We have a motion
And the 2nd.
To prove the agenda as
presented, all in favor please
in theate by say I.
I post?
And is approved? Do we have any
correspondence?
Today?
Mr. Chair members, there's no
correspondence.
Right.
Then we'll move on quickly to
public comment and like to ask
if there's anyone in the
audience that would like to
provide.
Uh, comment, public comment to
the council this morning.
Anyone in the audience that
would like to.
No then we'll go ahead and move
on to the financial.
Mr. Chair members, good morning.
If you'll turn to page 8 in your
ebooks, we'll look at the
executive summary for the
financial plan, starting with
the key points.
At the very top we'll start with
the awards year to date updates.
This is reflective of lines 28
through 30 of the financial plan
sources and uses detail, the net
change we're presenting this
meeting is $22 million
a few reasons for the, uh, the
increase include some out of
cycle updates. First, Gallup
Central High School is coming
for an award language change,
this meaning they're requesting
$3.2 million for design phase
funding.
Um, and then contingent on the
approval of this item, the
updated out your estimate will
be updated from 13 million to 37
million.
Uh just based on the, the change
in the scope of work.
Next, Albuquerque Sign Language
Academy is coming for an
additional construction funding
request of $2.7 million.
And then finally, Albuquerque
Public Schools is coming for a
construction funding request for
Harrison Middle School for 10.3
million.
Moving down the executive
summary, Mr. Chair members, with
other updates, you'll notice a
table. I'd like to point out the
second or the the middle and
then the right columns indicate
last meeting for 9/11, September
11th council meeting and then
the current meeting and the
changes in SSTB notes, um, so
what you'll basically notice is
the net change for these is 0,
but what we've done based on our
work uh with field and
discussions on how your projects
as we've adjusted the timing of
certain construction.
Uh, projects, so I'll walk you
through those momentarily, but
we also determined that um based
on the need for the projects, we
would not need to sell at our
full capacity. We could do two
separate issuances of those
bonds through the year, so
that's what you notice here.
That's what the.
Um, before I move on to the next
page, Mr. Chair members, do you
have any questions?
Mr. Chair members, if you'll now
turn your attention to page 9 at
the very top.
Um, just a, a quick
Update with the estimated timing
for these projects has been
adjusted for future out of cycle
funding requests, um, as
indicated by the blue arrows on
the award schedule, which I'll
take you to momentarily a
reasons include that for the
changes include design phase
progress, uh, district readiness
slash capacity and timing of RFP
release among among other
factors.
Finally, just a few additional
notes uh with line 4 for the
FI25 project reversions. Uh,
this amount has been updated
from the 0.6 million estimate to
11.5.
Next, line 13 FY 27 PSFA
operating budget has been
updated from 7.8 million to 8.5
um based on anticipated requests
in future years for.
Uh, Mr. Chair members, now I'll
take you through the financial
plan, uh, going to page 10. This
is the sources and uses detail
in your.
Your book
Exhibit A
First on lines 2 and 3, you'll
notice again the SSTB note
changes for July and January
with the capacity being split
between two
issuances instead of 1.
Next on line 4 again, the
project estimate.
Uh, highlighted that was where
the change was from the 0.6.
And then finally moving down
line 13 PSFA operating budget
again going all the way to the
right for the FY 27 estimate for
$8.5 million.
Next, moving on to page 11, Mr.
Chair members, this is the
summary of changes um from for
this meeting and the last
meeting.
First I'll remind you motto
demolition, there was a
recension of that award for
$105,000. That was the only um
funding action item at the last
council meeting?
For this upcoming council
meeting again, you will see
Gallup, Albuquerque Albuquerque
Sign Language Academy and
Albuquerque Public Schools,
Harrison, uh, with the award
amounts detailed.
And then finally, the final, the
financial plan assumptions and
summary.
Uh, this just denotes what the
uncommitted balance has changed
from, from September 20.
September 24 last month, and
then the uncommitted balance for
this month and just where the
net changes were. Um, next.
Mr. Chair members, moving on to
page 12, this is the award
schedule. As you'll notice, uh,
the red line.
Uh, as indicated in FY 25 has
shifted. We are now, we have
moved from quarter 3, we are now
into quarter 4 of
Um, the calendar year, but
Second part of fiscal year 2025.
Again, you'll notice looking at
the project some blue arrows.
These indicate projects that
have either moved out or up just
based on analysis with field and
discussions with the district on
the timing of these projects and
when they best will come.
If you'll turn your attention,
Mr. Chair members, to page 13 at
the bottom table for FY 23, you
will see the two items coming
for this meeting highlighted in
yellow in that red column.
In those red borders, uh, first
again, P23001 for Gallup if you
go all the way to the right,
you'll see the
Request of $3.2 million and then
finally, Albert Academy again
going to the same spot.
And with that, Mr. Questions on

Mr. Chair, members on the
following mini exhibits we have
all of the pre-application
letters.
Go.
Um,
Any surprises?
Yes, um, good question.
Eunice has never applied for
PSCFC funding, uh, they called
me up and were very interested
in the systems-based program, so
they've applied.
Um,
We had um some several other
districts that rarely if ever uh
participate, they've.
expressed interest in applied or
has applied in in quite some
time they've applied before.
Um,
I think those are the
highlights.
OK
The prices in terms of numbers.
Mr. Chair, I think we've kind of
normalized in terms of numbers,
um, I think 35 is a good spread.
And it's also um pretty strong
across the state. There are
quite as many standard base as
we're used to seeing.
Um, but there are a large number
of systems based.
Hello.
Um, I just have a question about
so there's quite a few of them
on fire.
system
Um, replacements and um
With the uh
Eligibility it says that um
category ones.
Does it change there?
Eligibility. I mean, if they, if
they are already in the top.
it was
Uh, at least for those, those
life safety issues different
words. What we see is necessary.
Prior to a project?
Yeah, well, or if, if they're,
if they are applications
includes that.
that push that into it.
that category one.
Um, designation does it change
in any way the
When we get it over.
Triage the
Systems based. Oh for a
potential award. Yeah.
Uh, Mr. Chair and, and members,
uh, not necessarily in in
These times where, where we have
available funding potentially
for all of the projects if we
were in a different scenario
where there might be limited
funding.
We might have a a prioritization
mechanism for that.
But at this time,
They will be considered
So the second part like that.
and
What if you schools and with
that they weren't in the top
300.
And I'm wondering
Is there
Uh
methodology for them to apply
for that category one funding.
of that 300.
Yes, Mr. Chair and, and Mr. um,
yes, as I said with the
eligibility for systems based
it's either up to 300 or in the
fat if there's a category one
for a system and most of those.
for fire alarms.
With an assessor goes to a
school and the fire alarms in
trouble mode is not working
properly that.
Gets a category one.
So we didn't see any, any
applications for that.
We would have seen him if that
was the case.
I mean if one of those schools
was
It was outside of the top 300.
was
Like they could still apply and
you can see them here they just
nobody would like.
I just wanted to understand that
because it doesn't make those
issues very seriously.
Mr. Chair and members at the
time of opening the application.
We did send an individualized
email to every single district.
Individual snapshot of the
ranking for that district color
coded.
For a program that they could
apply for to tell them this is
specifically what you are
eligible for. And so that
included.
The top 100, 300 in any category
overrides one so that they were
aware that they were.
Um, Mr. Sharon Elise, I just
want to comment on um Riodoso
Municipal School's requests for
housing.
Um, I've had, um, several
conversations with the
superintendent Ferguson.
As well as school board members
and have met with some of their
staff that lost their homes.
Um, as a result of the, the
fires there and so I, you know,
I'm clear that they don't,
they're not eligible due to the
rural factor.
But I wanna ask.
What, what can be done is is
staff working with them on.
Uh, giving them some advice on
other options, um.
And really just would like to
ask for us as a council to help
them think through.
Um, what they're
Uh, facing there in Riodoso
because so many their staff
their.
And in general have a a
significant um housing issue and
Um, this, this tied to our
previous conversations about
housing.
In general, is a larger
community issue, but I just
wanna mention that this is a big
struggle for that district.
It's important
Secretary Padilla, we, we feel
their, their pain definitely
before CES event.
Um, and, well,
We, we won't be able to help
them with this teacher housing
program.
We are trying to
Get other resources to them. Um,
I've met with Mark.
From the governor's office I'm
sorry, Daniel from the
governor's office.
And he and I are in
conversations about a few
things, not necessarily specific
to Rio, but.
As we move forward with this
teacher housing it's colliding
with the bigger problem of, of
housing throughout the state and
country, so.
We're, we're trying to figure
out how to navigate that.
It's um.
that is there a?
An emergency declaration for
the. Yeah, they are working with
um, the federal government there
has been.
Emergency declarations.
Um, we were there recently with
the, yeah, to, um.
Town halls and resource fairs
they both in Miss Gero there's
significant loss. It's um
Um,
You know, they're struggling,
um, not only with the virus but
the so.
Um, there's, there's support,
but not.
The question
Slowly.
Thank you for the information.
For me at least, but
Mm
For these major replacements or
major renovation projects if you
all could include information
on.
Uh
School's calendar. How many
school days they're, they're in
session and.
But their instructional hours
are.
Uh, just from a
You know there's a wide
variation obviously across the
state but from my.
Utilization stamp.
It's gonna go forward.
Mr. Chair and members if I may
ask the question, um, last year,
I, I asked which programs the
council would like to hear
district presentations from and
I would like to confirm if that
is.
Same or last year we did uh
standards pre-K projects.
quite a long couple of days.
Yeah. We used to do it that way,
but it's coming up quick, um,
some of the districts, they
really have two together or you
talk to most of the standards
based we just did site visits
for most of them.
Um, but if the pre-K and teacher
housing.
need to present anything you
need to tell them.
That we need to limit it
somehow.
I mean, it would be nice to be
able to listen to really we
definitely the standards based.
that were
certain
We have not done system based in
quite a few years. It's, it's.
Big it too big and it's
Tell you look at my roof.
Well then, let's do all the
rest.
OK.
in one day.
Summit, Mr. Chair and members,
I'd like to also warn you that
that November meeting will be
Long
Um,
Mr. Chair, it's something we've
talked about before just being
clear about the amount of time
each um
LEA has to.
would be really helpful and just
staff and support them and being
prepared to
Um, give some guidance around
what should be in the
presentation, I think.
Making sure that they are so.
Just really keep the
presentations.
Mr. Chair,
Secretary at least does a really
good job when we go on these
site visits to walk them
through, you have.
15 minutes at the maximum.
Keep, keep your presentation
short and succinct we actually
tell them 10 minutes.
Um, to try to shorten that up.
And then we have a really great
um she's developed a really good
set of instructions on what
should be in that.
presentation
Um, trying to keep it succinct,
but tell a story.
And
Uh, Mr. Chair, I, I think that's
very, I'm really happy to hear
that you give that guidance, but
you might even want to give like
a template, you get so many
slides like 25. OK, yeah. You
had to always provided us with a
subject.
I could
Yeah, you're getting the
message. We told each district
to tell the story to to explain
the need for the projects and
and their financial situation,
especially if there's.
So it may be longer than, than
just the morning we haven't.
the time yet, but I mean like
we.
I've done in the past prior to
the open season.
Right.
Informational items. Thank you.
I appreciate all your work on
this.
OK
You
Right.
Next on the agenda we have uh.
Awards.
The
What subcommittee has
recommendations on each one of
the look.
for the recommendation. Thank
you for.
If I could have
To summarize.
these projects starting with the
sign language academy.
Mr. Chair, members, quick
summary as requesting approval
for additional square footage
and additional construction
funding.
An additional square footage is
1,435 square foot.
And the additional construction
funding total is 3,186321 with
the state match of 20715477.
Um, I don't know how much uh Mr.
Chair members, you would like me
to get into, but I have the
district here, Mr. Ray Martinez
and the architect Dan Cruzo to
answer any questions that uh Mr.
Chair, all of these, uh, all 4
projects come with the
subcommittee recommendation.
And
to
Clarify that for us. Yeah.
Did you want to read the
Mr. Chairman, the
Motion would be the council
approved the current standards
based award to the sign language
academy to include an increase
in the maximum.
score footage by 14.
135 square feet for a total of
61,435.
And construction fees funding
totalling 3.1 million with the
state.
7 on the local match.
Thank you I like to.
You hear from
It
Description of what you're
Chair members of the committee,
thank you for having us. Um, as,
as you know, this, this, uh,
Billy's been in the works for a
few years, so when we were
originally awarded funding.
Years ago we already done it
down the road a bit at the time
we were working on design. We
were
So funny a lot of the early
phases of of
The hopeful creation of this,
and then on a ward, we were able
to move forward in negotiation
with the county to um to secure
the land and and really partner
with the county to really you
could steward the public money
and and make this as an
efficient to end up.
Inspiring project as possible
and um
I, I, I will say I'm um
My my around how long that was
gonna take.
I thought we were gonna be.
Turkey because we've done so
much.
In the lead up to that and it
took a couple.
Uh, almost 2 years to work with
accounting to secure um
You know, to formalize the
lease, work through it so that
we could uh partner with them in
in cost shares. So that's what
brought us to this 0.2 years
later, that when we were on
budget initially and and works
to stay on the budget through
the whole process and then has
cost uh increases just kind of
over time.
called we found ourselves, you
know, trying to um
Do everything possible to to
move forward with the build, um,
and not sacrifice the timeline.
You know, to, to, to get it
built as soon as possible. So,
so that's why we started pulling
things out. Uh, we had our, our
local match, um.
And so this is where we come to
now to to replace some of the
things that we had to pull out
to to get the bill.
So I hope, I hope that's enough
information I can answer any
questions for sure.
This, this was disgusting.
The comments or questions.
we
OK
OK, so as we talked about
earlier, um.
I'm really
Not understanding because they
um
Is it
of red
And on the
We're increasing the
Population by
3rd.
And then ask is just for a
minimal amount of square
footage.
Oh, I would love to hear um how
that works.
Um, if there was
The building was originally.
200 kids and then we change it
to um.
Mr. Chairman Ingham, the the
approval of the additional 100
students happened in an award
language change, um, a while
back.
Uh, and that, that brought us to
the, the square footage target
that the school was trying to.
Yes, sir. Um, the additional
1400 square feet is just
It expanded a little bit and
staff has looked at it and we,
we agree that the additional
square footage is, is OK, it's
necessary.
100 students did not equal.
It seemed to indicate
And I do have the last comment
that I need to make and I
Looking through the the value
engineering build back to hold.
I have no disagreement at all
with the escalation of cost.
11,400 square feet. That's not.
Um, but many of the issues.
We value engineered.
I um
To me, a methodology for
bringing a project into the
budget.
And
To turn around and
back in.
Seems to me kind of like what
several of the things that may
seem kind of
Inconsequential.
I think there's a significant
amount of money, but not huge
amounts of money, but they're
not things that I see as.
Usually
in the gravel from one color to
another.
Doing, um, metals, I mean, uh.
look ceilings. Those are the
kind of things that are.
Things that I
I just want as a comment to say
that that doesn't.
It doesn't ring reasonable to me
when we go through an engineer
to get it to come back and
Change that and put it
just because we can.
I have
that's more a comment.
And a question.
Um
Mr. Chair, can I respond a
little bit, please, um.
So I, Mr. Chair and members, I
appreciate.
Ingham's concerns and
We, we understand value
engineering most of the time
does mean we're trying, we've
got to get this thing down into
budget.
I
I'm of the opinion that this was
the wrong term for this
exercise. This was not a value
engineering exercise.
But they were attempting to do
is get the project within the
amount of money that we as a co
owner had at the time.
get the project moving forward
and get it under construction
before we lost more time and
more money.
Um, and, and I do, I do feel
that staff, um, at PSFA and, and
the team at Ala has done a good
job of trying to
this down within budget.
Um, a bit amount is $505 a
square foot that is right in
line with statewide averages
that we're seeing everywhere
right now.
And so
Uh
We staff will never bring
something forward that we don't
feel is um
Necessary or or um
worthwhile.
And so we, we do feel
comfortable as staff to to bring
this.
comment or what not.
Ready to vote on this, so.
Again, we have a committee
recommendation.
Approve the request.
All those in favor please by
saying I.
I was a post.
Motion passes.
Thank you for being here.
Good luck and keep keep that
project moving, Mr. Chair.
Thank,
thank you so much and uh.
5 days.
Get a 5 days is groundbreak, so
thank you all. Thank you.
Move on to the next project.
That is so.
middle school in Hobbs, and we
have award subcommittee
recommendation.
So Mr. Chairman,
Motion on the middle school down
in. This is a
The language change, but it
will.
Down the line.
Uh, but it's for the council to
approve to amend the
standards-based award.
language to have some municipal
schools for the higher Middle
school include an increase in
the design capacity.
135 students for a total of 76
to 8 with the maximum level.
Footage of 96,000 range.
No additional funding is needed
at this time for the design
capacity. But once they finish
the design work, the district
may return for an out cycle.
Construction phase.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair director
Silly, um, so this is very
similar to the, the last middle
school that we brought forward,
um, just to remind this council.
Uh
This project Kaiser.
At an educational spec and
utilization study attached to
it.
Which spawned a 4th middle
school project for the city of
labs, um, that study illustrated
that every middle school is over
capacity, um, the three existing
middle schools.
And uh
Subsequently that was the need
for the 4th middle school.
Um,
I would like to design each
middle school very similarly.
And for the same design capacity
of 775.
As we move forward with
enrollment projections and, and
the um current enrollments.
Um
Our master planner, Mr. John
Valdez wanted to ensure that we
could support this additional
capacity at the school.
Um, the data shows that we can.
However, there are 2 more middle
schools that will likely come
forward soon. I think we heard
about one of them and Mr. Ramos'
um
Projects
And uh,
We will do the same diligence
and and uh projections and
enrollment on that project that
we did on these two, but as this
stands now, we can, we can
support this recommendation to
the council for the increase.
to the subcommittee did have
some discussion about
That the scale of the size of
middle school, we see another
500.
And like
What?
It's typical for, you know, a
non-rural.
Urban
Well, what's safe to have that
many 11 to 13 year olds together
in a school.
What what did you find out on
it?
Uh
Mr. Chair Director Cli So John
John did a little analysis, um,
that I can share with you
afterwards that I just pulled
together last night, but
Well, I'm just looking at
comparative uh.
areas, it's, it's kind of all
over the map, um, as you would
expect, um, so for instance,
there is a middle school in
Albuquerque that only has 380
students, but that's.
Primarily because of the
location of the population, but
there are a lot of, there are a
lot of middle schools that are
in the 700 to 800 population
range.
That's it's important for the
community to know Hos looks kind
of.
Quite Mr. Chair.
Yes sir.
We, we are learning to that, you
know, especially at the middle
school level having a little bit
of
Um,
in your enrollment, so you're
not at maximum capacity is a is
a good thing.
Um, because as we know these
girls are moving class to class
starting in middle school, and
So having a little percentage of
Of underutilized capacity at the
middle school level is OK. It's
a good thing.
Um, but
I think that we may see these
schools.
Be full and and.
When you envision this coming
back to.
Um, Mr. Chair, I believe that
they are in
either programming or schematic
design, and
these two middle schools, the
new Hobbs Middle School, and um
And Heiser
are kind of running parallel.
Uh, one is a little bit ahead of
the other.
Um, but I would say in the next
6 to 8 months, we should see
these coming forward, um.
Or for construction phase
funding.
A
The chair members, I just want
to add that it will be coming
probably in the next couple of
months for early work package.
The actual construction funding
will probably be another 6
months, 4 months. Any other
questions or comments?
Is there anyone hear from?
Mr. Chairman members, I do not
believe so. There's no other.
Questions or comments?
a subcommittee recommendation
all in favor please indicate by
saying 9.
was opposed.
That
Thanks
Hello
Central High School.
Mr. Chairman, the
on this one would be for the
council to approve to the
current standards based award.
Language McKinley schools for
Gallup Central High School
include an increase for a total
of 470 students.
266 student increase grades 9
through 12.
The maximum gross square footage
of over 70,000 with the state
match.
I mean,
I, I completion of the design
work the district may return to
the house for destruction.
So
This is a project, Mr. Chairman,
where the district is willing to
the scope of the mission from an
alternative high school.
They're both an alternative high
school and high school.
I would like the record to
reflect that.
Um, galloped this pain for a new
facility.
Um, for basically like a full
credit.
Expansion
Um, facility.
Um, for
curriculum type classes and it's
one.
You can see some of the details
of the.
How many students they would
have coming in, both in the
morning and the afternoon.
I
See
That's on page.
existence
There we go. Page 117.
we did have a discussion about,
you know, the
of the
would be
And
It's called CTE program theory.
a little bit unclear on.
What that is, but I don't want
the council to
I feel that we're gonna be
training a bunch.
We still my estimation.
When we say we're buying CT.
What exactly are we?
the fact that many of these
students will still need
post-secondary education career
and I think that's important.
Policy discussion that we talk
about.
Um, as there was what.
What we're ultimately buying,
but the, the districts
definitely done a lot of
planning in this particular area
they've worked closely with
their community with employers.
And the types of programming
that they want and again they've
got
The local resources to go and
build.
building a regular curriculum I
think that's important for the
council to.
No.
Um, given that the history of,
um, so with that, Mr. Chairman,
I don't know if wanted to.
Anything to like missed.
That's fine.
Mr. Chair, director Sole, that
was a great summation of the
subcommittee.
A discussion. It was a really
good discussion.
Um, just to remind this council
as as directorly mentioned, this
was originally an alternative
high school award around 20,000
square feet.
Uh, but in the spirit of
partnership rather than asking
them to rescind and start over.
Uh, staff and, and the agency
asked them to do a utilization
study to show the need for these
and where these.
we're gonna come from, um, and
that is what a lot of this
information and uh background
information questions, comments.
So
The last committee meeting.
have asked this question and I
didn't ask the question, but.
One of the areas that
And highlights for me.
A pathways. So
Is a school partnering with like
any.
But you know, apprenticeship
programs or.
Uh, you know, to get these
that's where they needed to be,
you know, in that pathway.
Yeah
Uh, you know,
You know, because
Get
And you know,
it's a big deal, you know,
a 4 year uh pregnan you know,
make up to $52 an hour, so I
would just kind of curious about
that, so when you're done with
this curriculum they get a
certificate or where are we at
with that?
Um, Mr. Chair and Mr. Romero, I,
I, um, direct your attention to
page 126, that becomes uh
That illustrates the uh
Internship business partner list
that Gallup provided to us.
Um, and I would say that it's my
understanding.
That
For instance, uh, Mr. Romero, as
you're mentioning.
Electrician pathway.
Right, you're, you're gonna have
to go through your journeymen.
So I think this sets them up
for, for that additional work
outside of.
Uh, outside of high school.
Um, it's my understanding that
the focus for these are um
junior and seniors. So those
would be the individuals that
would take advantage of.
Having those two years in high
school and then be that much
further ahead for the for the
program that they graduated and
move, move forward.
questions.
I have a question in terms of uh
You know,
Gallup's workload.
This, this is a
So
2023 project.
And
They've come in
Request this change.
As you know, from time to time
we get
We hear from districts.
And they indicate that
We've, we've held up many.
know that
We've
talked about it in the past.
Make sure that they have the
capacity.
To implement
A number of projects they could
construct. I mean, do we have a
number?
Mr. Chair members, uh, if you
would look at page 118.
In your ebook, um, current
active projects are 16.
Some of these that date back to.
So again, uh.
You know, I know Sa is working
hard to make sure that we have
rules and regulations that we
need to follow.
features
So,
Again, the, the hold up on this
one is.
The request that correct?
of a previously.
Mr. Chair, that's correct, and
as mentioned, you know, this,
this would have appeared as
holding up if we had asked them
to start it all over.
Um, instead of doing the study,
so.
Um, this was, this was staff's
idea of a way to kind of work
together and keep it moving.
Um, they do have a lot of active
projects, some of which have
stalled.
And we are in conversations with
the district on as to why um
they're, they're not moving
forward.
Um, and just more generally
speaking, not necessarily just
this district that we have.
Started to um
Advise districts to get projects
done before they move.
On to other projects, especially
if they don't have.
The capacity staff wise or
monetarily.
Um,
We're, we're really advising
districts to not ask for a
waiver on 4 projects, um, pick,
pick the priority and let's
start there.
Um, and, and so we're having
these kind of conversations with
this district as well.
Um,
Did I hear that they had lost
their
Um, Mr. Roxy retired.
Um,
It was a big loss for not only
the district but the state she's
she's built and done a lot for
this.
State in particular in Gallup.
Um, they do have people line up
in the position.
Um, but I think they're still
trying to find.
Another person to help them
manage this load.
I just want us to be in a
position that move these along.
We all work towards that goal.
Um, was there any other
questions?
We have a motion from the
subcommittee. All in favor
please indicate by saying I.
Post
That we move on to.
in middle school, APS.
And Mr. Chair Directors, I'm
sorry to interrupt, but we have
a, we had a major technical um
error in our book, the, the page
that you have in your book is
not.
The correct motion, um,
Staff emailed it to me so I know
it's a little out of
Uh, order, but if you would
like, I can read the motion off
of the uh the corrected version.
And I'm getting my own unless.
I
I is that what you're handing
out?
And again, apologies. This was
This was a last minute whoopsie.
And
Mr. Chair Director Le while
she's handing this out, um.
What had happened was we, we had
to pull out an auxiliary gym.
Um, and so the motion that's in
the in the ebook.
has the gym that auxiliary gym
in the number.
Um, but, um, yes, COC doesn't
fund two gyms out of middle
school and so we, we had to take
that out. That is the
information that we have that
subcommittee.
Our wires just got crashed with
the documentation. So again,
apologies.
So, Mr. Chairman, I'll go ahead
and
Read the potential motion and
discuss what you the motion is
for the council to middle
school.
In construction phase funding
for 48,996 square square feet
500 state ma.
15.9, so you'll see the square
footage.
It's smaller to reflect the
exclusion of the auxiliary gym
and then the adjusting.
Um,
And
Mr. Chairman, I would say we we
did have
amount of discussion in
subcommittee on
Um, the change for
The school district thinking
that it's going to be absent
boundary change district.
I recall correctly believes
that.
They do lose a significant
amount of students to
surrounding.
Middle schools as kids are
transitioning facility upgrade
that that would be mitigated.
attracting
More students.
Um, that said.
know
We may need to still work with
DPS around.
Resetting boundaries for
You know what's going on in that
with the district remind me.
Still, they were set on like
775.
But we're not worthing money for
that entire amount they still
gonna build to that spec.
That's right. Project. Mr.
Chair, director Sale,
so it's, I believe it's 740
students.
Uh, we, we have recommended
supporting 500 because of the,
the various items that director
Sly just mentioned.
Um,
I will say that yes, they are
building to that capacity, um.
And as
As we know, um,
Some districts choose to build
above the allowable funding and
the allowable square footage and
and APS would be one of those
that provides.
Different amenities like an
auxiliary gym.
And some other things.
Apparently the school sitting
at.
Dramatic
Assumption.
In the council's putting in.
Resources, you know, assuming
that there's gonna be.
Uh, enrollment but.
The district is putting
Mr. Cha, a lot of the
Um,
The students that are missing
from Harrison right now are
going to Georgia. Sanchez, the
newer school.
In that area.
So the argument is, once this
facility gets upgraded, some of
those.
neighborhood kill those many.
back to this
The school.
OK
Thank you for the uh
background on that.
Any questions or comments?
And uh all those in favor of
approving the subcommittee
motion by saying.
OK
Those opposed?
Motion passes.
We'll move on.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
Thank you, members.
On
Yes.
OK. So, um,
Uh,
I recertification.
Mr. Chair members. We also have
a motion on that from the uh.
subcommittee
Mr.
In motion
Did you want to edit?
Mr. Chair, this is just mainly a
reflection of the project close
at work that uh the finance
staff has been undertaking and
if you turn to page.
159.
Uh, that will be all of the
Projects that were reverted.
Um, balances that were reverted
and then also decertified.
On these particular ones.
As well as indicating, um, a
couple of the projects that
you're marking those.
And these responses as well.
OK.
It looks like there's about a
9.5 million.
You know
These areations.
Any any fun. The these
particular bonds they're um as
you'll see in the presentation
coming up that it's
approximately a total of 16
million.
Um, but we're working very
closely with state board of
Finance on the older bonds that
these are expecting to make sure
before we do any certifications
or changes to those that we are
in line with the board of
finance or movement is done.
I use the oldest first.
Well, these are actually these
projects are tied to older
projects.
the bonds, so we will be
touching those older bonds, but
we want to make sure that we're
in balance and in alignment with
the board of Finance. I think
this is.
is
The potential need to get, you
know, in the past we would
You have surpluses in one bond,
and then we would close that
out.
As the project didn't need it in
reality.
Creating a
nightmare for PSFA doing that.
and given
How much money we've got.
Available
going forward my current level
of
With others is that
You might want to start getting
out of that.
We didn't need that full bond
sale for those projects figure
out we can
somehow.
Then I'd go forward basis we
start with a clean.
You know, here's how much money
we've got.
That's something I think but for
now these projects knowing that
we need to.
As you say, this can be like.
Because it's when it comes back.
Like
What's Mr. Chair, we are
currently doing that work with
the board of Finance to get what
those actual old bond balances
are, um, so then we can
determine what do we want to be
back to the permanent fund and
then reestablished in a newer
bond.
Uh, the other topic of
conversation that we're having
with Board of Finance and this
is going to be a bigger topic.
counseling and others is
Do we want to earmark?
Total estimated cost of the
project.
At the time of the initial
award.
Um, as you see now, we only
certify what the need is at this
time.
And so, um, it was brought up in
our discussions. Do we go back
And marks the full amount.
Um, of the lifespan of that
project. Yeah, we got back and
forth.
Mhm.
Mr. Ger, this, this can turn
into fro also speaks to.
The need for some processes and
procedures and we talked a
little bit to staff and a little
bit to finance about.
Um
Expectations for projects part
of part of the issue here is
about.
Timelines and deadlines for when
to start projects, projects,
those kinds of things so that is
an easier, they're just they're
lingering.
We want to get those projects
done.
Does come.
I was an accounting and a
tracking thing.
Also thinking through.
And I know AMS is going to do
this through those processes
features on the front end.
Mr. Chair, Mr. Senna, um.
Very good comment.
I'm happy and proud of the work
that the programs.
Uh, department is currently
doing, having this conversation
right now I think what we're
doing is paying for passings.
Um, and so we're gonna have that
for a while, but with the
direction that Ms. Ramos in, um,
Park is doing at the forefront
of getting these districts
ready.
They're also establishing
timetables. So I feel like we're
really spearheading that, in a
positive direction.
Um, just that we've been working
out and then just discussions.
We're worried about overall
bond.
So
Just keeping track of what's
been right.
But we have a motion.
All those in favor of
please indicate by saying I.

the spring we'll be mapping.
from the existing classified

The directors um that study
would be very beneficial. I know
in house we did our own uh
study.
Um, but that would definitely be
very beneficial and just as you
recall council approved our
fiscal year 26th preparation
request which included a 3%
increase for salaries, um.
Or that you're 26, so we're
really looking at our budget,
um, and trying to be very
proactive on trying to be
competitive.
And working with our our vacancy
savings to give cycle.
Increases, which we're able to
do that within the past month.
Um, so,
As you saw on the financial
plan, we're requesting
additional uh operating.
Uh, or, excuse me, upgrade an
operating budget in the next
fiscal years based on the awards
that you have been awarding.
And what we're being very
conservative with that. We don't
we right now we can actually ask
for up to $110 for operating
budget, because we want to
really um focus on our current
staff and nurturing them and um
compensating for their work so
that we can then create
intercourse to bring in new
staff because as you all know
PFA is a unique entity.
It takes a lot.
A long time to really get it.
Um,
We want to make sure that value
and, and compensated for it. So
we're really being proactive in
this arena.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a
couple of quick questions. One
is, are you, are there
particular areas for your
experiencing vacancies like on a
consistent basis and the
vacancies that you have
currently here this number.
areas.
The second part of it is
Last month a couple additional
positions for next fiscal year.
Curious whether or not those are
connected to some of these or
challenges filling those
positions based on the kinds of
Yes. We have.
That we can spend a certain
amount of
Mr. Chair, Mr.
Cen uh it pertains to the two
others, the other two FTs are
another regional manager as you
can see all of the construction
projects that are coming forward
to 12 months we're gonna need an
additional help.
As well as an energy towards
sustainable.
We want somebody.
there's any other questions, so
thank you for the reporting.
It
Mr. Chair, I'm gonna give you a
brief update on what's going on
at the public school capital
outlay task force, um, so far
we've met.
4 times, but
What I have, um,
In front of you.
Um, in order to meet the
deadlines, I'm gonna talk about
uh 3 of those, um.
Meetings on May 20th, uh,
piece of an update on the newly
awarded projects, projects
completed in fiscal year 24 and
current ongoing projects.
Also what that meeting Mr.
Parks, uh, gave a presentation
on the trends of construction
costs.
Um, PSA also presented the
proposed legislative uh plans
for task force consideration.
And then the task force approved
their 2024 proposed plan and
meeting schedule.
In July,
Uh, Mr. Charge and I presented.
Uh, to the task force with
updates on new awards as well as
cycle works coming forward.
We also talked about the outlook
of 2025 as a pertains to PSCOC
and discussed um the rankings,
uh, the funding programs as well
as the PSCOC meeting calendar.
Also, topics of discussion were
from ASC and LFC.
On the 2024 legislative update.
They have 207 requiring PICFC to
make an annual distribution for
police assistance was discussed.
As well as 76, which made a
technical change to the act
clarifying that schools district
eligibility for the local match
reduction.
Uh, was to be calculated before
a temporary lometric reduction
which was established by Senate
Bill 131.
Also, IFC and LESC provided a
brief history of the funding
formula, metrics for the current
calculation criteria and policy
considerations.
He then presented on the need
for local match reductions as
well as potential legislative
solutions for current issues.
And finally in July, we had
superintendents from Amas,
Maxwell and Melrose.
Who discuss their challenges
that they were going through in
their respective school
districts um in meeting the
criteria for the awards.
Finally in August 4th August
14th.
Um, Mr. Suzuki from LC asked a
brief history and framework of
the New Mexico public education
system to include timelines of
the development of the common
schools in the United States as
well as in. Um, also in that
meeting chaired as well as stand
around.
Um, get the presentation.
Um, Mr. Gan, on behalf of the
New Mexico School Board
Association.
Uh, and surrounds discuss public
school financing issues and talk
about the priorities which
include the continued support of
PSCOC funding as well as the
removal of local mass
reductions.
We also were able to bring RBC
Capital Markets LLC to discuss
how school districts secure
capital.
Finally, the New Mexico Finance
Authority provided information
about existing programs as well
as a program in development that
will provide financial
assistance to charter schools.
Coming up, uh, November 7th.
Uh, the task force is interested
in hearing the oral arguments
from the Supreme Court as it
pertains to the Sunni lawsuit. I
believe there will be listening
to that. I'm not quite sure for
how long, but it is on the same
day of the next task force
meeting.
And by that time we're hoping to
have a draft legislation from uh
LCS pertaining to the waivers,
um, and the continued work on
the state local match.
Uh, and with that, I sent for
any questions.
Thank you for that report. So,
um, end of November meeting will
be their last meeting.
Mr. Chair, that is.
They'd be scheduled to adopt.
Mr. that is correct. That is the
only items so far, you've heard.
Mr. Cha it pertains to PSCOC.
Thank you for taking the lead
in.
It
It is closed.
Mr. Chair, members of the of the
council, uh,
she has been spearheading this
project close out initiative,
um, it has been a very big left.
And so um uh.
to have her speak towards it as
well as we brought some staff to
celebrate.
Thank you.
Um
to choose and stuff to turn over
for the last 3 years close out

as directed by director Ashley
Leach of Board of Finance and
chairwoman of the AMS committee.
has made it a priority to focus
on closing.
Out of the closing our projects.
Documentary processes and
creating policy.
Adraft of the documented process
and policy will be presented.
The next subcommittee meeting.
To give some additional
information.
Over the last 4 years,
finance was understaffed.
understaffed in 2019 through
2021, there were two.
Uh, between
projects that would increase the
load.
For us, I left PSFA in July of
2021 and returned in September
of 2022.
Um, to help with the project
close out and train the staff.
Um, in 2023 we hired three new
staff members that needed to be
