Thank you. I am Senator
Martin Hicky of relearning
the rope here. Um
I want to welcome everyone
to the first meeting
of TOB
Settlement Revenue Oversight
Committee. Otherwise it's known, Mr.
Rock
and we
will start by doing
introductions of the Members
of the Committee
and uh
representative
Ferrari.
>> Um, good morning everyone.
And um
I,
Joan Ferrari from House's
37 in Los
Cruces. And
um I know we have a
lot of good work
and effort to continue,
especially during the interim,
getting ready for 60
days. So you
all for thank
you,
>> Mr. Chair. Good morning. I'm
Representative Thomson
Health for 24
in the near Northeast
Heights
of
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, present the Committee
and we have to people on
the webcast to I'm
Senator Shannon in the
district in the north west
corner of the
State
check.
>> Thank you. Uh Senators
and representatives.
Um Before
you, we have the agenda,
we're doing the call to
order. Um
Do we have any minutes if
we need to approve last
time or they're all set? Ok.
Very good. Glad to
hear that. Um What we're
going to do this morning
is uh first
hear a fiscal update
on the tobacco
funds. There was some bills
last year and so hopefully, we will
understand where all
those are in the process
and the attempt to
get to
revenue generation.
The uh we
are then scheduled to hear
from
the Julie
made, but
she May have,
she will be here. Ok.
We're all good. There
was maybe a little confusion about
dates but
it is not the case
and then we'll have a working
luncheon which we'll plan out
the, we have three other
meetings and we'll
go through the agenda
and who we want to hear
from around
that. Um
Do any of my colleagues
have any other compliments that they
would like to make before we start
and, and hear from the
legislative?
See, then I would
invite
Ruby Anne and Brendan
to the table.
You seem so far away
down.
Yes, II, I would
please.
Yeah, you're, you're welcome to
sit at the end of the table as
well. If you like.
This is all this, this
is kind of family time.
So
yes, it touch
the green and
I'm
not,
we're going to
take us through, but it often in a
confusing set of numbers.
But by the time we finish with
them, we usually have
that.
>> Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman
and Members of the Committee. And my
name is Rianne Ul,
I'm a principal analyst
with the legislative
finance Committee, but we're working
in collaboration
and now with the legislative
Health and Human Services
Committee as well.
And my colleague, he's with me
this morning. Um Mr.
Brandon Gray, he's
um one of our
three economists with
the legislative finance
Committee. And
um I believe everybody
has a hand out
in
the,
ok. I tried to make extra
c so we
audience
and um Mr.
Chairman, I'll just be pointing
to this document. So you'll
know kind of where I'm
at on this because as you say, this
is kind of a whole
bunch of numbers on this page
here. But once we go through it,
hopefully it won't, it won't
make sense. So I think
we're
um
basically, this is a
document that we bring to the
Committee every
year at this time. Good
morning.
>> If, if we could thank
you,
if we could take a moment. And
Senator Lopez, could you
introduce yourself
and he hit the, hit the red
button.
>> Good morning, madam
Cer Linda Lopez,
the State Senator
11.
My apologies for
being
good morning. No, >> thank you.
Please >> proceed again.
So, uh this document,
Mr. Chairman is always
included in
the legislative finance
Committee,
uh volumes that
we published every year, both
are volume
one and also the
post Session report.
So um if anybody
even for Members of the public,
if anyone's ever interested
in just looking this up, it's
always available online.
You just go to the LFC
website like for the
document I'm referencing
today. It's on
the LFC post
Session document
and you can find it included
there. So this is always available
at any time to, to
anybody.
Um The document
is broken into two components.
I'm gonna give you the layout of
this. The top
part of the
document lines one
through 18
are the revenue components.
And as you know, revenue
is such a big issue for this
Committee and, and
an array of issues
that we've discussed over the
years regard
revenue. Um
The latter part from
lines 19 to
38
are the appropriation
components. So the expenditure
components or as
um our former director always said, you know,
sources and uses.
So, um and then we
always include pretty much
all of that LC
work always includes
usually three years. So we
show actual,
so that for now it will be
that fiscal year 23
Fy 23 actual, so
actual expenditures and
revenue and then
we show Fy
24.
So, um
that's the operating
year that we're just
about to finish now.
Um the close of June,
June 30th
and then um
fy 25 which
will begin July 1st
through June 30th that um in
the legislative Session that
you all just voted on all the
appropriations and voted on
this, this in
particular, uh
just now when we have our
last legislative
Session. So that's how
this document is always
organized.
And um
I think I'm not gonna so
much focus on
the actual
year and the operating
budget year, we can talk
about that if there are any questions.
Um I'll focus more
on what happened during
the legislative Session because
it was a bit of a watershed
year. So,
um, you
will see Mr. Chairman
and Members of the Committee
that here under
the Appropriations component
pieces, there's a lot of
blank spaces there.
So that's different from what we see
every year and we'll tell
you why that is. Um,
so first off though, I, I'll
just, um, I'm gonna
go a little bit over
just how, like I said, like how the
document is laid out. Brendan
is going to talk about the
revenues and the games
and loss and of course, the bill.
But um, as I talk about
the expenditure component,
I wanted to
highlight a couple of
numbers on the top.
So, um,
you, you'll remember taking
another step. So
tobacco revenue
are generated from,
you know, we have the master settlement
agreement
from
2000, whatever
now,
whatever the year was. And
so it's based on the sales, you
know, the stamps on the cigarette
packages and it's
based on the sales
and then
the revenue comes in
for the agreement that we
have. And
then, um, we
typically are
projecting a
year or two years in
advance what the revenue is gonna
be. So that's always
tricky and it's really
tricky to
and they can protect
oil and gas,
you know, I'm sure that's super
too. But, um, you
know, but um so these are
projections. And
um on top of that though,
we have the issue which you're gonna hear
more about in your um
Executive sessions
today, but we have the issue of all
the legal wrangling
that goes on around it. So you're going to hear
more about. So by the
time you add all of that in, at
least there's a lot of uncertainty,
right? So we're
trying to get us a number
and then we get
productive revenue
annually. And then
how the, the law, the
statute is set up is that
of the money that comes in
50% of
that goes into
the tobacco settlement
program fund,
which is where
you all appropriate
from and then the
other half goes into the tobacco
settlement.
So that builds up and cruise
and is invested.
And um
so that's how this
works. Now, you all who
have been on this Committee
for a while, you have
heard how over the years when we
had very, you know,
fiscally difficult
years, we would
use 100% of
the revenue
for appropriations
usually to comment Medicaid
for the most part, it was pretty much
for me. So it,
it a of the income
revenue wouldn't go into the permanent
fund. It would just be used for
appropriations. And there
is always concern about that.
And I kind of a,
there's always concern about that
because it's like, oh, are we
really investing
enough into cessation? That's what
this Committee talked a lot about over
the years. Are we really investing,
you know, the recommended
amount by the American
Cancer Society and others where, you
know, it was much higher even
when you pulled in Medicaid and all the
other pieces, it was
probably much higher. And so there was
concern about that.
So in the discussions
we had over the last two years, it was
like, mm uh
what can we do
to change that? So
two years ago and Brenda will talk
more about which has so basically,
we tried last year to
do to basically
put all the money
and um have to go
in and not and basically
have it all the money
come in and go into the permanent
fund into the corpus, what
we call so that we can then just
invest it with the State
Investment Council because we were
counting tobacco
settlement, um permanent
fund as part of
our reserve.
So, you know, whenever we're doing
appropriations, there's always that debate,
what's on our appropriate Weser
level. And we've been going
more towards about 30%
right over the years. And now
we used to do
lesson,
you know, decades showing my
age back, back when
and stuff. But yeah,
you remember two, I'm
not the only one. So
yeah. So anyway, that has
already changed, but
we didn't get the bills through last
year. It didn't get
signed. Um
We, it got passed by the
legislature but it didn't
get,
this is going to
talk about that.
So to get to
this last column here,
that was the background,
this last column here.
Um we
basically, we
have
by this number to be line
three beginning um that
one of the permanent fund. So that
tells you where we're at, how much is in that
Corpus.
And then we
have um
you know, tobacco revenue that's
coming and
protected
of how much we we get from
sales, you know,
the little stamps on the sales.
And then number half
goes to the
to the program plan that's
available for
um
appropriation
that we have gains and so
revenue earns from
investments and all
and then um
the the
balance
and then if you go to line
starting 11 down, because
this gets to the appropriation.
So we have
um I wanted
to direct you to the, again
this line
13, you see
12.9 80
2013 millionaire
that ties to
line
five, see the same
numbers there.
So there's a method to this. If
you're on the page, it's
high 1000. This is what we're
expecting to get the
50% that we
can. So
that ties up there, those two
numbers and then you see
another amount 7
million,
103,800.
So on line 15,
7.1.
So when you add those two,
up the
amount of lines 14 and
15, that
leads to
20.02
80 28.02
0.7. So look online
38
22.22
0.7 20 million.
So I just wanted to show you
that this all is time. This
is basically giving you all of
the information. You're
like what we're projecting.
We added a little bit of fund
balance. That's what the seven
online 15,
the 7 million was
because we had a fund balance that
we had additional revenue that
they come in and that wasn't invested,
it wasn't in the permanent fund,
it was sitting in the what we call
fund balance. So
you have to do something with
that either to put it in the permanent fund
or expend
it. And so we expended it
and added it to the
projected
um revenue that we're gonna
receive for fy
25.
So when you add those two numbers
together, you get the 20
million. So I
wanted to just tile that
out for you. Now, let's
look, starting to look
down from
line 21
down to
38. So
you'll see in the column
for fiscal year 23
and the column for fiscal year
24 right from
here, those
all top numbers, right? They're,
they're the appropriation.
So the first one
is always for the Indian
Affairs Department
and I'm looking at line
21 and
that's for their tobacco cessation
program. So they have contracts
in, in the Indian.
And so that's always
about 250,002,
49 point Street
$249,300.
So, um
you'll see that continues to
be appropriated in fiscal
year 25 in the last
column, line
21 last column, you
see that appropriation,
then you go down
lines 22
and 23 the
Human Services Department
and you see which is gonna be
the health care authority starting
in July 1st. They
change their name and their
is expanded.
Um You'll see
there that they have
1.255
million in um
appropriated
for Medicaid
breast and cervical cancer
treatment. And then right
underneath that, there's 13
million, 13.1
million online
uh 23 for,
for Medicaid as well.
So those were
appropriated in
fy 25
by you all for
the Human Services department and
for Medicaid Services. So those
are consistent with all the past
years.
And then you'll see
one other piece
for Fy 25 the
last column,
if you go to line 26
you'll see the tobacco cessation
of prevention at the Department
of Health for 5
million
$435,200.
So that is that the
tobacco cessation efforts that
you all are very familiar
with and you hear about every
year from the Department of Health. So
all of that
remains
consistent with
past years.
So,
um
so that is the same
now, everything else
is like what happened.
So the rest of the revenue
is for the Department of
Health. Typically
that is appropriated. It's for
Department of Health Prevention
and control harm reduction
efforts and breast and
cervical cancer screening.
And then if you continue on to
UN M UN M Health Sciences
Center, the other
blank spots are typically
for um
I instruction in general
purposes, research and genomics
and environmental health poison
Control Center, pediatric
oncology, specialty
education and trauma. And in
pediatrics, we
see nothing was appropriated
from tobacco
settlement program
fund but
don't panic because it was
offset with
appropriations from the General
fund and
for UN M Health Sciences
Center, the,
the appropriations
for UN M um
so it was added to
their, what's called their RPS
PS. So the research
and program
service projects, I think
that's what RPSP stands
for. It's how in
House Bill Two and the General
appropriation Act, how
for the
specialized
programs,
schools,
colleges,
all those things that don't fall
under regular instruction
in general, the formula for
higher ed, then they have
RPS PS that are laid out
in the general appropriation act
in that format. So the
revenue for these items
here for UN M Health Sciences
Center were shifted into
RPS PSS and funded
with General Fund. So they
weren't cut or reduced.
And the same with Department of
Health, the amounts that
aren't shown here are, were
transferred also into
General. So
they will continue hopefully
that, you know, every year you all review
the budget. Of course, we it's a we're
annual budget review
here. So the assumption
is they'll continue at least
at the same rate
upon annual.
So that's
yes,
>> you're at a conclusion.
>> So yeah, so I think that's
my conclusion. So that's the,
the summary of where we're at
and, and what sort of
happened for fiscal year 25.
And then of course, Brennan needs to go
through all the revenue component pieces
and then the what happened with the
bills. But yeah, so
I'm done with
my
>> any questions for the
moment. I have one just
clarifying
the. Um
So I'm assuming that in
House Bill two,
the switch in appropriations
out of. So there's
language in it, takes it out
of the tobacco fund transfers
to the General and then the
general does
a transfer to
you and then under an RPP,
is that, is that
how
>> um Mr. Chairman
actually? No, there's not
language. It was just so if
you're trying, so it's not
transparent. So if you were trying
to say, look at House Bill
two and just like
figure this out and see this,
it would be really hard to see
except for you would just see that.
Oh the RPS P grew,
the amount grew and
you could tie it to the amount that
was the same for last year in
Fy 24 for these. And you'd be
like, oh, that's the
difference. So there's
not language and there's not language
either in Department of Health.
It's just funded in the
base that
amount, the offsetting
amount it was added.
So basically
the, you know, the
legislative finance Committee and the
analysts keep track of it and
we, we made the adjustments
in the base budget in
general fund. But, so it's
not particularly
true,
>> Mr. Chair. Thank you for your
presentation.
So
it's not guaranteed that it's
recurring lending
or particularly
in particular
to
that thesaurus.
So our
PSP is really
for all higher
education
throughout New
Mexico.
>> Um Mr. Chairman
Senator Pino, I
was just
trying to be a good legislative
staff person by making that comment.
So I, I hope I didn't confuse
you. Technically
all appropriations,
anything,
anything is, nothing is
guaranteed, right? Because the
legislature reviews
the budget annually and
no future legislatures
are bound by any current
legislature, right? So
we, you all
review the budget
annual, but
that said we basically
build on the base
budgets. I mean
cuts can occur and
changes can occur,
but for the most
part, it's consistent
and we, we build
on it. So,
um
the assumption is it
the RPS PS that
shifted out here or, or
the tobacco revenue
that wasn't funded here
for these programs and
was shifted for both Department
of Health and UN M Health Sciences
Center. The assumption is
that we'll continue
on and, and, and be
the same. Um It
was flat funding, there wasn't
growth, it was flat funding
with what was funded in Fy
24. But
the assumption is it will continue. And
all the, well, I don't know
if all the higher education
institutions in health too,
but the large
ones, they certainly all have our
PSP line items to answer
the same question.
So, >> so every year we
would just have to make
sure if you
don't get the budget in a
couple of hours and then approve
it, then it's
not there.
>> Um, Mr. Chairman Senator
Pinto, um
you know, certainly you can
check in the fall with the
Legislative Finance Committee and
then the the budget documents are
printed and you know, you can
ask and I I know
all the higher education institutions
are following those numbers closely.
So I'm sure they would let you know as
well. Yeah, thank
>> you, Mr.
Chair. And
I think that was one of the things that we
talk about
program
when I think it was at the
meeting was
that there's not an index
in there for cost of
inflation. That's why we
got by
having everything under budget.
So that
back in there, I don't
know.
Thank you. >> Thank >> you, >> Mr.
Chairman, Senator. Um You
are correct in Gallup. Um
um what she's
referencing, Mr. Chairman
is when we were,
when the Legislative finance Committee
met in Gallup last
month. Um
in particular, there was a
Medicaid presentation and
hospital costs study
report that a program
evaluation that was presented
and what came up then
is medical
inflation and
how
you know, the hospitals and all
have the increasing costs
for, you know, everything, just medical,
pharmaceutical
staff, everything. So,
um how do we account
for that? And
you are correct, we don't
build in per
se in any
standardized format, any kind
of inflationary factors.
Although on the
revenue side, in some
areas, we do build
in certain components.
But in terms of the expenditure
side of the budget, we
don't really build in
unless
we don't build in a fail
stop, you know, in, in
on the expenditure side.
But however, the legislative
finance Committee, it always does
put together budget
guidelines
um
in its August
hearings. And uh
those are very
uh transparent
and a lot of times in the
budget guidelines for which
they'll be building the budget based
on which they'll be building the budget
for the next fiscal year.
Many times they will build
in an inflationary factor
as part of the budget
guidelines. So those
are open and available to
the public as well. So
I'm you can
check those out um
online also. Thank
you, Mr.
>> Senator Thompson. >> Thank you Mr.
Chair and thank you. Um
So we this
Committee for years has been
whining about getting back
our all the money
that's been borrowed
from from the permanent
fund. So
where I I expected
to see some giant increase
somewhere and I'm not
seeing it. So where
does that
>> stand
to the economy? To Mr.
Brandy?
>> Mr. Chair
representative
uh in
Fy,
I think there was a
time
replacement from the general fund
into the permanent fund.
Um, and I don't believe there's
been any large
increases. Um I'm,
I'm happy to talk about
the change that was made in the
2024 legislative
Session and that should
help start to grow
the permanent fund. Hopefully,
some of those. But just to
answer your question,
that Fy
20 General
fund infusion was, I believe the last
time the legislature
added to >> the, and
Mr. Chairman, I think that was
for 40 40
million. So that,
that was when they
invested the general fund gave
general fund to tobacco to
try and boost it up. But then
you, you know, it was
for all the lost revenue.
>> No. So mister
Chair, is there a plan
in LFC to ever
replace
that?
>> Mr. Chairman? I think
that would be nonrecurring revenue
because it would be a one time
um
adjustment to the tobacco
settlement permanent
fund. So I
think if this Committee
is interested in pursuing
that, it's certainly under
your purview to consider
that. And if we uh we'd
be happy to work with you to generate
a number because that has,
that will always be a changing
adjusting number, depending
on, you know, the
economy, inflation, how much we
can, you know, so that's always on the
mov'e. Um But we
could uh certainly
our economists could work with the Committee
to generate a
number and you could do
that amount or some
iteration there of that amount
if that is the committee's
desire. Well, I'll vote
>> right now. That's my
desire.
>> Thank you, Representative
Ferrari >> just on that
point. Um I
think it's a balance of
69.
It's left. Does that
sound
right,
>> Mr. Chair
representative? I think that
that sounds just about right.
>> Ok. Thank you. And
also the,
if we can speak into
the mics a little bit
closer
and louder.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you.
If I'm might
get a little further
clarification as
um
I sat on this
Committee fourth
time and every
time I learn more
and the
money is split
and moved and so forth
in, in a number of ways.
Um
I am, I, I am
worried because of our
difficulty in tracking this
money and it is very
complex that
they an
intentional eroding
of some of the
funds um
for at least the purposes
that have been legislated so far,
particularly at the University of
New.
And I'm
worried that
in this
year, I understand
if I'm correct that there is
a study going
on looking at all the R
PSPs
education trying
to base
a budget for
higher eded on some
principles such as
enrollment and what have
you. And I'm worried
that in
that process,
that some of
this money because
we're not tracking it with
Legislation. I
mean, it, it happens
in the budgetary process,
but it's not, there's not a
record uh
per se except
in people's
memory perhaps
or wherever it's noted,
some, some trackable
place
that we're sure that
these functions at the University
of New Mexico are gonna be
appropriately funded
going forward as was
the intention whenever
this distribution was
set into
uh Legislation in the past.
And so I bring that
up mostly as a concern
and as we
progress through the year and
perhaps in one of our
later meetings, when the
budget is
final or the proposed
budget uh
from the
LFC
that we're
sure and particularly with
whatever reformation
or reform or
whatever we want to call it
comes into
the university budgets
that we have a way to
track, to be able to see
and to report out that
these functions are being
funded as they were
before and don't get
spun out in the was
somewhere. Thank
you very much if you
could put that down
and we could put that down as a report
coming back at one of our
later Committee meetings. And
uh so
thank you for that. I don't know if you have any
comment on that. Otherwise, I'll
recognize Senator
Lopez >> Mr.
Chairman.
I think you raise a good
point. That is correct that
starting last
year,
um
the Senate
Finance Committee Chair
and others had had
uh
collaborated with the higher
education department to start
looking at the,
the formula. The formula
issue has been actually
even further years back. They've
been looking at just at the higher ed
funding formula
from a few years back. And
then last year, all the issue
around our PSPs
BECA came up and
that's still a factor in
discussion. Certainly. So
I think uh the Chairman
raises a good point in like all
things, you know, the
trans parenting and
what is in the budget numbers
always can be a
challenge and I
think, and, and hard
sometimes to see because when they're
rolled up, you don't know all the component
pieces. And so
we will certainly take that
back to um
the higher education
analysts at the legislative finance
Committee. Thank you,
Mr., >> thank
you, Senator >> Lopez.
Thank you. Thank you
Mr. Chair. And
of course, we've
seen
a lot of movement
utilizing the tobacco settlement
monies over the years
and sometimes
disheartening other times,
I understand because we,
our budget tanked back in
the mid two
thousands and such. So
we did become
um a savior
in, in many different ways of helping
with the budget. And I
still remember, um,
co-chair, you know, with
representatives
Savedra,
who is Chair of the finance
Committee in the House saying, oh,
Senator, we're going to give it back, we're
going to give it back. We just need to, I
mean, it was that, but
as we know, we keep
asking for the, the money to
be made whole
then that I
call borrowed
from, from
our line items and the monies that we
have to really work on the cessation
programs. Um But
I do have just, just a
comment
um with the monies that are
um on the
spreadsheet in front of us, of course,
which is um
lines 32
through
36
you know, that, that totals
around. I, I think it listed
here about two point
you a little over $2 million
or so. And what
I, where did
those monies go mister Chair
madam Chair.
Um You know, because if,
if those monies aren't
being taken out of our pot
of dollars,
can we not, could we not
increase some of the
other, you know,
potential
to put more money in Indian
affairs or, you
know, someplace else where I
think these monies could be utilized.
Um Instead
I don't see an increase
other than in Medicaid
uh where the increase, I
mean,
to support the increase in
Medicaid dollars that were
appropriated.
Um And, and Mr.
Chair Madam Proair over
the years, we used to fund a lot of other
programs before too
Um Lovelace used to have
another program which I know
Lovelace has changed over the
years, but there are many
other support programs that we used
to put dollars in.
And of course, um
over, you know, there's always a
negotiation of who comes in
with dollars if it was at UN M
and other programs
that have lost money over the
years since we first
started.
Um
And
with the testimony that I
remember uh
coming in, even for these UN
M programs, the dollars that
they receive, even
like for the, the pediatric
oncology program.
Um and the Poison Control
Center, our dollars
helped to make their, their budgets
whole and
without our dollars, then
many times they were
hurting because
UN M uh the
Health Sciences Center
wasn't
appropriating, asking for
the money to be spent
appropriately.
So, as we know in the budget
process too, if you get
dollars to
plug that hole, then they
take money out someplace
else and give it maybe to another
program.
So um
there's always concerns as to
the shell game that goes
on and we know what
happens. Um
co-chair, it just, it's
the matter of what happens in
budgeting. It looks
good that maybe they got this, you
know, there's an increase, but the
RPS P program
is another shell game too
because, oh, you're
gonna get this money. But then
the administration and Board of
Regents don't like
to show that there's
began to do some other
processes
that next year you're not
money because you already got this
increase. And it's, it's
part of that other shell game that
happens within the Higher Ed
budget.
Talk about Higher Ed. And
we used to have a Higher Ed interim
Committee representative
Dennis PICO and I were both on
that, but we only lasted one
interim
because Higher Ed didn't like
it. And that was the
university president's
council and others
because they didn't want us asking
questions because they're overseen
by the Board of Regents.
So it's all of
that, that other
political stuff that goes
in and Health Sciences
Center, of course, is a beautiful
institution and does so much,
but
they're still beholden to what the Board
of Regents does
too.
So I just share this Mr.,
you know, co-chair Mr.
Madam co-chair, I
I know there's no money
here but where
did the money go within our budget
for further
distribution?
So it's just a question.
Um
Thank you, >> Mr.
Chairman, Senator Lopez.
The um the
amounts
the fy 24
amount
were appropriated
for fy 25
in these budgets out
of general Fund and
for
Higher Ed, it shows up
in the RPSP
for Department of Health.
It shows up in their base budget,
the other points.
Mr. Chairman that Senator
Lopez raises
around
the different entities and
who does what I will. I
will, I don't think I'll
address that. That's you. That's
the, those are good
comments. But yeah,
so um, just regarding the
appropriations though, those were
that specific amounts
definitely were offset
with General Fund for Fy
20.
I do want to confirm
that and then
I, I did want, um, Mr.
Brendan to talk about the bill because to
get to answering your question about
all the money and what do we have and how
can we maybe use it for
something
else
>> are going to those departments
specifically, at least,
at least it's on the record.
And you know, and if we
are have
our concerns that maybe
it's not, then maybe later
we, but
again, i
it's,
this is so complicated.
We are not
finance
appropriate reasons. But
again, I think
if I speak incorrectly
for the Committee, I think
we can say we are trying
to generate more
funds at the bottom. At
the end of the day,
we should be spending
somewhere
million on prevention
according to the CDC.
And we're spending
5.5
million
and uh
through, through, through
programs of doh, I
understand their activities
in Medicaid as well.
But again, I
think our, our goal is
to be sure that
we are helping
to
um save
individuals within the
State from
going down last year.
The the gateway to
addiction being
um tobacco,
vaping, nicotine,
etcetera that at the
end of the day, that's, that's
what we're trying to assure and
then utilizing the funds
appropriately. So that's
why I bring up this somewhat
pedantic. Uh
But I think important
piece of
information and, and tracking
of dollars to be sure we're
getting to the end. We want to get
to.
>> Yes. Um
Actually U and M Health
Science. Well, U and M in general,
um they also
put on their website, a
post Session summary
and you can look up these
appropriations, they have a little summary
and they say that it was maintained
whole and moved into the RPS.
So you can see that. And
the UN M Health
Sciences Center
CFO Miss Rebecca
Napier. Um she
was involved in reviewing
those documents as well.
So, so yeah, they
um I actually had engaged
with them and, and discussed this
prior to this meeting.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and one
final point on the Medicaid because
the Senator Senator Lopez
had mentioned Medicaid Medic, the
Medicaid appropriation actually
decreased. It didn't
increase. So if you look at the
Fy the second
column, Fy
24 appropriated
and then line
23 it
was
21
for Fy 24
21.6
million basically, and it
went down for Fy 25
to 13.1.
So for the straight
Medicaid program. So I just
wanted to make that clarification. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. >> Thank you. And I have
one last comment to make on
that and that's it.
Um I
I I'm I'm sure there
are
activities and reports
in place. Um
but there's nothing
like sunshine to make
the the plant grow
and again
a report from
you and m uh
in person putting that
towards the end, it
just can be brief
but
transparency
is, is, is key
in this very complicated
financial situation.
So I'd ask that we get
a report from U
and M brief
that we're spending the
money appropriately. We don't need
the show in just to get
there. Thank you
and
>> thank you, Mr. Chair
and Rivian. What
you just mentioned the decrease
of like
almost uh
8 million.
Why did that happen?
Why did we not put more funds
into Medicaid for
cessation?
Is that what that >> um
Mr. Chairman
Representative
Ferrari? So there's two
components that are
funded in
the budget here
for, for the Human
Services Department, Medicaid, there's
the breast and cervical
cancer treatment
that is lined
22
and that is, has
pretty much always been funded
with the, you know, the tobacco
settlement revenue. So
that was
flatt for fy
25. You see it's the same amount,
$1,255,400.
It's the same amount Fy 24
and Fy 25. And
then right underneath that
line 23 it just says
Medicaid and
for Fy 24
appropriated the second
column, it says
21.6
million rounding.
And then if you go to the last
column
line
23 it
says 13 point
14,142,800.
So that's a decrease.
And that piece,
the Medicaid piece is just
straight for the
Medicaid program. Overall,
the Medicaid breast and
cervical cancer treatment
component is specifically
earmarked for just that
purpose. So
what that means in effect
is we've used
not every year
but
relatively often
we have used tobacco
settlement revenue
to
augment our state's
Medicaid program
overall to add
to the general fund dollars and
the other revenue
that support Medicaid. We know
that we have almost 50%
of our state's population in
Medicaid and
a big portion
of them, they can receive
tobacco um
preve prevention and
cessation treatment under the Medicaid
programs under the managed care
organizations and of
course, then you have all the spin-off
concerns with, you know, behavioral
health that the Chair just
mentioned, um, you know, substance
use disorder in his comments
earlier and you
know how to tobacco cigarettes
is a gateway to,
to that. And you all heard
about that a lot last
year and the year before I believe
from Doctor
Zonis. And
um,
there are, of course, all the incumbent
illnesses that come when one
is addicted to, to, to
tobacco or array
of usages, which I'm
preaching in the choir here. So
that's why I think we use this
revenue for Medicaid.
But when that decrease, we of
course, offset it with general
fund because there's a whole array
of revenues that are used
to support our Medicaid
program in the State. And this was
just one of them, but it's
primarily
General
>> Mr. Chair and
Rian.
So you're
saying the
seven or 8
million for
Indian
Affairs Department
and their Medicaid
was offset with General
Fund. And where
did that money go? The
difference between the 21
and the
13.
>> Um
So uh
Mr. Chairman represented Ferrari.
So the Indian
Affairs, I'll just,
that's line
21
that's the expenditure there and that
stayed the same. So if you look in the
second column, fy 24
appropriated for
Indian
Affairs, it's
249.32
49.3. So in
the last column, so that stayed
flat. So that's
off to the side and they use
theirs in Indian Affairs
Department for tobacco
cessation, contracted
services. However,
if you just look at the
Medicaid line
item, so just
Medicaid, not Medicaid breast
and cervical cancer. So
that's on line
23.
And you look Medicaid and if you
look at the second
column, fy
24 appropriated,
it's
$21,590,900.
And if you look at the last column
still online,
23 for Medicaid, it
went down to
$13,142,800.
So that difference
was in effect offset
with General Fund dollars
in the Medicaid.
Does that make sense? Am I answering?
Yes, >> I'm sorry, I was
misinterpreting the
Indian Affairs Department
line because it was
bolded. I thought the
other lines under it were
part of that. So
that was totally
my mistake.
But so what
happened to the difference
of the seven?
>> So um oh,
you're asking in the terms of the
tobacco,
>> right? >> So
that's I think where we need to get
to, to Brendan to talk
about a little bit of the
bill.
>> Thank, thank you.
So, um
you know, I look,
I'm always thinking about
the HM Os, are we bailing
them out? You know, they're making
big. So I
want and really the
amount for the
um Medicaid
breast and cervical cancer
treatment. I mean, 1.2
million could be
two patients
um for,
for that treatment. So
who qualifies for? I mean,
how do they decide who uses
it and why are we picking up
that burden from the
hmos?
>> Um Mr.
Chair and madam
vice Chair. Uh
So
the um this
is just additional piece of
revenue, so
as I had indicated in my earlier
comments,
um
ok, so this revenue isn't
earmarks. So I, I want
to be clear about that. It's, this is
not the 1.2
million here
isn't earmarked for
a certain patient or a certain
cohort under
the Medicaid program and under
the managed care organizations, the
MC OS, this is just a
portion of revenue
that flows to support
overall the Medicaid program
and this piece though
it's, it is tied
to the service component,
but it's not tied to
patients to clients
to patients. So
the revenue is
the revenue is earmarked,
but it's not earmarked
to what we call in the Medicaid
program, a category of
eligibility because there's
not a breast and cervical
cancer category of
eligibility. And then
to, to your question, who
qualifies who's in effect?
Mr. Chair representative,
you're asking who's eligible.
So there
are
they
7 to 9 different categories
and there's probably more than that
categories of eligibility.
But um
basically for this type of
treatment, you would fall under one
of the main categories of
eligibility. So,
um
you know, so adults
up to 100 and 38%
of the federal poverty
level or
perhaps maybe even if you're
under the DD waiver or something like
that, you know, any, any of those
entities, any of those
people can
qualify.
>> Sorry. Seems a little strange,
but it seems like that's, we do a lot
of, a little strange. It doesn't
quite,
isn't quite explained. I
mean, it just, it doesn't make
sense to me, but it's been
there forever. So I won't,
I won't kill
it.
>> Thank you.
Any other questions at this
point? If not Brendan,
please mov'e forward.
Thank you, >> Mr.
Chair, Committee Members. My name
is Brendan Gray
Economist.
Um We've covered a lot
of ground and I'll be brief. I know
we're coming up
on time. Um
I want to start with um
madam Vice Chair, your
question about
the revenue, that
difference um and go
back to a point that
Rubin made in the very beginning
of the presentation.
So if you look at lines
14
and 15,
lines 14 and 15,
that's the appropriations
from the program
fund
to
programmatic uses.
So 1415, 1
from uh
the
Permanent Fund revenues
and then the other from the
program fund
balances.
And so those two
lines they tie out
with line
38. So on the
furthest right-hand column,
line 14 is 13
million. Line
15 is
7 million
and so line 38
is um
20 million.
So you look at that's um the
total amount of money that was
appropriated um in
fy 25.
And if you look back to fy
24 the middle
column, the
third
lines 14 and
15, the total
amount that was appropriated
from the program
two programmatic uses
was 13 million
and then 16 million
for a total online
38 of
29.
And so the change was
there was less money
available for
programmatic appropriations
in fy
25
because those
lines 14 and
15.
And if you look at the reason
why lines 14 and
15 went down primarily,
it was line 15
in fy 24
16 million
in
fundal
was appropriated. That's
in line in Fy
24. And then in Fy
25 in the
furthest right-hand column,
only 7 million
in program in
fundal was
appropriated. And so
that difference,
the Medicaid uh that, that
you were focusing in on
line
23.
That's primarily because there was
just fewer dollars
to appropriate
in that year because the fund we
had already appropriated out the fund
balance.
So I hope that
answers.
>> That does make sense now.
And with the, and
I guess we'll get into the
settlement of funding
that hopefully that will
go back
up.
>> Great. Great question, madam.
Vice Chair, Mr. Chair.
Um so
the program fund that's
tied to the permanent fund,
that's the top part of the part of the
chart. Um I'll talk
briefly about
what impacts the permanent
fund and ultimately the
appropriations to
uh the
programmatic uses.
Uh So there's the to
revenue, as you mentioned,
vice Chair, that's line
four.
So in fy 24
we were expecting that to
come 32
million. That's in the second
column. We're currently
expecting that to finish the
year around
26.8
million. So there is a decrease in
Fy 24. And then
in Fy 25
we expect that to be around
26.
So it's coming down
a little bit um from where we thought it
was gonna be at some point, but it's
staying pretty, pretty
flat in
Fy.
Um the other
big factor affecting
um and I'll pause
there to just
reiterate that half of that
revenue that we get from the
tobacco companies goes
into the program fund
for programmatic uses
that
the other factor that impacts
the permanent fund is line
six gains and
losses. So the State
Investment Council has been
charged by you all to go
out and earn
money on
balances
very well. Typically that's
line six.
Fy 23 was a really good
year in the stock market that
was 18
and we're expecting that to
to come down, but staying
pretty healthy around
14. Um
and we're constantly
thinking about where that's going to end
up. That's very complicated.
But in general, um this
is a healthy uh
reserve, a healthy fund
that I can get
good returns on.
So those are the two factors
that permanent
funds and
those all come down to
line
nine.
And I I just want to put some
something in perspective
um in general
from FY
20 if you were to look
at the ending permanent fund
balance in Fy 20.
So about five
years ago, at this
point,
the permanent fund has grown by
over 100 million
over that. So
thanks to Ural's
prudent management,
the legislature's prudent,
uh, the fund has
been able to grow
very healthily. That's
a 30% increase
over that time period.
There's a lot of factors that play
into that. It's been a really
good
so equities has, have
driven.
Um, but in general,
the permanent fund is
in good health and
the good news is
that
2024
legislative Session
should make the
fund even more
healthy. So a
transition
conclude my remarks
by, um,
so in the
2024 legislative
Session, Senate Bill
116
the major change in that
bill was
removing the tobacco settlement
permanent fund from State
reserve something you all have worked
on for a long
time. Uh, it was
held in reserves to
bolster the state's
fiscal
health to ratings
agencies. Uh, there's a
lot of good reasons to remove it from
observes presents a more
transparent picture um
to those rating acies
which is good. Um But
it also allows the State
Investment Council to be
more aggressive in
investing in
investing the permanent fund
just like it does with other
large
permanent.
And so uh first in
perspective, uh a
0.5%
point increase in
the returns that the fund
gets. So a pretty
small increase
could generate
30 more,
30 million additional
dollars in the
permanent fund balance in five
years. So thanks to
Centreville 116
the fund could be $30
million larger than it
would have otherwise been. And
of course, that's just kind of on the
low end 0.5%
that much. Let's say they get
1% point additional
return that could be 60
million. Um
And so those amounts
quickly add up. And
then the, the best
news is that those
increases in the
permanent fund balance,
those translate to
higher
programmatic uses
that the legislature can choose
to appropriate. And so
a 0.5%
increase
appropriated
in
1 to $2 million
in that
you
might not like a lot, but
that's 5 to 10%
increase in
appropriations
appropriate and that
continue
to.
So I think that covers uh the
impacts of Senator
116
and I'm happy to answer any other
revenue questions or
questions on.
>> Thank you very much. I, I do
have some questions when I turning
to the
Committee
or if you want me
to
the sequela and,
and what actually happens and
my understanding which
May or May not be
correct.
Um So again,
thank you, Brandon.
My understanding
is that
as this money transfers
into the fund and it
earns a
better, there's a better rate of
return
that the
better rate of
return
goes back into
the fund itself
until
until the
rate of return
on an annual basis
exceeds
the settlement
that comes in on an annual
basis.
Then when that
happened,
that return,
and I don't know if it's part of
it, all of it, the difference
in it then can be
used for
programmatic funds.
But the, the
tripwire for that
is that it all
just goes into the fund
and keeps
earning. And so, I
mean, eventually you get
there. But
um
my question is
once, once that
is tripped, so
if we're looking at
maybe 25 million
coming in
in annual
um
revenue from the
settlement, but the
fund say
brings in through
its investments, 30
million
and does
all that 30
million
is allowed to be
used for
programmatic purposes
or only
55 million. And
I have some follow-ups to
that. Thank you,
>> Mister Chair. A great
question. Um You
hip nail and head. That's a
small detail that you're absolutely
right about. So
the, the way the law is written,
it's a test. The
distribution is a test
to the program fund.
It's 50%
of the to
or, and this is
getting to your point or it's
4.7%
of the ending
balance of the
permanent fund for the last,
the average ending balance
for
the
rolling.
And so Mister
Chair
with a, so
as the permanent
fund generates
additional returns, as we
see those higher returns
that is going to be tripped
to your, to your point
and those the
amount available for appropriation
should continue to increase.
And the even better news is
that um LFC
projections,
sic projections say
we're very close to
that point. We might even cross
it this year
depending on how the, how
the calendar year, how
the, how the
year for
the, for the
fund. And so,
uh moving forward
distributions to the program
fund should be that
4.7%.
And those big
years where we're getting $30
million in gains,
um We should see more
of that translating
down
money available for
appropriation.
>> Uh Thank
you.
Um And, and we
could do this offline,
but I'd like to see
that math in a
formula
because at the end of the day,
in my simple mind, I
have to come back to
do. We have
more money to spend
on prevention and
intervention directly.
And again, that's what it all
goes back to.
Um And
I, I think I, I
understand the concepts
but there are three or
four pieces of that. I'm still
not fully sure on. I
think what I heard you say
is that if we trip
the 4.7%
on a rolling average,
then the money that comes
in from that is earned
uh through that above
the, and I don't know if it's
above the 4.7%
or includes the
4.7%.
But what I'm trying to find
is uh some
examples, what
dollar amount
is going to be available to
us when to
be able to spend on
prevention and cessation.
Other than uh
what I would
uh say, my
impression is this meager
5.4 million,
whatever, a little bit gets spent
in Medicaid. Again,
we're, we're operating in a
deficit of 20
million in terms of
recommended prevention
intervention money.
Uh When we look at CDC
standards as a
State
>> Mr. Chair, I would be
more than happy to give you those
formulas, those
numbers.
And I apologize if I was
unclear
in
so the amount that the
State Investment Council
earns on behalf
of the legislature,
all of that amount is
put back into the permanent
fund and the
4.7%
is distributed
regardless um
every year for
program,
once we trip that once we
trip and the
good news with that is if we have a
down year in the stock
market at the
distribution appropriations
that you all make are untouched.
Um And if we have a good year,
then those that, that money
is able to build
up and
build up the appropriations that
you are and
at your disposal. >> Thank
you. Just one last clarifying
question and then please
others.
Um
So again, I'm
kind of trying to come
down to concrete and this
impacts what other
Legislation we might
put through.
Again. The goal
here is to
reduce the number
of youth who
take up vaping, who
then can go on to other
addictions. That, that's
the endpoint we want here.
Again, we have a meager
spent in
that what I'd like.
So the question
I have last year, we almost
had a bill that raised the
tax on
vaping to
40 or 44%.
Um And,
um, it, it, it just fell
short through a
technical error at the
end. Um
so we again,
I'm looking at prevention.
So money
is cost
is shown to be the best
deterrent uh to
uptake. Um,
but also education
apparently comes in very
close behind flavors.
And so I'm wondering when
we're gonna get the money, more
money to spend on
prevention and
then how much harder do
I work at
getting the additional or
we work at
getting the additional tax?
So this is a tactic,
somewhat of a tactical but
strategic question.
So that's why it
would be nice to see
if. And I, again,
I'm willing to work with you
to lay this out in layman's
language through the
formulas. So
I'm wondering when,
how much money maybe we're gonna
get and when we're
going to get it to devote
to prevention. So
that, that's the, the
genesis of my
questions here. Thank
you.
And do you want to
answer that or, or just
say I get it and we'll work on
it and I otherwise
can go to
Senator.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and Members of the Committee
and I'm glad you mentioned that because
it, if I don't, if
I don't recall is
that our schools do not
have the money to
kind of do the prevention
and um some of the
things that even setting up
detectors, they don't
have that money. So
how do we get it to them as fast
as we can by this budget
season so that they can
tackle the issue? Um Thank
you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Do you have more
uh >> Mr.
Chair, I all to say
I would be happy to put that out. I
have projections going out
and would be happy to give them to you to show
the
difference.
>> Great. Why don't you and I
work on that and
some at a
future one of our future
meetings, we'll see if we can explain
it like uh
I need it like I'm a five
year old. So >> thank you,
Mr. Chairman, I'll add to that
point. So basically,
um this
is how the budget is really
built overall.
So the economists
every year this ok, a
little view into the
sausage making factory,
the economists
across all
our revenue sources, right? We
have
many revenue
sources, the game protection
fund, you know, pick your, pick your
area, you know, we have lots
of revenue sources.
So all the
economists are working on all of
these and then
the the budget analysts at
Legislative Finance Committee, we're
looking at all the revenue sources
also and we start
putting the budgets together beginning
September 1st through the fall.
And December, we're working
on all these projections and
we have to
do our best job, all of us
together to figure out what the
projections are, build
a request that we
then the a budget
recommendation that then
goes to you all
starting in January.
So to answer your
questions, Mr. Chairman,
basically, we'll be
getting projections,
we'll be working throughout the
fall this
um so the the
piece, your message
will take it back the
Department of Health um
analyst at LFC because
that's where you're wanting to
invest. I think,
you know, the any
extra revenue, it sounds
like in Department of Health and tobacco
cessation. So
we'll look at the, we look at
the revenue projections
for all these sources
everywhere and
then make,
you know, put, put the budget together.
So if there's extra,
she'll, she'll work with the, we
all work with the economists as we work
with them, then we can look and see
if there's extra revenue in the fall. We
can talk to you Mr. Chairman and
you know, and then try and look
if there is and, and look at
investing that in the
place you just indicated.
>> Thank you very
much,
MS Escobar
Ruby. Thank you
and I'm sorry, I forgot
your last name,
my apologies.
Um We,
we, I
think we have a, a pretty
good explanation for this
point and I think we
are at a point where we're over
and we can mov'e on. But I, I
do
would like to make one
observation. I'm glad to
see more
economists in the
depart in, in the legislative
finance Committee. Um
I'm hoping
and, and this is part of
us being able to make our
rationale. Uh
It sounds like the role of
the economist is to project
future revenues,
looking at all the
variables and, and
sources of revenue.
Uh But I would hope and I, I'm
taking this from Representative
Thompson who has brought
this up at a number of meetings.
What we don't seem
to do is we get the
reports is look at
the impact on
that much in the manner
of what the congressional budget
office does. So
part of our making, our
argument is we
would really love to see
an call it
ancon analysis
that looks at the secondary
impacts on
generation of
savings in the cost
of care in
Medicaid time
so that we really can look
at ro I of what we're
doing, not just what are the
sources of revenue. And,
and again, I've
heard the representative bringing
up a number of meetings and
I'm hoping that this will
be a recurrent thing, but it's
really important to us
here. In other words,
are we, if we stopped,
if we stop 20%
of youth from
uptake of
vaping, what
is the economic impact
of that? And of course,
more importantly, the quality of
life that and I know that's
more subjective. But anyway, thank you
both for excellent
presentations this
morning.
Good. Yeah, thank
you.
Um We, I
think I need to make a motion
to go into Executive
Session.
I'm sorry, you can we have a
motion so mov'e mister
Chair,
all those in favor signify by
saying I I
OK, we are moving into
Executive Session. Thank you.
