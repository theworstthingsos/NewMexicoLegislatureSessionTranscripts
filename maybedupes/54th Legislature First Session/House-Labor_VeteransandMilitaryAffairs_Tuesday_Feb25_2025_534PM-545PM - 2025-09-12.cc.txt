there was no state law or law
that they could locate that
would designate the state flag
to be treated um in this manner,
which is consistent with um the
way the United States flag is,
is treated.
Um, the bill tracks the federal
language, um, I believe
verbatim.
Um, in the, um,
FIR, it's cited, its sites and
significant issues. The US flag
cold code Title 4 chapter 1
provides guidelines.
Um, given I inherited this, I'd
asked staff to look up that
particular provision and
My question was, why don't we
just cite it?
And so what we discovered was
that um the language that is in
this bill was pulled out.
Anybody on Zoom who wishes to
speak in opposition of this
bill.
Anyone
On Zoom, who wishes to speak in
favor of House Bill.
468.
Raise your hand, please then.
OK, then on Zoom and I don't see
anybody but Mr. Sargent in the
audience, so, um.
Yeah,
we'll, we'll go to committee.
Just real quick, Madam Chair,
thank you, um.
Represented for bringing this
together, you know, it's
sometimes something as simple as
how do we dispose of a flag.
It was a question and how to do
it should not go in the, in the
trash, um, you should contact
your American Legion.
Usually, there are, you can look
up on our website sometimes in
your areas where, Madam Chair
Representative, where you would
Uh, dispose of that and we will
in, in the Grant County
southwest area. I, I'm actually
In, in charge of that for US
flags. And so we work with the
American Legion and they collect
them.
Uh, I believe Ace Hardware helps
in several places do that.
And they, they come.
Probably, I don't know, every 2
weeks and bring you a lot of
flags.
And then we dispose of them
properly. So it's a, it's a nice
program. I'm glad that they're
including the, the uh New Mexico
flag finally. Thank you, Mr.
Madam Chair. Thank you, officer.
Anyone else with uh
representative. Um I just want
to thank you for sponsoring this
bill. It's a beautiful bill. And
it means so much. um, and I
noticed that in the summary, it
would go into effect 90 days or
June 20th and
That seems very reasonable.
Thank you.
Ma'am representative
Next we have Representative
Johnson.
Madam Chair, if there are no
more. I'm gonna hold that for
right now because I do have a
thank you for that motion.
representative, I have just
Um
Did you mention that?
Um
There was this bill mirrored.
The provisions in the federal
government.
Uh, yes, Madam Chair. And is
that thank you. Is that the um
US flag code title 4 Chapter.
Yes, ma'am. OK, and then does
the
Um, this code referred to
burning of the flag as an
option.
Yes, madam chair.
I wanted to make double.
It's been mentioned to me from
members of American Legion, the
Catholic war veteran, forget the
other, um, well then maybe you
have it here, the VFWs that.
are in my area that they
conformity with the federal law
would refer to burning when
broth.
So, um,
I'm taking your word for it
there, they have valid concern
because Bernie knows the flag is
a violation of federal law and
violation of the so um.
I'm hoping I didn't have time to
look erect.
That's the only reference um
that.
So, all right, we're, you're on
record and um we're good to go.
We have a motion, a do pass
motion made by representative
Johnson and seconded. Is there
any opposition?
Any position.
So, Madam Chair, uh, basically,
there, the, the idea of burning
the flag.
It has to be done discreetly
with respect, right? So burning
the flag is 111 way is if you
burn the flag out there to make
a statement.
Is one thing that's.
What, what you're referring to.
Burning the burning the flag in
discreetly.
Uh, through a different manner,
uh, is, is the acceptable way.
Thank you, Madam. Yes, I
understand. OK, so any
opposition? All right, we have a
Du pass and for those that
weren't repeat, we had a 4:38
House Bill was moved to
Thursday.
And then on the Thursday agenda,
House Bill 484 was uh rolled
indefinitely just as seeing no
other business, we are.
