Thank you for, uh
In a long day in respect to this
Chairman. I want to keep this
kinda simple and straightforward
to you guys can get on with your
day. This is the third time
Chairman committee that
We've run this bill.
In 2022.
That passed every committee
house and the Senate floor with
no
Substance. No, no. No votes.
In 2002 committees, government
and then judiciary.
And then got stuck on the house
floor.
So
This feels pretty
straightforward and simple. What
it does is, it takes the 2018
legislation.
There was passed, which was
house Bill 69 at the time.
And
Adds 4%.
A year or two.
Potential elected Ghani official
salaries, then ties it to the C
P I so we don't ever have to
mess with this again.
As each of you are aware.
Uh, um, Elected county official,
If if raises are an option, they
do not happen for the officials
that are in office county clerk
or for the next assessor

With that I can go as deep into
this as you want, or we can keep
it. This legislation.
Anybody in opposition to speak
about it.
Committee at this time.
Representative Martinez.
Thank you, Mr Chair,
Representative Pettigrew, that
is correct. Chairman and thank
you, Mr with respected went

through

deputies.

Chairman represent directly
Ah!
The state chairman and
representative. Yes. This would
give the county commission the
ability to increase what each
elected official is able to get
to doesn't necessarily mean that
that's what's going to happen.
But the it's it's an actor the
county do that, and then as they
go through, um, new election, Mr
Chair, Thank you very much. This
is basically
Has no effect on on the stage.
Correct me. I'm just gonna make
a statement so I can run through
his kind of quick.
Um, the only thing that the only
implication I ever saw
Um, the the thing is, if you
look, I don't know on the fiscal
impact report. I was just
looking at salaries and you just
look at the salaries. What?
What they are and what they
And you know everyone's gotten.
We all know that inflation has
affected us.
Mr Chair.
Quite a bit since 2018 imagine
not getting a a
A raise since 28 6 years without
a raise. And although these are
you know some of some positions,
although some positions
Seems, seems nice. You know a
Seems, seems nice, You know,
decent salary, depending on the
class that you fall based on
population. I'm assuming that
they're based on population,
right? Correct rations. And so
if you look top to class a
they're they're a little bit
higher, but you get down here.
Uh, into
Ah, the Class B with
intermediate valuations.
On the bottom county
Commissioner makes $21,500 you
get into a class H $15,800.
And so you know, and I know that
these classes that we're talking
about are going to be, uh, less
populated.
Which means you've got a bigger
you've got a big district, but
you're having to travel. That's
rule. New Mexico. I mean,
imagine, Look at some of these
in my understanding this right?
The sure
Um, I believe that this 7900. If
it's the one, I think you're
referring to. Yes, I mean, it's
just shocking to see even that
those numbers I don't really I
mean, this is this is from the F
I R. So regardless of that's a
tyrant.
This is now This is part time.
By the way, Yes, I see that This
is him. But still my point that
I'm making is if you just look
here at a current salary for
Class B.
$21,000 you've got something
appropriate. Judge makes $15,000
just proposing that you know
your county Commissioner 6 $6000
rate. I just
For me, Mr. Chair. I haven't We
voted on this before, And so,
um, this is something that's
been bedded number of times as
well that it doesn't really end.
Uh
Have a direct impact to our
state budget. It's basically
saying that we're just saying
here.
We're allowing the county
themselves to
Adopted.
And so they all based on their
own budgets.
We're just raising the ceiling.
Is the way I understand it. Is
that right, Mr Mr Chair.
Mr Chair and representative.
You're exactly right. We're
giving. We're putting a new
ceiling and there so that as
county commissions make that
choice.
They can. They can provide those
races. Let me give you an
example.
The clerk and in Berna. Leo
County makes $86,625.
The deputy clerk makes 116,005
year apparent for journal Bernie
Leo County.
Would take a $30,000 cutting
pact.
So, Mr Chair, I I just think
this is a reasonable request,
especially being that it's not,
You know, the state of New
Mexico's budget at all. It's
just we're basically checkmark
to raise that ceiling, so I'm in
full support of this, Mr Chair
again. They will be our
retirement schedule that way, so
and they just they don't have a
lot of questions being the past.
I want to see unanimously twice.
Chairman representative. It's
passed the House and the Senate
unanimously.
Once past two committees in the
House last year.
Prior to that. This is
interesting. 2002 Senate Bill
41.
The bill the law was chapter
legislation was chapter 2006 run
again. It was chapter 2009. It
was chapter 2013. It was chapter
2018. It was chapter 2022
pockets. I think that's just,
you know, for. I don't know all
the reasons and I
I don't think I need to get into
that. I think what matters is I
believe it. Everyone, um
Deserves. Uh, these people that
are
Based based in their salaries
back in 2018 ability, lost
money, Mr Chair to attract any
new new people total.
Anybody else, Mr. Chair?
Incentive. Um, I noticed in some
of the tables, evaluation and
intermediate. I don't see those
terms.
Chairman and representative
Thank you for the question they
would be referenced in 4-44 Dash
comes with me. I will be honest
out of three years. You're the
first person chairman. Question,
Mr Chair. A. You want to
classification announce are done
every two years by the
Legislature. They resided fa and
they're based upon the property
valuations in the population for
each county.
So we have, of course, Class
A's, which are the larger
counties. They dissolved the
Class C's and did a B high and a
B intermediate. And then we have
a class H, of which the only one
is Los Alamos. So that's what
those are referencing is that
classification based on
population and property tax
value for that, Mr Chair? Thank
you.
Yes.
Chairman. Uh
Have a ballpark, Mr Chair in
151,000, and then the watch out.
Yeah.
And then the lieutenant governor
is in the eighties.
Chairman. Um I would add to that
that are sheriffs. Don't get a
house sheriffs Don't get a house
paid for
But
I mean, we don't we don't We
don't even get a car.
So here's my other question.
Question is, and I hear this
over and over again.
The clerk.
They don't have to be there 40
hours a week.
They can it and there is no
obligation to speak specifically
for the county clerks in my neck
of the woods, and I know every
obligation, the obligation of
gonna let, uh question
Thank you, Mr Chair. It's
interesting. We often hear the
comment about. They only have to
work eight hours a month. And
the reality is that's not
actually what the statute says
the statues for individuals such
as the assessors, the clerks,
treasures and sheriffs, they are
often daily, supervising staffs
that can range between five to
as many as 40 or 50 people.
I think they are directly
obligated to the voters and the
other county arms to make sure
that those offices are running
properly. Other than that, I
couldn't quantify what each one
actually works.
30 days.
Mr Chair. That's the implication
by that 30 day, but it doesn't
actually state that too.
Mr Chair. There are parts in the
statute that talk about if they
have a failure to execute their
office. And so when we do see
removals that is usually the
language that's used by the
other, Um
Right?
Chairman. I would never accuse
you of making things up. That's
I will say that
In 2022, and I presented this in
2023. When I presented this.
I've had two questions this time
That that, um I know what
Our clerk. Our our treasurer are
assessor German. The reason why
are they are expected to, um
Fulfill a part time duty.
Usually about 1/4 to 1 3rd of
what our assessors are clerks
and so on.
And I understand that.
Yeah. Anyway, With that in mind,
I have a proper motion. So if
you will call the roll
Yes.
Zero that I A and we are done
for the day.
Everybody have a good evening.
Nobody gets
And we're out before midnight.
