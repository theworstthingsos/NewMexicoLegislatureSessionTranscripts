And Zuni as well as
their assistant
superintendent, Giovanna
Hanks and
CFO
Martin
Romine.
Today, we're gonna be talking a bit about
the local school districts and the
status of their financial
situation as well as their
performance and
some of the progress that they've made
since the Martinez
Yazzie ruling.
One thing you'll notice as you look
at some of the performance
reports is that,
uh, student proficiency
rates continue to
fall below
statewide averages. Although
we are seeing some promising
closing of the gaps
for Native American
students. I think
what's difficult to
ascertain is sort of
progress that's happened since
the pandemic, given that we
switched tests and there was a
lapse in testing
during that time. But the
initial progress from
the first two rounds of the new
assessment appear to be
promising,
uh, four year graduation rates
for both districts do
appear to be
uh closely tied
to the statewide average.
Uh, Zuni
does appear to have a higher
rate in the last reported
four year graduation than
the statewide
average.
Another concerning
trend though is the
high rates of chronic
absenteeism, which you'll also
note on the far right
top right corner,
which are higher in both
districts um
since the pandemic, although
Zuni has fallen below the
say white average
in the last
report.
One thing that has also been
a notable trend is an
sharp increase
in funding for both districts,
particularly after
fiscal year 22.
That's largely due
to uh bills
that was passed uh
sponsored by Representative
Lunch from House Bill Six which
removed the impact aid
credit from the
state funding formula.
Thus allowing the district to
generate a larger
seg appropriation.
You'll see that significant
bump in
SCG
following fiscal year
22.
We've also seen a large
projected increase in the use
of cash assets
and a large spending
increase in both personnel
but also property
services. So
both districts have been investing
heavily in their people but
also in capital
outlay and
I'm sure they'll go into more detail
on that as well.
What we've also noticed
in the reporting is that
the districts are spending
a lot of their at risk funding.
Although in very different
categories, Gallup
particularly is spending it on
supplies followed
by salaries. While
Zuni Zuni is
primarily spending it on
salaries and benefits.
Both districts have extended
their calendars since the
Martinez Yazzie ruling
Gallup recently
moving to 100 and 89
student learning days with a
combination of 38
days of embedded professional
development that's
up from 100 and 78
student learning days. Prior to
the ruling,
Zuni is providing 100 and 82
student learning days and that is
up from 180 days
prior to
the ruling,
both districts have
reported consulting with
their local tribes.
Uh The last reported
consultation was in April of
2023 for Gallup
and in May of
22
in Zuni
and both districts are
actively pursuing
projects. Uh
Some in conjunction with the
Council Galp
has an impressive 10
active projects right
now. A lot of them major
high school replacements.
Um They do have
better statewide facility
condition indices than
their peers.
And with that, I will turn it over
to the school district
superintendents of starting
with Mr Hyatt uh
to provide for the
comment. Thank
you.
>> Thank you for that so
much.
There we go.
Thank you, Mr Lou for the introduction.
Um Mr
Chair members of the committee
and staff, thank you for
coming out to Gallup and
I guess grants a few days ago,
we appreciate you traveling all the way out
here. Um
And Mr Chair, thanks
for driving down the road and
Representative
Lundstrom.
>> I did notice today when I signed
for DM, I didn't have
mileage. >> That's,
that's,
it's
a you win when
you're driving a long ways away and you
kind of lose them when you get to kind
of when you're when you're going close to home,
but that's the prerogative
of the chair, I guess.
Um We uh I'm
joined here again with Giovanna
Hanks. Uh She is the
deputy superintendent for
Gall mckinley County schools
and I'd be remiss to
not say that if you have any
questions about
schools,
finance, how
legislation has affected
schools financially.
Um, analysts do
a great job, but it's also
good to get good information on the
ground. Um M Hanks
is in, in my opinion, and I don't
think, I think in many people's
opinion, leading
expert on education
funding in New Mexico. And
so any questions you
have, she, she can answer. And I, and,
and next to her, I would,
Mr Roma also is
extremely knowledgeable. Um
and probably the, the two best
business official
in the state of Mexico for
education.
I'm joined also here with me with
board members. Some of them
may be coming in as, as we go
on. But I wanted for those that are here.
I want to make sure I introduce our,
our board president,
Mr Chris Mortensen.
We also have
poss, our vice president.
I'm not sure if he's here, Charles
Long uh Secretary
of the board
Michaels.
Uh We also have board members,
Kevin Mitchell
and board member
Priscilla Benali, who's
also here with me, with us
and my two assistant
superintendents are also
here. Um
M Caon Montagne
and Mr Wade
Bell.
Um We,
we provided a lot of information.
I'm not going to go over all this information,
but just to show it really quick, we have a,
an overview of the school district
from a high level of the work
that we're doing provided
you a copy of our strategic
plan that really outlines
the goals and objectives of the school district.
You can really see where we focus
our, our dollars uh
for this particular group. It's probably the most
interesting for you um
where our money is going towards
so that we can affect uh students
in a positive way to improve their,
their academics. We
also provided a one
pager on our career pathway
work which we've been heavily invested
in and I'll talk a little bit more about that later
on. Um And then
lastly provided a
copy of our
recent uh first
edition. We have third edition coming
out soon of our elevate
magazine, which is our way we
communicate to all mckinley
County residents. Um
and and actually some areas
around mckinley County to get
information about things
happening in the school district,
growth areas of
concern and things like
that.
Um We also provided
you a packet, a powerpoint
packet of information that we're
going to cover today. We do appreciate the
topics. Uh Finance
is obviously important to us as it
is you, especially when it comes
to education and the amount of money that you
spend in education
each year. Uh
But we also appreciate the topics
on cash balances. We're gonna be talking
about that. Um
Quite a bit. We'll also
be talking about some of the financial things that
Mr Liu talked about.
Um and Yazzie Martinez
I think it was two years ago. You were
here. We, we gave
you some suggestions
from our point of view on
things that could improve with respect
to Yazzie Martinez.
Um, as we are a
plaintiff in that lawsuit,
many people don't know that we
recently dissolved
ourselves from the regular
group of plaintiffs. Uh We
felt that some of the things that they were doing
were not in line with what we
felt. The Ozzie Martinez
lawsuit was support
suppo supposed to resolve.
And so we actually have our own council
as gallop mckinley County Schools
currently.
Um
So to start, I want to give you a quick overview
of school district. And
before we start our presentation,
um one of
the,
one of the things that many of
you probably know because I see many familiar
faces that are on this committee or at
least in other committees that we presented
to. Um But Gall
mckinley County Schools is the
largest geographical
school district in the state of New
Mexico. Um
It's the most sparse
also. Uh We
serve seven distinct
communities and
actually we're so sparse that we're, I
think we're number three or four in the
country as far as sparsity
of all school districts in the
nation. I think Alaska
Hawaii, there might be one in Nevada
that might, might beat us in
sparsity. But that,
that provides some unique challenges
for us because we have micro
districts that you would see like, like
on the east side of the state and
also um larger
districts um in other
parts of the state, similar to the size
of Gallup.
We have 32 schools
two thou approximately 2000
employees, 700
teachers, um
80 per most of our staff
is Native American.
Uh most of our students,
80 approximately 80%
are Native American, about 15
Hispanic population
and about fif and about 5%
have a mix of
students. Um
Part of that challenge,
Mr Mr Lieu talked about
is because a significant
portion of our, our
the land in
mckinley County
is tribal land, but approximately
80%
making it
nontaxable
that has caused
um obviously the need for
things like PS A and
PSCOC,
something that we have to rely heavily
on in order to construct
buildings that we need to, to keep
up. We have 32 schools.
And so if you average out of school every
45 to 50 years,
we have to build a school every year and
a half in order to keep up.
Um And that provides a huge
challenge. We're, we're in a huge hole
right now. Um
even with the return of impact
aid and we'll talk more about
that later on because
of cost rising because of
the hole that was already dug
for us to try to dig out
of. Um it, it's,
it's a significant challenge. We'll
go into more detail on that.
We, we, we
are concerned about our bonding
capacity, but to make
myself myself feel
better, I just think I could be
Zuni. And
so um
that makes me, it makes me get through
the day
uh with
the closing of our power plants has
also been a significant driver of
reduction in bonding
capacity for us. And it's,
it's really hurting us and
causing us to not only rely more
on PS A
and PSCOC,
even though we're proud of and
exci excited for the legislation
that was passed to reduce our
match with the
and receiving impact aid. But
then costs have tripled, which is
completely offset that.
So we're less dire than we
would have been, but we still
have some dire circumstances that we're
facing.
Um Lastly, I just want to mention
that we have a high rate of
poverty, uh the most
impoverished
population in the State of New
Mexico. We're in the
bottom 50 for counties
and poverty in the country
um which also poses some
significant challenges for
us when uh and I'll talk a little
bit about that here in, in the first part
of our presentation.
Um Lastly, um I just want to
make sure I, I mentioned that
this is obviously a unique
area of, of the
state and we're very, very
proud of the culture and diversity that
we have in this part of New
Mexico. And that's
a, that's a, that's an asset for us
here in our community and our school
district,
I want to start with our first slide
on page one or it's actually page
two. It's called student
focus and successes.
Uh Mr Lou talked a little about proficiency
rates. I think you're, there's a little bit
of data that's, that's a little bit
off on there, but that's ok.
Um I think he, for the
most part he, he spot on
with, with proficiency
rates for Gall mckinley County
schools. Prior to the
pandemic, we have done
a lot of work and, and still
are doing that work at improving
proficiency scores
in the old days, which is a 15
years ago or maybe even
12 years ago. We were the one of the
lowest performing school districts
in the State of New Mexico as far as
proficiency rates
um
prior to the pandemic.
Literally as of the pandemic was
happening, we were
one year away as far as the
trend data from passing the
proficiency rate of the state of
Mexico for reading.
Uh that was a five
year in increase
and that's kind of what I'm saying, part of that data
2019 was actually higher
than that. I'm not sure why it shows that it's lower
because it was a steady increase
of reading proficiency. And So
for our part, our neck of the woods
and for where we were at, that
was a significant acco accomplishment.
Um, and we had a really good
trend moving forward until the
pandemic hit. And I hate to
talk about the pandemic. I'm tired
of talking about the pandemic,
but it's, it slapped us
down. It, it was a significant
problem for us. Not
only because obviously
the whole state was,
studentss were out of school, but
the next year, the governor
allowed through the
Secretary of Education, allowed
students to stay home if they chose.
And in our area that was
significant.
Um, we had
probably
80%
stu of students not going to
school for that second year. It was, it
was pretty, pretty drastic.
I'm not going to school as we in
person. I mean, um, obviously
we had online opportunities
but for most
students, that's not, not the best
opportunity,
attendance wise. Uh, since
the pandemic, uh, you can see,
we, we started out
74%. It's
hard to educate students
when,
um, one out
of every three,
almost 3, 3.5 days you're
out of school. Uh,
but since then to
date this year,
and we'll have to do a lot of work at the
end of this year. But we've, we're
actually at 90%
attendance rate for this year.
And so we've had a, we've
pumped in a lot of dollars from COVID
relief funds to help with
our attendance and
that's, that's paying off.
Although those dollars are pretty much
gone graduation
rate, as I mentioned, similar
to state average since the pandemic,
we, we were, we were again on a
steady increase kind of matched our
proficiency growth.
Um But since the, but the state
a but then we dropped below the state
average by a percent this last
year. Um
Part of that is we have so many
students drop out during
uh virtual learning
that that's going that trend
and the, and those that learning loss
that was experienced then or that trend of
students that have dropped out,
that's going to affect our, our scores.
Although we're not sure that the
state's graduation rates
are accurate because
obviously, with the federal report,
we're a little concerned that we're not getting
accurate data uh for
graduation rates. Um
especially after this last report from
the Feds.
Um career pathways
is a focus
of our school district. You'll see in our strategic
plan, we're really focused on
making sure students are prepared for
their careers. Graduation
is great. But our school board is
very focused on helping
students graduation is
just a step, a milestone that
they reach. There's much
more beyond that, that we need to
prepare our students for. And
so we have a lot of focus in our
schools district and invested
millions of dollars
from our COVID relief
funds and making sure that we are set
up to make sure students have
opportunities for career
exploration um
experience in internships,
um experience in making sure the
linked learning from the core
areas of instruction are
linked to their
career uh
goals and the career
pathways that they're in.
We're actually trying to build a new school
now uh on the
on the east side of town to provide
even more career technical
opportunities for our students
that all students in the county
can participate in. Um
We can't provide it in every
community because of
cost of that, that we,
so you see across New Mexico, a lot
of school districts having some central
CTE programs to help,
give more opportunity.
Um Mentioned
internships. We also have a soft
skills program that we
have sixth grade through 12th
that all students have to participate
in. And I think we're pretty
unique in that I think you're
seeing it more and more across the
country, but
teaching students employability
skills is beneficial not
only to their future careers and
them getting those skills to be
employable when they graduate,
but also helps them be better
students. And so we're seeing
some benefits from that work
happening at an early age. And
so that's why we started in sixth
grade.
We have an early college program
that we started not too many years
ago. Uh It's now one of the, I think
it's the I I haven't found one
larger per capita
as far as students in an early
college program on a
college campus that I haven't
found one in the Western United
States. I haven't looked in the eastern
yet, but given the
size of our district, we have a
significant number of students
that are enrolled in early college program,
which is also part of our college
career readiness
parent engagement. We've had a lot of
success. We actually copied
Zuni a little bit. We took some,
took some uh
things that I learned when I worked
there um about
how we can do better at making sure we
engage parents and students
academics. Um So
our parent teacher conferences,
we used to get maybe 50%.
We're at 9/95 percent.
Now, we've changed
the way that we approach
that and making sure that we give
multiple opportunities
um and require that our
teachers are in contact with
parents. And so twice a year,
we have steadily increased that
number. Um I'm not sure we can grow
much more, but we're gonna
try
on our discipline referral rate. We've
had a lot of focus on making
sure that we're being proactive
with uh student
discipline. Uh We
have actually decreased that
number almost in half from
numbers prior as far as
discipline rates and
dispositions that are
counted by the State of New
Mexico. We actually
had a, an odd, I thought it
was an odd one but it was seem
to catch steam with some reporters trying
to say that our Native
American majority school
district as far as
staff is discriminating
against native American students
by, uh, disciplining them at
a higher rate. And
some people have, have jumped on
that bandwagon to
try to say that. That's, uh, that's
true. Actually, it's not, it's not
true. We have
actually the Secretary of Education,
um, acknowledged that the,
the data in the state is wrong,
that was used to make that
determination. And that
may be something that not
necessarily this particular group, but maybe
the LES C would want to look at
and making sure that they have clear
definitions and accurate data
coming in for that reporting. There's no
controls over that data.
As the secretary acknowledged,
we also are finishing an
independent audit. And as of right now,
we've heard that there is also
no um
truth to the claim that
there's discrimination for
Native Americans and discipline in our
school district.
And so that
that report, hopefully with the A
G, um we will be able to come
out and make a statement about that
soon.
Um We lastly,
I just wanted to talk about teacher retention
and I think this ties into our first part of the
Ozzy Martinez part of our presentation,
we have had a significant
increase in teacher
retention in our school district.
We have devoted a lot of time
effort COVID relief
dollars
again, that are going away,
we're using those heavily to make
sure that we retain staff
and recruit staff and recruit
better teachers. Um We have
a lot of great teachers,
but we always are looking to improve
our, our, our skills
in that area with our
staff, we also devoted
a lot of it to professional development.
But going from a 60%
we have about 700 or so
teachers. We used to lose
almost 300 a year,
um 12 years ago,
11 years ago, 10 years
ago. And we've dropped
that to about 60
as of right now. And
so we, we've, we, we
were really focused in that
area.
We believe that's part of what's paid
off in, in some of our, our proficiency
growth also
going on the Yazzie Martinez slide
as I did last time I gave you
what we thought about what you have
accomplished as far as the
Yazzie Martinez lawsuit and things that could
improve. This isn't all
encompassing. Um
But these are some things that we have
noticed as of late, some
positive things that you have done
in order to resolve that
lawsuit and also
some areas that we would want to talk
about a little about concerns and some of the,
some of the areas that are still needing
to be resolved, increase
in salaries was huge that that
really helped us in our teacher
retention.
Um
And I think that's something that we need to continue
to look at. Obviously, we're worried
about inflation. I think everybody
is in lots of different
areas. But we want to make
sure that we're, we're more competitive
than the surrounding areas that we're
recruiting from. And
when I look at it, it's not the only city,
it's only the city centers in
Colorado, Texas
and Arizona that
might have slightly higher,
um, pay in some
areas. Most of the rural
areas in those states were, were
far, far more competitive
in those areas than, than,
um, we used to
be in
addition to that,
some of the problems that we do face
at times is that we're competing
with city centers that seem
to be able to attract staff
easier. And one of
the concerns we've had as a plaintiff
in the Ozzie Martinez lawsuit is that
there's no rural factor in
funding for teachers or pay
for teachers. And so
I'm competing with Albuquerque with
all the amenities, not that we don't have great
things here, but on average
people like amenities, we don't
have those. And so trying to compete with an
Albuquerque to get teachers to come
here versus go. There is very
challenging. And so we've
always been a promoter of some sort of
factor that takes into consideration
the rural parts of New Mexico be
so we can be competitive.
The at risk factor increases have
been huge for us.
Um They would be better for
us if we actually used accurate
data.
Um The,
the, the the calculations
don't come from state driven
data. They're coming from
outside data.
That is not,
we, we would not consider it reliable
and we see this across the state.
We're seeing fluxes in,
in at risk
students that, that are, that
are, that can be used to claim
for at risk dollars.
Um Even in so southeast parts
of the state, we have to have conversations with
superintendents that are seeing
bad data
driving our at risk
funding. And
so we're welcome to talk more
about that. If need be
transportation, we appreciate
the increase in transportation
dollars. We're not. Uh
we obviously need more of
that across the state. Um
The problem we had with recent
legislation was that you, you
eliminated the density factor
that we never found because we
asked multiple times,
was there any analysis
done to
determine um
the, the needs of those
dollars? And
it, and from what we can see so
far until we see how I guess
money on the ground, it
looks as though that most of
those dollars increase in dollars went to
city centers because of
the removal of that density
factor.
Um iii I know
Rio Rancho was the heaviest
winner of those
dollars um because
of their push and lobbying
and claims that for some
reason they think that their transportation
costs are higher than
rural New Mexico. And I, I'd love
to, I'd love to take
our stu take everybody on a drive
one day on some of the roads and
conditions that our buses go through and
our students have to endure.
Um And the, the maintenance
uh miles.
Uh It was interesting talking to Rio
Rancho about their, their
claim that their, their costs
are, are
significant compared to the
rural. And so we have, we have
obviously have concerns about
that. Native
American language teacher pay has
been an issue.
Um mandatory
$50,000
for minimum pay, which is a good
thing. I I in our
minds and in our, in our, the
way that we practice, we think that was a good
thing to help retain
qualified teachers there
and, and to recruit.
Um but it's not completely
funded. And so it
seems like we were all excited about
that and then the money
behind the that teacher pay
is, is, is,
has, has not been there
to cover the cost.
And I think that's a significant problem
with Yazzie Martinez.
Good thing that more pay. Is
there a bad thing that's
not funded?
Um One of the
things that we have concerns with
that, I don't have a, I don't have a positive
for um
communication regarding funding
has declined. Awards are very
late with the pe d. It's
actually gotten worse over the
years. Uh
We awards are
not coming in timely,
which causes a huge host
of issues uh for school
districts and we can talk about
more that, more about that later on. If you'd
like, we've
invested, we've, we
appreciate the dollars below
the line funding that has come in
for college and career
CTE funding
that we can use for our pathway
work. Um But
it's not consistent, obviously,
it's not in a formula. If
we're gonna truly drive change
with making sure students are prepared
for the workforce, there has to be
consistent dollars that we're not having to
apply for or I think it's
all below the line funding
for, for that. We
got to figure out a way that there's some consistent
funding. Um So that it's
not disproportionately
distributed across the state of New
Mexico, although I understand a lot
of districts are getting started up
in that work. Um But we're a
little further down the road than
most. Um And so we'd
like to see some consistent dollars
coming our way even though we do
receive a significant chunk.
Currently.
Um Dual
language supports for the Ozzie
Martinez lawsuits from
the state that hasn't
happened. We're far,
far away and above the
work that's being or support
is being provided from the state.
We're kind of on our own, which
I'm almost fine with that at this point
because I don't know that anybody else
out there can really support us. We have a lot
of expertise in our school district.
We've been drive really been driving
change with our curriculum and instruction
and pacing to make sure
that we're helping to revitalize
language in our communities, which is a
significant issue
and a significant part of the Indian
Education Act.
Um going off
on that for Indian Education Act
funding. Kind of
going back to my original
point also is that we'd really like
to see, we brought this up two years
ago with this particular
body,
a formula that
determines how
much money a school district
should receive to support the Indian
Education Act. There's, there's nothing
like that. It's all below the line
funding. The
PE D distributes how they
want. And on average
Navajo students get
the short end of the stick every
single year because of
such a large population,
less dollars are going to
Navajo students. And I would
even say Zuni students
to some extent because they have a large population,
lots, big chunks of dollars
are going to other pueblo students
Apache and others and across the
state, there needs to be a formula
for that. Um
Also, I would also
um
actually let's go
on
the extended learning was a
positive thing for us. We,
I don't know where the 189 days
can we do 189
days for our students? We're actually at
190 in
order to receive that funding,
that's a requirement. And
so we've heavily
been been
successful with using
those dollars to help our students. We,
we need, we need to have more time
in the classroom as part of the Ozzie Martinez
lawsuit. I know there's been a
lot of talk about
uh about 180
day rules and things like that and I can
get into that. But for
us, in our community, we need
more, we need more
time with our students and so that
those dollars have been very helpful
and we appreciate those dollars have been
provided. It'd be nice
if those dollars could be to the point where we
just receive them
instead of having to apply for them or,
or jump through some hoops for
them. Um But we understand
some of the parameters that you face in making
sure those dollars are used appropriately.
And lastly, some of the concerns
is technology. We had to
use COVID relief money to support
our technology needs in the in
our district.
And
um those dollars
are gone. We actually
already have to push
the length of a replacement
for technology. The state
is still not provided internet.
There's no funding for technology.
We've had to take that over COVID
relief funds. And so moving forward,
it's going to be very difficult to replace
that technology for our students if we're
gonna have 1
to 1 devices and provide the
technology for the Yazzie Martinez
ruling.
Um
With that, I'm gonna pass
the baton over to Giovanna
Hanks. Um and she's
going to talk about the next few
slides, uh, a little bit more
in your wheelhouse as far as
finances.
>> Thank you. Um, so
on the fiscal status, one of
the large things that of
discussion is the COVID relief
funds we received over $100
million of which we
will spend all
but about $5000.
Um, that was unfortunately
the second round, we had a
last day of the year
refund that we couldn't spend.
Um But other than that,
we did spend 100 and $1
million and we will fully deplete
all of our COVID relief
funds. Um Now, with
that, we did invest
heavily into learning loss
supports through additional
professional development, outreach
efforts to ensure
that our kids were attending school,
social emotional type
supports for our students.
Um I'm sure many
of you have heard post pandemic,
many students were very much
affected by being
isolated during the
pandemic, having so many
deaths during the pandemic.
Um It has been a very,
very rough time and the Kinley
County traditionally has
been um
an area where social
emotional needs have
already been high and we've just
seen that exponentially
um since the pandemic.
Now, I will say due to
the amount of supports that we
put into those academic
and social emotional things during the
pandemic, it's gonna be very
hard for us to determine
how much more state
funding has impacted us versus
COVID funding has impacted
us. And so that's something
long term that we're looking at as
far as outputs and outcomes.
Um Additionally, the
district essentially went to a 1
to 1 device
district overnight during the
pandemic. Um And
so we are now
trying to determine how we're
going to keep that strategic
plan up um with
a replacement cycle of that
technology without a dedicated
funding source.
Um Additionally, we
did put some funds into capital
outlay to help us. Um As
Superintendent Hyatt was mentioning
that we are less dire,
some of the things that we did do
for our schools that were struggling
with a V AC needs that
definitely didn't have MV 13
capacity um that
were not putting out the quality of
air that was being demanded during the
pandemic and probably post
pandemic as we continue
to see infections and different
things that cycle through the schools.
Um So we did invest in
some HV AC replacements
with our capital outlay.
Um As mentioned by
superintendent, we have been able to
implement the tier one
of the K 12 plus.
Um The district was able
to negotiate finally with our
union. Um We do have
some new union representation
in the district um
As far as leadership
and so they have been amenable
for us to be able to do
the, the K 12
plus. And as superintendent
mentioned that has been a plus
um award letters and
fiscal information. So my budget
was actually due to pe D
today, I got my
final state 9 10
5
yesterday.
I do not have any
award for transportation.
I have no award for special
education funding.
Um I I
will just do what I can through
the end of the year to make sure that that gets
into place. Um
to say that we are struggling,
we are struggling. It's a
problem.
Um
It, it has been a very
interesting week for me. My,
my boss has uh thankfully
been very kind to me
because I was very nervous.
Um making sure that everything was
in today because I did get
my final information yesterday
at 830 for my
state funding.
Um So planning
and foresight is very
hard. One
of the things we talk about is that
out at risk calculation.
So at risk actually
does local
information for mobility in
Ell and that includes
the district in all state
charters. We of course don't
have information for state charters.
So there's no real way
for us to monitor
that those items.
The other piece which is the
poverty piece comes from the federal
title one data that
is based upon the de centennial
census. And then each year the
American Community survey
that's put out and the American
Community Survey only reaches
about 260
houses per 100,000
people, I believe. And so
you'll notice that at risk number
does this all the time.
And so our ask and has
been our ask for an extended period
of time is that we keep
all calculations in
house meaning
in the state of New Mexico for
data. And so I guess I would
ask the committee at this time to
please reconsider that
ask because
it is such a large multiplier
within the formula.
It really can swing
things significantly
>> if I could add really quickly. And
I to it is that
the public education
department as it
has stated in
their documents and, and
publicly that Native American students
should be counted into at risk
funding and that's not currently being done
either. So
>> yes, as superintendent
mentioned, they are a category
labeled at risk, but there
is not a dedicated
funding source or data put into
the at risk funding formula for
that category of students.
Um
along with awards and
delays, uh initial awards
carryover awards, we don't
have carryover awards for several
funds currently for the year.
So we don't know what our final award
is in multiple different
funding sources.
Um And so what, what that
has created is, is planning
and implementation of programs has
continued to be challenging.
Um I'm very transparent
about that. I'm very open about that. I
communicate about that a lot.
Um And so,
uh a lot of that was reflected
in the recent consolidated
performance review that was published
by the federal government for
PE D recently. Um
that they're, they're also
seeing that as far as identifying
awards and making sure that awards are put
out um
accurately. I, I
always say I can't make a better
widget, I can't
promote a better product. All
that I can do is spend the
money that you give us in the
most effective way.
But I can't do that
if I don't actually know what my
resources are. And
so that becomes a complicating
factor. And it often, in
order for programs to be effective,
it becomes a shell game and
a request for
if I can
obligate other funds
in advance of receiving an award.
For example, if we're
going to get something to
support,
we received the parody last
year of $50,000. We've
already been notified for our native
American teachers. We've
already been notified. It's only going to be
$25,000 this coming
year, but we didn't receive
that award until almost
December and those
teachers started in August.
We already have those teachers
recruited. And so
even though I don't have the money, I have to
figure out a way to pay for them in
advance to be sure that I
can get the staff when I need
the staff. And so that is
the struggle that school districts kind
of face consistently
is how do we implement a program
timely to actually make a significant
difference in the current year.
Um The
program guarantee changes
based upon my 910 B
five, I will get about $4
million increase this year to
implement the 3%
raises, um,
the approximately 15%
increase in health insurance,
31% increase
in liability insurance.
And then I know there's some other things
that are in there too, like some innovation,
money and, and things
that were in the unit value.
It's very hard for us to discern
how when we're not
losing students,
our student demographics didn't
change significantly
why we're not seeing
a, a real difference in our
funding.
Um And
so the at risk, the first
one that we received, we were
at a multiplier of
0.282.
I I told them there's no
way. That's right. Um
Because it was such a significant
swing, um They did come
back and revise it to
0.309.
Um And so again,
we don't do a statewide
formula. So it's very hard for us
to discern what swung so
heavily in that change.
Um
The TC and T
and so we've moved away. So we now
have a teacher cost index and
so that's reduced units
are being distributed. But that also
means that we're no longer receiving that
additional support for ancillary
providers, um
counselors, social
workers, people of
that nature, and that was a strategic
change in the formula that actually
reduced funding to schools.
Um The movement of the at
risk index and the funding
formula where the multiplayer
actually starts multiplying
against base units has also
decreased units.
Um and
then embedding allocations
for textbooks and other initiatives
without indices. So
we were told that our textbook
allocation was approximately $2
million this year. But nobody
can tell us where
that came from. Pe D is
just telling us that's what it
is. There's no
index, there's no calculation
that I can do to answer
that question and I've asked,
but it's, it's very hard
to understand.
So it's hard to plan
and calculate for things. And you
will notice that I am very much a planner
and calculator because I want to know
what our resources are.
And then of course, the medical insurance
increases in liability and I
I believe there was about a
6.5% estimate
in the budget this year and
our reality was about 15
on medical and 31
for liability
cash balance. I know cash
balance is a huge discussion. So
we're moving on to page five.
So I did take the last
year that is under the LFC
label FY 25 and
I actually went and disaggregated
it by fund.
And so this is the
cash balance of $186
million. We did have an
extraordinarily high
cash balance and operational.
This is receiving two years
of impact aid in one year.
The federal government distributes
as they wish. And as we all know,
this year, the feds could not decide
on a budget to save their
lives. And so
impact aid being a current year
funding. They didn't
actually have a federal budget
until around
February March. And so that's
when impact aid started coming
out. And so impact
aid is delayed based upon the
federal budget. And then when that
is all disseminated, in
addition to that, we had received
$24 million from a
prior request
from 2020
when the state had been
found to not have
met its federal
requirement.
And so we had an extraordinarily
high cash balance which
actually worked out in our favor because
our loans from PE D at June
30th 2023 were
$30 million
in funding that we were due back
in reimbursements from the
state. So
of that 50 million
$30 million was loans.
And if we wouldn't have had that, our
entire bank account would have been negative.
So it was fortuitous
that we had those
funds or we would
not have made it. In
addition to that payroll
liabilities are often not shown
in the cash balance. The state
tends to operate public
schools on a cash basis.
But the reality is is that we
really operate on an accrual
basis because we will always have
subsequent liabilities that are
due including
payroll carryover, purchase
orders. Again, having
invested in things like capital
outlay, those projects are
not going to happen within one year.
They are going to be carryover obligations
year to year. And then we do
also pay a portion of our operational
funds to the money we borrowed
to build teachers, we
borrowed revenue bonds to build.
So part of our operational is
obligated to that. So
when we reconcile the
operational funds, it's about
$5.3 million
for that year. Um
It's going to be lower, our
loans are going to be lower.
Um We finally got a,
got kind of caught up with
COVID payments around
December of
23.
And so I anticipate
our loans this year to be 8
to $13 million
from pe D at the end of the
year. Um And
just kind of quickly moving through
our 12,000 is
our teacher deposit So
even though there's money there, I can't
spend any of that. Somebody
moves out. I give them their deposit
back or I retain their deposit
as landlords do
the 15
100 which is formerly
the state credit and
now is housed in HB
six that is
obligated to construction
projects for the majority.
So we did have a substantial
carryforward purchase order on
that. The
51 200 had some
smaller maintenance and construction
projects in it.
The 21,000 is our food
service fund and we have been building
up capacity because we are gonna
need some larger equipment.
Um replacement of
wholesale freezers,
things of that nature that are going to
be quite costly.
Um student activity funds. I
highlighted that in blue, we don't
touch that money. Gas B 84
required us to teach,
read to use it as a fund.
Now, not as a separate
activity. And so
it shows up in our financials, but
really those are kids funds. We would
never touch those funds.
Um Also a portion of that is
transportation for student activity
funding. Uh
25145 is
idea B Impact
A. So this is for special
education students,
25147
is Impact Aid. Set aside
both of those programs have
FTEs in them. And so we are
very cautious due to the
nature of impact aid
and the fact that we don't know
exactly when we're going to get the
funding. We are very
cautious to keep those
solid so that we don't ever
have to impact staff.
Um Medicaid reimbursements,
um that has largely been
dedicated. We had been saving up
for a project there.
Um 31
131 200.
Those are both bond
bond geo bonds
and revenue bonds.
31 200 we got
forward funded for both
the outside of Adequacy and the SB
212, we got $11
million.02 12
and about $9 million in outside
of Adequacy. All that money
will be gone by about June 30th
this year. Um
Impact aid. We tend to keep
the impact aid capital for
design only because Davis
Bacon is attached to that in order
to maximize the funding,
we use it for design to
not escalate the cost.
Um We do have a two
mil levy and a two mil state
match which is now forward
funded. So you'll see those reconciled
balances after the
purchase orders.
And then of course, our debt
service funds which are for
the repayment of our general obligation
bonds and revenue bonds.
And so I hope this helps
you to understand a little bit more
about the cash balance that we
have. I
wish that I was able to
present to you on an accrual
basis more regularly.
Unfortunately, the state
doesn't allow us to put in any of
that into their financial system.
They will not look at
any anything
other than
cash
expenditures and revenue if
there are no liabilities in the state
reporting system. So they do
not understand it any
time
where, where we actually
sit financially. So that
is a struggle for me and I did
just put an excerpt from the recent
capital outlay, um
quarterly newsletter.
So similar to the
state with $4.5
billion in reserves
that are obligated to projects.
We also have cash balances
obligated to projects. We
just don't often get to tell
you about those things.
>> And I think it's just a
long story short is
sometimes we've heard it from this committee
over the years, not all
the committee members, but
some that
the large cash balances
are some alluding to there, some sort of
a slush fund or hoarding
dollars. And that's why we went
really specifically through this to show
that's not the case, there's liabilities
that we have to cover and a host of
things that
sometimes get STN in our face
as if we're hoarding
or creating slush
funds for ourselves. And
there may be some districts out there that are
charters that are, I don't know,
but I want, we want to
be very clear about what our
cash balance is for and
why it is the way it is. And
again, when we look at
the cash balance of the State of New
Mexico, it's very
significant and you have reasons
for that,
which are probably legitimate,
but it's awfully a lot bigger
than ours. So I hope,
I hope, I hope you have good, good use
for that.
>> Um,
impact aid and capital outlay.
Um, as superintendent mentioned,
impact aid has helped us be
less dire.
Unfortunately, the cost of
construction, as I'm sure you have
heard again and again and again
is exploding.
Um I'm hoping we've
seen the peak and we're gonna see the
other side, but there's really no way
to predict it with the
build back um funding
coming from the federal government. And
really that competition
um among people who
have federal dollars to
spend COVID
also created federal
additional federal dollars to
spend. And so we've
seen that additional, as
was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, we
do have 10 projects that are
either awarded
or eligible for full
replacement in the
cycle. And that
speaks, we have 32 schools
and we have 10 that are eligible
for full replacement.
That, that, that tells you
how dire our
need is. Um
And in doing
our current Fiveyear Facility
Master Plan, we are
at $282 million
in deficit right
now.
Um Again,
we've seen severe escalation of
construction costs.
Um
pscocps,
we continue to see
communication
timelines.
We, we
have to use all of the forms.
And what's interesting to me is this
council was formed before
every school was required to
have a Chief fa
chief Procurement Officer.
And so we have to use all of their
templates for things and so often
what we'll do is we'll get the template, fill
it out, send it back and we're
notified, the form is changed.
And so we have to fill out the new form,
we fill out the new form, send it back,
the form is changed, we fill out the
new form, we send it back, the form
is changed and we do this
time and time and time
and time again and
it causes so many
delays and frustrations.
I will also say that when
I ask questions, for example,
in our area, we often ask
for an exception for gems.
We're very rural. Our communities
don't have a lot of amenities
like other entities
do. And so we ask for a little
bit more space because we want
our parents to come, we want them to
come to science academic nights.
We want them to come to games,
we want to get them into
our schools. But if we build
very small gyms that
really alienates the communities
that we serve. And they said, well, there
is a process that you can get
a waiver for that. And I said, ok,
well, what's the process? Why don't
know, you just kind of write a letter and ask
the council and maybe they'll
approve it. And I'm
like,
what, you
know, like II I need to
process, I need to understand the
rules so I can follow the
rules. Um
And then impact aid again, one
of the few current year
funded budgets federally.
Um It is at high
risk for only receiving partial
payments or no payments at all
within a year. Um So we are
very cognizant of that and that's
reflected in our cash funding
policies. Um
Also due to the increase
decreasing number of eligible students,
we're seeing this everywhere where students
are migrating from rural areas
into city centers, there's
less eligible students
so that funding will continue
to decrease over
time.
Thank you. That's our
presentation. >> Thank
you, madam superintendent. You're
next.
Good morning
everyone.
And thank you, Mr
Chair Munoz,
Director Sally, thank you
for allowing us to be here. Members
of the committee. I
am going to focus
basically on the
academic side and, and let
me tell you why we we don't
have school board members here today. We
may have some who are listening
in but four out of the
five are actually at our
elementary school
judging fifth grade
portfolios. We try to
get them in the schools as
much as we can. So that's where they
are today. Um
In addition, Mr
Roine is here with me. So we're small
in number, just the two of us,
but everyone else
is at
any public
schools.
My focus is going to be
on the academic end
of it. Uh Thank you for
the report, Mr Lieu.
We are concerned about
our student
performance and
basically what have we been doing
to improve that?
What we have done is our
primary focus for
the last two years
has been on the elementary
and then it into the middle school
next year, it will be the high school
specifically,
some of the strategies that we are
using that the district is not
used before. Yes, we
use the state mandated tests
belong with that rather
than just teacher made
tests. We have our own
curriculum based
measures that
basically every three
weeks,
they take a chunk of instruction
and those students are tested on
that and those
specific measures
they're not designed by the teacher,
they're designed by our director,
director of curriculum and
instruction and
the instructional coaches that work
with him just
to make sure that
we know what is going on in
the classroom is the instruction
that's going on
working.
In addition, what have we done
in, in the last three
years? We've gone from
two instructional coaches
working at the school
sites to five.
We feel like that has significantly
improved the instruction
and the assistance that our teachers
are getting in the classroom.
We,
this past
year
employed additional
interventionists in the areas
of reading and math,
specifically two at the
elementary two at the middle
school and one math
interventionist at the high
school. Again, we're
focusing on what's going
on in the
classroom.
Another strategy that we're
utilizing, we've been doing this now
for two years is called
OFCC.
And it's observation and
feedback, coaching
cycles.
We train intensively,
train our principals and our
instructional coaches on
how to go into the classrooms
and make sure again that we
have the appropriate instruction going
on because what we
found with, with
Yazzie Martinez that
specifically affects
our school district is not
that we weren't spending our
monies on our Native American
students. We're 99%
Native American. So that's where
the money goes. But where
we felt like we
were falling short
is
the rigor in the instruction.
And how do you improve that?
You have to do
professional development
for your instructional
staff. That is intentional,
not just something that makes
them feel good that day, but
something that they can take and
use in the classroom. And so
that's been our
focus
in addition, in terms of
rental engagements. Um
Thank you, Mr Hyatt
for utilizing
something that you had at
Zuni. We've actually taken
it one step further on
our student, our
conferences, we no
longer do call them even
parent conferences, we call
them student at led
conferences. We
felt like our students didn't,
sometimes, didn't understand
how they got the grade they got
or where were they,
what, what assignments needed
to be done. So we now
have exclusively
even in the elementary
school beginning and
kinder
student led conferences.
The student explains
to the parents
and the teacher, this is
my grade. This is
how I got that grade.
And we feel like that's
been
very useful,
not only in that they do
understand now and, and now the parent
understands why maybe they didn't
have the, the grade they thought
they would have. But in
addition to that, it puts those
students up
speaking because
what we found is
some of our students, by the time
they got to high school
had never had that experience
before. So
in addition to that at the
elementary and
middle school, we started
what we, it's known as
a P TT,
it's academic parent teacher
teams where
once, usually once
a quarter at those
school sites, they invite
in the parents,
the grade level
teachers will invite
them in and actually show them
all right. This is what we're doing in the
classroom. Uh and
they'll even teach a mini
lesson to the parents. So
they'll get an idea of what goes
on in addition to
that because we know
sometimes parents
don't have childcare in the
evening, we provide
the childcare for those
parents. So
we've, especially at
the elementary, we
have found that that has been
extremely beneficial and
has brought in a lot of parents
to the schools
because quite
frankly,
we had parents who
during the pandemic and
I am, I, I'm kind of like
superintendent Hyatt. I hate that
word anymore because
II, I think we rely
and use it as an excuse.
But during the pandemic,
we saw a lot
of parents obviously who couldn't come
into the schools
once they could come back
in, we had a hard time getting them
back in. And so we
have focused dramatically on
that
with reference to attendance.
And for us specifically,
we're concerned about our chronic
absenteeism.
We've had a attendance
incentives each
year. We basically,
each year, I'm sorry, each month
we have put each
school site in competition with
each other and
we award
to students
who like it may be
something like a pizza party
or whatever, but they kind of like
things like that. If their
school site is one that
wins and specifically
their grade level, then
they get some incentive.
In addition to that.
If we have someone who has perfect
attendance that month, their
names are put in a drawing for
things like ipads. I
mean, you
hate to say, you, you almost feel like
you're bribing the kids to
get there. But right now we want them in
the classroom because
obviously we can't
improve our academic
performance if they're
staying home.
So we do what we can to
get them there
graduation rates.
We're proud of what we
have, but we know
there's room for improvement
specifically for us. We have
two high schools,
Zinny High, their
graduation rate
can be appro improved
obviously. But at the same time,
it's about the state where
we are, we have an extreme
concern is with our
second twin views
Cyber Academy
because most of the students
who are there
are in there because
they've gotten behind at uni
high or
they've had a family circumstance
where they stayed home for a year
or two.
So it's very difficult for
them
to fall within that four
years to graduate.
So we know we still need
to do something to help improve
that graduation rate as
well. We've
spent a
lot of our money on
after school programs,
summer school
and we want the students
there as much as possible even if
it means summer
school.
Ultimately, we
want to move those
performance rates
up
and we've
seen some progress, but
we know we've got a long way to go
to, I'm actually gonna
turn it over to Mr Roma
now and he is going
to focus on the money
side of
it.
>> Good morning, everyone. I appreciate
you inviting us to make a
presentation to you this morning.
Back in 2019
gall mckinley County Schools Central
Consolidated Schools and Zuni
public schools began
to push to,
uh and the credit
the state took for impact
aid. Along the
way, we have received a lot of
money. So rather than just talk about
money to start, I just like to show some pretty
pictures. So you all have
a presentation this
morning with some
pictures. I just like to show you what
we've done with some of the money that,
that we have received
from the state over the last
few years and some that we've received
from the federal government.
In 2019, we
received two awards,
two capital awards from the state.
One was
$10 million was split
between the three
schools, Central Gallup
and Zuni. A one of
$25 million that was
split amongst a number of
impact aid schools.
The teacher's money was to help
us pay down teachers debt.
The amount we received did not
pay the entire debt down,
but it did allow us to pay
our debt off early, which saved us
a half million dollars in interest
costs. So the first slide
is just a picture of one of our
teachers. I
will let you know
that at the end,
I will talk about a construction
project on June
Tel 10th. We are 12th.
We will be making a
presentation to PS
COC for funding
to add an additional 18
units.
Next slide, we
received
an award
to,
uh, be
devoted to our football,
our baseball and softball fields. We,
with that award that was part of
the $25 million.
We were able to turf our baseball
field
and we were able to
build a softball field
prior to that, any softball
or baseball games that our students
participated in, they had to
come to Gallup and use those fields.
They practiced on an open dirt
field that
was probably more
dangerous than, than
anything.
But uh these were out of
Adequacy Awards and we
spent over
2 million $2.3
million on the construction of
those two, those two fills.
Then with the COVID money that we
got,
we tried to be innovative on
this.
We,
this was during the pandemic,
obviously and there was
a large push by,
by federal
entities and, and even the
state legislature to
build outdoor spaces where the students
could learn. So we took
some of our or three
money and we built
outdoor learning spaces at the
elementary school and at the middle
school. And
you'll see this. The first one is a
slide at the elementary school
as well as the next
one. And they
are just covered spaces
with, with uh benches
where the students can sit, they have a
podium, they do
have uh
hots, they do have access to
internet out there. The teachers will
have a have access
to uh sound
systems, they can get their kids
out of the classroom and get them in
here and the kids have been using them and
really enjoying them.
Then we have a slide
of Zuni middle school
of their outdoor learning space.
And this one actually shows these
students out there
during the
late winter, early spring, we
had a lot of rain and a lot of
snow and we have
water retention areas being
built in here. So the science
teachers were taking their kids out
there to take water
samples to see what
kind of microorganisms were growing
in there. So not
only does it give a, give them a
spot to go out there out
and learn, it also gives them
uh
physical specimens that
they can test to
learn.
Also with the
the or money we were able
to replace the
HB A system
on the central office.
Twin viewed Cyber Academy
building along with
that, we used some of our impact aid
money to replace the roof
because the
replacement of all those
units was
uh required that the
roof be
replaced.
Also,
we used impact aid money in the
next three slidess are just pictures of our
parking lot. There's a parking
lot that was over 30 years
old and walking through
the parking lot was like walking
through gravel. It was, it was
in horrible shape. So we
took some of our impact aid money
and renovated
the parking lot. It was interesting
doing that. We used
Sunland uh
Sunland Asphalt
Company and they brought
in a big milling
machine
and as they went through
milling that they hit a
soft spot in the ground
because apparently there
was an underground river or
something that ran through there.
They buried their milling machine.
They had to bring
22
of the large records out of grants
to be able to pull that out of there. So
it's a good story that we get to share
with people. Finally,
the, the,
the next slide shows a
maintenance shop that we built with impact
a funds. Our district
was created in 1980.
When the district was created,
they took an outdoor
restroom,
removed all the walls
and just created. It's just an old
adobe building. They created that as
their maintenance shop and
they worked out of that shop for 43
years. It was not
made as a, it was meant as
a restroom, not as a maintenance
shop. So when we got our
impact aid money back, the first
project that we wanted to
complete was the
construction of a maintenance shop
for our staff so they
could properly maintain our
buildings. Uh We
hired Decker Parish
Soini to design
it. They
came and had meetings. I just, I
said you meet with the maintenance
staff, let them tell you what they want
in this building and
they designed the building as
they wanted. And
they've got offices in there, a big work
area room for storing
tools and different things.
They love the building.
And I think above everything
else, our maintenance staff
understands that we
value the work that they
do. It was,
it was, it was very expensive,
but it was money. Well
spent the
final
slide
back in. I want to say it was
2018.
We had received
the PS
A uh ratings
for all the schools that showed which
ones were eligible to be
renovated or replaced.
And Zuni middle school was on that
list. And so we submitted
a request to replace the
school. PS A
had a new director at that time, Mr
Chamberlain, he wanted to
come and look at the school and see if it was
really in dire need
of being replaced. He came out
and looked at it.
We visited with him
and went to a PSCOC
Award sub-committee meeting
and our superintendent
just out of the blue. And I don't know
why he said, he said, well, what if we just
replaced both high
schools and the middle school
and put them under one roof?
Because obviously it's cheaper
and easier to maintain one building
than it is three old buildings.
They were very uh receptive
to the idea.
We did an assessment of the high
school and determined that uh
one C ID inspector
wondered why we even had
students in that building.
Still, we did get
an award to to replace
all three buildings, bring them into
one location.
And the final slide is just
a, a slide
to show that the construction has
begun. One
thing I will say about
the construction,
it is a consist, it consists
of three projects,
the the school building,
replacement, additional
teachers units
and a new football
field. The
one thing that I I need to make
sure everybody in this on this
committee understands is
when you build a new school, you
are allowed state will
pay for the construction of
one athletic field.
One athletic field on
a football field means
everything from the outside of
the track to
the middle of the field is what the state
pays for. They do
not pay for lighting, they
do not pay for scoreboards. They
don't pay, pay for bleachers,
they don't pay for any of your
track event or your field events.
They are outside the
track.
And I I hope you're all aware of
how construction
costs have escalated in the last
few years.
The cost of that football field
complex is going to be
$15 million.
The state's going to pay 7.5
million of it. If we
had not received our impact aid
back money back, there would be
no chance that we would ever
be able to build that
field. I
say that because
while it sounds wonderful that
the state pays for the
field, school
districts need to understand that they are
only paying about half the cost
of of one of those
complexes.
The the school is going to be on
the hook for the rest of it.
But I just wanted to share those with
you so that you, uh, understand
what we have done with the money
that we've gotten from the legislature over the
last five years. We
appreciate, we appreciate
what we've gotten and, and we've tried
to put it to good use
and we had our ground
break groundbreaking yesterday
for our new school and football
field and teachers
And we're excited to get that project
off the uh off the ground.
It should be completed sometime
in early 2027.
So I'd like to just talk for a few
minutes about some of
the things that,
that uh Mike and Giovanna had
mentioned
over the summer, I had the privilege
of sitting and being a part of
the Les CS CG
study committee
and we went through, we
went through the SEG
formula from top to
bottom.
Uh We Sonny was,
was the representative
uh from
LFC there. And as I
said, we, we leave a lot of the,
the important decisions to the smart
people. He's the smartest man in the
room as far as I was
concerned. But we
talked about the things that
uh the state funds and the things that
it doesn't fund. And I'd like to talk
about Yazzie Martinez for a
minute because I know that's an
albatross around the neck of the,
of the state at this time.
And one thing that we talked about in
regards to Yazzie Martinez
as mentioned before was the at
risk index.
And Yazzie Martinez
at risk encompasses
bilingual students,
students with special
needs, low
income students and native
American students.
The seg has a
component for bilingual.
They have a component for special
ed in the at
risk index. They have low
income but
nowhere in the
seg is there
a component for Native
Americans?
And I firmly believe and I said
this during our, our committee's
hearings last summer
that until New
Mexico
incorporates a
Native American component
into the seg.
I don't think we will ever get out
from underneath Yazzie
Martinez.
In the 2022
legislative session,
Representative Lente presented,
sponsored a bill
to increase the salaries of
Native American language
and culture teachers.
If you go to the Indian Education
Act, you will see that
maintenance of those
languages is their
number two
priority.
When that bill was
presented in the House Education
Committee of the 40
people. And this is in
in the interest of total transparency
in the the uh when that bill
was presented in House
Education, there were
approximately 40 comments
online of
those 40 comments. I
was the only one that was opposed to
the bill, not
because I was opposed
to, to
making sure Native American
languages and culture were taught in
the schools and maintained.
I did not like the way the bill was
originally written because it only
it was paying for language
licenses, not teaching
the class. And
the other thing was
the appropriation was
a one time appropriation through
house bill two of $1.5
million. And
by my calculation, the
cost to the state would be in
excess of $5 million
dollars. The
bill was passed,
it was signed by the
governor.
We received the first
year full funding.
They found, I don't know where they found the
additional money but additional money
was found. And
the, the the
funding for those teachers was was
100%
this year. I
don't know how it is statewide
but for Suny public schools,
our funding is about 25
about 75%.
As Giovanna mentioned
for next year,
the funding from the
Indian Education Department
is $25,000
per position. That
is barely the cost.
The minimum cost for an
educational assistant
which most of the people that,
that teach these classes
hold is the license which
they hold
our cost next
year for this program. And
let me back up in a minute
when this bill was passed,
Zuni being 99%
Zuni. We decided we would go all
in. We just buy in
100% of the program
before the bill was passed.
We had full time
teachers at the middle school and the high
schools we
decided what we were going to
do is
open
the position up at the elementary
school to any 520
language license holders
that wanted to become full-time
Zuni language
teachers
and we had a number of them
apply. We we now have
full-time Zuni language
teachers from
kindergarten through 12th
grade, from K
eight. It is mandatory
onehour instruction every
day for
nine through 12. It's an
elective class.
So as a result, our
cost for next year for the Zuni
language license holders, these
Zuni language teachers
is going to be
$800,000
of that $800,000.
We are going to receive
$225,000
to pay for it.
So when we talk about
districts and
their cash
balances, we keep
cash balances on hand
because at
times the
legi legislation is
passed and there are unintended
consequences when those
unintended unintended
consequences have
dollars attached to them. We've
got to have a way to fund them. We
will fund this out of our
cash balance.
I know that the L DS
C in the interim is
going to be
looking at
rere revising
the seg and its
components. And
I have asked if I could continue to,
to be part of that discussion and
I was assured I was or
that I would be
uh received an email
from Mr Daniel Estupinan,
who is one
of those that put
together all the presentations for the
summer.
And he asked
the new Mexico Association of School
Boards Organization,
if he could lean on
us for suggestions
and we will be hopefully
heavily involved
and my suggestion
and I have not talked to a single
other business
manager about this.
But as we visited last summer,
about how to
incorporate a Native
American component
into the SCG,
we discussed at risk
and how difficult
the at risk formula was to
create. And there was
concern about how
do we, how do we put
that component in in the at risk
formula?
The native American culture,
language and culture teacher is a
whole different position.
It would be easy to
identify that cost. It
would be easy to put that
cost into the SCG.
Take it out of the hands of the Indian
Education Committee
and Indian Education
appropriations from the
legislature just make
it part of the SCG and be
done with it.
Like I say, I haven't talked to anybody,
any other business officials from
Native American districts about
that proposal. But it would be
one that would be easily,
easily incorporated into the
seg
uh like
to talk a minute
about
it's student access to the
internet.
Most school districts,
I believe probably all school districts
in the new state of New Mexico
receive E rate
funds. It's a
fund that offsets
the cost of of internet
access for
schools
every year. School districts
that want access to e
erate dollars have to publish a
request for proposal
offering to different internet
providers. The opportunity to
sell their services to the school
district for
years and years.
Centurytel
centurylink provided that
service to, to Zuni public school
district and the
service was not very
good. They made promises about
increasing the speed but they would never
purchase the equipment that
allowed that speed to be
increased. So
about seven
years ago,
Red Bolt, which is a
subsidiary of Continental Dubai.
The local Electric
co-operative in the area
proposed
to
service to provide the
service to Zuni public school
district. Their
cost was very expensive
because they would have to run
the line
from
is between grants
and Rayma to Zuni.
It's about 35 miles, I
believe of the line that they had to run
and it would take them a year to do
that. So we contacted
the erate people and they, they
were agreeable to let us accept
that proposal.
Before we accepted that proposal,
we made one request of them.
And that was that if they came
to the schools that
they would then extend
the line to everyone
in the community.
They got the line extended to the school
district. In the meantime,
they received a grant of $4.5
million with that $4.5
million. They have extended
internet access to every
house in Zuni
that wanted it. The nice
thing is and I don't know where this money
came from, but
everybody in Zuni that has
signed up to Red for Red
Bolt now
has service
free service
completely paid for
for three years.
The district has pur purchased
1 to 1 devices for the students
that can they take, take them
home every day.
Their homes have internet
service. So that
obstacle for
education in
Zuni has been removed.
What happens after three years?
I don't know with, with the
cost, Red Bolt's costs
are a lot, a lot lower than
Century centurylink
was. So
we're excited about that.
Uh
We were
not able to use all of our COVID
relief money
like like uh Gallet
mckinley County schools was,
but we did use a lot of it for
those 1 to 1 devices.
We will be issuing
new ones at the beginning of next
school year.
Uh What other
one of the issue? I think,
I, I think it's an unintended
consequence
in the 2023
legislative session when
the legislature passed
the bill to
increase
minimum school
instructional hours
to
1140.
There was a component of
that that allows school
districts to count
professional development
hours
up to certain limits
as instructional
hours.
Those instructional hour
limits for professional development
were 60 hours at elementary
schools and 30 hours
at secondary schools.
I don't know if all districts are like
Zuni, but I imagine most, if not
all of them are that the
professional development
offered is
ours are pretty much the same
whether it's an elementary school or
a secondary school.
So we planned our
professional development
around the 60 hour
limit that of the
elementary schools
and the secondary schools
and teachers were at those,
at those development
days. So basically
what we had was 30
hours of
pay to the
secondary staff
with no funding.
And I would hope that the legislature
would look at that in, in the coming
year. Just
if you want to make it 30 hours,
make it 30 hours for everybody.
If you want to make it 60 hours, make it
60 hours for everybody.
So there's not a discrepancy
and, and a gap that,
that the school districts have
to fill without any
money, any payment from the
state to, to fill that
gap.
And
I think that is all I have this
morning again. We appreciate you
letting, letting us come and visit with
you.
Uh
Hi along with, I'm sure gallop. If you
have any questions, we'd,
we'd happy to answer them if we
could.
>> Ok. We'll go to questions
from committee members,
Representative Sarana,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman.
Um Thank you for your presentation.
Um And
I, I hear you on so much of
what you're saying, but I focused
in, I was a math teacher for 20
years, um middle school and high
school. I focused on
the math proficiency.
Um
So what is the class
size teacher in most of your
classes? The class
teacher ratio
>> for, for us,
Mr chair
representative.
It varies because we
have schools that are like
micro districts where you
have maybe low student to
teacher ratios and
we have large high schools, like
other large high school student med school, there's
higher student to
teacher ratio. >> Do you have a
number kind of average?
Maybe
>> in a, in a, in a pub public
school there maximize 100
and 60 students
to one teacher.
Um, in a smaller school,
it's, you could have some, some
classrooms where there's 10 to
1
>> 160 to
>> do, I mean 100 and 60
students per year or
per for, for
one teacher, you can only do so
many teachers as far as for the state
regulation.
And
so
no,
what?
There we go.
Um So there's,
there's a lot of, there's a lot of factors in
that as far as the size of the
school. So larger schools,
larger schools are gonna have a larger school
size. So you could have 30 plus
per teacher in a class
or 100 and 60 in a school
day. Um
or you could be in a small school. We
have some schools that have 60
students. Um And so you
have to have a certain number of teachers in
order to, to staff that.
And so their, their ratios are, they're not
gonna have more than 60 students per
day in their
classrooms
>> at the secondary level
in our math and el a
classes, most of them are
15 students
per class period
for and at the
elementary and middle
school, elementary
prob our average
class size at
the
primary grades
again, 12 to 15
per teacher. When
you get to middle school, it's
more again,
probably 1518
max.
So,
>> so
I turned it off. Ok.
Sorry. Um,
um,
I forgot what I was gonna say.
Um,
extended learning, how much is
focused on extended learning for
math of
your time. Do you have any
specific math? I'm just
concerned about you. Have,
you have maybe
10% in
Zuni, maybe 15%
proficiency in math
and, and um
in, at MC
gallop, you have maybe
20% proficient,
but when you look at
graduation,
75% and
maybe 80% that
doesn't make sense if they're not learning
math and,
and they're that low. How
are they graduate? How are they
passing classes when
they maybe have 10%
proficiency in math?
How is that working >> Mr Chair
Representative? I think there are several factors
there. It's not just a 1 to
1 correlation.
Um But number
one is especially in, in
impoverished communities. This
is not unique to our area
or any area. Uh students
on average come in to the
public schools at a very
low um
skill level or proficiency
level. And so right
off the bat in, in our
communities and a lot of parts of new,
lots of parts of New Mexico and the
country is you're
already, you're already in, in
the negative trying to catch a
student up. And so when you're
talking about the importance of
getting them to be able to read
by the third grade
math is obviously
an issue that we're very focused on in
trying to improve, especially at the elementary
level. So we don't have
issues later on in, in the
school, but it's very difficult. We have two
years behind
when the student starts.
So that's a, that's a challenge. I'm not saying it's
not, it can't be overcome
but to, to
make up in the first year, two
years of learning loss or
learning. That wasn't, that
wasn't a part of the
student.
You were a math teacher. I was a math teacher
for middle school and high school too. In
order to catch, you can only catch so
much per year. So
if you add up that time that you
have students, uh
K through 12,
there's not a lot of time then let's throw
in two years where they weren't in school.
And so it, it creates a huge
challenge and, and I don't disagree
with you. The the
difference is, is that what do you
do? The, the
statistics show if a student
is behind a grade level and
you hold them back a
year
that you, there's,
there's some opportunity there
to be successful with the student.
But when you hold them back two years,
they're extremely highly to
drop out of school. And
so then you're faced with another challenge,
right? Um
Is that you, then you have, you
lose the student or eventually
lose a student or, and then usually up
until that particular point, there's other problems
that are associated with students
being in, in classrooms. And
so the traditional system
of education isn't super
beneficial, in my
opinion. Um This
westernized way of
learning
doesn't work really well
unless you have students on grade
level when they enter the
system and then you
don't take them and put them in virtual
school for two years or all of them,
at least in virtual school.
Um But that, that's
part of the problem. I think also
we've been really focused on
elementary is on
average elementary
teachers. There's a lot of
emphasis, especially in colleges
to help them learn how to teach
students to read.
There's not a lot of emphasis
in training for teachers and teaching
them how to teach math
and we've seen it, I've seen
it my whole career. We're on
average, a
lot of elementary teachers, it's
not their cup of tea per
se, even though they know it's important and
they're trying, but
they may have some struggles at times.
They, they're, they're more accustomed to being able
to teach reading because of their, their
experience and their training. And
so I think those are a few things I'm
sure, um, super stick
that maybe have some others.
Stick.
Me.
>> The state had emphasized
reading scores and we're still not
completely happy with those. I'll
be honest with you, but the focus
had been on that.
Um
to be brutally honest,
I, I think sometimes,
and this is the reason we've gone to
the curriculum based
measures.
You,
some
grades may be inflated
in the classrooms and then when
the students take and this is what we've
seen when the students
take the state
test, then they don't
perform as well. So
that is why we've
basically
changed what we're doing
at Zuni and that is
developing
those measures and
not by just the
teacher. Ok. That, that
gives us that extra, you
know, oh,
I, you know, I don't want the
student to fail or I don't
want any student to fail. But at the
same time, we need a true
measure of what is going
on and I feel like
that that's gonna turn
our school district around.
Um
But we've seen that
and, and then for, that's
why I think a lot
of the test scores end up that way.
But we hope that
by making
those changes
and what we do
that it may, it may take, you
know, it's not gonna happen next
year. Um,
but we do think down the road
it will make a
significant difference where we
are >> Mr
Chairman. So are you seeing,
do you think you're seeing um,
a difference with the early childhood
education because you are
growing? But do you
think that's helping
the early childhood education that's going
on?
>> I think for us, I mean, it's,
it's something that we, we've
had a full day
pre
K.
Ok. But when I came
into the district, I've, I've been in the district
10 years. I started out as
a curriculum instruction
uh that we've had it the entire
time, a full day kindergarten.
So we've had that emphasis.
Plus we have
a, a I would say a good
working relationship with
the tribal head start.
So, and it is very
important. But again,
for us, I think we've
changed
uh some of our strategies
where, you know, it's certainly not
just a time for
socialization. We
realize even, you know,
at four and five
in order to make, make
sure that those students are
reading. By the time they get
to third grade on level, we
have to start
important things going on.
>> Thank you. And the other
thing is attendance. So you
said that
you were close to 90%
>> currently in this year,
Mr Chairman. >> What are >> you >> doing? Different
Mr Chairman?
>> So
there's, there's, that's a, that's a, that's
a, that's a long conversation,
but I'll give you a few things you want
if you want to dig on a, on, on
individual parts of it.
Um, one of the things that we're doing, we talked about
our career pathway work.
Our biggest struggle was at the middle
school and high school for tennis. I think
that's generally across
the country. Um And
so making sure that there's relevance
in the curriculum and what we're teaching.
I mean, you have to have rigor,
um make sure that you are doing
CB MS curriculum based measures
intern assessments and make sure
you're tracking students as they go
through to make sure that when there is
learning loss, you're addressing it as
soon as possible when they're not
meeting the skill level that they need.
Um The,
the other thing is making sure that
it's relevant
to the student. And so
we've, we've looked at the career
pathway work from the sixth through 12th
grade, making sure that
we're letting students know and
showing them and teaching them in a
way that they see that the work that they're
doing is relevant. When
anybody adult or a
student sees relevance
in what they're learning, they're
more, uh they're
more interested
in it. Um And then the third
thing is relationships, we focus a lot
on relationships. Um
If a student has
11
adult in the school that they
feel cares for them has a
dramatic effect
on their participation
and success in school.
And so we've done some things with
respect to how we cohort students in
our schools and, and make sure that
there's at least one
teacher that they have a
closer relationship with
that's concerned about their
academics. We
do similar things with a P
TT A parent
teacher teams. Um
That's why, that's why we drive have
that work that we're doing with parent teacher
conferences. We also do student
led conferences and
things like that that engage
the students. Not so it's not
just like a lot of teachers come out of college
want to teach like they're teaching
in college for
re making sure that we're
retraining them to teach
with co-operative group learning.
Uh making sure that we're creating
good, positive uh relationships
and a host of things to make
sure that we incentivize
and also encourage um
when I, when I go to a chapter meeting or I
go out into the community, that's what I'm talking about is
attendance. Like we
need to help us with attendance. We had a
huge push, invest a lot
of dollars and, and resources
into making sure that we improve.
And right now we're higher than we were
prior to the pandemic. Although I still
have a month left of school
and this is the toughest time of the year.
So I'm hoping we can keep at least above
90 even though it's still one
day per 10 of students
missing school on average, which is, is
not acceptable.
>> And one last question is just an
early college. Can you tell
me a little bit about your early college
program? >> Uh
Sure. Uh Mr
Chair representative.
So 67
years ago,
2018, thank
you. Um
We, we saw a huge
need for our students
to be
um that, that
could participate in college
classes. And usually it was done
usually at the high school where you teach
a dual credit
course.
But we found that when students
in our community ended up going to
college because a lot of them are first generation
college attendees.
Um and very few
and many, many of them are now
first college, uh first time
college graduates and their
families. But we
found that
we were struggling to some
extent to prepare them for that
new life. A lot of times when students go
to go to a new areas
in the rural community, it's a
drastic change when they go to a college.
And so one, you have an environment
change which can be
extremely stressful for
students and then
being able to
adapt from a high school
type of learning into
a college type of learning, which
is drastically different. And so what
we did and this is
actually in conjunction
uh Senator Munoz's wife was a part of
this work with us. She was our,
our first principal for that
program is
we believe that we can get
more students involved,
not in just dual credit, their high
school, but actually
physically in the college,
that they would have a higher success
rate and they could eliminate half
of that stress where they're used to the
environment, they're used to the way of
learning. Um Now they
just have to worry about a new environment
change from being away from
home. And
so what we did is we created a program
called mckinley Academy here at
University of Mexico. And we also use,
um, NA Ach
University in
Crownpoint where
we start at the ninth grade
level. We actually have our ninth
grade students that want to be in the program.
It's open to any student. We
don't decline any student. We do
have an interview process to let them know
the rigor of it and
expectations. We
provide all the transportation,
we provide all the food, all the
supplies, computers, books,
everything, there's no cost
out of pocket.
Um, our students then
at the ninth grade level can go to the
program. We have like a, we
teach high school courses
in the ninth grade for the most part
to get and it's a at a
faster pace to try to build them up.
So they're ready for the college courses
as they're, when they're a sophomore.
Um, and they take a college course
or two when they're freshman also just to get
used to it on the
campus and
then what we do is, and then they're,
then they're in classes if they can
obviously have to test in,
they test into the classes and take other
college courses for their sophomore year
through their senior year. And
so now we have five, almost
500 students in that
program. And so
500 high school
students out of our
3000 to
4000 number of students is
a significant, uh,
part of our population
that's physically going to the
campus learning
on the campus, getting college credits
and we're having students every
year. It's, it's growing in a number of
associate's degrees. We really focus on them
getting their associate's degree
that's easily transferable to
whatever college they go to.
And we're sort of every year we're seeing a
growth in not only
sometimes one up to
three associate's degrees being
earned by these students.
Um, and even if they don't earn
associate's degrees, they have a significant
number of credits that are
transferable that are U
and M credits, um,
or from NTU
and just have a huge head
start. And so we're seeing now,
after, after having this going
on, since 2018, we're now
starting to see the fruits. I get people stopping
me all the time. Like, you
know, my son or daughter just
graduated from college and they
just graduated two years ago from,
from high school and
they're already getting teaching degrees
or they're getting to med school really quickly
or whatever it might be whatever their,
their desire is.
And it's just made a huge difference in our
community. I'm hearing a lot of parents say like
that's my first, that's our kid is our first
graduate in our community
or in our family. Um
And it's just a, it's been a huge
success and we feel like
about that 500 mark is,
is kind of where probably where we'll kind of
really focus on that. It's kind of tapered
out at that amount. Um
But again, we're bringing students in from
an hour away, uh
transporting them to make sure they're
on time to get back. Some
places don't allow you to participate in sports. We
actually allow them to participate in sports
also. We get them back in time so they
can because it's an important part of their
life. And so we don't
exclude that.
Um And
then we also, even if they don't get
a associate's degree, we also, there's
credentialing programs that we, that
students can be a part of too. And
so we have, we work really
closely with our UN M
campus here in
Gallup uh to provide as many
opportunities as possible and they've been very helpful
as of late.
So,
>> um so
as far as attendance, all these
great things we do, if our kids aren't
there, you
know, we have to have them there.
So hearing that you're doing,
you, you're getting your kids there is
great. I know at my
school I have 11 schools
in my district and I've been
substituting. My license is still
good. So I've been substituting
and what I'm seeing is elementary.
They're not coming and
elementary there's, they're on
computers.
Every, every single class
I went to, they were just on the
computer and I just wonder
how they're learning. But,
um, it's, it's,
it's, um,
as a, as a teacher, I've been out
of the classroom for two years and
it's watching
them, especially at the elementary.
Not even doing math
is a, it's, it's
hard to do. So I'm just
hoping it sounds like you're going in the right
direction, especially with the college.
Um, at Manzano
where I used to teach, we used to have our kids who
went to um, CNM
or U and M for, for
uh college credits
go down to elementary and
talk to them and say this is what we're
doing. This is what I can do.
So can you, so the kids
understand they can do it too. Everybody
can do it. We just have to get them
in thinking about it, but
uh attendance is huge and it sounds
like you're moving in the right
direction for that. So, thank
you. Thank you >> for the
question.
>> I can add a lot of comments to that. But
like my son graduated
with two associates, got
a degree at 21.
Right? It's a
pretty unique system and,
and there's another charter school, we went
to both charter schools and
my wife who I call principal
Skinner.
He was from the Simpsons
really worked him over.
So it's a
very interesting program
and it's successful and
they pay their dual credit
costs with their seg.
They don't, they don't go to
the college and say you're gonna pay for it,
they pay with the
seg. So when these colleges are
saying we need dual credit money,
right? That money should
follow the kid to the university if
they want dual credit. So we're not
double paying. So
Representative Armstrong,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman and thank you
for your presentation. Um
Good to see you, Mike as
always for
years and rounds and rounds
and rounds of basketball,
volleyball. Now,
superintendent. So I
appreciate that.
Um I'm also
really interested in
how uh
you get your parent
involvement up.
Um As you know, I'm from
Magdalena, New
Mexico. We have a really high uh
problem with the chronic
absenteeism problem
and we tried things
for years. I sat on the school board
there for 15 years.
Um So attendance
and then um
parent, teacher
involvement. Uh
One of the things people
were thinking about and it was talking
about doing was
holding
uh attendance
as a grade
and uh you know,
you don't show up you,
it's a part of your grade. And
so I didn't know what you're
doing uh as far
as attendance and uh parent
teacher involvement, if you could elaborate
a little bit more so we could
share with other schools and
possibly make it better for
them as well.
>> Sure, uh Mr Chair
Representative Armstrong, it's
good to see you too. And I
do remember those days and
you, you said your daughter has six
Children and I just see her as
a blonde girl playing volleyball
against my daughters. So it's hard
for me to imagine that. But
um representative
with, with attendance,
I guess you that
maybe that's a strategy where you could
give a grade for attendance. I don't
think that's necessarily a bad
strategy but
usually usually
students that are deciding
or their parents are deciding those students
not going to school,
giving them a better grade probably
isn't the problem or the root cause
that we're going to solve the root cause of the
problem. Um There
has to, there has to either
be um
conversations
um attention
um given to those
parents to help them understand
the value of that and the student
themselves. Also, I think
those kinds of early
interventions and conversations
with students and parents are
valuable more
valuable than trying to fix the
problem after the fact.
And so we have really kind of
changed the way traditionally
a lot of schools and probably when you went to high school
or school and I did,
it was always kind of reactive, a
lot of things were in nature.
And so we've been trying to do more things that
are, are proactive in
nature to make sure that we're helping
students. Um
And so with attendance there, there's a host
of things and I think we've
touched on a lot of those.
Um but one of them is making sure it's
just, first of all, it's a
focus. Um
I think sometimes there's so many things
that people want to accomplish in schools
and there's so many areas in
need that we try
to do all of them.
And really, I found that for
us when we focus on a few
things and try to do them really well,
that's super beneficial.
And some people don't like that because you,
you think that you're not, you're not
putting enough effort into something else
that needs to be done. Well, you can only
do so much. And so
one of our, one of
our big
focuses over the last three years is
attendance and it's, it's grown over
the three years with
respect to the, the interventions,
respect to the resources.
Um Some of it is reactive,
you know, we obviously have things that
incentivize.
Um But I think really
having more
conversations or, or making
sure we have conversations with
parents has been the most
beneficial. And so the second part of
your question was about our parental
involvement. And so
I know, and when I was at Zuni,
they had, where they paid,
they paid elementary teachers, they
had to go, I think you still do this. I'm
assuming that,
that when we were there, we
had elementary
uh teachers that they, they paid
to make sure that they have a visit in the,
in the start of the year, they had to go make a visit
to the, the stu the
parents, the, the students
home, which is
great. I wish we could do that. I don't
know if we can quite pull that off in the
size of district where a little different
looking as far as geographically
and, and then, than
Zuni. But when I was
thinking about that, I, I thought
a lot about how do we
make sure that if we can't
go visit every home for every single
student, how at
least can we make sure that we
have a visit in some
form or fashion? And the pandemic kind
of led to some of our work in this is
that we don't just
have one night,
two nights a year, three nights a year or
whatever, where we have
a, where the teacher
or the parent has to come see
the teacher and then they rotate through all
their teachers in the classroom
or the classrooms and then
leave it. First of all, it can
be intimidating for some parents.
Um and also it's just not,
it's, it's very
school focussed rather
than parent focussed in my
opinion. And so what we have
done, some of our strategies
are, are built around. We do
academic parent teacher teams is we're
bringing parents
in to talk about
how they
can help
guide their students at home
and the learning that's taking place in the elementary
schools. So that's one thing
that's pretty much the basis of what
Supernet Stickney mentioned
um of, of that work
and what it's what, what it, what it
entails. We also
create a bigger window
for the opportunity for
those parent teacher conferences
to happen where
we are and using
different things other than just a physical
visit, it could be a virtual visit,
could be a phone call, whatever
whatever the parent wants, we
accommodate them to make sure
that during that window,
we have an opportunity to have
that conversation.
Um We
try to have it in school as much as
possible because it's, it's a
little bit more difficult virtually to
have the student led conferences
at the secondary level.
We want them when we, we, when
a student tells
their parent I'm gonna, you're gonna come to the
school and I'm gonna help present how
well I'm doing or what maybe
areas I need to improve
in that's a
lot more meaningful to a parent
and a family than if a teacher is just
saying, yeah, they got this grade and this is
what they need to do better. And yeah, they're,
they're shooting spit wads at the
whiteboard or whatever, you know what I
mean? And then, and maybe there's some complaints
in there. Um
Student led conferences are very
valuable and so
those are the types of the things that
we're rethinking the way we have
those in that engagement with our
parents. >> Thank
you for that. I, uh I'm
really interested in the
focus on the Children
being the ones to present
because we, you know, we'll do
anything for our kids. They're
in a game or a play
or a choir or
whatever it is, we're gonna go see that.
So, if they're presenting to us, I think
that's a really good strategy and I'm gonna
share that with all my schools
and because it's,
it's been a problem
um,
on your CTE,
I'm, I'm really impressed with
this pamphlet
here. Um
You know, the pendulum is swinging
for a long time. We said, oh, it's
all about computers and getting a college
education and
now it's swinging back to
the trades.
Um, my husband and
I are in the trades and it's,
uh, we recruit from small
rural New Mexico schools
because we know a
lot of those kids are going to grow up
and do that. And so
I'm, I'm pleased to see
all of that information and see
that it's growing the number of
interns, uh,
is really, that's
really good as far as pe
d reimbursement.
Um, I, I don't think it's
something new but is it getting
worse?
>> Let me just real quickly. We're going to shorten
our responses a little bit because we're running about
an hour behind right
now.
>> Uh Mr Chair,
um
Armstrong. Yes.
Is the answer to your last
question.
I mean, we, we talked quite a bit
about that particular
um subject. Um, Miss
Hanks, do you wanna, you wanna
say, is there anything else that you thought of
to say?
>> Chair and representative?
It's, it's
turnover, it's
change, it's, it's lots
of different factors and
I would say it's not an individual
at pe D, it's the system
itself needs some revamp.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr Chairman. That's
good to know. So we can
possibly be asking the
PE D secretary about
that. Oh, yes. I, >> I,
I just like to add one
thing.
I think as a result of the
recent federal audit
that was done,
we are seeing ped
ask for documentation
for expenditures they've never asked
for before. And some of it is stuff
that we've never gotten before
and a result as a result,
it's just delays, days
and sometimes weeks
on the time that you,
that it takes to get your money
reimbursed.
And as Joanna
said, I see names.
I see names almost every
week of people that are
reviewing our detail
that I've never seen before. I think
one of the biggest issues is they just have a
lot of turnover
and training new people.
>> And if you don't mind, I'll piggyback a
little bit off of Martin as well
on that is that I, I
would also say
that
the information we get comes
from fiscal and program
and they don't always talk to each
other before we get that information.
So program will tell us yes,
fiscal will tell us no or vice
versa. And so
we, we have a lot
of, of
roundabout in that
regard,
>> Chairman Representative
Armstrong,
I'm the president of the New Mexico
Association of school board officials,
school business officials
board.
We have started
to have monthly meetings
with ped to
try to work on some of these
issues and see if we can get them worked
out and we have invited
physical and program
to be part of those meetings
so that we can discuss
our issues with them and
we will continue to do that and
hopefully
between us working with
them and them working with
us, we'll be able to work some of those issues
out. >> Thank you
for that. It's good that you're doing
that because, you know, we can,
we can complain about it all we want.
But if you don't take the action, then it's
not going to change. So
that's good. Uh That's really
good to know. Um
As far as transportation
goes,
um you know, I did
invite the pe D secretaries
on a bus ride and the
governor to ride
the bus in my district
uh which would be the Kamado school
district number two. And
um and the pe D
secretary is coming on a bus
ride. And so I
wanna, I just want to
make sure that
people know
that
asking having
to beat the bushes and
ask
and bring up the issues
for a school district
that's obviously doing a really
good job. But to have
to keep trying to
figure out how do we get our money? How do
we get our money? How do we get our money
when we're one of the,
you know, on the higher end of
funding school districts.
But for you all to have to fight
and then we're pitting school
districts against each other when we
say Rio Rancho is getting more
transportation than, than
rural New Mexico. And,
and I understand that because
I represent rural New
Mexico.
Um I, I just
think it's, it's a sad
day for New Mexico when we have
to keep doing that over and
over and over
again. And pe D
as far as I'm concerned,
you know, the seg and everything else,
we've got to get this straightened
out to where we can. It's,
there's a formula
and you know what you're gonna get
and you know, when you're gonna get
it, that's,
that's being responsible.
And so I, I know
a few years ago, Mr Chairman
when we swept all the funds from
cash balances,
I was my freshman year
as a legislator and it was not
fun and not pretty, but
you got to put your big britches on
and, and do what you have to
do.
But we also know why
you have cash balances and
thank you for explaining that
because it's not just you, it's a
lot of schools that
have that. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
and, and
uh in lieu of
our time, I'll just
try to be very brief.
Um and some of the
parts have already been
mentioned. But
uh first of all, I just
want to thank
all of you, you know, this
has been a really good
presentation
and in fact, one of the best
that I have listened to for a
long time,
you know, so I really,
um you know,
have really
paid attention and also to
see, you know, how
your concerns and what
you're bringing up.
Uh Mrs Hanks, I
think many districts would love to
have you, you
know, you have really
show and
go. Uh
but
uh
yeah, but uh
with uh sunny
and also with,
um
Martin, I
hope that you do stay
on the legislative
Education committee because we
need that institutional
knowledge, you know,
and what more than
to get it, you know, from,
you know, the trenches, you know, and
working with, you know, like right
now, uh
is there anyone from
the executive over
here in the meeting?
And is there anyone from
the Legislative Education
committee?
See,
uh, oh, we need to
extend that invitation
and just so that we
can just all be
together and listening
to, to each other,
you know. So, you know,
I do encourage that we
invite them and that we
bring them to these meetings and
they can always have
representation.
But going into
um
um
I just want to ask you
um
you know, part
of the parent
you really have touched on some
of the things that I really support
100%
and I have some
other ideas and then I want
to one, you know, we could work
with you or share some
of those thoughts
and I'll just
do it with this
wherever you have
parental involvement, you
have success.
Whether if it's kindergarten,
high school college,
whatever it is, you know, it
follows. The
other one is just for
clarification on
transportation
to me, transportation
is very
special
and it's to and
from. So are there any
students that are being denied
because there's no
transportation?
>> We as a school district do
not. Mr
Chair Senator
Gonzalez, we don't
deny any students although
we do have some troubles in some
areas getting
buses and or suburbans
or small buses to some
locations. Um
We have to meet at a different
location because of poor bridges
or road conditions,
but we don't deny any
students but sometimes they have to travel
further than we'd like them to.
>> So then with that Mr
Chairman, then you do have quite a few
feeder routes.
Then
>> we uh Mr
Chair Senator Gonzalez,
we do have feeder
routes. We've tried to reduce those
as much as possible. The the the
introduction several years ago of
the ability to use suburbans has really
helped in some of that.
Um But we we utilize
whatever we can to make sure students get
to school
again.
It's a challenge and and as
was mentioned, mentioned by Representative
Armstrong, you know, some of our students
are also on a bus ride two hou
two hours one way. Um
And So there's, there's some
significant challenges in that
because of the remoteness
of a lot of our students in this
vast county, the
size of Connecticut, there
are, there are definitely challenges. And
so when you eliminate
something like a density
factor, um
it, it, it's, it's concerning
without analysis and I just want to
reiterate that, that
transportation funding deserves more
attention than just
passing a law without an
analysis.
>> Well, and uh with
uh Zuni, you know, I really
compliment you on
working on the outdoor
education.
We have been talking
about this for quite some
time and uh
going back to uh
Representative Ciana
stepped out,
you know, and she was saying, well,
why the absentee?
And to me, it's
simple,
you know, if the
students
have something that it's
challenging that they'll be
in school, you
know, and you reduce that
part, you know, the high
rate. And uh
very briefly,
I have mentioned this before,
is there was a teacher
from Albuquerque public
schools just
several months back
that took fifth grade class
into the bosquet to
study the water, the
river for like
15 days
and the attendance was
between 98 and
100%.
They went back to the classroom
and it dropped to
80%
you know. So if you have
the interest and if you have that
motivation that you have
there, uh the
other question that I had, as you
mentioned about having
coaches going to the
classrooms. So
does you have
enough coaches for all
classrooms or
they rotate or how do you
work that
>> we don't have? It's not 1
to 1. We just
have
and like our elementary
that has
a little over 400
students. We have
two instructional
coaches that are assigned to
that school site.
Middle school has
two and then high
school has one and then we
have one instructional coach
who services
the entire district. But
no, we don't have
enough.
They do go into every
classroom but not every
day.
>> Well, uh it does
work. I know that
having coaches,
you know, that just reinforces
the entire part of the
educational plus
becomes that mentoring
part, you know, into
making developing
a stronger training
for teachers. You know,
now with the initiative
that was thought of the governor
for, to
having a training
in science for teaching
reading. So
are you geared up for the
summer to send some to that
program
or
>> Mr Chair Senator Gonzalez?
We're, we're looking to
participate in that. We,
we have been
um
rearranging our summer
schools because there's
certain requirements for the funding
from the state to in, in
order to implement that. I
believe we just met last
week and we were able to figure it out. My
assistant superintendent was in that meeting.
Um, it's not here anymore,
but we're trying to
capitalize on that because for
us, it's, we have all
this loss and funding from the
COVID relief funds
we're trying to use those dollars
to make sure that we can sustain our summer
programs.
>> And, uh, with Sony, will you
be working with that
too?
>> We were still trying to work around
with what we already have
established for our summer
school. We hope to be
able to send some
representatives.
>> Well, it's, it's the first
year. So, you know, I'm
sure there's gonna be a lot of
adjustments and,
but a lot of funding went into
it, you know, that, you know, to
support this
and again, to
enrich that enhancement
for training
for our teachers, you know,
to, to bring that
uh two more things
that uh oh
no,
as far as replacement,
you know, of,
of buildings
and schools
and I think it's something
that, you know, I look
back that we
have to look at,
you know, and maybe that's
at our level and
also with the
department
is, and I'll give you an
example
in Albuquerque public
schools in Fourth
Street, there's a elementary
school, Corna Elementary,
that thing was built 80
years ago and it
looks like they just opened it up
yesterday,
you know, and to me
maintenance is a big
thing, big thing.
And so
somehow we need to tighten
that within,
you know, many directions,
you know, that you don't let
buildings get to a point
where you have to replace them
because of the
lack of maintenance,
you know. And
so that
definitely, you know,
is a lot cheaper
than building,
you know, then the other
part that I think that we might
have to look at is
so going
back,
the entire budget
process was
with D FA
and then that was transferred
to the public education
department. And in my
opinion, it never
really merged,
you know, when you had a, with
D FA, you had your checks
and balances
and you had, so I
think that's something that we
might, because, you
know, you brought up some very key
points, you know,
of
us putting you in a position
for unfunded
mandates. And that's
not right, you know, because
then that just really
creates a
different kind of setting that you
have to do your, your budget
with. So,
you know, working with
that and
uh you know, also
on the impact aid
you should have been getting this
years ago. It belongs to
you, you know, way
back, you know,
and you know, and I'm glad
to see some of the,
you know, that you have used
this funding for.
And so, you know, every
student deserves the best,
you know, and thank you
again for your presentation. Thank you,
Mr Chairman.
Thank you, Representative
Lundstrom.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Uh Thank you for allowing me to have
a little time this morning. I'd like
to thank the panel.
Also, I
had a, a
chance here to
kind of take a peek
at, at
the handout that was
provided by Gall mckinley
since this is the only school
district I I currently
represent. So my,
my questions will be for Mike and
Jovanna.
Uh you know, it was a, it was
clear
uh that
the public education funding
formula doesn't
work for, for my school
district. It's
clear,
you know, and um
a house colleague of mine
still continues to
carry
legislation
that
puts all the tribal
groups as one
and gives them all equal
amounts of money. Which is
crazy when you
think about where the
largest uh
tribe is in the
country and
yet you'll see that bill keep
popping up every
year.
Fortunately,
uh myself and
colleagues like
Johnson and Allison
are able to squash
that, but we see that
often
what I wanted to make the comment
about Mister Chairman was
looking at the cash balance
as I was quickly doing
my, my
calculation,
it's clear to me
that
at least
66 million
of this is
restricted,
restricted funds.
And then when you look at 30
million of it, that's a
alone.
So at the end of the day,
I mean, just quick
calculation,
a real cash balance
and that includes things like
carryover or payroll
liability, which you might have
some flexibility in
is about 80
85 million.
That's not a lot for school
district of this
size.
And I just think that
um it is, it is
very good that we were able
to work very hard
and I was proud to carry
House bill six, of
course, had a lot of help
from the school district,
the three impact a school
districts, my
colleagues, Representative
Allison Johnson
Conn and, and the
senators in getting
that bill through.
But it was, it was disappointing
to me that it had taken so many
years to try to convince
folks that
there's a problem here.
And gosh,
in the years I've been there a long
time and it was over
20 years to try
to get that into place.
And I know even
before that people were trying to
change it, other
legislators.
But my point on this
is that when I look at
your, I'm, I'm very happy that
you set this up the way you
did your cash balance
sheet. The
only change that I would
ask that you make
for your next presentation
is that you identify
through some color coding, what
is actually restricted.
And once you do that, people
are gonna say this money isn't
anything that we can
touch.
The question I also had
for you is
there's been a lot of hype
about community
schools. That was
something that came out of LES
C and jumping
up and down when I was
chairman of the Appropriations
committee and how we had to have
that in the education
budget. Do we
do that here in our area?
And what do they actually
do?
>> I'm, I'll, I'll give a
uh Mr chair
represent Lundstrom.
Thank you for your question.
I'll give, I'll give a little bit and I have
Giovanna because she's really involved
in the funding for that for the
district. I have have her tasked for
that. Um We, we
do have a community
school
and, but
from my experience unless
uh Miss Hanks has something else
that's happened since that would
change my mind. It's very
loose in what you
can use that money for.
We applied for it because
we're trying to create
a kind of a
career technical school on the
east side of town and using those
dollars to help us because
it's not just a school for
just anybody.
We're trying to use that money for a school that
just helps, not only our students, but
other community students
and even adults and even the
college. And so that's
kind of our approach. I think we're very
unique in our approach to using those
that funding from community schools
for that purpose. Um
I'm not sure what the rest of the state
does to be honest with you for
that or, or what they use it for. I'm sure
it's, I'm guessing it's good for
good reason, but
we were looking at it for a slightly
different reason with respect to our career
pathway work. But I
think
>> thank you chair
representative. Um so
we did, as Superintendent
Hyatt mentioned, we received
a nominal amount of funds and
we really went the community
school route for the additional
flexibility to
maximize resources in
our, in our community.
And so we're actually working with
the Southwest Indian Foundation
as well as UN M to try
to make sure that our career
technical programs can
be maximized both by
high school students,
college students and those
that are going through the community
program because those
resources are very expensive
to purchase and by
them being maximized, we'll have a
greater workforce here
for those various career technical
like welding, engineering,
carpentry,
plumbing, those trades
types, events, and
So our primary
right now partner,
which is the Southwest Indian
Foundation is we actually have students
who are co in cohorts
with adult learners.
Um building mini homes for the
reservation learning. The entire
piece of building a mini home
from carpentry to
foundation to
electrical, to plumbing
and they're getting certification with
that. And so that's our
target for our community
school. We really went after
it because of the flexibility
because we know that
we have to maximize our
resources in a county
that's this
impoverished.
>> The other thing, Mr Chairman I wanted
to ask because maybe I didn't hear
it clearly when the
question was asked
by um one
of the representatives about
the impact
of the early childhood
program
on these districts.
What I heard was,
it's non-existent.
I may be incorrect in
that. I heard a
response re regarding
head start, head start
has been around 100 years
since I've been in school head start
was around. But when
we talk about this early
childhood uh
program
that budget is bigger than
the public education
budget.
And I'm still not sure what
to do
because there's a lot of
competition with head
start and other existing
federal programs.
So my question is,
is, do you actually
see
improvement?
You know, we're putting kids in school
at three years old. Now
we're supposed to have educational
attainment.
Uh That's the measurement that we
put into that bill
and into the budget.
So, I mean, is there been
any difference than what we
had when we were just using
head
start,
>> Mr Chair Representative Lundstrom,
I maybe I didn't address
it, but we actually do do pre K
and preschool in all of our
elementary schools. And so
we, we can't
force parents
to bring, obviously, we wouldn't want to do
that students to those programs. We
do have more room for it, but we
try to maximize
as many students as
possible in
those programs, especially
those through child find
services um who obviously
have special needs
um before
they arrive in kindergarten
with um further
behind than they could have been. And so
we have seen that it has helped
uh students when we
do have students in those programs
because if not, then there's
a lot of times little instruction
that's happening to prepare them
for the the kindergarten
grade. Um And so
we, we actually do have that in
our school district, >> Mr Chairman
who's responsible for
recruiting these kids.
I mean, when we talk about
attendance and we
talk about your mandate,
your responsibility as a
superintendent,
you know, you have to make sure kids
get there.
So who does that? Is that early
childhood or who, who's
responsible for that?
Who markets to
parents that this
is available?
Is that on you guys to do
that? It's not
on the early childhood department
to do that
>> Mr Chair, they
may do some things, I'm not aware
of those. They may put out on our
Facebook as I have no idea,
to be honest with you. But
we, we want the funding
and we do promote it and
it has been beneficial. But
it is from my experience
unless Hanks
um has some other
information uh
that we, we do all of
it ourselves. We, we advertise,
we advertise, we,
we work with local
programs um who are in
Childline programs to make sure
that we try to encourage
those students to enter these
programs. But
we, we, we'd like to have
more because it is,
it is, it is expensive. And
number two is,
it's hard to organize in a rural area. If
you only have so many students, it's, it,
I can't have all of them come to
one location to maximize
the efficiency of the, the teaching
and instruction. And so
there are some challenges at
times of how many
teachers I can hire.
I can't do it like a 1 to
1 student teacher ratio.
I gotta, I gotta be realistic
in, in those ratios.
>> One of the, >> do you
mind if I add one thing to that?
So we get from them
through the state pre K fund,
they fund 19 teachers
and 19 assistants for four
Y students only.
We do run a three Y
program out of our title, one
federal funding and we've done that for
many years um because
they don't fund three Y students.
Um The developmentally delayed,
we get a portion of funding through
seg to help with the special
education of our developmentally
delayed. But all we're
receiving right now as a funding source
from early childhood is the
four y funding for
19 teachers and 19
assistants. That's
all. >> Ok. So
I guess my question
is, and
maybe that's a question
for somebody else,
but
that doesn't even make sense to
me when that program
and that bill was passed
and we put a heck of a lot of money
in that budget and in that
program, and
it's specifically to
help, uh you know,
these younger kids,
so they're ready to come into
the school programs
and we have these
independent, not,
I guess they're nonprofits or
private providers
also. And then you get
the uh public groups
like you providing those
services.
Um How are we
measuring that? How are we measuring
success for
that program? For school
districts like this one?
It's got some unique issues
anyway.
Um II I
think, I think that needs to be
looked at, I mean,
this
early childhood
program uh has
been kind of a sacred cow
by many that you
can't touch it, you can't change
it, you can't add beneficiaries
to it. But if it's
not doing what we
initially wanted it to
do and that was to
prepare, you know,
young Children
for the school environment,
I think it's
failing.
Go ahead, Debbie. I mean, you,
you >> just
real quick, you know, I
don't So, I, I don't
think we could compare when we went to
school to what we're seeing
now because when we went to
school, that's all there was school.
Now. They have computers and phones
and all these other things that take them
away from school.
And our biggest problem
is getting kids to school. So
you can't say this isn't
successful when we can't even
get them there a lot of times.
>> And my point is, is
how is it working in a
rural school
district? How
is a fund
that is probably close to
$10 billion
now and
designated to help
young Children
impacting
their success in
public education. I'm
trying to figure that out
because if they're only
getting teachers paid for out
of that fund,
who's doing the rest of the work,
like you say, it's a comprehensive
approach, it's got all
kinds of moving parts to
it. Who's doing the rest? It
sounds like it's fallen back on the school
districts.
Is it?
I don't know, >> I,
I will say this
this past year
we got substantial.
We, we only find 11
pre K classroom,
one teacher, one educational
assistant. And
in previous
years,
the funding took care of the teacher
at about half the cost of
the salary for the educational
system. This
past year, the the funding
was increased, it pays both those
salaries and general
supplies and materials.
As the superintendent said, we've
had the program in Zuni probably
for 1718
years.
So
I couldn't give you a
measure of, of the difference
between,
uh as the district is just
starting. And what we are are now
because we've had it for so long
and it's full day pre K
program.
But there is nobody
that recruits and there
is nobody that can force
parents to send their kids.
It's something they have to, it's
a decision they have to make on their
own.
>> I would say for
Zuni, it's
only
anecdotal. If
you ask the teachers
who are in the kindergarten
class, the teachers who are in the
first grade class, they're gonna say those
students who came through our
pre K program
are better prepared than the students
who immediately went to
Kinder.
But that's, I mean, honestly,
it's, that's about the only measurement
that we have.
>> So
um I guess
>> Mr Chair representative,
I just wanted to add one last
comment of, you know, our studies
at LFC have shown
that students who do
attend pre K do
better in high
school graduation. And previous
studies that show that
school based pre K
was better than community pri
provided pre K on certain
measures of proficiency.
But I think your question
about, does it work in
rural areas as far as
participation? Uh that's
yet to be
explored in our
analysis, you will
start to see
some more urban areas thinking
about doing larger centers
to sort of
combine their capacity
to do PRE K at large
scale. Um,
that's sort of the conversations we're
hearing right now from those
districts.
>> Yeah. And I just want the public to
know I was sold on that bill
because it was supposed
to be, it was supposed to be
impactful for those
districts that needed it the
most. So, as
we're hearing, these
rural districts aren't getting what they
need. And I
think that's incredibly
disappointing to me because
it's a heck of a lot of money that's
going into that program.
And um
I think it, it's created a
disadvantage. I mean,
because if you're an urban school
district, you can
set those programs up
and you and it's
uh more easily
marketed. You know,
I'd be real interested to see
if there's a
marketing effort by the
early childhood
department
that's even in the Navajo
language.
I mean, do the Navajo parents
even know about this?
Probably not,
which is incredibly
frustrating for me. That's
how I was sold on that
bill. I was
sold on that bill and that
budget amount because it had to
run through the budget committee
that it was gonna help
those school districts that
needed it the most. And at that
time, as
Mike had mentioned,
we were, we were low
performing and they
really improved
and they did it without
early childhood
funds.
So I think, I think that's something
that you need to look at.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> 30 minutes.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
First of all
representative Lundstrom said
head start was around for 100
years. And even when she was
going to school and I happened to know
because we're the exact same
age that
she's not 100 years
old
because I'm really good
at Syrin. We're about
35
but in the speed round now,
31% increase in
liability insurance
did something
happen.
Uh
>> Chair
Senator. No, that
was uh nipsy who brought
that forward and I'm not
exactly sure what contributed
to that. Um I know that there
was some anecdotal evidence that
was given in different
reports. Um,
but that was pretty much across
the
state.
>> Mr Chair
Senator
Senator in discussions
with the people
at NMSA. What
has happened is we have
a lot of designer
drugs now that,
that are very expensive,
we have a lot of people that are very,
very sick in this state with
a lot of uh,
a lot of treatments, cancers
and different things
and then nationwide
with all the weather, events going
on the
cost to, to
replace
roofs, windows,
whatever it may be, it's just
gone through the roof.
And that's why that those
are some of the contributing factors.
Why Nims rates have
gone up so much.
>> All right. Thank you. Sounds a little
extreme to me, accrual
versus cash.
Have we ever
done accrual
accounting in our,
so it's always been
cash.
I do a crull my
business.
I think that's something that we
definitely ought to look at, I don't know if
PE D needs to look at that or if
LFC needs to look at that.
But,
but you have to know
what, what's
coming, not just what
is so,
uh, next
native American component
for, uh,
seg
what do you mean? Because I
know, you know, uh,
CCS
D Gallet mckinley
Zuni
by far
majority of native
American students,
but my guess is Albuquerque
probably has just a raw
number larger than gallop
mckinley.
No, I bet you if they
wanted to count it they could.
Uh, but my concern
is how do you target
that to these
districts and it
doesn't show up in
Albuquerque. So,
do you do it by student? Do you do
it by district? How would you do
it
>> as we had that discussion over the
summer in that committee. That's,
that's, that's an issue
that, that, that
was brought up and how
difficult it would be to
include it in the at risk
index if you
included it.
The reason I, I made the suggestion
that I made
to tie it to
native American language and
culture teachers. I know that
that aps does have
those classes.
You could actually tie a unit
number
to those teachers
and multiply it by the unit
value to come up with a
number. Now, whether that's the best
way to do it or not, I really
can't say it would not
work for districts that have
native Americans but don't have
native American language and
culture classes.
Uh
I,
I would hope that we could have some
discussion about figuring out how
to include it in the at risk index,
which would probably be a lot
more fair.
I will say
that
and this is just an
opinion.
The
impact of
living on
a rural reservation
to the student is
probably substantially
different compared to
a Native American student. Living
in a very urban city
such as Albuquerque
>> Mr Chair. I
agree. I just
can see that
money just like all the other money
being sucked up by Albuquerque
because they're gonna claim the guy
that's uh Seneca
and the, and the Lakota.
And clearly we don't have
any
uh language
speakers for those around here
right now. But I
can see that they, they will count
10,000 Native American
students out of their 90,000
students or
even if they only count
5000, they're still gonna stuck
that much money out of it out
of where it should be. Which these
three districts, >> Mr
Chair Senator.
And that's one, that's one
way. That's one reason
if you tied it to them actually
having those teachers, which
they would have to report with a
special job class code
in their actuals. The state
would know if they would
be able to tie their actuals to their
application to make sure
that they have those teachers. It
also would require
that the school districts
collaborate with the tribes and
Pueblos because
the tribes and Pueblos are the
ones that issue the
language licenses.
That's it would,
it would prevent districts
such as aps from
sucking up all those funds strictly
based on the number of Native American
students they
have.
>> Thank you, Mr, chair members of the
committee and thank you for your
presentation.
Um Zuni Public
Schools um
from your
projects that you show here. It looks
like you're pretty resourceful
in finding funding in other
places. And also,
um as far as your design
goes, meeting
the students needs in those
areas, it
um because I've been trying to
get awnings out here in some
of our playgrounds and it
hasn't happened.
The um
how many Native American teachers
do you have in both
districts?
>> Zuni's current enrollment is
around 1075.
>> No. How many teachers?
Native
>> American
>> teachers?
>> 15, maybe,
I believe, maybe 15.
However, we do have the Ed
Fellows program
uh for those that are, do
not know what the Eded Fellows program
is. It is a program,
it is a, a state grant.
It was run through rec
nine
where
young people with, well,
I say young people, most of them are
with employees with
educational assistant licenses,
participate in a program
where they are in the
classroom. But at the
same time working towards
getting a degree,
we have 19 of those, I
believe there's
one of those 19, there's only one
that's not a Native American.
And last
year we one graduated,
I moved on to teaching this year,
another one graduates and I believe
we have two of them
next year that are on,
on schedule to
graduate.
So that's,
that's, that's, that's the pipeline
that we're going to have to replace the,
the current, the
current Native American teachers
that we have. So
>> that
1%
2%.
>> Uh it's probably
if we have 15 of
them. That would be almost 20%
of our teachers.
>> Gallet mckinley County Schools,
>> Mr Chair Senator.
Um, we, I don't know the
exact number of Native American
teachers, uh, that we
have as far as
instructors. I don't, I don't pay attention
to race. Um,
but we do incentivize
local people who are in our
community to get their
degrees and to come
work for us. And so we, we
heavily incentivize that with
finances, we do
offer programs also
not only for native American
teachers, but also
for teachers in general in our
community to be able part of a
preparation program. So if they're like
an E A, which most of our
um uh
I know that most of our eas
are a Native American
that they can be part of a program to get
their teaching license.
Um And so those are some of the things that we do
to try to encourage people in
our local area to become
teachers. Um But
I, I'd have to look at the numbers for
on, on race.
>> Thank you. And Mr chair members of the
committee uh
Zuni Public Schools is that
the only school board that
is 100% native
American
membership
in the state. Mr >> Chair
Senator of that,
I, I do not know about other
school boards, but
Mr Chair Senator, I would like
to respond one other
one other answer to
your question about
teachers at
our elementary school. We
have one principal,
two assistants. They are all Native
Americans at the mid
school. We have one
principal, one assistant. They are
also both Native
Americans. The only school that
we don't have Native American principals
in is of the high schools and
we're working towards that one.
>> So your administrative, that's
pretty high that way
up there as far as Native
Americans.
Thank you
and Mr chair
members of the committee with the Blue
Ribbon award. The
reason Lincoln Elementary
was able to receive that was one
of the criteria for that was
because of the diversity in the
population of that
school. So all
other schools would be ineligible
because either they're very
strong um
high in
Navajo or
um on the opposite
end of the spectrum,
the food and
nutrition, we put a bunch of money into
food and nutrition, uh puts
the school's planned as far
as um implementing that within
their, their school
district.
>> Mr Chair, Senator
uh Zuni Public Schools
has always been 100% free and
free and reduced lunches. They all,
all of our students get free
breakfast and free free
lunches. So we're not getting
any additional funding. >> So
on that, it's more about the
fresh food >> and
we participate in that program as
well. They have the
>> infrastructure.
Yes, I,
you only have a couple of schools in Gall
mckinley County Schools.
>> Mr Chair Senator, I'm
not sure we got that information. It's
inaccurate. We're also 100%
free and reduced and we
provide multiple
opportunities for even other
programs to provide food, even
during breaks. Christmas, we do, we do
a lot of different things with respect to
providing food because it's a valuable part
of educating a
student. We make sure that they're, they're
fed. >> So one
of my schools actually does not
even have an oven or a cook
stove on top
or to
even refrigeration.
So I, I think in
inventory because we did try to
make sure that all the schools did
have the equipment so
that the and even staff
to make sure that they were
able to implement a lot of the
fresh food to
bring the nutritional value up to
par. So I hope that
is something that is looked
into
>> inaccurate information
from you. And so I'm not sure that I don't believe
that's a it >> is to
school the
discipline policy.
Uh You said that it went down,
what did you implement to
help
that?
>> Mr Chair Senator Pinto?
Actually, we've been doing it for
years when
we first came in. We saw a high
rate of eight years
ago, a high rate of
referrals. Can I, can I
finish my comments,
>> Mr Chair, did you guys do? What was the
program? So
we kind of can look
into it. >> One of the
programs is kick board, but
I also mentioned a lot of different things that we
do. It doesn't take a program.
A lot of people think a silver
bullet and spending money
on a program solves a
problem. We look
at uh what
actually we do as a district
as far as how we work with
students. We talked about
the relevance, we talked about
the interaction of teachers and
and and students and
the adults in the school and
students. And so
actually, everything we do revolves
around the relevance,
relationships and
rigor. And so
that's what, that's what we, that's what
we attribute the reduction in
referrals uh for
students making sure that we're
preventative rather
than reactive.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair and
members of the committee,
the um
early childhood. So it's been
around for a long time
and uh you know that
it's very clear that we do
need to collect more data
because there's a lot of unknowns
that are, we're unable to
answer. Uh probably
need to go a little bit and beyond
that to really find out
how much
um
what you're implementing.
And I don't think
you actually answered the question about
what you were doing in extended
learning because that
extended learning was to close
those gaps, especially after
COVID. But
if we're still at a percentage
that isn't increasing,
then, you know, are those programs
that are being implemented um
effective. So
I would like to see that looked into
a little more as we
move forward.
And
>> Mr Chair, is that a question? >> Just
a
>> comment, you don't want to
>> answer that we've had it on
if we had head start and all that
going on for quite a while.
>> I think we also mentioned that we just
got the union to agree to
190 day
calendar. This is the first time we've actually
been able to implement it because
the law doesn't require it, of
students has to be
negotiated. And so
we've actually had the largest Native
American proficiency growth in the state
of Mexico for seven
of the eight last years
and also for large school
districts, we've been the fastest
growing seven of the
seven of the last eight
years in proficiency
growth and math and reading. So
there's some data for you.
OK. >> Let's wrap this up. >> OK.
Last question. When's the last
time you met with the vision of D
education?
>> Mr Chair Senator Pinto, we
meet often uh we've actually
had them come to chapter meetings with
us. Uh We meet
with Doctor Fling Clark quite
regularly. We do
consultation. Uh
We are texting each
other. Currently, we're working, we've
recently revitalized our
curriculum, pacing and
instruction for heritage
language. Uh with
our, with our work for
revitalization.
Um the Navajo Nation, the Department
of deay Education actually
went across the whole Navajo Nation
looking for a program that they could use to
share uh ideas
with each other and they actually picked
hours So we actually work with
them directly on the
curriculum that we have developed and
assessments we have developed
as uh
superintendent Stickney talked
about curriculum based
measures and in, in and,
and those type, those types of assessments
we've developed for a heritage language
program for the Navajo language.
Um so that we can tell
the growth year to year for
students. Currently, the
Nava Nation only has an end of
year or end of year
exam for students
who are seniors.
Um And so we want to make
sure that we developed a program
and assessment and a
curriculum that actually
works to truly
track uh students
growth with heritage
language. Um And
the Department of Education, we're actually
gonna give that to them so
they can share it because it's not something that we
just want to use for our students.
Obviously, there's
um that tens of
thousands of students out there that could
benefit from the work that we've
done that work came
from our COVID relief
funds that we dedicated
uh hundreds of thousands of dollars
to develop that curriculum.
Um And so we're happy to share
it with the Department of Education. We
actually have a really good relationship.
The board president is a former
assistant superintendent
of mine and
we have a very close relationship.
Thank you. >> I'm glad you mentioned
Asess Mr chair members of the
committee because the assessments
that I'm that coming
through to me are seems like
they're trying to restructure the
Navajo language in which
it's not spoken in that
manner.
>> That
would be correct. We actually use the content
in a standards from the Department of
Education and so another
falsehood.
>> Ok, we'll wrap kind of wrap
this up. We've run a little bit
late. I, I think,
you know, for us
in New Mexico we're almost at the
top of the amount of money that we're gonna
see over the next couple of years, we see
this leveling off and we're gonna
start to see a flatten and
hopefully not a decline,
but maybe a flattening depends
on what happens on our
dependency in oil and gas.
And so as we
move forward,
I mean, some thoughts are pe
D is just too big a
monster.
They have too many initiatives.
They don't know how to manage their
initiatives. They can't
get the money out. We hear this
time and time again
and I don't know if we need to restructure
pe D and split them
off, how we're gonna handle
that. But I think we're gonna create
a list honey with
when we meet with LSC and
say, ok, here's the issues that we're
hearing financially with,
with pe D and, and
they're not getting the money, they're
not getting the right amount of money,
they're not getting the structure,
they're not getting this. You guys can't
handle this. So how are we going to fix
this going forward?
It's gonna have to be
something's gonna happen there.
$4 billion 4.5
billion dollar
agency.
>> Four point >> four >> billion Mr
Chair. >> I was
close not to win
the lottery, but I was close.
But, I mean, that's the problem
that we see. I mean,
uh, the seg is not
completely out yet, right. The full
amount they're holding back
money and,
and that's not what you guys
need and we don't know
why we have no
control.
Um, There's a
big problem
uh
the,
the uh
Sonny, how much money have
we grown in the last for
at risk and, and the
Yazzie Martinez for in the
last couple of
years.
>> Um Mr Chair prior
to Martinez, Yazzie, it was about
100 million
uh Mr Chair. At this point,
we're about 360
million in the seg
attributable to the at risk
index.
>> So out of the 360
million, we still can't figure out how
to, how to get it. How many school
districts are really eligible for
at risk?
>> Uh Mr Chair, all schools
have an at risk index
of Gallup. Uh
Cuba are some of the
highest at risk
indices in the state,
but it depends on
once again their poverty
rate, mobility
and English learner
status.
>> So that 360
million was that really basically tied
to the Yazzie Martinez or how much
additional money did we put in there
for the Yazzie Martinez
>> Mr Chair, you've more than
tripled the amount that's been
attributable to that.
Um To
Mr Romaine's Point,
the court said that the
plaintiff
groups were
special
education,
Native American students,
English learners, low
income students.
The only category that
the formula doesn't
explicitly target
is Native American students.
Although there are other funding sources
including the Indian Education
Fund that are outside of the
formula that are
dedicated to those particular
groups.
>> So maybe you want to gather those,
I'm not an educational expert,
but we gotta, we gotta together those
for Native American students and,
and look at that set aside
in that way. I mean, the, the
problem with me is you
start creating different
races and education
and I'm Hispanic, right? Then the
Hispanics are gonna want their
set aside and then we're gonna have another
set aside for somebody else
and, and we're gonna dissel
that and water that whole formula
down. I mean, a
teacher in a classroom and I
should not look at somebody
whether their skin color
their race and say, OK, they're gonna get
more money for me. So I'm gonna make the
performance better. I, I
mean, it, it
will happen.
And so I think we got to figure that
out. Um
Let me ask
Zuni uh
in the Navajo nation. I know
we, I know that the PE D
Secretary
in House Bill two, we put an
additional $5 million for
education for Native
Americans. I know the
PE D secretary was
at uh window
rock uh talking
about the 4 million and how they're gonna
get the 4 million to the state.
Did the PD secretary meet
with Zuni about the additional $1
million that you guys are gonna
get
>> Mr Chair? Not that I'm aware of.
I know that in the bill that you spent
sponsored in Senate
Finance, I
was split among four
different school districts. By the
time I got to house Bill two,
it was split between
Zuni and the Navajo Nation. And by
the time the governor signed
off on it, the dollar amounts were
struck. So II,
I don't know that, that there
was any conversation at
all. >> The dollar amounts
weren't struck, the dollar amounts were
there. It was Zuni
and Navajo that were
struck from the bill.
So the million dollars and
he's already met with,
uh, the Navajo Nation
on the four. He should be
meeting me with the, about the
one. So start
thinking about that and how we get him
down there to talk about
that,
um,
>> chair Mr Chair. Thank you. I wasn't
aware of that.
Yeah, it's, I just
needed to make sure because he did
go to Navajo and, and
discuss that with them.
Um, I don't know,
we've talked a lot about,
you know, we're 1100
students being
short of the median
average
to, to be,
not be at the bottom, right? Graduation
rates. We know
that 7th, 8th, 9th
grade is where our highest dropout
rate is. Right? And
how do we continue that? I
mean, me and
my staff for Adrian have talked
to a lot of people and said, I mean,
maybe we need to create a student
bond.
It's ok if you're gonna go to school,
right, we're gonna
give you a bond.
I don't know if we buy it
first grade or if we
buy it in eighth grade.
So here's a $2000
bond. If you
graduate, you're gonna get this
additional money. But I don't
know how we get those 1100
students. That's not that many
across the board to
put us in the median of
the United States.
And I firmly believe this
and they say a lot,
I mean, we're not a poor state.
We have plenty of money.
We spend more money in education
than most
other states.
We're not a poor state is how do
we spend it correctly? And how do we change
the mindset? If we change
the mindset that a kid can achieve
anything they want to achieve?
Right. And we have
to lead into that in some
direction. I, I
think you've achieved a goal
because uh the
mindset is, oh, well, we're, we're
50th and, and I,
I'm, I'm done
and over with that,
change your mindset about how
you're gonna educate people and,
and get them there. Right. It doesn't
matter who they are where they're
from. I mean,
the education,
my dad told me this one time and I don't
know if I used it well enough, but
an education is something nobody
can ever take away from me.
You can go to jail, you can
do whatever. You'll never lose that
education. Right.
You know, whether it's a vote, tech career
or whatever. But
at some point we
have to change that mindset and,
and what's gonna change that
mindset we hear about,
oh, we need more dollars here. We need more
dollars there dollars.
But we got to change the mindset that
you can achieve a
graduation and you can get
there. 1100
students may be 100
out of mckinley County. I that
may be high.
Albuquerque may need
five or 600.
We lost cruce
however, the, it comes up
1100 is a small mountain
in each school district
to get us to the
median,
not to the lower
49 or
48 to the
median.
And, and I think that's something
we're really gonna have to look at
Sonny too is how
do we get there? I mean,
how do we change the mindset to
get to the
median? Because
we have enough money.
We're on a declining student
population.
So the student cost is higher
for a declining population.
And, and so the mindset has
to change and I, I think it has to change
with everybody
in the room here today is
saying, you know, you can achieve
this. We're not at the
bottom. I mean, we're not
poor, we're
not helpless. We
have the right things. People want to
work hard to make changes and
hide and, and,
and Martin
and them have showed us that they
want to make change and they want to make a
difference in how do we help
them make, achieve that change and get
that elect
1100
extra.
But I think that may just begin
with restructuring
pe D and that, that is a
tough conversation
uh in a long term
conversation. But
pe D
how many secretaries have we been through
in the last two years?
Four or five,
six,
six in the six years or six
in the six
months?
I mean, during the session,
I know we had 31
time. And,
and so, I mean, you
cannot fix problems
with if you don't have stability
in an agency and you know,
that bill that we passed
where, where board
would oversee the, the PE
D is, is probably
maybe past time, but we got to
create stability in the educational
system and they got to get the money
out and they got to do what they need to
do. And if
that's taking
down pe D and, and,
and restoring
it some structure that makes
common sense for school districts
to access money.
That's just common business
sense. You have the
money there, it needs to
get spent for these purposes,
spend it
and then we'll know exactly where we're at
as we move forward. So
that's kind of my comments. I appreciate
your time. I know we're running a little
bit late. I got other
presenters.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank
you. We'll see you next Thursday
because my wife told me it was
tonight not to be late, but
it's next Thursday.
>> You want to knock out the minutes in the
contract? Is there panels coming
up? >> Yeah, we're going to pull the
next panel up and so we're going to
approve the minutes. Well, if everybody
move to Tab
O,
we have a motion and
a motion by Senator Gonzalez
the second by Senator
or Senator Sheer.
A any objection to
the motion and adoption of the minutes.
If you guys could kind of move out
Quitely next
one, we're on TAB P, right. This
is the budget section.
>> This is uh Mr
Chairman.
So we have a contract
with Deloitte. Uh they've
wrapped up that work
and what we're proposing
is an additional
150,000
to help work with
us as oe
and uh D
fa they've
proposed a new salary
schedule. Um that's
consolidated all the different
pay plans into
one. The next phase of
this project is
as we move employees on
to the new salary schedule,
we need to make sure that they are, in
fact actually doing the jobs
that they labeled,
um um
says that they are so
we don't want to put like a food
service inspector
into an engineering
because environment calls
them engineers now, but that's not
what they're really doing. So
this 150 would help
knock out uh
creating the plan for how to
do that um for the next
six weeks, then we would
propose to issue
an RFP.
Um And if the legislature
chose to continue this
work, um with an
additional appropriation, we'd be
ready to go to
finish that before the session.
But just looking for approval on
that 100 and $50,000
amendment. And then just
to alert the committee that we've
also uh are
entering into a contract
with Laird Grazier to
help us with the um
water forecasting and
um for the setback
uh
research.
>> So, so we have
a motion, we have
a second by
a motion by Senator Gonzalez
second by Representative
Chatfield. Any
objection to that motion
before we move on to
that the personnel
study is going to be so important,
especially as, as we
saw it in the environment
department, right? And
they were going to sue us.
But when we
talked with, with
the
dot
And we told them that the
engineer rate that we had
planned was
$250,000
and they were offering 100 and
60 they were gonna
be well below what they
needed to be, but they're
gonna be short two district
engineers and made an offer
at a lower number
and, but we don't want
agencies exceeding
the number that they're
not a true engineer.
They're just an engineer by
label, not by A P
A or degree that they
need to bring them back down. And,
and so we want to
have this fixed so we can just be
done with the pay stuff
and everything leveled off.
So that
explains that. What's next
Charles? >> That's it
for committee approval.
We can move to >> the >> panel. >> You.
All right. Who's gonna
start us
off?
Who's gonna go
first?
>> But we do the business and
educational programming
from Zuni.
>> This Zuni.
Ok, great. Tell
us your name and then
>> uh good morning everybody. I'm
very happy to be here.
My name is Dr Reel
Laudat. I'm representing
the Zuni tribe with uh
Ashwick Tribal
College. Um I'm
the Director of
Instruction and Applied Indigenous
Studies there. We're a very
new college that we
are starting within
our pueblo. Um
We are in partnership with
Navajo Technical University.
Um We have been uh
open with them
since the semester
of uh spring
uh 2019.
Uh And I'm very happy to be here.
Thank you.
>> Play catch up real quick. Council
delegate karate. Thank you for
being here.
They
Cache
Turin
has she? And
then you're gonna go ahead
and start with your presentation. Then we'll
move into the next.
And do you have a handout or? >> No,
I do not have a handout, but I do
have notes for, from,
from, from my
here. Um So,
as I had mentioned
before, we
have been
open to the
Pueblo for
um since the summer, the
spring of
2019,
we um
started our partnership with Navajo
Technical University to
offer college and
career um
credits um
programs with what uh
Navajo Tech offers
the majority of our
students um do
go for their uh general
education requirements
there. Um
We had a started
off with uh 20
Brave Souls who would work with
us and then
we have just
blossomed into
uh our highest enrollment was
9090
students uh within
the uh I believe
the uh 2423
fall semester.
And uh we provide
um academic
support. I, I'm part
of the uh uh
portion where
I advise students
um make sure they're
matriculating through their
um
through their uh degree
programs that they've
um uh picked.
Um starting with the certificate
programs, on to
the associates programs and on
to bachelor's uh
programs. Um
Asi College is
very proud to serve
these students. Uh Our
top programs
are early childhood
and just listening to the
presentation
earlier that
legacy of
students um
wanting to become teachers,
wanting to become
um the leaders of,
of our pueblo is very
encouraging there. That's one
of our highest um uh
numbers there. I
was a teacher within the Zuni
public school district for 20
years and I moved
over to the college. So I
do have that
connection with uh
Zuni public schools, uh the
assessments that they're
doing um and
providing for our students.
Um I'm still connected
with that. So I'm also an
adjunct instructor for the
early childhood um
classes that I teach.
So I have that connection
that really helps hopefully
build that foundation
for our new teachers going
in. We have
um uh graduated
five teachers from our program
into uh that are from
our Pueblo who will
be joining
the uh classrooms
um uh there with Zuni
public schools. Um
Our other programs that we
have are it uh that's
another program that uh
many students go into
culinary arts is another
one that our students
are very
to be in nursing.
Um uh administration.
Uh Public Administration is
another one, those are
online programs and that
really helps our students uh
tap in, especially
when they're working
um full time.
Uh And uh having that
access in the evenings or
online. I is when
they can tap in and
from, from just my experience
working at the higher ed
level, uh, access
is what is really important
for our students. And then the
ability to be able to
tap into those classes
and then have the support from
us, whether it's tutoring
or, um,
scholarships and
keeping them going so that
they, uh, finish,
uh, from semester to
semester. And, and
then of course, also graduate.
Um We also have
an, an entrepreneurship
within our
college and that's
um one program
that um Hayes Lewis
really works
toward. Um
we have had experience
with um traditional
pottery teachers coming
in and also basket
makers um and
providing that uh outlet
access to our community
members who would like to
pick up that um
uh craft and,
and um possibly
use it within
um creating
some kind of income base for
themselves. We also have uh
our newest
um program that we're going
to be launching uh are
to be how to use drones
and how to become certified
in using drones. We've
had a sewing club
as well and these
sewers um also
create um
their products and sell,
sell them with in
the community. Um
And then we also have computer
classes available to
our community
members who want to
just basically learn how to
use a computer.
Um We
have um also
a Zuni Tribal
leadership program with
the Pueblo of Zuni,
these are directors
and um program
coordinators who come
and they uh participate
within a 12 to
4 week
session to be
able to um
craft and
structure their leadership
skills so that they can
work within their uh
offices and work with
the community um
in a better way. So those are
the highlights that we
have with Ashu
Tribal College. We've
also partnered with
um the IHS
um program
um and with U and
M to have
eight Zuni
translators
be part of this um
medical interpreter
program. Uh Many
of our um um
Pueblo members are
um very
dominant in the Zuni language.
And so when they have something
that uh is
being um
communicated to them,
that could be very
difficult like a medical
procedure or medicine.
Uh These eight Zuni
translators have gone
through a program to hopefully
address that issue so
that our um um Pueblo
members can understand
what kinds of procedures and
medicines that they're getting.
Uh And this is a brand new
thing we just started off with, with
the program. Um
And uh and then we also
have another um
partnership with the
Zuni Youth uh
encouragement
um development group,
Zyep is what is it called?
And we're going to
help them um
develop a day called
Pride Day. And this
is to support the gay and lesbian
community within our
uh um our, our
Pueblo and
have um that support
for our Pueblo members
so that they can be
supported in that we
will have some free A I
testing going on
and different works, work
workshops going on
within that day. So that's
one of our 1st 1st
things that we're um this
is our first annual
um uh event
that will be helping along with
them. We also have a
community garden that
is going to help
um um
re
I guess reeducate bring
up um
how,
how we were,
how we sustained
our ways
of life through gardening.
And um uh the
techniques that we used
to help our
garden gardens flourish
uh especially in an area
where there's not a
lot of water. Uh
So, um bringing
those uh ancestral ways
of knowing and how to
develop gardens and be
successful is, is
another portion that we have
with Ashu Tribal College.
Uh We also partnership
with um have a partnership
with the Mother Moon Project.
Um And that is going
to help us bring
in some greenhouses
so that we can uh develop
some fresh gardens and
then also have some uh
medicinal plants that
can be part of that
process so that we can start
learning how to, to
use those things. So, out
of this whole experience
uh being part
of Tribal
college, um One of
the biggest things that we're also moving
toward is to become
an independent TCU.
And that's been
uh in the process in progress
for uh at least a
year. We have consultants
helping us and um
we want to have our
own um tribal
college um uh so
that we can be an independent
college within our Pueblo.
Uh And then also provide
the programs that we would
um that we see the need
in, within, within our
pueblo, in our community.
And um the,
the
idea of partnering
and um developing
those positive relationships
among our um
pueblos and the programs that
we have really helped us
uh become stronger.
Uh and then also supporting
the programs of making,
ensuring that our budgets are
supporting scholarships
and students um
is, is is one of our biggest uh
things that we do and then of
course, the time and the
um advisement that we
provide. Uh
those are the highlights of,
of our um
school. Are there
any
questions?
>> Thank you. I think
for the background that used to
be a U and M branch >> used
to be UN M and
>> you decided just to dump
the building. Exactly. And
then we struggle with how
we get that back up and the services
there was a small amount of tenants but you
and dumped that in your
lab. And so
it's become an issue. So
who's going to start us off
next?
>> Hi, good afternoon,
Yade.
Hi. My name is Claire
Pratt, a member of the Navajo nation,
uh born and went to school
here in Gallup, New
Mexico. I am
the CEO of Strongbow
strategies as well as
the chairwoman of the board
for Navajo Power
um Strongbow Strategies. We're
a federal procurement
based firm based here in
Gallup. Uh We also
focus on economic development
and energy development in that
space. Um We
grew from employee number
one myself in
2018 to
over 100 employees
nationwide. Many of them
in this region,
um, we are set to hire
about 25 more individuals
in the Gallup New Mexico area
over the next two
months. Uh, so we're
in that hypergrowth stage.
One of the things that we really focus
on under Strongbow is
culturally competent.
Um, and I think as we saw
from the last panel, it makes a difference
when you have culturally competent
individuals running our
systems. So
with that, um I wanted to
focus my remarks
uh specifically on Navajo
Power in my role as the
chairwoman of the board there.
Um What we do at Navajo
Power is we're focused
on clean energy infrastructure
development. Uh We're
a leading developer, we
really bring cultural
and linguistic aptitude
to clean energy
development space. Most of the
individuals and companies
that work in this space are
multimillion dollar
fortune 500
corporations, things like your
next era, your
in energy, your a
es of the world.
So we came into this
pond as a very small
fish, but really
wanting to make a difference. And our
focus is specifically
clean energy, specifically
solar development on tribal
lands for the benefit
of tribal communities.
Like most
individuals in the
room that are indigenous and grew up
on indigenous lands. We've seen
a lot of usage of
our natural resources without
not a lot of benefit going
directly to the impacted
individuals. So
we didn't want a quote
unquote greenwashing
happening in terms
of solar development that became
very extractive and taking
away and instead is more
investment minded.
So with that, we know that
there 574
federally recognized tribes across
the United States with on
those lands, there are
262 gigawatts
of estimated solar
potential on tribal land.
Specifically Navajo
power only works on tribal
land as developers
and 18 gigawatts
we estimate of
proposed transmission
projects near tribal land.
So we know that we have that issue
in the four corners here on
Western Navajo and not
just on Navajo but tribal
lands throughout the
country. The
majority of this solar
potential is actually in
the southwest region.
So the the new
Mexico market, as well as the
Arizona market, California
market extremely
prime for solar.
Now, when you look at solar development
and you were to look at a map of the
United States and you look at
tribal lands, you would see
that very
little is being done
in solar on these tribal
lands. We can speak
to a little bit about what those barriers
to market and access are
and what we're doing to
address those things. So
approximately 5.8%
of the continental United States
is tribal land, meaning
it's tribal trust land, we're not
talking fee or any
other allotted,
anything like that. Just tribal
trust land occupies
5.8% of the entire
continental United States,
but it has 6.7%
of the country's solar
potential. That doesn't
count any other renewables,
hydropower, geothermal
wind, etcetera. If you put
all those things together, it's
up to 20% of the United
States renewable market is actually
on tribal land. So
when you see those dark spots on tribal
land not participating
in energy development,
um it actually means that the
United States as well as these
tribal communities as a whole are
missing out on a very big
economic development
opportunity. Um
So again, solar and tribal
lands is a 262
gigawatt opportunity.
New government programs are
really opening the doors for tribes
to participate in a more robust
way with those programs.
The inflation reduction act
is allowing direct pay
so tribal governments can
actually receive the tax
credit through that program
where they never have been able to
before no tribe
has actually participated in it
yet because it's been a very new
program and Treasury has just
promulgated the rules. So
we're a little bit flying the airplane
as we're building it.
You know, we're trying to figure it out,
but we know that it's there
and there is an opportunity.
Um We created Navajo
power, a three gigawatt pipeline
of solar assets and our mission
is to create 40 gigawatts of
solar across tribal communities
in the United States. We
partnered with a Fortune 500
company in 2022
for long long term
owner operator
um status and I'll get a little
bit into why we chose that
model and how that all
works.
Um The last bullet
point on the executive summary deals
with another company that we founded
called Navajo Power Home.
So when we were working in these
communities and mostly
on the western side of the Navajo
Nation, we would come into these communities
and say, hey, we want to
build a solar field here. It's gonna
be, you know, 5000
acres, don't you want us? And
they look at us and say, well, how much of
that electricity is going to come
to power our homes?
And it felt really bad to say
none of it because it's all
going into the grid. But
you'll get all these benefits and you'll get
money. That was not an
acceptable answer for our communities.
So this is where the cultural competency
really comes into play.
So we came in and we said, look, it
does go into the grid, you
will receive economic benefits.
However,
let's develop another
solution for off grid. So
we launched Navajo power
home in 2023
and we've already electrified,
it says 100 systems, but
now we can update this to 200
systems across
most predominantly
western Navajo in the former Bennett
freeze area where we said, look,
we get that this big project
that will come online in 2026
will not power homes individually,
but we're building individual
off grid solutions for
these homes where we can put
panels out outside of homes
that are off the grid and that was
acceptable.
So what we end up doing and
why it's really important
to have companies like ours
is to develop that
relationship and tribal engagement
and why you see those dark spots
across tribal communities where
there should be renewable development,
but there is very little
to none is
that an outside developer will come
in and not understand
the lay of the land, not understand the
governance process, the
regulatory process.
Um We meet with a couple of
tribal leaders, they might
get a, you know, a
a thumbs up and they
assume that that means
they're good to go,
but they haven't engaged in the
community, they haven't done their
diligence. And so we started
from a grassroots approach
versus a top down approach where
we engage with the local chapters,
the local local grazing
officials and the local impacting
the impacted grazing
users, getting
that support from the
community. First and
foremost, ensures
that as we get to the lease process,
we will not have, you know, a
lot of last minute things coming
out. So we're still going through that lease process
with the nation now. So we
get that tribal support
and community engagement. We identify
collaboratively with the tribal
nations, a feasible project
site we do
at our own cost without any
cost to any of the tribal nations.
We're working with all of the
assessments, the flyovers, the
desktop analysis, the environmental
review. And
then we really think about that local
workforce development, what's going
to happen, how are jobs going to
be created? How are they going to be
advertised? The long
term term owner operator, are
they going to abide by Tao
or workforce
development laws that may be
different from tribal nation
to tribal nation? Like the Navajo
Preference Employment Act.
The way we are structured
is as a public benefit
corporation, which is a unique
structure. We are for profit,
but the majority of our
revenues,
profits have to go back
into benefiting the
community. We are
86% employee
owned. So those
of us working in the company
own the most shares of the
company. Um
10% of the company we
hold in what we call the turquoise
share, which will be for
the benefit of local communities that we're
working in. And 4%
of our company is held by
outside investors, impact
investors. So we became
funded, not
through regular financial investment
markets, but through things like
the Schmidt Foundation,
other entities,
nonprofits that are mission
aligned with the work that we're doing
because we operate like a
different than a regular
developer. We understand
that we can't come in year one and
have a project year two. It's a
multiyear process. And so
we need investors that are very
patient with waiting
for the return on their revenue. They
understand that it's not going to be a turnover
within a year. It's going to be 35,
10 years.
Um There's a
page here on the founders
and who we are. Mr Isaac
was supposed to be here today.
He's also um a, a
brother of
mine from Navajo Nation.
He is working on a project
for us up in Oregon, so
he had to fly there. So he sends his
regrets and apologies
and has conscripted
me to, to, to do this
instead. Um
But again, we have a pipeline of
projects um
all over the country
only working in tribal
nations. But we're not, even
though we're called Navajo Power, we're not
specific only to the Navajo
nation. We've been doing energy
projects with other tribal
nations in Oregon,
Washington, California,
other parts of Arizona, as well
as the Midwest.
I've talked a little bit about Navajo
Power home and
the off grid services we provide
there. Um
Again, the purpose for
Navajo Power Home is off
grid for all families to have
power regardless if they're getting it
from the grid or not.
Um The project that we
are most furthest along
is the painted desert power project
which is 750 megawatts.
It will be one of the largest
solar fields in the
United States.
Um 4600
acre acre parcel. It is
on the western side of Navajo
Nation. So
that that will be a very, very
big project set to come
online. We we're hopeful
if the lease process goes as
planned, that will be online
in 2026. We've
been shortlisted with
AP S on that
project
a little bit about the project
benefits and also to get
into a little bit about the barriers
to entry. Um not
only does the time take longer working
on tribal nations, but
there's also the issue of dual
taxation that we're trying to work
through. So
that's something that, that we continue
to have dialogue with various tribal
nations. On how do we
ensure that, that the tribal
nations and the tribal governments
that we're working with are benefiting
from either tax or lease
or some combination thereof
um without giving up the baby
with the bathwater to the states.
So it's something that we're mindful of
and we're working collaboratively with
states of jurisdiction to
make sure that there's equitable
division of resources as
we're developing these projects.
Um The current business
model is Navajo Power. We
come in as the developer and we
Derik the project, we do all of
the front-end work, we bring the outside
capital and the investment so that
the tribal nation is not on the hook for
any of that. Um And
then we engage with a long term
owner operator. This would be your fortune
500 companies to come
in once A PP A is in
place, they're more likely to
say yes, we want to buy the project because
then it's just derisk revenue
stream for them at that point.
Um We sell that project in its
entirety with some caveats
that there are things that have to be
followed in terms of dealing with the tribal
nation. And then it goes out to the
long term energy buyer
and you've got a revenue stream for
25 years or so for the
tribal nation and the long-term opener
operator. Eventually
we'd like to get to the, the
model where
it's not a long term owner
operator that's nonindigenous
we would like to see tribal nations be
the long term owner operator
in a model that's
yet TBD. Um We
are currently working with one
tribal nation that does have the
capacity to long-term owner
operate and they are in the Midwest
and we hope to see that model come
to fruition. Um
as, as more as, as
this develops more. We
also want to make sure that in any of these
projects, we develop that there is an
option for tribes to purchase
equity in the project. So
let's say we're developing a project
on the nation on Navajo
Nation. Um It's
not just here, it is, it's
gonna operate and there's a
lease payment, it's here,
it is, here's a lease payment and
there's also a carve out of X
percent that you can own
should you want. Um
It's not required at all, but
if the nation does wanna be
a substantial owner in that
project, they can do
that.
And with that, I think
that kind of brings us to the end
of the salient points
of this. And I'm happy to answer any
questions if there are
any.
>> Yeah, Bennes,
good morning chair
and members of the
committee. I'm
Amanda singer. I'm the
executive director for the Navajo
breastfeeding Coalition.
Um We, we
actually are transitioning to a
newer name using the entire
year 2024 to make
that transition
and our newer name is going to be
Navajo Birth Worker Collective
and you see that on the agenda. So
just a disclaimer, I'll be
using both
names and alternately
alternatively,
I'm also a indigenous
Dua and a certified lactation
counselor. And
I have my colleague and team
member, Natasha Bowman. Up here
with me, she's also
an indigenous DUA as well
as a Navajo
student
midwife.
Mm
We always have to put the um financial
disclosures on. I have
no
um who we are.
Uh the Navajo Breastfeeding Coalition
were founded in
2008.
Um We also
have a DUA collective
that is under the
umbrella of the Navajo Breastfeeding
Coalition and that
was founded in
2019.
Um We basically cover the
Navajo nation and urban
indigenous communities
like in Gallup,
Albuquerque, um
Phoenix and as well as
Flagstaff.
Um We are comprised of breastfeeding
advocates, community
elders, indigenous birth
workers from the community,
birth justice advocates and
reproductive justice
advocates.
Um And again,
just a reminder, transitioning
um in 2024 to Navajo
Birth Worker
Collective.
And then you'll see on the
powerpoint slide. There's a picture
here and we have
these yearly um
healing retreats for our birth
workers. Um
Just to remind
ourselves to take care of ourselves
because the brunt of our work, we
do take on a lot
of secondary traumas on behalf
of our pat um our clients,
especially within the hospital
setting. So this
um these healing retreats are primarily
focused on
um everything
around it, like the workshops,
trainings and education
is for the self-care
for our, our team.
And then you'll also see the services
that we offer um
throughout the four corners.
Um And that is even including
Colorado and
then we have APR code if you want
to have access to
um a lot of the other
information and projects that we've been
working on. And then there's a
link um the the link tree
too.
So our mission
statement,
the mission of the Navajo breastfeeding
coalition is to improve the
health of Navajo families by
providing compassionate,
unbiased and accessible
care to improving
all birthing families and infant
health through holistic traditional
practices and to promote
healing
our work. Um We are
working towards normalizing
human milk as a first sacred
food, reintroducing,
reintroducing cultural
birth workers on the
Nava nation with support from
traditional practitioners and
elders
revitalize and preserve
Navaho cultural prenatal
birth, postpartum and infant
practices.
We educate on harm
abduction and trauma informed
care. And
we also help our clients to
navigate, navigate through
socioeconomic
barriers as
well as do um
commu community outreach
education and
campaigns.
Um We also promote public
policies that support cultural
birth work
and we also are
in the midst of cul cul
creating culturally congruent
birth work and lactation
education material
and you'll see some samples
in the next
slide.
And then also our work
continued. Um
commun we actually
created a community-based
electric breast pump program
to increase access for
Navajo and other Native
American parents.
Um We actually had to create
this during the pandemic
only because of the shutdown
of the hospitals and
then the closure of WIC.
And um we wanted
to, we, we had a
public um
demand from our communities
to, to um give
them access
with reduced barriers to
electric breast pumps.
And so, um we had a, a
good flowing of
funding during that
time. But since the
closure or since the pandemic
has been lifted,
um a lot of that, um a lot
of that funding has decreased.
Um but the demand
is still up there. So,
and then um we also
are very aware um
involved in breastfeeding
awareness campaigns,
advocating for equitable
access um
to maternal health
care. We are
also a referral program.
Our direct support providers are
very well versed
and well aware of their
resources in their communities.
So, if their clients
have any questions
or concerns about like their mental
health or their um
general physical overall
health or their infants health,
our direct support providers
pretty much have um they,
they know where to refer um
their clients.
And we have also have been
involved in research support
as well as policy and
advocacy
work.
And then on that next page, you'll see
some of the things that we've also
been involved with. Um we
were actively involved
in the planning stage of the Welcome
baby celebration. Which occurred
on April 18th in
collaboration
with the First Lady Jasmine
Blackwater and migraine.
And then um I know there were
some questions about our little
Doula Mobile. Um
You'll see a picture of
that and
then um we are also in
partnership with um
New Mexico Breastfeeding Task
force, both futures
in New Mexico Department of
Health. So,
um when you drive around uh
New Mexico, you'll
actually see two
billboards um
with our logo on there.
And we usually do that
every August during Breastfeeding
Awareness
Month.
And then when you turn
the page, you'll see um samples
of our culturally congruent
breastfeeding education
material. Um
We're actually launching that
material. We have finally
finished it. It took about
maybe about a year and a half
for us to complete it.
And this was in collaboration
with Sedge
and they helped us
with the um the
translation from Navajo to
English or
English to Navajo. I
mean,
so just to give you a little
insight of what Adua
is, um there's
really no Navajo word
for doula. Um And
we are actually working on that
um interpretation with psychedelia
as well. There's
a Navajo word for
midwives, but not specifically
doula. And we want to make that
distinction between the
two.
Adua is a nonm
medical support person
who provides emotional
physical and educational
support to a person
who is pregnant, is
experiencing labor or
has recently given birth.
The doula purpose is to
help people have a safe,
memorable and empowering
experience.
Some doulas have additional
training that enables them to
provide services
to families across the full
spectrum of reproductive
choices and experiences
including
pre preconception,
abortion, miscarriage,
stillbirth, and infant
loss. And that was
borrowed from Table Woman
United.
Research indicates that
doula care improves
birth outcomes and overall
birth satisfaction result
in large, resulting in large
duration, longer
duration of breastfeeding
and reduce cesarean deliveries
and preterm birth, the use
of epidurals and overall
facility costs.
And um that statement was
borrowed from both futures
and basically Dulas
birth support workers do
help save money
and um just a reminder
doulas are not
midwives.
So these are some of our
potential overall
outcomes um that we
are working towards
equitable access to birth
choices and birth settings,
birth settings, meaning
um rural Navajo
communities as well as
um bordering communities
need more um
other choices as far
as birth settings.
Um What you mainly see like
in the rural
um Navajo areas as well
as um the bordering
communities
is the choice of having um
your babies in the hospital.
Whereas in metropolitan
settings like Phoenix,
Albuquerque and
Flagstaff, you
have a choice of birth
centers, homebirth, and
hospital births.
And I think if those three
choices were given to
um our indigenous
relatives, you
probably have an increase
in prenatal care, early
prenatal care and
more than likely a reduction in
the congenital syphilis
rates. So I
I believe that's one of the
huge missing pieces. And that's
where we, we are seeing the
gaps
increase um
public acceptance of
the benefits of breastfeeding
and culturally congruent birth
work increase
behavioral change that
results in increased
rates of breastfeeding,
initiation duration
and reduced maternal and infant
mortality rates,
revitalize and normalize
culturally congruent lactation,
education and Navajo cultural
teachings on birth
practices,
increase community um
understanding of the role of
cultural teachings and cultural
feeding practices
to improve overall health and
wellness,
normalizing using
ceremony as a way of
life to retain balance through
mental and physical healing
by using traditional healing
ceremonies.
Um We
are striving to meet the needs
of lactating employees,
parents and providing
optimum support in
community settings,
hospitals and businesses,
etcetera.
We are also working on increasing
acceptance of implementing
integrative medicine as a
vital form of patient care
and health care systems
and increasing education
to indigenous birth families
on informed choice
and informed consent.
And then the next page, you'll see
some pictures of myself
at actual homebirth on the
Navajo nation.
Two of them happened in
San Juan County and the one in the
lower corner happened in
Hunters Point Arizona.
And I also want to make a disclaimer
about that. Um There were, there
were midwives present at all.
Three of them doers
are doulas are nonm medical.
So we always make sure that there
is a provider
present
and then you'll also see the Fifth
Wheel. Um And that
Fifth Wheel does not belong to the
Navajo Breastfeeding coalition.
That, that Fifth Wheel is
actually privately owned
by Natasha Bowman and her
partner Larell Skeet.
And the reason why,
um, they allowed
us to use it for the, um,
primarily the farm
birth is
because, um,
that birth happened
in the mid middle of summer.
Um The, the parents were
adamant of having
a homebirth, but alongside
their cornfield and
we actually found um, a
midwife to come
out and support that
effort. And I
also want to um put
out there that there are two
unconventional,
conventional ways of becoming
a midwife. Everyone's
prefer um pretty much
um aware of the certified
nurse midwife, but there are
licensed midwives and
certified professional
midwives and
I believe um Juanita,
she's AC PM,
right? Yeah,
wea um she comes
out from her practices in
Durango, but she lives
in a Aztec
and she was able to help
support that birth, but
we wanted to make it as safe as
possible and
to ensure that the
our client doesn't have,
you know, develop like heatstroke
or dehydration.
And that Fifth Wheel there
actually provided the air
conditioning and
then immediately
after baby's birth. And
when the midwife um
stated
that um when she said that they
were, you know, stable enough to be
moved, um
mom and baby were moved into
that Fifth Wheel while the heater
was running to keep the heat
going. And then
um they were immediately placed
in the primary suite of
the, um RV.
And then right next door was the
restroom because if we didn't
bring that RV
out, what would
have happened was they only had
like a hunting tent and then a Porta
potty. So we wanted
to make that, um, birth experience
happen for the family.
But we also made sure that
um, there was a midwife
present and the
midwives are very responsible
the homebirth midwives.
Um, there, they have a certain
parameter that they will only
allow themselves to go
away from the hospital.
And um the one in K
that was only like maybe 15
minutes away from the hospital.
And then certain homebirth midwives
too, they'll actually work with
the hospital to allow
them to, they let them know that
that is going to happen so that they're
aware of it in
case in the event of a
transfer.
So these are um
my recommendations
to the chair
and to the
committee
to uphold implement
and disseminate policies
to increase community and
provider awareness of
doulas to
eliminate friction and
resistance from clinical
providers.
Community birth support
providers have experienced
a lack of respect.
This friction and resistance
increases the potential
for positive patient
experiences and clinical
outcomes
to uphold implement and
disseminate policies that
continue to recognize
doulas as a professional
support
to a pregnant laboring patient
doulas should be counted as a
professional support
person, not
as a patient's visitor or
non-professional support
person with an
over overarching
policies
to uphold implement and
disseminate policies
that promote equitable
access to diverse birth
settings and
prenatal care in urban and
rural communities to decrease
preventable maternal
and fetal
death.
Equable funding. Um
Support to create
culturally congruent
perinatal home visiting
programs similar
to the CHW
program
and equitable equitable
funding support for community
organizations to expand
their reach to help decrease
severe morbidity and
maternal and infant
death.
So I think that
actually you'll the next
slide after
that is just basically our
partners. You'll see a list of our
partners.
Um I'm pretty sure I
missed a few but our
partners are both futures.
The New Mexico Foundation,
the A college
language Nest, Black
Health, New Mexico, New
Mexico Doula
Association,
Arizona Department of Health.
Indigenous Women, rising
Arizona birth workers of
color, New Mexico
breastfeeding task force,
baby, baby foods, Tewa
Woman United and build a
fire
fund.
And that is
the end of my presentation.
Um The other slides
will just show you like
sources um that I
pull some of the information
from because everything
that I have talked about
basically is research
back. Um You don't
see many resources
only because there's really
no um
research that has been done
within native A
ian communities within the
United States.
So I pulled
um some information
from uh I think it
was the black community from
Chicago because
they were experiencing similar
issues as the Navajo
nation um actually
indigenous communities
across the United
States. And then
you'll also see some references
to a research study that
was done up in
Canada with their indigenous
Dula.
And that's it for my
presentation.
>> Thank you, madam Cal. Well, you
have anything dad,
any comments you'd like to
make
>> the singer and her
coalition
for all of the work that they've
done. And
um
I, I'm just trying to
understand the panel because they're so
diverse. But
I'll, I'll let the
that in terms
of, of what we're doing.
But uh some of the work
that this
is
act and what are
some other opportunities for
now? Information
of diapers
very um energy
based like the state
of
>> and, and I don't think the
diversification of the panel is
because people
that aren't from here don't understand
the needs and what goes on in every
part of the area from Zuni,
right, who has dumped
a U and M school and trying to make
it successful and in a
small community trying to bring that
to, to the power,
power issues that we have
on the reservation to,
to the buring and, and the health
care on the on the reservation. So
I, I do have a few questions. I don't see
anybody else.
Um I mean,
get the names correct.
Uh Amanda,
right?
Yes. OK.
Um On
supporting this, this,
this
task that you're doing with the
birthing, right?
Last year we changed
it in, in house Bill
two or in early childhood
department. So you could build
Medicaid so you can
get funding for this. Are you
doing that? >> Um
The roll-out doesn't happen
until July
July 1st 2020 four.
>> Ok. Are you prepared to get the
Medicaid funds to
help?
Um >> Yes. Um The only
thing is that we are a part of
that group um that is
working on that right now
and um we're running
into some little hiccups
um and we need
to get some clarification
and we actually have a meeting
hopefully, um
within the next few weeks to get the
clarification from
New Mexico, Medicaid
and also New New Mexico
HSD.
And that's um just
resulting in the billing because the
last that we heard,
um, was that the
way they're gonna bill instead of just
having one streamline
of um, how we're gonna
bill is
basically, um, there's
what we heard and, you
know, anybody here can correct me
if I'm wrong
is that we might have to be
billing um
separately by
each MC
O.
And that's the other thing
that, that's another concern
is like extra work. Instead of having
one streamlined way of
billing is the
fact that we're gonna have to
um bill each of these
MC OS a little
differently and
using their platforms
and I guess their, their
software, their software.
>> Welcome to government will
me. >> Yeah,
exactly. >> The, the
other thing that I think is really important
is how do we tie these mothers
whether they choose this birthing
system or not to early childhood?
Right? Because we have so
much money for nutritional
care and prenatal
care and, and
pushing them into that system.
So then when that child is born, that
we can make sure that
they're getting the services and the
nutritionally good. We have so
much money I have over a billion dollars
in early childhood. And early
childhood secretary says, you
know, in Northwestern Mexico
or desert for early childhood.
Well, that's on her right.
So if we're gonna help her build
that structure, I mean, this
is probably something that I'd like to see
you add to your programming
is, is if you're
touching your home, visiting,
yeah, with mothers.
And even if they don't ch
choose a natural
birth that we get them
entered in the system somehow
and say, ok, well, we
want to make sure you're, you're eating the
right nutrition for before
you have the baby, you have the
quantity of food all
that we can provide as you guys
move forward and it just
makes it better for the child better
for the mother. And then
after the birth happens, we
make sure that they're, they have
everything they need, you know,
for postpartum depression
and, and moving those
kids through there and
then as they grow up or, or
getting those kids and they,
it it's a struggle. Sometimes
100 point I had to explain to
Charles is 45
million minutes from the Gallup
Hospital, right? If you're lucky
and 45 minutes from Fort
Defines. And,
and so it's really in the middle of
nowhere behind
a hill and,
and uh so you gotta understand
what's happening. So I
think the some of the things that we'll
probably we have our staff reach out
to you is, is connect
you with early childhood because
you may have a lot more
pregnant women. And we
know we don't have a birthing center in
Gallup at R MC H,
I'm not sure if Iihs
is operational in the, in the
birthing center, but we
need to help those parents
especially
where they are and, and to
get them services and to get them
correct nutrition, I think
is, is really important
and if they choose Bibbidi foods,
which is the native food
that, that they're allowed to get
that through the early child and, and,
and program because it's
people understand life is different
on the reservation. I mean,
I grew up in Gal, but I probably know
more, the more g
chase and more than a lot
of people and
they don't know what that is, but we're not
going to tell him
today,
but, uh, they don't understand
that. And so how we get the services
out to the people and
then I'll kind of move on to the solar. I
mean, it's good that you're
building a big platform for the
Navajo nation. But our
struggle in the
legislature is I,
I appropriate money
for power lines to go to
BCA or power lines to go
to Bale or to
Chila, right? And
the infrastructure problem that
arises is how do
we get you guys to
in capital
to appropriate money
and we know what
happens in, in small
houses, right? Something
happens but you place those solar
systems and we live
in, they live in clusters calls,
we we live in clusters, there
may be five or six houses
and hogans and in
separation. But if we can
build a cluster of power
inside that instead of
them running extension cords from one
house to the other, right?
Uh Actually powering those
houses with solar and then
figuring out how we
maintain that
in the future, you know, the battery
maintenance and, and, and all
that for them, but
that will save us so much time
and be able to power more
houses across
the reservation than
anything. And I think
that's something you should strongly work
on if, if we give
capital.
Um and let's
just use BACA for an example,
right? They're, they're
over the hill and between
Bluewater Lake and
continent divide wants
$10,000 to
run that line. I mean, we could buy
them a $5000
system and then put
a reserve in for maintenance
and, and power that house.
Right. I mean,
that's something I really like to see
you focus on because
we know we're not gonna get there
because of the easement time
and the long time to do
that and serving them
individually and that reduces
their cost.
If they don't have power, if
they have power, you could
back feed the meters,
right? That helps
reduce their cost to move along.
So I I really like to see, look at
the capital outlay process
because me and the council
delegate back there have long had
long studies, whether it's
roads or power
lines, you
know, we, we wait so long in
Kappe that we lose
it. And so if
we can get this process
moving in a different direction and,
and make the ease and
transition
in there that,
that it'll happen
for people because people
wait 10 years
or they go to their, their loaded
homes and
they move a mo mobile
home in and two A says we're
gonna get you power and water. Well,
five years later, they're still
waiting for power and water,
right? Even though
the, the water line may be at
the wall right there, nobody can
touch it and, and the power
is just there and it just becomes
an issue. And
so I I really like to see
expand that. I mean, sure
there's gonna be a cost in the overhead
that, that you're gonna need to make
for your investment and,
and that's additional cost, but
really serving the
people that need that power
and getting it out there,
you can go anywhere.
I mean, you may not
realize this but the city of
Gallup for us
and right between the
golf course
and UN M
and, and the, and Miam
Mia is a second piece of
reservation
and I live behind there,
outside the city limits,
we all pay double the rates
of what they charge people in the
city. So
the city pays 13
cents a kilowatt.
Those of us that are outside the
city limits, which they're
actually in the city boundary,
but they're outside the city limits
pay double.
That's a big difference,
especially as you seem
struggle, right? I mean,
every morning I go by there and
I stop some mornings and get a
burrito, right?
And, and it's just the struggle
to make that
that easier. So if we can reduce
their costs when they do that, I mean, that
would be very interesting because
the city would have to
accept the power from that little
cluster that lives there.
And so I appreciate
that as
for Zuni, you
know,
I wish you and I, I don't
really like U and M for a
lot of reasons that
kind of started it, right? Because they
just kind of dumped this and here's a
building and we're going to
pull out and, and you have no
chance of success rate
and to rebuild that
university and program
is, is, has been a
struggle.
You may not know it, but I kind of watch
out and
uh but I mean, I would
tell you, I mean, if we
could get a dual credit
institution
in, in, in Zuni, right?
The success rate in Zuni
and in the charter
school, uh
kids that were
the teacher of the year was from
there and talking to
some of those kids, they're so
advanced down there that they
could get those early
years of college and get more
success in
that
>> program. We have
39 students who
went through NTU and then
we also use the
New Mexico State
Online programs.
So we do, we do
have that as a
portion and then we'll
also have an
immersion um
school that we're working
on to have
built beside
our college and it
will serve as a lab school
so that our early childhood
teachers can
see how
immersion successful
immersion classes
can be taught.
So we're, we're in
those early
stages of the project
with our, with our school
there.
>> OK. And, and just let us
know how we can help. I mean, we
have so much money around,
there's so many services
that we can provide. But I
mean, sometimes it's just connecting
people and then figuring out how to
get that. But for
us, our investment in early
childhood is so big
that if we don't have
our native students and and
families participating,
um it it makes
it harder on them in life
and in participation in school.
This goes for Zooy too, right?
You are here for the
school participation
and it's dramatically
low. And so
if we can help to support
them in order to get them
ease the cost of food, so
they get to school or get
across the bridge to go to school
or that is very
important in how we
create this next generation
that that keeps us moving
forward. So,
Representative Ellison,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. Uh
My question is
directed at Navajo
Power Team.
Um
As I look at your folder
on the
founders, I
hope you have a team of
electrical engineers on board
with you.
And
I find this very interesting
because I'm a German. I'm
an electrician by trade.
And as
I look at your slide number
14
where there's an array
of uh solar
panels, you're
gonna produce 750
megawatts of
power on
4600
acres.
Ok. I
worked at the Navajo mine for
37.5
years
and six of the year
those years,
I was managing the coal
processing plant
which is right adjacent to
the power plant.
And Arizona
Public Service
produced
2200
megawatts of power
on less than 100
acres of
land
and yet we're gonna only produce
750 megawatts
on 4600
acres.
If you're gonna match the
7200 or
72
or the 7
2200
megawatts,
you would have to
need
more than five, the times
of uh 4,
4600
acres.
I kind of
uh I have a little
experience with installing
solar panels
when the Navajo mine was
expanding southward,
there was a few families that
did not want power
line. So
we negotiated with
them so that we could
expand our mine and
we install solar
panels
and all solar
panels, they have to feed
into a battery
storage.
I can just imagine
how many batteries you're
gonna need
for this 750
megawatt of of
solar field.
The problem that I have
is where are we
going to dispose
of the depleted
batteries? Have
we got a plan for that
on where to dispose of
them?
And then if
this uh
750 megawatt
solar
solar field
um
becomes a reality
what would happen
in a severe
hailstorm
that would shut down
your whole project. I
would think.
Do you have parts
readily available
to swap them out?
Because with solar
panels, the only
way to repair them
is to replace the
units. So
those are just my questions
quickly, Mr
Chair.
>> May I respond, Mr Chair?
>> Ok, >> thank you.
Thank you, representative. Those
are really important
points you make. Um I'd
also like to highlight the job
issue. It's not a one for
one as you know, with the
coal mining industry
and other industries to generate
power. Um There are
a lot more long term
jobs affiliated with that
type of energy production.
So we're always really
careful to be very
transparent that
yes, we'll probably have
about 200 or so
um line workers
putting up these, these
items in the short
term, but those are not going to be 200
jobs that will be permanent.
They're, they're, they're temporary
until the item is built
and then afterwards you maybe have
1015 or so long
term jobs. So that's something
that's really important that we're very transparent
about just because we, we have a solar
field doesn't mean there's gonna be a lot of jobs
affiliated with it. Um
The same thing about your point
about the, the acres that
it takes to generate
even a small amount
of energy versus in the
extractive industry. So
it's definitely not a one for one
total replacement. It's
more to look at how
can it be a part of the overall
energy solution.
Um I personally really think
that we have to have an all of the above
energy type of
solution because, you know, the sun
doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't
always blow. There are issues such
as hailstorms. We
do have a warehouse
in Flagstaff Arizona, which is
not too far from where the
site is in the
event that we would need to replace an
item. Luckily,
a lot of these panels have become
more resilient over time.
The same with the batteries as
well, smaller
batteries are becoming more efficient.
But for this size, we
will need a lot of batteries.
And the disposal methodology
also has to be very,
very stringent because of
the, the lithium and some of
the things that are in the batteries
for long term. So
all things that we have to really
consider and it has to be part of our
remediation
plan. So when we do leave the
site in 25
years, it
has to be returned to better
than existing
condition from when we built.
There's also water issues
that we have to contend with.
It is in a
abandoned uranium mine
site area. So
we have to monitor constantly
the amount of
radiation in the region.
We have to apply for 404
water permits with the Army
Corps of Engineers.
So there's there, it
seems like such a simple thing. Let's put
some pylons in the ground, put some solar
up, but there are so
many different things to
ensure that we're keeping
the health of the people, the
land, etcetera all in mind.
So I do appreciate your questions. Thank
you sir, >> Mr
Chair.
The solar panels
produce direct
current, only
direct current electricity,
the power plants produce
alternate current
electricity.
So you're gonna, I can just
imagine
the humongous
uh monsters
that are gonna act
as the rectifiers,
rectifying
your direct current to
alternate and current.
And then if
you're planning to feed
into the grid,
how is the direct current
going to feed into the grid
before the
rectification?
Uh direct current
usually has a
higher current for
footage? That's why
you see insulation
that are thicker than
the bear insulator.
So um I
think you might
have some problem
uh feeding
into a grid.
So that's
why I, I think you need to have
some really, really
topnotch um
electrical engineers on
board. I I see
some potential problems
that I don't think has been
really worked out.
Um I support
clean energy. Yes,
but I
still have that.
But
uh
that thought, what are we going to do
in these circumstances?
Should these not work?
Just my comments, Mr
Chair? Thank you,
>> sir.
I appreciate it very
much
boon.
Don't, don't be nervous. We
only ate the last five
people.
>> Thank you. Uh
Good morning, Mr, chair members
of the committee. My name is Felix
Chavez and I'm accompanied by
Austin Davidson. We are both
LFC analysts and
also accompanying us is Jeremy
Ferris. He's the executive
director of the State's Ethics
Commission. We're here to
present a brief on the opioid
settlement. If you could please
go to TAB N in your
binders should
look like
this.
I will begin with outlining what I'm
going to say. First of all, I'll be
starting out with giving you guys
context of the effects
of opioids in New Mexico.
Secondly, the opioid
lawsuit itself, the
resulting settlement and
the monies we currently have received
from the said settlement. And
finally, I will conclude my
part with the contingency
fees and payout structures
associated with the settlement
with that context.
In 20 21/1000
New Mexicans have died
of drug overdoses that
equates to three New Mexicans
per day with
the state searing nearly
200,000
residents living with substance
use disorders
to better visualize, visualize
this for you guys. If you could go to
page one and look at
the state map
titled county overdose
death rates
2021.
Uh tab
N
page one. The map
is basically a visual representation
showing that multiple counties in
New Mexico carry overdose
death rates many times
higher than the national rate
and the state's overall
overdose death rates are among the
worst in the nation.
In 2021.
Some counties in New Mexico have
had overdose death rates
exceed 80 deaths
per 100,000 in
population.
The overdose death rates in various
counties also increase
rapidly, mostly
driven by
fentaNYL.
I'm saying this because the national
opioid settlement represents one
of the biggest health
settlements ever.
And it's a historic opportunity
to address substance use
disorders and
potentially save the lives of
millions of New Mexicans.
With that, the case itself
beginning in 2017,
the then attorney general
entered the state into a series
of lawsuits against
pharmaceutical manufacturers,
distributors and
retailers for their roles
in exacerbating the opioid
crisis. As
a result of the settlement, the state
successfully settled these
entities generating
$884
million for remediation
for the opioid crisis.
With that to better visualize
this, if you could turn to page
two to the top left
chart titled Total
Opioid Settlement Revenue by
beneficiary. As
you can see in the bottom right corner
is the total I just mentioned.
And to break it down further. For you,
all, the state will
receive
$310.9
million.
Local governments will
receive
$324.5
million and
$249.4
million will go to outside
council in the form of
contingency fees
to date
to date. Local governments have
received at least
$108
million. In
addition to that, the state has
received at least
$90 million.
Most of the revenues have. Most
of the revenues of that 90 million
have been invested in the
opioid settlement
restricted fund which
will make annual distributions of
around $5 million
per year to the opioid
crisis recovery
fund. As you may have
noticed, I explained how much
we will be getting and how much we have
currently have received.
Those don't equate.
Why is that? It's
because of two reasons
high outside council
or contingency fees.
And secondly, some of the settlements
are structured to not pay
in a lump sum.
I'll begin with the first topic of
contingency fees
in 2019,
2 years. After filing the
initial complaint, the then
attorney, the then Attorney
General's office chose
to remove New Mexico
from the national settlement
between the entities,
Walmart
Walgreens,
CV S
Kroger and
Albertsons and from the other
states in that settlement
framework. Instead, the
office chose to contract
a private law firm to
pursue the suit
to better visualize this if
you could go if you could stay on page
two and direct your
attention to the bar
graph
labeled at the bottom is
the entities I just
mentioned as well as the
distributors. I will get to that here
in a second, but I
will begin, I will explain the
colors on the bars in
orange is the proportion
going to the state Consumer
fund in
gray is the proportion going
to local governments
and in yellow is a proportion
going to outside council
fees or contingency
fees. As you can
see, the proportion in yellow
is is quite significant,
quite large in this, especially
if you compare it to the bar for
the distributors. Why
am I mentioning their distributors?
It's because for the distributors
settlement, the
new Mexico decided to
remain in the national
settlement
framework.
Again, distributors before I move on
are entities that we don't
really hear much about that are part
of the opioid supply
chain
doing being that we did
not go that we did not pursue
a private framework for the
distributors. It resulted in a
payout structure that
differed from the outside council
structure.
I wanna, I wanna preface this,
that was saying that the
attorney general chose to
contract through a private firm
for this instead of a national
framework because it does allow
for a greater settlement value.
Of course, allowing for also
allowing for higher outside
council fees.
However, New Mexico
still ended up paying
higher rates than other
states that decided to pursue in a
similar fashion.
On page two, there are three
bullet points. If you please
review them, they, they
show, uh
uh they give contextualize
it a little more of how much the states
did pay out that decided to
pursue in a similar fashion.
But with that, I'll move on to my
second topic of
discussion
of the settlements.
Walgreens and
the distributors settlements
have structures that allow
opioid companies to make
payments for up to 20
years
to better visualize this
for you all. If you could please
turn to page three,
the local government section,
I will be discussing the two
tables you see on there
before I move on. These are
LFC estimates
I will begin with the table
on the right uh
labeled estimated
opioid settlement revenues to
local governments. I'll be
going left to right on
the left is the region of the local
government,
the percentage of the total
settlement they will each be
receiving the lump
sum amount they will be receiving.
This is the valuable amount
because this is the money that we have now
or we will receive soon.
Next to that is a calculated
average annual amount, the
less valuable amount because
we will see that down the line.
And then finally, the last column
is the total money we will
receive by the end of this
structured payment
to the left of that
is a table that
showed that is an estimate of
the specific payout timelines
for the four governments that we
listed there. I
want you all to pay special
attention to the mckinley County
because as you can see
the pot of money that will be
receiving is not
the biggest and this
value of money will be further
dwindled down because of the effects
of inflation because as you
know, the final
payment is in fiscal year 39
that is really much down
the line inflation will affect
these dollars.
But with that, I would like to
conclude that high outside
council fees have diminished
the pool of monies that we have received
from the settlements and the
structures behind the settlements
of paying out
years down. The line
allows for inflation to
further dwindle that pot of
money. With that.
I will move on to my
partner Austin Davidson to
further explain the rest of
the brief. Thank you for your
time. >> Thank you,
Felix chair
as a member of the committee. If you could turn to
page four, we're going to go
over the implementation
and coordination risks
that are associated with opioid
settlements to
start. New Mexico is
currently in a behavioral health
shortage. According to the
health and human services department,
only 18%
of the state's behavioral health
needs are met and an
additional 90 providers
are needed to end this
designation.
Further in
August 2023. LFC
report estimated the overall
lifetime costs of substance
use disorder in New Mexico
are $39
billion. As Felix
noted earlier in 2020
the Department of Health estimated
204,000
New Mexicans are living
with substance use
disorder.
New Mexico faces
systemic obstacles
that make addressing the harms of opioids
in communities. Challenging
only one third of substance
use disorder patients receive
treatment and lack of
data regarding behavioral health
services makes it very
difficult to identify
trends and treatment
practices that work
to address these barriers.
Stakeholders like the Behavioral
Health collaborative, the
Department of Health and others
should improve their collaboration
and co-ordination. New
Mexico risks duplicating
or under leveraging its
resources. Without this
coordination. Also on
page four, you'll see on the left hand
side, a case study
of the Walgreens opioid
settlement that was one of the national
settlements that we, that we left
to do private attorneys and it's
one of the largest amounts of
money attorney to
page four committee. We
go over the current state of
opioid settlement revenue
appropriations and then
possible ways the state can
maximize its settlement
dollars. Starting at
the beginning for,
for fy 24
the legislature appropriated
$21 million of
opioid settlement funds to immediate
damages. Funds
went to things like Medicaid assisted
treatment, behavioral health
initiatives and 12 million
of that went to enhance systems
designed to address consequences
of the opioid crisis.
In Fy 25 the
legislature continued a majority
of these appropriations. Roughly
$17.1
million. If you'll see on the
right hand side of that page,
it outlines the fy 24
appropriations and the Fy
25
below. You'll see that we're talking
about the maximizing of settlement
dollars impact. We did
research with the University
of Southern California's Schafer
opioid policy tool
and Information Center
and we got four major
insights. The first
is that while root causes of
opioid related deaths are
diverse, they share some
common themes like lack
of economic opportunity,
financial instability
and untreated mental health
issues to name a
few. Second,
the evidence suggests that no
single policy or program
can address the unique characteristics
of the opioid crisis in
communities. Practitioners
in collaboration with appropriators
should weigh the evidence of specific
programs and how they work
in specific communities.
Third studies
show that giving individuals
access to consistent
evidence-based treatment for
opioid use disorder and
keeping them in that
treatment are the most effective
ways to reduce opioid
related harms. And this
strategy can prove long term
rather inexpensive.
Lastly, what began
initially as an opioid crisis
has now ballooned into what's
considered a polysubstance
crisis. Policy
should be pursued that also influence
use and treatment of other
addictive substances
rather than narrowly considering
impacts only on opioid
outcomes. Turning
to the sixth page,
we go over the procurement practices
and specifically a November
2023 opinion by the
State Ethics Commission. I will leave
that to Executive Director Ferris
to go into more detail.
I will go into what other state
policies do in regards
to procurement code.
At least 22 states have
statutory guidance, limiting
contingency fee awards
with state agencies.
Many of the laws are based on
two separate ones. The
Private Attorney Retention
Sunshine Act called
Parsa and the
Transparency in Private Attorney
Contracting Act.
TPAC PARSA model laws
generally require legislative
oversight or approval
for contracts over a million
dollars and they prohibit
the state from paying fees of
more than $1000 per
hour when the total fee
recovered is divided by the number of
actual hours worked.
TPAC model laws
generally require an
attorney general to issue a
finding that contingency fee
agreements are in the best
interests of the state.
Further TPAC
model laws generally place
caps on the total fees
outside councils can receive
whether it is a percentage or
is a cumulative cap. A
good example of this is Kentucky
where contingency fees are capped
by the following schedule,
20% if the amount
is covered less than 10 million,
15% if the amount is
recovered between 10 and
$15 million if
you go to the bottom
5% if
the amount is greater than 20 million.
Now, if New Mexico had
similar laws like Kentucky,
we would have paid roughly $40
million in contingency fee
contracts, not
the 249 that we
paid that could have possibly
saved New Mexicans
$183
million. Now,
members of the committee, if you could turn back
to the first page, there's some key
points that I think we'd like to emphasize
before we turn it over to executive director,
Ferris New
Mexico received at least
$884 million
in opioid settlement revenue.
These were divided into local
government, state
consumer settlement fund and
outside council fees.
The outside council fees are
$249.4
million. These are going to be
fully paid out in six years
while New Mexicans will receive their
money. Over 15 and 20
years, New Mexico's
procurement code regulations
offer limited oversight
regarding outside council
contracts for these public
cases.
Additionally, substance use
disorder outcomes continue
to deteriorate in New Mexico.
And the funds gathered from
these opioid settlements need to
be targeted towards programs and
treatments that are tested
and work. I'll turn it over
to director
Ferris.
>> Ok. Thank you, Felix. Thank
you,
Mr Chair. It's pleasure to drive out to
Gallup. Thank you for inviting
me. I'm the Director
of the Ethics Commission at the Ethics
Commission. I think about the procurement
code a good bit.
But as some of, you know,
before the Ethics Commission, I was the
general counsel at DFA
where I thought a lot about
the state's fiscal structure.
And before that, I worked
for fancy law firms
where I
did some of this, you know,
convince clients
opt out of the class, come with
us, we'll file an opt
out suit. We'll get you more in terms
of recovery and
we, the lawyers will take more of the
fee. I want to
talk with you a little bit about
contingent
contingent fee
attorney contracts.
Um
It comes from a request for an
advisory opinion. We got about the
application of the procurement code. But
what I'm going to talk about is
broader than the application
of the procurement code.
All right, a contingent contingency
fee contract that those,
those are the billboard lawyers. You see,
it's almost how all the plaintiff spar
gets paid. We don't get
paid unless you win. That's,
that's the slogan. You
see,
normally the contingency
fee contracts
have language that creates a
charging lien which
allows the attorney
to after they deduct
costs to take their
fee out of the recovered fund.
If, if their client gets a
judgment and then remit
the balance of the recovered fund
to the client.
All right. So that's how
the plaintiff's bar, the opioids
bar. Um,
the, the opt-out class action
bar, the class action bar. That's
how, that's how they set
up the, the
contracts with
clients including
local public
agencies.
Um,
the thought and I think
the thought that the prior Attorney General's
office had and a lot of the state
agencies have had and
certainly the thought, the
background assumption of the, of the
attorneys that are coming for this
work
is
we get the fund, we
take ours first
and then the state gets,
gets its money.
And so, because
there's never really a transaction
from the state's money
to the attorneys because the
attorneys get it first.
A whole lot of law doesn't apply
including the procurement
code. That's,
that's the assumption that
I think a lot of the state
agencies, local public
bodies and the attorneys
have and it's
incorrect. Ok.
That's, that's the main, the main
thing I want to convey
that the claim
is the client's,
the judgment is the
client's. And so when that
recovered fund
is awarded and collected,
it's the client's first
before it's the attorney's
and for the state that has
significant consequences
because all public money
under the constitution
and under article
six, the, the public
financing laws, all
public money is paid into the
treasury and can
only be paid out of the Treasury
by legislative
authorization by appropriation.
That's the constitution.
So what that in effect means
is you have
a large degree of control
here in terms
of contingency
fee arrangements. It's
the client's money first. It's the
state's first
because it's the state's
first, a few
things.
One, it has to be
paid into the treasury
and can only be paid out of the
treasury by your
appropriations power.
That's, that's number one
because it's the state's money
first. If you, if we're going to pay the
attorneys from the state's money
that's an expenditure. That
means the procurement code applies.
That's, that's really the, the
kind of analysis and conclusion
of the State Ethics Commission's
advisory opinions on
this.
And,
and, and I
think the state, the legislature
has recognized that this
is kind of how it works
before with respect to
most state agencies
because with two
agencies,
you have created special
suspense funds in the
treasury and
authorized appropriations out
of those suspense funds to pay
lawyers for attorney fees contracts.
You've done that with the sic
and you've done that with the erb
I think at some point, the
legislature kind of realized
that, you know, it
has the power here to,
to control
appropriations to
pay attorneys in contingency
fee cases. Now,
the Attorney General's office
is separate, the Attorney General
is a constitutional officer
and different state Supreme Courts have
split on whether or not
their respective state. Attorneys
general can just sign
lawyers up on contingency fee
contracts and see them paid
without prior legislative
approval and authorization
that creates a kind of difficult
constitutional
issue.
And I think the way that you can
resolve that and exercise
some control here is if,
if you create a suspense
fund and a kind of statutory
framework for authorizing
contingency funds, even for
the Attorney General's office. So
this is something I think you could do across
state agencies including
the New Mexico Department of
Justice. I think it would
avoid a constitutional issue.
And I think if you kind of
look at what, what you've done with
respect to the erb and the
sic, that's kind of a
framework. And then from that
framework, you can begin
to impose
requirements that, that
inform the contracts
that, that attorneys
will come looking for
caps
certain requirements
about distribution,
you know, whatever, whatever you see
fit in terms of
policy.
This is extraordinary,
extraordinarily lucrative
for the plaintiff's attorneys.
Ok. The Walgreens
settlement that was
148 million
out the door to the plaintiff's
thirties. They got, they got a third
of the, of the state of
the state's money and
they got approximately a third across
of those the,
the suits that they
opted the state out of where
we didn't stay in the class,
the opt-out suits, they were getting a
third.
Ok. That was, that's,
that's Robo Rael Anaya, that's
Baron Budd. That's Luis
Palpa at the
Ethics Commission because we
were curious, we went
and looked at the campaign
contributions to the
Balderas to, to
attorney General Balderas from
those firms.
We think
that those firms
and the partners at those
firms and the family members of the
partners at those firms
gave Attorney General Balderas
about $65,000
in campaign contributions.
And Walgreens alone, those firms
got 100 and 48 million.
All right, it's extremely
lucrative. So if you come
in with a statutory framework
and impose caps and impose
requirements,
the, the plaintiff's bar is
still gonna come looking for the, the
business and they're
gonna still come offering
for the opt-out, we can
get you out of the class, we can
recover more from you. And that
may well be true and it was true
in opioids. It's true in a lot of
different kinds of litigation.
But the point is is
that if
you exert kind of legislative
control here, it's not going
to ward the plaintiff spar off
of, of recovering more
for the state under kind
of contingency fee contracts.
Ok. That's kind
of the
context. The
procurement code, the procurement
code applies to
awards of contingency
contracts for legal attorneys
because again, this is
expenditure of public
money
to, to pay
attorneys for their
services.
That's great.
The procurement code offers a
lot of of
benefits,
award of state contracts
by competitive
sealed process by fixed
evaluation criteria.
The the the
the folks that are seeking
contracts have to disclose their campaign
contributions. There
can't be contemporaneous employment
on both sides of the the
transaction. If the procurement code
applies, you just get a whole
lot of kind of
basic government
ethics protection
when the procurement code applies.
And the procurement code does apply
to the award of these kinds of
contracts.
And
it's, it's just something else I want to
mention because I know every
session there's pressure
from different industries like
the procurement code is so onerous,
can we get an exception to the
procurement code for this
kind of transaction or that kind of
transaction?
Every time you do that, every time
you cut out another exemption to
the procurement code, you
lose all that, you lose all that
protection, the competitive
seal process, the
ethical provisions.
And so that's also part of what I want to
communicate today. It's
just as you think about
exemptions to the procurement
code, think about what
the public's giving up in terms
of, of kind of ethical
protections.
And I know that's, I mean, that's, that's a
policy called transaction
by transaction industry by industry.
But you know, at the Ethics
Commission, we're here to advocate
for the procurement
code
and then last the
procurement code for
these contingency fee contracts.
It doesn't have to be that onerous on
state agencies. All right,
GSD, the Risk Management
division, they do a multiple
source award where they do one
RFP. They get all these
attorneys in to represent the state
in civil defense cases.
It doesn't have to be that hard
on the plaintiff's site. Either the
Attorney General's office can do a
multiple source award
one RFP. Bring
in a lot of attorneys for
a certain kind of area of
law and then when a particular
matter arises, they can just pick an
attorney off that list
like risk management does
on the defense side.
And so because The procurement
code includes
avenues for multiple source
awards. It's kind of like an
internal statewide price agreement
for a particular agency.
It's not that onerous. It's not as
onerous as, as,
as the
executive arm might,
might complain to you
about.
So that's it.
The main main takeaway
here is
that
you have legislative power
to control the
award of contingency fee
contracts because when
that money is recovered, the moment's
recovered, it's state
money, it should be paid into
the treasury. It should only
be paid out of the treasury based on
your appropriations power.
Thank you, Mr
Chair
>> all in just a little bit of
shock. But let me ask some
questions. Do you
think our ward
would have been just as
high without these attorneys
if we would have stayed inside
there? Is
that the average, I mean, or our
cost would have been
less?
We know our cost would have been less
because we see Florida was only
9%. We see the
other states are.
>> These gentlemen can probably speak
to the details Mr Chair,
but the when
you opt out,
you're going to pay the attorneys
more
on the promise that you're going to get
more in terms of recovery.
And that's normally the case
from my experience. But,
but these gentlemen probably know the details
better,
>> Mr Chair. I think one of the
important things is that the overall
amount that the states
settled was about
$4.5 billion
and that's spread out over a
lot of states now, in the
individual distributions
that wasn't in the encompassing
of our brief, but as, as
you mentioned, Florida only paid
9%. West
Virginia paid 15
and Nevada paid about
28%. And so I think
that those are the important numbers is
that while might have paid
less entirety, they
also paid less outside council
fees and they also had different payment
structures. That's one of the most
important takeaways is that New
Mexico is going to be getting
our money over 15
to 20 years. As Felix
noted on page three, the
disbursement of money really
mitigates the ability that the state
can work with it. I mean, mckinley County
is going to get
$8000.
So it's just, it's not,
it's different.
>> So then my next question
would be I, I don't
think this is the first one because I
have property and I did have
property on the, on
the, uh, animus when the Gold
King happened, the
same
attorneys were
used in the Gold King mine
settlement and they, so
they sent letters to
people along the river and
say, were you damaged?
Right. And
uh I'm smart enough to put in
there before I give
you my damages. What kind
of, how, how many,
how many cases like this have you
handled if you're gonna represent
me? Right? Because I can
see an outside attorney for
damages.
Well, the, I don't think they ever gave
anybody any damages on the
animus. They
individually,
I think they pushed it all in a
certain direction into the state
and the state could award him
for some
of the ditches got the
actual,
but I don't think this is the first one. I
think
there's others that are out there, right?
That I didn't have a choice
like the diss
or even the Navajo nation, I
think they may have pursued
individually on their own. But
the State
Department of Justice or Justice
League or whatever we're going to call them
today
said, you know, here's a but
when they fill out the questionnaire, my
question to them is how much,
how much water litigation
experience do you have to represent
me in damages and
never even got
a response. So, I
mean, so Jeremy, how
do, how do we, is
this total settlement gonna
come into the state
coffers
or are the, are
the, the attorneys gonna
take the
settlement going to pay them
out
and then send us the balance?
How is that gonna be happening?
Because if it comes in the
state coffers and I think we have
recourse,
>> I've reviewed the contract. I
don't know what's happened
as of right now. But the,
the, the contract that was framed
up between the,
the former attorney
General's
staff and
Baron and Bud
made it
clear that it was a
kind of traditional contingency
fee arrangement
where the firm was going to take theirs
first,
really just based
on what
the court awarded the,
the G's Office didn't kind of
assert any kind of
claim over
over the whole corpus of the money
first and allow
it to be paid into the treasury
and then, you
know, subject to your appropriations
power.
But Mr Chair, I don't
know as of today, what,
what money's been paid out on that
contract, >> but does
the Attorney General have that authority
to bind the legislature
to that
agreement?
And say I can independently?
I mean, he's an elected
official but can he
bind the legislature saying,
well, I could give him 50%
if I wanted right in the
settlement. Can they
bind legis can they bind
legislatures like that in settlement
agreements and
contingent fees? Not knowing
what the contingent could be
if we would have got a higher number
than the other states?
Might not be such an issue.
Right. But we didn't get a
higher number than the other
states,
maybe per capita. Did we get a
higher number than other states or
not?
>> The only state that got more than us
per capita was West Virginia?
But once again, they only paid, they
paid less than outside council fees
as well because they have
different laws that govern outside
council fees than we
do.
>> I mean, that's the question. Can
you bind the legislature
on a, on
a settlement that's
gonna happen anyway?
And
then
contract with an outside
attorney to,
>> well, mister chair, you're asking me
a question about contract
law
that I'm not too comfortable
answering right here on the record.
I will say
that
the,
the, you know, when parties,
when parties enter into
contracts, they, they,
they have reliance on the
language of the contract. And
so if we were to
get into, if the state were to
get into a dispute
with Baron Bud over the amount that they
have been paid now that, you
know, the contract has been signed
and awarded,
you know, they have, they'll have
reliance arguments
even if,
even if that money was supposed to be
paid into the state treasury first,
my, my comments were kind
of more perspective that,
you know, let's, let's think
about
a statutory
framework that looks like the
B and the si
to allow the legislature
to, to exert some control
kind of going forward because
opioids won't be the last
contingency fee
type arrangement where, where
attorneys are coming and asking for
the state's business.
>> This is not the first time this has
happened in the Attorney General's office.
That's my point. Right. I
think it's, it's happened
before.
And so, I mean, the
ultimate question, I guess we may have to
send it to you is
in settlement agreements that
are gonna happen
anyway,
can someone buy the
legislature to make a
payment or make a contract
payment
out of there
without the legislature's
approval.
>> I think
generally that the statutory
law is the background law, the
constitution and the statu statutory
law is the background law. And
yeah, that's, that's why
I'm urging you to, to, to
think about a statutory framework
across the state. Like, like
you've set up for, er, B and S
IC
Senator Rodriguez. >> Thank you.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman and good morning
or afternoon. I don't know what time it
is this afternoon,
both to Jeremy and, and
our staff. Um,
you know, now that this is brought
up about the authority
of the suspense fund. Thank you, Jeremy.
I think that's a great idea.
But, um, you
know, the thing that crossed my
mind here is that even if
we did not give explicit
authority to
the A G
to proceed with
this, uh in into
this lawsuit and so on
with the opioid settlement.
Um, we've been doing this
for several years already.
Um and
not only that, but there's something called
implied consent
by virtue of the fact that
we have continued to authorize
funding for additional
resources for the
A G to pursue
this settlement through
um, appropriations, for
example, for legal uh
for more legal fees
or more additional
costs, whatever are
incurred at the
A G's office.
Uh That is an quite
consent to me that
we knew all along that
for several years in a row,
they've been doing this and we continue
to fund, we never
stepped in and said, well,
we don't, we, you don't
have authority to do this. But
instead we continue to
facilitate
and have this
implied consent
information that I wording
that I came up with. Now,
I don't know how far that would
go as
far as, um, you know,
if we try to,
to do something about,
you know, getting the A G to say,
wait a minute, we never gave you the
authority. We, we're the appropriating
body because we know we are,
we've got the three branches of
government as we know, legislature
is the appropriating
body. And so
by virtue of our
actions as an
appropriating body,
um, it's
been approved pretty
much that they're doing
it in the way they're doing it.
And so I don't
know, but that's a very good point that
Senator Munoz brought
up is, you know,
can it be, can this is something
that can be questioned?
I don't to tell
the truth. I think at this point we're
pretty far into this.
Um, but I'll
leave it at that. And Mr Chairman,
thank you for your points. I think they were
good points.
Thank you, Chair
>> II, I see the future how
we can fix it. So I guess we're gonna
have to fix it at some point.
Right. So you
can, I don't know how,
how would that look if, I mean,
I know when the S IC and, er
B did that because in
09, 1011, I think
I carried a couple of those pills
right. To allow them to
use attorney fees to
recover, uh,
some of the funds
and it was a long road and,
and the costs were high
and they did recover some,
but I don't know if they recovered it. I've never
seen comparison recovery to
attorney's fees and what the costs
were. Right. Or if they're
percentage based or flat fees.
I kind of think, I remember there were
flat fees
based on time and
hours put into those
settlements.
Um, no,
but I think that's, that's just
one of the fixes we need to fix
in the legislature.
Um, >> we do
that. Thank you, Mr
Chair. I mean,
Senator Rodriguez, you
were, you'd be a great attorney
for the Attorney General at the
podium there at the Supreme
Court, making
the Attorney General's argument for
him's
retiring.
Uh,
I mean, the attorney general
does have implied
powers and like I said, different
state Supreme courts have gone different
directions on the power of
its respective legislature
versus its attorney general
to sign up
attorney fee, affirmative
litigation, contingency
fee contracts without
legislative approval. I
think most State Supreme courts
have held, you've got to have
some legislative
authorization
and,
you know, I can't speak for the Attorney
General's office, but I've spoken
with his staff about
this before and they've,
they've, they've raised the
idea of, of a legislative,
of a legislative fix and
I would just encourage, encourage
you to reach out to the attorney general on
that. I mean, I don't think
that this needs to be
particularly
contested. I
think, I think it's just in
everyone's interest that the rules be
clear and that a constitutional
issue be
clarified. And I think
you could do that by the creation of a
suspense fund and
authorization
where you appropriate out
of that suspense fund for
contingency fee
awards
>> if I may add just a little bit
to that. And that, I guess one
of the biggest lessons we've learned from
this whole thing is that
we're, we're
having our
distribution
distributed to
us over
15 years.
That's more than twice the
amount of years that we are
required to pay
out to
these outside
attorneys. But
yet, in other words, we're supposed to
pay out within six years,
200 almost 250 million,
249 and some,
and we're getting ourselves
310 million, I
think is what it is,
um, at the, of the amount
for the state anyway.
And out of the 854
million we're talking about. And
so, you know,
the, the
problem's gonna be for the
state to be able
to come up with that
additional, um,
amount, you know, I
mean, well, with the 250 million,
we know it's going to have to happen.
That's just the way it is. But
over 15 years we're going to
get the recovery for
the state, I guess is where I'm trying
to, to explain for
us, for having to pay
out that additional lump sum
of money all at once. Pretty
much for six years.
It's, I shouldn't say all at once.
It's over less than,
well, half the amount of time.
And so, um,
that's, that's a real big
lesson for the state to
learn. I mean, we're, we're
paying as much
as we're getting in, almost, we're
paying out, but in six years
and yet we're here getting
just a little bit of that every
year for 15 whole years.
So the value of that amount
of money is going to be of what we're
receiving is going to be lost.
You know, it's that opportunity
cost from getting it all at
once. So, you know what
I'm saying? >> I do, Mr Chair
Senator Rutgers. That's a great point.
I think that that could also be
addressed statutorily with,
you know, if, if the
state is going to pay out
a contingency fee
award to,
to a plaintiff's firm that, that
there has to be
some, it has to be
commensurate with the, the, the
damages recovered. And if,
if the, if the distribution to the
state is over a long, a long
tenure, then the, the payments to the
attorneys equally could be
on a long tenure. I mean, that's, I think
that's subject to your, your
your appropriations
power just well included
within it.
You know, another, another thing that comes to
mind is in a lot of these class
actions, the, the
local governments have claims
too and,
and the state's recovery and
the, the locals' recovery
could be coming from the same fund and
thus intention. And so another
thing to think about is whether or not,
you know, the attorneys
should be the attorney for both
the, the county government
and the, and the state when,
when the claims are, are intention.
I mean, that's, that's like
there, there are, there are latent conflicts
of interest that, that
arise in, in these kinds
of
large kind
of
distributed toward actions
where the, you know,
there's, there's
damages by local
governments at every
level, the state's
interests might not be exactly
aligned with, with the local's
interests. So that's, that's another
thing that, you know, could be addressed.
Statutorily,
>> we already, excuse me, we already
established a fund
for this opioid settlement
monies and we're spending out
the, the 5 million per
year supposedly
for the from this fund
from the returns that we're
getting. Um, that was like
a permanent fund we established.
But I guess, but yeah,
we established an
amount that we're
really binding future
legislators
to
distribute. As we're saying,
this fund is for this. This is how
much we know we're, we're gonna
get and this is how much
we're already planning to,
by virtue of the program
fund we established to distribute
the funds of 5 million. We're
already planning to distribute this.
We're counting on that money
and we're budgeting that money
for the years to come. But
yet it's future
legislatures, you know, those
are all, I guess things for consideration
as we continue
to discuss this, we
need to look at everything in this.
But anyway, so thank
you very much for that. I'll
stop
>> Mr Chair Representative Senator.
I think that's a really good point. I think
to emphasize that if you look at that
case study for the Walgreens,
you'll see that by the
time all the outside
council fees are paid.
New Mexico have only received
$46 million.
So $250
million downside council fees
specifically from the Walgreens
settlement, which was the largest,
only receive 46 and
that's also dispersed between
the state and then the local
side. And that's another key point
of this brief is trying to
combine the state amount
of money and the local amount of
money trying to organize
and coordinate together so we can target
specific ways because right now it's
dispersed in so many ways.
It really hurts the impact that it can
have. >> Mr Chairman.
In addition to that, the state
truly is getting about one third of
it because out of the 854
million, the rest goes to local
governments and attorneys
and everywhere else. And now we're getting is
310
you know, overall
that that's and, but yet
we're committing 100%
back of these
fees within
six years getting only
30% roughly on
this. Anyway, thank
you
an agency
bill
>> or is it gonna be an LFC bill?
That's Austin.
You waving your hands. Are you
surrendering or you saying?
Yes,
>> this will be an LFC Bill, Mr
Chair.
>> Oh, sure.
Senator Rodriguez will carry
it for
you.
No, thank you for the information. I, I
just, I mean, you,
you know how it is, it just
riddled with
fraud and agreements.
I mean, at the end of the
day, the problem is the opioid
epidemic is so bad.
Right? I mean, I, last
week I can't remember if it was the state
police or who was telling me
they had three people, they arrested
on fentaNYL
and they all went down,
they Narcan two
of them to get back and they were
working on the other one
and the lady that was there reached
a bra and, and took opioids
and went back down and,
and, and they're telling us they
don't want rest people on,
on fentaNYL at all because
they just die
the minute they arrest them and take them off.
They're just dying. So
representative for me,
>> thank you. Um
Quite sorry. I didn't catch the,
the, the entirety
of, of the presentation, but I've been
briefed on this Mr Mr
Chair and, and myself
and Representative Herndon ran
the, the bill for
um H
AFC two years
ago for the opioid settlement
um
funding that we, we
created um
the funding system we created through that
legislation. And I just
would like to ask how
and maybe this has been asked Mr Chair,
but with the funding
that we have with our local
governments,
um
how are we looking
to construct a way, a collaborative
way of working with them?
And do you see if this is something
you're talking about how we work with the
Behavioral Health collaborative
and all those agencies that are
taking um
taking AAA big
chunk of, of what
we've, we've
allocated from the fund
and
how are we collaborating with
those local governments and all the
money that they have? And do they
have the
infrastructure and
the workforce to commit
to spending
that money? And, and
what do you know about that? Mr
Chair,
>> Mr Chair representative? That's a really
good question. I'm
not the expert specifically
on the paper, health collaborative
or the Department of Health and their use
of the funds. I can certainly
follow up with Eric and Kelly
who have more of expertise in that
and I can certainly get back to you on a more
detailed breakdown of how
collaboration coordination can
improve our research is
just mainly knowing that right now
it's so dispersed,
but I don't know the specifics of why
it's so dispersed. >> Thank
you Mr Chair. I really do appreciate
that. Uh And one of the reasons why
I was gone is
because I was on a, a
Zoom conference
with my local government
in, in the county of Santa Fe and in their
Behavioral health task force
and talking about some of these
issues and and really
understanding what
it's going to, to take
for our state to work
with all of our agencies.
Um And from
the perspective of our
budget and, and the
needs like we
discussed yesterday, a billion
dollars we
spent in behavioral health um
funding how
much of that billion dollars
was came out of the opioid
settlement. Um
funds Mr
Chair
>> Mr Chair Representative. Another great
question. I don't know the specifics of
how much in that bill, but I can also
certainly get back to you with that.
>> That's something I'd like to know and see
how we're, how we're
spending that money to the
point of what
Senator Rodriguez is talking
about and, and the overall
percentage of what we're actually
allocating or using.
Um I love that we have
a sustainable fund for
this and I think
that that is uh is
very principled of us and,
and how we're going to grow
and um protect
our behavioral health
infrastructure.
Um But with that
said, I'd like to
see what the, how
and the collaborative
and how our local governments and,
and what they've been allocated
and how they are responding to
those needs.
And,
you know, right now we're in a, we're
positioned to
um
to give out more
money,
but where, where, how
are we going to do that efficiently? I think
is where I'm at. Thank you, Mr Chair. I
appreciate the
time
>> I'm filing on
491. How to
replace all my ramps.
I I told her
491 is a better
ride than Disneyland.
Has
it gets Me Carsick.
>> And I want to thank Jeremy and the
staff too, Mr Chairman
for presenting this. Thank
you for all your hard work. We really
appreciate you. Can you
try to make like swims
open for
the
what we
do?
But action items
we did them on. I can remember if
we had. Yeah,
I remember.
>> See that.
>> Yeah.
Mm >> my call.
