public employee retirement.
And madam chair looking to build
a treatment center but I have.
Secretary.
Yeah both of our state.
And right in the middle of.
The the.
And
the one of K. that madam chair
with stand for questions chair
members of the committee I was
more prepared just to provide
answers to your questions but
I'll do my best to stand in
presenter meals the current
often missile state police
office we found they're treated
differently in their Karia
retirement for the ranking
officers in particular of the
benefits that the law officers
are seen up to the rank of
captain are not seen by major
deputy chief for cheap so
officer there are after
June thirtieth twenty thirteen
of the currently within the para
and incorrect and correct me if
I'm wrong the twelve one point
two years towards a return for
every sort of and so currently
that law is not applied to
certain races I just mentioned
so the reach Casablanca captain
direct major that the chief and
chief you are see that has a
budget so there you to equity
problem.
And so this bill would set out
to correct that in two.
At thirty for the purpose of
throughout the ranks so again
one point two years for every
year served that everybody
enjoys of the recession
hardworking officers this bill
addresses that anyone who still.
Applies to years of work before
and after the effective date of
June sixteen twenty three as
long as the officers and retire.
and so that was sent.
Mr
of.
Mr chair.
This is a few words to
Mr chair
Representative.
If you have a add to that out of
the for your information madam
chairman members of great with
the R. eight I just for the
record the purported not take a
position on this bill of the one
thing I think it's important to
note is when when a member does
reach that certain range of
their contributions donate jobs
so it doesn't adjust for taking
the lesser benefits they're
still paying the same amount of
as if they were getting that and
so so there is no real impact
the funding that benefits of
just one point out madam chair.
There was questions.
Thank you Mr chair is there
anyone in the audience that is
supposed to just be one forty
five.
Anyone online close to.
Senate bill one forty five see
you anyone here in support
wishing to speak these.
Anybody else okay you may go
ahead.
Your.
There are are the
public some of you may know the
results also street is often
twenty years also also remember
was affected by this change is
very this changes that up long
in coming here we you have
officers we have to make a
decision that will forever
whether they're going to be at a
higher level an organization for
continue to get the same error
chairman of I don't think it's
fair and you know the.
Johnson was from October
decision very early as we're as
I work significantly longer
paying singer contributions and
so off I stand support
personally of of up of change.
Ask the committee.
This is anyone else in the
audience.
Recognized twice
you want to do this if we
promote.
Receive the same benefits
everyone else and so I see it as
recruitment tool to keep people
in the organization because if
they are willing to commit to
stay switched on call in the
organization before you so.
Thank you madam chair and thank
you Mr chair as soon well when
they're in a better salary and
that's the.
Motivation but what you're
suggesting madam chair is that
we have been heard caps.
Thanks then we have in our lower
ranks is that correct we have
more vacancies in the operation
in the lower.
I guess I guess the question
would be madam chair and
representative but I was looking
at it more as an incentive to
picking up but this brings their
retirement the end month of
retirement monies that there are
very few with the rest of the
people that are in thank you
for.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Mr chairman and secretary those
are my questions.
We have Representative office of
the Representative.
Yes Representative.
To madam chair I have the same
things are red flags are going
up
my colleague here because I have
committee has really worked our
Madam chair representative to
set of eyes them to stay.
I don't see how the state on
this because on page two.
Four nine eight.
That's right.
Yes Representative the members
of the to me reads.
April is actually please correct
wrong.
Because this is a retired
member.
The one retroactive.
For for for member that means
anybody who is currently
working.
On or before June thirtieth
twenty thirteen that means one
retro all back so somebody
retired we're twenty thirteen to
me as twenty years so that means
you're going back and
calculating all that back on the
twenty year versus twenty years
this is going to centralize and
they're going to get a raise is
to retire you can get
incentivized to actually need in
my opinion you're telling them
you've you said one point two
percent as as a when you mean.
Given the fact one more time for
the money numbers guy.
Miss madam chair representative
I think of the use that twenty
percent.
Area to assess the way the state
police plan under chair when we
have multiple tiers the way that
works is for each twelve months
that they serve in uniform they
get fourteen months of service.
So that's what that twenty
percent comes from so they don't
have the twenty year plan with
this ability of your police are
or of.
Fire misspelling they get
straight twenty you the state
police does as well as adults
correction and others the the
getting twenty five year
retirement they get that twenty
percent of up to five years of
that is.
The four years of.
Representative.
I'm sorry madam chair is a
dentist on that right.
So the work twenty years but
will get credit for twenty four
years and so many months for
Madam chair representative says
I believe the formula is twenty
years ten months important get
some to twenty five years of
credit with content so madam
chair for Representative.
And that's current right now do
so your time is that the the
higher ranking.
Individuals are getting that.
The hiring.
Rates of major deputy chief
which.
So.
Madam chair representative I'm I
think that the red flag went up
for me the fall almost
identically to what
Representative here might.
My friend here mention I don't
understand this.
This incentivizes someone to
stay because I mean.
I would like to retire and I say
you know what
as long as I I stayed through
June of.
Our four seasons.
This is on or before June
thirtieth was here is right.
Want to help students and I'm
actually.
law enforcement to the Max but
is your so your argument Madam
chair representative was that.
There's no incentive to move up
the chain of command so to my
understanding from start
sergeant goes to captain from
captain two lieutenants to the
fifty two to help me out here.
so officer sergeant lieutenant.
Captive yes major.
She then she okay if I.
I think the answer questions do
the operation.
Services currently the only
facts about that station right
to look at a very small
percentage of the legacy
messages that can measure
themselves and of course that
every not every.
People who are currently within
those ranks seven sentiment also
talk about are currently
eligible to retire personally I
see ten people we've if you were
concerned about that again being
some of these people being at
the front end of their
promotions first major or that
you need some of that sort or
what as as was mentioned comes
with the with increases salary I
agree to consider and all these
things I'm not so much and
that's and I'm sorry about the
stand here what I'm concerned
about is move forward into
the future I will people are
most of the people to feel the
centralized and to be considered
as this as much as rescue
organization to promote to the
hyraxes we need for people to
offices and trucks and I agree
with you Mr Madam chair
representative the the the thing
that I get is a dislocated
compasses.
I mean I don't know how much the
make but I'm you're saying that
from.
They don't they don't fall into
this of course this is actually
this maintenance majors over
there.
Senate majority on up so drop to
there's about ten people to
fall.
So currently in the all the
more.
Okay so.
I just I'm I have the only
because I think we should keep
our.
I think all not only for the
purpose of the building.
For me to be consistent.
I just.
I one Madam chair
representative.
Reduce plan to me how this is
gonna incentivize them to stay.
Okay I think I think I mean I
would imagine that there's
twenty two from captain to a
major you get a significant
raise for troops for Madam chair
representative.
Chair representative and that's
that's what I just mentioned
thank currently we have to ten
people of all from that space
that we're if not all of.
Are some of the recent motor.
Incentive for.
The state of.
Mentions that they just received
a recent salary so that to to
gain Act we have I was the lead
up to the rank of major.
She's she's.
And so.
So I mean I don't know as a
state Madam chair representative
not only his personal things but
the way that I read this is a it
is the way it's.
This
post and people are gonna want
to stay here.
Maybe give me a raise like that
manager for Mr chair.
You'll see and so
that that's my only real issue
that with only because I know Mr
chair representative that all on
Portsmouth this understaffed
right now that's really it's
nothing against any of you guys
this all try to do everything
they can to keep you guys what
you may so that's really my only
problem chair representative
good Mr chairman of the
securities.
Your concern however I I can't
see the people also to discuss
this again incentives.
You know I I was twenty years
and four years ten rounders
pria.
It is our side more often and I
said well that's a model for the
two ten twenty ten retirees.
The state twenty seven years and
I'm and I'm still here working a
lot of people with insurance
organization only seven people
officer before the committee
simply because we're given this
opportunity because they can
still based on promote they're
still working on a high three I
still see them having more offer
a seat in the.
To want to continue on I'm
concerned about the generation
coming up on the incentivizing
them wanted to make sure there's
equity for our pricing.
And I think you
Mr chair representative if that
was all it was you if you if you
change the date back and and a
little bit then I would be very
very supportive of this and I'm
not again and it's only for me
to to centralize people's state
is pursuing their emerging out
of officers on the phone right
and we're struggling to keep
also I mean that's really my
only statement I just
so my last question Mr chair
representative so do.
I don't.
Look at this so you're from what
I'm understanding officers and
sergeants already have that.
Mr.
We do except they were at a
higher price prior to twenty
thirteen there are twenty twenty
thirteen they don't have.
This creates parity between
officers please sorry can you
say that again this creates
parity between officers your
hair before twenty fifteen
going out of one percent after
twenty thirteen because we did
Senate bill twenty seven
percent.
Twenty seven we reset to one
point two so when we did that
officers are hired prior to that
date are not in parity with the
current high officers current so
if we bring them in parity with
all the other officers and the
funds are funded at thirty nine
percent there's no affect to the
fund just saying we're treating
this class officers hired Meyer
that may have been there longer
the same as officer higher.
So Mr chair representative like
I said I'm not trying to beat up
anybody and just might we've
just we've sat here.
What time of of of bills and
every single one has been to try
and the same thing maintain our
officers to stay because we were
so short handed and I can I can
perceive I can tell you.
Of good.
I was at one twenty close to my
twenty years of my twenty years
to this point right now just two
months away I'm gonna wait till
this fall all all all retirement
on the edges cut twenty percent
of us incentive to leave the way
I see it so but one point two.
It only gets worse you know they
start under current Mr Chairman
I'm sorry chairman Mr chair.
In the end and I'm trying to
finish up so if you are officer
in twenty ten and we did Senate
bill seventy two you've got no
Parities when we change that
builds one point two is a
multiplier and so you have to
have surgery twenty years or
twenty five years old there's
and serve longer but now a new
officer coming in.
It's one point two multiplier in
the fund is over funded by
thirty nine percent to thirty
nine percent fund over funding
so how fair is it to a senior
officer that would have many
years.
The new hire coming in we do
this all the time we see it in
in place agencies when new
people are coming in at a higher
rate the people that have been
there longer than solar trying
to say is we're not this is not
a recruitment or retention issue
this is how do we save you data
our state a good job.
In and we want to treat you just
equal because you've been paying
more and you don't receive
social security or any other
benefits the state police
officer how do we treat you just
as equal in the time frame that
you Sir prior to twenty thirteen
that's the big question that
we're trying to resolve here we
want to show some respect we
don't want to say is this all
deserve recruitment retention
are we benefiting more unit
twenty percent increase that
figure out the years they
surpassed city yeah I respect
your fears past service and so
the multiplier should equal
across the board blame it on me
for Senate bill seventy two for
not catching that but at some
point you go through the whole
if the fund was underfunded or
at seventy percent and eighty
percent but it's not it's a
hundred thirty nine percent and
then they don't receive social
security in any other benefit as
a go for and so that this
increases and equalizes what
type of that Mr chair
representative that answers the
question sure Senator I think I
mean I I think it's a good thing
I just want one thing was that I
can see how somebody you know
that's currently working.
This is people that are a
retired also you're helping them
I'm all for that they just
trying to recruit people hold on
to people what we've done this
committee that's the only
reason.
Thank you very much Here
Representative.
Jeff yeah I of Mr chair Senator
I think the question was just
answered but it's on page two
section the so everyone.
Those off with the fire on or
before June third two thousand
fifteen this would be applicable
to correct.
No.
Mr chairman members just just to
clear up that language Senator
twenty seven and we also talked
about that establish type of
tears a budget so so you have to
be employed or retired as of
June thirtieth twenty thirteen
to be a tier one member so this
will apply to only two one
members not not members that
have already retired he still
have to be active there's a new
to fix for members hired after
July one of twenty thirteen that
enhancement goes away for those
newer members so this is just
he's you know creating parity
within tier one for all members
within the state police we're
not gonna go back retroactively
enhanced benefits for members
that are no longer working and
has since retired they have to
be active.
At the same rates.
Thank you Mr chair.
Thank you Mr chair Senator
Munoz.
So I do look at this kind of as
a retention thing because I
would be treated fair.
No I want to stick around
secondly.
I guess I would have to agree
with what you said whenever I
was in and I knew I had my hair
out you know it's always nice
bill.
It yourself state twenty years
want to get to twenty years in
the like then I think the tax.
And before you know it you're in
twenty two T. and and you're
like man I think I'm going to go
on twenty five years so I guess
what my question is Mr chair
representative is how did this
bill comes out with is some of
your best and brightest got
together to same and some
something.
Mr chair representative of is
actually me again I I started
secretary and this is more
tension and there are several of
us state police was this is a
budget that's that only because
of this the case and faces faces
for the command officers and
they know it was very hard to
continuously lead their troops
and always before that that's my
job and it was a certain bring
this echo they were asking for
some of the smartest secretary
yes this is something for you
and and so we talk about is
reason I'm sitting up here
trying to convince use the that
feel as my responsibility is
knowing what the challenges are
for the organization I learned
about this I was really
surprised me know or other
organizations cars out the topic
command staff and the set by the
to to be that because at the end
of a it's a huge responsibility
to your station that we need for
the city of Rio Rancho
employment phone rang constant
in the day your support for the
organization just the right hand
after the chief and handling
everything for that organization
you are working your **** off
literally and you want.
You want the right person for
the job and so you know I feel
that if my jobs advocate for
that which is what I'm trying to
stay and hopefully discuss this
more for them I recognize that I
might be should you know my
these water to as a result and
and that's regrettable open us
up the case like I said most of
them eligible to retire is that
we're still working on our three
the state for the high three and
continue to work towards our
rights the end I'm also worried
about people are coming up on
I'm really worried about I want
to legislative organization and
environment where people feel
supported every.
Right and make sure they have
the same opportunities to be
successful and so that's why.
Thank you Mr chair Senator Munoz
so I appreciate to be an
advocate because
you know.
We're talking about the leaders
of the department we're talking
about the mentors of the
department and as you know if
you say you lose a couple well
in the state ideals to those
we've got some some people come
out thank saying thank you for
retiring because I need to shut
sure I know that I know that we
have to get to the point where
you know we're we're recruiting
more officers have a full staff
but

So Senator we were in the

Thank you madam chair I
appreciate your flexibility we
just walked off the Senate floor
I don't know where we are right

experts here.
We have to remember that the
committees of the good ask
question one of my then they'll

I can guarantee that.
Members of the committee.
But.
Representative most likely is
the promotion just looking for a
new class.
I think you're connected with
some yes ma'am.
Maybe you state already Mr chair
Senator is this I know how this
works New.
You're showing or through the.
How is needed because without
with that the about
And the one that we just care
about
Yes I yes soul so thank you Mr
chairman and vice chair and
representative thank
congratulations for registering
to draw in this beautiful so
short answer is we're trying to
bring parity Mr chair and
representative to the death
benefit for all of our first
responders so what we like to do
was bring the current page if
you will up by half a million
dollars so that the people pay
matter what sort of course
respond remark we said that we
would have two million dollars
to a fund that would be paid out
in the unfortunate circumstances
this will occur the money's
would not revert that we're
already scheduled to be paid
into the fund would be filled up
basically to two million dollars
a year so we are prepared.
That unfortunate parishes the
despair facilities that so
that's essentially what I hope
that answers your question but
it brings parity to how we
reimburse benefit death benefits
for first response.
Thank.
The I just have one question.
Less than we do crucially the
budget that we what did we do.
Thousand.
Thank you Mr chairman I'll have
to ask experts here with this is
the first time we've attempted
to do this or talk about.
Mr chair members of the
committee so.
Today.
If if the national guardsmen on
state active duty service to the
state were to pass away why do
you they receive no doubt that
the state next question to you
is that we do not have like the
law enforcement fire fire
forgiveness is about here's no
benefit to that so the state of
New Mexico face their premiums
who are through our general fund
for their S. G. O. Y. H. which
is five hundred thousand dollars
that we reduced for but there is
no death benefits and services.
I think.
Or my right.
Mr chair we we have so I believe
about three years ago in general
not was the actually general we
attempted this bill at a hundred
thousand dollars which was on to
bring a disparity with what
active duty death benefit is if
you got active duty you know as
as we have been working through
first responded parity and
budget we thought it would be
more inclined to bring with the
firefighters and law enforcement
officers in the instance of
state active duty so service
members state of because when
you when your password on active
duty their other benefits the
state cannot replicate
you education education funds
that that you'll surviving
children get access to that they
could not fix the were on staff.
So this million dollars is is
the probably the best way to
ensure that the family is he
excess something did happen to
offer the future so correct
myself Mr chairman I think you
caught that this is the first
time you try to break the parity
of the firefighters so that it's
it's all it's it's the the
attempt I made actually carried
before was simply of a hundred
thousand this Texas I.
Think question.
With thank you Mr chair
representative of Senator.
Making amended to this by no
means don't say like that why do
we not from all.
All first response.
Committee and military
everything together to where we
never leave anyone out volunteer
firefighters everybody why are
we running legislation.
And singling everybody up so
Mister chairman and
representative because they come
into their service through
various departments and it's all
different if you will but it
sounds like a great deal for you
and I to work on together now I
don't mean that spaces this is
sounds like a great over United
front work on for next year but
now we're gonna bring everything
up and then that would be a
great time for us to take a look
at this time it all together so
that when one changes for one
area of the cascades across
state government what we thought
let's come out of the various
members and anyone is realistic
has another important services
for state funding sources also
thank you Mr chair Senator.
The promise.
I'm a politician I went from
say.

this is is some additional
With rules that we want to

installation even those members

this bill allows for is when a
