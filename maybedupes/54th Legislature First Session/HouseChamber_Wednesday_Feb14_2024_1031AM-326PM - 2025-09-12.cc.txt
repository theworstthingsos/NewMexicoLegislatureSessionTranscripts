who have made our state a little
bit better by as coach Roy by
Roybal just did with his music

Mr Speaker. This institution is
is amazing. But before I go any
further if we could have the
clerk read the certificate.
Clerk to read.
The House of Representatives of
the State of New Mexico
recognizes Knw radio.
Whereas Knw is the noncommercial
radio station in Albuquerque
owned and operated by the
Albuquerque Public School
District.
And whereas K and W has been on
the air since October, 1950 is
the oldest FM radio station in
New Mexico.
And whereas Knw was founded to
provide educational classroom
back broadcasts for Albuquerque,
public School District students
And whereas over the years knw
has expanded its programming to
include national public radio
programs and unique local
programming.
And whereas K and W has featured
it's popular Saturday morning,
New Mexican music and
dedications program since 1973
showcasing locally produced
Spanish music performed by New
Mexico artists, And whereas
Michael Brasher has been the
general manager of K and W for
50 years, and whereas K and W is
the press is proud to provide a
venue for local programming.
And for new Mexico musicians who
would otherwise have no outlet
in New Mexico's largest media
market.
Now, therefore be it resolved by
the House of Representatives of
the state of New Mexico that
recognition be extended to knw
and the occasion of its 73rd
anniversary signed and sealed in
the capital city of Santa Fe.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mexico
Music is unique, wonderful and
much beloved in our state
without this particular radio
station. Many new Mexican
artists would not have a way to
showcase their music to the
entire state. But I will share
with you that not only do new
Mexicans in New Mexico listened
to
This wonderful music and to this
particular radio station, but
listeners throughout the world
and and I can tell you that
because as a volunteer, I will
take calls from Washington, D.
C. The state of Washington from
Portland from Hawaii that that
tells you members of the body.
How much this radio is a radio
station is appreciated
throughout the world. And, of
course by all new Mexicans in
general.
But I've got to share with you
that when I was in college,
which was an awful long time
ago, there was a particular time
that was called.
The disco music time. If you are
part of that, raise your hand.
Well, Michael Brasher started
something that was called Disco
89. And it was something that we
all look forward to. Because if
you wanted to listen to that
particular genre of music, there
was no other place because all
other stations at that time
while they're siloed today, they
were not siloed back then, and
they played everything. But if
you just wanted to hear
That particular music. You went
to 89 just like the Mexicans. Go
there now to listen to New
Mexico music and I've got a You
know, I've got to share with
you, Mr Speaker. That Michael
brush. I was reading this little

Excellence.
I also want to note that social
workers are employed both in the
public and private sector in our
schools at C Y F D and community
health centers, and many more,
um in many more areas. They also
work in the private in private
practice as well. I want to give
a special shout out to social
workers and, um, we, as we all
know, have a shortage of social
workers in the state and I would
encourage all of us to remember
that social work is one of the
areas of practice.

Speaker generated from early Oh,
Thank you, Mr Speaker. I too
want to welcome um former city
Councilor Lance in a who I
served with while I was on the
City Council Land is a
passionate young lady. That, um
Just you know her her
Our tenacity.
And her drive for issues helped
make Albuquerque and and our New
Mexico a better place to live,
and I really want to especially
one of the things that I learned
from her when I was serving on
City Council is more about the
Asian culture. She fought hard
to ensure that all languages um
we're, uh
Were put forward as part of our
city council agenda so that
people could, you know,
communicate at all levels, and I
just really appreciated that
very much land. So, our
counselor, thank you so much for
for what you did for the city of
Albuquerque generated from
Berlioz's present remarkable
Thank you, Mr Speaker and Mr
Speaker.
I rise on a point of personal
privilege.
What is the purpose of your
point? Thank you, Mr Speaker.
I want to first begin by
thanking you, Mr Speaker and
your office.
The majority office. My
colleagues
The sergeant at arms and the
chief clerk.
For your outstanding kindness,
care and accommodation of my
needs during this session.
I am deeply grateful to all of
you.
And on this special day I want
to thank the love of my life. My
husband
For never leaving my side.
And for loving and caring for
me.
Next.
I do want to express my sadness,
though.
And disappointment.
At the many obstacles that I as
a state representative have
faced now as a person with both
seen
And unseen disabilities.
My disability experiences began
here in the house.
In 2016.
When an 8 to £10 piece of
equipment fell on my right foot.
During our CPAC meeting
committee hearing.
Here in the chamber.
It was the sound that was heard
around the state.
Since it occurred while we were
live Webcast.
And I'm sure all my colleagues
including representative Ream
and Johnson, remember this
I received permanent damage to
my right foot.
For which I never received a
positive claims Recovery.
In 2020. I received another
injury.
By a door on the second floor,
slamming rapidly.
Injuring my left leg.
And resulting in permanent
damage to my left knee.
But the most compelling concern
to relate
About these experiences.
Is the grueling
Dehumanizing and disrespectful
processes I have had to endure
going through the incident
reporting and claims processes.
And subsequent lawsuit.
By the way, there is no incident
reporting procedure.
And the third party claims that
judge adjuster is expert at
delight, DeLay and denial
practices.
Thereby causing more undue pain
and hardship.
And I even had the attorney they
hired. Treat me grossly
disrespectfully.
And she even accused me of lying
about my 2020 injury.
What I learned, undergoing all
this pain and anguish.
Is that we as legislators?
Are not covered by workman's
comp because we're not
employees.
And we're not covered under the
general liability insurance
because we're not visitors.
It is unacceptable enough that
we remain the only state in the
union.
That does not pay our
legislators.
But there are no procedures and
processes in place.
To assist and comments
compensate.
For physical harm while
performing our public service.
Which is why we need to
modernize our processes to
ensure fairness, fair play
equity and justice for all.
I do want to take the time to
commend former Speaker Don trip.
And former chief clerk Denise
Ramona's
Who after my 2016 injury
We're attentive.
And constantly inquired about my
recovery.
And offered their assistance to
help. However, they could
Finally I want to relate.
That in my claims and subsequent
lawsuit
I found many accessibility
issues.
And potential violations of a D
a.
And then you Mexico Disability
Coalition conducted a survey of
this building.
Which has confirmed my personal
experiences observations
concerning the lack of access.
As such, Mr Speaker, I have
joined the lieutenant governor.
And the disability Coalition.
And others to work this interim
session.
To determine how we may bring
this facility.
A D, a fully compliant.
And fully accessible and
welcoming to all those seen with
seen and unseen disabilities.
Doing the minimum minimum just
to pass compliance reviews is
not enough.
We owe it to our public to go
beyond the minimum and provide
full accessibility.
I ask
That my colleagues remain kind.
And mindful.
To protect and advocate
For our persons with
disabilities.
Those that have disabilities
seen and unseen.
Thank you, Mr Speaker for
allowing me this point of
personal privilege. Thank you,
General Lady.
Gentlemen from Chavez.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. I
apologize. I was out of the
chamber a little bit ago. Uh, my
I know I've mentioned to you I
might have some guests.
Apparently, they are taking a
lunch break and but will be
coming to the gallery a little
bit later. I apologize for that.
But where is just let us know
when they're here? As long as
they bring lunch for everybody.
All right. Thank you, Mr
Speaker.
Any other announcements.
Gentlemen from curry, the buck
looked Roosevelt and San Miguel.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, everybody for a good
session.
I got sidetracked yesterday and
I didn't announce eastern New
Mexico University.
They had a package on your desk
yesterday morning.
And I'm just backtracking and
trying to fill that up. Thank
you for eastern New Mexico
University and what they do,
greyhounds. Thank you,
gentlemen.
Jelly from early. Oh, thank you,
Mr Speaker. I would also like to
welcome City Councilor Lansana.
She was the first Asian American
City councilor in Albuquerque
and she was one of the big
inspirations for me to run for
office. Really? Because I could
see someone that looked like me
and that looked like my
relatives in office and
governing and that had a huge
impact on me.
I'm really grateful for her deep
commitment to justice and to
joy.
In sickness and in health. She
has really made our state and my
home Albuquerque richer and more
thriving place and I know that
she will continue to do so. I'm
really grateful Also for her
friendship. Thank you, Mr
Speaker, Lady.

to that point record reflect
that all action has heard for
place in Senate Bill three as
twice amended on final passage
has been taken, and it is now
subject to debate amendment or
substitution. Too gentle aided
to explain the bill. Thank you,
Mr Speaker before I get to the
actual details of the bill, I'd
like to yield to my co sponsor.
Representative Little Linda
Serato to lay some context for
us if that's okay, Mr.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. Um
Today. We're talking about paid
family medical Leave, has Field
three as amended in the Senate
floor. And as we often talk
about a new Mexico we have
strong family values that bring
us together and that we all
highlight here today, and I know
that for all our friends across
the aisle on this one.
Right now. Our economy is
growing. We are have a better
unemployed, lower unemployment
rate than our neighbors and
Arizona, Texas or Nevada are
small business community is
growing faster than it has pre
pandemic and even into the
nineties, and we need more
workers to fill those roles but
part of the working roles that
are folks have is caring for our
families as we know, and that
takes a lot of folks out of the
workforce.
For myself. I know that when I
had my first daughter, it was a
handshake agreement that I would
get paid time off to take care
of her. And when that fell
through, we were still
economically secure enough so
that I could take some time off
with my daughter that
established breastfeeding that
established the opportunity for
bonding that I cherish. I will
cherish for the rest of my life.
When my second daughter that you
all know because I was pregnant
here just a couple of years ago
with her, Uh, that was
impossible, and I had a C
section at the same time. Mr
Speaker General, our house and
my team cobble together three
weeks of paid time off. That's
$5000. It cost my spawn
nonprofit to give me three weeks
off to care for my baby and I
went back to work. There is no
way I could ever recover what
was lost and not having that
time to bond with my daughter,
including loss of time to
breastfeeding.
Which now, according to the
American Academy of Pediatrics
should go on for at least two
years. At this point.
But my story is celebratory one.
I have two daughters out of
this. It's one of the greatest
gifts I get to carry.
But not everybody's story is so
joyful as a Muslim or guests and
those that we know go through
tragic scenarios with their
Children, Children that are
facing cancer treatments. Um,
they need their parents with
them to get the best results
they can get. And in a time that
we're looking at an opportunity
to invest in our families and
invest in lower aces, scores or
Um, adverse childhood of
scenarios.
In the time that we're trying to
decrease these, uh, situations
paid family medical leave is a
proven way to increase our
workforce get more women who are
part of that sandwich generation
to take care of their elders and
take care of their Children back
into the workforce. This is a
responsible policy that my
colleague will get into where
this is not just I have a
headache. I want to take some
paid family love.
When my mother took time off to
help me with my child, she
filled out a long form in which
he had explained on here how
long she'd be taking off why she
was leaving who I was to her and
in the back, always remember. It
has a list of all of the
different illnesses that are
possible and the kind of the
timelines that are tired of
that.
So, Mr Speaker, gentlemen, the
house I'm going to hand it over
to our other colleague briefly
to talk more about the Bill. Uh,
Patricia Caballero, Lady from
early. Oh, thank you, Mr
Speaker.
And
I am proud.
To stand today as a sponsor.
Of Senate Bill.
Three as twice amended.
I rise in strong support.
As I began this journey in 2019
when I introduced House Bill
213.
Then the paid family and medical
leave.
I joined
Sponsored main sponsor Chandler
and others that year.
And we were not successful
throughout the years.
Though our efforts have expanded
We have a broad coalition that
is working very, very hard has
been working very, very hard on
behalf of all of the
constituents in 2019. The
constituents brought this bill
to me.
And I was excited to introduce
this critical piece of
legislation because so many of
my constituents
We're facing what I too have
faced.
And that was many health, family
health issues and challenges.
As a single mother. I worked two
jobs.
And I dread it.
The day I or my son would be
ill.
Or we needed to go to a medical
appointment.
Because missing one hour of one
day.
Would set me behind on making my
rent payments.
Or my for buying food.
Or paying for gas to get to my
jobs in my district. I heard
loud and clear the many stories.
Of single parents facing what I
had faced.
And then I found out that not
only in my district, but every
single district
In the state of New Mexico.
Have countless stories to tell.
About the decisions that they're
faced with.
Whether to take time off.
To take a family member, a
child.
To an appointment or to care for
them while they're ill.
Or lose.
Time off at job on their job or
even lose their job entirely.
Later in my life, I was the
primary caregiver.
Of my parents, my elderly
parents and my elderly in laws.
I had to stop working full time.
And I had to work. Reduce my
hours to part time.
Which put a huge burden on our
family household income.
But it was necessary.
Because my husband and I were
the sole caregivers of both sets
of parents.
We were glad to do that.
We were happy to take the
sacrifices, however.
In that process. I also met
Countless other
What we refer to as sandwich
population.
Members who were caring for
their elderly parents.
I found
That this experience
Resemble the experience of
everyday life.
Of our families in New Mexico.
And for this reason
For all these reasons, and for
all the constituents around the
state of New Mexico and in my
district
I'm excited.
I'm honored, and I'm very happy.
To be a sponsor of Senate Bill
three as twice amended. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. To the
generator from Thomas. Thank you
very much, Mr Speaker. Um, I'd
like to talk in some detail
about the bill and it's history.
It's It's a complicated bill,
and it's long.
And in the course of my working
on it over the these years, it's
been clear to me that many
people either don't understand
it.
Or misunderstand it and
sometimes purposely
misunderstand it, So I think
it's important for us to talk
about what it really is what it
really does and what obligations
it imposes on employees and what
benefits it provides. So just a
little bit of background.
The paid family and medical
leave Act.
Creates a fund that will be
administered by the Department
of Workforce Solutions.
The fund will be financed
through employee and employer
contributions based on the pay
on the person's payrolls or
wages.
The fund will be financed
through as I said contributions,
Employees will pay $5 for every
$1000 earned and employee
employers will pay $4 for every
$1000 of wages.
And this is important employers
with fewer than five employees
would not contribute at all.
although their employees would
and those employees would be
eligible to draw benefits once
they meet the eligibility
requirements.
With this, um, section of the
law 66% of New Mexico employers.
Would not be paying in the fund,
but their employees would
receive the benefits in 2022.
The Senate passed the memorial.
Creating a workgroup task force
of stakeholders.
That task force.
Reviewed existing drafts of our
bill.
And provided recommendations.
Most of those recommendations
were incorporated into the bill
that you see before you now.
Additional amendments were made
during the 2023 legislative
session. Consulting with
stakeholders, including members
of the business community.
And throughout the past summer,
Mr Speaker.
We also continued our
conversations with large
businesses and small businesses.
Other stakeholders as well. An
additional changes in amendments
were made to the bill.
The bill has also been amended
Throughout this legislation. It
is session dress. Additional
requests made by stakeholders
and largely the business
community.
And those were incorporated in
the bill, as well as amendments
on the Senate side. Um, which
are the House sponsors were
intimately involved in
discussing with the Senate
sponsor.
It is a complex bill, so I will
briefly describe its sections.
Section three establishes the
fund.
And describes how the department
will administer it.
It includes the requirement that
the workforce solutions conduct
an actuarial study by January,
2025. I would note this is a
change incorporated this year
after talking with, um the New
Mexico Chamber of Commerce as
well as the Insurance
Association and other insurers.
Section three outlines the
formula to ensure solvency of
the fund. As I said an annual
solvency will, uh, will be done
beginning will be done, and it's
important that we ensure that
the fund remains solvent and you
will hear that Mr Speaker.
Throughout our conversation
about this bill, I think
The section three also places a
cap.
On
How how cap on premium
increases.
So that there cannot be a
increase annually of more than
0.1%.
Section four outlines the
process by which the department
will collect contributions from
employers and employees. As I
said, it's 0.4% for employers,
0.5% of wages for employees.
Section four notes that
proportion will not change.
Throughout, Um, the assessment
process.
And when changes to that it
should changes to the premium
occur.
Self employed individuals and
Tribes and pueblos can opt into
the program if they so choose.
Section four also allows
employers with substantially
similar plans that are being
provided now or in the future.
They may opt out after
application to the Workforce
Solutions Department.
Section five outlines the
process for applying for leave,
and I would note this too. We
changed most recently. Our
original bill provided for 12
Weeks for family Leave and
medical leave serious medical
conditions, Safe leave and other
Sorts of qualifying events.
Um, in talking with, um
Again. Stakeholders. We
Continued with 12 weeks for
family. We've we've created new
leave category called Family
Leave, and that leave is still
at 12 weeks. That's four to a
deal with a pregnancy or
adoption or fostering or the
death of a child that is younger
than 18 years of age.
But we created a second leave
category for medical leave and
safe leave, and that is at nine
weeks.
The nine weeks will stay in
place maximum of nine weeks. I
should point out all of these
are maximums, Mr Speaker, a
maximum of nine weeks until such
time after two years after two
years, we established solvency
to clarify nine weeks for these
other categories of leave.
In two years. There will be an
assessment on solvency at 140%,
And if solvency test is met, the
number of weeks will will rise
to 12 weeks for those
categories. If it doesn't we
will continue and actuarial
assessment every year until it
does, and at that point the
number of weeks
Can will be adjusted. There is
also, um, a cap on what wages
are eligible for the premium
assessment, and it's tied to the
social Security cap, which I
believe at this point is
$168,000 or so, Mr Speaker. It
changes I believe annually.
There is also a cap on the
weekly than the amount of
benefit that is paid out and at
the moment it's at $1046 if we
were looking at it today.
And that is based on the state's
median wage, and that changes
also every year.
I would note that
Minimum wage workers will get
100% wage replacement from the
fund if they qualify.
And individuals who earn more
than minimum wage. Mr Speaker
will receive two thirds of those
that amount, um, above the
minimum wage, and it is capped.
as I noted at the state's medium
medium wages.
Section six outlines the type of
verification that is required,
and I would note the application
is made to the Department of
Workforce Solutions not to the
employer. The the Workforce
Solutions is responsible for
evaluating the claim and
determining whether or not the
person qualifies. That is have
they been in the program long
enough, and I'll speak to that
in a minute and do they have a
qualifying condition and there
are there are
Examples of what types types of
verification are needed.
To qualify for the program and
employee
Has had to have paid into the to
the fund for at least six
months.
And in addition to qualified for
taking the leave from a
particular employer, so you are
employed with an employer, you
have had to have been with that
employer for also six months,
180 days.
Section seven.
Outlines the responsibility of
the employee. Excuse me.
Outlines the responsibility of
the employee to give notice to
the employer of 20 days if they
have a qualifying event or as
soon as possible.
I think we all recognizes their
recognize There are some medical
conditions and procedures for
which you you will know in
advance and there are others
that are emergencies and and you
cannot give the notice that I'm
sure we would all prefer to be
able to give
Section eight outlines the
requirements for notifying the
department.
Um, when the person returns to
work
Ah, Section nine prohibits
interference and retaliation
against the employee for
participating in the for taking
the leave.
There's a process for appealing
adverse decisions and that I
would note applies to both the
employee and the employee. They
have the right to challenge a
determination by the Department
of Workforce Solutions.
We'd also note that, um, at the
request of the business
community section 11 preempts
local governments for from
creating their own paid family
and medical leave rules for the
community, so this will take
precedence over any, um local,
uh,
Rules.
Section, 12 simply addresses the
existence of current collective
bargaining agreements and
acknowledges that those are
unaffected by the act. There's a
rule making process that's
outlined in sections 13 and 14.
And section 15 is a temporary
provisions that accounts for
repayment of the initial seed
money to start the program.
There is money in the budget to,
um
Pay for it in the amount of
about $36 million to to start
the program that will be paid
back by the fund over a period
of time. I think it's very
important
To, um
Go through this, Mr Speaker, as
I said, because
It's people really need to know
what this is all about, and to
summarize Mr Speaker.
This is
A program run by the state that
benefits employers and
employees.
Large employers can provide
plans like this.
Smaller employers have less of
an opportunity to do so. So you
know, it's my contention and
belief that this place is gives
is a benefit to small employers
because it makes them more
competitive to large employers,
and it gives their employees a
similar benefit plan.
That large employers can
provide. I also believe this is
advantageous, Mr Speaker to the
state because it will help us
draw in a workforce when they
see that we have benefit
programs that are advantageous
to them. And without Mr Speaker,
we stand for questions right?
There is debate. First lady from
Bernal, Europe presented Dixon
Thank you. Mr Speaker. Will the
gentle lady from uh Los Alamos
yield.
Uh, gentle lady from Burnley, a
yield. Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. I feel like this is a
slightly awkward position here.
So
Can I do my best? Um, so, Mr
Speaker and General Lady
Um, I have
Been following the
Changes in this bill. Um, for
for quite some time, Mr Speaker,
General lady, As you know, I sit
on the House Appropriations
Committee and so
You know, for the first several
weeks of the session, we were
very busy with House Bill two.
Um and so
I don't think Mr Speaker and
General lady that I had a whole
lot of time to really dive into
the details before we were able
to pass the budget out.
But Mr Speaker in general lady,
one of the things that I have
really appreciated over the last
several days is the
opportunities that I have had.
Two.
Spend time talking with
Business owners. Um
County officials.
Um and um, the secretary of
Workforce Solutions, Mr Speaker,
General Lady, Um and
I have been able to
Talk to the secretary in
particular to sort of go through
my questions and concerns, So I
want to acknowledge that and, um
Thank her. I know that Neither
of you were there for those,
but, um, your experts were very,
very helpful for me.
Um, Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
As I mentioned I am on the House
Appropriations Committee, and so
one of the
Questions that I have had and so
I'll pose. This question is
Are we creating a new social
program for the state of New
Mexico? Mr. Speaker, Um, General
Lady.
I'm not sure I would
characterize it as a social
program. I view it as a benefits
program that supports both the
employer and the employee by
allowing the employee to get
wage replacement that is not
provided directly by the
employer.
And the time that they need to
take either a pregnant pregnancy
leave or to address a medical
condition.
What we know is
When employees utilize these
programs, they are much more
likely to return to the
employer, so I view it as a
benefits program to support both
employees and employers. Mr
Speaker.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, General lady, Um and you
know, from the perspective of
looking at the budget, one of
the things that I see, um and
why I love the reports that are
legislative finance stuff
provide is, I do see this as a
recurring expense for the state
In terms of you know, I
recognize Mr Speaker generated
that the initial investment will
be recouped.
But long term there is an
expense for the
Employer contribution that the
state will be providing.
Mr Speaker, General Lady, is
that correct?
Mr Speaker General Aidid. Yes.
And just as it's an expense for
insurance programs and
disability programs and pension
programs, Mr Speaker, General
Lady
Thank you, Mr Speaker and
General Lady and
One of the
You know, I certainly, uh, value
Um
Benefits programs as you have,
as you have put it, because I do
think that there are many people
in this state that
The current structure is a
challenge and does not support
Um, are working families and
provide them with the needed
time to bond with the child,
which we know Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
Can be, uh
An enormous benefit to the
development of a child and a
healthy family. Um and Mr
Speaker, General Lady, I think
we all know the societal costs
that, um you know, we have to
pay one way or another. Um, if
we don't have those strong
bonds.
So I do believe that, um, making
sure that our workers and their
families have the supports they
need is important.
Mr Speaker, General Lady, um
From my perspective, though,
with the increased, um
Expense or liability to the
state, which you know, it's just
a fact of
Implementing any program. Um,
what I would like to point out
one of the most difficult
considerations for me in this
process.
Has been. How are we going to
have the long term revenue?
To support additional programs.
And Mr Speaker, General Lady.
I want to provide a little
context for how I am choosing to
make my decision. And so, Mr
Speaker, General Lady, I
appreciate your your patients
with me here.
Um, Mr Speaker, gentle lady as
the state incurs new costs. Um,
one of the things that I have
expressed concern about is that
our state is so heavily reliant
on oil and gas revenue, and Mr
Speaker, General Lady
I feel that our state is not
adequately diversifying. Um and
Mr Speaker, General lady our
state needs to adequately
diversify if we're going to be
able to support
Programs and benefits such as
these that are so important to
having healthy families. And so
I want to take this moment to
say that I feel that our
Legislature needs to do a better
job of supporting efforts to
diversify the economy because I
think Mr Speaker, General Lady
if we want to support our
families
In ways that we know are going
to be beneficial.
Mr Speaker, General Lady, we
need to have the revenues coming
in over the next decade to be
able to support those
So, Mr Speaker, gentle lady,
That is my
Philosophical concern.
That has been one of the most
difficult components for me to
wrap my head around.
Mr Speaker, General Lady. There
have also been some concerns
that a number of people have
been able to bring to me and
I've been able to get some
answers to and so I just want to
highlight a few of those, Um, Mr
Speaker, General Lady.
One of the concerns has been how
we work with employers that
have existing programs. And so
Mr Speaker, gentle lady, could
you just Could you talk a little
bit about what's currently in
the bill for waivers and opt
out?
Um yes, Mr Speaker, General
Mr Speaker, General lady. Thank
you for that question.
And it is in section G,
paragraph G and Section four.
Um
We have accounted for the fact
Mr Speaker in general Lady that
an employer, um, may waive out
or opt out of the program if
they have a plan that in our
language says adopted and
operates a paid family and
medical leave a plan or program
for the benefit of its employees
that provides leave and leave
compensation.
Substantially similar to or
greater than the leave and leave
compensation offered pursuant to
the paid Family and Medical
Leave Act. And Mr Speaker,
General Lady. This, of course,
is intended to accommodate
businesses who already have such
plans or choose to have a
private plan. Mr. Speaker
General continue has been a
request to remove coats of folks
need to remove their coats and
they're free to do so. Please go
ahead.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, General lady for that, Um,
I do have that section of the
bill brought up and I do
appreciate in the bill. The
attempt to work with our large
employers and any employer. In
fact, that has, um, program
already in place.
Um, Mr Speaker, gentle lady. I
did mention the F I r and how it
you know, lays out for the body,
the financial costs but one of
the things that I also found
helpful, um, and is something
that was reflected in many of
the conversations I had with
with folks is
In the F i R.
There's a There's some, uh,
comments that were provided by
the University of New Mexico.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady, and so
you know, for folks who may not
have read that it really, um
Highlights how tricky it can be
if you have a program.
And it may not be exactly
similar to what this bill is
proposing. Until Mr Speaker,
General Lady, one of the
concerns that I had is how do we
ensure that?
Through the rulemaking process
or in statute.
We provide enough flexibility.
That
We're working with employers.
So that they can have a program
that really works for their
employees and meets the goals
that are being set out in this
legislation.
So that's that's one item that I
wanted to flag. The
Next item, which is a part of
that is, um, Mr Speaker. Gentle
lady. There is I believe later
in the bill. Um, language that
says, um
That
Employers can't reduce
Benefits that they have already
established. Mr Speaker, gentle
lady. I believe that's on page
around page 23. Would you be
able to explain the reasoning
behind that, Um
A matter, Mr Speaker, gentle
lady.
Mr Speaker, General lady, I do
if you just give me a second to
find it.
It's in section 70. Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
And it, um it says leave taken
pursuant to this act shall not
result in a reduction of the
total amount of leave to which
the employee is otherwise
entitled pursuant to contract
policy, collective bargaining
agreement or other law or rule.
In excess of the amount of leave
actually taken.
So, Mr Speaker, General Lady,
the point of this provision, I
believe Mr Speaker in general
Lady.
Was was to prohibit an employer
from reducing benefits as a
result of the implementation of
this plan.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady, And I think
that's a very valuable concern
that the bill is trying to
address and the other side. One
of the
Pieces of feedback that I heard
from a number of different folks
is
In in past experience and moving
forward. How do we? You know if
if a company has
A
Really generous policy but may
not include all of the
components.
How are they going to be able to
balance the new requirements
with what they already offer?
And so, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, are Are these policies
just going to stack up? And so
it's just going to be an
untenable situation with leave,
and so
Um, Mr Speaker, General Lady
That's definitely an area that I
heard, Um, some concern from the
business community about
Um, Mr Speaker, General Lady,
the third area.
That I'd like to
Talk about briefly.
Um, is the role of our
Personal care providers.
Ah, um in
This state of New Mexico.
Mr Speaker, General Lady.
What are some of the types of
employers that are very
dependent on fixed?
Rate reimbursement or fixed
staffing ratios.
Uh,
Mr Speaker, General lady. Thank
you for that question.
This has been don't know. Kind
of a I guess I'd call it a lean,
ugly issue. Not sure if that's
the right word, but I think you
get my just, uh, certainly, uh,
we, as sponsors are very
conscious of the fact that there
are home care. I think they're
called personal care providers
and
Childcare providers and those,
especially those that are
attached to Medicaid
reimbursements because they have
contracts with the state. Often,
Mr Speaker, General Lady in the
concern has that has been
expressed, and I think it's you
know, it's a It's a fair issue.
Mr Speaker, General Lady is that
Um, will be increasing their
costs even by a little bit. And
that their margins are arguably
pretty small so that this could
impact on their their profits.
Or, um, revenues if it's a not
for profit, um, General lady,
and so we've been kind of
brainstorming about how we could
address that and and haven't
been able to other than to say
the following Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
This is a problem. That's a
global problem. It's not one
that is just arising out of the
result of this program that
we're proposing. Mr. Speaker,
General Lady, we I think I agree
that we should be paying these
providers more through our
Medicaid reimbursements. Or I
certainly support that going
forward. No question about it.
And I do think it is fair that
we find a mechanism or a way to
adjust contracts rapidly. Mr.
Speaker, General lady,
especially in the context of
Medicaid reimbursement, um so
that the provider doesn't feel
the impact of this small
increase in their expenses. Mr
Speaker, General Lady.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and
General lady, and I think that
it would be fair to say that the
state of New Mexico is not
always speedy in adjusting the
reimbursement rates, for which
many of these providers are
dependent.
Uh, agreed. Mr Speaker, General
Lady.
Thank you And I do want to note
Mr Speaker, General lady that
that I heard a number of issues.
You know, feedback concerns
things people really appreciated
about the bill. Whole range of
items were brought up in
conversations and so I, um,
really appreciate hearing
directly from constituents.
Small business owners in my
district, Um
People in different parts of the
state in the agriculture
industry, For instance, um and
having the opportunity to really
Sort of see a wide swath of
Concerns real life experience
and have a better understanding
of of how some of these issues
will impact. Um
People in the state, not just
workers, but business owners.
And so, Mr Speaker in general
lady, Um, while you know I'm not
in a position to sort of address
every issue that was that was
raised and brought to me. There
are three things that we've
We've spoken about Mr Speaker,
General lady that I did want to
Ensure that I felt strongly
needed to be changed in in the
bill before moving forward. And
so, Mr Speaker, general lady,
um, I do have an amendment that
I would like to propose at this
time.
Okay, Jin, Lady is the amendment
up here. Good. It's not up here.
you need get it signed and
somebody will bring it up to the
restroom.
And later we'll get this passed
Everybody have the amendment.
Okay, We've got the amendment
gentle lady to read the 2 to 8
number, please. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. The U 2 to 8 number is
0.228430 0.2 that that is what's
been passed out. Will you kindly
formally moved the amendment and
then explain it. Thank you. Mr
Speaker. I would like to move.
House Floor Amendment number
one.
Two Senate bill three as twice
amended, well, the gentle lady
to explain the amendment.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Um
And members of the body. This
amendment is
Designed to and as an attempt to
address three particular items.
Um, within this, bill, uh,
number one.
Um, we are inserting
Uh, this is a sort of an
exemption, temporary exemption
for personal care providers, and
it says that private employers
That are licensed by the early
childhood education and care
Department or if the private
employer derives 80% are more of
its gross annual revenue from
providing personal services
under Medicaid.
Uh or services to the early
childhood education and care
department or services.
Pursuant to the developmental
disability waiver program that
they are not required to play to
pay employer contributions until
January, 2029 and, um the reason
for that is to allow time for,
uh them to be incorporated into
an actuarial study and
Also, um
Medicaid reimbursement rates and
other
Rates to be adjusted.
The second item.
Mr Speaker is
Um
Broadening the
Definition of how Department of
Workforce solutions can
determine substantially similar
By removing the words leave and
leave compensation. Um, we're
allowing more flexibility for
DWS in the waiver, the opt out
waivers.
And then finally
Um, the third item addresses the
concern, uh, for the reduction
of benefits and allowing
employers to be able to, um,
balance what they currently
have with what they would then
be required to do. Um, and that
is by striking the word contract
or policy.
Um and so that provides the
Department of Workforce
Solutions with more flexibility
in that as well. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Very well. Let's go
back to the bill's sponsor is a
friendly amendment. Mr Speaker,
if I may yield to my colleague,
representative of the gentle
lady from Santa Fish from Santa
Fes is a friendly amendment. Mr
Speaker? Yes, And I if I may a
big reason, why is that this has
been an ongoing conversation
that we've been having.
Um, For many, I would say, plus
year Plus, I've been asking
folks, Mr Speaker, General Lady
for language on to make the
waiver language work. I think
this really assists in that
effort. Um, and I think that it
also ensures the workers and all
they've been doing allows worker
of businesses to change their
process. But in particular the
exempting Medicaid and those
that that serve our vulnerable
populations. You know again,
this gives us some time to look
at this program. This this
concern for this program, and it
also gives us time to look at
the
His concern for Medicaid
reimbursed companies and non
profits.
To be made whole. And so this
gives us that time to do that.
So, yes.
Okay. Is there a debate on the
amendment? Mr Speaker? Mr.
Speaker, We want to make sure we
have a roll call vote on this
amendment, please. Gotta Roco.
Um, first on my list the
generated from Katherine
Sierra's Valencia
representative Armstrong
Thank you. Mr Speaker does the
general lady yield
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yes, I
will yield to my colleague from
all of those counties. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. And thank you,
kind lady, Can you, um
Tell the body
What All entities are under.
And contracted with E. C. D. C.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady, um and
just for the body's knowledge, I
am, uh, utilizing the expert
services of, um
Our secretary of Department of
Workforce Solutions to assist me
in answering some of these
questions for, you know, full
transparency. Um So, um, the
providers for E C c D, Uh,
General Lady? Is that what you
were asking about? Yes, Mr
Speaker. I'd like to know what
all entities would fall under
this provider.
That Ah
That e C, d E what all falls
under that that would be
included in this amendment.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. So our
childcare providers as well as
our home visiting providers.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind,
Gentle lady, so not pre K.
Mr Speaker generally only if
they're private contractor.
Madam's Mr Speaker, General
Lady, so not a public school.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
lady. So no pre case under this
in public schools would be
eligible for this.
Uh, Mr Speaker, gentle lady,
that is correct.
Okay. Thank you, Mr Speaker,
Kind lady. And so how many
people are we? How many
employees are we talking about?
If you wrapped it all up in one
how many employees
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, General Lady for EC EC the
We are looking at approximately
10,000.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, Kind Lady
And how many employers are we
talking about?
Okay, Mr. Speaker, General Lady,
we are getting the answer to
that question. Um Ah. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. General Lady 1048.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
lady. And do you know the, um
How many total employee
employers are going to be
affected.
Bye.
The original bill.
And and you're you want to
exempt? Want that 1000? Plus, do
you know the difference in the
number?
Um
Mr Speaker Generally, I'm sorry.
So what's the total? Are we
still talking about? Just or the
entire
Um
Gamut in the amendment. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Thank you,
gentle lady. I'd like to know
the total number of employers
that are affected by the
original bill and how many
Total you're wanting to exempt.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, So there are about
150,000 employers. And so what?
we're talking about for this
exemption of
Of about 1000 is they would be
exempt from paying the employer
contribution.
The employees would still
receive the benefit.
And Mr Speaker. Kind Lady, do
the employees still have to pay
them? Sorry, Mr Speaker.
Generally, I apologize. Would
you repeat the question? Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Sure how many
and do the employees still have
to pay in and not the employer?
Uh, Mr Speaker, gentle lady with
this exemption that is correct.
The employee would still pay in.
Mr Speaker Kind lady. The
employee could not asked for
exemption like the employer, Mr
Speaker, Gentle lady, not
In this amendment.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, Kind
lady. And so what is the revenue
estimate that the employee not
the employer, but the employee
would be putting in
Ah, because Mr Speaker kind
lady.
There's 1000, plus employers
that will be exempt. How many
employees you said around
10,000. So what's the dollar
amount that we're trying to get
to by 2020?
Six or 2029. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Thank you, gentle lady.
Um, it is, uh, in this
amendment, it's 2029 And as the
sponsors mentioned earlier, the
actuarial study will need to be
completed by January of 2025.
And so this calculation should
this amendment be adopted?
The actuarial study would have
to include that information.
So, Mr Speaker, Kind lady, So
you don't have an estimated
number the dollar amount that
this would bring in and I
realize you're trying to make
the fund solvent by doing this.
And give time for all of these
people that we're talking about.
But what? What would you
estimate? The dollar amount
would be, Um, Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Thank you, gentle lady.
if you will hold on for just one
moment.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker and
General Lady. So just for the D
component, um if we remove the
employer
Contribution. We're looking at
approximately $2.4 million loss.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
lady. But it's not just the CDC.
It's there's several entities,
uh, named here so anyway, moving
on. So Mr Speaker, Kind Lady.
Would the employees still be
eligible to take the leave?
Mr Speaker, uh and gentle lady.
Yes.
So, Mr Speaker, Kind lady, so we
would be subsidizing the
employee orders.
That are paying in.
And other employees that are
paying in would be subsidizing.
All of these.
Employees that want to take
leave.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. Um, I mean,
there is currently an exemption
for businesses that have fewer
than five employees. But what I
would also argue, is that
The state's gonna be subsidizing
Either way in this in this
instance I mean, if we're
talking about increasing the
Medicaid rates and the
reimbursement rates, I'm not
disputing that. I think that we
need the time to make sure that
there's adequate funding for
that.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
lady, So it's actually not the
state. It's taxpayers of New
Mexico would be subsidizing that
and
We subsidize a lot. We're
already subsidizing free
childcare with D. C. We're
subsidizing a lot of things.
Through Medicaid, but no matter
what, Mr Speaker, general Lady
It's all taxpayer money, whether
it comes from the federal
government or the state, it's
all taxpayer money and
This tax increase. I cannot
support your amendment. Thank
you. Mr Speaker.
Debate on the amendment
degenerated from McKinley
Representative Lundstrom. Thank
you, Mr Speaker will the general
lady yield
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yes, I
will yield to the gentle lady
from McKinley County. Thank you.
Mr Speaker. I'd like to continue
on the theme of the number of
people in the amount of money,
Mr Speaker, General Lady that
your amendment is addressing and
I too am one that relies very
heavily on F I r s
I reviewed this one for this
bill, and I would like to ask
you regarding your amendment.
What is the uptake uptake rate
you're using for this industry
for this amendment.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker and
General Lady, so we used the
uptake numbers identified in all
three scenarios.
Mr Speaker. I'd like to
understand how that calculation
is formulated since each one of
them has a different number.
Hmm.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and
General Lady. The amount of lost
revenue does not change. Um,
based on the update rate, Mr
Speaker, General Lady, if I
could get you to look at the I.
R on page five
When you look Mr Speaker,
General Lady at leave takers. It
does change. So I'd like to know
Mr Speaker, General Lady, Which
one did you use?
Hmm.
Um
Mr Speaker and General Lady.
What changes is the amount of
expenses out of the fund. And so
we did. Look at all three of
those
Mr Speaker, General Lady, If you
look at the F I R on page five
and the low uptake scenario.
For, um 2027.
Is 48,359.
For the middle uptake scenario
at 70,056.
For the high uptake scenario.
It's 50 or Excuse me, 81,000.
So I'd like to know when you're
when you're proposing in this
amendment, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, What is the dollar amount
that will be
Missing.
Until 2029.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, General Lady, That is once
again why we need the actuarial
study.
To know the impact.
Mr Speaker, General Lady.
My question ties back to the
recommendation.
Ah of
Pay employer contributions until
January. 1 2029 if the private
employers license and so forth
in this amendment, so my
question goes back to what is
that amount?
Actually.
Become. I mean, if you're going
to delay this until 2029
And we're not sure which uptake
number we're using.
I'd like to have a sense of how
much this fund will be missing
in terms of dollars. Mr Speaker
in General lady, So for the
component, we do know the
numbers and that would be about
$2.4 Million for the other
components. We have not. We
don't have. We haven't had the
time to run that.
Mr Speaker, General lady, and
that would be my concern about
this amendment.
Um
There isn't a clear
understanding of
The amount that the fund would
be missing during that period of
time, because I'm not sure which
scenario is being used, and I'd
ask the body to reject this
amendment. Thank you. There is
for the debate. Gentlemen from
San Juan, representative Duncan.
Thank you, Mr Speaker will the
general lady yield
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. Yes,
I will yield to my colleague
from San Juan.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and gentle
lady.
This amendment picks, winners
and losers.
And the reason I say that
Um
I'm in an industry that I've got
a friend that has 600 beds. We
are facing the largest group of
people that are retiring.
In a long, long time.
In the next 30 years.
600 beds are all private pay.
400 employees.
You are now leaving him and his
group of employees.
To face this without the
protection. You're willing to
give others So let me ask you a
question. Does this amendment in
any way, shape or form?
Help him to get employees that
have the certificates that he's
going to need when this bill is
enacted, and this amendment is
enacted.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, gentlemen. Um
Request This amendment really
only deals with Medicaid
reimbursement. Um, so if it's
private, then it is not
included.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And
generally and that's my point.
We are picking winners and
losers in this right here, and I
don't think we should be doing
that. Um
Will this amendment help any
police stations or fire
departments with their
employees?
Um, Mr Speaker, gentlemen, uh
and gentlemen from San Juan, No.
Thank you. Well, this amendment
help any small mom and pop
With their employees and getting
people to come to work when
there's less than five
Mr Speaker and gentlemen, as I
mentioned in my introductory
remarks, this is a narrow
amendment designed to address
three of the issues that have
been brought forward. I making
no attempt to manage all of the
issues that people have brought
up.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and gentle
lady.
Um again. My fear is that we're
picking winners and losers here
and the assumption that we need
to pass this bill in order to
see how much it costs us. Our
irritate every citizen. The pays
taxes in this state. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. Thank you.
Gentlemen. There is for the
debate degenerate You from Dona
Ana Representative on the
amendment. Thank you. Mr
Speaker. Will the gentle lady
from Benaglio yield
Mr Speaker? Yes, I will yield
Mr Speaker, Gentle lady First. I
want to appreciate the
consideration for childcare
providers, Um, as we've had in
many conversations over many
years, these are the places that
we leave our little ones when we
go to work or go to school and
invest in that future for our
families. So first thank you, Mr
Speaker and gentle lady for that
consideration.
Mr Speaker and gentle lady in
your intro. And now in the
debate, I've heard you talk
about Medicaid but in reading
the amendment
The language of this amendment,
it says.
Um, someone that derives
organization in private employer
that drives 80% or more of its
gross annual revenue from
providing personal services
under Medicaid. I'm not familiar
with that term personal services
Might you share Mr Speaker?
Gentle lady. What? You intend
that to mean in this context.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, gentlemen. Gentle lady, um,
someone that derives
organization in private employer
that drives 80% or more of its
gross annual revenue from
providing personal services
under Medicaid. I'm not familiar
with that term personal services
Might you share Mr Speaker?
Gentle lady? What? You intend
that to mean in this context.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you gentlemen, gentle lady home
Healthcare and similar services.
Mr Speaker, Gentle lady. What
kind of similar services
Mr Speaker and gentle lady, Long
term care facilities would be
included in that.
Okay, Mr Speaker. Gentle lady I
am hearing that and appreciating
that. Um, but
For me. As far as I understand.
This is not a technical term,
and I'm wondering if it actually
accomplishes what you intend to
Mr Speaker and gentle lady. Did
you consult with the secretary
of the healthcare Authority,
your HST or whatever they may be
called on this exact day. Um,
thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, gentle lady, the Secretary
of Department of Workforce
Solutions assures me that they
have
Okay, Mr. Care, gentle lady. Um,
as I've looked through some
documents that I've
I have in front of me here
through the CMS website. So CMS,
the federal administration that
oversees the state Medicaid
programs, I cannot find the term
personal services. I do find
personal care services, and it
says personal care services are
provided to eligible
beneficiaries to help them stay
in their own homes and
communities.
Rather than live in
institutional settings, such as
nursing homes.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, gentle lady and the
distinction between the
terminology is intentional so
that it can be defined and roll.
So, Mr Speaker dentally just to
confirm that would be in the
rural workforce Solutions.
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. That is
correct, Mr Speaker, gentle
lady, if that's not the
interpretation of H s D, based
on CMS standards, the federal
standards or our own state
Medicaid program. What might
happen after that?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you gentle lady. Um so two
things number one, those
agencies would have input during
the rulemaking process and
number two
Department of Workforce
Solutions, but also have the
benefit of the information
obtained from the actuarial
study.
So, Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
We wouldn't be limiting
ourselves by passing an
amendment that clarifies its
personal services.
If
The agency doesn't have if the
other agency doesn't have the
authority to change how they
consider personal services
because this is based in federal
law.
Mr Speaker. Dental lady, Would
you please repeat the question
just to make sure we fully
understand it, Mr Speaker,
gentle lady, if if the as you
know, And I thank you for your
leadership on the health of the
Appropriations Committee in a
specifically for stewarding the
conversations as they relate to
health care coverage.
You know, Mr Speaker and gentle
lady that our state Medicaid
programs, um the foundation of
those come from the federal
government. And then of course
we go to waivers or we go, um,
potentially to ask for
permissions to do our own
innovative thing to improve
outcomes for New Mexico.
While I appreciate that the
department set to lead the paid
family Medical Leave Act is
going to go into rulemaking. I
can't imagine that they're
rulemaking would allow
Um, changes of another agency or
changes that regard to a federal
that come back to a federal
platform.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady. So what
I'm saying is, I appreciate the
intention of a bigger catch. But
my worry is that by naming in
law that this Medicaid
consideration would be for those
providing personal services if
personal services do not include
what you intend to catch.
That we've actually limited
them. And it won't matter What
rulemaking you all go into
because H s D has their own.
Definition based on federal law
and regulation of what personal
services maybe
Mr Speaker and gentle lady, Um
and so
The federal terms and their
definitions can be used in the
rulemaking process.
Okay, Mr Speaker, gentle lady. I
would remain concerned that we
are you all with this amendment
that I appreciate the intention
of have put in a term that is
more narrow than what you're
trying to capture.
So, lastly, Mr Speaker, gentle
lady, I really appreciated that
you named considerations for AG
workers, people that
Are the backbone of one of New
Mexico's biggest economies. Mr
Speaker, gentle lady.
I heard you name tag workers in
your intro. It does not appear
to me. The AG workers are
considered in this amendment.
Can you clarify your confirm how
that happened, or why they are
not. Um Thank you, Mr Speaker.
And thank you gentle lady. As I
mentioned, this is a very narrow
set of amendments. Um, one of
the reasons that I mentioned
agricultural workers and I think
that there are other workers and
considerations that need to be
addressed to
Um, so first they're not
included in this amendment. This
is a narrow amendment. But Mr
Speaker, gentle lady in the
conversations that I had, um
Directly with
The secretary in an attempt to
better understand rulemaking.
And have a better understanding
for myself of what needs to be
in statute and what can be done
in rule making.
I walked away.
From the conversations.
Feeling.
Um, reassured that through the
rulemaking process, the
Department of Workforce
Solutions would and can.
Spend time with a whole variety
of different types of employers,
because I think that it's
important that
When
When the rules are being set
forth.
The people making the rules have
spent time talking to
Farmers and ranchers are
manufacturers are fast food
operators, the dry cleaners high
wage employers in engineering
and a whole range of services
because each industry in each
employer is so different, and
you're right that I can't
account for that in this and
what is proposed here in this
amendment.
And once again, this amendment
is an attempt to address one
Portion. Um, but
As a as a legislator. I had
concerns about how do we ensure
that the concerns from different
sectors are heard and addressed.
And I certainly felt more
comfortable with, uh how the
rulemaking
Can happen.
Mr Speaker, gentlemen. Thank
you. I appreciate um, that you
all have, and will continue to
be in conversation with the
employers, including farmers and
ranchers that are my neighbors
and my constituents.
Mr Speaker. Gentlemen, I'll just
wrap with saying in this context
and with my concern, I'm
actually thinking about our farm
workers and specifically are
migrant farm workers and our
farm workers that come to this
country on HTA eight visas.
Mr Speaker. Gentlemen, I
represent a Big act district,
including New Mexico State
University in the Department of
AG and I live in our country and
we talked a lot about oil and
gas. But AG is a big big base of
New Mexico's economy.
And while we appreciate the
proceeds from that
Overwhelmingly. These are brown
people. These are indigenous
people. These are mexicanos in
this case.
That crossed the border.
And have to navigate racist
immigration policies.
Have to face touchback returns
because we don't want to those
people actually to become our
constituents.
We've decided federally that
they got to touch back, and
there's a lot of provisions
about how they move from
contract to contract. If they
don't have the next one secure.
They have to return to Mexico
before showing up again in the
US in our economies. So, Mr
Speaker, gentlemen, all wrapped
with that I was hoping to see an
AG consideration here because
from my understanding of how
these programs work
overwhelmingly
Again. These folks, these
migrant workers are the
backbones of a big part of our
economy. And that doesn't mean
they're only working New Mexico
because they are migrant
workers. They are seasonal short
seasons, and my worry is that
they will be paying in.
And never see the benefit from
this program. As, um, the the
law stands today, so I
appreciate you for naming this
in the intro. I wish I'd seen it
in the amendment as well. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Generally,
there is for debate on the
amendment. The gentlelady from
Sierra Zokora representative to
meet you.
Thank you. Mr Speaker does the
general lady yield
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. Yes, I
will yield
Thank you for bringing this
amendment forward. I I know I
had several conversations.
Three. In fact,
Um
Quick conversations about what
my concerns were with this, uh,
paid family Leave act and and I
do feel like
You heard what I said.
But probably not all that I
know.
Do you know when, uh, what
personal care services were
reimbursed in 2006?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. I do not so in
2006 personal care services were
reimbursed $22 an hour
Today. Personal care services
are reimbursed $18 an hour
During that time I remember
coming up.
To the legislature.
And saying This is the largest
growing body of people with our
aging population.
And they said at that time
For the good of all.
We need you to do this.
For the good of the all
I'm a mom.
I'm a Catholic mom and I felt
like it was my duty.
To represent the good of all.
And now we're at $17 an hour
reimbursement from the state.
I see in here that 20 by 2029.
Personal care services may be
made whole.
We're going to sacrifice for the
good of the all and we're going
to hope for a better outcome.
If when I heard, um, that
childcare facilities it's about
10,000 employees, 1000 or 10,000
employees and 11,000 employers.
Is that correct?
Mr Speaker.
Mr Speaker, Dental lady, That is
correct.
So when we look at personal care
services, Mr Speaker, General
Lady
I do. Mr Speaker. I do have the
numbers. If you would like me to
share Q. Mr Speaker. Thank you,
General lady. That would be
wonderful. I would certainly
appreciate that. So that's
34,000 employees.
And 18,000 employers.
In the realm within the realm of
the developmental disability
waiver program.
Do you know how many employees
and employers are there?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, Gentle lady. Would you
share that information?
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. Yes, I
will.
Those numbers are approximately
8000 employees.
And eight and
500 employers.
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. We're
looking at 54,000 employees.
And several 1000 employers.
And so when we look at that, can
you tell me Mr Speaker, gentle
lady. How can we make this
solvent with that number?
Of employers that we are
excluding.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. So using those
figures, the amount of lost
revenue would be approximately
12 million, which would still
leave over 370 million in
revenue.
Annually.
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. I
thought I heard 2 million
before.
Did I hear wrong? Mr Speaker and
gentle lady, that was the
employer portion.
Oh, I'm sorry for ec ec. D, Uh
so, Mr Speaker, gentle lady. So
when we are looking at the
global number of people excluded
Then, um, and the cost of what
that will be for this program.
Um
Could you remind me again of
that cost?
Um, Mr Speaker and General
Ladies. So the number um,
excluded from the small
business is 61,000 and that was
calculated in already to the LFC
analysis.
So, Mr Speaker, gentle lady, So
personal care services aren't
typically described as small
businesses.
Um Several of them have 500
employees or more.
Um
But in addition to that, Mr
Speaker, gentle lady when we
look at the definition of
personal services, I want to go
back to representative lot of
Cadenas concerned that it says
personal services under
Medicaid.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady. My
concern is is that we're going
to leave it to rule making
Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
And as somebody who has begged
for rulemaking before that makes
me incredibly nervous.
That, um
That the intent of this
May not move forward or that it
may not move forward in a timely
manner.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
There have been
Saman dates There have been some
Promised increases to the
developmental waiver program.
For almost 10 years.
During that time, many companies
have closed. I am a mother with
a child with disabilities.
Finding somebody to care for my
child.
When I cannot
Has been difficult.
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. Do you
know the average salary?
Of a person that cares for our
Children with disabilities is
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. Would
you share that information,
please?
Mr Speaker. Gentle Lady $13 an
hour.
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. Do you
know what my local McDonald's
pays an hour?
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady probably
depends on what municipality but
I mean, if you have a an average
amount, that would be great.
Mr Speaker. Gentle Lady $17 an
hour.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
I know that these companies are
reimbursed $17 an hour
Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
Some are quite quite honestly.
If my child has a severe
different disabilities and
behavior disorders.
My friends and colleagues and
Those people that support me.
They would rather work at
McDonald's.
Mr Speaker, Gentle lady. I am
all for
Sacrificing
And giving back
I believe in that.
I was raised that way.
But it's time now.
That we support those people who
support our Children.
And the care of our elderly.
And the care of our disabled.
And to make them a priority.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady, and if
I could
Just share a personal story.
About why I'm here. Mr Speaker,
gentle lady.
I'm here for this exact reason
This reason today, Mr Speaker,
Gentle lady in March.
11th 2020.
My community. Secura was the
first community who saw Covid.
Mr Speaker, General Lady. I
I was working on the donation
with my son providing healthcare
services.
When that happened, Chaos
ensued.
They closed the border of the
reservation.
There were no grocery stores.
No gas stations, no water.
And no way to get off or on.
Our local walmart. Mr. Speaker
General Lady was in sick or oh,
People started fighting over
baby formula.
Toilet paper and food.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
As many of you may know.
My adopted brother and sister
are from Alamo Navajo
Reservation. My brother was vice
president of Alamo Navajo.
And live there, and he called
and he said, We need help.
And they did, Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
And me as an owner of a personal
care.
Company. We went to help.
The majority of my employees are
my friends.
Family.
And the denomination. We lived
there for a year.
We bought
Water and food.
Past the gates that were closed
to us.
Mr Speaker, General Lady every
night I would drive out
And I would leave my brother.
And I would pray that he would
be okay.
And I would go home and I would
pray that I would not bring
Covid home.
I do not know. Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
What the rest of the world was
doing, but we were dying.
We were dying in numbers.
Unbelievable.
From the community of 3000.
We lost 70.
13
Of the same family an entire
generation, Mr Speaker, gentle
lady.
We lost our President, President
Mexicano.
Elected another one.
And lost him two months later.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady.
In the end less than a year
later, my Children will lose
their father on March True 13th
2021 In the very next day, I
would lose mine.
What me and my brother decided.
From that point is niceness
didn't get us anywhere.
Sacrificing for the good
Of the majority.
Did not help us.
We were dying because we needed
water.
Water.
It is time now.
When I look at this
And a colleague very well
meaning when I became so
emotional about this issue, said
It is for the good of the
majority that we must sacrifice.
I hear that I've sacrificed Then
I think of the good words.
Of my friend Harry Garcia.
He said. Leave no one behind.
Mr Speaker, General Lady I rise
today.
To leave No one behind.
I am a mother with two Children
in heaven and for Children on
this earth.
I birth them. I did not have
leave. I believe in paid family
leave.
I believe in that.
I believe I should have been
able to mourn my Children when I
buried them.
To the full extent.
Can't leave anybody behind
anymore. I simply won't The
United Nations motto is leave No
one behind.
And endeavor to reach
Furthest behind first.
And that's what we must do.
That's what we must strive for.
I believe in this bill. I don't
believe in this bill in this
form.
I would love to work with you on
that. So that we
Do not leave the furthest behind
first.
Thank you so much for hearing
me. I thank you for this
amendment, because I know that
you heard me and that means so
much to me.
But I can't leave anybody
behind.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. Generally on the amendment,
we still have debate next
quarter generated from Santa Fe
representative Luhan.
Thank you. Mr Speaker with the
general lady, please yield.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yes, I
will yield to the General lady.
Thank you.
Mr Speaker, I generally I want
to thank you for bringing this
amendment forward. I think that
This was something that was
really weighing on me in
The debates up.
Side of this chamber.
Which we are hearing now, um
The effects in the discussion
amongst it, and I just wanted I
had a lot more to say. But
Um, after listening to the
general lady.
From sick Auto
Mr. Mr Speaker. Thank you for
calling. I mean, I just, um
We're trying to do our best.
You're trying to do your best.
We're trying to figure this out.
Mr Speaker, General Lady and
Can you tell me?
Um
In your
Amendment here.
The provisions of the first
point
Of change here.
How this benefits those personal
services under Medicaid.
Who for providing services to
the early childhood education
and care Department, or
providing services pursuant to
any developmental disability
waiver program. Why this is so
important that we need to
include this amendment in this
bill.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. The reason
that I felt that it was
important to include this is
number one. I felt like having
it in statute meant that it is
not something that would be
forgotten and red. Uh, we would
Have to address and and number
two. I recognize that the
reimbursement rates and
statutory requirements for
staffing ratios make it very
difficult for these employers.
To make this leap.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, General
Lady.
It is in good effort, I believe,
and I'm glad that this is a
friendly amendment that you're
making here on this amendment,
so I fully support it.
Um
And having talk spoken with New
Mexico Association for home and
Hospice care and others.
Just in the recent days, because
I too like you House
appropriations, and we've just
been involved and and had our
heads deep in
Working with our budget.
And all aspects of that work and
what it entails. And to give the
full attention that bill like
this deserves Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
I feel like
And doing what's right.
The concept of this bill, you
are
You two are jumping into, say.
This. This needs some help.
And again. I want to thank you
on your point to on your
amendment, Mr Speaker, General
Lady.
Um, can you describe what would
that language change would mean
For this bill.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, gentle lady. Um, the
language change is designed to
allow Department of Workforce
Solutions to have more
flexibility as they're talking
with employers about the opt out
provision.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, So the so
Those those with work source
workforce solutions and
providing the that option.
Was it more that it was more
technical in the provision you
have here or was it more that
they now have the ability to
have those discussions? Was that
the issue with the bill? Mr
Speaker? General Lady. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Thank you,
gentle lady. My concern was with
the with with the way the
language.
With the way it is drafted.
Currently, I was concerned that
it was too narrow and would not
allow for employers that have a
Generous program that their
employees like and that works
for their employees. I was
concerned that as written, it
was too narrow to allow the
department DWS to work with
those employers. Thank you, Mr
Speaker, generally too.
In effect with this bill does is
it creates if you will, uh
The housing of
An age argument, Resources
Department or
Um
The work of what Human Resources
Department would do for all
these
Businesses and
And the needs that they will
have
In
Integrating this benefit is that
correct? And so this gives them
more flexibility to
To be that resource for all of
the businesses, Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
Mr Speaker, General lady. Um I
don't know that, um
They will become, um, sort of HR
advisors. What? What this
language in the amendment will
do is
Allow for
A better balance.
To be found.
With the new rules.
Uh, that we are asking
employers.
In this bill to undertake for
paid family leave. Um, and when
some of the employers may have a
very generous policy that
includes PTO and vacation, time
and other benefits that may not
be within the strict
definitions. Um
It allowed.
It makes it so that
At least in my mind.
We are being more accommodating
with our employers. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. Generally, I really
appreciate that. I think that's
very thoughtful. I think that's
insightful. As as I don't think
that we fully covered in this
bill. All those
Things that are required, Um
Through an eight. HR agency,
like the state has the state
personnel office.
Um, and they deal with the
entire all of our state
employees and from the them they
then
Then each agency then can have
an HR director or HR office
themselves to work. Then with
State personnel office, and
that's just our state government
with this bill.
Looks out or I think needs
further development is
understanding for me to
understand how
They're going to cover such a
huge array of all of our
workforce and businesses.
And develop.
Perhaps the same.
Um, excuse me, Mr Speaker,
generally, um, and develop that
type of system and I think
that's going That's something
that's going to need to be
developed.
And you've given some more
flexibility or some more
language in this. I think that
that is
That is something I hope that we
will be able to undertake. As
this process goes over the
reflection of two years as I
understand the time that they're
going to take to look in, Um
Figure things out, but I would I
would say again. Thank you for
that. And your 0.3.
Mr Speaker, General Lady on page
11.
Can you explain a bit about what
this language does?
Um, thank you, Um
Mr Speaker and General Lady, So
by striking, um
The leave and leave compensation
offered pursuant to, um
It is.
Allowing
Deaf. You know what is currently
offered and what is required not
to be an exact match.
Thank you. That's great. Thank
you, Mr Speaker, generally
again, another good point.
Um, and your last point contract
policy to strike line Foreign
page 23 contract policy and
insert in lieu thereof.
Can you just briefly explain
those language changes and what
it if it has a any major change
to the bill itself, Mr. Speaker
generally.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker and
gentle lady. Um, you know, as I
mentioned earlier, one of my
concerns was for employers like
our universities, you know, as
an example that have a generous
Ah benefits program that
includes PTO and holidays,
sabbaticals things like that.
But that may not be exactly the
same by
Allowing for them to
Re balance.
And that may include a reduction
of some of the benefits that
they provide.
Um, it
You know, we are making it
easier for employers and
employees to have a balance that
works for their business. Great.
Thank you. Good work. Mr
Speaker, generally.
And I know you did this on the
fly. So to speak on top of all
the work that you do as our, um,
vice chair of appropriations,
and so lending yourself to do
this and put this forward is
Is really important work, and I
appreciate that, and I commend
you for it and
Again on your first point. Mr
Speaker, General Lady. This will
then allow this This portion in
this change to be integrated in
the actual real study. Is that
correct? Mr Speaker generally.
Ah, Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Gentle lady. Yes, that is
correct. Great. Great work, Mr
Speaker. Generally, I appreciate
the time. Thank you.
There is a debate on the
amendment. The gentle lady from
Brenda Leo Sandoval,
representative Cates. Thank you.
Mr Speaker. Does the General
lady from Berna Leo Yield? Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Yes, I will
yield to the gentle lady from
Berna, Leo and Sandoval.
Thank you very much, Mr Speaker,
So I do first want to thank you
very much, You know, are
Community of childcare providers
personal care direct care
providers, individuals who are
providing services through the
waiver.
Have had a rough session and I'm
so very happy that, um they have
been heard.
And grateful for that.
Um, I do have some questions,
though first.
Some questions, so Medicaid was
first started in the United
States and you know the year
Mr Speaker, General Lady from
Bernie Leo.
Mr Speaker and General Lady. Um,
I
I suspect that you have that
answer If you don't mind sharing
it. Thank you. Mr Speaker and
General Lady has since 1965. So,
um, according to your amendment,
is your classifying these
childcare providers these
Medicaid providers? Um, uh,
Medicaid through through the EC.
I understand that education
Mr Speaker, General Lady in my
speaking incorrectly, Mr
Speaker, gentle lady, Um there's
an ore which I think is
critical. Um, so if the private
employers licensed by CCD or
derives 80% or more of its gross
annual revenue from providing
personal services under Medicaid
So it's an oar either or thank
you very much for that
clarification. Thank you, Mr
Speaker and General Lady, So
Medicaid is there is a service.
uh, required to provide for our
elderly and disabled through the
country, But each state, um is,
uh, required to offer those
types of services is that
correct?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. Yes, Mr
Speaker, General Lady, So by
distinguishing this carve out of
these businesses, these are
businesses that are not able to
adjust their rates if I asked
them to provide services for my
grandma, they can't decide to
charge me any amount of money if
I am going through the Medicaid
program is that correct? Mr
Speaker, General Lady from
Bernie Leo.
Hmm. Mr Speaker and General
Lady. So for the amendment, the
Medicaid uh
The folks that are being
discussed in this amendment. You
are correct that they cannot
arbitrarily change what they're
charging. They are dependent on
rates set by
The state.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, General. Ladies, So I think
that it is a clear distinction
that has been re missed in this
robust discussion of why, um,
this in specific employer, um,
is being identified and thank
you for the clarification.
Can you also let me know Mr
Speaker, General lady from
burning Leo is
The employee.
Are they required to pay into
the paid family and medical
leave? I see here. The exemption
from the employer is the
employee required.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. Gentle lady. Yes. This
amendment only deals with the
employer.
And Mr Speaker, General Lady
from Bernie Leo.
Are they paying? Like all the
other employees $4 in change, or
are they paying the full amount?
Are they paying their employer
amount as well? Mr Speaker,
General Lady.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady, so the
employees would be only playing
paying the employee amount.
Okay. Thank you. Mr Speaker and
General Lady. I am, uh
Very appreciative of all of my
colleagues debate on this
amendment, and I most certainly
am glad that we're discussing
the importance and the drastic
concerns we have for our direct
care providers that we, um ask
for help from our husbands in
wheelchairs and our grandmothers
who need help and our Children.
Um, who are on very tiny, more
margins that we have already
dictated to them by locking them
into state contracts with rates
And so I very much appreciate
this.
But Mr Speaker, General Lady, I
am concerned that we are, um
Balancing this on the backs of
our employees.
Mr Speaker, General Lady.
Mr Speaker, Um and in general
lady, and this is
I would say more question for
the bill as opposed to the
amendment, however, it's because
the benefit is portable for the
employee.
Yes, Mr Speaker, General lady,
but because we are creating
deficit from a lack of employer
pay in there is vulnerability
for raised premiums in the
future to offset that. Is that
true, Mr Speaker, General Lady.
Mr Speaker, Gentle lady. That
would be true.
Under any
Circumstance? Yes.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you, General lady. Um, I wanted
to ask you talked about how the,
uh some of these employees would
be exempt if they had a robust
Plan that could be access for
family medical Leave Mr Speaker,
General Lady, can you expand
upon that?
So, Mr Speaker, General Lady for
the amendment.
Um
What the amendment is doing is
providing Department of
Workforce Solutions by um,
expanding the language, making
it less restrictive.
Um
I believe this amendment allows
DWS and employers to have a
better balance if the employer
already has a program.
So thank you, Mr Speaker. And
thank you, General Lady from
Berna. Leo. I do appreciate
that. And I do hear this
sincerity of that intent. I'm
asking specifically. What is
that program? Mr Speaker,
General Lady, I have run
organizations and I have done
federal FMLA for my employees.
And yes, we offered vacation and
sick time and if they
Earned it. They hadn't been
taking time off then, and they
needed to access that so they
can be paid through paid family
medical leave We, whether
interim or at once, we always
made sure that that worked. We
want to be able to keep our
employer employs. Um, I am
asking with the required sick
time.
That is in, uh, companies banks
right now. Possible PTO possible
vacation time. Other sources.
Where is the threshold that
workforce solutions and tends
To accept as a robust plan for
an employer to be exempt.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady that has to be
done in rule and the you know
I think like many of my
colleagues
I am concerned about what is put
in statute and what is deferred
to rule making but my concern
and the reason for the amendment
is that I felt the statute was
too narrow.
And so the amendment is
providing more flexibility for
that rule making process.
Okay. Thank you very much, Mr
Speaker. And thank you, General
Lady from Burnley. Oh, there is
for it to be on the amendment
lady from Ben Ali, your
representative Matthews.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Um and
thank you. Um, General Lady, um,
for
Uh um.
Appreciating recognizing that s
B three has serious omissions in
the
Recognizing the incredible
diversity of employers and
workforce.
Situations and I appreciate your
effort in trying to address
that, um, in your amendment.
And I'm sorry, my my brother's
just texted me. They're watching
the Kansas City chief Victory
celebration because they're in
Missouri and 10. People were
shot and I'm sorry. That kind of
diverted me, lady. Um I'm sorry
about that. Is your your lady?
Continue? Thank you. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. Thank you, General
Lady.
Um
You have said at the beginning
of your testimony, General Lady
Mr Speaker, that, um
You had omitted certain
portions.
Um And I'm wondering if there
are any portions that we haven't
covered that you omitted in your
Proposed amendment.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, General Lady is the
question. Are there other things
in this in SB three as twice
amended that I think could be
addressed in other amendments.
Um, Madam Chair. I'm sorry,
mister.
Mr Speaker. We have a new Mr
Speaker. Um and General Lady.
I'm really asking you. Well, if
they're Yeah, sure. Tell us what
else is missing.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker.
Gentle lady. I think that there
are many things that could be
addressed by other amendments.
I'm not, you know.
I
We could go through a list. I'm
sure. Um, these are the three
things that I felt most strongly
about. Which is why Mr Speaker,
General Lady I have brought
forward this amendment to
Address them.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and gentle
lady. Um, is there Is there
anything else but specifically
relating to, um, Medicaid
providers, personal care
providers and so forth that you
haven't
Included that you wish you had.
Mr Speaker, gentle lady, Um
I think there is a fine line
between what we put in statute
and what we allow to occur in
rule making.
General Lady of Prime
interrupted If we could please
stick to the amendment, please.
Ah!
Mr Speaker. Thank you. I thought
I thought it was apologize If I,
uh
Diverged from the amendment. Um
Mr Speaker, General Lady, um
The
Organizations that provide the
kinds of services that are
described in the amendment.
Would you agree that they are
stakeholders in terms of the
paid Family Medical Leave act or
the proposed paid Family Medical
Leave Act.
Mr Speaker, General Lady? Yes.
And, uh,
Mr Speaker, General lady. Um,
I'm do you know why? Given that
these folks are still are these
organizations are stakeholders
that they were not part of the
task force that was
That helped develop SB three.
Mr Speaker, General Lady. That
is a wonderful question.
However, I am only presenting
the amendment that is before you
so I cannot speak to that. Okay,
um
Mr Speaker, General Eddie, would
it surprise you to know that
there were no Medicaid providers
that were part of the task
force. No childcare providers,
no healthcare providers that
were part of the task force.
Let's stand the amendment, okay?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. Mr. Speaker keeps
changing.
So, um
So how many
Give me Mr Speaker. Just a
moment. General lady to look at
my rough notes here.
Ah, Mr Speaker, General Lady in
your amendment. Can you tell me
why the providers who provide
services to under contract to
see why F D and the providers
that provide provide home
healthcare are not included in
your amendment.
Um, Mr Speaker generated. These
are the ones that, um I was
concerned about and addressed in
the amendment.
How Mr Speaker General 80. Were
you aware that, uh there are
contracts with providers, some
of which is paid by Medicaid and
some of which is funded through
other programs that involves the
Y F D and involve home
healthcare services.
Mr Speaker in general lady. That
may very well be the case and
I'm not surprised to learn that
there are other components that
could be addressed in other
amendments. Nothing in this is
saying that other
You know, Constituencies can't
be included, Um
So
They could be Mr Speaker,
General Lady, uh,
Have you thought about
withdrawing your amendment and
redoing it to pick up some of
the additional
Okay. Caregivers, fix some of
the language and so forth. Do
you think that's necessary? And
if so, why not? And if not, why
not?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. I think that
is a definitely a worthy
suggestion. However, I feel that
even so, as people have noted,
there are other avenues.
And other constituencies that
could be absorbed and included.
This is this is a starting
point, and I believe that it
moves in the right direction.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and
General Lady for that answer.
Um,
did, uh, workforce solutions
Help Prepare this amendment with
you.
Um, Mr Speaker, gentle lady, as
I was expressing my concerns in
the areas in which I was
unclear. I was in direct
communication with workforce
solutions, and the secretary was
aware of the items that I wished
to have included in my
amendment.
And Mr Mr Speaker, General lady
did, um
Workforce solutions suggest to
you that you had omitted any of
Medicaid providers or that the
description of personal
services, for example, is
incorrect.
Mr Speaker and General Lady, um
I brought specific
Concepts to them to the
secretary, So I don't know that
it would be fair to say that,
the secretary said. I was
omitting one or another.
And Mr Speaker, Madam. Uh um
There's uh to your knowledge
Does the Department of Workforce
Solutions provide any Medicaid
services itself?
My, uh, Mr Speaker Generating my
apology. Could you repeat that?
Yes. I'm sorry, Mr Speaker.
General Lady does Workforce
solutions provide any Medicaid
services itself.
Mr Speaker, General Lady? No.
Ah, Mr Speaker, General Lady,
Can you explain why in your
amendment
That's the paragraph one.
Um
Is required shall not be
required to pay employer
contributions until January. 1
2029 can you tell? Tell us? Why.
January 1 2029, which
Picked
Mr Speaker and General Lady, um
The two reasons as I previously
mentioned in debate, um that I
wanted
To have flexibility with his
number one the actuarial study,
so if this is included, it can
be a part of the actuarial study
and number two recognizing that
it takes time to adjust Medicaid
rates. Um and all of the other
components that we've talked
about.
Um
On that end, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, um
Do you know under the under, Um
SB three.
What happens on January 2020
January 1 2029 in terms of
Um
Mr Speaker and gentle lady, um
Could you refine your question
for me? I want to make sure that
I'm actually understanding. I
think that there's information
that I may be able to provide,
but I'm not exactly sure.
What it is that you're wanting
to know. Uh, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, I'm looking at your first
paragraph.
Which says
That a private employers should
be required to pay employees or
contributions until January. 1
2029 If and then it was the
various licensees and I'm
wondering.
Uh, why?
January. 1 2029 and what is
going to happen as of the date?
Why is it okay?
On January 2 2029 for your
amendment to no longer have
effect.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. As I said, the
two factors that I was concerned
about with regard to these
employers was the impact of
insolvency and other factors
that we would know after the
actuarial studies done January,
2025 and then also to allow
time.
From January. 2025 moving
forward to adjust reimbursement
rates.
I mean, I don't know that
there's anything magical about
the date. Mr Speaker, General
Lady. It was that date
accomplishes the two things that
I have mentioned. Thank you,
General Lady. Mr. Speaker. I'm
just the actuarial study is
supposed to happen in January.
2025 Correct, Mr Speaker. Gentle
lady. Yes.
And Mr Speaker, General Lady.
That would mean there would be a
basically a four year period of
time to accomplish the things
you've been discussing. Can you
tell me why it's going to take
that long?
Mr Speaker, General lady, Um, I
think that I'd rather have the
time to make it happen. Then, um
Say.
January 2026 that I mean,
My goal and
Identifying that date was to
make sure that there was time.
To support these businesses.
Madam Speaker. I'm sorry, Mr
Speaker, General lady, Um, are
you aware that many of these
organizations have never been
reimbursed for the cost of the
healthy workplace? Um
Ah, bill that was enacted two or
three years ago, and I'm and I'm
going to tie it to your
amendment, Which is? Is this
simply going to
Is it possible that under your
amendment, there's going to be
an even longer period of time in
which these folks aren't going
to be able to be reimbursed.
Um
Pending the actuarial study and
so forth.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady with regard to
whether or not
Some of the employers have been
reimbursed for the Healthy
workplaces Act. And I do believe
that that is something that you
and I discussed this morning. It
is, however, outside of the
scope of this amendment, um
Mr Speaker, General lady, Um and
then I forget what the other
part of the question was. Mr.
Speaker. Generally, I think you
answered my question. Thank you
very much.
Are you the debate on the
amendment related from
Bendinelli? Europe? Hartman be
healed. Thank you. Mr Speaker.
is that generally the in my
friend, also from Burnley will
yield
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. I will yield to the gentle
lady. Uh,
To my northwest. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Gentle lady. Firstly, I
want to applaud the sponsors of
this bill. I think that America
as one of the largest first
world countries in the world, um
Has been behind the eight ball
on the issue of paid family and
medical leave for decades, and
it is a huge issue.
And it is a challenging bill. No
doubt, Mr Speaker Gentlelady.
With regards to your amendment.
Firstly, many of the emails that
I receive from my constituents
Are directly related to the
Medicaid reimbursement issue and
why this is so problem, innit?
Problematic. So, Mr Speaker,
gentle lady, If you could
please, I think it would be
beneficial to the body and those
listening to us to briefly and
succinctly explain exactly what
the issue is and why these types
of Medicaid providers are
problematic as it relates to the
healthy work to the paid family
and medical Leave Act.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. Um
Employers. Different employers
have different profit margins
different abilities to absorb
new costs, new policies and in
particular, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, Um, providers that earn
most of their revenue from a
A set rate set Medicaid
reimbursement rate.
Or providers who are required to
meet certain staffing ratios
like pre K and early childhood.
Mr Speaker, General Lady, they
have less flexibility to make
changes, and they are more
dependent on
Action from the Legislature.
Thank you, Mr Speaker to the
lady. So, essentially, the
problem is these folks these
Medicaid dependent providers
have a much more onerous process
to change their reimbursement
rates from a program like
Medicaid so any impact on their
mark profit margin is, um, is
much more impactful than it
could be for a private business.
Is that correct?
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. Yes.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and gentle
lady, and I think that explains,
um some of the questions that we
had earlier about Why you chose
the days that you are the date
that you chose in 2029 as to
when your amendment would expire
Because, Mr Speaker, General
Lady, um, Medicaid reimbursement
rates are dependent upon action
by Medicaid director and in some
cases, the Legislature is that
also correct in Lady.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. Gentle lady. Yes.
So, Mr Speaker, General Lady,
the Hope is by 2029. We would
have taken action on
reimbursement rates so that we
could create a larger profit
margin to help these providers
absorb costs.
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. One
would hope yes.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, Gentle
lady, and like I said, this
issue my constituents were
really concerned about this. Um
it's really hard to run a
Medicaid dependent business. The
profit margins are quite thing.
Medicaid reimbursement rates
lead to a lot of the other
systemic issues we have in the
states such as medical medical
doctor medical provider.
Availability. Um, and other
resources of that type. So, Mr
Speaker, General Lady, I want to
go now to the inclusion of the
actuarial study. Is this just as
it relates to this subset of
providers or the actual
actuarial study for the whole
Bill. Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Thank you, gentle lady. Yes, The
actuarial study is related to
the bill.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, Gentle
lady. So essentially, what
you're saying is there will be
an actuarial study completed
before the bill goes into
effect.
Mr Speaker. Gentle lady. Yes.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, gentle
lady, and I think this is really
important to stress to the body.
I mean, there's been a lot of
concern expressed to me by by
many, including my constituents
that you know, we need to make
sure we have the resources to be
able to pay for such a large
program, which I do think would
be impactful. Too many many
lives. Minister, speaker gentle
lady and I think, uh And I thank
you for your amendment because I
think we've got to start
somewhere.
And the thing about lawmaking,
Mr Speaker, General Lady. It's
It's the art of the possible and
as we continue to discover other
subsets and other populations
that are more negatively
impacted by the paid family
Medical Leave Act, we will have
the flexibility and the ability
to identify these subsets of
populations and include them
within the purview of the bill.
As time goes by. So essentially,
Mr Speaker, John Lady, what
you're doing is you're buying
time while we're still trying to
implement this very large and
very difficult concept so that
we can essentially provide a
program to this state that works
for everybody, and so that we
can join the ranks of many other
countries in the world.
Who provide this type of leave
for their citizens as a
Just a benefit of being a part
of that society. So I thank you
for your amendment, Mr Speaker
to the lady. I will be
supporting it. There is further
debate on the amendment that you
know me from Colfax Mora really
was our Miguel in Towers
representative Sanchez. Mr.
Speaker does the general lady
yield
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yes, I
will yield to my northern Lee
neighbor.
Mr Speaker, General General
Lady. I think most of my
questions were answered. Um, I
know you mentioned
You got a lot of calls with
concerns from industry different
small businesses, a new
prioritized
Ah, few things to put in your
amendment, Mr Speaker.
General lady, can you? Can you
remind me who Some of those
other industries were that we
weren't able to fit in this
Thank you, Mr Speaker and
gentlemen, so
In my discussion with
Uh, the secretary, um
I specifically asked about
I think the following industries
and how their input would be,
um, taken into account in the
rulemaking process.
Hmm. And, um
Let me see if I can recreate
that list in my mind.
Since I don't believe I have it
printed out here. So, Mr
Speaker, General Lady, uh, based
on conversations with
constituents and also my
knowledge of different sectors
in the economy, Um, I asked if
the rulemaking process would
Um
Allow for some of these folks to
have an opportunity to weigh in
on how they operate and what
would work for them. So, Mr
Speaker, general, gentlemen.
Fast food restaurants.
Ah, manufacturers.
Retail.
Um
Agriculture. We talked about
that. Um, I also asked Mr
Speaker and gentlemen, if, um
representatives if there would
be discussions with some of our
large employers, like
municipalities and counties, if
I higher ed institutions would
also be included in that rule
making process.
Because I wanted to ensure that
As the rules were developed, Um
Various types of employers were
considered.
Mr Speaker, General lady. Uh,
Just a quick question Did the
nonprofit electrical co ops ever
speak to you about getting in on
your amendment? Uh, I know I
consider him an essential
service. They provide power to
hospital schools and such as
wondering if they spoke spoke to
you about this. Um, ender, Mr
Speaker, General Lady.
Uh, Mr Speaker and gentlemen,
you know, it is entirely
possible that I've had
conversations with the Rural
Electric Co ops. However, I
don't believe that I've had
specific conversations with them
about this bill or the
amendment. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. General Lady, I guess
what I'm going to get at is a
I know. I appreciate you trying
to help us a few of the people
there's you mentioned yourself
that that amendment would
probably be a crazy thick if you
addressed everyone's concerns,
and that's my problem with
I guess this amendment Mr
Speaker. It doesn't help
everyone, Um
The bill itself, and I'm not
speaking on the bill. But I'm
saying I wish I saw more on your
amendment and you yourself
mentioned Mr Speaker, General
Lady that it did address more.
And I think that's that's the
big problem here. We all know
small business owners. They're
our friends, Our neighbors. Uh
A lot of them. Don't pay
attention to what we do here in
the Legislature, and I'd hate to
be near those people when they
find out this is implemented.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, Mr.
Speaker and gentlemen, and one
of the reasons that I
specifically asked about the
role making is because some
things can be done in statute
and some can be done in roll.
Thank you.
Right. There is further debate
on the amendment Gentleman from
Dona Ana Representative Small.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Mr.
Speaker with the general lady
from Berlin. Leo Young. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Thank you. Yes,
I will yield to the gentleman
from Dona Ana. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Thank you, General
Lady, Mr Speaker, General Lady
first, uh, is it your
understanding as it is mine that
within
Some of these personal services
and CCD, particularly, uh,
professions that are supported
by Medicaid. Those are some of
the hardest to recruit sometimes
for workforce. And have we heard
some of that today during
debate, Mr Speaker, General
Lady Mr Speaker, Gentlemen. Yes,
Speaker. Gentlemen. General
Lady, That's my understanding as
well.
I appreciate your amendment, Mr
Speaker, General lady because it
allows the employees in these
critical industries to receive
benefits. But Mr Speaker,
General Lady it also as we've
talked about gives runway for us
as a state to better support the
employers to do more recruitment
retention.
Enhancing our reimbursement
rates, which we've been doing
for the last few years. Right,
Mr Speaker, General Lady.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen. Yes, that is
correct.
So, Mr Speaker, General Lady,
would it be a fair expectation
that as we adopt your amendment,
and as we go forward and adopt
this piece of legislation that
will actually have an enhanced
ability to recruit workers into
these important fields that are
supported by Medicaid, Mr
Speaker, General Lady
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. Gentlemen. I do think that
is certainly a possibility.
Absolutely, General lady. I
think it's very much a
possibility. And I think as we
look at the investments we
continue to make Mr Speaker,
General Lady and addressing one
of the core.
Constraints on workforce
participation with the
underlying effort that we can
actually really looked to this
to increase our workforce. Mr
Speaker, General Lady.
Mr Speaker, General Lady, I am
Latin. Second to last question
as a state, do you would you
expect that we could between now
and 2029 continue to find ways
to look to invest to ensure that
any potential shortfalls short
as small as they may be, as you
pointed out during debate, Mr
Speaker, General Lady given
continued financial strength
Could we proactively address
those over the next four years?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, Donald, then. Yes, I do
think that the time frame
allows for the Legislature to be
proactive in addressing, um
Issues.
Mr Speaker, General Lady, I
agree and to the previous
general Lady from Berna. Leo, I
think this we get to see the
benefits for workforce for
families for new Mexicans. Mr
Speaker, General Lady. This
amendment allows us to make the
investments over the next
several years that cover any
gaps, and Mr Speaker, General
Lady.
What? It's sort of what I take
away from that we get to enjoy
the benefits really quickly, and
Mr Speaker, General Lady, we get
to cover any potential gaps
during that same amount of time
not placing the burden on
employers in these important
fields. Rather, Mr Speaker,
General lady being able to share
that burden substantially from
our position.
Where we are in a strong
financial position as a state.
Would you agree, Mr Speaker?
General lady. Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Thank you, gentlemen.
Yes, I would agree. Mr Speaker,
Gentle lady, that is very
important to me. I intend to
support the amendment and I also
just want to thank you for the
flexibility you're introducing
so that employers all across the
state.
Can tailor policies work with
the Department of Workforce
Solutions, and I think you're
allowing them to voluntarily
raise a bar. Uh, and Mr Speaker,
General Lady, you're giving
Workforce solutions. The clear
statutory framework to recognize
and approve that bar, which is
great. Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Thank you, General Lady on the
amendment lady from Berna, Leo
Representative Thompson.
Thank you, Mr Speaker will the
general lady yield
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Yes, I
will yield to my colleague in
Vienna, Leo. Thank you. Most of
you know that my career has been
with people with disabilities
and I have a son who lives in a
group home, and I think one
thing that keeps being missed
here. Is that the folks that you
have included in this amendment
are folks who cannot raise their
prices, The state sets their
prices.
Um and and as as their costs go
up, there just kind of stuck,
and that's why that's why
they're included here and other
folks are not a restaurant
convenience store, they can
raise their prices, um, to meet
the need, but But would you
agree with that, madam? I mean,
general Lady, Mr Speaker.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, General Lady. Yes, I other
industries have different
options.
Thank you, Mr Speaker and
General lady, So I've talked
about my son Eric on this floor
and in many committees, I don't
think any of you know him, but I
wish you did. So he lives in a
group home now, and he has for
about the past five years, which
has allowed my husband and I
actually have something of a
life. We spent decades caring
for him.
And and, as I've said many times
before he's 6 ft seven. He's
strong as an ox. He lives in a
group coming for the first time
ever about six months ago. His
language is very limited, but we
were sitting on a couch on our
Sunday afternoon. Get together
is that we always do with him
and he looked at me and he said,
Mama, I'm happy.
And it it almost
Brought me to tears and it still
does, And I think a lot of that
is because of the staff at the
group home where he lives. He he
talks about going home when
we're with him, he says. I want
to go home, and those people
have made a home where he is
happy and that I don't know if
people can understand how
How much that touches your heart
as a parent to have your child
at almost the age of 33 for the
first time in his life to say
he's happy, and I'm not saying
he wasn't happy at home. We
tried our best, but it was a
difficult situation. So those
folks, Mr Speaker and general
Lady are responsible for his
health and safety. I mean, he's
a big guy. He's incredibly
strong. He has pulled toilets
out of the floor.
He makes a regular practice of
breaking glass. There's
something about breaking class
that he loves. He breaks
windshields of vehicles. He
breaks windows. He breaks
glassware he breaks.
He also has some issues with
feces. He's tall enough to wipe
feces on the ceiling. He
sometimes soils himself.
He uses clothes and towels to
wipe after a bowel movement and
that actually doesn't sound like
that fun of a job to do.
And and when you can go work at
McDonald's or target and make
more money have way less
responsibility and way less.
Dirty work for lack of a better
word. Um, it's kind of a no
brainer and I'm
Eternally grateful to the folks
who are willing to do it. I
think it really is a calling and
they're doing it because they
feel they're not doing it to
make a living because we don't
that we don't pay them enough to
really make a living.
So when this bill first came
forward, Mr Speaker and General
Lady
I love the idea, but there was a
catch in my throat about Dede
providers, and I know many, many
of them. The ad cap group
contacted me many times and and
it just kind of stuck with me
that
We need to do this for new
Mexicans, but I really don't
want to hurt that group of
people.
And, um, I've been getting texts
and emails and all kinds of
things. You know. What can you
do to help us in my thought was
since there was time before it
went into effect that we could,
um, work on getting increased
Medicaid reimbursement to make
this easier for the companies
that provide these services.
But this is such an artful way
of doing that. And I'm so
appreciative that you have
brought this amendment. I've
been hearing from the folks
today I do have a question. Um,
are intermediate care facilities
for individuals with
intellectual and developmental
disabilities included.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. Gentle lady. Yes.
Thank you so much. That's one of
the text I've gotten this
morning. Um
So for decades I've been
fighting for trying to get
increased reimbursement for
these folks, because, as I said,
it's a hard job many times. It's
a thankless job, and it can be a
dangerous job when he first
moved into a group home, it was
he's on the spectrum, and it was
a hard, hard transition for him.
and so his his crisis plan when
he would have an explosion of
whatever sort
They would call 911 and the
ambulance would come. The police
would come and they would take
him to the hospital, and he
would sit in the ER overnight
and in the morning and
a psychiatrist would call me and
say, you know, we don't really
know what to do for people with
autism. The only option we have
is to put them in the psych
hospital, and we don't think
that's really
A good thing to do and and I
said, You're right. That's not a
good thing to do. But the people
who worked in his group home had
to deal with that many, many
times the first few months when
he was making that transition
and the fact that we pay them so
little breaks my heart and it it
makes me appreciate them so much
more that they're willing to.
Live with poverty wages to take
care of people like my son, Mr
Speaker and General General
General Lady The General Lady
from Coral. Um, let's see. I
can't even read my own
handwriting. Um
Basically talked about how the
reimbursement has gone down. I
mean, we all
Hear about inflation and
everything else and the actual
reimbursement for these
providers has gone down over the
years, and so we took four to
expect them to continue to do
the great job that most of them
do is it's kind of ridiculous to
think you know, we're paying.
We're paying less for services
than we were years ago, even
though costs have gone way up.
Um and and again.
Folks, folks who take care of
people with disabilities like my
son.
Have have an option that would
be much easier, much less
responsibility.
And more pay, And so I really
want to thank you for this
amendment. I think it is the
best thing about this this bill
right now because it looks out
for people who who are doing
God's work for lack of a better
word and who their employers
have no way to pay them more. I
mean, they would. I know that
the the organization that runs
the group home that my son is in
I mean, he he spent $5000.01
weekend to cover shifts and
without any extra money coming
in. There are laws about how
many people there have to be.
And and so so these companies
are running on a shoestring and
a prayer. And if we if we don't
do something with them, so I am
just so thankful for everyone
who is involved with this.
And, um, we need this amendment.
The folks who take care of our
vulnerable citizens need this
amendment and thank you so much.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, the other
further debate on the amendment.
the gentleman from San Juan
Percent of Lane. Thank you. Mr
Speaker is generated from
Benaglio yield.
Mr Speaker, I will yield to my
friend and colleague from San
Juan. Thank you, Mr Speaker.
It's been a nice reprieve did
not have to listen to Republican
voices all day. So I appreciate
the debate on the other side on
this amendment.
Nice, nice change of pace.
Mr Speaker, General Lady from
Berna, Leo. So I've been
listening to the last few folks
who stood up to debate this
amendment.
And the point that I've been
hearing over and over again, as
I understand part of the
rationale for for this
preferential treatment of this,
this group is that they are
subject to Medicaid caps and
pricing, so they have no other
options. Is that correct?
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen. Um
They are, I would say probably
the most restricted in their
ability to make changes. Mr.
Speaker generally from Burnley,
What do you mean? When you say
make changes?
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen. Um
In terms of adjusting revenue,
um and liabilities.
And Mr Speaker generally from
burning well, can you speak to?
Why would they need to adjust
revenue?
Mr Speaker, gentlemen, because
there is
In order to fund this there is
an employee and an employer
contribution.
Mr Speaker.
Mr Speaker, gentlemen. And I
would say that that is part of
the bill Mr Speaker generated
from Bernie Leo. So if I
understand what you're saying,
is what what Senate Bill Three
is going to do is it's going to
increase the cost of doing
business and then in turn is
going to be turned on to the
consumer. Is that correct?
Mr Speaker and gentlemen, um,
that is, I think a fair way of
looking at it.
Mr Speaker generally from
burner, Leo, and so I agree. I
think that's the inevitable
result of a bill like this, and
I would also point to the body
that
Those subject to Medicaid caps
are not the only entities that
can't raise their prices, so to
speak, whether it's a public
agency, whether it's local
schools.
Whether it's nonprofits offering
free services, all of those
folks
Don't have the option of
increasing the revenue.
Mr Speaker, generally from
Bruno, Leo, I'm curious.
When we talk about how this is
carved out, Can the underlying
fund ever go and solvent
according to this law.
Hmm. Mr Speaker and gentlemen,
Um, can you, uh, relate that
specifically to the amendment
Because I think that's more of
Bill. Question, Mr. Speaker
generally from bring Leo I will
connect the dots. I assure you.
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen, if you
would be so kind as to connect
to that, so I would appreciate
it. Mr Speaker, generally from
Benaglio Ken, this fund ever go
and solvent or not.
Mr Speaker and gentlemen, Since
we are on the amendment, would
you please Would you just go
ahead and ask your specific
question as it relates to the
amendment because I'm sure it's
dealing with solvency. But I'd
like it if you would just skip
ahead to that. Mr Speaker.
Gentlemen from Burnley, I
wouldn't need to ask my
questions if the fund could go
insolvent, So I just need to
know yes or no? Can it be
insolvent?
Mr Speaker. I would like to
yield to one of the sponsors of
the bill to answer that
question, please.
The letter from Santa Fe. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Thank you,
gentlemen. Um, there has been 14
states where they have this but
policy that has been passed in
their states less so there has
been about 10 that have already
enacted this this legislation
actually stronger legislation
What we're proposing here today?
none of those have ever gone
insolvent. The closest is one
which started their rates too
low and the ones that, um
And and and now have recently
actually started to drop their
rates again. No fund has ever
gone above 1.2% of payroll in
total between the two groups
without being said. This fund
starts at 9/10 of a percent
between employer and employee
paying in and so all all
evidence points to this will be
a solid fund. There's also a
mechanism that between employers
and employees, there is a cap.
It's how much they can raise it
by per year. They being the DWS
and that would be up to
1/10 split between the employer
and the employee. So this
ensures that we are avoiding any
concerns for solvency, looking
at what other states have
learned over the past 30 years
of having paid family medical
leave. We feel very confident
the fund, but like anything, he
could go and solvent. The one
thing I will say in that, Mr
Speaker, Gentlemen, is that
looking during the pandemic when
you would see an uptake and
usage of the paid family medical
leave states that had a paid
family medical leave policy in
place fared better than those
without it. Um, I yield back to
the gentle lady from
Braulio Mr Speaker generated
from
I guess Bernie Leo now.
Um so I I think I heard that it
can go insolvent, which is very
surprising me. Frankly, I
thought the law would not allow
for that.
Um, but I understand the goals
for it to avoid becoming
insolvent. So I have a question
regarding your amendment.
So
Why are we exempting?
The employers.
It seems to me that the
employees who are at the actual
frontline workers
The ones providing this vital
care that we've heard so much
about today.
It seems that inevitably in
order to spread out that $2
million figure we heard earlier
from just from the CD alone,
not counting the other entities.
That burden is going to be
spread out amongst the employees
eventually.
And so, Mr Speaker generated
from burning Leo. Why didn't you
flip this? Why not make it the
employees?
Who are exempt, and why put the
burden on the employees. Mr
Speaker, gentlemen, because
fundamentally, the bill is
talking about a benefit for the
employee and the as we've talked
about before the benefit is
portable, and it is portable
with the employee.
Mr Speaker General, any from
Brunello That may be, but the
person who's trying to make ends
meet from month to month to
month.
Isn't going to care about that
high level philosophy.
They're going to want to know.
Why does my employer get a cut?
And I got to keep paying. That's
the bottom line, and I think
that's the issue that I have
with. This amendment is once
again we're looking at
hardworking new Mexican
taxpayers were saying, Look, we
in Santa Fe. We know it's best
for you, Mr Speaker generated
from burner Leo will take care
of you, even if you don't like
this. Oh, don't worry that your
employer
This large corporation doesn't
have to pay their fair share.
But you who is trying to make it
month to month to month. You've
you have to pay actually more
than your fair share. So thank
you. Mr Speaker. There is for
the debate on the amendment
generated from Dona Ana
Representative Ferrari. Thank
you. Mr Speaker. Will the gentle
lady from Berlioz's please
yield.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. Yes,
I will yield to the gentle lady
from Dona Ana. Thank you, Mr
Speaker and General lady. Um, I
have been very concerned about,
um, how your Well I'm glad that
you're amendment will help Early
childhood educators and their
providers because as we're
Building that, um, provisions
for all of our families. Um,
this will give them a chance to
see how this works. Can you
explain how waiting till um
2029? Those five years will help
us to look at? Um
How this provision will be able
to be incorporated into their
businesses.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentle lady. So, um, the
reason for allowing, um, several
years is number one to ensure
that the figures are
incorporated into the actuarial
study. So we have information
moving forward and then to allow
time for the Legislature if we
need to increase reimbursement
rates.
It allows time for the
Legislature to do that and plan
for that.
Thank you, Mr Speaker in general
Lady and I know that there's a
lot of small businesses who
support um this bill into make
it so that they have, um, of a
way to compete with larger
companies and to make sure that
their employee they can attract
employees to their businesses.
But I think that this is really
important that we give them that
time and for us to look at these
different situations and to make
sure the solvency and I was
really glad about the other
questions and support for the
disability, Developmental
disabilities waiver providers
because that's another group of
providers that we are trying to
build. We are trying to get
better Medicaid.
Reimbursements for
So having this as another
exception will really help with
all of that. Um and so, with all
of these, um
Timely, um, brought in groups
after we can see how other
things such as in state
government and other businesses
that this can be provided and
all the ins and outs of, um
people being able to get paid
family medical leave. I think
this is going to be important
for our state and to lift
everyone up. So thank you very
much for bringing this forward.
Mr Speaker. I moved to adopt the
amendment.
Right. We are in a motion to
adopt House floor Amendment
number one to send a bill three
is twice amended. There is a
roll call vote.
It would have yes in the
amendment have been adopted
would have known and we're back
on the amendment.
30 seconds old clock.
But it's about to close.
The vote is not closed by one of
34 in the affirmative 36 in the
negative House floor Amendment
number one has not been adopted.
We're back on the amendment.
General lady from Berlin on the
floor.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. I
appreciate the lively debate,
although
I was expecting the debate to
focus more on the bill. Not the
amendment, but thank you all.
And with that.
Back to the sponsors.
Mhm, gentle lady. Would you like
to withdraw the amendment now
that it's been tabled that has
not been adopted? Sorry, thank
you wasn't clear in my
instructions, would you? Can I
withdraw the amendment, please?
It is withdrawn.
We'll go next to the German from
Sandoval, representative
Martinez.
Thank you. Mr Chairman will be
kind of lady from Los Alamos.
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen from
Sandoval. I will yield and I'd
also like to defer to my
colleague, representative. I
mean, the gentle lady from Santa
Fe.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Absolutely.
Um, General Lady from Santa Fe.
We've had this discussion.
Small business in their
employees are the backbone of
any economy.
And good business owners are
going to take care of their
employees because they see them
as family.
Um
But the the communication that
I've had from these employers
and employees from my district
Have said they love to do this.
But they're not willing to pay
an additional tax.
Um they want to do this on their
own.
They're willing to do it and
many of them do it already.
My question, Kind Lady from
Santa Fe, Mr Speaker.
I've read this bill over and
over again. And what is business
friendly about this about this
bill?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. Gentlemen. I really
appreciate that question.
because this iteration of this
bill has been in process for
more than 2.5 years, and in that
time, it has changed
significantly as mentioned.
there were you know, since there
is a task force 2.5 years ago
have been four other states that
have passed something That was
further. Um, you know, like, I
think the original bill that you
know that was originally going
through the Senate, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen.
Um, but what? What we have here
is something that's uniquely
new Mexican and uniquely
addresses the needs of new
Mexican businesses and new
Mexican workers to be quite
frank. Two thirds of businesses
are excluded from paying into
the fund as it stands as we
exempt for or less businesses
with four or less employees. We
worked with different businesses
to ensure that job protection
for employees who need to
utilize this wouldn't start
until they were at that job for
six months now, in practice what
that means, Mr Speaker, gentle.
One is that people would be able
to then take the time that they
paid into the fund for six
months, whatever job they had
before.
But if they have, like, for
example, worked for you, Mr
Speaker, gentlemen, and I said,
Hey, I broke my leg. I can't
come into work anymore, You
know, and I've only been with
you for two months and it would
be up to you as my employer, Mr
Speaker, gentlemen to make the
decision You know I can get on
without you. I can't because now
a job protection doesn't start
for 180 days instead, Mr
Speaker, gentlemen, we worked
really closely with DWS and
businesses and business
representatives to ensure there
was increasing conversation
between employees and employers.
Previously in the version of
this bill, and again what we've
seen in other states, there was
not a necessary time that an
employee would have to alert
their employer regarding the, um
we're going the fact that I have
to leave now in the bill. As it
stands, employees have to tell
employers at least 20 days or
whatever is practical. So if
you're having a baby, that's
something you can plan for. And
you have 20 days to ensure
you're telling your employer
that so that they can make
preparations they can hire
someone in their stead.
And when that person is out to
have a baby, the employers not
paying this person anymore. That
frees up that money to pay their
colleagues for overtime to pay
to maybe save up some money to
maybe higher attempt in person.
We do know that New Mexico is at
near full employment, which is a
fabulous thing, but we also know
that the weight of taking care
of our families oftentimes falls
on the women in our families,
Um, as a Latina as a Chicana. I
know that my experiment expected
to care for my elders, just like
I care for my
My kids, and I'm very lucky. I'm
blessed. Have a wonderful mom.
That helps me but that's part of
the culture that I'm in, and I'm
not alone.
A number of women who are
native. Uh, you know,
indigenous who are who are
Chicana? Hispanic. We all are
expected to care for families
and we want to do that. This
bill ensures that we can return
to the workforce and get back to
work afterwards. In addition, Mr
Speaker, gentlemen, and I just
want to answer your question
fully because there's been a lot
that we've been trying to do. Um
What ends up happening is that
if you're providing this
individually, and we do know
employers do that because we
have good employers were part of
the fabric, our communities, it
is more expensive to do that
They end up paying a lot more
money to be able to give someone
that amount of time or time off
and pay their salary and their
benefits. At the same time, the
waiver estate like ours that has
low wages are increasing. We're
doing a lot to change that, and
we have business owners that are
getting by. Everyone just puts
in a little bit to make it
better. Mr Speaker, gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
lady. Um
I'm glad to hear that you've
reached out to businesses, but I
saw a flyer.
That 85% of small businesses
support this.
Is it was that was that
A true statement. What
businesses because
I'm telling you, 99% of the
businesses in my district.
Have voiced their opposition to
this.
And not only the businesses, but
I've been I've started getting
calls from employees of those
businesses.
That 100% of those calls.
Or opposing this bill.
Now, Mr Speaker, Kind lady. The
flyer that said 85% of small
businesses.
Can you tell me where that
number came from? Thank you, Mr
Speaker. Thank you, gentlemen.
So again, that that number of as
I understand it as well came
from a survey of I believe more
than 300 businesses throughout
New Mexico of different ranks
and everything they interviewed
of different parties and
etcetera, etcetera. They asked
them directly and I'll be honest
with you, Mr Speaker. Gentlemen,
I think
Because I know that people are
scared to be quite Frank. We're
talking about something very new
to New Mexico. The value isn't
new. This is what we do is you
Mexicans? We take care of each
other like that's what we do.
but but the concept of putting
that into a statute and that you
know, requiring a change. It's
scary and it's shifting it and
there are some things we did
also do to help alleviate that
with putting the administrative
burden not on our small
businesses. Not this time we put
it on workforce solutions and
should workforce solutions. Find
that to be difficult.
We also found that it was
important to to allow them to
outsource to another to another
group if they needed to do so.
so that number comes from that
survey and then also aligns with
a lot of what we're seeing from
other states as well after paid
family medical leave policies
have been passed in other
states. We've seen the policy
was seen that the opinions from
small businesses shift in favor
of this primarily because
As you mentioned, Mr Speaker.
Gentlemen, we had good business
owners, you know, And I know
I've talked to colleagues, your
colleagues, my colleagues here,
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen, that
said, you know, I mentioned that
that handshake that fell through
for me and that we were trying
to get by and in a conversation
in the health committee, someone
said Mr Speaker, gentlemen, I
would never do that. And I
believe that I believe that he
wouldn't let that that fall
through. Mr Speaker, Gentlemen.
I think it is a fearful thing,
and that's why we're hearing
people. How that fear but to me,
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen, the fear
of this bill.
No, I'm going to say it because
this is the heart of the bill.
The fear of that bill is less
scary than finding out that
someone you love has a cancer
diagnoses and finding out
there's no one there to care for
your mom when she needs you and
finding out that your baby is
sick and and and you got to take
care of them. That's scary.
That's scary stuff that the
people in this chamber deal with
every day. That's something that
that we all have to care for.
And so, Mr Speaker, gentlemen.
Again. That's where those data
comes from. And that's why I
believe that we're hearing, you
know concerns from our
community.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
lady. Um
I do have to call into question.
the high percentage because,
like I said, I'm getting phone
calls from my district and I'm
getting phone calls from
businesses in Albuquerque, which
is outside of my district.
And 100% of those calls Also.
Or opposing this so
I don't doubt your word.
Please understand that. But this
number I think is
Probably a little bit too high.
I've gotten emails and calls and
texts and visits from a lot of
chambers of commerce. Um and
From testimony here and in
committee. I heard that
The majority of chambers of
commerce support. This also
And I have to ask. I'm not sure
which chambers because the
largest chamber Mexico Chamber
of Commerce came out against
this.
I just got an email a couple of
days ago from the Hispano
Chamber of Commerce, it said.
This is a bad bill and asked me
to vote against it my local
chambers against it the
Albuquerque chambers against it,
Um
Mr Speaker, Kind Lady.
When, when the statement of
The majority of chambers of
commerce support this
Can you justify that a little
bit.
Mr Speaker, gentlemen. Um and I
just want to clarify
Uh, was it in this debate that
one of us said that the majority
of chambers support this, Mr
Speaker, gentlemen.
Mr Speaker? No, but it's been in
the flyers that are being passed
out and some of the previous
Debate.
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen. What I
will say is that we work very
closely with the various
chambers and again I would not
say, Mr Speaker, gentlemen, that
in particular the chambers that
themselves have decided to come
out in favor of this. What I
will say, though, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen is in my conversations
with business owners that I work
with as well. They either
already have a policy that
they're paying significantly
more for
For full context. Mr Speaker,
Gentlemen on a payroll of half a
million dollars $500,000
payroll it would cost $2000 per
year to cover all of their
employees. Mr Speaker,
Gentlemen, when my when my
nonprofit cobbled together time
off for me that was $5000 out
the door that they took out of
their hands. And instead of that
being the case, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen, they could have hired
somebody else to attempt for me.
Instead, they could have paid my
colleagues a little bit more.
Even a bonus. Thank you for
helping out just a little bit
more because we're all selling.
So that's part of that, too.
So again. This helps those those
businesses get get through those
pieces, and a lot of the members
of the Chambers also found that
as well, What's been
interesting, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen is and I want to
recognize the good work that
chambers do do for our
communities. I don't want to say
otherwise. And I will say, Mr
Speaker, Gentlemen, we worked
with a number of different
chambers across the state in
developing a lot of the
language. And I think, Mr
Speaker, gentlemen at the end of
the day
With with a compromise policy on
coming to compromise with other
folks, Mr Speaker, Gentlemen, no
one is necessarily like
celebrating that they had to
give stuff up, you know? And and
Mr Speaker, Gentlemen, we were
working towards ensuring that
people are covered in so far as
much as they can. So what I say
that the majority of chambers
were supportive, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen. No. But have they
been an active and willing part
of the conversation to improve
this language? Mr Speaker,
gentlemen. Absolutely. Mr
Speaker. Gentlemen, we would not
have, um, 20 days record.
Wired for employees to inform
their employers without the
conversations from the chamber.
We would not have a number of
other aspects in this bill that
make it more appetizing to them,
Mr Speaker, gentlemen, and at
the end of the day when we're
talking about turnover and
estate
Mr Speaker. Gentlemen, I'll give
you an example at my my kid's
daycare. I love those workers.
They do a lot for us. They had
three women, Mr Speaker.
Gentlemen, get pregnant at the
same time, And they said these
these folks, they care for our
kids. They have their own kids
They take care of, and they
asked, And they said no, We're
not going to offer you paid
family leave. We don't We can't
afford it. We can't afford to do
that. We have these numbers. And
so, Mr Speaker, gentlemen, all
three of those women left one of
them. Roast recently runs a
photography shop now Another one
does something else in that they
did before they love because
they took care of
Babies in our community, Mr
Speaker, Gentlemen.
And instead of having them come
back after 12 weeks, having
their time with their babies
instead of that, they just left
and then we were left for two
years instead of having pick up
at five o'clock like we used to
my husband and I and all the
other parents had to figure out
how to pick up by two by three
o'clock every single day. Just I
want to get this right by three
o'clock that costs us. As as as,
um
As a as parents and workers in
the community that costs that
cost significantly to the
daycare facility as well. And so
what this does, Mr Speaker
gentlemen is for these
businesses. Yeah, I'm not going
to say it's always easy, but
what makes it easier is that
you're not speak eagerly seeking
somebody replace those folks.
You have something that helps
instead thank you for that, Mr
Mr Speaker in Kind, Lady, Um
And I completely understand that
I have run small businesses. Um
and I always felt it was very
important.
That
I take care of my employees
because they're the ones that
Were part of my business and
helping us be successful.
And there were several instances
where I gave my employees time
off.
Because I knew that if I took
care of them, I never had the
question.
Whether they were going to do
something extra when I asked
them, But I did that by choice,
not because the government
forced me to do it.
Um
You brought up a good point, Mr
Speaker, Kind lady or non
profits.
Um, exempt in this bill. Mr
Speaker, Gentlemen. Um
You know, again, looking at
Our state the median household
income in New Mexico is $54,000
between whomever is living in
that household. That's lower
than a lot of other places and
again. I'm proud to see how
we're growing our economy as
rapidly as we are, because we
are and one of the top growing
wage states in the nation. I
have to give us a lot of credit.
So, um, you know, in order to
fill that to ensure the fund is
large enough to ensure that it
can take on some of these
shifts, um everyone pays in.
except for those that have four
or less employees. Two thirds of
businesses. Two thirds of that
group are not paying into that.
Um, I believe I saw a number.
There was something like 68,000
different business entities
would not pay into this fund for
that.
So nonprofits are expected to be
part of this because, like so
many employers across the state,
Mr Speaker, gentlemen, this is a
benefit they can provide when
local businesses in Santa Fe in
house in Rio Arriba in any of my
the northern communities are
trying to offer things they're
not competing with each other
for employees. They're completed
meeting with Los Alamos National
Labs because Los Alamos is large
enough to offer some of the best
benefits in the state. Mr
Speaker, gentlemen,
And so the nonprofits that are
in our districts who would
benefit from being able to offer
something that can somewhat
compete with the Los Alamos
should also be paying in for the
benefit that now they can
promote in the community and
say, This is what we can offer
as well.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
lady. Um, I would have minded if
that's the case. These
nonprofits are going to be even
more nonprofit, um, having to
pay more taxes.
Um
Going back to, um
A comment that you made
Earlier that change the chambers
of commerce across the state
have been a large part of this
conversation.
Um
Being a part of such a large
part of the conversation. Why
are all the or the majority of
chambers coming out against this
bill? If I would think that if
they had such a large part in
crafting this bill
Developing the policy that they
would then
Come out and I wouldn't be
getting emails like the one I
got just a couple of days ago
saying, Please do not vote for
this bill. It is bad for
business.
Can you explain to me?
Mr Speaker, Madam Chair.
If they were such a big part of
the conversation. Why are they
coming out?
You know in such strong
opposition to this bill.
Mr Speaker, gentlemen, and I'm
gonna go back.
A couple of years ago when we
were having some of these
conversations earlier on and
again, they're they're or origin
of this bill in New Mexico goes
back much farther than 2.5 years
ago, goes back about five plus
years ago when my co sponsor
started working on this with
other folks, So I want to give
credence to that. Um, but Mr
Speaker, gentlemen, that two
years ago someone made it clear
to me from the chamber that that
they they
Could not support a paid family
medical leave that employers
paid into that That was actually
that did come up again and again
and again, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen, and I'm just I'm just
being honest with what that
conversation was. And and you
know, I think, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen, I was enjoy debating
with you because I think you and
I have different perspectives,
but I think that makes for a
richer experience overall, and
so what I see with those
chambers as well. Mr Speaker,
gentlemen, is that they've
shifted this bill and and they
should add, and everyone who's
been in these conversations has
changed What this bill looks
like.
To be a uniquely new Mexico.
Process that it's a phase in
that we can trust each other
through that process and and and
make it based on solvency and in
these tenants that we were a
data driven state, where one of
the one of the most out of
driven states, you know when you
look at the rankings on it, and
CSL, the National Conference of
State Legislatures, we reply on
data and so we looked at this
and we want to make sure we made
a lot of those again more
agreeable.
No one is ever going to be 100%
happy with what shifts But the
conversations I've had with all
the Kirky chamber and with the
New Mexico Chamber has been that
you know things and they said
this publicly, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen and multiple, um, um
public, you know, instances,
Thank you for for the
conversations. Thank you for
hearing our concerns. We still
oppose the bill.
I don't want to pretend
otherwise. But that's that's not
what they're
But but they appreciated that
we're listening to what they're
saying.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind lady
in
I think
I've gotten kind of nervous
reading some of the texts and
some of the emails I'm getting
because our audience is growing
by the minute um and being one
who
Doesn't like the
The spotlight. I'm starting to
get very nervous so
Bear with me. Um, I have a list
here of
The
Coalition partners that have
come out against this bill. And
if you could tell me if these
were part of
Those members that contacted you
and became a large part of the
conversation.
Um, I'm showing associated
builders and contractors New
Mexico Restaurant Association.
The last cruises Chamber of
Commerce and New Mexico
categories Association.
Mr Speaker, The Gallup Chamber
of Commerce, the New Mexico
Chamber of Commerce, the Hispano
Chamber of Commerce.
The New Mexico Hospitality
Association Associated
Contractors of New Mexico.
Greater Albuquerque Hotel and
Lodging Association.
Mexico Homebuilders Rio Rancho
Chamber of Commerce, Dari
Associates, home builders of
central New Mexico, and the list
goes on for about another page,
Mr. Speaker Counting Lady, Can
you tell me?
If these people were part of the
large
Conversation that's been going
on. Mr Speaker. Gentlemen, I can
tell you confidently that more
than half of them have been a
part of the conversation. And
what I want to also mention is
that we we believe that this is
a living document right? That
that the laws we pass are not
done forever and that we never
look again and ensure that
they're serving our communities
to the best of their abilities
And a number of the ones that
you've mentioned already know
and understand.
I know I don't want to. But,
yes, they know that those
conversations for how once the
actuarial study comes out in
2025 before we come back here
that they will continue to be
able to be able to shape the
conversation and 2026 when the
When the funds start coming out,
they will continue to tell us
how that's impacting their
members and in 2027, when people
are beginning to be able to take
those funds, Um they'll tell us
that they're they're concerned
about how it's being applied and
in 2029 should the fund be
solvent at 140%.
They will be able to inform us
if, um, if the 12 weeks and how
that's impacting them because Mr
Speaker, gentlemen like Mr
Speaker, Gentlemen.
This bill.
Is intended in our work here is
intended to continue to support
our communities ongoing, But
yes, we have been in contact
with, I would say the majority
of the groups that you mentioned
and a majority of the different
um, the folks that have reached
out to us
Thank you, Mr Chair. Kind lady.
So once again, I I struggle with
if they've been such a large
part of the conversation and
helped in developing the policy
in the bill.
Why I'm
Now getting texts where they got
my number from. I'm not sure,
but I'm getting text from
business owners and chambers
across the state now.
Telling me you cannot let this
happen.
There is overwhelming. I want to
direct everybody's
Attention to these giant piles
of paper.
That's 50,000 people in New
Mexico who have signed an online
petition opposing this. That's
50,000 out of more than 100,000.
People.
Mr Speaker, Kind Lady 100,000
People are willing to put their
name on something that opposes
this that is supposed to
Be the greatest bill we've
passed in this house for years.
Mr Speaker, Kind lady That
worries me if that many people
Or opposed to this and that many
businesses and chambers of
commerce are opposed to this.
I have to listen to that.
I promised the people in my
district
And I promised the business
people in my district that I
would come up here and fight for
them.
Kind lady. I appreciate the
The debate between you and I not
only on this floor, but
In the hallways in offices and
committee because I always learn
something from you.
And I think you and I have come
to the, uh
Understanding that we can have
opposing views.
We can take opposite ends of a
of a discussion.
And remain friends.
So I hope after today
That's still the case.
But I want you to explain to me
Mr Speaker, Kind Lady.
Over 100,000 people are opposed
to this.
If we pass this and and I were
support it, how do I go back to
my district?
And tell people I know better
than you like.
Earlier debate. Sanitary doesn't
always know better.
Sometimes Sanofi needs to get
out of the way.
And let businesses do what they
do best. If it's a good
employer, they're gonna take
care of their employees and keep
those employees.
Moving on to another point, Mr
Speaker, Kind Lady.
Nervous nervousness seems to dry
up my throat, Mr. Speaker, Kind
lady.
Um
Another point.
This. This bill calls on
The Department of Workforce
Solutions to administer the
program. Is that correct?
Mr Speaker, gentlemen. Yes.
Oh, shucks, Mr. Speaker, Kind
Lady. I was expecting a longer
answer.
Um
No water for the wicked Mr
Speaker to that joke, I kid that
don't mean it that way. And I
hope you know, I don't know no
rest for the wonderful I should
say, Mr Speaker, Kind lady all
ask him more open ended
questions so I could take a
drink of water.
Um
If you could consult with your
expert
And I appreciate the
conversations I've had with the
secretary also.
But how many positions is this
gonna take to administer?
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you, gentlemen.
As as it stands, she anticipates
200.
2 216 employees would be
necessary. However, Mr Speaker,
gentlemen, as she reads the
bill, and as we read the bill,
she is able to, um, contract out
and put out an RFP for duties
that may be necessary as well.
So that that any worker shortage
should not be a concern. Mr
Speaker, gentlemen.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kind
Lady. Can you ask your expert
What her vacancy rate is, as of
now, Mr Speaker. Gentlemen, I'm
glad you asked that they have
about 20% vacancy right now,
Partially because of their are
they aren't funded for those
positions. And Mr Speaker,
Gentlemen, we made sure that
these this program was funded in
the budget.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Again, it
seems like a leap.
And I don't know how that's
going to happen.
Um
It's going to cost a lot of
money, not not only from
businesses, but it's gonna cost
a lot of money to just fund the
people.
That are going to work here. So
I ask again, Mr Speaker, Kind
Lady.
What in this bill is business
friendly, Mr Speaker. Gentlemen,
bigger labor force that so many
of our employers have been
requesting over time Mr Speaker
and economy that allows the
folks to stay in New Mexico and
not have to leave when they have
these things reduce turnover
because people will come back
and continue to to work for that
same employer.
Fewer sick days because people
can take time off and care for
their families, and when they
needed it helps them compete
with larger businesses like
Alanna like an Amazon like these
large corporations, like like
oil companies that are able to
offer these in competing
benefits. It allows folks who
have chronic illnesses to get
back in the in the workforce. It
protects our economy. Overall,
When Covid comes, there's a
myriad of reasons.
But for this to be to be
effective
Mr Speaker. Kind lady. I
appreciate that.
And Mr Speaker pursuing the
house rule 20-1.
With this bill being under
consideration for three hours, I
moved to close debate on Senate
Bill three as twice amended and
asked for a roll call vote.
Okay. We're on a motion to close
the bait after three hours of
consideration, we have a roll
call vote to close the bait.
Vote of yes and
We would have ended Abate.
The vote.
Is now open.
Well, what about the clothes?
The borders are closed by one of
64 in the affirmative six in the
negative.
The motion to close debate.
Succeeds. It's successful.
Upheld.
To voice about next time.
General lady too close.
Mr Speaker. Thank you. This was
a lively debate, No doubt about
it.
But I think I'd like to review
Some of the fundamentals of the
bill.
So that we can get back to, um
What the real subject matter is.
we need to be talking about. And
that is this.
We are creating
This bill creates a program that
will support moms and dads
working families, those who need
to support their parents and
their loved ones when they're
ill.
It supports small businesses
because it gives them
That it places them closer to
being on a level playing field
with large businesses who have
the ability to recruit and
retract and attract employees
with programs such as this
We know small businesses are
hurting because they cannot find
employees to work and that this
will provide them a competitive
advantage in doing so.
There are many, many small
businesses supporting this bill.
And I would point out Mr Speaker
that
The chambers serve a very
wonderful purpose in many ways.
But
Many small businesses cannot
afford to participate in
chambers.
Are not part of chambers of
commerce.
I spoke to a business owner said
it would cost her less to
participate in this program than
it would to pay New Mexico
Chamber of Commerce dues.
So I just want to remind people
there are there's a whole vast
array of small businesses out
there who want this.
Recognize that they needed to
make themselves competitive and
that it will serve their
employees. Well.
And those employees will be
morale will go up and they will
see that this and they will
return to the workplace once the
need for this leave has been
utilized. So with that, Mr
Speaker, I move. I do now move
that Senate Bill three as twice
amended Do now pass. We are on
final passage of Senate Bill
three as twice amended.
Yes,
you know, reopened the vote and
lady from Dona Ana. The vote is
now closed by what 34 in the
affirmative. 36 in the negative
center built three is twice
amended has failed to pass this
house.
Lady from earlier percent of
Casey.
Mr Speaker. I move. We go to
that order of business
announcements and miscellaneous
business.
Sergeant, please control the
floor of this house. There will
be no displays of emotion. I've
made that very clear.
Thank you. Gentle lady from Leo,
