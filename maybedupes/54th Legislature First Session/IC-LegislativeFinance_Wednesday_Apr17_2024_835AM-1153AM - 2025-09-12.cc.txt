Allison is very famous in our
country with his radio in his
retirement. Uh, we're gonna get
started. Charles, Uh, we're
gonna go over Post section
review, right? That's correct,
Mr Chairman.
So I'll be working out of this
report. That's before you.
Turning to page one, Mr
Chairman.
For the last three years. We've
had unprecedented revenue
growth.
Um, in fact,
Really going back to
FY 19 If you look at the graph
on the upper right hand side
Coming out of the depths of the
Solvency, Uh, period in 2016 and
27 or Yeah, 2017.
We've experienced
Extraordinary revenue growth as
a state.
Which is provided
Uh,
Significant opportunities for
you all to make, um
Really, truly potentially
transformative investments.
So
Let me set the backdrop for what
you've, um
What you're dealing with, as you
were preparing your budget. Uh,
recommendations, Uh, last year
at this time.
So your revenue estimates came
in.
Um for FY 25 at just over $13
billion
An unprecedented new money
figure of about 3.5 billion.
And how do you get that big of a
gap between the amount of
revenue that's projected and the
amount of money that you've got,
potentially to spend through the
budget or through the tax code.
And part of that is because
As these revenues have increased
over the past number of years,
you've not spent it all on
recurring expenses.
You recognize that a lot of it
is coming from potentially non
renewable sources from the oil
and gas?
Um, industry. So you've been
Doing things like cash financing
Capital outlay.
Um, setting aside a big
appropriations for, um,
permanent funds.
Um, as well as a big night. Non
recurring appropriations.
So that was kind of the
The strategy that we talked
about last interim was we've
increased base budgets by
Over 50% over the past couple of
years, So you've taken care of a
lot of now needs.
You've
Implemented policies that have
set aside some of this surplus
out into the future.
For permanent funds, including
chopping off the peaks from oil
and gas.
To set aside for early childhood
trust fund as an example. So
you've done
A a number of of fiscal policy
measures to set aside the
surplus for the long term.
In this session. There was a
major focus on what do we do for
the midterm kind of in the
middle, and we'll talk into this
presentation.
You also had a situation where
you came into the set this last
session.
With reserves that were
estimated to be about 48% of
what your recurring spending
your target was about 30%.
So, you know, $4 billion in
reserve, so a big opportunity
because money was just rolling
into the Treasury. That was
unanticipated when you came out
of the, uh, 2023 session.
So
Huge
Unprecedented non recur or
recurring, Uh, revenue increases
for the new money.
Huge, non recurring money as
well.
So
Coming into the session. The LC,
um budget recommendation at the
at the bottom of Page one.
Total about 10.1 billion, or
5.5 0.9% increase.
So there are discussions all
interim last year and fall.
That we've got this interesting.
Surplus.
That
Is not necessarily permanent and
figuring out how to figure out
how to spread that out over
time.
And so start pulling back the
reins on these big increases
that we've been making in the in
the budgets.
Um, over the past couple of
years to a more sustainable
Budget growth targets. And so
that 5.9% target um was when LFC
came up. Pull that mic Just a
little bit closer. OK, Sorry. I
thought I was being too loud.
Growth in that budget
recommendation was primarily
driven by health and human
services and education.
Medicaid in particular.
Uh, Medicaid under any
circumstance in our long term
budget forecast is gonna be I
call it the Pacman of the
budget.
If we're not doing well,
economically, there's going to
be a lot of people on it.
Medical costs. Don't go down.
They go up. We can moderate some
of that.
But general fun expenditures
will be required.
If we do better economically,
which we're doing right now, our
personal per capita income is
growing faster than
Uh many other states.
Then the federal government says
that's great. You can help pay
for more of the cost of
Medicaid.
And so what we're seeing is is
the need to just backfill lost
federal revenue and in a very
significant way, and so that
drove a lot of the LC
recommendation for, um educate
for, um Healthcare.
The executive budget
recommendation came in at
10%
So figuring out what's the
right, uh, mix between a 10%
growth and a little bit less
than 6% growth.
The full legislatures will see
in the next page.
Um
Ended up growing the recurring,
uh, spending by about 6.8% in
the middle of the page.
That included, um, the
executives recommendation for 3%
compensation increases as
opposed to the LF C's
recommendation of 4%.
Uh, that costs about 89 million
But
House Bill two that you all
passed, Um increased re
recurring spending for early
childhood public schools and
higher education by about $270
million.
Big emphasis on investing in in
strategies to improve our
Um
Work for long term workforce.
Human capital Invest Those
investments included some of the
proceeds that were increasing
from the uh, permanent school
fund for pre K
They also included
Uh, legislation that you all
passed to recognize that?
The corpus of the, UM, early
childhood Trust fund had grown
beyond what the distributions
would, um, allow for. So you
you're catching up to the amount
of money and those
Investments largely entailed, Um
Upgrading our, uh, child care
system.
Including investments in
quality, Um, oversight for both
childcare and
Um, for pre K.
In public schools, the major
Um, investments centered around
Um, fully funding the extended
learning initiatives that you
all have enacted.
As well as um, literacy
initiatives that were proposed
by the governor and supported by
the the full legislature.
There is also the need to
backfill and a promise that was
made by the Legislature for, um
free meals at schools.
That the original estimates, uh,
came in at about half of what
the, uh the cost are looking at.
That's gonna be something.
To take a look at this interim.
If we wanna continue funding
that program.
As sort of a categorical funding
program.
Or if you wanna just roll that
into the base, Um state
equalization guar. Why do I say
that? Part of it is now that the
state picking up the full tab
districts are rolling back.
And the number of applications
that are going forward to draw
down federal funds. And this is
gonna be a theme that you're
gonna hear all enter where we're
leaving Money in Washington.
Um, because we're not, uh,
drawing down.
Available federal funds that we
could draw down and so figuring
out incentives for the
bureaucracies that exist across
the state to to be able to
maximize the amount of revenue
even though we're flush with, um
with cash.
In terms of
Strategies to deal with the
midterm finances. And in the
middle of this, um page two
paragraph, you'll see you
created a A new, um, We call it
an expendable trust fund.
Where you set aside more than
500 million
Not for spending now, but for
spending over the next 3 to 5
years.
On a strategy where you look at
agencies, uh, based budget
expansion request and say
We're not gonna build that into
your base budget until you can
demonstrate.
That you've got solid research
behind it or that you can
demonstrate that it's actually
effective.
And so you set aside three years
worth of funding for a number of
different, uh, expansion
initiatives, including a child
protective services where those
agencies are gonna need to
demonstrate to you all over the
next three years.
Whether those are good
investments to build into the
base budget.
And that that fund is called,
uh, the grow
The government results in
opportunity, Uh, program.
Big increases this last session
for, um Medicaid.
Primarily focused on access to
care.
Uh,
We've done a good job as a state
of expanding
Um, coverage to people.
Whether it's through the
Medicaid expansion, whether it's
through the affordable care act.
So we have more new Mexicans
that are covered.
But in terms of being able to
actually access medical care,
we've got S significant
challenges with that. And if
You're trying to recruit like
Uh, primary care providers as an
ex. It's very challenging to to
recruit a primary care physician
to New Mexico if they look at
their potential panel of
patients and who's paying for
them.
And upwards of 45% of them could
be coming from Medicaid and
Medicaid is paying well below
what any other payer is paying.
So you've been making big
investments to say, well,
Medicaid's gonna pay more than
what Medicare makes not by a
little, but by a lot up to 100
and 50%.
And you've done that through,
uh, hospitals that I'll get
into, um as well so big
investments in another round of
provider rate increases with the
idea that if Medicaid is a
better payer that maybe we can
have better access for, um, for
getting medical care, and that
has a stabilizing effect for the
entire health care system in in
New Mexico, with 45% of our
population is on is on Medicaid.
On Page three on the right hand
side.
Like I talked about you all have
Implemented a number of
different policies to
Stabilize our general fund
revenue, which has been a roller
coaster for more than 40 years
because of its reliance on oil
and gas revenue.
And so if you look at
Um, the orange line. That's our
current direct.
Revenue reliance on oil and gas
revenue.
And so that's
Picked up almost 40% and then
starting to taper off that
tapering off. I wanna call
people's attention to
Um, because when we start
looking at the out years, some
of those direct revenues are in
fact tapering off and so you've
chopped off the peak.
And you've not built that into
your recurring spending, which
would be a real challenge to to
deal with if if those went down
The blue dotted line.
Would be our dependence on oil
and gas. If, in fact you had
built that in to your, um
Uh, recurring revenue streams.
And so you you see that that
would have peaked at about 20.
FY 23 at close to 50%.
But you didn't do that.
You put it into your permanent
funds. You put it into other,
uh, savings accounts.
And that, in turn, is producing
like new investment.
Income coming back to the state
that when we combine the school
permanent funds
Um, in the severance tax
permanent fund.
That are investment income.
That originally, um originated
from oil and gas is going to be
a growing and stable revenue
source for the state were
combined.
Where al almost 60% in the out
years reliant on oil and gas.
But it's not reliant on the
volatility. Uh, the stability of
making those, um
Transfers to those investment
accounts.
Economic outlook for the state.
We've got a strong economy.
Um
Unemployment is at historic
lows.
Um, Labor Force participation.
I'll talk about shortly is
probably holding our economy
back a little bit, um, in terms
of being able to get people off
the sidelines and into the
workforce.
Um
But despite the inflationary
pressures that we've
Um, had experienced as a
country.
Um and as a state our economy is
is doing quite well and you'll
hear a an update.
Um, on our revenue tracking, uh,
later on this morning that will
support that.
Moving on to Page four.
Number of pieces of of
legislation that were enacted
this last session.
Um
You know when we look in the out
years.
There's spending decisions
through the the budget that you
have.
There's also spending decisions
that you have through the tax
code.
And so they were or spending
decisions that you make by
earmarking. Rep. General fund
revenue for other purposes.
All have the same effect. When
we look at the sustainability of
this surplus over time, so
In the middle of the page.
Legislation passed during the
2024 session reduced recurring
general friend revenue by about
200 Million and 25.
There are a number of pieces of
legislation that kicked out
The UM General fund reductions
into out years and
So and
26 that's reduced by 220
million.
In 27.
260 million
What were some of the the pieces
of legislation that that
happened?
When you you made a significant
change to personal income taxes.
Where you
You know, we had essentially
like
Uh, compacted rates at a very
low level that ended up in
almost like a flat tax. You you
provide a tax relief to all
taxpayers through personal and
from legislation that you
adopted and you can see that on
the top of
Uh, the page. Um
On Page five.
So income that's taxed at
certain levels, even if somebody
is total income is at
You know the 5.9% they benefit
from
The changes that you made at the
at the lower level, but you
basically provided significant
tax tax relief to mostly middle
income, um in other legislation
affecting regin, um, revenues,
uh, that were endorsed by the
committee.
Um, the first is
That strategy for the midterm
Uh, creating the grow fund.
There's a provision in that bill
that, um, directs C and D FA to
go and look at the
accountability in Government Act
and figure out what are the, uh,
guardrails for oversight and
accountability when it comes to
not only that fun, but also how
we're doing our, uh, performance
reporting.
Uh, throughout the year.
They were, Uh LFC also endorsed
legislation to increase the
distribution. Like I said, from,
uh, the early childhood trust
fund, um by 95 $5 million
We'll have to see if
Legislation is
Uh, potentially needed next
session, uh, to catch up with
the growth that we're seeing,
and the transfers to that fund
or not.
Um
And also, you know, that fund is
projected to grow to $10 billion
in the next couple of years. And
when the formula fully kicks in,
that's gonna spin off like $500
million are there a broader
suite of Children's
Um, investments that should be
eligible for that funding. Uh,
you've been using some of it for
Um infants and toddlers and
Medicaid.
Um, but some questions have have
been coming up over the past
couple of years of whether that
should be expanded for things
like Children's behavioral
health or broader, um,
Children's health care.
As opposed to creating new
permanent funds, which are hard
to capitalize in order to do
that.
The committee also recognized
that your reserves were so big
and you had so much of your your
reserves tied up in the tax
stabilization fund that weren't
really producing anything.
They're just sitting in Santa
Fe.
If you transferred a almost a
billion dollars of that.
Into a new, higher education.
Um, trust fund.
Or financial aid programs.
To spin off the interest income
would basically relieve future
years liabilities for financial
aid programs in particular
lottery and the opportunity
scholarship and we'll get into
more details when we get into
the education, um, section on
that That's
Getting a lot of national
attention. Um, pretty
groundbreaking, Uh, strategy
what the state been doing in
terms of, uh, making college
affordable and and financially
affordable for the state.
You also took steps. Uh, this
session.
To move the tobacco, uh,
settlement permanent fund out of
the calculation for our
reserves.
That was always a, um
A fund that would be difficult
to access and was difficult to
access in in case of
Um, fiscal turmoil.
And it was artificially propping
up your reserves.
Um and so you because our
finances are doing so well, uh,
you made the decision to move
that out of the
Out of the, UM, reserve
calculations.
You also, um
LFC recommended, um
Legislation to create an
infrastructure planning and
development division with D FA.
To help with our, uh, capital
Outlay financing process. Um,
that was passed by the
Legislature and the governor,
Um, signed that so you'll hear
an update on our Capitol outlay.
Um
Quarterly report. Um, on the on
that as as well this, uh,
meeting
And then finally, you had
another piece of legislation to
basically help prop up our
smallest
Acute care hospitals in rural
areas.
Uh, there was a number of
different provisions that were
focused on
Uh, supporting our hospital
statewide, particularly our
rural hospitals. Um, and that
was signed by the governor as
well.
The one piece of it, so LFC
endorsed legislation pretty
remarkable number of pieces that
were ultimately enacted the one
bill that was recommended by the
LFC that was not
Um, enacted because it was
vetoed by the governor was
taking because we're not using
our severance tax bonding
capacity. Um, that thought was
to make sure that we transfer
that surplus over the next 10
years to the severance tax
permanent fund that bill was
vetoed. There was another bill
to implement reforms to lead a
program that you may want to
revisit.
Um, that bill was not enacted by
the Legislature.
Um, and I believe it was not.
We could turn to page six.
Revenue stabilization and long
term planning. So
The Legislature. Um you all
passed house Bill 253.
Which sought to reform our our
bonding program and reform that
As we've been experiencing these
huge increases.
For the operating budgets.
From oil and gas.
We've also been experiencing
that.
For our capital program through
the severance tax bonding
program.
And there is concern long term
that that
If we spent all of the bonding
capacity, it wouldn't be
sustainable or if there was a
huge drop.
And, uh, revenue from the oil
and gas sector.
Um and and the volatility that
comes with that.
Would it raise questions about
whether we could fulfill our
bonding obligations if we are if
we were to do that, so there
were reforms contained in house
Bill 253 that were made
Uh, to mitigate, um, that big
run up and the and the big
change here was basically
setting aside some of the
surplus into basically another
permanent fund that would spin
off money.
Um, into the future.
For
Planning and smaller capital
outlay projects.
Going forward and you can see
that graph it. It's kind of
skewed because it's in the
sidebar.
But
By FY 50.
Um this strategy will will start
to spin off more than $400
million a year for those types
of
Get ready for the bigger capital
outlay projects and don't spend
all of the, um severance tax.
Uh, revenue that you have for
the the bonding program.
So turning today's surpluses for
capital in the future.
Recurring, um
Recurring revenue for capital
outlay.
Fiscal outlook on Page eight.
This chart on the left for our
general fund reserves is
To me extraordinary.
You know, we have a graph that I
use in a lot of presentations
showing
The roller coaster ride of
General fund revenues coming in
general fund appropriations
going up going down.
All of that gets masked by the
last couple of years. That
volatility including like the
size of our reserves, you know
if we run this back to
2001. There was like, basically
no reserves. That's why the
tobacco settlement permanent
Fund was put into the reserves
because we didn't have any. We
needed something to count as
reserves.
So you've got significant
cushion.
Going forward.
But a lot of that is tied up in
the red Bar, which is the tax
stabilization reserve. That's
not liquid.
For you to be able to easily
access. That is your rainy day
fund.
Your liquid funds are the
operating reserve green.
And this session, you
Basically left money in the
operating reserve, which
sometimes you spend it all.
Uh, but this session, you left
money in the operating reserve
because
You know, That was a a strategy
that if something happens with
oil and gas in particular
That you'd be able to easily
access that
The other thing is you set up so
many other backup reserves.
Early Childhood Trust fund is a
backup reserve.
Growth is now a backup reserve
with 500 million we we probably
should start having
conversations about
You know the amounts that are
set aside for next year in
reserves, meet your stress test
requirements that you, um
Consensus revenue estimating
group is coming up with
You know, if things really run
off the rails, you've got enough
money to cover it.
But with all these other funds
out there that you've set aside
money.
I think a good conversation to
be had is
Is 30% the right number going
forward or is maybe 25% you know
a better not excess money that
normally would have spilled into
the, um
Tax stabilization fund will spin
into the grow now going forward.
So I know that there's been
concerns about we leave the
session and we've got 32%
projected reserves and then you
come back in next session, and
they're like what happened last
year at 48%.
You know, some of that will be
transferred into other backup
reserve accounts for
expenditures and in future same
way that we've had in the past.
Um
But that said, that's that's
something as you're working on
your budget guidelines for the
summer to think about what what
is the new right reserve target
given all of the money that
we've socked away? Um in other
areas of the budget?
Child well being on page 10.
Historically your biggest
investment in early childhood
has been in child care
assistance.
Pre K is really caught up in a
significant way where you're
covering.
80 to 90% of four year olds in
some form of publicly financed,
um, preschool.
Whether it's our state, pre K.
Um
Whether it's head start.
We're heading rapidly towards
about half of three year olds.
Um, being enrolled in pre K, but
childcare assistance is and you
can see the enrollment figures
coming out of the depths of the
pandemic is has increased to
about 25,000.
Um people.
That program.
From an investment standpoint,
our research has suggested
doesn't yield good educational
outcome. Long term educational
outcomes like pre K does.
But as an income support
strategy.
Relieving the burden on, um
You know, working in Mexicans
for childcare?
It does do that.
I would caution that this
particular program
In terms of like a performance
trend. The one thing that we've
seen consistently is the cost
per per child has dramatically
increased every year.
Um and so
Rightly questioning what you're
getting for that, Um increase is
something that will continue to
to hit on
CYFD
When you look in the back of
this, uh, budget document,
you'll see that their general
fund increase is flat for next
year.
And you might your constituents
are already asking you because
you're asking me.
You know, what did we do about
child Protective services? Well,
you did make significant
investments, but you did it
through the grow.
He said.
You know the federal government
is willing to pay for
At the Medicaid match. You know,
75%.
For community based
Um, investments in, uh Children
and families.
But the states gotta have a plan
and we don't have an approved
plan. In fact, our plan was
rejected Last fall, There's been
another one submitted.
But you put forward the matching
money to implement those
evidence based strategies.
As well as investments in the
workforce for who's going to be
delivering the services through
through child protective
services.
Um as well as who's gonna
represent and how they're gonna
represent families. Um, if
Children, uh, need to be removed
From care on education on page
13 Like I said, Uh, big
investments are fully funding
the
Um
Extended learning programs that
you all had enacted in house
Bill 130 the year the year
before.
Uh, that's the K 12 plus
programs.
The additional education reforms
involve AC T overwhelming
support for investments in
These types of initiatives both
in K 12 as well as in higher
education.
Community schools. Early
literacy you'll hear from the
secretary later this morning on
the plans for, um, the summer
literacy program, which was the
executive signature, Um,
Education initiative.
Um, this interim
And on page 14. You can see on
the graph on the left.
Um
The significant investments that
that the state has been making.
Um, for
Um, at risk students in higher
education.
Um
Increases for the instruction in
general, as well as RPSP.
Totaling over $43 million almost
$44 million.
Again, creating the
Um, higher education, financial
aid and, um, trust fund.
When we look at the out years
you've set aside non recurring
money.
To cover 100% of tuition for
lottery recipients you've
committed to covering 100% for
tuition and fees for op
opportunity. Scholarship people
coming back to school.
Um
So big investment in in making
sure that, uh,
College access is affordable.
When we look in the out years,
we saw that there was a
liability where you're going to
be having to continue to put
general fund money in
Uh, to cover those commitments
that we made.
As a state.
It was an evaluation that our
staff did last interim that
said.
Putting money into financial
aid. It's not adding new money
necessarily to institutions
budgets.
But it's also
Um, if you let them do what
We let them do when we
implemented lottery.
They saw it as a new revenue
stream and increased tuition at
a disproportionate rate.
To the point that we couldn't
afford to provide.
And an evidence based strategy
was to
Trying to put money into G. So
you've taken off by basically
setting up this trust fund.
You've relieved that liability
of choosing between funding
Uh, tuition.
In choosing the funding basic
operations that are rewarded
through performance.
And
Covered that through the
endowment.
Now your choice is going forward
are
Let's potentially keep tuition
flat and you'll hear from the
secretary of higher education
going forward because this
endowment cannot afford for
tuition increases.
To increase above 3.5%.
And they really do need to stay
flat, and we've got that
covered.
But institutions need
They've got cost increases.
And you could
Provide those
Uh, funding for those cost
increases through the ING and a
reformed funding formula. Um,
that prioritizes, Uh more
funding through, uh,
performance.
So that's a a big strategy for
higher education on slide 16.
A lot of discussion last
interim about, uh, what ifs.
But if we are not 50th and
graduation rates
Uh, what would it take?
Uh, for six year graduation rate
it take less than 1000 students
to graduate within six years.
To be at the national average.
And you've got data here on both
the sixth year and the four year
graduation.
Lot big, non recurring
investments totaling almost $200
million in higher education,
including in basic
infrastructure, where we're
seeing a lot of capital requests
coming through that are
basically heavy maintenance.
Let's take that off the table.
We need to do something. You're
gonna get a report at this
meeting.
About the the implications of
online learning.
And where we're at with, uh,
capital planning, um, for higher
education in terms of, uh,
facility needs.
Um, and the excess capacity we
have both in our physical
infrastructure as well as our
teaching infrastructure, but
then investments in, um,
workforce development,
particularly in health care, um,
that you can see throughout
here.
On page 18 health and
communities.
Huge increases in spending
outlays for Medicaid since
FY 19.
Significant increases in
enrollment during Covid, because
People could not be removed even
if they didn't qualify for
Medicaid. So enrollment
ballooned from
You know 836,000 to almost a
million people in New Mexico at
the height, uh, coming out of
the pandemic in FY 23.
But spending outlays have, um,
increased to over $10 billion,
the new health Care Authority
Department that you all created,
uh, two sessions ago and put
together the budget for next
year.
Will be at $12 billion
Significantly larger than your
entire general fund budget.
You added staff to LC to help
oversee that. We've already
hired all of them. We're hitting
the ground running in terms of
like helping you all oversee.
Um
The health and human services
sector, which, when you include
all the federal funds is our
largest cost center, um in
government.
So the Medicaid budget
Some of those increases are
driven by one changes in revenue
where we're having to backfill,
Uh, federal funds.
But they're also driven in large
part by the policy decisions
you've been making for investing
in provider rate increases. Um,
across the board.
So
Heavy oversight in whether those
provider rate increases are
gonna result in the desired
better access to care. Um, going
forward will be important.
On page 20.
You all enacted a new, um
Legislation.
That will inject another $1.1
billion into our hospital
system.
And basically
A number of years ago, You
implemented a a program that
allowed
Uh, nursing homes to put up
The matching revenue for quality
investments that would then be
matched with federal funds.
In many respects that same
strategy was adopted for
hospitals, Um, to be able to
have hospitals put up
You know, basically a quality
fee that will then be matched
with a federal funds.
And be reinjected back into the
hospitals.
The reason you're able to do
this is the federal government's
changed its stance.
On what's called the upper
payment limit.
For Medicaid.
In the past, the federal
government has said Medicaid
can't pay more than X.
Um, And usually it was
benchmarked to Medicare.
In this case, the federal
government has said.
Medicaid can pay what the
commercial
Uh, market is paying for
hospital services.
Which in some cases in New
Mexico is 300% of of huge
difference in terms of like
again If you're
Hair panel is made up of 45% of
Medicaid and Medicaid's paying
below cost, But now Medicaid's
gonna pay
What commercial payers are
paying, which is a very small
segment.
That's a potential game changer
in terms of
What our hospital landscape
could look like.
Recommending a significant
amount of time be set aside for
oversight on how that's gonna
work.
Because if the reason why
Commercial rates are so high.
it's because Medicaid rates were
so low.
Now we're gonna pay higher. Is
there an opportunity for
commercial rates and rate
relief?
To happen for, uh, people in
that sector. Just so happens all
of your public employees are
paying commercial rates.
For hospital services through
GST and the public School
insurance Authority, as well as
private sector employers that
are buying commercial rates.
And is that money gonna result
in something demonstrably
different in terms of the types
of services that hospitals are
able to offer and the quality of
care going forward, So a lot of
work on oversight?
Um, when it comes to that
Skip over Mr Chairman to page
25.
A number of investments in K,
12, higher education and human
capital.
Uh, improving that.
As well as in workforce. Uh,
solutions Department, uh,
through the growth funding.
But I want to turn your
attention to this. This labor
force participation rates and
we'll have a number of different
ways, and you've already seen it
In some activity. Reports of
measuring
Uh, measuring this, but New
Mexico is historically had a low
number percentage of people
participating in the workforce.
That's either people working or
they're looking for work that
would be deemed un they would be
on the unemployment rules.
So we've we've always lagged the
national average.
But
Coming out of the great
recession.
Our labor force participation
rates dropped significantly.
And they didn't recover.
For a decade.
And then right before the, uh,
covid. They were starting to to
come back up, but nowhere near
before pre recession and then
you know, Covid hit and we had
12 to 14% unemployment again.
Those are people participating
in the labor force, but a huge
number just totally dropped out.
Many of them would come back and
we're we're at
A pre covid numbers, but nowhere
near the levels of pretty great
recession.
That is acting as a drag on our
economy of being able to find
labor.
In some cases.
We've got issues with a changing
demographic, where some of the
labor force participation
Numbers, Uh, include
Uh, you that are under 24.
Maybe there's not as many high
school students that are
participating in the labor force
is what was happening before.
Maybe we've got a higher
proportion of our population
that can retire early because it
includes a population that's up
to age 64.
But when we look at the prime
working age, there's still
100,000 new Mexicans that if we
were to be at the national
average
There's 100,000 less new
Mexicans that were otherwise in
the labor force. So who are
they?
How were they surviving off of
income transfers and other types
of of, uh, welfare payments?
And what skills do they need in
order to re enter the labor
force and and help our economy
grow? That's that's a major
issue. Um, going forward.
Mr Chairman. I'd like to wrap up
on two items. One is, uh, page
35.
So
Another big cash infusion for
capital outlay, uh, using
General fund rather than
bonding.
Big state agency projects
included things like, um
The forensic unit up in Las
Vegas. Another round of funding
They're still outstanding
Questions for, you know, paying
off the the bonds for Clayton as
a way of of saving money in the
operating budget for
corrections.
You'll hear a report. Um, this
meeting on our Capitol outlay
and how much money is in the
pipeline and how many projects
Project completion is gonna be
critical and prioritizing that
going forward. Um there is an
interesting statistic that
you'll hear in that Capitol
report about how many projects
that were funded this session
right out of the gate.
Are way underfunded and are are
gonna be stranded.
So that's gonna be really
critical. When it comes to
capital outlay. You've been
making huge investments out of
the General fund into our roads,
and you can see that on the
drive up here from Albuquerque.
Hopefully LA Bajada will be
open.
Uh, here shortly, and
You know, there's
Then.
There's tangible, clear evidence
that those investments are
paying off. I mean the roads
from Albuquerque to Santa Fe and
much different and better
condition than it was.
Um, five years ago.
There hasn't been investments
all over the state. There was a
big
Push this last session to get
over the hump of some of these
major
Um, maintenance projects. Um,
and give the Transportation
Department authority to issue
another 320 million in short
term severance tax bonds. Those
are outlined on page 35.
That's intended to help
stabilize
Um and get over the hump for
those major maintenance
projects.
Um, for the department, so they
don't need to keep coming and
asking for those general fund
infusions. So we'll see how that
works out. We're gonna recommend
that DOT be part of the legis
that process.
Um, going forward to see what
kind of progress we're making on
Different investments. But, um,
those projects are outlined, Um
that you all passed this last
session on page 35.
Finally, Mr Chairman, Natural
resources over the past couple
of years has been a major new
investment source. Dollar wise,
like when compared to things
like Medicaid. It's not that big
but percentage wise, huge.
A percentage increases whether
it's in on page 36 in the
Environment department.
Going back before the solvency
period. You know, 100 and 81%
increase disproportionate
increases in investments in
natural resources agencies and
oversight, including IMT and
89%.
Um, state engineer 100 and 13.
Finally, Mr Chairman.
This document is a really good
reference for you, Um, during
the interim, so there's
obviously
Uh, narrative.
Going up to about page 48, But
the appendices I use all interim
And these include
The high levels that your
appropriations committees get.
What did we find in the humans
in the healthcare Authority,
Department and income support
program.
It will have that information
for you. Uh, what did we do in
higher education for RP SPS at
UN M. It will have that
information for you.
What did we assume for oil
prices and the revenue estimate
It will have that information
for you. So good reference
material for you. Um when
questions come up, but either
way, feel free to give me a call
and I'll look it up for you.
But, um with that, Mr Chairman,
I'd be happy to answer any
question The vetoes.
So there's a memo that's
outlined. Uh
Before you as well.
Let's ask questions right here
real quick, and then we'll move
to the Vitos because that'll be
a different conversation.
Senator Gonzalez your first
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And
thank you, Charles. Uh, very
nice report.
Um, I was just gonna make a
comment, Um
On the Monday's edition of the
journal.
It was a very nice article on
the investment dollars for
education in general fund to top
2 Billion in FY 25.
There's a lot of I would ask the
members to maybe they might
wanna look at that.
Um, Charles? Uh, the the part
that I would ask is some
When it comes to
Recurring.
And I don't know if we have it
somewhere here.
That we could see the growth for
the maybe at least the last five
years.
And and where I'm going with
this, Mr Chairman, is that, um
When it comes to our other
members that do not serve on C.
You know, it's it's sort of hard
to put the picture of a
Recurring.
You know, and then also with our
reserves number
And if you look at them
You know what I look at is like
Three years or four years ago.
30% of the reserves is a very
different number from today's
30%.
You know, And I think that's the
hard part that, uh, we have to.
really, You know, I always feel
very cautious and very careful
that how we work with that. And,
uh, if we had that, you know, I
think that he might be a little
bit easier to present in in our
part, too.
To our other members that, uh,
do not serve on the lfc.
Um, now with that on page eight
When you look at the operating
reserves
So as our recurring
Increases.
Should
Are operating reserves also
increase more. That's correct.
Yes, sir. Mister, So the dollar
figure
As you grow your recurring
budget. If you're target is 30%,
the dollar figure will will
grow.
Because so
I just feel like, um
To be in a discussion and
someone says more than that.
Without seeing the facts, you
know of how it really
The effects that we have with
our overall what our reserves
should be at.
Right, Mr Chairman, and and as
you
Adopt your budget guidelines
this summer.
That's usually where you have a
conversation. About what the
reserve target. Um should be.
And that's largely been over the
past couple of years informed by
the stress testing of, you know,
asking what if
What if the economy had a
moderate recession? What if
Oil prices and production went
down by X amount.
How much money in
In cash on hand would you need
To be able to cover that revenue
shortfall before you needed to,
like, take other kinds of, um,
solvency actions, including
reducing agency budgets.
And so those amounts
A
30% have been informed by that
stress testing.
Going forward. You've set aside
money outside of reserves.
That aren't counted as towards
it.
But her statute
Are in effect, backups.
Where you've said
We don't have enough money.
In our reserves, go ahead and
reach into the early childhood
Trust fund or the grow and pull
that out.
And so there's a question as we
look.
When you look at the cash
balance report that will see um
tomorrow.
There's so much money in these
other funds.
The question is, is 30% still
the the right number when we
have a more expansive view of of
What money is available to avoid
needing to cut a very well thank
you, Charles. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you, Charles. For your, uh
Presentation. I just have a
couple of quick comments. Um
When I do support us keeping and
maintaining high reserves, Uh,
I do think that when we're
looking at
You know the possible downturns.
I think that's something and I
and I know that with your staff
that we need to look at that.
But I, I would be one that would
support us not going below the
30.
If possible, even, um
Increasing that, um
Amount.
Mr Chairman I. I have a couple
of, uh
Questions, and this is really
just kind of a comment as far as
You know, the legislator is
appropriators and as far as
policymakers
Many of the things that actually
we pass legislation. We passed
policy and then through rule and
through something else, There's
additional costs that are added
to this budget that we passed,
which again is somewhat a burden
to us, and so
That's gonna be something that I
I really want to to emphasize is
that you know
We spend our time here we we set
the policy. We go through all
these interims.
Um
It's a little frustrating, Mr
chairman when then we come back,
and there's
Um
Expenses, or there's other costs
that are outside of the
authority. Or I wish that the of
the, um Legislature
And the last thing uh, actually,
two more things.
Uh, Mr Chairman when we're
looking at
We talk about the department and
agency reports and we looked at
report cards and one of the
things I'm looking at is the the
percentage of gross for some of
these agencies. And then when we
look at our report card, one of
the things I'm gonna be
interested in is
How are they doing as far as
their targeted measures? And how
are they with this? Because
You know, we we we try to We try
to fund these things and II. I
am all for finding people.
But before they go through any
kind of expansion, we need to
make sure that they currently
doing what we're asking of them
now.
And the last thing I'm gonna
say, uh, Mr Chairman is
regarding the public schools
something that I do think that
is something we need to take a
look at may have been an
unintended consequence.
But with the increase, Uh,
insurance costs of 16% and the
3%
Uh, raises that were were for
the staff. It has been
communicated that many of our
districts actually are seeing
AAA deficit in the funding. So,
Yeah, Mr Chairman and Charles
that something that we can take
a look at to see if that's
If that's a unique thing with
the, uh, public schools, and
with that gap, or if we need to
take a look at on a greater
scale, Uh and make an
adjustment, So thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Um, thank you, mr Chair.
So going back to the, uh
Medical, health care and
Medicaid. Medicaid is a colossal
portion of our budget.
And even more colossal when you
throw in all of the the federal
money
And
Yet we have this huge, huge
problem, so I wanna just throw
out here. Uh, I know that
currently bringing in new, uh,
family practice, docs is almost
impossible.
Um
Is the same with specialty.
They're just not coming in here,
and I think there's a couple of
reasons for that one is
How do they get paid?
And, uh so Medi, uh, Medicaid.
Um, we've raised that trying to
deal with that. But the reality
is is that commercial insurance
is always in every other state
and even in New Mexico made up
that gap.
So you could easily take a third
of your patients as Medicaid
patients if the other two thirds
were were commercial insurance
and the dollars and yet we keep
trying to grow Medicaid, which I
think is
Counterproductive and I think we
try to grow up because Oh, it's
a 4 to 1 match, so let's do
more.
But we have to
Fix the problem, and I don't
think throwing more money at
Medicaid is is the real answer
there.
Uh, the other part of our, uh
uh, medical problem is med Mao,
which
We changed and then unchanged a
little bit. And now we don't
know where we are. I think that
that's a concern for the
doctors. Where are we gonna go?
Next? Are we gonna make it more
difficult? Are we gonna make
health care practitioners to be
here? So those aren't exactly
Budget items, but they certainly
affect our budget if we can
figure that out, and so you
touched on. Uh uh
Workforce participation.
And clearly we're we're less
than the nation in in so
In the bigger scheme of things.
How do we get people to work?
How do we get people to work
that have commercial insurance?
And then I think we solve a ton
of our problems in the medical
world, probably other things,
but
I don't know.
Any ideas on how to
How to turn that.
Whole thing around.
Well, I think
You know, the
Investments in the desire of the
state to wanna improve its
educational outcomes is step one
for increased labor force
participation.
The the people with the
Lowest levels are participation
are the ones that have the least
amount of educational
experience. So you're gonna
have, um, proposed, um, projects
to look at people that have been
involved in a criminal justice
system in some form or fashion.
Um and what they're reentry
processes.
Very low labor force
participation.
Um, because of
Um, lack of education as well as
Being involved in the criminal
justice system and being able to
the employment sector is
probably a major challenge that
will be examining.
But there's also a skill
mismatch that, uh, research
suggests
That employers need a certain
skill set and people don't have
it. You've invested $60 million
over the next three years.
And industry recognized
certificate programs.
Um, to try to
Um, fix that skill mismatch.
Um, as well as CT investments in
K 12.
Um, so there's a number of
targeted investments that you've
been
Um
Making as a legislature.
Uh, to get at that whether those
are implemented well and whether
they result in their in the
outcomes that we want is gonna
be the subject of your overs.
So, Mr Chair. I think that what
he said, is really
Where we need to focus. So this
is not just medical. It's not
just crime. It's not just a
we're all tied together, and I
don't think that we focused on
Tying all this together.
In 100 and 14. So I'd like to
see us as as
As a committee as staff try to
figure out how that ties
together so fixing education is
not fixing education because it
might not still provide the the
skills that he's talked about.
So we've got to fix education,
so it provides the skills then
skills have to be turned into
labor participation, which has
to be turned into, uh,
commercial insurance, Uh, which
has to be turned into bringing
doctors in and and I think that
we've
We've cubby hold all of these
little things.
So can we make it?
A broader
Discussion as we go through this
So thank you, Mr Chair.
You are now the chair of
Medicaid and Medicare for LLC.
Representative Ellison.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh,
Thank you, Mr Chair.
I like how you introduced your
presentation.
By recording unprecedented
revenue growth.
And you know that I'm always
gonna push health counsels.
With as much money as that was
allocated to the new
Health care authority.
I think we should revisit it and
I would encourage my colleagues
on LFC to see if we can make
that a recurring expense because
that is our first line of
defense against health care in
the rural areas.
You mentioned that one of the
biggest problems that New Mexico
faces is the child well being.
I think one way to address that
is through the health care
system.
That is my first comment, Um,
last week, um
Thursday and Friday.
We had all 26 members of the
governor's Cabinet visit the
four Corners area.
First they visited Farmington
and then the next day On Friday,
they visited Shiprock.
I think it was an eye opener for
a lot of these secretaries.
Uh, some of the comments that I
remember hearing was, uh, the
aging at long term secretary.
She visited the senior center in
my District, a couple of senior
centers, and they couldn't
believe the difference that the
rural area has in relation to
the urban areas.
So they pledged to support us
more in the rural areas.
The second comet came from the
secretary of New Mexico DOT.
He says. I couldn't believe how
many potholes you have on the
road between here and Santa Fe.
And then his second comment
That's disturbing is I can't
believe how poor of a job we did
in patching the potholes.
Starting tomorrow morning. We're
gonna do a better job and try to
fix up all the P potholes.
Why is it that
We always
Don't do the job right the first
time but always have the time to
do it better the second time.
So with a budget of 1.28
billion, I think the highway
department truly can do a better
job the first time.
And also, uh, the last comment
when they were doing their
resource fair was, uh
The Department of Higher
Education told me that they
appreciated my efforts for
always pushing the dual credit
so that my comments, uh
Mister chair and mister silly.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Representative Thompson.
Thank you, Mr Chair, and thank
you, Charles. I just as a member
and former chair of the Tobacco
settlement committee. Thank you
for removing that, Um
The money that that that we got
for programs depended on whether
the tobacco companies were able
to, uh not give us our fair
share based on and I believe
they're litigating like at least
10 years ago. Still you now so
in what would happen is when we
didn't get the money from the
tobacco companies. Our budget
was cut and so cessation and
prevention programs were cut
like in the middle of the year,
The funding ran out and
The big The big push for the
tobacco committee is to keep you
from beginning, uh, nicotine use
ever so thank you so much for
making that a true permanent
fund. It is much appreciated.
Thank you.
Represented, Uh, Armstrong.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And
thank you, Charles. For the, uh,
the overview of that, Um uh,
with DOH being one of the large
entities that we fund
Can you tell me? Uh, if you know
anything about
The, uh
The DH is establishing a new
policy, eliminating overtime pay
for nonunion health care workers
in 24 7 facilities and going to
comp time for nonunion.
Can you tell me? Do you know
about this? And what's happening
in that with that? So in your
state facilities, they're all
funded.
Whether it's the Behavioral
Health Institute up in Las
Vegas, the veterans home down in
TRC, or
The long term care facility and
Sil Silver City. They're all
funded through one program in
DOH.
And that program since I've
started at C.
Has been almost every other year
needing supplementals.
And over the past 10 years, the
amount of external revenue that
they've been bringing in
Has been declining.
There's
Some of the facilities are half
empty.
You've got big fiscal
challenges. This year, they came
in for a supplemental request
that you funded
Um, they came in for a
deficiency where they overs
spent their budget. Uh, last
fiscal year, which you funded.
And so as part of some of their
cost controls, they were finding
that
Um
In particular nurses at some of
the facilities that were in
supervisory positions, whether
they were
They
Um, because they were actual
supervisors or put there to give
Get bigger raises, Uh, salaries
is in is in question.
But they're not covered by the
union. Um, collective bargaining
agreement.
And they sought to as part of
their cost containment strategy
to curtail the amount of
overtime for those particular
staff and convert it to comp
time.
We've since the session, um, met
with the department and gone
through another round of, uh,
budget projections.
With the supplemental.
And with new revenues that have
materialized that were not known
to us during the session. They
now have a surplus of over $5
million.
Um, it will be reverting money.
It's my understanding that they
will be allowing people to cash
out. Uh, some of that comp time.
Uh, because if you're
As one of the facilities told us
if we're short staffed, and
people are having to work it
Because we're short staffed.
Giving somebody
Comp time.
That they can never use doesn't
really help with our staffing
situation. I think the
department is has recognized
that and and I think that
there's if it hasn't already
been changed it. It's been
communicated to us that there
will be a
Another policy pivot, uh, as
well as moving people back into
classified positions if they
were moved into union cover
positions if they were moved out
for salary adjustment, per
that's my understanding and
working with the department.
Well, I thank you for that,
Charles and thank you, Mr
Chairman, but I just need people
to know that this is happening
and that this is a real issue at
the Veterans home in Tier C when
you have a hospital that can pay
a lot more than the veterans
home, they're losing.
Uh, employees to the to the
hospital, and they're both need.
They're needed in both. But I
just, You know, I'm just an
advocate for fairness, and I
just don't think that they're
being fair to the taxpayers or
to their employees. And I just
want people to know about that.
I we did send a letter. Um, and
they say there's more to the
story, but I still haven't
received an email on the what?
What it is and so I just need
people to be aware of that. And
thank you for that information.
The other question I have is on
the pre K.
Um
Did.
We fund through, Um, Public
Education department.
Pre K. Is it funded through pre
K, uh, public education or
through E CDC E. So you fund pre
K through E CD.
For both, Uh public schools as
well as community providers and
for the public schools, E CE CD
flows that money.
To public schools through the
public Education Department. Did
we take into account the rule
mandate to make sure that those
are covered?
Pre pre K, uh, mister Chairman.
Um, is not subject to those
same, uh, requirements as K 12.
And you had already funded and
extended school year.
Uh, proposal in last year's
budget, Um for pre K.
OK, And do we have, uh are there
Co-pays still in place? Uh, Mr
Chairman and and Charles on, Um
On childcare.
For childcare. Co-pays had been,
uh, waived by the department and
they're looking at, uh,
reinstituting those and then I
need to check with my staff to
see where they're at with that.
Um, that was a major expense of
of waiving those, particularly
for higher income people. You
know you can qualify for
childcare assistance up to 400
It was
That was a significant
additional higher income
individuals.
Um, do we track How many people
Mr chairman that that utilize
the childcare? Um
The free childcare and the
waived copay.
Uh, do we know how many of them
have jobs?
Mr Chairman. Uh, Representative,
Yes, by policy. You either need
to be working, or, um, in school
in order to call. Thank you for
that. And, uh, just one last,
Uh, note is I agree with
senators on the unemployment and
the labor participation. It's
just off.
Uh, especially in that age
group. Uh, that we that we
actually watch and, um
Uh, I'm still waiting. Uh,
Mister Chairman and and Charles
for a response to my invitation
for the governor and the PE D
secretary to come ride the bus
and catcher County. I've had no
response whatsoever, and I'll be
sure and ask, Senator. Um uh
Arsenio about that. So thank
you, Mr Chairman.
Thank you, Uh, center Woods.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Uh, a quick comment on the, uh
Labor problem and the skill
sets. Uh, this chair and Charles
does the workforce solution
actually.
Reach out to employers.
To see what skill sets they're
needing. I know that they have
the the program set the the
computer set in there.
Uh, And does that
Does that ever translate over to
our training facilities?
Who are and do we target?
Those areas.
And those universities, those
community colleges.
Mister chairman, Senator when it
comes to
Workforce investment, um,
Federal funding? Yes, the local,
uh, workforce boards are
required to try to match up the
training that they're paying.
Paying for.
Uh, to meet the needs of, uh,
the local employers.
Um so that they're not
Training people for jobs that
the local economy doesn't
support.
Um, when it comes to
A broader, higher education.
There's they're supposed to be
coordinations around that, but
there's not as uh, direct
requirements as the the federal
funds for Workforce training and
you'll you'll get a report. Um,
on that topic, um, shortly as
well and and somewhere in some
of the emails that I've read
recently, they made some
statement that 50 per cent of
the college graduates are
actually working at jobs below.
Uh, the medium college graduate
level and, uh, income.
Um
Does that state anything about
state of New Mexico?
Uh, employment. Are we
Are we just not offering jobs?
Are we getting degrees and
things that don't have jobs tied
to
Mr Chairman, There's a large and
national conversation going on
about
Um, the value proposition of
higher education and a a lot of
that.
Conversation from my perspective
is in.
Um, proprietary schools and
whether they're offering
Um
Very high cost.
Uh, programs that lead to better
employment gains in New Mexico.
I would. I would suggest that
Um, where our skill level is
like any higher education
outcomes are gonna be
beneficial. But there could be
some cases where you're you're
getting a degree in
That doesn't have as well of,
uh, employment prospects as
other ones.
Um, but those tend to be fairly
small in in our state from um,
our research.
Of the the other thing that I'd
like to talk about, and this may
be the wrong place.
The wrong time of the day may be
in another spot.
But our, uh, New Mexico Summer
reading program.
Can we talk about that now? Mr
Chair?
You're gonna get an update from
the secretary on what the plans
are for that, Uh, signature
initiative of the then the other
topic I'd like to talk about.
On Page eight.
Uh, the
Fourth paragraph up from the
bottom.
The fourth paragraph from the
top.
When it talks about the marriage
penalty, right?
And
You know, uh, when I first got
on the budget committee it was
talked about
The ultimate
The of a budget.
Was policy.
And here is one policy. It's
very well explains.
That if you're married in New
Mexico
We're penalizing you.
Could we
Think about some kind of
Legislation to at least crack
that one little problem.
Um, Mr Chair.
It. It seems as though we we try
to bring the family unit in to
everything we're doing here.
And this is directly
counteractive to that the next
paragraph.
It. It talks about wind, solar
hydroelectric energy. And how do
we transition from fossil fuels?
To another form of revenue for
the state and
Of course, the only thing that I
can personally think of, uh, to
possibly
Uh,
That enough new Mexicans, you
To tax
Is electricity.
And and it's the only thing
that, uh
Is, is, uh
Viable to to bring in the
revenue to the state.
And I'm not talking about just,
you know.
Carving out renewables. I mean,
renewables is just a piece of
the of the puzzle.
But it's just electricity as a
whole.
And
Have we ever thought about doing
a study to see what
What kind of
Tax increase.
On a particular commodity, such
as electricity.
How much that would take to
offset the oil and gas revenues
to the state.
Mister chairman, Senator, it
would be astronomical.
The the amount of revenue
That oil and gas indirect
Um, tax
Tax was 40% of the General fund
budget.
Yeah.
And it that's providing huge tax
relief.
To support the level of
government financing in our
state.
That would otherwise come from.
Well, you know, individual
taxpayers.
You hit the key right there.
We're taxing a very small group.
Uh, may be very large
corporations.
Uh, a very small group to bring
this money into the state.
But to replace that income.
We're gonna have to tax the heck
out of some other group.
To keep our
Standard of living, so to speak.
And I just
Maybe I'm maybe you're the wrong
group to to do that study. Maybe
I should ask the utility
industry to do that study.
Because
If the if the momentum
Keeps going.
That we've got going right now.
With with with lawsuits and and
everything else going on you.
You hear about them? A new one
filed in the state of New Mexico
to say you're not doing enough
to shut down oil and gas and
you're harming my health.
We need to figure out what
commodity what's produced in New
Mexico.
To to do that. And of course, we
could do that on personal income
tax. Right? But, uh uh uh, it it
has to be something that
everybody uses in order to
spread.
Spread the pain.
Across the state.
And electricity is the only
thing that I can think of.
That we would have that
everybody uses to to create
enough wealth enough revenue.
Two finance state
So
I know that's a very, uh
Unpopular subject at the moment.
But, uh, I think it needs to be
considered. And with that, Mr
Chair. Uh uh, I give up. Thank
you.
Representative Syriana.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Um first
thank you. For all your hard
work. You and your staff. You
You guys are amazing.
Um, I wanna turn to page 36
natural resources. You said that
we had great. We are doing great
in funding. Um
But didn't we have several years
where we were underfunded? So
now we're just kind of catching
up to where we need to be. And
we're not quite there yet to
fund um I nerd and ED and the
state engineer so that they can
do the jobs. We're asking them
to do. Well, Mr Chairman,
representative
These are agencies that
Have a lot of other funding
streams. Besides the general
fund, so in terms of
prioritizing increases from the
general fund, you've done that
over the past couple of
Couple of years.
Like in the case of environment.
I would argue that their fee
revenue is probably insufficient
to help cover some of what their
costs are.
And there's been a reluctance
To increase that.
And within the executive in
particular.
Um
And they they're complicated,
Um, agency when it comes to all
the different, um
Other state funds that they're
bringing in
But
My main point is that you've
prioritized these agencies over
the past couple of years that
are coming at a disproportionate
rate to the rest of of
government recognizing, um, the
Legislature's desire to
Do better in that particular
area, and now that they're not
needing to use
The revenue for some of, UM
Like the pay increases as an
example.
The question I think for the
committee is
How will that result in better
regulatory oversight.
Um And how will you know that
that's resulting in in better
outcomes that they're not having
to use their fee revenue to
cover, uh, certain salary and,
um
Director. So so.
Based on their scorecard as we
go through this over the year to
see where they're at, Are they
inspecting? Hopefully we can get
that done. Hopefully we we are,
um
Funding them at the level they
need to keep ours. Our people,
our land, our air and our water
safe and clean and doing it
represents small.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Director. So first,
uh, Mr Chair Directors Lee. You
said it. I think it is. This may
have been the most successful
LFC endorsed legislation session
that we've certainly I've been a
part of
Is that your sense as well?
Uh, it was significant. Yes,
sir. Mr. Chairman,
Representative. Small. Great.
Thank thank you, Mr Chair and
directors and I think it's
something like, uh, six out of
the seven bills or seven out of
the eight. Of course. One was
vetoed. Uh, the rest were and Mr
Chair directors. Those bills. As
you noted, many of them and also
in preceding years. Many of our
budget, Uh, efforts have really
been focused on responsibly,
Managing, uh, this really
Robust, very robust incoming
revenue source. Would you agree?
Mr Chair Directors? Yes, sir.
Great, Mr Chair Directors and
you really highlighted I wanna
briefly dive in, Um
We have created.
Probably upwards of well at this
point, Mr Chair Director S Lee,
when we count the early
childhood trust fund we've
created.
And auxiliary pool of would you
say six plus billion dollars
that's growing as early
childhood trust fund grows.
Easily. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman.
Great. Mr. Chair Directors that
I. I hadn't really put it
together until this
conversation That's remarkable.
In auxiliary reserve funds. In
addition to our direct reserves,
and you noted, we kept operating
reserve stronger this year.
We have, uh, well over half of
our recurring budget backed up,
and that's going to continue to
grow, at least for the next
several years without any action
on our part as early child.
So, Mr Chair director, So I
think it follows
Very naturally.
And quite appropriately, then we
must consider the appropriate
reserve target for the state.
And that, frankly, is no longer
30%.
We've eclipsed through really
solid bipartisan work in many
other areas, but to be able to
do the innovative sort of work,
whether at the expendable trust
Or, um, in many of the other
areas, health care in
particular, we will you know,
there that additional capacity
is gonna be necessary.
Uh, Mr Chair director. So, um,
is that something? Obviously,
there'll be a lot of committee
discussion as is appropriate.
That's something that Yeah, you
all, uh and your team of
economists and other policy
professionals. I'm sure the
executive you know, invite the
executive to participate as
well. You'll be bringing forward
more information in that space
as we as we move forward.
Yes, sir. And I think where
those conversations will occur
as
Um, as you're developing your
budget guidelines and direction
for staff on how to
Um, those would
Formally. They typically begin
in July. But, um, they can start
earlier than that. Informally,
Great. And then when you get the
revenue estimate, that's when
you typically adopt those budget
guidelines. OK, Fantastic. Thank
thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Director. Um, finally, just
briefly. A as it relates to the,
um We'll go into this a lot more
later. But as it relates to, um
Uh, replacement revenue.
Would you? It seems well does
not seem electricity generation
and severing of minerals in this
case, oil and gas
Fundamentally different. Would
you agree? Mister Chair and
director Celi. OK, I certainly
do as well. I think there are
two different
Entirely different. One is a
resource that belongs to the
state of New Mexico. Overall
were incredibly benefited by
that resource.
Briefly on that Mr Chair
director. So
I think it's become my
understanding over time that
even as we reduce the burning of
fossil fuels, uh, the, um those
the the, um
Where's it gonna escape me? But
the the that oil and natural gas
in an unburned form and it's
uses across a wide array of
socially and economically
valuable products.
That continues even as there is
less
Um
Uh, burning of fossil fuels for
direct energy. Would you agree,
Mister Chair directors. Le
Uh,
Mr Chairman, representative.
I think over the long haul.
There's a lot of different uses
for oil that's going to be
pulled out of the ground and
Thank you, Mr Chair Director. I
think I share. I think we That's
great for us to be talking
about, because, uh, as we
decarbonize and necessarily so
It the some of these resources
and their viability, um in in
their sort of economic utility
for our state. Uh uh, really, I
think remains as we, uh, burn
them less.
They're still going to be
increasingly valuable in other
forms.
And Mr Chair directors. We
cannot fall into this sort of
false comparison of one revenue
source for another.
Um, it there are two
fundamentally different
propositions and the reliable,
affordable energy produced by
renewable sources. Uh, is
Frankly, a key component for low
cost reliable electricity That's
gonna be central to all of the
job and that, you know, growing
out on the West Mesa there with
Senator Padilla and all around
the state.
Um, So anyway, uh, with that,
Thank you very much. Mr. Thank
you. We'll We'll kind of wrap
this up. Uh, Charles real
quickly in in, We know we're
running a deficit in the tax
package of 100 and 61 reflected
on Page four.
Well, the revenue changes.
In my mind is 260 million, cause
I'm looking in the in the out
years.
So you you tack that onto the
The increased spending in the
budget.
Um, you know, and combine those,
and you had a target of trying
to not grow.
Recurring expenses, either
through the tax code or through
the budget.
Had a certain you know, we we
said 10 to 15% was unaffordable
You you came in a little bit
below that.
But
To be able to afford.
You know another 7% 6% growth.
You know, before we're doing
budgets of 3%, you know that
date.
Just just gets accelerated. The
more tax cuts you do, the more
spending you do today, The
faster you get to
Doing 3% budget growth.
So the 161 on on Page four in
that chart.
Reflects a shortfall.
A negative 161.
That's just a reduction in in
revenue.
The net is like basically gonna
be about flat.
Um, going forward, year over
year.
OK?
I think it you know, as we move
forward in
I guess we're gonna call this
the LOC Bible right for every
reference in in LFC that you
that you wanna know and and
including the appendix, and the
vetoes in the center was maybe
get you some bills on July 18th
during the special session for
What he wants to do. Um, as we
move forward.
I think we put 8.3 billion
roughly in in funds. This
And, um, that tracking member in
this year as we move through the
the College fund, right, That's
almost a billion dollars right
park money and other funds. The
total was right.
Well, the, uh
Trust fund was the biggest one
that you made legislative action
to to park. Their legacy fund
was another 300 million. Um
The other funds that you've set
up.
That are, uh, flowing into
permanent funds were kind of
automatic. There weren't like
separate legislation like to
grow was, you know, 500 million
Um, that you set aside.
Then there's money flowing
automatically because of
previous legi legislation at
early childhood Trust fund in
Severance Tax Permanent fund.
So significant set asides for
future spending. Yes, sir. I
mean, I mean it.
This is the first time we we
really had a true set of books
because we've taken tobacco
settlement out, right?
That's great, and we've true
really chewed up our true books.
And what's interesting to me
that we need to look at this
session is how much is it gonna
change our bond rating, right?
Are they gonna look at us and
say OK, Well, you have a 30%
reserve that you have
$50 billion worth of funds
parked over here, right that can
be included or drafted in in in
time of need.
How are they gonna count for
those funds? You know, on the
front of our financial is
30,000,000,030% is roughly $30
million, right?
And and if we have another 50
million, I mean, parked over
here that's accessible.
How I mean this. This is where
we really gain traction because
if we're a AA, right if we can
move to AA plus
And then maybe the AAA our cost
of borrowing money in our
How the state is looked at to
loan money in paying back money
will change completely
different the bills that were
passed this session really set
us up.
Um, for us to in 2050 to to not
have to bond capital out anymore
to do it completely within cash.
I. It's a slow move, but it it's
in the right direction. Right?
And so we were. We're telling
ourselves in New Mexico if
anything happens in oil and gas,
we we've set these things up.
We have enough money parked over
here and enough money parked
over there to to to ride the
The whale or or the fall or the
For a short period of time, a a
long period of time, but a short
period of time.
I don't know how that's gonna be
the number one thing I wanna
look at is how do how do we
increase our
Our cost to borrow money in our
our cost of money, But, uh, I
know we had we're running
behind, Um
Did you want me to go quickly
over
the toes? The memo? The other
thing is I know we're gonna talk
about I think she's here. The
lady is here.
Uh, insurance healthcare. Arpa
is another thing I didn't see is
ARPA listed in this book and in
can we get a as we go forward?
Maybe we'll do that in the work
plan of, uh, it's already done.
I think, um, the oversight of
all of the non recurring
appropriations, including ARPA
will be a A major issue. This
interim Mr Chairman.
Let's run through the the vetoes
real quick. So on the vetoes, Mr
Chairman
The power of the of the partial
veto authority under the
Constitution for the governor.
Is the power to destroy.
That's cut.
It's not the power
To alter
The power to enlarge the power
to change.
When you see things in a veto
message, saying, this doesn't
allow us a certain amount of
flexibility that we want. That
should be a
You know a little red flag going
up.
There's lots of vetos throughout
House Bill two, ur in and year
out.
That violate those
Those those provisions that the
Supreme Court is has already
laid out as as doctrine for our
state.
Vetoing San Juan.
County out of an appropriation.
Something potentially challenge,
Um, invalid veto.
Because it's enlarging.
And changing.
Where the agency can spend the
budget as a as an example. So
there was a number of different,
um, vetoes throughout this
session that we as staff will
flag as as
Um, problematic.
There's a smaller subset that we
are flagging.
That we think the money
Should actually go away if they
if the veto was properly
executed.
And shouldn't be in fact
budgeted and so I'll go.
Over a couple of those
With you real quick, and the the
the legal analysis is in the me
is in the memo.
But there's a couple of cases.
Where you said a reasonable
condition.
On an appropriation.
Contingent on
And it was in the case of
General Services Department.
There's a statute that, says the
General Services Department may
charge a building use fee
basically cover the cost.
Of its maintenance. Well, the
General Services Department came
in and asked for money for, um,
General fund money for
maintenance cost and the the
Legislature passed a provision
that said, OK, here's some money
for that.
Contingent on you ponying up
money from agencies through
using the statute that we've
already passed.
Well, the executive veto the
language for the contingency.
So we think the all of the money
should go away. You don't get to
just
Get rid of the contingency and
keep the money.
So that's in a recurring, Um
Section four.
The other is if you're vetoing
something that's in the clause
becomes
What I what I term nonsensical.
there was the sentence doesn't
make any
Sense.
And in this case
The corrections Department. You
all provided, um, an earmark of
funding for private prison per
diem rate increases.
Uh, their contracts call for
certain
Um, adjustments to their, um,
annual contracts.
Well. The executive vetoed the
purpose of the of the
appropriation.
So it has no purpose.
It makes no sense.
So we think that 800,000
Dollars properly vetoed should
also go away. Then there were
appropriations.
Might be a little bit more
controversial, but
You appropriated 100 and 20
Million to DOT for
transportation. Uh, heavy
maintenance.
And like you do, uh, with the
rest of the budget, you earmark
some of it for specific
purposes, And in this case, you
earmarked 36 million
For contracting.
Um, for certain disadvantaged
businesses.
That the department's required
to do under federal law already
you basically said what you're
already doing with your federal
money we want you to do with the
state appropriation to the tune
of $36 million. Well, the
executive struck
The the $36 million and the
purpose of it.
So in our mind that money should
also go away and and not be
budgeted and unfortunately
But that's uh what the action
was.
There was also, um
The same type of earmark for, um
I think it was
For beautification.
Um
That would also need to go away.
Finally, there was a an
appropriation for, um, the
public education department.
Uh, where you specified out of
$5 million appropriation.
4 million should go for
educational services through the
Navajo Nation and 1 million for
the
Uh, Zuni Pueblo.
And the governor struck.
The earmarked money.
And basically saying that the
executive wanted to determine
how much money each of those
entities gets.
But the executive doesn't have
the power to legislate you do
You have the power to
appropriate.
So in in our view that entire
appropriation because she struck
the money should go away again,
Unfortunately, but
Nonetheless, that's that's the
position. We're we're taking a
staff you'll see in the council
service. Um
A summary of of of the vetoes,
They'll take a, um, the stance
that
A lot more money should not be
budgeted.
But in terms of trying to
reconcile with D FA
On items. We, um flagged all of
those same items and and agree
with counsel service that there
are a number of different,
problematic vetoes, but in terms
of trying to score them for
this, the for the sake of, um
our financial, um, tracking
Um, we're identifying those ones
as staff that were we're
flagging. That should not be
budgeted.
And with that, Mr Chairman, I'd
be happy to answer any
questions.
Senator Rodriguez. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank you, Charles.
For your, um, great presentation
and very specific and lots of
hard work. Thank you. Um, I have
a question. Um, clarify
something for me. Um, with
respect to the grow and the
performance measures that we had
put in there to be able to track
and have accountability for
those appropriations that we
wanted to do as pilot programs
or start ups or whatever they
would be to allow us to be able
to monitor that. See how they
And continue to fund them in the
future. If they are working, and
if they're not well, we could
hopefully all work together to
undo that.
My understanding in the past has
always been that the General
Accountability Act only or does
not apply to pilot programs.
It applies specifically to
funding other funding or
appropriations of other
programs. And so
My understanding of the vetoing
of that language was that, uh,
Apparently there was duplication
between the General
Accountability Act and the
language that we put in in the
grow program. Um
Is that the case, Charles? Um,
Mr Chairman, Senator.
The accountability in Government
Act applies to agencies
recurring and in the case of the
globe.
This is a new area where you
were trying to carve out
Some expectations for
performance.
So I didn't see
Uh, duplication.
Um, the veto itself.
To me is, um within what the
courts have ruled. She totally
destroyed those provisions.
Uh, didn't alter them or change
them just said we're not gonna
have performance measure
reporting that said informally,
we will work and reach out to D,
FA and the agencies to say, How
are you going to demonstrate?
To the Legislature that you
should
Get recurring funding in the
future for this and
If the if the response is we're
not that makes your job easier
to not fund them in the future.
Thank you. Thank you, Charles.
Thank you, Mr Chairman for that,
Um, that was my only question on
that because I thought, if if
that's what if that's a
rationale behind, um, vetoing
that, then do we have to do it
differently next year or or how
can we approach that to ensure
that we have accountability and
performance measures? Well, the
bill that you all ended up
passing on the grow, Mr
Chairman, Senator
Um, directs LFC staff and D FA.
To study the accountability in
government act and how to grow
would work and come back to you
all, uh, with recommendations
for next session.
The original introduced version
had a
And accountability framework.
Um, that was ultimately stripped
out of the bill, and I think the
intent of that provision is to
stay, go and work with the
executive and figure out what
this would look like on a go
forward basis and bring it back
to the full Legislature in the
60 Day session, which we plan to
do.
Thank you and Mr Chairman
Charles. It's my understanding
that approximately 25% of the
grow. The amount we put in grow
is what is anticipated to be
distributed. Uh, with the
current appropriation that we
have for next year, so Mister
chairman, there's two pieces of
grow.
One is you have set aside.
Money in the expendable trust
itself. 500 plus million at 25%
of that.
Will spin off and be available
for appropriation next session.
You set aside another 300, plus
million
In House Bill two of
appropriations that flowed
through the what was intended to
be at the parameters of the
accountability for grow both for
agencies as well as for member
directed, UM, Project cetera and
House Bill two. So more than 800
million set aside for, um,
testing out different ways of of
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you, Charles. And I say that
only because it seems even more
imperative that we figure out a
way to ensure that we have these
performance measures and the
accountability we sought during
Session if we already have plans
to distribute approx, correct,
So thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you, Charles.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
So
Last year, we discussed the fact
that the governor overs spent
certain budget items or the
executive branch. I shouldn't
say the governor. The executive
branch overs, spent certain
budget items.
And we didn't do anything about
it.
So the same thing happens this
year if we don't go to a court
of law
Then it just happens. There's we
have no other recourse, right?
It's it's a court of law
determines whether
Whether whether the executive
overs spent the budget
That's correct. Right? Well, Mr
Chairman, there's a
Um
Statute that it's a
Um
Crying to overspend your budget.
So unless somebody prosecutes
that
As a crime and determines who
overs spent it then.
Yes, it may result in an audit
finding where
My contention is like if you
have a deficiency appropriation.
Or deficiency even request.
And that deficiency was
discovered in your audit. Then
there should be like some
Form of a special audit to
determine
What lapse in internal controls
allowed for that overspending,
which is in violation of state
law.
And we we will be working on
Um, recommendations for
potential legislation for you to
consider around that this
interim and that's what I'm
getting at.
Mr Chair.
Should we always have to go to a
court of law?
To bring
An agency in compliance.
Uh, there's no other way we can
bring an agency in compliance.
Uh, under the
Statute we have today, other
than going
To to a court of law.
Um
Mr Chairman. That's correct, but
ideally, we would create
conditions.
That people wouldn't be allowed
to overspend because there's
Better internal controls or even
external controls like D FA
saying You can't cut this check
cause you don't have any revenue
to pay for it.
And not allow that check.
Sound like an ideal world,
Charles. Yes, sir. Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr Represent Dixon.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh, thank
you, Charles. Um, could you walk
me through? Um
The
Um
Options. The two remedies that
are described in the end note.
Uh, for improper vetoes. Um, the
memo says, uh, two remedies are
possible one
Entire appropriation amount is
not recognized and voided the
appropriation.
Or two. The agency implements
the reasonable contingency as
passed by the legislature.
So
How does that work? In
actuality, Mister Chairman?
What? What we have proposed is
Is an example for
The Corrections Department.
If
In their operating budget.
They indicated.
Um, to DF and C that they
intended to use the 800,000 that
you appropriated for private per
diem.
Rate increases.
As staff. We wouldn't object to
that we would see it as
complying.
The other alternative is that
They're operating budget when
they turned it in.
Was reduced by the $800,000. And
they wouldn't, uh, give the
money to the private prison
Prems.
We have a process of reviewing
the operating budgets when
they're submitted. This is
information that we would flag
for the agencies.
The special appropriations are a
little trickier because
They don't have the same May
1st, um
Deadline.
And we'd have to do more. Um
Have more diligent oversight and
and conversations with agencies
on how they intended to either
use the money or how they
whether they budgeted or not.
Um And so, mister Chair? Um,
Charles, um, so on May 1st,
who's responsible, then? So if
if FC has flagged for the agency
that you know, our intent is
that the money be spent this
way, but they don't have that
correct in their operating
budget, who is responsible for
not giving them that funding?
Well, that would be T, FA and
Frankly, the executive could
ignore this memo.
And unless they're challenged in
court.
Which is the case with all these
other things, that they would
implement it in the way that
they they saw fit the executive
in many of these cases will
argue that
The Legislature was
Essentially
Also violating the
constitutional provisions of
that the court has outlaid for
not micromanaging or or
infringing on the executive
management function.
And for many of these vetoes
that you see in the back
There's certainly a a gray area
as staff. You would argue that
there's not as much of a gray
area but in reality, they
they've argued that there is and
these particular cases that
we've outlined for for not
budgeting the money. We think
it's pretty clear that
You know, a nonsensical
appropriate originally intended.
Um, Mister Chair, Charles. So in
the past, what is the track
record for, um
Let's just say this
administration and D FA, um,
adhering to our requests.
Um, we had
One.
Instance with, uh
GSD
Uh, last session where they were
trying to say that the money
wasn't coming from the original
source of ARPA that they
ultimately didn't budget it led
to, you know a bigger deficit in
GST, but nonetheless, they they
Went along with that.
In prior administrations under
the Martinez administration, Uh,
legislature chose to take a
couple of cases to court where
she was striking, like
Out of the three digit number
one of the digits.
Clearly changing.
You know, sort of slam dunk
stuff.
Um
The
Uh, one of the premier cases and
case law on this is Culvers is
Carruthers.
Where the Legislature, um, chose
to sue over some partial vetoes,
and that's where the court came
back and said.
Your micromanaging by telling
A district attorney. They can't
spend a certain amount of money
on a certain parking garage
where it was, like, really the
legislatures in the weeds and
probably not a good challenge to
those particular vetoes and
And so it's a case by case basis
that basically the the courts
have ruled that they'll take
these up on. It's no hard and
fast rule. Um, thank you, Mr
Chair and Charles so
There's only so historically
with this administration.
This hasn't
Been an issue well not been
challenged.
Um
I
I think it just seems to me.
Do we? Well, do we have any
recourse after May 1st. So if if
we don't challenge the vetoes
the partial vetoes and D FA
doesn't agree with us on May 1st
What happens then?
The agency implements it as the
The vision of the executive, Um
and Mr Chair, Charles. So have
we missed a window of
opportunity to challenge it or
is that indefinite?
No, I don't believe he was
missed an That's why we're
bringing it to your attention
now.
Um, thank you. Um, thanks,
Charles. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you. Yeah. I mean, there's
every exact challenges, right?
Yes, sir. Mr. Chair. I mean,
challenge the this exec with
arpa, right?
Last year. The statutory
increases are three years ago
for health care, which cost us
100 and 50 million or forget
what the dollar amount was
right. That was our cost by that
her following the statute, the
executive right, correct and we
come to this, but I think bars
are even more dangerous.
Because the Legislature has
appropriated authority.
But they come in for a bar, and
they bar out to whatever they
want it to be.
Whether it's I a desk whether
it's buying headshots flooring
when the Legislature should be
appropriating office supplies
and
Whatever it is, a bars are
almost the same authority and we
have no objection right over.
Over bars to stop bars from
being transferred. Other than to
just say we object and
And slow them down for one week.
And so a as much money is out
there and as much money is on
spend in these agencies.
In your bar reports. I think
we're gonna go over bar reports
this time.
We will under miscellaneous
business, Mr Chairman and
Under the bars and there are
certain conditions you're
providing, stat. You're
providing authority in House
Bill two to move money between
categories. Whether you choose
to do that, in the future is is
is up to the next legislature.
Whether you choose to give a
Um, authority for an agency to
bring a certain amount of money.
in above what you appropriated
and House Bill two is
Is your purview.
There was a a veto where you had
a limitation for like the Racing
Commission to
Um
Bring in up to a half a million
dollars of a certain revenue and
they vetoed the half a million
dollars that one
We would look probably object to
any amount above the 500,000
vetoing, just, 500,000 says they
can bring in any amount and such
But the correction secretary has
done the same thing for numerous
years.
It is taking money out of the
budget and moved it to other
purposes. Instead of saying to
the Legislature, I need
operating capital for
maintenance and repairs, and
they come in at the end of the
year and say.
Oh, well, I'm gonna do this bar
and make these adjustments and
then they come to us and say,
Oh, we need more operating
capital. But then they're
barring out and they're playing
this shell game with the
Legislature at all points in
time and moving money in in the
appropriating it. We're not
appropriating it correctly, and
they're not asking for the
intended use. Correct. Mr.
Chairman, if you're seeing
things year in and year out
Where their surpluses in certain
categories and
Maybe not enough in other
categories. That's where you use
that information to say, Let's
put it in the right category, so
we don't need the paperwork of a
bar in the first place and right
sides, your budget that there
are agencies that need bars when
something happens, and you gotta
move money and and do that
adjustment, But this habit of
agencies that have over found
we've overfed their budgets
because they told us one bars
are gonna have to tighten up. I
mean, I think I talked about
that last year. I mean, the only
recourse we have is
We only objectional recourse to
that that LC has somebody has to
take it to court.
Right and filed a complaint.
Or
LOC also has the statutory
authority to bring someone in
them under oath and and ask them
if they're violating the
statute. And if that happens
then then somebody's gonna pick
up on the statute violation, and
I don't know who would Who would
look at that? I mean, if if
somebody admits that they're
violating the statute by
overspending their budget
Then I don't know who how that
would be reported. That's the
only other ways that I see that
you can
Stop the line item vetoes right,
striking in their appropriations
for the direction whatever it
is.
Or take him to court.
Have him come in and under oath
and admit that we shouldn't do
that, because some of these
Cabinet secretaries are
sometimes they have to do
things.
But
Uh, those are the only things
you can is a recourse for the
Legislature to do that.
And accountability. We did a lot
under Martinez.
Correct, Mr Chairman.
I think that's it another
questions we'll move on.
We're gonna try something.
Just to kind of keep us moving
quicker. So as we move through
this, uh, program evaluation for
Workforce solutions if we target
those questions for for
workforce solutions, right and
program evaluation.
And at the end of the day.
Let's just book a 30 minutes.
You know if it's a Medicaid
issue that you wanted
Catch up with clean up on or if
it's veto overrides, or whatever
the issue is, maybe catch that
clean up and let's just stay
right on the topic to try to get
there and then just make
yourself a list at the end of
the day, And if we gotta stay an
extra 30 minutes to do catch up
clean up with the staff to to
target things like we're hearing
right?
Then I think that might be more
efficient.
Um, Charles, real quick. Do you
wanna introduce your new staff?
OK?
Who's gonna start us off.
Allegra.
What T are we under?
I
Oh, yeah,
it'll be
Um separate and it looks like
that.
Good morning, Mr Chair. Members
of the committee. My name is
Doctor Lager. Hernandez, and I'm
a program evaluator with the
LFC.
Today. My colleague, Doctor
Sarah, roving and I will be
presenting an LFC program
evaluation focused on how to
improve New Mexico's workforce
participation.
Which you have in front of you
and looks like this.
First I would like to thank
Secretary Sarita Nayer, Rachel
Moskowitz and the rest of
Workforce solutions staff with
their outstanding collaboration
on this project.
Please turn to page one, and we
will get started with the
executive summary.
Previous LFC reports from 2016
and 2020 examine the function of
New Mexico's workforce system.
This report builds on that work,
asking what it would take in
terms of policy program
improvements to bring New
Mexico's labor force
participation rate up to the
national average.
Specifically, it emphasizes the
amount of statutory freedom that
exists around many of of our
entrenched workforce structures
and calls for creative,
innovative and evidence based
approaches rather than a passive
acceptance of the status quo.
Mr Chair members of the
committee. Page One explains
that in order to reach the
national average labor Force
participation rate, New Mexico
would need to employ an
additional 40,000 workers
between the ages of 2054 years
old.
This means that the state will
need to go beyond reaching
individuals actively looking for
work by additionally, targeting
people disengaged from the
workforce who face serious and
systematic barriers to reentry.
Though this population can be
difficult to serve this points
to proven evidence based
practices that work to increase
long term employment, raise
wages and create a ladder out of
poverty for our most vulnerable
populations.
This report scrutinizes the
effectiveness of the Workforce
Solutions Department in
mobilizing this disengaged
demographic finding the
department continues to rely on
an outdated model for connecting
employers and job seekers. At
the heart of this system is the
brick and mortar workforce
Connection Center, a vestige of
the great Depression when vast
numbers of unemployed Americans
sought jobs.
This report finds that the usage
of connection centers is down
and accessing basic career
services they provide does not
increase likelihood of finding
employment.
At the same time, the Workforce
Solutions Department has
struggled to serve certain at
risk populations with
significant barriers to
employment, including those
receiving reemployment services
and employment assessment.
And those receiving temporary
assistance for needy families.
Additionally, a fragmented
referral system hampers
enrollment and discourages
outcome tracking
This report offers
recommendations for improving
performance and increasing
accountability for programs
under the jurisdiction of
Workforce Solutions and the
state's four local workforce
development boards. It also
points to additional policy
tactics to ease the transition
of more new Mexicans into the
workforce.
Now, Mr Chair and members of the
committee. Page three describes
how New Mexico's labor force
participation rate is among the
lowest in the nation. New Mexico
ranks 44th in 2023 for
participation among prime age
working individuals or those
between the ages of F of 2054
years old.
This comes against a
considerable investment in
workforce related programs, a
2020 LC spotlight found that the
state spent $322 million on
workforce development and
training across state agencies.
Despite this considerable
investment, there are 206,000
able bodied, prime working age
people in New Mexico who are not
formally employed.
The one on Page three shows the
breakdown of this population
across gender Asian race while
disengagement in New Mexico is
relatively evenly distributed
across racial and ethnic groups,
The state's labor force
participation varies widely by
county as shown in Page four in
figure two
If you will. Now turn your
attention to chart one on page
four. You'll see that while male
labor force male workforce
participation in the state has
largely stagnated since 2010
female participation is up about
2% points overall and 12% points
for women with Children under
six in 2022, New Mexico, even
surpassed the national average
for this particular demographic
of women.
Not only that, but New Mexico
ranks fifth best among the
states for gender income
equality. This is important and
worth emphasizing, because the
state has made significant
recent investments in supports
to make it easier for women with
families to work. These data
strongly suggest the state's
targeted investments are paying
off. It is essential now that
the state turn its attention to
male participation, which
remains fixedly behind the
national average.
As you'll read on Page five.
Male disengagement has negative
effects on individual happiness
and productivity, family
formation and household income.
As you can observe. In chart
three men who are disengaged
from the labor force are not
filling their days with child
care and housework.
And are instead spending upwards
of eight hours a day on leisure
activities.
Education represents one avenue
for improving employment
outcomes.
I shown in Chart four on Page
six.
The gap between labor force
participation between New Mexico
and the rest of the United
States is smallest for those
with a bachelor's degree or
higher.
But I suggested later in their
report. There is a viable
strategy for improving
participation, regardless of
educational attainment, as
you'll read on pages five and
six higher participation,
improved societal outcomes
correlating with economic
growth, crime reduction and
higher per capita income.
The Workforce Solutions
Department is attempting
attempting to raise labor force
participation by reaching more
of the state's disengaged
population with new partnerships
and programming.
The new 2024 to 2028 statewide
plan for the federal workforce,
Innovation and Opportunity Act
or
Includes the strategic goal to
increase year over year labor
force participation, rates and
economic prosperity for
disengaged and difficult to
reach New Mexicans.
Certain programs within Wola are
administered by the state's four
local workforce development
boards, whose regions are
depicted on Page six in figure
three
While others are overseen by the
higher Education Department and
the Public Education Department
in conjunction in conjunction
with the New Mexico Commission
for the Blind.
WSD administers. We O a basic
career services better known as
Wagner Pizer.
As you can see on Page eight in
table one.
Under We O at the state receives
about $5.5 million to find
Wagner PR.
These services have no
eligibility requirements
attached and are administered
directly by the Workforce
Solutions Department, making it
possible to standardize services
statewide.
Wagner Pizer is the oldest part
of Leola created 91 years ago as
part of the new deal to
establish a nationwide network
of job centers.
These job centers are the
precursors of today's one Stop
Workforce Connection centers
which bring together we all
partners and staff in a single
facility.
Today. There are 26 Workforce
connection centers operating
across New Mexico.
As shown in Page nine on Chart
five annual usage of these
centers found in the wake of the
pandemic when many users
switched to online services.
Workforce. Connection centers
are primarily serving members of
the unemployed population who
are actively looking for work
and clients participating in
certain state programs are
mandated or strongly
incentivized to use services.
If work for solutions one to
achieve its goal of reaching
disengaged New Mexicans it will
need to extend its audience
beyond these populations and
pull in individuals who are
currently uninterested in
working.
As we turn to page 13 of the
report.
You will see that this reports
first finding is as follows
Workforce Connection centers are
underutilized and have limited
impact on employment outcomes.
Workforce. Connection centers
are designed as one stop centers
that bring together multiple Leo
a partners upon entering a
connection center. Clients can
receive basic career services
such as resume help job
assistance and access to
resource centers with funds, fax
machines and computers. They can
also be screened for the
eligibility based programs
administered by local workforce
boards.
Nationwide, the number of
workforce connection centers
fell 30% since 2007
Meanwhile, New Mexico backed
this trend by adding more
connection centers, turning your
attention to chart eight on page
13. You will see that New Mexico
has significantly more
connection centers per capita
than its southwester neighbors.
The most critical analysis from
this chapter, though, shows that
after receiving basic career
services at a Workforce
connection center does not lead
to improved employment outcomes
through a matching comparison of
employment outcomes of
individuals in New Mexico, who
received unemployment insurance
and did not go to connection
center with those who did. This
report shows that accessing a
connection center has no effect
on the likelihood of employment.
Additionally, as shown on Page
14 and Table two
Many connection centers
throughout the state are
severely underutilized, with 10
centers receiving five or fewer
clients each day in the first
half of fiscal year, 24
Even when clients of workforce
centers attain employment after
receiving services, the average
wage earned by these clients is
$16.59 per hour about $5 above
minimum wage, which is not
enough for some people,
especially those with foot
families to fully transition off
of governmental income supports.
Given these outcomes, it is
hardly surprising that New
Mexico's Wagner PR program
consistently rakes in the bottom
fifth of metrics of employment
and earnings as listed on page
14.
Difficulties with workforce
centers are also reflected in
Workforce Solutions. Annual
customer survey, which shows
that nearly 30% of respondents
were not able to find employment
related resources they were
looking for.
Chart nine on page 16
demonstrates that the most
common complaint was that staff
were unavailable, which
undercuts the purpose of having
brick and mortar centers with
regular hours.
Currently, most of the
connection centers owned by the
state are incurring high
maintenance costs constructed
mostly in the 19 sixties. These
buildings are rapidly
deteriorating, imposing
potential health and safety
risks to users.
Additionally, as shown in
figures nine and 10 on page 17
outdated office design and
malfunctioning technology
systems make it even more
difficult for connection centers
to staff to provide quality
customer service. Finally, if
you turn to page 18
You will see that we all create
substantial freedom for local
boards to shape how workforce
services reach the public
Physical connection centers are
but one possibility.
A 2015 research brief
commissioned by the US
Department of Labor recommended
that local boards move from
thinking of their regions as a
stem of connection centers to
networked access points for
customer services, using mobile
vans, roving outreach teams and
unstaffed community access
points such as libraries, though
these practices are already
growing in certain parts of New
Mexico, a concerted statewide
long term strategy could ensure
that appropriate and adaptive
resources are flexibly dis
While I workforce staff members
to make a great greater impact.
I will now turn things over to
doctor roving, who will discuss
the rest of the report.
Thank you, Doctor Hernandez, Mr
Chair and members of the
committee as we advance on to
the next chapter on page 20. You
will read that the Workforce
Solutions Department needs to
improve adoption and
implementation of evidence based
practices to better serve at
risk communities.
Given the goal of workforce
solutions to employ disengaged
and difficult to reach new
Mexicans. This chapter presents
case studies of how the agency
has handled working with two
distinct populations that
present unique challenges and
opportunities. Those receiving
reemployment services and
employment assessment
abbreviated Rosia.
And work eligible people
receiving temporary assistance
for needy families or TANF.
New Mexico works as a
partnership of the health care
authorities in some income
support division, the Workforce
Solutions Department and the
State Workforce Board.
Its primary goal is to help work
eligible TANF recipients to
become employed and transition
from income supports to earned
income.
It does this hypothetically by
providing case management and
career services to any work
eligible TANF recipients along
with referrals into two
subsidized employment programs,
career link and wage subsidy.
Careering. Participants work
with private employers 20 hours
each week, while wage subsidy
participants work with
government agencies full time.
Until recently, New Mexico works
was administered by an external
contractor.
In 2021, the health Care
authority signed a general
Services agreement transferring
administration of New Mexico
works to work for solutions.
As part of this agreement,
Workforce Solutions receives
upwards of $12 million in tan of
transfers each year to oversee
New Mexico works employment
programs.
But as you can see on page 21
In charts nine and 10.
Outcomes for wage subsidy and
especially career link plummeted
after workforce took over the
contract.
As seen in chart 11 problems
with these programs begin in the
referral system. Very few work
eligible clients are being
referred into these programs by
Workforce Solutions.
Please turn with me now to page
22.
Where you'll see the cost per
successful outcome have
skyrocketed for the New Mexico
works programs, especially for
career length.
In fiscal year. 23 Workforce
Solutions spent $2.7 million in
TANF transfers to find
unsubsidized employment for just
five participants. That is over
half a million dollars per
successful outcome.
Even more upsettingly. These
participants are only earning an
average wage of 1360 an hour.
just a dollar 60 above minimum
wage.
The agency will likely tell you
that these programs are not the
main focus of New Mexico works.
yet millions of federal dollars
are still being spent on them
with very little to show.
In response to these poor
outcomes, the health care
authority has placed workforce
solutions on an improvement
action plan.
Well, the immediate issues
within these programs should be
addressed in this report
provides recommendations to that
effect. There is still potential
to rethink these subsidized
employment models in a more
profound way.
Lenient federal policies around
TANF work requirements create
substantial leeway for workforce
This report recommends looking
to successful evidence based
examples such as San Francisco's
Step Forward program, which is
described in a call out box on
page 23.
Tennis ls come to New Mexico as
a block grant, which creates a
lot of flexibility on how these
funds are expended and what
programs or direct assistance
they support.
One notable area of progress
toward a dressing root causes
with New Mexico. Work's
performance is the work of the
Allied Case Management
Institute.
Over the past few months,
Workforce Solutions has pulled
together all of its partners and
stakeholders to design a model
of a dynamic, unified cross
agency referral system.
The institute has produced a
referral framework, the model
for which can be seen on page 25
and figure 11.
Which, if implemented properly,
promises to vastly reduce staff
administrative burden while
improving referral rates and
outcomes tracking
This is a model of interagency
collaboration and design based
thinking that could be
profitably applied to many of
the issues cited in this report.
Such a system would also likely
produce benefits for RIA
Rosin is a voluntary evidence
based federal program that
provides case management to
recipients of unemployment
insurance. Typically, those
flagged as being most at risk
for, um, exhausting their
benefits. It has been shown to
shorten the duration of time
spent receiving unemployment
insurance when implemented
rigorously.
Despite making considerable
progress in program outcomes
prior to the pandemic, New
Mexico's rec program today is
hampered by uneven
implementation at the local
level, inadequate outcomes
tracking and insufficient
adoption of evidence based
strategies to improve
performance.
Outcomes very dramatically by
local workforce Connections,
center policies and staff as
seen on Page 28 in chart 16,
While some connection centers
are enrolling a high percentage
of unemployment recipients in
RIA others have not enrolled any
over the past year, perhaps most
concerning one of the offices
that has entirely ceased
enrollment explained that there
is simply nowhere in their
cramped and aging office to work
with clients.
With new federal mandates to
devote a percentage of roil
funds to evaluation. New Mexico
now has the opportunity to
investigate which strategies and
services most effectively
improve client outcomes in the
state.
If you will follow me now to
page 30.
You will find the final major
finding of this report.
Which is that state supports
have improved employment
outcomes, but some new Mexicans
are still left behind.
Well, Workforce Solutions is the
agency primarily responsible for
ensuring that disengaged
individuals re enter the labor
force. Other stakeholders also
have opportunities to facilitate
workforce participation.
As we heard in the background of
this report. New Mexico's recent
policies are making it easier
for mothers with young Children
to re enter the workforce.
However non custodial and
childless workers are still
being left behind by these
policies and expansion of the
state's working families tax
credit Following the model
currently implemented in the
District of Columbia could help
ease the transition to earned
income to workers within this
category, costing the state
likely between 12 million and
$20 million a year.
An expansion of state or of the
state earned income tax credit
in New York state that was
designed specifically for non
custodial parents showed
statistically significant
effects in getting more men back
into the workforce and
increasing the number of full
and on time child support
payments.
This expansion could help soften
what is sometimes called the
benefits Cliff.
In New Mexico. Several income
support programs have similar
cutoffs based on earned income,
making it difficult for some
earners to make enough to render
employment financially viable.
Finally, this report suggests
that a deeper understanding of
the nature of engagement in New
Mexico might help inform
policies and programming moving
forward.
Last year after Louisiana
surveyed its disengaged
population, researchers were
able to recommend targeted
policy adjustments to best
address the unique cultural and
historical challenges faced by
that state.
And lastly, states like North
Carolina that excel in both
workforce development and
business climate have found ways
to tighten the integration
between economic development and
workforce cultivation.
The co ordination between the
economic Development Department
and Workforce Solutions has
improved more strategic
integration and alignment of
goals promises better outcomes
long
Mr Chair members of the
committee if you return to page
two of this evaluation, you will
find the key recommendations of
this report.
The Workforce Solutions
Department should set concrete
quantitative intermediary goals
for improvement of the New
Mexico Works program with a
focus on career link.
The local workforce Development
Board should work
collaboratively with each other
workforce solutions in the state
Workforce Board to re evaluate
Workforce Connection centers is
the primary access points for
services.
And finally, the Legislature
should consider a targeted
expansion of the state's working
families, tax credit to non
custodial parents and childless
workers to facilitate the
reemployment transition for at
risk. New Mexicans. Thank you
very much, Mr Chair members of
the committee. We will now turn
things over to secretary NYR for
representation for the
presentation from the Workforce
Solutions Department.
Thank you.
Uh, I wanna start by thinking
this LFC team. Uh, Allegra,
Sarah Mika and our um standard
budget analyst Rachel. Uh, we
got a great team on this. It was
a really collaborative process.
Um we really came to respect the
integrity with which they looked
at our data and were open to to
our point of view on things. So
I really appreciative that also,
thank you to my group. Rachel
Moskowitz in our division
directors, my deputy Secretary
Marcos, Martinez and Rachel are
both here today. Um, because
it's a lot of work for our
agencies as well.
Um, I'm gonna talk today a
little bit about the data and
then a little bit about, um, the
differences that we have on this
report, and um and then some
opportunities for collaboration.
Uh, my response starts on page
36 of the version of the report
that you have, and I think, um,
if you notice the way that we
tried to do this is on page 37
and going over to page 38 we
list all the recommendations
that we agree with, which is
almost all of the
recommendations, and they're
sorted by
The ones that we've started, and
you'll note that in already
underway and whether we have
funding is in that third column
and you I've sorted them so you
can see the ones that haven't
gotten off the dime yet, and we
can kind of focus on those.
So
Moving to my next. Uh do I do
this manual? Yes, OK, great.
So slide number two. I know this
committee really loves the
numbers, so I'm gonna give you
just a few more to in addition
to what's in the report, um,
just wanted to know that the
labor force participation rate
does, um, has improved since
2022. We've seen a little bit of
stabilization in that increase,
and that's uh, a cause for
concern. It's something we want
to look at. Um, but we have seen
improvements. Um, since the last
data that's really cited in this
report.
Moving on to slide three. Those
of you who have been through a
lot of my presentations now, I
This is my favorite. Um metric
that we keep this is the we call
it the estimated employment gap.
It's not like an official Bureau
of labor statistics. Uh, number
but the blue line shows you the
number of, um estimated job
openings in the state and the
orange line shows you the number
of people who are unemployed and
looking for work. Um, so when
that orange line is on top, it
means we have more people
looking for work than
Have jobs available, but you'll
see that right around 2021.
Those lines crossed each other.
And this is the pain that you
and I hear about every day in
our community is from our
businesses. This is their pain
point right here. Can't find the
workers, and this doesn't even
speak to the skills mismatch or
any of the other issues within
this gap. This is like, Let's
pretend everybody was perfectly
matched for every job. We would
still have this problem. And
this is why Labor force
participation is an issue. Um,
but again, you can see this is
getting better. So when I
Reported. The stat. The gap was
28 was 38,000. Now the gap is
down to 23,000 and a lot of that
has to do with people entering
the labor force and meeting the
needs of those jobs. Um,
completely agree with the LFC
analysis on how many people
would come off the bench if we
had a a comparable labor force
participation rate to other
states. But if we had 40,000 new
workers in the state, we would
probably have about 17,000 of
them being unemployed. So we
wanna keep an eye on this stat
so that we're matching.
Supply and demand. That's really
the goal. So this is what I
found to be the the most helpful
analogy for people who hate
sports analogies. I apologize,
But, um, this, I think is the
easiest way to understand why
the labor force participation is
is, um, a an issue.
So if you look at the field,
that's kind of what I consider
the people who have jobs.
They're on the field. They're
playing the game we've got in
the state. Um as of the end of
2022. We had 850,000 and change
And as the end of 2023, we've
got 872,900 so that that is a
positive change. More people on
the field is good.
Um, we do note that some of
those people are what we call
involuntarily part time, which
means they'd like to work full
time. But they're only working
part time for whatever reason,
they can't find the work or
they're not qualified, and that
number is also there for you.
You can see that number has gone
up.
Um Then you have what? I call
the bench. These are the people
who are unemployed. But they're
looking for work. And you can
see that, Um the bench has gone
down. So it's 38,500 at the end
of 2022 and then, uh, 36,000 and
change on at the end of 2023,
and they also included there the
percentage of those populations
that are on unemployment
insurance because you gotta
understand not everybody who's
in that category is received and
then our our problem population
Our target population are the
people who are in the stands.
And we need them to come down to
the bench or we need them to
come down to the field. This is
our major challenge, right? And
and the people who are kind of
higher up in the stands, Um, are
the ones that are harder to
reach? So we've got about 100
and 70,000 folks at the at the
end of 2023, who were not in the
labor force in that same age
that the LFC looked at 25 to 54
and then survey data shows us
that, um 100 and 56,500 of them
have stated that they don't want
a job now, and that's not
Necessarily a bad thing. They
could be a primary caregiver.
They could be retired. They
could be disabled. They could be
independently wealthy. They
could be doing all kinds of
other things. They don't want a
job now, Um 16,200 at the end of
2023 want a job but have not
looked. This is the population
That's really the focus for us
If you want to work, we want to
make sure that you understand we
can help you get from wanting to
look for a job to looking for a
job to having a job. We can
bring you down from the stands
to the bench to the fi
And then searching an available
Now that number has gone down,
which is good. It's down to
4700.
But again, you wanna see more
people come from the top of the
stands down to the lower parts
of the stands because then
they're just that much closer to
the bench. And if we look at
this next slide kind of shows
you the dynamics that happen
between the stand the bench in
the field. So, um, when you look
at the people who are
unemployed, but looking, um a
lot of them came from the field
to the bench, right. Like
they're just they're never up in
that problem population of the
stands. They are, um these are
the US DOL terms. I would never
call anybody
But the Department of Labor
calls them job losers and job
leavers. And, um, you can see
that That's the majority of
people who are looking for a
job. There are people who had a
job and they wanna go back to
another job.
Re entrance are folks who, um,
have looked for a job recently,
but they just haven't found one
yet. So again, they're the
closest to the bench. They're
the easiest to pull on to the
field and we see those numbers
have gone up, and that's a good
thing. Um, but the new entrance
is the number that we want to
see. Go up. These are the people
who are all the way at the top
of the stands. We don't have
records of them having had a job
before, and you can see that
about 3300 of them entered the
job market but didn't find a
job. Um as the date of these
numbers. January 2024.
Um, we need that. That's the
number that our department is
focused on. We need to get to
the top of the stands and get
those people, um in the labor
force and looking for work.
So those of you who have, um,
been around a while will
remember in the eighties and
nineties, this sort of business
analogy of NASA. I think faster,
better, cheaper, right? And then
the response was always. You
gotta choose to. Um, but the
reality is mostly, we don't get
the option to choose to. Uh,
what? What? The work of our
analysts of your analysts really
showed me was the that this is
truly the bind that we're in
right now. As a department, um
we wanna our equivalent of being
cheaper is we've got flat
federal funding, and that's
Is what it is every workforce
system in this in the country
faces this In terms of better we
want to reach those disengaged
populations. We want to get the
people at the top of the stands
and we want to get them down
onto the field. Um, and then we
also want higher performance,
right we want, um, we heard the
stats on Wagner Pizer. I'm not
happy with them on my
department's not happy with
them. But part of the challenge
for us is if you want to reach
those disengaged people if you
really want to get those
inactive people, then they're
gonna need more time and they're
gonna need more resources. So I
think we
We have settled in. This sort of
Venn diagram is kind of between
reaching and disengaged
populations and flat federal
funding. And what suffered is
our performance, and I think
that's really what came across
in this report. And the point
was well taken. Um so we got to
figure out a way with our
existing resources while still
reaching those difficult to
reach folks to get up into those
performance numbers. That's just
the heart of our struggle. And
again. I really appreciate the
the analysis.
Um so we, as I said, we agree
with the vast majority of the
recommendations, but I'm gonna
focus on a couple that we
disagreed with, and the first
was the workforce connection
centers.
Uh, we've considered these to be
a vital resource, especially
given the rural uh, nature of
our state and the number of
people who don't have access to
broadband. Um it's true that a
lot of states are going to
entirely online services, and
we're not. And, um, you know, I
just don't think it's the right
thing for our state. I don't
think it's the right thing for
those people at the top of the
stands, Um, reasonable people
can disagree, but that is just
not our philosophy. We're not
going to leave those
communities, um, stranded, and I
think both Senator Woods and
represent
And if Alison have talked about
the importance of the executive
branch, getting out into
community, and, um, we've done a
lot of that. And that is why
we're we are in these local
offices. Um
Speaking of which, I just wanna
put in a little plug, and thank
you, everybody who's come to our
road shows we've been in
Espanola, Silver City, Demming,
Clovis, Farmington and Shiprock.
Um, we saw a lot of you here a
lot of your colleagues who
aren't here today. I also showed
up. Uh, tomorrow I'll be in Taos
and and we get to connect with
you, Senator Gonzalez and then
may 7th I'll be in Gallup May
17th in Zuni and, uh, continuing
on in June all across the state.
So, um, our staff will reach out
to you when I'm gonna be nearby.
We'd love to see you there. It
means a lot to the businesses.
When we're there and what we do
in those states it when we do
those round tables is we bring
in the businesses from the
community and we listen. Um I
talked to them about what our
department does, and I give them
some tricks like to help with
the their pain points and, uh,
unemployment insurance and that
kind of thing, But then we
really listen to what they think
is the challenge in their
community. As Senator Woods had
suggested that we should be
doing and we've learned a lot
from that, including that we
need to have those workforce
connection centers in the
community, and it was just a
function of the scope of the
Report. Of course you you can't
look at everything in a report
like this, But this this report
did not look at the business
services provided in the
workforce Connection centers,
And so I did provide those
numbers for you in FY 23. We
served 7215 unique businesses in
our workforce connection
centers. Um, and in this year
we're already at 6337 year to
date. Um, There's more
information in my response that
goes, um, office by office and
shows you this, but this is just
one of the reasons that we
continue to think.
Those workforce connection
centers are really important
because that's where we connect
with businesses.
Um
It's also where we how's how's
our staff. So, as you know, we
do not have, um, the option for
remote work in the state at this
point in time, so in order to
have that presence in the field
communities, I need a place for
them to work, and that's another
important function of the
workforce. Connection Centers,
um, completely agree that things
like mobile vans, outreach work
with the libraries as necessary
it the home base for that work
in these rural communities is
very much the workforce
connection centers. Um,
incidentally, we're doing a
partnership with the tribal
libraries now.
To put our resources in those
places. So again, not
disagreeing with, um, the need
to do more outreach. Just trying
to sort of explain that this is
how we do it. Um, also just want
to note that pre apprenticeship
apprenticeship U. I claims and
tax in each one. A and farm
worker programs are also
headquartered out of these
workforce connection centers.
Um, now that said, there's a lot
of, um, good analysis in the
report about the condition of
the centers. Um, we try to make
modest requests for capital
every year. Uh, as I go around
And see them that some of them
kind of break my heart. I would
love to S to see a great
investment in them. But, um,
also understand that that you
wanna see more performance
before from us before we do
that, And and we the other point
of disagreement that we had, um
was is minor, but it was on the
tan of performance and again
don't disagree with a lot of the
criticism because we are with in
a corrective action plan with
the health care authority. Um I
Deputy Secretary Ochoa is here
in in. We have been working very
closely with them to achieve all
the things that
That our analysts talked about
today, so they were all points
that were well taken, um, but
also wanted to point out that
unsubsidized employment is
really what we're looking to get
to eventually, right. Subsidized
employment is just a step
towards getting you to a real
job that no one's paying, uh,
your employer to have you there.
You're just there. You've earned
that job and and you're gonna
keep it in the long term.
And our unsubsidized employment
rates have gone up
significantly since, uh, our
department took over the
contract and you can see those
numbers there and they're also
in the report, but we now have
an extremely high level of
unsubsidized employment, and
that's a good thing. But as uh,
the doctors talked about earlier
today. We do need to
fundamentally rethink the model
If subsidized. Employment is
not. We're not doing it well,
and it's not getting the effects
we need, and it's not really
speaking to the labor market. At
this moment. We do need to re
And and completely agree with
what they said there.
Also just wanted to point out.
This is from a report that you
all did earlier on, um,
benefits. Enrollment. That
really when we look at these
benefit recipients, they are,
um, working at much higher
levels than the general
population. And so, um, if we're
looking to this population as
sort of part of the problem of
labor force participation, I
think, um your analysis of that
shows that maybe maybe not so
much, um, that there are
definitely other populations who
are not receiving these benefits
who are working at much lower
rates than, uh,
These folks are so our biggest
challenge, of course, is why why
are people not participating in
the labor Force and I? I brought
this, um, data out. This is a
federal data. It's United States
wide. It's not
Uh, specific to New Mexico, but
the question was posed to people
who were available for work but
haven't searched in four weeks.
Why not? And they were only
given a few specific options
Right? So you'll see the number
for discouraged, uh over job
prospects. The first bar is in
2023. The second part the red
One is 2024 green is men. Purple
is women and the light blue at
the end is the 25 to 54 that
target demographic.
And the first thing that that
should pop out to everyone is
most people answered Other and
if you've ever done a survey,
you know that if people answer
other you're not asking the
question, right? Right. And so
this is just really to point out
that the survey work and the
intense um, qualitative analysis
that that is recommended in this
report is really needed. Not
just in our state, but really
across the nation. We don't know
why people aren't working. Um,
the only other couple of things
to point out in this graph is,
um, women, you know, they do
seem to be participating in
training.
Uh, close to double at the rate
of men who who are in this
category. Um, so that's
something to look at and goes to
the point of of the need to
focus on men. Um, also, uh, love
that you highlighted the, uh,
childcare, the link between
child care and labor force
participation. I also wanted to
note that we now automatically
enroll 10 of participants in
that subsidized childcare, And
that's been another real key to
them getting, um, and then
you'll also see that ill health
and disability for these people
who are, um, available for work,
It's not maybe as much of a
I think has been represented
sometimes in the past. Um and,
uh, family responsibilities.
Also not as much of a problem
and that's you know, again
nationwide, so not even in our
state. So, uh, this the really
the point here is we got a lot
of work to do to understand. Uh
why?
And so I'm gonna turn now to in
my last slide. Um, which are the
recommendations that we agree
with, um, and require funding.
So, uh, one of them was to track
uh, a group of unemployment
insurance claimants to better
evaluate the outcomes of RESE, a
Now. One main point I wanna make
is, um when we talk about the
outcomes being the same for
people in RESE, A and the Gen
and the other UN unemployed
people or the outcomes being the
same for people in a workforce
Connections office and the
people who aren't
Um, that to us is an achievement
because we're working with the
most difficult to reach
populations, and we're getting
them to the same level as the
general population. Um, so it's
like, if you if you're focus is
on the toughest kids in your
class and you get them to the
same grade distribution as the
rest of the class. You would
consider that a win, right?
Maybe not enough of a win to to
get complacent, But we do
consider that a win. Um, so we
have tracked. Uh, we have done a
little work around tracking
unemployment claimants, but I'll
tell you, it's a It's a huge
Manual process. It's tedious
people pop in and out of these
records in a way that makes it
very difficult to draw
meaningful conclusions. Um, so
an investment in some of the
more advanced machine learning
type of software that could look
longitudinally at a much bigger
data set than any of our humans
can do, um, would be a really
good way to look at this kind of
report and you know, we are the
the sort of economics and
employment think tank for for
much of the state, and we don't
have those resources or funding
for those resources. Um
We also love the idea of
implementing a study focused on
the granular characteristics of
the disengaged population. Um,
we we're thinking this has to be
survey work. This has to be
calling people knocking on doors
and really doing that
qualitative work, and that's not
something that we're funded for,
Um, currently
And I point out that both of
these are one time expenditures.
We're not here to ask for
increases in base funding. We
know the situation with the
budget. Um, but, you know, we do
think that there's there's an
opportunity to to make some
investments. This is clearly
important to the Legislature.
And then, um, we we really agree
with revising the operating
model for New Mexico works and
we're in the process of doing
that.
And we are excited and and
really appreciate the
recognition of the Aligned Case
Management Institute. Um, we are
not funded to actually do the
work. We're just wanted to do
the analysis and that was
through. Um, you know, private
funding that we we got, Uh,
competitively, And so, um, we've
also hit some road bumps there
with the, uh, rehabilitation
services, the Nat National
organization that regulates DVR
has pushed back on on the DVR
being part of the Aligned case
management system. And, uh, I
I have all faith in our folks
and in being able to come
through those hurdles, But I
point that out just to say, um,
we we love the idea of everybody
working together and making it
easy. Um, it's not easy, though.
The feds really put up a lot of
roadblocks unintentionally to to
this type of collaboration, and
so we are in constant contact
with them. And, um, have a lot
of honest conversations about
how difficult that is for us,
But we're seeing it even right
here, um, with the align case
management that was highlighted
in the report, so I think
One of the recommendations was
to complete that by a date
certain. I think it was December
2025 and I'm just here to say
it's not gonna happen because we
don't have money and we don't
have, um, we don't have full,
uh, acceptance from the feds
yet, but I love that date as as
something that we would love to
try to meet, but we We need some
money to do that. So with that
I'm happy to stand for
questions.
Thank you, ma'am. So, uh,
representative Chapel.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Mr Chairman.
With thousands of people coming
across our southern border.
That are available that are
eligible for
Programs like 10.
Uh, that are not to my best
knowledge.
Uh, able to legally work.
How do you does that not skew
the numbers that you bring us.
And how do you account for that?
Uh, Mr Chair? Uh, Representative
Chatfield. It's a great
question. Um, you know, because
the numbers are largely survey
based in a lot of these figures,
I. I don't think that they're
hitting them particularly hard.
Um, so I don't think you're
seeing those populations here
and as it was just in the paper
a couple of days ago that new
Mexico actually has a a
decreasing migrant population.
Net. Um, And so I don't think
we're We're seeing that in these
numbers. I don't think they're
making the numbers wonky That
said there is a lot of work that
can be done in Colorado is doing
some
It because a lot of folks are
eligible for work authorization
if they come under temporary
protected status folks are are,
um, eligible for work
authorization, but there's a
real problem with people
understanding how to do it.
There's a huge problem with
delays, and there's a tremendous
application cost. I think it's
$495. It's crazy. So what
Colorado is doing is they have,
um they have a person dedicated
in their equivalent of our
department to trying to
negotiate some of these things
with the federal government to
try to expedite the
Patients for work authorization.
I mean, everybody wants these If
these folks are gonna be here,
everybody wants them to to be
able to do what they wanna do,
which is to work and be
productive and have good vibes.
Um, And so we, uh, actually just
received some, um competitive
funding to have a a fellow in
our office to look at these
options for the first time, and
that's really our goal is to try
to get um to try to play a role
in making it easier for people
who are eligible for work
authorization to get that
authorization and to get onto
the field.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. And
thank you.
Or your presentation of looking
at Page five.
And, uh, I guess the first part
that I'll start off is so
By all means. I don't mean this
negative, but, um
Could there be a better word
than job loser?
Uh, Mr Chair in, Um, Senator
Gonzalez. I completely agree.
That is the what the United
States Department of Labor who
generates this calls it and
that's why I have it in quotes.
But, um, yes, I do not like the
word job loser. I agree. That's
a bit different in New Mexico.
Maybe we can come up
with
with a different word. But I, I
just find that
Um, the other two parts that I
was gonna ask you some
How does it fit in?
Like sale or so was is looking
at four and who does that tie in
to
Placement work with something
like that.
Mr Chair and Senator Gonzalez.
Uh, really, if you look at the
the second slide number three,
That's where you see things like
the Los Alamos growth because
that blue line that's gone up so
much those job postings.
That's where you see the effect
of that, Um, that type of
growth. Uh, there's I think the
unemployment rate in Los Alamos
County is something like 1.4%.
So it's gonna take the region to
meet the needs of the lab. Uh,
we're doing. We do a lot of work
with them. Um, we have
representation in them on both
our state workforce board and on
the Northern Workforce Board. Um
they're doing work around
apprenticeship. They're
connected to CT. Uh, I think
we're we're trying to do
everything right? Um, but it is
putting a huge strain on the
other.
Lawyers in the area. They can't
meet the the wages of Los
Alamos. And so, um, you know,
just all to say we have to get
more people in the labor market.
I think that's consensus, um, to
be able to meet all those needs.
And Mr Chairman.
Uh, Los Alamos has been there
for a long time.
And now it's a little a little
bit easier for the outreach.
You know from further
Commune participating in working
there.
But the the meetings that I have
had with them
Everything is really, really
nice as they're going through
percent of what's coming, what
it is, and then you get to
housing.
And it just hits a ball that
they have had so many that just
up to that point
An application to work the in
one way or another.
And I know that the surrounding
community
And it's like something, you
know.
On the workforce part
Uh, the last part that I have,
and, uh, Secretary is I didn't
hear this men like you and M
Taos.
Is always wide wide open to
sponsoring or bringing programs
that would retool.
So that part I think if the
information if every would be it
would go further Small.
Colleges and chair center.
Gonzalez, Um completely agree
with you on housing. Um, when we
talk to our field staff, the
three barriers they talk about
is housing addiction, domestic
violence. That's what's keeping
people out of the workforce from
ground level. Um what
We are doing, um, in terms of
coordinating better with, uh,
the education world and I'm glad
you brought that up is, uh, it's
called sector strategies they're
identified in our statewide
plan, and what we do is we bring
together industry. We talk to
them about their needs and what
they projected needs are what
occupations are going to be in
demand, And then we send that
out to the educational
institutions and we say, OK,
where do you already have
programs and where might we need
you to build something new and
then we try to make those
pathways easier to navigate.
And then also to push them out
to everyone who's helping job
seekers. And we actually
yesterday, um, released the, uh,
building a strong broadband
workforce in New Mexico. This is
our first sector strategy. Um,
we brought together the
broadband, Um, industry back in
December with the help of the
chamber and the office of
Broadband Access and engagement.
So what this is, is basically,
um, a a compilation of all the
in demand jobs that are gonna
happen that are gonna be
available as this broadband
money hits.
And, uh, it's been a challenge
because nobody knows exactly
when it's gonna happen. And so,
um, you know, getting people in
the pipeline is is a little bit
tough there, but this is now in
the hands of all of our
educational partners, including
all of the the smaller campuses
of the larger, um, entities and,
uh, we're we're sending them a
form to say. Where do you have
programs? Where are we missing
them? Um, we'll do the same with
the CTE programs because we
completely recognize And I
think, Senator Woods. You
brought this up. We need more
coordinations with our
Partners and the sector
strategies are how to do it, and
we're we're on our way.
You know, Mr Chairman, the the
last part I have is so
In a in our area. There's a lot
of excitement with, uh
A lot of part time employment
with four service.
And to
The local part, and and I think
it's really outside.
At all. There's a lot of
contracts going on for the it's
exciting to see that more
training and more enforced
service. You know, I think that
we can also employ a lot of this
individuals.
Uh, Mr Chair, Senator Gonzalez
completely agree. We do have an
MOU to partner with, uh, the US
Forest service. Um, it it's not
always the fastest work that we
do, but, um, it's underway and
you know, you and I had spoken
about forest firefighting in the
in the US Forest Service. Um,
recently when we were in
regionals in Dallas, we heard
about a program in Alabama where
job corps is training. Um, you
know the wildland fire jumpers
and then they bring them they go
back to whatever community
they're in, so we're in
conversations with job.
We're here in New Mexico to say
Do we wanna start sending people
to the Alabama program and
making sure that they can get
placed back here with the US
Forest service and and local
fire departments or do we want
to start our own version of this
program? But we are following up
on that.
Uh, thank you, Chair and thank
you to the LFC The great
analysis. Thank you, Secretary.
So on the 23,000, I'll just jump
real quickly to I know we're
running out of time. The 23,000
folks that I guess are
This gap that you have, and then
you have all of these folks that
are, uh, available.
And I know there's a number of
reasons why they do why they
don't or whatever. Um, what sort
of proactive steps are you
taking to reach the group that
is available out there? I know
that you have a call center.
I've done some, uh, work with
your call center to free to
help, Uh, that that deal. Um,
the performance there, But is
there any during idle times? Do
you do proactive call outs to
call? Hey, you know there's this
job. You, you, you you based on
what you've told us about
yourself. You have these 17
skill sets and by the way, every
one of them meets
Employer a over here.
Can I connect you with them? I
mean, do you do anything like
that? Is there any proactive
work being done that way? Uh,
Mister Chair Center Padilla.
Actually, we just started. This
was such low hanging fruit,
which is so great to find. We
started a pilot. I want to say a
couple months ago. Where, um,
When you call into the U I call
center instead of just telling
you about job resources, we can
actually make an appointment for
you on the spot In the first two
weeks. We made 200 appointments.
And so that's been a huge source
of of getting more people. But
again, those people are already
in
Before, so that's not quite
getting to the top of the
stands. But it is getting to the
bottom of the stands. Which is
good. Um, we also do a lot of
just straight up outreach, so we
go to churches, community
centers wherever we people are
gathered, and it's another
reason. It's so important for us
to be in your communities, and
we just do that hand to hand
sort of retail or who's looking
for a job. Who do you know and
more often than not? It's my
niece. My nephew. My grandson.
You know, it's it's not
necessarily the job seeker. We
find there, but it's the path.
To the job seeker. Uh and that's
what we found is really the
most. It's it's labor intensive.
It's time intensive, but it's
the most effective approach.
Thanks Chair and, uh and the
secretary. So who were the 200
appointments with? I'm just
curious.
Uh, Mr Chair, Uh, Senator
Padilla. They were with
unemployment claimants, So they
were people who were on
unemployment insurance and
instead of just putting them
through, like, you know, giving
them the online connection or
whatever. We were actually
making appointments for them.
And so, uh, thank you. And so,
you know, I have that giant job
fair that I do every summer.
It's gigantic event. You guys
have been a part of it. Most
years that I've done it. Um, but
but so we're not actually making
an appointment with an actual
employer.
It seems to me like that
handshake would be much more.
The throughput would be much
greater because you know what?
I've said to you what I've told
you in my, um
My record or my account with you
That tells you what skill sets I
have. And then you know, we know
what these employers are looking
for. It just seems that let's
get the middle man out of the
way and a person and let's get
them talking to an employer. Uh,
mister Chair, Senator Padilla
absolutely agree. So when we
when we have rapid, higher
events, um those local offices
have the list of the claimants
and they make direct contact to
get him over to the rapid higher
events to get them. Um, you know
to employers and then similarly
when employers come to us, and
they don't necessarily want to W
it higher. They just have some
positions to fill.
We were able to go through that
U I database and give them
direct referrals to clients.
Absolutely.
Thank you. And then the last
thing I'll ask about is those
rapid hire events. So, um, the
rapid higher event are you
hiring for a specific job in a
specific
Uh, like the ones that are for,
like, say, state Department, uh
off jobs or whatever state
departments. Are you hiring for
a specific job with that skill
set, or are you hiring to a
general skill set, saying this
person is employable?
And then let departments choose
who's best for their work area
because I'm kind of hearing all
every which way from Tuesday
and it's a little bit of both.
So, for example, when our it
division goes out to do a job,
fair or a rapid hire, it's for
very specific positions and very
specific skill sets but for, um
other employers like Children,
Youth and Families Department or
recently we did, um, went for
the Albuquerque Police
Department. Those are more open
and in the a PD version. We
Actually tried a new experiment
where we we said You don't even
have to bring a resume. The
first stop is going to be at the
table. We'll help you put
together your resume, and then
let's move you down the list and
then we also have the other
public safety departments there
to catch people who law
enforcement and so that was
really successful. So we're kind
of moving towards that model.
Um, the second model that you
talked about, which is let's
just have the white the front
door wide open and let's just
get you in and then we'll figure
out whether you're right for
this job. That's not great for
every industry, but it works for
a lot of them. However, what I
will add chair
And secret is wanna make sure
that we're just not cramming
down and people in to go fill a
job and they they need to fill
the job that they can do and
that meets the mission of the
the work that they're gonna be
doing and then and then the last
thing I'll I'll be real quick.
Here too, is, um I heard you,
uh, you know, sort of
Uh, talk through and defend if
you will the local workforce. Uh
what? What's the plan? I mean,
the the the numbers just don't
speak should really be doing
there. And what? What's our plan
on making those offices more
effective for those communities,
Mr Karen Center Padilla. I mean,
as I pointed out, I don't think
the numbers uh, really told the
whole story in terms of the
business services that are
happening, and I put those back
up there for reference. Um, but
also it's it's again. It's that
outreach. It's It's improvements
to the offices. So we did get I
wanna say
$5 million in the past two years
to improve the offices, and
that's really going directly to
safety.
Fire suppression, air
conditioning, Uh, the real
basics. Um, we have a a pilot
office in Deming. That is sort
of our, um, gold standard of
what we think that office an
office should look like, and it
has all the all the things that
has like an area for the kids it
has up to date technology. Did
you guys visit that yet?
Fabulous. We actually we We, uh,
partnered in in these folks did
random drop ins on some of our
one stop shops, which is great
for me to get that, uh, to get
that perspective, but, um, that
The model that we're moving
towards and, uh you know, we
we're we're financially
constrained. Um, but our our
plan is just to continue to co
locate, continue to bring more
services in and continue to
reach out and let let the
community know we're there.
And then my last question is on
those offices and the employees
that work in those. Um, what
percentage of the time are they
expected to be in the office
versus out in the field? Um,
meeting with potential
applicants meeting with
employers. What percentage of
time? Are they out there? Just
doing something not waiting for
people to come to them, Uh,
Mister chair and Senator Padilla
it It really varies on what's
going on in the office. So we do
have offices where it's all day
every day. People coming through
and those folks are there, but
the expectation
Whenever you're looking at the
calendar, and if there's
somebody to sit there to take
walk ins, everybody else should
be out.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.
Thank you.
real quickly. Uh, it was stated.
Early in the presentation here
that we were spending close to
$500,000 for successful outcome.
Did I hear that right?
Yes, sir. You did.
Wow.
That's
That's an unbelievable figure to
come up with their
Surely we can
Sure we can do better and I. I
don't mean to make that sound
like it's all everybody's so
somebody else's fault. But
We're chasing the wrong tail. It
sounds like somehow
Mr. Chair, Senator Woods. We
disagree with that analysis. Um,
but it it doesn't obscure the
larger point, which is we need
to rethink the new me.
Is there any tracking that we do
whatsoever? Last question, Mr.
Chair, any cracking, we do
whatsoever about the cash
economy in the state of New
Mexico.
Uh, Mr Chair and Senator Woods.
Not in our department. Um and I.
I don't know, Um, if if other
departments do, but I agree that
it's a need it in a complex one.
Ok, thank you.
Thank you. You know, a couple of
things kind of stuck out to me,
right?
Getting people into the
workforce. I mean, we use indeed
right and I just looked up on
the 13,000 jobs in Albuquerque.
675 in Taos.
568 in gall 126 in grants,
right? There's no, the state
doesn't use that at all.
That's how employers currently
we match.
Our employees through indeed,
right?
Is they can match him and we
have to pay and the per employee
that we that we interview
And we can selectively go
through the match of criteria
and not I don't know why we're
not using that because
Everybody's got one of these.
Now There's nobody in the world
that doesn't have one of these
that can automatically get on
the Internet and search for a
job real quick.
And and so I mean, we gotta
modernize the way we're doing
this bricks and mortar fine for
services, and you may still have
to have those
But job matching
Uh, electronically is so much
Quicker because the person that
wants to apply for that job in
Gallup
Says, OK, the range is 18 to to
25 an hour, right? It's full
time right And here's a job
description.
And I either like it or I don't
like it. And I scroll to the
next one, Right and all. I wanna
be a barista at Starbucks.
Here's the Here's the pay, and
Here's the hours, right?
Uh, Mr Chair. I agree. We have
an online jobs system so jobs
system. So jobs.state.m.us very
catchy. Um, just like indeed.
Now it's It's got a life long
URL, Uh, but it is the place
there. E. Everyone who's on
unemployment is referred to its
spiders in jobs from all of the
other engines. So, like every
job, but in indeed should be
there, as well as the ones that
local employers place directly
with us. All of that said, Um,
it's harder to use. It's a
little wonky and the reason it's
so wonky is because we have to
The outcomes of everybody who is
coming through that system,
which means we need them to
register and give us their
social security number and tell
us all kinds of things about
themselves. And so right there,
we've put up a barrier that
makes it harder than indeed. But
it's one that we're required to
do, because that's how we
justify our performance
measures. So when I had that
those sort of Venn diagram
that's a perfect example of
where we're a little hamstrung,
and I've asked the question to
maybe we just scrap jobs dot
state and we just go with
indeed. Um, we did finally get
it unblocked.
All of our computers in the in
the workforce Connection
centers, but it's a real
challenge, given our the
expectations of our federal
partners. Well, let's work on
fixing that. The other thing is
a lot of it. And I think
This next coming year is
insurance costs right? There's
kids graduating and paying
$17,000 to go get their CDLs and
then the insurance companies
would come back and saying Well,
they have no experience and
they're 18. And they have a CBL.
So we're not gonna hire him.
Now. These kids spent all this
money getting a CD L, right and
the insurance pro are
prohibitive or a person gets one
single ticket. Uh CD L driver,
but just a regular driver, One
single ticket and they're not
allowed to drive for you, right?
And and so then you gotta tell
the employee Listen. You got a
speeding ticket.
Or you roll through a stop sign
some minor fraction a major
infraction employer would say
And and the insurance companies
are saying we can't hire you.
Right. There's gotta be some
really
Especially young people there,
They're gonna get speeding
tickets. They're gonna make
mistakes. I mean, if someone
spends that amount of money to
go get their CDL and the
insurance companies are tell
them you're ineligible Just
because you're 18 years old.
And you don't have the driving
experience. Well, that's why he
went to school.
Yeah. Mr. Terry. I completely
agree, and we do work with
employers to remove unnecessary
barriers to employment. So you
know, screening for marijuana in
this day and age. If you're
working at Walmart, is it
necessary? Probably not. Um, but
with these issues, sometimes
there's external factors like
insurance companies that put up
roadblocks. Uh, you probably
know better than I do the road
to getting that fixed. Is it
through the superintendent of
insurance or or where, But we'd
love to work on that, but but I
think it's got to go hand in
hand right cause if you're
offering them a training to
That right to, I don't know. Be
a plumber or or, uh, a
journeyman in any way, shape or
form and they have to drive a
vehicle, right?
That's gotta go hand in hand and
how you move those
Those together, and I think the
other thing is technology is
driven so much. You you go to
McDonald's, and you gotta order
to the kiosk.
We have the one person behind
the counter that's gonna put
your bag there and hand you
ketchup, and that's it.
Right. If you want anything
more, you better
Figure it out on your own.
And and so technology driven is
just driving the number of those
low out out the window. And how
do you get that next set of
workforce.
Move forward in in for what?
Looking through that
I. I just We gotta change
technology in New Mexico. We
don't change technology. You're
never gonna fill those two gaps,
and those lines are never even
crossed. And and we're never
gonna get there.
And I I'm
I personally believe
It's true, we agree and and the
second goal in our statewide
plan is preparing New Mexico for
the future of work, and that
means a couple of things that
means all the skills that come
with things like remote work. Um
and then all the jobs that are
gonna be replaced by so now
instead of having 10 people
working at a at a warehouse, you
might have one robot doing it.
But then you need five people to
do the robotics. And so how do
we get people from a to B? Um,
that is all part of our
statewide plan. And And we
would. Yeah. I'm sorry. You
don't have
Collaboration. No, we would love
to have, um, collaboration from
the Legislature. If there's
specific things you want us to
look at. I think that's where I
mean. Look at the Amazon
warehouses. Those are all
robotics driven. I mean there.
There's jobs. I mean,
We looked at a a skin steer that
you can drive from your iPhone,
So there's no driver stress,
right? Yeah, Yeah, I have the
same. They're more efficient.
They're they're better time and
the kids can sit there in the
truck and drive them from their
iPhone. Uh,
So if we don't get on board,
that's the way we're headed
because of workforce is
shrinking and shrinking and
shrinking.
And in technology is driving it.
And those people that want the
jobs or get the jobs have to
have the technology to do that.
So I mean workforce connections.
I mean,
I haven't been there now. 20
years looking for employees,
right? You're invited anytime I
know, but we're looking for
employees. You you go to where
you think the market drives them
right, And that's where the
market is driving. That's where
they're looking.
I mean, five. We hired five guys
yesterday or interviewed five
guys for jobs yesterday. They
all came from indeed.
Men from workforce solutions. No
references from work so
And we're thank you. Let's work
on fixing some stuff for
improving some stuff and
changing things.
Charles H.
Oh, Mr Astros.
You were cheering for the
Astros, right?
Cafe.
He is.
Great. Thank you. Mr Chair. Good
morning. Members of the
committee. My name is Ismael
Torres. I'm the chief economist
for you all at the Legislative
Finance Committee. And as
chairman Munoz mentioned this is
behind Tab A in your binders.
And
Luckily, it's a very brief
presentation. The story here is
something of a no news is good
news situation. This is our
monthly revenue tracking report
and we do publish these monthly
based on when the Department of
Finance and Administration
publishes their, UH, General
fund report.
And I think it could be a little
helpful to keep in mind or talk
about the process here. So if
you're a taxpayer or a business
owner and the activity occurs,
say in January, um you may be,
uh, sell some products or or you
work and you earn some wages.
Then by the next month, you can
report those taxes to the
taxation and revenue Department.
So already you have one month
after the activity occurs, and
then the Taxation and Revenue
Department has one month to
collect them account for them,
and then
Report them and distribute them
to where they need to go. So
that's the second month after
the activity occurs, and then
the Department of Finance and
Administration has about a month
to actually acknowledge and
account for everything that came
in, and that is what we call the
General Fund report and they
report it out to us. So the
earliest we get a A confirmed
look at, uh, our revenues as
three months after the activity,
but we get some preliminary data
from the tax and Rev Department
two months you'll notice this
report is for November. So the
General fund
Is currently late from the
Department of Finance
Administration about three
months now.
But we still have good data
coming from the tax and Rev.
Department, um on on a regular
schedule, So we have some
preliminary data in this report
through February, and then we
got some more data. Um, through
March. I believe, uh, last week
before or after this was
published, So, um, we'll just
dig right in if you look at the
charts on the right of page one
here there, there's a couple of
ways that we represent our
current general fund revenues
And really the the lead here is
that
With actuals through November
and with preliminary revenues
through February, the state's
main bank account or the general
fund is set to have 100 and $12
million more than we would have
estimated, Um by the end of the
fiscal year, that's about 1%
within our estimates, which,
from our perspective as
economists is quite close to
where we thought we would be
And that total revenue
collection represents a 9%
increase from last year. If you
remember in the session, we
talked a lot about how we
expected this year's revenues to
be about 10% higher than last
year's, which is a decrease from
the 20% growth the year before,
and we're going to expect that
to continue to slow down and
I'll talk a little bit more
about that here shortly.
Um, In November alone, the state
collected $1.2 billion worth of
money in the General Fund.
That's $400 million, or 50% more
than last year. That sounds like
a big jump, but a lot of that is
related to oil and gas related
revenues. So at by November, and
last year we had hit the
thresholds that the oil and gas
revenues could not exceed in the
general fund and had already
started sending the excess to
the early childhood Trust fund.
We haven't hit that threshold
yet this year, and so that's why
comparing months when you're
looking at oil and gas is a
little tricky, so I encourage
you to take a look at the second
chart at the bottom of the page.
Which is general fund revenues,
excluding oil and gas, and you
can see that we're much closer
to the previous year. The dashed
gray line is last year. The
solid orange line is this year
or much closer. Um, on on that
basis when you exclude oil and
gas, so that
When once you exclude oil and
gas, we're up $97 million higher
than last year. November of last
year. Most of that difference is
coming from investment income
specifically from the state
treasurer's office, and I'll
talk a little bit more about
that here shortly. That's making
up more than half that's about
two thirds of the of the
increase there.
If you turn to page two
I want to draw your attention to
the graph in the middle of the
page here, the orange represents
tracking, so that's the money
we've got from the Department of
Finance and Administration
confirmed through November
preliminary revenues through
February from the tax and Rev.
Department and then our
estimates for the rest of the
year. You can see we're still
very close to where we thought
we would be when we did these
estimates last year.
And again within 1%, mostly from
That increase, or that
difference is mostly coming from
the state treasurer's office but
also corporate income taxes. And
those are really our two most
volatile revenues. Today after
you all have implemented all
these thresholds with oil and
gas. We're really seeing the
volatility coming from corporate
income taxes and the state
treasurer's office investment
earnings.
If you look at the chart at the
bottom, this is what we call a
revenue walk here and the way
you'll read. This is starting
with gross receipts tax on the
left. We're currently $60
million above our estimate,
where $3 million below our
estimate on compensating tax 26
below on selective sales 20
million below on personal and so
on. Net there if you add all of
those bars together where, say
below $20 million above our
forecast, and then you add in
corporate income tax and
investment income, the big one
there $84 million above our
forecast.
And on net, you can see the 112
on the far right.
If you turn to page three, we
like to go into the economics
behind our revenues in every one
of these, um, revenue tracking
presentations because as your
economists were really
monitoring these economic
conditions to
Get clues and hints as to where
our revenues might be going, but
also to understand where they've
been or why they behaved the way
that they did. So if you look at
the text on the right here, you
see certain revenue items, tax
sources and the way they connect
to an economic indicators and
one of the most important
indicators for our revenues is
the chart in the middle here.
total wages and salaries, So if
you receive a wage or salary in
New Mexico, we add them all up,
and we get our total wages and
salaries. The growth is charted
here.
You can see the dip at the
beginning of the chart that was
in the pandemic. When we lost a
lot of employment. It reduced
our total wages, so we had
negative growth. But what's
really remarkable is the growth
we experienced after the
pandemic. We were seeing double
digit wage growth that's record
setting wage growth, in part
because employment was coming
back online very quickly, but
also wage inflation was strong
following the pandemic has
slowed down since, but that was
also contributing to the strong
region in salary growth and, of
course, that strong wage and
salary
Growth translates to more
personal income tax revenue. As
you earn money, you're paying
more personal income taxes, so
we're seeing double digit wage
and salary growth. We're
expecting very high personal
income tax growth, but also
gross receipts tax as as people
earn more money, they spend more
on consumption and we saw the
Groce receipts tax picking up in
the double digits as well. With
that we're
Currently in the period of that
slowdown as we leave the double
digit wage growth and get back
to about three or 4% wage
growth, but that's on par with
what we were seeing before the
pandemic, and you hear a
director Salle and others talk a
lot, including ourselves, Talk a
lot about how we expect revenues
to return to a 3 to 4% growth
rate That's in part driven by
these wages and salaries,
returning to their normal three
and 4% growth rate.
And we are seeing, um, ourselves
heading back into that
direction.
If you turn the page on Page
four, we also monitor other
economic activity. Excuse me.
Um, we're seeing private
activity in construction and
professional and scientific and
technical services grow
tremendously, 19% and 16%,
respectively. They are now our
leading, um, drivers of Groce
receipts tax. It's no longer the
direct mining industry. Although
much of construction is related
to mining, but we're also seeing
it in the metro areas.
In oil and gas specifically if I
could draw your attention to the
charts at the bottom, more
specifically oil here on the
left the orange bars rep
represent oil production on a
daily basis, and the blue lines
represent the estimates or the
fiscal year averages, And it's a
little hard to see behind that
FY 24 text box, but oil had
actually declined through the
the summer of last year.
Um and we've finally seen it.
start to come back up above
where we thought we would be. So
we were a little worried there
for a second, but it's it seemed
to return to where we were
estimating, and we're currently
on track with where we thought
we would be last year.
Natural gas, though, continues
to beat all of our expectations,
So that's something to continue
to watch. But again a lot of
these revenues. Uh, once they
hit their thresholds are
transferred to other sources,
like the early childhood. So,
uh, if you turn to Page five,
I'll close up with the
narrative. Um, uh, with a
discussion on on the state
treasurer's office investment
earnings, So the graph here on
the right represents the amount
of interest or investment income
distributed to the General fund.
Based on the state treasurer's
office activity.
And you can see the historical
data here is like 25% of the
variability compared to what
we're currently experiencing,
And that's in part because our
revenues have ballooned over the
last several years.
And because our revenues have
bloomed the General fund, which
is what the state treasurer's
office manages and invests, has
more than quadrupled, and so as
that balance has quadrupled, of
course, the earnings on those
balances have also grown. Uh
three or four fold, but on top
of that bigger balance, earning
a bigger investment. We're also
seeing higher interest rates,
which translates to higher
returns, but because the
treasurer's office owns a lot of
bonds that the the face value of
those
Changes based on market
expectations for interest rates.
We're seeing a lot of volatility
based on what the Federal
Reserve is going to do
anticipated to do or not do
So as we continue to go forward
and track these revenues, um
we're going to watch
The state treasurer's office
investment income very closely,
especially as the interest rate
environment continues to
fluctuate pretty wildly.
In addition to the investment
earnings, though corporate
income taxes have also grown in
volatility for many years, we
saw declining corporate income
taxes, in part because of
credits being paid out, but also
because the the share of of
corporate income taxpayers was
shrinking. And and there's a lot
of analysis behind that that I
won't get into. But we are
expecting that the corporate
income tax will grow
tremendously in the next couple
of months. We have preliminary
data from TRD that, uh, this
next quarterly payment may be
$100 million above estimates.
So we're going to watch that
very closely. Um, as those
especially annual filings began
to come in.
And, um with that, Mr Chair if I
could just have you all turn to
page seven. This is the This is
what we refer to as the revenue
tracker. This is how we monitor
revenues on a on a line item by
line item basis. So if you're
interested in any particular
collection like cannabis excise
tax, for example, you can find
the amount of money we collect
here. The dark blue represents
those actuals as recorded by the
Department of Finance and
Administration. The light blue,
uh, represent
Preliminary data from tax and
rev and then the White
represents our estimates for the
remainder of the year.
And with that, Mr Chair, I hope
I made good time.
And I'm ready for questions.
Real quickly is so D do we need
to set a new baseline in in
these measures, right? A lot of
these baselines are from like
1985, or, you know, CP baselines
and they go back and and look at
those. I mean, I don't think
we're ever gonna see inflation
ever again.
So should the new baseline
should be adjusted to to to
create a more level of
volatility. It's just like your
oil and gas revenue. You saw the
downturn last year. You got a
little bit worried about tick
that production was still up
above the number, something made
up the difference.
The baselines need to be reset
for forecasting.
Mr Chair. Our forecasts
currently, don't expect us to
get back to 2% inflation, so
these expectations that we have
here include an expectation of
above 2% close around 3%
inflation.
Any other questions, All right.
So no, thank you.
