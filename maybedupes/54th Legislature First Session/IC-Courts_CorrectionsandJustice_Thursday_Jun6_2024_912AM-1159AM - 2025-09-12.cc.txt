Representing House District 33
in Dona County. Glad to be with
you today and good to see you
represent. I'm Senator Cedilla
Lopez.
Um, thank you, Madam Chair. I'm
Antoinette Cillo Lopez
representing District 16 in
Albuquerque, the university
neighborhoods.
Right?
Good to see you. Also so
Um, the agenda for these last
two meetings of focus on what
I'm referring to as the
intersection of the justice
system of civil and criminal and
sort of mental health and how we
address different issues
associated with that, So
yesterday, we had some great
conversations about assisted
outpatient treatment and heard
from for Oh,
OK?
And then today we will talk
about civil commitment and some
other issues, so I neglected to
have representative on
Tell us about herself. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Yes,
representative Janelle Yan from
Albuquerque's 19th district of
the fairgrounds of the
International District.
Thank you. We're such good
friends. I can't remember what?
I don't see her. So, um again.
We are, um, now gonna be talking
about civil commitment summary
of the law, Megan Dorsey and
Brandon Cummings, both of whom
are staffers supporting us in C
CJ in advance of the special
session. If we have the floor is
yours.
Thank you, madam Chair.
Brandon Cummings, and yesterday
we started speaking about or we
spoke about a OT.
And I was preface What we're
gonna talk about in a minute
with the difference between a OT
and um, civil commitment, and
that's from a legal perspective.
The difference is the level of
interference with the person's
liberty.
So some of the standards that we
talked about yesterday are
lower.
In order to be able to use the A
O statute, and that's based on
the fact that what we're talking
about today is, um
Detaining someone is restraining
them is
Sometimes holding them.
Uh, for 30 days or more.
Without there, against their
will.
So involuntary civil commitment
in New Mexico. I'm gonna try to
find out where this microphone
sounds right. So that I'm not
shouting at you.
Voluntary civil commitment in
New Mexico is generally
Three statutes.
Um, the first is the 72 hour.
What's referred to as a 72 hour
hold and that's emergency
commitment.
Um
New Mexico then provides for a
30 Day civil commitment and its
specifically 30 days.
Um and then we have a provision
for extending a 30 day civil
commitment that we'll talk about
within this.
In in talking about what? This
how these statutes operate, Um
and they're a little dense, so
we'll try to get through them.
But in talking about them, then
we'll also talk about why
they're probably the the
constitutional framework that
they have to operate within
because there's some pretty
clear boundaries from the US
Supreme Court and the state
Supreme Court on on what you
cannot do.
So the 43 1 10 emergency mental
health evaluation and care also
frequently referred to as the 72
hour hold.
A peace officer may date may
detain and transport a person
for emergency mental health
evaluation and care in the
absence of a legally valid
order. So in other words,
without the need for a court
order only if for one of four
conditions are met.
The person is otherwise subject
to lawful arrest.
Um, So if a person's been
Detained. Uh,
Place or or could be placed
under arrest. The officer has
the authority to instead
transport that person for a, uh,
emergency health evaluation.
The second category is that the
officer has reasonable grounds
to believe the person has just
attempted suicide.
Um, which is pretty
straightforward.
The third category is
Based on their own observation
and investigation. A police
officer has reasonable grounds
to believe that the person as a
result of a mental disorder,
presents the likelihood of
serious harm to himself or
herself or to others and that
immediate detention is necessary
to prevent such harm.
Immediately upon arrival at the
evaluation facility. The peace
officer shall be interviewed by
the admitting physician or the
admitting physician's designee.
So this is where we start to see
that this statute
I mean, it's extremely dense,
and sometimes we're putting
limitations into, uh
We're putting limitations in
that are that are several layers
deep.
So this category relies on the
subjective, standard reasonable
grounds to believe.
Um
It incorporates those and the
and the and this will be the
theme of all of these statutes
and incorporate serious
likelihood of harm to the
person's self. Or it also places
a requirement on uh, what
happens when they reach
And evaluation facility.
Evaluation facility is not
defined within the statute.
The fourth category is a
physician, a psychologist or Q
qualified mental health
professional licensed for
independent practice.
With the requirement that those
people be affiliated with a
community mental health center
or a core service agency.
That they have certified that
the individual as a result of a
mental disorder.
Resents the likelihood of
serious harm to himself or
herself or to others.
And that immediate detention is,
um
The requirement affiliated with
a community Mental health center
or core service agency.
Is
The definition of core service
agent
Those are the categories of
people that can or those. Those
are the bases for transporting.
The statute moves on to tell us
what happens when someone is
transported.
So an emergency evaluation under
this statute shall be
accomplished upon the request of
a peace officer or jail or
detention facility administrator
Or that person's designee.
Or upon the certification of a
physician, psychologist or
qualified mental health
professional licensed for
independent practice who is
affiliated with the community
Mental Health Center, or Poor
service agency.
So again, we're limiting the
authority of the people who that
the mental health professionals
who can request this must be
affiliated with either a
community Mental health center
or the undefined core service
agency.
A court order is not required
under this section.
If an application is made to a
court, the court's power to act
in furtherance of an emergency
admission shall be limited to
ordering that the client be seen
by a certified psychologist or
psychiatrist prior to transport
And
That the police that a police
officer transport the person
Um, this goes back a little bit
to discussion yesterday about
what the court's authority is.
And what can be done and this
statute so this statute is
limiting the court. These are
the two things that you can do
Should you be approached,
although the statute is also not
requiring a court order for
transport if the conditions in
in a subsection a or map
An evaluation facility may
accept for an emergency based
admission.
Any person when a physician or
certified psychologist certifies
that such a person as a result
of a my as a result of a mental
disorder presents a likelihood
of serious harm to himself or
herself or to others, and
immediate detention is necessary
to prevent such harm.
So
This section. Um
This section would likely be
what we would what I would
consider a liability protection.
So it's simply saying that a
facility may accept someone
Who's being transported for
emergency based
For an emergency evaluation.
It is interesting that we've
removed the limitation on
Um
Positions and psychologists that
must be connected to a core
service.
Um
Under section subsection D of
the statute. A person detained
under this section shall
whenever possible.
Um, be taken immediately to an
evaluation facility.
So the first sentence of our of
our subsection D says You should
do this when you can.
Detention facilities shall be
used as temporary shelter for
such persons only in cases of
extreme emergency for protective
custody and no person taken into
custody under the provisions of
the code shall remain in a
detention facility longer than
necessary. And in no case longer
than 24 hours.
If it did, so, This is what
we're discussing is. Can you use
a gel to hold someone who's on
their way to an emergency mental
health evaluation?
And the statute will allow it,
Um it says it it
Limits it to only do this.
Whenever, uh
Nothing else is possible.
And it can only be done for 24
hours.
If a detention facility is used.
Then the proposed client, the
person being transported for
this for the mental health
evaluation.
There are four limitations
there. One
They cannot be held in a cell
with prisoners.
They cannot be identified on
records used to record custody
of prisoners.
They shall be a provided with
adequate protection from
possible suicide attempts.
And shall be treated with the
respect and dignity to every
citizen who is neither accused
nor convicted of a crime.
Um
The fourth category there the
the fourth requirement there.
Likely does not have the
operational law.
Uh, there's no definition of
respect or dignity and in the
statute and no
No way to no no way to
When a person has been
transported for an emergency
mental health evaluation.
The statute provides that the
admitting physician or certified
psychologist shall evaluate
whether
And then it tells. So this is
we're we're telling the
psychologist or the the
Physician what we want them to
determine.
So whether reasonable grounds
exist to detain the proposed
client for evaluation and
treatment and if reasonable
grounds are found The proposed
client shall be detained.
If the admitting physician or
certified psychologist
determined that reasonable
grounds do not exist to detain
The proposed client for
evaluation and treatment. The
proposed client shall not be
Reasonable grounds is a
subjective standard. It's
Not identified in the statutes
not set in in any other statute
to determine what that means,
But basically we're placing the
decision on whether the person
will or will not be detained on
the admitting
On arrival at an if an
evaluation facility the proposed
client shall be informed orally
and in writing by the
evaluation facility of the
purpose and possible
consequences of the proceedings,
the right to a hearing within
seven days.
The right to counsel and the
right to communicate with an
attorney and a mental health
professional of the proposed
client's own choosing and shall
have
The right to receive necessary
and appropriate treatment.
So in subsection F of the 72
hour emergency evaluation
statute.
Were effectively setting out
what the kind of the patients
rights
Um
It's
So it's not clear exactly what
The possible consequences of the
proceedings that that the client
or the patient has to be made
aware of, But the right to a
hearing is pretty clear.
A peace officer who transports a
section G, a peace officer who
transports a proposed client to
an evaluation facility under the
provisions of this section shall
not require a court order to be
reimbursed by the referring
county. So this is just
A. You can get paid the mileage
for the train.
The 72 hour hold, uh, statute or
the 72 hour mental health
evaluation statute is generally
a, uh, is generally the first
step in a civil commitment.
Um
And speaking with practitioners
in the area. There are referrals
that come directly as
Uh and voluntary.
Proceedings.
Filed with the court, but
usually there's first the
emergency intervention.
That brings us
To the commitment of adults for
a 30 Day period.
This is the involuntary
commitment statute in New
Mexico. We limit um, an
involuntary commitment.
At the outset to 30 days.
So, subsection A tells us every
adult client involuntary
involuntarily admitted to an
evaluation facility pursuant to
the statute has a right to a
hearing within seven days.
Of admission unless waived after
consultation with counsel.
If a physician or evaluation
facility decides to seek
commitment.
Of the client for evaluation and
treatment. A petition shall be
filed with the court within five
days of admission, requesting
The commitment.
So
Initially we have a
Seven days they have the right
to a hearing within seven days.
The petition has to be filed
within five days.
Um, both very short timelines.
Presumably, that means that
Once a petition is filed within
the five days
Court has two days.
To have a hearing.
The petition shall include
A description of the specific
behavior or symptoms of the
client that evidence the
likelihood of serious harm to
the client or others.
And shall include the initial
screening report by the
evaluating physician.
Or if that's not available, if
if a physician wasn't available,
then this the screening report
by a mental health professional
acceptable to the court.
That's
That part of the statute. That
definition is not defined. So
presumably, the court has broad
discretion in determining in
determining what mental health
professional it will find
acceptable.
The petition shall list all the
prospective witnesses.
And provide a witness a summary
of what those witnesses will
testify to
Copies of the petition are
required to be served on the
client. The clients Guardian.
The treatment guardian. If
there's if one has been
appointed and the client's
attorney
At that hearing within seven
days.
The client shall be represented
by counsel and
Shall have the right to present
evidence Counsel shall have the
right to present evidence on the
client's behalf, including
testimony by an independent
medical mental health
professional of the client's own
choosing.
And cross examine witnesses and
be present. The statute as
written, doesn't
Identify. Um
How those things are paid for.
At the present time if the
district attorney's office files
an involuntary
Commitment action, the D A's
office heals the prosecution of
that.
Um
Even though it's technically a
civil proceeding.
And, um, the public defender's
office is referring to outside.
The presence of a client at the
hearing may be waived upon a
showing to the court that the
client client knowingly and
voluntarily waves the right that
right
Um
A complete record of the
proceedings shall be made.
The waiver requirement.
The waiver requirement doesn't
specify how the court should
deal with, um
Accepting a voluntary waiver of
of the of a right we've created
or maybe a constitutional right
from a person who may not be
able to waive that right so
At the hearing, a court
appointed a guardian for an
adult involved in an involuntary
commitment proceedings shall
have automatic standing to
appear at all stages of the
preceding and shall be allowed
to testify by telephone through
or through affidavit. If
circumstances make live
testimony too burdensome.
That's the, uh the court has the
authority to appoint AAA care
guardian, but is not required to
do so.
Subsection D tells us the court
shall include in its findings.
The Guardian's opinion.
Regarding the need for
involuntary treatment or a
statement detailing the efforts
made to ascertain the Guardian's
opinion.
Upon completion of the hearing.
Or may order may order a
commitment for evaluation and
treatment not to exceed 30 days.
If the court finds by clear and
convincing evidence.
The three following, Uh, the the
three following requirements.
We're limiting every so the
statute on its terms is limiting
in involuntary commitment.
To 30 days under all
circumstances.
So the and clear and convincing
evidence is the is the burden of
proof required in these cases.
We'll get to why, just at the
end.
But
The
Must succeed on clear by clear
and convincing evidence in in
persuading the court that one as
a result of a mental disorder
The client prevents a like
presents a likelihood of serious
harm to themselves or others.
To the client needs and it's
likely to benefit from the
proposed treatment and three
The proposed commitment is
consistent with the treatment
needs of the client and with the
least drastic means principle.
Um
We did talk about at least least
drastic means, which is defined
in the a OT statute yesterday in
this statute, we just refer to
it as the least drastic means
principle.
Subsection SF tells us that once
the court has made the findings
set required by subsection E
The court shall hear further
evidence as to whether the
client is capable of informed
consent.
If the court determines that the
client is incapable of informed
consent.
The court shall appoint for the
client a treatment guardian. So
this is the first step at which
the court is required to point a
treatment guardian, Although we
have previously permitted the
court
To appoint a treatment guardian
in its discretion.
The treatment guardian shall
have only the power. There's a
separate statute that defines
what powers The Guardian is
given.
Um
Their broad, but they do
recognize that, um, an
individual, especially an
individual who later found to be
capable of informed consent.
We'll then be able to make
subsection G.
Talks about
Who can initiate the
involuntary commitment.
Proceedings. So an interested
person
Who reasonably believes that an
adult is suffering from a mental
disorder.
And presents a likelihood of
serious harm to the adult's own
self or others.
But does not require emergency
care.
May request that the district
attorney investigate and
determine whether reasonable
grounds exist to commit
The adults for 30 Day period of
evaluation that subsection
starts out with, so it's
effectively got
Sort of layers of, um
Layers of of standards. So first
the interested person has to
reasonably believe.
Which is the first objective
standard.
That this is true.
It's specifically incorporates
people who do not require
emergency care.
And then the district attorney
at that point, is charged with
investigating whether
The Da's office believes that
There are reasonable grounds.
To proceed.
The applicant. Any applicant who
isn't qualifies as an interested
person.
May present to the district
attorney, any medical reports or
other evidence immediately
available to the applicant but
shall not be required to obtain
a medical report or other
particular evidence in order to
make a petition.
The district attorney shall act
on the on the petition within 72
hours.
If the district attorney
determines that reasonable
grounds exist to commit the
adult, the district attorney may
petition the court for a
hearing, so the statute is
compelling. The district
attorney to act by with the
language shall act, although the
statute is really compelling
them to
Act in terms of making a
decision about whether they want
to act or not.
So that determination that
reasonable grounds exist to
commit the adult.
The district attorney may
petition. The court may petition
the court for a hearing the
court may issue a summons to the
proposed client to appear at the
time designated for a hearing,
which shall
Which shall not be less than
five days from the date the
petition is served.
If the proposed client is
summoned and fails to appear at
the proposed time, and upon a
finding of the court that the
proposed client has failed to
appear.
So I guess there's a requirement
that the court in a finding that
Uh, failure to appear has
occurred.
Or appears without having been
evaluated by the court. The
court may order the proposed
client to be detained for
evaluation as provided in
subsection C.
Of the prior 72 hour statue.
So effectively if notice was
given, and the, um
Proposed client or the client.
Doesn't fails to appear, then
the court does have the
authority then.
To detain that person.
Um
In the same manner that
Any 72 hour hold can be can can
be
Any hearing provided for
pursuant to subsection G. That
prior section shall be conducted
in conformance with the
requirements of subsection B of
this section.
Which was the section that
required notice to
Uh, individual, the individual's
attorney, the individual's
treatment guardian.
Um
And the
Individuals.
There's a treatment guardian and
then perhaps their own
independent, uh, medical person
personnel.
So each time there's a hearing.
All of that notice is required.
A physician or evaluation
facility. So this is
That's That's the structure, the
organization by which a single
30 Day
Involuntary commitment.
Can occur under New Mexico law.
Um, the court does not have the
ability or discretion.
To
Set a date that is greater.
Um then 30 days.
Under the commitment statute.
The next statute. 43 1 11.
Provides that that
30 Day period may be extended.
It.
I'm sorry. 43 1 12.
Provides that it may be
extended.
In order to extend a 30 Day. Um
Commitment.
The
An extension petition first must
be filed within 21 days of the
beginning of that commitment, so
we've required a hearing to
happen.
A petition to be filed with
within five days hearing to
happen within seven days.
And then
Um
Presumably nine days after that,
A petition to extend must be
filed.
So that it falls within. Um, I'm
sorry, not nine days.
21. Days after that. A, uh,
extension must be filed.
So the petition must explain the
necessity for the extended
commitment. It must explain the
treatment that has been provided
during the evaluation during the
1st 21 days of that evaluation.
It has to include the individual
treatment plan for the proposed
commitment period.
Which would be the extended
commitment period.
The petition shall list the
prospective witnesses for
commitment summary of the
matters on which the witnesses
will testify. Copies of the
petition shall be served on the
client client's guardian. The
treatment guardian. If one has
been appointed and the client's
attorney
A hearing.
On the extension is required to
be held before that 30 days.
So five days to follow the
initial petition.
Seven days to have the first
hearing the the hearing on the
petition.
21 more days to file this
extension and then no more than
nine days to to hear the
extension, Um, at which the
client will have the full rights
described in the prior statute.
In addition,
On an extension. The client
shall have a right to a trial by
six person jury upon request.
And the statute creates, uh, a
right to appeal Court of court
in guardian for an adult
involved in an involuntary
commitment proceeding shall have
automatic standing to appear in
the extension as well as the
original petition.
And we permit them to testify by
telephone or affidavit.
The court shall include in its
findings. The Guardian's
opinions regarding the need for
involuntary treatment or a
statement detailing the efforts
made to ascertain the Guardian's
opinion.
As in the previous statue.
Once again, the standard is
clear and convincing evidence.
So if at the conclusion of the
hearing the fact finder
Previously it was the court in
this case, it would be the
court.
Or if the client or the client's
attorney requested it would be a
six person jury.
Determines by clear and
convincing evidence that the
client pre presents a likelihood
of harm to self or other
That extended treatment is
likely to improve the client's
condition and
That the proposed extended
commitment
Is consistent with the least
dramatic means principle. Then
the court shall order the
commitment of the of the client.
For a period not to exceed six
months.
Except that when the client has
been committed for two
consecutive periods of
commitment.
Any commitment commencing
thereafter shall not exceed
One year.
So
Presumably, that means that
The initial it
Extension under 43 1 12 could be
for up to six months. A second
extension could be for up to six
months and a third extension
could be for up to one year.
At the expiration of the
commitment order. The client may
be detained only after a new
commitment hearing.
Unless waved after consultation
with the client's attorney.
And the entry of a new order for
commitment, not just and and a
new order is entered.
So
This is providing that the
client's attorney in conjunction
with the district attorney may
agree to extend
The commitment period for an
additional six months without
the need.
The client and voluntarily
referred for treatment pursuant
to section F.
Shall be entitled to a re
examination of the order for the
client's involuntary referral.
For treatment on the client's
own petition.
Or that of the client's legal
guardian parents, spouse,
relative or friend.
To the district Court of the
county in which the client
resides or is detained.
So this is, um subsection F is
providing that anyone any any
person acquainted with
Uh, the individual who's been
involuntarily committed.
Can effectively file a petition
for review.
Um
Spouse friend.
Um legal guardian, which would
Have already had that authority.
Anyone can file a request that
the that that the, uh commitment
be reviewed.
And
The court is then required to
have a proceeding.
Um
With the limitation that the
court is not required to have
more than one proceeding every
60 days.
So we're we're we're creating,
standing for
Um
Almost everyone to file a
petition to review because it's
it's allowing even even a
person's friend, so there's no
limit really on who can file
this petition for review, but we
are limiting it to one review
every six. Nothing in this
section shall limit the right of
a client to petition the court
for a writ of hippias corpus.
That's uh
Habeas corpus is the right to
petition any court for the
review of your detention under
pretty much any circumstances
and the standards are
effectively whether or not you
are W whether or not your
detention is constitutional,
whether it's civil or criminal
detention.
Um, We're just specifying that
you have the right that we're
not trying to limit that right?
Section subsection H. Nothing in
this code shall prohibit a
client from seeking voluntary
admission.
Subsection. I
No mental health treatment
facility is required to detain
treat
Or provide services to a client
when the client does not require
such detention, treatment or
services.
Um
Subsection is a little confusing
because it seems that the that
it can play that it could place
the treatment facility in
conflict with the court's order.
So
If the court is the court's
ordered that someone be
involuntarily committed.
And
That they are in need of
treatment.
Subsection. I says that the
mental health facility
Um
I'm sorry. I misspoke. This is
the section that requires them
to detain. If the if
There's an order.
Um
But no But again, it's
If the client does not require
such detention, treatment or
services, so it's effectively
asking the or allowing the
facility to sort of second guess
my read on that is that it
allows the facility to second
guess
The court's order.
All of the statute repeatedly
refers to
Um
Danger to himself herself or
other
And that's because we have, um
Some pretty clear
US Supreme Court boundaries.
And so with within the
Those limits provide that
effectively. You cannot take
someone's freedom. Someone's
liberty.
In the sense of, uh
incarcerating them or put
placing them in a treatment
lockdown treatment facility
against their will, unless
They pose a, um
Risk a serious risk of harm to
themselves or to or to other
people.
Uh, we require due process in
that determination.
But frankly, but the New Mexico
Supreme Court has
Grab it with it a little bit and
has said to us that due process
doesn't mean the same thing in
every circumstance it it is a
little malleable.
What the US Supreme Court has
been completely clear on is is
that standard that custodial
involuntary custodial care?
Is only permitted when a
individual presents a dangerous
presence, a danger and
Um, and there's substantial
evidence of that danger to
themselves or lack of
dangerousness will undermine
That's uh the O'Connor.
McDonald's in case specifically
held that of finding a mental
illness alone.
Cannot justify a state's
decision to lock a person up
against his will and keep him
indefinitely in simple custodial
confinement.
Assuming that
So the the mental health
Mental illness.
Is a little flexible in in all
of the case law.
But effectively. The court has
said that
Spite someone being
Even extremely mentally ill if
they're not dangerous to
themselves, and they can live
safely in freedom.
Which is a tricky um
That's a tricky phrase to try to
to try to try to
Describe and it doesn't really
you don't really It doesn't
really exist outside this
context.
Um, in case law.
But assuming that those two
things
Then, um
Are not present.
Then detention. Idington V,
Texas is another US Supreme
Court case. Addressing
explicitly involuntary civil
commitment.
And in that case, the court held
that an individual's interest in
the outcome of civil commitment.
Is sufficiently serious. That
due process requires the state
to justify confinement by more
than
Uh, preponderance, and that's
why the statute repeats. I
believe the, uh the clear and
convincing evidence Standard,
which is also a difference from
a OT, so a OT uses a clear and
convincing evidence standard for
the overall decision but allows
certain facts to be proven.
By preponderance of the
evidence.
And within the context of
involuntary civil commitment.
The Supreme Court is saying.
Um, everything has to be.
There's also although it's
decided in a in the context of a
of a criminal case.
There is also the concern, um
from the US Supreme Court that
status
Is not. You can't criminalize or
rely on status in in this
question, so status being
So much.
Is or is not an addict or a ille
illegally or addicted to illegal
substances.
Is not a sufficient definition
of dangerousness.
So it's not sufficient to say
that because someone is addicted
to a substance they are
dangerous or they are.
Uh or that, in itself is a
crime.
And with that
I will stand for questions.
Thanks very much, Brandon. I
appreciate it. So we have
representative on you. No Norn
and, um, I see Senator Cedillo
Lopez. It will be next.
Thank you, madam Chair. Um,
thank you.
Mister Cummings and Miss Dorsey.
So this is obviously very dense.
Stuff that we're talking about.
So I just have one question.
Really? Um, in
The statute. I think it was 43 1
10 talks about, um, harm
And a person being at serious
risk of harm to one to
themselves or to others. So I'm
wondering if that definition of
harm does that
Fall into the same as like.
dangerousness. Are we just
talking about?
Violent harm or a A person's
inability to care for
themselves.
So the first of all
Statute doesn't define it.
Um
And
I think that and I think that's
for that's that would probably
be someone that would be a very
voluminous definition. If you
try to define it statutorily,
But within the context of
Um, both.
The emergency hold and
The 30 Day civil commitment.
Um, that's the US Supreme
Court's telling us that you have
to demonstrate.
A substantial substantial
evidence that
There is a likelihood of serious
harm either to themselves or to
another person.
OK, so I think the answer to
your question Madam Chair
representative is
That the uh existing Supreme
Court case law limits what can
be done in circumstances that
are less than
Being a danger to yourself or to
others. OK, Thank you. Thank
you, madam Chair.
Thank you, representative. We
have Senator Cilla Lopez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um I
just had notes throughout with
little questions, so I'll just
go through them really quickly.
So what do you think is meant by
core service agency?
Madam chair.
And she said it wasn't defined
Madam Chair, Senator. Uh
Good question.
Just didn't click. OK, um and
then, and this is kind of I
probably should have started
with. Oh, go ahead. I was gonna
say, um M Dorsey has directed me
to there are definitions
available for that term. It
isn't defined within our
statute, And that's um
What? What? My. What I set out
to do is try to read the statute
and understand the statute
without trying to interpret it.
And I don't think that you can
do that from within it, but core
service agencies provide clients
with crisis intervention and
referrals, based on the based on
an evaluation of their needs and
qualifications of qualifications
for assistance.
Is a general definition.
So so there could be a
nonprofit.
Could be a nonprofit.
Um
It.
And affected it offer it
operates a little bit like
surplus language.
And then it probably should have
started with this question.
How many folks are detained
pursuant to these provisions
that you over the course of a
year, say.
Do we have that data?
We may have that data. I don't
have that data.
Madam Chair, Senator, Madam
Chair, Senator. We don't have
that that we're gonna have a
representative from a OC coming
later today that hopefully will
be excellent and on on 40-1 10.
Um, when you talked about
dignity, the with respect and
dignity to every citizen who is
neither accused or convicted of
a crime. Basically, you
criticized it for not having any
kind of definition and not being
actionable. But could it not?
uh, constitute a cause of
action? Or would that just be
subsumed under the Civil Rights
Act?
And that's it, Madam Chair
senator, and that's I think,
actually my my criticism of that
language.
Is
That it leaves a lot of
questions without answering, um
Without answering them. So I
think that under the under the
Mexico Civil Rights Act
Any
Person or entity involved in and
involuntary civil commitment is
potentially liable.
Um
They would be liable in the same
way with or without that
language. Well, I, I guess I was
thinking about, uh,
Dignity. Do every citizen who is
neither accused or convicted of
a crime. The confusing thing to
me is, shouldn't they be treated
with dignity as well? Um
And and what? Yeah. I mean, it
was. It was confusing and
I guess what my thought is, is
perhaps that would mean if they
were incarcerated rather than
Um
Set out for treatment. I I'm
just brainstorming what That
might mean. But I, I appreciate
it and I wanna commend I didn't
commend the presentation was
good, Madam Chair, Senator, I
would note that that section
that that, uh, requirement to be
treated with dignity and respect
to every citizen is specifically
under the subsection that's
talking about if they are held
at a jail briefly, right? So
You're right, though, that, uh
under the law, every person held
in jail who's not convicted, is
entitled to
Be treated with the same dignity
as anyone else who's not been so
it may be Supression Supression
surplus language, Just like you
talked about before. Um the then
when you talked about 43-11
Um, You didn't mention that the
public defender when it went the
right to
At the hearing. The clan shall
be represented by counsel. You
didn't mention that the public
defender would um be co would be
available to them.
Is
Is it the case that the public
defender would be available or
not? It is not
It is not the reason being that
the public defender doesn't
have. Um, well, first it it it's
outside the public defender
statute require the statutory
requirement.
Um
And they have
They have constitutional level
caseload issues already, but
they also don't have lawyers to
do that, so the way that it's
operating at this point is the
public defender refers it to
contract counsel.
So it should. It's still coming
out of the public defender's
budget.
But it's not being handled by
the public defender itself. OK,
but but the state does pay yes.
OK?
And then, um
Um and I don't know if if you
have the answer to this
question, either.
Um, when? When you talked about
the
The standards clear and
convincing, and, uh has has the
constitutionally required But
then you said there are some
decisions that are made with a
lower standard. Um, my question
is How does this work in
practice? How does this function
with
With the judge's discretion and
as it goes through
I just wanted to kind of get a
picture of what that looks like
Madam Chairman. Senator, I
think, um
The point that I was trying to
make is that less than civil
commitment. So, for example, a
OT like we discussed
Is allowed to use.
Uh, a lower burden.
So in in in a decision for a
regard to facts.
And that's what we just that's
what was discussed yesterday.
Yeah, well, the answer
specifically the statute the OT
I statute authorizes us or
authorizes the court in our
state at the moment to use it
for less.
Than for for the establishment
of facts. I think that the
Supreme Court case law would
also permit those decisions to
be made at less than clear and
convincing for outpatient
treatment. Um, but our statute
requires clear and convincing.
And and what I'm trying to
understand is what in practice
does.
Clear and convincing has a
standard look like compared to
Um
The the less than clear and
convincing the
Preponderance of the evidence.
In practice.
Um OK, Madam Chair, Senator, I
think
The E that the the
Least
Controversial answer to that
would be more than
preponderance, which is the more
likely than not and less than
reasonable doubt.
Um
There are several different
definitions for clear and
convincing because it's not, And
I think that's because it's not
the standard that's used most
often in civil and it's not the
standard that's used in so I
know that's a crazy law school
question. However, Um, how do
you think judges consider that
or I guess, have you any
examples of a judge who
Way the evidence.
And says This is a
preponderance versus this is
clear and convincing.
Madam Chairman, Senator within
my review, we were just looking
at the statute, so I'm not sure
how the a OC presentation. Maybe
we should ask a OC. Ok, Thank
you. Um and then and II. I
apologize. It's just a couple
more, um on page on 40 with
regard to 43-1 Dash 11.
You talk about
Sorry. Um
That
Let's see.
Um, it refers to a petition in
the second part, but the first
on G, the first paragraph that
refers may request the district
attorney. Is there a form for
this request, or why does it
change the language to petition?
How does this if I'm if if I'm a
member of the public, and I want
to know how to contact the D a
about this
How does it work?
Madam Chair, Senator. There's
not a forum and I think that's
because most of in in speaking
with one of the district
attorneys that does handle these
most of them are phone calls.
Most of the most most requests
to the district attorney's
office are the most requests
that don't come from the
criminal court.
Because the majority of these
are cases start out as cases in
criminal court where somebody is
found to be incompetent. Then
the then they're referred over
to, uh, the civil involuntary
commitment.
So in that in that case,
There was there isn't court
order and the court order
finding someone, um, incompetent
does include that a that a that
a petition may be filed.
Under this, OK, so it is
normally a petition so well in
the in the form to start or
preceding the petition, that
would be a criminal court order
that says a petition may be
filed against you under 43 1 11.
Or if it is a direct sort of
request to the to the district
attorney's office.
Um, generally, there isn't a
form because generally, it
starts out as a phone call about
a family member, so it's just
getting their attention.
Not the police going directly
because looking at this, it
looks like they go directly to
the das under 43 1 11. That's
correct. So if you wanted to if
a person wanted to request that
an involuntary commitment
procedure be started, then they
have to talk to the district
attorney if a person wants to
request that an emergency
evaluation happened, that's uh,
any peace officer. OK, Thank
you. And finally, um, can
addiction be considered a mental
illness?
This provision.
Madam Chairman, Senator No.
Um, and that's
So the alt statute does a better
job, I think of explaining that
you can have a co
Uh, diagnosis so you can be. You
can have two primary diagnoses.
You can be diagnosed with a
serious mental illness and also
with a substance abuse disorder.
Um
But that turns on our US Supreme
Court case law that says that,
um, substance abuse is not
sufficient.
Although if the substance abuse
manifests as dangerousness to
yourself or others. Thank you,
Madam Chair That really cleared
up a lot of my questions. Uh,
thank you, Senator. Um, Senator
Stewart? Uh, thank you, madam
Chair.
For between yesterday and today.
Uh, my head's a little spinning
No, I. I wish that someone would
put this into a float chart.
Because you know it's if then
send me two hours. 24 hours. 30
days, 60 days. I mean, if we're
trying to look at this to make
it more user friendly you you
can't even dive into it without
a spreadsheet, so I don't know
who can do that. But I think we
need to spreadsheet on a OT. And
on this one, So, thanks to Sean,
who did some work because
represent Chase. He asked me a
question.
This bill was created in 1977.
That's why we've got all that
squishy language in there. We
haven't had our hands on it
much, Uh, the last time it was
amended was 21 years ago. No.
11 years ago,
2013.
Anyway. Not good at math. Uh,
so, uh, So you know, yesterday
when we heard at the end of the
day from Justice Zamora
She threw out one very simple
change.
That's what I'm looking for. I'm
looking for changes that make
this easier for us.
Uh, So, uh, So I do have a
question. Do you have any data?
Um, how many people
We have committed involuntarily
with this statute just in the
last five years or the last 10
years. Do we know anything about
how this is actually working?
Madam chairman.
Senator, Um, we I do not, but I
believe that's what the A OC so
Within.
My charge was to read the
statute, try my best to be able
to explain the statute. So I. I
did not. I did not review data
on how many times this is and
you did a good job of that. It's
just that the statue itself is
so complex and complicated, and
there's so many ifs, ands and
who's responsible for win. So,
uh, you know if we have any
hopes of making changes it, it's
It was gotta be more clearly,
uh, laid out for me, but not
being an attorney, not
Someone who deals with this all
the time. So, um
I don't know who we can get to
do a spreadsheet, but we really
need something at a bare
minimum. And we need data too.
I. I agree. I think your point
is well taken, Madam Protein.
I'll work with the staff. Um,
both for a OT and civil
commitment. I think it makes
very good sense. Yeah, I mean,
with Justice Zamora just at the
end of the day. Well, if you
would just allow judges to order
the a
O at remember, we kept saying
you can't you can't you can't
It's a Supreme Court.
Justice is telling us No, we
can't suggest doing this. That's
what I wanna hear. I want a
clear guidance on little changes
We need to make. Yeah, we need
to rewrite
it.
You barely can understand it. It
has so many ifs and thens. Um
but I. I don't see us doing that
now. So thank you, man Chair.
Thank you, Senator. So we have
representative Martinez then
Lujan. Rep. Chay
and
Excuse me, Madam Chair before
you move on to the next speaker.
I just wanted to make a quick
correction. I'm a learned from
our chief public defender who is
in the room that the contract
budget that, uh, senators Lopez
was asking about, um, does not
actually for civil commitment
proceedings. Um, for the
respondent does not actually
come out of the public defender
budget. It's coming out of the
courts budget right now. Thank
you.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um
Mr Cummings and Miss Dorsey. Uh,
what a great presentation.
Um, I do have a few questions on
43 dash.
1-10
Um
It talks about, Um
The emergency evaluation.
Not with the shortage of
professionals across the state.
What's the timeline can
Can a person be held
indefinitely until a
professional is located to
Do the evaluation.
Two or three days. How How is
that?
In in real life. How is that
working?
Madam chairman representative.
The limitation would be the 72
hours.
So under 43 1 10 the maximum
amount of time that a person can
be detained for the purpose of
the evaluation is 72 hours.
So if the evaluation can't be
done, can't if if they can't get
an evaluation at the that at the
expiration of that 72 hour
period, they would have to be
released.
Without having had an
evaluation.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, Mr
Cummings.
Um, moving on to 43-1 Dash 11.
Um, it says, uh,
If a physician or evaluation
facility decides to seek
commitment of the client for
evaluation and treatment.
A petition shall be filed with
the court within five days.
Does the state file that
petition
Mm mm.
Is responsible for filing the
petition with the court.
So the statute places the, um
requirement for filing the
petition on the
And my last question, which is
Since I read it has been rolling
around in my in my mind and and
I've seen this come up in
different, um
Statutes or bills that we've
discussed. Madam Chair, Mr
Cummings.
On 43-1 Dash 11 commitment of
adults for 30 Day period.
Interested person who is
who reasonably believes in an
adult is suffering from a mental
disorder.
And presents a likelihood of
serious harm to the adult.
Serious home, uh, harm to the
adults own self, or is there a
definition for interested
person?
But I
Things that my neighbor is a
little
Cooked out and
Call for that.
Who exactly is the interested
person?
Madam Chair representative.
There is no definite statute so
theoretically, anyone
See that kind of concerns me.
It was the a big debate on some
of the red flag gun laws.
My fear is that you know my
neighbor.
Bothers me because this dog is
barking all night.
I just report him.
I'm afraid this guy is gonna
hurt himself.
And it starts a whole process.
That
You know, then my neighbors is
Being held and waiting for an
evaluation.
I. I think that needs to be
tightened a little bit.
Um, my ex-wife calls and says
I think my husband has. Finally
my ex-husband has finally lost
it.
Um, I talked to him on the
phone, and I'm worried that he's
gonna hurt himself.
And then I'm tied up. I mean,
how do you defend against the
An accusation like that. The
problem with this is it can be
used, Um
To hurt somebody that should not
be in the system.
And then
I have the reputation of all
this guy was being held because
of a mental disorder.
There was questions about him
harming himself.
What does that do to a person's,
uh, reputation and you know if
they do that to me, it hits the
papers and everybody knows about
it, and nobody cares about
This was a false allegation for
the rest of my career. People
are looking at me like
We need to keep an eye on him
because he'll jump off the top
of the building.
Um, Madam Chairman.
Madam chairperson.
Representative.
I would note that there's one
difference between this statute
and the red flag statute, which
is that the red flags law allows
in those in interested
individuals to initiate a
petition. Whereas under, uh 43 1
11, your neighbor in the
hypothetical
Has to convince the district
attorney that there's enough to
file the petition.
So I could take video of my
neighbor screaming at his dog,
Madam chair.
Mister Cummings and say he was
screaming at nobody.
There's you know, I take a
picture. There's a wall. The dog
is sitting behind the wall and
my neighbor screaming his head
off and I go and say
The schools on all the time he's
screaming at nobody.
I mean, there's ways to do this
to punish somebody if you really
try.
I mean, I, I this this kind of
stuff very open ended.
Really concerns me because
It can be. It can really be
used.
To to hurt somebody.
And like I said
Everybody will remember the
headline representative Martinez
goes off the deep end.
And nobody cares about
They didn't
They evaluated me. I'm perfectly
fine.
Nobody cares about the one on
the story on the third page.
In small print that says, Oh, by
the way.
He's not crazy.
I think that language needs to
be
Tightened up.
Um, especially in the world we
live in now.
Uh, that that's very concerning
to me.
Thank you, madam Chair. Uh, Mr
Cummings. Um
Miss Dorsey I. I love the
presentation.
But
That that just kind of scares
me.
Thank you, representative, Um
Representative Lujan.
Thank you, Madam Chair
and thank you for the
presentation. I
I was looking at the notes
manager. Uh 43 1-10 emergency
mental health evaluation, so
It clearly states that Yeah,
that, um
Under provision subsection B.
Uh,
Such a beauty, subsection one
and two. The Yeah, the the the
allegations have to be proven
essentially under that language.
If there is
Um, somebody making a claim? Um
and I would
I would say that some of the
interpretation of this is open
ended because because we haven't
really paid so much attention as
we are now to these laws, and I
think this is what we're trying
to do. Um, and I hope you get to
some some really good amendments
and, um, information from, um
from all of us here. My question
is, I just want to clarify Madam
Chair there is there is no um
Um, definition for
dangerousness.
Is that correct, man?
Madam Chair representative, not
within the statute
dangerousness is defined.
In in the
So dangerousness isn't defined
within the statute.
Dangerousness has been defined
effectively the short version of
the definition to others.
Do you have your mic on?
OK, I do. I just I'm scared of
it. So I've been scared too far
away, So I apologize. Thank you.
Thank you for that.
clarification and madam chair,
so I would, I would say, Is
there anywhere in this statute?
I guess as we're talking just
about this, the the addresses
the quantity of prior cases be
they misdemeanor or felony
offenses that have been
substantiated by probable cause.
Um or anything that has been
dismissed due to incompetency
findings that may be considered.
Do this. This statue and chair
Madam Chair, representative. I
think that, um under both the
43, 1 10 and 43 1 11 that would
all those prior cases of those
prior decisions. Finding someone
to be incompetent would
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh,
I think that those are
important important point in
this with any statute or
interfacing, behavioral, health,
mental health and and justice.
Um
And I know you're not here to
interpret for us, but
Through your, Um Careful. Um
Research on this bill, and as
you've presented it were the
were you would legally say are
weak points in this statute.
Madam chair.
Yeah.
I think that's a little unfair
at this is unfair for that. At
this point, OK, that's a big
question. We can talk offline. I
fair. That's especially since we
have limited time. I know that
would be my big question and I
have we can talk offline. I
think that's what we're trying
to get out. Madam chair. We're
just trying to cut to the chase.
But I, I think that, um some of
my other questions I've already
been answered or asked, and
we're waiting for him to, er
those data points and knowing
that the A OT there's just a
small percentage of of
individuals that have, um, gone
through.
The legal process. I would
assume that same to the surf,
probably less, but, um, that
would be good information to
have Madam chair.
Thank you, representative,
representative Chay.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Um, Sty and Mr Cummings for
your, um
Really good presentations
yesterday and today.
You know, one of the things we
were talking about whether the
commitment um
A OT prevented involvement in
the criminal justice system
yesterday and
And I think along with, um um as
A
I think we need a diagram. More
than a spreadsheet of comparing
them both. I think some, um
Case studies might also be
helpful. And, uh
I mean, there was just a
horrible, horrible tragedy in my
district.
Uh, when there was a a man who
was a functional schizophrenic
and was very intelligent and had
Then Decompensating and his
family and he were trying to get
medication for him.
And
They couldn't and he ended up
killing five people.
And so I mean, clearly, that was
a terrible, terrible failure,
And that's not the only kind of
thing we want to prevent. We
also want to prevent what we
mentioned yesterday of just
people lying on the the
sidewalks and and, um in in
desperate Straits and
And and so forth.
And so one of the things that,
um
Came up yesterday. Um, the
Dorsey and your presentation on
important definitions under the
A OT.
Was the, um
The likely to result in serious
harm to itself means that it is
more likely than not that in the
near future, the person will
attempt to commit suicide or
will cause serious bodily harm
to the person's self by violent
or other self destructive means.
And this is the phrase that
really, I think is important, it
says, including grave passive
neglect.
I'm wondering if that is
included in the, um
Civil commitment.
Anywhere.
Because that seems, um and and
we
Alisa. Laura and I were talking
about that being a really good
Catch off for a lot of
concerning, um, behavior where
you know, we We don't want
anybody hurt, but no person
hurt. We don't want others hurt
and so do you know if that is in
this
Part of the definition
representative.
I think that, um first, it's not
in the statute.
Second. I think that, um, within
the context of involuntary civil
commitment
That they catch all may very
well be precluded.
By the Supreme Court
limitations.
So
Um, I think that any in in in
considering future legislation
any definition change the the
difference being that a OT I
think can use a lower standard
because
We balance
What's required, uh, to to
change someone's liberty
interest with the level.
Of Liberty. The the level of
Effect we're having on the per
person.
So with regard to involuntary
civil commitment we're talking
about effectively incarcerating
Someone detaining someone
against their will, or in some
cases with their their their
agreement, But they're not free
to leave. And so there are that
when, uh
Senator Stewart pointed out that
the statute was written in 1975.
That doesn't surprise me.
All of these decisions from the
Supreme Court came down in, uh,
like 72 73 74.
And so I think the statute was
written in response to those
decisions, and at the time the
concern was over.
Institutionalization of people
who did not need it. So with the
grave, passive neglect
And I do know. I am aware that
that the state of New York uses
grave passive neglect. So
And, um, I think, uh, Madam
Chair. I think you're right,
Given the time frame about anti,
um, commitment because we we we
were over institutionalizing.
Unfortunately, we
Went
Completely the opposite and then
left people.
Without any alternatives. Um
But
You also brought up another
important point. That came up
yesterday, which is
We can't just say here. Here's
Here's what the evidence is,
because that's a purview of the
court.
So we probably need to be
working with the court. The
commission has justice or
invited us to do.
To work. Some of those, um
things out, given the rules of
evidence and and
And try to provide the, um
The framework that
A judge can
Reasonably used.
Um, I know
The court was way beyond its
Authority when I was
representing some parents in one
of our counties, um, and abuse
and neglect cases, and the court
would actually impose a
condition of, um
Of the person's court ordered
treatment plan that included, um
drug court. Well, Drug Court had
yes.
Yes.
And drug Court had the ability I
mean it. It invoked sanctions.
the judge in drug court, they
could be putting people in jail
over the weekend. This is these
people have civil charges
against them.
That happened all the time.
And, um, so we have to be kind
of careful about that, Um
So we I think we need to be
working with the Supreme Court
on whatever rules that might
affect the evidence and because
the court is actually madam
Chair
And represented Martinez trying
to be the gatekeeper for the
questions you raised.
So that you don't end up. I've
had clients whose families were
reporting them, Um
And and without merit.
And and you don't want that in
any case, and there are
penalties for it, but then who's
it's? It's hard to even get the
D's attention in many of these
cases, not because they wouldn't
want to do it, but because
they're overworked.
So
Um
The The last thing I wanna say
is that, um, I really liked, um
Representative Satan's, uh,
model suggestion yesterday and
I'm trying to figure out if we
can get our heads wrapped around
How this um
I all I can that comes to mind
is no wrong door. I know it was
something else. It was called
something broader than that. But
where people you can call and
you're just never going to be
turned away.
Oh, you've called the wrong
place. So, um, I think we need
In addition to the, um
The diagrams and the case
Studies we need to be looking
at. How do we make sure there's
no wrongdoer? So
Thank you, madam Chair.
Thank you, representative
Senator Cervantes.
Thank you, Would you? Uh, I have
to slide up. I just need the
Can somebody put up the screens
real quick. I wanted to There
you go.
Maybe.
Here we go.
So I wanted to take a couple of
minutes. Uh, because I I as we
as you're reading through this
I kind of watched the
expressions of people on the
committee all look at centers
with president smirking and the
chair smirking and it's like,
Oh, my God, This is terrible
Language really is horrible. Um
and I became immediately
concerned with my God could I
have been responsible for this
at all? And
Sort of like, uh, represent
Chasey I. I went and I looked
quickly at the research she or
the history. She got a little
different result than I did,
perhaps, but we'll will We'll
iron out their differences. The
good news is this was all
adopted long before. I think any
of us got to the Legislature. I
thought that my research looked
like it was 1989. I think well,
and then there was a I. I heard
77. But I heard it, I. I looked.
I looked to me like this section
was 1989. And then it was
revised in 2013. Now The problem
is, I came into the Senate in
2013. So it would have been my
Session. Uh so, I. I hope I'm
begging all of you to forgive me
for being pretty green when this
stuff was written, but it's just
terrible. Um and
The, um
The reason I take the moment to
do that is to caution all of us
because there's good good
learning experiences from this
The fact that this language is
so convoluted, so subjective, so
ambiguous is probably precisely
why it's not used, um and or or
why underutilized, and I had a
little different, uh, take than
I think.
The President Stewart did on
Maybe Justice Samora comments
yesterday, I. I didn't hear her
say necessarily that she needed
a small change in the statute,
uh, to be able to do things what
I really heard her say, was that
it would help her and the judges
have clarity that they could do
this, But II I at the point of
probably my own peril, asked her
repeatedly the same question
over and over again, which is to
say that they have this
authority now, uh, but they
would like to have it, maybe
more clear or more concise and
and that
Really is the point of when we
write bad statues when we when
we put in a lot of subjective
language and and and and
introduce a lot of ambiguity, we
make it impossible for the
judges to utilize the tool
because they don't understand
the tool and to the point made
earlier. Yeah, we need flow
charts, and we we we need
diagrams and graphs to
understand this and if we do so
that the judges it becomes so
unworkable. And how do we expect
law enforcement then to to use
this and understand it.
The other clue for how
unworkable this bill is, and I'm
gonna get to a point, which is
fixing this is does not belong
in a special session. That's
really gonna be my fundamental
conclusion here. But But, um and
and it explains why the
competency bill sat in judiciary
and again, I want to own that.
It's that and judiciary because
Brandon and Philip and I and
others looked at it and read it
and said, We can't fix this in
the remaining seven days that I
think we had it in judiciary. We
don't have the time in seven
days and and we certainly are
not gonna have the time in one
or two days in a special SE
To to fix something like this,
And this is what happens when
you when you get it wrong.
Um, the the work that it's gonna
take to go into figuring out um
what All of these things mean to
be up to better define them. Um
and and so forth. And I'm this
is not the language that I was
looking for. I don't think,
Brandon, but, uh, maybe it's a
here we go. Oh, yeah. Here we
go.
Let's see.
No, I'm looking for all that
squishy language. That's center.
Stewart was referring to all all
the Yeah. The treaty with
dignity was part of it. I think
it was, uh, you know you do you
can You have to do this if
there's reasonable grounds, and
if you have the and if it's the
sun is out that day, and, uh,
you know, if if all these the
stars are aligned, you do these
things And if you don't you
don't And it becomes unworkable
that the the other clue to when
a statute is unworkable for me
is to look at cases that have
been decided, Interpreting that
statute.
Lawyers on the committee will
understand as well. But you all
everyone understands the concept
of precedent. What a precedent
is, and we realize lawyers on
cases that are decided as
precedent to, uh, largely
defying and explain what we
passed here as statute. So when
there's a statute passed, and
there's uncertainty about what
we mean or how it should be used
cases go to courts and courts
issue decisions to try and
understand or explain what we
did, and there's almost no cases
at all on this statute. In fact,
I only found one case
Um and one Attorney general's
opinion, the attorney general's
opinion was, do you account
legal holidays when you're
counting the number of days that
you're allowed to hold somebody,
so that's pretty
inconsequential. Uh, to the to
the what we're trying to do
here, the the one Supreme or the
one case that was decided under
the statute was a lawsuit
against a law enforcement
officer and a and a doctor, Uh,
alleging that somebody had been
improperly detained and their
Fourth Amendment civil rights
have been violated. The court
found that against that against
that lawsuit, but that's really
the only case I've seen on this
statue. But
That tells me it's just not
being used.
Uh, this area of the law is not
being either that or there's
only one or two things, either.
It's not being used, or it's a
model of clarity, and I think we
are all pro. Probably pretty
clear. It's not a model of
clarity. So all of this is a
long winded way of saying, uh
that we can't rush things.
Well in what we do here and we
can't be passing language and
and and the other lesson I hope
we will take from this. Is that,
oftentimes? Um, a long bill is
not better than a short bill of
of a more explanation in detail
is not better than none.
This last session. We had the
with the meat slaughtering bill
was that the one that been
around here for? You all know
it. It's been around here for 34
or five years, Brandon. We took
that bill. From what? 20 pages
down to four or three. Maybe 22
Nobody complained. Everybody
voted for it achieved the goal
of what we're trying to do. We
had the, um
Affirmative consent, bill, uh,
in our committee for a long
time, Affirmative consent was
again 30 pages or so came down
to maybe four or five. It
achieves the same goal. All of
this is our way of saying that
sometimes too much language. Too
much verbiage. Too much
explanation sometimes does harm
to the ultimate, really goals of
the sponsors and the proponents
of the bills. So I thought that
our presentation on this was a
good chance to do that, Um, that
you know of that We're relying
on when you do this. Well, when
is
Police officer based on his own
observation and investigation as
a reasonable grounds to believe
these things, and that that he
present a likelihood again
likelihood of serious harm again
all completely undefined,
Unknown. Ambiguous, uncertain.
Uh, language and, um
This. This is just one page of
of an act that's full of this.
So we we didn't feel in Senate
judiciary. We could fix that in
the days we had to do it. And
and I'm I'm suggesting to my
colleagues and to the governor's
staff. If they're hearing of
their governor, if they're
listening is this is not going
to be something you fix in a one
or two day special session
either, and and and if we if we
do it wrongly, we'll find
ourselves with colleagues of
ours. Uh, 10 and 20 years from
now, Uh, just as we're able to
make fun of the work that other
Did before us, Uh they'll be
doing the same thing with our
effort if we don't really take
the time to do it right and do
it with some pride in our
authorship. So, um, I, um I
appreciate
Uh, the, uh maybe give me that
moment to explain really a a
fundamental belief here, which
is this is probably not a topic
for a special session. Thank
you, madam Chair.
I have a question for you, Um
Brandon.
So looking at your slide on
O'Connor versus Donaldson? Yes,
ma'am. I mean, um you obviously
correctly point out that
dangerousness to self or others
is, um key, but we haven't
really spoken about Anne can
live safely in freedom.
And I'm bringing that up because
we have, um, heard in other
presentations yesterday that
other states have laws that go
beyond danger to self and others
And my suspicion is they do that
with, um the within the
boundaries of the Constitution,
relying probably on language
like
Can live safely in freedom,
which we didn't spend a lot of
time talking about. So before we
shut the door on the idea that
it's only
Safety with self or others. I
think we need a little bit more
research on, uh, why it is other
states seem to have other
criteria for their civil
commitment.
Madam chair. Um I think that you
your point is well taken, Um
In terms of those changes in
other states.
Statutes that I only very
briefly looked at.
Um, those changes are re
relatively new.
And, um
There is litigation going on
around those that that expansion
Um, but you're right that it is.
That when you can show
Uh, that a person.
For and that's
That there is a there. There is
a line there or space there but
that it needs to be.
That that needs to be
investigated.
Rather than assuming that you
can or can't
Very fair point. We should
always investigate before we
assume anything. No question
about that, and I bring it up
because there may be another
reason. Of course, The statute
is horrible in terms of drafting
and and lack of clarity, But, um
Yeah. Oh,
you don't have to get up to
defend yourself, so we can we We
know what's going on here. Um,
You know, I've had people my
husband and I've had people come
to us. We're lawyers and in Los
Alamos, and they're about
parents are about fit to be tied
when they have Children, adult
Children or brothers or sisters
and they ask us. What can we do?
You know, we have somebody
living on the streets. They
schizophrenic or they have some
very serious mental illness, And
we say, not a lot.
Because unless you can show
danger to self or others, um you
you have a and you have to go to
the district Attorney and the
district attorney may or may not
assist you in your, um, efforts
to try to help. Uh, sibling, um,
family member, a close friend.
Um, we can talk about all the
dangers of a neighbor. We want
to get back at. But there are a
lot of people who need help from
these statutes, and this is not
a statute that's easy to use or
helpful for people who have
genuine
Concerns about loved ones. And
my husband actually brought to
the attention of this was years
ago. Not a local, not a current
D. A, um, of someone who we
would see in the supermarket and
he would say things like these
certain agents of the feds or
the lab or after me. I've got a
you know, He shows us his gun
and so on and so forth. Well, it
ended up with a showdown at the
guy's house with a state police
around happily. There was no one
hurt the
Individuals, not her. But the D
A would not bring a petition,
You know? So you know, I. I
totally get where people are
coming from. But this is
definitely not a statute that's
well used and we don't have a
tool that's very well suited to
help people who have those kinds
of, you know, Importance,
Sincere, genuine issue. So even
I, I agree a special session.
We're not gonna solve this
problem, but it is something
that we do definitely need to
look at carefully and not
dismiss as something that's
unimportant.
Or, um, without there's no
solution for you know, that's
often the one that's a tough
one. Yes. Um Madam Pro TEM. So,
Madam chair. Do you know if
there's any data about where
we're using this? I do not. But
it's a very good question, and
we can do some follow up for
sure. No question. Very good
question.
Thanks very much on to our next
topic, which is pre prosecution
diversion summary of the law.
Both trade seats.
Looks like Miss Dorsey will be
presenting
The floor is yours.
Thank you, madam Chair.
All right. We're up. Um, this
section. This presentation
hopefully will be more clear and
succinct than the previous two.
We're talking now about the prep
Prosecution Diversion Act, which
is completely unrelated to
issues of mental health,
Specifically, um, this is not
currently utilized to divert
individuals.
To, we believe have competency
issues from criminal
adjudications. Um
As we learned yesterday, there
may be a possibility of
expanding the statute for that
purpose. But for my presentation
today with Mr Cummings, we're
just going to be talking about
what the current status of this
law is. Uh, you should know that
later today we are gonna have
representatives. Uh, well, the
chief public defender and the
president of the District
Attorneys Association will be
speaking to you all about how
this act is applied in practice.
And, uh, what types of results
and issues they're seeing on the
ground when this law is actually
used, But this is just going to
give you a quick summary of what
the law is today.
So
Sorry.
Good in gracious, Um, this
statute, uh, the act, the pre
prosecution diversion Act does
have a purpose section and, uh,
under the purpose section, it
says that this act was designed
to remove those persons from the
criminal justice system, who are
most amenable to rehabilitation
and least likely to commit
future offenses to provide those
persons with services designed
to assist them in avoiding
future criminal activity to
conserve community and criminal
justice resources.
To provide standard guidelines
and to evaluate prep prosecution
programs. And so, essentially,
this is a tool that the criminal
justice system can use right
now, mostly through the district
attorney to identify individuals
who have been charged with a
crime. Who, um
For the most part, are willing
to recognize that they may have
done something wrong and who are
able to do some sort of
requirements to earn a clean
record. So the short version of
this is to say that they can
apply to this program if they're
accepted, and I'll talk about
that process shortly. Um, they
can complete a period of
supervision that may result in a
dismissal of their case and
again. It is supposed to be
designed to prevent people from
going through the lengthy
Complicated, expensive and
traumatic criminal justice
system when it's not truly
necessary. Um it is also
supposed to give services to
correct whatever root causes
might have resulted in the
alleged criminality and and also
the act provides a way for the
program to be tracked and
monitored.
Um, so the statute requires each
district attorney to establish a
prep prosecution diversion
program in their district. Um,
However, it does allow the
caveat that that is only
required to the extent public or
private funds permit. Uh, the
statute does lay out which
defendants are eligible for
participation in ppd. Uh, it
says that a defendant must meet
the following minimum criteria
to be eligible first that they
Have no fight prior felony
convictions of a violent crime,
A violent crime is described in
our meritorious deduction
statute that there's an
enumerated list of the crimes
the Legislature has deemed as
violent.
Ah, the defendant is willing to
participate in the program and
submit to all program
requirements and any additional
criteria set by the district
attorney and so as you can see,
As you can see, the district
attorney
For the jurisdiction where the
program is being applied is the
person who determines what each
individual participant will be
required to do during their
program. So each just
Meaning that we effectively have
a different program for under
each district attorney
Correct.
Um, the eligibility section also
states that a a person who meets
all of the PPD criteria may be
entered into the program and
also that the D a may elect not
to divert them, which again is
An interesting way of basically
saying it's entirely in the DAS
discretion. They can decide
whether to let you into the
program or not, Uh,
When you are eligible
And interestingly, this the act
does not allow the DA's decision
to decline to accept somebody
into the program to be subject
to any sort of review.
The, uh, defendant does enjoy
your right to counsel for the
prep prosecution diversion
At any stage of a criminal
proceeding that includes for pre
prosecution diversion and the
act specifically requires a
defendant to have counsel
present for a PPD screening.
Um what typically happens in
most jurisdictions, though, as
Mr Cummings indicated, each
jurisdiction is different. Uh,
is you are either hire a private
attorney. You apply for it and
our appointed a public defender,
The attorneys in the case, the
prosecutor and the public
defender decide that this is a
case that pre prosecution might
be appropriate. And, um, if that
is so and if the the D's office
is willing to consider
Person's eligibility, then the
public defender and the
defendant will fill out a packet
that has a whole bunch of forms,
which again are different for
each district and and, um, then
participates in an interview
with the district attorney's
office, whoever they have in
their office coordinating their
program as part of the prep
prosecution diversion program
you required to
Agree the defendant is required
to waive three different rights
first, uh they are required to
waive their right to a
preliminary hearing preliminary
hearing as a recap for those who
may not remember is basically a
probable cause hearing when a
person is charged with a felony
It's filed in a lower court,
Metro Court or a magistrate
court in order for the felony to
transfer to the District Court,
which is the only court that has
jurisdiction to actually hear a
felony case. There has to be
Probable cause hearing that can
be accomplished by preliminary
hearing or grand jury
indictment. This act requires
the defendant to waive their
right to the hearing, which
allows the case to be
transferred from the lower court
to the district court without
that hearing. Now the Lower
court judge will have already
made an independent, probable
cause determination based upon
the probable cause statement
filed either by the district
attorney or the case, agent from
law enforcement, uh but there
will have been no
Um
No hearing on it.
The and that is required at the
time that the defendant, um
completes the PPD application.
Then the defendant is required
to waive the right to a speedy
trial if they are actually
accepted into the program. So if
the district attorney accepts
the packet, agrees that they can
participate in PPD, Uh, as part
of the packet, they're required
to file a form waiving the right
to speedy trial and the intent
behind that is to allow the
defendant to participate in
whatever duration of pre
prosecution supervision is
required by the district
attorney without implicating the
right for the prosecutor to
later follow up on
The crimes that the person is
terminated.
We talk about that more a little
bit later.
Um, they're also required once
they're accepted into the
program to waive their right to
confidentiality in a limited
way. Um, they have to waive
their right to any
confidentiality under the arrest
Record Information Act, which
basically allows the involved
parties to inspect the person's
records.
We'll also say this isn't
included in the statute, but
anecdotally it is. There is a
also occasionally requirements a
waiver of confidentiality with
treatment providers. Um, and it
again is a limited waiver. It is
usually just so that the
treatment provider can tell the
coordinator whether the person
is attending treatment. How
often whether they're
participating, not usually
specific details about like, for
example, If it's individual
counseling, they won't be
required to disclose what the
person is speaking.
Out in counseling, but they can
confirm that the person is
attending.
Um, once the, uh the defendant
has been accepted into the
program and has waived those
rights that I've just outlined,
then the criminal case in the
district court is suspended.
It's held in abeyance. It means
it just basically put on pause
and it sits there while the the
defendant participates in the
pre prosecution diversion
program.
And this is the question that is
most important to most of the
defendants coming into the
program. How long does it last
The statutes allows the
diversion program to be a
minimum of six months, It cannot
be shorter than six months and
it cannot be longer than two
years. The district attorney
gets to decide on a case by case
basis, how long the program must
be, and the statute allows that
the district attorney can when
there is a disciplinary problem
When there's a non compliance
issue, they can
Stand the period of, um
Supervision to allow
For increased measures to be
added and to allow adequate time
for restitution.
However, even with an extension,
the total duration cannot exceed
two years.
Uh, in terms of conditions of
the program, what the
participants are required to do
during their period of
diversion that is entirely up to
the D. A. As I indicated before
the defendant has to agree to
the conditions but much like
conditions of probation. You're
agreeing to them and in order to
it's a coercive agreement. You
don't really have much of a
choice. The D A says these are
what the program requirements
are. The defense attorney can
try to limit them if they have a
reasonable
Argument to do so. But
ultimately the D a outlines.
what the the program
requirements are and the
defendant either accepts them or
does
And, uh, the only real caveat in
the statue that limits what the
D A can require of the defendant
is that the D a deems it
necessary to ensure that the
defendant will observe the law,
which is, um, quite broad.
The program is supposed to
provide individual counseling
and guidance for all
participants and require victim
restitution. Where applicable to
the extent practical, which is a
very lawyerly way of saying if
prostitution oops if
prostitution is appropriate, and
the defendant can afford it, the
defendant must pay it.
Um, usually there is AAA
restitution evaluation that's
done by the program coordinator
and they work out a sliding
scale fee based upon the
individual's income, if any
In addition, the program can
also refer the client to any
type of treatment. They can do
substance abuse treatment, anger
management, individual
counseling, parenting classes,
Whatever form of treatment is
deemed appropriate. I have also
seen it comment to require
things like community service a
letter of apology and, um
Not in all jurisdictions, but in
many of them, one of the most
controversial requirements that
is being instituted as an
admission statement whereby in
order for the packet to be
complete and for the person to
even be considered as eligible,
they have to write with their
lawyer, a full admission state
statement admitting guilt to all
of the elements of whatever
crime or crimes that they are
charged with. That document is
held.
Over the defendant's head during
the completion with the prep
prosecution diversion program.
Um so that and again we'll talk
about this briefly in a moment
if the person is terminated from
the program and prosecution
resumes that that, um, statement
can be used against them in
court against
So essentially, there would be
no need later for a trial
because the defendant will have
admitted inadmissible evidence
that they committed the crime at
issue.
Ah, that can be a really
challenging hurdle in terms of
eligibility for both for the
defendants wanting to join the
program, particularly when they
feel that they've been
overcharged. Um or they believe
that they may have committed a
part of the crime, but not
everything that's on the list
and not all jurisdictions are
requiring that in every single
case, some are and that is
inconsistent throughout the
state.
Termination. And, interestingly,
the statute
calls both successful and
unsuccessful termination. So
whether you complete the program
or not, it's called termination
If you complete the program
successfully, meaning you comply
with whatever requirements the D
A has, uh, set upon you. I'm
sorry. I forgot to mention one
other standard requirement.
There is also usually a program
a monthly program cost that is
assessed to the defendant. It's
also on a sliding scale basis.
Um, I think the lowest it can go
when I last did
This was either 15 or $25. I
don't know if that's still the
case or
Later, presenters might know
more about that, Um other ways.
You complete the terms of your
pre prosecution diversion for
the duration that it's been
established for you, uh, have
done well. And the court the D A
will dismiss your case. It's
done and over with. You do not
have a conviction on your record
on the fact that you've been
charged with a crime will always
be there unless you choose to
use our criminal record
Expungement act to seek an
expungement, but there's no
conviction on the person's
record.
If a person does not comply with
the terms of pre prosecution
diversion, the D a can terminate
them from the program and can,
um, proceed with the original
charges against the person. So
the original case in District
Court moves out of the band and
the defendant can be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law on
whatever charges they were
originally facing, and also
subject to superseding
indictment, if, by chance, they
happen to pick up a new charge.
And like I said, in the cases
where an admission statement was
required, they are not in a good
position at that point.
Uh, the statute does require
some record keeping it requires
each day D a to maintain an
accurate record of every person
accepted into the program, which
is to be required is required to
be forward to the state police
and the state police is required
to maintain accurate records of
all the information forwarded to
them from each respective D. Um
and so, presumably that
information should be relatively
easily accessible to the
committee. I don't have it
today, but we could pursue
If if the committee would find
that helpful
That is the summary of the law.
Unless Mr Cummings thinks I
might have missed anything.
We stand for questions.
Thank you. We have
Representative Onion nor
the
OK, Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Mr
So
Quick thing when you were
talking about the admission
letter.
Did you say that the defendant
when writing this admission
letter with their attorney must
admit to every charge.
Uh,
Thank you, Madam Chair
representative. That is a very
good question.
I should say that that depends
on the particular prosecutor
that's handling a case and the
pre prosecution diversion
coordinator anecdotally in my
experience as a defense attorney
with the pre prosecution
diversion program in Santa Fe,
only it was required.
In most cases, that it be every
element of every crime that
you're charged with. But that is
a a negotiation.
Um, that is not
Always the case and again
depends on who's particular who
was involved in the case. Who
the defendant and what the
charges are. OK, Thank you. So,
like most legal answers, the
answer is it depends all right.
Yes, exactly. Um, And then my
other question was, um so right
way At the beginning, the D
shall establish this program.
What is the enforcement for
that?
Madam Chair representative.
There is no statutorily
prescribed enforcement.
Excellent. Well, not excellent.
But you know what I mean. All
right. Thank you very much.
Thank you, Representative, Um,
representative con.
Thank you, madam Chair.
Yes. Last statement you made
was, uh, that, uh, if they fail
to, uh
To comply to complete the
program. We will prosecute.
And then we prosecute someone
that has been incompetent.
Ah, Madam Chair representative.
This
That is not utilized for people
who are not competent. This is a
and that was the caveat. I tried
to make clear at the beginning.
the pre prosecution diversion
program now is not utilized for
people that have competency
issues if I as a defense
attorney had a defendant who I
believe was not competent, I
would raise that issue and
pursue the competency process
rather than pursue this route.
OK, so then, Madam Tin just
from, uh, going back to
You used to call me your honor.
Ah, The question that I have is
Most of these people
I have already been are already
in some court system throughout
the whole state of New Mexico.
They lived in New Mexico.
Somebody is already here. You
know that there is some other
cohort. And I know Mr B probably
is telling this thunder 90% of
the people that, uh
We qualify for this program are
probably
Under the jurisdiction of some
other court or the same court.
So
yeah. Understand what I'm
saying. Most of these people are
already committed a crime or
have done something to where
they're already on probation or
For some reason, so I mean, so
we have jurisdiction over them,
no matter what.
Uh, Madam Chair, Representative.
I'm not positive. I understand
the question. Um, most of the
people
Anecdotally in my experience
that go through pre prosecution
diversion don't have a criminal
record. It's it's mostly
utilized for people that are
committing
Low level crimes that that don't
have a record and the statute
only requires that they not have
a violent felony conviction to
be considered. Um, but the
district attorney in their
discretion, decides who to
accept and who not to and most
of the time.
I think, although I would defer
to later speakers they are
targeting individuals who don't
have a criminal record, or if
they do, it's very minimal.
Thank you, madam Chair.
Thank you, representative. We
have representative Sapanski and
then Martinez.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um
This may be beyond the scope of
what you research, but I'm just
curious if you can shed any
light on the difference between
This program lead.
Um, conditional discharge.
And, um, deferred and suspended
sentences from and I know that's
a big question, but just
specifically from the view of
Quick access to services.
You know, sort of swift and
certain justice and the flip
side of that is swift and
certain services as you
mentioned yesterday, and I
thought that was really good.
Framing, um, because it
It. We've got this variety of
tools, but it's unclear to me
what is really working to get
people.
Into services and kind of on a
path to wellness and
Um, productivity.
Sure. Absolutely. Madam Chair
representative, Um, I'm happy to
answer that question.
So to start at the beginning,
the first program you mentioned
was lead. Um, lead is a
Is a pre arrest diversion
program, I would say is a is a
simplified way to put it. It's
also called Reroute. I know that
it's been rebranded, um and is
expanding to a variety of
communities. But essentially,
that is a law enforcement led
program where law enforcement
works in conjunction with a a
variety of community members,
um, actually used to sit on the
lead board when I was at the
public defender department at
the D A is are there, uh,
service?
Providers. There's a a broad
group, but it's law enforcement
led and so when line when
participating law enforcement
agencies interact with an
individual on the street that
they believe have, um, committed
a low level crime, but they
believe that that person is in
need of services, and that would
be a better result in this
particular case, then
Formal prosecution, they can
divert the person to the lead
program and if the lead program
if the person chooses to
participate in the lead program,
which is very similar in terms
of the types of services that
are available as to pre
prosecution diversion, um at the
end of that there, there won't
be charges filed or pursued.
Um, but the officer
Within the bounds of speedy
trial and statute of limitations
could pursue charges if the
person doesn't successfully
comply with whatever lead
provides with them.
Um, so basically lead happens
before the court system.
Then once you're once you once
charges are filed, then pre
prosecution diversion can come
into play. If the district
attorney is willing and the
defendant is willing
Um
After that, the next one I
believed you mentioned was a
conditional discharge. The
conditional discharge is a form
of a sentence. So if the
defendant chooses to plead
guilty to a crime that they
admit that they've committed
Usually in the context of a plea
agreement, though not
necessarily it can also happen
after a conviction at trial or
by pleading straight up to the
judge without a plea agreement.
Um, but when you're sentenced
for a crime, the judge can
choose to issue what's called a
conditional discharge order,
Which means that you are, um,
not convicted of the crime you
are admitting guilt to the
crime, but technically and you
are placed on real supervised
probation through the district
court.
You comply with all terms of
probation for whatever period of
time the court deems necessary,
assuming you complete probation
perfectly without any violation
at the termination of your
probation. The original charge
is dismissed. So if somebody
looks up your background if they
look you up on Nim courts, it'll
show um
Order of conditional discharge
case dismissed. Um and that can
also be expunged under our
criminal record act a year
later.
So that is a way for people to
how I describe it is earn a
clean record. Uh, it is a little
bit of a legal fiction because
it does still exist in your
record, but it it is there
limited to 11 opportunity in
your life. That's true. Yes, you
only get one conditional
discharge in your life and one
drug conditional discharge. So
one at uh, one on a drug crime
and one on
Almost anything although the
conditional discharge statute
does have limitations on the
types of crimes it can apply to
You can't get a conditional
discharge when when there's a
When someone passes away as a
result of the crime.
Um
Sorry, Goodness gracious, And
then the deferred and suspended
sentences. So if you end up
either being convicted of a
crime, or you plead guilty to a
crime, the judge can issue a
suspended sentence, which is
when they would say, um, for
example, to make it easy. Let's
say you pled guilty to a
misdemeanor crime. The maximum
sentence is one year the judge
has to do something with that
whole year their whole
jurisdiction they can choose to
suspend it in.
All or in part, so they could
say, uh, defendant I'm
suspending your year of jail
time that you've earned because
you've been convicted of this
crime. I'm in to hold it and put
you on probation instead. And if
you complete your term of
probation, then you'll never go
back to jail on this case, But
if you violate your probation
and I find you guilty of a
probation violation, I can
impose part or all of the jail
time that's been suspended.
So I say, that's like a rain
cloud hanging over your head if
you complete probation
perfectly, the rain cloud goes
away. It's a sunny day You mess
up. It rains down on you. You go
back to jail.
A deferred sentence is very
similar. But it's yet another
legal fiction. Um, where
essentially the the court is
choosing to not impose the jail
time that they that is
available under the jurisdiction
over the defendant.
Um, Instead, they're gonna hold
off on it. But it's a little bit
better than a suspended
sentence, because if you
complete your probation
perfectly without any problems,
the decent the sentences
deferred, which means it's
dismissed. So when somebody
looks it up, the court record
will say, deferred and dismissed
so again. It is not quite the
same as a conditional discharge
because the conditional
discharge doesn't ever count as
a conviction, while a deferred
sentence once earned a deferred
Missile once earned is not a
conviction for federal purposes
or habitual offender
enhancement.
Very complicated. I hope that
answers your questions. Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you. And
In in your experience does one
of these pathways lead to better
access to services?
Than others. I'm guessing that
Lead and ppd, maybe have a
closer relationship with
services, then
Some of the others, but
Madam Chair representative.
It depends. I think that, um
What is most important for any
criminal justice sentence in
terms of getting real services.
Is the
Court.
Ordering them.
And them being available in the
community.
Honestly, you could be ordered
to complete treatment.
Pursuant to any of those
sentences.
Through le through pre
prosecution diversion. It can
just a any of those versions
could have the same treatment
requirements.
Um, there was a little bit of a
difference in terms of who is
required to pay for those
services once their court
ordered. I don't know exactly
how it works. But there's less
of an issue with insurance and
Medicaid. Um I. I don't know how
that works. Maybe Brandon does.
But, um, there is some benefit
to the cost.
Uh, in the weather, it's court
ordered or like if it's with
Lee that's not court ordered. So
that changes who pays for it.
Um, but in terms of access
You get it sooner.
If you're you're being provided
services before the case goes
anywhere, So if you're in lead
or in prep prosecution
diversion, or you have treatment
as a condition of release, it's
going to happen more swiftly and
more. Certainly.
Um, but I believe Brandon might
have an answer about my cost
question. Mister Cummings.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Madam Chair representative. The
determination of cost so
The question of whether or not
the state will pay for it.
Or that they can compel, or
Medicaid to pay for it.
Um
If it is court ordered, then
generally.
Medicaid will have to pay for it
unless it's court ordered under
a statute that specifies that
the court does not have an
authority to, For example, a OT
includes a spec specification
that nothing in this statute
will require Medicaid or an MC O
or an
OK, Thank you very much. Thank
you.
Uh, thank you, representative
representative Martinez.
Thank you, Madam Chair and again
a great a great presentation.
I do have, uh
Just a A couple of quick
questions. The first one you
talked about some of the other
programs that
It was a one off.
Once you're through you don't
Get a second chance.
Conditional discharge, Madam
chair.
So does the same thing apply to
ppd.
Madam Madam Chair
representative. Not the No. Um
not exactly. PD has requirements
that, uh, you can't have a
violent felony conviction.
And that's true whether the PPD
is being offered to you to you
for the first time or second
time or third time.
Um, it's totally discretionary
within the district Attorney's
office both for the program and
for the of and for the
individual case, So, um, but
Theoretically at district
Attorney's office could offer a
pre a pre prosecution as long as
that person does not.
Hm?
Um and Madam chair. Um
Miss Dorsey on page
Five.
The defendant shall not have
No, the defense shall have no
prior felony convictions for
violent crime.
Is this program limited to
misdemeanors, or is it open to
any offense?
Uh, Madam Chair representative.
It is.
But for these eligibility
criteria enumerated in the
statute is entirely within the D
A's discretion.
Um
In my experience in Santa Fe,
which is
To be clear to the members. I
have not had a pre prosecution
diversion case in a couple of
years, so they I know they have
a new program coordinator.
Things might be different now.
Um, but in my experience, they
were not
Usually open to any charges,
where there was a real victim
and where there was a person on
the other side, who was alleging
injuries. It was mostly geared
towards misdemeanors, low level
property crimes, low level drug
crimes, drug possession. Um,
that type of low level
burglaries. Um, situations where
I hate to speak for the district
attorney, but from a defense
perspective where it seems like
we had a person who maybe made a
mistake.
Um, but didn't but knew that
they made a mistake and wanted
to prove to everyone involved
that they deserved another
change. OK, so technically
A violent crime. First time
offense, a a battery, a
Fight in the park.
He could qualify for this in
Some jurisdictions.
Under the statute, there would
be nothing prohibiting a person
charged and presumed innocent of
that crime.
From being eligible for this
program. Um, I would be very
surprised if any district
attorney would accept that
person is their program, but the
statute does
Thank you, madam Chair.
Thank you very much for the
Thank you, representative. And
lastly, Senator Cedillo Lopez,
Just a quick question. Do you
have the data about how many
people um, participate in these
programs? Or should we wait for
the A OC? Uh, madam Chair,
Senator. I have a little bit of
information about that. Uh,
because I did speak with a
couple of district attorneys.
Uh, perhaps, uh, D A Montoya
will have more specific
information and know that the
program in Santa Fe is pretty
small. Right now. There's less
than 15 people in the program. I
know the the program.
Albuquerque is very robust. And,
um, I spoke with one district
attorney Jason
Doesn't matter. I spoke with the
district attorney in
Albuquerque, who believed the
numbers were somewhere between
254 100. So from those two
jurisdictions alone, you can see
that there is a very big
Disparity between how often the
program is being utilized. Um
and
Of course, there's a difference
in the populations of those
jurisdictions as well. But, um
That is the information I have
in my experience with this
program is, uh, batters
intervention programs. This is
one way to get
People accused of of
Family violence into
Treatment or whatever, in a ball
in a bas intervention program,
and I was curious if that's
still happening.
I honestly Madam chair, Senator.
I don't know. Um my only
experience with the batters
intervention program was when
somebody actually pled guilty to
the crime and was ordered it as
part of the statutory sentence
for AD V misdemeanor.
Or felony also, but misdemeanors
in particular. I don't know,
but, um, Mister Bauer and Mister
Montoya might know. Excellent.
Thank you. And you, Uh, thank
you. Um, just, um, a few
comments primarily, and maybe a
question And that is, Does it
have to be this way? I mean, are
there constitutional limits?
That would, um preclude us from
putting a little bit more oomph
in the law? I mean, I hope I
S might agree. There's a little
Lacking in
I
don't know how to wanna say it,
Um, encouragement for more
participation with such a
program is do we? Can we see any
constitutional limits? Like, for
example, giving the defense the
ability to petition the court,
for example for participation in
a pretrial program, you know,
Um it's disappointing to see it
used so little. At least we
think so. Respond thoughts.
Madam chair. There are not
constitutional limits and
setting penalties or not for
crimes is within the purview of
the Legislature. OK, all right,
And the reason I. I reason I
brought this up to some degree
is in some of the reading I've
done on mental health issues and
There, are we? This is a
potential way to try to divert
people out of the the justice
system and into the treatment
system that that's what I was
thinking as a potential thing,
And there are there is stuff in
the literature that talks about
that as a and I think there may
be even a B a report that talks
about using pre prosecution
diversion as alternative to
competency. Um so you know,
commitment and so on response
See you are interested,
Madam chair there are there are
other states that have much more
robust statutory pre prosecution
diversion.
Um, that specify who is
Who which which people would be
eligible. Make it non
discretionary. Specify how it
works. Things like that. Well,
yeah, Go ahead on that point, um
Mr Cummings is correct. And also
I know that currently at least
in the second judicial district,
there are circumstances in which
the DAS office is utilizing
this.
As a true diversionary program
where they are saying, if you
get linked up with certain in
very limited cases, the right
circumstances, Of course,
they're very careful about it.
Um, but if you get linked up
with the right treatment
services, we will dismiss your
case.
Um, without requiring more
because they believe in those
circumstances That is the just
outcome. So already there is a
possibility for it to be
utilized.
More under the current statutory
framework, and also I think it
could be expanded upon without
constitutional concern. OK,
right, so we know of competency
is raised, and it's a low level
crime. There's a high
probability that the, um crime
is gonna get dismissed anyway. I
mean, is that a fair statement?
If the person Madam chair if the
person is not competent, it will
be dismissed. OK, so we have
another opportunity to use a
tool where someone is where
their mental health is at issue
and
Could use a system like this to
help encourage treatment, as
opposed to competency, which we
know at the best will get people
to restoration and ultimately,
dismissal of their case, Madam
Chair that particular Avenue
does raise more concerns for me.
Um, and I think that this was
touched on a little bit
yesterday and and it is worth
discussing is that it is the
ethical responsibility.
The defense counsel and the
judge when there is a concern
that a person is not competent,
the pre prosecution diversion
program does require the person
to knowingly intelligently and
voluntarily waive rights like
speedy trial and prelim person
who is not competent or or might
potentially not be competent,
cannot make those waivers and it
defense attorney could not
ethically ask them to right and
so, in my opinion based upon my
research to date if I as a
Attorney had a client that I had
suspicions was not competent. I
do not believe that under the
current statutory framework I
could ethically divert them
without raising the issue, OK?
If the framework were changed.
That's right. That might be
different. OK, very good. I
don't wanna prolong this week.
You know, we had very good
discussions. Really? And thank
you both for the hard work on
your presentations there very
helpful. And, um, I'm sure we'll
be talking more about a number
of these programs. So thank you
very much, and we can move on to
the next item.
Which is perspectives from the
public defender and
The administrative office of the
district Attorneys on pretrial
diversion.
What works and what does not.
Mhm.
I would just get them. Put them
out there. Um, just in terms of
well, people are setting up just
for the committees. You know
where we're going and where we
are at
We're a little over. My
suggestion is we try to, um,
wind this down around 1215. We
do have, um, lunch. I believe. I
hope
Being brought in. So that would
allow us a 45 minute lunch and
we might then be able to get
back on to, um, schedule. So,
um, I'll keep you posted in
terms of what's going on with
lunch being brought in. But I
think that is has been a tricky
one. Look at that.
Well, good to see you,
gentlemen.
And I appreciate your
willingness to participate in in
the conversation. Um, Mr Bauer
and Mr Montoya, Um I don't know
who wants to start but Mr
What we
Mhm.
County. They're driving workers.
I
Can I interrupt you? Is your mic
on? Because we're somebody. I
guess we're having trouble
hearing the gentleman.
Online, OK, very good. We're
green. Thank you Pro TEM, and so
I'll step a little bit back away
from it.
And, uh, lastly, we have T
behavioral health program that
helps with mental health
services. Those are our three
resources and again, they're not
specific to any in particular
persons, real needs and
underlying traumas.
That being said in Colfax
County.
We have three that all deal
with, um mental behavioral
health crossroads.
And will and alternatives to
violence.
Again, not a robust set of
resources for us to house within
the district attorney's office.
a pre prosecution diversion
program, real assistance and
services and programs.
So that's why I think lead is
great. And now we also in Taos
County, but you have to be in
the criminal justice system is
the healthcare Assistance
program, But you have to have a
pending case in order for the
county to allow those resources
to benefit you. You have to be a
defendant and in the system so
out of system resources are very
limited and you know to go back
to. I guess those dealing with
True mental behavioral health
issues.
The MO most DAS, including
myself, so I mostly just speak
as to what we do in the eighth.
We can't take on clients like
that. Because we don't we can't.
We can't offer the supervision,
the monitoring or the resources
to make sure that those
individuals are receiving best
practices or even adequate
resources. And so we, um and and
and it goes hand in hand with
defense attorneys and so how
they get referred in the A
defense attorneys will refer
just as many cases for PPD as
the prosecutor does to the
Listen to our director, because
we do want to, um
Unclog if you will, for the lack
of a better term, the criminal
justice system. The fewer cases
Geared towards more the more
violent and heinous offenders
for the purposes of trial in
public safety and
accountability. Those are the
ones we want in the system. So
in the eighth, the defense bar
as well as my office one as many
people diverted to whatever
program including pre
prosecution diversion, So, um we
are also on a case by case
basis.
Regarding the admissibility, the
the admission statement, and
it's not our practice to
receive.
Admission statements on every
charge for every element. It's a
very generic, the state has
enough evidence to proceed and I
have done this without any
elemental part of the admission
statement. Um, and we waive that
when it is kind of victimless.
additionally, it even if you are
terminated, unsuccessfully, and
we do reinstitute prosecution.
Um, this is the PPD track. You
start on it. The prosecution
aversion if you're terminated
and we reinstate charges, and
the reason we do that, I would
Very unofficial poll. Most of
those are because you picked up
new charges not because you
violated the the conditions in
terms of the pre prosecution
diversion contract.
You. You got a PPD reinstate
prosecution typically and now
you're back in the criminal
justice system. We're gonna go
to an attempted, which is if
it's a felony, ratchets it down
to a misdemeanor for it to be
fine to a misdemeanor or we will
go ahead and, um, offer as far
as as part of a plea, a
narcotics conditional discharge
or conditional discharge or
deferred, Um, something again
not prohibitive when trying to
get employment or impactful down
the road. And so we don't wanna
be in court in my very short
And a half years in the eighth.
We've taken one ppd termination
to trial.
Um
The conditions are fairly
boilerplate. The reason they're
also fairly boilerplate is
because of the resources we have
to send. And so there isn't a
robust services conditions and
terms contract.
Cause we don't have anything
else to really divert them to
matters. Intervention. Certainly
if they are domestic violence
offender, um sometimes will make
donations to crime stoppers or
Operation Game thief because we
do accept fraud cases or guides,
Uh, hunting who make money off
of this, and they've been
charged in
Uh, that's where we are. So I
think I'm at about, um
Seven minutes. I don't really
have anything else to offer
except a comment on the old
statutory language, and so, um,
I think to some great questions
earlier what qualifies
Everything qualifies.
Every every underlying charge
qualifies.
Yes, with victims involved.
We're gonna certainly take into
consideration their their
opinions and thoughts on the
disposition of the case, whether
it's PPD or a plea or going to
trial. We're always gonna do
that in compliance with the
victim's rights Act. Um
However, this was the
eligibility prior to 2019 or or
18.
There was one real algebraic
criteria now.
No prior felony convictions for
a violent offense.
Previously.
You had
Six.
No prior felony convictions for
a violent crime.
Um or any felony for 10 years.
Um
Two.
The, uh, crime alleged cannot be
nonviolent in nature, but all
with the exception of domestic
disputes, not involving a minor
Again gone, So now we can do
child abuse or domestic
disputes. Uh uh, with Children
involving Children.
There was another criteria
Eligibility. Three.
The defendant couldn't have been
on probation previously.
And or if they were to have been
revoked, or unsatisfactorily
discharged. The defendant
another criteria for
Could not have been admitted
into a similar program.
Such as lead or something other
Five.
Had to be willing to
participate. That's the only
criteria now also, um
And it also couldn't include
previous language. Uh,
substantial sale or distribution
or possession of, uh, controlled
substances. And then, of course,
the D a terms. Um, just as a put
it in context.
Six years ago to today, and so I
think that's why it's imperative
that the since anything any
underlying crime can qualify for
PBD, I think discretion is
Imperative.
Uh, I guess with that, Uh, I'm
sure I'm really stand for
questions. Unless we want to go
to Mr Bauer, and then we can
bolt down the questions.
I'd like to go to Mister Bauer
and then we can have a
conversation. So
A human here. Let me know if
this, uh, microphone is not
working. My name is Ben Bauer.
I'm the chief public defender
for New Mexico. Uh, let me just
tell you briefly some of my
background they they goes into
this issue. I started my career
as a public defender in
Albuquerque. Uh, I went to Santa
Fe, where I had the pleasure of
working for Henry Valdez. Who
was the elected district
attorney at the time, and, among
other things, I was assigned for
about two years to do the civil
commitments for the district
attorney's
And so I have some experience
with the way that process
worked, which is, uh, it was
very cumbersome. It was also
madam Chair. You talked about
getting calls from family
members who were distraught
because of adult Children or
other family members and asking
you what you could do and having
poured through the statute at
that point, sometimes talking to
my boss about it A lot of the
time. The answer was not much.
uh, but when there were options
when we could get an evaluation
when there was something really
serious, we went forward.
Those in my approximately two
years. I probably only did half
a dozen. Uh, in in the first
judicial district. I don't
remember how many but there
were. There were some that were
important to do that we had the
resources and the expert
Uh, testimony to go forward on
And so there is a statute in
place, which I think can be
used I. I also think that the
the Council for that is provided
there is, by the way through the
a Ministry of Office of Courts.
Are rights with the local
attorneys as they do, uh, in
many places for abuse and
neglect, and I would suggest
that a OT council if you do pass
a statute, such as that also
should go through contracts with
attorneys that appear on civil
dockets, Uh, in the same way, so
there's al already sort of a
process for that, uh, for civil
commitments, which you could
transfer to a OT kind of
representation.
Uh, I asked the chair if we
could pass out this, uh, chart.
For the record, providing a copy
to council.
Uh And, uh, it's sort of a
confusing chart when you look at
it in one page, but I think it's
sort of helpful to see how
confusing it can be. This came
out of a mapping process for
approximately two days, Uh, in
the first judicial district. It
was convened by, uh, Judge Mary
Marlow. So, um, she was assisted
by Tom Stark, who at that time
was consultant at the first
Judicial district for our
Criminal Justice Coordinating
Committee and for
Two days, Everybody sat around
and talked about all the ways to
process worked. How, um, how
people accuse of crimes. Uh,
intercepted with the criminal
justice system, and then we
mapped this out. Uh, and it it's
a little easier to read when you
put it up on a wall. Uh, but the
flow charts are very complex,
but I think it's helpful. Yeah,
it was very helpful for us to
look at every place where you
can take, uh, defendants out of
the system and one of the things
as a public defender.
That I really believe in is that
for most defendants, they
earlier we can get them out of
the criminal court system. The
better and so on This chart the
further back we go, the better.
Why is that? First of all, I
think the criminal court system
as you may have talked about
earlier in this process in my
mind, Uh, 100 years ago was much
smaller 50 years ago, it didn't
deal with behavioral, health and
substance.
These issues as much
We had different ways as a
society to do that. We lost a
lot of the, uh, the ability for,
uh
For alternative ways of
addressing it. And so over the
last few decades, it's become
police officers as a point of
contact, and, uh, arrest and
prosecution is the way to deal
with those substance abuse. Uh,
and behavioral health issues and
that I think that's really
unfortunate. The system itself
takes a toll on people, and so
many studies have shown that for
people who are fairly low level
offenders the more times that
they are arrested the more time
they spend in jail. Uh, the more
time they're away from
Families that they lose their
property over and over upon
arrest of their cars impounded
that they may lose their pets
that their Children are taken in
the CYFD custody that they lose
their job at WalMart and have to
reapply or find another job
After a week in jail, the more
we use a system do damage to
those people and make it harder
for them to recover and come
back and be productive members
of the community and so the
earlier we can get people out of
the system, uh and away from the
court system, the better
That's not talking about people
who harm others, and I think
that's what the court system
needs to focus on people who do
harm to others in the community,
you know, uh, crimes of theft
crime, especially crimes of
violence. Those things have to
be addressed in some way, but
through jails and prisons
prosecution
And even probation. We often
don't do that pre prosecution.
probation falls somewhere in the
early part of the line of that
contact with somebody accused of
a crime. Um, Lee. We talked
about lead. I was on the board
of, uh, law enforcement.
assisted diversion. Uh, in Santa
Fe County. When we created the
first in New Mexico, the second
in the country after Seattle.
Uh, we created what is now
called Reroute and Reba County,
which is a form of law
enforcement assisted diversion
as well.
Or earlier in the process,
generally sort of police officer
or even a family member can
refer somebody rather than
arrest and, uh, we have found
some success again. This is kind
of a harm reduction model and by
harm reduction. Uh, what I mean
is a simple part that you reduce
the harm you do to people or
that they might do to, uh, the
community. The future prep
prosecution diversion comes in
after arrest when it's sitting
on a district attorney's desk.
Uh, there may be charges,
fathers probably
Initial charges filed. If it's a
felony, then they're considering
whether to take it to grand jury
or a preliminary hearing to take
the district court. That's
usually where those decisions
are made. Uh, there are 14
district attorneys around the
state. Uh, there are 14 very
different prep prosecution
diversion programs. Uh, I can
tell you that, uh, in Santa Fe
County when I was in the
district defender here, there
was a wonderful program where
the public defender and the D a
So much that we invited them
over to our office once or twice
a month, they would actually
send out letters to people who
were, uh, offered prep
prosecution diversion. Those
people would be summoned into
our office. They would apply
with us they would talk to us
about the application process.
We would go over to discovery.
uh, that somebody from the DAS
office or staff person.
Would be sitting there and then
speak to them speak to us. The
process would be done in a day.
I never knew of anyone that
failed that program.
Because it was set up for the
success.
Of the people accused of crimes.
Uh, I. I am told that in
Albuquerque right now, uh, for a
long time, Um, and you probably
saw it on TV the previous, uh,
district attorney complained on
TV about the public defender not
to collaborating with them on
prep prosecution diversion
program. I can tell you is
because
Uh, they required, uh, signed
confessions on in every case and
let me tell you what that's a
problem. Some district
attorney's offices use the PPD
program is basically a dumping
ground for bad cases when they
don't see the evidence. They
decide. I would rather, um, send
this to ppd, but I can get a
signed confession. Uh and, you
know, sometimes the defendant is
gonna say I would rather do that
than risk being charged and
trial And so we have to guard
against that, as defense
attorneys and
Sometimes we don't co-operate
and we don't recommend somebody
going to the program because we
think we can win at trial. Uh
and possibly they were actually
innocent also because sometimes
the requirements are are so
tough that we know our clients
after talking to them cannot
complete them, for instance, in
the fifth Judicial district
right now in Roswell to apply
anybody from Roswell has to go
to Carl's bed. Uh, which is
about an hour and 15 minutes.
And I mean for you and I, that
May not be that big a deal for a
lot of our clients. It is to
have to drive their, uh to apply
in person and go through this
process also
As far as I know, they have to
sign admissions in every in
every case, every application
and the conditions of, uh, of
success of completing the
program or often, uh, more
cumbersome than probation. And
so there are very few people
from our office that go into
prep prosecution diversion
because of that, so I'm laying
out some of the differences
between the programs. Why I
believe some of them are very
successful in Albuquerque. Now
we've
On from a program that had very
few people in it to a
collaboration. Where I I heard
the other day that I think
there's almost 400 or at least
we're going towards that, Um
And and that is because, uh,
they I believe they're
reasonable. They look at the
case they they reach out to the
public defender's office. We
trust that people will go there
and will succeed that there are
people staffers at the D's
office that want them to succeed
that are invested in that
success and that the the contact
with the criminal system is the
minimum amount to see that
success which for us is very
important. So finally
You need to have a successful
pre prosecution probation
program. I think it is what we
need to do, and it's it's not
just changing the statute, but
it is, you know, going into the
communities, the districts and
the counties. Uh, training, all
of us having public defender and
the D a sit down, collaborate on
how this is gonna happen.
knowing what resources are
available for the district
attorneys to send them to and
encourage and incentivize the
use of these available
resources.
So we we support the programs
when we believe that they are
effective for our clients and
madam chair members of the
committee. Thank you for having
me.
Thank you very much, Mr Bauer.
Many questions.
Representative O.
Thank you Better chair.
Just curious. I can send a
county
Um
Or you Endows county.
Everybody that has a, uh,
misdemeanor has to go to the
Magistrate Court.
And when I'm looking at your
chart here, you're talking at
municipal and you're looking at
district or pretrial services.
Uh, you don't have anything set
up through the magistrate
courts.
Madam Chair representative of a
good question. Uh, as I briefly
touched on during my, uh,
presentation is
These are services that are that
are available to lead
participants. Magistrate. Uh
defendants and District Court
defendants
even in Magistrate Court.
Unfortunately again, you're not
diverted. You're still it's
still a condition of being a
defendant charged as we do have
diversionary courts available to
both magistrate and district
courts, such as family violence,
court drug courts, and hopefully
soon a, um
A, uh, veterans Court, uh, to
Address specifically the needs
of the traumas of veterans
suffer, but
All of the surfaces and services
and and programs and facilities
in the eighth are available to
all individuals at all of these
points, whether they be pre
arrest
Charged.
Indicted
Prosecuted or discharged.
I'm sorry, Madam Chair. I forget
about that thing. I, uh
I kind of answers to my
question, but it still leads up
in the air. The fact that that
is around the case is basically,
uh
Uh, after arrest, uh, end up in,
uh, in in Magistrate Court for
the first hearing.
And then from there it goes. I
mean, even a case is heard in
the Magistrate court, and I'm
just thinking, how come we don't
have the day Bruce and part
right there.
In the
Instead of, uh in the district
court to the municipal
Madam Chair. Uh, representative,
a con. There is diversion
available at the Magistrate
level. Yes, there is it. It's
not just the the district court
level.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair and,
um
I want. I wanted to ask and and
I. I think you can both perhaps
address this, but it was when Mr
Mentor was talking that, um,
it was suggested I ask you about
the, um, data that's kept about
the successful outcomes versus
non successful Would that be
available to us? Because what
we're hearing as of yesterday?
How how much more data we
actually need on the
effectiveness.
And how we can, um attribute, Um
Things accurately as to whether
they
They're working.
So will will we get that from
the state police or where do we
get the data? Uh, Madam Chair.
Uh, leader Chay. Uh, we can We
do house a lot of data that we
can run a query and generate
some numbers for you and I'm
guessing
As far as numbers are concerned,
Uh, if we could distinguish,
perhaps between successfully
discharged unsuccessfully
discharged
And terminated.
Um, However, yes. So I think we
can get you those numbers if
that's what I'm hearing the
question being asked, right and
and Madam chair, so if
terminated includes both
successful and unsuccessful
whatever you know, just so we
know exactly what we're we're
getting from you, but we should
ask you rather than the state
police. Right, Madam Chair. Uh,
Leader Chay. Yes, Yes. Yes, we
can do that. Thank you very
much. That's all Madam chair.
When you say you can do that.
Can you do that for the whole
state or just your district? I'm
just wanna get clarification.
Madam chair that IT well above
my pay grade so I can get an
answer. I just
Senator Cil Lopez.
Thank you. This is actually
another data question. Um, but
also if you could answer just
the top of your head. What are
the types of cases that normally
um you you select, for example.
you mentioned, um, Batter's
intervention program.
That would be something a
deferral. You know somebody who
could participate in not a
deferral, but somebody who could
participate, um, drug and
alcohol, somebody who could
participate.
What other kinds of bread like
what's available for thieves,
for example for theft cases is
housing available, for example,
if they were
Uh, yeah. If you could just tell
me what kinds of
Program. What kinds of cases
typically typically go through
these programs. Madam Chair
Sanders Lopez. Thank you for the
question, and I really I can
only speak to the types of cases
that exist in my office and they
do primarily, a lot of them are
your misdemeanor cases,
certainly domestic violence if
the partner is willing to come
in, and
Right. We're gonna consult with
with with the victims to make
sure this is perhaps a one off
for that pre prosecution is is
is proper. But, uh, thankfully.
The eighth also has now the, uh
Taos Family Violence court,
which is very effective has much
more resources much more
monitoring. And so, um, that's
probably a better program than
pre prosecution diversion just
because of the resources and
monitoring supervision and
participation by everybody in
that, Um, but yes, we also, um
do battery we do, uh, we we we
do.
Larceny. We do
Fraud. We do possession.
Of controlled substances, um,
even aggravated battery,
depending on the circumstances.
Um
And
Typically, and that's why
In the eighth. It is nice that
the defense Bar recommends a lot
of these because they're able to
speak with their client. They're
able to determine what their
client needs way better than the
state can determine, because as
we all know, the state is not
allowed to talk to defendants.
Um so where our information from
the prosecutors, Prosecution
side is limited. So, um, we can
only identify the type of crime,
not a type of offender. Um,
necessarily outside of absent
criminal history review.
So the defense Bar does the best
job of referring and determining
what conditions and terms will
most likely lead to successful,
Um, discharge from prep
prosecution and Madam Chair and
CEO
Lopez. Uh, again, The programs
are so so different, uh, across
the state almost every level of
crime theft crimes. Uh, fraud,
larceny, bad checks up to
battery cases. Uh, burglaries,
but, uh, I I know D.
You know the the higher the kind
of offense gets the more
concerned.
For very good reason They are,
but it it's a good point from Mr
Montoya that it depends as much
on the person
As the charge is, Is it someone
that can be successful with
minimal supervision? And are
they willing to offer them that
chance to really keep their
record? Clean from any any kind
of conviction? You know, not a
conditional discharge. Not uh
uh, you know, and not being on
probation, and some places they
supervision is minimal. Which
again? If you think about the
harm reduction model that is, I
think that's really really good.
because you don't wanna be
requiring drug testing for and
there are some programs that
require
Even when the crime wasn't drug
related. That's one of the
things that we have is heartburn
or coming in every week.
When a person when our client
doesn't have transportation, so
it is very much the person and
both sides looking at it to see
whether this person can be
successful in this program and
not be a danger to
Thank you and and manager, Um,
the family violence court, um,
that that was mentioned I. I
don't see it on the chart. Would
that be under the intercept
Three jails courts?
Madam Chair, Senator. Yes,
that's correct.
I'd be interested in in looking
at at that It's not a domestic
Uh uh. What? What does a family
violence court do other than
supervise people who are on that
as intervention programs, Madam
chair. It's very similar.
Senator. It's very similar to
drug Court and veterans Court,
So you are charged. It's a
condition typically of either
conditions of release or
probation. Um, in order for you
to, uh
Rehabilitate and comply more
holistically with the family
unit. Um and so we have, uh,
community against violence. We
We have five stakeholders who
appear at all of these hearing
and reviews to make sure that
Both the offender and the victim
are on the right track to
rehabilitation.
Our victims required to
participate.
Madam Chair, Senator. That's a
good question. I don't think
they're required to participate
now.
Thank you cause that is not best
practice to require, but they
are allowed. OK, Thank you.
Thank you, madam Chair.
Thank you. Other questions,
Comments from members. Uh, this
is a
How can we make a more uniform
program?
I mean, I. I have spoken to the
second District. I've had a lot
of conversations with what they
do.
And, uh, they view using
pretrial diversion as a very
good thing. Um, we have many,
um, serious crimes in the state.
No question. Second District
probably sees a lot of them.
In the way they view it is, uh,
it gives the prosecutor and the
defense to focus on the crimes
that are of huge consequence and
alternatives for people who are
operating at, you know, lower,
you know, Misdemeanors, low
level felonies, and I guess I
find it concerning I can go to
the district in second District
and have a great conversation
about what they're doing. See
that It's it's very well
utilized. And then here, um,
that in other parts of the
state, the D
Aren't really looking to try to
utilize this program to any
significant degree. So how is it
that we can work with the DAS
and and the PD to get better
participation in program that
will benefit their offices?
Cause we we're we're having
fewer trials on things that are
lower level and people get a
chance to rehabilitate with all
without the taint of, uh, a
prosecution, So how can we do
that?
I'll. I'll step up on that man
too. Uh, having talked to our
offices across the state and and
some prosecutors, um,
you have to incentivize a
culture change. Um, you know,
some of these local court
systems and local DAS. First of
all, they don't think that's
what their community wants,
frankly and so they're just not
potentially not gonna do it. Um,
I. I think that's unfortunate
because I think it's a lack of
understanding of a again.
Damage that the system does to
people if you put them through
it, Uh, but incentivizing, uh,
again, training, maintaining
encouraging them some kind of
financial incentive, um,
measuring success of people who
don't who don't have contact
with system, not not just
graduate from a program but you
know if we if we don't see them
again, you know at some point if
somebody's not getting arrested
again, first of all, it means
that they're not being
Uh,
They're not on the radar of law
enforcement, but that generally
means they're not harming other
people and that that that's
important it's not just
completing treatment program.
It's just being able to go about
their lives. So, uh, I, I think,
incentivizing the programs
you're never going to make.
Every judicial district the
same, but we can bring them
along and again in the second
three years ago.
Um, there was probably 1/6. The
number of people in prep pros,
Same laws, Same place, um,
different people in charge.
Thank you, Madam Chair and so
I think uniformity for one, and
as far as I'm concerned is
scary. Uh, all of US law
educated. The, um resounding
only agreement we have is when
you ask a question of legally is
the answer is it depends and not
all communities are are going to
be uniform and nobody is going
to be uniform. It's like asking.
How do we make sure that laws
are uniformly passed here? Um,
you want one? Yeah, you know,
construct legislation and
construct.
A prosecution. It does largely
depend, and it depends on the
objectives of of the program. I
don't think this program was
developed to handle a societal
issues. Um, as much as criminal
issues. It was
Again. I and I'll and I'll
restate criminal justice system
is not situated to take care of
mental behavioral health issues.
We don't have the resources. We
don't have the providers. We
don't have the facilities and
so, um, if you wanna be frank,
the ability to use pre
prosecution diversion is a
Second chance opportunity.
Um
We do Wanna
Integrate rehabilitative.
Functions as a part of that.
Opportunity. I just not real.
It's not real in New Mexico, and
it's not real in the eighth.
So I don't know that we make it
uniform. And I'm not sure that
it needs to be uniform. Um, I
guess I don't know if I don't
remember hearing me use the word
uniform, but, um
I What I'm asking is how can we
get the DS and the public
defenders to look at this
program as a more useful thing
than apparently, some are
Madam chair. I guess it would
come down to
Resources. Um
In hearing that some districts
just use it as a tool for a lack
of evidence. Screening
processes. Everything in our
industry. Uh, the sooner you can
front load, a review of a case
and the strength and weaknesses
of a case. The
Better streamline the system can
be And in all fairness, uh, the
understaffing of both sides just
doesn't allow for that. And so I
think if we were to be able to
have more front loaded review
screening of cases to determine
a track, I think that would be a
great start. That's that's a
That's a helpful suggestion.
It's It's a very good point. If
I May that and again having the
resources available that are
trusted by the district
attorney's office and the public
defender to send people to that
would support them.
And um representative Laura CAA.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I
appreciate it, Um, your closing
comments and remarks here, but
it does bring something up for
me. I as well did not hear you
use the word uniformity. But
when I think about the kind of
policies we've debated in my
three terms here, um, this does
raise significant questions for
me about new Mexicans and the
communities they call home so
that if you're in the northwest
corner of the state to the
Southeast or to the South
Central, where I represent you
may be in a very similar
situation.
But have different opportunities
in front of you in which to
navigate what it is that you're
living and what it is you're
facing and I think for me as a
rap to this morning's
conversation of a significant
question that I'm holding is as
a state Legislature. What? What
do we see as as the foundational
Policy we want to establish. Do
we want these to be politically
based decisions sometimes
connected to the resources
available and the investments
the states made in your programs
where, um, locally elected D
have more say about what
opportunities are available to
people in the civil and criminal
legal systems, or do we as a
state body feel like there
should be more of a standard
where new Mexicans have a
reasonable expectation of what's
in front of them. So I I
Appreciate your question, and I
think that remains not not just
for these presenters here, but
for us if we do, in fact have to
go into a special session. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Very good.
Thank you, representative anyone
else?
OK, so food is supposed is
coming. I don't know if it's
arrived, but, um, at some point,
there'll be some pizza in the in
the ante room here. People are
hungry, but I think we're ready
to
Um, recessed for the lunch hour.
Come back, please. About one
o'clock. Ok, thank you.
