I.
Did you.
7.
Thank you thank you

for
the way he teaches,
um, you will see.
I apologize.
In
2008001.
Um,
and
um
for the just
just regular um and Francis
Our report.
Any questions?
Use
Hey.
you
have any any any other um
No,
no, not.
And
Uh, uh, well,
thank you.
I want what you feel is best.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So, so,
we wanted to be rein.
Or the the original um.
That's it.
before
Yeah.
No, no,
I,
I agree.
All right.
Thank you,
in its implementation of the
Act.
We just went to the original
language.
Um,
thank you um.
Evans.
I'm, I'm.
and as
we
simply use the original
mission the duty and the
authority
to protect rights and waste.
adds to that
that
duty and the authority to um
you are.
This is.
So there seem to be confusion
around,
we want to.
This duty and authority.
And and the reason for all the
reasons that we presented here
on Tuesday, which
is right now
it is.
The act and when it is
conducting its duties.
It does not.
And
so this gives them an
additionality,
which means that.
when
issuing.
for the tens of thousands of
fracking sites across our state.
It could consideration.
environments.
That
would be
considered of public health and
the environment.
So this is our current age.
This is Bill Bill.
Is it better if I just raise my
voice?
I'm so sorry. So this um
original language in this bill,
public health and the
environment was passed back in
the 19th happened and changed in
our state.
And with oil and conservation
division in, in these last
almost 100 years.
And so it's time to give this
additional authority and duty to
the state as it has this
enormous job of regular
industry, which has grown
tremendously, um, especially in
the last decade in our state.
So this is just a small change
to the act.
Doesn't change the fundamental
purpose of these to prevent
waste and protect the rights of
mineral owners.
But in doing now have a duty and
Representative Sao, would you
like any further statement? Um
no.
OK, thank you just for
clarification of the room, so
our visual is for our webcast is
not on right now, but we are in
compliance with the audio and.
And I have a show of hands of
anybody who.
If you would like to speak, can
you stand up so we know?
Terribly sorry. Um, I do feel
that I, we did not get public
comment.
Uh
what you're gonna thank you very
much I do appreciate that.
And yes, I will, I do apologize.
I will follow. We won't take
full public comment, but we have
a state official comment as well
and then.
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you for what you do.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you to the sponsor of
House Bill 34. I am Stephanie
Garcia Richard on the state land
commissioner, a statewide
elected constitutional officer
responsible for our 13 million
acres of public state land, uh,
some of the newer members of
this committee I have not met
yet. I apologize, but I am here,
um, in my capacity as a
statutory member of the Oil
Conservation Commission, um, and
as an individual who oversees
oil and gas development on 2
million acres of our
State public land in the Permian
Basin, um, as you heard, uh,
Miss Evans say oil, the oil and
gas Act has been king in our
state for almost 100 years since
the 1930s. It's had a handful of
updates since that time, we, as
constitutional officers cannot.
Uh, perform any duty as pertains
to oil and gas without
Staying within the guardrails of
that oil and gas Act.
Um, so the legislature dictates
how oil and gas is promulgated
in the state of New Mexico. What
we are asking for is these, are
these additional guardrails that
probably were not even
contemplated in the 1930s when
this, when this oil and gas Act
was first drafted.
Um, so that the cumulative
impacts on public health, and on
citing on what is included, uh,
in particular oil and gas
activities like PAS.
That we look at the cumulative
health impacts on the community
directly impacted by these
activities, as we promulgate the
Oil and Gas Act is my standard
support and the land office.
And thank you very much, uh.
Oh, yes, we are.
Thank you, you're first on our
list is uh representative of
Moya.
Um, questions. Um, so this
brought a lot of question, um,
Madam Chair and Representative,
um,
How is I don't wanna emergency,
oh, I'm sorry, energy, mineral,
natural resources department,
um, oil conservation commission.
So if you're giving, and you're
giving this duty to oil
conservation division, um, like,
are they OK with the
Thank you for the question. Um,
we have spoken with, uh, Ben
Shelton with the Oil
Conservation division of Amnerd.
Um, I believe he's the acting
deputy director and general
counsel.
Um, and he has stated that the
department would certainly
appreciate having the additional
authority, um, that it would
come with additional work, but
that they would appreciate
having that. Um, thank you,
Madam Chair, but, um, but yeah,
they're like, nobody's here and
actually gives official comment
and that they're OK with it, uh,
because it is a huge.
Oh.
So, um
OK, so I understand. I think
when, uh, cause now that we're
dealing with it from Tuesday,
um, I believe that, uh, the
reason, correct me if I'm wrong,
you said that the reason why you
did not define uh protect public
health and the environment is
because it is correct.
Uh, thank you for that question,
Madam Chair and Representative.
No, the reason it's not defined
is that in consultation with the
legislative council service, um,
who drafted the bill. They did
research and found that the
terms public health and the term
environment are used in over 60
of our 77 statutory chapters,
the term public health is not
defined anywhere in those
statutes, the term environment
is
find in one place, it's in the
pesticide Control Act, and it's
a pretty clear and obvious
definition that says environment
means land, air, water, and the
living beings in that land, air
and water, something to that
effect. Um, and so it doesn't
seem that a definition of these
uh very basic and well-used
terms is required or has been
required in other places in our
statutory.
scheme. I'll also just add that
the terms public health and the
environment are already in the
oil and gas Act in 3 sections
concerning um the authority to,
um, deal with the disposition of
a liquid waste from the
industry. And again, so that we
are not introducing new terms
into the act. Thank you. Thank
you um but um my
I, I kind of in, in some way a
little bit disagree with the
with the that a public health is
a term because, I mean,
To be honest with you, my
definition of public health and
the executive branches as we've
seen in some of the things that
she's done in the past. So, uh,
so, so using that, so now
you're, you're giving.
Another department, um, the
ability to help this.
Not a definition of what public
health is.
Ma'am, I believe we've.
We've discussed what what those
provisions are already in
existence provisions and and
have that what is documented
rather than and and all due
respect, um, Madam Chair,
Representative, as perception. I
don't believe it's perception. I
believe that.
Madam Chair there.
Might be, well, there is no
definition.
I sure for reasons already
stated, I think.
I feel we fulfilled that
question. If not,
If you had anything else to add.
Yeah, this certainly could be
defined in rule, um, by the oil
conservation division. They do
use these terms in their rules
already, um, and that certainly
is something that they could do.
Hm, OK.
Um, so
They are so who a little bit,
um, Madam Chair, and, uh,
representative there.
The terms because you put them
kind of back in there, uh, but
necessary. Again, that's more of
a matter of perception. Thank
you. That's, that's language
that already exists.
Yeah, but now we're giving them
more, sorry, Madam Chair, we're
now giving them more authority.
So I want to clarify you're
giving more authority to a
Uh, certain entity, and now
they're, they can do whatever
they want and it's not defined,
however they interpret it.
And you're basically giving them
an open chat to do what they
need to do.
Thank you. It is authority
within their current duties of
implementing the act. So if you
turn back to the first page of
the bill.
Provided that in that act and
implement that act in a manner
that protects public health.
And um
Madam Chair, uh, Representative
are, um.
Is there other entities right
now that are.
Monitoring this stuff at all
and, and so that's why we
Thank you for that question. So
there are two, Madam Chair and
representative, uh, there are
two agencies, um, that's the
environment department and the
oil conservation division, the
Environment department does
manages air quality and it
manages air quality when it
comes to oil and gas production.
The
Oil conservation division grants
a permit to drill for every
production site in the state.
And so there is some overlapping
jurisdiction in that both
departments are um authorizing.
Fracking in our state, but right
now when it is the oil
conservation division's primary
job is granting these permits to
drill, and then the oil
conservation division is then in
charge of regulating and um
enforcing the rules around oil
and gas production in our state,
which is far more than um
Just monitoring air quality and
enforcing air quality
violations, which is the job of
the environment department. The
environment department can.
Uh, and has a duty already to
protect air quality in our
state. That's in the air quality
Control Act.
But the oil conservation
division does not have a duty to
protect the environment. And so
by adding this duty to the oil
conservation division, it means
that it too would have that as
part of its job, just like right
now that is part of the
environment department's job. So
certainly both agencies that are
responsible for various aspects
of oil and gas production and
pollution in our state.
Both those agencies need the
authority and the duty.
To control pollution and to
protect our environment.
Madam Chair, I, I kind of have
an, uh, the, the fact that
you're saying that you want to
give.
Um, Representative, I don't
believe that's what she said she
just said that they'll both have
the, the, the duty and not both
of them.
Already exist. Madam Chair, she,
uh, she says that they're, well,
they're giving them the duty for
um the to protect the
environment and that's something
that one doesn't have and the
other one does.
And now she's giving them both.
Correct. Isn't that what you
just said?
Madam Chair, Representative,
they both have different jobs to
do in overseeing oil and gas
production. So the one agency
that already is in charge of air
quality already has a duty to
protect our air quality.
The other agency, which is not
in charge of air quality. It's
in charge of uh granting permits
to drill, regulating how that
drilling process occurs,
preventing spills of toxic
liquid waste, cleaning up that
those spills, getting the wells
plugged that are no longer in
use, remediating the land after
the use. These are all jobs of
the oil conservation division.
They do not have the authority.
To protect the environment when
they are authorizing new
development, and this would give
them that authority.
Madam Madam, go ahead.
And tell me if I'm wrong, but
more
to do than air quality when
the environment.
And, and we're hearing.
And, and Madam Chair,
It's, it's OK with our
testimony.
Testimony
You know, being given.
If she doesn't understand what
she's giving.
But let's let's give true facts.
And not just try to
By, by our testimony.
I, I think we need
To take this job serious, it's
gonna affect.
All the way from education.
In the state to, to uh our
budget in, in, in a majority
way.
If we pass bills like this.
And I just don't feel like we're
being honest right here and put
Thank you, uh, Representative,
um, I will allow the presenters
to clarify, uh, what I heard was
the question was specific to
environmental auditing and so
that was what I heard was the
air control that it was
obviously not a list of
everything of NMED. So, um, let
us let the art with the testify
and, and we'll we'll let you
clarify for that, but thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Madam Chair. Thank you,
madam.
And I'd just like to say and all
this is very serious, and I too,
as when I was a freshman
legislator, needed to and even
before that to differentiate
between what NMED does and what
OCD does, which it can be, it
can be, it's complex because
year after year we give them new
objectives, we give them new
duties, we, we want to um make
sure that there's compliance. So
all fairness, but this is very
serious and, and if you, if, if
you see it in any other way, I.
apologize. That's not what are
my intent or any of our intents,
we want to have a full
conversation, but what we are
differentiating specifically
today is what Madam Chair um
mentioned is what
Not all the lists of everything
that they do because we can take
a lot more time and tell you all
the things that each of those
departments does. Um, but we are
trying to give authority to this
other department because of all
the oversight that they have and
to give them an additional
oversight with um with the
duties to, to have that
environmental scope, um, Madam
Chair, if you will, and I'll
have our expert, um, clarify
even further.
I, if you, if you think that
thank you very much and, and
thank you. I, I think that we
have clarified that that was
what you were answering specific
chair.
Um, so, OK, so you say that
there's different things, but
um,
The, uh, environmental
department.
Um
Earlier
Uh, earlier in your definition
of um environment.
You, you said that the only
defin have now.
That is what you said. You said
the only definition that was out
there uh was something to, to
monitor air quality and, and
water and soil and like all like
taking care of all of it and,
and everybody knows this.
That was the term everybody
knows.
Um
Again, we're I'm sorry to
interrupt representative, but
that it was that the
environmental
we can, we can have them
clarified, but the statement was
that this was on advice of the
LFC.
was not an opinion by the
executor was legal precedents as
in uh numerous times in Madam.
Um, do you, could you, um,
representative and, and, and
presenting a Mirabel.
Madam Chair Representative, what
I said was that this was on
advice from the people who
drafted the bill, which is
legislative council service and
the drafters there and that they
did research and found that the
terms public health and the term
environment is used in a vast
majority over 60 of our 77
chapters and those terms are not
defined except one place where
the term environment is defined
in the pesticide control.
and there is a definition there
that I was saying was something
along the lines of environment
means the land, the air, the
water, and the living beings in
that land.
See, um, Madam Chair, um.
I'm still madam chair and just
in a different seat.
I see, that's what I'm saying is
that we're still duplicating and
all, the FIR.
Um, the one, or, uh, and then.
Let's see, one from Attorney
General.
like every single, almost every
single report from Energy,
Minerals, Natural Resources
Department. Every single one
says this is duplicated.
Every single one.
And, and, and so my thing is,
um, I think in your.
Initial
Um
I don't know. I think it was uh
Representative Seranao that was
in.
These um
Stats, it was somewhere around
cause I I thought I wrote it
down somewhere, but 70% are
emitting above the legal limits,
is that Madam Chair
Representative, I believe you're
referring to a stat that came
from the environment department
secretary Kenny, who said that
in their, um, in enforcement,
uh, investigation they had found
that, um, about 70%, um, were
not abiding by the law.
70% of um emitters or like
polluters in our state. We're
not abiding by the law. Um, but,
uh, a little bit different
before. But um, but my
So again, Madam Chair
Representative, again, it's um a
little bit confusing because
that stat came from the
environment department, the
Environment department, uh,
enforces the air quality Control
Act, which has a, a duty to
prevent what's that duty on the
environmental improvement board
and on the environment
department. This bill
It does not involve the
environment department. This
bill involves M nerd and it's
division called the Oil
Conservation division that is
responsible for um issuing
permits to drill and for
regulating and implementing um
the Oil and Gas Act, different
act. Thank you, Madam Chair, but
you're, because they're not
doing, cause you're you this.
Uh, because this isn't how we
need to give someone else. I
mean, um, Madam Chair, it's,
it's kind of like if um.
If you'll indulge me for a
second, it's, it's if that my
street has a speed limit of 355.
Like, so you're, you're creating
a new one because the ones that
are there to monitor scopes of
practice, if you will, so uh,
Department of Environment has
their duties.
And OCD has their duties. We're
simply applying the scope or
broadening the scope for OCD and
what they manage.
And
Thank you, Madam Chair. Then
Representative, why is every um
every um and um.
And the analysts or whatever or
analysis, there you go.
Why are they all, Madam Chair, I
will defer to my expert.
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative.
Um, these are not duplicative
duties.
The New Mexico Environment
Department implements the air
quality Control Act, the Oil
Conservation division implements
the Oil and Gas Act.
They have different
responsibilities, the two
departments under the two
different acts. This is simply
an amendment to the Oil and Gas
Act.
OK, so, Madam Chair, correct me.
So you're saying Environment
Department has nothing to
Madam Chair Representative, I
did not say that. I said that
the environment department
implements the air quality
control Act and the Oil
Conservation division implements
the Oil and Gas Act. This is an
amendment to the Oil and Gas
Act.
Um, this
Madam Chair, um.
And Representative, this uh this
bill adds a lot of.
Um
Are, are, are they ready for
that kind of like, do they have
the.
I'm sure we're not creating a
whole new division. We're, we're
adding duties as you said, that
is, that is true. Um, and much
to what um.
In our budget requests, we are,
we are in discussion in uh in uh
AAFC right now and looking at
how uh those budgets and what
they're asking for from this
different agencies and
reflecting on some of the, the
policies that we're looking to
enact this session, so they go
hand in hand. So if we were to
enact this piece of legislation,
then yes, we'd have to perhaps
go back and look at how we could
adapt or um help the budget uh
line item if we.
If at all possible.
Um
Um, I could, but I'm not going
to.
Uh
Yes
I think, um.
I think at this point I'm, I'm
thank you representative Mirabel
Moya.
Welcome back.
Sure did, Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
And thank you
I want to build off a couple of
representative Mayor Bob Moya
brought up.
You know, from the witness stand
from uh.
In the
Madam Chair during the
presentation Representative, I
really hope that you're not
accusing anybody of perjury.
Please do not do that.
Or it was presented the, the
June tour.
Um
referred to in the committee
meeting itself.
Talked about a significant
amount of things with.
With that presentation, man was
how that just to the east of us,
no similar requirements for air
quality. So,
The entire presentation from
Texas A&M assumed everything.
The boundaries of the state of
New Mexico.
In the Permian Basin.
We had a great presentation that
followed that, that defunct most
of that.
Um
The uh
And, and that just concerns me
when we look at stuff.
We talked
from
Representative Moya.
With respect to getting clarity
on how many different
places would get or departments
would get.
The additional powers.
The bill is very clear. It adds
the power to two different
departments. Conservation
district and the, the
The responses was, no, we're
only giving it to one.
And what's in the very
department, Energy and minerals
in charge of this already has an
obligation for public health and
environment.
Still very unclear as to why we
need to do it again, especially
when the AG's offices.
That wasn't something that was
written in the original
language. I am thankful that
they finally had an opportunity.
The Department will review this
bill.
And times.
This is cross jurisdictional,
and it is going to create
problems.
Not saying that this isn't
something that should be.
We're refu
Most of you legislation in the
last couple of years.
I'll be bringing bypass some of
this to
Make it a constitutional
amendment, but
We give, we legislate.
And I had this conversation and
I'm I'm getting to a point, but
I had this conversation with one
of my colleagues, um, that was
Defending a bill
And Madam Chair, when, when,
when I uh department secretary
opposes this.
The comment was very specific.
I
I get to write the rules. I get
to write the laws.
Well, when we write a law, as,
as
In my opinion, as poorly written
as this.
Where we give all the power.
To rulemaking.
Bureaucrats.
Um, instead of defining it,
public health, instead of
defining means or whatever is
reasonably necessary.
I'm pretty sure we have.
A multitude. This legislation
creates more problems than the
sponsor, in my opinion,
attempted to solve.
Just by not defining to a bunch
of the words within the bill.
I could go into the deep is
probably read them, the, the
FIRs, all the things that are
currently wrong.
From the regulatory is already
current law and requires OCD to
do this.
It's, it's not really hard.
With respect to that says this
is a really, do you have a
question for the sponsor?
I'm sorry? You have a question
for the sponsor?
I do, uh.
And I had some other examples
I'll probably get to them a
little bit later.
So, we have all these
departments that are, Madam
Chair, that are
telling us
that well from the DOJ saying
this is gonna create lawsuits.
So, Madam Chair.
Mhm. Giving us their their
factual information as, as
guidelines, um.
And this is to a modernize and
update and give an additional
authority to a division that
doesn't have that authority.
Um, much to what we're debating
about the Air Quality Act and
the oil, oil and gas act uh uh
OCD and and apply all their
duties that they have now. We're
giving them an additional amount
of.
With adding
And environment language.
Madam Chair and and
representative, once again,
we're giving.
Our
legislative duty.
Uh.
Let them promulgate the rule.
Oh, we don't want to write the.
Let them make it. And then so
that way, if we don't like it,
then we can complain about it
and.
You know, we've got.
Example after example where in
70-211 MSA we've got 70-2-12.
Uh
20.2.5.
But I'll say these powers are.
And
From, from MA, Madam Chair,
Currently, the OCD evaluates
impacts on the implementation of
its rules, these terms intended
in general census process is
already being carried out in the
legislative intent of the bill
is very
Group that you're writing a bill
to give more power to already
says it already exists and
material that makes no sense to
me. Yeah, why oppose the very
department that says they
already have the power.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative, um, right now,
and it's actually clearly stated
by the Department of Justice.
Presently, the regulatory powers
of the OCC and OCD under 70-2-11
are limited to preventing waste
and protecting correlative
rights. HB 34 would expand that
by adding powers to protect
public health and the
environment. So those duties are
not there, and I can explain why
in um a different section of
The Oil and Gas Act, and I, and
this is the provision of the Oil
and Gas Act where the oil
conservation, um, commission,
uh may pass rules.
You know, around certain
matters. The division may make
in rules and orders in respect
to certain matters.
Three of those matters relate to
the disposition of liquid waste
from the industry.
Though in those three areas, the
oil conservation division does
have the authority when
regulating liquid waste from the
division to protect public
health, the environment, and
freshwater resources. That's
where those terms show up. That
is the only place that those
terms show up in the oil and gas
Act. It is when the giving OCD
when making rules, the authority
to consider public health and
the environment when
ul ating liquid waste. That does
not go to its overall authority
by adding this language to the
oil and gas Act, we would be
expanding their authority so
that not only can they do it if
they want to when they're
regulating liquid waste, they
would have the authority and the
duty to do it in all aspects of
their job when a regulating the
oil and gas industry.
in this case
they already have the ability
under the word prevent.
to
if there's definition of the
word prevent.
Madam Chair Representative, um,
the term prevent is used in
terms of preventing waste.
Um
It says waste is prohibited.
Um, that, so the, the oil and
gas Act, you're prohibited from
wasting the resource.
And you have a duty to protect
correlative rights of mineral
owners. That's in a different
section of the Act. So waste is
prohibited.
And
The, the, when OCD is
implementing the act, it is
confined to do things within the
terms of um how what they're
doing is uh preventing waste of
the resource with the exception
of what I mentioned when it
comes to the disposition of
toxic liquid waste a few years
ago when the produced Water Act
was passed in 2019, that
authority to protect public
health, freshwater.
resources in the environment was
added to those 3 sections I just
mentioned. So, right now, the
oil conservation division does
not have the authority to pass
regulations, say, for a health
buffer zones around schools, for
example. That's correct. They
could not do that, um, without a
statutory change.
chairing and presenter, thank
you so much for that respect to
prevent.
waste isn't defined anywhere
else throughout.
The entire you have with DOJ,
Madam Chair, Representative,
that's not what I said, the term
waste is defined in the act,
and it's only defined by that
one definition. There are
multiple definitions of waste in
the oil and gas Act. There's a
whole section 70-2-3 waste
definitions, and it has
different types of waste, and
they are defined. The section I
was referring to is one of the
introductory sections of the oil
and gas Act.
70-2-2 waste prohibited is the
title of that section.
And it says what I just said,
that the
The the mineral crude petroleum,
oil and gas, um, waste of that
mineral is here.
Thank you, Madam Chair. So as a
As an attorney, as a of the Oil
and Gas Act.
The term waste.
And the term prevent only work
and.
Adam Chair, representative, that
is not what I said. In fact, the
entire, all of the act is
written around uh prohibiting
as Madam.
But, but, um.
It happens.
Pick a subject, because we have
public health and an environment
already.
And I already has the power.
That's defined in multiple
places. Iner already has that
response and part of their
prevention job is the other
piece of the oil and gas and.
or public health stuff that's
inside of the responses from the
DOJ and everybody else. And Maun
chair and and present so we can
pull out each and every part in
the definition of that. Can you
go ahead and ask your question?
OK, so.
I, I, I just see that we're
trying to.
Let somebody else.
a problem that we have here
where
Um, because we have all these
departments that are telling us
this is this can within the
departments and so.
We look at
When concern from the
environment standpoint, respect
to that, how many in
from oil and gas derivatives
that's relevant to
this bill.
Madam Chair, the reason why I
asked that question
was the beginning of the reasons
why we have because the cancer
creating the oil and gas
industry has.
We can go back and play for day
one if we need to.
Definitely not gonna do that
right now.
So that's the reason why I asked
that question.
Madam Chair Representative, the
reason we have this bill is
because there are over 70,000
oil and gas production sites in
our state, and all of them have
been granted a permit to drill
by the oil conservation division
without consideration of the
environment or public health.
And the reason, one of the
reasons for that is right now
the oil conservation division
does not have the authority to
consider public health or the
environment when they're
granting.
permits to drill. So, I disagree
with your uh summation of what
the oil and gas Act currently
does and doesn't do.
And I believe that the oil
conservation division would also
disagree with you, and it's a
shame that they're not here to
answer your questions. But I
have been working, um, with
trying to protect and put in
place protections around public
health and the environment from
oil and gas pollution and the
oil conservation division does
not have the authority right now
to do that. There are other FIRs
that have been written.
For House Bill 35, which is the
bill for health buffer zones
around schools to protect
children who are going to school
close to oil and gas production
and pollution. The FIR from the
LFC on that bill and the FIR
from the LESC on that bill, both
discuss and document the the
science that shows that being in
proximity to oil and gas
pollution is harmful.
And risky to your health. It
creates respiratory problems. It
creates asthma, it creates
cancer. The science is clear.
That information has not been
put in these FIRs, um, but I
would refer you to those and I
also would be happy to provide
you with the science that peer
reviewed over 70 studies showing
the health harms connected to
proximity to oil and gas
production.
Madam Chair, I'm gonna close
with this Madam Chair, if I go
out and buy a or an electric
lawnmower.
I can have them. Thank you.
Thank you Zamora, Madam Chair,
move to table.
Uh, there is still discussion,
Representative Amona there, so
I'm going to let, you're
included on that list.
Do you have questions to ask? If
not, I'll move on. I'll move to
Representative Perea withdraw.
Thank you.
that the tabling motion is
there. Thank you, Madam Chair.
reasonably necessary to carry
out the provisions of that act,
and, and I think.
They can look at it, but they
don't have to do changes and uh.
Thank you, Representative, um,
Representative Lara Cadena.
I appreciate, uh, at school.
Many decades ago, and my kids
passed through there as well,
um, but it means people from all
over the state, but including
young Peo, um, as we stepped
into
And I will get back to the
scavenger hunt after I asked
these questions and we take a
vote. Uh, so if you see they're
trying to learn and listen so
that scavenger hunt open to all
of us? Because I think we could
all use a little fun, especially
if there's good prices, maybe we
should get in on it, um.
I do have a couple of questions
on, on the committee sub as
well.
Um, I think I'm one of the rare
members, Madam Chair, that has
worked in state government and
um in a previous I was the
bureau chief of recidivism
reduction at the New Mexico
Corrections Department.
Um, I sure learned a lot being
on that side of things I had
previously spent years with and
had to hold the weight of what
ideas that legislators thought
were solid.
Um, so I very much I'm compelled
by your intention you had with
you um when we started this.
Um, in Madam Chair, to have been
in hearing and to be um someone
who lived in such close
proximity to where this industry
is active, um, but to not have
considerations or math. We
don't, we don't have Mr. So here
again today, but, um, but it
also raised questions for me,
um.
I'm not as concerned about
whether or not public, but I
have a lot of curiosity to do,
like what tangible things would
it mean health and environment.
Um,
but that I'll I'll, I'll pass
that off as my first question.
Um, what tangible pragma Thank
you, Madam Chair and
Representative, and I'll just
explain that Mr. So isn't here
because he had a major, uh,
water leak at his house
yesterday and he had to get
home. I think he was planning to
be on the Zoom. I can't tell. I
don't know if he's on the Zoom
or not.
Um
But one of the shocking things
that I had learned from Mr. in
his, uh, community and around um
the counselor area of New
Mexico is that the way folks
find out that a new fracking
site is coming close to where
they live or work or go to
school is that they see trucks,
sand trucks going down 550, and
they follow the sand trucks to
see where the trucks are going
to see where the
new fracking site is going to
be. What always shocked me about
that story is that I live in
downtown Albuquerque, and when
they're going to make a movie in
my neighborhood, I get a notice
on my front door saying we're
making a movie down the street.
Is this going to be a difficult
for you? Can we get you a pizza
or do something to accommodate
the extra noise and light that
might come with this movie.
These folks live near fracking
sites.
And they don't even get notice
that it's coming.
Uh,
many other states when a new
fracking site when someone puts
in an application for a permit
to drill, the state would do
some kind of environmental
impact assessment. Um, the state
would allow folks to come and
speak about uh the, the harm
that they perceive would be
coming and about the, the, the
problems that that fracking site
could cause in that exact
location. So,
Um, Certainly OCD under with
this bill would have the
authority to put in place rules
that um could require notice
that could require, um,
environmental and public health
considerations about where that
fracking site is going and
whether that's an OK place to
put one. The state could pass
rules that put in place health
buffer zones that keep fracking
sites away from schools, keep
them away from hospitals.
These are just some examples of
some of the things the state
could do that it currently does
not have the authority to do.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I, I
really appreciate that list, and
I, I guess what's sitting with
me less convinced on, on what's
the agency in this bill.
And more compelled to talk about
public notice, to talk of Madam
Chair and, and Representative
you this effort when I actually
think we can debate.
Are those noticed? I worked in
downtown Albuquerque for years
if it made it through the floor,
but we're having so that we can
actually debate um the, the
setbacks, the maps, like I, I
think it would have like Mr. So
said document New wells, um, or,
or new. I appreciate the
intention here. I'm not
completely sold, and I look for,
I, I'd be more appreciate the
intention. I'm not
representative Matthews very
quickly.
Because we, we have to go to the
joint floor representative
Zamora.
Thank you, Madam, and thank you
for allowing me and
Madam Chair, there are rules in
the rule book that we get to
speak as much as the madam,
if we want to start going
through Zamora, go ahead and go
ahead and
ask your question in the
committee.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh
So
Madam Chair and
Colleagues, uh, there was a
statement made here earlier that
That this bill was relaxed.
And
And, uh, Representative Herrera,
uh.
specifically said that she feels
better about the bill.
And
If we look on page 2.
Line 4
And it says whether or not
indicated.
Or specified in any section of
the Act.
And
Madam Chair.
when we write a bill
that has this strong of a
language.
And, and represented a Pettigrew
hit on it.
I'll repeat it again whether or
not indicated or specified in
any section of the act.
So
It doesn't matter what rules we
write or what laws.
We promulgate here in Santa Fe
if we write rules like this on a
bill like this.
We're gonna turn
OCD rogue and, and they get to
do whatever they want.
And then we're gonna find
ourselves in the lawsuits.
We're gonna find ourselves
In committee again trying to fix
something that we didn't look
at.
I wanted to point this out to
the committee and
That's, that's all.
Um, Madam Chair, I'd like to
make motion for a do pass on
house agricultural asaa and

Highly qualified expert witness

Have very, very part-time staff.
They have audits like you said

responded sometimes like, you
know, several weeks, but these
districts here.
Uh, to the state.
And those that don't have
full-time staff really are not
be able to do that. So just in
the last year, uh, the local
conservation districts. So we
need them to have staff. Um, we
all the assea work up there, so
that money we worked directly
just going back a couple more

One minute.
But gently place it underneath
Madam Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Abby
O'Connor and I represent the New
Mexico cattle. I am a 5th
generation rancher myself, and
we support this bill, and when
we talk about riparian
restoration water projects and
healing of the lands, um, that
is the work of our soil and
water conservation districts
across New Mexico, when
landowners wanna do these
projects on their land, often
the first place that they go is
the soil.
and water conservation district,
um, they come alongside these
landowners to help conceptualize
projects, develop a plan to
implement them and secure the
funding to do so to execute
these projects.
Um, across the state, many
projects that are restoring the
landscape, have the fingerprints
of the stolen water conservation
districts on them. Um, we urge
you. Thank you. Go ahead.
Good morning, Madam Chair,
members of the committee, Howard
Hutchinson, I'm uh chairman of

A few years, uh, we've put about

dollars onto projects.
Water conservation.
Stream restoration, erosion
control.
And we work with our local
producers, uh, to assist them
with uh getting funding from the
federal agencies through the
Natural resource conservation
Service.
We are in support of this and.
Maybe the committee uh can see
fit to me. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair and
committee members. I'm Jim
Berle, registered lobbyist with
the Inservation districts, and
we'd just like to places in the
state, as you know, Madam Chair,

leverage more state and federal
funds.
