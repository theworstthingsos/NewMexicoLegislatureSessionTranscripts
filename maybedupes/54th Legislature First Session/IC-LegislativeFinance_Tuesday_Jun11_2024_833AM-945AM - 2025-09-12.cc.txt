uh that we build while we're
here in Carlsbad, New
Mexico. I, I
share that with you because
first thing this morning, about
six o'clock, I started
going around this area
and I really absorb if
you will, the karma and the vibes
that, that all of you
bring. And,
and there was one thing that I uh
ran across and it
was one of the
uh
I guess you might go ahead
and call it one of the sayings
that are out there. And it
was really something that was very
profound and it said,
uh I ask God for
love. Uh
and he gave me parents
and so to each and every
one of you as we go forward,
I want to thank you very much for
the opportunity to be here.
And uh I want to just
really thank God for, for
our parents because that's the
reason why we are here.

Right? And for
members, there's a mobile
treatment tank
outside, uh,
semi that treats
water and it's mobile. So
if you take a break or need a
break or during lunch, we can run
out there with that, we'll get
started. Who's starting to Mayor
Cobb and
Mayor Bowen?
Bowen in
Rick
Lopez.
Emily
Emily, you're gonna start us, we'll get them
at the table and you're gonna start
us. >> Yes,
good morning, Mr. Chair members of the
committee. My name is Emily Hilla. I'm
an analyst for the LFC.
Just really quickly. If you turn to
tab A in your
binders, uh, the local government
dashboard for Eddie County in the
city of Carlsbad. I just
want to point out a few
things of their local
finances. So if
you turn to page two, you
can see in the
graph on the left
that the Eddie County
General fund balance increased from
fy 21 to Fy 22
by about $93
million. This is mainly
due to increases in oil and
gas production and equipment
taxes. Uh,
further on the left hand
side of page
number two, you can see that revenues
for Eddie County are well over
the expenditures
moving on to page three really
quickly. You can also see the
city of Carlsbad General
Fund balance. Some
important things of note is
that the city Carlsbad
spent the remaining of its ARPA
funding at the end of fy
23 with about 2.3
million going towards
public safety efforts.
Those are just a couple of things that I
wanted to point out to you all today. But
otherwise there
are our guests here
to talk to you all this
morning,
>> whichever one you want to
start.
Ok. Mayor
C Good morning,
everyone.
>> We're proud to be part of that.
And uh we hope
that your visit here. You, you
have an opportunity to get to know a
little more about our
industry and
uh some of the many things
that we have, we have some issues
that we need the support of the state
with, with some of the produced
water issues, some of those types of
things. And I would be remiss
if I did not remind
you of, of the
uh unintended consequences of
HB six. Our
communities continuing to grow.
We're having to expand
infrastructure. We're having to take
care of our interior streets,
police and fire protection.
And one of the primary
industries is fueling that
growth uh through the
destination sourcing is
still uh having
a severe negative
impact on our gross receipts.
So please bear
that in mind as you would have your
deliberations regarding our
tax policy in the state
and anything I can do
on behalf of our community, please
feel free to call on me at any time.
Thanks so much for coming and taking the
time to be part of our
community.
>> Good morning, Mr Chair members,
um Rick Lopez, mayor
of Carlsbad and welcome
to Carlsbad and um
I hope you enjoy your stay here
and your get out and about
and uh and
uh and look at at
what we have to offer.
I'm honored to, to welcome
the steamed bi part
legislators and the
legislative finance committee
staff to the Permian
Basin. I
would, I would also like to
thank and welcome our local
industry leaders and community
members for
supporting the oil and
gas industry. As
everyone knows, the oil and gas
processes in
Southeast New Mexico are
vital to
the state's economic
lifeblood. The city
of Carlsbad supports our oil and gas
industries and thousands
of men and women who
work in the industry
um who are friends and our
neighbors. This
industry is not only fueled
our homes and businesses
but also played a
pivotal role in development of our
communities.
We're all here to work
together on safety and to protect
our environment.
We appreciate the importance
of cooperation
in ensuring that all processes
are handled in a way
that is best for our
residents and water
and our natural resources,
our oil and gas partners in
the area have been great
to work with our strong
community supporters,
our community and neighbor commun our
community and our neighborhood
communities
have benefit from the partnerships
we've crafted over the years with
industries. I want
to highlight the importance
of long term oil and
gas production and its
continued benefit to our community.
For example, the expansion
of our industrial park showcases
the direct benefit
of a thriving oil gas
sector.
Um The support to
our local schools, our nonprofits,
our health care systems,
the mental health support ensuring
our communities can handle growth
and challenges
investment in roadway
improvements. The Arrowhead
study, the collaborative
effort between companies
counties state that
discovered that the average
Eddie and Lee County resident contribute
much more to the
state's tax base
uh that is spent on than
what is spent on them.
Eddie County has since done an excellent
job in educating the state
legislature
the on the issues hoping
that we will understand the importance
of our area's
infrastructure.
Strong economies
have attracted additional
businesses including renewable
energy ventures,
manufacturing projects and
opportunities and artificial
intelligence
diversification prepares
us for a sustainable
future.
We acknowledge that oil and gas industry
has also brought what
some would call hardships
to our communities,
which I'm sure Mayor Cobb
would possibly agree. Rising
house costs, lack of
workforce increased
traffic are all issues we face
today but rest assured
the oil and gas companies
remain strong and transparent
partners working
diligently to address these
concerns and to support
our current and future
residents.
The commitment is crucial,
especially
given the this industry's
significant role in local
and state economies,
we must avoid
overregulated the sector allowing
them to operate
efficiently, particularly in the
permian and San Juan
basins.
Our community has
proactively implemented
setbacks to
ensure appropriate spacing from oil
and gas facilities.
These longstanding regulations
have been carefully crafted through
local vetting and community
input process ensuring
that they meet the safety
and environmental standards.
However, it is crucial to address
and unintended consequences
of recent legislative actions
back in 2019, as Mayor
Cobin mentioned House Bill
Six with Dein
destination sourcing,
this is financially
impacted our local economies
in Carls be and hubs
in conclusion. While we
navigate the
challenges and the opportunities
presented by oil and gas industry,
it is clear
that its contributions are
invaluable. We must continue
to support and
regulate this sector
wisely
ensuring that it remains a pillar of
our community's prosperity
and our partner in our growth.
Thank you for your
time.
>> Good morning, Mr, chair members
of the committee. My name is Boe
Bowen. I am the
chairman of the Eddie County Board of
Commissioners. I represent District
four and I'd like to thank you
all for the opportunity to speak before
you today and fill you in on some
of the projects we have ongoing
in Eddie County
and the industries that provide so much
opportunity for all of our residents
try to make
this
in Eddie County. We've been fortunate to have
many different industries to provide
income and resources to our
citizens in the state.
From agriculture to the potash
mines, to the waste isolation
pilot plant. And
for the last couple of decades, oil
and gas has been the backbone of our
economy. You
couple that with
the residents that we have here.
It's been a recipe for success
because Southeast New Mexico
has become synonymous with oil
and gas. I would like to
highlight just a few of the
ways that it's helped, helped Eddie
counties specifically.
Over the past five years,
we've been able to invest 100 and
$50 million into
roads and infrastructure back
into the county.
Over the next five years,
we have $400 million
of capital projects and
infrastructure that we have
planned. This will include
a new administration building and a
jail. These
are projects that are, we've been able
to fund
ourselves due
to
conservative fiscal
responsibility
and oil and gas
revenue.
Moving into the fire department.
Ems this
is something that we have never had before.
We have a fully staffed professional
fire department, have
professional equipment,
multiple locations
throughout the county. This has
helped to increase
our I overall iso
rating and allow
for a guaranteed response time
to rural Eddie County and the
surrounding
communities.
The sheriff's department and,
uh, Pecos Valley Drug Task
Force. Those are a couple other, uh,
pieces that we are very
strong and very passionate
about. The Pecos Valley
Drug task force is the leading
drug enforcement agency in New
Mexico. We've taken more fentaNYL
off of the streets than any other
agency. The
Eddie County Sheriff's Department is
a full service law enforcement division.
We have traffic patrol,
canine detectives and
SWAT units.
Couple that with the, one of the
highest levels of
officer retention. That's something
that we're very proud of. That's due to our
sheriff that's due to
the community and industry
support that our boys in blue
have here.
Um,
so it's safe to say that industry in New
Mexico is thriving and it's here
to stay for the foreseeable future.
One of the things that we constantly get
asked here though is what
if the rigs leave, what if oil dries
up, what are you gonna do?
Then
we're sitting in the Delaware Basin,
which has one of the largest oil
reserves in the
world. Oil's not
going anywhere.
And if the rigs leave,
it would
be,
it would be hard, it would
hurt and we'd hate to see them
go. However,
Southeast New Mexico has been
transitioning
from exploration and development
to operation and production
that allows for stabilization in the
industry for longevity for
tax dollars going forward.
What that means?
Its companies have been investing
in
um gas
processing plants and pipelines
throughout the state. So if the rigs were to
leave, we would still be able
to send oil and gas
down the line and allow it to be
sold, allowing
revenue going forward and perpetuity
for the state
with all that said, I'd like to highlight
a couple of our industry partners that
have been very key in
working with the county and
some of the things that they've done. The
first one I'd like to mention is Chevron.
Um everybody's heard of
Chevron, but
in 2023 they donated
$2.4 million
in social investment funding across
communities all over the state of New
Mexico.
Crazy, sorry,
yo.
Um
That funding went
for education, conservation,
mental health, food and housing.
Just a few areas of support and that
was all across the state.
In 2022
Chevron worked with
New Mexico State Land office in a
renewable resource energy
project. They have
created a 20 megawatt
facility, solar processing
facility that has 56,000
solar panels that
powers their entire Hayhurst
field. It just shows
Chevron's way
how they're looking forward to work
with clean green
renewable energy as well
as oil and
gas.
And then two others that I'd like to
highlight are Devon Energy and
Murn Oil Company and they've
really stepped up and put their money where their
mouth is.
Etty County has over 1200
miles of road, not
all of it is paved and
some of those roads are in dire
need of repair. One
such road
is a road that is
heavily traveled in the industry
and it's gotten so bad to where oil
haulers were no longer willing
to travel down the road to haul oil
out.
So Devon and Devon
Energy and Murn Oil
Company stepped up and they said, hey
guys, we understand that this is a
county road, but we would really like to
help you guys and help
ourselves in this process.
So they are paying for
the base Kichi to be
laid. The county will then follow
behind them in Chip and
Micro Silver Road. So it
just shows the way that they're able
to work
alongside us and with us
to progress things going
forward, this is going to make it safer
for all industry traffic as
well as allow oil companies to get
in and get the
ever so valuable oil
out.
So as you can see, we have a lot going
on in Eddie County and we're
thankful for the booming economy that we've
been blessed with. And we're proud to be
one of the largest supporters of the state's
budget. I would like to
thank all of you for coming down
our way and I hope over the next
couple of days you get to see
Eddie County, appreciate
the people, the community
and the industry that we're so
proud to have here. Thank you all
for your
time.
Thank you. We'll go to members question
member, Senator Woods.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman
on the handout
that, that you guys
gave us,
um,
on page five
and six.
Now this is about destination
sourcing
unknown.
But, uh who
wants to explain this to
me
>> if I would get a copy of the
document, I will attempt
to
Mr Thompson. Where, where is,
where is Matt? Thank
you. Page
five and six, >> five and
six.
Ok?
Because the way I see
this
at, at June of
21 on
page five,
you show collections
of,
let's see
for Eddie Counties, you show
collections of 3
million.
For Lee County. You show
collections
of uh, nearly
2 million. Correct?
And Hobbs
4 million.
And then on the next
page
on June
21
uh, you show collections
of
for Lee
County of
37 million,
that county of
30 million. >> That,
that's the, that's the,
that is the state, the
combined portion going
to the state. So
the page five is
the individual
counties. Portion,
page six would
be the combined
Groce receipts going to the
state from those
counties. So
>> page five, Mr Chair
is the way I understand it then
is what these
entities receive
out of the G RT.
>> That's correct. And
I think what's important to note
is as
the it, Mr
Chairman,
Senator
Woods,
one thing that's important to note
is that you can
see on page five,
the blue line, which is
Hobbs, it has
pretty well just been flatline
as we've seen increases
going to the counties
and the state
and Carlsbad would be
the same way. It's been pretty
well a flatline because when they
did the transition
from
origination based
tax to destination
based, all of the service
companies that are based in Hobbs and
Carlsbad no longer remit
to the state, their local
portion. So that's what's
happened, that same
activity occurring. And
actually, as when we did
some independent research, as we
looked at these numbers, we found
that we
polled several of our late
larger service companies
in Hobbs. And right now
based on the demand
from the oil and gas operators,
a lot of their service work
is being done in Eddie counties. So
now under destination sourcing
a Hobbs based business,
Lee's Hobbs goes into Eddie
County provides the service
work remits
the Eddie County portion to
the state and that's why
you see a little disparity
between Eddie and Lee.
And that's, it's because of
the service work is being
Destin. And so
we, we wanted to be able to show
that as well. But I think
we really
impactful is page six
which shows how much Groce
receipts is being generated from
service providers
in Leonie County that's
going to the state coffers.
And so we,
we just would really
like to be able to come up with a way
even if it's redistributed
throughout all the communities
in the state. So all
of this doesn't go to the state
and we can spread some of this
wealth across
all of your districts
because we all should be sharing
in uh
the
economic
growth that is occurring
here. We certainly are,
are more than willing to
be part of that type
of solution to see that
Santa Fe County, Burle
County, Mora
County, everybody really
we think would be, that's be a
much fair way to
distribute what's
coming coming out of these two
counties in terms of gross
receipts,
especially
>> what can I infer Mr
Chair? Can I infer
that on
on page six
that it
looks as though
we've kind of come
to a peak and we're kind
of leveling off
on these groce receipts,
just, just kind of
looking at the way it's
written here.
Uh,
is that the way
we can make that assumption
or? >> Well,
Mr Chairman
Senator,
it's really driven by
the investment decisions
that the major oil and gas
companies are making here.
You know, there's a lot of M and A going on
right now, merger and acquisition,
some of that has impacted some
capital plans. I think as some
of those things come to
fruition, then we're going to
see a rebirth
of capital investment because
after they go through that merger
and they make some decisions on
some of their business plans going forward.
But I think based on the conversations
we're having with the, with a lot of
the leadership in this room and I'm sure they'd
be able to share that with you.
They're continuing to
make major investments
in, in New
Mexico, in the Delaware
Basin for sure
many years to come. Thank
you very much. Thank you. Thank you,
Chairman
>> C Compos.
>> Thank you very much, Mr
Chairman. Thank you very much for
the presentation
that we've gone through already. I really
appreciate the uh the work
that's going on here and the
insightfulness that
you present.
One of the things in New Mexico
as we go forward. There's uh
two big issues. Of course,
it's water and then oil and
gas and in
tying this together and
working. If you will, as you've already
said, mayor, in terms of
our communities, how can
we better that relationship
and share the education
and uh let people
know exactly what's going on
here to the point where
we can build those relationships
and strengthen if you will not
only uh
the energy production
across the, across the
globe, if you will uh things
that we do in New Mexico
and then also to help the community.
So as I was coming in from Las
Vegas, I go through
Pintada and Pastur and then I go through
Vonn and then I keep coming on
down and go through Roswell
and Artesia. And I get
here and the point that I'm getting to
is how are
we going to be keeping rural New
Mexico alive
and strong tied
education as we move
forward and how we do all these
things just if you
can briefly
what your thoughts are on
how we can better New Mexico's
working together in, in
terms of these type of issues
because they, they do
create sometimes
some consternation or
if you will opposition
and we really need to be more
cohesive in terms of
how we're going to build our state
overall. Thank you, Mr
Chairman,
>> uh Mr Chairman. If
I may answer that first
Senator Campos, you
know, we, we're having those conversations and,
and I think the industry leaders
here and I know Miss
currier and no Moga
they're poised and ready to
start being part of that
collaboration to bring
that education.
For me personally, I think
that oil and
gas being such a huge
part of our economy and
our state, people
across the state need to understand
it better. You know how,
how it's produced, how
it's processed, how
becomes to be an integral
part of this microphone
could not be constructed
without oil and gas, the plastics
that are part of it
without oil and gas
production simply
would not be able to be done.
So there's, it's such an integral
part of our life. And I,
and you know, we're not
adverse to energy transition,
but we
believe that there should be
more of a symbiotic relationship
between the production
of oil and gas and that
transition to
some of our alternative
energy sources. And a lot
of the oil and gas companies that are
operating here are making
huge efforts and huge capital
investments on using
alternative energy as part
of their energy
matrix in order to, to produce
oil and gas to be
part of that
reduction on the fossil
fuel cycle.
So
I know that the leadership
that I'm associated
with in the industry
and the advocates, the
nomo, we would
love to sit down and work
with your leadership to try to
come up with a way to make people
in your part of the state
have a better understanding and
a better, I think the more they under
better, they understand it the
better they would appreciate that.
And so that's one
reason that I'm an
advocate for just what I talked
about, about taking some of these
revenues that's coming from
this area and
maybe redistributed
in such a fashion that people
would see the benefit
of having
the oil and gas industry in our
state.
>> Mmhm.
Ok.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
and Senator
Campos. Um,
we have to also look at,
uh what can we do with produce water?
How do we use
that in our favor
to, to reallocate
that into a a better
use? First of all, second
of all, um you talk
about education and
oil and gas plays obviously a very
vital role, but there's also
room for renewable energy,
the energy demands
um
or, or high enough that
there's room for both and I I
would hope we all agree that the
renewable energy technology
is not where we want it yet. It's
not as reliable as we would
like. And we realize
that's coming along,
but in that interim,
we, we have to continue with
the oil and gas to
provide those energies that we
need. And as we
move forward with the renewables,
there's room for both and I
think that's the in my, in
my mind frame anyways that
that that we have room for both and
we should look at at all
options, but we
cannot cancel out oil and
gas. That's just not possible.
We, we do not
have the ability
to provide the energy that we
use day to day
without oil and gas. It's just
not a reality. So we
have to continue to function with
both and, and look for
a brighter future on both ends of that.
Thank you. Thank
you,
>> Mr Chairman, Senator Campos.
If I may add to that,
um,
you know, as I kind of alluded to
talking about Chevron and their commitment
to green
renewable energy and their
solar farm that that 20
megawatt facility, the Hayhurst
field that they have south
of Carlsbad is one
of the larger fields in this
area. It's a a
field that has
huge production and that
solar farm is producing
enough energy to
send gas down the
pipeline that is
able to ultimately end up
making it to our house.
Um
In addition to that, there's a lot of
industry partners that are already
shying away from using
freshwater for fracks and
fracking with produced water.
Um In most cases,
most companies are looking
to solely use produced
water. Um freshwater
is
on an as needed basis.
So I think efforts are already being
made in that direction. That
being said, we
can definitely look forward
to meeting
with industry leaders as
well as people
from all across the state to
work together to get
that education out, to
show how important
this uh
this level of cohesion is
for us to keep moving forward
and keep the state
progressing in the direction that it >> is.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you all.
>> Thank you. I don't see any
questions from anybody else. I
appreciate your time and,
and, and your support for your community
and, and your care, right? I
mean, you know what made a community
grow if you want to look at the
horror stories of what happens when
the industry leaves. Look
at grants,
look at Gallup when we lost a
refinery and we lost a power
plant and grants
lost uranium. And
you can go to those small,
small towns in America
and they're getting smaller
and smaller and smaller
because there's no jobs and
you have a resource.
Um Everybody in the world
wants that resource.
I don't think we can stop the world
demand uh in New
Mexico and, and corporate
demand. Uh So
we have to figure out how we're gonna get
there and, and what we're gonna do.
But destination
sourcing. I know Representative
Scott soon
to be Senator Scott has worked
very hard on that. I don't know how we
fix that. I mean, that is
like waving a
magic wand and clicking your heels
together three times to try to fix
destination sourcing. It's,
it's going to be a long haul to fix
that. I know we had some short
term fixes that the executive
vetoed uh
a year or two ago for Carl's
bad. And Hobbs
and so I appreciate
your time and appreciate your efforts
and and your care representative
small. >> Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh
Just a, a really quick
question. Uh commission
chair, destination
sourcing has been sort
of the boon to the counties,
at least in this case,
it's very important
statewide. Of course, it allows
us to capture things
bought online,
which is
essential and will
only become more essential.
What's the
collaborative relationship
like between
the counties
and the cities? Knowing
sort of how important both
are and that the
maybe the financial
relationship
has uh clearly
switched significantly
with so many
new resources coming
to the counties. How have you all
approached
that,
>> Mr Chair Representative Small.
Um Thank you.
So
the counties is in a different
position, more unique position
here.
Um
We have been blessed with the
oil and gas revenue that, that, that's
where the primary, our, our
primary source of
revenue is coming
from
since that all happens in the county
and outside of the cities, that is
how we've been able to stay
so flush there. Um
Destination sourcing while there
was a slight
increase to the county's
total G
RT. If I'm not mistaken on
this
county manager,
we
it has
not
been a what, what was
taken from the, from the
cities has not just been
given to the counties, it's not like
we received an additional
um increase
from the destination sourcing
tax. So
what was taken
from the city of Carlsbad?
The city of Hobbs wasn't
encompassed by Eddie
County and Lee County?
Um
We do work with
the city of Carlsbad, the city of
Artesia, the village of loving
the
city of hope,
all of the other small communities
in the county. We
provide them with
um monies annually
for joint projects. We work closely
with the city of Carlsbad on joint
projects um to
help where we
can. So I
hope that answers your
question.
>> Yeah, please >> go
ahead,
Mr Chairman
small, correct
as the revenues have
increased. And under
hb six, there was a incremental
increase to the county
directly
which,
and we are fortunate
in Hobbs and Lee County that Lee
County has worked with us much
like what we have talked with the
legislature. They
have given us some
incremental increases for
specific projects
but is not, that has
not really given
us a pathway for
long term financial planning
because we lost,
we're losing about our
last latest estimates based
on what we're hearing from our
local businesses,
probably between
12 and $16
million a year of recurring
revenue. The counties is not
giving us $16
million a year in recurring
revenue. Lee County
has been very good to work with us
on, on some specific
projects, some Capex and some
things like that. We
had to reduce
our incentives for our housing
program due to our
budget cuts.
They came in and they have
put some money into that specific
project. But as far as
providing us recurring revenue
for us to be able to budget
long term for infrastructure,
fire and police protection,
road repairs, all those kinds
of things that's,
that's not occurring and that's,
that's the real
issue.
>> Thank you very much. Thank you
both. Thank you very much, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you guys for your presentation and
your time today. Appreciate
it,
Austin. You're gonna start us off
next
Mike, I
guess.
Where'd he go grabbing
the
presenter?
Which
kind
we'll charge for seats this
afternoon and
then
presenters will be in the
room, but I thought they were
gonna have a,
are you starting us, Austin and what's happening?
Tell us what's happening.
Ok.
Oh, so we're gonna go outside.
Ok. We got
plenty of time. Go ahead and fire
away.
>> There we go. You can
see how often I do this.
Um but
um some
of some of you in here know
uh me
and uh my
organization, our organization,
Infinity Water Solutions.
My name is Michael Dyson.
I'm CEO and co-founder
at Infinity Water. Uh
We are founded uh
technically in Austin,
Texas. However, we have done
100%
of our business uh
in uh the
land of enchantment
specifically um
infrastructure in
Leonetti County, New Mexico
Infrastructure that
emphasizes the
gathering, recycling
and reuse
directly into the oil and gas
industry of produced
water. We are a
direct result
of House Bill
546 more
commonly known today
as the Produced Water Act.
So for everybody that had an
opportunity uh to
put that in place, uh
Thank you from our
perspective, very
much uh
for matters
of run of show today. Again,
I want to say thank you very much for
your time. Um I
know it's the most valuable resource
we all have. I want
to say thank you again for the
audience members for coming
in and um
hearing uh
well about this critically
important issue, uh
what we'd like to do today
is cover a little bit of a
presentation. Uh Our
apologies, I'd love to
have it on the big screen, but I, I
understand that what we'll be able to
do is provide
this to you, uh, via
email, uh, after
this conversation.
Um, what we also
have out in the parking lot.
I'm sure a number of you have
noticed is one of our
treatment apparatuses.
Uh, what you're going to
be, Uh Well, what you will
have an opportunity to do, should
you, should you choose? It'll be
in the lot uh from now
until about two, between
two and 230 this afternoon.
Uh We would suggest
groups of 4 to 5.
We have our Chief science
Officer Zach, Doctor
Zachariah Hildenbrand, who will
be uh out there with
one of our technicians
uh OTIS who
will be happy
to kind of lead you around to
give you an introduction.
Um I'm also
joined by our
Chief Coms Officer
uh Ashley Kegley.
Uh with
that, uh I'd
love to just jump in
if that's
ok.
Um We were kicked off in
2019, as I mentioned before
as a direct result
of uh
House Bill
546. Uh
We were co-founders.
Uh Well, me and my
co-founded partners,
uh we're recovering oil
men. So I'm just going to go ahead and
throw that out there right
now. I'm sure we have
some folks that will
be a little bit
um unnerved by
that, but at the same time, I want
to emphasize
recovering
all of us and the
founding side has served in
the upstream operations.
Uh We believe it's a critical
industry, but it's also an
industry that can and
often does endeavor to do
better. Um
One of the opportunities that we
recognized uh early
on 2018 and going
into 2019
where the challenge is that the
oil and gas industry faces
with produced
water, uh
produced water
is well
certainly then and currently
is now is even
maybe more so uh
an increasing challenge for the
industry but not just for the
industry uh for
the state of New Mexico.
Um What we
thought was a
challenge. We
figured we could
introduce the concept of
an opportunity
and that's where House Bill
546 really
came in. As
we were getting this concept
set up, we were
looking in the
Permian Basin generally,
as I mentioned before, we're a bunch
of recovering oil guys
from Texas. And
so what prompted us to move
into a New Mexico
conversation was
really the forward
thinking of
this body and any number
of other members
and, and New Mexicans generally
uh with, with that bit
of legislation. Uh
what that legislation
did was really give a
level of stability
and security
to any
organization that wanted to,
to conceptualize
a, a
waste source,
produced water into a
resource
conversation.
Doesn't mean that
it was all figured out
not by a long shot.
But what it did was
give
entrepreneurs
like
infinity an
opportunity to
have a,
have a discussion,
um an honest
discussion uh in
a market that really
kind of signaled this
for this level of forward
thinking. So that's anyway,
that's how we got started.
Um What we
endeavor to do is
to bring in a barrel
of water, treat
that barrel of water
and reuse that barrel
of water. We do this
exclusively
at the moment exclusively
for direct reuse, which is
a nice way of saying directly
back to the oil and gas
industries. So let's talk
about a little bit for anyone that's
not familiar with
um the oil and
gas industry and the the water
challenge or opportunity depending
on how you really want.
Half glass, half full, half
empty conversation.
The oil
and gas industry
weighs fairly
heavily on
freshwater at least traditionally,
with their completions
commonly known as hydraulic
fracturing or
fracking
that is traditionally certain
through this arid portion
of the world, uh been a little bit
of a downward pressure on
a
scarce resource.
We're all very familiar with
this. And so what the
industry has has started
to do over a quarter, any number
of years is
take this produced water
and reuse it in
place of freshwater,
alleviating the
pressures on freshwater.
And ultimately what, what
infinity believes is
allowing those freshwater resources
to stay in place for their
highest and best use
people,
agriculture, livestock,
and wildlife.
The industry is making tremendous
strides in this
endeavor and infinity
is part of that
ecosystem.
We we
currently at least have been
uh the
unique in the space.
We are unique in the space
in that we are
and always
endeavor to be pure players
ie no disposal.
This is where the second portion of
the of the challenge really comes
in and that is
tremendous amounts of produced
water for anyone not
familiar with, produced
water,
anybody not familiar with produced
water produced water is
naturally occurring
water in oil and
gas formations.
This water
is
quite plentiful
in oil and gas formation,
specifically in the Permian
basin and very
specifically in the northern
Delaware Basin, which is the
permian portion
uh in New Mexico,
Leonetti County,
uh we are
producing the state of
New Mexico just in
Leonetti County. Roughly 6
million barrels are
produced water. And I want to
emphasize again that
this, this water
is naturally
occurring in
formation, which is to
say most of this water was in
place
9600
plus million years ago.
All right. So until
it comes to the surface, the likelihood
of it ever having seen the light of
day in times
of uh
of, of, of humanity
is, is slimmed to none.
Um With that
in mind, uh there
is a complex
emulsion uh that
comes up with this,
with this water, right?
And this water, uh
traditionally, we
say between five and seven
barrels of water
per barrel of oil
So it is quite the challenge.
Historically, the
second side of this
conversation again, is
the disposing the managing and
disposing of this
produced water.
Traditionally, the
industry has disposed of this
down what are called either
injection wells, sometimes referred
to as saltwater disposal
wells, the saltwater
disposal wells uh
at one point became so
plentiful and the water
that we were injecting became so
plentiful that it
meaningfully increased
the risk of
seismicity. This
is the conversation that we
commonly hear around
earthquakes.
I'm not going to weigh in
on tracking and completions.
Although I will say
uh that I tend to agree
with the majority of the industry
that the completion process
itself has very
limited direct correlation
to seismicity.
However,
the injection of
significant amounts of
produced water, that error, a
result, direct
result of the production
from the those
completions in that
fracking
that does have pretty
close correlation
historically to seismicity
risk. And so
what infinity really wanted to
do was sit
down and figure out how to
check everyone's
box or at least get as close
as we could to that.
So again, we're going to take
a barrel of this produced
water. We're going to
treat that barrel of produced
water and instead of
sending it
traditionally
down this very deep
injection well or
what's actually become a little
bit more common uh
place in New Mexico,
ship it down a pipeline
across into Texas where it
goes down uh in
injection Well,
we wanted to really
emphasize the
recycling reuse this
concept
of a
loop, perhaps
even a closed loop if
we're in
successful in,
in 100%
of, of.
Um, well,
our efficiency, I
suppose, um
ultimately, when we looked at this,
what we believed
was that
infinity could effectively
create uh
the equivalent for the
industry of a blue
trashcan. What do I
mean by that?
Um, in Texas,
certainly, uh I have
not been a resident admittedly
of the great state of,
of New Mexico.
However, in Texas, our
trash
receptacles come in two
colors, one
is brown and one is
blue and
in the blue, we
know that we put our,
our aluminum cans,
we put our glass, we put our
paper, uh we put our
plastics
and the endeavor
there is to recycle
that and reuse it
rather than put it into our brown
trash can that
ends up in our,
our landfills.
Now, I think
the analogy
is ideal for what we're
discussing here because
one thing to understand about the
oil and gas industry
is that there is so much
produced water,
not all of it will ultimately
fit into a blue trash
can, at least not
immediately. And so
there has to continue
conversations about
our brown
trash cans if you
will for some
period of time.
But that's really where this
body and the state
of New Mexico really has a
tremendous opportunity.
They have this tremendous
opportunity to
over time
introduce legislation
whether through carrots
or sticks or some combination
of all the above
that help encourage
this industry to move
more towards
the blue than the
brown.
That's what infinity's
endeavor to
do.
Um, as
I mentioned before,
uh, our
system,
it is intended to be
a, as
close to a closed loop
system as we
can get. So again,
a barrel in that
barrel is treated
and it's sent back out for,
for direct reuse
on a as close to a 1 to 1
as we could possibly get it.
Right. Um
We are in the
process
now
of, of constructing
a significant infrastructure
footprint across Leonetti
County. Uh
We have
uh undertaken
uh significant contracts
with uh
most of
the major
oil and gas companies and, and
some even local uh
operators native to New
Mexico.
Uh The
idea again, being
guys, let's
take, let's take
your refuse. Let's
have a good strong
conversation
about sending it back
oil and gas indus. Uh uh
Industry partners of ours
have been exceedingly receptive
to this conversation, which
makes all the sense in the world really
because they're already
doing it to some degree
themselves.
Um Just
to give you an idea, uh
what we intend
to construct
is roughly
80 miles worth of
interconnected pipe.
Our, our endeavor
there is honestly to
minimize the amount
of pipe that we put in the
ground. The idea
is to put seven
recycling treatment
facilities, gathering treatment
facilities throughout Lean
Eddie County, New Mexico,
those, those facilities will
be interconnected. The
interconnection of those facilities
allows for
greater um
opportunity for
those uh
our customers effectively,
it allows us to reach
um honestly,
just a network effect is, is
really the right terminology to use
there. Uh We will
have uh starting
in January
of 25 we will
be able to recycle
500,000 barrels
of, of produced water
every single day.
We will be able to,
to store and warehouse
20 million barrels
of, of treated
produced water at any
given time, we
will have the ability to flow as
much as
250,000
barrels per day
between no less than
seven connection points
with major and mega major
operators.
This
from our standpoint is
roughly 100 and $53
million Capex
program and
that is what we've committed to
the great state of New
Mexico. Now,
how does that impact
the economics in New
Mexico
using
government? Uh or I guess
the uh some of the US
employment uh
um numbers,
what we're able to demonstrate
is that we will create
2250
jobs
with some head office
uh in addition to some head office
and, and additional jobs on the Texas
side. But what we're here really
emphasize is the
2250
jobs that are
created both
directly and as
ancillary to
our implementation of this Capex
program,
the jobs filled by New
Mexicans are estimated to be
roughly 70%.
It's a lot of homegrown
talent,
existing jobs retained
after our construction is
estimated to be roughly
300
that's through one project.
And I want to emphasize,
we are one
of a
multitude of organizations
that are working in New
Mexico in
the midstream, what
we would refer to as the midstream water
space.
This is a direct
result of
legislation that
members of this
committee helped
pass again
like this just in
case anybody wonders
whether or not you make a
difference in your
decisions. The answer
is absolutely
when you demonstrate
and give organizations like
ours an opportunity
to come into your community
and to innovate,
we'll do it. And
again, I want
to mention we're not
alone. Uh
There's a co-operative
landscape, some might
consider it a
uh
competitive landscape.
Um I, I try to
shy away from that and I
think my colleagues do uh
largely as well
simply because
infinity does
not help create a
blue economy or
an ecosystem around produced
water alone.
Not by a long shot.
There are stakeholders up and down the
board but groups
such as AIS NGL,
Goodnight select
Owl Water Bridge. Xr
I, these are all
groups that are participating to some
degree and in some manner
in the same
ecosystem.
I would argue that they're all
doing a
fairly phenomenal job
considering that this is also
an industry that is quickly and readily
transitioning.
One of the things that I really want
to emphasize, we've talked a
lot today about
the H2O molecule
itself
that is the tip of the
iceberg
and I'm not suggesting that
what's gonna, what I'm saying
next is readily
available
tomorrow. But
what I am suggesting is that
decisions that are made
today and
over the course of the next several
months will
absolutely
give us the opportunity,
New Mexico, the opportunity
to usher these things
in what I will tell you is
the technology does
exist for these
opportunities.
It is really just looking
for a catalyst to bring it
all together.
That's a great
opportunity for government
to step in.
And one of the things that I
probably should have started with,
I know that this, this
body and the body in
Santa Fe,
you guys are all volunteers.
That's tremendous. The
only volunteer
legislature in
the U SI believe,
right? Um
I, I had a quick
run in a much
lesser capacity
as a volunteer elected
official. There's
nothing easy about what you guys
are doing. There's
nothing easy about sorting through
this, especially not while you also
have to maintain
full-time employment.
So one of the things that I
can and my team
will absolutely promise
you is that as you have
questions, looking
into these matters, we're going
to be as transparent and
open and, and available
to you as we possibly can
be. And with
that, let's have a
conversation quickly about
economic diversification.
Let's talk about what
H2O molecules can really
do for the state of
New Mexico.
Let's have a quick conversation
about how much water
is really being produced
here and if we
can clean it and get it to
a spec that is usable
in say
advanced
manufacturing.
What does that do for
the economic opportunities
for New Mexico? The
next time a
Tesla talks
about a facility, the
next time an Intel
has a conversation, the
next time any of these
opportunities arise
and one of their
needs is
water.
This is where the state of New
Mexico
can
if it chooses use
its water assets
that are quite,
quite abundant coming
from the oil and gas industry
to leverage that conversation.
And that's where private enterprises
such as infinity
can potentially
offer an opportunity
for the state of New Mexico
to leverage those
assets.
The same
elements that
one might refer
to as creating
a level of
uh unsafe
for these produced
water. Any
number of these elements
when extracted from that
emulsion
have critically
valuable uses.
When we start talking about
the salts, when we start
talking about the rare earth
metals, the precious metals,
these critical
minerals,
these things have
value, the residual
hydrocarbon that we're able to
harvest and honestly
refine in situ
has value.
There are technologies that exist
right now that at
scale would allow us
to harvest these
elements. You
then have to have a level
of support
to create an a
value
chain for
these critical and
rare earth metals,
these valuable elements
and constituents once
extracted to make it to
market that again
is an opportunity for the
state to
come in and
help foster
support a
marketplace.
Now, what does that mean for
New Mexico? We've
talked about the H2O molecules
that's pretty obvious.
Roughly 50%
may be more by any number of
calculations of
your uh
annual revenues come
directly from the oil and gas
industry. That's a
lot, which means
that your
upside, our
upside our
opportunities ebb
and flow potentially
with the oil and gas industry
and as the oil and gas industry, ebb
and flows,
I would suggest and I'd
be very happy to map this out
for anybody that wanted to have a quick
conversation about it
that within 2 to 3
generations, New Mexico
using H2O
molecules could
reasonably overhaul
their entire economy.
Adding a level of
diversification that is
not necessarily on the back
of the water,
but is supported by what
the water can bring to
you. And again,
that's opportunities such
as bringing in
new heavy
industry, manufacturing,
advanced
manufacturing. These
types of conversations
provide high
paying jobs. These
are the kinds of opportunities
where
and Intel say
uh bless
you would bring
uh probably outside
any number of outside talent
to start. They
would have relatively high
paying jobs.
That means disposable
income, disposable
income and quality of
life. They would love to
spend it on food, beverage,
retail entertainment.
Now you're supporting ancillary
business
at some point, the long
arc of an intel
in this great state of New Mexico
suggests that
it is more cost effective
for intel to
home, grow its talent,
which now has a
conversation around
infusions into
um
collegiate programs,
right? High school
programs, your education
at any number of
levels.
If New Mexico wants
to commit to that,
I can assure you that New Mexico
is uniquely
positioned to take advantage
of this. And what do I
mean by uniquely
positioned? The land
of enchantment is graced with a lot
of natural resources, not
the least of which is its natural
beauty. But what
it also has is not just
tremendous amounts of mineral
wealth in the forms
especially of oil and gas,
but of these water
storages,
this water
extraction
is
currently considered a by-product
largely of the oil and gas
industry by
taking that
by-product
and putting it effectively
into your
economy.
It's
honestly, the opportunity
set is,
is tremendous. And I do
also want to say that
with,
with
this,
it's not news to anyone
that we probably need
additional research. We
need thoughtful
uh implementation of
these things,
but this is a conversation that
we shouldn't shy away from.
And what we certainly shouldn't
do is
allow uh
fear of the
unknown to
introduce
restrictive
legislation or even
to scare us away from the things
that
well could quite
honestly change the
quality of life for the better
uh for New
Mexicans.
I do want to emphasize
and I'm not necessarily supposed to
bring this up, uh,
uh, in, in these and,
but, um,
like I, every single
person in our
organization
is a parent
and lives in the same fishbowl
that you all do where
you're raising your families.
The, the last thing
we or anybody
honestly, in their right
mind in this industry or any
other wants to do
is harm that
it turns out these resources
much like we
endeavor to do in
infinity. With this
closed loop, we are
closed here,
the the impetus
to make sure
that we are making the right decisions
and doing, introducing these
concepts and innovation
uh responsibly
is absolutely critical.
But that's also where
again, uh members
of this body and and those
in Santa Fe can
step in and have meaningful
impacts on setting these
guardrails for
innovation,
setting the the
uh the template for
this. What I would
argue if in doing
this, uh
you can introduce a
concept of fit for purpose,
water,
not every bit of
water needs to be
available for every single
industry. As a matter of fact, I
think it's pretty
obvious that not
any,
not every single bit
of water is suitable
for every use.
I think a wonderful conversation that
we could all have honestly
is why the heck are we filling our
toilets with the same thing that comes
out of our tap for drinking,
right? We can all do
these things
better if, if we
choose. And one of the things
again that I want to emphasize
is that the science and the research
exists for us to do these
things. The question
is whether or not we
want to
um we are
wholeheartedly in the
camp of
Yes, yes, we
do.
Um
I do want to emphasize
a handful of things as
well with regards
specifically
New Mexico was
on the cutting edge
with its produced Water Act
conversation back in
2019,
I would argue and I know this
is maybe
um not
ideal conversation for
some, but I would
say that this concept around
a strategic water supply
is
nothing short of brilliant. To
be honest with you, if
we can achieve it,
the fact that no one
else quite literally
on the planet is
moving this forward
is
a little bit silly.
But why wouldn't
we want to take
wastewater and encourage
all the elements
that all the stakeholders
to start reviewing
that wastewater as more of that
blue trash can? Whether the
brown, here's
what I will also know
the concept of using
treated, produced water
for everything
from. Well,
certainly through the beneficial reuse
category is
not new,
beneficial reuse has
been
deployed even
in agricultural use in
California for the
better part of three decades.
As a matter of fact,
the likelihood if you
enjoy
pistachios
or almonds
from California,
the likelihood that you have eaten
these products consume
these products, there is a
high likelihood
that you have consumed
products that have
been grown with treated,
produced water.
Now again, try
to produce water
is not all created
equal, right?
It is honestly
easier to treat
the water in
California, in San
Joaquin Basin than
it is certainly here in the
Northern Delaware Basin.
But what I would
note to that
is that
it's not just
California,
we have discharged
permits that are allowed
currently in
Texas
in Wyoming,
in New York,
Pennsylvania and West
Virginia.
The question really
is, how does New Mexico
feel about this?
And more importantly,
can we take some of the
standards that have been
adopted
in these other jurisdictions and
use those as guides
here in New
Mexico?
I think the answer generally is
yes and I certainly
hope so. I think for
New Mexi, the fortunes,
the future fortunes of New
Mexicans, I hope
for their sake and all of our
sakes with regards to water
sustainability, endeavors
that again, the answer is
yes.
One,
one thing I would
note
the biggest, the
biggest aspect
for
this body and the
folks in New Mexico and
honestly, New
Mexicans
generally,
it's market as surety,
these, these
conversations that certain
steps that
you guys as elected
officials can
take to set the
ground rules to provide
the guidelines
that provides a
level of assurity to the
market.
If you set the rules
for the game,
people will play,
you just have to provide a level of
market assurity.
You did that once with the
Produced Water Act,
what I'm encouraging all
of us to do today
is to collaborate
on additional
innovation so that
we can continue that trend.
I understand that I have taken up
a lot of your time. I thank
you all very, very much for
listening and I'm
absolutely. So is
my team available
uh for any additional
questions or, or thoughts
or concerns?
Oh, of course. Thank you very
much. And just a
reminder, we
are very happy to host
you through our mobile
facility. It's, it's
in the uh it's in the
parking lot. You quite
literally cannot miss this.
Uh Doctor
Hildenbrand can answer any number
of your technical uh
conversations.
Um As we walk through,
he's very happy. I'm sure
to give you an idea of kind
of how the apparatus works,
this apparatus just for
clarity's sake.
Um We can
uh use these as mobile
units to help uh
treat uh
in kind
of our uh colleagues
infrastructure. Uh We
can also uh
build these into
permanent facilities uh
which is what we're intending to
do uh for the
Capex program uh
that I mentioned
previously with that
again. Thank you all very much
for your time.
>> Yeah, I think we're gonna
go tour that
your truck
or trailer
and then I only have one person on the
list for questions. I
have a four members.
Ok. Well, I
only had one. So let's
go look at the truck because I think that's going
to drive a lot of questions
also then we can come back
in and so let's
be back in here
by
1010,
10,
>> we're at your disposal,
>> ok? And we're
gonna go out
1010,
you know
>> how are you >> sir?
>> It's really good to see you as well.
