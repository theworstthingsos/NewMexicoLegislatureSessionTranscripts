Johnny Montoya. Could you take a seat,
please? Johnny
Montoya. Could you take a seat,
please?
Johnny Montoya. Could you
take a seat, please?
Louder,
Johnny Money, please
take a
seat.
That's
funny.
You're starting all sunny is Gwynn
coming up with you?
>> Uh Yes, Mr.
Chair. I think she'll be
here in just a minute. She's
in the hallway, but
uh I can go ahead
and get started and then she can
jump in as we
go through the presentation.
We're on Tab G
in your binders. There'll be a
presentation with
slides. We'll be working
mostly off of this for the
morning.
Uh I heard you had a
very explosive uh
start to your day
and hoping
that uh that's
made you awake up for, for
the remainder of this morning. We're
gonna start off with an update
on the Martinez Yazzie
lawsuit where we
were when the court
order came out and where
we are today
and following
that, you're going to hear
from the Secretary of Education
Doctors Romero
about next steps and where
we need to go from
there.
So, starting on the second
slide of your
presentation.
This, this is
the
crux of the court case,
it's really one line in the
Constitution that
says
all students are guaranteed
a uniform and sufficient
education.
And
the court
actually
provided some very
nuanced language on
what we should do to provide
that uniform and
sufficient education.
First of all, she
had a definition of your
students need to be colledge and
career ready
and then that
students particularly
at risk, students need the
opportunity
to obtain that
education.
She also gave deference
to you the legislature
and the Executive
branch
to make that
system, to design
it, to provide
for it and
to essentially
execute on the vision
that the Constitution had for
education,
really giving very
limited
details on what specific
remedies should be. So
really it was given back
to you
to decide what is
sufficient and uniform education
should look like
if you turn with me to page
three, that
was about a decade
ago when the plaintiffs
filed suit
and five years ago,
the court made the order
and it was a very interesting order
because it really made a connection
between inputs,
you know, what was going into the
system and
outputs, which is your
student outcomes and performance,
reading proficiency rates,
graduation, etcetera.
And it made a conclusion that because
the inputs were not
adequate,
the outputs were dismal
and therefore
you needed to increase funding
for the system and you need to
increase oversight from
the department to make sure
that the system
is providing its
constitutional
mandate.
There is also a
order in 2020
during the pandemic when the
courts
essentially
asked the State to
expedite its
provision of it
resources to students when
schools were closed.
But since then, we have not
seen any action
publicly from the court
aside from discovery
and more information
gathering.
So on page
four,
you know, staff kind of
scoured this 600
page findings
of fact and conclusion that the
court
filed in
2018. And
these are sort of the major categories
from that 600 page
document that
these are the inputs that
were inadequate,
including
programs such as K
three plus at the
time,
pre-kindergarten
out of school learning,
research based reading
programs,
funding for English
learners, implementation
of the India Ed Act
instruction,
instructional materials.
It was a very extensive
list that
went into detail and testimony
on things that were deficient and a
lot has changed
since
if you turn to page
five,
the plaintiffs and the
court agreed that some injunctive
relief was needed and that it
needed to be immediate.
And one of the big
provisions was
that a statewide
plan was necessary
to demonstrate that the
State was taking actions
that there would be progress
monitoring and that
there would be accountability for
results,
particularly for four key
groups. The court
noted that the at risk students
that were most affected by
this system or
English language learners,
native American
students,
economically disadvantaged
students and students
with
disabilities
if you turn with me to page
six in
2018,
several remedies were proposed
by both the plaintiff
groups.
The department
and the legislature work
together to
provide
ideas on
what to do to respond to the court
case. I think that
this chart really
shows a clear
delineation of responsibilities
which is a helpful exercise
because as
a legislature, your primary
role is to
fund the system
and provide those
statutory boundaries
where necessary.
But ultimately, it is up to the
department to ensure
that schools
are spending the
funds
effectively
and that they are monitoring the
results and providing technical
assistance where necessary.
And of course, schools are
the deliverers of
the remedies in
that they are teaching our students
each and every
day
turning on to page seven,
we've put together a
list
of the court findings
broadly. The, it's not
an exhaustive list, but some
of these are the most
substantive
findings. And
then we sort of outline what the
legislature has done
in large part,
how the Executive has
responded
and what are some local outcomes
that we have been able to
observe before
the court case
and what's happened today?
So, a key finding
on the first one is that funding
was insufficient.
You've increased
overall public school funding
by 58% since
the ruling,
that's about
$1.6
billion.
It's including about a
half percent increase
from the land grant permanent fund
distribution for schools
and what we've seen
is some
of this funding has landed
itself in cash balances.
We've seen reversions
from some key
initiatives that the legislature
has made for extended learning
time.
On the second line, there was
another
finding from the court that at
risk students weren't receiving
more funding than their
peers.
You've tripled the at risk
index while
it's not quite to that 25%
mark. You've also run a new
initiative outside of the
formula called the family income
index which
directly supplies funding to
schools to do at risk
services.
The department has stood
up a at risk
funding monitoring
account code
and they're seeing that schools
are coding
that some of these expenditures
are for at risk services,
but we're still seeing achievement
gaps in reading
and math, which was one of the key
outputs that the courts
said needed to be
closed in order
to reach a sufficient
education
system.
I'm gonna go ahead and skip over
to page
eight. I know
Representative Garcia had asked
me to keep this relatively
brief, so I'm going to speed it up a
bit. Uh You
can see one of the largest
initiatives that the
legislature and the
Executive have undertaken
is on page
eight,
providing additional
instruction and learning time for
students. You've
raised the average
uh of number of
days as a result of
those actions from
176
to about 100 and 83
days.
You've also added
$312
million in recurring funding for
this initiative, which is second
only to
teachers salaries and benefits,
which were the which was the
largest category of
funding that you increased.
With that $1.6
billion. You've also
established an early childhood
education care and care
department uh
providing
more access to pre K
than before the court
case. Moving
on to page nine.
Another one I want to focus on here
is at risk students lacking
res access to research
based reading
programs.
You've really
increased funding for early
literacy about
tenfold since the court hearing
to implement the
science of reading,
provide the training and even
provide a summer literacy
institute this
year for
that
on page
10,
one big thing that we've focused
on in this interim is
having students
providing access to
students high,
excuse me, providing high
quality teachers for at risk
students. Uh
You've really increased
teacher pay since the
court ruling, you're
back in fiscal year
19, you were ranked 49th
in the nation on average pay. You're
now at number 22
today. Raising
that from 47,000
a teacher to $63,000
a teacher, your
vacancy rate still remains
quite stubborn
at 751
teachers. But
you've really infused the
pipeline to
expand educator,
clinical practice
opportunities by providing
teacher residencies
and paid student teaching opportunities
as well as grow your own
programs across the
State.
I'm gonna go ahead and skip over
to
page 13. I'll
give you some time to, to read
through some of these other
findings and happy to answer
questions about those
later. Uh
But really
the key point that the
court wanted the
State to focus on
was student
outcomes. That was our true
north. You know, you
could spend an inordinate
amount of money on the system. But
if you did not get to those student
outcomes, closing those
achievement gaps, raising
overall proficiency
in the courts
ruling,
that was what was
key to determining whether your
system was sufficient.
And as you can see, even
though we had change
test between
when the court heard
the case and what
we have today,
those achievement gaps
are still there between
the at risk categories
that the court noted. And
so even though we have a different
metric
today, we're
still seeing similar trends
than what we saw
when the court issued its
order. And with that, I'll
turn it over to my colleague
here, director
ornament to continue the rest
of this
presentation.
>> Good morning, Mr., Chair,
Mr., vice Chair
Members of the Legislative
Finance Committee. My
name is Gwen Pereo
ornament and I am
the director for your
legislative education study
Committee and I want to
first thank you for having me
here. Um Thank you as a
Committee as well as the
director
um and Sunny
Mr. Liu. So
I'm going to continue with an
additional look at outcomes
for you. So we're on slide
14 right now
on slide 14, you have
graduation rates over the
past 10 years.
And at first glance, it does
appear that we're making strides
as a State notice
on the graph to your left,
the upward trend
beginning in 2013
and ending with a preliminary
2023
data.
The graph tracks graduation
rates for each of the named
groups identified in the
lawsuit. And I'd like to
point out the positive strong
slope upward for
native American students in
particular.
So
while noteworthy,
there is
nuance in this
data that does warrant closer
study. I think both
staff from the Finance
Committee, as well as the Education
Study Committee are
interested in measures
of colledge remediation
in particular, as
well as how changes in statute
and administrative code
or rule have
an effect or relationship
on this trend that you're
seeing
part of the balance
here is the
ability to recognize
unnecessary barriers
while also upholding
rigor for students
so that they are successful.
And the diploma is essentially
meaningful,
particularly with
any policy change. So this
was very much in the minds,
I think of the legislature over the past
two years with the new graduation
requirements bill.
Now the graph to the right
specifically notes how
data can and
should be leveraged to
take and the takeaway here for
you all is that schools
districts, even the
public education department
can be identifying
and targeting students who
are in danger of not graduating.
I think the finance Committee has been
focused on this for a while
actually. And there are about
65 schools in the
State with less than
10 students to graduate
that would mov'e the entire State
forward essentially to match our
national average.
Again, we'd want
to watch the balance here
comes into play because
in providing supports for these
particular students that are
identified,
we also don't want them. We
also want the diploma to
continue to be meaningful.
We don't want to resort to questionable
credit recovery practices that
we often see or sometimes
see across the
State.
So moving on to slide
15,
this graph shows the increase
in the State equalization
guarantee over the past
18 fiscal
years. Beginning in
fiscal year
2008
as part of a study and then
a consequential
proposal,
the American Institutes of
Research or a IR
projected a formula increase
over time which
are labeled in red in the
graph. Now as
the slide states,
the court did not
endorse this
methodology,
but it has been a useful
measure for progress for
both the Finance Committee, the education
study Committee, as well as the
legislature as a
whole. I'd
like to point out two things about this
graph for you all.
The first,
you'll notice that the increase
in the seg in 2023
allowed the State to
actually mov'e firmly
past the projected
sufficiency costs that was
recommended by a
air
and that's a great
thing.
However, again, with some
nuance that I'd like to just
bring forward for you all,
you'll notice the gap between the two
lines from fiscal year
08 to fiscal year
22
and just as compounding
interest can
and does
have um
happen by
increasing return. So too
can the same phenomena
occur in the negative
with compounding deficits?
So I say this just
noting that
gap, but
I also want to say that with
caution because we do see
fairly healthy school budgets
right now.
However, both budget,
how budget is
used
and what is needed to adjust for
prior deficits that May
have impacted the system
are both considerations for
policymakers.
So moving on for the next
three slides I'm gonna
quick, quickly as quick
as possible, provide a an
historical over
overview of enacted
Legislation as well
as recurring appropriations
following the timeline
of the
lawsuit.
So starting with slide
16, as we
start for from fiscal year
14, this
was the calendar years of the
individual lawsuits
when they were initially
filed.
So on this
slide, while the seg rises
and then declines due to the precipitous
State revenue in 2015
and 16, that you are all very
well aware of. There were
actions that were taken by
the legis legislature that
signal some responsiveness.
I'll point out the at
risk index first
increased at this point
and micro district units
were added in
fiscal year 15
and minimum salaries.
As you've heard from Mr. Lieu
continue to increase
for
educators
moving to slide
17.
You see increases to the
appropriation in fiscal
year 18 and 19. But
here we see very strong
initial steps taken by you
all and what signals a strong
legislative response is fiscal
year 20 Session
2019. Immediately
following the court order,
there is a swift and
broad response on the part
of the legislature. So I'll
point out just four
specific actions
for you all to
note.
Um The first
is there was an increase to the
seg that it
rose to the tune of $400
million.
Second, minimum
salaries rise again
in addition to a 6%
salary increase for all school
personnel.
Third, the at risk
index as Mr. Liu
has noted rose to a factor of
0.3
and last but not least you'll
see a smattering a variety
of other actions ranging
from the establishment of E CE
CD teacher
residencies, the school
attendance for Success Act
community schools,
uh Tribal needs assessment
K five plus units all
in an effort to support the
system.
On slide 18,
you see steady focus
again, an increase
in funding and more notable
responses on behalf of the
legislature
in fiscal year 22
we see the removal of impact
aid and the local mill levy
credits. There's
a substantial increase to
the minimum salary
for educators and then a
7% increase for
all school personnel in uh
23
including importantly,
a 3% increase to er
b employer contributions. Because
I believe at that time, the legislature
was concerned about
targeting educator take
home pay.
We see an increase to all school
instructional hours and
a new K 12 plus factor
incentivizing additional days
following waning participation
in K five plus for fiscal year
24.
And you'll note that the at risk
factor now stands at
0.33 there's
a fine fine arts factor that
stands at 0.055
all as a result
of action for fiscal year
24. What's
not noted here, but what I'd like
to bring to your attention
is there is also an
increase to the Indian Education
Fund up to $20
million.
Finally,
for the current fiscal year,
the legislature has
cumulatively increased
its appropriation to the
seg
since fiscal year
2019 by
approximately
62%
or $1.6
billion
you appropriated 79
million for the science of reading,
established new graduation
requirements and established
a growth
fund.
So in conclusion, we're
going to return here
to one of our initial
slides um slide
19.
And we hope to reflect back on
action, taken
some very
strong positive movement on
behalf of the legislature
and offer you an opportunity to
reflect in order to address
the needs that could be identified
moving forward,
we can go through each of the
six inadequate inputs that were
listed by Mr. Lieu and
consider um the
information that both he and I have
provided. But I
think I'd like to end by just offering
you three
critical
considerations.
The first
is
how might you allow for
specific yet
differentiated
policy in the future
moving forward? And I'll
provide an
example.
One D lists smaller
class sizes and that was noted
and targeted by um
noted as an inadequate
input by
uh the
uh court.
You saw a very
strong policy
brief that was written by Mr.
Lieu and one of our
analysts at the LES
C in June
on teacher supports
noting that should
we in in um institute
broad swath policy
to reduce class size?
There are inadvertent
um
consequences as a
result of that, we already
have a teacher vacancy,
um teacher
shortages that are pretty
significant and the
impact in terms of capital outlay
or space. So looking
at other options
are really healthy
and important here in order to
address sort of the fundamental
underlying issue that this
is noting
the second consideration that I
have for you moving forward is
in addressing the
lawsuit.
We don't want this to be just a,
a checklist
given that this work needs to
continue to study
outcomes and investments
on your part.
And this way, I also want to
note that this list that's
here is not
comprehensive.
The most glaring thing that
I will note is math is not
here and our mouth
outcomes as a State are
dismal
last but not least
I will leave you with
um this idea
around implementation and how
long it takes
to see results.
I do feel like we are
seeing outputs to begin
with. That's the first step
in actually seeing some of the return
on your investments. Outputs
are simply number of
teachers and prep programs
increased. Number of teachers
who have trained in the science of reading,
substantially increased
number of community schools in the
State, the number of out of school
time programs, the
increase in career technical
education programs, the number
of students who now have the opportunity
to engage in internships and work
based learning. The
cumulative rise
in the instructional hours and
days has actually increased
as a State.
So we should expect
to see the next step,
which are actual outcomes
in the next 1 to 3
years and we should be
focused to
ensure that that happens
um on your behalf.
So with
that, I believe
we stand for questions, Mr.
Chair,
>> all of this with a declining
population,
right?
And what's the student declining
population number? Do we know
that?
>> Um Mr. Chair?
I believe we stand at around a
300 stu
1000 students
currently
and at at the time of the court
filing, we were about
330,000. So
it's been steadily
dropping. Your biggest
dip was during the pandemic of about
4% in one
year.
>> Kate,
questions from Committee
Members, Representative Chatfield
and the
>> list.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
at the cabinet meeting in
Clovis. The Governor
said that she had closed
down and taken over
many small
rural school districts for
because they were not getting,
doing a good job of teaching the
kids. I
wondered, I know
of two and
that were not closed down
for not teaching the kids they
were, they were closed
down for not following the governor's
policy.
Can you tell
enlighten me on what the other
ones
were?
>> Uh, Mr. Chair Representative
Chatfield, I'm unaware of
the closure of any school
district um
completely, uh
and particularly about
around instruction
or academics. I think
>> she didn't close them down. I
misspoke she took over
the the school
board's duties
and, and
so what happened
there? >> Yeah,
Mr. Chair and Representative
Chatfield, the school districts
that I'm aware of um
had to do with inappropriate
behavior on the part of the board and,
or fiscal irresponsibility
>> but not with the performance of the
students. >> Mr. Chair
and Representative.
No.
>> Um I think New
Mexico did a study
of the schools that were
making the grade with math
and reading.
Uh,
there were 12 in the State,
six of them were
in my district. They
were four day schools on the
east side of the State.
Uh That's
all. Thank
you.
It was in BCA.
>> Thank you, Mister Chairman and thank
you for your presentation. Please
understand that I'm going to be
out of character,
but I'm not directing my comments to
you. I understand
that.
I think when we uh
Mr. Chairman, when we look at this
thing, we talk about the increase of
funding. My first
question is
from the school districts. How much
are they reporting that that funding
is reaching to the areas
or the targeted that
they're
intended?
>> Mr. Chair and
Representative? I
think it's very interesting
that we have
included new
accounting
codes to
identify whether some of this
funding is making it to at risk
students. And
if you turn with me to
page
10,
what we're also finding is
that
the data is highly
variable. So in fiscal
year 20 the
department reported
that 70 per
75% of the
at risk funding was being
spent on at risk
services. But
in fiscal year, 23 only
23% of it was
being spent on at risk services
and it could be a timing
issue on the data was collected.
It could be changes
in practice on how schools are
coding it. But I
think the takeaway from this is
that, you know, we don't
have definitive
answers on how
this funding is being spent
even though we
have infused the system with
$1.6 billion
in a recurring
basis.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, and that's
really my point
is that we, the legislature
has done and has supported
public education,
but much of the
funding and much of the
districts are in worse
financial shape because of
other outside factors.
And I'm going to also say that
the Ozzy Martinez
was for a
specific group, but based
upon our performance, now, more
students are at risk, all students
are at risk. So we've got
to do a better job of
making sure that the funding that
this legislature puts
forward
actually reaches to that
classroom to that student
level and provides them
support, not
just a
blanket
kind of solution,
but actually
individualized.
Uh Mr. Chairman, I'm gonna
point out and I'm gonna keep saying this
about the 180 day
rule.
The fact about it is,
you know, when we
looked at
180 days, I'm gonna say
that it's
quality, not
quantity.
You know, we, if we have
more days of bad instruction,
it's not going to
help.
I think we need to look at engagement.
Ok. And I don't know how you measure
engagement, but I think you
can buy attendance. Right?
Do I know we heard a couple of weeks
ago, what is the percentage or
do you guys know of our students that
are what they
consider
non attendance or have attendance
issues? Mr.
Chairman
>> Mr. Chairman Representative Baco,
we have about a 39%
chronic absenteeism rate
as a State.
>> So Mr.
Chairman and
uh Sunny and
Gwen, so that saying is
that four out of 10
students are
not attending school,
but yet then we want to give them more
school. That's like a
student that's ditching class. I come
back to school and you suspend
me.
That doesn't make sense to
me before we're
putting out requirements and
taking local control away from the
districts
we need to figure out is
how can we get our students
back in class?
How can we get students here? And I,
I'm gonna tell you that, I think
that it's not
necessarily
more money but it's money in the
right areas.
And I think that we
have
neglected some
areas as
far as when I asked last week, we were
in uh Chama
and asked how much money has been spent
for school security out of
that 3.6
billion or whatever it was. And Sonny,
do you remember your answer or the answer
that was given?
>> Um Mr. Chair? I
apologize. I was not at
chama. But >> it was, it
was, I'll, I'll give the answer. It was
$1 million.
And so I, I think when we're
looking at
funding,
when we look at this, I'm gonna keep
on till we're, I'm sitting here
until I'm not here anymore.
I'm gonna say it's
about,
it's about activities. It's
about CTE,
it's about getting students to
want to come to class,
whatever it is. I don't care if
they're involved in activities,
athletics, career,
technical,
those are the types of things that we
need to be bringing and getting our
students to school.
And I think that a lot of these other
programs,
I think that are
basically quite honestly
haven't shown results yet,
but students that are engaged
and students that are there
and attending school
are doing much better than those that are
not. And what we gotta do is we gotta
find that out.
And also Mr. Chairman,
we talk about funding and I'm gonna
talk about specific targeted
funding towards certain
grade bands and certain
levels.
And one of the areas that I think
that we're having and struggling with
is our middle
schools.
Our elementaries are putting out
students that are more
proficient.
And when we get to middle schools, we start
to see the decline and then when we get
to high schools and we deal with the
graduation rate, dropout
rates and our low
performance. So
when we look at these kinds of decisions
and we look at how this legislator
has basically said we support
education. We
have to make sure that
the money that we
allocate
goes to the intended
people, independent
students and the
programs. And the last
thing Mr. Chairman I'm gonna say is we need
consistency,
consistency of leadership,
consistency of assessment
and consistency of programmatic
needs. Because when,
when we're talking about every
year or every couple years, we're
switch switching assessment
or we're switching the
curriculum,
then we come here just like it was
said yesterday by my, my colleague,
Mr. Garcia.
It's like we're constantly starting
over and nobody has the answer
and everybody passes the
buck folks.
I've been in education 32
years,
taught at every grade
level
and the education that we gave
32 years ago as I was talking to my
colleague, Senator uh
Gonzalez,
we gave a pretty good education
back then. Well, why
have we are taking steps
back? And
I think that's what we really need to do is
we need to get in there,
dig deep into,
into the data and
find out how we can
support schools. Because I'll be
honest, like
Senator Munoz says
it's not about the money,
it's about the right money at the right
programs. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank
you.
Let's see. Uh Representative
our meal.
Thank you to
follow.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair.
Um Hard Act to follow you,
right? Um
So, um when
we are looking at
um uh performance
of those uh
targeted Children. I,
I agree with um
Representative BCA that we need
a matrix on how to measure
that. I'm in the
um fortunate position to also
be on the school board and have worked in the
school districts for many years,
um doing special
education.
So,
um
I think that's, that's my biggest
concern. We're pouring money
into a district or into
education and,
and what measures are
we are we looking at
to ensure that that funding
is going to where it's
intended?
And um,
and what matrix are we looking
at? Even as a school
board, we don't have the
matrix. We're supposed to
have uh the Equity Council
reporting back to,
to the school board to see
where this measurement is. And
I'd, I'd be interested in
seeing how many
districts have formed
equity councils and how many equity
councils are actually
reporting that information
back to school or school
boards.
Um
And even uh
how, where do we
start and where do we train this,
uh start this training
for teachers, for
administrators on where
to focus our, our
funding
is, is concerning Mr.
Chair. The, in addition,
um I'd like to talk about
um some concerns that I've
seen uh reported
in certain districts where
um Children of color
have been expelled from school.
And so,
um you know, how are we
dealing with that?
And um
and, and where do we go from
there? I think it's a, it's a larger
problem. I've, I've heard
it from several school districts
and uh the
goal should not be
expulsion for
difficult um
uh situationss that
we're, we're looking at.
I want, I want good
numbers measuring
exactly what, what
our target focus is
and not um
not getting rid of Children
in those numbers. So
thank you very
much.
>> Represent Pettigrew.
We're going to stay right on time. So
everybody be
so unlike Representative
Bak and I will stay true
to, for him. So
you understand
that starting
off, we're
at the point, uh, Chairman
where, um,
at some point in time we have to
hold somebody accountable.
I look at,
um,
I look at this
process
and I
look at all the
years, I see all the LFC
reports. We just
got an
update,
um, on
pe D this
year or this
quarter. I don't
see the improvements.
I see us throwing a lot of
money at it
to see a decision
Mr. Chairman
back
in a, made by a
district
Judge
that probably shouldn't
have been qualified to make the
decisions that he
made that
district Judge made at the
time. But I see
nothing. We've done
different acts, we've done
different things, but
we've never codified
what the right thing to do
is we've never pushed
it and I understand the
statement Mr. Chair
where,
um, you know, it's
up to pe D to figure out how to do
that. Well,
this is nothing against our current
Secretary.
I'm gonna hold that
and, uh, I'm just gonna be a
little more direct with respect
to that.
A couple of decades
ago, we took away
the public education
board and we replaced
it with a system that is
now a bureaucracy
that we don't hold
accountable.
And at some point in time, do
they need the funding? Do they need
that? I watch our school
districts, I go to different school
districts outside of my
area. I see all
the efforts that they're trying to
do. I
see where we're pushing our special
ed students aside.
I see where we're
putting money to our special
ed students. But I see the
special ed department struggling
to be able to take care of
stuff.
I watch school districts that
have students that are,
are, are not
performing
and they mov'e them into an
alternative
to where they get closer
to one on one teaching.
They get the impact, they get the
things that they need. But
then I look at us from a State
and say, you know, we need
to improve our graduation, our
graduation, what this,
sorry, our graduation
rates,
but then the
tests that we have have no
benchmarks.
We're not gonna rate our
students. Matter
of fact, for a couple of years, we just
let them fly right through.
At what point in time,
Chairman do
we pull back
the reins
on the fourth floor
and on pe D and say
enough's
enough.
You're spending money.
Like what, what was the phrase
the other day? Drunken sailors?
You're spending money like drunken
sailors and you're getting no
progress. You know, there was a time
in New Mexico. We used to say
thank God for Mississippi.
Now Mississippi sits there and
says, thank God for New
Mexico.
But I look at the graphs, I
see how much
money we're putting and
investing.
I'd like to see real
solutions that,
that allow our
school
boards
to make those decisions
because it's very crystal
clear
Chairman
that Santa Fe bureaucracy
is making the wrong decisions.
And we continue to prove that
year by year by year
and we tend to continue to give
Santa Fe more money
to deal with the problem
and not provide
solutions
this last year. In a 30 day
Session, I watched us put
together
funds
with mill
hundreds of millions of dollars
in it with no guard
rails.
Yeah, we'll give them three years to
figure it out.
No guard rows from
house appropriations.
No Guard row from Senate
finance, no guard
row from the bill that
was passed in house
to
nothing.
At what point in time
do we stop
funding
stuff and coming up
with better solutions? And that's
my concern. We're
not doing that. Thank you,
Chairman. Thank
you, Senator
Sheer.
Well, we'll mov'e to the next
person
that,
>> ok,
so we, so we've put money into
a variety of things. But what we haven't
done is,
is focus on the
goals. So
we focused on the systems that we
hope will get us to the goal, but we haven't
focused on the goal. The goal
is, can they read? Can
they do math?
Um, and
in, at least from where I'm standing,
it doesn't matter how they learn to read.
Yes, we have, uh, things
that are proven
but,
but 300,000
different personalities out
there, uh,
Children.
So some will read
differently.
The goal is, can they read,
not, do teachers get paid more?
Not are the facilities
nicer
all of those things. And, and
so I think that that's the one thing
that we're missing,
um, is the focus
on the goal.
Ok. So, uh,
in a football thing, the focus
isn't on the formation, the
focus isn't on,
on anything
else in that game. The focus
is, can you cross the
goal line period
and how you get there is almost
irrelevant. That's why we have
different plays.
Ok.
Um,
so
I think that's the thing that we need
to, to really focus
on. What's the
goal
the goal is, can they read,
can they do math?
So,
as, as, as
you know,
um,
I threw out an idea last
year and granted it
wasn't thought
through completely, but it was
just to try to get the, the conversation
started is that every school
district gets whatever the SCG
is, period, they
just get it.
But if you
hit certain performance,
you get a bonus
and the bonus is unlimited, you get to
do whatever you want with it.
So if you
decide you need to have a new
football field, fine,
build a new football field.
If that football field keeps
kids in school and they learn to
read, you
win. If
the football field means
nothing, then
you don't hit your goal next year,
you lose the
bonus.
The other thing I think we do is that
we put too many restrictions
on below the
line
things.
There is a
gigantic difference
between Roy school
district and Albuquerque
school district. And
yet we come up with the same plan.
OK. Whatever they do in
Albuquerque we have to do in Roy and vice
versa. They're not the
same. OK?
Kirtland, a central
consolidated school district
is not Farmington school
district, even though we all shop in the
same Walmart,
it's different.
So allow the uh
uh allow the
powers to be in
that district, the school board
and the, and the superintendent figure
out what's right for that school
district,
but the bottom line is can they
read?
And I don't think anything
else,
you know, that that's what we ought to
measure. We don't need to measure
how many teachers we have. Although
that May import, be important to
getting to the goal.
We don't need to measure how cool the
facilities are. We
measure? Can they read? Can
they read at grade level
period? All of the
other bureaucracy just needs to be
swept aside.
And,
and on July 14th,
1946
what I
do.
So, so that's, that's,
that's what I'm hoping
there,
Mr. Secretary.
So Les
CLFC
focus on what's important.
Can you
read?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank
you for your presentation.
I wanted to uh
follow up a little more on the
classroom size,
um on the
inadequate inputs.
Uh, we had smaller
class size. And so do we,
have you all done any kind
of, what have you done
to, to talk about that or,
or do some, some
investigating?
>> Sure. Uh Thank you,
Mr. Chairman and Representative
Armstrong. I'll start and then actually,
I'll probably turn it over to Mr.
Liu because he,
as well as one of our LES C
um analysts did a
joint study of this
um last month and I thought it
was pretty, it was very
telling. The first thing
I'll say is that the data
is pretty
messy
um as we
are seeing with all data
right now in terms of
um being able
to
understand what's happening
uh related
to
any type of initiative that
we would support you all
with. So that being
said, when we look at
the data, we see that
statewide, our
averages is class size are
actually fairly low.
So they're sort of in the range of
between 15 and
20 at all
grade levels including
high school. Now, this is
granted that we have some
very specialized
um classes in high
school that have maybe few
class students in them.
But as a rule in general
across the State, it's a
fairly low class size,
particularly when we compare
with other national
averages.
Um And so, um,
as a result of this,
as well as our current
teacher uh shortage,
as well as sort of
understanding at the root
of this issue is that
teachers don't feel supported right
now or feel like they can
actually adequately
address of the needs in their
classroom. One of
the things that
their their report attempted to
do is under um
unpack, what are other
things that we could do to support
teachers um and
address sort of this issue
that we're seeing around retention and
recruitment for educators in the
State. Um They
looked at um
additional educational
assistance, the importance of
teacher residencies to have
other adults in the
classroom. They
looked at the importance of
professional development, supporting
teacher time and they
also looked at a very,
I think um very
hopeful policy
that might um happen
around innovative staffing
where schools have the
ability to um
if you have four
teachers and one of those
teachers is a young,
young. Um I don't want to
call them a baby teacher, but a 1st
2nd year teacher, um
perhaps their class size is
smaller. The other teachers
have a larger class size and
get a stipend for doing
that because they're, they're master
veteran teachers. So
that ability to have
differences and really
also attend to local control,
I think is an important consider
and consideration in all of
that.
>> Mr. Chair
director warm. It
covered that pretty extensively.
I will say, you
know, to our chair's point, we've
got a declining enrollment,
but our teacher core is pretty
flat. So you're
gonna see smaller classroom
sizes without essentially
taking action.
One thing that,
you know, it is going to be very
interesting in the next few
years is with the introduction
of A I. And you know,
there's a lot of
opportunities to
see how that can help with
personalized learning, but
also challenges.
When you
have one teacher,
you have 15
students and you're
trying to in these
silos, understand
how to use
how to leverage instruction
and the quality of instruction.
Um
In addition to having this
other component that
May be more engaging for students,
it goes back to Representative
Baca's point about,
you know, tackling
the root cause which the court
was trying to get at with
smaller class sizes
improved instruction.
And so how do we
address that? The court said
this could be one way that the
legislature approaches it,
but you know,
it, it is going to evolve over
time. >> Thank
you for that. I um I just
know like in rural New Mexico,
Mr. Chairman that,
you know, there's 1/4 grade
class.
So that's, that
could be tricky
um
for the, you know, the bonuses
or whatever uh that
we talked about earlier.
Uh The other thing that I wanted to
bring to everyone's
attention is this
transportation
situation.
I've,
um
we, we did it
last year in House Bill
two and
we had a presentation
yesterday that
gave us actual,
um, it was under tab
C
on page
six. How
it affected some of the
schools
and, and the
language is, you know,
um they
calculated without the
population density
factor and with a new
geographic rurality
factor,
but it shows here
that Espanola
Clayton, Simone
Pewaukee, Hatch Socorro
Silver, Zuni
Taos and Roswell. And I
know Magdalena is missing off
of that list.
Um They all lost money
in transportation
and so I think we need to
revisit
how we did that
and why
and uh everyone,
all my constituents are
complaining that they've lost
transportation money all.
At the same time, we're holding schools
accountable to get these kids to
and from school trying
to get them to school
specifically. So I would
really like to, to
revisit how we
came up with that formula
while a lot of
schools increased, but
a lot of schools decreased.
And uh it looks
like
uh well Albu
Albuquerque got a huge
increase
and so
uh
um so I just like to, to
refocus and look at that
again to see, I would just want
fairness across the
board. Um
So if we could look at that, I would
appreciate it.
Uh The other thing that
uh I want to talk about and
everybody knows I'm gonna bring it
up. But
on page si
uh page eight
um of the legislative
education study Committee,
you can see
where
the legislative
action
was for the
1140
hours.
Then right next to it, you
see Executive
action 100 and 80 day
rule.
Once again, we're circumventing
the legislative process by
making that rule.
Uh Our intent
was ours
not days.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
Representative
Romero.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So, Director Pereo ornament
you mentioned about input,
showing promise. I was wondering if
you could elaborate on what those
inputs are and where they're showing
promise.
>> Sure. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman and thank you, Representative
um Chairman Romero.
Um
So,
um I, I'll flip
to the last
page of
the slide
deck
um
slide 19
to talk a little bit about a couple
of those inadequate inputs
that were recognized by
the um court
and where we see some
very positive
movement in addressing
these inadequate inputs.
Um Part of the legislature,
the first is one a in
terms of quality full day pre
pre-kindergarten.
Um I think that the
funding that has
gone to support
early childhood on
behalf of the legislature is
strikingly
successful.
Um really
wonderful uh what
the legislature has done in this
space. Um I think
that the department of the
early childhood early Care
Department has
done a good job
to try to get at
um supporting and
building full day pre-kindergarten
across the State while also
doing so to in a mixed
methods uh meth
methodology.
Um I
would say that there are
um in one e research
based reading programs that the
court um identified
again, the legislature
has acted
swiftly by establishing
Legislation in 2019
around structured literacy
and the science of reading. Um
and has continued to
fund very aggressively.
This um
and education department
has actually acted
very well in
partnership with the legislature
here. So the tune of
8000 teachers have now
trained in the science
of reading, uh first
grade, uh kindergarten,
second grade, third grade, fourth grade
now into fifth grade teachers
trained model school
set up. Um You'll
see some of the outcomes
from that I believe.
Um I think that
you um see
some really strong support
from the legislature, uh
the inputs to
for ensuring
colledge and career readiness,
uh strong funding
for career technical education.
As you heard from representative
earlier, the importance from I think
resoundingly from many
people um
in the legislature to support
CTE as well as uh
update the graduation
requirements, support work based
learning internships,
um understand the need for
high school redesign.
Um And then I think
that particularly
number six, which we didn't speak
to a lot but has
been very successful.
Is the funding of instructional
materials to the tune
of now $55
million
in the State equalization
guarantee.
>> Mr. Chairman, thank you for
that for that recap.
Um Because
in the legislative education
study Committee, I keep hearing from
Members about not
having a particular
focus or kind of
um wanting
policies. But
we all at the
Legislative education study Committee
with, along with
um our partners here at the
legislative finance
Committee, um have been
working on a
holistic plan
um to address the concerns,
not just of the
lawsuit but of our students
in general. When we talk of
our students, it's all
students in the State of New
Mexico. And I
think that's something that
we as a
legislature
um can stand
behind. But we also
know that the work isn't
finished. There are plenty of areas
where we need to
continue to
put work in.
But um
it's something that, that
we definitely have,
have a plan for when we
talk about um
diver creating a
diverse workforce so
that our
educators
are from the
communities that they're working
in um that they're
well-trained
um
in something like
structured literacy
um that our
elementary students
and elementary
uh educators
are, are working toward
uh we're working on
that um
educator prep programs.
Um Another program
to, to bring educators
into our classroom and to give
them the necessary
practice that they need
um also vital.
And I think some
of these have been in great partnership
with the department. You heard from
director ornament about
um structured literacy and
making sure that that is implemented.
But we also heard from
Representative Armstrong, there are
places where we can
definitely improve
that collaboration
because as Representative
Armstrong brought up as represent
uh Baca had brought up.
It's gonna take everybody
working together
to continue to solve these
problems in creating
those metrics of what
do we want our student
outputs to be.
We're starting to put
in the inputs
on the legislative
side and giving
that responsibility
to our school districts.
Um
And
we understand that there needs
to be some sort of
accountability
um on both
sides. And I
think through the
plan, certainly that we've been
working on through the legislative education
study Committee. It's a long
term plan, not just
looking at the next 60 day
Session and working Session by
Session, but it's something that
we're looking 5, 10 years
out. Um And we
certainly appreciate
the, the work that the legislative
finance Committee is doing
um to work with us
on those programs.
Um And certainly
want that continued support
amongst the department to continue
what these long term
visions are
because we May be
here for the next
election. We May be here for a
couple, who knows when our
time here at the legislature must
end. Um But we're going to
continue having students in our
classrooms and we need educators
in our classroom and we need the
community supports
to continue. So
certainly with that, I appreciate the
time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Thank you
>> Dixon.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um And thank
you uh director
and Sunny for the presentation.
Um I
wanted to
highlight um
that I'm really pleased
to hear some of the improvements.
Um, you know, I think a lot of
times we don't hear
that. Um, and
it's hard in
the legislature, I think.
Um, it's easy for us
to hear from constituents
about the problems.
Um, but
you've provided us
with some concrete
improvements that have been
made. Um, and these
improvements take
time, uh, they
take multiple years. Um, and
so I think while we would all
like to see
some of the changes happen,
um, immediately it's
important that we recognize
that that's just not how it
works.
Um I
do have a
question about
one f
in the, um,
you know, the list of
actions or
items. I was wondering if you
could provide an update on
how, how we
are doing with
providing our
schools at all levels,
with counselors, social
workers and other support
staff that really
are critical. Um,
and I often
hear um
from schools
where, you know, my
constituents attend that
there, there aren't adequate
counselors and social
workers.
>> Sure. Um
Thank you, Mr. Chair and
Representative Dixon. Um
Fabulous
question. Um I'm
gonna highlight a couple of
things and then,
um, actually offer
some uh potential
thoughts for future
um uh movement.
The first is, uh, the
legislature has
recognized that this is
a, this is a long game in
particular. Um We
have issues of capacity as a
State because of our limited
population.
So even if,
and we've done this research actually at the
education study Committee,
even if we change the
ratio that is required
for schools of a counselor
to student ratio
to 250 to
1, which is the national recommended
ratio, which just seems kind of
astronomical already. To
me, we're actually at
450 right now
to 1
450 students to one
councilor, which is crazy.
And there are some schoolss who don't have
a counselor. Um
But even if we just, you know,
again, broads swath policy
said everyone needed to, we
would, we would, we would not be
able to make that
happen. Um And you
would simply be pointing out that
schools are again failing in this
account. So,
um the finance Committee
itself actually, I think has done a
really good job of recognizing
the investment here is at the prep
um educator preparation
level and really
funding support
for um
um both residencies,
but then also just endowments
for faculty to support
social work programs, council
programs. And I think that's
a really good, strong, long
term pro um um
movement forward
and for school districts in
particular, the
the additional dollars
that have gone are tripled as
Mr. Lou said for at risk
funding is really the
specific space that is
intended to support this
type of personnel for
school districts.
Um And the way that
the at risk factor is
designed is sort of on a three year
rolling basis. So there is some
stability for school districts so that
they can hire actually
councilors and social
workers.
Um I will
say that in some of the research that
we've done, it's important
to note the sort of range
here around
guidance
counselors
to um and
colledge and career um counseling
that's actually also very much
needed and supporting our at risk
students to actual
counselors and social
workers, both for special
ed and regular
students. So
noting that there's
also some issues in terms
of um having clarification
with professional licensure and
working with the department in that
space.
So,
>> um thank you Mr. Chair.
Um And my last
question is, you know,
if, what would
you recommend? And this is
sort of for the two of you.
Um You know, we
focus on
sort of 12 and
three.
moving forward.
Where do you know,
where should we put our,
our efforts?
Thank you,
Senator Gonzalez.
>> Yeah, I
did.
>> Well, if they,
if they're able to answer, that would
be, that would be
lovely,
>> Mr. Chair and
Representative.
I think what's
really
interesting about this
list on page
19 is
that this was testimony
from districts that
the court agreed
with. So
it was not a fully exhaustive
list, but it was simply
what the court said.
This is what I'm hearing from
districts and these
things we've seen show
evidence of improving outcomes.
And so the State needs
to
potentially do more of these
things to try and get to that
true north of improved
outcomes.
Ultimately,
what you should be focusing
on are things that will
get us to that true
North, whether
it's on this list or not.
Um And what we're
seeing from the data,
which is your metric of
success
currently
is that you have really
large achievement gaps
for
particularly special
education English
learners. I think
when you go back to the list
that's on
page
um
13.
Yeah, I'm gonna just point out
page seven for this
one. The court
said the your English learners
lack appropriate
programs
and this is actually
an area where the legislature hasn't
really taken
large um
steps towards addressing.
I mean, we, we have
a increasingly
uh we have an
increasing need to serve our English
learner population and a lot
of them are not in the gold
standard program of dual
language immersion, which the court
spent extensive time
discussing.
One thing that you do
have though
is
20,000
teachers.
And as you probably heard
from comments today, I would
say if you can
improve the quality of
instruction, the
actual delivery of instruction
in classrooms. If you can get
to that very difficult
messy
piece,
whether that's through
improved social
emotional learning or
higher um
evidence-based
practices
using data to
change practice, right? If your
assessment system is timely enough
to tell you that
um you
can address a lot of these other
secondary and tertiary
problems that the court has
identified so that
that would be sort of
job number
one.
>> Um I'll, I'll reiterate
um because I think it's
actually
one of the top three most
important areas and that is to
support English learners. I
don't feel like uh Mr.
Chairman and um
Representative Dixon, we
are um adequately
identifying or doing that as
a State um Both
in funding and or program
actually,
um they're
very much related. Um
I will say that as we look at the
seg and are embarking on a
revision of the SCG.
We are noting
and um sharing with Mr.
Lou and um director
silly some
possible um
changes we want to minimize
any changes. We think we have a
pretty solid State
equalization guarantee.
But English
learner um in
particular in that space might
be something for you to um
um address.
Uh Second,
also very similar to
Mr. Lieu is teacher
supports and
recognizing that
the, you know,
this State of where we
are in public education in New
Mexico has a
lot to do with the fund.
The, the initial level of
instruction that
we see with many
educators and they're not
able to feel successful
to get the results that we
expect.
And so what are all
of those supports that the
system is not providing right
now, whether it's special
education teachers
for inclusion settings,
um it's professional
development time,
right? So that
layer that Mr. Lou is
describing is essential
for a successful system.
The adults are what make the
system, the system
actually.
Um And then
third and not um
not least, I think
we have not really
addressed
math.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair,
Senator
>> Gonzalez.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you to both of you.
Um We've
had a, I guess
a lot of discussion
in many areas
and I'll just keep it down to
two. But
what suggestions
can we work together
to improve
the high
absenteeism?
And you mentioned that he was at
39%.
So that's pretty hard
to gain and to
change that report
card when you have
almost 40% of the
students not there,
you know. So, uh,
do you have something
or can we work
on during
the legislative Session to
come up with a better
part into
improving the high absentee
rate?
>> Yes, Mr. Chairman and
Senator Gonzalez. Uh
I think that is one of
the most
concerning issues
for both us at the
uh education study
Committee staff and certainly
the Members. Um I know
it is uh for
staff of the finance Committee
and you all. Um
I was very
pleased to partner with directors
um, uh, and
the program evaluation and
looking at attendance that
passed over the past month and
we're continuing to work with
staff to, as we
look at attendance into
September, I think,
and I know that the department is
particularly concerned with
this as well.
Um I will
say because of the complexity
of the issue, there's this
is a very
difficult um
um issue to actually
address with
one or two
answers much less
funding because the
gamut is, students
don't attend because they're disengaged
because they don't like school, they don't
feel connected, they don't like teachers,
two students don't
attend school because they of
transportation and
everything in between. And
so when you have a range of
issues for students in terms
of attendance, being able
to have good data and
analytics and predictive data
to be able to target exactly
what, what student needs, what
is part of the solution.
Um And, and certainly
partnership in and among
each other, I think is that we are in
a great place to actually
um help you
with something for,
>> oh Mr. Chairman, you
know, if you're
willing to put a like a think
tank and we have
some people in the audience too that
are experts that have had a lot of
experience,
you know, I'd be more than glad to
work with that,
you know, to, to,
and the other
part that I want to look at
is if one
school district is doing
well, we
shouldn't implement that
mold, that model to
everyone, you
know, and just address where
it's happening with a higher
absentee versus,
you know, the ones that are doing
well. Um
The other part is
so
I really feel that
if we want to see that needle go
up, we really
have to look at the professional
development.
And is it really taking
place? Is it really
taking place
quality wise? Is
it being consistent
and how are we doing
that statewide
versus just
saying we have professional
development? Uh, I
don't buy that, you know,
because it's just left
too loose and,
you know, so how can we
work with that part
of, you know, more
consistent and a more
solid concrete
professional development?
And I think we would really see
some very high
results
working with
that?
Well, if you want to
respond fine, if not, I'll
just,
>> um, Mis Mr.
Chair Senator,
I think that, uh,
you're, you're correct that we really
need to think about
how, whether that professional
development is happening and, and
in concert with all these
other things that are
improving the quality of instruction
as well. Um
I will, I will note
on our attendance evaluation
one of our recommendations
was, you know, if
you could just get kids
to attend the days
that they're already
implementing, you could
already see in significant gains
in performance overall.
And so
it May even need to be
more of a targeted approach
on, you know, why
are high school students missing
school
versus why
are kindergartner missing
school? Those are very different
approaches. And yet we
have a law that
requires schools to look
at this in a very
broad way.
So thinking
about that nuance and moving
away from just
compliance, which
is sort of where we're at in
the stage of the attendance for
Success Act and actually
looking at how we
can be more targeted and provide the
infrastructure for that.
Um I think
that that is the next
step that, that we're we need
to take >> with this Mr.
Chairman. I think it's
very, very
important
and I'll give
you an example,
those signs that you see
on the highway
$300
fine for throwing
liter, you
know, according to the department, this
is a few years back,
there has only been one citation
on the history of that
law.
So, you know, maybe
we just need to just
revisit the whole thing
of like you're
saying, maybe different
categories for
kindergarten through third grade
and you know, breaking that,
that part of the
attendance. But I mean,
they can't learn if they're not
there and they're not
going to be there. It's because
if you're not offering something
that they want to be there
and it's different, you know,
we're in a different time
versus
what we had before
when we went to school.
But, um, you know,
um I'd be more than glad to, to
work with that and help you with
that. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. >> Thank
you, Senator Bindo real quick. And then we
got one more >> and thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair
Members of the Committee.
Thank you for your presentation.
And what do you do?
So I'm glad you said something about the
teachers, how they feel even the
students because that human
component I think is what we,
we know what the outcomes
we want to have. But
that in between is not
something I don't think we've looked at or
really heard about where
we're always saying, well, the bad school, the
bad school, we know there are good schools
that exist.
So how do we get there?
We're saying, well, we have these best
practices, we put them in law and we're
saying this is what we want. We have these
guidelines, we have these
policies, but
how do we measure that component,
you know, out of the data we're
collecting and make
that connection.
Because when we talk about
discipline too,
we're moving to that
matrix of, oh well,
we want to be fair.
Everybody has to be equal and be
treated. But
we know every situation
is unique in
itself. So we take
that human component from
our principles from those
that decide on the discipline.
And we say, well, you
know, it's,
it doesn't matter why
should we even have them in there
handling discipline if
we're saying, well, because these
two got in a fight, they're all
going to be suspended
regardless of how
that, um,
you know, how, how that arose.
So I hope we can work on that and
really find out how do we get from
what we're doing to, to
put all that together? Um Thank
you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mister Chairman. Just a quick
question.
Thank you for your presentation.
Good morning.
The average of 30
whatever, the 39% that you're
saying 10 and so
forth. Is there a
map or is there some
information where
is this across the
board or, or, or
certain regions or certain
schools urban
rule
who's doing better?
Who's not? Is there something that
we could, I could refer to to
look at that data?
>> Certainly, uh Mr.
Chairman Senator
Sho, um I'm sure uh
between our staff
and uh LFC staff, we can
direct you to a couple of things.
Um There's been a couple
of reports that have been
produced, the Tenants report that
was just a program evaluation
uh produced in
June, some data
as well as attendance report that we
produced last
fall. Can also has
that. And there's a
webs page
from the public education department
that actually lists
attendance by district
and school and it has a cumulative
total, um, chronic absenteeism
rate for the entire State.
Uh, briefly at the top
of my head, if I remember
correctly. Um, I
native American studentss,
uh, have a very high
chronic absenteeism rate.
I think it's a, to the tune
of, um,
45%
maybe sunny will be able to bring it up.
Um, and, but the students
who are most
concerning this is not
surprising are
students who are homeless
and foster
students.
>> Thank you, Mr. >> Chairman.
Thank you. Just, just to kind
of wrap this up. I mean,
it's not for a lack of money
that we're not getting there.
Right, because I'm adding the
numbers and we have
$4.2 billion
plus another 700
million in early
childhood. Right. Which
is coming online. Those kids
when they start that program
should now be in like
seniors or juniors
in that time frame that tells you how long
I've been here. Plus
the cash balances that the school
districts have that they're not spending
right,
$5.5
billion.
that's not getting out into
the system, right?
I
pardon?
623 million plus
the 700 plus 4.2
right gets roughly
to 5.5 billion right in that
range. But I mean,
623 million
in cash balances, tell us the money's
not getting spent in the school
districts.
I mean,
I mean, the Yazzie Martinez is
really a consent degree on this,
right? But it doesn't have definitions
and parameters and
you can't individualize
that on each
and every kid, right? Because
the kid that lives in Eastern
New Mexico
is completely different than the
kid that lives in Northwest
New Mexico, right?
The culture is different, the
the religious is different,
it's just a different culture,
it's different in the South Valley
of Albuquerque than it
is in, in
Kado. And,
and so it's not for a lack of
money
and a declining population,
you can't keep increasing
budgets when you have a declining
population, less
students
and,
and want more money and the
performance is not there. And
I think in the prior
administration, we had performance
measures and
then we got a new administration
and they all went away and
there's no measures
anymore
and, and we could gauge that
on during that time
frame.
But I mean, how do I mean,
do we go back to the courts and,
and tell them, you know, the Ozzie Martinez
is just a consent degree.
So give us XY and
Z that we have to
meet the to the consent
degree and then we can
hold the schools accountable
with parents
accountable
for doing that. I mean,
how do we fix this?
Because
Yazzie Martinez is almost
a decade old from this
time. They filed a lawsuit.
Right.
And, and we still
keep pumping more money and
pumping more money. I mean,
2023
I mean, in three years went up
a billion and a half and it's not
changing.
I don't know, I'm, I have personal
opinions but I, you know, my
wife has worked everywhere from
grade schools
to, uh, what's
a school where that's their last chance
to go back to
school,
uh, and
everywhere. And I'm, I've seen the
metrics that she's worked in.
Right. And, and it comes down to
this teachers have to have a
handle on those kids in association
with them and they want to go to
school to see that teacher.
Right.
And, and they want to learn
and,
but I don't know, it's not for lack of
money. It's,
it's, uh,
we took away performance measures
and there's really no way to measure
anything. So if
nobody's getting checked, if
we're spending the money and apparently
we're not because from
2022
to
2023
400 million in cash
balances went
up.
So they're not spending the money, they're
getting it, but they're not spending
it. And then they're complaining
they don't have enough money for
buses or gas
or their cash balance has
been, look independently on which
one, which ones are doing
what? But I don't
know, we got a long, long road
to haul, but I mean,
my preference would be to go
back to the courts and
say, ok, give us a termination
on what things we're failing at.
So we can go get those done
and then hold the school districts and
everybody accountable for getting that
done. Otherwise we're just
gonna keep pumping more money and more
money and
it's, this is going to be the same
old story since I've been here since
2009.
And so, I mean, it's,
there's more money but it's
not changing. It's actually getting
worse.
And I, I think the COVID
Horor cohort
is going to be a cliff
effect for us somewhere
to, and those
group of kids that
weren't in the classroom and
that cliff effect for that covert
who is really going to drop us off
and then we're going to drop way
down, then it's going to just shoot right back
up. But I really
don't know how we fix this. But
that's your guys'
and Representative
Romero's issue
and who else is on education?
And
Representative Baca, who gave
us a strict talk to, I
mean,
it's all about a parental involvement
and those kids wanting to go to school and
whatever it takes to get them
to go to school, right? They
have to want to, it's like they want to go to the
carnival and ride the ride,
they want to, right?
They have to have that want to go to
school. So thank
you guys. Appreciate
your
time,
Mr.
Secretary.
We're gonna be behind Tab
H
I
see.
I I know you're not
going to be here for, for a day or
two or tomorrow when
we go over some of this stuff. But I
want you to read something for what
the legislature is looking
at in the, in
the future, right?
Uh because of slower growth and
future future
revenue growth, continued, higher
recurring spending will
be unsustainable.
Demonstrating the importance of
moderate spending growth in the near
term.
That's what we're going to be looking
at over the next year. So, I
mean, do you need to plan
for that within your agencies and
school districts? Because
1.6 billion
in three years is a lot. I know you
weren't there
and,
but you can go ahead
and start.
>> Thank you, Mr.
>> Chair.
>> I think your last comments were
very um
very appropriate for
this next hearing that we're about
to have, which is the legis
that document on
page or tab
H
because we
are right at
the cusp of having
three years of data, which is
enough to draw
a trend line on what's about to
happen. And COVID
did throw a wrench into that.
But I think
if we stay the course with
the assessment and the measures that
we're using,
we will have better
analysis and better data
and better ways to report on what's
actually happening.
And now that our systems are coming
back online.
And I do want to actually thank
the department because
they gave us preliminary
information, very rough,
a lot of caveats
to it, but they
came forward and gave it
because they wanted to
show that
we do have the information
we're working through it
and we're willing to have an honest
conversation about what's
happening.
Um I
just want to start by giving a
little bit of a preface on
the legis that process and then I'm
gonna hand it over to the department
to actually go over this joint
report.
Um Legis
sta is really about
staying focused, right?
Looking at a common set
of data that the
department and you want
to have a shared
conversation over
and that each time you come back
to legis sta that
you revisit the things that you
discussed last time to see if
progress has been
made.
If you want to turn to
page four in your legis,
that document,
here's a recap of the last
three legis at sessions,
some of the
asks of the department
or sort of promises of
what they would follow
up on. And you
can see it's a little been a
little across the
board. It, it has sort
of focused a little
bit on asking the
department to increase instructional
time to
reinstate testing during
the pandemic
to reduce their
processing times for
reimbursements.
But
the question is, where are
we now compared to where we were
when we had that conversation? So
as you go through this document,
as you hear from the Secretary,
I encourage you to dig
a bit deeper into
why get to root
causes on why we're seeing the
things we're seeing and
then commit to walking away and
saying next time we have
legis that I want to hear
an update on X.
And with that, I'm gonna turn over
to Secretary Romero. Thank
you. >> Thank you,
Sonny uh Mr. Chair
Members of the Committee. It's wonderful to
be here with you all today. Uh
Always a pleasure to see all of you.
And I, I do want to thank doctor
ornament uh uh
Mr. Lou for
giving a great
presentation before. In fact, they
went over many of the, the
points that, that, that
I would be talking about this morning.
I May repeat some of those
things, but I don't want to rehash
everything that was talked about.
Uh I was really interested into,
into listening to all of your
conversations and I want to thank you for
all of your comments and your conversation
about how we mov'e forward.
Um And so in some of
those areas, there was some
things that I wrote down that, that I
heard some kind of,
you know, taking some, some things
maybe out of context a bit, but,
but I believe these are
some important quotes.
So this morning, I've already heard,
how do we focus on
what's important? I think
that's an, that, that is a huge
point to make
working together to solve
problems. How do we all
work together to solve these problems?
It is not just any one
of us that can do this work.
It takes the work from my
agency myself,
teachers across New Mexico, our
legislators, parents,
students, everybody has a
part in that. And
so I'm very much looking forward
to continuing this conversation with you
today about where we're at
today and how we mov'e forward
into the future.
I also like the, the comment
around accountability on
both sides and I
want to continue to ask you to hold
me me accountable. Uh
my agency accountable,
but also accountability
for leas and charters.
And I, and I definitely heard some
comments today and
in conversations with many of
you about how there are
things that we can improve
at the public education department
level, but also how we
can improve and become more
efficient um at
the the local levels.
Uh When Mr. Chairman was talking
about uh the
the increases to
uh funding and
uh those cash balances. Those
are things that concern me. Also, I
want those dollars to be able to be spent
on those students now
making sure that we can do everything
necessary to get all the
resources out for students.
And I really love the idea of a think
tank and I, I'm hoping maybe
today is at a time
where we can really maybe and I'm
not saying start it but continue that
conversation around a think
tank and maybe that's a great idea to
be able to kind of formalize that about
how we mov'e forward into the
future. So
just a couple of highlights
in this uh wonderful
uh legis that document
is some things I'm gonna, I'm
gonna celebrate
first. I think we can always start
there is that we are
seeing increases in
reading across New Mexico.
This is going to be two
years in a row where we're seeing
increases in
reading. Uh We're,
we're also seeing uh
really closing
of the gap for some of our most
needy populations, specifically,
our native students, specifically
our high poverty
students, those are, those are good
things to be able to see
and we want to be able to see that trendline
continue. We're also
seeing graduation rates
slowly increase.
This is a good
thing. Uh And
so, and we're also seeing
uh and I'm gonna say this very
preliminarily. So hopefully you don't
quote me on this, but we are seeing
uh drops in our chronic
absenteeism. So doctor
ornament talked about us being at
39% chronic
absenteeism very
preliminarily, we're still working through the
data, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna throw a number
up and I'm hoping it gets even better
as we look at the data, but we're
right around 34 35%
so that we're moving in the
right direction. These are, these are good
things. Uh Representative
Dixon talked about how
this also is uh the long
game that this takes years
to be able to see those types. Uh
see the data where we want to
go. So I'm happy
about the increases.
Um and in other areas
like math and
science and in and
in some of these, as you look over the
trendlines, we're stabilized.
That's also something that we can
be happy about
that. We, we are not getting
worse that we are
making improvements. Now, when we
look at some of the specifics
with grade levels or with some
other of the
breakdowns population,
we do see some declines in some
certain areas. So we want to be able to
recognize that.
But I do want to say even with
those bright spots, even
with some of the stabilization
with some of our data, it's
still not happening fast enough.
And I and I really, we have
students in classrooms right
now that we want to be able
to see be successful
and we want to be able to make sure that they
get to the finish line as
graduates uh in New
Mexico. But at the same
time, have all the skills
necessary to be able to be
successful as they mov'e on.
So some of the questions uh and
some of the comments out there today
have been perfect, but there's
more layers deep in those
questions. And I'm hoping maybe we can
talk a little bit about that
today. Um
And so some other
areas that I, I want to be able to spend
some time since we, I've got you
as a captive audience is
where we're going to be moving into the
future where I would
like to be able to spend
uh some of our time and
resources at the public education
department working with local
leas and we
charters. So
some of those are going to be around. I'm
gonna kind of go through a list of things and
these are things you've heard me talk about in the
past, but our teacher prep
programs, how important
it is to make sure that we
have the bench
ready and filled, to
be able to continue to fill our classrooms
across New Mexico. We
have a number of different programs and
I'm gonna say that they are all very
successful. Um
looking uh looking at the
the positive outcomes from our teacher
prep programs. One
working with all of our hired
institutions across the State of New Mexico,
we are aligning the efforts
of what it means to be able to be
in the teacher prep programs.
So whether you're at Highlands
or at U and M or NM, SS
U or Eastern or Western,
name them all that we have
that same high expectation, what
those course contents are going to be
like. It's also going to be very
helpful for those students that transfer
from school to school, that they
don't skip a beat, they're able to
continue on with their
courses. And then
as we get closer to
uh student teaching
that they, the student
teaching that I was a part of is
very different to what it looks like
today where we're spending much more
time working in student
teaching type of environments,
working with master teachers so that
they are much more prepared
to be able to take over
classrooms. At
the same time making sure that those
students in teacher
prep programs are
getting the science of reading,
which is huge.
I didn't have that when I was going
through my teacher prep program many,
many, many, many years ago.
And uh and now we're starting
to see that happen.
And this is going to make sure,
make, ensure that our teachers are
much more prepared and be
able to not only get hired
but be uh re recruited
but also be retained for many years
in those positions.
I also want to spend some time
around. So we talked
about teachers and
teacher support but
also around the idea of
what teachers need once they in the
classroom. And so
you've also got to hear this morning and you've
also heard me talk many times about
the supports that we have for
teacher professional developments.
And I'm gonna specifically talk about
structured literacy also.
Uh we have been able to
provide structured literacy training
for our kinder 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
4th grade teachers next
year will be our fifth grade. We'll be
able to complete our
elementary uh pool
of teachers, which is amazing.
And as we have teachers coming out
of teacher prep programs as their
first years of teaching. They've
also got that training. So,
and we're also going to take a, a giant
leap forward, making sure that we
train all of our middle school
teachers. So that's going to be 67 and
eight this year. Very excited
about this work and we
start the stair step, we'll continue that
work into high
schools. This is already
showing promise, showing
positive results and this is going
to multiply every single
year.
So we're talking about teacher prep
programs. We've talked about
uh teachers that are in
classrooms and I'm just kind of
touching the surface with all these things.
But next is leadership
and ensuring that
our leaders, whether it be assistant
principals, principals,
superintendents central office
staff have the skills, they
need to be able to really
mov'e their district forward
with everything that we talk
about. All the wonderful initiatives
that are out there. It's really
the the responsibility
and the key that our leaders
are strong leaders and
that can be risk takers to be able to
push us forward and
making sure that we don't, not only
once they get in those positions, we don't
kind of leave them to themselves,
but we actually are supporting them all
the way through. And some
of those can be through Executive
coaching through continued
professional development, allowing
them to continue to always
become better
leaders.
Got some wonderful news around
literacy. I've talked about
uh the the literacy in
structured structured literacy for
training for teachers.
But uh very preliminarily
we're still uh in program
for our summer literacy programs.
Uh Excited to say we have
9533
students that have registered
for the program this year. This is
II I find this
very exciting and
very successful that we were able
to do this. And I want to thank
you all for that for your support around
this. Uh We have over
2775.
I think uh instructors that we,
that, that applied
more than we could even
take. This was a great
problem to have. Uh
we have, we've had uh
programs going on across
the State. We still have a number
of programs happening across the
State. And so, uh
we are also putting out
a questionnaire for parents,
students and instructors
to give us some preliminary information
about how uh the
program went uh very
preliminarily, we're seeing some very
positive comments coming back
that they are recognizing
that students are teaching are, are
learning, they're recognizing
that confidence has increased
and they're recognizing that students
are having a good time in schools.
We're also recognizing that many of
the instructors want to come back another year
to do this again. And many students
want to come back in future years to do
this again. These are all
positive um preliminary
information that we're getting back.
The students also took a pre and
post test. Um And
so, uh hopefully in the next few
weeks, I will be able to share with you the
results of that pre and post test
to attendance. These are
all pieces of information that we want to
be able to use to get even better
as we continue to do this in the
future. We're also looking
at what this is going to look like in the fall
and the spring for maybe possibly
in school program or
out of school time
programs. Um Again,
this, this was more
successful than in
my weest dreams. But at the same time,
there are things that we can do to
improve and make it much more smoother
as we do it, do it. Uh For the
second time around,
uh Representative BCA
talked a lot about
how important it is
to be able to be connected
to uh to your school and
different entities, whether it be
athletics, whether that
be uh band,
whether it be clubs, whether
that be CTE programs,
innovation zone type of
environments, community
schools, we know
that this is key to making sure
that students graduate and are
successful, feel safe in
school. Uh And
we see this with all populations,
with all grad uh grade levels,
both at middle school and high schools.
And we just need to be able to
uh really double down on some
of those efforts. Now, the next
question to ask in there is
that are all students
do the all students in, in
our high schools have the
ability to be able to have access to these
things. We know that
students that do
have much more chance of being
successful, being able to be
more proficient in reading and math
and be able to get across the
finish line with, with, with
uh with high school graduation.
But the truth is not all
students currently
have access to those things.
And so, um how
do we continue to scale
up to make sure that
it's not outliers that we're
talking about that. It's really
the entire population that we're
talking about having uh these
types of resources and these types
of benefits. And that
includes everything I just talked
about with CTE programs,
with athletics, with
program, but also with dual
credit opportunities with uh
bilingual programs. These are
all things that help make
students successful.
And so I would like to, I would love to be able
to have more conversations with you,
but not only how, how do
we make this um
available to some students, but
how do we make sure and ensure that it's
available to all
students? Uh Sunny
talked a little bit about artificial
intelligence. Uh This
is going to be something that you're going to
hear from our agency more and
more. Uh it
is still
relatively in our first
stages of understanding.
It is not a new concept
though we've been uh this has
been um
a part of
of what we are
exposed to for
months and years now, but we see it
moving very, very fast,
I do believe. And my
gut tells me that this is going
to be a huge game changer
to, to public
education and now
and and into the near
future uh where it's
going to have dramatic impacts
on how we
actually provide instruction
for students and actually
how we run operationally schools.
So to give you a couple of examples
is a I will
make it very easy for us to be
able to very
specifically
create an instructional
program for every
student that, that we
have in in New Mexico
schools that we can
really provide very
detailed um
instruction plan for
them. This is going to be
huge, it is not
all about. Uh and some of
it is is the worry that we have
because it's the unknown.
And at the same time
how this helps us instruction. And
on the operational
side,
what that can look like is how we
can really better use our,
our hours
that we use as employees
in this in as as
educators, how we
use time as leaders
in schools. And
I've I've given the example before
about how we create uh
high school master
plans. High school
master plans are very detailed.
They take a very long time to do that.
And in some of our in all of our
high schools, we have, whether we have hundreds of
students or thousands of students.
There are so many little
intricacies to how you
build that master plan.
How many teachers do you have? How many
classes do you have? How do we make
sure this student isn't with this student? How
do we ensure that this teacher is with
this student? There are so many
different uh caveats
to this and it, and it can be very
detailed. What's great about A I
is we can input that data
and within seconds they can,
it can build us a
very high quality
master plan uh for
a high school. This is just
gonna alleviate the number of
hours that we have spending on those, so
we can actually spend those on other
things.
And of course math and
stem. Uh this is
an area that we really kind of
fell flat.
Uh I I am very
worried about uh the
the outcomes for students when it comes
to math and stem
and I would love to be able
to talk with you more about how
we mov'e forward to be able
to see some of the benefits
we've seen with structured literacy. How do we
mov'e that into our math
and stem projects across New
Mexico? Um
Again, we, we kind of
stabilize with things maybe and
this year you're gonna maybe see a slight
decrease. I don't know if it's
statistically significant.
But um you really want to look at that
over time, but it is an area
of concern for me. And it's
something that we need to be able to make sure we
keep at our forefront,
to be able to definitely expand
our Hispanic Education Act
uh where we see where we can
support and put dollars into those
schools. We see benefits
for students uh that are English
language learners. We see students
that are from Hispanic and Latino
backgrounds and students
that are coming from those
soom. So socioeconomic
families um to be able
to expand those efforts is
only gonna make sure that we
are doing more for
students that come from those
populations.
Another area that I, I believe
going to Mr.
>> Secretary and
I know we have a number of folks who are
excited to dig in and ask
questions. So
really appreciate you,
but just wanted to highlight that we'll
have a number of questions.
>> Thank you, sir. I'll make one more
point and then we'll mov'e to questions. I I'm
looking forward to that too. I'm
very excited about the
summer internship and work based
learning programs. We've
seen this really wrap up over the
last couple of years,
especially this year now. Uh
some wonderful examples. I was
just out in Clovis portalis got
to meet with a few
dozen students. Very excited
about that, seeing what's going on in Dona
County. Very, very
exciting. I think this is
also a time to be able to double down on
that because if we can get students
involved in work based
learning and summer internship
programs that's also going to help
support them with graduations.
So with that Mr. Chair, thank you for
that. Uh these are just some
areas that to give some
highlights on where we're at with the
data and some areas that
we want to be able to focus on moving
into this next Session. And
so with that, I'm looking forward to getting
into a conversation with all, all of
you. >> Excellent, Mr. Secretary.
Thank you so much. Uh We
really appreciate you, we appreciate
very much your team who is here with
you. Uh Mr.
Lou, thank you very much,
Mr. Secretary. I want to start off with
a couple of things and then we'll
go quickly. Well, we'll
go to our Members and obviously
take the time that they need.
Uh First Mr. Secretary
you mentioned and I see
here in our brief uh
where we
are seeing reading
proficiency begin
to rise,
um talk
us through a little bit more what
you attribute the
the sort of the
some of those increases
to please.
>> Uh Thank you for that question. Uh
Absolutely.
What I would uh number one
put that attribute some of
those gains is that we are
seeing consistency
across the State of New Mexico. When it comes to
structured literacy. Again,
we've been able to uh now uh
train all of our
uh kinder to fourth
grade teachers. We'll be doing
fifth grade this next year and we're going to take a
leap forward with our middle school.
Uh because of that consistency,
students are getting
that every single year,
that same type of expectation.
Again, we're also working with
our uh Preser teachers
to make sure that they get trained. And
this is what we did all summer long.
We had
9533
students be able to be exposed
to structured literacy, uh
very detailed
stuck to that and
we're going to see wonderful benefits coming
out of that. We just need to stick to the plan.
>> Excellent. Thank you Secretary.
That's really exciting
and remind me this is
sort of we're two
years into this, would you
say, would you say or
how many, how long
into the structure into
this?
How long has that consistency
been there? Let me ask you
that. So,
yeah, how long has that
consistency been there? What you
say? >> Yes, Mr.
Chair. Yes. So we've actually
been doing this for
a few years now. We really
stairs stepped, starting with Kinder
1st, 2nd, 3rd. Now we're
at fourth grade, we just finished out fourth
grade. And so uh
so the stair stepping is great
because we can really focus on grade
levels. Uh Now we're at the
point where now as we're as finish
off elementary. We want to be able to kind of
take some giant leaps forward
with some other, uh, you know, with
middle school and then high school.
And so again, it's been a three
or 45 years that we've been doing
it and we've got, again, keep the
course. >> Thank you. And that's
my sort of within the
legislative process that, uh,
thank you for that
because sort of what
can we expect knowing
that now, maybe we're able
to hopefully
uh speed up the progress.
So we're seeing progress,
we'd like to speed it up to
sort of make larger
leaps coming
out of the summer literacy.
And again, kudos to you
to the department of the team
for implementing that.
It's great that obviously that was a
priority for us funding
it. Um
What would sort of your hope
be in as,
as we sort of turn the
corner and say
maybe January
of of
2025
you know, kiddos are back in
class, you know,
9500 plus of
them coming in from
this summer.
What can we
hope for continued? Well, we
should we demand
continued progress, what should
we aim for in terms
of uh sort
of a year from now? Six months
from now? Improvement that
rate of improvement. >> Yes,
thank you Mr. Chair. So
again, yes, we have been able to
see some consistent gains last
year. We had 4% gains. It looks like
we're hovering right around
maybe 4 to 5%
gains this year depending on the grade
level. Uh, those
are, that's good, statistically, those
are good increases,
but it's not fast enough. I
believe that we need to mov'e forward. I think
we can mov'e forward and it's just
kind of like the, the stock market.
Now, we can really rely on
compound interest in a
way is, is the way I can describe
it is because students have been
able to get this year after year after
year. Uh The, the
goal would be that we see uh
more dramatic changes and
increases happening. >> And
let me and I so
um not
holding you to this but wanting
to go through the dialogue again
in that legis that format,
should we begin to
aim for
5% gains,
sort of as that uh
aggressive but
realistic baseline
and then shoot
for gains on
top of that.
>> I, I believe
that we should be in double digit
gains every single year, at
least at least in
the first few years. And
as we get higher, it gets harder to do
that. But I, I believe it is
absolutely possible to do
that. >> Uh Thank
you that that's super helpful.
And then the one last area
um for me
is uh
well, and I'm sure other
Members will go more deeply into
English language learners.
But I did note that that was
an area you've highlighted
with some progress.
Do you sort of attribute
some of that to
um you know, the
better teacher prep
uh sort of
teachers, particularly
teachers who reflect their
communities coming
online, any
sort of initial
sense there
>> so very quickly. Uh
yes, it's, it's having
the support at the, at the
prete Preser level,
making sure that we have common
instructional materials across
they have common uh professional
development. Now, the area that
we really are looking at now
is even though that we have
trained thousands of
teachers across New Mexico, we
have great examples where it's happening
in the classrooms. But we also
have examples where it really hasn't
made the change in the classroom and we
can measure that. And this is
really telling us that we also need
to be able to train principals
superintendents, maybe even school
board Members to make sure that it is
part of what they do. They all
believe in it, they all align
to those efforts. >> Thank
you for that. And maybe that, you know, that
was one of the as Mr. Lou
lined out and, and really
kudos, Mr. Lou, I think
helping us push uh
more
uh push further
into the whys and how
to tease stuff out.
Um That was one of the action
steps around leadership
perhaps Mr. Lou, we need to
think about how
sort of that leadership and
consistency is expanded
into something
uh that we continue
forward in the legislative.
Uh Next, we're going to go to
uh Representative Garcia,
then we'll have Representative Dixon
um Chair
Romeo and a number of others,
representative and Representative Armstrong
for sure. >> Uh Back
in
the
question
the
OK.
OK.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman Mr.
Secretary. I'm gonna ask you the hardest question
that anybody's ever asked. You.
Probably.
What, why are we
last in education in the State
of New Mexico?
>> I think that's a wonderful
question. Uh
My answer to that would be
is we are perfectly set up
with the systems that we have in place to,
to get the results that we're getting.
If we want to be able to make improvements,
we have to make changes and
sometimes those changes are gonna
not pay off, but many times
those changes are going to pay off.
Um I think many of the conversation,
much of the conversation we have today
is how can the agency
Public Education Department
be held accountable
to make sure that we uh
encourage those positive
changes? But also that work
has to be done at the local le A level.
Also, we're all part of the
solution. So, uh the
reason we're in 50th place is because we
are perfectly set up with the
processes we have in place to be able
to be there.
>> Thank you for that answer.
Uh Mr.
Chairman, uh
Mr. Secretary, the Chairman
asked you a question about proficiency
on reading on, on
page two
on page two of the first with a paragraph
on top it says proficiency
rating
pre preliminary, preliminary
reading proficiency rates
are predicted
to be 38%
for all students flat with a prior
year. How are we improving
if they're gonna be flat again with
the prior year at 38%?
And why such a low number at
38%?
>> Uh Thank you for that question,
Miss Representative. Yes, I,
I agree. We are not moving fast
enough and we are not doing
everything we can to be able
to ensure that we're getting better
proficiency rates and outcomes for
students. Uh We do have
some wonderful examples across
New Mexico. How can we
learn from those examples at, at
certain schools, certain classrooms
and make sure that we share that out
across the, across the
State. So this gets to the
next question is, how do
we kind of balance
out what we know
works at a research
level and also,
you know, ensure that we also uh
respect local decision
making and those things
don't always line up
perfectly. How do we, how do
we do both? And um I
think there is a path forward to
that and that's really around
ensuring that leadership is
well-trained, has professional
development, ensuring that
teachers and uh classrooms
have the tools and the professional
development to mov'e forward
and really allow for us to be
able to be risk takers um
to be able to get to where we need to
be.
>> I thank you for that, you know, on
on page
four.
It says, uh since
2021 P ad has
participated in three
legislate hearings
and taken steps
towards addressing
uh issue discussed with
LFC. You know, and I'm
looking at the, the deal
here,
there has been not much done, you
know, you will have
one complete uh
six
uncompleted.
I mean, you got one to complete
it two more
action and for the
six and
process what, what
is the process since
21 to now? And
we're still in the same
spot,
>> Mr. Representative? Yes,
thank you for that.
You're right. I think in the
last few years, uh there
has not been as much movement
that as there should be.
Um And I think there's a lot of
people that can be or not, maybe
people but entities that can be held
responsible for that. I
do feel in the, the time
I've been able to be here, it
was uh top of
my mind that we had to
mov'e fast. Uh I
was already worried on day one
that uh I was already running out of
time. Uh Again,
I think we have in so many
ways, had great improvements
within the public education
department. Uh And some of
these I talked, I look here is we've
been able to fully
implement an accountability
system that had been in place.
We've really been able to
support uh structure
literacy across all,
all districts in New Mexico.
Uh We've really been able to
work on really, you know,
massively reducing the supports
we have when it comes to the
finances when it comes to
RFRS, we're down
to 26 days, um,
averaging for RF RSI
was looking yesterday, we only have
six in the State that we, that
are outstanding.
Um, in my
entire career, I've never seen it
like this. We're down
to, uh, under 13%
vacancy rates in, within the
agency. These are all gonna
have multiplying positive effects
on outcomes for students. We're
not done. And, uh,
and, uh, so the work will
continue.
>> Thank you for that, Mr.
Secretary and Mr. Chairman,
you know,
I'm not sitting here putting the blame
on you because you've fairly
new at it. But you know,
there's been six or
seven secretaries
and everybody passes the buck to the
next Secretary and,
but, you know, we need to stop doing
that because at the end of the day,
what we're hurting is our
kids.
Another question,
Mr. Secretary, we had
conversation and
uh and Carlsbad
about uh
absenteeism
and it stated there that
the pe D
had the tools to
help
districts
address this problem. Have
you reached out to any
districts in the last
month? And I know it's only
30 days, but that's the question
that have
you.
>> Yes, representative. Um
And so last year, there
was an allocation for to
work with chronic absenteeism.
It was a $5 million
allocation. Uh We had
to make kind of a decision, do we,
how do we support that across
the State? Which can kind of get
watered down $5
million over 89 school
districts, 100 charters or can
we target some areas?
And uh and we made the
decision to be able to tar target certain
districts. Uh We did
see some really good growth
uh or, or decline
in chronic absenteeism in those
districts that we worked with, I believe there was
seven of them. And so that
really gave us some baseline data
as to how we mov'e forward.
Uh We want to be able to continue that
work into this next year.
Uh One of the things I really
want to focus on is with Albuquerque
public schools. I really
excited about having superintendent
Blakey there. Uh her
and I have been really kind of
brainstorming many
issues. One of them is
chronic absenteeism. So,
so the question is, have I been
able to talk with anybody in the
last few days or weeks?
I'm an ongoing conversation is
really now with Super
Blakey about how we can make
some dramatic improvements
with, with this area
with Albuquerque public
schools.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman Mr.
Secretary. You know, not
only uh Albuquerque public
school has problems.
Absolutely. You know, the whole,
the whole State and then the problem,
you know, and you mentioned
Albuquerque public schools,
you know, how about grants public
schools or, or
where Mr. Chatfield
that they, they're having the
same problem. We are everybody
else, you know, and we need
to address those for
everybody not just the
public schools.
Uh
would you, would it be a fair
assumption to say that
respect starts
at home, Mr.
Secretary? >> Oh, absolutely.
Again, Mr.
Representative, this
is something that we're all
responsible for whether we are
a teacher, a principal, a
Secretary of Education, a
legislator also
as parents. It, it
definitely has uh
if we have
a good home environment,
good uh environment
where students have access to
libraries and parks
and resources, this all
has a positive impact on students.
Absolutely,
>> Mr. Chairman and Mr.
Secretary, the reason I asked that
question was
if respect starts at
home, education
starts on the
top,
starting with the Secretary of
PE D
that it trickles down to
everybody else superintendent.
And what we're
doing, I think is our
teachers have too much on their
plate. We got too many
rules and regulations
regulating them on how
to do it and not letting them
teach students
the right way, you know, because
they got, they gotta do this,
you gotta do proficiency this
proficiency that and at
the end of the day, they're
not allowed to
do teaching like
they should be, those are
issues that we need to address.
And that starts
with you Mr.
Secretary,
you know, because I, I talked to a
teacher in my district and say, you know what,
we have a lot on our plate, you
know, and
then it comes down to uh Mr.
Secretary, Mr. Chairman.
Uh we have to buy our own pencils
that we don't have enough uh
material to work with. Those
are issues that are there. They're
real and you know, I
don't know if we're turning a blind
eye to it and
not addressing it, but we really
need to look at those issues.
And like I said, respect
starts at home, education
starts at the top
with you. So we
really need to look at that,
that Mr. Chairman. I
also are just comments I had to say
thank you for your time. Thank
you, Mr. Secretary and not
necessarily picking on
you because you
know, when you came
in, there was already bad and
it's still bad, but we need to
fix it. Thank you. Thank
you. >> Thank
you. Uh Turn back to Chairman
Munoz. I know uh
Representative
Dixon and then Representative
Romero.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um Thank you. I
enjoy um the
legis stats
um because they
really, I think do provide
an opportunity to dive a little
deeper into some of these
um the two areas
that I was interested
in talking about
um have come up
several times both
earlier this morning and
um on other occasions.
So first is
math initiatives and
then second,
um I'd like to talk about
graduation rates
at the district level.
Um And Mr.
Chair Secretary
for the Math Initiatives,
I am curious
um you know, are
there what are the discussions
currently
about how
we improve our math
scores? You know
from the youngest kids
up and what, what are
you talking about at the
administration?
>> Mr. Chair representative?
Absolutely. This is top of
mind for me, how we
uh really need to turn the corner
to start seeing increases. We're really
not seeing that when it comes to
math. Uh really what
we're looking at right now, the
conversations we're having
is what have we done in reading the literacy
and we're seeing some gains in that. So how
can we create uh really
an idea of a of
a very structured math
plan uh for
students across New Mexico
now, it doesn't
really uh equal
the same thing like we, we there is,
there are definitely structured
literacy programs out there that are
developed that we've been able to really kind
of steal and, and implement
what we're looking at now is having to
design our own math structured
kind of math idea around that. So
we're doing that work now.
Uh again though, uh I
am a, I'm a little worried about
how we mov'e into the future. It
was not funded uh
where um
where it needs to be. And
so that would be an area that I, I really
be looking to all of you to help
support as we mov'e into the
future with
grad rates. Uh
Again,
uh this, this
Committee has challenged me many times to be
able to increase uh graduation
rates. We're starting to see
some improvements. But again, I am
not happy with
the, the, the, the growth in
those improvements. It needs to be a whole
lot faster. But I think
there's some other questions that we need to ask.
Also. We've got some great,
uh, districts out there that
have 90
9500%
graduation rates. And that's,
that's wonderful. I don't want to take
anything away from that. But at the
same time we have to ask the next question
is, are those students that are
graduating? Do they have
the skills they need to be able to be
successful? And that
includes uh reading and math.
Uh We have a high percentage of
students that are going on to Univ
two and fouryear program universities
are have to take remedial areas
in those things. Uh Same thing
when they go on to the workforce where
uh employers are having to support
them to make sure that they have the skills that they
need. So again,
we need to continue to make sure that we
increase graduation rates, but make sure that
they have the skills after they graduate.
>> Um Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you
Secretary. I want to
talk a little bit more about the math
initiatives. Um
So when we're talking
about keeping students
engaged, um one of the
things I remember hearing
um when I was visiting with some
of the building trades um
is construction math
and how that can actually be
more effective for
some students because
when's the last time you used
algebra two in your real life.
And if you know, maybe you're
not going to go to colledge and so you don't
need algebra two. But
you know, if you go into the
trades construction math
is far more, far more helpful.
Are we looking at
programs like
that? >> Uh
Mr. Chair represent? Absolutely.
And, and I want to thank uh Representative
Romero. We, we did some really wonderful
work in all of you around
updating the graduation uh
requirements. And this is going to
allow uh for those
types of environments to take
place where they have much more
options and flexibility
to be able to do that. So,
yes, uh districts are
using, taking advantage of that.
We're going to start to see this first cohort
of freshmen come in to take
advantage of our new graduation
requirements and over the next few
years, we'll be able to measure those
outcomes. >> Thank you,
Mr. Chair. Thank you, Secretary.
Um in that same
vein, what are the
efforts um that
pe D, what
collaboration do you have
with higher ed? Um as
we look at specific industries
that are target industries for New
Mexico. So, you know, if
it's aerospace or Biosciences
and how the math
um and sort of
uh future workforce
needs align with
industries.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
representative. Yes, absolutely.
And I, I would say that at the higher
level, uh they are
also working with
industry and businesses
across New Mexico to really
uh get information on what
who they need to be able to, to be
the next set of employers that
includes ensuring that we have
construction math. We
have a financial literacy
uh that we have opportunities
when it's, it's specifically around the oil
and gas industry. We're
getting feedback from all the industries
to help us make some adjustments
to what we're doing. Not only at the highered
level, but ensure that we provide
those classes at the high school
levels. >> Thank
you. Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you Secretary. Um
and then just push in a little
bit more on the graduation rates.
Um I'm interested
if you know, if we sort of
know um
you know, to the, to the
figure how many
more students we need to
graduate to get to the national
average. And we kind
of know that information
district by district, are
there specific, are you guys
working directly with
districts to
say, you know, if
you graduate
13 more students, you're
gonna hit the natural national
average and what are you doing to get
there? >> Yes,
thank you, Mr. Chair
representative. We are having
those conversations with districts
about uh what, what
are their current graduation rates?
Uh where do they need to be to get to
that, that national average?
And then what kind of supports can
they can do? We need to be able to help
support them with, to be able to do that
but not only working with
individual districts
but also working with districts as
cohorts so that we can learn
from each other. And that's been very
beneficial. We've
also reached out to some external
partners that they are working very
closely with specific
districts. So all these are
having positive impacts.
I think my wish would be
how do we scale that up so we can
reach even more.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you, Secretary and Mr. Lieu
Representative
Romeo.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr.
Secretary.
So um
I, I just have one question
and, and then a bit of a comment
that um you
had sent out a letter to
school districts, I believe
um stating that
um the upcoming budget
proposal from the department
would focus on accountability
for districts. Um I
was wondering if you could go into
some of the specifics on,
on what you mean by that?
>> Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative. Uh
Much of that I think is very
uh aligned with the conversation that
we, that we've been having this morning
around ensuring that the
dollars that are going
out to school districts through
seg and through certain
grant programs are
being spent uh how it's
intended. And
uh I, I do want to say that, you know,
for a very long time, I was a superintendent.
I was a principal and
all of my colleagues across
New Mexico. I I know that
they all have the greatest
intents for
uh for the outcomes of students and how these
dollars are coming in. The
problem sometimes is, is
that they need support and
how they actually are able to
measure whether those dollars
had that impact. Did those dollars
actually get spent where they intended it
to? And sometimes we
are, are too, too high
level with how we're
budgeting. So, uh so
some of that accountability
conversation is how can we come
in and partner with
uh with uh local education
agencies to help them?
Now measure, did
they actually uh get the
outcomes that they wanted?
Did those dollars actually get
spent where they were, where they were meant to
be? And so some of those examples
are uh around
special education, I can start with
that. Um you know, many
times as they
budget, the intent is to
be able to spend dollars on special
education classrooms. But
then we kind of look at it after
the fact and we kind of autopsy
how that was done and
very rarely do we actually
are they actually getting what they
thought was happening. So we
want to be able to help them with either
implementing procedure
or how they budget or how they
measure. Um And,
and actually in some way,
maybe the audit is the, is the word
I want to use, but that's kind of
impersonal. It's really kind of
a personalized conversation about how
we can go in and have those conversations
with them about where the dollar spent
and did they get the outcomes that they
wanted? And that's what I mean about some
of the accountability
conversations
>> and Mr. Chairman that seems
like on behalf
of the school districts, that it would be
a little bit of goal setting
for each
budgetary item. Is that something
you all are working with them
currently on with
this um
accountability mechanism?
Um a little bit farther down the
road, >> Mr.
Chair Representative. Absolutely. So that's
definitely part of the conversation
about how they can create
goals for their
budget. Many districts don't
have strategic plans. We want to be
able to work with those that don't to
help them get to that.
Um You know, just also
ensuring that uh they,
they have the tools necessary to,
to get the outcomes that
they're, that they're hoping for
um many times
again. Um I'll,
I've said this before. You've heard me say this
before. I don't believe it's
the ill intent of
any uh superintendent
or principal to not do
those things. Many of them
have not been in the seat
long enough to be able to
recognize that that much of that needs
to be done. And so we're doing a
lot of that work now to ensure that
these superintendents that these principals
can be successful, that they can
be in those seats for a long time,
but also have those tools necessary,
those goals, setting uh
opportunities available and
create those strategic
plans.
>> Mr. Chairman and Mr. Secretary, I
appreciate that answer. And that's
something I look forward to, to
obviously talking a little bit more
on. Um I will say
Mr. Chairman that um
there was some conversation amongst the
Committee about um
math and mash math
initiatives as well as
STEM and
next week
pending the the
special Session. But at
our LES C
meeting in Los Alamos, we're going to be
delving into
math
initiatives and what
the viability of
a stem stem initiative
would be in the State.
So if you're interested, we would love to
have your participation as
well in that. But thank you, Mr.
Chairman. >> Thank
you. Thank you
representative.
>> Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank
you again for the presentation.
Um So,
you know, from what I understand
this whole the legis that process
is so that we can, we can
set some goals and get some
information and then
come back and rel look and see what
kind of things have been implemented.
Is, is that correct Sonny?
Yes,
>> Mr. Chair representative. That
is the >> goal. Yes.
Thank you. That's, that's what
I thought the
goal was. So I'm
I'm looking at the,
the status, the
legis status
and the the
action step, the
status and then the
comments and one of
them, the first
one is the reinstates
statewide testing
by
2122
school year and there's a green
checkmark. And so
I was curious to
know
that all that looks
golden and, and you get
a gold star, but are we
getting those tests back
quickly? And
are, are the schools
getting them quickly
and do, does
the legislature
get them quickly?
>> Thank you for that,
Mr. Chair Representative.
So I'm going to describe
the cycle of how things
work. There are kind of
two pieces to, to,
to the assessments.
Uh Typically the assessments
are given in April May.
Um and our goal is to be
able to get out the student reports
before the students leave for
the for the year so that uh
both parents,
students and schools can help
make decisions on in individual
kids. We've been able to meet that goal
over the last two years. So those, so
the first step is getting those student
reports back to school. So those
are with schools right now.
The second step is the accountability
piece. And so that
uh requires that
we are able to get
back uh certain pieces of
information from school districts
across New Mexico. So we can set
that. Now do the
accountability measures
typically that, that
takes a couple of months to do that
to be able to work back and forth with
all 89 school districts
and with uh you know, 100
charters or so. So
an example of that would
be ensuring that we have
accurate data when it comes to
enrollment, uh many
students May start school at
one school and then we go to another
school. So we have to be able to
uh really finalize that
data. And that helps us with the
accountability plan. Once
we get all that data, usually
right around August 1st, then we
start the accountability process
that takes us four or five weeks to be
able to do that. And that's why our
goal now this last
year, uh we didn't get it
out till November this year. We're
looking at having it right around September
1st and I want to be able to back
that up to about August 15th.
So the the things that we have to kind
of measure if we want it before that, then
that means that the whole system needs to
mov'e up. And so it's
just, it's just a matter of what
do we want to do? Do you want to test
earlier? So we get the data back
earlier or do we want to test later,
but it May mean that we don't get it back
till after the first day of school for
the next year. >> Ok.
Thank you for that. I just want to make
sure that if we're, if we're
doing a statewide test, let's
make sure we're use being
we're able to use the data
to the best of our knowledge for
the schools and for the
legis stat report.
Um, the next one
is increasing participation
in K five plus and extended
learning time.
That's an action
step. It's the
legislature made it very clear
that we did not want that a
mandate. Schools
have the,
the authority to,
to buy into that.
And so I'm
curious,
what is the measurement
of how many schools
participate in that?
I mean, we're, we're at a
yellow on that.
So is our goal to have
green, which means all schools
participating or what, what are the
guidelines to that?
>> Um Mr. Chair representative, let
me speak real quickly and I'll turn it
over to sunny.
Um So
I, I agree. II I, that is
definitely the the choice
of local education
agencies to be able to do that.
Uh We have seen increases
in numbers of doing that over the last few
years. Um I have seen
that and personally been able to
witness how that has had
a positive impact on student
outcomes. Uh But again, let
me turn it over to Sony to see what the
original intent
was
>> um Mr.
Chair and representative,
thanks for reading
the document. I think
that
the,
what we're trying to reflect here
is that this was in 2021
under Secretary Kurt
Steinhaus. And it's something that
the Secretary had
committed to uh at
that legis that
process. And
if you think about the presentation,
we just had
about
the court case and how the
court said you needed to provide
access to these extended
learning opportunities to your
at risk kids because it's one
way to get toward
improved outcomes.
Um I think the
conversation has evolved
from 2021
and, and I think that the
problem statement is still the
same, you know, how do we improve
student outcomes?
Um And one way
May be in some
cases to provide
more learning time for those at
risk kids.
But
as part of this sort of new
legis that process, we as
an as, as a Committee
and even with the Executive
haven't come to affirm
yes, this is the direction
we went ahead and
yes, this is how we get to
green. Um So
I think that as you mov'e
into a
future legis sta
there should be a commitment
to what is the measure that we
want, what is, what, what is
the thing that we care about
that is going to get us to that true
north of better student
outcomes.
And how do we make
sure that we get
both the Executive and our
schools
to a place where they're improving
student outcomes and we can attribute
it to these steps in
this process.
>> Thank you so much, Mr.
Chairman and thank you Sonny for that.
I, I was just curious,
I understand that it was
when Kurt Steinhaus. So
then the next one is
uh
Doctor Omero. Do we, do you
think we need to amend
the Attendance for
Success Act? And
if so, do you have
something in the process
um or
lined out so
that we can, I, I
know we're holding our schools
accountable.
Um But how are
we gonna, how are we gonna get
there? Do you have a plan,
>> Mr. Chair Representative?
Uh III, I
believe that that's always gonna
be an evolving
conversation and,
and uh what that's gonna look
like. I know that there's been
conversation about uh the
changes that have been made recently
with the uh Attendance
Act and uh
and maybe some needs for, for
change. I know that I
am working closely with uh
legislative education study
Committee. Doctor ornament. That's something that
we are working on together.
Um I would be open to any
suggestions that are out there so that we can
add that to the conversation.
Uh But again, no, I don't,
I don't believe that it's
a perfect
uh system
and it, it does require
constant evolution.
>> OK. Thank you for that. I just saw
that, you know, amend
the student for or the
Attendance for Success Act.
Um, Mr.
Chairman and
Doctor Mero, I, I forgot
to thank you again.
Uh, and my apologies for riding
the school bus in Kathryn County.
Um, I think it was,
uh, probably
you sort of thought that that's
what it might be about, but meeting
at 6 a.m. at the Eagle
Guest, uh, in
Dattel, New Mexico and then riding
the school bus changing buses,
dodging deer, dodging,
dodging, even antelope.
Um And then
you notice the map in the su
superintendent's office
where the bus stop
was just the be was
almost the end of the
journey where the beginning of
the journey started
from
some places in Arizona
where the kids bus
to or drive in
to to meet the bus.
And so, um,
once again, I see
on here, an action
step, expand
pe D's authority to
hold schools accountable for
results. And in the
comments, I see pe
D's performance
based 180
day rule.
Um And so
can you tell me this is the
first time I, I didn't,
I've never seen the 180
day rule, any
explanation for the
180 day rule?
And so I see that here
and I'm wondering,
did this start in 2022?
And we, I just missed
it or where did that
come from? >> Mr.
Chair? Representative, first of all,
I had a great time with you on
the bus. And II, I would love to ride
the bus with you anytime. So we'll do that
again. Um
So to my not, no,
I, I am not sure why this is
on the,
uh, uh, you know, May
1920 22
legis that I don't know if you want to
speak to that at all.
>> Certainly, I, once again,
this was under a
previous Secretary
where the
ask was to
help define what the
authority of the public education
department was going to
be. And the
comment is that if
you know, you have one court
from Martinez Yazzie
saying PD,
you've read your authority too
narrowly, you need to tell
schools how to spend their
funding. And then you have a
different court
saying,
you know, there are limitations
to what type of
authority and where you're
overstepping. And
so this
conversation is sending a lot
of mixed messages on
where that authority lies. And
hopefully we get more clarity
on,
you know, what direction the department
has and, and what
authority they do have to
promulgate rule
particularly as
they're trying to do something
like expanding the school
year,
>> Mr. Chair and Representative, if I could add
just really quickly.
Um
One thing that I've noticed out of the
conversation we've had over the last year
is that uh we've
had a number of schools actually increase
instructional time and days even to
this next year. And I'm excited about
that. The reason I'm excited
about that is that, you know, again, I've done this
for a long time and I, I do
know that when we
provide more opportunity,
more uh days for students,
it does have a bene a benefit to
that. Uh I want to go to a
comment that representative uh
baca made is that
we should be looking at better
and not more. I would argue
that we need to do
better and more
and that's gonna, and so, but
I'd be all for better
if we can do better
across the State. I, I would
love that. Uh But
I'd also argue that we need a little bit of
both. And the reason I say
that is I kind of, I, I speak from
experience that both those
things have that good outcomes
for students. So,
uh again, I, I will be
continuing to, to fight
for better. And I'm also
gonna be fighting for more.
And that just doesn't mean uh
the traditional sit
down in your classroom in front of your
teacher uh that we can
be able to really expand with
the definition of learning
is especially in
some of your communities that I, that II I
can really think will relate
to this around 4h
around uh culture uh
rle uh type
of opportunities. These are all
learning opportunities that we, if we
can just think a little bit differently,
we can actually uh
really organize this to
be learning instructional
time. >> Thank you
for that. And thank you for the explanation.
Sunny and, and uh Doctor
Romero, I am uh once
again, you know,
uh
even with 100 and 80
day uh
rule,
it's not more learning hours.
And a lot of people don't understand
that we're not expanding the hours,
we're just expanding the days
and when Children in
my community and
others ride the
bus for
over an hour,
possibly two hours.
One
way,
this is an issue. And
so blanket
Legislation for all
schools not taking into
consideration
the individuality
of every school
is I have a
problem with it. I will always have
a problem with it and I will always
fight it, tooth and nail
because
local control,
I understand we've got
to do better. We've got to
do more, but we also have
to do different
because what we've been doing is
not working. And II
I think everyone here
in the State of New Mexico would agree
with that. And
so, but,
but just blanket
mandates is not
gonna work. Um
And, and you,
everyone will hit a brick wall
with me as far
as trying to
mandate anything
and take away local control.
But thank you for your work. Thank you
for continuing to try
to, to make a difference and make
a change, do better,
more and different.
And uh
but I'm still going to argue with you
the whole way. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you. >> Next,
we're going to go to Representative Jaramillo
then represent
Baca.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for being here,
Secretary and Sunny.
Um So
when we're talking about local
control and
um what are the plans
to train school
boards on uh
summer literacy and
the importance of these? You also
talked about budgetary
requirements and training
superintendents and principals
on how to track
budget spend uh
budget appropriately
knowing that that that
really is on the
oversight of the school
board. And
uh and wondering what the
idea is to train school
boards in
that
>> Mr. Chair representative, thank
you for that. Uh This is really
something that's kind of near and dear to my
heart. It's something that I think
has a trem tremendous
positive impact when it comes to outcomes
for students. Uh We were
able to uh last Session
and thank you for this start
to make some adjustments to uh
what school boards are responsible
for. Uh I've been able
to have some wonderful conversations
both with LFC and LES C
staff about the next step
to that. And I, I know that
you're gonna be hearing more and more about
what that May look like as we get closer to the
Session. Um
And so just very
quickly, uh we want
to be able to really start to
expand the
experiences that school boards
have. Uh right
now, they, they are exposed to some,
some, some really great uh
professional development. Uh
Really what the roles are as
board Members, uh legal
changes, um how to be
able to create budgets and what
the role is in that. But there
is so much more to that when
we think about the conversations we've
had today just around structured literacy.
It is so vitally important
that school board Members are
just as knowledgeable about why this
is important because dollars
are attached to that. And
if we can get the support of school board
Members, uh then it just
make, it ensures that it is
throughout the entire school district. So
that's an example of that.
So uh some so
preliminarily, some of the ideas
we have is we want to be able to
expand opportunities for school
board Members across the State of New
Mexico to be able to really
get some of that uh
instructional and
educational professional
development. We're looking at
uh maybe even having
statewide uh conferences
for that. Uh We're also
looking at maybe possibly breaking
up the State into quadrants so that
we can go into communities
and work with school
boards in regions
specific to their, you
know, unique needs and be able to
be supportive in that way. And
then also, you know, for many years,
we've been able to work with cohorts of
teachers, cohorts
of principals.
This last year we started cohorts
of superintendents. We also want to
create cohorts
uh of school board
Members so that they can also learn
from each other. We would love
school board Members to be able to visit other
school districts and other environments
to start to steal ideas and that's
what we do in education.
So these are some of the the new
ideas we have moving in
really uh again, this
last Session, really
increasing the
requirements for what they have to do
when it comes to hours for training.
And now we want to be able to go on
to the next level with that
with uh superintendents
though, uh again, very
similar idea. Uh
We've been doing this work with
principals, uh and teachers
for a number of years. And we're
able to bring these people together
and really support them in their unique
environments. We can kind of take them out
of their district for a while and
really focus on, on uh
on some goals.
We've seen some tremendous outcomes with
that. We started
last year with our first cohort, I'm
sorry, two years ago, with our first
cohort of superintendents,
they did a twoyear program.
Um And again,
we, we, we were
able to pull data back from that, that
one, they very much
valued the, the opportunity
they were able to continue
continuously get Executive
coaching throughout the entire process.
They were able to learn from each other and
really create those networks of systems
between superintendents.
And now this next, we're gonna be starting
our second cohort. Uh
Again, uh
Some of what you May be
hearing from me in, in
funding is to be able to scale
that up so that we can do more
instead of a cohort of just
maybe a half a dozen
superintendents. How do we work
with more superintendents? And
then again, with the school boards, how do
we do that? And, and try to scale
that up very quickly.
>> Uh Thank you and Mr.
Chairman and thank you,
Mr. Secretary for, for
addressing that. I think it's vital
if, if we need to get everybody on
board when we're educating
our, our students.
Um Another question I
have is um
the Indian Ed Division
of PE D. And
what are you doing to address the proficient
proficiency and
achievement rates
for Native American students?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair representative.
I, I believe this is also
an area that we can celebrate.
Uh There's been some wonderful uh
positive outcomes for native
students across New Mexico.
Uh Katieann
Juanico is our assistant
Secretary for uh
for Indian Instruction.
Uh I have, I have learned
so much and I, I very much
value the relationships I have with our
tribes nations and Pueblos
being able to come in and do
consultations with each of
those tribes nations. And Pueblos
really getting to know tribal
leadership, both governors
and presidents. And it has
been invaluable to me as we
are ensuring that every
conversation we have. What
does that mean for our native students across
New Mexico? So again,
we are, we are seeing
uh higher gains
in reading higher
gains in, in graduation
rates. Um The work
is not done, we still need to be able to
do more but also
working with these local communities
ensuring that we are listening to
them about how we they can
spend their dollars on what, what they feel
they need to be able to spend them
and, and actually supporting them with
ideas that maybe they hadn't thought of before
too. And then also sharing
what one tribe is doing with
another Pueblo and and vice versa.
So they can share ideas also.
So again, II I feel
very good about the relationship that we
have with our tribes nations and Polos.
Now, uh A lot of work
is still to be done and in fact,
we are starting to have
conversations between
all education agencies
about what our next steps are
in working in those
communities.
>> Thank you for that. And one last
question, Mr. Chair,
when we look at the summer literacy
program and
uh communities that participated
in it and, and those that
chose not to um
will we see a report
on, on the communities
that did uh or
perhaps didn't and
um and then that growth
uh next year,
>> Mr. Chair Representative. Absolutely.
Yes, I would say, uh, maybe
another month or so. We'll be
able to give you a more detailed
report about outcomes for
students when it comes
to the pre and post test, uh, what
their attendance look like. Uh,
definitely be able to share
with you, uh, where, where
we had and, and where
we didn't, um,
all those things would be part of that report
and if there's anything else that any of you
would like to be able to see now
is the time we can try to make those
requests happen in that final
report. >> Thank
you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you. We'll need a
typewriter and some paper.
Here you go. Uh We
got about 15 minutes left cause
we're gonna end on time. Senator
Representative Baca and then
Senator Woods and we'll see where we're
at.
>> Yeah. >> There you go. I think
we got it now. So thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Um I'm
gonna hold myself to five minutes. I
could go on forever.
So serve five minutes. You can
gabble
me.
Um
I'm also gonna double down, I'm gonna
say that if you create a think
tank, I'll be
there, but
I'll only be there if our districts
and our charter schools have a place
at the table and we can have
real conversations about what
needs to be done
rather than just these
fluffy warm fuzzies ideals
because I've sat
here, I've sat in the
classrooms, I've, I've
been through many different
places and I
think that we need to just
let's peel back this and let's
get down to this. Our kids
deserve our best and they
deserve for us
to do whatever it is that we need
to do to make sure that they're
successful.
Um Mr.
Chairman on page
one on those
charts, why are
those grades
represented?
Why are only those grades
represented,
>> Mr. Chair? This is
the
and mesa test the measures
of student success and achievement
and by federal law
you're only required to test
grades three through
eight. >> I knew the
answer to that. Thank you, Sonny and thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
My, my, my point
is
we have spent this legislator
has funded early education
or early childhood education
intervention. Do you have an
idea what, how much has
been put into early childhood
education?
>> Mr. Chair, Mr.
Representative. Uh the
question is how, how much dollars have gone
in early childhood education? >> That is correct,
sir. How, how much, how
much have we put
as far as early child
intervention and also the funds
that have been set up to support early
childhood
education.
>> Uh Mr. Chair representative, I do
not have the exact answer there.
I think there's a couple of answers
to that. Maybe Sonny might have that in front of
us where we've got dollars
going into early childhood uh
care department where we
see uh opportunities for uh
you know, students across
New Mexico to be able to have access to that
early childhood. But at the same
time, what we're doing within the public
schools and charters, uh
Sonny, do you have
a better answer for than what I
have >> Mr.
Chair uh
for just pre-kindergarten.
We've increased funding
from 282
million in
fiscal year, 19 to
709 million
in fiscal year
25.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And my, my
question then is
how, what impact has that
has, how many of our students are more
kindergarten ready
because of these,
you know, as far as more
dollars towards that
um that
group,
>> uh Mr. Chair
representative,
we are seeing uh
improvements in
students being able to be ready for
kindergarten. We're also
starting to see improvements
once they get to third grade. Uh
We are still in that, in
that cohort of students that
were in the COVID
area where they were
uh much of their learning
that was happening, was happening from
home. In fact, that's what you see
this year, we see a little bit of a
dip in third grade
when we kind of track that back.
These are the students that were kindergarteners
during COVID. We can
attribute some of that,
that reasoning for
that. But uh but I do
believe that we are gonna
continue to see positive outcomes
because of the efforts with your early
childhood. >> And thank you,
Mr. She and my point, that's really
what you made. My point is we need to see the
data on that because
we want to see because we know we've
said it every time that if a
student can't read by third
grade, that there
um possibility
or there they become a greater
percentage of drop outs
and not being successful here.
So we need more data on
the, on the K 12. What
is our dollars?
How many of them? Because early
identification and early
intervention will
only level the playing field
if we, if we really hold
those grades or really study those
grades? Um
And that also goes to my point
um Mr. Chairman on
the second
graph, we see as
far as the math proof you can
see. Can you tell me
um what the the
numbers for 7th and 8th
grade,
the percentage of proficient on
the, the
graph?
>> Now, I just wonder, do you have the
percentages for
that,
>> Mr. Chairman
Representative?
It's a little
less than 30% for seventh
grade and a little
less than 20% for
eight. >> And thank
you. Mr. Chairman. And my, my point
for that is
knowing that how much
more of our funds have been targeted,
have we received or have we
targeted more funds towards those
grades? And if not,
then we should be because
if we're talking about data driven
decision making, we're talking
about hundreds
of millions and billions of
dollars and we're
not allocate them to where
the, the need is or where
we see this,
then we're really just wasting
money. I, I
totally support funding our
schools. I
totally, and I have agreed and I
voted for those.
But if we don't start seeing
some results, if we
don't start putting the money where
they needs to be done. And,
you know, as far as accountability,
both accountability from the top
down to the classroom,
then we're wasting money. And
the last thing I will say
with, and I
had a quote here and
it's really about the
180 day
rule.
And it says the quote is a
Japanese proverb better
than 1000 days of diligence
study is one day with a
great teacher.
I also double down and say if you
can take me and show me a program
where just more is better,
I'll go because
I believe that just
more
of the same types
of things we've been doing for the
last
several years is
a waste of time and it's a waste of
dollars. So I
also say that, you know, show
me of, of
my bags are packed. We're gonna
go because until that
time I, whether I
sit at this table or another
table, I'm gonna say
that it's local decision making and
local control
that needs to be done. The individual
teacher in that classroom
knows what that student needs.
Best not us
up here in Santa
Fe.
So I, I hope that we take
a look at this. I hope
that we look to see what the effectiveness
as Representative Jamil said,
of our summer institutes.
Not that we have the numbers there.
What impact did that have
on their proficiencies or
otherwise? I
think as I said before, we've
got to really begin
to have this and pull it back
and take a look at it. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you. I have one question for
you. Do you
know where fluffy and fuzzy has
got us in
education?
>> So there in the, the books that
I read in kindergarten along with
rockets and >> dinosaurs? No,
it got us to
50th.
Uh
Senator Woods.
>> How many um Mr.
Chair and
Secretary
Romero,
how many education
majors do we have
studying in the university
right now? For
bas in
education?
>> Mr. Chair, Senator
II, I do not have that
off the top of my head. I know that.
Let me let me say it this way, I, I
maybe this is a partial
answer is we have about
1100 students that are in
teacher prep programs. That's
either gonna be between educator
fellows uh pay student
teaching and residency programs
that, but I do not believe that that would,
that would encumber everybody.
So I will get you that,
that total number.
>> And, and also Mr.
Chair, Mr.
Secretary, how
many have we got in,
in the, in the
MS
degrees to, to
go into your,
your leadership,
your superintendent's
principal. How
many of those do we
have? >> Uh Mr.
Chair Senator. Another good
question. I don't have that number off the top of my
head, but I
would, I'm gonna anecdotally
say that that number has gone
down over the years and
we are working with hired
institutions to be able to increase those
numbers for leadership
programs.
>> Another question I have
is
you were talking about A
I and
curriculum.
Do you ever see A I
replacing the actual
teacher in the classroom?
>> Uh Mr. Chair Senator. No,
I do not. I, I believe that
the way that we are looking at
artificial intelligence is going
to have a positive impact
on instruction on
classrooms and actually be a
benefit for teachers. Uh
Really this, this first step
is to be able to understand what A
I is and what the tool is
so that we can use it in a
positive way. One of the
things you're also going to be hearing from the
agency is, is really
guidance around how to best
use A A I and
really allow for
local uh districts to be able
to create those policies about how that's
going to be. So that's going to be step
one. >> The,
the, the, the theme that
I'm trying to get at here
is
we were 700 teachers
short.
There's no way there's one
thing that if a student
is not in the classroom, they can't
learn. But
if a, if a teacher is
not in the classroom,
he can't be taught.
And I know that we have
a lot of aides
that have become
very proficient
just on the job
training.
But
I was just trying to figure
out
how we
could,
how we could uh
incentivize
more people into the
education.
Uh
do uh
um
job, I guess you might say
trying to get more people
on the job
to, to do
their work, to
educate our kids
because it's a, it's
a, a student to
teacher
deal a
as Representative
Baca said, you,
you need a, a good
teacher to teach
good kids. And
I think that's a combination
that we're, we're
missing and
by just your
numbers
and
that's been going on for quite a while,
Mr. Chair.
Uh Thank you
for the opportunity.
>> Thank you real quick. And I, I gotta go
to a construction meeting
so I gotta get on zoom.
No kid will ever do
math. Ever again
after A
I,
they won't know how to do it because they're
gonna look to their phones. Right.
Or they're gonna type it in and
A I is going to give them the answer to
everything. Right.
I don't know. You guys better get
your hands around a I really
quick
because, I mean, we use
it for a lot of stuff right now.
We have trucks that,
that A I stuff
and, and they just learn
every day, the more you drive them,
the more they learn. Right.
And I,
I don't know how, what's gonna happen,
but I do have to go
this meeting. The number
is
for this year,
22,344
students. Right? Gets
us in the
median.
I know you haven't been there long. But, I mean,
we spend a lot of money on this and,
and getting into the meeting and
what I'd like you to do really
is do legis that for
each district. Maybe
you should mimic this.
Maybe LSC is listening
and, and have pe D do
a legis staff for each district to see
where they're failing and where their performance
metrics are made and where
they're spending their money. I mean, that
would help a lot local
control. Sometimes
it's good. Sometimes it's bad. It
depends on who's elected and
who the superintendent is.
Sometimes he can lead a blind
horse off a cliff if he wants.
And so there is
some some
good and bad in that. But
when you have good people, then it's
good. When you have bad people, then it's
bad and, and so
I'll do that. Senator Rodriguez.
I got uh
Representative Pettigrew and
Representative Herndon left on the
list.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Ok. Thank you. All
righty. Then I think we're moving
on to the next one. Representative
Pettigrew, you are and you had your hand
up earlier. So sorry for
the delay a little bit
here.
>> Thank you madam Chair
and thank you for
that. Um
Thank you, Sonny and
Secretary. I
have
one question and then
maybe a suggestion that
follows that up and it
doesn't really fall within the
legat, but
we bump that topic in here.
So we're gonna cover that.
Um Do you
believe in the
uh micro
credential platform
that our teachers
have to take to
go from level one to level two
and so on and so forth? Do you
believe in that system? >> Uh
madam Chair
representative, uh we've
been able to actually get some really
wonderful feedback from
people that are in that program.
So that, that was, that
made me smile that we, that
we were maybe doing something that
was good for a certain
population. We
are definitely looking at how we
can uh articulate
measure and document uh
continuing education
for teachers, all
educators. Um
And an idea would be
through maybe a credentialing system to be
able to do that. Uh
So
Yes, I think in some
ways we've been able to see some successes
from it.
>> Thank you, madam Chair and
thank you Secretary for that.
So
I think you're gonna get a lot of kick
back from higher
education with what I'm gonna
suggest, but I
think you ought to push back
harder.
Our, our teachers are coming
in and
they're going through those
the, that, that coursework
so they can educate
themselves
and meet the definition
that the State of New Mexico has
to get you to a level two
capability.
We need to find a way
that those hours that they
dedicate
to doing that
work towards their master's
degree.
And I think that that would
motivate our,
uh our teachers
to push that a little bit quicker
because we want our teachers to
go. I mean,
our system is set up to
where the education
side of that going from a
Bachelor's to a master's
maybe even taking it even
further. That's what we
want. We want to see that
level of education.
Um And so if
we're gonna do that, let's motivate
them. And like I
said, because that's not gonna
through the higher education
system. I think you're gonna get
a lot of kick back, but I
think you ought to
push back
hard.
That's all I have. Thank >> you, madam Chair.
Thank you. All >> right. Thank you,
representative. All
righty, we're going to mov'e on to Representative
Herndon and I want, you know, I
appreciate so much your
patience. Always, you know, you
attend every meeting
and you sit in our
committees, always listening
and just waiting patiently for us
to call on you. We never
see any kind of frustration
on you or anything we we're learning.
So, thank you. You're of
an inspiration. Representative.
Thank you. You can proceed.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
I would just ask you if you would turn off
your microphone
and uh and Mr.
Superintend, uh Mr.
Secretary, I just
uh just three major areas I
want to bring up with you. The
first one is uh
looking at the high school
rankings within the State of
New Mexico and
nationally. So
the Albuquerque Institute of
Math and Science is the number
one ranked high school
in the entire State. It is
also number 20th
in the entire nation.
So they're doing something. That's right.
And have we been looking to
them in terms of
all of these statistics that
we're talking about and things that May
be going wrong then? What
indeed is uh what
indeed are they doing that we should
be making sure is
implemented in our other
schools?
>> Yes, thank you madam Chair
representative A I've been
following uh some of those
reports also with some of, and we've got
some great examples of high schools across
New Mexico. Um
That is the question, how do
we uh really
try to share that knowledge with
other high schools across New
Mexico? And
so uh that's something
II I think is important.
Uh The way we do that is to be able
to try to get them in the same room with each
other so they can learn from each other,
be able to come and visit those schools
so they can, you know, see what they're doing,
right? And how they can take some
of those ideas and implement it into
their whole their own high school.
Now, there's some nuances to these
things. Uh The example you
gave, it's a very specialized
school, a certain size.
You know, there's some very, you know, there's a lot of
thought that went into that, that school
environment. How do we translate
that into a large uh high
school like Sibila
or Rio Rancho High
School. And so, but I think
that there is ways to be able to do that. And
I, and I love that you brought that up because I
think that's
important.
>> Thank you very much, Mr.
Secretary. I found it to
be quite interesting that
the top four ranked
schools in our entire State
were all charter schools.
So there's the, the number one
which is 20th in the country
and then it was Cottonwood Classical
prep and then uh
Mandela
International Magnet
School followed by the as
Academy. So I'm
just, I I'm glad that you're
looking at what are they doing
so that we can implement this on a
wider scale. One other
thing I found to be interesting that I
want to share with you is
that the new futures High
School was not ranked
at all by any
by the national
ranking procedures. And I
bring this up to you because
that school is
uh for pregnant and parenting
students. Not only that,
but if you look at the population
of that school, it is
up 100% of students
who are economically
disadvantaged. And I
also just bring that up to
you is that I was a mentee,
a mentor for a student in
that school who
wanted to go to me, who wanted to
go to medical school and
she wanted to be in the B A MD
program. She had a high
ranking, but she had a
child and they would not admit
her into that program. So
I'm gonna keep bringing that up over
and over and I just hope that you
don't forget about the school
and the students that are there as
we're looking at this bigger, broader
aspect. And the fact that they're
unranked really does
create a problem. I think
for >> us madam Chair
representative, I, I know that
we, I, I would
love to go with you on a visit over there. And
I, and I had, I've had to bow out a
couple of times. I'm gonna
recommit to you. I want to be able to go do
that. I want, I want you to show off the
wonderful things that are happening there.
Can we do that
>> can absolutely do that. And then one
last item I wish to bring up with
you is that with respect
to uh our, our native
population. And I think
Representative Jamia brought
this up. So if
we're looking at this data and
statistics that are going on in
that, in our, in our
native students
who are in our schools,
it looks like 10.6%
of the population is comprised of
Native American students.
Only 2.5%
of the teachers are Native
American. And I bring
that up to you because the,
the commission on
Civil Rights for
the United States of which
there is an advisory
Committee and I happen to sit
on it for the, for
the for New Mexico
and we've been looking at that issue
and, and as you talk about this
preparation for
stu for teachers,
like I I'm
just saying to you, Mr.
Secretary, this has to
be a priority. >> I
agree. Uh madam
Chair representative, uh let me
give a bright spot and then I'll give you,
I think where the work needs to happen
next. A bright spot is
going to be a runner educator fellows
program. We have about
450 individuals across
State New Mexico in that program. This is
a teacher prep program. What's
wonderful about one wonderful
statistic about this is about
20% of them come from
native communities. And
so I'm very excited about that.
In fact, we've had many
already graduate and now they're in
classrooms and what's great about it too.
Not only is it 20% of that
population um but
there are also gonna be individuals
that are from that community
and they're gonna be in that community for
2025 30 years. So that's
a positive. The
work I think we need to be able to do
next is really working with our hired
institutions so that we
can have specific recruiting
opportunities to be able to get
more people to go into the teaching
field. Uh not only in our
native communities but across
across our, our State,
but uh but definitely
focusing on our native communities.
I 100% agree with
you. >> Thank you, Mr.
Secretary and thank you madam Chair
for your wonderful comments.
>> Thank you. Thank you representative.
All right, we're gonna mov'e on to
Senator Gonzalez,
Senator.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank
you to both of you. I, I don't
have a question. I just want to
make a, you
know, just an observation as
we're facing in,
you have seen the shortfall
on bus
drivers
and I really
would like to um,
maybe that we could take a
look at it and we don't need a study,
but, you know, just a
little bit more flexibility
on going on that. And then,
especially during
the times when we hit spots
of fuel
increases and a few other
things, but also
maybe a little bit more
uh looking into the
possibility of
more flexibility
within the routing system.
Thank you.
>> If I May, can I make a quick
32nd comment on that?
I agree. Uh We've been doing a
lot of uh thought
about how we are able to hire
more bus drivers. Uh
That is an issue across the State of
New Mexico. Um A
couple of things to know about that also though.
And I want to take this back to the enrollment
uh cliff that, that, that we
have within public schools.
Um As our enrollment
goes down, this is a good example
of that our bus routes has stayed
the same. Um And
so this might be another area.
How do we recruit and
be able to keep more bus drivers. But at
the same time, how do we work
with school districts to, for them to be able to
look at, how do they
evolve their bus
routes? Um How many students
are on those buses? And do they
need to make some adjustments? And I think
you, you mentioned how do we become more
efficient with those bus routes? So those are
all aspects of, of that,
of that
topic.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator and
thank you, Secretary.
I don't have anyone else
on the list. I want to
say thank you for your work.
We talked a little bit coming up
the stairs this morning and,
um, you know, I just reiterate
the fact that you do have a
very difficult job to
do lots of
mandates and
expectations and many
times we forget that they,
they don't have overnight.
But when you see,
um, lots of effort
and work as you're, you're
doing. We, we appreciate
that as we did indicate
though. Lots of work still
needs to be done. Thank you
so much. And of course, to
Sunny. How can
I say? Thank you, Sonny.
You're wonderful. Appreciate you.
Now, we're gonna have
lunch right out the doors
here to your right. That's
where it is. So we will break for
lunch. Thanks again.
