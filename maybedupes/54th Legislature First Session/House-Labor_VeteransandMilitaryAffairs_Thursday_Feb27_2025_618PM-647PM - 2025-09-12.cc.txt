We got you. Thank you.
We heard a quiet here.
Thank you. So we have quorum.
All right. Thank you.
So, um,
Just a couple of changes of the
sponsor of
The main sponsor of House Bill
438 is unable to be here right
at this moment.
And I didn't want to keep
anybody.
So we're gonna go ahead and
proceed with
438. I'll be presenting vice
chairing.
Thank you.
Right? Yeah.
OK. You
side and then that way I don't
have to walk and get the.
and all that. Yeah. Oh, that's
right.
Never mind, never mind. I have.
is one expert um.
Online
And I will introduce her
Catherine Clark.
Um, do we have her on? OK.
All right, we have Catherine
Clark and the other.
Lindsay Hurst. Are you gonna be,
are you just in support?
OK, that's fine. That's fine.
Then because Catherine Clark is
on Zoom. I'm going to just
remain in my seat of the
committee. All right, so before
we begin, um, the sponsor and I
believe of the committee
Oh
Madam Chair, are you, um, are we
good on Zoom?
OK.
Whenever you're ready.
Because it's yours.
All right, so thank you, um,
Madam Vice Chair, I'm gonna go
ahead and proceed with um
committee substitute.
And explain um.
The uh main differences.
From the um original bill.
And uh the substitute. So if um.
The bill is relating to employee
benefits requiring employees of
the state and political
subdivisions of the state.
Uh, to be
Paid for unused compensatory
time at the end of each calendar
year. That is the language in
House Bill 43 the substitute.
changes the language in the
opening.
And it provides for
Political subdivisions of the
state to be provided an
opportunity to exchange unused
compensatory leave.
For compensation at least twice
each year.
Adam Che I moved the committee
substitute for discussion.
Yeah
OK, it's been moved.
I just have a not a very long
line of questioning, um, madam,
confusing, Madam vice chair and
um Madam Chair, um, so what
wanting to pay it out twice,
what's the benefit of that
versus the, was it?
Thank you for the question and I
will ask the expert witness to
answer, Katherine.
Clark
Did you?
Yes, Madam Chair, Madam vice
chair, um, so I think this uh
amendment was designed to make
it easier for um uh employees
who are seeking compensation for
their compensatory time to be
able to cash that time out
because there was a concern in
the FIR that if it was waited
till the end of the year, that
it'd be a lot, it would be a
large financial burden for um
agencies and counties, um.
Um, the, the original issue that
we are seeing is that
particularly in divisions that
don't have a lot of or have a
lot of vacancies. There are kind
of the star employees who are
acquiring a lot of compensatory
time. And then because they are
such an essential, um, and I'm
sorry, I'm at a cafe because my
internet at the hotel is down,
but if the um
It's the employee is working
many, many hours because they're
an essential employee. They're
unable to um to use that
compensatory time or take that
leave, and then some divisions
are actually asking them to
just, um, zero out their
compensatory time, which means
they're not actually receiving
any compensation for all of that
time, and it is a form of wage
theft. And so we're hoping to
make sure that at least in a
sort of reasonable way, there's
twice a year.
That folks could actually cash
out that time because they're
never gonna be able to use it in
any other way.
We
failed to um
Get uh comments from folks on
Zoom and in the audience.
So we'll go to Zoom first.
Those in opposition, raise your
hand if you want to speak.
OK, uh, in the audience, is
there anyone in opposite? We're
gonna go back to Zoom.
Anyone in support on Zoom who
wants to speak?
Raise your hand.
Anyone in the audience in OK,
um, can you call out their name,
please?
Carter, do you want and this is,
yeah, hi, this is Carter Bundy
with Ask Me. We want to thank
the sponsor for bringing this.
Um, this is a really important
thing to offer state employees
and other public employees
flexibility to um to really be
recognized for the extra work
that they do, um, they've earned
the time, they should be able to
cash out or carry it over and we
thank the sponsor and urged you
pass. Thank you.
Thank you. In the audience, is
there anyone in favor?
Madam Chair and committee, thank
you for the opportunity to speak
and thank you for the sponsors
for bringing this bill forward.
My name is Lindsay Hurst. I'm
currently serving as the
executive vice president for CWA
Local 7076, and a state
employee. Our union represents
employees at 13 state agencies,
about 2700 positions, 27% of
which are vacant. Due to high
vacancy rates for years, state
employees are being tasked with
additional job duties to cover
vacant, critical positions to
meet program needs and as a
result are
accruing comp time in excess of
accrual limitations. Our union
recently represented a state
employee who retired with over
600 hours of comp time accrued,
the extra work done with
approval of her supervisor in
order to meet assigned project
goals, the state agency only
paid her for 240 hours, and she
was not paid out for nearly 400
hours of work. This issue is
impacting our hardest working,
most dedicated employees,
frequently employees are unable
to utilize a crude comp time as
leave because management.
is unable or unwilling to grant
the leave due to coverage issues
resulting from high vacancy
rates. The biannual payout will
allow employees and programs
scheduling flexibility and
reduce the amount of comp time
liability that has been carried
by agencies. Please pass House
Bill 438. Thank you.
Thank you.
Um, and so let's go back to
questions from the
The
OK. Thank you. And so is it
still um comp time still has to
be approved. Yes.
And then, um, just lastly, um,
Madam Chair is the
Is there any certain order that
state employees have to take is
comp time have to be used before
annual and sick or or before
annual leave, or is there any
What is the?
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Oh,
Madam G is here
and representative, thank you.
Um, I'll ask Catherine Clark,
the expert, to answer that. Uh,
thank you, Madam Vice Chair,
Madam Chair, um, so I don't know
about the state, but I do know
that um different political
entities have different rules.
Um, typically, you would, uh, be
able to use your comp time. It's
kind of considered a bank, um,
but unfortunately, if you are
one of those employees who is
covering for a large amount of
vacancies, you are not able to
use any of that time, and that
is, that is the employee we're
trying to benefit here. The
employee who is trying to do the
right thing, making sure that
they're critical infrastructure
is not failing, but literally
has no ability to cash out the
time that they've been
compensated in order to be able
to, um, you know, work extra
hours. It's kind of an it's kind
of an unfinished promise when
you can't ever cash out the comp
time that you've, uh, been
promised to receive.
And so, Madam Chair, an expert.
I understand kind of the budget
issues, um, having run an
office, that can be, I, I guess
you're saying it can be a, a
large at the end of the year
when someone says in work and
they don't have it in their
budget, uh, Madam Chair, so the
year when someone says in work
and they don't have it in their
budget, uh, Madam Chair, so
representative.
That was the echo, yes, think,
uh, yes, it, it does help
manage.
Not only the budget, but it also
manages.
time.
Uh, a crude.
Um, and also time of other
employees. It has a lot uh
multiple effect, as you, as you
know, thank you.
Madam Chair and expert, so is,
is twice a year.
Um
I can see the budget
The budget part of it, but at
the end of the year, they're
just not paying the, how is this
gonna change what?
representative.
Miss Clark, are you able to
answer that question?
Yeah, so currently what happens
uh for certain divisions,
depending on the division, is
that there's a limit to how much
comp time, um, so basically it
zeros out their account. So if
they haven't used it by the end
of the year, it zeroes out. So
all that time that they've
earned is just, uh, becomes a
zero amount. And that's really
unfair, particularly for those
employees who really because of
the vacancy rates in their
divisions have not been able to
take the time off. So, um, the
idea is that if it's truly a
division,
where there are a lot of vacancy
rates and clearly a lot of
vacancy savings, then they
should be able to to cash out
that time that they've earned
and cannot take because they're
just so busy.
Thank you. That's all the
questions.
Do you have a second?
Oh,
Madam Chair, I'd like to move a
do not pass on a house now do we
have a second?
We have a motion and we have a
second.
Uh, clerk to call the roll.
Representative Anaya, yes.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Hall.
No.
Representative Johnson.
Yeah.
Representative Mejia.
Yeah.
Representative Ortiz, yes.
Representative Reed.
Representative Terazas.
Representative Torres Velasquez.
Yeah
Vice Chair Chavez.
Yes.
Chairwoman, uh, Royal Caballero.
Yes.
We have a 7 to 3 vote this bill
passes.
All right, Representative, um.
Martinez, we have House Bill
494.
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the day I bring you a nice
little we're trying to
With the addition of the new uh.
Tax levels
Uh, this just kind of evens
everything out.
Um, it takes the reporting time.
And makes it more uniform so
we're good.
And with me I have my.
um
Past number of individuals
coming in and so, um, the
original exemption allowed
veterans to come in throughout
the year to file for those
individuals going to the 10%
disability. We went from 16,
more than 51,000 people coming
in and filing for exemptions.
But all this does, it takes.
The filing time frame back to
the original filing time frame,
so when the assessment to um
file for the
They can receive an additional
10 from um an additional 30, uh,
so there's a 30, 30 day waiting
period if they're waiting for
their certificate if they still.
Haven't received it, then they
can file all we're doing here is
just taking it back to the
original filing guidelines, um,
because it's just totally with
that, Madam Chair, we stand for
question.
Thank you. We'll go to the um.
Zoom and anyone in opposition on
Zoom, please raise your hand.
Right
Anyone, uh, in favor who wishes
to speak on Zoom. Raise your
hand. OK, no one.
And I
Don't see anybody in the
audience.
OK.
By the way, thank you. So we go
now to committee.
What is the
just have some questions. Um.
The analysis says that it
conflicts with.
House Bill 47, which is the
isolation.
from the constitutional.
Um, I remember that we, that was
just passed by the voters. Is
that the case, Madam Chair, and
Representative.
Thank you, Representative. We
actually worked with the sponsor
of Healthcare that we're working
on this language. I believe it.
Um, this, that bill didn't
contain the date changes that we
needed that were necessary, but
I know that the secretary as
well as the sponsor of 47 are
aware of this, thank you, Madam
Chair and um.
So,
I just want to understand. So
does 47 do something different
than what this is doing is 47
and I don't wanna, you know,
have, we don't have to talk
about other bills, but because
it says it's I wanna make sure
that this is in alignment.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative. Um,
I will go ahead and put it out
there. I am not a tax expert and
so this, the veterans exemptions
really and so both of these
bills work together to to clean
up.
What happened. 47 is a lot more
intensive than what it does
components of it,
um, but it didn't contain this
one app
throughout even actually through
late in the interim throughout
session together, um, the
county's also support house
building. Right. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative next
we have Representative Garcia.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um, thank you, Representative
and the expert.
Um
So the original.
100%
Um
Uh
100% um service related disabled
veteran.
Um
better process where manager and
chair.
Uh, the veteran had to
Communicate with the Veterans
department.
You get a certificate.
of eligibility.
Uh, mainly because.
The assessor.
Uh, Madam Cha needed to know
that this was a viable.
Candidate for the 100%
exemption.
So with your bill, that doesn't
change.
There still needs to be that
process.
Of the vets
Uh, going before the veterans.
apartment.
You get that certificate of.
A the city or
of approval.
Um
Uh, so the question I guess is
uh that process hasn't changed
with the bill that you're
bringing forth.
Madam chair Representative
Garcia, it's still the same
thing, the Department of Veteran
Services is changing their
application.
Just to reflect the different
levels of disability available
now.
Yeah.
So
I chair uh in, in the 100%
service related disabled.
Uh, a veteran could.
Throughout the year, make the
application.
Um
Or seek the certification and
make the application with the
assessor.
Um
And in a timely manner qualify
for.
The exemption.
Um
Is your bill limiting?
That time frame?
To a confined time.
And I'm Chair Representative.
When we, when we worked on the
disabled veteran, uh, exemption.
20 years ago.
It was very standardized, 30 day
window.
So we would start getting
applications in November when
the
Not valuation would go out.
We would then start issuing
those certificates from November
to April. That would be good.
That doesn't change.
My bill 2 years ago.
Allowed for a veteran to submit
that certificate to the county
at any time.
Mhm
This just brings it back in
alignment because the
additional.
Amount of certificates that'll
be um
Issued to veterans across the
state.
Has gone up 5 times. So this
will just allow.
It'll allow the process to go
back to the original timeline.
Veterans will can still apply at
any time.
Department of Veteran Services.
As somebody dedicated to this,
this, uh, benefit.
So they're issuing certificates
all year long.
All this does is bring it back
to that 30 day window.
And then allow for the extension
if they haven't received their
certificate.
Yeah, I see.
Thank you, madam chair.
Representatives.
Thank you for this though, um.
I have a question. I don't know
if either of you can answer for
me, Madam Chair. Um,
Madam Vice Chair.
Um, committee chair, um,
And sponsors, um.
When a veteran buys a house.
Is that sail flagged with the
county assessor so that when the
time comes to um for evaluation,
they know that, um, the
homeowner is a veteran or is
that just not part of the
process, um, and, and, and if
not, are there other prompts
that can help veterans to
remember.
That 30 day period that they
need to answer your first
part of the question.
Um
When they file the deed, that
that's not part of the process.
The assessor's not gonna know
the owner's a veteran until
second part of your question.
Could you repeat that? I'm so
sorry, Madam Chair. Um, Madam
Chair, uh, members of the
committee and sponsors when they
don't have that information when
they first buy the house and the
first valuation is completed,
um, are there ways that the
owner who's a veteran can be.
Notified or reminded.
And I don't remember my exact
wording.
But are are there ways for
notification to all veterans who
are homeowners that they have 30
days to.
Um, to file.
This, um, Madam Chair
Representative, years ago we
entered into an agreement, um.
When I was with agreement.
With the county assessors, so
when they get their valuation.
There's a list of information.
On there is the information if
you are a veteran.
Here's the website, here's the
phone number.
And the, the Department of
Veteran Services has, has, um,
Benefit seminars across the
state all year long and.
That's part of what they're in
those applications for
certificates Madam Chair, um,
Miss, uh, Representative, um,
thank you for that answer.
Somehow, I knew you'd have it.
Thank you.
Thank you. Um, I don't have any
questions. I think I under
previously and what you're doing
now, I just.
Worry about uh the information.
In
Available
And understood by.
Our veteran family. So, um, but
I'm sure that the department is
