We're gonna go ahead and get started. I hope
you all are well this morning.
Um I wanted to start
off first
by,
oh,
they're still working on it,
but
really wanted to start off by
thanking um
our kitchen staff who
has kept us well
fed. We've certainly
enjoyed um the food that
you all provided for us,
breakfast and lunch
here. Thank you
all.
Thank you so much. We really
appreciate
it.
All right. So we'll go on with our
first agenda item for this morning.
So higher education or
LFCU program evaluation.
So please, when you all are ready
morning.
>> Good morning, Mr chairman, members
of the committee. My name
is Jessica Hathaway, senior policy
analyst for all of you.
And I'm just here to introduce
um Sam Leisman, who's a program
evaluator with the legislative
finance committee
this morning. He'll be presenting
on online higher education
and we wanted to make sure that we
clarify that. This is a
April, right? April
um 2024
evaluation that they presented.
And although we focus primarily
on K through 12 education,
there's a lot of information here that
connects to where our students are
going after and So we wanted to make
sure that you heard this all too.
Um So I'll turn it over to
Sam Leisman at this point
and it will be a great evaluation to hear
about. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Uh Good
morning Mr Chair and members of the
committee. My name is Sam
Leisman and I'm a program evaluator
with the legislative finance
committee. Uh Today, I'll
be presenting an LFC program
evaluation about online higher
education. Uh You should
all have that in front of you. It looks like
this. Um
I'd like to thank Secretary
Rodriguez and the higher education
department and their staff for
their collaboration on this project.
I'd also like to thank the Council of
university presidents, the New
Mexico Independent Community College
Association and the New
Mexico Association of Community
Colleges for their collaboration
on this project as well.
If you turn to page
two
for summary of this
report, you'll
see that higher education institutions
are missing opportunities for
increased enrollment and efficiencies
with online education,
higher education institutions
or HEIS
nationwide significantly
scaled up online education
in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. 40 years
later, online course taking
remains a substantial part of higher
education.
With this expansion of online
education, state colleges
are well positioned to reach New
Mexico's roughly 100 and
20,000 adults who have some
college experience but no
credential. Many
students drop out of college because
of the difficulty in balancing
work and school commitments.
A situation that online
college courses can help
alleviate.
However New Mexico colleges
are missing the opportunity to
use online education to
fully reach the student
population.
Furthermore, over
11,000 New Mexico residents
are enrolled in out of state online
colleges suggesting that
new Mexico State colleges are
being out competed in the online
education market.
The New Mexico Higher Education
System is also not realizing
millions of dollars in efficiencies
with online education
heis could save up to
$5.7 million
annually by increasing the
class size of lower
level online courses with
fewer than 30 students.
Many New Mexico Higher education
institutions are separately
purchasing the same learning
management systems to deliver
online courses
unnecessarily leading to
additional costs by not
using a shared price agreement.
State Colleges could reinvest
the cost savings from these and
other efficiencies into
raising New Mexico's comparatively
low faculty and instructor
salaries.
Finally, the expansion
of online education in New
Mexico has profound
implications for higher education
facilities spanning
18.6 million square
feet and costing at least
$178 million
per year. The number of
New Mexico college students taking
all of their classes on campus
has decreased 63%
over the past decade. While
building space has decreased by only
2%. The
result is that New Mexico hes
are most likely under using
building space in the
future. Hes
the higher education department
and the legislature will all need
to better consider the impacts of
online higher education on
higher education capital outlay
requests and
decisions.
And now Mr Chair and members of the
committee, if you please turn to page
five, I'll now
present the background section of this
report.
Page five describes how online
higher education has been increasing
nationally for over a decade.
As shown on chart one,
a trend which the COVID-19
pandemic accelerated but
did not initiate
in New Mexico online course
taking remains a substantial part
of higher education. And on
chart two, you can see that
45% of college
credit hours statewide
are taken online
online course taking varies
widely across heis
across the state. As shown
on chart three with
some community colleges providing
more than 75%
of their college credit hours.
Online.
Page six
provides an overview of
online course taking patterns in
New Mexico. Online
classes are commonly
asynchronous, which means that
classes are self-paced and do not
have a scheduled meeting time
on table one. You'll
see that students must commonly take
online courses in business,
humanities and social science.
Fields of study, students
taking online classes are also
more likely to be female, tend
to be older and are more likely
to be from a racial or ethnic
minority background.
The next section on page
seven describes
how students report appreciating
the flexibility of online
classes and national surveys
and that colleges are planning to
expand online
offerings.
The bottom of page
eight
discusses how new Mexico State
University recently established
an online Global campus
in MS U Global, which has
experienced an 100 and
58% enrollment
increase since 2019,
which you can see in chart five on
the bottom of page eight.
This demonstrates the fiscal
viability and student demand
for online programming.
On page nine, you'll see the
report's first finding as
out of state schools recruit
thousands of state residents. New
Mexico, hes are not
fully reaching adults without a
credential.
New Mexico has roughly 100
and 20,000 working age
adults who started college but
did not complete a college
credential. Those
adults face lower earnings,
employment rates and labor
force participation compared
to adults with a college
credential. On page
10.
The report describes how the most
common reasons cited for dropping
out of college include balancing
work and school
research suggests that older
and more experienced students tend to
be more successful in online courses
compared to their younger
counterparts.
If you'll please turn to page
11, you'll
see that over 11,000 New
Mexico residents are enrolled in
out of state online programs,
some of which are shown in table
five resulting in
an estimated loss of 58
million per year in tuition revenue
for New Mexico.
Hes
the number of New Mexico residents in
out of state online programs has
increased by 79%
since 2015.
Highlighting the need for targeted
efforts to retain these
students. Page
12 describes
how targeted recruitment campaigns
combined with free tuition
have shown to increase re enrollment
rates among former college
students.
And now if you'll turn to page
13 for the report's
second finding state,
hes are missing opportunities
to achieve efficiencies with online
education.
The main cost driver of a higher
education course are instructor
pay and class size regardless
of whether a course is offered online
or in person. This
means that online courses are not
exceedingly cost prohibitive for
institutions to offer.
On page 14.
The report discusses how
institutions could collaborate
to offer online courses more
efficiently. Nearly
half of online course sections
of lower level courses offered
in the 2022 2023
school year had 19 or
fewer students. By
comparison. Online classes
at Arizona State University
have an average size of 50
students if New
Mexico Mexico State
Colleges were to share courses
so that these lower level courses reached
the size of 30 students.
LFC staff estimate
it could save between 4.7
to $5.7
million as shown on chart
11 on page
15.
While 30 students may not be
appropriate for all disciplines.
The report notes that there were over
500 class sections with
fewer than 10 students in the
2020 2020 22
2023 school year.
Many of these could be combined
such as two sections of
introductory microeconomics
offered at Enum U Riso
and Enu Roswell
with seven and eight students enrolled
without any loss of instructional
quality
resources freed up for more
efficient class sizes could be
redirected by institutions
into raising New Mexico's relatively
low faculty salary
salaries. However,
turning to page
16,
NMS U policy currently
blocks this type of course sharing
by prohibiting main campus students
from enrolling in courses offered
at N MS U branch campuses
further reducing
efficiency.
State colleges also have the
opportunity to reduce costs for
software used to provide online
education services.
19 of 24 colleges use
canvas as their learning management
system but license fees
range from $10 per student
to $40 per student.
As shown on chart 12,
page 17 discusses
how institutions already have a
framework for joint software
or technology purchases
through the New Mexico Council for
Higher Education Computing
Services. And that a joint
purchase agreement for campus
could have saved institutions
roughly $350,000.
On pages 17 and 18,
the report discusses recent state
appropriations made to N MS U
Global, N MS U's Online
campus as shown by
chart 13 on page
18.
Analysis of NMS U Global
financial data shows that it is a
profitable and cost effective
program. Despite this
profitability, the state will have
subsidized NMS U Global
by a total of $17
million by the end of fy
25.
If you now turn to page
19. The
report's final finding is
that online education contributes
to low space utilization at
New Mexico Heis.
As shown by chart 14,
the number of students taking all
of their classes on campus
versus hybrid or online
has dropped by 63%.
Since 2012,
fully online or hybrid
courses necessarily use
less instructional space
than in-person courses
since at least a part of a class's
instruction will be delivered without
a physical classroom.
However, during that same
period, the total amount of
instructional and general space at
New Mexico HEIS
declined by only
2.3%.
Turning to page
20.
The increase in online learning
is contributing to low space
utilization at New Mexico
HEIS.
Table five
shows that classrooms and laboratories
are universally being used at a rate.
Well below the industry benchmark
of 30 to 40 hours a week
at institutions across the
state. Many of the
institutions with poor space
utilization listed in table
five also have high rates of
online learning and other
institutions do not appear to collect
space utilization data in a
systematic manner.
Turning to page 21.
LFC staff conducted a series
of site visits to four learning
centers and two branch campuses.
These visits showed multiple
instances of unused instructional
space during school hours
aligning with the quantitative data
presented in table five
and the 63% decrease
in fully on campus enrollment.
LFC staff conducted
these site visits during normal hours
of operation between 8
a.m. and 5 p.m. at
a variety of times throughout the day.
When classes were in session,
you can see examples of unused
instructional space in the pictures
on pages 21
22
and 23
turning to page 24.
Despite this slow utilization,
the state has continued to provide
hundreds of millions in appropriations
and bonding capacity for new
construction at higher education
institutions.
Moving down page 24
New Mexico lacks space
utilization standards for higher
education. Space
utilization data can provide
valuable guidance about how an
institution should adjust its physical
footprint. But he does
not require institutions to collect
space utilization data nor
is space utilization a formal
criterion used to evaluate
capital outlay projects
by comparison. Other
states such as Utah,
California and North
Carolina have created space
utilization standards for their
institutions and require
them to collect and report on space
utilization data. A
prior evaluation of
hd's capital outlay process
conducted by an outside consultant
recommended that HD work
with institutions to improve the
collection of space utilization
data. Turning to
page 25.
The absence of space utilization
standards has contributed to a lack
of planning for the impact of online
enrollment among institutions
planning documents on file with
HD consistently failed
to discuss the impact of online
enrollment on facilities needs.
70% of plans either
failed to mention online enrollment
or made no connection between
online enrollment and facility
needs. And now
Mr chair and members of the committee. If
you turn back to page
three, I'll
discuss this report's key
recommendations.
This report recommends
that the higher education department
should amend the department's
capital outlay, manual and
rules to include benchmarks for
space utilization
that new Mexico higher education
institutions should
increase the size of online,
lower level general education
courses with fewer than 30
students through combining course
sections and online course sharing
within and across college
systems and report on
the efficacy of their targeted
recruitment campaigns for former
students who did not complete their
studies. This report
also recommends that the higher
education department and state
higher education institutions
should develop a statewide
online course sharing agreement
and that new Mexico Higher education
institutions should negotiate a
joint price agreement for learning
management systems. With
that. I'll be happy to answer any
questions from the committee. Thank
you.
>> All right folks
questions,
Senator Salt. I was
looking at you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair, a
whole lot of information
here very quickly. And so I was trying
to scan and keep up with
things as well.
Uh In
the evaluation, did they
look at the quality of
instruction
on with online compared
to in person?
>> Mr Chair members of the committee.
We did not specifically
look at comparing
quality of instruction between online
in person directly.
We did review
some impact
of delivery of
instruction on grade
point average for class
overall or for over
classes, but that's a
fairly rough method.
There are
different pedagogical
methods used
to deliver online
education.
Generally. It seems that if
those methods are
implemented online
education is an effective way to
deliver course content to
students.
>> And, and Mr Chair. And part of the reason
I ask is, you know,
having been at
universities and faculty
and instruction is
there's a place for some online,
but you can't do a lot of stuff
online also. Um
Lots of this report is
almost like we ought to be moving
lots more of everything
online.
Uh You don't get the
interaction with other students
online. I mean, there's a whole
lot of things that, that
don't come about
as a part of it. Um
As I was looking
through
online courses, at least the
data that I've
seen
there is a much higher
um drop-off
rate. People sign up for the course,
get part way through, get behind
and drop off, which means they
have paid tuition but aren't getting
anything for it. Did you
look at what is the,
the, the non
completion per by
course
for the online programs?
Because that seems like a
significant uh
mechanism that it's
costing students when they're not getting
a benefit is that in the
report, I didn't see that
>> uh Mr chair members of the committee.
Um we did look at that. Um
we conducted a broad literature
review of um
high-quality academic research
conducted on online
education and then as well conducted
our own research and we
found that there was a small
effect in terms of
online courses being associated
with a slight reduction
in the likelihood of finishing a course.
But the effect size of that was overall
fairly small, a relatively
few percentage point
difference. Um And to address
the first part of your question, um would
you mind repeating
uh um
your first question?
>> I'm not sure. I
remember
the, >> oh,
I, I apologize. I, I
remember um
one thing I want to with the
report is that we acknowledge that
online education is not
suited for all
disciplines and all methods of
delivery. Uh And
so one thing that we, we wanted to make
care, we
wanted to make sure with the report is
that online
education is best suited for
specific populations.
For example,
older students with some college
experience who might have
difficulty balancing a
traditional college education
with family and work
commitments, but we
don't recommend an overall
increase in online higher
education.
>> Thank you, Mr
Chair. You know, lots of
the online
education,
the same course. Typically there's
an instructor, you know,
in an in-person, the instructor is
there lecturing for 50
minutes, students are taking notes and
have projects and things
in online, read
the book and the instructor meets
with them a little bit of the
time. I mean, it's almost
where
it's self directed
education,
but they pay the same level of
tuition for a much lower
uh actual cost of the
university.
This report seems like
it's all about saving money for
the university and not about
providing high quality
education.
Um
One of my concerns on page
13, Mr Chair on page
13, let
me get over to that page again
so that I make sure I know what
I
it talks about the average
class sizes for
lower level classes, approximately
20 per course.
Uh Research indicates
30 but then
you kind of jumps over and
says so in online
courses, we ought to have it at 30.
Is there research that shows
that the class
size for online should be the
same as the class size
for
in person? It seems like we're
confounding the two of them
there in how it's
written
>> uh Mr chair members
of the committee so that that
section is fully focused on
just online course
sizes. Um But there is research
that suggests that for
lower level general
education courses, things
like introductory microeconomics
or
apologies for my
profanity
uh for
lower level general education
courses, uh a size
of 30 is appropriate for
the, you know, where you're learning sort of
basic foundational skills.
Um in that case
30 students does not
lead to any instructional
deficit. Um
Once you get larger than that,
you do start to see some
deficit. Um
And obviously, as we acknowledge
in the report that will change
depending on, you know, the level of
intensity of a course, whether
it's an introductory writing course, you
may need fewer
students. Um But we
just wanted to emphasize that
there are opportunities here
to deliver courses more
efficiently without
sacrificing educational
quality. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair, but that
you kind of just indicated as I
read through the all
delivery types and in person
courses.
The the
return on
time for
education is at about
30
but most of that is under
traditional
situations, not
necessarily under
um online
situations. And it, it
sounds like it's taking what is
traditional and saying and it works for
this too. I don't think there's
any data that shows that for
online
>> uh Mr Chair members of the
committee. Um My
apologies for not
answering the question properly,
but that 30 students
is drawn specifically from
literature on online
higher education. So that that
30 is uh
based on studies that
studied the impact of class size
on online higher education.
And there's an excellent literature
review in
the back of our report. And
if you'd like, I can forward you the
specific study
that it goes into a great
amount of detail across,
I think itself collects
effects from 50 different studies
to arrive at that
figure, >> OK.
And Mr Chair and you know, thank
you, it starts off with it says
across all delivery types and then
starts talking about them.
And so it doesn't
specifically spell out
that this is on an online
situation. Uh
The other question was over on
page 24
on space
utilization
standards
from what it sounded like
and I was trying to catch up with it,
but where higher ed has
been asking for capital for
additional space,
at least as I've looked at New
Mexico State, which is my home
university that has
not been for classroom space, that
has been for more laboratory
and research space.
And this report seems to
confuse or combine
those two and indicate that
those capital requests
aren't needed because we're
now have classroom space
available. Those aren't the
same kinds of spaces.
Does that make sense
what I'm asking
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee
to address your question.
So space
standards are commonly used for
laboratory spaces as
well. But the
point we're attempting to make
here is
that
>> we're all teachers, we're used to
this on a daily
basis
>> more generally.
Uh The state has continued
to provide hundreds of millions
of dollars of new construction
for in space
without reductions
or offsetting reductions in
space um
or apologies
without reducing
the size of space as the
physical student footprint
has reduced. Um But
I I agree and acknowledge
that this is an overall
figure and does not, you know,
include the use
of every single Capitol outlay
re or the intended purpose
of every capital outlay
request
>> mister chair. And thank you,
it just seems like this is
a, a broad brush that
doesn't have the nuances of which
kinds of space because even within
instructional space,
space in laboratories,
which is instruction is
very different than
space in classrooms, which
is with the pictures
that included were more
of classroom
space reduction. And
that isn't typically at least
where I've seen that the
capital outlay request from higher
education is coming. It's
much more on the
more
specialized spaces,
but I'll leave it with that
Mr Chair. Thank you,
>> represent me the
>> more.
Thank you Mr Chair.
Um
Sorry, moving the table
here. Thank you Sam
for your report.
Mine is more of a
comment than, than
really a question. I am
a product of online
education. Both
of my degrees
undergrad and, and, and
graduate degree were
done soly
online. Different
uh different formats, undergrad
was um I actually met
with an instructor
once a week.
Um and
we could at least ask her
questions and, and do stuff like
that and all of the courses. Um
My graduate degree
was uh completely
uh self paced. So I
actually fit
the, the
profile that you said uh definitely
older woman uh
and uh Hispanic.
But it, but it, it
fit my lifestyle. I had kids
um for my, for my
graduate degree, I had
um, my job
and kids and lots of other
stuff going on. So
there was no way I could go
to an
institution in order to do
that. And I
think this is great
like that you
said that they, that we
really need to target people
like myself because
a lot of people don't think about it
until it's in, in, in
front of them that they can
finish.
Um, and, and
until it, it's
in front of them, you
know, it's completely
out of their mind and then they're like, hey,
maybe I can, maybe I can
finish this. Um
Now for
those coming out right out of high
school. Uh Yeah,
the, these poor kids
have such a bad taste in their
mouth for online learning
that they would avoid this
like the plague.
So they do,
they, they, that year of
COVID, any, anyone
that I say, hey, you could take online courses.
No, and,
and they want nothing
to do with it. A good
majority. There's some of them that are
self-paced. But
um but I do
appreciate both
of my degrees were out of
state schools
because
in-state schools did not
offer what I was, what I was
wanting purely
online. And of
course, this was several years ago,
maybe that might be different
now. So I would
love to see New Mexico
get more
students like me
because they're offering more things
online, full
programs online.
Um So that way we at
least get the, the, the
revenue and not these out of state
schools. Thank
you.
>> You represent Bunker.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you. Um I had the
fortune to actually hear this in Carlsbad,
this presentation. Um
So I'm gonna highlight just some of the
questions that were
brought up and and some of the
considerations for this
group um
as far as how we can
address this issue. So
Mr Chairman, one of
the missed opportunities
that I think that we're
may be leading to. This
is a lack of collaboration
between our high
schools, our secondary schools
and our colleges.
When we talk about for most
of our high school students,
you know, we celebrate them when they get
their associate's degree. But that,
that's, although it's an increasing
number, it's still a small
number and many of our kids don't
get college credit unless they do
A p well,
that may be very difficult and our students
may not be. So
what I think Mr
Chairman and I think as far
as Sam is that we don't want
to see for students, they may
think I'm ok with college
or high school because this is what
familiar, but I'm
not, college is something different
as foreign. But if
we were to get and earn
credit as a high school
student,
then it's not scary. It's not a, a
new chapter. It's a continuation
of a chapter. And students
that finish
high school with college
credit
are more likely to actually finish
that as far as to go
on and get their associate's degree or
to get, get those
degrees. And so I, I do think Mr
chairman and committee
that I think that we need to
take down some of those bearers
and open up
more courses
to high school students
that have a desire not just
your A P not just
your concurrent enrollment,
but just your, even your
general get, you get your general
studies and your general
classes through high school.
So then when you get to college,
you're more focused and then you
really get to get into your content.
So that's just kind of
my, my thought with
that Mr Chairman.
Um the other
question that was brought up
uh was about
and uh representative Mirabal
Moya talked about it is
why are folks
not using
and taking advantage of our
in-state or
local colleges.
What are the reasons that they're
choosing
some of these platforms?
Uh these programs,
you see one from uh I think
in New Hampshire and
all of these folks here
and all these programs.
But what our folks are missing
is they
cannot access the
opportunity scholarship to pay for
those classes. So
I think part of what we need to do is we
need to
um
basically advertise more
and say, hey, these are
options.
This is some way that you
can if you're
just a recent graduate or
still in school or never
finished your degree,
let us help you with these
opportunity scholarships and
others to get these online
classes. And I do
Mr Chairman, I agree with Senator
Soul, the
uh I, we agree on a lot
of things actually when it comes to
education, but these
hybrid classes where we have more
touchpoints with our students, I
think are an
important part of that.
And I think that when we're looking
at this,
I don't like that really
self-paced. That doesn't
work for everybody. But I think if you
have touch points and you have
different meetings
and in-person meetings, they
are connected. If anything,
the pandemic has taught us is that we
are, we are social
beings
and we need to be,
you know, to have those, those
touchpoints.
Um
The other thing Mr Chairman, and I
think that this is something that I've
I've experienced firsthand
is the rest of process and acceptance
of
credits from other universities.
Right. So some people,
one of the questions or one of the people said,
well, they may start
a program outside of state,
but then they're kind of stuck with
that because they, our local
colleges will not accept
those, those classes. So they're like
starting over. So
I've experienced that in my
graduate and undergraduate degrees as
I transferred in credits,
even between New Mexico State and
UN M, there was not that
reciprocity. So I think
that as we look at a higher ed,
I think that we
should look for more opportunities
to find out
where that fits.
Um
And finally, Mr Chairman
and this is more when
we look about capital outlay.
And we, I, I heard the presentation
about utilization of
space, but
I think that those spaces
when we're repurposing
them, we talk
about, you know, career, technical
education. And we, I'm gonna
emphasize and I'm gonna stress as long
as I'm sitting here about these
degree and certificate
programs which we work
on in high school.
But also I'm gonna advocate
for the arts and I'm gonna
advocate for the activities in
athletics
because that, that is
part of that culture. And
I think that as we're looking at capital, I
don't want to just say that our
colleges and universities
have enough capital.
I, I would love to see, I don't
care if it's art museums.
I don't care if it's performance halls.
I don't care if that, if that's uh
athletic facilities,
we still in this committee
should actually
still
support
the capital projects
for, for
our colleges and for our students
because as I said before, there are
students.
So I, like I
said before, I, I know
that I had asked similar
questions in Carl's Bed,
this group that actually kind
of oversees this. I, I think
my colleagues and I would just like to
hear, you
know, and, and get updates
on how we're doing with this. So
Mr Chairman, I appreciate it.
Thank you,
>> Representative Sarinana.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I was at the
same meeting as Representative
Buck. So I think you asked all my
questions. But one, so
one thing thank you for your
presentation.
One thing that
they discussed
was why are kids going
away to other schools going
out of state?
And um
the answer, one of the answers they said
was because they can get a degree
quicker, the classes
are shorter and they can get more things
done quicker. So,
and this
generation, I guess I could
ask the back row,
they want things done a lot
faster. So is
that still,
is that something you can discuss
>> here?
>> Uh Mr Chair members of the committee,
um that was when we
spoke with institution that was
a commonly cited reason
for why students were going
out of state. Um
Unfortunately, the
boundaries and requirements
of degree uh and
credit programs were sort of
outside the scope a little
bit of our report. Um
but mainly institutions
within the state are bound by
state and as well
as HLC accreditation
requirements that require
a certain amount of time in the classroom require
a certain amount of credits for a degree.
Um That private institutions
operating in other states may
not or institutions
operating in other states may not be
bound. Um So that
may require a more deeper look
at why institutions
aren't able to compete in
terms of
time to degree
or time to
credentials?
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Well, I didn't have a question.
>> Thank you, Mr >> Chair, >> but I
do have one thing
to ask. Thank you for the
presentation. Um
Is any specific
areas um
in um like
engineering
education
that um are where
the students that have been enrolled
more online. So
specific
areas, do
we have that information?
>> Uh Mr Chair and members of the committee,
we do have that information and I
believe it's in
table
one on
page six.
We looked at higher education
course level data um
for the most recent completed school
year and you can
see that students most
commonly take courses
online in
business education,
social sciences,
psychology, and social work
and communications and journalism.
Um And the least
likely are biology
and life sciences, architecture
and engineering, industrial
arts and consumer product or consumer
services, physical
sciences and the arts.
So generally more
liberal arts, uh more
analytical more business focused
classes are the ones that students are
taking online compared
to engineering or
arts, more in person
classes.
>> Thank
you.
>> I guess my other question
is uh in table three on
page 11, you have so
many institutions that
are mostly
the residents of New Mexico residents
going to
will be the
the the online classes.
The sole reason for
this or
other factors on
this besides shorter
classes or
is access or
variety of
programs or
recruiting process.
Do you know any
the reason for this
being the ones who are
mostly for New
Mexicans?
>> Uh Mr Chair and members of the
committee. Um The
answer is a combination of
both when we spoke with higher education
institutions, they cited
uh both the time to degree
which they felt that they were losing
students to. Um but
also occasionally institutions
will outside of the state will offer
programs and institutions here
don't offer online.
Um Its students may not be
aware that institutions
within New Mexico are offering
um online
programs within their area.
Sometimes it's cost.
Um There are a variety of
reasons we didn't find
any specific survey or academic
research that would point to why
these students in particular
are taking classes outside of
their institutions, are
are outside of the state.
So I can't provide more detail
on that, but the general
reasons were what you
cited. >> Thank
you. It, it just seems
to me that Mr Chair, this
is a university that I hear more
advert in, advertised
online on TV
and everything. So I was
just wondering if that was the reason.
Thank you. Those were my questions, Mr
Shir
>> Figuero. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. Thank you for the
presentation. Sam, most
of my questions have been
asked by someone else
but on page
eight of
the report, you make reference
to potential federal
changes. I'd like to know
if you know how
likely that is and
how many
out of state
online students do our
New Mexico institutions
at how many would we
lose if
that federal law goes
into effect? We,
it says we have 11,000
New Mexicans going out of state
for online. But how many
people do we have coming
in?
>> Mr Chair, members of the committee?
I don't have that specific figure
in front of me. Last I
remember it was around 4000
students coming from out of
state into
um I don't have any
updates on changes
to the NC CE A
regulation. Um But
if that was changed,
uh it's uncertain
the impact but it would require
institutions
in New Mexico offering courses
to students outside of New
Mexico to get approval
from those states. I
think it's very likely
that institutions
would lose
students from other states due
to the administrative difficulty
of getting approved in 49
other states. Um But I don't have
to, I don't have any updates on the status
of this at the moment.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you, Sam. I would agree
to you logically, that's,
that's likely those
11,000
students
would likely come back to
New Mexico or not go
online at all if the
NCC A changes
happen.
Um So
I'm not as concerned
with that.
Um As perhaps some of
the other things in here,
page three, the
recommendations
Senator Souls
got to my question about
the differentiation of
lab space performance,
space versus classroom
instruction, space.
And we have to be clear
about requests
and space
utilization. But I think
it's entirely reasonable
to request that our
institutions
include analysis
of online
instruction predictions
and space use
when they send in
their facilities plans,
that should be part
of planning.
My question is about the
last recommendation,
joint price agreements.
Um Do you know if that
is being pursued
at this time by the
consortium? Are they
looking into it at
all?
>> Uh Mr Chair and members of the
committee, my
understanding is that they
are looking
at it um when we spoke with
them. Um but
we're still in the early stages of
this report being released, so we
haven't fully checked in
on that um When we
spoke with members of
the consortium, um they said
that it would be possible
um and that arrangements
could be made. So I, I
believe they're considering
it.
>> Thank you. Thanks Mr
Chair.
>> You any other
representative?
Thank >> you Mr Chair. Thank you for
the presentation. I I'm
going through this um
this table on, on page 11.
You know, most of those
institutions are are private
institutions.
Correct,
>> Mr Chair members of the committee.
That is correct. Yes. >> So
then that would mean Mr
Chair that
more than likely the
students are taking
out student loans to pay for
this
>> uh Mr chairman members of the
committee. That is our understanding.
Yes. >> So
then um it may be a recommendation
Mr chair and uh
to our higher ed institutions
just that's one thing that
you could really use
to, to attract more New
Mexico students is hey,
don't, you don't have to, we,
we have scholarships here that are available
to us. You don't have to be
applying for student loans. You
don't have to get into debt. You
know, we you can, you can
graduate from a New Mexico institution
debt-free as
opposed to going to these private uh
institutions and, and
racking up, you know, tens
of thousands of, of, of dollars
in student debt. So
I think, I don't, I don't know if that was
considered or maybe that our
HED or, or our higher
education institutions can
really you know, use that
as, as a
as a as leverage to
to recruit more new Mexico
students.
>> Mr chair members of the committee.
The next page page 12
includes a discussion of
that specifically and that
it notes that uh
research and
analysis has found that
reenroll campaigns for
students who dropped
out or or stopped out,
excuse me and did not
complete their education targeted
recruitment with
free tuition which New
Mexico through the opportunity and lottery
scholarships provides very
close to free tuition in many
cases
is very effective.
So that that
type of financial incentive does
seem to move the needle in terms
of encouraging students to
at least go back to school. I
can't, I don't
know for sure that it will
encourage students to
attend an in-state university
after attending an out of state
institution, but it does
seem to have an effect in this
case. >> Thank
you for that. Thank you, Mr Chair. I'm just,
I'm just concerned about, you know, student
debt that that these uh
these individuals are going to be racking
up. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Other questions, folks.
Um I had a couple of questions.
Uh The first one
was about
the students that are
taking online classes
outside of New Mexico. Um
Do we have any information
on the majors
that they may have declared
or at least course
material or courses
that they are taking
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee? Unfortunately,
we gathered this information
through the NC CE A
portal and it only
collects where
an institute or where a student is
located and where the
institution they're attending is
located. To get
that type of information, we'd have to
make individual requests to each
of these institutions
for the names of
their information
on their students from New Mexico.
And unfortunately, we did not do
that.
>> Um is
information readily
available on
the number of credit hours that they're
taking or is it
if you're just enrolled, then
you're part of the
number.
>> Uh Mr Chair and members of
the committee through NC
era. It's just if you're enrolled.
Um So there's no
discussion of how many credit
hours they're taking. It may be
possible to get that information
through another
um data
source, the integrated
post-secondary um
data source or ipads
um that the National
Center for Education sta makes
available. And if
you're interested, I can pursue that
avenue further. Um
But based on the information we have right
now, we can't determine the
amount of credits that students are
taking.
>> Yeah. No, II, I certainly
appreciate that option and
as I go through the report
a little bit more
closely and maybe something
I might, might request.
Um I had
another question about
um one of the recommendations
on page 18, um
the legislature should continue
not continuing special
appropriations for profitable online
programming. Can you talk
about what some of those special
appropriations have been in the
past,
>> Mr Chair and members of the committee
that refers specifically
to the funding
provided to N MS U
Global, which a note amounts
to about $17
million. Our recommendation
is that given the financial
viability of the N MS U
Global program, there's no
future need for future
appropriations
made.
>> And I'm sorry. Um Could you
say how much that appropriation had
been? Uh, >> I believe
there were several appropriations.
Um but it total,
it will total to about
$17 million
by fy
25.
>> Cool. Well, thank you
very much. We appreciate your
presentation. Thank you
for being
here.
All right.
So I think we have
one last. I don't
know if we're too early or if the folks
are here to take a five
minute break and we'll check in to make sure
everyone is here. Ok? We'll
take a five minute break and
check in, make sure
people are here. All
right.
Sure.
>> Oh, Bob, we're good.
Oh, cool. All
right. So we will come back
to our last presentation, folks to
micro credentialing. So, Annie,
please, when you're
ready.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Good
morning committee members.
This morning, we have a presentation
uh from PE D on
Micro Credentials.
Several of you has have
asked for an
update on how the change
to micro credentials is going.
And so we're happy to have
staff here today to
give that to you. I'd like
to introduce Burget Mauer,
Director of educator
Growth and Development for PE
D. Um Doctor
Elsie Diaz, who's the
licensure advancement coordinator
was unable to join us today because
she's sick.
Um However, we also have
Sarah mcmaster who
is also uh who is a micro credential
facilitator for pe D
as well as Lisa Wilson,
who's also a micro credential
facilitator for Pe
D and Giovanna
Leos, who's uh an assistant
principal for Las Cruces Public
Public Schools and
recently completed the micro
credentials to move from a level
two to a level three
license. And they're all here
to share their experiences
here with you today.
And with that, I will turn
things over to
BT
>> and I know it's a rare name. It's
actually
Birgit. It's, it's perfectly
fine. Uh Good
morning, Chairman
Romero and Committee. Thank
you so very much for allowing
us to present to you today.
Um As Annie had already
shared, my name is Biggi Mar. I'm the
director of the Educator
Growth and Development Bureau. Sadly
not here with us today
is Doctor Diaz. She has
some health issues and it was
really safe for, for her to stay
at home. She
is the behind the scenes
organizer who oversees
and manages all of
the Advancement
advancement placement
level micro credential
program. In her role
as a licensure advancement
coordinator and she's
collaborating with content
developers in designing
the micro credentials.
We are so excited
to share our work with
you in building and growing
an innovative licensure
advancement program for
teachers and proudly
report the New Mexico
is the only state using micro
credentials to advance teacher
licensure. In
this presentation, we
will define a micro credential
and share some of the data of
the implementation of this licensure
advancement
pathway.
The uniqueness of this pathway
advancement program
level micro credentials
or apple micro
credentials as we refer to
them are not just
about advancing teacher licensure
but also about providing
a platform for personal
growth and professional
development.
They are designed to help teachers
build, to expand their
knowledge base of
teaching and learning
and to encourage
new and experienced teachers to
reflect on their practice
through meta cognitive coaching
strategies and
questioning used by
facilitators or
reviewers assigned to
each micro credential.
Ultimately, we want our teachers
to think about the
instructional practices
and to differentiate
instructional supports for our
students in the classroom.
The understanding is that not
all strategies techniques
or resources are for all
students is critical
in improving education
for our students. In
New
Mexico.
It's not working.
You said rolling scrolling,
sorry,
wonderful world of technology.
Yes, thank
you. There
are currently two pathways
for New Mexico teachers
to adva advance their license.
One of them is the National Board
where there is no master's degree
required to move from level 2
to 3.
And the State of New Mexico
offers scholarships for
various sections. Teachers
must have taughtt a minimum of three
years to complete
the to be eligible
for the NBC
T the National Board
Certification. The
other avenue is Apple
Micro credentials.
Level three applicants must
have a master's degree,
have taught for three full
years and have three
successful
evaluations.
I still can't do
it
there. Maybe you need to do
it for me. I'm sorry,
I am not capable.
A micro credential
comprise comprises
a competency driven approach
consisting of multiple
compact stacked
courses. Each
centering on a discrete skill
or domain in alignment
with elevate NM. The
New Mexico Educator
Evaluation system.
Each stacked course is
composed of modules
encompassing content
assignments and
quizzes
micro credentials are an excellent
tool to assist teach teachers
in extending their professional
knowledge. The
flexibility can be that
they can take it as used as
needed. If there's a rich
assortment of topics covered
by the micro credential credentials
to further build professional
skills.
There's diverse
instructional techniques
where they can get informed on
methods of assessments in the
States and classroom
management.
For many, it's an affirmation
that they have learned of, of
what they have learned previously
or extend their knowledge
of prior learning in the educator
preparation
programs.
We really change the
way we teach and
we're aligning and providing
strategies to educator
evaluation and foster the
growth of high-quality,
educator,
educators and educational
leaders in
the appendices. We have a
list for you that shows the many
collaborators we have worked
with and creating
well-rounded evidence-based
courses for our
educators in New
Mexico.
And here's an example of
the building blocks of the micro
credentials. This happens to
be the very first one educators
encounter as they begin their
journey of licensure advancement
through the Apple Micro
credentials
classroom environment
contains two courses,
creating a student centered
classroom and
cultivating a classroom of
respect and
rapport.
Each course contains
five
modules.
Educators spend an average of
20 hours on a micro
credential over the course of 10
to 12 weeks. It
depends on their
personal pace
and how many of the resources
that are available within the course
they are taking advantage
of the micro
credentials are especially
for 1 to 2 are quite
quasi asynchronous.
Teachers don't need to be at a
certain place at a
certain time but
they can engage the micro
credential at their pace
for Apple 1 to 2 though
there are due dates for some
of the assignments so that
facilitators can offer
feedback and engage
with the educator on the topic
at hand, Apple
2 to 3 is more
asynchronous, but
reviewers will still
interact with feedback
and coaching. All
of the micro credentials
are on canvas. Our
learning management
system
all micro credentials have
mastery component
assignments featuring
performance tasks or
affirmation of understanding
the performance
tasks
are an opportunity for the
teachers to demonstrate the
understanding of key concepts
of the micro credential.
A master conto component
is at the end of the
course and is aligned
with elevate NM
teacher evaluation
domains
in the appendices. Also, we
have a couple of samples
showing how the courses
align with the domains.
Teachers can resubmit an
assignment within 3
to 5 days of
receiving a comment in the grade
book and an initial grade
to get a second chance if
need be to achieve
the required
85%.
All mastery components
include all I'm
sorry. All micro credentials
include a mastery component
where participates,
participants
demonstrate what they have
learned and they need
to earn a score of 85
or higher to pass
assignments relate to
the classroom practice and are
aligned with elevate
domains,
evaluation domains
throughout the micro credentials.
There's a pattern of teachers
learning a skill
acquiring and really
knowing how to use it,
implementing them in the
classroom,
reflecting on
their practices and
if need be discussing them with
a facilitator or the
reviewer for deeper
understanding, the
reflective practice and
guidance by the facilitator
or reviewer are corner
cornerstones for our
micro credentials.
They include include
research based materials.
We have coms
sample selection for
your reading enjoyment that
are high linked in here, which
of course are hard to do when you have a
paper copy in front of
you. But it is my
understanding that you will receive
a digital copy
soon.
Once an educator has
successfully completed a micro
credential, they are eligible
to take the next micro
credential. If they want to, they
can take that micro
credential right away.
Or if they have a
licensure exploration
looming over them, then they
have to take the next one right away.
But if they have time, they
really can take some time off. So they
can be some reflection
on what they have learned in the last
12 weeks, implemented
and then move on to the
next micro credential.
We have a survey which helps
us keep a finger on the
pulse on to see how
each teacher responds to
the micro credentials at the very
end of the course.
And upon submission of this
survey, the teacher receives
automatically the link
to register the next
macro
credential
advancement program level
or Apple, as we say
for short, 1 to
2 micro credentials are
taken sequentially
since they build on one
another, we have classroom
environment
the other
way.
One more.
Sorry about that
classroom environment
assessment, literacy,
multi-layered systems
of support,
culturally and linguistically
relevant instruction
and family engagement.
They refer back to each other
and build the educator's
knowledge with necessary
background as they
proceed through the micro
credentials.
There is a facilitator in
place for all
Apple, 1 to 2 participants
and they also have
a reviewer for the two to
threes, they mentor
and guide the participants to
their learning with feedback
and assignments, responsiveness
to questions and the
scoring of mastery components
which are all based on
common
rubrics.
Here's a glance at some
of our data from our
Apple 1 to 2 micro
credentials. The
completion rate averages
89.5%
which is not including quarter four
because they're just right now still
finishing of the 24
year. The
many Ns in this chart
show you how the course offerings
have grown and we now
have rounded out the
full Apple 1 to 2
micro credential program for
level one teachers to move
to a level two license.
Once teachers have completed
family engagement,
which was first offered
in the December
ending cohorts. So those were
the first group of being able
to move up with micro
credentials
um were eligible
to advance to level two.
They must have been a teacher of
record for three years and had
three successful
evaluations.
Educators who already hold
a level two license
can advance to level three
by participating in Apple
2 to 3 micro credentials
which are, which is
comprised of four
micro credentials.
The first two are
required and taken in
sequence, social
emotional learning
and New Mexico
Education Acts
after that, they can
select from a growing library
of electives
which are currently
um restorative
practice, vocabulary
development through
cognates
engaging students in
learning,
mentoring and coaching
teachers
for the
July. Now, upcoming
quarter, we have trauma
informed classrooms
joining this library
and in October,
we will add building and
sustaining, collaborative
and inclusive teams
which will contain a lot
of special education
topics. Again,
85 or higher is also
here the threshold to
pass and we have
reviewers assisted
assisting, assisting
participants navigate
through the mastery
components.
Here also is a
small selection of our
data. Um
The apple 2
to 3 is younger. So
there's fewer and A's in
there and there's fewer
courses. Um
but we also have our
first graduating
cohort if we want to call them
that way, finishing up right
now. And one of them
actually joined us here
today.
Again, you can see how we
have offered the selection
topic, how it
has grown in the last year
to offer a rich variety,
to meet teachers interests
and
needs
the benefits of a micro
credential. Gives teachers
flexibility to stretch
out the five or
four micro credentials
as it fits their schedule,
they can take 33 months
course and then potentially take
off a quarter. The
financial burden is
reduced versus one lump
sum. Teachers can pay a
$60 per micro
credentials more
easily. If
there's a need to resubmit a mastery
component, there's no extra charge
as long as it is completed
within the time
constraints of the mastery
component.
Master. Um micro
credentials are growth
oriented professional
learning with immediate
implementation in the classroom,
they can teachers can reflect
on the success of the
implementation. And if they
need to discuss with
a facilitator or
reviewer,
facilitators and reviewers
are experienced teachers.
The vast majority are level
three teachers who
are interviewed by a small
committee before they can join
the focused training
on navigating canvas
using the rubric and
scoring. They are
selected by their strengths
and content area expertise
to lend the best support to
teachers in micro
credentials. And
teachers can use what they have
learned in their micro credentials
in their PDP goal
setting in elevate New
Mexico.
And there's a team behind the
micro credential
program
in our micro credential program.
The success hinges on
the dedicated efforts of
our behind the scenes
team. Our
licensure advancement coordinator,
meticulously manages
logistics and timelines
in coordinating and
collaborating with content
developers. While the
liaisons bridge
communication among learners,
instructors and
administrators lead
facilitators and
facilitators or reviewers
shape curriculum
design and uphold
quality standards
support by facilitators
and reviewers who engage learners
directly and
ensure a dynamic learning
environment.
All facilitators and reviewers
are trained
on grading cognitive
coaching and providing
quality feedback to the
participants,
their seamless coordination,
effective communication
and expert facilitation
empower learners to achieve
their goals and
excel in their professional
journeys.
Any teacher
and any other level, one
teacher is invited to begin
as early as their first year of
teaching since our first
micro credential address addresses
classroom environment
which has content that can
definitely assist in
managing a classroom setting
successfully,
especially alternative
license or teachers who we
encourage to give their alternative
license or requirements.
Priority are
welcome to participate
in Apple 1 to 2
to supplement what they have
learned in their alternative
educator preparation
programs. Teachers
can level up after three
full years of teaching with successful
evaluations.
Level two teachers are
eligible to enroll in micro
credentials at any time
but also need to have completed
three years of teaching at the
current level before
they can level up to become an
educational leader at level
three,
Chairman Romero and
the committee. With your permission,
I would like to invite three
of the educators, MS
Sarah mcmasters, Miss Lisa
Wilson and MS Janna
Leos who would like
to share testimonials
on how the program has
impacted them. And
after the vote, we will gladly stand
for questions,
>> please, whomever may be
ready.
Welcome.
>> Hello, Mr Chair members
of the committee. I'm Sarah
mcmaster. Uh
Thank you for the opportunity to
speak. Uh
I am
currently a micro
credential facilitator. My
focus is on assessment literacy.
I also have experience with the classroom
environment. Uh But
before that I scored for the
dossiers for the PE
D. And
so when I'm
looking at the difference
um and they're vastly
different funding. The micro credentials
offers several advantages
compared to scoring dossiers
for New Mexico pe D
micro credentials allow for
continuous growth and development
among practicing instructors
as they progress and level up in
their expertise. This
model encourages
ongoing professional development
leading to more up to date knowledge
and skills by
investing in micro credentials. There's
a focus on practical real
time learning that can be applied
directly to the classroom,
benefiting both educators
and students. This
shift from a static
snapshot in time
to a dynamic system of
continuous improvement can
enhance the overall quality of
educational delivery.
Uh Funding the micro
credentials over scoring dossiers
for the PED can be a
strategic investment in student,
I'm sorry, teacher growth and
development. The Apple
Advancement Program with the micro
credentials offers meaningful
coursework along with continuous
feedback, providing educators
with valuable support as they
progress by
participating in the micro credentials
program, new and developing
teachers receive guidance from
facilitators. While
us the facilitators receive
training and ongoing support from
mentors above ensuring
we have the resources that
we need to succeed.
The program also
emphasizes effective communication
through various channels. We have
written communications, zoom meetings,
continuous phone calls. We're
allowing for personalized
guidance and
constructive feedback tailored
to individual needs.
This personalized approach to
mentorship can help teachers
uh grow professionally and
enhance their teaching
practices, ultimately
benefiting both educators and
students in the long run.
So it's just been great to see the
emphasis on supporting teacher
growth and development through
the Apple Advancement Program.
Uh This type of program can
indeed provide valuable
resources and guidance to educators
at all levels. Fostering
continuous improvement,
enhancing practices,
offering meaningful
coursework feedback,
personalized support.
This program can empower
teachers to enhance their skills
and positively impact student
learning outcomes.
Investigate investing
in such programs can lead to a more
dynamic and effec effective
educational environment for both
educators and students in the
long term. And thank
you for your
time.
I
>> good morning, Mr chairman
and members of the committee. My
name is Lisa Wilson and
I'm an elementary principal in
the Las Cruces Public Schools.
Thank you for this opportunity
to speak with you as a micro
credential facilitator,
I have just completed my third
cohort with level one
teachers working towards
achieving a level
two teaching license.
This role has allowed me to
positively influence
support and foster the
growth of new teachers
across our state which I
value deeply.
Each weeks, micro
credential assignments allow me
to draw from my 24 years
in education to provide
meaningful feedback to my
teachers. My part
participation
in the PBS, the new Mexico
priority schools Bureau Leadership
Programs over the last
four years has
strengthened my coaching abilities,
enabling me to be an effective
facilitator and
administrator. The
canvas platform we use
for this online learning is
user friendly and
provides teachers with the
chance to refine their
assignments if necessary
based upon facilitator
feedback. My
teachers are eager to learn
specific ways to enhance
their teaching skills. While
growing their understanding
of the elevate New Mexico,
our New Mexico teacher
evaluation system,
I genuinely value
how the Apple 1
to 2. Our advancement
program level course aligns
with the four domains in elevate
New Mexico. This
alignment follows a best
practice to mold new teachers
into innovative
educators which is truly
beneficial for our New
Mexico students.
Furthermore, this program
not only benefits the teachers
who are moving through the micro
credentials but also greatly
benefits me as an administrator
as I am growing
right alongside of them through
this journey. Thank you for
this for your time and
continued support of our new
Mexico LIC advancement
programs.
>> Good morning, Mr
chairman and members of the
committee. My name is
Giovanna Leos and I
will be the new assistant principal
this upcoming year at Tombaugh
Elementary in Las Cruces,
New Mexico. I
was fortunate to be a participant
in the advancement program level
or Apple 2 to 3 micro
credentials uh This
past year along with
earning my master's degree and
turning as an admin at Tamba
and being an active participant
in our state's priority schools
bureau programs as
well as our Las Cruces Public
Schools Leadership
Institute. And I'm excited
that I finished my micro credential
levels 2 to 3
this past month. So that's
exciting. Um So the
Apple 2 to 3 micro credentials
consisted of four asynchronous
courses, two were
assigned and two were choice.
The four courses I participated
in encompassed elements of
leadership that have
supported me in all paths
of my profession and will continue
to do so in my new
position as an assistant
principal. This past
year, I was an instructional support
specialist for our district working
closely with first year teachers,
new hires and
teachers who needed extra support
through coaching and mentoring in our
district. I was able
to heavily rely on my new
knowledge and resources from
the Apple 2 to 3 micro
credential coursework um
where I utilize social
emotional learning, restorative
practices and coaching and
mentoring teachers content
to support our teachers in our
district through professional
development and 1 to 1
coaching and mentoring
the knowledge I have gained from the
micro credentials has supported
my growth as a leader and
has fostered my
decision to continue
supporting teachers, students,
families and the teaching
community. I am excited
to take the next steps in leadership
as an assistant principal
and also as a new
facilitator for the
Apple, 1 to 2 courses
this upcoming year.
Um I do feel that our new
teachers need to know that
teaching is hard, but
it is the most rewarding job
on the planet. And it's one day at a
time, we are strong,
we are making diff a difference
and we are changing lives.
It's always worth it and we
can help them along the way in
their path. Um And
we can continue to be the change we want
to be in the world
um and micro credentials
is one way that we are doing that.
Thank you for this opportunity to
speak to you today
and your continued support of
our new Mexico
educators.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair,
the panel now stand for
questions. >> Thank
you all. Uh First on my list is
representative of
Moa.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Um
Thank you panel. Um
I am
more um
I can kind of follow
along. I'm currently
in the middle of taking
my uh 2 to
3. I would be done,
but I could not
bring myself to do anything
during session. So I,
I'm delayed a little bit. Um
just finished actually,
uh my um
edu New Mexico Education Acts on
Monday. So,
uh so now I think I signed
up for the mentor t uh and
coaching uh teachers
in hopes that maybe we'll uh
my school district will
get and I'll be able to do with
the, the multi uh
classroom leader
type of thing with,
but at least I can dabble it in
there. Uh But at least
know what's going on. I
really love these,
these micro credentials.
I have to say
that um
when I went to from 1 to
2, it was with dossier
and that was a grueling process
and I have really
avoided even
wanting to go to level three
because I did not want to do a
dossier. I,
I tried to avoid it.
And when I heard about these, I was like,
yes, please. Thank you, sign me
up. Um, but I, I
truly
believe that this is
a much, it's
beneficial to, to not
only the district but
the, but the teacher, um,
the two classes that I've taken
so far, the, the SCL
and, and, uh, the Education
Act, uh, have
really
have me new
goals for, uh, what
I'm gonna be doing in the classroom.
They really do. Open
my eyes to a bunch of things that I've
never thought about before.
Um I, I'm lucky
enough to have a little a
different lens because I get to
see it through the lawmaking
lens and not only
um in my, in, in
my teaching. Um
So it, it does
benefit that but
I to be able to
enhance um
teachers in this manner,
I think this is a much better
way that New
Mexico has chosen to go
rather than the grueling
process of. Uh I
mean, reflecting
on myself, I did
it because I had to,
you know, to, to, to do
the dossier. But here I
really do feel like I'm, I'm
learning something. I am bettering myself
as a teacher. Um
And, and the fact that you get
to um choose,
especially going from 2 to
3. Uh It's like,
what is it that I want to learn more?
And can I can
I uh eventually have access
to these to take more if I
don't, you know, like that kind of thing?
Because like this
is, this to me is
good professional development
that I mean, all of you that have been
teachers have sat into
professional development and you're like,
why do I have to listen to
this? Um But,
but uh but this is
stuff that actually benefits me.
This is so this is something
that um
I'm already making plans to
incorporate in my classrooms for,
for this next year. Um
And, and how can I en
enhance the ways that I relate
to my students and
um and stuff like that. So,
so I'm, I'm, I'm uh
I'm so excited that
we're doing it, did not realize that
we are the only state that is, it
is doing it this way.
So, a great job
that uh that we're, we're,
we're the first ones to do it
because, and I, and,
and I encourage any other
teachers that are listening.
This is an excellent
way to be, to be able to
advance. Thank
you,
>> represent
Garratt.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Thank you
everybody and, and thank you,
Representative Mial Moya
for sharing that. I, I
have a pet peeve for everybody
here and
that is nothing to do with
your presentation.
Uh leading the way the
first of its kind in the nation,
it doesn't have a
apostrophe after
it. New Mexico has
created an online opportunity
for educators with an
apostrophe.
I am an English
teacher and a writer and
it's not just the people
here, but everybody's
adding
apostrophes
to plurals instead
of possessives.
So attention to everybody
online and present.
Let's get our
possessives and our pearls
right end of Pet
P.
Um And some of these
things are not caught by
Google review or whatever
you're using.
Um great
uh opportunity.
Um Rah
rah, it sounds rah
rah, but I would like to
know the surveys of
the constructive feedback.
My husband always says constructive
feedback.
Um Do you have that?
Because
I know from working as an instructional
coach and hearing
from um
people in the schools
that teachers there
for three years are feeling
burdened by overwork.
They're doing
letters training and that
letters training is moving
up. Um If
they're alternative teachers, they're taking
courses. So you
mentioned that they don't have to do this
right away.
Um
There's a lot going
on and
so the micro credential
takes, I think it's was
20 hours a month.
Letters is 20 hours a
month. How
is that being dealt
with?
And, and what do
you have? What have
you learned from the
surveys?
Um Representative
Miva Moya has
really.
Yes. And
there's a lot of yes to
this. But what
are you learning?
That isn't
necessarily
yes.
And how are you handling the
workload
on
teachers?
>> Chairman Romero,
Representative Garrett,
if I may, it's 20 hours
throughout the 12 weeks. So
it's 20 hours for the three
months. Um We are
very aware of the, the
the constraints and the
stress, early career
teachers are under and
with the classroom
environment course, it really
supports them,
they learn how to
work in their classroom
and if it's something that they have already
learned in their educator
prep program, it affirms.
I'm doing this right.
We have the
surveys and surveys as they
have a tendency run the whole
gamut of Rara
and oh, no.
And we've gone through
some of the micro credentials
already and we have reduced
some of the, the burden.
We were really enthusiastic
about what we wanted them to
know and they let us
let us know that that's
a little bit too much right now.
So we've reduced the assignments
in some of the micro credentials
to make it truly
about 20 hours.
Of course, some people read
faster than others. So the 20
might turn into 25
or 15 to some of the
educators. But in
general, we are responsive
to what the
educators share was with
us in their surveys by
majority, the responses
are really, really positive,
but we have to listen
to those who are not in
favor of all. And
sadly, we cannot please
everybody, but we try to
meet in the middle
and make sure that this is as
um beneficial
to the teachers as
possible. And
um as I said,
I can gladly share some
of the, the findings we get from the
surveys. Uh But
I'm in awe
of the
educators, what
positive things they have to say
about it. Some people
are anti canvas.
So there's a lot of
because canvas isn't intuitive,
it's easy enough once you
know, but to get into
it, it takes a little while.
But um that's
why we have the facilitators
for Apple 1 to 2 and the reviewers
2 to 3 who really
help the teachers through
that, who give them
feedback, who assist them? So
that if somebody is overwhelmed,
for example, and can't
submit an
assignment by a certain due
date, we're
flexible, we're ready to
work, we want to work with them.
We're really here for them to succeed.
It's not a gotcha. It's a let me
help you. >> Thank
you, Mr
Chair. My second question is
what does a mastery
um component actually
look like?
Are there multiple ways
that that can be
done? Can you describe
what's a mastery
>> component? I'm gonna
have to um Chairman
Romero and Representative
Geert, refer to my dear
friend and liaison
whom I needed to introduce.
Anyhow, MS
um uh
Bernadette Martinez, she
works as a liaison
um for all of the
facilitators.
>> If you could in the microphone,
please.
Thank
you.
You need to make >> sure
that they didn't teach me this part.
Mr Chairman and
committee members. My name is Bernadette
Martinez, I am the Apple
liaison. And so the
mastery component
is a cumulation
of what they've learned throughout their
12 weeks. So if you can
look at at a similar
to a portfolio, we
try to provide them with
uh various ways of providing
or presenting. So
they could do a video, they
could fill out a
graphic organizer and
a lot of self reflection.
So they have three different or
four different types of uh ways
that they can present what they have
learned throughout the 12 week
coursework. So
um individuals
feel that they're more successful
in one way. Um
Really beef up what they're
writing or providing and
some feel more um
appell to do the
video. So we
try to provide AAA
wonderful way
of showcasing their
learning.
>> Thank you. So, so Mr Chair,
in other words, the
practitioner is
determining
how to demonstrate
mastery in
consultation with their
facilitator.
OK. That's correct. Uh My next
question is about writing
too many teachers
um aren't
confident about
writing, which
translates to
classroom instruction that
doesn't always incorporate
writing.
Um I station
has no writing.
Um So I'm
concerned about that writing
component. How do you address
teacher improvement
in writing? And,
and I know in the
national boards,
some teachers
are
terrific.
They're the teachers you want for
your kids, but
they're not writers and they
could not demons,
they couldn't pass their National
boards because they're writing
la. How does that
addressed in this
system.
>> Um If
I may, Representative
Romero and Chairman Romero and
Representative Garrett, just
really quickly, I get it. Yeah,
there's less than 2% of
concerns. My phone friend was a little
delayed. Um There's less
than 2% of concerns
overall in our surveys.
And um in that reference
link that is hyperlinked
in the samples is some of the
things for you to review what
the participants with the teachers
are, are asked to do.
Um who wants to talk
to the writing. I'm
sorry
for you.
And
>> uh Mr Chair members of the
committee, I did want to
say on your last question,
Representative Garrett uh
that
the mastery components
are so diverse.
This last course,
I had teachers
that are gym
teachers, pe teachers, weightlifting
is their focus or
yoga teachers and they had
to be really creative in
approaching the mastery
components and that's where the
flexibility is
amazing. Um
We have to kind of unpack
what it would look like for different
teachers at different
levels. The assignments
I saw for algebra
at 11th grade, I was like,
who don't miss that?
But teachers coming at
it, looking at it through different lenses
is it's really
amazing. Uh for
the writing as an
English major and a writing
major, I see a lot
of issues with writing
and as a facilitator,
that's something I will
note to that
teacher, hey,
watch mechanics here.
That's the wrong word
I think you meant. And
we're allowed to really guide
people. But translating
that as assignments
in writing for the
students uh that
comes across in the portfolio
they build for
us. So they
have to do an unpacking
standards and they also have
to do a sample of a lesson plan
where they really have a layered
approach, the activities,
the writing component that goes
with it. And we get to
see how the teacher
themselves are implementing
that in the classroom.
So I hope that answers.
Yeah, and it's not always
what we want to see. So
our job is to hopefully
guide enough that it
they can apply that in the
classroom.
>> Thank you. Um
Something I'm concerned about
uh Mr
Chair is the PE
D is exploring continuing
education units.
So when I hear
this and
letters and
then they're thinking of level
two teachers
having C eu it, it's
just a concern that I hope
that you'll monitor
because that's another
layer of
whatever it is
that is being proposed.
Um Let's
see.
Um
is OK.
So this
program uh Mr
Chair and, and a
team
is it to,
is it owned
by PE
D? Is there
a proprietary
aspect that's not related
to the state of New Mexico
or is this something that
we own? How does
that operate?
>> Um Chairman Romero
Representative Garrett, the
PE D owns it. We work
with um for some courses,
we work with uh consultants
or with content developers,
but they are um
paid and then it becomes
the state's property.
>> Uh Thank you for that.
Um,
and, and then my final question,
which you, you've partially
answered,
is this all one on
one? Um,
Miss Leos,
did I say I can't
even see that far anymore?
Um
How, you know, there's the
interaction you said phone
calls online?
Um, I think some of us
are tired of just
online. Is there
any group? Especially
in the 2 to 3?
Now, you've um
Miss Leos, you've been doing
coursework, which I assume
some is with
people, whether it's online or in a
classroom. So
that's happening simultaneously
as you're taking these courses.
Can you just speak or anybody
else about
the collaborative, the
collaborative aspect
of these micro credential
programs?
>> Mr Chair and members of
the committee. Um
there wasn't too much of
collaboration in our
cohort in the class,
But what we did in our district
is is when we're, you know, we
have groups of people who are working
on their micro credentials,
we team up, we talk, we
support each other. So we
kind of find our own network. We
also have our facilitators
who I was, I worked
very closely with mine this
past uh course.
Um But there is, there's
communication, there's open communication,
there's open support
and then the micro
credential facilitators
are always available.
All of the courses I took, I never
had an issue. They got back to me within
24 hours when I
would reach out to them.
So there's always an
opportunity to discuss
what I needed to with others.
Um I'm sure if I
reached out to my facilitator and
said, can we create a group,
can we create, you know, some kind
of, of cohort
to do an online discussion
or a zoom? They would have
been very open to the idea of
that. >> Uh
Thank you.
And then my last question is
more people have resigned
than retired this
year and
I'm concerned
is there any
correlation with
so much online
training going on?
Um And the fact that we
have so many young
teachers
resigning. Has
that been something you've looked
at,
>> Mr Chair,
Representative Garrett? Sadly, II,
I don't know, I don't have
an answer to that. We are
hoping and this is
what drove us to develop
these micro credential is to
give them the
tools they need to be successful
in the classroom. And when I started
teaching, I went
through the alternative route and I did
have a mentor at the time. But then
after that, here's your stuff
go teach. Um
And we really believe that
these micro credentials with the
facilitators offering this one
on one
coaching for them that
we help them stay in the
profession. Um It
falls under mentorship and
I believe there is
strong um
research
that shows that mentorship is
what keeps educators
in the classroom. So
this is really geared
towards keep keeping
teachers teaching
by supporting
them.
>> Uh Thank you. And I guess my, my
final comment, Mr Chair
is just that I, I
can see the value of
this, but we've
heard about opportunity, culture.
We've heard about teacher residencies
where it's a in
person. Um
what I call fear removal
because the actual
physical people
that you're interacting with
you build trust
in your daily interactions. That's
my final comment. Thank you. All
of you for presenting
today.
Represent
Rora.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Thank
you for the the presentation
and the, and the opportunity for
us to ask questions.
Um I went to the two
dossiers level two
to level three. And I
also get to work with districts
throughout the country where they
do different process
for uh teachers
advancing. Um
and maybe it's not micro credentials,
but there are similar things in
other states.
Um
represent Gura mentioned something that
is my concern to
if a teacher is taking a letter
training
is overwhelmed and we
hear over and over we to
hear how overwhelming that training
is,
they won't do this.
A a as
as I when I
was doing my do
as soon as possible because
I needed that
the the pay
increase especially
because I was before the
increases right now.
So that would be a
concern that the teachers
doing the letters training are
not given
the opportunity to move
while they are being trained
and certified.
Um So my question is why
not to incorporate some, some
of these trainings
as one of the
credentials require
instead of adding
to them? I mean, is the
certification that teachers are
getting in that
is pretty valuable.
No,
>> uh Chairman
Romero Representative Guolla, I I
thank you for that
question,
my apologies.
Um
Ideally the teachers
can do letters first
and the micro credentials
later, they have a
minimum of three years that they must
be in the classroom before
they can even level
up. But then there's an extension
possible for their license
all the way up to five
years. So the letters
training ideally is being
done as soon as they start teaching
in year one and year two.
So that in year three,
they can build on
that with the micro
prudentials. We are
absolutely aware. I did the letters
training too, how
encompassing it is,
but it's such a good
training and I'm glad
the state opted to make it a two
year training. And I know it was in
discussion initially to make it a one
year training. And I can
only imagine.
Um no, I can't
imagine how that would have been
possible. So the,
the the plan really is the way
it's laid out
that um they're
sequential rather than
contemporary.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um I still would like to see
some of these amazing trainings
for teachers being incorporated
and being kind of optional for
them. Um This question
is actually for Annie or maybe a
request yesterday.
Uh My question was uh what
was the, what make a teacher
high qualify or an
instruction, high quality
instruction
um in, in, in,
in the trainings? Right? So
there's training, will that make a
teacher high quality teaching
instruction
or that
training or
KGAN training? What would
make, which, which type of
trainings will uh
directly
um translate
into um instruction
into the classroom? And
I would like to have that
information if it's
available. Um
Not now, if you don't have it now.
>> But sure, Mr
Chair representative, I thank you
for the question. That's an excellent
question. Um
What I can say is that
um the
presentation that I delivered
yesterday and how to support teachers
shows that the most effective
professional development for
teachers was actually a
very long list
of aspects that
makes that effective and
leads to high increased student
outcomes. But the most
important is that it's job
embedded um and
continuous. It's in
person. It includes
um coaching and modeling
within classrooms
um overall
without speaking specifically
to content, which
um you know, working on
all those areas,
including some of the highest
returns we see in terms of
effects are teaching
students how to evaluate student,
data, student artifacts
and how to translate that into
differentiate instruction in the classroom.
But across content
areas, which of course teachers
need to know a lot of them. It's
how it's delivered and how
it's sustained. Does
that answer your question? And I'm happy to
follow up with more details. >> Thank
you. Let's follow up
with more details on that. Thank you
Mr Chair and
that follow up on on another
question, how the syllabus
are selected. So we have that
the micro gras that are
required and the
like the topics, how
are the syllabus
the course
selected or
who, who are the
consultants or how,
how we know where the teachers
are um being
being instructed
on
>> Chairman Romero. Um
Excuse me, representative
Gorila,
a lot of what we selected
were from what we could see where
the needs of social emotional
learning. Since COVID was a
really important uh
topic. The New
Mexico Educational Act, I
spoke to a colleague who
took the course and said, I
never knew.
And for, for me that was
like, that gave me the
chills.
So that was of
course, a very important one.
And it follows also with the
Yazzie Martinez. And then
for the other ones, restorative
practice, we all
know that classroom management,
especially past COVID
has been very difficult.
So all the courses that we
are offering from 2 to 3 are
really to help teachers become
educational leaders
to be effective
in their classroom and helping
as, as team leaders as a level
three is a an instructional leader
license for level
1 to 2. We were looking at
what, what how can we enrich
what teachers have learned in the
educational preparation
programs? So classroom
environment, how
do I set up my classroom? How do I
have this relationship
with my students so that they want
to learn? So they want to come to
school um assessment
literacy. What do I do with
an assessment for the longest
time teachers have just? Well, I have to take
this assessment, I have to give it to them.
And there goes, there
goes the data, we're working
with them to look at what to
do with that data, how to
differentiate and meet the needs
of the students that
after that is the multi-layered
system of, of
success for
teachers to know how to,
they know about it. They know they have
to do it but they don't know how
to. So it was very
important for us to make sure
teachers know
how to move through the
layers. After
that is culturally and
linguistically responsive
instruction, which is
more and more important
because we want to make sure
that our students are met where
they're at, that they have teachers
who they can identify
with. And then the
last one of the five is family
engagement where
it had become a
little separated
where families weren't as
included as we need them
to be. And
uh long on are the days
I hope where teachers
say, well, it was all the family's fault.
We work with the family. The
family can only help
you if they know how to because
we're teaching so much differently
now than when our
families were students.
And we have to give them to
tools, the tools to
help them, help their
Children.
>> Thank you. And I
thank you Mr Chair. And I
think this is a
great
list of topics and it has
been acting in New Mexico.
This is something that we have grown
as New Mexico. Um
No new
things in my
experience at least, but
now it's very,
very focused on,
on making this teachers advance
using this topic. So it
is, I like, I like
it all of them, especially
making sure that we understand the New
Mexico Education Act.
That that was a great thing
to have here. Thank you.
Um But still, um
my question again
is um um
sometimes I'm concerned
like uh
Miraval Moya say
being in this size. So
we become aware of other
things and, and sometimes
my concern is we bring
people from out of state
who have a different
experience with our students
and they don't have the experience
that our diversity students
have here. Um
So you mentioned
um that PD
brings it the consultants
and then they own the materials.
Um What is the process
to make sure that is
something that our
state is?
So we are not bringing something that
is very successful
in New York or in,
I don't know in Florida
or in other states,
but is not really
applicable to our, our population
here. Um >> If I
represent
sorry, General Romero
Representative Corolla, if
I may refer you to the appendices,
we have a list there
of the entities we
collaborated with and
these are all New
Mexico
entities. We are
very driven
to make sure that this applies
to us.
>> Thank you. That's great. I didn't
see that part. Thank you so much. I really
appreciate it. Um,
and the only, the last thing is,
I don't know if I was not
aware, but I
didn't know that. Um, you
are National Board Certified.
You can, you could move to level
three and you don't
need a master's degree that has
that been always part of the
process or is something new?
Because I was
>> chairman, Mayor Representative Gula
from my understanding, I
think it's always been this way, but
I am not your
perfect source of
information on that.
Yes, it always has been. Yes,
it always has been. Thank
>> you >> for
me, Representative
Gula. That's that, that piece is
actually in, in
statute.
>> Thank you should
have on my masters.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Shirr.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you for the presentation. I
want to highlight
um
for the committee and
recognize for you and the
work that you have done.
Um the difference
between our
dossier program
and this and
what stands out
is the amount of feedback given
to teachers in our dossier
program.
Teachers,
applicants did their dossier
and they got a yes
or no. At the
end
in this process, as
you've described it,
they get feedback from a
facilitator and over
and over again in each micro
credential, which
has a far greater
chance of
enhancing teacher
practice. So I
think it's a tremendous
step for the state in the right
direction. And added to
that the flexibility
for teachers to do
this um
around their schedules
and their families and
the flexibility
to focus
on their students and their
classroom and apply what they're
learning directly.
It's just such
a huge change and a huge
improvement. So,
Kudos for
that, um
along that lines, though,
I'm gonna reiterate
what some folks have said about
letters and what we're asking
teachers to do and what
we have done
as a state
is essentially said,
new teachers
in the primary grades
cannot
advance
for four years,
two years of letters and three
semesters of micro credentialing
if they go at full pace.
No pause.
Um And that
doesn't seem
um well, it
seems a bit inequitable.
I'm just gonna say uh
other new teachers at
other levels can
advance within a
year and a half.
And because that
advancement is
a pay increase,
I think we have to look
at how we're doing that
somehow
and make adjustments
that's not on you, that's on
us.
Um
But my
questions are, what's your
target ratio
for facilitator
to participant?
And are you hitting that target
now? And reviewer
to participant at the
23 level,
>> Chairman Romero of Representative
Figueroa, if I may. Um
That's a beautiful question.
I thank you for your comments about
the, the dossier
too. I get
goosebumps when I think about what
we're doing for our teachers,
how, how they're allowed to grow
and if I may correct you,
it's 15 months, if they take
them back to back. It's not quite a year
and a half. Um
And they must be in a
teacher of records for three
year anyhow. So
it's, it's gonna be just by
about 15 months between taking
two years of letter 53
months between if
I may. Um
We are aiming and right
now we have it set as
a 1 to 20 ratio,
one facilitator to
20. Generally. We
don't, we don't quite get that
many. We have about 18
on average because we
want to make sure that the
facilitator has the time
to really concentrate
on their
um participants
on the teachers because we
really want to mentor them up to
success. We know
mentorship is the ticket for
success.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you. Um Is that the same
ratio for the level
23 reviewer?
Ok. That is correct. Yes.
Thank you. I
think you're
correct. I agree with you
in that there are elements of
mentorship throughout
this and that has
tremendous potential to
help retain teachers if
we can balance the
burden.
Um
Do we have a window
Mr chair and
and panel in which
the 23
micro credentialing
series has to be done?
Can you take one and
then five years later take
another or is there
some kind of limit
>> Mr Chairman and
Representative Figueroa for
level 2 to 3? They have the
luxury of not having
to level up. And
as such, you can take one
in 2024.
And you can take the next one in
4026
and the next one
provided that we are
allowed to keep the micro credentials
around. Um
But there's no pressure,
you absolutely have the luxury
of taking a break in
between.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you.
Um
Representative Garrett got
to one of my questions,
especially for the
23
micro credentials.
We might need to take
a look at that
lateral
cohort element.
Um because those teachers
have a lot to teach one
another and that
supportive network might be
very meaningful.
So I would just
throw that into the
mix. Um
I think the rest of my
questions I'll
follow up with offline,
but thank you for your work.
This is very
exciting.
Oh,
sorry
one. Let
me, let me add this and
you might want to comment on it.
I think you want to
consider the culturally
and linguistically relevant
module being on
the list of options for any
teacher who comes in out of
state.
>> Mr Chair and members
of the committee, I just wanted to make a comment
about the collaboration
uh within the micro
credentials. Uh
You do get peer to
peer uh
discussions and I thought
that was really interesting. So
each the ones I've
scored and worked
with, they have discussion
posts where you're responding
and communicating with
2 to 3 different
educators and those educators
are all over the state.
Uh One other comment I wanted to
make with flexibility with
the micro credentials.
Um riodosa
fires occurred and
I didn't even think
but my lead sent out
an email that
flexibility for those
assignments because
those families were going
through trauma. So
you know that that is built in
and it's something I hadn't even
thought about before I got the email.
I was pleasantly surprised.
So our leads
and this program is
really thinking about the
entire family and not just
the educator but their
family, uh what
they're going through. And I'm thinking
you make great comments about the
letters training, so I appreciate
that.
>> Mm All
right. I don't have anybody else on my
list. Representative. Sorry
Nunno. Sorry.
Representative. >> Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank you for
your presentation. I thought
micro credentialing was more
technology based. So,
so I, I didn't even know
I, I've learned a lot today
so I went um
through the NBC T
side and
one of the things that probably
helped me, I see a lot of
similarities. What
helped me was
reflecting on my
teaching. One of the things we have to do is
videotape ourselves and then just tear
it apart. And
that's where I learned the most
seeing, you know, because you
think you're teaching one way
and when you watch yourself teach this,
teach, it's a little bit
different. And maybe you calling the
girls more than the boys different things you
learn just from watching yourself
teaching. Do have you, do
you incorporate something
like that into your,
your
program?
>> Um Yes. Um
Chairman Romero and
Representative
Sarinana, my apologies.
Um We absolutely do that.
We have um participants
videotape themselves
either reflect themselves
as there or they have discussions
or even discussions with the
facilitators. Um
I, I totally agree. I had
to do that too for my master's
program and it's amazing
what you learn watching yourself.
So yes, that is absolutely one
of the components of the micro
credentials. >> Thank
you. Thank you, Mr Chairman. So as
far as rigor, do you think it's
pretty comparable to national
boards
>> if, if I may respond.
Uh Mr Chairman
and members,
I'm a national board
candidate right now. So I know the
rigorous process you're speaking
of uh in classroom
environment, the teachers do
record themselves in their
classroom
and
there is a lot of reflection,
but there's not a lot of
videotaping themselves
throughout the rest that I've
experienced and
I'm only speaking on levels
1 to 2. Um
I don't believe there's other
opportunities. Now,
educators can choose to
videotape
themselves as
they go through the assignments.
That's one way for them to
submit.
But the process in
national boards that you're speaking
of, I, I don't think we
have that part
implementing right
now currently in the micro
credentials,
>> Mr Chairman, when I
did it, I did it with, there were six
of us from our school who did it all together.
And that was one thing as we picked
apart what we were doing because
sometimes you don't even see what you're doing
versus other people. It was
great because we just became this
little unit of,
oh, you know, we really
saw what we were teaching. So
I, I would recommend that if,
if possible, just to
be able to see what you do
and share with each
other. But this sounds like a
great opportunity. I
think
the being able to
take it in small chunks is a
good thing. National Board is
pretty rigorous. Um
But
thank you, I just learned a lot
here. Thank
you.
>> Comments, questions.
Um I had a couple for you
all. Um
So I'll just
preface it by saying
that I've been in the
legislature as long as I've been
teaching. Um
now and I've seen
several iterations and have gone
through several iterations
of Lester advancement.
So my first Leicester Advancement from
1 to 2 was
um my student test
scores um under the
previous administration,
um my 2 to 3
was the dossier process.
Um And then now
we have micro
credentialing, which I've heard
from um some
of my colleagues at schools,
a lot of the issues that
we've heard here. Those that really like
it, those with concerns
that we've heard here
today.
Um
And I guess I will
say for the
dossier process,
even though
it was very open ended
and I'm not the type of person that
takes well to like this open ended.
Well, can I do this?
Well, yeah, you could
and then present another alternative
and it's like, well, yeah, you could do that
also. Um I like
to know definitively, which
is one of the things that I've heard from
folks that like micro credential
is like you have to do this,
you have to do this.
Um And it's very definitive
I will say though that going through
the dossier process
um is
that it was open
ended, but also
that
I could regulate how
much time I spent on different
components. Plus it had
me think about
the long term, what I'm doing
over the course of a
semester and
what I'm doing over the course of a
year with my students.
So I had to
demonstrate what
I was planning for
and what the preparation for
that was. Then
I had to talk about the assessments,
how I'm assessing my students
um
along the way
and then what sort of materials
and how I'm compiling
data and comparing
that data. And I thought that
was one of the strengths
of the dossier
processes because I had to
really plan a
year in advance. Basically,
I had my binder with
all the materials
before the school year
started. I thought
about how my curriculum
was going to unfold
in my history class over the
course of that year,
how I was going to be evaluating
students, what I was going to be evaluating
them on um
and how I was
going to be measuring that so
that I could show in my
dossier um
all those different components.
Um And for me,
it was pretty self-paced
because I did the prep work in the
summer in preparation
for the school year and then
did the writing as I went
along. Um So for
me, it was something that
when I had a chance I
could
do
components of it when I was too
busy. Well, it was stuff
I was doing in the classroom anyway,
I just had to basically
regurgitate it on
the form, um
which was really helpful for
me. And I thought that was one
of the things with
the, the um
dossier process that,
that I really appreciated.
And I guess thinking and applying
this to micro credentialing,
um
if we have these different
classes, how are
we getting teachers
and educators, like, I think was
part of a big part of the goal
of the dossier process
to really
demonstrate
all these different aspects
of what they're doing in their
teaching practice
over the course of a
semester, over the course of a
year. How might we show
that?
How is that being demonstrated with
micro
credentialing,
>> Chairman Romero and members
of the committee? I think this is
what the the varia
the variants of the different
micro credentials really
covers. Um
And since 1 to 2
are still
early career teachers, there's a lot
of things that um
are we are supplementing
or affirming what
they have learned, a lot
of classroom environment and
assessment literacy goes into.
How are they teaching? How are they
assessing, what does the assessment
tell them and how are they implementing it
back into their lessons?
So it, it, it is
different from the dossier?
Absolutely. Um
And as
we find in the survey, when
you have some people who do really well
with the dossier and some people who do
really well with the micro
credentials. As
I cited earlier, we've
only had about 2%
of people who responded
in the survey who didn't like the
micro credentials.
Um That said we,
it's a, it's a, it's a living
document. There are certain things
if you
would like to suggest
anything else for us to
make it rounder. Absolutely. We're
open to it. It's, it's,
it's constantly evolving.
We're not saying this is carved in
stone, but
um from what we have received
in feedback from the teachers and
the facilitators, this
appears to be a very
well rounded um approach
to teacher
advancement.
>> And I, and I
guess
that would be
more of my
issue is that ensuring
that um
I think the benefit of having the
dossier was that
you are tracking that long term
progression. Like are these
educators
in the
state assessing whether they're
ready to move to the next
level of teaching
that are they,
are these educators
looking at the course of a
year? Um
Are they thinking about
the trajectory of their students?
Are they making, are they
making allowances
for the variation
in students? Because we've talked
um at our meeting here
on different topics, you
know, you might have a class of
20 students who
are
really difficult in terms
of management, perhaps
skill level in different ways
that test you as an
educator or you could
have um like
my second period, it
was a larger class, but they
were really
on the ball, really
engaged. Um And
easy to work with.
Um but they were a larger class
um in any
given year can be, can be
different. But that
educators over
the course
of
what we're looking for
are, are, are
showing that they are looking
at these different things,
measuring
um the
content, the skill level of
their students all the way
through um
the course of a year.
Um
I guess with
that in mind, would
we be able
to look
at any of the content
or be given access
to um
the content
that
our teachers looking to advance
to? Um As far
as any of these courses,
>> Chairman Romeo
Committee, there are, there
is a selection of some
of the assignments and things
listed or hyperlinked
in the presentation again once you
have it electronically.
Um and we're really
the our
interpretation of what,
what you're saying right now
is with classroom
environments, they get to know their, their
students, they get to build the
relationships
once that course
is finished, that doesn't mean the
content is finished. This
follows the teachers alar
this is now in their toolbox
of things that I know as a
teacher. And
then we have the assessment
literacy on purpose
as the second course
so that the teachers
can see how to assess and
what to do with the data that
they derive from
the assessment,
with that they learn how
to differentiate, to make sure
to track the students.
Um The MLS
S comes after that one. So
that OK, now I have
this, I have the assessment literacy,
I have the, the data
and M LS S helps them
in figuring out how to
differentiate even more.
So, um so
I,
I firmly believe
that what the dossier
gave you in one big
chunk we kind of have in
small pieces,
but they follow the teachers
along
>> and, and, and I'm glad you brought
that up because I, I do see that
as one of the strengths which
leads me to my next question
is, is
why the decision
to make this a
lic
advancement tool
as opposed to something
like me
as a level three teacher,
I can't go up unless I do
National Board Certification.
And then if I were to do National Board
Certification, and I'm
absolutely
maxed out if
we're looking at continuing
professional development,
why is this the
tool for Leicester Advancement
as opposed to
doing this for somebody like me
or somebody stuck at level
two that can
do micro credentialing? Oh, I have an
interest in in, I'm
a new inclusion
teacher and I could take a micro
credential in special
education and then tie
that to pay. So
why is a tool for advancement
and not a tool as a a
supplement
to our
licenses,
>> secretary, chairman,
mayor, member of members
of the, the the committee.
This is only the
beginning.
We are by no way
done. Um We are looking
forward to expanding
the library we have right now
for the two to threes and there
are a couple of, um,
special education courses
in there. Um
The Sky is the limit
and for right now it's a
licensure advancement, but
there is nothing that
says that we can look
into making it just as
regular continuing
education
coursework.
>> Um
And, and then my
last question, I guess is as
far as the collaborators
on this, um,
you have them all listed,
I guess I was curious as to why
the unions weren't included
as a, as a teaching
organization. I mean, we
have any Eaaft
with thousands of and thousands of
members um
with skill and
all sorts of different
areas that have provided
training for
like the dossier process
um for National Board
Certification. Why may they
may not be included
in as
collaborators
>> Sharia? I have no answer to that.
Um
Do we have,
it's, it's
we have facilitators who are
union members and the
facilitators
and we actually use their
feedback when
um when we come to that
and the, the facilitators
are trained and during the
trainings, there's
absolutely communication
about that. So initially,
I understand your
point. Uh the unions
were not involved in the
direct
um construction of the
coursework, but they are a
part of the implementation
>> and, and if this is something
of a living
moving forward,
we're continually calibrating
this. So then there is room to
add other groups
and other collaborators into
this. That's what I'm
hearing?
Cool. Well,
thank you all so much for your
presentation and being here
um with
us, we appreciate it. Thank
you. >> Thank you, Mr,
chair members of the committee.
>> Uh All right.
So our next meeting
folks,
July 24th
to the 26th. It's in Los
Alamos. Um
Obviously we have a
special session
July 18th which
uh anybody want
to take a stab at what we're
doing.
Um Then
I was sorry, excuse
me, but anybody want
to take
a, I'm just
gonna stop.
Um
but pending
are
um
uh special
session,
we'll see what we're doing.
Um As far as
the meeting, obviously,
our LES C team
very much has that on the radar.
Um
So if
anything does come up or plans
change, obviously,
um they'll let everybody know
represent Gula. >> How
are you saying we can take the train, Mr
She to go to a special
se we have plan
yesterday,
>> we can take the
train,
the train from?
That's
definitely do that. I don't know
how long it's going to last >> Mr chair.
Can we send? Thank you
that, that
hilarious unique
train ride
the dinner.
It's unforgettable.
I will. Can we send an
official? Thank you to.
>> Definitely, we could put that together.
Thank you for that.
It was a wonderful evening.
Um Thank you to our LES C
staff. As always,
the meetings were fantastic. The agenda
was great. We certainly
appreciate all your hard work in putting
together everything
from where
we're sitting now to
all of the briefs and the information
and the work that you all do, um
each and every day on our
behalf.
Um And as
I always say, saving ourselves
from us. Um
So thank you for that.
Uh We'll see you all
at the special session and
then in Los
Alamos afterwards, like I mentioned,
um, if anything comes
up, you'll
be the first to know. So thank
you all. Safe trip home.
