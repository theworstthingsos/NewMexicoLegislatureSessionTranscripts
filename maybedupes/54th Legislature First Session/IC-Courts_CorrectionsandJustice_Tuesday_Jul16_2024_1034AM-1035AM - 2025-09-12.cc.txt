At 10:45 have a briefing
scheduled on some Supreme Court
cases that are relevant to us, I
think as a legislature and as a
state, so why don't we take a 5
minute break. There is some
dessert um in the, in the back
room, um, posing as doughnuts,
and donuts and um one other
thing, we are gonna have lunch
brought in, so I jiggered the
agenda a little bit, um, Namoga
is gonna be bringing in some
lunch. I know.
However, I'm sure nobody, but if
you don't want to eat it, you
don't have to, but we will be.
Thank you.
Oh.
