beloved staple within the land

told on a slightly smaller bun
offering the perfect meat, uh,
to, to bun ratio.
Here to celebrate with us, uh,
With that, I would like to
introduce my guests, except they
don't have their names right
here and my memory slipped a
little bit, but they rise, Mr.
Ladies and gentlemen, I said I'd
like to thank and to welcome our
guests who serve us the
wonderful meals what a New
Mexico tradition, Brian and
Mr. President, and, and people
don't know the amount of people
they employ in New Mexico, the
amount of structure they have to

we're a small population, uh, I,
I wonder what the, Mr.
President, maybe you could help
me guess this question.

and then maybe we can ask him
that question. Thank you, uh,
Senator. I'll I'll take a guess.
I would say at least.
20% of the sales do go up during
the legislative session and
remember on Taco Tuesday, I
think it was Taco Tuesday, your
tacos disappeared.
So I ordered 10 extra Blake's
hamburgers yesterday. Forgetting
that we're gonna have Blake's
everything you do and great
hamburgers, a lot of us were
raised on Blake's. A lot of us
had a lot of fun there when we
had the outside patios and the
umbrellas and, and we're outside
Cerro Gonzalez
Thank you, uh, Mr. President,
how they're living.
But to uh
there's always a line. It, it
always is busy. So, you know,
it's just a matter of uh
You know, what time of the day,
but you know, you always see a
big line in that lake, so with
to comment on the lot of burgers
and I have to say, Mr.
President, as you heard when,
uh, Senator Munoz was
introducing our guests they this
did start in the South Valley.
We call it South Valley USA that
those in mass production and
they do such a wonderful job. We
were talking to the owners
earlier and they can tell us
right down to the 1/8 of an inch
what they're doing with the
burgers and the buns and the
this and the that and they were
the Lotterberger had actually
changed hands, um, I guess about
a maybe 15 years ago.
or something, and we're just so
glad that they're back to New
Mexico hands because I think

Munoz was, so I've been eating a
lot of burger all day today, Mr.

to explain how that will work,

the table and I'll give everyone
a sense of what we're gonna do
tonight.
Thank you, Senator.
calendar process, uh, it's
pretty much the same as it's
been, but to kind of give you an
idea in terms of what it
been working on this, uh,
reviewing the bills, trying to
go ahead and get bills that are
less contentious or that
hopefully can be explained
within the 5 minute process and
governor, so at the start of
each bill.
Uh, he'll start the, uh, shot
clock, and there'll be 5 minutes
in order to go ahead and go
the bills.
And then from there the
president of course will
indicate no objection and it's
so ordered if there isn't any
objection, and then from there
um, I'm sorry, uh, let's see.
I think it's reversed, yeah,
thank you very much, Senator
Bergman.
So I, I just had a couple of
scripts here, so, uh, Senator
president uh will go, uh take
the vote and then after the
vote's taken the president will
go to the original sponsor, uh,
the original sponsor will
indicate, uh, thank you, Mr.
out.
I ask each of you to please take
a look at it and if there is a
so that through that process,
um, if it's gonna be talked
through that period we can let
them know and we don't have to
go through that 5 minute, uh,
uh what will indicate, of
course, um, you know, time is up
and then if that happens, uh,
the bill will go back to the
That is the final step, it's
very important uh for all of us,
uh, to try to support the
process again, otherwise it goes
so. So, uh, Mr. President and uh
to the majority leader that in
essence is uh what it what it
does, um, and again to go back,
so Senator Tobiasson we'll go
And then Senator Bergmans will
go ahead and close.
The vote will be taken and then
the president will go back to
There's still an ongoing list.
Excuse me, there's still an
ongoing list and so if
everything works out this
leader, that would be part of a
calendar for tomorrow, so that's
basically what it does, Mr.
President.
Thank you, Senator Campos. Thank
you for the explanation before I
go to the consent calendar I'm
just to, just a quick minute if
I could, uh,

gonna use much like the GSA

not a requirement, but that's
something that we could um look
at during rulemaking on DFA.

Why do they require

And the fact that we have to
support these projects with

I, I would say it is economical.

assist in the systems when we're
talking anywhere from 20,030.
To 300 of these small systems,
once again, these are on public

communities don't have to pay

anymore?
They're getting clean renewable

And that is these systems have
approximately 25 year lifespan.
And the energy saved.
The cost of the system would,
would that be an accurate
description of the economic.

think that is kind of a

also a huge benefit.

Mr. President, with the
gentleman yield for a quick
question?
Senator Pope do you yield. I
yield, Mr. President.
Mr. President, Senator, earlier
I said 25 years and possibly
longer and, uh, they have a

have been tested in 104 degree
Senator, then, uh, and I
understand that they're
warrantied, but I'm just curious
is how long have they been?
Senator, um, this technology has
been around for a while and so
um they've been doing this for
over 30 years.
Mr. President, Senator, that's
the number I was looking for, 30

Senator Lopez.
Mr. President, I think that that
makes sense to allow the law
enforcement officer who needed
to respond to an incident, but
Mr. President, a lot of people
find the presence of firearms
intimidating and this bill isn't
clear that a commission law
enforcement, it isn't clear
think that's necessary if it's
to let law enforcement officers
use their firearms to respond to
an incident. Again, I don't
think that's necessary because
police officers um are
Thank you, Senator C Lopez.
Senator Brantley. Thank you Mr.
President, I understand this
concerns of the sponsor, um,
who, who was with me here today,
because for security reasons,
and so I'm going to Senator
Sadilia Lopez, if you wouldn't
mind, uh, yield to Senator
Wirth, who was the sponsor of
this bill, I should mention that
I support.
Uh, Mr. President, I do. And in
the original piece of
legislation, we did include an
exception for certified law
enforcement officers and the
performance of the officer's
officers law enforcement agency.
So those were in the original
bill. So what the bill didn't
do, there's a different class of
commissioned law enforcement
officers like a game and fish
that through and realized, no,
no, that's, we wanna make sure
they have the power to arrest. I
think there are scenarios too
where polling places get set up
next to law enforcement and so.
discussed this, these changes,
and I was fine with them up
front and again, I think this is
just a small, uh, it's not even
an expansion, it's just a
clarification, making sure that
floor.
Mr. President, I er Lopez if she
has further questions. Thank you
Senator Cio Lopez, Mr.
President, I guess I need to
understand the difference
between a certified, it it just
between a certified officer. My
understanding is certified
officers are certified to carry
a gun. Um, so what's a
commissioned officer, is that
somehow different than someone
gun. There are also other
exemptions, gay and
officers there may be some
military exemptions, corrections
officers, and so we are not
And Cio Lopez.
Mr. President, if I understood
the sponsor correctly, you can
be commissioned before you're
Mr. President, you can be
commissioned before you are
certified.
Mr. President, may a
commissioned officer be allowed
commissioned officer can carry a
gun.
That's not what I understood you
to say, but I, I understand
that. So a commission officer.
be able to carry a gun to go
vote again, I don't understand
why they can't leave their guns
in their.
Uh, vehicle locked, Mr.
President.
Thank you, Senator Cel Lopez,
Senator Brantley.
Mr. President, to clarify that
exactly the loophole that we are
current law, they could not.
Thank you, Mr. President. I, I
think that B 1 and 2 address the
For many people, someone
carrying a gun at a polling
place is a very intimidated
action, intimidating action and
so for that reason, I don't
sponsor would yield
what?
Thank you Mr. President. Thank
you, sponsor. I just want a
little clarification around
something that was brought up in
these exemptions that we're
adding say in performance of the
officer's duties as well, so I
want to be clear, are we saying
Senator Bradley, Mr. President,
and thank you, Senator. To
clarify, it is in response to a
call or within the acceptable
100 ft of a polling place
Mr. President, with the sponsor
you Senator Brownlee,
Mr.
President, doesn't, doesn't
currently law enforcement
allowed to carry weapons
anywhere they need to go, uh,
when they're on duty or off duty
Mr. President and Senator, it's
not. This is to close a loophole
that would allow a law
enforcement who has a weapon
Uh, I know federal agents can
carry their their guns on
airplanes, uh, they, they have a
badge, they go through a special
check, they inform them, uh,
commission law officers are
Surely they don't have to leave
their weapons in their car right
now to go to a polling place,
uh, to vote. I don't think
that's correct. I mean, they
badge on them and, and, uh,
without any breaking of the law.
Thank you Senator Munoz. Mr.
President, Senator, this is an,
uh, to clarify a loophole that
out for the moment, but it is
just to clarify a loophole in
the bill to correct that.
Thank you, Senator Brantley. Mr.
President, a commission officer
is not a certified officer then,
So Mr. President, the dogcatcher
can carry a gun.
Uh
In some jurisdictions, uh, other
the, the security guards are
guess, but aren't certified to
carry a gun or allowed to carry
weapons. So how, how many people
are this gonna affect?
Thank you, Mr. President, and if
officers, corrections officers
are still not excluded in this.
Mr. President, Senator, how
many, how many non-commissioned,
non-certified officers are there
Mr. President, how many total in
the state, Mr. President, I
think that would depend on the
jurisdiction of law.
Mr. President, yes.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator,
just, uh, a question. I'm just
trying to really understand what
we're trying to solve here. We
understand, I think in the
Expand it to commission
officers, what is there an issue
going on? Is there a threat at
polling places? I, I just don't
understand why we need to expand
it.
force and so they may
potentially respond to an
incident at a polling place
because of that.
Senator Pope, thank you, Mr.
Senator Bradley, Mr. President,
exactly because there is a sort
of a law enforcement
specifically in rural New
Mexico.
answering my questions and you
know I I think I wanna echo just
some of uh center Cia Lopez what
she was talking about a little
bit and this is not to uh
why we did the legislation in
polling places and we can just
go back to history and.
Intimidation and things like
that, so I just want us to
really be careful with what
Mr. President, thank you. I
appreciate the concerns. I
should echo that I actually
voted in support, there should
not be firearms in polling
what this is doing is this is
clarifying and is, is, is
closing a loophole of that bill
that will allow for law
enforcement officers who respond
be able to, of course, retain
their weapons and so, Mr.
President, I move that House
Bill 101
now passed and I ask unanimous

Until last year, New Mexico was
one of only 11 states in the
nation that had no oversight
whatsoever over these
transactions.
Senate Bill 15, which gave the
state temporary oversight for
one year over these
transactions.
We worked with, uh, a broad
range of stakeholders, including
hospitals, to craft SB 18.

Again this time, we spent the
last year working closely with
hospitals, hospital
meetings, meeting with hundreds
of stakeholders across New
Mexico and Albuquerque, Gallup,
Almo Gordo, Las Cruces, Las

these meetings were designed to
advocates, and community leaders

been changed since the earlier
Senate version, um, and Senator,
if you wouldn't mind yielding
just a couple of questions real
quick.
Senator dey. Yes, Mr. President.
you've now moved that to the
secretary of the Health
Authority, is that right?
Senator, yes, Mr. President, in
most states where they do this,
the authority rests either with
their version of the the HCA or
vesting that much authority to
the superintendent of insurance,
um, and again with the secretary
here, we would have as the
Senate, the right as you as the
chair of the rules committee, we
have an understanding, Senators,
you talked about the fact that
in this process, the secretary
has a great deal of review
authority for applications and
sales and so forth. Am I correct
Senator Mr. President, yes, uh,
uh, transaction would be
reviewed if it appeared from the
review that the transaction was
going to harm healthcare in New
conditions, uh, to preserve
healthcare in New Mexico, then
in that rare instance, the
secretary would have the ability
to disapprove the transaction.
I'm thank you Mr. President.
Senator. So thank you for
and investor in various things,
when you have somebody else who
controls your ability to sell an
asset. It's referred to as a
worth $100,000 is really valued
for tax purposes maybe about 1/3
of that, uh, because I can't
sell my 3rd interest very
easily. There's not a lot of
people who want to buy a 1/3
their ability to sell themselves
on an open market is now subject
to the determination of a
secretary of Health, and that
would mean that the value in my
experience would
would want to have their asset
devalued that way unless I'm
misunderstanding how the market
works and so, um, as the center
pointed out when I visited with
her last time around, I said,
sell their asset and that they
should willingly agree to doing
that, but they seem willing to
do so, Senator. So as I told
you, I voted, I voted last time,
I think, uh, with you, and it's
not my job to try and tell folks
to do so today continues to
puzzle me, but I'll certainly
support the your bill if, if it
doesn't concern them, I must be
missing something. Thank you,
Mr. President. Thank you,

this is trying to when these

me and and I don't think it's
the American thing to do. Thank
you, Mr. President. Thank you,
Senator Brown. We have Senator

question would be, why the

Attorney General.

trying to say, it's an unfair
trade practice.

it's not just an unfair trade

Give me a brief explanation of
what is right for New Mexico.
Senator
Essential services are not
eliminated.
We keep on seeing uh labor and
delivery services being shut
down, especially in rural
eliminated because they are not
profitable. In fact, they're,
they're pretty expensive, um.
What is right for New Mexico is
transactions like this happen,
uh, the cost to patients aren't
ratcheted up 300%.
Um, the private equities impact
equity in January of just last
year, 2024, there were 386.
That's a 19% increase in one
year.
it's 30, it's 38%. We are almost
5 times the national average.
We are
We have made it very, very easy.
For folks to come in.
the way they do these deals is
they stick they purchase it and
and the debt, they stick the
hospital with the debt.
And then at an average of 7
they leave the hospital, our New
Mexico hospitals with that debt.
That is a terrible deal.
For New Mexico hospitals. It's
Massachusetts last year, uh,
just like about a week ago, it
happened with a ton of hospitals
in Florida.
So what's right for New Mexico,
Mexicans, or at least does not
harm.

Woods. Thank you, Mr. President.

You know, we hear this, we hear
because I see cost rising to the
patient, but I see cost rising
to the doctor. I see cost rising

negotiates that cost down to
bare minimum, just get her all

Mr. President, one of the things
that has happened over the
things that I heard over and
over from doctors who were
working in hospitals that had
been uh.
Purchased by private equity was
that they made um for profit
reasons and they didn't like
that. Now, most of the doctors
said that they were just gonna
leave. They didn't have to put
up with it because doctors have
Mr. President, yes, and so one
of the really valuable things
about this process that we went
through over the last year, was
showing up at all of these
meetings, uh, and really wanted
us to hear what they have been
dealing with and, and it is
exactly what was mentioned that
they, their relationships with

motives, but this bill uh

Sinner C Lopez, thank you, Mr.

found, there's a case, Mr.

general of California because
they were reducing access to
care. They were raising prices.
There is a lot of damaging
effects that can happen when you
And Mr. President, Senator, is
that's kind of what's driving
this bill is, you know, the
understanding of the negative
side of what can happen.
private equity is not inherently
evil.
Uh, we're not saying we don't
want them here in New Mexico. We
just wanna make sure that
And um
And, you know, quite frankly,
Mr. President, New Mexico, New
Mexico is vulnerable. New
Mexicans are vulnerable. We have
we've done a lot to shore them
up, but we cannot afford to
have, to have things go the
opposite direction, um, and so I
think this bill is just a really
effect. Thank you, Mr.
President. Thank you, Senator
Steinbor Senator Scott.
Thank you, Mr. President. Well,
What event occurred in New
Mexico.
That precipitated the need.
For this bill
And do
mine or top of mind was there
was a, a transaction, uh,
Presbyterian was going to sell
have been no one in New Mexico
for Presbyterian making
decisions about what healthcare
New Mexicans would receive, um,
now that.
Transaction also included,
superintendent of insurance, um,
and that transaction did not
complete, but that made very
clear
the vast majority of the other
states in the nation, New Mexico
is particularly vulnerable.
Then soon after that, Stuart,

Senator Scott.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator,
isn't there a transaction that
did.

Could you describe what that one
was?
Senator,
so Mr. President, if you're
did not provide reproductive
health services before they were
acquired by Chris. I will say
when we went to Almo Gordo, uh,
to have a community meeting
insurance was no longer
accepted. Um, suddenly, suddenly
everything had changed and they
had no idea why or what was
happening. Uh, the only thing
That was it. We did not hear a
complaint. It was uh about other

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank
you Senator. So it just sounds
to me and I've, I've really been

Houston. My new son-in-law, they
were married this year. He's
worst place in the country to do
medicine because of medical
malpractice.
And so we sat at the kitchen
table and he said, Dad, we want
to come back, but everyone's
telling us, and we're hearing in
the news that New Mexico is the

this great thing called Google.
And Google, the states which
have caps and which states do
not have caps. New Mexico is one
look at the rating of states and
the uh malpractice claims and
the damages. It's easy to
compare other states and our
laws, and you'd find that New
Mexico is solidly in about the

indirectly does.
Because we do harm. I just hope
members understand we do harm to
young people like my daughter
and my son-in-law, and we worry
about doctors who are leaving.
And when they see reports and
studies and propaganda effective
at fundraising, of course, that
that New Mexico is the worst
place they hear that and
it and I'm proud to say I think
they're coming back to New
Mexico next year.
Uh, and they're doing so with
their eyes wide open, Mr.

that I stand for questions.
senators we're debating House
Bill 295.

Senator Y Bergman's. Yes, Mr.
President, but before I do that,
can I ask unanimous consent that
my experts join me?
I have Lynn Moteer from
Rita and Jeremy Turner.
I see no objection, Sergeant
what benefits this bill
provides.
Uh, you're experts.
Senator Bergmans.
A governmental agency of the
state.
Has transmission lines that run
all over the state.
And the transmission lines on
the Rita property are not
think it goes a little deeper
than that based on.
My review, um.
Why would, well, it's.
Senator Bergman, Mr. President,
Senator, yes.
It would depend on the
situation.
Senator Townsend.
Well, there's no situation that
eminent domain, um, Mr.
private landowner with or
without their permission.
Did you realize that?
Senator Bergman, Mr. President,
Senator, yes.
Senator Townsend.
And
helps a private entity.
Turn
Um
profits.
By by having an entity like the
federal government like the
government.
In your hip pocket when you're
Tinderbergmans. Mr. President,
Senator, in all of the years
that Rita has existed, they've
never had an eminent domain
situation and in the situation
compensation.
But
I would bet you, um,
That
Having that tool.
What, what that the power of
that Rita tool is very.
Very beneficial.
Let's move on a little bit. What
about the business plan.
Uh, fractional.
Uh, interest, is that correct?
Senator Bergmans.
And Mr. President, um,
Senator
Did you realize that this had
been sent to the voters
Senator Bergman, Mr. President,
Senator, that was in 1976 and
this Rita authority was passed
by this body in 2007.
Senator Townsend.
The how how Rita utilizes this.
Senator Townsend.
Mr. President, the
Attorneys, uh, that I've been
talking to, um,
Tells me that
same mechanism basic mechanism
as an IRB in order to obtain tax
exemptions.
This tax exemption.
Mr. President, Senator, at
presentation by
You're
On many publications that they
already have this right.
But they're here today, Mr.
President, asking for it to be
put into the statute. Why?
Been interpreted and we are
simply codifying the status quo
in the statute.
Senator Townsend, Mr. President
and Senator, why is that
important?
President, Senator, that's
because there is currently a
lack of clarity, and we want
this to be as clear as possible.
Mr. President, Senator, it
could, but this is again, simply
just clarifying what is already
I would
I believe that one of the
biggest drivers.
That
The body has to realize.
And what we are doing in this
process.
is we are taking.
They are exempting themselves
from taxes, taxes that New
Mexico taxpayers then have to
put into the coffers to offset
Mr. President,
Senator, can you explain to me
why?
Senator Bergman's.
Mr. President, senators, since
this, since Rita is a
entity of the state essentially
and that Rita owns the land,
that land cannot have property
Jobs and.
That's all.
But Mr. President, Senator,
Are payments made in lieu of
Mr. President, Senator, the
transmission lines.

not.
The generation of the power do
I know you're carrying this, so
I'm trying to not be.
To horsey with you, but Mr.
Which Rita is the owner of there
is no property tax.

happening here is you have
that does bring many different
benefits to communities all
across New Mexico.
Senator Townsend, Mr. President.
Senator, what.
smaller benefit than those
communities would get
If
They were
Appraised at full value. Would
you agree with that?
utilizing the reader tool that
they are exempt, is that
correct?
Senator Bergman's.
Mr. President, Senator, yes.
When you have a, a private
entity.
Utilizing.
A transmission line.
It's a little bit off the
subject, but I'm, I'm gonna go
there anyway.
This tool
is being utilized to to
New Mexicans and that's what I
want.
The Mexicans to understand is
that.
This is
A subsidy.
that, thought Mr. President. I
think they want to know.
That that
is not a good use of their
taxpayer dollars.
Senator
With this Rita tool.
And what does New Mexico get out
of it?
Senator Bergman, Mr. President,
Senator.
They get transmission lines,
which helps move the power that
and dairy products. We are using
this public-private partnership
to export our wind power.
Which brings
Multiple gross receipts,
benefits to local communities
With the subjects as a whole.
Most of these lines are built
with IRBs that exempt.
grocery receipts tax, which the
state forgoes.
On, on a, on, let's say on a
billion dollar project.
receipts, would you agree with
that?
Mr. President, Senator, not on
transmission lines, IRBs do not
apply to transmission lines.
Did that answer your question,
Mr.
Mr. President and Senator,
Mr. President, Senator Henrita
projects, that is correct.
But Mr. President, and Senator,
on projects that are not Rita
IRBs are used for transmission.
Senator Townsend.
Mr. President, Senator.
The issue
10 or 15 years ago, probably
needed some help.
And subsidies.

Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr.
President, will the
good senator yield for a couple
of questions.
Senator Bergman's yield.
Scott.
And what I would like to try to
do, Mr. President.
I put some numbers.
On the.
Can you tell me what the total
Dollar value of the
construction.
Project that would be subject to
And Bergman, Mr. President,
Senator for the Sunzia
transmission it'd be around $1
billion.
Senator Senator Scott, Mr.
OK, that's fair enough.
And under normal circumstances.
a billion dollars of
construction.
would generate.
Mr. President, Senator, that's
not a number I currently have.
Senator Scott.
Well, Mr. President, we can use
And 5% of a billion dollars
would be Mr. President and
Senator, can you do that math
for me?
Senator, that's perfect. So, uh
if this project had been
constructed without the reader.
Of gross receipts tax to the
people of New Mexico.
Now
That billion dollar project
would have.
A nominal value.
value for assessment purposes of
a billion dollars. Is that
correct?
And Bergmans Mr. President,
The fact is, the product, the
project is.
Uh
How much is that in property
taxes.
In, uh, one year period.
Mr. President, Senator, let's
call it $500,000.
So
Mr. President,
And Senator, if this project,
For construction, $50 million in
gross receipts tax, and then
Mr. President and Senator, there
is no question.
That this is some form of
So Mr. President,
And Senator, the, the folks that
build pipelines, the folks that
The folks that construct
Those folks do that on the
basis.
Of
The economic value, the return
on that investment.
The state of New Mexico. And Mr.
President,
Senator, can you tell me where?
Senator Bergmans.
All the, in the future there
will be the potential to also
power New Mexico.
And here Scott. OK. Thank you
for that answer, Mr. President.
So,
receipts tax, $500,000 a year in
property tax and are not today.
Going to receive any of the
benefits of that power because
it's going to Arizona and
to those folks because it
appears as though these
transmission lines are largely
Positively impacting them, not
us.
There are many benefits still to
the people of New Mexico.
Including 303 million in tilts
over the lifetime of the Sunzia
farms will pay 18 million in
pilots over the lifetime of the
project.
And
And 100 million in state land
leases.
Even with respect to jobs.
However, once those once those
transmission lines are built.
In comparison to the tax
benefits that are accruing to
this project.
This is bad public policy.
It's corporate welfare, and we
don't need to be participating.
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.
um, I'm gonna make a unanimous
consent motion here.

you, Mr. President. Senator
Lopez, that's the only, uh,
change it does, but you have to
change, uh, 12 months to 15
months and.
2 years to 27 months.
Mr. President, what is the
justification for this extension
of time.
Thank you, Mr President Ser
Lopez, once again, that was a
House amendment, uh, but it was
the right road, get the services
that they need maybe complete a
program or two and uh and 6
months uh.
Was
Amended into the bill.
Mr. President, Mr. President
Serioil Lopez once again it's a
House amendment and, and it was
extended from 90 days to 6
months.
Mr. President, so you don't know
do, but the policy is sound. The
policy is sound, essentially
when someone is, uh, leaves jail
when a juvenile leaves jail, uh.
There's
to deal with that young person
to reintegrate himself or
herself back into the community
and so uh 6 months of
supervision programming support
Uh, they will be available, Mr.
President. Senator Lopez, if
this bill passes because we're
changing the definition of
adjudicated delinquent to youth
and we're freeing up $6.1
million from this fund that
If that were correct, wouldn't
it say that the judge must order
services instead of may order
services
And you're correct, it is a may,
but the judge may order services
or program participation as a
condition of probation, that's
not currently in statute, and I
supervised, they're, they, and
they're uh.
And it's a juvenile system once
again it's not like parole or
whatever and so this these
systems want the young person to
survi want to succeed.
Mr. President, if this bill were
about helping juveniles succeed,
why would a 14-year old ever be
treated like an adult.
person died.
Mr. President, of course, a
person died, and that's a
tragedy, Mr. President, but the
kind of crime that is not about
intention to kill.
And so this bill and for that
reason alone, although there are
prefrontal cortex that that that
there is some 114 year old that
could be treated like an adult
in a juvenile system which is
supposed to be about
that the bill was bad, so bad,
and until I saw some of this
stuff.
It looks like there were
amendments that brought
Unsuccessful bills in the house.
Looking at these bills that were
bad policy, for example, 434 was
rejected, which is one of the,
because of an amendment in the
house.
Um, and then this youthful
offender expansion.
I believe is, is really bad
bill.
And I simply can't support it.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Senator Cila Lopez. We have an
amendment, the reader to read.
Amendments sponsored by Senator
Linda M. Lopez.
Senator Lopez to move the
amendment.
Uh, Mr. President, I move Senate
Mr. President, um, what the
amendment is proposing is to
essentially strike um from the
title.
Strike pages 3 through 7 and on
page 8 strike lines 1 through 9.
And Mr. and then, of course, Mr.
President, you remember the
because, um, actually as Senator
Sah Lopez was uh previously
discussing.
Section 1 of the bill exposes
more children to the harms of
that prioritize rehabilitation,
Mr. President.
And community safety.
Uh, research shows, Mr.
President, that prosecuting
to increased risks of harm that
further uh entrenches them in
the criminal legal system.
Um, Mr. President, there's also
a statutory gap.
President, inappropriately.
On adult sentencing of youth as
a public safety tool.
Um, Mr. President, it instructs
And in many instances, Mr.
President, um, this child could
be sentenced as an adult and
then has to be held in solitary
when we talk about.
Um, voluntary manslaughter and
of course Mr. President it's,
it's uh.
An act, of course, it's not
provoked.
So with that, Mr. President, I
will stand for questions. Thank
you very much, Senator Lopez.
I'm going to Senator Maestas,
uh, to consider whether this is
It's very persuasive, I think in
and of itself.
Uh, we were.
It may, it may prove merit on,
Uh, and everyone is, is
participating in the in the
creation of this bill, you know,
democracy is is inefficient
it's.
It's a bummer, but if, if this
are more important, frankly, if
if a if a if a 14 year old as
you described commits.
gets convicted of voluntary
manslaughter. One is you're
the in the uh juvenile system,
uh, and frankly the sentence on
uh voluntary manslaughter, um.
Maestas. We're on debate,
discussion, uh, or even just
making a statement in regards to
this particular amendment. I'm
going to Senator Woods on the
amendment. Senator Woods,
was last night.
Where some kid was riding around
and they ran right over the top
of it.
A guy that was on a bicycle.
Joy riding.
It seems to me that it's a, a
possible good possibility that
the, the, the state, the people
in the state of New Mexico.
have finally come to the point.
And let them just keep getting
worse and worse and worse.
I'm, I'm totally rejective of
this amendment.
Fact is, I would be more
for the citizens of the state in
Mexico on this one.
Thank you very much, Senator
Woods. We're in discussion of
the amendment.
Going to Senator Pinto. Senator
Pinto please. Thank you, Mr.
So Mr. President and Senator, do
we know anywhere that uh life is
guaranteed.
Senator Lopez, Mr. President.
know where life is guaranteed
that we will live our whole span
of life.
Mr. President, Senator, nothing
is guaranteed.
So Mr. President and Senator.
So that is uh mid school I might
correct.
Mr. President, yes.
So Mr. President and Senator at
know for registration for
school, but they would, if
you're 15, it should be maybe in
high school as a 9th grader.
Differentiated by age.
Because of the development of
the child.
The difference uh or what a gel
in some sense broadly appears.
Senator Lopez.
please describe the, the two.
Mr. President, um, I'll use the
metropolitan Detention Center
that I'm familiar with in
Albuquerque.
over at the what we call the
Youth Services Center in
Bernalillo County.
So Mr. President and Senator,
these facilities, do they have
the youth Services Center, I did
have a tour of that um last
summer.
Uh, there are windows in each of
the pods, uh, the children will
that's pretty much all concrete.
I've not been to a tour for that
one, but um I know it is
concrete with not very many
windows around.
Mr. President, there are
expense, which much more than
that.
So Mr. President and Senator,
We're hearing this session.
addresses an adult, um, not
securing their vehicle to make
sure that there is an underage
driver.
Driving the vehicle. Do you
recall that Senator?
recall any bill either that
addressed the um not securing a
firearm. Am I correct, Senator?
we have a bill addressing the
access to controlled substances,
um, in which if an adult um
sells or distributes to a minor
that we are increasing the
issue, yes.
Uh, Mr. President, senator, is
that this particular session.
Senator, um, not that I recall.
Some of this reckless driving,
you know, all these, uh, even
alcohol.

Exceptions if it's the parent
or, but if there's someone
giving children access to

the children.
Mr. President, yes.
Mr. President and Senator, do we
know?
If

distance to their residents.
To mental health services.
Senor Lopez, Mr. President,
Senator, we are lacking a mental

our constituents have access to

the residents.
Mr. President, Senator, no.
Mr. President, Senator, no
Senator Pinto.
Mr. President and Senator,
What about a crisis triage
center.
Evaluating
Because when we talk about our
children.
Having his access or even just
constituents have access to
where their children could get
intellectually evaluated or be
evaluated for severe chronic
disability.
um, up to between 66 months to a
year for their child to be
evaluated and of course, Mr.
President, Senator, it depends
what region you live in.
disciplinary action within the
school.
Um, what is the outcome?
For most of those students.
Senator Lopez, Mr. President
Placed within the youth services
center, they're expelled from
school.
So Mr. President and Senator, do
we know if there are programs
And Mr. President, I think there
are, there may be a few charter
schools that may be willing to
take these students in.
tackled some of the issues that
lead.
To
What our children are doing.
And I'm gonna elaborate a little
bit as a mid-school teacher.
We expect our students to
remember to take their

they see domestic violence in
their homes very nearby when
they are powerless.

And in some instances, maybe

education.
Have we really put those
programs in place.
students, those children that
were there during COVID during
those times of isolation where
we didn't address some of those
issues, they're out there now.
That's all I have, Mr.
President. Thank you very much,
Senator Pinto, members of the
Senate were, were on the debate
of Senate floor amendment number
one to House Judiciary Committee
Thank you, Mr. President, uh,
with the sponsor of the
amendment, please you Senator
Lopez, do you yield?
To a 14 year old.
Is there any type of
accountability or punishment for
actions. What is currently going
on in the law?
Senator Lopez.
Happens is that the uh.
The child, of course, um.
Will be brought in and uh.
It, it, uh.
bring in with me on the floor.
Uh, Senator, please, uh,
identify your expert and uh
we'll request unanimous consent.
Please proceed.
Thank you very much Senator
Lopez, uh, Senator Pope, do you
have other questions that you
wanna proceed with, Mr.
President, uh,
Senator out while you're holding
on, um.
there is a system in place for a
juvenile or a 14 year old.
When they commit a crime.
Mr. President, I know what will
And take in and uh processed
there.
There is a an an evaluation tool
that is used by the staff who
are present.
And of course based as to the
Then that will determine of
course if the if the child is um
left there at the facility in
other words, I call it being
booked or if the child's uh
parent's guardian is called.
Senator Pope, thank you, Mr.
President, and thank you,
Senator. And so I asked this
question and just make sure to
confirm because
went by the facility in
Albuquerque.
And met with some of our youth
that.
War incarcerated.
In that youth facility.
That were continuing their
education.
Um
I say that to say it's not a,
wasn't like a school or a camp.
Um
These were cells that they were
in. I saw we went and saw the
rooms and saw where they were
And so I asked that question
because this notion that.
There's a slap on the wrist and
there's no accountability.
Right now is just not true.
And why I'm going to support the
amendment.
Because
At the end of the day.
It's also our responsibility.
To prevent this from happening,
but more importantly,
We're talking about 1314, 15
year olds.
That are eventually.
Treating them as adults, putting
them in an adult jail or prison.
To where
It puts them at risk.
They actually learn more bad
understand.
There's the pressures.
There's the political pressures.
There's this push.
That we're just gonna lock
It's just not
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much, Senator
Pope, uh, just going back to
Lopez. We're still on
discussion, so I'm uh looking
for any other discussion
regarding the amendment. We're
going to Senator Charlie.
Senator Charlie, please, Mr.
For a question.
Mr. President, yes.
Mr. President, thank you, um,
The first paragraph.
Uh, Mr. President, Senator
Charlie, yes.
Yes, Mr. President, I am able to
read it.
and President, this bill would
increase sentences within the
section related to delinquent
offenders and youthful
offenders, which AOC reports
involve children who have been
rehabilitation. The AOC also
cites research published by the
NEA.
Cason Casey Foundation, which
suggests
Children with low risk profiles
Um, Mr. President, it goes on to
state that research indicating
the length of commitment and
supervised release of juveniles
does not address the root causes
President, I raised this point
to shed light on this will not
address the root causes of
children who find themselves in.
Involuntary manslaughter does
result in murder. It does result
in the death of someone, um, but
this problem, Mr. President,
thank you.
Thank you very much Senator
Charlie, and again we're on the
amendment, Senate floor
amendment number one to House
Judiciary Committee substitute
please. Thank you, Mr.
President. Unanimous consent to
excuse Senator Stewart until she
returns to the chamber except
for the purposes of a call.
It is so ordered. She's.
Thank you.
Mr. President.
She's excused as well.
Senator Padilla.
That's it. Thank you very much.
Any other discussion on the
amendment.
Going back to Senator Pope,
And honoring a lot of children
in this chamber.
Having him
On the rostrum.
Think about what we're doing
Pope. Any other discussion?
See, and then I'm going to
Senator Linda Lopez to close on
the amendment.
Senator Lopez, please.
Thank you very much, Mr.
President.
We'll make a decision.
To do something
Yes, Mr. President, it does go
back to brain development. It
goes back to many other.
But Mr. President, you know,
when I had an opportunity to
visit the youth services center
there in Bernalillo County last
summer.
Learned about some information
about strip searches being done
on children.
And Mr. President, there's a
whole other
Uh, world for our children that
That we'll be able to have many
more discussions and education
exactly what happens with our
young people, our children.
Lopez to your chair, senators,
we're gonna be voting on the

We need to have the same

And other offenses, uh,
That what he would increase.

We've long recognized the need
little while ago, we saw a video
of 3 kids just for fun.

And so that's what this
amendment does. It does still
retain judicial discretion.
So it's not like
They have to

stuff.
But when the cartels are

certainty of no punishment.
And so there's no deterrence.
And so that's what this does.
It, it just adds.

you. Thank you very much,
Senator Sher. We're going to
Senator Maestas for his
response, Senator Maestas,
please.
Thank you Mr. President. Senator
Scher, and appreciate your
crimes now on the list should be
taken out maybe a couple put on
the house had a compromise, Mr.
President, and that compromise
was to add one crime that
involved the death of a human

bill. This bill is about
services. This bill is about the
corrections fund and changing
the language in the statute to
it on this evening, uh, from the

unfriendly.
Thank you very much, Sider
Maestas. We're on debate of uh
Senate floor amendment number 2
please, on the amendment. Thank
you, Mr. President, and if the
sponsor would yield Senator to
share.
Excuse me, do you yield?
O Mister President.
sexual contact of a minor. Could
you elaborate on why you would
want to include that.
Because it's bad, Mr. President.
Raping a child is bad.
Thank you Senator Sheer, Senator
Pinto. Mr. President, in um
Senator Sheer, do we have any
data on how many cases there
are?
saves just one child. Isn't it
worth it?
So Mr. President and Senator, do
I'm pretty sure they happen
everywhere, even in the smallest
communities and even on the
Navajo Nation.
Senator Pinto.
So Mr. President and Senator, do
I don't have all of those stats.
I don't have any of those stats.
But we all know what happens.
We've seen it in the newspapers,

Uh
It, it happens.
Can I say it happens 138 times.
Or wherever they're finding this
information.
Senators here.
Mr. President,
Absolutely not.
been
Sexual contact.
With a minor?
Ever?
In the state of New Mexico or
even in the last month in the
So Mr. President, and Senator,
have we increased the penalties
for this particular, um,
2nd and 3rd degree criminal
criminals, uh, sexual contact
with a minor.
And of course aggravated
assault, robbery with a deadly
weapon.
Homicide vehicular homicide.
um, what are the sentences for
an adult?
Mr. President.
Maybe the sponsor Senator Sheer,
if you wish to go and call upon
one of your colleagues, uh, you
can ask for unanimous consent
the what the sentence is, is
irrelevant to this amendment.
This amendment is adding
definitions.
That's all.
doesn't change current law.
On, on the sentence.
you very much, Senator Pinto.
So, uh, Mr. President and uh
Senator.
So do we know, well, if you
couldn't answer the question,
In that sense, if we were trying
to deter
And model or trying to deter our

not.
Something that is supported by

likely maybe it's because the
adults.
They see are getting away with
it too.
Why do we want to add that into
this or amend this bill to add
that in.
Mr. President,
And
He may be shocked, but I've come
to believe that the chair of
Senate Finance Senate Judiciary.
Is correct.
So if we're not going to punish
anybody, which, which we have a
habit of not doing currently.
Uh, so if we're not going to
punish them for 2 years, not

make it longer. No.
I want the certainty of
punishment.
It's pretty certain they're not
going to be punished.
Because it's not part of the
youthful offender.
Definition. So now we're putting
I'm not trying to make it
longer, just trying to make it
certain that it'll happen.
Pinto.
So Mr. President and senator,
could you describe what
I am amazed that we're gonna
have a law school class here
because neither one of us are
attorneys, but I'm pretty sure
that if I go over there and
smack you in the head.
If I shoot at you and hit you
and don't kill you, that's
aggravated assault.
The official legal definition? I
don't have law professor
it's not. Oh, that's pretty much
up to the court.
But yes, hitting somebody or
shooting at somebody is
aggravated assault.
Thank you, Senator Scherer,
Senator Pinto.
is.
But not under the youthful
offender definitions.
That's the difference.
We're simply saying, if you're a
12 year old and you shoot a
a 12 year old buy a firearm.
Oh, Mr. President, of course
not.
Legally
But do you think there's no
And it, it's interesting. Yes,
our cops are outgunned
dramatically, suing Remington is
not going to change that. But do
you know, Mr. President, that
They buy any weapon they want,
give it to whoever they want.
$10 billion a month is a lot of
money.
And so if you're gonna give a 12
year old a gun and tell him to
So, Mr. President and Senator,
or the cartels the only ones
that have guns or firearms.
Of course not, Mr. President.
There's a little over 2 million
firearms in New Mexico, um.
And
Every once in a while.
One of them's used
Concealed carry.
Uh, people.
Uh, stop.
About 5 times more mass
it's like a hammer.
OK, I can use a hammer to build
a house. I can also use a
hammer.
Uh, as aggravated assault.
Most of the time they're not
used for crimes.
But sometimes they are just like
when you're driving your car
down the street and you decide,
let's run over the, the, the
Should we sue the manufacturer
of that car because somebody
wanted to have fun?
A gun is a tool.
Mr. President, I don't think so,
no, but again, other, you know,
Other people but the 12 year old
can't buy beer either.
Serra Pinto.
Mr. President, and Senator
Sheer.
Because robbery with a deadly
weapons bad, Mr. President.
Mr. President
But robbery with a deadly
weapon.
Means that you the the robber at
that point certainly has the
cup.
depending on how you want to use
it.
And robbing somebody with a
deadly weapon is bad.
Senator Pinto
of their economic status or why
they were attempting to um.
rob somebody.
And if you stick a gun in my
face, I will react to it,
probably poorly.
In fact,
I know
I don't care if you're poor or
green or from Mars or anything
else.
I don't care.
If you're trying to rob me with
I might lose that fight.
But I want it before and I was
not armed.
And I don't care.
Nothing about that carrots
except that you have now
threatened my life by sticking a
gun in my face.
And I will deal with that, and
if I lose that fight today.
So Mr. President and Senator
share.
What grade is a 12 year old in?
Well, I wouldn't need to sponsor
to yield.
That, uh, 6th grade student.
Unless they're above average, I
assume.
But
Keep thinking, it's like, why
would they be doing such.
Do we have all these things
accessible in which
Maybe they don't need to rob
anybody.
That may be just a basic needs
And if we're not collecting the
data or really trying to see

Then we're

youthful offender is.
Three young men.
Two of them were aged 17 1/2.
The other one was.

They kidnapped.
A 114 year old girl.
They raped her.

You name it, everything that was
going through her brain.
Knocked on the door, the people
came to the door.
And immediately.
They call law enforcement, law
enforcement came out. They took
her in, they did the rape kit on

Everything else, lots of.
They caught the offenders.

We do have.
Mr. President
Senator Sheriff, there's
anything that we could do.
To stop this madness, I would be
on board in a heartbeat.
For a crime like I just
described.
These children are going to
continue to go down that road
Send to share, I need to sit
down now. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Senator I,
again, we're on the, on this
particular amendment. Any other
discussion?
Substitute for House Bill 255 as
once amended. Senator Sheer,
please.
Thank you, Mr. President.
I do know that there are people
whose basic needs are not met.
In fact, Mr. President, we now
have free meals for every kid.
He's gonna show up at school and
you get fed.
And I know that there's a lot of
people in that situation.
But that situation doesn't cause

everything that I read?
No?
Mr. President.

But now what we have is we have
an epidemic of what I call

every man's a good dad? Oh, no,
no, no, it doesn't.
But Mr. President, when you and
I went to high school.
Almost everybody graduated from

real problem.
Mr. President,
Mr. President, I, I, I think
you've been a great dad, and I
don't really know you that well,
but what I do know, I think
you've been a great dad, but
have you made mistakes? I
certainly have, and I suspect
and you know why those kids go
to the cartels because there's
not a male role model.
Of any kind.
Not the math teacher, not the
coach, not the neighbor.

and they're attracted to that
because that's what they seek
boys particularly.
And now there's a male role

officially endorsed the bill

It just has a different

somebody into the adult system,
you have to have what's called
an amenability hearing.
the state has to prove that that
juvenile is unamenable to
treatment and therefore he needs
punishment in the adult system
as as opposed to rehabilitation

and so I don't believe that
person would be unamidable the
treatment, but um but to answer
your question, Mr. uh Mr.

you know, the FR made it seem
like they'd be sentenced for an
