That's loud. Sorry about this,
Um
Raul at this point, um, we're
gonna do Madam Protein would you
like to
to call this meeting of
Legislative Council?
Make sure you mind That's weird,
Very weird myself down, Um,
members, So we've had some
challenges over the last, um,
interim.
In some committees regarding
quorum. We've got members that
are missing sometimes or are
unable to attend meetings. Um
and so with that in mind, um, I
will be proposing that we
The in conversation with several
of the members on the House
side. One of them has requested
in particular to be removed from
one of those committees.
So at this point, I'd like to
announce that represented in the
Serato wall. Uh, stay on as a
member of revenue stabilization
and tax policy but will be
removed from the economic and
Rural Development Interim
Committee.
Madam Protein.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
So we have We have some interim
committees. They're very large
2221 voting members.
We have received letters from
the chairs asking us to help
because we cannot make worm at
many of these meetings.
So I looked at the attendance
study.
That the Legislative Council
does at the end of interim
committees.
And in an effort to try to get a
Corum at least very large
meetings. I am removing some
senators as voting members and
putting them as advisory and I'm
only adjusting based on their
ability to so no one is being
removed from a committee.
But we're trying to shrink the
number of voting core mission.
In addition that Senate has two
great news senators, Senator
Steve McCutcheon Senator Gregg
Nibert, and so we're adjusting
the committee's a little bit to
accommodate, um, the majority of
their wishes. So I am just going
to mention the committees that
will have changes.
The other commitment.
So for courts, corrections and
justice, we are adding Senator
Nyberg as a voting member.
And changing.
And Economic Rural Development
Committee. We are moving three
members from voting and moving
them to advisory
That's Senator my assist US
Senator Munoz and Senator
Pirtle.
And Indian affairs. We are
changing Senators O'Neill
McKenna and share to advisory
members.
And we're adding Senator Lopez
as a voting member.
This is a situation where you
have an advisory member that
comes to every meeting, and then
the chair has to call me and
say, man, protein. We don't have
a quorum. Can you make this
person just doing this ahead of
time so we don't have for
investment pensions? Oversight
We're adding Senator Nyberg to
replay for New Mexico Finance
Authority.
We are changing, Senator
Cervantes Caicos and create him
pill.
From voting to advisory and
we're adding voting members.
For water and natural resources.
We are adding Senator McCutcheon
as a voting member.
And we're changing senators,
Purtell and Stein, born from
voting to advisory
So, uh, that those are the
changes. I have talked this
morning with Senator Brandt. Uh,
And Senator Bacchus absence and
so if there are no questions, Mr
Speaker, I will move a motion
for both of them. Are there
questions from the committee?
Uh, representative Armstrong.
Um, thank you, Mr Speaker. One
of my questions is if you're
removing three from being a
voting member and adding one as
a voting member is and are, they
are the senators aware of
That and are are they okay with
that? Um, Mr Chair. Most of them
are some of them are not
Okay. Thank you. Emotional,
good. And second, the motion. Is
there further debate or
questions on the motion. See?
None has been adopted.
That gavel is really loud with
my left hand.
Sorry, Mol.
Yeah, Free sugar free. That's
right.
Um, members. I failed to
recognize our newest member of
incentive. Candy is l, Who is
the acting interim leader of the
Minority House caucus. Welcome
along those lines. Um I will be
appointing representative Jim
Townsend, House Minority Whip as
a voting member to the
Legislative Council.
He is not here today, but I
would remainder of of the
interim as a member of this
committee.
Um
Any questions on this point.
Madam Madam Program. Mr.
Speaker. I failed to mention one
of my changes.
I didn't write it down. That's
why
So every year there are two
members from the house that are
appointed to the uniform and for
the last several years, our
member for the on the Republican
side and Senator Nibert will be
appointed instead of Senator
Park at both of their request,
you
Very well.
Um
Mr Speaker. I moved second. The
motion.
Second ever was over. But
Caballero, their opposition to
the motion. Thank you.
Alright. Um, let's move on, Um
Let's go to rule next for the
next
Item and each other.
Thank you.
I just want to announce for the
record because there was some.
There were some changes last
year on interim committees that
some had co chairs, and it
didn't always work out very
well.
And so I do want to go over.
There's fairly quickly so there
are only two committees that
have co chairs at the moment,
that would be the Legislative
Council and that's by statute.
And the interim Legislative
Ethics Committee. And that's
because that's represented by
the equal number of majority
minority members.
So those two committees, council
and ethics will still have co
chairs. Some committees are not
biennial chair rotation.
So there's and that's usually
the
ID number and even numbered
years. So for 2324
The house is chairing L. E S. C
Indian affairs, military and
veterans.
And radioactive and hazardous
materials committees.
And the Senate is chairing LFC
investments and pensions, which
they've Health and human
services. Public School Capital
Outlay, Oversight, Task force
and transportation
infrastructure.
Those that are on the annual
rotation, so it changes from
year to year. Um, the house will
have four.
Courts and corrections.
Economic rural development
policy. Ready, Um, Revenue
stabilization tax policy.
Water Natural resources
committees, the Senate will be
chairing.
Land grants.
Mortgage Finance Authority, New
Mexico Finance Authority and
science, technology and
communications Committee.
I just wanted to make that, um
for the record so we can include
that in the minutes.
With that if I may move to the
next, um
Item. Um
So the
The statute.
The statutes indicate that the
If a member is not returning for
the 2025
Ah!
Legislature. Uh then this
council has to receive has to be
approved by a three quarters
majority for any members who are
not returning to be able to
travel out of state during the
Centrum and that has generally
been approved on a three
quarters vote. Usually it's been
unanimous.
The reason for that is that
there are a number of members
who happened to be officers, Um
and other organizations, whether
it's NCSL csg, and there's two
or three others that that are
there as well. So with that, Mr
Chairman, we would just need
emotion and approval of the
council.
To allow, um non returning
members to continue traveling
out of state to those, um
organizations.
Cool.
Um, I know we have some
questions here. I
Out of curiosity role.
Um
I've already approved a handful
of members attending and see
yourself, for example, which is
What if those folks or any of
those folks lose their primary?
Would we then have to come back?
And, um
And do it this way.
Mr Chairman and members of the
council note. If you approve it
now it's good for the rest of
the interim, whether they lose
the primary or even the general
You as the council have approved
them to travel. This is for
request that come in.
Once it's clear that somebody is
not coming back, correct. Got
it. Center breath.
Mr German. I was actually just
gonna move that we allow members
not returning to be able to
travel and that the
Okay, so the motion is to allow
members not returning to us, not
the request you're making.
Got it, okay.
Ah! Is there a debate on
The motion.
Romero.
Um, So just a question of
clarification are if we are
doing here.
Mr Chairman and represent,
remember, that's correct. It
would be a blanket approval, and
it's what the council has done
every year.
I should say every other year.
Thank you, Maria. Thank you, Mr
Chairman, but there would still
be additional layers. So there's
oversight madam Protein.
I'll just tell you the humorous
story years ago. We said no.
We said Okay, if you're not
travel, and so we we passed that
and we had to come back the next
month because there was
So much anger.
Among the membership that we're
still surfing. You know, we're
still doing our job. We're still
coming to committee. We had to
undo it. Uh, that's why I'm
going to vote yet. You had your
hand up earlier, uh, to get said
it was l like Mr Chair. Thank
you very much. And I'm assuming
that a lot of these members that
may not be retiring or also soil
is that correct?
Thank you very much.
Right, Senator Worth just a
quick so this is a statute that
exists.
So, Mr Chair. I just think we
need to take a look at the
statue every year again. It
seems if someone's elected to
serve
This is part of
Asked that we make a note of
this and maybe in the 60 days,
all right?
The motion has been seconded. Is
there further debate
Their opposition to the motion.
We shouldn't carries
Barely tapped.
Raul Space and Furniture Update.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
The
Um
Let's say the council service
hired the architectural research
consultants
At the direction of leadership
as a facility View subcommittee
that approved this
Um
Alright Architectural research
consultants was hired to conduct
a space and furniture
assessment study in the capital
and capital North.
Arc is reviewing existing
conditions.
Number of staff inventory of
furniture, inventory of space
floor plans of the capital and
potential furniture suppliers.
They did a good part of their
review during the session so
they could have a better idea.
And understanding of session
conditions when the capital is
fully occupied, and in some
places staff is sitting on top
of one another.
Um, there. Next steps are to
fill in some gaps that they
didn't get to because some areas
were difficult to get through or
tied up with meetings and the
like.
Ah, so you want to fill in those
gaps. They also want to
interview key users, namely the
chief clerks.
The agency directors and the
leadership chiefs of staff. Now
they did talk to a number of
these individuals during the
session, but probably didn't
spend as much time as they would
have liked.
Um, I will tell you that, among
their initial findings, I talked
to them a couple of weeks ago.
Is the age and condition of the
file drawers on the chamber
floors.
Ah, the metal on those work
service. And if the you have a
Metal.
Thing on top of the
The diocese. You will on the
chamber floors. Um, that is the
laminating. It's coming off.
There's some sharp edges. The
file drawers underneath are very
dated. And, uh,
Um not only that they're kind of
a hazard. It's easy to get
Some of that get cut on some of
that metal.
The age and condition of a
number of desks and finishes is
showing the size of the
workstations in open areas. Um,
and there's inconsistency in the
workspace workstation types.
There's a lack of sufficient
workstations and workspaces in
open office areas. There's
inconsistencies and the
condition of task and guest side
chairs, including
Um, chairs in committee rooms,
inconsistencies of many fat
furniture manufacturers cable
management, specifically the
electrical and electronic
chords. They can create quite a
hazard. Uh, there is in some
places. Um, a lack of sufficient
private office furniture,
especially where staff shared
spaces.
And there's a lack of sufficient
storage, especially for building
services.
Um, there is, um
Lack of coffee break area type
furniture, lots of small
appliances, microwaves, coffee
makers, toaster ovens,
refrigerators, some of which
could pose a fire hazard.
Outdated showing where damage
and or bulky furniture and just
insufficient space generally
Um, so there's a lot that they
will come back with in terms of
a final report. I'm hoping that
that will be ready for the June
24th meeting of the Legislative
Council.
Um, to make some recommendations
on
Possibly some space
reconfigurations.
Or and or purchasing, Uh,
furniture that is perhaps a
little less bulky, easier to
move around somewhat more
portable and allows spaces to be
accommodated for
Shared office space, but we will
have a final report on that.
Hopefully at the June 24th
meeting of the Legislative
Council, and with that, Mr
Chairman, I stand for questions.
Mr Chairman and represent no
during the session. They did
not. They spoke mostly with the
Chiefs of Staff, The chief
clerks and
The staff that's here.
Make that.
I'll make that recommendation to
work.
Leader is L
Mr Chairman. Thank you very
much.
Roll. I like her. I've I have
plenty of space right now.
But whenever you're talking
about 10 Sha Lei making more
space, what does that include?
Does that mean knocking down
some walls or reconfiguring
grooms? Or can you go more into
What you're
What is being thought here.
Mr Chairman, and, uh,
representative
Um
There's no concrete
recommendations at this point
about knocking down any walls or
reconfiguring any space that may
come about that. Maybe some of
the recommendations if you move
this wall over here, you might
make more space for the other,
but they're nothing has been put
to paper. There's no
architectural drawings, even
even draft drawings.
Of what it could be. It's mostly
how much space do you have? How
many staff do you have? What
kind of furniture do you have?
Where might you gain some, uh
more space with different
More portable appropriate
furniture, credenza and file
cabinets is a big deal, for
example.
A lot of stuff is just now
stored on computers. And yet we
have a lot of furniture that's
built to have
Drawers.
Uh huh.
With with those desks, so things
like that.
And Mr Chairman Royal. Thank you
very much for that information.
Yes, I do understand that.
And whenever we're talking about
some of the old desks that are
out there, they're like, I don't
know if 16 ft by 24 wide and, uh
That is very cumbersome, and
some of these rooms that are no
bigger than most bathrooms. So
thank you very much. Thank you,
Mr Speaker. Thank you,
Pettigrew.
Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you role for the
Update
It seems like since I've been
here.
Um, we've been talking about
space and furniture and updates
and
We funded this a couple of times
when we were supposed to do work
over the summer each year, and
sometimes that work doesn't
Um
I'm confused at one point in
time after the 2022 session, Mr
Chairman, we were supposed to
change capital north changes
never happened.
And now, Mr Chair. Uh,
Director. I understand that we
don't even have drawings.
But the funding was put out. So
what's the holdup? With respect
to this?
And representative Ferreira's
comments.
Understand the different places
and people that you're talking
to, But at the end of the day,
the end users would be a good
group as well. So
I'm just looking at the funding.
I went back and checked on
funding that we've given
Uh, specifically 2022.
Um, forward. Where is that
funding going?
And
If we were gonna do upgrades
throughout the summer.
Mr Chair and director.
Where are the fruits of that
labor?
Thank you. Mr Chairman represent
Petty group. So let me start
with capital north. Yes, There
was a lot of work that was
supposed to be done.
Uh um, that started it in
capital north.
Um
First we moved AOC out of
capital North.
And we moved L E S C from the
second floor to the first floor
of capital north.
Um, at the same time we started,
um, reconfiguring the offices,
the leadership offices.
The four caucus offices. I
should say.
Uh, on the first floor in this
capital, those were completely
reconfigured. In fact.
Three parking spaces were taken.
To make each one of those bigger
and the fourth one. We actually
took some room out of the some
space out of the
Bill Room there on the first
floor.
Uh, we also added, uh in office
late last year to the House
Majority office.
Uh, we moved the not move. But
we're this where the L E. S. C
was on the second floor capital
north.
That was turned into, um
I can't remember what the term
is that some people use bullpen,
but it's for session analyst are
now on that second floor from
the Senate.
Ah, last year, we also made
changes to the speaker and the
pro Thames office to modernize
those offices. We re carpeted a
number of different areas.
Um we those are the major ones
that I can think of Some of the
other things that, um we get
funding for are not specific to
Reconfiguration, but there
Uh, upgrading things that we
have in the building already.
Like like this, like the
committee rooms that we've done
with audio and visual
technology.
Uh, we have also, um
I mentioned carpet already.
Uh, but we don't get to the
point of having architectural
drawings until
I, uh, make a recommendation to
the Facilities Review
subcommittee, which is the
speaker of the protest, and the
four leaders and see if they
agree with making changes in
The capital, Any kind of
reconfiguration and the like.
I can't do that on my own. I
need to get approval from them.
There's no set meeting for them.
It's whenever the need arises. I
hope to be having a meeting with
him at some point, because we do
have one small need in the
council service. We're not
expanding or getting more space.
We're just trying to reconfigure
it to fit more people.
Um
And
Oh, the H back, were trying to
upgrade the H back. We also got
a new generator.
Those are building systems that
just simply need to be replaced
or end of life. And I'm happy to
provide you with copies of any
of that that we've done in terms
of the cost and the like, But
that has always been something
that we
I have to take care of. We just
need to upgrade those those
things.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you,
Director. No, I don't need to
see a copy of that. I understand
that. I just left the 2022
session with an understanding
that we were going to make
significant changes in capital
north.
With respect to legislative
offices. There's those changes
were never made. So I was
curious kind of what took place
And what took precedence over
that. Your answer is super. I'm
good. And I will just mention
yes, there was a discussion
about the House of
Representatives offices in
capital North.
There are 2222 members to an
office. With the exception of
one officer, Um there was a
I think they were torn on
whether or not to because they
would have ended up being about
being really, really small.
And they think it was decided.
At that point there was just not
worth.
Doing that, because then it
would have would have made it
more difficult. Um, to have
people in there. It was just so
we're still looking for
additional space, though.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Speaker
Chair.
So, um, Raul.
I missed or maybe didn't hear
quite well.
Your introduction of
This assessment that was
basically an assessment of early
stages assessment.
Does the, um
Do you plan or do they plan to
assess for disability because
and
I've had, as you know, firsthand
experience in navigating through
with a wheelchair.
And the office spaces.
That we're in as well as other
types of, um ingress and egress
from rooms and
Other but mostly the office
spaces are very hard to navigate
in the small spaces that we have
Luckily
For small distance. I was able
to get out of the wheelchair and
walk in from the hallway to my
office.
But if I were to take my entire
will change now deceased
predecessors have not
predecessors, but office mates
had to do. They were solely
literally the staff and
ourselves.
Whoever was with us had to had
to move things.
Out into the hallway in order
for them to get there.
Motorized wheelchairs in
The space is so that's a real
concern that at some point
Soon than later. We need to have
a complete disability
assessment. I've seen
Just the general public. Mr
Chair also struggle with
Those types of navigating
through
Speech, small spaces, So we we
are long overdue in my opinion.
Was a complete disability.
And also a D a compliance. Um,
overview.
An assessment of
All spaces in the capital.
And all things that, um, we have
to use like in and out of doors.
I know that handicapped. Uh,
automatic door openers were
placed in many different that's
been part of what you've been
upgrading. Understand that
there's still some doors that
are, too um, that closed the
automatic door closes too, too
fast.
And I know that several people
coming in and out of the ladies'
room had to hold the the buttons
and get out of the wheelchair
and walk in and that happened to
other individuals. Also, so
there's a lot of observations
and I think we have a really
strong healthy, um, Disability
coalition of groups that could
assist in that making that
Assessment, not always our
architectural firms or even
construction firms or others
equipped with the knowledge.
Um and and the laws.
That are associated with excess
excess. So that's what I would
request. Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Thank you Any other? Mr Chairman
Mac comment on that. Just
briefly. Go ahead. Thank you.
represented by Caballero for
bringing that up, because I
failed to mention that
Um, we do have in the budget
money for an 88 coordinator.
We're gonna hire somebody that's
specific to
Look at not just what we have to
do.
Physically in the building to
ensure we have accommodations,
more automatic door but also
electronically there's a that
are still, um, handwritten or
not OCR.
We have made some improvements
on the website. Um that on
there, but that is part of our
plan. We do have money starting
July 1st four can hire and will
help us do the assessment that's
needed in conjunction with all
of the other upgrades that we
need. Thank you, Mr Speaker
role. I was just wondering if
did you say that you met with
the Chiefs of Staff, with all of
them in a meeting or how did you
do that? On the study? Yes, Mr
Chairman, Representative, Um, my
apologies.
Um, no, I didn't meet with him
personally.
The when the Ark people who were
here
During the session. If they got
a chance to meet with somebody
they did, however, everybody was
so busy during session. They
knew they wouldn't catch
everyone. So when I met with him
when I they talked to me about
where they were, they wanted to
run through a couple of more
areas that they hadn't looked
at, and then they want to talk
to key individuals. I mentioned
the chief clerks, the Chiefs of
Staff.
Uh, the directors obviously
building services, but I will
include going to suggest that Mr
Speaker and role in addition to
question to get alright.
Um, let's move on to the next
part of the agenda. Conference
staff compensation and
classification plan.
Up. Thank you, Mr Speaker. So I
advised
Speaker Martinez and Madam
President Stewart sometime ago
that the classification and
compensation plan
Had not stayed consistent
because of some changes that
have been made.
Um, and it had not also kept up
with inflation. So let me give
you an example when this was
first established when when we
had, um, salary ranges set up
around 2000, give or take a
year.
Um, they would be increased only
when there was, um and across
the board raise given to all
state employees, So if it was a
1% or 2%, or 3% raise given to
everybody, then the Rangers
would go up by that amount.
Uh, that everyone received.
However, there were a number of
years, especially between
roughly 2008 and 2017. When
No state employee received a
raise because of the downturn
because of the recession.
And so that compensation plan
was losing out to inflation.
On top of that there was a
change made to the top category.
I think in one year and I can't
remember, I think was a
consolidation of a couple that
just expanded it.
At the same time, there was a
requirement in house built to a
few years ago that required that
nobody be paid less than $15 an
hour.
If they were state employed, so
we had to make adjustments to
accommodate that lower end and
kind of bump it up a little bit.
But it was not
Down the best way possible. It
was it had. It was kind of done,
Um
Based on our best guess, without
including any
Um
Well.
It was based on making sure that
we got everybody above $15 an
adjusted upward beyond that and
try to keep the difference
between all the range is fairly
consistent.
Um, so the pro TEM and the
speaker asked me to have staff
update the ranges. And this time
we asked Clinton Turner, who's
our
Um
Fiscal and research policy
analyst to adjust the salary
range.
Four.
Uh, inflation based on 2007.
What was it like in 2007 when it
was still keeping up with
inflation for the most part, or
was it in 2023?
Um
So I had staff work on that,
too, as I mentioned to adjust
for inflation.
Um and
The the researcher. Clinton also
talked to, um I believe some of
the leadership staff about it.
And he presented options to
staff staff being the chief
clerks, two directors
Um, the six Chiefs of staff
about some possibilities to
adjust those to make sure that
we accommodated for inflation.
But also so that
That they were that there was
some periods not just not only
adjusting for inflation, but
there'd be there'd be some
parody to state executive
levels.
Um, looking at everything from
the top Cabinet secretaries,
Deputy Cabinet secretaries down
to the bottom of the
classification ranges.
Um after consideration and
discussion.
The staff and again it was 11 to
chief clerks, three directors
and six chiefs of staff.
Um
We looked at the option that is
in front of you.
And adopted that one. And so you
should have to, uh,
classification and compensation
ranges.
One indicates what it is right
now. Oh,
It was effective July 8th 2023.
And that's in effect. Now, The
one that we're recommending is
the one that just says staff
recommended plan. We looked at
two others which were less than
this one.
But in looking at this, uh,
staff a majority of stuff I
won't say everyone majority
staff felt like the higher one
should be the one to adopt
because that provides more
opportunity for hiring
supervisors and managers as well
as leadership staff to hire
staff or not, just simply to
hire step before recruitment and
for retention.
And so the staff recommended
plan is the one you have in
front of you that we're
requesting that you adopt.
I will again mentioned that
there was there was some
hesitancy to go with the highest
one.
Um, and there's no specific
percentage that he's each one
has because they had to be
adjusted.
Individually while keeping a
correct amount between each
range and making it as
appropriate as possible.
Um, I
There was also a recommendation
that there be a cap at which new
staff can be hired. Um
For example, uh, that perhaps
somebody being hired isn't hired
at more than 7075, or 80% of the
max that would allow room for
growth.
At the same time, it would allow
staff that has longer tenure
with an institutional knowledge
of the New Mexico Legislature to
receive increases above that
7075 or 80% cap.
Um, that tenure could begin in
some percentage increments,
saying you're five or later
policies and procedures for this
classification compensation
plan, like the one I just
mentioned, if adopted, would be
based on recommendations might
by that same staff working group
And with that, Mr Chairman
members, I will questions from
the committee.
Okay. We have a motion to adopt.
Recommended plan in front of, um
Madam Protein.
Thank you. Mr Speaker. I just
wanna started with Clinton
Anderson doing the deep dive
down. Well, it started with roll
Clinton Turner. Okay. Anderson
was a former Senator Clinton?
Yes, Sorry.
Clinton Turner.
Another complicated name. Um,
because when, when he showed us
the problems that we've created
ourselves by not doing this, um,
regularly and thoroughly
So that's what we've got. We've
got a plan that and that, then
we don't follow.
Um, I want us to follow this
plant. I like being generous.
Uh, we have great staff. They're
not great.
They don't stay with us that
long.
Uh, set the salaries like this,
but but I want people to
understand.
That, um
That this has taken over a year
for us to come to our staff
working on it at our behest and
with us meeting and saying, Yes.
Do this do that process So I
just didn't want the night so
roll. You're anxious to say
something.
Thank you, madam. Madam, Um,
President and Mr Chairman and
members. I just want to mention
something because you brought it
up about how this just kind of
happened over time.
One of the recommendations that
that the work group came up with
was that
Perhaps on a biennial basis,
maybe not necessarily an annual
basis.
That Clinton as our fiscal
policy research analysts and
together
Every two years to take four
things into consideration on how
this should be adjusted so that
we don't lose out to inflation
again, so not just inflation,
but cost of labor costs of
living, and the across the board
raises that the legend that
would help form what
Would be brought back to this
council at least every two years
for
A compensation. We are also
because we're in trouble with
those paid bands, too, because
they're not following them.
So, um
I mean, this is something rat in
every aspect.
I just want to thank you. Thank
you, Madam Pro temp
Representative Armstrong. Thank
you, Mr Speaker. Thank you all
for this. So what was the
percentage another was certain
percentage average that you were
going up. Do you know what
percentage you chose?
Mr Chairman and representative.
there was no specific percentage
because they were so out of
whack. We couldn't take 1% and
do it across the board for all
of the categories.
If I had to.
Look at a
And Clinton's gonna hurt me if
he's watching this if I had to
guess that something would be in
the neighborhood of about 16%,
but that's just kind of looking
at the percentages and seeing
what so this represents, roughly
again. I hesitate to use the
word 16%, but it's not exactly
16 from high to low and how off.
Some of those were in the
middle.
Okay. Thank you, Mr Speaker. So
that explains it a little
better. So it wasn't across the
board. You looked at each one
individually and so my next
question, Mr Speaker and roll
this. When does this become
effective? July? 8th 2024.
Um
Mr Chairman and represent that
would become effective
immediately. So every, uh,
director Chief Clerk Leadership
Staff office would be able to
make accommodations as
As they can based on their their
given budget and house bill. One
did include increases because we
knew
They're the compensation ranges.
We're going to go up, so will be
up to each, um, supervisor
manager.
Leader to determine what um
their staff should be getting.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. And thank
you all. So, um my my ultimate
question is, Did we have any
that were on the below the
bottom end?
And what is that?
Going? I mean, I know the others
are are
Predicted by this, the people
who are in charge, but the ones
that were at the bottom. It has
to be an automatic.
And so who makes that decision
And what is that price tag and
is it in the budget?
Mr Chairman, representative that
has been taken care of. It was
taken care of. When House Bill
two included that nothing. No
one shall be paid less than $15
an hour. That's when we went in
and adjusted the pay ranges then
for that bottom
Step. If we have anybody who's
below that, and I doubt we will,
um
That would be adjusted
accordingly, based on on
That would be the first priority
because that's state requirement
that nobody be paid. Thank you,
Um
Mr Speaker and and rule the you
know, and some of them I see.
You know it was a the bottom was
70. Now the bottom is 90.
And so I just want to make sure
that
We have that money in the budget
and, um
That's really all I'm concerned
about is the new pay bands.
Hmm. Which I appreciate the
staff so much and so happy that
this is being done because
You're right. It was very off
kilter, but I just want to make
sure I mean that's not $15 an
hour.
Um
Yes, those at the bottom have
been or would be adjusted, But I
would also note that rarely do
we have somebody at the very
bottom of those, even the new
ranges. But if we have that will
accommodate. Well, um,
accordingly raised those
Based on this new
Thank you, Mr Speaker, and we
have the money in house built to
to do that. Okay. Thank you, Mr
Speaker.
Thank you represented for the
middle Live here in Santa Fe can
afford to live here. I'm just
curious. If, um um with the
minimum salaries, you know,
vanity or having to commute
designated Ms Mr Chairman and
represent Romero. We haven't
done analysis on on who's living
where and how that that is
affected.
I do know that on a large number
of state employees.
Including legislative staff do
live outside of Santa Fe,
anywhere from Espanola to Real
Ranch. Albuquerque, Las Vegas.
So we haven't studied that
specifically humble opinion. I
would hope that this body sort
of create over stretch their
budget to work here, Um
And I don't know if there's a
way you know it's a huge concern
here.
Thank you. Mr Chairman and
representative also want to
mention that, um the
Hmm. I believe in the House
appropriations.
The legislative building
Services budget, which is where
most of the lower
Paid staff is
House appropriations did provide
a greater number than what we
had requested, which was an
increase anyway, but we got a
higher number there as well. So
I'll make sure that
Uh, and essays, our chief
financial officer and are
building Superintendent.
Take a look at that and make
sure that
To the world of AI and
everything else available to us.
Can you just jump this about?
Mr Chairman. Represent, um
So yes, for, um, I think since
the beginning of the council
service we've had word
processors, Um, typists who
became word processors, because
that's what the software was The
new system that we're looking at
process and rich.
Roundhouse legislative and
publication system.
It will be state of the art. It
will depend far less on manual
changes.
And manual intervention. We
expect that to go live for the
2026.
Legislative session. We've been
working on that since the end of
2022.
And, um, we're still working on
that now.
Um and
That particular position of word
processors will probably go away
To some degree. There's still be
something that we don't
That will need them for but it
will be upgraded accordingly,
too.
Mostly a process between the
drafter and the proof reader or
editor of that, and the word
processor will be working on
other things, so that
To bring more equity poverty
wages in Santa Fe.
Mr Chair, Representative. Next
on my list, representative Rebel
Caballero.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Chair. Um
and thank you. Travel for
Getting us
Moving in this direction is I
think I've been
We've heard conversations in the
past about getting theirs into
Romero was referring
And making sure that our
salaries reflect
The position titles.
But my question is also, um
Did.
I believe you said Clinton. Did
he did you say Clinton did did
he
Look at or do any type of
Position titles and, um
comparables meaning did he look
at what we do compared to other
positions and salaries?
In general in the professions.
Did he look at that at all?
Mr Chairman and representative.
Would Clinton did look at where
the executive salaries and in
some cases, we were below that,
and that's where we looked at
making some adjustments.
Um, we have also over the years
and NCSL has helped with that
They've looked at what other
states do and comparable,
whether it's flannel or Sandia.
Or city county governments and
the like, So we have looked at
that over the years.
Thank you, Um Mr Chair and
enroll.
So I I know that, um
That it's been raised already.
The concerns about cost of
living and
Living wages.
Yes, I think we need to
Get away in my in my opinion.
From using minimum wage because
when you use language, it kind
of has a psychological effect,
and we want to do things
minimally. Rather than shoot for
Um
A greater standard.
And and in valuing
The backbone over
Of our legislative work and
valuing the backbone includes
everyone listed here, and that's
really important. So, um, is
there a plan?
Two.
Ensure
That
The salaries that will prove
Will
Continue to be
Um included
Annually.
In the budget.
And also whether we will be
factoring in
Cost of living raise.
Mr Chairman and representative.
Um, we will always take into
account staff need staff
requirements, Uh, leadership
requirements for for staff
legislative requirements like
To put in the House Bill two.
What is provided? Excuse me.
What is put into the feed Bill
House Bill one year round.
However, it is up to house
appropriations and Senate
finance to decide what is given
across the board.
All state employees, whether
it's a 123 5% increase that's
decided by the Finance
Committee's not necessarily by
leadership as part of House Bill
one.
That that is above and beyond
That's funded separately. So we
put in additional money.
All of the year round
legislative staff budgets, but
on top of that,
The finance communities included
a 3% across the board for all
states.
Thank you, Mr Chair, and, um,
role, I think
I think the message for us given
the line of questions and
concerns articulated
Is that we have to become
The advocates and proponents for
our staff.
And for, um
Ensuring that
What we're paying.
Will continue to
Address all of those issues so
as much as we can.
Be proponents of that.
It would be really important
because I know that there were
periods of years when I first
came in as a legislator that
Staff went years and years
without any type of, um,
increase in compensation, so
we've had to make up
For years of disparity to begin
with, and then years of of lack
of attention, so I would suspect
And I would guess suggest that
when we continue to do these
kinds of, um analysis into our
wage and salary compensations
that we confer with the experts
in the field, which others in
the human Services area I mean
human resources area to try to
make sure that we don't ever
fall back. Well, we legally we
can't ever fall back in
salaries, but
That we always stay ahead of the
game to compensate our values.
Leader worth
I think. Thank you, Mr Speaker.
So question about that 70%.
Within the pay ranges trying to
set longevity.
Ah, is that that's gonna happen
by rule that I understand that
because that's not we're not
voting moment of, uh, Mr
Chairman and Senator, um
Certainly if if, if the council
wishes to make that part of the
adoption of this to say that
nobody could be hired at more
than some of that.
I was thinking, though, that
that group of 11
Senior legislative leadership
staff would go back and put
together some recommendations
like some of the things that
have been dust. The next meeting
no later than either the one in
May or Mr I think that makes
sense to have the staff who
helped build this come up with
that, but I just want to make
sure if we pass this today,
today, there's go into effect
immediately.
It would could. Yes, Mr Chair. I
just think it's important those
of us who are in positions to
hire
You know during this window
before the staff sets the
The percentage for the longevity
peace.
Don't go higher at the top end
of these brackets because that's
really quite frankly, What got
us into a lot of challenge
again. I just want to flag that
I do think it's I think it would
not be appropriate for us to try
and do it today, because again I
don't know what the correct
percentages
And I do with the staff.
Figuring that out is important.
but I just want to flag
You know?
That if we're gonna adopt this
effective today, without that
provision in there, let's make
sure we don't
Immediately start hiring the top
end in effect.
You know, create a real problem
before we get started.
That's all I have. Mr. Chair.
Thank you.
All right.
Um, we have emotion, and it's
been seconded before a before
reward on that motion. I do want
to thank you. Raul and Clinton
and the entire staff and the pro
TEM as well, because you put
this on my radar a little while
back. Um, and it is very
important stated
Um
From our custodians all the way
up to our director. So thank you
all for all the hard work. We
have a motion a second. Is there
any opposition to the okay? See
none.
Okay, Go ahead, So just well,
we're considering we still
haven't Is there an Mr Chairman
represent? Which analysis are
you talking about? On just the
hiring the 7075. Mr. Chairman,
Representative. I think we can
bring that back. Hopefully.
In May.
That particular one.
Um, one of things I was going to
mention was that
We haven't got a district
offices. Yeah, we were thinking
of. I believe the speaker of the
poor time We're going to
indicate who was going to work.
On the district office Working
group from staff can take the
time with the other staff 11 to
look at that particular
recommendation. Bring it back.
Roughly and June 24th would give
you would be on board with that
as to whether or not we will
approve it. Um, but I think we
should the more information
actually where it's people's
livelihoods. I'm all on board
and give us a with and
And just to be clear you all
have your respond role, but we
are
We will get to district offices
and staffing specifically a
little later on the agenda, but
I do want role to to respond. Mr
Chairman and representative, um
Let me differentiate between
what
Um
You brought up right now and
what resent Romero was
requesting.
With Senator Worth brought up.
I believe that no later than May
we can bring back recommendation
to you.
On where that number is at 70 75
80. Maybe a little higher. Maybe
a little lower. I don't know,
but that would be specific only
to the compensation
classification plan in terms of
The rate at which you
And
What you can do for somebody
who's been there.
Here.
New Mexico legislative staff.
For five years or more 710
years, etcetera.
That
That one recommendation. I think
we can bring back to you.
If you adopt this now we can
bring that back to you in in May
for approval, adoption of that
particular piece.
Now, with respect to the
district offices. Uh, mostly,
I've been speaking with the
speaker Pro TEM about this about
how they want to approach it.
It is. It would defer back to
the co chairs on that and how
they want to look at that.
Partly what we were looking at
is
Not so much the location or the
area of the size, etcetera, but
more about
What does staff need in terms of
training?
Equipment, furniture, I t
equipment, those kinds of
things the policies that have to
be in place the training that
has to be provided.
Those are the kinds of things
that we were going to be looking
at. We would take more direction
from the council.
On that issue, but I would say
That would be the next
Leader is ill.
Mr Chairman. Thank you very
much. I guess that kind of threw
me.
Um So in reading the minutes
whatever I came upon in response
to a question on Page three of
an under classification
compensation plan, third
paragraph down from that, it
says in response to a question,
Senator Stewart and tersely
Director Legislative Finance
Committee explained that pay
bins discussed by Legislative
Finance Committee are not
specific to legislative
employees.
So I was
Kind of getting confused.
Whenever the other conversation
came up.
But
I
I'm kind of
I do want to everybody to get a
good race. I really do. These
people up here work hard for us
all the time.
But I would also like to see
before I voted on this.
What the suggestions would be.
what the recommendations would
be coming from Legislative
Council.
Over what you would be able to
hire personnel come and get it.
60% or 70%. I mean, because our
budget is
As you all are. Well, no, it's
uh
It can be up and down. We've
seen that happen before, so I
would like to kind of have
something in place just myself.
Know what
A new hire would be paid.
In regard to what the our
staffers right now are being
paid. If we give him this race
right now, does that make sense?
I'm kind of concerned about
that. Because Mr Speaker, Mr
Chairman.
Members. We know how volatile or
budget can be.
And I want to make sure that
we're not promising somebody
something and then all of a
sudden, said Wait. Time out.
We've got to redo this.
So if
In my mind, it would be easier
for me to make this
Vote if I know what a new hire
would be brought in that, Mr Mr
Chairman, Thank you very much.
Alright, we are on emotion.
To adopt.
The
Classification and compensation
plan that is in our folder as
recommended by staff.
Is your opposition to the
motion? Okay, So let's call the
roll, please. Whoever will be
calling the roll.
Representative Armstrong.
Senator Baca is not here.
Uh, Senator Brandt.
Represented Casey Senator Do
Hig.
Senator Neville.
Center by the
Represent Romero.
I wish I could make a
representative All Caballero?
Yes.
Terms of Shindo. It's not here.
Japan's key is not here. Senator
Sanders, not here represents a
passkey is not here.
Uh, Senator Worth? Yes, Rooms,
MSL.
Townsend is not here.
Uh,
Speaker Martinez.
Yes.
Madam President Stewart.
Mr Chairman, members of the
council. The, um
Measure passes.
Um
But 10 in favor.
Two opposed and for absent
Motion carries.
Alright? Remembers next up.
District of, um members. As you
know, House Bill two included an
appropriation for for district
office and legislative staffing
equipment. Furniture supplies
contingent on this committee.
Adopting staffing patterns,
policies, procedures and then
the other guidelines that we so
choose to
Um
The pro TEM and I have been in
discussions about this the last
couple of weeks and we will be
recommending to you all
That the respective chief clerks
Chiefs of staff.
And the director of Legislative
Council.
Comprises staff working group.
To develop.
Those required staffing
patterns, policies, procedures
and guidelines.
Including for the council.
Service as the administrator for
these districts items since
items for the staff working
group to consider will include,
but not limited, not limited to
District office locations at
minimal or no cost based on
available cities, counties,
universities or college
locations.
Standard Office supplies
furniture standard I T equipment
and software, including Internet
access.
Telephone actions. We a voice or
via voice over Internet
protocol.
Which can be used on council
issued equipment.
Um, And as we've talked in this
council before, there is a zoom
option that council services
Um travel guidelines for
district staff coordination with
GSD liability workers. Um,
there's a whole host as you know
of rules, policies and
procedures that we would have to
adopt.
Um
But the recommendation from the
pro terminate to you all at this
point.
Is that that working group began
to work immediately over the
next six or so weeks and present
a plan to this council.
At the next meeting at which we
will provide
Um, feedback.
Request changes. Um, you know,
whatever the case might be, Ah,
creating this staffing staff led
working group will not preclude,
uh legislators, particularly
those who have been working on
this for quite some time to be
able to support and participate.
That effort as well. Um
I would suspect that the, uh,
staff that we
Would consider appointing to
this working group would
probably
Um, check in with you all and
get feedback as that process
goes along.
Um, so that is the
recommendation of the protest,
and I
Um And obviously we want to hear
from you all before we take a
vote. But we would, um
Uh, we would we would request
Um, that we have that set up and
that structure over the next few
weeks to come up with the plan
that we would have then bought
on and approve as a council.
Let's go to, uh Senator Padilla.
Recommendation. So there was
obviously a lot of work done
last year. That is correct, sir.
Ton of great information There
is. Thank you. There is an and
thank you for that
clarification, so there are the
there's the surveys that were
conducted by pulling in research
over last interim. There's the
recommendation that came out of
the
Ah, the third party contractor
that we hired that this council
hired to come up with different
concepts. All of that data. All
that information will be
available to this staff working
sedative, Armstrong.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Um so can
you repeat who would be on that?
Uh,
In that group again, please.
Yes, Absolutely. So the
respective chief clerks, House
and Senate
As well as the respective Chiefs
of Staff for my office and the
leadership offices and the
protests speak chief of staff in
the two leadership offices.
Okay. Thank you. Mr Speaker. I
just wanted to make sure I had
that down. And then what is the
timeline that you're projecting
on this? Um what this possibly
be voted on.
Um
Before we go back into session
or during session or what?
What's the timeline that
Um, would are you thinking on
this Good question? Uh,
representative And before I
answer that, I failed to mention
also, the director of Council
service will be a part of the
working group.
Uh, the plan is for this working
group to present recommendations
to us at the next meeting, which
will either be May 6th or may
13th that will be our
opportunity to review as a
council to comment on the
proposals. And then for that
same group to come back with
their final recommendations that
the June 24th
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Um, I
just want to bring to and so
would they also be deciding if
it's going to be district or
individual? Or has that already
been decided that has not been
decided yet? Um, I think it
would be part of their purview
as well.
Okay. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Um
There's a like Senator Padilla
said. There's a lot of moving
parts to this. I mean, I
personally Mr Speaker, I have
eight.
Different.
House members house that touch
mine.
And so that means nine people,
and then it just spiderwebs out
from there, So I have a big
concern coming from the largest
house district in the state.
Um about it, how it's going to
be implemented. It sounds like
it's going to be implemented,
whether we like it or not. So I
do have concerns about that. So
I just wanted to air. Those
concerns. Also, um
Uh, you know, is it going to be
shared district offices between
Democrats and Republicans? My
problem that I'm seeing Mr
Speaker in advance is that this
is going to be implemented,
possibly before
The election, and some different
people may be coming back after
we hire people for those
positions there.
And so I I see an issue with
that, and I really wish that we
would put it on a two year
You know, get this done within
the next two years. Not before
the next wanted to voice that.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Thank
you. Next representative of all,
Caballero.
Your chair. I was I was for the
sale. For the sake of
discussion. I was going to move
a motion but discussions already
undergoing. So when you're
Appropriate.
Thank you.
Okay. Thank you, representative
said Pettigrew.
Thank you, Mr Speaker. Um
I think I have three points that
I would like to bring up.
The first point being.
During Legislative Council last
year and also
One discussion during
legislative finance.
We've we've brought up
Several issues with Mr Sander
Hoff's report.
They showed some
inconsistencies.
And asked, I specifically asked,
And I think, um
Now, Senator, neighbor, Uh then
representative neighbor.
Brought to question
Several of the splits and the
districts and where the district
offices would be.
And
Pretty confident.
That
The game plan was for respect to
it. District offices were
How do you say based off of the
old demographics and based off
of the old maps?
And specifically, I'll give you
one example when we have two
representatives in Roswell.
One's gonna get sent to
Alamogordo. One's gonna get sent
to Clovis.
So
I asked specifically for that
information and proof that that
we were working off of the
current
District maps.
Regional maps, and to this day,
I still have not seen that.
On top of that.
I am concerned with the 6
million that was put aside with
this. I do not believe
statutorily.
We still have the ability to do
this.
We have the flexibility.
With respect to staff here in
Santa Fe,
We do not have something in the
statutes that I can find and
Attorneys that I've talked to
confined.
Let's say we have the ability to
do this outside.
There was no
Legislation brought forth this
last session.
That codified this
Third point, Mr Speaker and
chairman, um
We went through three options.
And I don't believe we ever got
to a point where there was any
level of agreement.
A legislative council on what
three options we're going to be
looking at.
And to be honest, where the $6
million came from.
Other than just reaching in the
sky and grabbing the number.
Thank you, representative
channeler.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I too am
trying to get some clarification
and how we got there. So, um
First of all, we all are in
district, so I'm a little
concerned. We referring to these
things as district offices, when
in fact confusing because I
immediately thought, Oh, great.
I'm getting staff but I I hear
is there's yet another structure
Where someone elling us that
those individuals where there
will be some kind of bullpen,
or, um, you know, people
assigned and yet again, That's
the case. I would oppose a
program where we're just adding
yet more staff reporting to
Legislative Council
And not individual legislators
who actually
Um, performance will be, you
know.
Deemed appropriate. And so I
chair about how this might be
all put together, but
Uh, staff to me means someone
who reports to me as a
legislator. And if that is not
thank you, Simon just to
clarify. I don't I don't. We're
certainly not dictating a model
And I think that, um your
concerns are also all of our
concerns.
Um And I would not. Um, I also
would not support that. But
what? What? What comes up? Um,
we are not making any decisions
we are doing is appointing
There's working group.
Made up of our
Leadership staff.
Um, the respect of clerks and
the director of counsel to come
up with the concept, not
starting from scratch. I mean,
they're taking everything that
we've heard over the last two
years. There have been working
groups that some of you have
been involved in already.
There's plenty of research.
There's data that they'll rely
on to come up with.
A number of proposals that we
then ultimately into account.
Even what is being just
Because legislators know the
kind of work that they do in
their districts, and this is not
being intended to be
disrespectful to the staff
because I know many of them know
a lot of what we do, but I think
they don't know all of what we
do. And I think, well, the
problem with that is I We're
gonna end up with 112
legislators on this working
group because I'm sure
everybody's going to want to be
a part of it. So
That is a recommendation that
we're making on staffing and
we'll take that fails. And I
guess we can consider another
another path forward.
Next on the list, representative
Garrett
Thank you, Mr Speaker Chair.
First of all, I'm glad to see
this is moving forward. We've
had the Bieber. We've had the L.
C s. We have a lot of stuff.
Um
I just I do agree some
legislators should be on it. I
know our respective chiefs.
Well, consult us.
But I think having like two
Republicans, two Democrats who
want to do it, who have the time
to do it.
Um, someone from the Senate.
And I just want to. Besides,
there has to be some real
flexibility.
Um, you know, I spent 15 hours,
setting up nonpartisan town
halls in January and March.
And all of us and we'll we'll
continue to have
Nonpartisan things with City
Councilors, County commissioner
State legislators and even state
officials already, I think
everybody's been getting these
emails about the massive amount
of money is coming in from our
federal delegation, and, um
what's your name? Miss Scott?
Bezos.
She just gave 20 million.
Mackensie Scott. Um
You know, and I'm sitting there.
I start tracking it like okay. I
gave 20,000 to quit Dondo, Los
Ninos. And then you know
Mackenzie comes in. And you
know, I don't know how much she
gave a million. Okay. Yeah, So
So my point is, this is stuff
that the staff could work on. L.
C s
There's just tremendous amounts
of stuff that has nothing to do
with. You know whether a
Democrat independent or whatever
we are, so I'm just concerned,
though.
About setting up some model like
I feel like legislators in a
given district need to have a
voice. Susan always talked about
giving the money to each
legislator and then having them
work out the location and
staffing.
Um, you know, Representative
Armstrong might be able to work
out something with this person
or that person. Um I'm in
Bernalillo County, where I touch
three representatives, and I now
touch three senators, So I'm
just, um, I just think we need
the legislative voices. I know
the various chiefs of staffs are
going to be involved.
But I think having legislators
who feel called to work on this
is an important element of the
committee. Thank you.
Thank you, representative next
on the list.
Leader is L
Mr Chairman. Thank you very
much. Whenever I first ran for
this office.
Wherever I went. I gave people
my phone and I told them if you
have a problem you call me.
Mr Mr Chairman members.
I took that to heart.
We do have good people working
for us up here in Santa Fe, and
I do appreciate there for safe
made to help my constituents
out.
I didn't sign on to this job to
have a full time staff. I don't
even have a dedicated office at
the ranch. My dedicated office
at the ranch or even
At the farm where I live. Now,
um
I've got a bar top that I work
on. Okay, the kitchen bar top.
That's my office right there.
If I'm not able to help them
out, I'm able to pick up the
phone and call
Either the minority stuff that
we have for the House chief
clerk's office and like I said,
they do a wonderful job. But
whenever I go home, and I'm
having to tell my constituents
Hey, we're gonna spend $6
million of your money.
And we're gonna have offices and
especially if we enable this
before the elections. That
office may not be there because
it might be some place else
because somebody else might have
got it. Gotten elected to that
seat.
Mr Chairman.
I look at it this way. I took
this job Bond, and I love it.
Because I enjoy being able to
help people and to do what's
right for all of the mix, but I
didn't take this job on to keep
dinging the taxpayers of the
state of New Mexico and to me,
that's what we're doing right
here. $6 million so we can have
help.
And that's not taken into
account.
Finding an office finding
somebody
That is capable of staffing it
buying all the furniture, buying
all the equipment getting all
that stuff done phone lines that
are going to be going in. We're
going to have to pay insurance
on that.
They will have travel expenses
as well. And the list goes on
and on and on.
And then if we have to share
Staff.
That could turn into a big mess,
in my opinion, but I cannot
support this going home and
telling my constituents or
anybody else in the state in the
Mexico
We're gonna send $6 million
spent $6 million of yours.
Because we weren't capable of
being able to handle the
concerns you've got. I want to
hear from my constituents. Mr
Chairman.
That's all down the list leader
chasing Thank you very much, Mr
Chairman.
Um
I just want to say I'm gonna
maybe suggest a couple of things
that might help us all get
Ah prepared in advance of the
next meeting. First, I want to
say that
Arguably and I made this
argument when I, um
Read this study. The first time
is we have constitutional
authority now to hire our staff.
We didn't need a bill.
We didn't need the governor
design anything. We actually
have that authority in our
Mexico Constitution. I'm
concerned that the office
location shouldn't dictate
staffing. I mean, I worry with
with
Representative. I don't know if
it was representative Cameron,
which one of you said this about
22 in Roswell, and one is going
to have to go to another county.
You've got your senator there,
you know? So you
There's a chance these things
have to be worked out,
obviously, and we've got
The fifth largest state
geographically, and we're very
sparsely populated, so it is
going to be a challenge to
figure all that out. But what
I'm wondering
Is if
In advance of this If the
Council service could
Post whatever feedback they
received on the original study
because some of us spent a lot
of time providing feedback. I
don't know if everybody did, or
if everybody just looks complex,
but it might help if you read
what some of the other
People wrote because, um, there
were some good models suggested
for us.
But every single one of those
states that was recommended as a
bottle.
Didn't go and pass a bill saying
that this is what they were
gonna do. They figured it out as
they as they went along, but
that might be really helpful if
we could look at, um
Feedback.
On that study, and, um
Finally, I just want to say I
can't imagine.
That any legislator would be
happy with someone else hiring
his or her stout.
And but I'm I'm anxious to, um,
get this going, even though I'm
not gonna benefit from it. I've
always thought
Everybody really needs this and
I want the best fruit.
For you. And for this steak,
Thank you, Mr Speaker and Mr
Chairman.
Thank you, Leader JC Next on the
list, representing
Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you.
Everybody. I to just want to add
that I
The rocket science? No.
I am.
I I have served another rules
regarding campaign staff and
and, uh, if you serve in a
district staff, that's very
clear to any staff that's ever
done. Those that's very clear to
legislators. It's very clear to
the staff.
Ah, so I agree that that each
legislator should hire and fire
their own staff, I think having
done that
The Legislative Council can
serve the backroom off your
operations where you do the
benefit package the You know the
salaries, etcetera, etcetera.
All the stuff that goes into
making, uh, making the staff
benefit package work. Uh, you
know,
Uh, payroll. All of that stuff
can be backroom stuff that can
be done by Legislative Council.
But but chiefly.
The legislator has he has to
have the high ability to hire
and fire their own staff.
Um
District offices. I think they
need to state where that should
be. I think that needs to be a
priority.
And, um and we have to have a
lot of training that goes along
with that. We get that It's a
new system. You're going well,
some people
Abuse this take it to the bank.
Somebody's gonna abuse it, but
you have to have methods in
place that prevent that.
So that's all Thank you.
Representative represented.
Thank you. Mr Speaker. I'd like
to know at this time, um, moved
to adopt the speaker and the pro
Thames recommendation to
establish the working group as
they stated
Um, thank you. That's my motion.
Okay. We have a motion on the
table to adopt the protests in
my recommendation on legislative
staff being slash district
offices. There's a second from
senator by the
Yes.
Yes.
Alright by a vote of 93. The
motion carries and, um
And members. Um, also, just for
those of you that are interested
who have been working on this.
Please know that you can work
with this group of
Staffers that we've appointed to
this. These are not going to be,
uh, you know, closed off to you
these meetings. These
conversations? Certainly There's
a lot of good feedback from all
of you that I think will
Inform, um this group of people
so, uh, fear, not rinsing your
suggestions are still part of
this. We just felt like we
needed a streamlined process and
we wanted to get this all the
reasons stated. So with that, um
we'll move on to the next part
of the agenda.
As you know, members.
There is a letter in your folder
from Mr Bush. Yaga, um,
announcing his retirement.
Effective August 30th 2024.
He spoke to me and the pro temp
a couple few weeks back
announcing that decision very
sad to hear the decision, but
also understanding of the fact
Mr Bush saga that you've given
so much of your professional
life and probably personal life
to to this Legislature, and, um
And and this body.
And it is, uh, it's been
commendable service and we
certainly appreciate all of the
work that you've done on behalf
of all of our constituents and
the people of New Mexico.
Um
I am going to ask the pro temp
two.
Move that we go into executive
session for purposes of
discussing
Um, the process through which we
will, uh
Search and higher, um
The new and next, Um Mr Speaker
movie goes, is talking about the
process by which we will try.
To replace the very big shoes of
rural Brazil.
I'll second that motion.
Is there opposition to the
motion?
Okay, so none we will go into
executive session. We will ask.
Everyone who is a non
legislator. War to please exit
the room.
