Good afternoon, everyone.
Welcome back.
We have a
legislature that joined us
during the noon hour. I'd
like to introduce
yourself.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. It's an
honor to be here with you.
I am representative Pamela
Herndon. I represent
house district 28 in
the Northeast Heights
where we are getting ready to
celebrate our second
annual Northeast
Heights Day
and it's gonna be on uh
Saturday, July
27th in Lynwood
Park. And please
come out and join us for the great
festivities. And thank you,
Mr
Chair.
>> Our first item on the
afternoon agenda is
entitled Transformation of the
Auto Industry
uh being presented by
Kurt Augustine
who is a senior Director
of State Affairs
for the Alliance for
Automotive
Innovation.
Welcome, Mr
Augustine.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and members.
Uh I really do appreciate
the opportunity
to make a presentation
to you. I was glad to be
back in New
Mexico. Uh
It's always a
pleasure and again, it's I'm
happy to so
uh I have a fairly lengthy
presentation and
that's what I would hope we would have it
if you choose to have a
dialogue uh
and interrupt me because nobody
really wants to hear me drone on
for a long time. So I'm happy to
entertain questions in the middle of
that. So, uh I
have several slides as well
and they're
somewhat uh
busy by
design because since this was a
leave behind with you a lot of
data, um
I thought it was important that
you, you know, have that and, and
be able to refer back to
it uh later
in uh whenever you would like to
do so, we'll go ahead
and proceed and
I said the title is the Transformation of
the auto industry. And we
really are on the
cusp of
the single greatest
transformation of the auto industry
since Henry Ford
made the conveyor belt. I
mean, we are the way
the cars are going to be made, what
those cars are going to be
is going to be quite dramatically
different in the
immediate future
than what we're presently doing.
And so uh I'll get
into that also. So we
have a, I have a slide
assistant. So I'll be, you'll
hear me saying uh to flip
the slides too. So she's going to help
out there. Uh So
if you go ahead and switch to the
next STL
please,
so the association
that I'm with is again the
alliance for automotive innovation.
We are a trade association
of all the automakers
who sell vehicles through
dealer networks uh throughout
the United States.
Uh As well as
many of the electric vehicle battery
manufacturers, traditional
auto part uh
companies as well as
autonomous vehicle technology.
People, in terms of the
automator, the only
automakers who are
selling vehicles in the United States who
aren't members of our association
are Tesla Rivian
and Lucid. Uh They
have chosen not to utilize
the dealer uh model.
And as a result of that
are not part of our
association.
So uh
if you can go ahead and next slide,
please,
as I said, we are on
the cusp of a
great transformation
and our companies
are committed to an electrified
future. In fact,
uh the president of our
association just a few
weeks ago, testified at a
congressional hearing
that essentially said the
future is electric
period. We move the
next slide. So
you can see this is a sample of
some of the vehicles that are available
for sale right now. And I
wanted to tell you there are three
types of electric
vehicles or zero emission
vehicles. The
first off are plug-in
electric
hybrid vehicles. So those are
cars that have both
uhle electric
motor as well as a small
gasoline engine
that will kick on
if you do run out of
batteries. Some of the
examples of those you
can see listed there. Probably
the most one that you're familiar
with is the Toyota
Prius Prime.
Uh that will gets
about uh 70
miles per charge.
Uh And then cade
it's an a vehicle. So then there are
the battery electric vehicles
or BEV uh
probably the ones, the bolt
and the leaf that you've heard
of most. And then
there are the vehicles
that are, are also called fuel
cell vehicles.
Right now, there are approximately
100 and 14
models of
uh, zero emission vehicles for
sale in the United States.
And so the customers
are seeing a lot more
selection.
So if you go to the next slide,
please,
so what I'd like to do today
is talk to you, just give you first
off a snapshot of,
of where we have
been and then we'll
talk about where we're, we're going.
So as I said,
the future is electric,
uh and we are
going to get
there uh in a very
short amount of time,
uh sales of
electric vehicles by 2030
are going to be somewhere between 40
50% of
total sales
and it's not been easy
and nor will it be easy
to get there? Uh So
far, uh
our companies have spent 100
and $25
billion just in the United
States alone on
auto and batteries
making them to be
electric.
That's on top
of the $1.2
trillion that are being
spent around the globe
uh to get to
that level of
investment by 2030.
And one thing that's very exciting
is the US battery
plant uh
manufacturing. We're
estimating it to grow
by
649%.
I mean, that's incredible.
Uh We're going from almost
nothing to a, a
huge amount in just in a couple of
years.
So the next slide,
please.
So where are we on
sales and what, what's happening?
So this
graph shows
you, uh ev
sales in the, across
the country since
2020
through the first
quarter of 2024.
And you can see the lines going
generally in the right direction
up. Uh, you can
from in 20
year, year,
2020
nationally. Uh there
were about 2% of all
vehicles sold were
electric vehicles
this past year.
Uh It was
9.3%.
So as a dramatic improvement,
there has been a dip
lately in flattening.
That's concerning
uh it's not a trend
yet. We nobody can make, you know,
makes no judgments on
just a quarter,
but sales are
beginning to uh flatten
out a little bit and we can
talk about that. But
the actual numbers
uh that
we saw so
far just in this past
quarter, so quarter, one,
there were
344,000
electric vehicles sold in the United
States. So that's
a, you know, a, a good
start
on the next slide, please.
One.
So where are these cars coming
from in terms of replacing
gasoline power? So
if I
intermittently use the term
gasoline or internal
combustion engine, they're the same
thing. So you can see
uh where the market
share is going. Yes,
gasoline powered
vehicles dropped uh
4.5%.
And that makeup was really
in two different places.
Uh plug-in hybrid
electrics, which is, remember I
told you has both a gasoline
and battery powered engine and then
the hybrid electric,
which is technically not
a zero emission vehicle. And
that's what that is a hybrid
electric vehicle is like the
original Prius
where it is powered by
gasoline but
runs off a battery
as it needs to do
that. But it, because its
primary source of electricity
generation is gasoline,
it is not a zero emission
vehicle. And that took
interestingly, those
vehicles took up the Lion's
share of the
changed market share
in this past
year.
So the next
slide, uh
it shows you uh
the 50 states
individually and obviously I'm not
going to walk through all
50 states, but you can
see that California
continues to lead
the state market
last year. It was
approximately 25%
of all cars sold in
California were electric
vehicles
and that it has
trended up.
New Mexico
is right in the
middle. Their, their
27th
market share
uh Last year
was about
5%. Uh
It did dip
uh in quarter one
down to uh uh
4.5%
again concerning
but, you know, no one's jumping
off of a building
over that now,
uh on the next
slide,
uh you know, we do have a lot of
challenges ahead of it because I
said our
industry is
headed to an electric future.
This is so when I make some
of these comments, these aren't
complaints, they're just
reality on helping
and hoping that we can get some help
to accomplish all of our collective
goals. We
see some challenges with
the infrastructure. And I mean,
and by that, I mean, the
charging infrastructure, not the
traditional uh road
infrastructure. It's
especially important that we
see that in residential
and workplace in a,
on residential.
It's critical in multifamily
dwellings. Uh,
I think the model
is well established for single
family homeowners. But if you live
in an apartment building
and your landlord does not
want to put a charger
in, you're kind of stuck. And
that's a significant portion
of the population in the country.
So we're very, you know, concerned about
that. Uh,
ev prices whil while
coming down are
still higher than
gasoline powered
engines. Uh
the California regulations
which we absolutely
adhere to and which new Mexico has
adopted uh has
a have a lot of issues
about battery requirements
and durability. Again, we
will meet those but they are
challenges and they will
help increase costs,
etcetera,
supply chain issues are
still going on that and this
is not a COVID related
issue. It, it is the
where, where they, those
minerals are coming from
and where they are
processed and
we have a lot of new factories to
meet all this
demand.
So if you go to the next slide,
please, uh I just wanted
to kind of let you
know what the
regulatory landscape
is for the United States,
but also more specifically
for you all here in New
Mexico.
Go to the next
slide
as we like to say it, there's one
tailpipe but there
are four agencies and
seven different sets of
regulations on,
on vehicle
emissions. And
if on the, the first column, uh
on the left
that is the, uh, California
standards and the section
177
that, and that's just the federal
code section that allows
California to set its own
standards. There
are currently 17 states
including California who have
adopted the California
standards.
It will be 12
in the near future and I will talk
about where that drop-off
uh is.
So California
regulates greenhouse gas
emissions and fuel
economy. Uh, they
have those regulations have been in
place for a number of years, but they
are actually in the process
of, of, of tweaking
those up right now.
And then most
importantly, uh they
have adopted the Advanced
Clean Car twos or AC
C two regulations
that talk about traditional
uh emissions from a tailpipe.
But specifically for
this discussion today
about electric vehicle
sales and in the
economy,
then the middle is
the United States EPA
regulates
all greenhouse gas,
fuel commissions and
emissions and those
sets of rules are different
than the California
ones. And
then on the federal
level, NHTSA, the National Highway
Transportation Safety
Administration regulates
vehicle mileage and
those two are merged
with EPA
S to have all
these different sets of,
of rules and regulations,
some of which are in conflict,
some which go hand in hand.
So it does provide a challenge
for our members
to meet all these
rules. And as an
aside I mentioned
on those 17 states
that have adopted the California
rules, that's approximately
35%
of vehicles that are
sold in the United States.
If we go to the next
slide,
I wanted to uh show you a
graphical uh
version
of the standards that
California and
New Mexico have
adopted. So
we're uh currently,
we're, we're under the AC C
one. and, but
that concludes
next year. So we're,
you know, less than six months away from
that, the AC C
two regulations start
next year and
that begins
with the
mandate that
vehicle offered
for sale, 35%
of those have to be a
Zev vehicle.
And then that sliding scale
goes all the way up to 20.
Let's for instance, in 2028
that would be 51%
continues on. And then
by 2035
100% of vehicles
offered for sale
in the AC C two
states have to be
zero mission vehicles.
If we go to the next
slide,
I mentioned there was the federal
standards
and on this
chart, the upper line
is the California standards.
And you can see the federal
standards
are
uh rigorous, not quite
as rigorous, but they
are essentially
lag about a year
behind where the
California standards are.
So whether you've adopted the
California standards
or you,
you haven't a
zero emission vehicle future is
coming to, to this
country and you
can see those dash vertical,
excuse me, horizontal lines
just to show you in perspective,
California is at
25%. So you see
how even they're going to have dramatic
growth and the other 49
count, uh, states
are at 8%.
So there's, again,
no matter if
you California standards, United
States standards, a dramatic
change is going to be happening in what
vehicles are offered for
sale. If we go to the
next slide,
this shows you the states
that have
adopted uh
the standards and
there's a, a little
different, they're on a different set of
scales. So see on
the, the bottom
left hand
corner, the
ones that are starting in 2026
those states
uh primarily,
pardon me are the
Pacific Coast states
and some New England
states, they will be
starting and we'll talk about this a
little bit later
about where New Mexico
is. And so if we go to the
next
slide,
this shows basic is
basically that, that chart
I just showed you. But
on this
graph and
I do want to stress that these
years, those are
model year years, not
calendar years. So for
instance, when this
is all starting in
uh 26
model year, 26
starts on January
2nd
2025
that's less than six
months from now.
So those states,
those six states,
there are
going to be on that standard
New Mexico through
its uh
deliberations has
decided to start on
year 27.
But under the federal
rules and the California
plan, there's no ramp up.
So your state
will start in 27
and it will go from whatever they've
been selling before
to
42%
in 2027. And
again, that really
starts on January
2nd 2026.
So there is a dramatic
change going to be,
you'll see on the, uh,
on the lots
and how, what is,
so what does that mean kind of
looking at numbers today?
And so then on the next slide,
please, this bar
chart represents
the states who have
signed on to the AC
C two.
As I mentioned, California
is at approximately
2025
25 or
26%.
They're at the
top.
Why? There are two columns
per each state. And this is where
it's dramatic
is that the blue
represents all electric
vehicle sales.
The gray represents
companies who
sell other cars
besides electric. So
the drop-off is fairly
significant if you, when you pull
out Tesla uh
numbers and I said
using California, it
went from 26 to
14%
in New Mexico.
Uh by
coincidence,
your, your 12th of
the 12 states in terms
of vehicle sales
as a percentage, uh
it was 5%
last year of that
5%. If when you take
out uh Tesla and
Rian, you're down
to 3%.
So if I go
to the next slide, please.
Uh So based
on that quick
little snapshot, where
does New Mexico stand?
And where, where is New Mexico
going? So if you go to the next slide,
please.
So this is an analysis
of, you know, graphically
of, of New Mexico
sales last year.
So first off just a
comparison to where you stack up in the
United States
uh in the
United States, 80%
of, of
vehicle sales were light
truck. Now that means pickup
trucks and
suvs
uh and 18%
of vehicle sales
were pickup trucks.
So here
in New Mexico, uh
you're pretty
much the same on light
trucks. 82%
compared to 80
but the not so surprising
difference is the much
larger percentage of,
of those vehicles that are pickup
trucks. Remember it's
18%
nationwide here
in New Mexico, it's 28%.
So that's not unsurprising
given, you know, the
state
on the next slide,
um, of those
vehicles that were sold
again, 85%
of them were traditional
gasoline powered
vehicles.
Almost 10% were
hybrid again, but not
the, not the uh
zero emission vehicle
hybrids, but the just traditional
gasoline powered hybrids
again were almost
10%.
A little more than 1% was the
plug-in hybrids
and battery electric
were almost
4%.
So that gives you a kind of a feel
for what was sold last year. This
uh if you go to the next
slide, please, uh
This shows
you over the
last uh
year since 2021
the trend in New Mexico
for Zev
sales. So
in uh in 21
it was, you know, about 2%
and as I mentioned, it
was uh 5%.
So the trend is
in the right direction.
Uh But
you know, there's a lot more to do if we go
to the next
slide,
just again,
do not want to belabor this but
just this last data,
we've seen a little bit in
a dip in
sales. Uh New
Mexico kind of right in
the middle again,
saw a 0.5
drop in in vehicles
uh that are of
sales that are
Zev.
So if you go to the next slide,
uh just show
you where electric
vehicles are here in the state.
So this is uh
unsurprisingly.
Uh I think that uh the
most of them are here
in Bernalillo County.
Uh You can see the breakdown
on it and there's uh every
county uh except
one has an electric
vehicle uh in the state.
So that's uh
uh so
there, there's some gettings to
be some statewide acceptance
all around.
Uh So just
to give you a feel, there
are approximately 2 million
registered vehicles in New
Mexico.
Not quite 15,000
of those are electric vehicles. So
that's less than 1%
of the vehicles that are
on the road here uh
are electric. Uh So
I said you're making
progress. Uh
But there's ways
to go and on the next
slide, uh
This just shows
where uh graphically
where the public
charging stations
are and the,
the, the redder the
dot And the bigger the
dot That means
more so, not
surprisingly, again, obviously
here in Albuquerque, there's quite
a few in Las Cruces
and then between here and Gallup,
there is a large facility
on the interstate uh
to help folks who are
traveling uh both
here and through the state to be
able to, to charge
up.
So,
uh I just to
recap, I, I want
to
make sure that you understand
what the the coming
scope of
car saless are going to be in the,
in, in this state and
what the state is going, the
challenges the state are going
to do. So
right now,
again, 5%
of vehicles are,
are electric sales
in 2027. That
will need to go to
43%
in 2028. That's going to
be 51%
in 1919
30 in, in
2030
that'll be 68%.
And then when you conclude
the program,
uh in 2032
it's 82%.
So again, 5%
to 43% in just
a couple of years is dramatic.
Now, one
thing the state has that, I,
sorry, I should have mentioned it earlier.
The state has not adopted
fully. The AC C
two, AC C two
goes all the way through
2035 and that's the
100% the state
has only adopted
through uh year
2032 and
will decide later on uh
what they're going to do. So
you, so the hun
currently the 100%
requirement is not going to
be in the state again,
it's 82% and
32.
So let's go on just
to the next slide, please.
So that's where we're
at. What's it going to
take for all of
us to succeed and get
there? And if you could go to the
next slide,
we really see that there are four
major components
to success there
is the
customers,
the charging infrastructure,
the cost and
the production and
I'll, I'll be talking about
so I won't belabor this
slide
much. But
those are the four critical
areas that we see
that all have to be
successful if we're going to
achieve the mandate
that the state has
put in place, if you go
to the next
questions
so we can
build the cars. There's
no doubt about that.
But how are we going to
get to reach our
goals? And
some of those questions that are out
there are, can people
afford them? Both the
vehicle and the vehicle
costs?
Can people fuel
them? Uh
As I mentioned earlier,
50% of Americans
do not
have
uh of off
street parking to be
able to charge their out. So that's
half the people in this country
can't charge at home.
Uh That's an issue.
Uh said another question. I
talk about the supply chain
issues have not gone away and I'll
expand on that a little bit
and then finally
will customers
buy them? We,
we just don't know yet. People
are starting to buy more. You saw the
trendlines, but there
are folks who still have questions
about range anxiety, the
cost and
it's, it has
unfortunately become a bit of a
political issue too. There
are surveys that
say depending on
uh what party you belong
to, uh is
you have quite strong
attitudes for, for
or against electric vehicles.
And so it's never really
good when your product has become
politicized. And we're
trying to uh to
get away from that. But it is,
we have to be realistic and that
has become part of the equation
in selling these
vehicles.
So let's go to the next
slide and,
and address question
one about
pricing.
This is a chart over the
last four
years of pricing.
The top line is the
price of electric vehicles.
Uh The middle
line is
the industry average
and that bottom line
is uh for
subcompact cars.
So you can see that the
see that the price of
electric vehicles is coming
down, but it is still more
than the average
price.
So that is a concern. So let's
move to the next
slide.
And this,
this data here is not
our data. This is something that I've included
uh from both JD
Power and S and P
Global.
So this just kind
of shows you the breakdown of where
the expense of the cars
are. So 60%
of gasoline
car powered cars who
are registered uh
in the last couple of
years, 60% of them
are, are under
40,000.
10% of vehicle
registrations are
electric that are
only under. So again,
60% of gasoline
cars are under 40
10% are
under 40,000. So that
is an issue
and, and people ask me, what is
the cost? Primarily?
It's the the battery
anywhere from a battery
costs 10 to $15,000
more than a
traditional gasoline powered
engine. And
if you could go to the next slide,
please,
uh this one just
kind of uh breaks
down about the
uh premium versus
mainstream type of
thing. Right
now,
79% of
electric vehicles are classified as
premium in their
sales uh
in the in the
other part of the auto world,
it's exactly the opposite.
81%
are are classified
as mainstream. So there is
still, you know, some
cost challenges that we're going to
have to, to deal
with
and then moving on to the next
slide and then and to the next
question number two about ev
charging
infrastructure.
Uh If you can go to the uh the next
slide about the
grid and the ev
charging in, I I'm not
going to be talking about
the energy grid and how
that all works. I put
this in here just really, it
is just to show you that it is
a highly complex
uh change that we're, we're
going to go from,
you know, the to the grid
to all the charging
infrastructure. Uh that
is important whether you're doing it
in a public or in your
home. If if you go
to the next slide
is a nice
representation of
what it takes for
public charging.
So you have the the power
coming in from the power plants
and there are several devices
that have to be on
site, whether
they're the
transformer
or and the
meter and those.
So to that point, the
rates are established, the
costs are established by
the electricity
provider.
And then you move to the
cost of the
actual charging that's
established by whoever
owns the public chargers
and all the
uh you know, wiring,
they've had to do that, they are
now being paid for. So
those are the two. So there
are two cost
factors. One, the actual cost
of buying the electricity
from the provider and
then the, the selling of
it if you
go to the next slide. Uh,
again, I I'm not
going to get
into those, but there are, when
we talk about charging
vehicles, there are three different levels
of, you've probably heard that there's
12 and
three
and you can see the various
ranges. Uh, the
one, the level one is just a, is
just a essentially plugging
it in that your, you know, from a
plug at your house
and it's very slow
3 to 6
MPH of charge. So even
overnight, I mean, you
might only be getting 40
miles and, and that's
that, that's fine. We're at
home. Level two
is faster and level
three. So if you
go to the next slide,
so when I'm speaking
about infrastructure and when our
industry is speaking
about infrastructure, did you
have a question,
Mr
Chair?
The Oh,
ok. So
if you go to the next
slide, yes. So when
I today, when I'm speaking about
infrastructure and when
we in the industry are talking about
instru, we're actually talking about
level two and level three
chargers.
Um because the, the
level one is just, again,
that's nice it at home. And
so level two
chargers, those
are the ones that
workplace,
residential and, and
public, they're the least
expensive. Uh And
again, they get you about 20 to 40
maybe 60
MPH. And then there's
the level three or you may have heard
them as DC fast
chargers. Uh, those
will get anywhere
from 250 to
several 100
MPH. And those, we really
see those, uh, out
on the highways where people
are, you know, driving long
distances and those
are, uh, an
important option. If you go to the
next
slide,
I, I put this slide in only
for information, but I'm not going to
talk about it. There are three, when
you, there are three types
of readiness, there's
capable, ready and
installed and there's just
different levels of what
capa capabilities have actually
been installed. Can I I
leave that in for your
reference? If we move to
the next slide
level two,
I'm uh we
this, this can't
be emphasized
enough
um that we
see this is really the
way that has to be
done in a public
way.
So we, we
are supporting
strongly through
different government
organizations and entities
changes that I'll elaborate on a
little bit but essentially
in, in government buildings, public
work sites, building codes
and things like this
is also and I
can't emphasize enough critically
important for multifamily
dwellings to have access
to a level two charger.
They just, it will
not work in any
other fashion.
And then at the next slide level
three charging,
uh again, those are
going to be at places where there's
high volume,
long distances are being
traveled.
Uh and it's,
but even then
one thing that's as an
education aspect,
uh even as fast as the level
threes are as,
you know, you go into a gas station
right now you're there for
five minutes, you're out.
And about this
is going to take 2030
minutes. It's going to take
people uh
change in
attitude to accept that there's going
to take longer to fill up their
car. And it also
that time frame
impacts where these
chargers need to be placed.
People have to be doing something.
People aren't going to be too happy just
sitting around 30 minutes in their car
in the middle of nowhere, they probably
want to be doing something. So a lot of
thought has to be
given to where these
are installed to make
it uh good.
Now, the good news is on the
next slide,
we're seeing more and more of these charges
around the country on that smaller
uh picture that was from the
snapshot in
uh July of
2015. There were
only 240
fa excuse me, 204
fast chargers in the
entire country.
That's just nine years ago.
Right now, there are
8000
chargers or
excuse me stations and
almost 34,000
chargers. That's
great. But
we still have a
long way to
go. Uh If
you look, go to the next
slide,
this is data that's been provided
to us by the National Renewable
Energy Lab.
And they
estimate
that to meet the
goals of
2030
those blue lines,
they're gonna need to be 100 and
82,000
fast chargers in this
country and over
a million of the level
two. Now
this state from 22.
So they showed
4000
DC chargers and
100,000. So looking at the
level two in
2022
they're saying we need to go over 100,000
to a million.
Now, on the next slide
again, a little bit of good
news you can from
2022
we've gone from
100,000
to 100 and 26,000
level twos
and uh up
upwards of almost
doubling. Uh in fact,
a little more than doubling of the DC
fast chargers.
Uh So that's
great. But
again, we still need a lot
if you can go to the next
slide,
again, entrail
estimates on the goals
and the mandates that are in
this country to
reach at 50% by
2030 we're
going to need 28
million chargers
in this country
and that's going to
require a
tremendous amount.
Uh They estimate that
right now we're at about 13%
of that.
So these additional chargers
is gonna be need to be a million of them.
And the, the last I
read, they estimate
between now
and the end of 20
3400
and 38 chargers
need to be installed
every
day or
that's three chargers every
10 minutes to be able
to meet the needs
of the regulatory
mandates. That's,
that's big. I mean, we that
is the scope of the challenge.
So, so what's the situation
here in New Mexico? Go to
the next slide,
please.
So these numbers
are based using the
California Energy
Commission's model
on the number of
vehicles uh
per chargers and
the number of people and
where they live. And so this is a
combination of their model
using New Mexico demographic
data.
So under that
model
by 2030 to meet
to meet your state law,
they estimate nearly
27,000
charging stations will have
to be in place
25,000 of those
will be the level two and about
1000 DC fast
chargers. Well,
where are we at today?
There are 441
level two chargers
and 307
fast chargers.
So again,
um that that's
a dramatic
change again from
400 >> and 40
>> one >> to 20
>> 7000 or,
or excuse me, sorry,
748 to
27,000
to meet the needs of
that.
So that's
the scope of the challenge. If you go to the next
slide,
what my association
and others in the auto
industry uh
recommend
on is there fast
charging needs to
happen on the
>> corridors? >> 24
7 access,
a lot of pricing
uh uptime requirements.
I'm gonna talk about uh
issue. So if you go to the next
slide
kind of summarize on
the infrastructure, the
lack of infrastructure is the
number one challenge
holding back our sales.
Uh So we, we
are desperately needing
support of policies
to get more chargers
and we believe that industry
and government have a role
uh together. So if you
go on to the next slide,
uh that's that
again, that's a quick or maybe
not so quick summary of
infrastructure >> charters. So on
additional >> challenges,
uh I mentioned I go to the
next STL about
uh the critical
minerals that go into the
batteries. Well,
it is a global competition
for these minerals, whether it's
lithium or
Cobalt and that
competition is from
where they are mined,
where are they processed and
who wants them? Our
cars want
them, cell phone
>> wants them >> uh
e bikes, >> heavy-duty
vehicles. We're all in
competition with very
limited uh
sources.
And so moving on to the
next slide, which is
way, way too busy for any
presentation.
Uh But it
summarizes
for you
to meet the
the demand in the
United States
>> that those >> numbers that
you're >> seeing. Uh
that is
the
percentage >> of what this
country currently can meet
those demands. So >> some of these
capabilities, we're down
to five percent
that are not, that are
only >> 5% of these
>> uh devices >> and
minerals are made are
made or mined here in the United
States >> and to meet
the goals and >> to have
us production up,
it is estimated by
this benchmark
uh company
>> that there are gonna have to be 300
new mines
developed in this country >> by
2035
>> to meet it.
So if you just >> again,
significant of the scope, moving on to
the next slide,
>> this is really kind of
the challenge of the
charging and the
price
in our data
as well as this data that's provided
by JD
Power.
Four out of the
five topre
four out of the top five reasons why
people are reluctant
to get an electric
vehicle is related
to charging issues,
whether they can't, they don't have
access to it. They think it's too
expensive, they don't
think their car is going to drive
far enough. That's
the type of uh I issue
that is done. And so this
and that other chart gives you the
list of many,
many reasons why
people are, are reluctant to it. And
that's the challenge that we're
meeting uh up
against.
So, moving on to that
next slide I had mentioned
about uptime
earlier, uh
we have a
problem in this country
with public charging
reliability.
The experience of EV
owners in this country is one
out of five have had
problems at a public
location having a
charger work for
them. Can you imagine
if one out of five gas
stations weren't up and
running at any one time? It's,
it's an unworkable
situation and
that's what we have right now. And
again, that's not our numbers. That,
that is uh survey
numbers from JD Power.
So going to the next slide,
we believe that a
combination of industry
and business are able to
do it. There are many things
that state policymakers
uh can do. I'm not going
to run through this entire list,
but I highlight
things that we think are
important,
charger incentives,
market economies, getting
building codes uh
available, those
type of things, the and,
and working with
utilities and public
utility commissions
for grid
issues.
Uh Moving on, you
can skip the uh
state policy
slide if you just go to the what strategies
have state leaders
enacted
uh where we've seen success in
other states. They,
they have prioritized
fleet sales
for both private and
public sales.
They have committed to building
infra ev charging
infrastructures, but with different
incentives,
updating building codes
and that, that and I want to talk
about that just for a moment. That sounds
kind of boring building
codes. But
when we are, especially >> with new
building >> codes, we are building
buildings that are going to hopefully
last 50 to 100
years. If houses
and apartment buildings are
not able to have
charging at their homes,
we are building homes
that aren't going to meet the future
and it's going to put a terrible
burden on
that.
Uh Other things you can do to
implement is a low carbon
fuel standard. Kudos to
New Mexico, you have already
done. So, uh and
that is hopefully going to help
implement some of these things we've been
uh talking about if you
move the next
slide.
Um You, I've talked
about that, I'm not going to get into
it, but uh
some of those strategies getting
the electric, getting the
fleets, it's especially
important for state
policymakers >> to
make sure that
if you're going to make your
constituents buy
these electric vehicles, well, maybe the state
itself should do so.
And you know,
that's a, a very
progressive approach
and, and things then show
people that these cars are out
there. Purchase
incentives can be a
controversial topic. You,
your folks are wrestling with
it uh with the low carbon fuel
standard. Um
We still firmly
believe because of those cost
numbers that purchase
incentives uh from
the government are necessary
to, to meet these type
of things.
Uh there are,
you know, yes, prices are coming
down. Uh, but there's
also some
misnomers about
the federal program that I want to
talk about. So
when we look at some of these
incentives, you know,
there, it doesn't mean that
everybody who's buying it, you
know, there should be means
testing. I mean, if you're making
$5 million a year, you
probably don't need $1000
incentive from the, from the
state. Uh They need
to look at what type of vehicles are
eligible and especially
concern needs to be given
to low and moderate income
purchasers. Now, I
mentioned the calif the
federal rebate
program and Kudos to
President Biden and
Congress for
establishing that and especially
their goals on trying to get
both vehicle and battery
production back
into the United States.
However,
that goal has
been very ambitious
and was almost
immediate and
it's been very
challenging uh to
meet. So, and what
does that mean? Primarily it's not
making the vehicles here in the
United States because
companies no matter what
your, if you've got
a Asian European
or American nameplate,
your cars are actually being made
here in the United States
mostly.
However,
with the batteries,
the requirement of the federal
rebate program
requires that
a very
high percentage of
minerals and where
those batteries are made must be
made here in the United States and
not from a country
of concern which are,
and there are some of them defined
by the
United States Department of
State. The
biggest problem is China
is on that list
as a country of concern.
Why is that a problem?
Because over 80%
of all the lithium
produced for batteries in the
world are
processed in China, they're not
mined there, but it's processed
there. So 80%
of all the lithium that goes into all
these car batteries
because it's made in China
rules it out
for a
rebate.
As I said earlier, there are 100
and 14
models available
for sale in the United
States. There are
only six
that are available for a
rebate under the federal
program. So there
really essentially is no federal
rebate program. Now, in the
years out when
more processing can happen
here, more battery production,
you know, I mentioned earlier how much
expansion of battery manufacturing
can happen. But until
that happens, unfortunately,
we don't really have a federal
rebate program and must
rely on states to
create those
incentives.
Go on to the next
one. I I won't belabor.
It's important though.
It's incredibly
important that
any policymakers make
sure that their regulators,
the Pu CS and
the utilities are
involved in this.
There.
Utilities across the country
are all over the map of
some are very
aggressive,
are, are our
partners in making
sure that there's more charging,
more availability, more
rebates, blah, blah, blah, and
there are others who could
care less. And
that, and we've gone
through those mandate numbers. You
see that people are
going to buy
electric vehicles, they need to
be engaged. We
go to the next
slide.
Uh Again, I
I mentioned that the building
codes incredibly
important. I think the one
thing on this slide that I want to jump,
I mentioned about
why new construction building
standards are particularly
important. It's much
cheaper to build a
house with electric
capability than to retrofit
it. California
has updated its
building code standards and they
estimate they're going over
the next few years. They're going
to save nearly
$1.5
billion in
retrofitting costs by
just updating their building
codes. That's pretty
significant.
So, if you move
on to the
next slide
and then you can skip to the, the
past the blue. There you
go.
Um,
transportation and
electric generation are
now partners
and they haven't been, I mean, these
industries have evolved
separately and now
they are together
and what that really
mean, you know, you've already
deduced, you know, from a lot of what
I've said, but what I haven't talked
about are some of the equity
issues that
this commingling
and collaboration is going to do if you go
to the next
slide.
So we already have
equity challenges in the
current mode of
transportation,
lower income people, it's, it's
expensive.
Uh There are pollution
issues, especially when
it comes to uh medium
and heavy duty, especially heavy-duty
vehicles on where these
operations are occurring and
where folks of more
modest means uh
live.
And so they're, they're already
having these burdens. So
now that we're moving to an electric
future, we're, we're going to be
adding some more burdens
uh to these folks
again, not to harp on again,
but affordability
charging access in their
homes or at
work uh
and where this is all
going to happen. And
also there's issues about
grid reliability
on whether people are going to be
able to, you know, make sure
that they're able to, to charge their
car.
So if you go to the next slide,
please, uh
This is a, I'm gonna show you
a couple charts based
on a, a study that
was performed in the Los Angeles
area about
uh transportation
network companies, Uber and
Lyft of the world
on where uh
how the electrification
of that is going. So if you,
so I will, I will show you
very quickly the, the
smaller slide on the
left, uh the red
dots show where
DC fast charges are.
And that gray shows where
there are low income
areas you flip
to the next and
I'll, I'll show that a little bit more. And then the
second one
with the green lines shows
where the electric vehicle
miles are being driven in
Los Angeles. And that blue
area is where low-income people
are and live.
You don't see mat's screen
in that blue. So
moving on to the next
slide,
this does show,
it shows that first uh
picture in
a much bigger view
for you is
those red dots are where DC
fast charges are. And that gray
area is areas
where people make an income
of less than $51,000.
And in Los Angeles, $51,000
does not go a long way.
You can see there's almost
no
charging uh in
that area and I think there might be
one and that's very close
to, uh, the Fabulous
Forum and the racetrack where
the Lakers used to play and that's
why they have a charger there.
So this is a huge
problem not only for the Uber
and Lyft of the world
because they are driving a
gasoline powered cars
in these low-income
areas. We
all know gasoline
powered cars create
emissions, that's not
going to be helping the health of
people in low-income areas.
And it's also a barrier
by not having these chargers.
When low-income people
are starting to buy used electric
vehicles and adopting that, where
are they going to to charge?
This really must be
considered
in any policy that
any state that's adopting
the Zev mandate must
adhere to
the next slide.
That was a good study about
loss Angeles. But let's not
forget rural
populations,
there is equity
issues there as
well. Um
I I this particular slide
just came up is it, is it
Ohio? Uh
you can see
with the red around Columbus
and Cesan, there are chargers,
but in the rest of the state,
there are almost no chargers
anywhere. So how are these
folks going to be able
to, to move into the
future? And
you can see on
uh in New Mexico, it's very
similar on slide 23.
When you go back, you can
look, uh
it's almost the same exact
picture as it is. And I
think the Ohio one is important
because every, you know, people
don't necessarily consider Ohio
necessarily a rural area
estate, but it obviously
is, but there they have
voids there And so, you know,
those problems are
in all states that have
large rural
areas,
uh moving on to the next
item is the tools
that exist.
Um I, I won't
go through this but it's,
you know, everything I've just talked about
affordability,
incentives, uh
charging and things
like that. And people again must
be cognizant of medium
and heavy duty. I my
association only represent
light duty of
vehicle manufacturers.
Um
but until
the electrification of heavy-duty
vehicles occurs
in areas that are
very industrialized,
there is going to be an impact
on people who live around there because the
emission levels are, are
huge.
So moving on to the next slide,
we've, when people talk about
electricity, I just want to remind, right.
Don't forget about hydrogen.
That's an electric vehicle. It's
actually makes its own
electricity on the
vehicle using
hydrogen. And
if you go to the next slide,
um hydrogen's
obviously there's the
car, there's
the, the station and,
and the fuel
and those are the three important
things that is. So we're making the
cars, there's not a lot of them,
you know, there are uh the
companies that are spec
really in, heavily
invested in Toyota
Hyundai, Honda
General Motors and
BMW are very
invested
in hydrogen
gas station owners
like
hydrogen fuel
because it fits their business
model. You can refill
a hydrogen fuel car in 3
to 5 minutes, just like a gasoline
power car. And so that
throughput model that
gasoline station owners
rely on is
mimicked. They're not going to make a
lot of money if they're
having a GA you know, an
electric vehicle charger there
for 20 to 30 minutes.
They're, they're not getting the throughput
that, that they need
and it is a
clean fuel.
It, you know, again, the hydrogen
is loaded onto the vehicles pumped
in just like, you know, similar to
gasoline and
the fuel cell on board
makes the electricity
and hydrogen is beca there are
concerns in the
environmental world that hydrogen.
There are
massive developments
in the, in the creation
of what is called green hydrogen
and that is the wave of the
future there
too.
Very quickly. On the next slide,
fuel cells just aren't
for cars
and it's important for pos it's
heavy duty trucks,
buses, trains
all can use that. So it's, it
is a broad-based
uh solution.
And moving on to the next
slide,
it's again, pretty
simple.
We need
a plan. Some funding
vehicles and infrastructure
have to be there.
So moving on to the next
slide uh again,
summary just don't forget about
fuel cells when you're thinking about
electric. Uh and it's
also an option
in an oil state because
that f hydrogen often
comes from oil companies
and that might, I've
been told that might be of interest
to, to folks in the state.
Uh So
that, so at this point, I, I'm
going to actually change
subjects a little bit
uh at the chair's
request. So I thought maybe I would
at this point, maybe open a back
up to the committee with your permission,
open a back up to the committee if they
had any questions about
kind of the vehicles and
then I'll kind of move on to a
different topic if that,
if that's with your permission,
sir.
Ok. All right.
So then moving on,
uh about
ev battery safety
and move to the second
slide. Uh
You have probably heard a lot
in the media about
fires and if you notice
that vehicle it's on fire
there, it's a Tesla,
they're not a member. So that's why I
picked that picture.
Um
But the coverage really has
been sensationalized.
If you move on to the next
slide,
then the National Transportation
Safety Board says there
are for every
100,000 cars
in this country,
there are 1500 car
fires on electric
vehicles. That's
25. Now, if
you read the media stories, you
would think electric vehicles are bursting
in flames every single day.
You see that data right there
shows it's dramatic. I mean, if there was a
news story for every time there was a,
a car fire, I mean, that's all
the news would be right.
Uh So
now I'm not minimizing
that. I mean, it did make a little fun of
it because this is
a serious issue.
But if you look at that next quote,
NHTSA has said they
are not inherently
more dangerous than gasoline
vehicles and
they did talk about how that
they tend to be a little more.
If a vehicle does get
on fire, they do tend to
be a little more difficult
to put out than a gasoline powered
car. And
that is true and
it is a recognized safety
issue. If you move to the next slide,
please. That's
why we partnered
with the National Fire
Protection
Association
to develop the best
strategies on this. We,
we have gotten ahead of this
problem. Our association
worked with the NFP
A to develop these
best practices and then
we worked with them
to distribute this to all
the fire
uh agencies
around the country
that have the
guidelines on how best
to respond. Uh
to not only just
fires in general,
but specifically cause
each vehicle can be
turned, the power can be
turned off in different ways.
So fire agencies
now have specifically on
how to deal with model X
or model Y
vehicles
uh if they do encounter
a fire. So that, that's
important.
And then on the next
slide, there
are battery safety issues
about shipping and
things like that that we are working
with. And I just put that in there to
assure you that we are
not making light of any of the
safety issues. You have
heard that these are
important, they're critical
and we are working with battery
manufacturers
to do that.
On the next slide.
The one thing I I would caution
you is in is uh
policymakers are considering
legislation
uh
on the safety aspect of
it. Uh a lot of
times there's the biggest problems
with lithium batters have been with the
E bikes or the scooters
and that's what legislators want
to address.
Uh Unfortunately, uh
the way that some of these
laws have been crafted or
bills have been crafted
around the country, they
accidentally
include ev batteries.
And so I just caution that
uh if, if you're considering
anything like this, please work
with us. So we make
sure that your focus
is targeted at the
problem and, and
not again, not accident, uh
creating some other
solution problems.
So we move on to the next
thing. Uh we talk about
battery recycling
very quickly.
Actually, that's a bit of an,
a misnomer.
In fact, battery recycling
is the last thing.
That's the place of last
resort. It's actually
the three Rs and that's
reduce repurpose
and recycle.
Uh because EV
batteries and this is not
a problem today, but
it's going to be, the batteries
were out. Of course, they're like anything
else we have gotten
ahead of the solutions. They let,
we know we're going to be selling
millions and millions of these vehicles
in the next several years. These batteries are going
to wear out. What are we going to do with
them? Well, as
I said, recycling
is the place
of last resort. You know,
an EV battery is not
like a plastic water bottle
or aluminum can that has almost
no value and, and
needs to be recy
recycled
electric vehicle batteries
if they start to wear out may
not be, uh the
best, uh performing
anymore for an electrical. For instance, if
you bought a car and it's
getting supposed to get 400
miles per charge
and over the, you know, the decade,
maybe it gets down to
300. Well,
that, you know, that's an issue. That means
that's no longer there, but that
battery still has
tremendous
value. Even
at that 300 miles one,
it can be repaired
or refurbished and made
to go back up to that
400 or if
that isn't feasible,
repurposing
for battery storage,
whether it's battery backup
storage for power at
hospitals or
in power plants,
those batteries are
hugely uh
valuable and
important. And then
finally, if you
can't fix it
or you can't reuse it, then yes,
recycling is the
option that
needs to happen. And we
are fully on board
with the recycling that if you go to
the next
slide, not
only in the obvious
benefits of, of
recycling, but
we can also
contribute to national
security issues on
energy, create a
lot of more jobs lower
uh battery costs.
Because again,
my, you remember, I talked about the federal
program and how much so much of it is
processed in China. If we can keep
that here in the United States and reuse
it, it's very
important.
So on the next
slide, just highlight
very quickly. Well, how,
how is the A three hour
process work?
Well, if you have a
car and it's still
under warranty, it's going, the
battery problem is going to be
resolved the same exact
way it is. If it's a warranty, if it's a, if
it's a wiper blade for
a problem, the auto
manufacturer
warrants it. You,
you as the customer will go to
the, the dealer, they'll
say yes, they've got
problems. A B and
C, the auto
manufacturer will provide the parts
to the dealers, the dealers will fix it
and off the consumer
goes,
if it's past the warranty
period that we
are working with, with
Recyclers, reman
dismantler repair
shops again
to make sure which of the most viable
of the three are option is
done that and we will work with
them and
then the vehicle end of life, like I
said, if it's just can do, we
have agreed
to do something nationally
that is never
ever been done by
the automakers before.
We
will take back
the entire vehicle,
battery car and
everything. If the battery
is, the vehicle is
its end of life, we've never done that
before. But, you know, they go to the
junkyard or wherever they
go, but we will
take these vehicles back
now and that's starting now. And
that's a huge
change, a positive
change on how we're going to
make sure that all
of these batteries that are coming onto
the market are going to be properly
done.
If you go to the next slide, I'm,
I'm not going
to do that. I gave this to you for your
informational purposes.
That really kind of explains
how some of these warranty,
non warranty repairs are going to
do and that's just for you. But I, I've,
I've touched on
it on the
next
slide.
I, I talked about how that we're
taking that back. We call it the
complete vehicle battery
backstop. I'm not going to go
in as I've highlighted it. I just put
this detail for
you, but this is going to
be a, a much
better way to make sure
that these batteries don't end
up in landfills
and wasted and unused.
And policymakers
do ask me, well, why are you
taking the whole vehicle
back? Part of
it is because it's actually
safer to
transport the
battery in the vehicle
itself as to
having the battery separate.
So we are looking at it as
a, not only the, from
a three R perspective, but also
from a safety perspective
that you're not going to get
these in
inadvertent fires
or damages if
the car and battery
are one and sent back
to that.
So,
uh
that's, that's a part of the
E V's uh
collusion. And I did briefly,
uh the senator had asked me to talk
about some road
infrastructure if you
go to the next slide.
Um Some
of this you are and I'm not going to do so
if you go to the next slide,
please. Um,
you already know this. In fact, I was,
it was touched upon a little bit earlier
in the morning session.
Gas tax is failing
it. It's been a
terrific thing and it has gotten to. So,
but it's changing
and if you go to the next
slide and many of
you know, this, you know,
um
why, you
know, what, what, excuse
me, what it is, um,
is on the charge per
gallon. Uh, it's been around for
a long time. Oregon was the very first
state, 1911 to do
it. And virtually every
state by 1932
and including the federal government,
uh, had a gasoline
tax. If you go to the
next slide.
Why has it been great?
Well, it was a user fee
you only paid for what you
use and, and it was
very evenhanded
and, and generally most states
took dedicated that
tax dollars specifically back
to roads and didn't put it into
a, a general fund. And it's very
cheap and easy to
administer. Less than
1% of the
gas tax in most states
go to uh
administrative costs
that, that 99%
goes straight back to the roads
to go to the next slide.
Sadly, that's
all changing
uh between not
keeping up with inflation.
Uh The good news,
bad news is we're making cars
that are more fuel efficient,
so they don't use as much gas, don't
create as much tax.
And of course, what we've been talking
about today, electric
vehicles pay no
gas tax,
obviously.
So the next slide,
uh the biggest problem with inflation
is gas taxes
have the federal government has not changed
the gas tax since
1993.
Uh That means it's lost half
of that. So that 18 cents
that you're paying at the pump really
is only worth nine cents.
Uh, and that's a
terri, you know, terrible
on the, on your revenues.
Go to the next
slide
again. The good news, bad
news thing. Uh, our
companies have made
cars that are now 100%
more effi fuel efficient than
1975.
Uh, and so that's
great news,
uh, for the environment
but, and for consumers,
but bad news for
gas tax revenues,
uh, skip,
skipping. Uh,
the next slide, the number three,
I've talked about that
EVs don't pay any
gas tax at all.
And then the next slide,
the bonus construction
costs, they have,
they have gone through the
roof. That's a completely eaten
away at the, at the tax
base. If you go to
that next slide, that's the
graphical representation
of highway construction
costs over the last several
years. And
needless to say if the trend
is not our friend
there. So
the next slide, uh
what can be
done if you move to the
next slide,
there are some
options.
There are taxing the
vehicles with
fees,
their vehicle, mile travel
taxes and
taxes on electricity.
If you go to the next slide.
Now, for many years,
our companies had said that
ev fees were the worst
way to f fund
road infrastructure
for several reasons. They were
regressive. They
didn't, did not,
the flat fee does not reflect
how many, if you're driving, you know,
the 500
miles a year or 50,000
miles a year you were paying the, the,
the same fee,
it added a fee
upfront, the cost of
the purchases of the car
type of thing. So,
we had been that
way. So turning
the page,
uh, there's
VMTS,
the MTs have been
considered, you know, there's a,
you know, whether, you know,
five cents a mile, two
cents a mile. Uh,
there are problems
with, uh, and as well
with that, there's, it's, uh, it
is good news, it's
progressive. Uh
It's not a lot of upfront
money, uh,
but it often
requires GPS
tracking of the
mileage.
Uh And probably
most important. Uh, some
of the polling data uh
has been that
consumers aren't very happy
when they don't like that model. I think they're,
some of it is generally
because they think that, you know,
and, and they're not, but quote,
the government is spying
on my driving end
quote. Uh
And administrative costs
are significantly more. I have
had the privilege of sitting
on three different
states, road
user charge
valuation, uh,
committees and
in all three states came
to the same conclusion
that the administrative costs
for a VMT program
is 8 to 10%
of the revenues.
So that means for every
dollar of gasoline tax,
you really are gonna have to charge
a fee of the dollar 10
because those admin getting
those dollars back
because of the makeup of
the extra costs
are significant. And so that's
a, a problem.
And then I mentioned if you go to the
next slide, people
tend not to like these
things. Uh Santo
State University
did a study
said 61% of the
people did not
like the vehicle miles traveled
model. And
nearly half of those
61% of the people
said they really didn't
like it. So that's,
that's not good for
policymakers, not good for us
trying to sell if you move on
to the next slide.
obviously, if
39%
of people aren't opposed to a taxi
model, you know, we can't, we,
we have to sell to 100 percent
if we move on to the next
slide.
Another consideration
is kind
of like a gas tax but on
electricity,
uh again, many
advantages
uh this, you know, it's,
it's progressive.
It's only when you use
it. It's not, there's no
upfront costs,
but there are
challenges to setting the right
rates, whether it's
through your utility
commissions or the utilities
themselves.
Um There's
also some uh
issues about
uh difference between public
and, and home charging, things
like that. But it is an
option if you
move on to the
next slide, if, if you recall,
we used to say that the
EV fees were the
worst way to do it.
Well,
we've kind of changed our
longstanding position
and if we, and
by what we mean is
reasonable
fees
is that if the tax
is similar to what
the average
cost for what
folks are paying on the gasoline
tax. This may
be the, the the
model again,
lower administrative
cost. There's no up
uh very, you know,
reasonable upfront
costs. There's no
issues that people think the
government is tracking them
and all that kind of stuff.
So that is an option, move
on to the next slide.
Uh And then also
considering both the combination
of fee and an
electric tax.
Um And
we think that
again is worthy of
consideration with one
tiny caveat
is not putting it on
non-residential
uh that there's
non-residential level
two public charging
is already more expensive
than your home because you've
got a intermediary
who's got, you know, in the charge
equipment, they need to make their money
back. So we don't think
adding a tax onto an already
more expensive electric
uh bill is probably the way
to go. Plus going
back to the equity points.
A lot of people may end up having
to charge in public charging.
So they're gonna have to have higher
costs anyway. So let's not
exasperate that
problem. So if
you go to the next slide
and mercifully uh
for you, the
conclusion of my
remarks are
that the auto industry,
if you haven't told we are
completely committed
to an electrified future.
There is no doubt that
is where this country is going
and we will be part of
that. But there are
several challenges
having accepting
the mandate and the goal of this
country to make an electrified
transportation. There are challenges
and we've talked about them. I'm not
going to go over them again.
We need help on creating
those uh
conditions to make it
better. And there's
constant and additional
collaboration between our
companies, the
dealers that sell our
vehicles, the
the companies
that provide the chargers,
the utilities
and most importantly
with the policymakers that
are setting these rules.
And so that again,
it is a positive
but not,
not
totally clear
on how we're going to to reach
those goals and we look
forward to working with you
and I'm, I'm happy to answer any questions,
Mr Chair and members. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Thank you for your
excellent uh
presentation. Mr Augustine's
certainly one of the most comprehensive
reports I've heard.
Um
So we have
a peop several people who would
like to ask questions
first one up to
Senator
Gayles
>> Mr Chairman. Thank you and
thank you for the, the only
two presentation I do
have just a few
questions. Uh starting on
page eight,
I get there.
Uh You're talking
about
the 5%
1.5%
decrease. Do you
know why that is as
far as New Mexico.
What's the rationale
behind the decrease
when it's a mandate?
We have the increase.
>> Yes, Mister
Chair and
Senator generally
there, it's representative of what's
kind of been happening around the
country that I think
specifically here in New Mexico and
I don't have real
data. This is just kind of my
educated guess is
that there's some of the
costs uh there was just the
demand, There's been a
Tesla's
sales have dropped
off dramatically around
the country and a lot of
that percentage are
their sales uh
drop off. And so
it's again, it's somewhat reflective
of what it has just
been going around the, the country.
>> Ok. Well, thank you for
that. And, and I guess Mr
Chair, gentlemen,
um,
my next question. So
let me give you some history. My
daughter about a
hybrid and
within the first four months,
little light came on on her
dash. She took
it to the dealer, they reset
it because the battery was
going out first four
months. So in
her wisdom,
went to a different dealer
traded back in for
gasoline
because she didn't want to have to deal with the
battery. Do we have
any stats on how many have
been returned
and not put back
into uh hybrid
or electrical?
>> Mr Chair and
Senator, the
uh percentage numbers are quite
low. I'm sorry, first, all
that your daughter has had to
do things that is quite
unusual. Uh
and if it was, if it
was a new vehicle, I mean,
that, that does, uh, fall
into the warranty aspects and we,
and, um, so it's
unclear, obviously, I don't really
know the details of it.
The, uh, percentage
of vehicles that are returned
is, is quite low. And in fact,
it's, it's really quite, if you look
at, uh, customer
satisfaction, uh, of
electric vehicle owners, it's, it's off
the chart. People love
them. I mean, when they first get
in them, they're my gosh,
why didn't I do this years
ago? And so, uh,
unfortunately, um,
your daughter had a, uh,
uh, an aberration
of, again,
I'm sorry to hear about
that. >> I
appreciate that. Let me
turn this phone off.
Uh, it's going
to my ear, uh,
Mr chair and, and then
gentlemen, I, I guess my next
question is, uh, what
happens? Uh,
if New Mexico doesn't
reach our mandate and, and I know
there's, uh, some
overall penalties,
uh, just
thinking through the numbers you gave
today, uh, or
would,
what would be
the,
I guess our options if
we get to the point in time that we're
not at the
numbers we need. And
I know we have some infrastructure
pro problems.
Uh,
some of that's beyond our
control. Uh,
but if we don't, if New
Mexico doesn't, not caring about the
rest of the country, if New
Mexico doesn't, what are
the next steps? And what does it
do to us as a state.
>> Mr Chair members uh
first off, uh those
numbers will
be hit because those are
a manufacturing
and offer to sale
mandate. There's not a sales
mandate. So
our companies
absolutely will hit
those because if they don't and
you touched on it, there
are severe and
significant penalties that will
be issued
by this, that's, that's the law,
that's the rule by the state. So our
companies will hit
those numbers. And again,
I think that's, that's to
reiterate that that isn't, those
numbers aren't a sales
mandate. They are a
manufacturing mandate.
So that is something we could
control and our companies
will hit those numbers.
Now, the challenge
and I suspect your
uh uh third
speaker of the day will address this from the
dealers. The
challenges selling them
are those vehicles
will be on dealers, laws,
will people buy them? And
that's the question and
then kind of the other
half of your question
that we are, you know, we are very,
very concerned with our as
are our dealer partners on
that issue. But again,
we will hit those numbers.
Now, what that really means to
the buying public?
That is an open question at this
point. >> Well, thank you for
that Mr Chair. Just
a couple more. So you're
talking earlier about the level
three uh
charging in
250 to 500
miles range. Uh
Do you know what the average
range for
electric vehicle is? Just to
give you some background on
it. I was in Las Las Vegas
for a committee
hearing and I have to be at
the hotel. There's two people sitting
out front, I'm sitting there,
visit with them. They'd
left Albuquerque headed
to Colorado Springs.
They're gonna have to sit there in
that hotel for two
hours to be able to
make the rest of their
trip. And I just
wonder, to me that's an awful
small window of
mileage. You know, if, if you
left home,
uh with, with just
thinking through your 500
miles
distance,
they made to Las Vegas and
they had to pull over and
endure coffee
and conversation for
two hours. I don't mind speaking,
but I don't think that's what they
wanted. Uh, you know,
they're, they're sitting in their
open area
that I got to ask questions
on, but I just didn't know if you
had an average
point to point and I know
the vehicles are going to matter
if you have a pickup or if you have a
car, there's going
to be some differences. But I
didn't know if the industry had an
average. >> Yes, Mr Chair,
remember? Yes, that's a great
question.
Battery uh
capabilities are
dramatically increasing and,
and generally it's about
300 miles
per charge
that you can get on that and that's
getting very
equivalent to AAA
gasoline powered car.
II, I drive
a gasoline powered car and,
and I tend to get somewhere
between three and 400
miles in a full tank of gas.
So that's very, very similar.
So folks that are
driving these long distances
should not have a
problem. But that's to your
point about the charging times.
That's why it's important on these
longer on the
interstates and things like that,
that they have the level three charging.
So it's only going to take 20
minutes and not the two
hours that you would see on a
level two charger
>> deal. Well, thank you for that.
I wrote down those 300 miles
so I can explain to my
daughter. But
Mr, and my
last question is
on page 72. You're
talking about
the battery fires and it says a little
more difficult
to put out a fire
and thinking about the engine
of the gasoline
engine. Are you
looking at battery fires
on gasoline engine
or are you looking at
the uh
combustion
part? I guess
I'm trying to figure out, I've
heard that on the
battery side, it is
pretty difficult to put
them out, you almost have to let them
burn themselves out
where on a gasoline
side, you still
have the phones in the, in the water
that will, will stop
the fire. And I was just trying
to figure out are we talking battery
battery or the whole
engine to the whole
battery, >> Mr
chairman. So speaking on
this, we're talking about, you know, the electric
vehicle, the battery being, you
know, on fire and
engaged
and with the gasoline,
you know, it's, it's generally
the vehicle, right? The gasoline
doesn't let, I mean, it burns up pretty
quickly as the vehicle
that's around. So, and there's
no, there is no
doubt that if uh
an electric vehicle
battery catches
on fire, it, do you know, it
takes a little more effort.
Uh And that's why we in
recognition of that,
um that we did
work with the
National Fire Protection
Organizations to
create guidelines and
models as to how
to do that. And it,
um, you know, it does
require more water,
but they can generally
put them out. I mean, to your
question about where they just have to be
burnt out. Uh
Not if you
know what you're doing.
Um And that, that's why we again
have worked with these organizations
so that fire departments know what
they're dealing with.
And again, from
even the nuances between
individual um
uh vehicles as
well as standard fire
fighting uh techniques
are, are being taught.
>> Well, thank you for that Mr Chair. And
I guess what I like from what
I'm hearing is that they've actually
looking at national standard
because if we
piece mail it from New Mexico to
Texas to California,
things are gonna be different
unless we talk
standardizing. So,
with that Mr
Iy,
>> I'm going to
go.
Thanks for,
thanks.
So,
yeah,
percent.
Yeah,
>> I thank you chair and thank
you once again
for such an
in-depth uh
presentation
uh all
102
of it or three
of it. Um And,
and I will say one of, and
I'm just reiterating what
you have already
said, but just actually
for our Zoom viewers.
Um It is very
clear to me in this
presentation
is, is
that you
want to make sure that the
committee is aware
that this is not
a goal
or a regulation
that requires
an adjustment in
manufacturing or
an investment in chargers,
but it is a cultural
shift. It
is, it is not
gas stations we're
at for 10 minutes.
It is
building an
infrastructure
of charging
stations that
may have coffee shops
and shopping opportunities,
which is an economic
driver
for those areas
that are willing to have charging
stations.
Um That this
is
a, you know, I don't know how many
times in my
driving life where
I said, oh, I'll just stop
here real quick and get
gas. So
there is a a
very deep
cultural
shift
and you have clearly
communicated in this,
that know that this is a
commitment.
I appreciate your
clarity on the
differences between
charging stations. 12 and
three and that let's not
even bother with one. I
hear you.
Um
um and um
and I appreciate you
giving actual numbers
of the charging stations
know that we have.
Um I, I've
know some of my fellow
legislators with
evs
who have
had challenges finding
those high speed, those
those level three charging
stations around the state.
Um And so
I do appreciate this.
I think that this is a
great information,
as you said, as
we move forward to
see, but this
is not just an
investment in charging
stations, this may have
to be an investment
in
infrastructure
for what it
means to refuel.
Um and, and
the education for the
public as well.
And, and I'm sorry, I don't
really have a question because
you have 100 and three slides
and you answered all my
questions.
But um but I just want
to reiterate for the
Zoom audience
there of, of at least
with the takeaway here is that
this is a cultural
shift, not just
a regulation. And
so thank you, >> Mr
Chair. Remember first off, you can
thank the chairman for the
length of the presentation. That was
what I was asked
to have a thorough and lengthy
discussion. So that's what we did. You can
thank you for that. And, and, and I'm
glad that
I was able to deliver that. This
is again, more
than just making cars kind of
thing. This is going to be a
transformation
uh in our society. And
I, I'm glad that you're able to
because it's uh
because again,
we are going to see a
radical difference in the way
people are just going to be
driving their cars around
and, and fueling them up and,
and the expectation
levels they have. And again, and
we are particularly
concerned about not
leaving uh folks
behind uh because
it's, it's again, as I
said earlier, we've
got the single family house
getting its charger down.
That's that model's
there, that's happening. It's,
it's the other half of the
country that don't live in, in
that. And we're getting
very concerned about that
and appreciate your uh uh
noting that and thank you
very much for your kind
comments.
>> Well, it's actually
representative next up. We have
Representative
Herden,
thank you, Mr Chair
and thank you for the
presentation and particularly
talking about the collaboration
that needs to occur
between the legislature
as policymakers and
with your industry. So
just uh five quick
questions. So the first
one is with respect
to uh putting
out these EV
stations. One of
the things that we're gonna have to do is
increase our career
technical education
in our schools so that we have people
who have ability to build
these EV stations.
So what is the bigger
plan and strategy
that the automobile industry
has put forth to
help us make Sure that that happens.
Yes, >> Mr Chair,
remember uh great
question. Uh especially on
the personal interest on the
career, technical education. At one
point in my career, I
actually ran a
nonprofit for the construction
industry that was devoted to
getting CTE back
in the high schools and middle schools
of our country.
Uh So it's a
critically important. So
we are are to the
to the point of your
question. Uh Our companies
are working with
charger companies
on uh developing
uh training
programs. Uh
We also uh
not all of our companies, but
several of them are unionized
uh through with the
United Autoworkers. We are working,
those companies are working
with, with their members
uh on, on developing
education programs.
It, it's a
and we, we're also
in many state
uh uh not state
departments but depart
states and departments and
states uh with the
education issue, we're working with
them to, to try to
emphasize that this need
is out there. We
also partner
and I personally do quite a bit of
work with the International Brotherhood
of Electrical workers
on developing their, with
our programs developed in
enhancing and getting
uh and making awareness
of their f fantastic
uh apprenticeship programs.
Uh They're, you know, they're the
ones who are generally doing the work
because a good chunk of
work is
generally uh
funded in some way
by some government entity.
And there's often requirements
uh you know, for training and that and
that's where it's coming
from with the apprenticeship
programs. >> So,
thank you. So I hope that means that
they're willing to be teachers
and to help in this uh
educational component.
That's good
>> Mr Chair. Remember that?
I mean, that's probably one of the bigger
jobs. I mean, the apprenticeship programs
are certainly well versed.
I mean, they're, they're, you know,
they are teaching uh young
men and women how to be uh
electrical workers. But
finding that the, the
teachers I think is, is, is,
is one of the biggest, the
coursework there. Uh
willing students are
coming but finding the
teachers is a big challenge.
>> Yes. So thank
you. So with respect
to the growth of
manufacturing, uh
I think it was batteries, it's
gonna grow
649%
is one of those
manufacturing uh
locations in New
Mexico at
all.
>> Mr Chair. Remember, you know, I
don't know off the
top of my head, I certainly can find
out. I'm not, I'm not
aware of any
but that does. But my
awareness level is far
from complete on that issue.
>> Yeah. Well, Mr Chair,
Mr presenter, the reason I ask
is that I looked at it
all of the
information that you're presenting about
New Mexico shows us at
the bottom. But I also
need to make sure how we're gonna be
continuing to grow in
this aspect as this,
as this industry
grows. And then
the other item is if
we look at
um
we look at these neighborhoods
where we saw these EV
stations along the lines, but
we saw that in low income
neighborhoods, we didn't
see these cars being
driven. So
help me to understand what the
strategy is to get
the reduction in
cost of these cars
so that they can be
utilized and adopted
at a greater aspect
even in low income neighborhoods.
>> So Mr
Chair members,
the uh
using the, I don't
know, always harp on California,
but because they've done more
than most states, I'll use some of those
examples. So there
are uh rebate
programs uh
for
both new and more
importantly used
vehicle EVs
uh because, you know,
unfortunately of low
and moderate income people can't
necessarily afford a brand new
car. Uh but
they should not be ruled
out of the EV market and
getting an assistance on the used
car vehicles. There is
also work
with the California Energy
Commission and the Resources
Board on
incentivizing charger
stations to be put
in to low
income areas. So they,
whether it's both public
or helping uh
apartment owners with
their, you know, their add on cost.
So there are a lot of programs
that are helping uh to
address these
costs because they,
you know, they can be quite expensive.
I mean, even for,
you know, a shopping center
that happens to be in a low
income there, uh running
the conduit out to the
parking lot, uh can
be quite expensive. They have to dig up
the, dig up the lot and
that kind of thing. So there, there's a lot
of disincentives for
people not to
put in. And we're
hoping to turn that around
again, working with uh
government, both
both statewide
uh and local. A
lot of the programs
are actually uh funded
by local governments
as well.
>> Mr Chair, I'll start with this
last question. One of
the things that you talked about is in
terms of housing and
then not having
uh EV stations and
are they gonna have the buildings
so that they could plug
in their cars or whatever they need
to do? Are you suggesting
that us as legislators
that what we need to do is to have a
policy in place
that for example, no houses
built after 2030
can be built unless it has
an EV station included
in it. Is that part of, are you
talking about >> Mr
Chairman, uh partly
not necessarily having the
electric um
charger there
but having the building codes
in place so
that they can't do so
new, let's say that new apartments being
built right now, they
are having it to be
uh EVs
ready so that
it's they can put a
charger. But to the, the, the
requirements that we have been
able to secure passes
in other states
require, you've got
to, you've got to have everything right
up into the charger.
You don't have to put the charger
in, but you got to build
it that way and that can
be both apartments as
well as new home
construction. Now, I
have to be honest, homebuilders
and some uh
other contractors aren't
thrilled with those rules.
But again,
you know, we're going
to be building homes
that are gonna last 100
years and if people are
going to be driving, then they,
you know, we've got to adapt to the
future, we cannot have them do it
and the retrofit costs
are uh
astronomical.
So let's
let's start moving
forward. And
the cost of adding
those on a new home
construction is
is really quite the
minimis.
>> Well, thank you Mr Chair and thank
you Mr Presenter, but I, I really
like this concept of this
collaboration between the
policymakers and those in the
industry so that we
are working together to make this
successful. Thank
you.
Thank you, >> Mr I
spoke
Senator.
Thank you, Mr Chairman
and thank you,
I really don't have a
question but just a couple
of comments unless you wish to
respond. Uh
The first is what
I really appreciate about your
presentation
is that you mentioned both plus
and minuses, you know, the pros and
cons and
as we're going with
this and
then also as it was
mentioned by Representative
Gates is
that paradigm
shift. And one
thing that you didn't mention, but
I think is also
viewing
the information that's coming
to us is a
lot of tools that
are gas powered anymore
are electric,
you know, and that is,
you know, that changed really
quick too in the last,
especially the last five years,
almost everything that is built
anymore from power
source to lawnmowers
to you know, our
electric. So, you
know, it is the
future, as you're
saying that it's
going but um Uh
again, thank you.
And uh there was a lot
of information but
>> uh Mr Chairman, first
off, uh you're very welcome.
Thank you for your uh kind comments.
And the one thing I would tell
it's I did not
talk a a great deal
about because I think some of your other presenters
will, but the the
demand for
electricity is not
only from new electric
vehicles, but everything you suggested
really is is
going to be a paramount
issue uh in our view
for policymakers to
address because electric
needs for that, just this
state that all over the country are
going to go up
dramatically. Uh
We've all seen what
happens when there's a a
an extra hot summer and
the load management
issues and, and by adding
literally hundreds of
thousands of new electric
vehicles in the next few
years in this state is is going
to exasperate that. And so there
are grid management
needs and there's also the
ability for vehicles
to help be part of that
solution in the vehicle
to grid is where uh you can
down, you know, you can upload
download energy from
cars, you know, we're
working with many utilities
uh to have vehicles have those
capabilities and many more are
going to. So that
the takeaway from your very
important point is that
the emphasis on
grid management and
load and functionality
is is critical. Uh
if we're all going to be
succeeding, and I would strongly
encourage you to again to work
with your utilities and puc
on, on thinking
this forward as we move into
the future. Thank
you. Thank you, >> Mr Chairman.
Thank
you.
Is there anyone else?
Representative
Allison? Thank
you, Mr
Chair.
My question is based on
slide number 33 and
34
ok. The
three levels of
charging
slide 34 I
interpreted it to
say three
levels of charging depending
on how far you want to
go.
Ok? And then the
slide 34
it gives you three levels
at three different
voltages.
So if you're gonna charge
your vehicle,
are you gonna have three
outlets so that you
can uh
charge at three
levels of voltages?
>> Uh Mr Chair? Remember?
Excellent question and and
that those voltages are,
are the input to the
charger, not the output
from the charger to the vehicle.
So the vehicle won't,
you can roll up to a level
two or level three using this the
same plug and
that type of thing. But that's that
just show that those
graphics just show the the
type of um
you know how conduit
and power that you need to get to
that charger. And so
for instance, many house like
your uh electric dryer
could handle the level two
without any uh panel
changes and things like that. But that's
another important
consideration for
people even at their homes
is to making sure that they upgrade
their panels to the right
electric aspect. But
no, the bottom line to your question
is a
consumer
of a car is going to roll up
to no matter what the charger
is. And it's gonna be the, it's the,
you know, the same charger by whether it's a
fast charger or
a a level two.
>> Ok. Thank you for
that
Mr Chair.
Also,
I'm an electrician by
trade
and I know how much
damage 120 votes can
do to a person.
But yet with
the long-range
chargers, 480
votes,
are we putting the general
public at a higher
risk?
That's a dangerous voltage.
480 volts.
What kind of action are we taking
to safeguard the
general public?
>> Uh Mr Chairman?
So uh the charging
aspect is not something that
I'm terribly well versed
on, but I think that by
all accounts that are very,
again, that power is not
actually exposed to the
public. I, I suppose if
somebody was mischievous and decided
to cut into the charger or the
power line, I mean, you're kind of
asking for some
trouble there, but in terms
of risk to the public,
I mean, those chargers are
all certified
and the amount again, the amount
of electricity that
they're physically
be exposed to it, I, I don't
believe, and again, I, I would
defer to, to experts
and, and yourself, I don't believe
there's really any inherent,
more risk using
that than any other
electrical device that,
you know.
>> Ok. So
what is the
uh average voltage
on an electric
vehicle,
you know, uh, with our gasoline
engines we run on
12 or 24
volt system.
What is the average uh
voltage on a electric
vehicle? >> Uh
It's a little, you know, I
Mr Chair remember,
uh I don't know the
exact number, but
it's not significantly
higher than what you would see out
of AAA lead acid
battery that's currently in
most cars. It's a little bit
more but it's not
dramatically greater. But
there are, but
now having said that
there are inherently
more risk, uh
if somebody is
handling improperly,
handling, handling an
electric vehicle battery or
batteries than they would be if they were just
using a, you know, plain old
lead acid battery,
but that you would,
you would have to
want to
do that. I mean, these,
these batteries are under
the frame of the car.
I mean, you, there's,
there's absolutely no reason
a normal regular consumer
would ever have any interaction
uh with a battery in a
vehicle. And these
are, and these batteries are,
are not light, they, we
2000 pounds.
So if somebody's gonna be
monkeying around trying to unhook
their battery, they're gonna have
bigger problems
than
they think they are
going to to have
so. >> Ok.
Thank you for that. Thank you Mr
Chair
to ask a question,
Representative
Garcia. >> Uh Thank
you. Thanks for the presentation.
What brought it up to mind now
was the 2000 pound
batteries,
have you taken in
consideration
what is gonna do to the trucking
industry that
transport these cars back and
forth on, on our country?
Because right now as it stands,
you can only haul 80,000
pounds and I'm
just using wrong numbers. If
you're hauling 10 cars
that we 40,000
pounds in, in the
truck and trailer
make the
80,000.
Now you're adding 2000 pounds
per car. So that's another
20,000 pounds.
So this driver that is getting
paid by car for
transporting them instead
of transporting 10. Now,
you can only transport six of
them. >> Uh Mr Chair.
Remember uh excellent
uh questions first off.
Uh Yes, the batteries weigh
more, but don't
forget that you don't have
a gasoline powered engine
in that car more than those can
sometimes weigh up to 800
pounds. So the, the electric
vehicle still will weigh, but maybe
it only weighs 1000 pounds
more, not the, the 2000
pounds just
again, just so you know that. But
to your uh bigger
question about the trade. In fact, we
are working uh, with
both the, the teamsters
organizations, other
and the, the trucking
contractors and the federal government
to address that very
thing. And and then, uh, allowing,
uh, some higher weight standards
and, uh, doing that both
on the federal and state
levels, um,
to make sure
that these trucks
are able to
get on our roads. I mean, it's
been instructive,
uh, in the, some
of the southern states in our
country where most
of new automobile
manufacturing is occurring.
They've had the way that they,
they couldn't, to, your point, couldn't
haul them out of their own
factory and they've had to
make some adjustments. So it's a,
it's a very legitimate
issue you've raised
and one that we are trying to get ahead
of so that we don't have
the, the, the nightmares
situation as you're
thinking about. Yeah,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman.
And on the, on the weight
part you
mentioned
no gas engine. But,
you know, I've talked to
car dealers,
uh, around the
state and these
cars weigh up to 2000
pounds more than a
regular gas engine,
regardless the engine
or no engine. And I know we don't have no
muffler and all that stuff.
They still weigh that much more
and, and, and the damage
that's going to be done to our roads
and other questions
because, you know, we're taking
the tax off,
but we're putting more
weight
on our highways. And
then as we know, we talk about
it, you know, New Mexico has
some of the worst highways on
the nation.
>> Uh, Mr Chair. Remember
the, uh, we
often hear about
the increased vehicle weight
and the damage on the
road. Uh, both
are my own previous experience,
uh, in the
transportation industry and what
this is when you think
about it's even use
your worst case scenario,
representative of 2000
pounds that is,
is really
insignificant on
a weight bearing
onto the highways to do any
damage when you're comparing it to an
8000. Also think about
it. Uh, if, if a
car, uh,
when you're driving by yourself
and you put four or five
family members in and they're all
adult men,
maybe weighing 200 pounds. You've just
added 1000 pounds right there.
Nobody ever considers
saying, oh, we, what's the
damage of a fully
loaded car
compared to an empty car? You
and that, and then, and that's the
numbers that we are
talking about
between the difference between a gasoline
powered car and, and an
electric car. So that
the empirical
evidence on any
ro road
wear damage on
with the,
you know, in
marginally small
weight increase that electric vehicles
do on that. It's, it's
just, it's not there, it's not been
proven out by folks
who are setting that.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman.
And you know, I'd like to see a car in
New Mexico have been built that
can carry five people
weigh 200 pounds, never
seen it. You
know, I know where you're coming from,
but I'm coming back
at the same thing. You know, these
cars, we a lot more
than, than
regular cars and the
trucking industry is gonna take a
beating on it because they can't haul
as many cars as they should be
able to. And we need to
look at these things also
because, you know, these truck drivers make
a living on,
they don't go by the pound, they go
by the car, they can haul on them.
So
>> Mr Chairman II, I think of
all the points you've raised
the trucking
aspect of it. That
is actually a legitimate
real world issue. And
as we are trying to, to get ahead
of that because that there's no
doubt that that
could impact a lot
of people and that we are
working on with,
you know, all these folks in the
industry to, to come to some
solution. But I'd say that's,
that is a thing that you
have flagged that is still does need
work. Absolutely. So I
appreciate you bringing it to my
attention. >> Thank
you. Thank you for the presentation.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. >> Thank
you representative.
Uh Thanks again for being here.
Excellent presentation.
I got uh one quick
comment, two
questions
in the interest of time. I'll
accept
short answers.
So, are you, are you aware the
city of uh Albuquerque
recently amended its building
code to
require the
installation of infrastructure
for electric chargers on new
construction
>> Mr Chair. No, no, I wasn't.
That's a terrific, that's terrific
news. So that's
great.
>> So
um and the
kilowatt hour
tax,
how would you diff if you're,
how would you, would they be able to
differentiate the amount of
electricity use, charging your
car from the
re
from the rest of your
household use? >> Mr
That, that, that's uh
that is one of the challenges.
So that's why we're, we're
not necessarily recommending,
but that uh
how has how
excuse me, how it has
been dealt with in other
places? Sometimes there's 2 m on
the house, one that goes
straight to the uh
charger and one just for the
rest of the house.
Uh There are other
states who are contemplating
just a a discounted rate
if you have an electric vehicle,
they're assuming how
much electricity doing. So there's a
lot of there, there is not
one answer to
your question and it's, it's a very
important question
that has several different
possible answers. >> Now.
Well, I have electric charger
but if I charge after 10 o'clock
I get a lower rate. So they're
differentiating there.
Right. So, there shouldn't be any problem
with the other.
Right,
>> Mr Chair, you would
think so.
That's, but
we, we hear things
from utilities. They, they complain
about that a lot. So, but
we, we tend to agree with you,
sir. >> They're
working on it but they're not there yet.
Right. So,
ok. And the second and last
question is
uh what is your
organization's prediction about
making the batteries lighter and
cheaper?
>> Uh Mr Chair? Uh
Absolutely,
they are, they are going to
be uh lighter that
those developments are, are literally
occurring almost every
week. Uh They're going to
be cheaper, they're going to be. There are new
technologies that are coming. Uh
recently
uh Toyota has
announced a completely
different style getting away from
a lithium uh
ion battery and,
and uh a completely
remodeled that is much
lighter, much if they can get 600
miles per charge. They're
saying so, and there are
other technologies that
are uh being online.
So, yes, it's, it's
happening uh how
fast all of those are going
to be occurring, but they're,
you know, the trend is definitely
moving in the right direction.
>> So, thank you. It's not a word. It's
not a matter of if it's a matter
of when
>> uh Mr Chair. Yes. And
again, there are some,
yeah, the technologies are improving,
there's still, you know, supply
chain issues
that are beyond most of
our control. And that's,
you know, those are
variables that are out
there but,
but generally
everything is moving to
cheaper and
uh higher volume, etcetera.
OK. >> Thank you for that answer. Thank
you again for being here.
And um
our next presentation
is Ted
Smith, president
and Chief operating Officer
of NOVI.
No.
Uh so,
Mister Smith,
take it
away.
I
Yeah,
welcome.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
So you need to get a little closer
to them. Who's
your,
if you turn on the button,
it's showing red?
Ok.
>> Uh So yes,
thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Thank you, Mr Chairman, members
of the committee.
Um Thank you for having me here
today. Uh My name is
Ted Smith.
I'm the president and chief
operating officer of NOVI.
Um We're headquartered in San
Diego. We're a technology
company. Um We're a
software company that
has a technology called
Vehicle to Grid.
I've been with the company since
2010. Uh I
was on the founding
team. I was a founding
investor, uh been
on the board since then.
Um And it's been
a tremendous journey so far
and it's uh it's great to
be here um
to introduce the
subject of
vehicle to grid. Um
My presentation is
nowhere near as
comprehensive
um as
as my predecessor
um uh I
expect um and hope
to make up some time for you.
So, um you get back
on track.
Um
Just a quick overview
of new.
Um I'm on the
slide three.
There we go.
So um
NVI is a
vehicle to grid
technology pioneer.
We have over
uh 25 years
of research and development
that we've done on the
subject of vehicle to grid.
Um We've also been
in commercial mode
with over eight years of
continuous commercial vehicle
to grid operations.
Um And we started doing this
in Europe. We
have over 500
chargers uh
deployed
and um experience
in managing over 26
megawatts under management
across five
continents.
We had, we are headquartered
in San Diego
and we are a public company.
So I'm obliged uh
to say that um the
views that I express here
are my own.
This is not a solicitation
to sell securities or give
investment advice.
Uh This presentation may
contain forward-looking
statements um
but actual reso results
may differ
and additional information on
risk factors can be found
on our most recent
10-K and 10 QSEC
filings that are available
on the investors tab on
our website
um on the slide
four
um an
overview of our platform.
Um We call it the give
platform that
stands for grid integrated
vehicle. Our
uh our G give
platform harnesses
the latent power
that's stored in electric
vehicle batteries
and um sells
it back to the grid
on behalf of our customers.
So it is an
aggregation technology
employing a virtual power
plant
and we are able to aggregate
those those
vehicles into a virtual power
plant to sell energy
back to the grid, provide
grid services.
Um And we can get
paid for those services.
We can do some wonderful things
with those payments such as lower the
total cost of the
vehicles and
also integrate those
vehicles more intelligently into
the grid. Um
So yes, we do uh
provide
recurring revenues from those
grid services. We
reduce total cost of ownership
and we have been deploying an A I
solution that
helps us
accurately predict
when capacity is available
from those fleets to
provide to the grid. It
also helps us accurately
predict when to
charge and when to
discharge those
vehicles
under slide.
Five.
Um Like I
said, uh the
technology has had
decades of development
was actually created
by an academic unit at the
University of Delaware
starting in
1996.
Um which is
uh uh way before
Nuvia came into existence as
a company to to commercialize
the technology in
2010.
Um We went public
um in
2021
and have been working
on scaling our technology
globally
on the slide
six, please.
Thank you.
New, sits at the intersection
of transportation and
energy. Um
Our give platform makes
use of fleet vehicles
when they're parked, which
is most of the time,
thereby turning them into reliable,
dispatchable and monetti
assets.
This helps to reduce
the total cost of ownership while
helping the grid become more
resilient, thereby
accelerating the transition to
clean
energy.
So a little bit
on what vehicle to grid
technology is
if you could go to slide eight.
Thank you.
So, vehicle to grid technology
enables us to aggregate electric
vehicles into a virtual power
plant in order
to provide services to the grid
in a bidirectional
fashion.
New's give platform
has three basic
components. It
has an aggregator
which knows the available
resources
to aggregate. These are the
vehicles, the charging stations,
the stationary batteries,
we aggregate all those into a
virtual power plant.
It has the grid module which
receives a signal
from the grid and thereby knows
the needs of the grid on a second
by second basis.
And then we have an optimization
engine which matches
the two on one another
on a second by second
basis. To respond
to the grid
needs.
Vehicle to grid technology
is critical to the
energy transition because
ev as as the ev
adoption increases
the power demands from all those
ev loads will
otherwise strain grid
infrastructure.
So vehicle to grid makes the
vehicles a part of the solution
versus a part of the
problem.
Slide nine, please. Thank
you.
So what do you need for vehicle
to grid to happen?
Well, you need bidirectional
capable electric vehicles
and as you heard
from the prior
uh conversation that we
had, um
these are
here and
more are on the
way.
You also need bidirectional
cable charging
stations.
Those are also here
and more are on the
way and
you need a
platform such
as Novi's give platform
to
manage and
scale the
technology.
How does it work? Well,
basically just
like any other session
of charging your car, you plug
it in,
you can charge your
battery
and then while
it's parked and
plugged into the charger,
you can make money
by ser servicing
the grid by using
the, the the latent
power that's in, that's in the
vehicles. Or you
can help save costs behind the
meter. You may
not be connected to the grid.
You may just be trying to save
costs such as demand
charges and you can
use the vehicles in order to do
that.
Of course, they are
vehicles, they need to be used for
their intended purpose which is
driving. So
our promise is that
we make sure that the vehicle
has the state of charge,
you need it before
you get in the car. So
you or the truck or the
bus uh so
that you can drive it as
you
require.
Slide 10. Thank
you.
We believe that vehicle to grid is a
a critical enabler
for the energy transition.
Um For example,
NVI has been using aggregated
electric
buses,
um school bus
fleets to
discharge energy back to the
grid during times of
peak demand. In
order to alleviate grid pressure
from what's called the duck
curve.
Now we're turning
these electric vehicle
fleets into virtual power
plants demonstrating
our vehicle to grid hun hub
hub concept.
And this is very impactful
where for example,
as you can see on
the right 200 buses
from a vehicle to grid hub
could bring enough capacity
to reduce the peak
consumption of 10,000 homes
by
50%
Lyle. Thank
you.
But just having a cool technology
is not enough. You've
got to product ize it and that's
what we've done.
Um Our product ized
vehicle to grid technology
um is, is
something we've done. Um We've
turned, turned it into
commercially available
solution set.
That's delighting our customers.
Our customers enjoy the benefits
of intelligent electrification
such as lower costs,
costs of monitoring
and integration with the
grid. And
this is important. We have
to monitor those chargers.
We have to make sure they work
because if they don't
work for the
customer, they're not
gonna work for us.
So we put a lot of time talent
and treasure into the customer
experience to make
sure that those
vehicles are working
as they should and the
charging sessions happen
when it when they
should.
We also lower the total
cost of ownership while creating
energy equity
um which is helping
to boost resilience
and reliably
integrating uh the
renewables. A lot
of the school bus fleets that we're
working with. They're in
disadvantaged communities.
This is where we need them to
be. Um
because those are communities
that for example, in
California are the
first to get hit in a public
safety power shut off.
These are communities that don't
have a lot of
resilience, but we're
able to use those school bus
fleets to help those
communities have a stable
grid
infrastructure.
Our promise to our
customers
is that they always have
the energy that they need to
drive
that they're gonna enjoy
the cost savings and from
the revenue generation
opportunities we bring
and that we always work within the
battery warranty limits.
This is one thing that
when you have a platform that's
constantly managing
vehicles and their batteries
that you can do, we work
with O A MS to make sure we
know where the safe zones
are for those batteries
and we keep them within those
limits. This
is really important especially
for a use case like school
buses. The
worst thing you can do to a battery
is top it up and leave
it in the sun for three months
on end. What
we do is we use those buses
while they're parked as
grid assets.
This gives them the exercise,
they need to remain
healthy through a hot
summer.
Thank you. Um
So we seek to be the
easy button for our customers
transitioning to electric
vehicles.
We've actually brought in a
inclusive turnkey
solution that
takes our customers
through the grant facilitation
phase, collaboration
with utilities
through charging station
procurement all the
way through the purchase and
removal of their
fleet as the EVs
come online.
This is important
especially in the school bus
segment. Our
customers, our school
districts, they know
about kids, they
want to transport them to and from
school safely.
But an electrification
journey for them is daunting
unless they have a stakeholder
that can come in on their
behalf and
adopt a fiduciary approach
towards them and help them through the
process. And that's
what NVI
does.
Thank you. Um
And this is a snapshot of
where we're uh deployed
um As of
today,
um As you
can see mostly on the
coasts, but we are
starting to have more and more
deployments in the
Central um
Midwest and in
the Southwest.
I'm happy to say that this
week we're actually
deploying um and,
and commissioning our
first deployment
in Las Cruces
and we hope to grow more
in New Mexico because
we, we know that New
Mexico has
some strong ambitions
in the electrification of transportation
sector.
NVI is the first mover
advantage in the vehicle to grid
space. We
have intellectual property
around this. It's
comprehensive
from all
um all
perspectives from the
vehicle side, from the charging
station side and from the
grid side,
we've been qualified by multiple
system operators worldwide
to irrigate vehicles into a
virtual power plant and
provide services to the grid by
directionally and get paid for
them. And we
have many years
of experience in
doing this. We're not just a
technology, we're a group of
people. Um
We're executing a process
successfully over and
over again and
bringing our technology
for our customers
and we have a huge amount of
data. Um This
is high frequency
data um
And it's very important
for us and an A I effort to go
along with it to learn
from this data.
Uh What we learn from
what our operations have been
yesterday is going to help
us operate better
for our customers
tomorrow.
So just to look at
our commercial deployments in
action,
this uh this
fleet um
was actually our first
commercial vehicle to grid
operation.
Um NVI started
commercially delivering its vehicle
to grid solutions in
2016
and has amassed over 400,000
hours of continuous
vehicle to good operations
with this fleet of light
duty vehicles based in
Copenhagen.
Since then, each
of these small vehicles has
earned 2000
to $5000 per
year, which
means the total revenue
generated has significantly
lowered the total cost
of ownership of the
fleet.
We amassed a, a tremendous
track record of
global commercial vehicle to grid
deployments and
we've, we did start with light
duty fleets
um in Denmark.
Um and the
US school bus
market,
um we've established
a a first mover advantage
for not only charge energy
management of the ve
vehicles but
also irrigated griddle
ev storage assets
under management. And
you can see snapshots here
of some of our deployments
worldwide.
Um Like I
said, uh the,
the vehicles
that, that are,
that are on the
bottom, right in Denmark.
Those are small,
um, small vehicles,
light duty fleets,
they've earned 2 to $5000
per car per year.
Um, and those batteries
are 24 to
36 kilowatt hour
batteries.
Um, but if you go
into
the, uh,
alcohol and torrent,
um, uh,
pictures you'll see
school buses. These
are vehicles that have
100 and 50 to
300
kilowatt hour batteries
in them and they have
potential earnings for grid
services
that that could be up
to $25,000
per bus per year. So it's a tremendous
opportunity
just to get a sense for the
power that vehicle to
grid brings. Um
the average US
home
um uses about 30
klo hours of energy per
day. Um
If you have an electric school
bus with 100 and
50 Klotho battery in
it, it can
actually power
30 homes for four
hours.
So we view electric school
buses as the ideal
use case for vehicle to
grid. It's
a uniquely North American
fleet. I
remember myself
riding on a school
bus um
as it turns out it's the
largest fleet in the United
States in
North America. And in fact, there's
about 600,000 school
buses. The
average age is about 13
years. So these are
old, they
are diesel
and they need to be replaced.
Um Right now,
manufacturers are replacing
them at about a 30
to 50,000 per annum.
Clip and when they
get replaced, they get replaced with
new technologies.
Electric being one
of one of the higher
growth um
in amongst those the different
types of
technologies.
So beginning in
2018, we
understood that the school bus
segment was gonna be important in
North America.
So we've been focused there for
many years. And
in uh 2023
we actually stood up a dedicated
K 12 business unit.
Um The idea
here, as I mentioned
before, we want to be the
trusted advisor for
school districts and getting them
through their electrification
journey. And we've
done so with over 100 school
districts and, and
over 500 charging
stations that are connected
to our platform,
we've been offering our
customers a, a
full turnkey
solution
um which goes
through uh
grant facilitation
project management,
chargers installation,
negotiating with utilities
and
financing
the benefits they reap
are vehicle readiness,
energy management and
battery life
optimization.
We need to make sure
that the the buses
are ready for
their routes. We
need to make sure that the infrastructure
works. We
need to make sure that we
can monitor the behavior of
those batteries
to make sure that that to ensure
that they are operating
safely and
reliably.
Thank you.
We do have extensive
experience in the school bus
segment. I have worked with many,
many school districts
and we're looking forward to
working to with
many of the school districts here
in New
Mexico.
I also wanted to give you an
example of how
these buses can help
the grid in, in,
in times of stress.
Um In
2022
we actually did this
with a pro with a program
called the Emergency Load Reduction
program in
California.
If you remember September
22
was a pretty hot
year. Um
In fact, the the
heatwave in California
stressed the grid so
much that it, it
caused demand records for
the grid over
52 megawatts of
demand. In fact,
and we were getting close
to not being able to meet that
demand and keep the grid
balanced.
This is where
the resources
that were distributed
came into
play
next
slide.
So we worked with our
customer um
Cajon Valley Union School
district. It's a middle
school that's
located in a disadvantaged
area about 15
miles to the east of
where the coast
is.
And we set up the next
slide, please.
We set up this
deployment
and the exciting thing about this
is that these are commercially available,
buses, commercially
available charging stations
and you have a commercially available
platform in NVI to
manage and scale it
all.
We used these buses
while they were parked
to export power back to the
grid during a time
of grid stress.
Here's a snapshot
of 10 events we did
during the hottest days
of August and
September.
Next
slide,
just these five buses
cumulatively discharged
just shy of a megawatt hour
with a measurable greenhouse
gas reduction in equivalent
houses serve metrics.
This helped the community,
it helped the grid
and it helped lower the total cost
of ownership of the
vehicles.
And we're extending this
concept into our
vehicle to grid hub
concept because
these, these
buses, these
vehicles when
they're all aggregated
can be a hub that
can be used to provide
services to the
grid.
I'm on slide
31.
Thank
you.
Yesterday.
We had a groundbreaking
ceremony in Fresno,
California
where we are
working on a project with
the Fresno Economic
Opportunities
Commission.
The Fresno EOC
has a mandate to eradicate
poverty
and
they,
they have
kitchens, they have
refrigeration,
they have
um a fleet of 50
vehicles
and uh they
help the community
stay fed
and they help
run programs to
help with the employment
and training of the
communities.
Um They wanted
to lower their res, their
lower their exposure to the
grid because of
the high cost and
also the fact
that they are
very susceptible
to public safety
power shutoffs, which they've
experienced before
when that happens,
they lose refrigeration
and they can lose all their
food.
So we're,
we're going to stand
up a
micro grid for
them using
vehicle to grid capable
vehicles, their
shuttles, the
buses,
uh We're gonna bring in
solar and
storage. And what
that does for them is
that provides them the
resilience they need.
It also lowers
their exposure from a cost
standpoint. So
over the long
run, their costs
go down
and it provides them with revenue
generation opportunities
from the vehicle to grid
piece.
It's a win, win,
win.
This project
is about a $60 million
project in total.
And, and it's
fable because of the cash
flows. When you take
our technology
and you apply it to this
infrastructure, it
enables it to throw
off cash flows
that otherwise wouldn't be able to throw
off. So that
makes from a finance
standpoint, it makes the waterfall
work for the,
for the uh for the
investors
and um our
reach and
vehicle to grid interest
continues to grow.
Um Yes,
here in New Mexico, we've been
talking to a lot of people,
um a lot of
schools,
the utilities
and the folks in government
because we heard
that that uh New
Mexico has ambitions
to move forward in its electrification
journey. But we're also
engaged in many other
states as well as
globally.
So my key takeaway is
for you
is that vehicle to grid
is a critical technology in the
energy transition.
You have to, you have
to understand that
as we're bringing in all these
new loads at the
edge of the distribution
grid
where the grid is, is
the most fragile.
You're gonna need to actually
integrate those vehicles
intelligently into the grid
and have them be a part of the
solution versus a part
of the problem.
And NVI is
here
to bring this forward. We
are the pioneer and we're
scaling our technology
worldwide.
We're also present
in New Mexico. Like I
said, we have our first
in-state deployment
being commissioned this
week and
we're looking forward to a growing
customer base
as we continue to meet with key
stakeholders,
Mr Chairman,
members of the
committee,
I have other slides,
but I wanted to leave it there
um and open it up to
questions.
>> OK. Thank
you.
Thank you, Mr
Smith.
So anyone
wishing to ask
questions,
representative?
>> Thank you Mr Chair and
and thank you very much
uh for the presentation.
So as I listen to
you and we talk about
um these
buses, one of the
things that's still very
prevalent in our community
is something called a Greyhound
bus and people are still using
that to go from place to place.
So how does your
concept of these
vehicle,
electric vehicle
buses fit
into a longer
transportation other
than through
schools,
>> Mr Chairman, um
mem members of the committee.
So the,
um, you're correct
to actually call out
the use case,
um and the differences in
the use cases.
So, um
the the the
school bus use case
is very, very
unique in that
most routes
are very short,
typically 60 to
100 miles
across the nation. I know
they're longer in some rural
areas. But typically
speaking, the school
buses are used only
2 to 4 hours
out of the day,
the transit buses, they
are longer
routes. And
so the for,
for them, um
the the the
technology may
not quite be
good for them at this
stage until
you start to see
more, more
uh kilowatt hours
per, per
volume in a
transit bus. So
what we're seeing
on transit
is especially if,
if they're higher, higher
use cases
is that they'll shift to other
technologies until
electric is, is
ready for them. But
at this stage, the
until that day
happens, um
it's not the best
match. Um
What, what you need is more
advancement, but it, but the good news
is advancements on the
way.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you for
that explanation
because as we're looking at
mass transportation in our
state and we
still haven't come to
a a great agreement on
that. Buses are still an
important part of it. So I'm glad
to hear that we are advancing
in that one area. So
thank you very much, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you
next up, we have Senator
Woods. >> Thank you
Mr Chair.
Um,
so I take
it you have to have an
agreement with
the utility
in order to put this
back on the
grid.
I'm assuming that's part
of the deal.
But the more
the deal I was wondering
about how much
more will your
charger cost
original purchase
price
than
uh comparable
charger that doesn't
do the back
and forth.
>> Uh uh Mr
chairman members
of the committee.
Um So
the the charger
costs are
beginning to actually
converge. So
you're not seeing a tremendous
amount of,
of uh price
difference, there is a price
difference at this stage. But as
we get into scale,
the charger costs are
going to converge.
Um The
um the idea
here is to lower
the total cost of ownership
and uh with the
sharing mechanism,
you can help finance
or lower the total cost of
ownership with for the
customer in other
ways by sharing those
grid services
and um uh
with respect to your first
comment. Yes,
the the
utilities are a
critical piece in
this. Um
Typically, what we're seeing
is we're seeing programs
from utilities, we're also
seeing uh tariffs,
we're also seeing other
other types
of, of power
purchase agreements
that can be done with
utilities. And
NVI has been working with
utilities for many years
and, and we're also
engaging with utilities here
in New Mexico.
>> So Mr Chair, I'm
assuming that this is
kind of like a
um
net metering
deal
so that,
but it looks like it would have
to be the only way
it would be profitable
is for the electricity to
come in
during an off peak
period and then go
back out during
a high peak period.
That's the only profitable
way that can happen, isn't
it? >> So that
is one
uh Mr chairman
members of the
committee.
Um That is one
way that it can
happen. Um There
are other types of grid
services that
can be provided
with, with the
technology. Um
Some of the services are
called balancing
services or frequency
regulation.
Um Some of the services
are are behind
the meter um
where you're lowering
demand charges.
So there's a myriad of
services that can be
provided. Um
uh Aside
from the net
metering um that
you described earlier.
OK. >> Thank you very
much for your presentation.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Anyone else with the
questions?
Um I have
a couple of questions uh page
uh
30
two.
This is Novi's
first new Mexico
electric school bus
deployment.
We was that in
um
where is
that
>> Mr Chairman, members
of the committee that's in Las
Cruces
>> on page and
nine.
Um
Just walk me through this
again, how this
works. So it
says here
uh
uh
the by power
capacity and sending energy
back. So
how does an
electric vehicle produce
electricity? What am I
missing? Maybe it's a
dumb question. I don't
understand
the process. Could you walk me through
that process real quick?
>> Uh Yes, Mr chairman,
members of the committee. So
the, the process
um that's described
on the right hand side
is um is
meant to
explain the,
the, the different
steps that can
occur um
during a, a session
um where a vehicle
comes in after
having been used
and you, you, you
would plug it into the
charging station,
the battery would charge
up to
a certain level, say
80%.
And then you can use the
latent power
that's in the
battery to provide grid
services by
either um uh
having the,
the, the battery
back feed to the grid
on demand.
Um Or you can save
costs behind the meter
many uh
customers.
Um If they're fleet
customers, they will
experience demand
charges because they're
using um
uh electricity
during um
times and they
want to reduce the peak.
So they're able to save
from the demand
charges
by exporting
from their fleet vehicles and
lowering that peak
demand at their
site. >> And so they're
selling that electricity
more for more than they paid
for it. Yes.
Ok.
All right.
And
uh
how extensive is your opera?
How many opera um
contracts do you have around the
country? Most of them are
in California, I assume,
>> right? And so
um
Mr chairman, members
of the committee, um if
you could go to slide
14,
um this is,
this is a,
a snapshot of our North
American charging
deployments. Um
We have also have
deployments in Europe
and we have deployments in
Japan as well.
>> Ok, thank you for that
answer.
Anyone. Uh,
lastminute call for any
questions or hearing
none. Thanks again for
being here. Thank you for your
presentation
and we'll move on next
to,
uh,
to, uh,
we're gonna skip
over, uh,
my good friend Mr
Gooder
to uh item
number six Travis
Hicks who's
associated with Richland Auto
Group.
And we also have with
us
the gentleman who
was
head of the New Mexico
Automobile Dealers
Association.
Mr Ortiz,
who is,
who has not left the room. He's
still here. Thank
you. So
you want to come up to the table
or?
Oh, ok.
Go ahead. Thank
you.
>> Uh Mr chairman member of the
committee. Uh Thank you so
much for giving
us uh and
by us, I mean, uh consumers
in New Mexico a seat at the table
today. Um I
it, it's hard to miss
uh the quantity of time
dedicated in this meeting
to um
ev and the
quantity of time uh
dedicated to this that is
related to consumers.
And so the consumers of New Mexico.
Thank you for letting me
come in uh and,
and represent them to some extent
today. Um That's
the title of the presentation. I don't
have a powerpoint
presentation because I can't
read them and
I assume that most everybody
else can't either.
Um But any
information that you would desire
from uh the, the body
of my presentation today uh
can be available to you by
email. I'm happy to pass on
any information that you think is
useful that comes on my
presentation. Let me give you
kind of a little
overview of who I
am and what
purpose I represent here
today. Um First
of all, I'm, I'm a car
dealer in Southeastern
New Mexico. Um
I put myself
through college selling
carss uh and
then continue to work in the industry
until I finally had an opportunity to,
to, to, to, to be
an owner of a car dealership.
And I gotta tell you that, uh
speaking from my personal experience
and speaking from the experience of the
82 people that I currently
employ, um It's
a great, uh it's a great
business and a great opportunity to,
to make a decent living for your
family. Um
um um in New
Mexico,
um I want
to dispel a myth
that is common in these
conversations. The,
the first that myth being
the notion that car dealers
don't like electric vehicles.
Um I've heard that so
many times over
the number of occasions I've had
to speak on this matter.
Um And I got to tell you
as a car dealer, I'm
really excited about evs
um the, the, the,
the gentleman
from the, from
the, that,
that represents the
automakers um
started his presentation
by saying electrica
electrification's EVs
are the future, right?
Um I'd amend uh
that amend that statement,
just a hair uh to
say that EV is the future
that we've decided upon.
OK? As a, as a
government in
America, OK? And as a
government in New Mexico,
OK? By adopting
cars to what we've
decided is that we're committing
wholeheartedly to
ev si will
say to you. And I have,
uh again, I have some
references that I can
provide to you if you
want. Um I'll give you
just a, a brief
overview of some
stuff that's in the media and
been in the media uh for
everybody's consumption that I
will just uh forward to you the
street in October of
23
titled a, an
article former for
Ford CEO has a blunt
warning for the electric vehicle
industry. Um I'll
paraphrase the
paragraph by saying
that um in
QQ
two in
2023
Ford lost an
average of $72,000
per electric vehicle that it
sold. Um,
uh, the model e
specifically the only
electric vehicle,
uh, the only electrical
electric vehicle that they had
in mass production at that time
lost an average of
$36,000 per
vehicle and 1.3
billion for the
actual, uh,
the actual, uh,
a line of cars
itself. Um,
Ford GM and Mercedes
and Fox Business News, October
23. Um,
the title of the article is
Ford GM Mercedes Come clean
on demand
Weakness. What you see
what you saw on the,
on in the report that I
was so glad to have gone
after the gentleman from uh
the Alliance for Automotive
Innovation because he provided a
lot of the backdrop for,
for some of what we're going to talk
about. Um
II, I want to say very
specifically that, that what
I'm trying to give you today is a
consumer's perspective. So
what we're gonna do is we're gonna walk
through the process that
a person a New Mexican
specifically II, I
am uh I do live here
in New Mexico. Um
Not, not all of our presenters do, but
I live here and I'm very familiar with our
consumers here in New
Mexico. And I'm
gonna present to you a
consumer's journey uh to
some degree between
needing transportation
uh and acquiring
and paying for transportation.
It's a, it's a, it's a process
that everybody goes through in a
different way. Uh But we're
gonna talk about uh New
Mexicans specifically
today. Um
The, the I think the
important uh thing to
come out of this is that or
to come out of my opening here is
that, is that uh
we're car salesmen?
OK. Uh We're,
we're not particularly politicians,
we're not particularly uh uh
uh managing
some specific agenda
outside of the agenda that we have
related to our customers.
OK. The 82 people who
work for me have a job
because customers, people,
consumers in New Mexico
have chosen to do business
with us. They've chosen that
over the alternatives. There's
plenty of alternatives to my dealership
specifically. Uh in
Rasel, New Mexico, there's a number of
car dealerships, they don't have to come to
mind, but there's a
lot of them that do come to mind and the
reason they come to mind uh is
a is a perceived value,
right? Is a perceived value.
Every decision that a consumer
makes is relative to a
perceived value. Ok?
And consumers currently are
not choosing electric
vehicles in enough
with enough uh uh
quantity to
justify the kind of investment.
And specifically the
mandates that have
been issued by our
state to
not to not to force
people to drive
evs because because
no one's trying to do that,
you can't do that,
ok? Uh But
to force car dealers
to buy evs because that's really
effectively what happens
with, with the adoption of the clean
cars too as
referenced in the graph
that you saw earlier by
model year 2027
which starts in 2026.
Uh, car dealers will
now accept, uh
and I say accept
that's, it's, it's the wrong way to put
it. We will be forced
to purchase
a purchase. Uh
because the manufacturers
don't give us the cars to sell.
We buy them from the manufacturer
from the minute that they come off
the, off of the line. Uh
long before they're even
delivered to our dealerships,
we buy them right.
The, the, the regulation
forces car dealers to buy those
cars for
which there currently isn't a
demand and
specifically for
which uh
in such quantities
that, that greatly outstrip
the demand and that also
reduce the availability
of the, of the ice vehicles
that they're using now, I
believe, uh be because
I'm easily convinced that
electrification could
be the future of
autom of transportation
and don't have any problem with that
as a car salesman, what I'm interested
in is what's interesting to my
consumers. If people were
buying evs at a, at an
extraordinary rate, guess
what, I'd have all over my lot.
Loads and loads of ev
si, it's my choice.
I get to buy them. The manufacturer
gives me access to a certain number
of them and I have the choice to buy them or
not. I am I,
I don't buy specifically
things that people don't demand.
Ok. There's no,
there's no economic value
to me to buy something that people
aren't consuming. Right.
So, the idea that we can go
from 3% I'm just
using his presentation numbers there.
I've got some different ones from a
different source that are a little
different, but I'm gonna use his, the
idea that we can go from 3%
ev, and by the, by
there's only a modest
uh modification to,
to clean cars too
that has anything to do with PBS.
So we're not even really talking about
plug in hybrids, which I think
are a smart transition
from internal
combustion to electric
vehicles. Having
said that the to go from
3% to
43%
in the next year and a
half is
ludicrous to say
to, I mean, at
the very least is ludicrous.
It won't happen and it won't
happen largely
because the consumers
don't demand them at that
level. You the
clean cars two mandates
that the manufacturer. He said when
he was asked the question,
um what happens when
you can't meet these guidelines? He
said we will meet these guidelines.
We're forced to, yes, they
will meet the guidelines. They
will send me out of every 100
vehicles. They sell me, send me
the and I I say send me,
sell me is the word out
of 100 vehicles that they will sell
me. 43 of
those have to be EVs as
of calendar 2026.
Ok. The next
time I order cars, let's just
say it's 100 at a time for the sake
of a conversation. Say
it's 100 at a time.
If per
current data, per
current data, three
of those 100 sold,
right. And all 57
of the others, the internal
combustion engine vehicles
sold and I go to
reorder if, if
I have to reorder 60
vehicles, then 30
of the reorders have to be evs
also. Right.
It's, it's a mandate to
move us out of the internal
combustion engine business. And
I don't care, I gotta
tell you if people want snowplows,
I'll, we'll, we'll sell snowplows.
That's the nature of being a
salesman, right?
If uh if the
ox cart comes back into
fashion, I'll have ox carts
on display at my dealership.
Ok? I don't have
a dog in the fight about
evs my dog
in the fight is, is
relative to consumers,
right? Consumers and the
net effect on consumers
that these regulations have.
Ok. So let's start at the beginning.
Who are we talking about what
we're talking about? An average New
Mexican who
by uh according
to a website
called Income
by zip code.com.
And I got something else from the
sense uh from the, from
the government census, but it was
old data. So I'm gonna use the
newest data that I have
to suggest that the average
household in New Mexico
makes $71,000.
OK. The last census
data says that the average uh
uh household in New
Mexico makes $52,000.
There's a significant difference between
those two numbers, but I'll
use a more current number
for the sake of conversation
and for the sake of making the point,
the, the, if the
average household makes
$71,000 in the state of
New Mexico, what that
means is that means that the
average household
can afford basically, and
I'm gonna, and I'll, I'll quantify
this statement but can
basically afford
a $71,000
vehicle, 1 71,000
vehicle or two, perhaps
$35,000
vehicles. And here's why
80
86% at my
dealership and over 90%
in the State of New Mexico of consumers
finance their vehicles.
Ok. They finance them because they don't
have $40,000
or $30,000
or 20,000 or 10,000
for that matter, uh, dollars to
put, uh, towards their car. So they
finance them, the,
the, the method that's used and
it's a, and it's a regulated term,
uh, it's a regulated method
but the methods that's used to
decide upon, uh, who
qualifies for what is
based on their income, right? You have a
certain amount of income, you have a certain amount
of expense, your ability
to borrow has everything to do
with that. A simple
way, not the perfect formula,
but a simple way to understand what people
can afford is that
if you have to finance your
transportation, you can
finance about as much as you earn.
Right? So, if an
individual in the
State of New Mexico for a household income,
average household income, 71,000
and an individual makes 35
5, then theoretically that
individual can afford
a vehicle that's worth about
35,000 $500.
Well, there aren't vehicles,
uh, EVs currently,
uh, uh, there, there was, there
has been one that I'm aware
of, uh, in the marketplace
in the last number of years. And by the buy,
I sell electric vehicles,
I have electric vehicles on
my lot right now and I'll
have as many as my consumers
demand. Ok. But
the average cost for comparably
equipped vehicles you saw on a slide
that the difference was five or
$6000. The things
that aren't calculated into that
are what they're asking for,
which is a
$2500
at home charger, so that
you can actually use the car,
right? They're, they're, they're not
considering that cost. Now, there's a
reduction in the cost of the
energy, right? It costs
less to buy
electricity than it costs to buy
gas. Ok. That, that is,
that is a fact, no
doubt about it. But
the, but the fact of the matter
is there's infrastructure costs that
come with it too. So you've
got a, a consumer
that goes out to find who makes 30
thou $35,500
that goes out to find a vehicle
that the bank will allow them to
buy. Ok. Number one
there, the, the, the selection
in the EV space is, is,
is, is miserable,
it's miserable at that price
point. There's virtually
nothing in the entire EV
space that, that an
average New Mexican qualifies
to buy anyway, do you know
who buys evs in the State of New Mexico?
And this data is pretty pre,
pretty consistent all
over the country. It's rich
people. It's people who have a lot
of money. Right. And, and,
and choose to buy an electric vehicle
as a second or a third
car. Right. Uh, the, the,
the data is
overwhelming. You know what, you know, the
reason they're expensive,
uh, regular people can't afford
to buy them, right? So
what, what California clean
cars looks to me like is a,
is a, is a rich person
who's who, who lives right
next to Lou Michelle Lujan Grisham
who says, hey, I went to
buy an EV and I couldn't find
one. Can you do something about that?
Well, let's make the dealers buy them
right at the cost
of the consumer in
New Mexico, at the cost of the consumer.
And here's why when you only
give me 43%
that's the first rule. It goes
all the way up to 82.
You heard the presentation
when you give me 43
evs and 57
internal combustion engine vehicles.
And then the next time when I go to replace
them, I have to acquire more evs
you have what is happening in
California with
STIs right
now, which is that if
you want an internal
combustion uh vehicle
from STIs,
then you have to
order it from the dealer
and wait and see when they
get it, the dealers are not
allowed to buy for stock
internal combustion engines.
This is the state that
developed the rules that we've adopted.
Right. So, if you're
a Chrysler dealer
and, uh, uh, in,
uh, or you're a consumer
in California who wants to buy
a Stel anti
vehicle that isn't. And
by the way, Stel Anis has
no vehicle ev
vehicles for consumption in the United
States. Right now, they have a number
of plug-in hybrids,
right? But uh if,
if you want anything other than a
plug-in hybrid from
a stances dealer, you, you
have to order it and hope and
wait. What does that do?
Well, uh it
forces the decision
that's made all across New Mexico
right now. Uh Because
uh you saw the slide again, I'm
using uh using his data,
you saw the STL that what is consumed
in New Mexico is
82%
trucks,
82%.
OK. So if
you're, you're asking for
in a state where 82%
of the people uh
uh demand
currently an internal
combustion engine
trucks specifically.
OK. Trucks. Specifically,
you, the suggestion that
these uh mandates have
is that somehow between
now and a year and a half later,
that number is going to significantly
change. I'm gonna suggest to
you actually, I'm gonna tell you
because we deal with the consumers
directly. People
desire light duty
trucks, not because they
hate the environment, not because
they, they, they want to poison
the air. They want to create health problems
for their Children. They do it because it's
what's required for their
job. Lots of New
Mexico is agricultural
and I gotta tell you, they just don't
have a product anywhere
near agriculture
yet that is sufficient
and, and, and,
and, and, and,
and inexpensive enough
to, to, to, to, to
operate farms,
ranches, construction
things that require
lots of heavy duty
work. Right. So that's why
New Mexico buys trucks at such
a, at such a high rate.
So if you're a New Mexican
that's looking for an internal combustion
engine car, say all you can
afford because you're the average New
Mexican is a $35,500
vehicle, right? That's all the bank
will let you buy right?
Then what you do, you go to the dealer
currently, you find out that that leaves
you with almost no selection in the EV
space currently.
Um I've heard, you know, II I
recognize that when
I was in college and didn't
have a cell phone, I never would have
imagined that I could look up
the answer to uh
to uh uh uh
Representative Allison's
uh question
uh in 14 seconds and find,
find out that the
voltage, the voltage
currently on EV batteries
is 400 sort
of the 12 volts that are being used
currently to, to start them,
right? Um So
I would have never imagined that technology
would advance to the level it did when I
was in college but it has,
do I believe that ev
technology is gonna grow and
increase in viability.
I do. There's, there's, there's
no way around it. That's the
nature of technology. It just
continues to get better and better and
better. The, the, the
the problem is that to
mandate the sale
of these cars to New Mexico
and I'm saying sale of them because
they're selling them to the dealers is
to put a massive burden
on the individual customers. So let's go
back to the customer. The
customer goes to look for a
truck. They're a farmer or they
work on a farm or they work
for an oil and gas company requires that
they have a pickup for
their, for their deal. Maybe the,
maybe the oil and gas
companies is even paying for it. They
come down to my dealership and because I
don't have the selection
of trucks that I would have under a different
circumstance, they end up going to
Texas or Arizona by their
car. I'm interested,
interested in what the
state of New Mexico believes the
value of sending
someone to Arizona or Texas
to buy a car. As III I
can't imagine what the answer
to that question is. Uh because
it doesn't curb the
use of
uh of emissions in the state of New
Mexico at all. What
I believe every time I come
to one of these presentations and I listen
to the to, to, to the
other side of this conversation.
What what I believe because,
because in my heart, this is what I believe
is that these are all well intentioned
people whose desire it is to
reduce emissions,
make our air cleaner, make our
water cleaner. The
problem is that without
compelling people to buy
evs you're making
no manifest
change in emissions,
right? People have
to buy them. You noticed on his presentation
they had four problems,
44 big
areas, right? The one
area that we spoke, almost nothing
about the consumers.
The consumers was one of the four
areas. You know, why consumers
have to consume them for
it to have the impact on the
environment that we're hoping, right?
Why wouldn't a consumer consume
them? Well, they, they gave you a
number of reasons.
Um a number of them
relative to uh to
the availability of charging and
there's no argument here.
That's why a lot of people don't want to
drive evs is they don't
know how when and where they're
gonna be able to charge them up. But
amongst that top 10
list of of
things uh amongst that
top 10 list of, of
reasons on his
report is number
two is the purchase
price and number two
is the purchase price.
Uh Number
five is the cost of
ownership. Excuse me, number
six is the cost of
uh ownership. Number six is
power outage grid
concerns. Number
seven or number uh number eight
is in inadequate
reliability, uh
lack of available capable
repair service centers,
inadequate performance and extreme
temperatures. Those are the top
10. Yeah, there were, there, there are
are four of those that
have specifically to do
with infrastructure
charging, network
work in the state of New Mexico. Those
are real things, no doubt
about it. But the others are
just as real and cost of ownership
was number two because
your average consumer can't buy
one. Um So
let's let's talk about the cost
to the average consumer
for an ev let's
talk beyond the cost of the
car even though the the
cars cost more by,
by the admission
of
you're looking at me
like maybe I have a, is
there something I I missed
or? Ok. Ok.
Ok. Ok, sir. I'm just making
sure making sure I'm not ignoring you. I
get rolling, you know, I'm
passionate about the issue.
Um The
uh uh uh so the cost of the consumer
is, is higher on an
average per, per vehicle
basis. What
else does the consumer do
for uh uh for
government? Well, the consumer,
the taxpayer is a
maybe a better way to put that
the taxpayer funds, all of
this. So everything we're talking
about the infrastructure,
the all of this stuff, it's all
funded by the consumers and
the consumers right now are demanding
these vehicles at a 3%
rate, right?
What's the difference between the
EPA standard and the
cars I standard that we've adopted
in the State of New Mexico? According
to the report that was shown up
on the, on the deal, the,
the, on his
presentation, the,
the, the standards by the
fed, the federal standards
are higher. Did you
notice that on the report,
the federal standard are higher
than the California Clean Cars
two that we adopted?
If, if our desire is to
be in the, the,
you know, to be the most
compliant and most
environment friendly
decision, we, we would
choose the, the,
the, the, the, the EPA
guidelines that are considerably
higher than the cars I guidelines.
Here's the thing, the difference
between the two of them is the EPA
guidelines. Uh
The EPA guidelines
don't have mandates
there. There's not a mandate to
sell electric vehicles,
to the, to the, to the car dealers
with the hope that people consume
them. What the EPA
mandate or, or what the EPA rules
do is it gives the
manufacturers a lot of
ways to arrive at an emission
standard if they can do it with
hydro, do it with hydrogen,
if they can do it with natural gas,
do it natural gas. If they can do it with
other ways, it forces
the manufacturers to find
and innovate into a circumstance
where they, where we have
reduced emissions standards.
If what we really care about is
reducing emissions standards,
why not go for, not only
the higher, the higher deal,
but one that doesn't have the
necessary necessary
deleterious effect on the
consumer. So the consumer
now is paying for all these
programs, the infrastructure
that you, that the state
of New Mexico may choose to put up
in the process is all
funded by taxpayers. Right.
There's a, there's a real cost
there. It's not, it's not just
funded by, by, by,
by oil and gas or oil and
gas revenues. It's funded
by customers. Everybody in this state
pays a state
income tax and the government is
run with that and revenues
it receives from all the businesses.
So the, the, the, the
notion that there's no cost
to going down this road
or a relief in cost,
going down this road for consumers
is just not
provable. There's, there's,
there's no data out
there to suggest that we're
helping consumers
in any form or fashion. What the
data suggests is that the
emissions from
a zero emissions vehicle
from a, from an ev
are less
damaging because they
zero emissions are
less damaging than the emissions that come out of
the, of the car. That is
very true. Having said
that there is data and I've
got reports
in here that I can, that I can
reference, there is data
to suggest that the
brake even, but the
brake even in terms of
emissions from the
production of an EV
vehicle. Right? And here's what I
mean, the mining of precious
metals, it takes
huge trucks,
it takes loads
and loads of effort and energy
and work to, to
mine precious metals,
most of which don't exist
in North America, right.
Mine precious metals. It,
it requires huge
big trucks that are all diesel
powered, right? All of them.
Now, that's the only way we can generate
over an extended period of time, the
kind of power that it takes to
mine for precious metals,
right? So, so,
so
uh uh
uh so the emissions it
costs to build an
EV are significant.
The suggestion out there is that
it's a 7 to 10
year payback in terms of
how long it takes for the EV
to compensate for the
emissions that it, that it was
generated in its production.
So it's, it's
not necessarily a
massive move forward in, in,
in in emissions
just to go to, to begin
with much less in a
circumstance where it requires
the customer to actually consume
the vehicles in order for it to work.
Your average consumer
can't afford one. Your
average consumer doesn't have the
luxury of a
$2500 charger
at their house. Your average
consumer or your average
consumer in the state of New Mexico
has broad distances
much broader. The mileage
difference between an average
consumer in California
and an average consumer in
New Mexico
is 11,000
miles a year in California
and 18,000 miles a year
in New Mexico. Those are the
that that
says very specifically
that the the the amount
of driving required to
operate in the state of New Mexico is
higher
uh cost to the
consumer. So
here's a cost to the consumer.
Uh representative Gallegos. I heard
you mention the story about your
daughter earlier and it was,
and it was striking to me because we see
this on a pretty regular
basis. There was a question asked
of the general gentleman from the
alliance uh about
what the rate of people giving
these back are. That was kind of the question
you asked. And here's what I think
you were asking. And this came out in
automotive news last week as an
article that was written in
automotive news who are, who are very
famously a pro
ev uh automotive
news. Um that, that,
that showed a recent
study that showed
of the people who were
consuming evs
last year, 40%
of them went back to
internal combustion engine vehicles.
There's a significant amount
of the marketplace that felt
like the electric vehicle didn't
satisfy their needs.
But to answer your question or to
address what I think you were saying, which
is what is the cost to
the consumer when they pay
$10,000 more for an
ev than they could have bought for an internal
combustion engine vehicle,
right? And then they go to trade
it in and there is no market
for a used ev,
what did they lose? What
did they lose? Well, they said, well,
here's our plan. Our plan is
we're gonna take the car back from them.
Ok. I, I didn't hear
the plan to pay them back for the
car, but I can assure you when
you trade in an internal combustion
engine vehicle, no matter what
age it is, it's worth something
and that's something is
payable to the consumer.
It's payable to the consumer
upon trade or
upgrade. Right? Currently,
you can uh use
your uh your uh your
smartphones and you can
pull up on a
autotrader or car
gurus and any of the number of the sites that
where they list lots and lots and lots
of used cars and you can find
four or $5000
evs uh that
have 5060
70,000 miles on.
These are evs that are
available for purchase
for 60 with
5060 70,000
miles on them for in the four or
$5000 range.
That's remarkably
inexpensive. Why
when those things need a
battery, that battery is gonna cost
thousands and thousands of
dollars to replace
the market for used
evs doesn't even
exist. So you can't
lease them. The residual values
aren't right to lease them
when you purchase them,
you might as well consider that the
best option you've got at some point in
time is just to give them
back to the manufacturer
and that's a cost to the consumer,
right? That's a cost to the consumer.
Um So,
uh you know, uh um
availability of is something
that's been talked about by everybody. I
won't spend a whole lot of
time on that. I think that
the, the
um I
think the questions we should be asking
are, are battery
prices uh really
going down is the cost of
electricity really going down?
I mean, it, it, you know, I
to use some very, very
simple uh econ
101 principles here
when you just talk about supply and
demand, if there's
less internal
combustion engine vehicles available
in the state of New Mexico. And we're doing
that with this regulation.
If there's less of them, then
the cost of the ones that exist
are going to be higher. It's, it's,
it's, it's the natural laws
of supply and demand as we learned
in economics. 101
right? Um
The what then will be your
alternative or your alternative would
be to buy a used
car. Well, guess what when
the supply of used cars is
reduced by virtue of the fact that
people are who are trading
trucks are going to Texas
to do it when the supply of
used cars go down. Uh
then the cost of used
cars go up from, from
January of 2020.
The average used car in a New Mexico
car dealer inventory
was $18,000
and every person
in the state of New Mexico by
bank standards can
afford to buy one of those
today. The average cost of
inventory in New Mexico car dealerships
used car inventory is
$35,000.
We've already taken
the the the bottom half
of the average and made
it almost impossible
for them to get a car already.
Right? That, that, that's with
supply chain shortages that
happen, not
imposed
supply chain shortages
like these rules
like these rules do.
You're imposing a supply
chain shortage of the vehicles
that people are demanding
currently by
forcing to
buy them, not by forcing customers
to buy them. The net result,
zero reduction in
emissions,
zero,
no reduction in emissions.
If you can't make them buy it,
you can't make them buy it. Right.
No reduction in
emissions and massive
changes to the cost
of what they could
otherwise because of a
lack of supply,
we are hurting
the, the the the people
we are supposedly
uh sworn to
protect. I don't
give a rip
whether you consider it a difficult
situation that I'm gonna
go through as a dealer, right?
To have to buy
47 out of 100
or 43 out of 100 vehicles.
Evs that I don't have
customers for. I don't expect
you to feel sorry for me as
an entrepreneur. I took
the risk. When I got into
business, I took the risk
that the government could make a law that
would make it difficult for me to,
for me to earn a living. That's
my problem. And it's a problem
that, that, that I'm willing to
face with or without the
help of the
government having said that
the government's purpose,
one of their specific purposes is
to protect the people who don't have
the capacity to protect
themselves. And what we're doing
with these mandates is we're forcing
down their throat,
huge expenses,
huge changes to their cost
of living without their
input without their,
the, you're right.
Uh can, can,
can, can the average ev
buyer go to Texas
to buy a truck because they want to buy a truck.
Yeah, they've got a lot of money.
That's the average ev buyer right
now. Ok. The, the, the,
the driving, the
cost of that technology down
is something that I think is probably
inevitable. But, but
why would we do anything
to force New Mexicans
into a specific
situation that would cost them more
money? Why would we do that? II,
I hope that
in 10 years we're
selling 100 percent. I think that'd
be really cool. The technology
is really neat. I mean, it's really
neat. The, the, the stuff that
the gentleman, uh, and I
apologize, I forgot the name of his
company that he was talking about. The
shared electricity. That's
cool. I mean, that those are the
technological, logical developments that are
gonna help EV, to
become a reality for everybody
and, and guess who's leading the
charge? New Mexico auto
dealers? You know why we've
invested on average
$250,000
at our stores to prepare
for EV si have DC
Fast chargers. My dealership
that I purchased at a cost of
over $100,000.
2 years ago, it took
me a year and a half to get them
because they were unavailable
and now they're still sitting in a box
in a garage because the,
the power company can't
get the electricity to my
lot to power these
DC fast chargers.
Ok. This is not
ready for prime time. And
I believe that any
substantive
expense on behalf of the
state in the direction
of mandating,
you know, that that is directed
by the mandates is
something that we will regret.
Gr greatly
regret over the course of time.
It, it puts a cost on the
people who can't afford a
cost. Right. It
doesn't do anything to the people
that make $500,000 a
year. They pick what they want
to buy anyway. Right.
What we're doing is we're
forcing these people
into a much more expensive
situation and, and, and it's easy
to say, well, they, they don't have to pay gas,
pay for gas anymore. But
how much gas does the difference
in price for the car?
And, and, and, and the, the lack
of value in resale
have to that consumer. How
much gas could it buy? I
can tell you we've done some of this
and, and, and it doesn't, it doesn't
catch up, right?
It, addition, you know, I'm not an
expert on the grid,
but I've read plenty
of things. I've got some of them with
me that suggest our grid
is so far from the
capacity, it's cool to be able
to share energy between a
car and a grid, but that energy
had to come from somewhere to begin
with. Right? I mean, that's a cool
thing but it had to come from somewhere
to begin with. Yes, sir.
>> Can you wrap it up? We get the impress.
We get the impression you're, you
know, you're not, you don't like these
cars, >> then
you missed the point. >> I missed the point
even though you said you liked them. You
give 100 reason why you don't
like them. So what's
your, you have to ask, what's your
request you
want us to do away with the mandate?
>> Well, I mean, that'd be
fantastic. I don't know that there's,
you know, I don't know what the, what the, what
the end solution for the mandate
is what I'd like to. I mean, I, I've
got two asks. Ok, that,
that, that's a great question. Got two
asks. One is that if
the State of New Mexico wants
to, is gonna
mandate the, the,
the, the, the my
purchase of these vehicles as a
dealership, then it
needs to do something to make it
to, to, to make it such
that New Mexicans can afford
them. And that's, uh, that, that's
in the term of huge subsidies.
The most recent thing that went
through, uh the uh the
legislature in New Mexico
gives me,
you know, asks me to
give a consumer at the
time of sale 2500 bucks
as an example, uh as
an incentive to purchase an electric
vehicle that, that
reduces my
profitability on that deal by
2500 bucks, right?
And then, and then I have to
reapply to the state of New Mexico
for a, not,
not a, not, not the
$2500 but
a tax credit, a tax
credit. The there is no
dealer in the state of New Mexico who's gonna
do that. Uh
The, and,
and therefore New
Mexico doesn't have an
incentive, uh an
incentive to buy. EVs
either that you
mentioned. The, the, the gentleman from
the alliance mentioned that the federal
standard doesn't do it either
because of the restrictions
on the cost of the
vehicles where the
components come from. Et
cetera, et cetera. We
effectively don't
have compared
to California who's way
further down the road in this
particular a avenue
way for. We do not
have something that incentivizes
people to purchase them. They
cost more to begin
with. Right. And
so the, the, so
that's,
>> so, have you
talked to General Motors
about this
problem and say, hey,
why are you spending
billions and billions of dollars
on this? When,
when I don't, I don't like this.
Have you talked to them? >> Yeah. Well,
I'll, I'll use their words
uh to, to, to answer that
question in automotive news
in October 2023
slowing demand for Evis has
prompted GM and Ford to post
postpone billions
of dollars in investments as the automaker
decide they don't yet need
additional production capacity.
GMC. It no longer will provide
ev production targets so
it can build to market demand while
Ford said it would delay about 12
billion in EV
spending GM. And Honda also
abandoned plans to cove a line of
affordable evs starting in
2027. So
so they speak for themselves when they
say whoa, we, we,
we can't justify this investment
based on a lack of demand.
>> So you, you've made your
point, we
understand where, where you're coming
from. I think
so.
Um
Does anyone have any
questions
and followed by Senator
G
and, and
>> yeah, I haven't, I haven't
uh priced
an EV
so give me the range
of price of
a uh
comparable
uh
that uh uh
uh a family
of four
with young kids would
like to buy. >> I'll use a
Chevrolet Blazer as an
example. Um
because it's a, it's a mid-sized
SUV that's got five
seatbelts, um
A Chevy Blazer with
comparable equipment.
Uh The, the, the
difference between the comparable
equipment on a regular Chevy
Blazer is about
40,000 versus an
EV at 50,000.
That's just one example. There's
a
number,
>> ok. That's
kind of what I just want to know, sir.
Thank you. >> Thank
you. And
next up we have Senator
Gal >> Mr
Chair. Thank you. And, and I
apologize, I asked to move you
up because I have to leave
here shortly, but I
appreciate the the
information. So and
I like that you look back at my
daughter's um
less than honest
trading. Uh
But I have a question for you.
So just thinking through
me if
I were to look at a
uh an EV right
now, let's say it
had a, what's the average,
you said um
price $10,000?
So if,
if I, if that car
doesn't sell
until the next calendar
year, it has
less value. Is that not right?
>> Every day that it doesn't sell, it
has less value. >> So that
when I buy it in 2025
Lu 2024 model
now, but I buy it in
2025 and
you have to give me a discount
to buy that thing.
Do you take the hit or does the
manufacturer take? Oh, >> we
take the hit, the manufacturers. Uh
once we buy the vehicle from
them, outside of incentives that they may
provide to help us sell them.
Uh There's, there's, there's
the, the, they don't ever take
them back, put it that way, they don't ever
take them back. >> See, to me
that's critical because now
we're taking a New Mexico
business that's being
forced to do
something beyond their control
and the manufacturers not making
up the difference and, and
that's what I was want to clarify
because I can see
if I'm gonna buy one.
I'm gonna buy a, a
later model
at your expense
just because that's
better deal for me going
back to my daughter trading hers
off without
telling the truth.
Reality is you don't want
to have to deal with it at
that cost.
And so I just
wanted to, to
look at that because I could see
me trying to buy
a next, uh, last
year's model in order
to save and I just wondered if
you have to eat it
all that, that, that's
hard for me to understand why I
would do that to the
Mexican
company
because it's beyond your control
and somewhat beyond
our control because now it's a mandate.
>> Yes, sir. Chairman and representatives,
the, the, the
that's hard for us to understand
also and, and, and, and
candidly, it's millions of dollars
worth of capital that is frozen,
uh, in, in, that's in our
control. So of course,
I have an issue about the mandates
for to, to, to be
specific, uh, uh Mr Chairman
to your comment. I
own an ev personally.
Ok. I don't hate
ev si actually
love the technology. I think it's
fantastic but to
mandate that 43%
of the, of, of every
car sold to me by the manu
facture has to be an
ev is to
ignore, uh what the
net effect of that the law
of unintended consequences as it
were, I'll buy
as many as people will buy
for me. I, that, that's
the nature of business. I, you know,
I don't, I, I don't have
any problem selling an EV I
sell them now. I consume
them personally. I, I'm
not, I'm not opposed in any form
or fashion to
EVs it's
the mandate.
>> Um
Thank you for that. Does anyone else
have a question?
Um, Senator
H, I mean representative,
I'll be >> a senator for
today.
So uh just for thank
you Mr Chair, but just for
clarification, I just
want to make sure I understand
the combustible engine
cars that you now
sell. You don't
have to pay for them in advance
the, the these various
deal, um
manufacturers give
those to you to sell and then
you pay for them after they're sold.
Uh >> uh Mr Chairman
and Representatives very
exact opposite of
what you've said. We
purchase them immediately
upon their production,
right? We purchase
them. I mean, some of us do
it with cash, some of us do it with
financing, but we
purchase them from the manufacturers.
The manufacturers in the current
arrangement are off
the hook for those cars
the minute that we buy them right
now, what they do quite often is put
rebates and incentives. You've seen
0% advertised
or $5000 discount
or whatever the they'll put up
extra money to help us move
them if they're not moving,
if they're not moving, we don't buy
more. Right. You know,
if we don't, if they're not moving,
we don't buy more in this
circumstance. That, that,
that kind of perfect
economic model where we
buy what's being bought from
us is thrown out of
kilter by the
requirement that they send us
40 that they sell us
43 out of every
100 vehicles
starting and model year
2027 as
electric
vehicles.
So I hope I an very, we
buy them, they don't give them to
us, we buy them. >> No, thank
you very much. I just needed
that clarification and
just for further clarification
for me and the people who are listening
on the web with
respect to that, uh,
43%. Is
that a federal mandate
or a state mandate? That's the
>> state, that's the newly adopted
clean cars, California
clean cars too, uh,
that the EIB has put
into place in New Mexico
that requires 43%
of everything that they sell
us. Uh,
be
an EV
in, in, in really a
year and a half
from now with
3% currently being
consumed.
>> Ok. Thank, thank
you, Mr Chair
>> representative.
So, uh,
do you strongly encourage your
salesmen to push
evs? >> Yes, sir. As a
matter of fact, as an example,
um we had an
ev that had been sitting on
our lot for a long, long time.
Uh And rather
because, because most people just don't
know a lot about them and we're, we're in rural
New Mexico. So, you know,
everyone's real scared. Right? They're
real scared. I'm not scared. Ok,
I also can afford to have a third
car. Right. Uh, but,
but, uh,
uh, but people are
scared of them. They just don't know, it's just
like he said, you know, they're, they're worried
about getting on a drive and not being able
to charge it. They've all heard the horror
stories and whatever else.
The, the, the, So what
we did is we, we have
loaner a loaner fleet,
right? So if your car comes in
for service and it's gonna take three or four
days to get the parts and you're
stranded, we loan you a car,
right? So what we did
is we put a couple of these evs
in our loaner fleet to,
to, to educate people
about using them and to educate
us also, right? Because it's, it's
pretty new technology for my
salesmen and for my staff
also. So,
uh uh
so we've done that
and what we found because it's just,
it's an interesting case study for
us is that people who
come in say
no, no, I,
I, you know, that's an
ev can I, can I borrow something else?
And again, the reason is
the reason is lack of experience.
So II, I agree with
that. I think, you know, II I
have, I started with
a Pev and, you know, personally
started renting a, I rented a
Pea have and I thought you know, this isn't that
bad. And I, so I tried an
EV and I like them but, but
people just don't know
about them, right? And
mandating me to
stalk them uh
when they're not consuming
them, a high rate is to freeze
a lot of capital and force
a bunch of business out of New
Mexico in addition to the
extra cost to the consumer
that comes with that
necessary change
in the equilibrium on the
supply and demand model. Does
that make
sense?
>> So every
day I get this uh
newsletter from
Bloomberg
on my email
specifically on the auto
industry and I
talking lately about the
China
producing a
$12,000
electric vehicle with the car magazines
that says high quality, but
we got 100%
tariff on
cars coming in the United States.
So they're obviously
discouraged. So now
they're gonna build a plan in
Mexico to get around
that tariff.
So when Americans find out
they can buy
a high quality
electric vehicle for
$12,000 they're going to
demand that from
the the automobile
industries. And I don't think that
they that if
the Chinese can do it, certainly
we can do it. It's
gonna be so they're gonna
become very affordable in the next few
years,
>> Mr Chairman. That
is not what the manufacturers telling
us. Ok? I I'm not
saying that I, I've read all the
same things that you have that,
that Chinese are developing
a very, very inexpensive
to consume uh
electric vehicle. And,
and I think if they produce a $12,000
car that's run on
manure that people would buy
it. I, you know, I, I, because
price is such an important
factor for so many
people. The problem currently
is that the main are the American
manufacturers or people
manufacturing in the United States
don't have the, the,
the, they can't, uh,
you, you know, they're being forced
to use American
uh minerals in order to qualify
consumers for and we don't have
the minerals or we're not mining the
minerals in the United States,
you know, so the, the
reality that, that China can
do it is not something that encourages
me on the, on the
EV
>> the 24,000,
obviously, that's
competitive, very >> consumable.
And if we had $24,000 evs
right now, we'd be selling them in a much
larger volume. There's no doubt.
I don't think that day is too far,
too far away, may
not be by
2027.
But,
um,
it may not be that far
off. Anyone else
have any
questions
and tearing. No,
thank you for your,
thank you. I appreciate you giving me the
time.
I can see why,
uh,
you would make a good
car salesman.
That's 100%.
Incidentally, I sold cars
one summer when I was in
college
and,
uh,
the salesman knew that
I was only gonna be there for the summer.
So they, they, they
didn't like me because they knew every
car, every
car that I sold be one
less than,
but at 21 years old, I
got to drive a brand new. They gave
me a brand new car. That was a pretty big
deal. So that was a big deal
on it. Thank you for being,
thank you, sir. I appreciate
you.
So next up, we have,
uh
Charles Gooder
who uh
gonna talk to
us
about reducing
costs
by through the purchasing
and use of electric school
buses.
And uh
Mr Good Maker is
a board member
of the New
Mexico
um
DC
Action
Fund.
Oh, it says vote. What is that?
Voters conser,
what is a
VC?
>> It, it's a 501
C four organization
that is supports
the goals of New Mexico
Voices for Children in the five
OC three
organization.
>> I know that.
Well, thank you for being here and
go ahead. >> Thank
you, Mr
Chair.
>> Wow. Uh
>> Sorry. Uh I
will try to be optimistic
and uh not burn
you with doom and
gloom. Um Because
frankly, this is easy
with this subject.
Um I'm also here
on behalf of uh healthy
climate, New Mexico, which
is a new
organization about two years old,
that's medical and health
professionals that are also
supporting this effort.
Um And you'll
hear later uh some
about the health impacts
on Children. Although for
this committee, I uh
focus more on the
different issues, but
that's a very important reason why
health professionals are in support
of this. Um
So
why electric school buses?
So across America
electric buses are now an option
for school districts. They
bring a lot of benefits. Of
course, the health benefits for
students and staff are
enormous. They're vastly
under known so
far. Um
And, and frankly, I think it's
shocking if you
um you know, the
reality is that every
single day, every student that's
on a, on a diesel school bus
is breathing in four times.
The particulate matter
as a person as
the same student would be if
they were riding in a, in a regular
automobile,
even an ice
or internal combustion engine
automobile.
Um,
and, and there are very serious
health consequences. I'll talk about
that more. But of
course, once you also have
them as with
electric vehicles,
all electric vehicles,
electric school buses are
going to save large
amounts of money on the
fuel costs
and on uh maintenance
expenses as well.
I'll get into more detail on
that. Um And
finally, of course, they reduce
the greenhouse gasses that are
going to benefit all of
us.
Um
Excuse
me,
next slide. Thank you.
So, practical
realities of this
bill.
There's a $5 billion
federal program
called this Clean School
Bus program that
is helping districts across the
country fund their
purchase of electric school
buses. But
and this is a big, a
big one.
It that program
fails to provide
completely sufficient funds
to actually
buy both the bus and
the charging infrastructure.
So there's a gap in funding
that's left
there. This
is a problem that um
um you know, every single
district that has received the
federal grants in New Mexico and I'll
talk about those which have,
have that gap.
Uh What we're asking
for is um a
bill that
will be reintroduced
this year. It was introduced last year
was not German for this short
session, but HB
75
HB 75
addresses this gap, it
has some language in it so
that so that the gap
can be addressed.
Um On top of that,
uh you know,
a difficulty that a lot
of districts have is the fact
that this is an entirely new
technology,
you know, so to speak to
put into their wheelhouse.
Um You
know, a lot of the problems
that people hear about
with electric vehicles,
uh people
ascribe a lot of those same
problems to electric school
buses. Uh
but, and of
course, managing a transition
to any technology, whether you
embrace it or not has
its difficulties,
but especially when school
employees are all
already overworked.
I don't know, a single school
employee, including everybody in
transportation units that
doesn't have too much on
their plate and struggles to get,
get through the day.
So add
having to deal with diesel and
electric. There's a, that's a
disincentive for some
district space
and choose not to go down
that route. So,
um I will tell you
by the way that, you
know, mileage of course, is a concern
or distance. Uh
90% of New
Mexico's bus
routes,
90% of them are
70 miles or
under
the range
of the electric school buses that
are now being sold
is up to 100 and
20 miles
on a single
charge. That doesn't
count what they can
also do. Of course, because they're not
running all day long, you
know, they bring the kids in the morning,
they go back to the
bus yard, they can
recharge. So,
um I'll talk about
one
uh example of a
district trying to
increase the number of miles
they're getting out of their electric school
bus because
each mile
driven means more
savings, which
I would also say frankly that
the prior presenter
who talked about the difference between
11,000 miles driven
by the average California
driver and 18,000
miles here. That means that
new Mexicans who are driving
electric vehicles
are saving that much more
money every year on their
maintenance and fuel
costs. But back
to buses.
Um hb
275 the bill,
it has two major
parts
to uh that are
sort of process oriented if
you will. The current
statute now
around school bus replacement
only speaks to
diesel buses.
The word diesel is,
is in the statute.
So that's an issue that
has to be addressed.
Uh
And by doing
that, it would allow
districts to use the same
process for
getting the money
for that gap. There's
two more years on the federal
program. So
if we pass this bill, this
next session, we'll have two more
years of where
school districts could get the
federal money to
pay for most of the bus,
small amount of gap
money and the gap money
by the way is much less
than if the district was
replacing the diesel with a
new diesel, new
diesels cost around 100 and
20,000. The
gaps for the
six districts so far that I've
heard from that have
received some buses from
this federal program.
Their gap money that
they need is 20 to 50,000
or so per bus. So a
lot less, I mean, right
there in the capital outlay, the state
will be saving money by
allowing the districts to
choose an electric school
bus. Um
So clear while
saying, choose there's
no mandate in this at
all, what
we're trying to do is really
level the uh
the path so to speak
for districts that might choose to
do this. Um
There are two components of
the bill as it was
written last year that may
not make it through to
to to next year.
Um And those are both
appropriations components.
One of them
excuse me
uh is to
was to provide some money
so that the Public Education
Department Transportation Unit
can increase their capacity
to to help
districts with that transition
with the difficulties of
uh absorbing, so to speak
a new technology and dealing with
it. Uh
The other, the other part
of the bill that was in
appropriation asked
for money to New
Mexico State University.
Electrical Engineering folks
to do it, infrastructure,
study of different
school districts
so that school districts
could see what their
cost might be for
and, and the physical
issues involved and
possibly bringing in a charger
or two or
four.
Do they need a transformer?
You know these issues around
bringing the conduits, the
electricity to the bus
yard? Um
So um and
I'll speak to why
we may not have that
in next year. But
um I will say also
that another major component
of the bill that we believe will
remain in it is
uh deals with the vehicle
to grid issue
that I'm
so so
happy that
NVI
the
um provider
of electric grid
vehicle to grid infrastructure
was on earlier and spoke
a great deal about school
districts. Um
And so we're, we'll
be working with them on this
bill. But as
that shows, um
es electric school buses
cannot just save money for
districts, but it can actually
be a source of income for
school districts.
Um So
the five New Mexico
districts, oops,
it's gone
um that
uh uh have gone
electric. I don't
know we can get that slide. I
think it's
slide.
Yeah. Thank you. Um
uh Sorry.
Um
This is
sorry, I might print out. I didn't
have the page numbers.
Sorry, I printed
out just the notes. So
I think it's
would be four
or so.
55.
OK. Four. All
right. Thank you.
Um
So there were five districts
that did get
electric school buses through the
EPA program.
Um Plus there was
Santa Fe that
Santa Fe did not
get money through the
electric. Sorry, the
EPA School Clean
Clean School
Bus program, Santa
Fe received money
early on
earlier years
through the VW
settlement
funds. Um
And now Albuquerque
public schools, I
need to update this map to
add Albuquerque because this
last year Albuquerque schools
actually received funding for 20
school buses from
the EPA program.
Um OK.
Next slide. So
um the
Les C
Legislative Education study
committee is, has
reviewed uh the
issues involved and they're
recommending that funding
be available for electric school buses
for the districts that choose.
Um
And
um next slide please.
New Mexico you all
in the legislature last year
did take an important
step forward. I want to
thank you for that. That
step forward was
part of the capital outlay. Bill
SB 275
where 1.5
million was provided to
plan design
and construct infrastructure
for fueling and charging stations
for alternatively fueled
school buses statewide.
Uh I understand from the PE
D they just provided me an
update that within
the next few days, they're gonna be
sending out the applications to
districts who would like to
receive some of that money.
Um And
uh so there's no
report, so to
speak yet on,
on how well that's going.
But there will
be um
the next slide, please. Thank
you. So this is a slide
from the PE D
itself that
explains the current
uh they put it in terms of a flow
chart, the process
that
currently exists for school
districts. So we
have a 12 year
lifetime by
statute on school
buses. At the end of
12 years, districts
start getting bids
from bus
providers. They
present the bid to the
bed, do the
fairly minimal
paperwork because this is a
proforma process. It's
not, you know,
like it's just
checking the checks, the
boxes, so to speak.
Um and then
they, they get the money.
Um you know, they have
to, they have to provide
the evidence of that, they're,
for instance, getting rid of the old
school bus one way or another.
Um So
what our bill
does is
to
allow this same
process, the exact same
process to be used for
districts seeking that
gap money when
they're using the federal
funding for the, for the primary
bulk of the cost of an
electric school bus
that doesn't exist right
now. Some school
districts have
funded, their gap
have received some special
appropriations from the pe
D. Um
They had to go through another
process to do
that. There's
I see no reason why they should
have to go through that in extra
process. Um
Las Cruces, school districts
initially um
actually paid the
difference out of their own capital
school outlays that they raised
locally.
Um Other
states I will say
um are
many other states, I think
it's seven now um
have are
requiring
100%
turnover. So
as the buses are being
replaced in
Connecticut in
Maryland, in
Virginia, in
Maine, New York,
Washington and
California,
they are being replaced with electric
school buses
currently. So
that by 2035
or some of these states, by
2040
100% of their school
buses will be electric.
This is also a factor
in driving down the prices
that will soon be
starting every
economist. Um
you know, again, economics,
one on one higher
demand, uh
the prices should go
down right now. There
are 3500
electric school buses on the road
in the United States. It's a small
percentage. Now, obviously
with these mandates and other
states like Colorado,
they didn't mandate it, but they put
$60 million
or $65 million
straight towards the purchase of
electric school buses.
Our bill again
is really, it
doesn't ask for that.
Our bill just ask for these
little fixes, so to speak
so that the schools can have a level
playing field when they choose to go
electric.
That being said, I'm
hearing from several legislators
who are saying, well, why don't
we, why don't
we create a fund
and start replacing our
diesels with electrics
that may or may not be brought
forward. The legislature may have
to consider that, of course.
Um But I will
note that, you know, the governor's
mandate or the governor
did issue an executive
order for the state
fleet of vehicles
to turn over
100% by
2035.
I don't see a reason why
we don't
do the same for school district
buses.
Um Of course,
money is a big factor,
but Senator Munoz is
quick to remind the
state that the
state is rich now,
we don't, we have so many
extra billions of dollars
and now would be a great
time to
establish a fund.
Use it for this.
The state will then savings
future budgets.
School district transportation
budgets can be lower
because
the savings from maintenance
and fuel each
school bus
saves on average,
they say nationally between eight
and $12,000 a
year on fuel and
maintenance.
Um,
Santa Fe Schools
has, who has been
running a school bus for
a year and a half now and
is gonna have, they're gonna have a
total of eight in their fleet
very soon.
Um,
they're going to experiment
with trying to stretch
out how many miles they can
get out of the buses in a day
by running them on their longest
routes again
by
starting them the beginning of the
day fully charged
during the morning route, coming back
charging again so that
they can get more than 100 and
20 miles out of the bus
in the day. They'll probably
that they're hoping to get great
deal more and possibly
get a savings for the
state of up to
$15,000
a year. And again,
to be clear, the state
does provide the transportation
funding for the maintenance
and fuel for the
buses. So
that's, that's can be a
great investment.
Uh Should the state decide
to go that way?
Um
Yeah, again, sorry,
I already talked about the next
but uh
slide.
Um
by the way, last
year, we did have several
representatives,
legislators and others
guests come
by the Santa Fe
Schoolyard to
see the school
buses,
diesel and electric side by
side. Uh
When they, the driver
started the diesel,
we had to yell at each other
to talk.
The driver started the
electric, he had to
tell us that it had been turned
on because like
electric vehicles, there's no
noise.
What's an impact on
the students. Um,
is enormous. The
student behavior
um
uh increases
tremendously because
everything they're saying can be heard
by the driver.
Uh, and they don't have to
yell at each other. So they don't get
on the bus and start yelling at each
other. You know, especially
kids, like trying to maybe do
some homework on their way home.
It'll be quiet for them.
Um All
right. So I mentioned the
health issues earlier.
Uh,
there's lots of evidence
that
as I said earlier, the
4.4 times
more particulate
matter for students riding in
a bus than in
a vehicle riding along
right beside them.
Um What does that
mean potentially for their
health? Well, uh,
cancers are
linked, uh,
cognitive
development impacts have
been documented
through academic studies.
The most common impact
is asthma kids
who had asthma before they
got on the bus
makes it worse. Lots
more kids get
asthma a
leading cause
of
absenteeism in the public
schools,
asthma.
We can make an impact on
absenteeism in the schools
too.
Uh I already talked
about academic performance
increasing with cleaner
buses there, a study
that now that study,
it wasn't about E SBS
electric school buses. This
was done before they became
popular, but it looked
at older diesel, they
were so called dirty diesel
and cleaner diesel
and they found
a very big
increase um,
in, in the uh, actually,
sorry, I don't have it there on the
slide but what they found
specifically was the,
because the attendance
increased,
um, and test scores
also increased
in because their entire districts
there had old diesel buses
versus entire districts that
had cleaners, diesel
buses. And that was a nationwide
study done with nationwide
data. So,
um, uh,
very sound
study. Um,
again, this cost
savings, you know, even if
it's $8000 a year,
the low end of the cost savings over
12 years, that's almost
$100,000 saved
just on maintenance and
fuel. That
can help a lot with
the uh make up
for the initial
cost.
Um,
the vehicle to grid issue,
the resource for disasters
and, and
emergencies.
Um Well, you
heard earlier from the new V
folks that they are doing
this all over the country, they
had much more information
than, than I have
about this. But
what I do know that,
uh is that,
um, some places,
um, actually, I think he
also mentioned the Coon
Valley school
district in California,
uh where they have seven
electric buses in their fleet
uh to move around 1000
students. They actually
have integrated or
the, with the utility,
they have a buyback
agreement and,
and it's integrated into the
utilities plan
for dealing with the peak
power demand
during the summer. The buses
aren't running at all. So they
download the energy
at two and three in the morning when it's
cheap. They sell it back
to the utility
in the afternoon and evening
when the demand is highest
and the school
district has an
extra income
source.
Um You heard from him earlier?
I believe that the the impact
on the batteries is, is minimal
so that it doesn't really hurt
them. Um Are
these buses good for New
Mexico?
Um They're
not 100%
for New Mex every New Mexico
bus route earlier.
I mentioned 70
miles or so. Is
the uh
extended range
of 90% of the school
buses. Uh school bus routes
in New Mexico,
100% of that
90% these school buses
can work.
There are of course
technological advancements
happening. So maybe in the future,
we'll get more range out of them. But
just speaking further here,
now these can work
in 90% of the school
routes. Uh
cold,
cold weather, heat,
minimal impact.
Um The battery
range does decrease
um about 80%.
They say when it's when it's
freezing but school
districts in very
cold places. And the
example West Grand school
district in northern, in northern
Colorado, up in the mountains,
they love their buses.
Uh The buses are
running in rural Alaska
and with, with high
um
high reviews.
Uh again, the drivers love
the buses
because
the students are so
quiet and there's less
distractions. They also
don't have to change gears.
I mean, there's a lot of reasons why
the the drivers prefer
them, the schools that have
them, the
drivers like
it's sort of a competitive thing who
can get that route.
Um
And again,
um I
loved that the earlier
spoke speak
speaker also
used the term win, win,
win. He
was talking about vehicle to grid
um
here, vehicle to
grid part of that picture.
But buses will
provide
cleaner healthier buses for the
students rides
for the students. A path for
future state transportation
dec decreases in the
budget.
And um
why not, why don't
we allow school districts
to take
advantage of this federal program that's
paying for most of them
and uh move
forward and that's
the end of my presentation. I want to thank
you all very much, Mr
Chairman, members of the
committee.
>> Go ahead,
Mr Chair
Charles. What is
the cost
of the EV bus
compared to
a regular diesel
bus
in
the
>> sorry, excellent question,
Senator We Mr
Chair.
They are much more
expensive. They range
404 120,000
for the larger buses
uh while diesel buses
are around 100 and 20,000.
So there's a substantial
difference um
again, making up the
100,000 or so over
the lifetime back.
But again, we're
in our bill hb
75 we're simply
proposing take advantage of
the federal funds. So
it's actually quite a good
return for
the state if
we did
this and more districts took
advantage in the next two years.
So, >> so, so I
unders what you're saying
is the federal
funds will
fund the
420,000.
>> Well, I, I've been saying that
the federal funds, they
come close to that.
Well, four and you
420,000 plus
the chargers or another
10 to 30,000
depending on the charger.
So, so that's
where the gap of 20 to
50,000 or so per
bus exists that we're
hoping to make
it easy for the districts
to, to get
instead of having to ask the
state for 100 and 20,000.
So the state in that scenario
is saving anywhere from 90
to $70,000
per
bus.
>> Ok. I don't quite
have the math, but that's
all right. You
did say a charger could
cost up to
what
amount
>> I'm not an expert on that.
Um
And I gave you a high end
beca Yeah, and I know,
sorry, last year, when
I last time I read
specifically on that question,
there were 10 to 20,000
or so. So I gave you a high
estimate of potentially
30
>> the next time you
present and,
and I'm sure you'll present again
to me.
I would like to
know
the, the exact
difference in the purchase
price of the
two,
the the
the, you
know, for a rural
district. What
will a charger
cost?
Uh will we have to have
more than one per
bus.
Uh Will it be
one charger, one
bus?
Um
And what the
federal monies
would pay
and what it would cost the
state if we're
going to replace a bus
and it would cost 100
and 20,000
to replace a
bus.
What will it cost the state
to replace that bus
with including
the federal money?
Yeah, just a price
comparison there.
But I would appreciate
that. Thank you
very much, >> sir. Thank you,
Senator.
>> Thank you, Senator
Representative. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair
and uh Mr
Gummer. My question
to you is you talked
about this process that
pe D is
requiring some schools
to go through to get this
money for their school
buses.
Can you describe this
process and
maybe we could tell us and
tell us how you think the legislature
could help circumvent
this process that's slowing the
process. >> Well,
sure,
there was that
slide.
Yeah. Thank you, Aaron.
She's on top of it.
Uh
So
this is the process that
currently exists
for
diesel buses where
you're just getting the full
payment provided by the
state.
Um So,
you know, it's
shown as six specific
steps, but of
course, there within each
little square, there's some
specifics
also.
Um So
what the
districts have that
have received the
federal money
that found that they had a
gap.
They, they can't
use the same
process. They have
to apply for supplemental
funding that the
PE D has
some supplemental
funding for
transportation costs.
Um So
they have to go through
and do an extra
application.
So our bill
HP 75 has
the wording within it
that says
that they will also
process electric
school bus funding
requests in the same
manner.
>> All right. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr Chair. Thank you, Mr Good
Bacher. And also with
respect to the school
buses. The
other, the
other uh testimony
that we heard today is that electric
cars tend to be
heavier than uh
gas cars.
So does it take
a special
training to be able to
drive a school
bus? I would anticipate that it
would be even heavier
and have there been more
accidents because
a school bus is
heavier than a
combustible engine
bus? Can you comment
on that? Yes, >> thank you,
Representative
Herndon Mr Chair.
I
have seen no
reports at all
about additional problems
from the weight of the
electric school buses.
Um The batteries themselves
are of course very dense as
you note, but you're also
replacing
some pretty heavy things,
the engine, the transmission,
um the
uh you know, the all,
all of those
parts that aren't
included in an electric
vehicle, so
the weight is not substantially
more.
>> And so there's no special training,
Mr Chair, Mr Guzman.
>> Sorry. Yeah, the
training of the drivers,
it's relatively easy.
There is a special training
because they do behave differently.
You know, there's,
there's, there's like there's no
gears, you know,
they have to get used to the quiet.
A
few other things like that,
you know, like they, they
also, uh,
you know, because they're
quiet, by the way, they're
adding little sound
makers on them just like the
electric cars and so
on to make sure that
there aren't any accidents because someone
didn't hear a bus
coming.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and finally,
Mr Gooder with
respect to the school
districts within New Mexico.
How many of them have
the EV
stations for
plugging up the buses
now? And how many more
do we would we need to put
in? >> So,
um with
that original map of the five
districts,
um
Las Cruces is installing
them. I believe that they will be
ready for this coming
school year.
Um
Santa Fe, as I
mentioned earlier, they have,
they have them too when they
initially installed, you know,
they got their first bus, they actually
installed five chargers at
the same time to as an
efficiency measure. So they would,
you know, the cost wouldn't
go up adding one at
a time.
Um
And
>> so Mr Chair,
Mr Good, are there any
rural schools that have
these stations?
>> Actually, I can tell you
Dulce
up on the Horia
reservation has,
has one of these, they haven't,
they just received theirs
and they're going to be start
using it in the new year. They
believe the
school district, Lake
Arthur school
district in the middle of Permian
Basin uh
is also anticipating
receiving theirs very soon
and they will have two of the
electric school buses
incidentally, Lake Arthur
school bus talking about vehicle to
grid there
provider. I think it's
SPS
Division of EXL
energy that
serves Southeast region.
Uh They,
they have provided the
district as apparently
they are any
entity with
fleets. They're offering
districts
this
not to pay for the charger
but the design and engineering
work for
chargers. They
will provide that as a
service. Their request
to the school district, which the
district is happy to do
so. Is that the
charger be installed
literally on the fence?
So if this
is this
fence and this side is the
school bus yard that's secure
and the bus plugs in on this
side,
passenger vehicles can
plug in on that side,
John Q
public or whoever can
plug in on that side.
And the school district will have
if you will a trickle of
income as the trickle
of electricity goes out to
charge those private
vehicles. >> I
see. Thank you, Mr
Gooder. Thank you Mr
Chair.
>> Well, thank you. Thank you
Charles.
Uh for being here. I just have one quick
question. See you talk
about uh
Colorado was
leading
with 65 million
for elective school buses over a period
of how, how
long
is that? A one year
thing?
>> That was a one year
appropriation. So
I I can't, sorry,
I do not know if their
budget process is the same
as ours where we
just.
Right. Right. Yeah, it was for a short
period. >> I asked that.
So,
correct me if I'm wrong. So we're
only New Mexico
gave you 1.5
million this year.
Right. >> Correct.
That was specifically for,
>> that's, that's the total
just >> to help with
infrastructure,
>> how much for buses
>> uh nothing specifically
allocated for the purchase
of electric school buses.
>> So
Colorado's
spending 65 million.
We're spending
1.5.
It's, it's quite a gap. Of course, they
have more money.
So what's, what's gonna be the
ask for 625
or, or maybe you don't know
yet.
>> I'm sorry, Mr
Chair, >> the
the for
how much
in appropriation? >> Well, the
HB 75
is not going to be asking
for the outright
purchase again. It's
simply a fix
so that the districts
can
use that same
process
for electric buses as
they currently can for diesel
buses as well as a
fix. That allows
the vehicle to grid
agreements to be made by a
district with a utility
provider.
>> Ok, thank you for that answer.
How many
electric school buses do we
have on actually on the road
today? How >> many school
buses in New Mexico? Electric?
011.
Yes. By beginning
of next year there will
be
uh
nine I think. And
then, and then as
the Albuquerque schools
gets their bus, I don't know what their
schedule is for receiving them
and so on. So that'll add
20 more.
But it's a very small number.
Yes. >> Very, very low
numbers.
>> Yes, >> you can
count on your fingers.
>> Correct. We, we do
replace about 300 diesel
buses a year.
>> 300. >> That's the
turnover rate.
>> Ok. Well, thank you for that answer.
That's all I have
and here and
that concludes
uh
this
agenda item.
Thank you again for being
here
and we have
a
one person
on
now. We'll move to public comment.
We have two
individuals in the room who would
like to speak and we have one on
Zoom. So first we'll take
two
rows.
>> This
one.
Thank
you,
Microsoft.
>> I got it. Ok, sorry.
Um I'm just gonna make
AAA few points of
clarification to
put this whole thing in some
perspective. Uh
Number one, the whole electric
vehicle industry is brand
new. Uh the first
electric vehicles in modern
times hit, hit the, hit
the roads in what 2011
or 2012 with
Tesla and large
numbers of electric vehicles
didn't hit the road, maybe
not even yet.
Uh It's just, it's just
really beginning. And so
there are a lot of growing pains
uh that that naturally
occur with, with the new
industry. One
simple example of the things
you've heard a lot about the
expense of new car, new
electric vehicles and they
are more expensive today,
but I've had a Tesla
for, since
2014. So,
10 years, plus
my total maintenance
cost, not counting
tires and, and
windshield wipers.
My total maintenance cost
in those 10 years has been
$300
that applies to most
electric vehicles. Yeah, you'll
get some, their lemons. But,
but for the most part
you, the, the, the total
cost of ownership is
way lower and they
last a lot longer
because they have no moving parts.
They're, they're, they're
computer on wheels.
Um, two things
you've heard a lot about
home charging,
it's gonna be very limited.
If you look at the
age, that's the power that
goes into a home.
Most private homes
have a limit set by
the utility company of
200 amps.
Uh, commercial scale
is 400
amps. If you
have air conditioning in your home
and use an electric dryer,
you've got our electric
refrigerator and a few other
electric appliances. You're
probably already close to
your 200 amps. You're
not gonna be able to install
a home charger without
having to raise the
amor uh
capacity into your
home. And you can't go
befo beyond 400.
I had to upgrade my house
from 200. I upgraded it to
380 when I got,
when I got my car.
Uh, but that's going to be a
huge problem for
a lot of people. It's more than
just buying a
charger uh, for
your home.
Um,
the, the, in the
DC fast charger
space that you've heard a
lot about that.
There's more than one kind of DC
fast charger, the older
ones that are out there
now, for the most part are
50 kilowatt.
The standard right now
today is 100 and
50 kilowatt
and that means you can
charge a lot faster.
Even with DC. Fast
charging. The
next standard aren't cars
that can take it yet. Not
many is going
to be 350
kilowatt and that's what's
coming.
Ok? And, and probably
in about 5 to
6 years, 350
kilowatt, chargers are gonna be the
standard. Not a huge
difference in cost between a
50 kilowatt to
install a 50 kilowatt
versus a 350
kilowatt. Uh But
there's no point in installing the
350 if, if, if
cars can't take it,
uh Grid
supplementation is going to be
important and, and like
he said, he talked about
vehicle to, to
grid. It's
gonna be the same thing from Charger
hubs to grid because
Charger hubs, we, what
I I run a company called Ghost
Station which is in installing Chargers
all around the country. We only
have one in New Mexico right now
at Winrock. Um
But, but we're bidding
on five others in the, in the state
right now, but we're, we're big,
our biggest, we're biggest in,
in Georgia. Uh But
we're also operating in Texas
and North Carolina and
Tennessee. The
Georgia and Tennessee are the
states that are promoting
ev charging
and ev electric
vehicles more than
anybody.
People aren't going
to be buying electric
vehicles in the future
because they are
green. They're gonna
be buying electric
vehicles because they're
better, they're more
fun to drive. They're
more efficient. They're
ultimately gonna be way
less costly.
So, electric vehicles
aren't, the early
adopters were the green
people. It's
changing. It's going
to be because they're better
cars. You're gonna like
them, they're more reliable,
they're just more fun to drive,
they're safer. Uh,
so that, that, that's
the route that people are gonna go.
Biggest problems
permitting
to, to install a charger
is going to become issues.
It's slow everywhere.
Uh, most cities aren't
really adept
at handling it. I know
that's something the legislature can
deal with or not.
My company ghost station
is installing,
uh, chargers
in, uh, economically
depressed areas
aggressively.
Ok. Uh, there's a,
there's a, our, our, our
first example was
in, in, um,
Charlotte, North Carolina
in an area called Old
Charlotte, which
is mere image
of our, the international district
in Albuquerque. Ok.
We installed a charger there
because we thought people
were going to start buying used
evs, well, it
turns out used
evs aren't available
yet. There haven't been enough evs
around yet for people
to be ready to, to trade them in
on newer ones. Uh,
that is only gonna
start happening in the next
couple of years. But
what has happened in, in
Old Charlotte is
people with
the, the means to buy
an electric car. Anen of
an electric car
are coming to the
chargers in
Old Charlotte and
using them and going to the
coffee shop and the Doughnut
store. And, and
unexpectedly, we were surprised
by the impact but it actually
had favorable
economic impact to
that community never
expected that to happen. We only
learned about it as, as
it happened, a fascinating
experience. Um
and final comment just to,
to, to, to clarify
battery safety was a
question from a from one
of the legislatures
legislators.
Um early
batteries were all
lithium-ion
but lithium-ion means
lithium in something
else. And they were all
lithium cobalt,
lithium cobalt is
very hard to control the
temperatures of the individual
cells in the battery. And
most of the battery manufacturers
were doing it with software
which failed occasionally.
Everyone. Now for the
most part for cars
is switching to lithium
iron. It's not
as dense. So
they, they had, they're not, they don't weigh
more but they're bigger
and that's a problem but that,
but they're going that,
that, that, that's the direction
going that essentially going to
eliminate those kind
of fires. Um
The, the
um the other
thing that's happening is massive
efforts going on globally.
In coming up with new battery
battery technology. We've
got at least four
companies right here in New Mexico
doing research to develop
new kinds of batteries that
will, will replace all this
lithium stuff. It's
not gonna be a problem for,
for much more than five
years. Uh maybe
10, probably worst
case. Um
Those are the key points that I
wanted to make just just as part
of clarification and, and,
and giving you perspective
on, on what's happening in this
industry.
>> Thank you, Mr Rose for
your comments.
Thank you for being here. Next. We
have uh Tim
Buxton
and
blue shirt.
Oh, the guy in the front,
I know him. I forget his
name
>> is his
son
is on. Ok. Um
Mr Chair. Um
I live in Albuquerque
and um
we have,
since September, we've
had uh ev six that
we bought um from a Kia
dealer here. Uh
Very happy with
it. Uh We've made
several trips of over 1000
miles and
uh the pickup
is great and it doesn't
have emissions.
I say that partly to
indicate that I think
that um even
if there's a problem with
some saying demand
now more
and more people are going to
be
having ebs
and telling their friends about
them. Our friends are
several have purchased
them already to,
based on our experience.
So I think that's
gonna be something that's going to improve
with time. The other thing
we've noticed is,
um
Albuquerque's air
quality is
pretty awful. A lot of the
time. A lot of that's
from ozone. A lot of it's from
particulates that
has a tremendous
burden on,
on the people who live here.
Uh evs
take care of that. You're,
you are, you're not emitting uh
from exhaust and you're
not causing a lot of uh
gasoline to be
shipped in and, and pumped
that gives off
ozone precursors
into the air.
So what
I'm thinking is that,
um,
the interest of the state
of New Mexico is
to have as many people
who drive as much,
um, have evs
as possible. And that
seems like if you can,
um,
take advantage of the affordability
of used
evs and the
fact that used vs
run and run and run,
they're so simple as
has been said, many times,
they're going to be a source of
low cost
ev ownership
for a lot of people.
So I'm just
thinking
that
as, as the state thinks
about
putting
uh trying to get as
many EVs
into people's hands,
um They're going to need
to make
sure that they have a place to plug
it in wherever they live.
And Albuquerque is
starting to address that, but I think
statewide there should be
a push to
have uh even multis
multifamily housing,
um have
all the uh
outlets that they need for
people to
uh even in low
income situations
to be able to use
evs.
Um Thank
you,
>> Buckson for your comments.
Thank you for being here next
up. We have
uh gym
to
Deardon,
Dis Dis
Jardin.
>> Thank you very much, uh
Mr chairman,
members of the committee. My
name is Jim Desjardin
and I'm the Executive Director
of the Renewable Energy Industries
Association of New Mexico.
We have about 60
diverse members
and our mission
is to advocate for the
uh transition to renewable
energy in New Mexico. We
do this at the state
legislature and
at the public regulation
commission, and
I'm here to give the consumer,
consumer perspective
on electric vehicles.
Uh, I've been an owner for
six years. I
purchase a new EV
for about $31,000
and then I got a $7500
tax credit. And by
the way, I'm also non
rich, um,
as an EV owner, as
EV owners would testify. And you've heard
that here, uh, just
very recently, they're smoother,
quieter, less
maintenance, lower cost
to operate.
And I get
about four miles per
kilowatt hour on P and M
system. I pay about 12.5
cents or I would if I didn't have
solar. But if you do the math,
four miles for
12.5 cents,
eight miles for
a quarter, you
can do the math from there. You
get 32 miles for
a dollar of energy
so obviously much
less expensive
to operate.
Um, and although
80% of the charging
is at home and that's been my experience
over my six years.
You do have to sometimes
charge outside. And my
one pet peeve is
that the
commercial,
um, charging
equipment, they all have different
apps drives me
crazy. And I
wish they would just take a cue
from gas stations
where you just put a credit card
in and it works.
Um, and by the way, I think the
future will be, won't
be gas stations, they won't
be EV chargers will
have energy stations. So
people will have a
car with
a combustion engine, they'll put
in gas if you need
to charge you go over here to this
spot, sort of like you have
diesel and regular gas
right now at many of the
large gas stations on the
interstate,
I do want to say, and I'm speaking
on behalf of my, the organization
that I represent, we see
this as a tremendous
opportunity
because all
these charging
infrastructure, someone's
gonna have to put that in and that's
a huge economic
development and that's a lot of
jobs and a lot
of, again, a lot of
opportunities. And
so I'm urging the
automobile industry and
I, you know,
I,
I don't, I can't say that I emphasize
with this person, but I appreciate
the person who was sitting here earlier
was talking about his challenges,
but I do think it is a
glass half empty,
not a glass half
full and to
kind of finish up on my
remarks. Henry Ford
was quoted that if
I asked people what they wanted,
they would have told me a faster
horse and buggy. And
so obviously, we transitioned
from horse and buggies to
combustion engines. And I
think we are now at the time where
we're going to be transitioning
to electric vehicles
and I'm hoping that we can take
advantage of that opportunity as much as
possible. Thank you very
much.
>> Well, thank you. Thank you for
being here. I appreciate,
particularly,
uh, like your,
your quote about the
buggies. I
wish I had that
in order to respond to the last
guy was here.
Thank you. I
have to write that
down
so that,
uh,
concludes, uh, this meeting
unless someone has some lastminute
comments.
Thank everybody for being
here, particularly those
who hung around to the
end.
Um, interesting
meeting and, uh, we'll see
you again next
month.
So this, this meeting is
adjourned. Great.
