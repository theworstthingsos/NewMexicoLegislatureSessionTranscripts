Good morning, Madam Chair. My
name is Shawna Keyser, and I'll
be stepping into the roles at
the end of the.
And of course Shana did the
right thing, as will Raoul,
turning on the microphone, I
apologize for not reminding
everyone to do that. Good
morning, everyone. Raul
Burciaga. Mhm.
Counting the day.
All right, so we'll begin this
morning, uh, Anna, about our
executive date,
correct? Man, man, should we
have an agenda to approve and
the minutes to approve. Thank
you so much, so I will accept a
motion to prove the agenda.
Motion, Madam Chair, to prove
the agenda.
Mr. Secretary, opposite agenda.
We also have minutes from our
meeting of May. I'll accept.
So moved
And any opposition to approval
of those. So and now we will go
to it.
We're having technical
difficulties, so we bringing in
this.
Good morning Madam Chair, Madam
President.
And members of the
And I and Miss Silva and I are
here to provide you some
background.
On the
Background the history that goes
back quite a ways.
And then Miss Silbo will
Give you an update on the most
recent.
Initiatives and the status of
where the EOB is at the moment.
So some of you are are are are
new to to this and always let me
start by saying that in the year
2000.
Hm
This commission adopted a master
plan that and there were a few
initiatives that they identified
in uh around 2008, 2009.
And then there was the approval
for and funding.
Um, it was a discussion Health
and Human Services complex.
Capitol campus.
To the main Capitol campus, this
area, if you will, the South
capital.
Fast forward to 2009.
Technically back then it was the
well.
One of its deputies management
division.
in 2010 and that had been
completed.
In 2011.
This commission identified and
that you will be as the first uh
to the state.
51 relocating constitutes
specifically that would be the
state treasurer's office.
Second is.
And
Hm
Relieving, overcrowding in the
Battan building.
Um, or initiating building
housing new or more occupants
specifically agencies and then
just simply relocating agencies,
uh, issues were raised about
complying with the statutes
regarding state 5 buildings
across the housing more commonly
referred to, they have been
upgraded to by.
The City of Santa Fe is in 2015,
it was an acknowledgement of
delays due to a number of
factors, the recession and
decreased administration request
to reconsider the EOB size for
the most part between 2016 and
20.
But in January of 2021, this
commission reviewed in 21, 2021,
that same year, June, this
commissioner planning phase for
the EOB.
First phase of funding for the.
And uh so we got, we always will
be.
Uh, funding, as I mentioned, the
status since 20, Madam Chair,
members of.
So where are we now? So since
then, uh, in 2023 we went back
before the historic review
board.
And um at that first initial
meeting, the uh Casitas were
determined which way they were
then downgraded. So then we went
before the board and we
requested demolition of the 4
Casitas.
Um, we have since been denied.
And so which prompted the next
phase of the process, which was
a joint.
So, um, we went started through
the process, we designated the
members and then we determined
as a state, um, from the state
perspective, that's the, uh,
point of, um, of disagreement
that has been, uh, remained
unresolved has been the design.
So then we withdrew our request
uh to go before the joint
committee and instead what we
are doing um is we are moving
toward the we have a contracted
with a uh design firm which is
FBT Architects out of
Albuquerque.
And we are now going to move to
the programming phase to uh
determine who is going to occupy
the executive office building.
Um, once we determine we will
work through the programming
phase, which will determine the
size of the building.
Um, once we complete that phase,
then we will, uh, engage the
city which has been, uh, the,
uh, discussion all along so that
we can then enter into the
collaborative process of working
as a joint between the city and
the state as far as the final
design of the building.
So, um, we will, uh, in the next
few months, either uh end of
September or October time frame
have a kickoff meeting with part
of the occupant process, um, so
that is scheduled to be again
end of Octo uh end of September
1st part of October where we
will sessions. That is um
expected to take at least 3 to 4
months and then, uh, once we
completed the programming phase,
then we'll enter into schematic
design.
The uh this.
Right
By moving forward more space for
sessions. Well, it's a long term
project, but.
It is necessary.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
We'll stand for questions.
Thank you so much.
So and I don't have any either,
just thank you for what you've
done, which is kind of reset so
that we can move forward with
the city that was kind of the
big.
Barrier that came up, so I
really appreciate the ability uh
to just reset and move thing.
Look forward to seeing that.
Right.
So next on white inventory of
properties and facilities.
Status report from Petrona
Sanandi Aguilar.
This is very timely.
We're being asked by our fellow
colleagues, uh, where's that
building uh that I can use for
my office staff, uh, send me a
map, so very timely.
And can you push the microphone
on.
And uh
Madam Chairman, members, um.
And Madam Chairman, members of
the commission, uh a little bit
about the work that we've done
do a quick.
Uh overview online to show you
what is on there.
Uh, we focused on two primary
things, uh, uh, during the last
year.
One of which was just uh ongoing
efforts to update the inventory.
Uh, some of the key buildings
Uh, we reached out for the
lion's share of them. They're
the thing and then the other
thing that we've been doing
reconciling some of the space
assignments that I use.
So we're having to update names
through all it's a thing that
the commission has always asked
us to do, but we had adding to
the inventory and compiled a
full inva facilities.
So that is um.
About there are 31 HEIs and one
thing to be clear, I work with
HED, they need to.
that side of the inventory up to
date and current, uh.
And hear review or the other
year you either that.
Um, we have had feedback from
All of those agencies and we are
working with HED to get uh input
from those, um, and that for a
couple of those 10
they have the inventory website
has been updated now to include
higher ed, it can be.
Reached at this URL.
And what you're seeing there is
the.
headline banner that you will
see when you go to the URL, and
if you'll notice now there's two
different sections. The section
for the executive judicial
legislative.
Uh, entities, which is what was
the original inventory and then
the other half which is the
higher and inventory. The side
section of the fire that says
background that's where you will
be able to go to find out a
little bit about.
The data sources do a quick
little switch here.
See if we get this going.
OK.
This is a
My mouse.
I'm out.
OK, there we go.
So again, there's two different
ways you can uh maneuver around
this. You can use the.
down menus here.
And look at own facilities,
leased facilities.
Properties that are.
Uh
Provided to the state by the
counties. Um, that's something a
lot of people don't understand
is that a lot of state employees
reside in facilities that are
provided to them by statute, the
district attorney, the district
courts, and the public health
offices are all required to be
provided space by the counties,
so we don't own that space.
But we have a vested interest in
it because all of the document
that.
There is one leased purchase
facility in the state, which is,
uh, so that is a unique, uh.
Uh,
Entity within the inventory.
Um, you can look at it through
the pull down menus.
Uh, there was a very robust
search tool.
Or you can look at it again
through just a little uh.
The
The search engine allows you to
search by word. It allows you to
search by jurisdiction.
Uh, and by jurisdiction what we
mean is, is it under GST purview
or.
Not and
you can look at it at all
branches legislative, executive
and uh
Judicial
Um, you can look at it by
ownership. You can look at it
whether it's leased or owned or
owned.
Um, and you can look at it.
By a particular sites there is a
full pull down menu of
A lot of the different sites,
each site is assigned a unique
site code.
And uh you can also do some
searches uh by a bunch of
different by.
Uh, I, I look at it if you want
to see, you can go here if you
want to see more and once you do
pull it up.
All of the state holdings.
And
Uh, color coding, uh.
Zoom into any of this, it'll
zoom down to the site level and
at most of these locations
where.
We have a, so we've got markers
for but for the most part, uh
this stuff show you what's new.
Uh, for the higher education.
Again, we have 4 different types
of 2-year branch of the
four-year institutions. And when
you pull this up.
And this one also has a fairly
one of the things to be
cognizant of is that.
We are not uh addressing FTE
data. We do have FTE data on
the.
Again, you can search my uh you
can search my school types.
Um, what's what I want to point
out since.
In Hawaii. So it goes all the
way out there. It zooms all the
way up.
A lot of the remote assets and
some of them, some of them are
probably just uh.
And other than that, I just want
to report to you, uh.
That uh
We have a lot of uh different
land data in the inventory. Lab
data is something that we have
not updated in.
It's uh in the original
inventory.
And that changes a lot at some
point in the future.
of a demo.
Have you, have you separate
properties or places you've,
Madam Chairman, um, not.
Earlier this week.
There is a lot of documentation
about um primarily it's a.
County we reached out to uh
municipalities Anna Vernalio is
more than happy and them saying
they would be more than happy to
pro so it's, it's, it's, it
varies from who we spoke to, but
we spoke to.
So I haven't seen that report
was that sent out to us idle?
Man
Sure
I did, um.
I thought I had mailed emailed
that out either last Friday or
Monday, but I'll double check on
that.
Though I had sent it.
Chiefs of staff. I'll go back
and check.
Resend it to me. Thank you.
All right.
Thank you, Madam Chair. How
about
Couple of questions one I'm
generally generally I don't
think there's anybody.
So, um,
On the post-secondary
institutions specifically.
Is there an effort to to analyze
the physical space trend data
over a period of time.
I know you have FT I'm, I'm
assuming you're talking to
full-time enrollment right at
the institutions, but is there
an analysis that's being done to
look at change in.
Online credit hours versus in
person credit hour.
And my, my principal concern is
that as.
They continue to get money for
building improvements and new
facilities.
As you visit these institutions,
I mean, just in the last 3
months alone I've been in you
can carry messlands. I've been
at Highlands in Las V Vegas,
I've been to Portavi at Easter.
And it used to be that when you
go to these institutions, if you
got 5 blocks from the building
you were going, you were lucky,
um.
And it seems now that these
facilities are emptier as I know
a lot of capital outlets.
And are we looking to see if
those buildings now are still
being used except by a fraction
of the in-person.
Um,
So
Online
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, so I
think it would be.
Us to look at what which of
those spaces that address some
of the state agency needs it,
uh.
It gets, uh, I think it really
in a next question I have is.
Went back to the data that you
have here, is there an effort?
Who also start to identify
condition ratings for the
facilities at these agent
capital improvement.
This is where I get on my
soapbox, right?
So the Department of
Transportation has 1.5 million
square feet over 600s
corrections, they probably care
less about what that space looks
like, I imagine.
But half the number of
facilities.
Going back over the last 8
years, we haven't received any
capital outlay appro uh
maintenance and upkeep.
And so is there an effort for us
to meetings that help.
Agencies say, you know, FMD has
rated these facilities all
inadequate. As opposed to, you
know, um, funding.
Or more arbitrarily, but uh, I
mean, we have facilities where
our staff are not allowed to
trans because of the sulfur
levels in that water on seats,
and I mean just you know,
general things in terrible
condition and I, and so our
facility maintenance.
How to prioritize.
Capital improvements across.
So, um.
Um,
Secondly, we do, uh, conduct all
of our facilities. However,
Excuse me.
Um, however, um, RP.
Madam Chair, is it possible for
Uh
You know, that, that digital
Thank you and uh Madam Chair, I
think when it comes to the
funding, if, if the funds, if
you are successful with your
ICIP request and the ESD, um, I
think that might be we do have
another appropriation outside of
that that maybe um doesn't go
through the capital projects
fund.
Thanks man. I'm sure I think we
should figure it out because it
creates, you know, stepchildren
situation with these some very
out outward faces.
You know, essentially have to
roll the dice with the capital
outlay uh with the II process to
get funding.
Um, it'd be there, you know.
In comparison to other facility
that, you know, get measured,
so, um, if you haven't gotten
degencies.
State-owned space.
Dispose or acquire if it's a big
picture.
No, uh, the manner state
facilities and which is.
Problem with a lot of this.
It with
And seeing some very encouraging
signs out there.

Masters also associated with all

The higher education gradually
happening at every initiating

successful effort to uh.

the net in the future, there's
the up knit that into.
Of good.
Filling you, Madam Chair. Um, so
you mentioned all of these other
agencies, um, doing their own
master plans. So would you need
additional funding to have that
statewide comprehensive.
FCI list.
Secretary Cerna when we talked
out of the road.
Are you suggesting that age that
it reflects that, what are we
agency, of course, it's quite or
not you have 21% could certainly
do it.
Albuquerque
They're 5.
It's something that
Adam chair, um, I think the
question that I would have is,
is this.
Um, because I think it's hard,
it's difficult on my end to.
You know, maybe ask for funding
other agencies doing it and what
does that look like? So I think
this is probably a bigger
conversation that probably Miss
Silver and I.
All right. Well, thank you for
offering to do that with Miss
Silva work for us ongoing and
uh.
Think balingsley and Miss Silva.
You're uh you're also
essentially what you just did,
you moved. Thank you, Madam
Chair. don't mean interrupt in
case somebody has questions,
but.
I just wanted to mention that.
To mention that.
Statues that the staff is is
council service assisted by.
furniture in addition to that.
Uh, this commission can.
Master planning.
Right.
Intertwined, we all really are.
OK
All right.
Uh, actually, to us, this is
last year's Madam Chair, that's
correct. That's just.
