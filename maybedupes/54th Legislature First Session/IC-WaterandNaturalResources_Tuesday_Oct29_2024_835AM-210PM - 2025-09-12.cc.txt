Let's get started.
So welcome to the second day of the
Water National Resources Committee,
uh
Heavy and Oil and gas issues.
But today is the
alternative.
Uh we
started late yesterday because of
technical difficulties.
We have one
analysts
traffic for this morning's
panel. So it's completely
we go in the order
that you appear on the agenda, but
joy Curri uh
and late. So we got to
the end um
and any questions
or commentary, thousands from
the committee before we get
started.
Ok. So yesterday, we found
uh these, these are
fellas mics and
they got to be pregnant directly in
front of you. So
off side, you kind
of lose it. So you're gonna have to
move them around as you take your
turns and speaking.
And so first step of this morning, we'll
have our panel this morning
is solar development
interconnection issues, community
solar and the closed local
solar access. But and
first step, we're gonna have Kevin
Crane.
>> Thank you, Mr.
And what was
>> not really like?
>> We got to get
right into it. Ok.
Thank you. Um
Yeah, thanks so much for the opportunity
to address the committee today.
I really appreciate the
time and I guess just
to start off the quick
show again, who, who knows what
solar is
solar is? Who knows
what community solar
is,
but less, less who thinks
they have a really good grasp of how
it works?
Ok, let's
uh let's, let's go around
three. So
my name is Kevin Craig.
I'm here with the Coalition
for
AC C
A was my
passage of so
and the forthcoming
opinion that
public reg
have a quick side
on
but CCS A
is a won't believe
the point there much
to where maybe solar
sits
in. Uh So New Mexico
had a long thriving rooftops
industry. It is to raise
your scale.
So across the state community
solar really those right
ball had to
be
going to to five megawatts
on scale. Um And, and
it kind of looks for a utility
scale. Uh development
brings those economies of
scale its
for our
respective. Um But it had
a whole
which it has been cut
so
that
uh it's a large community
importantor important, but
only about 3 4%
of households nationally actually
access jobs
from lack of
roof space like
homeownership.
Three sha
didn't want to cut down
whatever it may be in the bathroom.
Majority of the they'll
have access to stop. So
these al
to pathway
for them to correctly participate
in the energy transition.
So it's be so
it's about 1 to
5 megawatt size
of that power is about 200 to
1000 pounds, things
up about 5 to 25
m just to put it kind of me in.
And so, you know,
the quarter of someone's fire
stock and a
whole arsenal. It's not
like A
I am.
Uh There are multiple subscribers,
residents, businesses
that subscribe and receive
bill grants on the bill. And so
that's kind of their um their
participation in all
process and they're able to
use that are
on
to.
So how does it work?
Uh So a
project developer is going
to develop the project, that project
is going directly
jack its electrons
into the utilities distribution
system where it can be sold, full
retail range.
Uh electric utility
operates that power,
they sellable energy
sell to the
nearest customer by
and it applies. So bill
credits for
subscribers which may be
right next to the array and can
be, you know, somewhere
else.
Uh from there, the the community
subscriber make a
participation,
refer to convene
uh And then the community solar
developer does the
state through
the
uh so talk a little bit
about the development process,
how these projects come.
Uh So this
is kind of a chart that lays out
rough trajectory of mobile
project cycle.
Don't think
about to work this far away. But
uh in New Mexico,
we had a 1700
me and projects
state enrollment program that
additional 200 megawatt are pain.
Uh 200 megawatts
were selected and all
200 megawatts are currently moving
that utility interconnection
with the the transmission
power there.
At the same
time, the
uh the way ability
to start subscription
drives as of
right now, the learn administrator is
not allowing
or subscription managers to
actually the public
and to offer subscriptions
because there's a key detail that
can be determined by
PR C control about or
the execution
disclosures are, which
is the first step in the
process of the
subscribed
meal that never. Um
And then, you know, for all, I
think what your constituents are most
interested in is a
subscription drive on ad DH
have an opportunity participation
program. Uh So
the final design
construction. So the
phase
a that's a lot of money you spend,
that's for a lot of the cost from
a lot of economic
from and then
I ener station, which
is where you're gonna
start
service.
Uh
So I talking about interconnection,
I want to kind of do that and
provide a bit of an update on the kind
of having your connection process
going in
regards.
So project, so
you progress processing
interconnections that is been
slow. That's something that we see in a
lot of states. Uh kind
of a new things, utilities
studies, types of
projects. Um
But we've seen, you know,
delays longer
than we ever.
And so we're, we're,
you see that take up pace
as utilities get more experience
with we solar style
projects and view those
from their connection perspective.
Um Yes, I like
coming out of the section
four of
uh is, is much longer than
expect that we
see like a back Latin
perspective. So we see
some until the
is quoted at, you know, 2 to 3
years for the
create. So obviously, this would
be uh what it
play in, bring the project
online,
create very much three
years. I
think, I don't know what would be available
in our connection
standards, piece of
information that was
available across the country.
We really facilitate interne
cost sharing.
It will be all
Mexico interconnection
rules and so
rules to allow the projects
to share mutually
evolution of
per second, but they need
to be able to figure out how they
talk to share that
costs. So having that
publicly available in their connections
with the double and
you to identify the next
I start that conversation
with and then
lastly
particular in the
PS service, um they're more
of a regional
transmission operator called
SVP
or
some Power and SPS
identified with the majority of
projects
need
um that typically
study projects that are hundreds
of megawatts or thousands of
megawatts. And so when you're
vaccinating one
megawatt or half a
megawatt is
a little perplexed. So so
that
it study people
years study
that costs
$60,000
to see the process started.
And so I think that has really
a big that
because
that
does live in a bit of a gray area
because the RS
reports spur
for SBS reports
FC. So there's
was know
to through the 01
really the
condition by
the, that's
something
I
the one to talk about
connection updates that can really
help support face
to,
to those public
available and capacity
information, whether
it's all the mask submarines
otherwise later,
extremely helpful. These
projects area
degree than the add.
Are you talking about the public
interconnection to
something that it's really
about a on the
ground? Um So
reporting on the interconnection
study hra the
actual enforcement of the
device Mexico
has supporting
with the
council, the
best interconnection rules
on the most in the
country, but they're
not being implemented. So it actually
allows them to realize the
full success
that
by the a
uh the proactive
work for
long time items. So
again, you're during these 23
year times, a lot of that
time to perform the study
section community.
So that is very specialized,
like specific. A lot of that equipment
is also very
standardized, you simply
need to, you need a certain
amount of the people.
And so I think there's an opportunity
for you to least proactive. And
here some of that, you know, at a certain
level to be broad
and their
service, their
service
uh prior
prioritizing projects that
have a lot of interconnection
path,
that was something that was not really
contemplated in the
first.
And so I think we see some
projects that was found that
connection, they
have best
interconnected in the first place.
And then lastly, uh they
process this
cautionary, they
go into the
for cautionary,
but it is actually play out the
process
like
that
PR C and
uh going a little bit
kind of recent anticipate
action
stadium, they did
extend a low income, subscribe to
their live for less,
right. Another part
earlier in the spring that was
super helpful. We've seen
it actually
finalizing the information
that's needed to allow
folks subscriber in the.
So actually right back
asten
right now uh collection
of the lessons learned uh also
happened in the spring. We're
expecting that to come
and they came
in. Uh
I do the family
or program. You have a couple
really a lot
of maintain
the momentum of the program.
It shows certainty to
developers to keep their land
leases fresh that if there's
gonna be kind of light of human tunnel
ability for some of those
projects that continue in the
store under
about 1100 laws
of it's fully
permitted
Andra but you need to kind of take
steps these
permits about
so that your uh fit
into the next station,
removing the barriers who welcome
to program
and conditionally improve what I
call true self atta
so that who need
for confirming documentation
to become qualified customers,
which is a quite based
on the customer side
B it's very
volatile information actually
out
security number
of the address. That's
not information that you want to kind
of have
something that increase on the
process.
Sorry, we're not a little bit, but
there's a status report to
uh this
from PR C
on Friday. And I really look forward
to in that uh
report, I encourage you
see that you have a
question indeed. We
ask to
ask me or
if you have any questions
for us on how to
employ or, or how to
pre k
how, but I think
that
and then last thing, there is a
broad
uh uh with the state
process Laing and
wait for that schedule.
That's really gonna kind of set the
stage
one more slide here to
go to the question
appropriate. So what's next
out below?
So the work projects are
continued to work through the
process, but
earlier, they're working
work now. And I think
we take that
really up in earnest in
2025. It probably a
little six
again, try to get about some of those
long time.
We
on a subscription drive, we,
we key decision
from the PR C actually
allow those
as soon as that a
stab
just really
screen from a public
perspective, public
certain or have
a sub, I
want to ask questions.
I know kind of the uh
signing up for the
program uh
or as I mentioned to you
just here on Friday
that are not have to
be legislation to
get
I have a program building
from here.
Um Talking about the rule maybe
taking off, but I
kind of that. So whether the
next you know the next
phase of the program,
there may be potential
amendments
coming
rumors that we do in the
pas follow
her
and you'll see that it says
that the act is actually
critical
and very successful
program was far.
So curious
to that with the great
salt
from a legislative change
perspective. And then as I
mentioned in the connector,
I, I think there is an
opportunity,
legislative
decision and,
and use that as a way to
implement the state
setting mechanisms for accountability.
And 25
hosting vast
resources be
available to you. Uh they
available.
So I forward to
work
with proponents to
bring forward
connection legislation,
health,
or uh both
Canadian super side
process.
That's a lot.
We
>> thank you for that. Thanks. Well,
two questions. And
the next time we have Alicia
Sha.
>> Thank you, Mr Cherry.
Many numbers
um really appreciate
the opportunity to speak with
you all and really
impressed by the topics
just so. Thank you for this.
I'm going to speak briefly
about two different things.
Uh This is a new
report that
you were the first to see
uh Public Power, New
Mexico, which is the
organization I work with, worked with
the Initiative Energy
Justice and
interviewed a range of stakeholders
about interconnection challenges
and solutions in New Mexico.
And then I will talk briefly
about a proposed
global a access
fund. And
so
um
I'm gonna just start with this
slide um
which is cut off
slightly. But
we, that's
a great website, find
energy.com
and they aggregate all
sorts of federal energy
data. Uh That
little, this is New
Mexico's electricity
fuel and that little
yellow line at the bottom
is the solar
in our entire
um electricity
generation. >> And
this, this is the first one. Maybe
I'm asking the light >> back.
Sorry, I'm a
musician. So I probably
project a lot. Um
So
out of we, you know,
New Mexico, depending on who you
talk to has
the
second or first
greatest uh solar
potential in the country.
But only, you know, we have
300 days of sunshine. We all
know and we live here but we
only have 11% of our
state's electricity banks
at this point is solar.
So there's a lot of untapped
potential. And
so one of the biggest
challenges as you've
heard are
interconnection challenges.
And so, you know,
we were motivated by hearing
lots of anecdotes
about these
challenges to understand what
was going on. So we worked with
the initiative for Energy
Justice to create
report to
investigate the barriers to their
connection
and find policy
solutions that will
support energy
access and greater
organization.
We interviewed many
stakeholders including here
c staff, local government
staff, former regulators,
solar industry professionals
and advocates, community-based
organizations and community
solar advocates.
And this report
focuses mostly
on um interconnection
challenges within the investor
owned utility service
areas. And
so these are some of the challenges
we uncovered um
outdated grid systems
that are designed to
handle distributed energy
sources like solar
that create that delay
projects, lack of
transparency. A
lot of times our our utilities
don't have their
data and capacity.
Um and, and you
know, interconnection cues which
it hes our developers
ability to plan
avior projects.
Um unfair cost
burden right now, our solar developers
and consumers go torun
of the cost for grid
upgrades.
Um Weak
enforcement. Um
You know, as was previously
mentioned by Mr Gray
there, we have a great
in our connection policy on
paper, but it doesn't have a lot
of enforcement
so that could either be fixed
in rule or potentially in
statute. Um
And so some of the solutions that
were proposed by the what was be talk
to enhancing
transparency.
Let's have a public hosting
capacity maps. New York
State has a great is a great
example of that. Let's
public say
interconnection views, this will
help people plan and
reduce the kind of risk that they're
subject to
performance incentives.
Let's shift to performance based
models that incentivize
renewable integration
and reward really
good practices
around finding in their connection
and varied energy
access. Uh Let's
improve enforcement. Let's either
update the rule
or a statute
to have better enforcement
mechanisms.
Um Diversify for
support method methods,
integrated batteries,
battery storage, and
alternative energy sources
and support stability
that reduce upgrade costs
and incentive programs for
storage which have been proposed that
the legislation can support
this distribution
system planning. There's a great
bill that passed last year in
Colorado that a lot of folks are
celebrating and we've heard a lot
about uh to have
like a really publicly
engaged distribution
planning process to
strategically manage
capacity and
support more decentralized
energy sources as well
as community engagement and
faculty. And we need more
equitable and fair mechanisms
for pricing and sharing costs for
good updates needed
to over nominate interconnection
and don't waste too much of a burden
on our for
smaller projects. So those are
some of the things that we
um found.
So shifting
here slightly. Um
we but this is
related. So we are
working well, like in
Mexico has been working
to pass a global solar
access fund. Our lead
sponsors of the health major
Butan and
Senator Code.
And so the local solar
access fund is a proposed
grant fund by
finance authority
which will issue planning
implementation brands
tribes, counties,
municipalities and school
districts for solar
and storage projects that power
public buildings and critical
infrastructure. Uh
Planning would include
funding technical expertise
including grant writers,
the technical experts to
plan these projects and
implementation would fund
construction, purchase,
installation and equipment and
interconnection of solar
energy. And
um there's many benefits
to solar cost savings,
increased revenue.
One of the ones that we hear a lot
about that is very relevant
for us, I think is also safety,
security and resiliency
in times of emergency.
If a community
has a community
center that solar
plus storage,
uh, that doesn't lose power,
that can be an emergency
cooling center that can be a
deer and kind
of wildfires or
blackouts, storms.
Um, you know, it's also great
for critical infrastructure like
water and wastewater to
make sure that those things don't lose
power. So there's a real like
resiliency and security
piece this. And then
of course, it's also
part
which supports our community's
health and helps stress climate
change. And just briefly,
we did this policy
was informed by so much
outreach out of a focus
group. We did,
uh, last year,
um, that we have called
and reached out to every single
tribe, county
municipality and schools
in the state. We
did a lot of meetings
and then we also did a statewide
survey in the top one
of which was a really good to
and you can see the,
the whole thing. But
we found over
70% of New Mexicans
support the use of both
solar and wind energy
sources. Three and
four voters agree that the state
should maximize its renewable
energy production.
Nearly half of the voters who
don't already enough in the top
solar would join a
community solar program and it
was available while 30%
aren't sure. And the majority
of voters in our state support
the creation of the state
of fund to support
uh global
solar projects led by local
governance.
Um There's
um and so,
you know, we found that there's
widespread support for this
and there's so much interest in
the science projects.
You know, in a very quick, in
last year, we got the
support of more than 50
nursing organizations including
private school districts, local
governments for state associations
and international NGO
S. Um You know,
some of our observations that
we found that
is that a
I think our tribes counties
the best capacitated to do
these kinds of projects and there's
plenty that need
support. Um But
I'd say our rural municipalities,
especially in school
districts, um
they are the ones that most need
this kind of support to be able
to do these kinds of projects, they're very
interested in them. But,
you know, without
uh accessible
funding and support to develop
these kinds of things.
Um They're just not on the table
even though they would benefit.
And um and then again, there's
lots of the public safety
resilience needs
that this fund will
support.
Um and lots of cost
benefits, lots of cost
savings and solar
is more accessible and
affordable than it ever has been
before. And the fund
will be structured to prioritize
funding projects that benefit our
rural communities,
especially serve our communities
that wouldn't be able to access solar
and storage without the funding.
Uh maybe the essential community,
million buildings and
infrastructure, more resilient,
have significant long term
operating cost, production,
support, workforce development
and they geographically diverse and
dispersed. The intention of
this fund is really to
support communities
who have not been able to access these
kinds of projects for.
And so there's a few examples
I will go through, but, you know, it's
also intended to
leverage different kinds
of federal funding.
Um And
so, in
conclusion, um
you know, the time is really now for this
and we all know we have these temporary
massive surpluses from
the of industries and
there are time sensitive federal
lending opportunities that have been
leveraged with this. There's
great desire for these kinds
of projects, but there's a need
for more support. And
so just bringing both of these
topics together, you know,
interconnection is expensive
in New Mexico and need to
change. Now, there are many
ways many legislative
fixes that are needed
potentially to address some of
these issues. But even with
these challenges, accessible
state funding will help our
communities access the benefits
of solar and be able to manage
these these costs.
So we need more solar
communities wanted and
the local solar access fund will
capacitate our state to
resolve some of these interconnection
challenges. And maybe Mexico
leader, it can be
renewable energy development.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much. Uh
except
Brandys
chair in the emergency.
Is that, is that
good?
That's OK. I was
a little more. They're more
OK.
And straight at that part time.
So it's better just to do the in
the
white.
Um I
started uh
in 2003, I went
to the first uh
solo program in the United
States. It was
located in San Juan College
in New
Mexico. It was the
only program in the United States
at the time, I've
been in the industry now for about
2020 years
and our
business
that on Seven
Grace.
Um
So the
goal is when you set out
on us
B BT A is
100%
renewable energy by
2045.
And there's
really two important
themes about this
that are
uh a
little bit. One
is that uh
just converting
the existing eng
energy
nobles is only about
a third of
the phosphates.
The rest of it
isn't really
embedded in that.
And, and then
if there is
A I
goals achieved and
it would result
in huge
uh efficiency,
games
and
consumers are going to
demand more solar,
more storage,
more DMB and
electrification
benefits
for uh
some reason, some multiple
reasons, but one reason is
it's lower, it's gonna be lower
costs.
That's
so this next
chart, I'm excuse me for
this. So it's
a,
it's I chart.
Uh but really
there's only a couple of important
things that I mentioned about
this chart.
One on the left side
is the all the energy
inputs on the right
side is all of the
energy outputs
actual end
use. And
they are all of
those
develops with a common
denominator of British
ethers or
BT.
And so the
top section there
in orange is electricity
generation and the metal
is natural gas which is used
for heating cool
Dus processes.
The lower line, this is the Troy
which drives a
trend period.
So we're gonna shift
uh to renewables
and one of
the
he uh
endeavors or,
or thoughts about this
is to electrify
everything which would
be like electric
vehicles and uh
heat heated
cooling. So
if we did that, um
we would have to put
all of that, those
sources of fossil
fuels in through our
system here of
generate electricity,
sort of like
taking the
number of cars outside
of the city and doubling or
tripling them and saying,
OK, is there
any, is it gonna be the issues
with that? There
are we need
to develop
the infrastructure
to, to handle
uh what
is being called a
distribution
where the energy is
new? The
second or
chart which is really important
that the gray
part of the chart
shows the was
and
and two thirds of the
electric generation
is is waste
heat.
And down below, we probably
have cars only about
20%
issue. And
so for example,
with electric vehicles,
cars are going to
be in the
80%
90%
efficiency.
So all of a sudden it it
it it results in a
significant benefit
um to
uh just
the efficiency. Efficiencies
means the cost of
than if we
get the volume up. So
those are the main main
points.
The
utility structure today
does not leverage
innovations, the
innovations that are happening
uh are
just
within the last five
years.
Innovation
virtual net,
which part of
that is a community
solar
sign up for
solar to
build credit on a
will. And that's
virtual. And
that can be
beyond just
solar
micros was
mentioned by
virtual power
plants which a
we
all
or individual
brainer to
participate in
a a
program that allows
the ability to access
use of those
resources when they need
it to reduce peaks,
smart columns now
offer uh
ability to load
control and
uh that also can
help with, with
peaks if there is smart
and uh
ray schedules,
solar storage
shifts all of the
uh energy in front of the
peak to the
in the mornings when the sun's not
shining. So this is really
extending the value of
solar two or three
times uh
of that time where it's
Peking in 10
to smart
solar inverters that are
now being implemented
um are actually compelled
to stabilize the grid.
So you get too much energy on
a grid, it raises gold
and some things start
cutting off. So
it helps to regulate that.
And then
um at the
bottom of all of this,
so
solar
energy uh
create jobs
through the local community,
creates health and
wealth, which
is a good thing for
all.
So
the challenges that we've been facing
with
uh
the uh connections
and I'm using behind the
me community
solar is part
of a leader um
is that homeowners and
businesses and government
organizations right now
in some areas cannot
go solar,
they're, they're prohibited from
doing it. It's called
red cell.
So uh
the utility
doesn't have a
specific
plan and time
frame to
change
that.
Uh The new rules
that are supposed to
actually double the
capacity of
uh for handling our
solar have actually
resulted
in closing
sections of the grid.
Some of this we
believe is because of the
interpretation of
the rules and how
they'll do it and we are
painting process, working with
them on that.
Mm
Utilities as, as you
mentioned, as Kevin
has mentioned delays
co as the costs
and, and
so more time,
more costs, that's
how it works.
And
right now, homeowners
are being charged with $1000
or a supplemental screen
uh because of,
of a section of the
radius that there
is.
Um in addition,
zero back and
um and, and
solar is and
storage are all
part of a solution
for situations
where really is.
So you can't,
you can't have more solar
is that exist
now. Um But
that is not permitted
uh Right now,
probably get rid.
So we're also find
them, the, these are overreaching
their bounds. They're
to the color interpretations,
the
responsibility the
authority had
jurisdiction.
So, and
that is a challenge
for us.
So,
and it was mentioned
before the
Colorado legislation that
made a huge
difference
in
um
and overcome
some of these obstacles
and I'm not gonna go
over but, but three
of the most important ones on
this is the distribution
plan uh
requirements
and you know, and uh
can't double trouble the number
of cars in
disputed go
and doing something
about is
urgent to do
something about it
now. And
that
when you talked about posting
capacity, posting capacity
means for increasing
the amount of solar
we put
on
this is at any given point
time.
So
um the
um
the other important, the other two
important ones are
establishing account
for a
consumer
to, to add. So
uh and color add
$300 rating
system, 125
kilowatts, which is a
really step
to limit the cost
to uh
to the consumer brain
there. They spread
through the system as
far as what happened.
And then finally,
the one
they mentioned all the
forces invested in
areas at on your
post capacity
or their closes
closing.
Um Do you would
meet those
area that are congested in
they can invest
because it was some of the long
times haven mentioned,
you need to start
invest in
address
the before it
close. So,
so this is what do you think
if you really important
um parts
of the legislation that we
need in the best?
So
just a
conclusion
of, you
know,
reaching
100% renewals
by
20
rooftop. So a big
part in
increasing
the uh what good our
environment strength
economy.
So we need
legislation
of
us. 5 24
5. Thank
you.
>> Thank you for that. I
thought we have
an how
we
thank you, Mr
Chair.
It seems pretty ok. Sounds
like uh
yeah, I'm gonna go with Roosevelt
County Electric Coll and
um you know, I just
want to be a
electric activity.
I I need to first I say
that that are 16
electrical ops of
electric coop
and we all have a
better power. Some of us have
better car providers.
I gonna be discussed, they not work at
all. Uh And so
they are,
but I'm
our provides less than farmers
electric and we
have no
funding
since.
Um
I, I think that what we're seeing in
Roosevelt County a
little bit different
perspective when it comes to
solar. Uh we're not
seeing a heavy
area for rooftop solar or
community solar. What
we are seeing is a lot of
landowners,
irrigation wells that are drying
well and they're trying to find
another uh
avenue for revenue off of their
land in the new. So
we're seeing solar
providers teaming up with
landowners and inpiring
for uh five
megawatts and 90 miles solar
projects.
And uh through the inquiries
on our likely level
system, you
know, I'll tell you a little bit
about our electric. We
have 11 substations,
200 miles of the
transmission line
and not all of our substations.
Well, two of our substations
uh will peak over
5 million watts in the
summer the rest of the year.
Uh not one of our substations
have by months,
loads, very lightly
loaded, really long
lines, uh
not very dense when it comes to members
per mile. And so
uh what I'm getting
has from all of the
inquiries we had for
solar makes. Not a lot of
them. It's been in a good
location from
an engineering perspective to
connect uh
mean
40 miles of distribution
line with six memories
on it. Uh maybe only
with UK W you
know, a lot of upgrades that have
to be made into
bring five or 10 megawatts all the
way back to our transmission and
substation. So,
uh but we are in the wait
for and me that final home
position was the
manager to go out.
Uh you know, and take you on the
challenge and see what, what was
happening rather
than just say no, what kind of
to make it work or make it work
for our member owners.
So, um
we went and looked at it with our
team and tried to identify
area that that would work.
Um
And so
we wanted to
attack that from the engineering perspective
and say, hey, you know,
we know about sub station
be able to be able to absorb
the low where the
none of our loads at our
substation level we able to absorb with.
So, so we're gonna have
to go back to our transmission
system, which certainly we
own and operate. So
we're gonna spread this across
all that substations. And
we're the main, we
with that perspective, we
said, OK, what
area of our transmission system
would make sense
to reduce land
loss and maybe lose
voltage on the back side of our
transmission.
And so we identified
scenarios and then
ultimately got to the point where we
said we're gonna need some
stage that
has
that's new in
a lot of a lot of
other costs
for the vendors. So
we identified the
substation. We
approached our power provider
said, hey, to work on
this, they have a work.
Uh And then the next
question was how we make
it. And
so through our provider,
we started inquiring
uh the pricing
and unfortunate pricing
is not affordable compared
to what we can get from. Our also
provided the most of
farmers. Uh
That's
well,
luckily there's granny money out there.
So let's look into that, see what we can
do to buy some of this
project. Then it took a
little while for Western
farmers to actually chew
on what we were presenting because we
looked at the cylinder by there and said,
hey, we understand the day
you made a margin
that they need to pay their operations and
maintenance and then they have an upfront
cost install
solar facility. Um
So what can we do to buy it down
on the upfront side and
maybe get that's
affordable. That
actually we are
Western device where to
see maybe a
lower.
Uh Once we
look grant money said,
hey, let's have a battery storage
project to this. And
so it became a twofold project.
And with the grant money,
we're looking at a being able
to buy down the solar
project where
we could get it at a very
affordable level.
Uh And we can
lock in that price for 30
years and that
price, the
fuel costs go up over the next
30 years. Our members will continue to
say uh
through the solar project and the
battery project
south, we're
estimating them off the bat
would save our vendors about
$400,000 a year
on the solar project.
And then another $400,000 a
year on the
battery project
uh compete shading
uh and demand shading.
So that would be a
direct savings to our vendors
as our fire costs
to the vendors. Uh
So we thought that would be a greater
deal, but
unfortunately not in the
grant. And
so uh
said
Oh, well.
And then our board came back and said,
hey, that price
is not too good. What, what can we do
to make this work? And so
we took on understand of
it. And luckily,
uh two
general managers ago,
Jer Park
and I think the early nineties
started a,
I do a project with
the state for
match funds and renewable
energy, renewable energy
efficiency photos.
And so I do that. I collect
1% add on our building
which is match
and add on by the state.
And we've had
trouble for decades trying to get
rid of that money and, and spend
it for our members needs uh
snowballing over
$2 million. And
some of our board said, hey, this is a
great project and we just
response, let's
use that $2 million.
And how else can we
ordinarily
inequitably spread
the cost of that phone across all
of our? And so,
uh unfortunately,
we don't have the funding to do the
battery project, but we're in on the
so project and we're
buying the project down $2.5
million. Most
of that coming from that renewable
energy fund.
And uh we're gonna be able
to this price for 30
years and save our
members money,
uh then
pursue, allow our money
as prices of
probably level within the
next 30 m uh
for power, but also
able to help our from the engine
perspective with them on the wild
lo uh and
being able to spread that solar across
their entire system, really,
we would have had a to be
able to accept the
project.
And
so
you got everything on my
list.
There are any
questions?
Thank you. Um So we're still
uh waiting for
uh to see
the show.
Um If she does get here, we'll
give her a chance. Let's
make a quick presentation,
but we'll go to the committee for
questions now
or is that
her?
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you. And
for your presentation,
I have
few questions about why
until
I, I really, really like it better
and creep one
is
there were
um
stay and make
and
we need to have
or when sharing of the
reading of the other
day.
Um Can you
do
we use li exactly
what that
means,
>> Mr Chair representative, I
can start and I think my colleagues
here who are actually developers
will have a lot more to say about
it. Um If you turn to
this before, you know, this is
something that we heard quite a
lot um
at this point in
time,
um you know,
uncertainty
about being able to launch
projects as well as the
costs that are
required for
connection and grid upgrades
um tend to fall
mostly on
consumers and developers.
Um Whereas they
could be distributed
more equitably between the
utility and
um you know, all the stakeholders
in the process. And I don't know
if either you relate
to add anything
based on your experience.
>> If I may
I on that, you
say
it should be shared
alone,
other state,
all the state
are you talking? What does
that mean?
I, I can see the
consumer, I
can see the provider. I
understand those are the two
that are in the day. But
are you asking people
that are not participating
in community so to pay
part of the cost?
But I don't know what you
mean,
>> representative having to add a
little over here. Uh
And so there, there are probably two different
pathways to get
to cost
sharing. So
what we largely consider cost
sharing 2.0 is
insurance developer, cost sharing.
So right now,
utility will cost
ca for
cause the media up and
response like
cost
um where it gets a little
tricky to pay
for it up, that upgrade
very rarely. Exactly.
That
typically
let's say you have a five minute
watt solar project.
You want to interconnect and
get a $10 million
cost to interconnect with
that $10 million up, actually
create 29 wtt
of us capacity.
Um As of right now, that one
developer first, I would have to
pay the full $10
million and then
three fall on projects
to just essentially
for free. And so there's
a bit of a free ridership
that entire bird was placed
on that first project
2.0 basically develops that.
Now your
first project, your
five melos with the 20 million
watt available. If you pay
25 percent of the cost,
then the next project comes in, they
pay their 20 >> five >> percent >> of the cost.
So what, >> so
it a more
distribution
amongst the
participating
benefit
should be 0.0 actually
implicating the rest of the customer
base. Uh So in that
examine, when you look
at say uh
each
other in so the line that goes
out to the passes
to the other customers on its
way, we upgraded the
line to do it
best right
there.
Um Maybe in five
years for a Toity
distribution plan, they were
gonna upgrade that line.
And so the the
customers that wild
outline therefore benefited
that project being made
by the
developer.
And so you could do an analysis to
say that, well, maybe
10% of the project.
Uh what this
investment
by
those very help
support that
or
that we got 3.0
or a multi
beneficiary,
>> Mr chairman. And that
may I
completely understand
and the cost
of
where you
think the person developer
pay 25
percent, whatever it
is, who pays the
other 75? Or you think
that the that the
utility pay
that that front
75 and
then capture the
rest that 75 of
other people come
along. I'm trying to figure
out how do we,
how is the
financing
actually?
And who's paying the bills?
>> That was represented the great
question. Uh So
there, there are two models that
work. So it can either be kind of
a radiator V
model where the
kind of the cost
of the or it can be a utility
investment where
utility paid
75 percent.
Uh and then you an account
for the carry costs,
they can get their safe we average
cost capital applied to that.
So with that second project
incident, they would pay for their
25% plus
25% of the carrying
cost that will be in
agreement over
cut
finance.
So the whole, the whole boys
everyone will do.
So it's not like expect to
give free service from utility
or greats that they
should get their
hearing house. So that,
well, so that's
typically how you set that up
just to make sure that that there's
no cross up
sensations of that up
cause
>> Mr Chairman
and,
and I think
collectively there's
something in presentation,
my concern
is
that
I think the rebuildable the
energy has the right.
I probably go on.
I'm not,
but I think the end of the
face
as you know,
got through
and, and I it
has been a disservice
to the gure
because,
and I got started
having
the stories had been
more
uh
more prevented
and we all
here
because it would be better
today. I need
your chances
of being
2030 2050.
Go
my my
realistic.
But
right now
when you look at
the
interests
is weighing
because
it either doesn't need
to get a we
of their family
in the, in the presence
of the peace, for
example.
But even
more,
we have so
renewable
saying,
but yet when
we look at their
bills, they
continue to rise
and the cost
of modernizing
the grid
and be able to better
accept
plus of renewables
on and on and,
and, and the dispatchable
of the ramp up and down
as renewables came up
has just been
months apart
then we ever
contemplated.
And the cost of that
is just,
but it's just
skyrocket.
And uh and I
think it's gonna be,
it's a treacherous path
to
when,
when I hear of
dedic
sharing
that causes the
heart palpitations
because I think the
taxpayers are getting
the brunt of this
sharing
and that's not,
I mean, if I don't want to
use the bullet time
at that's
my music,
but Kaya
shouldn't have to pay for
what I'm gonna do and vice
versa. I just need
and that, that
friction
in and
communities has
banned
and the almost winds are
down and the smaller
leaves, it will be the
less load they
have the
more
complicated it
becomes. So
I, I don't believe
that the industries should
rely
on grants
and
subsidies
in order to grow.
I think we are to grow based on
technology and
innovation. And I
know there have been range strides
and technology
and
innovation
and, and read a
little but we have a long
way to go. So
I remained
up, I
remain a skeptic
of our ability to
reach
goals
only because of
the lack
of technology
there is, you know,
applied at the admission.
But I do, I
need to go there. I think
we care.
Thank you, Representative
>> Representative
Mr Chairman. Thank >> you.
Thank you for your
presentation.
I to share
>> uh words
in Townsend. And
I >> think
>> as we go forward and,
and get the technology
right and the timing
>> r
>> I think
we're on the right path
and, but
I see a lot of problems with it
today.
Mr Chairman, I'd like to
read a
little bio from a
dairyman in Eastern New
Mexico.
We decided to put a solar
system in 2020.
The company based out of
a RD
in Mexico
Solo,
they evaluated our power
and usage and settled up
putting a 700
kilowatt
system which would cover
90% of our
car.
I've been going through all the
regulations which
took eight months to get
approval from the power
company.
We thought we were on the
way. We
decided we would finance
projects
ourselves.
So we wanted 10%
down and
pay pays
as we finish, finished
each phase.
So we were about 90%
done
and then
they wouldn't show up anymore
or take our calls.
Then we had finally heard
from them and they
were closing
shop.
So 90% finish,
still needing parts.
It took us about two months
to find someone
that was going and finish it
up. Had
to find the parts that were
missing. Order
took another three months,
another month, they were check
in the wiring of New
Mexico. The New
Mexico
Solar
all said and done and
done 60%
over but they
delayed one
year
and finally received the
grant money for 25%
of the original purchase
price.
Then we had a hailstorm
seven months ago,
we are going to have to replace
20% of the
panels,
but we have to go back to the
engineering
because they don't make those
panels anymore
that we, that, that they had
on our system.
So we are currently looking at
solutions to change
20%
to newer panels
and trying to salvage as
much as we can to get
the other percent.
80%
running.
That's what happens in the real
world
here in this room,
we're selling solder
and we gave him the scientific
numbers.
But hear the testimony of
this
individual
like
a son in law
is very
close
and his
neighbor is a
retired engineer
at A Los
is
I saw the solar system
began on the
music
and we
got to have some
about it
and he told me, he said,
representative, he said,
what was it? An
engineer
I would have gotten taken
and money on this
system.
He said, I've heard
them.
I got my ladder out after
the company 11 got my ladder
out with the whole system. And I
saw these flaws and
it took me a long time to get
it back
to fix the system and, and
put it where it should have been
to begin.
So I hear those
things,
one
individuals
that defend the
experience
and I actually, and
wanter
what we're trying to
do and
then, and then the legislative
are we're trying
to do
these grants, these
monies
and, and tax
held
to the
individuals.
But as a person, when I
talk to somebody, an
individual
in my
district,
I raised the caution
by
you better pay attention to the,
we better >> be >> cautious
>> about what we're
doing.
These consumers get importable
things like
this.
>> Yeah. Well, I give it to friends
and because we don't
see
the risk factors
involve these peripheral
tant,
take it back to our
constituents.
But then we finally have to live
to really find
out
what really happens on the
ground.
And it's, it's
scary that we would
take not
only
are stay with our
people and that
reg
>> do we consider
>> Fels you
might it, do we,
we consider this why
this company
oh broke 25 years
ago in the State of New Mexico when we
saved like we at our
peak
or, or in
and they know
how
as a chairman
representative, we're sending
a few, you know, anecdotal
incidents of they're
not companies and
they all want to respond,
you know, that that's fine. We
do do other
people and,
and, and I chair and, and
that might be more of a state
and I think the bio real
problem,
but I think we as
a whole, the
chair,
we ought to look at it
all of the list, all
of factors involved and
everything, all the concerns
with a
Thank you, Mr chair. Thank you for
the presentation.
Thank you, representative. That
charge.
>> Um I think you found,
um I have
so
I can
understand the barriers
that um
we're trying to overcome
with this new legislation.
Um I think it's going
to help a lot
and the resistance
for utility companies
is, you know, should be
expected, you
know,
the,
um
and we need to invest in
utility projects
that are, you know, going
to be outdated and things like
that. So we
need to make sure
that
companies don't go out of
business because of all
these delays and things
like that. I had that in my
own and it
took a year to get all
the things approved
and uh in
our system
online, we still don't
understand uh
how that's working.
Their building
is very
complicated and,
you know, not very easy to
understand what to produce,
but they're charging you.
But, you know, it's like
that. But
um I hope
that we can,
you know, reduce the barriers so
that we can keep solar companies
in business, not have
all delays that
cause them to go about it,
you know, business and not only able
to feel what they
were doing for their uh
uh
oh
purchaser. Um
But my question
is I'll get to the
point, sorry. Um
We did hear
um that
uh electric
vehicles
charging
Athill. Um
There's a way that
they reverse
and have that to
supplement the
um electricity
you shaking your head or
expound on that is that,
that really is
true.
>> Yeah. Yeah, that is an
increasing,
I
really the
first auto manufacturer to lead into
what they call new
charging. And so it allows
for new
electronic, have standard the
battery and then
to essentially integrating alone and
provide that power.
I think that there are opportunities
for, for essentially elect
that. I
think we, from
my mind, I thought
that like
Beber is that the auto
manufacturers have like a
warranty. So if you're
cycling that battery,
well, how do that
feed to have warranty
batteries? Some autom test?
I think that's why you see maybe
you kind of uh
tap in the, do
that about their auto
manufacture. Um
But I think as we continue
forward, as people trying to
get the most value, a
lot of investments making
black such as
electric, you're gonna want
to see that
that
uh electric
battery is perfectly a
power in the moat for
three or four hours. So
we back to those package
will experience
on
investor. And
so I think that's really a great
opportunity to kind of
short up
>> that of
>> that
question.
>> Um Just a
second. I I just want
to say that that's a little bit of
a, we still
uh the
uh some of the
regulations that
the requirements for
being able to backfeed
and prevent certain
conditions from,
from happening. Haven't
been thought out
very well yet. So there
was a bit
hy selling of
something before
this time,
we have investigated
that and there's
not a
solution that we would
we pursue at this
time at
this stage.
But that is cool.
>> Thank you and Mister
Chair. Um I also was
just wondering
um
uh Alicia
mentioned about schools
like that part of
community solar.
Um We try to
pass where they can
um at the state
level of
get special
funding and
opportunity for schools
to
get the solar.
Why or
not AIT
Cells is
that
fund
>> Mr Chair >> representative.
>> So just to clarify,
I wasn't specifically speaking
to solar, I was more
speaking to small
scale solar and storage
projects that covered public
buildings and infrastructure
onno bic society
and municipalities and
counties. Um
But there is a lot
of interest and there are
a lot of projects that exist
on all of those cities and
entities that are saved,
particularly lower,
lower costs
and
like that. And you
know, my understanding and I do keep track
of a lot of federal unmade.
There's been a lot about
that have been me and
federal grants are
really, you know, Andang,
right? And, and
um and so that's one of the
reasons why it is
a accessible
safe line that not only
sort of shri projects but also
development of these projects,
hiring
or other funding is
really difficult
to give the most
can suffer
that through our state.
>> So is the car so
we should keep trying
to get
that
57. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Uh We
have a couple more questions
on the list of people
that question we have join
by
cur uh
chief of staff, New
C who had
traffic issues. I understand
all the way down, Miss
Curry. I wonder,
uh you didn't have the benefit
of listening to the other
analyst presentations.
I wonder if you can cover the, the high
points of your recently
quickly so we can get
back to the question. I have been wrapped a long
time and you're going to
pull that like
right in
front,
>> Mr chair buggers.
Yes, my most sincere apologies
to be LA in plenty of
time and then wound up part of the
highway.
>> So a allies
>> for I have not
heard the rest of the committee
members. So I
apologize if the cover
these, sorry heard.
Um I
here our forthcoming
report to the
legislature on
community Solar. As you
may be aware, we
have the report to the members
that should cover
really the issues and
analysis, we know the
implementation. So
as well as specific items
were requested in the
legislation.
Um and generally you all of
where they are and
so are so
as we, we know or
we have heard
of soler when it was
implemented and it was
present when the legislation
passed test one
pr C set to work
on creating rules
to this program.
And when
the solicitation program
for solar development,
the PR C
400 projects
did into a
program. So in
other words, more than 400
projects were looking to
build Westfield.
The statue setting half over
200 megawatts
CW. The will provide
the A R
those 480
budgets coming for approximately
1.7 gigawatts.
So there was a lot of
decision making that
it done. PR
C uh contacted
with administrator
to run the R
process to, to make the
selections to be
sure
this
basis. Um
We learned a lot of lessons
that as the because the
commission, we can also work
with
our in
2023
2023
45 is
where initially
selected,
move to the next space in the
process. Uh
Over the course of the
last year, we've been working
even harder, has
been working with those projects.
And now that that number
is up to 47.
So what happened with the sporting
V is some of them readjusted
the amount of, but
they allow us that they
were
just to work at
the connection system.
And so that
three,
a lot that we have
to add to the issue
of
that.
Well, as of now, no
project has put
shovels in the ground,
but with a pilot
project, have any
program,
discover base of
the that, you know, and
how they diligently working
through those processes and
those items
solvings
to make sure that the
way set
on forward
uh cla
have a strong interest
in film developers but
we ways that just
one that fashion
super sign, you
can't know that that
is a bad no
projects are in the
ground projects. I
guess
one of the things that we
several
of
part of the uh the
costs for the
connection. So the cost
that it was uh say to
build the project and then put
it onto the the
upgrade grid, build
a small region and work from
about $280,000
for one fund that
all
the
question of,
of those require and where they
are and the best, right?
So that's certainly one
challenge that we're facing
that we're trying to work through their
utilities,
our
projects,
another problem that we're seeing just
across the board, not
just to, but in general
is supply to that
is also leads to some
unexpected delays. This
is something that I'm sure you
heard lost about
very lost about it today.
Screen. Uh
So it is something that we
are struggling. And
then last week, we
have had a
like
the ps
regard
the administrative side of the
the program. So
Bill credits Sohe
has tariffs some of
those binary details
of what the program and
would as it
goes from the subscriber
organization
subordinate to
the consumer, how those
processes the
commission is currently
considering that those issues
that RLO and has
better
and to
the professional
and
be
we do have on the good,
on the good news side of things,
we have a lot of projects that
have signed their connect agreements
with their utilities.
So 47 project
select, a lot of them rather
have a
so of getting
uh with
the of how they going to,
right,
there have been some challenges
in SPS territory
with how, how does this work in
the regional market.
And I believe um
just this
or last I heard on
that and I think that we're
those she
also in
those projects are
also
right.
So we're really
hopeful that soon, we will
have a resolutions
that will allow us to gauge
customer interest in this
program. We're really
hopeful that soon.
Um We will be
able to talk
about the next phase of
the community Solar program
in at the beginning of October,
the commission raised the
cap from
200 megawatts to 300
megawatts. Now that will
require another brown
of that went
by short frame, but
we did raise that cap.
And then the last piece that I have
today is trying to be my full
time is
that we
are
a issue
at the end of this, this whole
year, the funding
runs and help at
the end of fy 25
our requests
for Fy 26
does even to stop
now position
$700,000
on the one.
So as to accommodate the
defense round of solar
selection, that's
where we need to. And if
that's not where we wind up going
based on just
that. So I
I
administration
program
um and that I would
have to stand for
questions.
>> Thank you for that
question, Mr mcminn Center or
Smalls.
>> Um The
action for some of you were not
around
>> all
but
your face.
>> Yeah,
and I know about the
court.
I'll do my best. Uh
So we need to learn act
as 2021 you
know, for the new
members that bill was
in front of our committee for
two years before that
repeatedly.
And um
I heard it and work on it
quite a bit and the Senate comes,
wait, it
was a 20 page bill.
Uh Most of it was
entirely amended repeatedly
in JD and others were on
their of the around for the pain of
all of that. There were very long
meetings.
The bill was essentially
rewritten many times
in the Z conservation week before
it was finally passing. Uh
And I worked on it really hard. It
was a really good
gene and,
and I wanted you to have that history because
when I look at
the presentations, I think we
got others.
There's references to working
with stakeholders
and I look at all the stakeholders
listen and,
and their life here in the
industrial utilities
and, and that your
presentation. And
I want you, I just want you all to
know that when I grew
up the bill in
middle school,
the investor
of the day and very
much involved. I, I mean, I,
on a lot for
information they didn't
like
very, but I put
into it
and they didn't, that's
often that's the case
with anybody because I work with, on
any, not they like
you but, but their
input is session. I, I don't
see any weird mountain. So I
do o because when I'm looking at
presentation, I'm looking at the
panel here today.
I don't see P and M here today.
I don't see a pass
here today
and very,
very candidly back
at that time and the time we were working on
a little years before
when it did pass. Um
and we held it up and
it a couple times
with sponsors.
Um, very candidly,
the convenor utilities were much
more engaged in the
list that process and surrounded
team and surrounded
people involved. And we
would spend hours, we were gonna get
ETA as we
go and again here for the
eta eta that in two
years when we sell
your in at hours
and M buy by
line, we're done the ETA.
And so there
was an engagement by the investor
utilities would have.
Uh And, and that was essentially
the passing of the bill. I hope
you all will know that history
and you will
involve all
stakeholders, not
just the ones
who perhaps
can choose to. All because
candidly, all that will
happen is you'll
bring your bill and
you'll see me again.
Uh I
for, for better or worse, I don't
have a voted next
week's election. So with
the great of that, I'll be around a bit
longer and I just want to
let you know that, that I'll
be read out to everybody on,
on a piece of
legislation. You, you
gotta have, you gotta have
the, the private sector or
invest sector involve
this process. I'm not very
received.
>> So thank you for
that next
on the list. And
I'll take this opportunity to
touch on some of your
comments.
Uh He was
asked to be on this panel
and several others
and they declined.
Um So it's
frustrating
to me when we're seeing
here and they're
declining to be
engaged
>> everybody down and
sorry. Thank you.
The one thing
that that's always the same. We
were glad you point out
and really it simply,
but I said a moment ago, you
used to be my,
well,
they used to bring to the table
and they told
they don't show up.
So it just makes
article hard.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Senator
and I'm the
solar villa.
Uh It was
around the longer two
years and
earlier version started of the
house that I can
remember reach out to
the units
on, on that middle and saying,
you know, we're open to work
on this. What changes
do you want?
And uh I was told,
well, let me chat,
got back to me about a day later
and said, yeah, we just
found,
they make changes basically
and they were able to buzz it
and they were able to kill it.
That, uh,
that is fine.
But of course it keeps
that. So,
um, Senator, I, I agree with
you. I won't make the ball
but they got, be
willing to come to the
table.
Um, I
do have a question, uh,
Scurry, uh,
uh, you said
earlier and red
zones. And one of
my question is one of the reasons I wanted to
t
they are charging people
$2500
just to consider a solar
installation or
battery installation, the
so called yellow.
And I
do, they set up their own
dreams. And I mean, it
seems
punitive to me
that much money. If they've
already designated an area
of the yellow zone, it would seem to
me that they
have some information about it
and they need
to re invent the wheel if someone
wants to hook up interop solar
or a battery.
And so why are they charging so
much money? Uh Not
refundable? The answer
may be no, so
I
does to you and
yourself,
>> Mr Chair, I'm going to have
to admit, but I don't
know, red zones and
yellow zones. Well,
no red zones and yellow zone, but I don't
know who he's associate in those.
So I can check
the here all day so
I can check and get back to. I will
say that the traditional
mode of utility
regulation and how costs
were is
causation, dryest cost.
So if you
have
circuit neighborhood,
whatever uh
all uss who want
to come up to that neighborhood
until there's no more room
and then when there's no more
room, the next person
who wants
to,
the one is all over
the next. So
that is just a
general principle
that we're grappling with
DC. I can check on
your specific I in
that.
>> Yeah, I would appreciate that because it's
not exactly the,
the
situation which
which we also touched
on
that and then we're gonna wrap with them as big
as it stands
of my last comment.
Uh The sha
uh I think I talked to
you about
in terms of local solar
access and eligible
entities. Uh
So it's,
it's a
list
I would first and
foremost uh bring
good adding land
grant uh
to that list, land grants are
local subdivisions,
state, just like
that, counting
they should be eligible
and I consider
add soil water
cons. Um
I think they would be good
entities. Uh
You might be interested in this time
program electrifying
their offices
also.
So you have sort of a, a
short list of
subdivisions.
Uh There
is, there may be others that
would be interested,
but
>> yes, Mr Chair very briefly.
Um >> you know, when we
originally developed this
policy, we
included every NM
fa eligible entity.
And throughout the development of
the policy, we extensively
consultant and
M MA about how
this could work best. And the
feedback that we've got from an M
FA is that
limiting the
entities
to get communities
and entities that have similar types
of channel systems, similar
sizes that
most and
would position this
to be the most
effective tical
fund. We will certainly
discuss and day and
this fact, but we have
actually not that
these of those entities continue
to do so. But the reason that we narrowed
it before was these
factors.
>> And that's why
uh
uh as someone
who is that
a 10 years ever
beauties, they are
all left out.
Uh And there are
other legislators
and she myself,
we fight for them to
be with because
they should
be.
>> I
>> so thank you all for
your presentation. It's great. Thank
you for joining us. I know you're on the
traditional panel. So your
trip is not gonna be
and we move to Mexico. Thank
you
of horror.
Represent ca
like
the
>> representative.
But I
think
that is the
historical
problem because
I think
about
it maybe not.
And all of
the
>> thank you for joining us, representative
uh members of the
panel. These are the
Malema.
So our next panel is
like transmission development,
the raising issues.
Uh The first that we
have
lost the
director uh
Redi
all
>> test the test, you know
me.
>> Yeah, and you just want to move
it over. So it's in front of you
so you can turn your head
in one way or the other, you use
it. So that's
good.
>> Thank you, Chairman
Hui members. My
name is I'm executive
director of the
Mexico
has already you're
very short informa
that we because it's quite
mouth.
Um I've been the
executive writer since
July 1 this year. Prior
to that, I was on read
General Council for about eight
years. I
appreciate very much the opportunity
to present on
read in this community
today. Um Some
of you are very familiar with Greta,
some of you new
members, maybe not so much. So
I tried to
give you some background, all that
some
light
point. There's a lot of
information.
Um Rita was founded
by statute in
2007 during the
Richardson administration.
Um We are an authority,
a quasi governmental.
We have the board, it's appointed
three members by the governor,
one by the Senator
Town, one by the speaker of the house
and then the treasurer
and the secretary of man. He
was at
work
um next
light
station.
So we were created
to solve a problem is 1/4
time with two of a handout.
Um
New Mexico's grid
is largely unchanged
and by grid, I'm talking about
the voltage
transmitting grid model distribution
system. So the
the larger I voltage
lines that
large amounts of power
generate
human distribution system
and the grid
was designed for
um traditional
hydrocarbon generated boat
lands. Uh gas
plants.
Um
and it
predominantly
um I'm gonna take
banking. Um
uh Most of New Mexico
is in a very small part
in the southeastern border as
part of the SPP
regional Transmission
Organization.
Um And you
know, um
comparing demand come on
top of the age
with the mouse on the
bottom of the page, the grid
system does not
line up well with
the renewable resources that New
Mexico has become. When
solder those best
resources are in
lows
population areas
where there is not good
transmission to
those resources on
to the transmission system.
Hence the creation of rent to
try to help
out the development of transmission to
reach those
resources.
Um
Oh, all a
couple.
Um So
the way that we we to
assist with the
development of
some statutory
tools
tax in incentives,
if we are in the right kind
of relationship with a developer,
the the project
saves on property tax,
first rece tax and common
tax. In addition,
we can assist with
citing and
that means the power of eminent
domain and
also on some of
the pervers,
we also have the ability to do
bond financing.
Um And
as I said, we have various
levels of
project relationships.
The lowest level is
a letter
of support all the way up to
a an act with
the
agreement.
Five years ago, we
were one
lease and that was the
Western Speir project.
That's our, our one project that
we have in commercial
operation as of
2021.
Um Today, we have
five these agreements
um and I'll go through those projects
in a little bit of detail.
Uh So as you can
see working on
getting about
11,000
megawatts of more
renewable capacity on the
grid with our
lives
Western Spirit which
is
tinted on the man who taught
with the next page on page
five
said
the largest upgrade is the PNM
transmission system since the
mid eighties. It's
about 100 and 50 mile
wide. Um
It is
servicing
800 new megawatts of
wind developed near the
Corona area.
Um This
line, uh after
we got a in commercial
operation was
purchased by Can out
and
um with
no cost
impact on
repairers,
the the lion is completely
paid for by
fees and fees
paid like wind farms,
ultimately born by
ratepayers
who are paying for the power in
California.
Sania has been in
element for about 15
years and
is currently in construction and
since uh
Barnard here is from
uh here for pattern, he's gonna
really a little bit more on
what
period
Rio's soul
is used
to be the companion
lines, some
two lines with
the high voltage DC
Lion and, and behind
AC L.
And a
couple years ago, we had her
purchase L one
which is the Sun Lion,
the DC Lion. We're
very excited about how we
developing. It's an
AC L
and because
of that, it will have
quite a number of
interconnection points within
New Mexico.
And because of that,
we are
um
optimistic
that the wind that
is gonna be serviced
on the Rio O
line will be purchased
in New Mexico and used in New
Mexico.
And our other projects,
the North Path Line
is a very large
DC line
uh that
will
uh began in Union County
in the northeast corner of the
state and
move from 400,000
megawatts of land
wind development power
um across the
state to the four corners
uh that the line is in the
early stages of
development. Um
I would say probably where
sun was
about 10 years ago.
Um Smaller
lines been in development for a
while is the moral
line.
And that's
being developed
by a
corridor LLC.
And that's all located
in the northeastern
corner of the
state. And
then finally, our last
uh and project
is prosperous
of roadrunner
while this is Rita's
first project in
the Eastern
Interconnect. And that's
designed
to
um increase both
reliability and and
economics for
that part of the
SP
system.
And then slide
15 shows
the almost
$30 billion those
lines plus the
renewables, those
enabled
in total
infrastructure investment in
New
Mexico.
And then finally, we got a couple
pictures of crime
so we can get you in
structure.
Um Just
reminders of the committee
previous, even though it's
not in our name, we're able
to do what we do
for transmission for
largest deal renewable
energy storage, the project.
And we're actively working
on identifying
good search projects
to uh
start to that, that
statues.
That's all I have for today. I
can read a
I stand questions, I guess
the
>> thank you for that. Uh Next time we
have
burners
>> uh
chairman uh
adversely getting blue
for chairman may be
said better.
Uh The committee,
thank you for the opportunity to
be here today. My name is
Partners of the record
government affairs in the United
States for patting my energy
um pattern
is pretty happy to be able
to empower what we think
is a pretty strong track record and
development that you in state.
As as noted, we're
under construction with this
project. But first
line here is just a, a quick
overview of the investment
we've already made. Um
We kind of think
of
we work with
>> that.
Uh
We're gonna take a brief recess
and deal with
this
or maybe
done.
>> Was it something I
said?
>> Ok, so it seems to have been
turned off. Let's just proceed
and we'll check on the stas
that great.
>> Thank you. Um
So we, we got think
of three phases that we've
been working and we
had our, our first phase
with this broadly Grady
broads
which were uh wind
development. So you can
see four
and 320
megawatts of wind and
that information there in the
capital investment. So
with that power
out,
um that was
kind of the, the first for
a, of the state of the best
public
projects
online
uh found in 2017
and 2019. The
background and was,
it was the, the Western
Spirit Project.
Uh that was a pretty
heavy step up at the
time, that was the largest
single phase project
built with the United
States
that track records.
We had moved
into a transmission line. It
wasn't the first transmission line
that pattern Bellow and,
and Bill.
Um
but we're proud of that
work um
that they put it back and
system
stay in Mexico. And now we've
taken line. Um
we required ownership of
this transmission
line and we've been doing the
development of the
um for those who are
with it, it's the
largeness uh
by, by underestimation
its largest renewable energy
project in the history of the western
hemisphere under
construction today.
See, it's a little
over 3500
megawatts
of uh wind
generation and so
that best
transmission together about
$100 million.
And of course, what we're talking about here today
is transmission line development
building a 550
miles of transmission
uh
uh starting in
the growing area
and
uh stop
all. And
the area
and Arizona
started to show up a little bit
here
um
all for that, but
it just kind of highlights
um the,
the
uh the statistics on
the project. So
the way side of the project
is a phases
is 3500
megawatts of nuclear
energy. Uh
That is another power
for about 3 million
Ws and
the stadium, Mexico has
about 2.1
million residents.
So clearly, this is a
broad track of the
entertains the state of
Mexico and as part
of an effort
to developing
resources for the
Empire in the last
office, look at
Dearmon Ander of Western
Britain. Uh
We're at the full mobilization
and construction right now and
we are right, just under about
2000 both storing on a
ro um We're
happy to say that we're
uh we halfway through
with the construction,
we
trapped, we
planning energized
and with that RME,
um we had a short video
on it to
play that or
pick up the
best
like those bladder.
Let's,
we're getting the audio on
it. We've got
very um
just so
showing that.
So construction groups
that work on it,
um
um audios and
white, all
that.
Uh This is showing some of the
supply chain. We've got
uh 907
hours going
up. All right, is
going up.
Um As you can see in
this, a lot of the construction
on the transmission as
we're going through the
vars, the construction
drop by, by
helicopter
in the,
that
um uh we're
trying to minimize footprint
as, as much as
possible as we look at
the end of this
project.
Um
We RR it a couple of
different times,
um
voice set of areas,
the best
range. Um We
tried to go uh
with uh other
existing infrastructure
said possible.
As I said, we've got
a project under
construction and
um it'll be
online and so
they have some picture to
turn the ch as
it out. Uh
One of the things I think just worth
noting is the
importance of that the
plan. So I presentation
of this, the quality of the
land that
is really
uh and be similar
to the follow source
based
and
important.
Why
when resource in the mare
about?
And
um as we look
at on the
internet that has been developed in the desert
Southwest and
that of course generates
power, aware of the shing.
And what we see is that New Mexico
land is complement
to solar resources tends
to produce uh during
peak times of energy needs.
Um It produces at
night, it produces in that
all the time.
Um So as we look at how
decarbonization of the grid
having Mexico land,
the train
emission to get it to
bar. Um
We think is
a, a tremendously
important
car as wide.
So like losings
on a little bit of that.
So uh
Sunia
wins is about
3 3500
megawatts of gain
like past in terms of
actual power out,
it's going to be about three times the
power out
with.
Um which is
we say
that
unfortunately, uh
just for the state of
California, if they be
organized, they estimate
they need about 100 and 80
kilowatts of,
of new uh
a new generation city
California. By some
studies, Westw
decarbonize the
entire west of the United
States. It's about
300 gigawatts
uh so
3.5
megawatts. So as we look
around the last, in terms of
project, we're very proud of
what we
think. It's all part of what we need
to do for our,
we all think that this, this place
is that other
resources and we think this
is that what we
need to do last, why?
And here
in that, that would be
containing the best
they have.
And
thank you for that. We
please.
OK.
>> OK.
That, that's
better.
Thank you, chairman and respect
committee. My name is so
I am the regionalized
president of
right,
uh for SLM
RT Texas and New
Mexico. I
am a proud Mexican
born and raised in Santa Fe. I'm
happy to be able to
work out of my
hometown
center. I'm going to apologize
ahead of time. I'm on two panels
and I, I don't board
you. I think, you know,
the uh which panels
wiped them first. So I have to
run through a new splice
to get into the, the slide of this
panel. But I promise you
you'll see the other slides
coming up
here
before I do that.
I'll let you know a little bit
about Acel Energy
and the operating company I
am the owner of for
the
Cell Energy is an
electric and natural
gas utility
provider um
across the states in
the Midwest and in
Colorado, Texas and
Mexico. I work with a
Southwester public service
company and we are an
electric only
service provider
in the Southeast New Mexico
and across the plains
and panic at
the
in New Mexico where
crowds serve approximately
126,000
customers across
16 communities.
South New Mexico.
We serve primarily
the, the Permian
Basin. Um
In southeastern Mexico,
there's a little bit of data for
you on the slide in terms of our
operations
um in the
state,
our operating in
the state, most of our
sales uh over
50%
go to a
commercial and
industrial load,
primarily the oil and
gas industry and the Peran
Basin.
Um In
New Mexico,
we are seeing tremendous
lo growth as sales continue
to grow in that region
and in the and
have specifically it
has. I'll talk about a little
bit. Those
are uh quickly
becoming two
cabinet we
c in the nation and gas
production. See a lot
of that service that we
grow in those
cabs. Specifically,
we're proud to serve
uh the industry in
Mexico that has so
much.
And I'll get to this in a
little bit. But just
while we're doing this, we're
also um
increasing the renewable energy
on our system. Uh
last year,
37%
of our electricity.
This was renewable
energy and we
are,
we are
going to be surveying
approximately
84% by
2030. Uh
Wait for your
OK. So I'm gonna
just you these
live
lio.
So what's
important about
SP and the reason
I, I was
asked to join this panel
today was
PS is a member of the
Southwester Power
of Regional Transmission
Organization
um that
serves Easter
or that encompasses
the Eastern and Southwester
part of the
um we
as a member of the South
Western Power Bowler as
a
uh
we are
the southernmost
utility and service
territory in
that regional transmission
organization.
It requires
tremendous transmission
to bring um
electrodes down
into our service territory.
We are not connected.
Our system is not connected
to the European
system. I think that's a,
we just as kind
of a foundational
uh foundational
purposes for this,
for this presentation.
So 10 years ago,
uh this is what our
transmission system
looked like. No, uh
365 lines,
primarily, uh lower
voltage transmission
lines. Um But
we have seen tremendous
growth in this area of
the city over the past
day. And that
is primarily due to
oil and gas growth
in the. Um, we
have the second largest
US producer and that's
behind Texas.
Um 60%
it represents 60% of the
US production and
5% of us
daily produce.
Um And as I
noted before, we in
townies are becoming the
lowest producing on
gas comes
in which
um this has
led to a
increased load or
less. So, getting increased
request to
connect
um
connect load to our
system, this
is represents
expansion of
those across but also
electus of those
processes. So as we're
able to meet that,
we grown in our service territory.
We're proud to say that we're
to administrative
reductions across
that industry
and this is 10 years later,
you can see that
um we
have done significant
build out in the
disservice territory
over the past decade,
adding 305
K, excuse me,
345 K
lines to
bring in those
electrons uh
to Southeastern New
Mexico.
However,
we still are
transmission and
distribution
stranded
in this area of the States.
You'll see the area of
CERN here
shaded and
green.
Um
In 2002
and 2000, excuse me,
2022 and
23 alone,
um SPS had
2500
melos of new load
requested just in
this area.
Um I'll go through a
timeline in a little bit
but load
request and the piece
of load work in our service
territory are far out of
leasing our
ability to, to
build out that transmission
system needed to
support it.
Um
Right now, uh
you heard about the
crossbar costs. Roadrunner
Line, we build in
partnership with Rita
in the service territory and
I believe it's Rita and Sarah
are building that line or
highly dependent
on a 2026
and service made of that line
to unlock additional loads
in our service territory.
And here you go, this
is the ground representation
of the low growth process
ps starting in
2019.
And you can see in
2022
we had a
large
job in load
request, the pace
and the volume of load
request for
our service territory.
So
in order to build out the transmission
system to do the planning
when the Southwest power
and to go through our regulatory
processes to build out
of that transmission system,
it takes time and I'll
and I'll walk you through that
now.
Oh, and unfortunately,
this is an animated slide
and it's easier when it's animated
for me to walk through it because
it looks very busy right
now. Um
But because
it's not animated on the
PM, I'll just walk you through
it now. So if
you start at the
beginning of that
time,
uh it shows
you that in
uh
in 2023
SPS began
an IRP
process one year
early p but
recognized that we
needed to unload
the load in our service serve
to build generation
and transmission to be the
lo growth and that
we had a timing issue.
Um So we requested from the
commission and the commission
authorized us to file
an integrated resource
plan a year
early. We
used the summer load
forecast uh
from that summer
2023
in the IRP which
was filed in
October
of 2023. I
will tell you more about that
IRP process on
the next b that I'm on.
It's really interesting. Um
And the facility
is able to process especially
is something that we're proud of.
That process is still
ongoing with the request
for proposals
out now for new
decoration resources.
So the IRP used
the 2023 lobe
forecast in its
IRP in the
IRP for the
model purposes.
Um The next summer
in 2024 this
summer, we uploaded, we
updated that
forecast and
we issued an RFP
um in July.
Uh that RP
used the updated
load forecast for
for the request we
proposals
this month, the
SPP
is going through its
integrated transmission
um process.
So it is
improving a
slate of
transmission
projects that
will bring reliability
and economic
benefits to a
across the entire
world. That
study
that that those
projects that the SPP
will will
improve is based
on the forecast
studies. So these
the load that we told them
are requested to join
our system connect to our
system from summer of
2023. So
it's a year and a half later that they
are approving
transmission progress that will
bring transmission
the areas along
flow. So
bids are due beginning
of January in our
IRP and we are set
to file CC
for those generation
projects in mid
2025.
Uh The need in the
I key starts
in 2025. So I'll
show you a list of transmission
projects, but we're
seeing a list
of the transmission
projects um
being approved by the pool
this month with an
as early as the April
2025
date.
So
we are set to
file our like I said,
our CN more
resource approvals in next
year. That
timeline in uh in India
is designed
in 15 months for resource
approval and
we expect to bring resources
on from 2028 to
2030 in
2020.
Um
In 2026 we
expect to have that
roster cost Roadrunner
Barn. Yeah,
in, but we were
still going to be building
out, going through
regulatory approvals
and construction for the
transmitted needed
in this year's item.
This is an annual process.
So every year they're
going to be approving and will
be approving
transmission projects based
on load studies received
in their earlier.
So the bottom
line is load
growth is significantly out
racing SPP item
process XP
and build out process.
Um
PP I could be 10
year reliability models
also only consider
resources that have been approved.
So the IRP
process that I walked you
through our integrated resource
plan, none
of those resources being
brought forward into that plan
will be considered by the
SPP and their
processes until we
see the permission
approvals
and location matters,
especially right now for
SPS. As
we saw
in this map, we
have a resource but
we have a constrained
area in service
territory. So
the resources
that are loaded
close to this load pocket
will be able to unlock
more load and bring more
reliability
to that area.
And finally, we're seeing
unprecedented
unprecedented supply
chain and workforce
uh workforce
competition. It's not
only in the utility
industry across the United
States that it is needing to
build out its
transfiction
and generate systems to
be growing and
electrify electrification
load. Um
We're seeing competition
from the oil and gas
industry that we serve
where we these projects
and from data center.
Uh Well, that
is also built in these
projects as well. I think a good
example of that is
Microsoft's recent
partnership with cost
energy to reopen
unit two a three mile island,
that's one off
of that. Microsoft
is signed a
G 20 years to
take all the energy coming
out of the uh unit
three island, a billion
dollar invests that they're
doing. So
there's lots of competition
to do this at all about
um lots of workforce
and supply chain and
where we deal with some
challenging guidelines, just maybe
part of a
power. Now, I do
want to say there's a lot of benefits
that we to be part of the
pool. Um
Are our customers
benefit from
sharing costs with the rest
of the pool. So as we're building on
this transmission line, there are
now the ones that
are paid for the costs
are allocated
possible
you'll see in the upcoming
it, many
projects are coming to
Southwester public service
companies, Cies, Texas
and Circus
Territory. Um
One that we're particularly
excited about is
765
0 Crossroads, Phantom.
It's 765
KD line. This will be the
1st 765
baby line in the
pool. And certainly
um in our service
territory, this will
unlock um
a lot of when
constraint that we're
experiencing
in uh in
the CS territory, the
need is shown pretty
immediately. This will
likely have been service date
at the end of the
decade.
And here I also provided
you a list of the 2024
I transmission projects
that will be coming to
the services
territory.
And lastly, what are we
doing to
address the, the
capacity of
our, of our, we're
working with the SPP
to start completing these
studies on a more
expedited uh
on time
including
pro uh a low
we study participants
that we do what we
can process.
Um I think
also importantly,
the 2024 generation
and RB, which I talking
about on the next
should be able to help us with
the
strength, a position that
we're in today depending
on what those Americans
we're working with our
customers and
enuring our customers to
align their advocacy
with us at ES PE
and in New Mexico so that
we can get good solutions
to unlock this
constraint.
Um And
finally, we are
going to be creative and investigating
other solutions,
um you know,
short term and long term
as well and I'll stand
your question.
Thank you. And our last
it was on this panel,
be Mendez
should be.
Are you with us? >> Yes,
I am with you. Um
But it's saying that it's
not allowing me to
turn on my
video
so >> you >> can start video
because the host has stopped it,
but I can just continue if you all
prefer.
>> Go ahead and we'll work on the
video while.
>> Great. Ok, give me one second.
Let me share my
screen.
I just sent a request for the
screen
>> share,
>> Sarah. I'm sorry. It's saying that it's not
allowing me to um share
the presentation
they're working on it.
OK.
Let's
see.
There we
go.
All right, you should all be seeing my
screen now. It's
good to go.
Yes, great.
Well, thank you. All. Good morning, Chair
mcqueen and members of the committee.
My name is Verna Mandes and I
am the transmission possible
campaign director at Advanced
Energy United. I'm sorry,
I couldn't be there with you in person
today, but thank you so much
for accommodating
some virtual
participation.
All right. So I want to
start by talking about um who
advanced Energy United is
Advanced Energy United is
a national trade association
with over 100 members in
the clean energy space.
We work on federal, regional
and state advocacy.
We have a team in the West and
some of you may be familiar with our
New Mexico state lead Michael
Barrio who works on a host of
energy issues in the state of New
Mexico. I specifically
live a few states over in Nevada
and I work on our transmission
program where I launched an
effort called transmission
possible
transmission possible is a
program created to educate
decision-makers about the
new, about the need for new
and improved transmission,
build support for transmission
policies included grid
enhancing technologies and
advanced conductors and
engage with local stakeholders
about the need for transmission
in their state and region.
So the reason I preface this is
because the work that I
do is very
much in the broader
transmission context of being
able to connect state decision
maker with policy
experts on a host of
transmission related
issues. Today,
I'm going to talk specifically about
advanced conductors
though I don't consider myself an
expert on advanced conductors
or transmission. You have many
experts in the room with you. Today,
we do work with a network of
experts that would be happy to
answer any technical questions
or facilitate a deeper
conversation on some of these
technologies. But again,
today, I want to make sure to give
you all a brief overview of
advanced conductors
and the pros and cons of using
them on the transmission
system.
All right. So before I get
into advanced conductors, I
wanted to flag a term that
some of you may have heard
before called
advanced transmission
technologies.
Advanced transmission
technologies are
infrastructure which is hardware
or software that can
cost effectively increase
the capacity and resilience
of the transmission grid.
But they're not yet the
default solution considered
by most us transmission
owners. They
include a term you all may have
heard before called grid enhancing
technologies
gets which means
hardware or software
technology that reduces
congestion or enhances
the flexibility of the electrical
system and distribution
system by increasing
the capacity of the line
or rerouting
electricity from overload
to uncongested lines
while maintaining industry
safety standards.
There's also high performance
conductors also known as
advanced conductors. Sometimes
you'll hear both of those terms
used interchangeably,
they encompass modern conductor
technology which have
greater performance characteristics
when compared to the traditional
aluminum conductor steel
reinforced A CS
R conductors. Uh
This includes increasing
uh capacity, higher
efficiency and less
thermal sag. And then I also
wanted to log that there is a
host of other
advanced transmission
technologies namely
storage as transmission
is one that is widely
known.
Now, advanced transmission
technologies have risen to
popularity in recent
years because there's a broad
recognition that we need to
urgently address the need for new
transmission
infrastructure,
not only to interconnect new
energy generating resources,
but also to make sure that we
have a reliable
and resilient electric
system, which is pretty
outdated across the country
and fragmented across the
west. But there are many
benefits to advanced transmission
technologies. They can
cost effectively expand
transmission system and distribution
system capacity.
They can enhance system
reliability and resilience
support the integration of
utility scale and
distributed clean energy
sources. The
great thing is most of these solutions
can be deployed on the existing
grid in under 3 to 5
years at a lower cost
and at a greater value
than conventional approaches.
But the barriers
are namely that adoption
at scale is associated
to industry know how and that's
largely lacking due to
lack of industry incentives,
prioritization and
overall just unfamiliarity
with the technologies.
So those are advanced
transmission technologies. But
as I mentioned today, I was asked
specifically to talk about high
performance conductors
or advanced conductors.
So I wanted to make sure to
start with exactly
what an advanced conductor
is. Uh in the
next two slides, you will
see images uh
examples that I grabbed from
a playbook created by
the American Council on
Renewable Energy linked
to the right and also provided in the
PDF format of this
slide. Um I really
encourage you all to look at that because these
are good examples of what
a high performance conductor
is
for 100 years. Power
lines have used aluminum
conductor steel reinforce.
I mentioned that earlier, a CS
R conductors which
are still the default conductor
choice. Basically, the
electricity flows through the
aluminum and heats the line
over time because
of resistance to the metal,
the steel core keeps the line
strong but with enough heat,
the line will soften and start
to sag. This
affects, this limits
the amount of electricity that the line
can safely
transmit.
So there are two main
types of high performance
conductors. We
have com carbon
and composite core conductors.
These have a stronger lighter
weight core which allows more
aluminum to be added to the
conductor, doubling the
capacity and
they are about 20% more
efficient and have half
as much thermal
stack.
There's also superconductors,
superconductors
increase the capacity
5 to 10 times at
lower voltage, reduce
substation build and
cost. They have
no thermal sag and
lines A does not vary
with ambient weather conditions or
exposure to the elements and
they are at least 50%
more efficient than
traditional
conductors.
Now, it's important
to know that transmission lines
need to be replaced over time
for several reasons including
the age of the line or
changes to the use
of the line itself to address
things like what we're seeing now, which
is low growth. But
the most common need for a
replacement is the wear and
tear and the expected
useful lifespan of a
conductor is about 50
to 70 years.
But reconduct and rebuilding
transmission lines are a common
part of utility operations
and maintenance practices.
However, under status
quo, many lines are
reconduct with the
same type of conductor
previously used on the line.
So this is essentially a like
for like replacement, which
misses out on the additional benefits
that high performance conductors
can provide
advanced free conductor uses
the same process that I just
described. But instead of a
like for like replacement,
the existing transmission line
is replaced with a high
performance conductor
using the existing
right of way and the existing
transmission
tower.
Lastly, I want to close
with the benefits of advanced rec
conductor, the
value of time saving and other
benefits such as the reduction
of congestion, lower
generation curtailment and
faster interconnection.
Um to the grid are
significant values
but they're not often considered
in the current decision making
framework.
Reconduct takes about
1 to 3 years and
can double the capacity of
the transmission line at
approximately half the cost
of a new line
maximizing the use of
high-performance conductors. In
recondo can add about
four times the transmission
capacity when compared
to the current rate of new transmission
development. I
also wanted to point you all to
a study called Connected
West which is a 20 year
transmission planning study
aimed at forecasting
long-range transmission
infrastructure needs in the
western grid.
It's a very long study but
mainly the results indicate
that a significant portion of new
transmission capacity
across the West can
be met with reconduct
upgrades, co locating
new lines and advanced
transmission technologies such
as high capacity
conductors. Um in
some portfolios reconduct
projects and co locating new
lines accounted for about
85% of the
required line miles
in this study.
I also wanted to close
just by making it extremely
clear that
though advanced transmission
technologies are a great
solution, this
does not mean that we do not need
more transmission, we need
more transmission period.
In addition to
getting more out of the
existing infrastructure,
we're not going to high performance
conductor our way out of
the need for building new
transmission. But it is
important to consider what
advanced transmission technologies
can do to current
and new infrastructure,
high performance conductors have
consistently delivered benefits
including high transfer
capacity, line loss
savings, improved reliability
and structural savings.
And this far exceeds
their upfront cost premium
in thousands of
projects.
And given that the widely
recognized need to broadly
increase transmission
transfer capacity and efficiency
to serve rapidly growing electric
demand and connect new, cheap
and abundant clean energy resources.
We really do encourage planners
to maximize the capacity
in every transmission upgrade
they can via
inexpensive incremental
investments like high-performance
conductors, especially
when we consider that these projects
are expected to remain in service
for 30 years or more.
So that's all for me. Like I
mentioned, this was a pretty quick
overview of exactly
what advanced conductors are
and advanced transmission
technologies. Happy
to answer any questions that you
all may have, but if anything gets
too technical, I'm also again, happy
to connect any members of this
committee to um
other experts that have been
working on these technologies
for years. Thank you so
much.
>> Thank you for that. We're gonna go to the
question committee. Um
I am trying to get us back on
schedule on
this panel. Uh We
have three people on the list
so far that keep your
questions for you. I appreciate
it and I keep your
answers.
Uh Representative
Laura,
>> thank you. So >> I'd like to
start with Patter
um Mr Steve and I
hear you're the senior director of
legislative and regulatory and,
and if you want to share
a
>> but no, I think
I live in for word.
>> Thank you.
I imagine that may
not have seen the commercials.
We all under the last
in which one of
our us, Senator
Heidrich books
to have lots of drone
footage potentially
of the. But there's
line it
term is moving their. So
there's about everything's happening
in
and Senator
Heinrich uses
language to be
um sounds
almost like you're harking back to
Manifest Destiny if
I remember. Well, iit enough, I
should have. He said something
like that thought it was
possible, but I push
it through talking
about its
largest renewable
project that it's the
largest project in Western
Nemesis and largest so
project the
fires.
Um Do
you uh
Mrs
I'd like to hear or
with more about what
it mean to engage
with sovereign nations in this
process? And
do you know how
many sovereign nations
opposed this?
Why
we might still in
the
>> uh, Mr
Chair, I,
uh,
I don't have an answer in
terms of
specific
question in terms of number.
Um, I'm happy
to give that to you. Uh, we've
done a pretty
extensive outreach,
uh, to. So,
um,
I think just, I, I
have had the opportunity to
that, that
ad, um, a
little, uh,
again, it's different
ads. My, but,
um,
I,
I think that,
um,
uh, just
the phrase
manifest
and,
uh,
that's not our
intent. Um
We a driveway
whisper and it's very
serious.
Um We've done a lot
of engagement through the, the
process through the
federal
federal process for need,
require government
department and
that requires
nation consultation. We're not
a sovereign so we
can do that process.
It's a consultation process
exist in sore
Nation so that tribal
governments spec sore
tribal uh
respect tribal sovereignty,
spec tribal leadership.
Um And we
uh encourage the
federal seeks to
be,
to be for right in that,
in that room. Uh We have
had uh litigation on the
line that I think,
you know, you referencing,
uh specifically addressing
concerns the San Pedro
Vow in Arizona.
Uh The
concern expressed
was that,
um came in
very late the constipation
process. I
uh that line was agree you in
2015. And
as we start, construct
concern is raise that
our view had
not been raise earlier in the
process to see
I the San
Out and
uh uh
uh resource
the entire of the valley.
Um in that valley,
there are existing above
ground oil pipelines
that will be around there,
existing transmission
lines section left in the post
article about the
um the tropical
service. And if you look at
the photograph off post
article in the fore
ground it or we
working on our construction
and the background is distinct
as much.
Iit
I say we disagree with some
characterizations that first
that existing infrastructure
we're trying to work on
along there. Uh
The West was
we went to sign him through that
valley one
valley further
and
you're gonna be serving some families
there. We're going
further to the west. We would need to
go through Tucson or even further
West
to
reservation. Um
We worked out a process
to be in our
private
predecessors to
use the Sanger and you
have the right incision.
Um We're
uh
uh
bothered by having
that problem later and
litigation. We wish we
weren't that efficient
during
the negotiation, facilitated
by anyone the privacy.
Um I think that that
really Asian hasn't been successful
and looking for ways
that I vote of
Asian we
have on the line
notation are not sovereign.
But
when this
point, we have that, that
position to
the
>> state and the
its crimes in Center
for that law
make
consultation, whether
it's in Mexico
State or the Consultation
Act or in the Federal
government is just that
for completion, it
means that you
have a menu in which
what here, what a sovereign
nation has to say
any expressed opposition
and then you go over and need to
one
and part of my
frustration and concern with the
staff and
is that everybody gets
to, to sort of
all and say, well,
I'm, I'm not, you're not. So,
you know, you don't have the obligation,
you don't have the obligation
to or
consider or
listen to or follow any
direct express
by these tribes.
But rightly, as we all
understand, it is the responsibility
in the federal government
and they may or may not
take that responsibility series,
they may or may not
um follow a rule
on what it means to
actually stand
in front of a sovereign nation, hear
what they may and then do something
different because of what we
learned and what we heard.
Um So certainly I
am I am steping or, or
speaking to my, I,
I read a news
article, I understand the
public service.
Um but it really bring
the a lot of questions but we,
as we are still call
and certainly at the federal
level are projects like
this that
walked over and built
over, Strupp
over
and that our cultural
resources and
to the nation that have
all this piece of places small
like regular state,
which best level
today. So for
bound to, we
still see those
concerns that the government
more concern
as
well. Our private
entity out of money
clear between
and we entities
like this is gonna get pushed
through at any
loss what it looks
like. But
as a policymakers,
we and our constituents
including with so nations
that we now show that and
deserve us to have.
Um
I have very
much more bigger
to these questions
in the very permanent way
that we are
still
it. And just with me
from my remaining time
to, you know,
do you all have a chart
of liaison? What in
what way you do as
a as a
a political matter in
New Mexico, do all
engagement, consider
in salt tribal
government 24
and, and those are successful
land
Mexico.
>> Uh Thank you generally
and representative
um with respect to
this. So, you know, I I don't
have any details to,
to add, but
Mr Seman, that's
already stated
um in terms
of tribal
engagement, um
we tend to
work with the
department where they have
much
bench on. They,
they have experts
made up for experts
set out with
the direct
to the
Martians go.
Um On the Western
Spirit Line, we do have
a, that
was a sled of
little and that
uh
for me, it was by the
agreement was decided that
was negotiated
and um I
think work out well, I have a
place about that.
The North pass
line wheels that a
fine
se puo
and mas nation.
And we're in that process
now and
very involved
in um
working with the understanding
their impeachment
process.
We do have PB members
on bona
and
not
or on
top
March.
So
>> I really appreciate that one. Just
say in New Mexico, we
have New Democratic majority
Democrats everywhere.
Fundamentally, we seem to
be a to the idea
of that, that,
that this is
a little like just like
any other industry you have
to have available questions, no
consideration
development and then in
on
and and for
still. So
thank you, Mr Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
>> representative.
Thank
you.
Um
have level
vets,
I believe in the
redone of
presentation.
It listed
six and
Broads
um
Western spirit that I
under it will be right.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
That is a
California d
of uh
kill one. Is that
correct?
>> A general
Townsend, the
800 megawatts of
win was purchased
by customers
in California that
was
determined
um by
private agreements between
the generators
and customers.
That's just how that worked
out at
>> the. So
the line,
how is that? Where is
that?
>> The, that's a DC
L and so by
design, it's always
intended as an export
line to get
power from the Corona
area with
our all the way to
an all station. So that's
3000 megawatt and that's
also all exported in the
I
that's not all in,
that's
California.
>> Ok. Yeah,
I have more
thought on it, but
but let's
uh
wow. Asem.
The alli
utilize
industrial relevant
new bombs for construction.
Is that correct
sir?
That's correct.
Just like
that.
So the new Mexico
taxpayer
something
died
to or the California,
is that
correct?
>> That their journey we
>> represent balance?
Um I
believe that there is
that the state of
that what I
had.
So, so
and so
you all like
that,
>> you
>> representative. Um
Yes, we use
and do you know what the
benefit is
of to
pattern energy
ball
for the construct of
sun
in rail
bonds? How much did that say
to them? So
I chairman, the main
representative, I don't have a specific
number top of >> mind.
Um >> I joined
the government
>> 18 months ago and
I am not expert on that, but I have
provided information. Unfortunately,
during AO
>> do that, this
like the back of his hand wasn't
big thing that I can get you that
>> having to provide that to you. >> So
you might have know be
here.
Um
I would, I would like
that information and I'd like
to share it with
the, with the
committee as a whole
because I think it's a
very
important
that
we
discern
but the value
of
a company,
uh whatever they
do, they
coming in to New
Mexico building a
project and
utilizing industrial
revenue
bonds.
Um And it's,
it's millions of dollars,
I think it's like $60
million if I run my
calculations,
right? Maybe more
than that.
But
I will, I I think
it's important that we
understand.
Yeah,
these type of
projects,
although they create
significant
workforce
during construction,
industrial reven
bonds were
originally
envision to create
jobs and
long term
um electric
transmission creates
very few resonant
jobs.
So
let's go on r
solve a Southwester
Power Group. Where
does that to
go?
>> Chair mclean
Representative Townsend,
that's getting to be
determined. Um
But as I said, the,
the uh
development of the line,
we just really excited about that
because this will be our first
project where there
will be intervention
points in New
Mexico.
The um the
Salter makes anac of
negotiations with
uh both El
Paso Electric and
GM
Act. And then there's
also
um active
negotiations, uh
generators,
we use the transmission and
keep in mind that
beauty is notation
um to
uh earth's power.
PNM is quite hungry for
a new wind power in
regards in their system. So it's
slightly inert holded
as those negotiations
progress that
there will be a our connection.
And that
makes
uh >> thank >> you
>> chair, luckily you said
that that is an A
line
will allow that today
lower uh
easily >> uh
Chairman Queen.
And yes,
the substations to
energy supplies are
are far less expensive than
the DC
stations so that we
up to 11
substations
moute in New
Mexico
>> and the North
path
where we >> of the
north pad is designed
as a DC line to
access the
win
China
and
a trip. And
now
we, here's the
way the ground air
connect.
Um but
there,
there's reasons, engineering
reasons. I I my dep's
pretty hurts
to AC versus AC
as far as by loss and
AC so you can
large amounts of power a
longer way
without more
efficiently.
Um So on
either end of that line,
there will be an opportunity to
interconnect a
where that and all that is
sort it out. I don't know.
I, I see here today,
I do want to add on
the Sun Sea Line.
There is
a plan right now
um with P and LS bringing
on to interconnect
on the east. So,
so there's a chance
that
Soza Soia will
definitely
um it's
already a
certain increase
possibility or
PS choices. And
so if they
joins the data
market and eventually
RT O, it
has a race whether it
goes with S TT
or
uh Kos day
market will be
a new
RT.
So
those air connection
possibilities.
Um You have an
opportunity for
more reliability, more
connection
or
dollar. >> I
appreciate that.
And just
a side of,
I'm pretty familiar
with the rightway
business, art
power minds
and the kid
uh the
power line ride,
they are
limited
to voltage or
size of conductor
or direction of low.
Like a lot of other
pipelines are,
I mean, can you can you
readily can a donor go in and
change a 345
line to change
the conductor on it and make it a
six or
745 or whatever
the number is. Can you upsize
it without going back
to the piece?
Andreo
that uh right away
agreement
>> chair with me be
housing.
It varies. It
depends a lot on
what that original right of the
agreement said.
And if we allow
for expansion of the
capacity of the line
and that the
developer or the utility
of where on line to
increase the
the capacity, Um
Some of those right
agreements are specific
to say 300 type
five K A
and
the run and
Right.
>> Thank you, Mr Jarre Moss.
I hope I finished that
briefly. I
can.
Our
desire
is as a
legislator
to,
hello,
that
renewables
and to excite
that illusionary across
our day
has caused this
legislature
at times
to not be very
clearly long
term.
And, and I will tell
you that
IRB is being
used,
which means that
taxpayers and the me
taxpayers
are subsidizing the
construction toto
of
almost $100 million
over $100 million
on, on multiple
lines
for power that doesn't
even
land in New
Mexico.
And the companies don't
provide
an equitable
amount of long term
jobs is
wrong
and I take right. Iii
I
really believe it's,
it's, it's very
wrong. We gotta, we gotta
do something.
Secondly,
the ongoing
generation
of that
electricity,
you know, on New
Mexico
Plateaus
and, and being
used to go
someplace else.
And the New Mexico
taxpayer pays
for the
generation or helps
pay for the generation of
I RT set of these
etcetera and they have no
income from it.
Long term. The New Mexico
taxpayer drives
to buy that one
generation of that
soar and
very few of, of them
pay a
severance type tax
or a reduction tax
or something to the taxpayer
to enhance the bottom
line. I keep hearing all of this
about we're going
to diversify our
economy and we're gonna,
we're gonna strengthen it with this
renewable, but it
doesn't do
anything.
And in fact, it does the
opposite. We're
paying to get it billed to go
to California or Nevada
and it just doesn't
make sense.
So, although I think
the industry is a coal
industry, I think it's
got a lot of
benefits. They're
taking advantage of New
Mexico and New
Mexico that's
allowing.
And so Mr
Chairman, I, I think
we need to rethink that
and rethink how we do
business development.
>> Thank you.
Thank you
and
>> thank you Mr Chairman and
thank you for your presentation.
You know, in our state, we
need clean
energy, we need an
energy that is not moving
our air, land and water.
So thank you for what you
do. We need to
expand it
um in our
base, we play a little part on
expanding um because
they have V missions and, and
training pilots, but I think
you guys are doing a great job.
Um
You are not the only distributed
exports, gas and
oil exports. So, so
that's a little bit easy.
Um
And as far as subsidies
subsidize in the other industry
for 75 50
75 years. So I'm not sure
where that comes from, but
thank you for what you do. I just
want to make some points
that you're critical
to Mexico, you're critical to
the, the world and
not burning up. So, thank
you.
Um
>> Thank you. Um
So I have a couple of questions.
Uh
this Mosteller um
can you
describe
uh the public process
by ways the North Path
study?
So >> the North path
that sorry chaired
me and numbers the North
Pass um
touches the line, every flavor
of land in Mexico
process, the federal
land. And so there will
be a
legal
process that has
not started yet. And
so they'll file their
299
application probably
sometime next year named
Burma.
Um more
than where they are now where that route's gonna
be before they file the
application. So they
need to process
um
I see
very technical, very public.
Um Lots of
state order engagement, lots of
leaders.
>> And does the Nepa process
only apply
to the federal lands impacted
or does it apply to
the secret private lands
that have
process? >> So
they need the process,
there's an environmental
impact statement that would include the
entire route
for
um parcels
with the state land office. There
will be an
additional process with
the state land office
to apply for those right
ways.
And I was
there is usually
hearings and a public
process there as
well
>> have a private
license.
Uh Chair
>> mclean for private
land.
The
uh project company
typically already
has done state over
engagement meetings
um
to socialize
project and then they
engage in visit
with private landowners
and they are not all the
processes, these are rapidly
negotiated right
place.
>> So I don't
know.
Yes, I'm encouraged that you're
crossing the land
so there will be some
compliance. Um
My concern, I understand this
review in the past
is that we don't have
regulatory uh
recitals
of transmission like
construction in
Mexico.
Um And I think
that remains true. I think
a lot of people think of reading it.
It's a regulatory oversight
as far as we can tell, it's
absolutely not.
You're effectively
Ament with the
developer. Uh
And you
facilitate the
process uh
including uh and I
don't know if you use it
or I don't think, you know, if you
have the right
to as
part of the process.
I
>> uh she, yes, that
is correct. Um
We have used that
authority uh
in 19 days related
to the Western Spear Project.
Uh None of those
were contested cases.
Uh We've been in
existence since
2007. So
we've done 19 cases
all
to
sort out tid and get
a right of way plan
for area where we could not find
the land own. And there
were multiple
proba we have had
been
litigated to get into the record.
Landmarks made a great
deal. Um
So he's one of those cases.
There was a public
filing
notice, no one
showed up
and money was made into the court
registry. And if you fall
in touch, it was an issue
and Westernburg would not have
been built if Frida
had not had
the,
we have
contestation.
>> And then I appreciate that, but the
authority extends beyond
contestant cases,
right? >> Uh
term.
And I can't say that we don't ever
have an
>> OK. So I
um
my, my district as it
was previously configured including
Mountain Air and
Mountain Air was originally
identified and it's part of
that of Wester.
Um The community
did
uh and mountains
there is situated near
Naval Pass
which is a key
location
or
any sort ili because
of uh
on either side by national
or
there's
a,
an effort to avoid federal
lands, possible to avoid the
process.
But II I
really,
you know, concerned that we have
like on the one hand of
Sania,
which
it's been a lengthy and expensive
Brossel. And on the other
hand, we have
mustard,
there's, there's no the
oversight
I remember
and I just
uh we're gonna have
problems. Uh And
I think we can slightly come
up in the
north
turns out that
uh
Miss Marcell, let, let me
ask you. Um
you previously were
with another General Council
for, is that
correct?
>> Uh Channel nine is
director >> and you
uh uh
private, that you
private
practice.
>> I was in private practice
uh while I was
down for me to be
A and
R for legal
services and life for
all
I
years ago
and several years
since then applied
and this
award
and I was still need to try that
now for
about.
>> And did you,
have you ever
represented
A?
>> No, I have not,
no
by my former
B
>> but during the year time as general
counsel,
uh
was your position
uh
vital
was Rita by
recollections under the Martinez
administration. Rita
was effectively
defunded.
Do you recall
>> um chairman
when I, yes, I do
infringe all that. There
were a few years
in which we did not receive
appropriation
and we see we
received
contributions
from uh
initially Green Line
Energy and then
pattern energy.
And when I think the reacting
retouch. And
so um
we
have
projects
um policy in
which once those funds
are received by Rita A
read control and
a um
to determine how those respects.
And I guess uh
referring to
get at the
for 500
just >> a little
bit. So,
so the committee
understands this
but that for reasons, I don't
understand, the Martin
administration refused to.
Rita.
Rita continued to
operate with
the money divided
by
the the predecessor of
pattern. So it wasn't the pattern
of the the because they had a require
that. So
basically industry was
funding this
state
and the state entity works
on that industry
and it's a very close
relationship
and it
continues to concern me.
And so your
Preser, it's most Jeremy
Turner who I
appreciate respect,
but he now works for
battle. So
he went from the executive
director and Rita to
the employee
that energy
and this is sort
of
next
a very close relationship
that the for me
continues to
point out the lack
of oversight
of construction of a
transmission
of,
I think construction, at least
transmission wise, probably
more than,
you know, and I would like to see
where that it's facilitated.
But in a way that
uh
there is a following.
So when I represented the community
found there,
we, I can remember a
public meeting
with it
wasn't
in there, there was a lot of
concern about the
transition line.
And the reason we
had that public meeting was the state
land
office
require,
it wouldn't have happened.
Must have seen the concer,
the state land office drag them out
there and they
never the end
and to their credit, they moved
further. So
I think they have a path
with a larger
landowners. So they
were
uh
right. So it didn't negotiate.
I think that was a win, win.
Um
But I still think that this is, it's
a thing that
we,
we're missing something
and we haven't
had the
Senate and the initiative
and the momentum to fix
it. And I believe
at some point it's gonna be
control
anyway. Thank you
all for your presentations.
Uh I do appreciate that,
but if you
ever have more
information about,
I would love to take your name
off of.
Thank you all very much.
Thank
you.
So, we're all late. Our
next
panel is the Transition
Act, progress challenges
and enforcement, the
panelists to come forward. I
appreciate.
And it's
on your comment on
the, you want
more
information
is that, that you want
the information to you
or they give
it to the committee
and maybe an email.
Uh what I meant
was the North
Path.
Uh
It's a few years of
making uh I'm
interested in it and
if they ever had information
and reach out to me personal,
it does go through my district.
So I'm interested in not going
to use. So it
wasn't,
wasn't sleep on that.
That's
what I,
I just would also like
to see with dynamic information and
put out my Rita and
then, and
then to me, it would be
more
OK
or uh
to legislators and
we all got that. And thank
you, Mr Chair.
Thank you for
that.
So on the,
he would certainly as a
certain,
OK.
Uh
about a half hour later, um
we have a 45
minute and
we have vs
um so you can't all
take 10 minutes.
Um
I'd like you to forgot a
lot.
OK. So
we'll go on order
uh you here on 10 that
for seven. We got
Michelle
>> the more Mr Channer as it would
be
today, I'm gonna be presenting
about
>> try to move it
over. So I
can't
a problem
>> today. I'm gonna be presenting
on the greenhouse
gas or
that are currently
available here at
Mexican Environment Department
and um
why they're important,
how we plan to use them
and why we can
anticipate in
the coming bes as
far as our new
one
to begin. I just wanted to
note that the State
of New Mexico has an inclining
action.
I know the
previous one was
updated. So we have
um we did up ourselves
to update our Climate
Action State of New
Mexico page. Uh
We have some special projects
at the top and then critical
initiatives by
agents about
uh what each of our agencies
is doing. And
that's as
well
as a quick reminder, um,
we have a state
goal to
achieve greenhouse gas
emissions reductions of almost
45% by
2030 as compared to
2009
levels and
the governor of added
long term care
of reach net zero
by
2050.
And so the reason why
these greenhouse gas and
these ors are
is because we can't change
what we can't measure these
inventories. Really
give us
um a report
out on the data
by
sector
concerning the greenhouse
gas emissions.
It's always backwardly
because we look
at what hasn't
happened in the past.
We do have
projections
um that we
do based on
different po policy
initiatives and that sort of thing,
but without our,
where the officials are and
where they're coming from,
um it's difficult
to chart that, of
course, in order to meet our
hos,
um we have
two reports currently
available on our
website, one
reviews the economy
and one emissions
house gasto
and that is
identifying the 2005
emissions and
then um
2018 emissions
that report was
issued in October
2020
that needed a oil
and gas specific
report to look at that
sector. Um
That is the largest
sector um
of our
emissions and is
the largest of
inventory. So
we zeroed in on that sector
um and has according more one of
20 emissions releasing
that report in
a 2022.
So you'll recall at the
time, you'll see the
high that
has um the
emissions by
this is the co
from
which
earlier this year we
were from
the land under the
climate
um to conduct
a new inventory.
And so we
domestic Environment Department
are
we um
agency that was
the
grants and we
have with
our,
with the National
Resources Department
and they have been assisting
us on
the grant deliver
rules on this as well.
We as a state submitted our
Ryan we climate
plan on March
1st 324
and we have
a comprehensive assignment.
Actually even coming up
on that, we will be
submitting on
December of next
year. And so
as a part of
priority co of action,
I have the
book, we
have
several
P A that's here.
Um One of the very
important pieces to
this priority Climate
Action that was provided
the basis for one of these
two agens in the
very process.
Um Unfortunately, we do
not proceed
fund for our
phase two applications
as a state, but
um that work has been completed
and we are are working to
identify weapons
source that
will help us
because so much more was put
into those um
help us complete those
projects and
she
productions that those
projects um are
projected from the original
speed. And
this is really a precursor
to our call
by
2025.
And so, um we
have been doing a lot of work
at the environment
um based on,
you know, GHG
inventories that we
have. Um
we right now
are developing
an
inventory that
will provide us a
updated view
of emission,
greenhouse gas
emissions,
um
greenhouse gas emissions
price.
So once
we have that
um
uh published,
that will really
be the guide
to the
comments of
climates
and what additional
posies we need to
implement in order
to reach
our gas production
goals.
So this is
a snapshot of what was
submitted in our
priority
plan. Um
We have
2005
baseline here
that um we are
in relation to identify
as a result of the
o the executive
order and then we
have
20
numbers and then
of course, we
gas uh
industry sector
is a
part
of that has been informed
by the 2020 inventory
as well. This
is a quick snapshot
of the 2021
percentages and
numbers uh
don't take too
much hard to
these. Um We
are be a
brand new
GHG order
great that
we are going
to publish in the
next couple
weeks here. We actually
going back to Albuquerque
and on Thursday
with our
consultants that
have helped to develop the
in the data
and everything that goes
into
um
inventories. They
are everything
from he
c tos from the
federal government grounds
to uh lots of
capitals that we
on the
ground
or the 30 that way. But
the,
this is just a review of
the inventory and
for the update that we're
gonna be publishing this
year, um
insurance.
Uh You can see that
we had some
consult
partner and
they assisted us with some of
the work that we have
previously done. So we were very
good in Mexico
and how we calculate our
machines or
continuity.
We are um
very excited to see
where it land
in 2021 with
our greenhouse gas of gas
emissions and inventories
for purposes like really
inform what those policies
are that can help
us get to our
greenhouse
gas
full.
Um On this slide, you'll
see some data
sources that for
our
um
inventory
calculations
and very much look forward
to help
report um as soon
as we are able um in
the next couple of weeks
here and then by
additional surveys
as to where we are and
um as group of comprehensive
climate action in the
process, helped build a
framework for
where we're going and how
to reach our state greenhouse
gas emissions
list.
>> Thank you. Next time we
have
and then remind you of the computer
presentations, but we're
looking for rather >> like
feelings.
>> Great, just doing a sound
check here.
>> Do I like that? My own slides
or
>> there's a clicker? >> Got
it. >> Ok,
great. Well, I
and I'm the director of the Sierra
Club Rio Grande chapter,
representing over
35,000 members and
supporters all around the
state including
West Texas. Uh
So thank you. To the
chair and all those who have taken
the time to be here. I'm gonna
talk about this a
sliver of
emissions uh
that Michelle spoke about
and that's just from the
electric sector.
Um So you all will
remember that in
2017
slides, the same
here that PNM
closed
stacks two and three of the
satellite generating station.
They also
announced the
closure of stacks
one and four
and that was gonna happen
in 2022.
And you may have even seen the
videos of the four
stacks of
being demolished in
August.
Now that
could lead to
a very hard
landing for
workers for the
community where this plant is
located that have
served all of us
including me since the day I was
born with
energy. So
how are we as
New Mexico and
as the legislature gonna
soften that landing
because in the case
of the Navajo generated
station in
Arizona,
nothing happened. The
plant closed, the
workers lost their jobs,
the county lost the tax
base tax base
and nobody lifted a finger to do
anything about it. So
thankfully, the New Mexico
legislature did
and we looked at the Energy
Transition Act
in three different ways.
We wanted to see renewables
built in the impacted
area to
replace the tax base
and help replace some
of the jobs.
We wanted to see savings
for customers through
securitization or basically
refinancing the outstanding
debt on the
plant. And
we wanted to help
workers, the county
and ensure that there would
be cleanup
funds.
The next thing that the Energy Transition
Act did was to
say how
much of the
electricity generated
by our
investor on utilities
and co-ops for that matter had
to come from renewable
energy. And thanks to
your having done that in
2007, we saw
huge increases
in the uptake of renewable
energy in the state.
So we set these very
ambitious and nation
leading tools
and you will see.
Congratulations utilities.
You're doing a pretty good job.
You are meeting the goals in some
places. You're using
certificates instead of
real energy, but you will be
there. But all
of the utilities are meeting
the ambitious goals that
we set from renewables
and battery storage
and on and on and PNM
will even be a
73%
renewable um
by 2025.
So this is really good work
and we're getting, what
does that mean for replacing
the energy that we
previously had generated
at the San Juan generating
station? Well, thanks
to some of the flexibilities that
you gave the public regulation
intervention, they were
able to remove it to
approve a 100%
renewable and battery
storage replacement
package. And it
wasn't even because of the
flexibilities. It's because it was
the best price. So the
economy is doing the work for
us. All of it
was and is located
in the four corners area and
that amounts to a $1
million investment
in the four corners area.
Now, this hasn't been without
challenges, these seriously
face supply chain as
used. One of the four
releasement projects is still
being worked on, but you can
see we're making pretty good
progress. Um
Three of the
four
projects are
operational in a
royal, the
Royal project in mckinley
County. Uh
The project at
Ria Pache in Rio Riba
County. We've got
mail the sand one solar
online at the plant
site and then it, it
looks like the Rock Monts
project that was having trouble
um is being acquired.
The company hasn't announced
who's acquiring that at this
point. Um But we're
getting close. So
that's, that's really good news.
What does that mean
for helping out the school
district
when you ensure
that the energy is built in the
school district, you're at least
replacing some
of the tax base that was
lost from the plant coming
down. You're seeing
construction jobs.
Um And, and
that's part of the
economic progress that we
want to see. Now, this is
my electric
bill. Yes, that
I only paid $37.
That's because they make it turn the
bill, but
we are getting a
monthly
savings of
$9.28
because San Juan
to was very
expensive.
Ok. So these are
savings that all
and customers are getting around the
state for the next year
or so.
Now, how
did the Energy Transition
Act help workers? It
did that in three
ways. The first
is that it allowed
PNM to refinance
a certain amount of money
specifically for severance,
not just for plant workers,
but also for mineworkers
who otherwise wouldn't have been
included. Now, this
hasn't been just a have, you know,
not the money fest right
now. Um You know,
Westmoreland and their
employees are actually at the labor
relations board and
their money is being held in
escrow disappointingly.
Um But the, the
plant workers have received
their severance
pay
and then you'll see that
all new and being
built in New Mexico
serving New Mexico.
So, you know, pattern
and Sunia could choose to
do this, but they are not required
to have to have an
increase the amount of
certified apprenticeships on
their books. The challenge
is making sure that
we're really aware when force
is here. Is it the PR
C, is it the Department
of Workforce Solutions
or is it a shared
responsibility?
The next thing you'll see is
an additional amount of
savings that we were able to put
towards agency
grantmaking within
the county. You can
see the numbers for Indian
Affairs, economic development
and workforce solutions plus
the additional money that the
governor gave a couple of sessions
ago in the form of junior
money.
Now, some of the
outcomes. You'll
see that
571
plant workers receive
checks for $40,000
each. It's not
gonna change their economic
life, but it is a
help and it is a lot
more than any worker in Arizona
got 51
have their money being held in
reserve while they work on
plant Decommissioning. And
actually 96%
of the workers who receive
those funds are still in San
Juan County and have not
moved. You'll
see that the Department of Economic
Development has now
awarded close to
$6 million
to four different projects.
Very different in
41 is a concrete
plant. Another one is a
farm, another is an
indigenous farmers
um union and each
of them are making
solar or water pump
additions to their
activities
in affairs still needs to
grant their money and they have until
the end of this fiscal year to
do that unless you
re amount that
was given to them by PNM.
By the way, this is
not taxpayer
money, this is
refinance savings
that customers would have otherwise
paid. So
in total
customers
while still being able to add
to things like worker
severance money, these
grants and
lastly
uh with additional money for
cleanup. So although
customers had already
paid a $100
million towards line
recreation, in
addition to other mummies, we were
able to put $30
million additional
towards clean up.
And last, I'll say, you know, some
wanted to do this a different way.
Some thought, hey, let's
just pop on some
carbon capture and sequestration
them and keep the plant running
running.
Unfortunately, you know,
we spend millions of dollars,
the federal taxpayers
money via the
Department of Energy.
Um basically to
try to buy tax credit
carbon capture.
So we spent a ton of money
on the economic and technical
viability of such a project.
It failed because the project
would have been just too expensive
and produced energy that was
wildly more expensive
than even just
renewables and battery
storage. In Illinois,
we just saw a major
Co2
underground leave putting
groundwater at risk. So
please remember when
you're thinking about declining
for space or allowing
for classes
wells, what you are
putting at risk. It's our water
sources um
in a related and serious
way. So and Chan has now
moved its intentions towards
the for corners plant
working with inte despite
the fact that none of the other
homes have any
interest in such a path
forward. So I
want to end just by
congratulating the
leger. This
was a hard
negotiated
film with
lots of parties.
There is no legislation
that magically implements
itself. We have had to
work for the implementation
of every single part of this
bill. But because
of you and your vision
workers have been
compensated.
New economic
diversification is being
funded. We have
serious new renewables
on the system and we're
leading the nation while we're doing
it Thank you so
much.
Thank you. What about that, Zoe,
please?
>> I know who I am.
I'm going to
just get
back on track
on the right
side.
Uh I'll start here
Excel Energy in, in New
Mexico again, is meeting
the renewable portfolio
requirements. State
most recently,
the public
regulation commission approved
400 megawatts of new
solar uh
including battery energy
storage, all of those
projects. So
we are
uh we are making
progress towards the
renewable energy and portfolios
in the and it is part of
our
uh ethos to
dating that progress.
That cell energy was the first
request for utility innovation
to announce a
zero primary goals by
2050. That was in
2000.
I'm here to provide you
all an update with our integrated
of our integrated resource
planning process. I
discussed the
the growth that we're
experiencing on our system
showing the visual
of how we
started to see that
uptick in the
p volume
of load
requests that you have
to last
year seeing that
um that own
growth coming we
requested from the
commission to file our
ird a year
early. And so
we are now
in the middle of our R
process following that.
Ir this is just
a visual of the generation
resources that we have on our
system. What's important
to note is
that one major
driver of
the of 5 to
10 gigawatts
of energy
needed. Follow
following the IRP
is the
retirement of
the coal power
plant that
coal power plant
generating station
is that to retire the
end of 2020.
Uh The commission
uh provided us
authorization to retire
government and is the last
whole generating station
on
SPS.
Uh Here is where we
are in the timeline.
Uh Last year.
The prior to
filing the integrated
resource plan
PS uh
had a robust,
facilitate state old
engagement problem that
process boards required
by the PR
C. Um what is
highly valuable when we're
talking to our customers and our
communities about the use
of our system
in that process,
our customers brought
more than electrification
load forecast that they
asked us to model
as part of that integrated
resource plan. And
that's where you see
the top of
the, the range
of a need of what it
would take for SPS
to bring generation onto
the system to electrifying
oil and gas industry that I'm
certain that is the
10, the 10,
a lot of
uh stealing
in that Hiar
um We
were able to reach a lot
of consensus for
stakeholders
in this
process. Uh
We've agreed to
evaluate the extension
of some of our
uh gas units
and in the re
to, to
determine whether we can
realize the seeings
and extending the lives of those
units rather than replacing the
right way. Um We
issued that RP like I
said this summer.
Um
And
uh
and we are
also get the
rmiay
for a long lead time,
carbon free
dispos.
So as we look to
meeting the needs of our system
today, here we are.
We're also looking at
whatcom market, right,
the needs of brow
uh so that we may
maintain
system reliability
in an affordable fashion.
Now, the
facilitator survey,
the stakeholders
in that process, we had over
7070
entities represented
including P RT staff,
including club,
including government
departments, um
and our customers, our
local V CS.
Um and
that the most
important
um pieces
a good IRV puzzle
to the savings for
reliability and
affordability. They want to see
us bring on a
resource portfolio
that maintains system
reliability, lights
on and it
maintains
affordability.
We issued the RRP
this summer. Um
It is looking
for a total
of 3190
megawatts of accredited
capacity. In order
to be that accredited
capacity, it
will like 85 to 10
and loss of me
capacity. And
what's driving that
that need is driven by
a force electrification
and load growth in our
surface territory. It
is driven by Asian
generation units that are
coming off of our system light
and full generating
plant
in Texas. Um
And it's also being driven
by increasing planning
reserve requirements
at now.
Those requirements are
reliability requirements
that each member must
maintain a certain
level of pass
on their in order to
meet their system needs.
So the
barble has increased the
summer plan reserve
margin and has now
added a leer planing
reserve margin as we
see increasing weather
device um that
threat liability such
as
that need. Uh
that uh
32
did a lot accredited
that we need can be met
in a couple different ways
in this R
uh RP options. One
and two are generator
remover options.
So that uh that
is seeking to
replace
the approximately
1000 megawatts
uh located at
the to generating
station and then
also approximately
5000 or excuse
me, 500 megawatts.
Um and the Ingels
and plan has
uh a that
I gas
uh gas payments.
Now as part of
the IR stakeholder
process, we did
uh agree with our
state first that we
would also evaluate the
economics of extending the
lives of the students.
Um so that we can realize
some of the affordability,
um possible
affordability benefits
of extending those lives
for our customers. So we will
also evaluate that
re option three
is um looking
for new Greenfield
development, so not
replacing our generation,
but looking for new projects
out there. Um
We're gonna need approximately
1600 megawatt of
generator replace
um in options one
and two, we need about the
other path about
1600 megawatts
from option
three. And those
options are really limited to
what's available in
the Diesis Q at
the. So
the PP
sties generation
interconnection uh
as part of its school
processes to study the
reliability and what transition
needs might be that if
those generators are brought on,
there's different phases
to those studies. And so
we're looking for projects
that have phase two
of that process
um to fid into
the art of we and that
could be uh independent
to develop
projects or there are some
utility development projects
as well. It's important
to note that this is an
ALLO RP
or truly located
for the most
cost effective resource
portfolio to be at a
customer
base.
Now, I will do the
last panel
of
that the
SPP with doing transmission
plan. It really only
studies generation
that has been accepted
by the commission. So you
see a lab of when we
provide the with
our study request
to when they when they come
out with transmission projects,
right? There's about 11 a year
and a half to get there, but
there's further
uh process necessary
in order for them to start studying
generational
take and take um
we to build on that transmission
about five years or
more from the time
we submit load >> request to
be able to study to
>> when those transmission
gets built. Um
And as a
result, when we build
the trans, the generation
in our I we
maze until we need it
mission to help
and lost some of the capacity.
Um because
DP is
not considering that
that generation in its
study processes until we
receive
uh from our
condition. So,
one of the, one
of the
uh challenges that
we see are in some
regulatory timelines
and those are statutory deadlines.
I do want to say
that the commission has been really
good about giving us timely
decisions on our,
like I just said, 400
megawatts were just approved
by our commission of Solar.
Um And we're very
thankful for that. The
commission did a good job of
staying at the end of the
statutory timelines
but the that remaining, but you see
a nine and 15 months
statutory timeline
for
um that creates
challenges when but
obviously as I discussed
before, but also when
developing did
more or less are
developers for today's mission
are going to plan
in the worst case scenario. So they
will those contingencies
to their is at the bid
price. It's very difficult
to bid price
um in terms
of building to
the emergent growth. I think
it's important for the
legislator to
consider ways that
they can, they can
encourage the
commission to approve and
encourage facilities to build
a of grow
and get ahead of the
loan room that's happening
on and not
on building just
time.
I think very
much.
>> Thank you. And
so
I
it is thank
you, Mr chair members of the committee.
I will be on time.
So uh I have
no slides. I have one page
handout that summarizes
what we're gonna talk about
today. Tri-state
as you know, is a poorly name
quality. We serve members in
four states, the
Toity members
across the grass of Wyoming,
Colorado and New Mexico
and 11 of the co-ops in
New Mexico certified. One
of those 11 I work
with as an electric
quality of
Qs. We're all member, own
member governed non for profit
systems. And
today we utilize
the first of
land, solar hydro
gas, oil coal to be our
energy. We're in the
middle of a very rad energy
transition that will
actually ex see the Energy
Transition Act guidelines,
unmatched
reliability because
that's the key for us all job when
we want to keep the light on
first liability
and then followed by a work
our energy transition started in
2010 with construction
Cimarron plan at the time to the
largest solar project
in the United States
2019,
convened a multis
holder group, the
governor's office withs
depleted organized
labor. All
states operate
to conduct
a resource planning
process. We call a responsible
energy. And
as a result, we started our
transition and began
with Vonte
coal mine getting
20 the
workers they all received
severance program, which
about a year pay.
Also, we had funding
for and affect communities
and
families. And
um we also added at the
same plant, I guess. Finally,
solar plan 200 megawatts
and invest there
in order to resource a tax
base. It was lost
that. It's
200 megawatt plant sits on
7, 700
acres and it's currently
one of our very lowest cost
energy resources
state
raise.
We also added some wind in Colorado. So
today we're about 33%
renewable. So about a third of the energy
consumed by our
resources today. But
because of our responsible
energy plan by
2025
we will actually see the energy
kinds of those five years.
We will get 53%.
No like the
solar projects. They are currently under the
construction. Back
in next,
we completed a new er
to the energy resource plan in
August issued the R
A in October and we
will soon be awarding an
additional several
1000 megawatts
and solar and battery
and a small amount of natural
gas. Keep the light on. During
things like
in New Mexico, we're gonna have 50
megawatts of battery storage
to 20 2600
megawatts of solar in 2029
200 megawatts of wind
battery Gabo
2031. So that
by the end of this decade,
we will 72% of
renewable energy
across all more states
which we operate, not just
Mexico and in
the state of Colorado because they
have a carbon tonnage
base that we will
achieve an 89%
reduction in carbon dioxide which
up to the 2005
base of all of this
without sacrificing
reliability. That's the key
because our members asked
us to keep their lives.
We went to an extra measure,
we call we Andres
Chicago,
recognize nationally and
international as a new standard
for each of
these methods, use extreme
weather modeling rather than just
planning reserve market to ensure
that no matter what happens
if it's storm with five
days and grow the
wind,
whatever weeks occur when the
sun is not shining. So
we need to make sure that we have
a that over the resources
very those secure where there
is and we can do that while still
meeting
goals and
it's always unmatched affordability
as well. We've only
increased our rates 2%
since 2017.
I as we made
about
May that level cost
control increases because of the
work or members. They come
into the boardroom every month and all
the account for spending
their money. And I think that's a
beautiful,
we just announced
Friday that we will
be awarded $2.5
billion in funding
Federal andl
Reduction Act to help us to
energy transition.
Say our race,
part of that meeting
that IE was hatched on Orance
20 things. And as she was
all the five years of work that maintain
legislation that now
has become funding, not just
for this
process.
And so I just say to
summarize, we're gonna be
the energy transition go
fighters early will
pass it by in the decade. Be
72%.
I ask if you
challenge anybody to meet our
goals there
and we will other
nonprofit member.
I
go, I thank you
in Mexico, the legislators
for your environmental stewardship
and for providing us some
flexibility to
be.
Thank you and
this panel or
miss,
>> thank you, Mr Chair. How many
members? Uh I will
be brief. Uh A lot
of what I might have talked about has
been delivered by my analysts.
So just to give
you some wrap up
plots since
2019, the PR
C has approved more than
two gigs of
solar energy for
just Mexico's
investor of Il. So
that's not including any loss.
Uh So two
gig and or
been approved since
2019,
we've approved
more than one gig of
energy storage.
So that's huge
investment, huge progress,
huge of Googles
many, many cases coming through the
pr scene. And as you've
heard me say before, as we
heard miss these to
mentioned, we
are need
or
or meeting or
beating the
setto deadlines in which
to over these.
So we are
doing our utmost to get them through
and in some cases
succeeding and shortening
those those processes
even further.
I want to highlight a few things of what
the A RC has done recently
in implementing
ETA. And then I'll go
to my thoughts and
first of all, uh we
have recently passed
a
rule requiring
or specifying
how we're going to
measure and more
carbon emission limits
for, um,
online in this
weapons
pal. Uh they
took advantage of
a
security. A thank
you. And that means that
they have Caron and
machines, we
set those in place and that
would be on a three year
average to measure the
emission limits.
We are also in the
process, right? As we speak
of working on a rule
making, focus on implementing
the R portfolio
and, and changes as we
release to the laws.
So the renewable portfolio
standard changes
have been implemented in role
for the IOO. We
are currently working on
that
and last but not least uh
we have
as, as, as
we pointed out, I was gonna go
into the abandonment that we
approved, but the PR
C has approved
these abandonments
over the last
five years.
It is not
to effectively depends
if she going to go to let
a
there's a lot more work to do. And as
we know, the VRC is committed
to inviting and
enforcing the statutes that
you all give us.
Um We believe that
we are ready for the
challenge as we move
into the next phase to
as
thank you for that uh
the committee before we go
>> I just have one
question clarification.
So we heard from
Excel in their
meeting or receiving the uh
the
or is that
>> correct?
>> Yes, yes.
And, and, and what it
>> says,
Mr Chair, currently
all IO us
including PNM are
there times 25
7
>> uh version
Townsville.
Thank you.
Very
good discussion.
And
uh
when I look at car costs in
the next All
New
York,
I look at the average power
cost the
it's gone up
55%
give or take at the last
15.
But the be right
attrite Christ
State said
has exceeded
the mandates and has
gone out only
2%. How
do you justify
your rating
$100 of the
consumer
that a
multiple of 25
times what their
competitor,
>> Mr Chair Representative
IO us are
treated differently under the
law. I always have a
investor of tities
and have
different obligations
than coals do.
In New Mexico. Our
jurisdiction over coals is
extraordinarily limited
to a handful of
ladies and sometimes not even
then. So
it's not an to
comparison on the
work
>> but
terrible.
>> I believe that because
>> it is the, it
is
>> the cha
cha and that's
my point
if the technology allowed
him to be the go and
only go out to
percent
not
oversight
what good is over.
Science
>> representative, I I don't
have a rate
analysis that I can
read down but
you know, forgiving
in P but one of our
big critiques
that has been keeping
old dirty expensive
energy online for
way too long. I mean,
when we were talking about
the sound line generating
state in 2015
P and M said over our dead
bodies. Well, with
this plant before we said
we will and
you know, the economics just
said it's too expensive
to open.
And so, you know, when you're
operating a large
system, you want to
be able to
move nimbly. And the
reason that we wanted
secure cation as a
tool is so that P and M
could be this
expensive uh
source of
energy and
I'll take a financial
hit that would impact its
ability to bring on
energy sources
at, at good cost.
And so by being able to
refinanced, they
were able to say, well, OK,
yeah, we can move away from this
faster than whatever it
was 2052
or 2031.
As of the all.
So
with the investor
utilities, you know,
sometimes look at
the four corners plan, I
mean, uh A
Ts and Arizona has
acknowledged this is
very expensive to
run. Um But
it's hard for us to switch
shafts in part because they
don't have the type of tools that
you and the legislature afforded
them
>> terminal terminating
death.
That this is a whole
point.
My plate
was
then misses the
whole point.
The point is
that we had
a
nonprofit
utility serving for
states that met
the guidelines
of the Energy Transition
Act and did
it by only raising
the price.
Converse points
when
life,
our pr c
control
utilities.
All right,
I
haven't
are meeting the, the
mandates of
the liberation of that,
but they from
the 2
5%.
And I think that,
uh, something
that we should follow
consider
is
we get immediate
things
without Mandai
if we can be
that
and,
and business
models
drives.
Yes, sir.
>> Representative, I
mean, I do feel like the
trea is a regulated
entity or regulated
by the membership
office. So every month
I face 41
democratically
elect
their.
But I do think that's a business model
that still in, in my
heart, a lot of
appreciation money. I'm
spending about my friend money
and they look me right in the eye.
But I think
that's the strength part is spot
that you have a face I
understanding
and that is bringing, that's
a very good dragon
forces
and you know, with all different
II, I know
disparage any business. Well, that
makes money. That's what America's
all about. That's why
we have breakups to
provide oversight. So
that person has a
profit.
Go crazy and, and
respects,
>> but I appreciate it. I can
Mr Chairman,
I just, yeah,
but I, I think
it is important to
know
graduations
you guys for, for
meeting the mandates and
doing it in the,
in the, in the vision of the
Mandarin. I would
challenge the
BRC to
become more
concerned
rating payers
cost and
not meeting the
mandate
that is
desperately needed
and it drives businesses
and jobs and everything
upward when they have
the lower energy costs.
Thank you. Thank
you.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair >> and um
thank you
uh for
all your great work
trying to provide a
note,
clean energy
to our state. And
um
uh
Miss Curry, I >> just was
wondering if >> you could tell us
briefly how
um uh PNM
is going to
now go back and
provide the
uh energy
uh as part of the
Energy Transition Act
um or the
school
system
is and
um
humid sign
balance.
>> This is the chair runs a
hand.
I believe you're talking about the wrong
one project. Is that
right? The first
thing?
Well, as uh
Sierra pointed
out, it seems like that
project might be back on
a back after all.
Um But the
specifics to
the portfolio or
the projects that were approved
earlier this year by
the public regulation
question. Um
That is >> that
question >> of the,
the signing of
that >> project
in the >> school district. It did
not decide one way or
another as to
the fate >> of that
apart.
Yes.
Yes,
I just want to add to that.
Um And just to provide a
little bit of context of the
for replacement
projects in total,
uh two of them were to be
located in the small
district which to
replacing that
tax base, the smaller
of the two ran
into trouble. PNM
has said that that
facility has been
a required
um but they also said that
there are possibly,
there's possibly
even more capacity to
be built there once the
project is
a quieter and
that they've made a
school district preference,
not just for this
round of energy coming
line, but for an
next RFP.
So I think that there,
there'll be more opportunities
to
locating
um energy school
district. The thing we were
concerned about a few months
ago was that the
staff at the PR C
recommended that the
project outside the
school district be
listed as the replacement
for the Romon project that
had been in the school district
and that's not included
in the final decision.
Thankfully,
um Mr Terence,
so
it is going to
happen like it was,
was
>> Mr Chair
representative.
We're humble
news points to
perhaps, but I will tell
you this is not an issue that
the PR C commissioners
nor staff has
forgotten or lost sight
of. So it is something that
we're actively watching,
um, and
determining whether
there's a place for us
here, whether we let
a f up for
speed as the
economy,
who is the chair representative. And I
don't think the story is
over. I guess it's one,
I,
>> I guess Mr Chair,
um, >> M Curry,
>> I, I think Pr
C should have
more
key in their endorsement
or things that were
almost and
um agreed
to.
Uh So
that's my concern that
we have that
person carried.
So thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you for representing
Mrs Morrow briefly.
>> Thank you, Mr will be
briefed.
Uh
Miss Curry, can you
Curri and Miss Curry? Can you tell
me,
you know, we, we see New
Mexico
and the timelines of
the renewable
clean energy.
Can you tell me how
much fossil
fuel,
fossil fuel produced
electricity comes into
in New Mexico
imported in is
imported in New
Mexico
to
you me, a couple
>> customers
>> chair
representative,
we recently
undertook a, a project
where we were trying to calculate
a very similar type of
question, that kind of the reverse
for renewable
energy.
And every time we got it
is going to be
clear and easily. It
wasn't. That's a
long way of saying I'm
happy to look at it and
see we can't get you an answer.
But off the top of my head, I don't
know
>> and, and Mr Chair
and Curry. But you
probably have a pretty good
idea
that, that we're probably
importing
we are any boing
fossil fuel, electricity,
>> electricity in the New Mexico,
right.
>> He was a chair, but it was
a real
energy
markets.
I would like to be,
be easy to get along
with a degree. But I, I don't
think that I can say that quite
so
affirmatively or strongly
because the
energy
electrons
from people, they go on to the
wires. Yes,
our activities due by
energy on the market
and so
assumably some of that
market is going to
energy growing whole
ando gene
resources.
But pinpoint
is that exactly
Thean
Smart,
>> I was hoping I would get a more
drink. That, that's,
that's good. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. Thank
you.
>> Thank you all very much for
your presentations. Uh
That this panel,
we do have two more panels
today. Um
We are gonna take a very
short range launch
behind schedule.
Um If you,
the remaining legislators
want to get their lunch and bring it back
and we're gonna start
back up at one o'clock.
So people who are on the
next, you can be here ready
to go at that time. I
appreciate it. I
just ride live
and best play on that.
Uh And it's uh for
the legislators, it's just right out
there
and I hope you uh make
it through. Maybe
you.
Um so please stick around.
I also take a short thank
you
here,
>> but.
In the middle >> and access to
the
G
that
I'm sorry
for
that.
So I can't imagine
for
I I Toler
Andrez.
Ok. It's
concern.
OK. So thank you to
the Mescalero child
lunch. Uh We
have two more panels till
today. They
said we have electric
capac and
powering up
for the backs.
All
I have a question about
the and then
you. All
right.
>> Thank
>> you.
>> My name
is
here
>> to talk >> about. First off
Genesis, the power
of >> many of you. I
just a
little
>> uh
with New Mexico
State L
across
the I 40 tradeport
order and the I
10 I
25
National Zero
res uh
about a year ago,
Arcos and do from
Bernalillo County. I know
be are reach out
the bill. I knew they had
to
encounter
to deal with the problem they would encounter
trying to get powerful sites
long by 40 traded
on the world
that brings
goods from the ports of
law. Ambulance are
about 40% of the
nation
Regin if
the right of New Mexico
and that's meant to be a project
in partnership with the US Department
of Transportation. And
it's meant to be a zero as
possible. And
again, you can't get the power of
sites.
They have one new idea.
Uh We said, hey, we have another
pass, a few different states. It's
huge and
support by the artist
support
and our state
support. They usually
work them out on it. We've been
off all the rais ever
since to
ill the challenge. Go to the
next.
Um You will
see. Oh,
I
uh on the left
here is a former
energy or full
a what was a auto title
which is now a finalized
charging connector standard
for heavy duty
trucks. That
one plug is the
megawatt charging connected
standard one plug, one
megawatt five
of those equivalents, the
instantaneous powered land
of an outdoor support stadium,
20 of those
equivalents, the Ayane power
requirement is
town but unlike
a small town and we now sports
state, it's
coming decades in
advance. Just takes
a couple of months to build a parking
lot and install some
charging.
If you turn around and ask for your
mobile utility, where do I plug
in this 20 megawatt mode? And
they say you can have your substation
in 24 7.
And that's a problem because we
need these Asians in order
to meet Mexico's
quality standards of the
building. All
it's the distribution system
challenge just to be clear. A
lot of the panels earlier today were
back generation and transmission.
Yes, there's an increase in total
electric consumption necessary
generation associated with
by the transmit
sector and buildings,
but it's not as huge
as you would expect. It's more of a
hotspot on the
local
and they, there
are people that can help us solve
this. But what
we're trying to do with this mill is get
ahead of the problems that are rolling
and materializing on the
ground. Other shapes,
the picture on the left of the one line
took Diamon had
orders in organ
of zero vision
semi trucks that had bomb
purchased by customers
in another state and told them to keep
them in Oregon because their
utility couldn't get them
power
on the right was low income
housing city.
And for the same reason
until the
power,
this is a picture of zero
emission electric trucks,
Southern California and is the service
territory. Volvo
trucks uh vol
the original Swedish
company, uh
one of the biggest truck manufacturers
in the world is on Max and
other brands. Those
customers for those trucks were
also bought by customers
who told if they keep them on the deals
line, they could be
power
as the title to the
slide says, let's
not let this happen in New
Mexico. That's the
idea of this bill is to
get ahead of problems like
this.
There are smart people can help
us get evidence from. This is
a slide from documents
to Grido to
county projecting to
24 to 30
2034
PAK command from
like vehicle charge in different
segments. You
can see the huge difference
between a advantaged
unmanaged charting
or managed charging center,
pushing below
sleeping, taking care
of and with great
capacity that
we have on the system
today. Sandy's
story.
This county overlaps
heavily without passing
services.
Um and you can see
really evening the
demand made driven
by charging here in an unmanaged
charging scenario,
bingo in a managed charging
scenario that's happening when everybody
is sleeping and there's a lot
of spare capacity of the
system.
Similarly, if
you look at the maps that
the electric powers
to develop
and in
consultation with
major fleets like Amazon
fedex um
and using publicly available
data for fastener
meetings, travel
telematics, A for
heavy-duty traveling trucks.
Looking into Mexico.
You can really start to see the
hotpots
where we need to start
investigating. We need new
substation, substation
upgrades, upgrades,
etcetera in
strategic locations.
And we can zoom in here to
Las Cruces for example
and you can see that one
Hexagon there that
is dark.
Now you can investigate that a
little bit further and you can
start to see, oh,
it's, I don't think it's the coffee
company. That's
maybe that travel center right
there. We zoom in a little
closer. You can see that it's
the travel center, it's
the pilot truck stop
across the street
and you can see the main
wild powers of usage
anticipate in that
cellular exon.
Uh And this is the type
of information that utilities
can start more creating to their
distribution sensitive planning
processes to get
ahead of these challenges,
but they can't do it under the
existing regulatory training.
So we need to change the goals of the
game. And that's really me
lifts
in
the power of New Mexico Act
has a number of important provisions
that find utility
system planning
with
federal laws and state
laws and regulations
that ensure that there's
not a disconnect. We want the
state is admitted to doing with
utilities and planning
because if we don't plan for
success then we're inuring
f it ensures
that the building one, building it
right building once the
right size and three
times cheaper than building
it, three times too small and rolling
the same brews the same place
with the
it avoids wires
and distribution system operators
where possible to use
of smart charging, smart
solar, smart
appliances,
virtual power plants
and ongoing discussions
about potential
build.
Um And
it ensures
uh tightening in
the
the the
fire with some
transparency
that is very much analogous
to the
uh virto docket that
the pr recently opened
up
about how long stating
to connect customers to the
grid and look forward
to seeing the responses by
the next month
by the 10 of that
way.
Um There are enforcement
mechanisms for all of this.
Uh There's a huge
workforce development piece of
the legislation
um And under consideration
potential workforce grant
uh development can
do what was codified in the
government called RA OFAC that
government bull as signed
data this year.
Uh And I will also know
that much of this legislation,
this model on the statutory
la trapped by
attorneys who work for
ID W and other lightning needs
in other shapes. A lot
of
the work force make this
job get
done,
right? Um
And then there is one piece of
this bill that is some
unique to the Power of Mexico
Act and it siblings
and neighboring states
which is building
upon ca
violence, one that was authored
by Senator
Patitz Rubio
required utilities
to file transportation, electric
plans subject to
review law by the PR
C. This with
similarly requirement
of similar plans
to help customers intalled
PS and other forms of
beneficial.
Now, this is the sampling
of the state and
Representative
and Representative
Dixson have to be
and biweekly
uh calls to
develop the policy
and ensure that there's draw
support for the
legislative session.
This listing of
organizations not comply
that everybody here is, you
know, signed on the dot line
under their logos where
it still undeveloped.
But that is, I think
show the
significant stable
outreach that
uh our representative
the for us and others
for Vol ONFI
under tape. And
I I also
in that um
and it has a number of
all f for the room and
beyond. So I think
we should have hopefully something
that, you know, has already been
fairly well before
the session starts.
Um
um I want
to touch on one thing. I heard a lot
of comments earlier today
about, you know, concerns
about rising electricity
prices and you might
think that um you
know, making great upgrades
to electrify
uh transit and
building sector
um will drive
electric rates.
The fact the
fact is that it actually building
a deep because
uh when you electrify
new boats,
we're not previously served by
electricity, you're bringing more
money into the electric system
that it costs certain,
always charge more
money than it costs certain
that is just the
way.
And this a
done in 2020 by MJ
Bradley and Associates for the
State of New Mexico.
Around $30
million net benefits
for the state of Mexico for
widespread evi a
option. The bulk
about it in red
comes from everyday Mexican
saving money at the pond.
Driving on a cleaner,
cheaper and
ali
cheaper
already regulates the world
oil barn. The
reg those
elect
keep your asthma going.
No
and one of the
eight other junks there to the
blue though that's utility
customer has about
$5 million in
c productions
and utility bills.
Because when
you bring in more money that it
costs to serve and
you're serving more kilowatt
hours that reduces the
price for kilowatt
hours and benefit of everything.
Whether or not they driving
so significant savings
benefits uh
exist for all New
Mexicans.
And this is not just a theoretical
proposition but an observer
of the hour this
slide here from Synapse Energy
Economics has
real world data from the past
debt demonstrating
that in every year,
the revenue showed
in greeding arms that has
come into the
invest
from
their ev
customer due to pay
their bill
exceeds the associated
costs. Now,
the total net revenue is
in the millions not of the
$3 million range,
which is accumulative result
all in the United
States. Uh but
it shows that New Mexico is on
track and then we're on the right
side of the budget and
then you know, the
future benefits in energy.
Grath.
Yes, are
ones that are within grasp
or the state of New
Mexico and it
pas over the
future
and that's a valuable thing about
and it's about ensuring that the
utilities do
not incur new costs
that are obligated
to incur they have to be, it's their
job to start their obligation
to serve, but it ensures
that they fulfill their obligation to
serve. I am afraid
existed of the
other laws and regulations
that I will close in the board
of
us.
That
thank you very much. I hope
we didn't take
our
to
>> thank you very much.
It's gonna be >> right in front
of
iphone.
>> Um So
I can
chairman numbers
Committee, the opportunity to be here
by a
Jim
the influence and
I am the executive
Director of the Renewable Energy
Industries Association of New
Mexico. And
basically after videoing
a short
presentation both
on when we radiated
electricity to our homes and
businesses with for
we keep it all
to
Energy Industry Association,
New Mexico is
we are about 60 plus average of
our development in
2004
and our mission is to support
wemo
transition
to energy
back.
So the next
slide,
yeah,
so really quickly this
slide basically escapes.
The solar industry is
a real industry
in Mexico and growing
industry.
And one of the,
one of the channels that we
have is
a passive because the
distribution levels is
where solar systems
are connected.
And when we have any issues
on those lines, it
affects our ability to
install systems.
And what that helps
creates uncertainty
in um makes
it uh installations more
risking and it becomes
a voluntary industry and this
is still
nationwide.
Next slide is one is the
hard situation. So
I just kind of this is a
reminder that our
grid is the
largest of the most complex
machine of
build.
But for the first
time in a long time,
already having low,
the bottom and low,
those
just used to electricity
and that's gonna happen
through
adoption.
And
also we electrification
is a big movement to
magnify our homes that we
can use energy. That is
a one thing I
don't have and it's
actually pretty new, but it's a
big thing as
stay,
you know, their faces as a big.
So that's the holders any
of those needs.
So, so also what we
have going
and the is require a
transformation
basal
resources
to point and solar
resources and those
of them require a lot of energy
stor, a
big thing. And this is a
big
environment
and is we can generate
energy at our
homes and businesses. There's
about 50,000
solar systems right
now doing just
a 5 million
nationwide. So
what I'm gonna be doing in my
presentation is to show how we
can take better advantage of that,
but we need some help on
that
and all of that. Is a
distribution point right
now. It's not
require to
be reported to the public
organizations. And
that's not the case
in many states. And that is
something I would suggest. It's not
the best practice.
So a large, most
complex pursuing
elderman needs to
be a man. And so
he had some works there.
Uh The in,
in Dodman still
almost $369
billion into the US
economy worldwide, two
years into a 10, their
uh plan on
doing that. So
that to
the the solar wall
and was announced and the collect
people are aware of that is also
whether home
energy so
that they got to
go.
This is a California do
curve, I think it was
the or well, but
basically what it says
is very important is that
at times we actually
constant in the way that
someone works in the middle of the day,
we're actually
generating
much energy and we need
to do something with that. And
so what we need to do is to
store that or later
when they say
that.
So
and by the way, this is
also having to
call.
So the this slide
talks about the important
distributed to
sources first
have and distributed
to sources
on other things, smaller solar
systems, all homes and
business and also in
those communities.
But to make that
work effectively,
we're going to need again
to upgrade the distribution
system. Yes, right
now
there is,
you know that you know, wanted to
stay out up are
needed. Uh Many
people have their own system
are requiring an extra
$2500
to do a second meeting with their
system. This is just for
small health
system community
solar system soin
fring
billions of dollars.
I think there was an article in the journal. So
$200
billion in
all
the first
today. So we need to deal
with this. But one thing I would
just like to stress in
the course of all distributors
and resources is that
unlike the utility
spills, which we
need, these
jobs are
ongoing. So basically
all the problems typically
will have applied for the jobs if
we want to keep
some of the jobs that are
constantly
um
out
that.
So these are some of the
ideas
to prove it doesn't bring
electricity. So first
of all, again, all
distribute plan,
we had a plan give
us later on
post incapacity
analysis. Basically,
this is really simple,
we can fix
what we can't see,
policy and analysis,
gives us the middle to see and
imagine what's going on in
distribution.
That sound magu right
now in the state of Mexico.
I all that three
later until recently,
one I always doing
it and doing it in the
very
um
a lot of very detailed
voice evens came
up.
The third role 0.9 here is
also very important.
This was also mentioned
by making a couple
presenters and the
cour we call the
house ca as model.
What that is, it says
you're a system on
your home and that requires
a new transformer for your
subdivision, you're
on the hook and inhaler that
whole transformer
regardless of the fact that other
people are not
benefit for. And
when we're doing large is
like solar systems,
it stay at a much larger,
larger scale you're in.
So this high
solar system,
OK. Guess what? That's how
cost $10 to
upgrade that subs
substation near
around the overboard even
though all. So
obviously, this is a very
inefficient V
to determine
it. What then basically
a and just
to um
a couple of things on your
Novis alternatives,
those are just all the ways
that we can have to pass
that we actually upgrade
the distribution lines
themselves, you know,
did a battery project.
And actually,
um it's an example
of that bicycle
conduction is an interesting
concept. So right
now, let's say that
you want to
um install a solar
system and have a certain
size and that size
and in screening. So
that size
or with class in that, if
we need
to a that
system at certain point
in time, that would be you
to install that. So in order
it's what it says, a
dialysis another
alternative.
And then I like the last bullet
0.9 distributor power
plan version plan. By the way,
they're the same thing, the instruments can
decide not gonna call
it. But what I like
about distributor power plant
is that they are on
and it's all the word sound
this, this
to those 50,000
solar systems that are
currently installed in the next,
if they all
it and by
the way, only 1% does.
So that's, but
the all and if
we have that,
that and
their to us. So the parts of the,
and we now
have a
big
power that consists
of many of
the. So
the idea is that this
se comes part of the
and then you
could dispatch that.
I think I know
which is bigger than
100
and
just occasional that
I'm not only a
time
I'm getting that is a micro VR.
So I think
that we can be
um, basically
what a micro is, is that
it's a southern
in of itself that's connected to
the main or it's
not sort of my
personal opinion. There are limited
applications for that, but something
really good application,
especially places that being
so
the fire
stations wage
hospital
as, um,
as all centers,
places like that, we definitely need to
keep
them.
Um, I, I go about
places and other than
that, there's a
lot of help on the table
there, dedicated
the biggest state
or
30% tax
credit. So that's going to be in
place for that
is
six.
Um Just some challenges
moving forward. I've all into a lot
of this already.
Um
that the current
glossal model is a
big issue, by the way,
one thing I wanted to, to
get a credit to
the seeing
the new
will they have in
there that on a
by space and
develop can share the
cost
on an all my knowledge
has ever been done. I think
what we do
to both a how but
maybe
put it in the process in place
that we can do that. But it
is a step before on
that.
Um
I think it's been mentioned here.
We're well aware than
most of our includes
of the revenue for the state in
the results of oil and
gas. We
believe in a just and
important transition of
our
b one of the
best.
This is a way to slide
on an energy storage,
like all of
us
1% attached
rates to something
that's what is going on in
parts of the country.
Most country is in the
lows,
California right now is
over 50%.
Why is like we have
a services
so we
have an incentive
that you put energy
sever out
of their
services. So
there's as much else I believe
there will be
in
2021
such.
But
this in as
all chambers,
the plus
bandage 2002.
And we
know what happened
standard
including
with
I
uh just the next
order
in the all out of the
next and organize that
there's a lot of stuff.
So
distributed
purchase models that
law pretty important and
then
store
very important.
Thank you for selfish. But I
tell
you,
thank
you,
Mr >> Chair. Does that
include
slides? I
see
that
I for me. Um
Thank you for the opportunity to be
here because this is a really
important challenge that we have
c I've been hearing a lot
about as, as
indicated, we've been participating
in the working groups about
how we up in Mexico.
But honestly, we're
hearing the
this lead coming
from, you know, and
gos and memory sector
and um
everything.
So those
things that we're doing touch
on this to
recognize the need
for increasing our
capabilities to that,
increasing our
transparency
planning, increasing the
speed at which the
concern we
causing concern and we
load. So
it's, it's really something
of focus for the Pr
C.
Uh
Mr de Chard
mentioned that we have
new Newish
interconnection rule here in New
Mexico. It
was uh passed
by as a city former commission
prior to the transition.
But then in early
2023 it was
one of the first a of this
new commission was to uphold that
rule. And I will
uh brag just a little bit.
We are the only state to
have received a
grade from
the interstate renewable
energy for
our interconnection to New
Mexico.
Is we
the? Now that's not to say that we all
struggle. Um
Transparency into
that is still a
struggle. And in
response to some of the
questions, earlier panels which
I'm gonna roll in here.
Um You know, it's
funny that that here sees Aquas
Judicial agency which
means the commissioners
can't rule on something
that's not an adult or
not. And so that
continues to be
something that we examine.
And as we're, we're building
the capacity in our staff,
we're also building the capacity
for staff to raise those issues
in Dockins for
commissioners.
So that is something in
which we heard
early.
Now.
Uh One
of the things that I wanted to talk
about here was
the uh
docket that the commission recently
opened up six Monte on their
own, exploring
these demands
for increased service
that were seen across the state.
Now, this relates to site
writings
relates to the
distributed generation,
which relates to providing
power to uh,
charging stations, it really
touches on everything. So
we've been hearing a lot and
that means, I guess you've been hearing
a lot this play that,
oh, you know, the PR C is
taking so long, um,
we can't provide service
in less than 15 months because
the PR C
trying to get things done.
Uh, so the commissioners
asked for a response
from the utility.
All, all three of us are
utilities. What are you seeing?
How much are you seeing?
Why aren't able to
interconnect them? Who have
you? Well, not, but how
many have been denied?
Really d into the
details about what's
happening so that we can have
some real data
to make informed
decisions going forward.
Those responses as much
syndicating are due
in that be and then
other parts so they can be
transmitted, they will be
the record and other
parties. N pr
my fellow analysts
and anyone else who has an interest
in it
and provide them into
the record as well. So
everything transparent,
everybody can have
access to the same information
and we can understand where
the needs are, where the
roadblocks are, what
really means now and
to move us
forward at least within,
with what's within
the
jurisdiction.
The other thing that's happening on the
PR C as it relates to this
is a kind
of
simultaneously
and, and even before the our
medical bill was on our
radar, the commissioners
had stressed the need for
distributed, excuse
me, distribution
planning to. So they
have uh undertaken
that process. It's a long
process by said,
we get 18 months. Once we
actually issue the rule, we have
not issued the rule yet.
Um or the notice
of rule maybe,
but it is certainly on the
commission's priority
list. And so it's interesting
that we're working with this power
of the, the group to
figure out
how we is our role,
maybe we can possibly
can complement
what is happening with
this initiative. And so that's something
that we're working on. And uh
the right, we, we see more of
each other next week or
early, later this week.
So, so how to work through
some of those issues? So the PR
C is actively
engaged, we're aware of the
issue, time to
create an evidence,
uh evidence
based
conversation around
us. Uh Specific
to RMX of the
IR
I would be remiss if my
job change that if I
didn't mention that
the brand
plans that were
infuriating from power up in Mexico
and other sectors,
other potential
legislation we
could do right now with the staff
that we have. So I do want
to put a bit of a footnote out
there that lots
and lots and lots of roads are due
to the PR C and that
increases the demand
on top of what we learn. So
that is definitely gonna be a challenge
for us as the,
our uh budget
request was submitted
before we got a
look at the power in Mexico
more. We got a look at a
lot of the legislation
was put around there. So
that certainly gonna be a challenge that
we're uh actively
thinking about and
talking about as
we move forward
because we want to
be helpful in the
process. Um
We know we know procedure,
we know the details,
we know how to get things
done. So we want to be
helpful in that process. But that also
means that we're gonna have to make
sure that we have the resources
that we need to
be helpful on the back to not
just on the
front.
And then last
my last note that I want to
make sure, I think that with everybody
is a lot of these topics
and more are going to be covered at the
PR C annual
seminar, which is happening
next week, Monday and Tuesday
at the Capitol um
there's a whole agenda,
the details in which it should be
released that, that you can
see the agenda on our website.
And I think it's going to be a very
interesting conversation because
there's actually
a panel led by one of our
commissioners on
Modern Tal who the
distribution day. So
that should be an interesting
conversation as well
as to development
with also ties into the dishing
machine. And so
um a little bit of a
sales which there, but I do
want to be uh
this panel assured that
we are aware of this. We are
working with state and
on top of that, we are being well
adit in the space trying
to get to the bottom of it and make
sure information is
available.
>> Thank you very much. I
never
been
um why the
main just follow the question.
Uh So I
keep hearing references to the
bill
wondering to see the
building.
There was a graph
in >> the last 38
session that
I think could be characterized as
a slim down version
of the Powering of
California powering up
called A
A. Um
We currently have a or
graft that is being
that with the
diverse
stakeholders
um that
were enlisted on the slides
and others. And if you
like to
be one of those stakeholders from
the gap here,
you
umer to representative
and
share with her colleague when
we are, you know,
trying to
get as budget as
possible. So
all the ideas, including
some of the ones that Jim raise are
consideration.
II I
um but now is the
moment to, to get
input and we're trying to be nimble.
And at this moment
as
uh there's not
to driving, I think
we're doing a dance, respond
to with the P to P
again. So we, we're
trying to make sure that we're
not.
>> So we have a,
I've been encouraging people to
get their bills
in,
in November. This
committee will review some
bills. Um
And
by interior the
legislature,
my interiors, her house
energy
of getting a
bill.
You know, we are two into a session.
It's not ready.
It's not a good way to do
legislation and
we have anyone
who have said this before.
So I apologize
for getting myself away.
Um You know,
it, to me it's a part
of
WMAR starts from laws
in the legislature and we
have this part time
volunteer, mid
session
legislature and
we get off Eagles and
we try to push them
336.
It's just not great. So
I
encouraging people to, to
front all that and
dividing the opportunity to
remember to do
at least an additional review of
legislation against the
legislation.
So I guess texting
represents
the, which is never
me down
any other questions.
Someone.
Ok. Thank you
all very much for your
business vision. Uh
I think, you know, we're
dwindling here on the
afternoon of the second day.
You know, I would know we got many
people watching online
uh in this uh
we recorded in our time,
so come back and
watch. So thank you
for taking the time
to.
>> So, >> thank
you.
Our last presentation of the day
is bring hydrogen opportunities
and challenges for sleepers
have been
more.
So, one of our presenters
is on um
and there are the last
on the list. Anyway,
uh
Have you read
>> uh Mr chairman members of the
committee? Thank you
uh for this is a
privilege and letting
you know a
lot of carsons that I
know
are served their to
house
electric is a diversified
over it. And we
actually have 30,000
electrics. We have
the broadband company
that has about 14,000 high
speed internet
customers.
We on a growing company
that has about
4000
members
in
July of 2022
in regards to build enough
solar to be
on 100% the
time solar
also adding about
25% of the
demand for the battery
storage.
Um We probably had
two more privates,
80 builds
the next 1090
Ws. So
facilities he wouldn't
need almost
nine
facility and
our hotels probably on
a lot. So
in the storage,
the Carson was recently
awarded by
the $24 million
grads
to
rre micro risk of
environment 80.
We have many
um
communities of the
river 90 by
legalist and
our biggest concern is
threating wallaby.
And so we want to be able to
address that til sta
point of making sure we
have adequate
resources to reduce
resiliency. Actually
give more chance to
um
by the fire. We have to
that we have to always
maintain
dru those
primary start
this.
And finally, what I would like to talk
to the committee about
is our Green Hydrogen
2004
Chevron mining. The
operation in the west
of that
area, they had probably mined about
100 years. So
basically mining was an
institution in west of
a wedding closed and
for good
300 plus jobs were
lost. It was
20% Kar,
right.
So the electrical is
also impacted
by disclosure
and all the support businesses
that support a
operating of that
size. And so
the past 10 years,
Payson,
Weta and Chevron
and the Economic
Development Board, ques have
been working on different
solutions. How do
we that
would be great jobs
in order to actually dealing with the
law of the
and the institution up
there? And so in
2022 we
got a grant to have
nail to study
nationality
labs. Uh We
also had said cells
work on different energy
projects and they fit in
that area.
And so we started
study on
as we I can work
in early next
for about a year and a
half, a
real study
that we had a lot of Republican meetings
and with a lot of different
groups,
groups,
groups, elected
officials. To
also be
with our
fund. Uh
At the end, the
study is we
need as fe
know, nice.
And so September
of 23 kick Carson
Biden
for
through the Ira
R A
program, we past
September, uh
we became a finalist
for about $96 million
in the building. So,
and basically the facility
is a distributed
hydrogen
um power
system. Uh
the main land
beu
Lion houses as
well. The
general concept for each of
you lands that was probably
not used for any other
purpose
that that is on
or about a tailing
facility. It is
also a
super fun site
under epa.
So in reality, nothing will ever have
been built or near that.
About
um for at least 40
years
in Taos, it's adjacent
to a wastewater treatment
facility that
serve a town in Taos
about 100
acres of
land that's getting
notable,
any other purpose.
And the Pueblo is that
there was a lot of the
facility
on the reservation
that
so we got to go around. The
second important phase
is all the
water, water is
in New Mexico.
So as you
reclaim for floats
water uh
adjacent to these uh
facilities.
So what the Chevron
May, the Chevron
Operation is actually in 22
locations.
The Mayan operation that is
between Westland Red River
and then the Tailings that is
adjacent to the building of
Western. And so
both our superfund
site and by
1978 we
open by into the
underground
Mayan operation
and when they close in the middle
of. And so
according to information, we
share off,
uh they take
out about a million gallons of
water they
and to release water treatment
mas. So
that's the water that
it is
working with going to
use to
power the, to be
in the water from the
process that and create a
high, it's
about eight miles
from the rest of line to
the um
to tailing
facility.
Uh There's no,
there's no reason to build
pipelines. So our, ours
is
the water
and put it actually in a given
time. And I think
that's Puerto because
the telling sits between
the National Monuments,
probably two or
three wilderness
coine, the
Hunger Wilderness, the
Filipino wildness of the
Fellows.
So besides being a reservoir
or holding
tank uh for
the water will be used. My
chance process
we also
need for the village of
and also as I mentioned
earlier, uh
for
wild prevention
between the two.
we've had fires all
around. We've had
the
mora in the os
two of them the
way they left the pass
a couple years ago.
So the Carson so far has
made them untouched in that
area. And
we find a lot of
work on the util
side to make
sure it's not a power
line that cos
the firework.
So building up our, our
education resources is
very important
at this location.
We also
believe build
solar on site, purchase
solar through PP A.
The solar will be the power
supply to
create the hydrogen
Weis. The hydrogen will
be
above service
um storage
and then released in fuel
cell
required by
um
but the system, I think
the other and, and it's the same
consequence in house that
we need to
put water and,
and it to the level that is required
by the metos
and then put it and then stor
it and then release the
fuel cell and electricity.
I think the other thing that is
really important on these
projects,
be designed
and to replace some of the
jobs that we've lost.
And seven days he craved his
supply chain of, of
jobs that in the
future. So we have
been working with
schools
U House or
Northern
College to
develop and
programs that the
skillsets that are required
for these three facilities
are done
local. And so that
we, we also, you
know, just build something for
just use, but also
to hopefully keep
young people in
awareness, we
face the same challenges all
the areas now as young
people are leaving on
the area and
then finally, these projects will
extend 10 car and so
fun.
And
today because
it a good maing by
couple speakers, I
think the co-ops have done a good
job in
uh be the goals and also
maintaining our race.
Kate Carson has had
had, has not raised
its rates for about
nine years. In
fact, our wholesale rate has
gone down
during this transformation
from what
our cars are, remember to
what
we
and so it
yeah
and closing
those chairman,
members of the
committee, this really
is an economic
development in
energy. Uh And
we think that is a good
solution to also get
some bandaids of
the EC A
or extended that solar
profile
that will help mitigate
fire,
it will help in education to
for our our young
people in the north.
And
hopefully it mentioned
place some of the law
we had with the
shadow mind which will probably
never open.
And so I think this is an
important project. Uh It
is a cutting
edge. There are new
projects in the
country that are
on this track. I
think one of the primary reasons
we're seeing a slow down,
I think is a lot of those
projects that rely
on the tax credits
that the federal government right
now is in DRT
mode
collapsed and get
with a direct pay.
And we've already got close to a million
dollars and waiting for the
federal building to make
this is not reliable.
So it, but also,
so this bank
of
thank you for that. Uh Nice talk
Michelle, you
know,
>> good afternoon
chair members of the committee.
Um Thank you
for, for
the issue with just
make my mind. >> So it works better if
it's, are you, so you sort
of talk? But
I
>> um the
reason why
we're talking about hydrogen
is uh due
to the
decarbonization
potential that clean
hydrogen pass. Um The
federal government anticipates
that um clean
hydrogen playable as in
carbonized,
25%
of global energy
related to carbon dioxide
emissions.
And not only
are um
their discussions
as to the
lowering of the
greenhouse gas emissions.
There are also very
real um
uh lowering
of criterias
as well. Uh
and and avoidance
of the pollutants results in the
transduction of fossil
fuel materially,
diesel
exhaust,
what's produced with an engine
burns, diesel
fuel. Uh
these kinds of
emissions have
toxic air contaminants
and other harmful
foods. And so the
US Department of Energy has
published a number of reports
um that detail
its vision as to the important
role of hydrogen
in addressing climate change
that are available. And
of course, um has been
maybe
uh available
through its hydrogen
Hub um program
and other program. I've learned
that the first
planning grants of the hydrogen
Hub program um of
course, by western by
western interstate Hydrogen
Hub do not get funded. But for
funding programs, those
monies are being
deployed the initial
planning phases this week. So that
money is already going out to
those scars that
um receive those grant
awards.
Um
Mr Reyes is right, the clean
hydrogen production tax
credit is really
what everybody is waiting
for in the industry.
Um This is a new 10
year incentive for clean hydrogen
of up to $3 per
kilogram. And the
level of the credit provided
is based on the carbon
intensity up
to a maximum of 4
kg of
co2
equivalent per
milligram of hydrogen.
And so there are
a lot of eyes
and there has been a lot of
lobbying at the federal level
for purposes of
what is
uh IRS
direction can be for
companies that are
ready to invest. And
so we do
understand that the IRS,
um, of course,
they, uh
the rules could be published any day
but we're anticipating them
by the end of the
year.
As far as,
um, state level
policy, the
new Mexico Environment
Department has um
promulgated as
promulgated and brought to the
EIB that was passed last
year, new motor
vehicle emission standards,
um,
that uh allow
for use of fuel cell
vehicles for purposes
of um cars
and trucks.
We have cleaned vehicle
tax credits for
purposes of
incentivizing
uh fuel cell
cars. And then
we of course, have
our um
clean transportation fuel
program that we are
in the process of
developing rules
for that will
um consider
uh all kinds of
clean fuels for
purposes of transportation,
including potential
of hydrogen. Uh so
that we can really
help um
clean fuels come
to New Mexico, we produce in New
Mexico and we used in New
Mexico.
The last thing I'll add is
that there are,
there is so much
economic development and
job opportunity
around
um
what is
occurring in the hydrogen space
right now um
using in recent
um in recent
weeks, Toyota and BMW
announced they are collaborating
on the development with third
generation fuel cell
system and
they're gonna be collaborating
uh as a first step
BM plans to launch
as far as NAS produced fuel
cell vehicle in 2028
and So what a lot of
us have
seen uh as
maybe being viral in the
future is actually
being planned for right
now. Um I just
read yesterday that
the uh
that Chile has
actually signed an
agreement to invest in green
hydrogen to fuel
uh passenger
trains. And so
these are the kinds of
investments that we
are really excited about, that could
happen in New
Mexico as
well.
And I think
it
OK,
Uh
Physics
spent
>> like
a
thank you very much. Uh madam
chair members of the committee. My name
is J Spent, I serve as a
principal engineer, acting
manager for Sandias
concentrating solar technologies
program.
So I'll be speaking to you
today about using solar
heat to address opportunities
in green hydrogen production.
Thank you for having
today
as a premier of a federally
funded engineering laboratory,
Sandia conducts innovative
research and development
to anticipate and
solve the most challenging
national security problems
which includes the issues with it. The
climate and energy
real
takes great pride in serving our
nation and our communities as
an impartial national
resource. We have a duty
to make our technical
expertise available to poli
policymakers
like
as a national lab located in
New Mexico, we consistently
seek opportunities to partner with
the private sector and universities
to transfer technology and
drive innovation in our local
communities. So they're
thankful for the
opportunity to, to speak
with the spot
on.
So I
I'll go ahead with through
my slides So I I work
in the uh I want to talk about
how low carbon fuels
uh can be made with CS.
Now, CS P is concentrating
solar energy. So a lot
of what you've heard today is
about uh photovoltaics,
also known as PE V,
these turn sun line directly
into electricity. But
we are working on
is aiming sun
miam mirrors to
a concentrated spot which
is really incredibly hot
heat that can be used for all
sorts of purposes from
thermal energy storage
and uh as a alternative
to batteries. And
uh in this case, we talk
about how to use that heat to make
hydrogen.
So go into the first slide,
uh I thought it
would be good to see you answer the
question.
That would be good to answer the
question. Uh What is
hydrogen used for
and why development creating
hydrogen technologies?
So what you see on
on the graph there is
is from the
uh the International
Energy Agency and it talks
about currently we make
almost 100 million
ton of
globally right now.
Uh less than 1%
of this demand was low
emissions and green
2023
and that resulted in 900
million tons of CO2
equivalent to be emitted in
2022. But that's just
what the current demand
there are future uses for
hydrogen. Uh We heard about
uh ideas for heavy
transportation, aviation
ships, trucks, passenger
vehicles, and industrial
heating. But
what we, what I'd also like to point
out is that we currently use
most of our hydrogen
for refining. It,
used petrochemicals
and a lot of chemical
refinements. Uh
ammonium that's used
in fertilizers
from
me and other based
che uh
and me. Uh
there is
also create through various
steelmaking processes that's
usually and combusted on site in
front of me. That's not what we're
talking about. This is just
manufacturing or
hydrogen.
I will know that
2023 transportation
was less than
0.01% of
total
hydrogen.
Next slide is a
uh
just to just set the framework
of what we're trying to do, carbonates
here. Uh
What what part of the hydrogen
process to CS P technology?
That so what you see is a on top,
it's the steam methane
reformation SMR
process. This is also one of its
gray hydrogen. It accounts for
99%
of the hydrogen made
today and it
is uh the only
that is at scale
for the current
amount of 100 million
to a year.
The way this is made if we want to
make one ton of hydrogen,
and this obviously scales up to
hundreds of tons a day for
the scale of a hydrogen hub.
But let's just talk about one
hydrogen to keep, keep it
simple. You take
two hyd two
tons of natural gas
plus 4.5
tons of water.
You add to it
500 or
50,000 kilowatt
hours of heat
3000 kilowatt hours of
electricity to
produce the hydrogen. Through that
state method information
process. Uh
the emissions associated
with this, there's about a half
ton of CO2
emitted from the
natural gas. That's a CO2
equivalent, not a CO2.
So if for example, methane
has 25 times the heat
traffic potential,
uh it will be multiplied by
25
by mass. Uh
Water purification
is somewhat negligible. So I can
include that there
using the current
breakdown of the New Mexico
grid. Uh We see
one time of CO2
equivalent from the electricity
and five times of CO2
equivalent from the combustion
heat. And then
in the process, you would have
hydrogen where the
process releases
5.5 times of
CO2. That's
what comes out of a flu
stack. Uh
and then there's also
a container. So a composite
tank that might have a
1.5 tons of CO2
equivalent for every
ton of
hydrogen.
Uh Most of those scale and
early with the hydrogen
79. So what's in the
turquoise dashed boxes?
Those are the areas that
uh is currently
working on for technology
development.
The green electrolysis
simplifies a lot of
this. It just has nine
tons of water for every
time that's hydrogen and
you add 56,000
kilowatt hours of
electricity. The
PD life cycle emissions
equivalent is 1 to
CO2 equivalent
uh per
year and then
the uh the time and it
is also the
tank.
So how can green
hydrogen
uh
how, how can CS
P help with a
stretched grid
infrastructure?
So the green hydrogen hub
makes, that makes about 100
tons a day, which was the, the
federal uh
benchmark
that require 200
megawatt transmission
for 100 and 22
kolts. So high voltage
lines are hard to permit,
have to compete with other
users. I believe we are
some speed
on that earlier. The
Sandias developing technologies
that could reduce the required
electrical loads, potentially
accelerate the kind
of by using solar
heat. There's a
focus sunlight to heater
with metal materials
that once charge
for the heat, they can split
H2O into
the molecules of the H two
plus. They can also
split CO2
to CO plus
so that you can then attain those
molecules and rearrange
them through common defining of
assessor to
others uh chemical
cycling fields. Uh
concentrated solar plants
can be installed in remote
locations isolated from
other infrastructure.
And when you add
CS E SPV,
you can improve
the efficiency by about
30% because you're
raising the temperature of heat
instead of electricity,
CO CS P alone
uh can also reduce the
light area by
20%
to get into the graphics. You
see the problem, right? If we take
a 291 plan and
you can plug that into
a 191
outlet that, that it
would be available.
So you, the sign
reflects off the meters
and hes these metals which can
help process the heat either
directly at you or
or indirectly through
uh uh Aing
or electrolysis process.
I drew a map there to show
what a 200 megawatt
plant might look like.
So it shows Santa Fe, you're
all familiar with this
kind of circles around the neighborhood
roundhouse from
Santa Lyta
Tosic's Drive.
And while that looks like a
lot of land, um and
it is a lot of land that is the
scale of how much
energy comes to the area in the form
of sunlight. So to convert that
into liquid fuels, it does tain
a lot of energy. Uh However,
this is also consistent with
other liquid fuels.
Uh So, so it's
uh in, in context it
it's it's pretty
comparable.
So what is UHS
fuel? How can hydrogen
be more
excessive?
Yeah, uh
atmospheric
humidity and carbon
dioxide can be
captured at
small scale. So this is one
of the most promising ways
to get feedstocks. It
is through the atmosphere,
direct capture
we can. As I said,
he these metal
specific metals that explain
H2O and CO2,
they create the uh
the elements that's
called sin gas or
synthetic gas.
The sin gas is
entered into a standard
refinery use
infrastructure
that has been around the
19 thirties. So it
retains all
that uh investment
currently. Uh and
then it can be used as a drug in
fuel once you refine
it, kerosene, diesel
or natural gas
and uh can be
used excessively
without having to convert
uh hydrogen combustion
technologies.
Last thing I'd like to talk about
is uh materials
for making hydrogen.
So it's a CS V
compatible with uh
various types of feed stock.
So natural gas, like I
said is 99%
of of
um Mar right
now, it is the only feed
stock available on scale.
And uh the problem
in natural gas, even though you
avoid the combustion
element doesn't in
Co2 out of the
process. And those
fugitive well emissions,
groundwater is another
potential. There's no carbon
emissions. It's used in the
Sun Time natural project
in the
labs 20 time.
But uh groundwater can
compete with societal
use. Competition
for groundwater
biomass is carbon
neutral and it is used in
prepart CS P
plants. So they're currently
doing this
at a plan German
right now, but it's
seasonal and the supply
chain dries up
direct air capture. As I
mentioned, it's available everywhere
right now. It's being used in
Swiss demonstrations, but
it's not gonna be at market
scale for several
years to read those
hundreds of millions of to that
that we're trying to
next is produced
waste. Uh Mr
Reyes talked about produced
ways. This is, this is waste water
that nobody is currently able
to use for other purposes.
Uh And this is great because it does
not compete with uh
existing
um needs
for water from society.
However, it does require
a purification process that
can have
cost.
So in conclusion,
100 million tons
of hydrogen per year are
currently needed
for refining
and chemical processes
that produces 900
million tons equivalent.
Co2 green
hydrogen technologies could
reduce this emissions if they
could be scaled up,
fast
concentrating solar heat could
reduce green hydrogen without
overtaxing the grid
by using the heat from sunlight
instead of electricity.
I also mention that A
CS D is used for thermal
energy storage
which allows it to
store mass elements
of energy without
uh batteries,
slipping batteries,
concentrating solar can
split water and carbon
dioxide into basic
building blocks and fuels.
And then existing refineries
can reform sin gride
to accessible
liquid fuels that utilize
existing infrastructure.
Also, Zambia has
a dedicated team of experts
who focus on the saving and
distribution of the hydrogen
infrastructure.
Thank you. That includes
uh I talked
a time members
of the committee I Mr
Chairman.
Thank you. My
last speaker is
online
Morgan
ordinary wiles.
>> I am.
Um, let me get my
slides set
up.
Are you all able to
see?
>> That's
good.
>> Oh, gee. Give me just a minute
to figure out slip screen
share.
All right. Are you able
to
see my
screen?
>> I can see it. It's kind of
small.
>> Mm.
Um Sarah,
are you able to
do a larger
size?
>> I think it's on
area.
>> Are you seeing the full
um
the full, let's
see.
She,
is that
better?
I believe
that.
Sorry.
I'm not sure if
I hope.
Are you seeing a full screen or
not? >> Uh
We, we see your slide. We
also, we also see you
and for public
online, these slides are available
on the legislative website
under the
name.
So I, I think that's pretty good
that you want to see.
>> Sorry. Give me just a
second.
All right, I apologize
for
that.
Um All right.
My name is Morgan Ro
and I would like to thank chair
mcqueen and members of the committee
for inviting me to present
today.
Um We at DF
believe that clean hydrogen
is a promising climate
solution for hard to abate
sectors, but it
matters how it is produced,
managed and
used,
it can be clean, but it is
not inherently climate
neutral
today. More than
90% of hydrogen
is produced from natural gas
or coal without anything
to abate CO2
emissions. The
Department of Energy has set a
goal of shifting this production
to cleaner forms
through blue
hydrogen, which comes from the
same fossil fuels, but
without carbon capture
or green hydrogen
from um
renewable energy,
the cost of these two
particularly green
hydrogen are still much
higher than gray hydrogen.
So several federal policies
including the production tax
credit and the
hydrogen hubs program
are designed to bring down the costs
to be cost
competitive.
Even among these cleaner
options, the climate impacts
can vary greatly depending on
several factors.
This spring edf
released our second peer-reviewed
paper on the topic which
discusses many of these elements
for both green and blue
hydrogen.
While green hydrogen is
generally the cleanest option,
it still has varying climate
impacts that we should be aware
of. And that's what I'll talk about
today.
The first factor
is where electricity comes
from
hydrogen production and
use is
a relatively energy intensity
energy intensive
process.
For example, for green
hydrogen, you're using
electricity to split a water
molecule, then
isolating and compressing that
molecule and then burning
it or combining it with oxygen
again to recreate
electricity.
This process is 3 to
7 times as energy
intensive as direct
electrification depending on
the application
like other energy intensive
processes. This has the
potential to put a lot of strain
on the grid.
Even if green hydrogen
is specifically relying
on renewable resources,
it could still be diverting
those existing resources
that are needed elsewhere,
causing the grid to backfill
with fossil fuel
generation.
This could cause emissions to
skyrocket. In fact,
green hydrogen projects could
have five times the emissions
of today's dirty gas
based
hydrogen.
The three pillars were
designed to avoid this
outcome of indirect grid
emissions.
This framework was included
in the draft hydrogen production
tax credit rule
and it exists in the EU as
well. It
requires green hydrogen
to rely on clean energy
that is incremental or
new hourly
matched so that it's available
during the hours it's being
used and located
nearby so that it's physically
deliverable with no transmission
constraints.
There are several benefits to
this. It ensures
hydrogen is truly
clean that it
delivers benefits to the power
sector by encouraging
investments in batteries,
transmission and grid
solutions
and it ensures investments
are sustainable in the long
run post tax credit
expiration.
That's why it's so important
to adhere to the three pillars
when sourcing green hydrogen
projects.
The next issue I'll cover is
hydrogen emissions
themselves. This is an
issue that matters for both
green and blue
hydrogen.
The hydrogen molecule itself
has significant warming
potential. It
acts as an indirect greenhouse
gas where it doesn't directly
trap heat like co
two and methane
does, but it increases
the concentration of other
greenhouse gasses in the
atmosphere.
Because of this, it
has a significant warming
impact which has been
confirmed by many sources,
including the IE A and
the
IPCC
like methane. Its
warming impact tends to be
short-lived. It
has 30 to 40
times the warming
impact of carbon dioxide
in the 1st 20 years
which then diminishes.
But this means that looking at
a 100 year time horizon
as we tend to do in
policy and analysis
will totally obscure the
impact of both
hydrogen and
methane.
Instead, we need to be looking at
both near and long term
time horizons.
The problem here comes from the
fact that hydrogen leaks a
lot. It's a very
small molecule and it's
leaker than methane.
It's also released
intentionally oftentimes
through venting and
purging.
Scientists and engineers
estimate that emissions rates could
range anywhere from under
1% to above
20%.
This can undermine the climate
benefits of hydrogen
for green hydrogen,
high levels of leakage
which is around
10% could
reduce the climate benefits
in the near term by
25%.
And again, the goal of
green hydrogen is really to
maximize our climate
benefits.
But there are ways to reduce these
emissions. High
precision sensors are
becoming available
and there are already best
practices that operators can
put in place to prevent leaks
such as recycling the
hydrogen instead of venting
it, doing reg
regular maintenance of the systems,
et cetera.
Lastly, I'll talk about
transport and end use.
One of the best things about
hydrogen is its
flexibility. It can
be used in a lot of different
applications in a
lot of different forms.
But the climate as well as
community impacts of
hydrogen vary a lot
based on those
things.
So some questions to pay
attention to. Um
first is there a better
alternative available?
That's the red to green
axis here
in general. If it can
be electrified, it should
be, it's more
energy efficient and will
cost ratepayers
less.
Another question to ask is
what are the air quality and
other public health impacts?
For example, hydrogen
releases, knock when it's
combusted. So in industrial
settings or combustion
engines, for example,
and ammonia can be
toxic if it's not handled
properly, which may matter for
shipping. For
example,
the use cases that currently
stand out as highest value
are replacing the
existing ones. So that's
in fertilizer and
refining,
acting as a feedstock
for steel and
chemicals,
providing high temperature
industrial heat
empowering ships,
aircraft and heavy duty
vehicles, but less so
buses and
cars.
Um Another thing to pay attention
to is how the hydrogen is
being transported to the end
use.
We have a new paper out
that explains just how difficult
it is to inject hydrogen
into the existing natural
gas distribution network.
It's a very different molecule
than methane. It
corrodes steel pipes.
Um and it's more
explosive. It
has a lower energy density,
making it inefficient and
costly. And
when it leaks, it erodes the
climate benefits,
that means we'll really have to
build out a dedicated hydrogen
network to transport it
rather than retrofitting the
existing natural gas
system. And more
importantly, we need to be limiting
its use to where it really
makes
sense.
I have a final slide here.
Um Summarizing the recommendations
that I just walked through.
Um One last thing
to add here that I haven't
talked about is that there's also a
need to conduct more research
into some emerging
issues around grain
hydrogen such as water
availability and water scarce
regions. I know several
speakers have sort of touched on that
before and then
um also the use
of pfos or Forever
chemicals in green hydrogen
equipment, which is more recently
being raised in some um
news articles.
So thank you so much
for having me and I'm happy to take
any questions or
respond to any follow-up
emails. My email address is
listed um on this
slide.
>> Thank you. Very much. Uh We're
going to meet first.
I know >> Mr
Chairman >> and a presentation.
Um I just have one
quick question
water. So
Mr Smith, in your
presentation said,
um do you
produce or wastewater?
Is it produced water? It's
not as we can use it yet.
Right? Much of anything
except for
oops.
Uh
>> Representative Mr Chair.
Thank you for the question.
Uh The,
the truth is produced, water
can be used. Now we
have a filtration. It
adds cost to it.
But I and
island areas that are only
from the grid. A lot of times
there are deposits
of water. Uh
those brackish
water uh sometimes
mining reclaimed
water such as
and so I think
filtering those
has a relative
small
uh relative
footprint. So I, I think
that filtering those,
those sources of
water is, is a good idea for,
for caring up a source that
is in
competition,
>> some determined to silly close
system.
17. So I heard
about it closed
system
water. That that's
not true.
>> So uh iii
I understand
the question when, when you
filter the water to make the
hydrogen, you're going to have
a waste of that
is filtered out and that
waste product is
difficult to dispose of
uh when it comes to certain
types of reclaimed
water, there's less
damaging than others.
So when it comes to
um solid
salts, you can, you can
um usually retract
those to salt patterns when it
comes to the mass
uh that isn't very
difficult uh
to, we're working
on using a concentrated
subway also to
uh decompose,
EHA. But that is a
very new technology.
So are
probably going to have solutions
in the next decade. But
at the moment,
>> but that's my second
question.
>> I have a couple of questions
also related to water.
So I've always
tried to wrap
my head around. A
thean
water would
be necessary to produce
nitrogen. And
so you
uh
um
slides
talk about water and
components
and I don't generally
deal with water
tugs. Um
but I googled it
and apparently
an acre full of water
is,
it's 12 to 1400
tons. Is that
correct,
>> Mr Chatter? Thank you for the question.
Uh I, I would, I
would defer to your
source on Google off the top
of my head. I can't
translate that but, but not it on
the uh putting together and
more understandable
terms.
So, >> so I, I
guess I was
a little disturbed that I found different
answers that
you think it is very
standard measurement.
Um We water
um But
quite a few times
and then if you for the water
and eight, your foot,
you know, you for the
water, I can say it
was more households
for a year. Um But,
you know, in terms of agriculture, we
need you can eat all the time.
Um
So
the idea of producing green Hygen,
the concern I've always had
that said we're in the
state and we'll
deal with water
resources.
But I was also told that,
for example, the four
corners area,
the amount of
water
receding
by the cessation
of coal mining
would be more than enough to
produce green
hydrogen
comms.
So the water doesn't seem to
be eliminate, water
availability does not seem
to be a limited
factor that
do, do panelists tend to
agree with that.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Uh In
my opinion, I I think
that
uh
the, the limited
resources of groundwater
and freshwater
uh
do you do cause competition
with, with hydrogen
production using it
for any industrial process that
doesn't return it?
Uh So a at
Sandia,
we focusing
on desalination,
water purification and
direct atmospheric capture
of humidity out of the
air so that we're not
competing with uh
fresh water
resources. Uh
However, those
technologies can't keep up
with 100 million times a
year uh just yet,
but I'm hoping that
uh that, that those
can arrive the near future
when it comes to maybe
a judgment
on on a
specific uh
source of fresh water
and ground water. Uh I, I'd
have to take that
offline and, and, and
um return, I don't, I don't
have an answer right now. Thank
you.
>> What I Mr Chair. That
one thing I should have
mentioned in my comments,
my comments was that
my colleagues in water
protection Machine of the
Environment Department have gone
through our water
we use to making
and are very much
concentrating their efforts
on a regulatory
framework that would ultimately
allow for
water to be used
for industrial
purposes so that the
groundwater industrial
abuse conflict is
minimized.
>> OK. Go back to
the water. You still um
so 100 million tons of
hydrogen and
that's
global demand. What, what
remind me where the 100
million tons comes
from, >> I guess that that's
global demand. The
other benchmarker
that you used to blood is
100
tons a day
as the hydrogen
hub
uh
metric.
>> Hey
brother,
there's a lot of, I'm not getting all
the mouths, right? But again, I it
doesn't appear to me that
water is a little bit back.
I mean, if we're talking
about 100 million tons of
hydrogen for all demand,
obviously, that doesn't all have to come
from me.
So we're talking about what hydro green
hydrogen adjustment in New
Mexico. I'd love to
know
what that means in terms
of the feet of
water
because it doesn't seem to be like it
that much, >> Mr
Chairman.
Um
They uh I think
you're, you're correct that New
Mexico would not be expected to
produce all the
hydrogen for the world
uh with, with our source.
And so I think the the
hubs maybe more of a
reasonable goal
for green hydrogen
uh when it comes to an
intuitive
scale of water,
um maybe
um less than 1%
of the flow in the the
on a for example.
So So that would be something
to your
mind,
>> Mr, in our
analysis through an oil
and so
over a 30 megawatt,
so a week for
48
to
that would be probably
24 hour
matter
charge. You
charge all
in.
It's in the whole, it's
not a lot of hard,
out of the million gallons down the mountain
daily use.
Right. I, I mean, I, I think
that's a,
that's an, an
around and so
48 ft is not
substantial amount of water,
but the grand theme of
things, it's not that much.
So, um ok.
So the next question related
to water is
uh that
Mr Smith, you
um
one of your slides said
purification, negligible
and is that
negligible cost or
maybe negligible
diminishment? What, what's, what
exactly is
the
uh
>> Mr Chairman, uh
the members of the committee,
the,
the uh are, are meant to talk about
CO2 equivalent
emissions? And the
statement is that
the uh that
the CO2 emission
equivalent emissions and creating
the filtration processes
for less than half
time?
>> Ok. >> So >> c
is eligible. That's great.
Uh What about cost?
How much does it cost to clean
water? Be able to use it
for
a
>> Mr Chand?
Uh
My understanding is that the
total cost of green
hydrogen right now ranges
between three and
$7 per
milligram, but similar
is about a gallon of
gas just to make it
simple. So for
3 to $7 a gallon,
what would be that equivalent
energy? Um
that would I I
don't have a breakdown of
what the filtration
is uh off the top of
my head, but I do know
that there are uh
desalination
targets for for
cost that I I could get back
to you
>> Mr Chairman
of.
So
currently what we're doing is we're using
the Me State University
doctor may to actually
the water source at each
location
type of appointment that we
wanted to use. So we
know that it's gonna take to
clean up the
exam also
that pum soon
as that
inward, she started
a couple of weeks ago
and Maad finished
up her analysis and
for
about a model. So
once we
have
Naturals
Rizer, they all know what the cost
of the pery
so maybe very based
on.
>> Ok. And, and then that
makes perfect sense. And I guess
if we, I'm sorry, it
is
to produce green hydrogen. It's
not all that much of
water
cost is gonna be a
factor.
I would love to use
dirty water to produce a crane
diversion.
But I think you're gonna have a
significant layer of
cost
as opposed to Fred
Walker. So
when cook comes to show in
the marketplace in the
industry, why
would an industry simply love
for
rather than going through the
additional expense
of cleaning
produced in the
work?
>> Mr Chen? There is the committee.
Thank you for the question.
My understanding is that
the
uh J uh initiative
of the tax rate
of up to $3
per kilograms meant
bring that cost
down conventional
hydrogen
costs.
Uh So, so that could
offset some of those
costs when it comes
to market adoption. I
think you're right. Fundamental
economics would suggest the
the cheapest
uh the
stock would
um dere
uh the lowest cost
product. Um
And
uh that,
that, that I will contest. I
will, I will say that that
Sandias looking ahead
at developing
technologies to
to
bring down the cost of
desalinization and direct air
capture so that as
the water
resources become more scarce in
the future, there are alternative
technologies that can
uh not
compete as
much.
>> And I appreciate that
from a scientific
research perspective, we should be
looking at those things but in terms
of ramping up great
hydrogen production.
Now,
I, to me
that's like a certain budget
for the future.
Um, like, I
don't think we're making great
hydrogen through
the water based feed stock
that were pulled out of the
air.
I just don't,
it's hard to imagine that's
feasible
in the area.
>> I agree with that
statement.
>> Um, when you do
clean up
water,
I mean, I
imagine
with amount of water you start
with, we have,
you end up with some very nice
clean water and then you
end up with something
else,
which is a concentrate of
what was in that
larger one.
What do you do with
the
drugs if you
will, what do you do with what's
left over after you clean the
water
>> member of the committee?
Um, an
introverted my colleague at the
environmental,
uh,
uh, the, there
have been problems with
desalination of
water where they've
released a salt
into the ocean
too close to the,
um, to the shoreline and
it has caused, uh,
impacts with, with the
wildlife in the
ocean. Uh, so
they, they moved it out
to the middle of the ocean. Uh,
and that had a
million effects. I, I think
that's, that's one thing you don't
wanna, you don't wanna put the
concentrated,
uh,
saltwater and high
is water back into the
environment where it can get into other
water supplies or, or
nature.
Um, one
of the things we work on that
Sandia,
um, deep
storage and in
uh undergrounds, all
covers and we have
a car
bat area work a
lot of those underground
storage and, and geological
formations uh
for
co2
hydrogen and,
and uh uh nuclear
waste storage. And so
uh the ability to develop
that uh into
a repository for some of this
is, is good. I will also know
that there is a sinkhole
cause that, which was cause
by water
that dissolved to some of the
salts and, and put
in there. So, so putting the ligament
water under around
and
notable, but
um I I'm not
necessarily an expert
on, on exactly what
to do with, with the risk
of practical
training.
>> Um Chairman members
of the committee, I'll just add
that. Um I think
my assumption,
um our general assumption
up until this point is
that uh primarily
freshwater would be used
for hydrogen, green
hydrogen production
um that there's still
research on going
into alternative
sources of water
as well as what that would
entail in terms of
um treatment of water and
then disposal of
water afterwards. Um
I think there's
generally, you know, some
skepticism about the ability
to use, for example,
wastewater from oil and
gas facilities
to, you know, to,
to um be the
source for green
hydrogen. Um So it's a
really good question. We have some
research ongoing on
that. Um And
sorry that I'm not able to provide
more, more details at this
stage. Um The last
comment I'll say is that
I think the, the consensus
in the research at this point is
that in general,
um you know,
green hydrogen
is not expected to pose
a widespread
water
shortage concern,
but that it may
need to look, it may need to
be looked at in particular
localities where
there is already water
scarcity. Um
So when you, you know, when you
look at just green hydrogen
versus whatever fossil fuel,
it's replacing the high,
the water usage is actually
better typically than the
fossil fuel water usage.
But that again, it
may, there may
be diff different circumstances
in particular um
parts of the world and
>> states.
OK. Thank you for
that. A couple of questions
for Mr.
Um you talked about
pumping water from the the
line uh
which
uh
requires some
treatment
that water to be treatment before
it's pumped
to iate >> of this
chair, members of the committee.
It's current to be treated
right now. That's why
the test
see by the period
treated water out of the
line is that will
determine it needs additional
treatment, that
treatment.
>> And, and
um one
additional question here
and the,
the project that
you pick up the finals for.
Sounds fascinating
and it's great that finalist
and $96
million is a great
investment. Any
idea like how many finalists
there are? Are
you
or a sense of
how likely you are to actually
receive the father? >> So,
so this chairman of
uh members of the committee, we're,
we're basically competing against
ourselves. So
the, the
um
the money has been allocated
to the project. There are two
issues that we have to address the
USDA
versus we had to make
sure that the greenhouse gas
emissions is a target
being on.
So this project
will reduce
it by 20%.
That's on top of
already 49% 9
ir
solar projects. So we feel
comfortable there. The
second is virtual
availability
of the not.
So there's a lot
of European
countries
that are doing this
already. So we
feel pretty confident, I would
say, you
know, 95 96%
of that we will get by.
And those are the
22 basic issues
we have to address. And when it's already
the second,
we do have
uh experts and the
industry
getting us data
on existing
bats. Basically,
the question is,
can hydrogen create
elect?
And the answer is something
then show
that data to
you as a pretty
confident that little win until
that
work.
>> So that sounds a very honest.
I'm happy to hear that.
Um It's, it's good
that um
colleague represent
Townsend Scott
uh are with us.
Um They love to talk about
the unavailability
of uh r
energy times a
day that the
sun does not shine
at night. We all know
that um
uh heavy
metal batteries are
expensive and
have a heavy impact
on the environment. And
apparently
the battery installations
provide about four hours of
service, which also
doesn't get like,
um it seems to be
that, you
know, green
hydrogen on
a
uh
with water,
water he
or duty as it heats up
uh solar electric
energy or concentrated
solar as a
power bill is a way
to produce hydrogen
that is effectively a
pattern, can produce
that hydrogen during the
day
and use that hydrogen during
light and you can
create a special
source >> of energy.
>> And so I think that's really
interesting.
Uh And
that's
>> just add to that, that, that is
in a 20 point. We think
Carson has batteries and
four hour batteries.
I think they are probably the most
expensive aset we
operate.
Um This is a
24 hour battery
and we could scale it
based on the amount of
storage. So as I
heard various speakers
talk about
five days storms.
This is designed in
the future to be able to weather
that storm by
charging
solar, that
story to, to
anticipate
those down between red. So
we and this
fire membership in the right
along the lines.
We also build a reil
network
museum.
So
>> thank you very much. I also
the committee uh
that stay to the end
and that the thing online.
Uh Our last
interim committee for Water and Natural
Resources. It's in
November, it's
Monday and Tuesday,
Thanksgiving Week.
Uh The current plan is
to spend a day going over agency
budgets and a
day going over
legislating. So that
you're listening and you have a
bill ready to be
uh reviewed.
Please get in touch with
me. I had
a little moment at the end that we
would have that bills ready
and now I'm sort of flipping to the
other side that we have more
bills than we can possibly
hear that. So,
um uh your propose
to me and we
agenda
uh and thank you all
very much. Thank you to our staff. Thank
you to the hotel. We
are,
00,
I was halfway out the
door
to do we have inside of
public comment
if there's anyone online
on the zoom and I can't see the
zoom. But if there's anyone that
uh would like to make public
comment, you
can raise your, to raise your
hand
function.
No, not
