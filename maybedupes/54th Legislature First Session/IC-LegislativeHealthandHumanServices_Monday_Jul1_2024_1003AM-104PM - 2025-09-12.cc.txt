Physicians are what
we do and we'll
recruit anywhere between
2030 or
so physicians a
year to the State and
the J One Visa program.
And we created that
program
back, I believe in
1998
against a lot of
resistance here in the State.
People saying, oh, we
can accommodate people, uh
international medical
graduates to come
to our
town because they're not
culturally fit. Well,
guess what? The State of New
Mexico recruits 30
international medical
graduates a year.
That is a huge
source of our
specialist.
The last two years,
all 30
have gone to
rural locations,
not to Albuquerque, not
to Santa Fe, not
to Las Cruces, not
to Farmington. Even though they have
needs all
30 of the last
two cohorts
have gone to rural
communities.
Um
I'm probably gonna commit a
sin
here.
I'm on every
workforce Committee
that there is and
I have been for 30
years
and we get engaged
in those committees and saying,
oh, we need to have
this, we
have
5000
vacancies
for
uh
physicians.
That's meaningless
it. It, it really is.
The, the real
measure is how quickly can
you get an appointment with the
appropriate provider.
So I'm gonna, my sin
is I'm gonna disclose
something to you.
Uh,
on my handout, I
say that on
July 26 there
were 671
vacancies that we
were aware of in the
State
three years ago. That would have been
200
six. And most of
this summer we've been above
700
vacancies,
vacancies
for physicians.
Real no, for, for
the, for all the whole
spectrum. Yes.
Yes. Senator
of them. And we don't
really recruit behavioral health
folks. 100
and 64 of them
are, are coming
from organizations
saying we have
real jobs.
If you find
somebody,
we'll hire
them.
Those are real numbers
and they're very meaningful
to me.
Um,
it took me a year and a
half to find, uh,
an orthopedic surgeon
to do my knee
replacement.
And
that's, those numbers
are huge because that's
saying that people are not
being treated and
there are jobs available.
Now, you might want to ask,
what does that, how
representative that is
the State? We don't work
with everybody
but we work with everybody
who contacts us
and says, hey,
we need this,
that or the other thing they can
go on to either of the web
pages that we
run and tell
us. Exactly.
And one of the things that we do
is a little bit different
that I've never heard
discussed in the,
in this Committee
is every three months
we ask those,
those businesses
are you still
looking?
And of course, any
time that they have new
vacancies. So that,
for example, yesterday,
we had two new social worker
positions uh pop
up that I I
was notified about.
So
um be
aware that we don't
work with every
organization
and going back back
to that uh social
work number out of the
164
100 and
five of them are master's
level social worker
openings that we're aware
of.
Um
We do
spend some money
uh of our own
money, for example,
uh working with the NASW
job board
and reaching out to
candidates
that uh look
like they might be
of interest to New
Mexico. Uh The
vast Majority of
people that we find
are not in the
State. We don't
do a whole lot of
advertising other
than going to the school
programs
to,
to do outreach if you
will, because we will not
recruit someone away
from an existing
organization. We
just will not do that. That's
the head hunter
side of things
and we don't engage with
that. So
what do we do? We
act, act as a match.com
of health care. Uh
We don't hire
anyone. In fact, the
statute that governs our
work precludes
us from hiring
anyone. So we
can't, we can't recruit
and keep them and
compete with the
practice next door.
So we are, we are
bound by law to be a
referral agent. We
try to make it easy for
candidates. Uh
And for organization
that really uh those
organizations can't
afford to do
the level of recruitment and
sourcing that
we can do and
um I will commit
another sin as
well.
Hr Is the
enemy of
recruitment.
Whenever recruitment
is housed
in
human resources,
it becomes very
legalistic
and
dysfunctional.
So I'm I'm a
multiple sinner. So
please please ex
excuse me on that,
on that part.
Um
We do attract
people from
every State. I,
I can tell you
as one of our speakers,
uh
uh
this month at our
annual meeting
said
the 51st
State for
finding
physicians
is
India.
The bulk of those
J one Visa physicians
that have
been hired by
organizations in the State
are from India and Pakistan,
but mostly from India.
And that is true.
Uh nat uh
nationally,
we do some other things.
We provide financial
aid resources to
candidates looking for
work. We
do do individual
career counseling.
We, uh it's
amazing in dealing with
young people. They don't know what
the systems of, of care
are. They don't know what an
HMO is, they don't
know what fee for service is,
they don't know what private
practice is
necessarily. So
we try to help them
with uh about the
uh systems of care.
We also work over
their
uh uh resumes
and CV S to
help them not
make errors.
Uh in case you don't
know, uh
a resume stops
people from getting jobs
it doesn't help the in
health care. It does not
help them to get a, a
job. What it
does. If it's a good
resume, it gets
them to the second
person
who can make a
decision to provide
them with an interview. The
first person or a
computer
looks at the
resume
and looks. Well, hey,
does the resume really
reflect what we
advertise? It
doesn't pick up
necessarily,
uh, the,
uh,
cues that
an individual might give off
in terms of how they, how
they might fit. We also
interview candidates.
We, we do them by
zoom uh
frequently
and we also
um um
do them in our offices
as well. Uh
The major sources
of financial aid. The
number one question that I'm
asked, I've heard a lot
of
recruitment issues
over the last three
years. Uh 30
years,
most of them I never
hear from the candidates
looking for work.
What I hear are
two things.
Is there loan
repayment?
What's the call
schedule?
Those are the two things,
year after year
after
year.
I, I know you have someone
from uh HED
coming might be talking
about loan repayment.
But um
next week, we're gonna look
at about
1500
loan
re repayment
applications from
people already working
here in New Mexico. And what
you all did increasing
the amount of loan
repayment is
phenomenal.
And I hope in the
next section
Session you add another
20 million to,
to that because you have
continuing contacts.
But it is clear
that providers in
New
Mexico
need that
loan repayment support.
We see dentists
coming out with
$600,000
of debt, educational
debt.
We see
um uh
physicians coming
out with 3 to
$400,000
of debt. Now it's less if
they went to UN M
but um
debt
in, in that loan
repayment
and it's not confined to
physicians. If you look at nurse
practitioners, they're
coming out sometimes with
$200,000 of
debt.
You gave the workforce
a pay
increase
two years ago and then
you did that again
this year and
the results have
uh three years
ago, we funded
45. I believe
the number was 45 loan
repairs. There was a million
and a half dollars.
Last year, there were
about 725
who were funded
and we ran out
of rural
applicants.
It'll be interesting this
year, if the word
got out more, more
effectively got out to
rural providers
that, hey, there is
loan repayment available to
you at the State level.
Uh, we are
also a
very
much a long term
high employer
of National Health Service
Corps. Uh,
obligated folks,
we on any given
day have 300 of
them in the State.
Uh It, it's
hard to say
exactly how many because their
contracts start their
individual contracts and they
start and
stop uh at any particular
time.
And uh
the
Department of Health has
a, a program,
the New Mexico Health Service
Corps that I'll get to in, in, in a, in a
minute
going to the issue of
loan repayment.
Uh Health
resources with
35 other
states is
involved in a longitudinal
study
of uh loan
repairs. Uh
Hedii,
I was able to convince
them about three years ago
to get involved in this
study.
Uh
Since
2011,
we've asked
incoming loan
repairs,
um what they expected
of their practices,
what was gonna happen when they
go to Red River
and then
when their contracts
end, we ask
them, what were your
experiences?
One of the big
findings
that we have
come to and this is
both New Mexico and
nationally is
that loan repairers
start looking for
work within six
months of the time that they
start.
And this goes to
the issue, the really
big issue which is
retention.
You can't
OK. Another
sin.
Um
jargon
from
recruitment,
you can't
stop
onboarding a health
professional.
The day that they
arrive,
it's got to be
planned
out.
We used to help
organizations
create retention
plans
to help them
make sure
that they're doing
something to retain
the people whom they
hire
those
8586
placements that we had
last year.
We're on a hamster
because we're replacing
the, the same
positions,
year after year
after year, after
year in every
community in the State
that we can, that we can get
to. And by the way, uh
last year, uh our
referrals ended
up in 1818
of our counties. Uh
a lot and a lot of those
professionals might
work in multiple
counties. We just, we
just record where the home
office uh is
if, if you
will,
can I continue
committing sins? Uh
Mr.
Chair?
So I'd like to,
I see
I am I eating up all of
our time.
OK.
Um There
are a lot of myths
out there
about recruiting health
professionals.
Um Number one is
just recruit,
no, you have to recruit for
retention, you have
to have a workforce
that uh
feels that it's
needed.
Um
Money is an
issue but money
alone I
is, is
not the only
thing. Uh There
are a lot of health professionals
uh in this State
who
have expended
their entire careers
here
and that
those people tend
to work where they feel
appreciated that
longitudinal study
that we
were in the, in the process of
doing
points out that a lot
of people don't, a lot of
people don't feel connected
to their communities
or that
their families don't
feel connected to their
community communities.
And part of retention
is working
with, uh with the
families. I'll share,
this is the sin. I'm gonna share
a personal story.
Um My
daughter-in-law is
an ob
and
um
both my daughter-in-law and
my son are
lobos,
died in the
Wool lobos.
And um
my daughter-in-law,
I made sure that she knew
about every loan repayment
program that available
in New Mexico. Um
Well, so she
would learn in residency that she
had to come back.
Well, one of the best offers
she got was from la clinica
de familia in Las
Cruces.
Well, my
son and my
daughter-in-law
are a different shade of
red
if you will. And
you know what Lale did,
they recruited my
son, they
recruited
my son
just as hard
as they did my
daughter-in-law.
And that kind
of effort
and continuous
effort
needs to have
to communicate to
people that they're working in
health professions.
I will tell you one
little piece that I'm aware
of in
recruiting about
the workforce.
People are worn
out
since COVID
people are wor
absolutely worn
out. The 01 other
thing is everyone
is looking for
work
dollars are a
big deal.
A year ago,
the average family
physician in the not for
profit world in New Mexico
earned
$207,000.
This year, the
national
medium
is 240
and I see offers
from private organizations
approaching 300,000
for family
physicians. So money
is important and people are
aware
that there
is more money
available and there's
more money available in the
urban areas
if you will.
Um I've already
spoken to increasing uh
uh primary care
providers, especially
prescribers.
Um
You know that there is a
shortage
of physician
assistance in rural New Mexico.
And at, at, at one
time, we
are we the leader
in this, in the country
for rural physician
assistance. Why
is it that
we don't have so many
out
there?
We don't have enough
physicians to
supervise
them.
I wouldn't be surprised at some
point. There'll be Legislation
saying, hey, um,
maybe the kind of
supervision that we
uh require a
physician assistance might
be, might need to be
changed.
Um Who
is the best recruit?
The best recruit is somebody who
is already there.
If you have a
nurse
working for you,
why not spend some time
working with that nurse
or the nurses
to make sure that they
stay
as opposed to
one of the weird things?
Another sin
I should have just entitled. This whole
thing is sin
is that organizations
in New Mexico will
allow for
vacancies to remain
open, hoping
to find the perfect
candidate
rather than hiring
perhaps someone who isn't
precisely
perfect,
but who
can be trained
who, oh, who May be
able to learn a language
that they don't speak,
but they will keep
openings open
for a long
time.
I'm concerned
about
retention in
the sense that I
see in some
of the disciplines that we're
walking back 30
years
in various areas of the
State
that the
lack of
providers
across the board.
I see it most acutely
in dental
because I spend a lot of time
recruiting dentists, dental
hygienists and dental
assistants. But
it's, it's everywhere that
things seem to be going in terms
of the, the, the level
of concern.
Um,
everything works and
nothing
works.
You can build a
building,
legislatures
are really good
at building
buildings.
That doesn't mean that one person is
going to stay in New
Mexico.
It doesn't.
Or you might, if
I quote,
uh, Dr
Richard Larson,
who
used to testify
before this Committee,
we can't educate
ourselves out of the
hole that we're
in.
The, the numbers are
too
overwhelming.
Um,
I'll tell you another personal story
and it's behavioral health which
makes it, let's
see,
I got a
pen
and I used to run a psychiatric
hospital
and I
went to
Clovis
and I called on
the,
uh,
uh,
on the court and
the juvenile probation
office
and, um,
I left a pin
with the name of the organization
and my, and the phone number of the
organization
with a, uh,
juvenile probation
officer.
Two years later,
she was going
through
her desk
and she found my
p,
and she called me and said,
we don't have any
providers.
Do you all think that you could
take our
kids?
And that's an example
of something
really little that you
wouldn't think
would have an impact
on health
care access.
We spend big,
big dollars
on things and
I would just like to point out
we're not spending much on
recruitment at
all. Now,
be aware, I don't,
I don't know anything about what
Medicaid is doing
and what they think they're
doing with uh with
recruitment,
but I don't think it's working
whatever it is.
Um
loan repayment is not.
I said it was the number one
question. It's not the
only question.
Um
There has to be a good
fit and
people have to work on the, on
the agency
side, the practice side, the
hospital side,
the employee
side, they have to work
together and
make that community
fit and
um
probably the principal
background
issue for
me. Uh I grew
up, I grew up where there were
dirt roads and not
in New Mexico but
uh there was no
town,
nothing at
all.
Guess what? People with rural
backgrounds are more likely
to come to New Mexico
than people with urban
backgrounds.
Even people going
to Albuquerque, Las Cruces
and Santa Fe
with rural backgrounds
are more likely to take a
job if, if you
will.
So um
not belaboring it,
I would make a
recommendation as I've
had now for several
years increase
by 2 million there. I
don't know the mechanics. I
don't know the
details.
I don't think I want to know uh
how, how
you all do that, but there has
to be more money in, in, in
recruitment.
Um
there needs to
be money for
behavioral health recruitment.
There isn't any.
Again, I don't know if
HSC is putting any
anything into that,
but only the Department of
Health really is
making it possible
for there to
be active, what I call
active recruitment.
Uh At one time, the new
Mexico Health Service
Corps uh
had $750,000.
I think it's been sanded down
to about, I don't
know if there's 200,000
there. If you take
uh the example of loan
repayment, uh
being uh something
that, that people
health care providers
respond to.
Um, if
you are a nurse practitioner
student, a dental hygienist
student, if you're
a, um,
a physician
assistant student,
more than likely
you're gonna have to quit your
job.
Uh, nurse practitioners, for
example, they, they're
RNS and
most of them work
as RNS and then make a
decision to go
into graduate
education and they
give up a lot of, many of them give
up uh their
incomes. So
back in,
I want to say 94
and 95 when we
created the new
Mexico Health Service Corps,
it was really oriented to
those types of folks
where they could get
a stipend.
And I think the amounts
vary by, by
discipline. It's, you know,
between
40,000
by uh by
discipline.
Um, that
is
that they can use for living
expenses. They don't have to put
it to their educational
expenses. Um,
and then there's a second
component of it, which
allow, which goes to,
which hasn't been in place
for years, uh,
which is to
supply
to, uh,
competing
agencies
to, uh, for example,
pay for continuing
education to
buy books or,
uh, these days
access to,
uh, journals on the
web and which are very
expensive, but
I would see, uh, putting
some dollars back
to the Health Service
Corps.
Um
The last two are
probably pretty
personal in
my observation.
Uh I
uh I, I
think that
New Mexico
domiciled
MSW students
should attend with no
tuition.
I think that that is
important.
I get a
lot of
resumes
from people who
attend New Mexico
social work schools.
This is a big sin.
OK. So this is a big sin. They're
not going to be happy with
me.
I get resumes
that say such
and such. I'm in
such and such program
in New Mexico.
And then I contact
them and they say,
oh, I'm in New Hampshire
and I'm attending
via distance
ed
again, I don't know
how higher Ed is
funded more
than I know how Medicaid
works. But I knew
do know
that if in New
Mexico,
I got my entree by the
way into New Mexico by
working in a combined
sociology, social work
and anthropology program
at New Mexico State.
And I had attended
a social work program in
Chicago before
coming here
and I can tell you that
it social workers
are powerful.
The other um
piece is, I think we
need to assure
that the BS W
students
are
appropriately
licensed
and that people
who are providing
social work ser uh
services
really are social
workers.
And Mr. Chairman, Members of
the Committee, I probably
talked way too
long and I committed many
sins. And
if you would pardon
me for that,
I would really
love to
answer any questions
at all.
>> We'll, we'll withhold absolution
until you answer the
questions.
Um,
so, uh, we'll,
we'll, before
we go to the Committee, I just wanted to,
to let everybody know
we have not introduced
ourselves and we
didn't start till 930.
So we're not that far behind.
So don't panic. We will
catch up.
Uh,
and, um, and,
and before we go to questions, could you
just explain something
about the New Mexico
Health Service Corps?
I have to tell you, I, I
have not heard anything
about that
in the last
six or eight years that I've been
on this Committee. What
is it? Does it still
exist? Who runs it?
How much money do they get?
And is it actually
placing people
in a,
in, in
clinics and
agencies?
>> I talked to a
chef,
Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee back
in, I, I believe it
was 94 1994
95.
This Committee was very
active in
um
coming up with
um
broader access to health
care and working
with health
professionals.
So, um at
that time,
about
$500,000
were appropriated to
the Department of
Health.
Uh It was
administered uh
at the beginning and still is
through the office of Primary
Care and Rural
Health.
Um Two or
three years
later,
some of us uh
advocated
for adding
dental to
the new Mexico Health Service
Corp.
Uh So there were a total of
$750,000
there there
are three
components
to the Act as I
recall,
not all of which
have been implemented
in, in all those years.
One is
providing
stipends
to people
in their
last two
years of
training,
actual
stipends
and for example,
um primary care
physicians are included,
they can get a stipend
of
$25,000
a year for two
years. Uh
each year they have to
apply.
Uh if
they get an
initial award,
they must uh
practice
at a and
other disciplines are
included.
Um
They must
practice at a site
approved of by the
New Mexico Department of
Health.
There is a
second component
of, of
the uh
uh of the act
which are called community
contracts
and that was intended
to give not for profit
organizations the
ability
to pay
for things
uh that
would encourage retention
if, if, if you will.
So uh
some advanced training
uh and those
awards were made
on um
on RFP
basis, uh
$20,000
I think was the maximum
that were, were ever
allocated at any given
time. And then a third
component which was
never implemented.
Um
And
uh
there are a lot of reasons it, it
wasn't but actually
to hire
people
to
um
cover for
emergencies
in, in the State.
Uh And that
the Department of Health would
actually employ
uh people and there was never
enough money in the, in
in the program
to
uh
>> but it's still on the books,
>> still on the books. There are a couple,
I think a couple of $100,000.
So >> if we just funded it
more, the Department
of Health, for example, could
hire an
OBGYN and place
them in one of the hospitals that
doesn't have
Obgyns
>> Mr. Chair. I would use a
different
example.
>> Well, that, I mean, that, that was the one
that came to me because we have that
northeast quadrant of the State
without any Obgyns
in the whole
quadrant.
>> It's gonna get worse.
>> Thank you for that
cheerful.
Why do we invite you to these
things?
If we wanted the truth, we would
have asked for the
truth.
Oh, gosh.
>> No, to be serious, Mr.
Chair.
Um
OB has become
an urban
profession.
It is an urban
profession.
If you don't have nurses,
you can't have
obese.
That's, that's a rule.
If you don't have five
labor and delivery
nurses, you
can't do
ob
you can't. So
it's not just
obese,
it's all of
the other disciplines that go
along with
that.
Um
>> All right, let's go
to the Committee then. And I think
representatives block
Jones.
So, uh,
Rodriguez.
Ok. Why don't we just start?
Let's just go around. We'll start
with block because you had your hand up
first and, and Lord,
we'll end up with you because you held
up your hand last. We'll go
all the way around and try to
do it fast. But, but,
but remember we, we,
we're not that far behind go
ahead. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Also, we don't have a
timekeeper here today because
our, our vice Chairman is not
here and I'm
notoriously easy
on this, but I will get
tougher as the day goes on.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank
you. And I guess I'll just introduce
myself as well.
So uh State
Representative John Blockhouse District
51 in
Alamogordo. We are
blessed to be in one county, Otero
County and it's great to be here
in Taos. So uh
I did have a couple of questions
for you real quickly. Thank you
so much for being here. Uh We
did mention
I believe bringing
in more doctors
and pas from
not just out of the State
but out of the country. And I believe
you said India
was a huge one
and I know it's, it's really
great that we have physicians
coming to the United States. I
know my doctor, she's, she's
actually from India and my dentist
as well. And I
know with that
a couple of my
physicians and folks that I go
to, they
have two different jobs
really. I know one of them has
a practice where we are in
Elmo, Gordo and then
also part of the
time has a practice
in Chaparral.
So I'm wondering is that
one of the deterrents, I guess
for more people to come
in knowing that they May
have to travel long distances
to provide health care.
Mr. Chairman
>> uh Mr.
Chair uh uh
representative.
Um
I haven't experience
that I, I have
employed psycho. My
personal experiences have
been in uh in terms
of employing
psychiatrists and
psychologists
and, and social
workers.
And
I, I haven't
uh I didn't
experience that
asking someone.
Uh for example,
um
I had, I employed a
psychiatrist here in Taos,
by the way, I'm a former
Taos uh resident,
uh uh my
medical director
lived here, but
he went to at home
uh on a weekly
one day uh
basis.
The
issue about
more
international
is uh
kind of twofold.
The every
State has the
opportunity
to employ
uh employers.
By the way, no State funds
going into this, no federal
funds going in. This is
all employer
based.
Every State
May uh
ask for
a waiver
of
the, there's a
statute that says
every
physician
to practice in the United
States
must get the
permission of
their home
country
to be
here
or
they must
ask for and
get a waiver
from that home
country to practice
it. And
uh so we've,
we, and it's a
great program
administered by the Department of
Health and we assist
them with it.
Um
We recruit
30 physicians
a year.
We are outstanding among
the states. The bulk
of those physicians are coming
from India. And
several years ago, if you ask
why India,
uh India
decided to
make it a business
of opening medical
schools
so that
money would be sent
back. I think they opened
on the order of something
over 100 medical
schools
with the notion that a lot
of those
physicians
would be returning money
home.
Um
Every one of those
physicians
who get the waiver
have to do a
residency which
can range from
anywhere from three
to up to
11 years depending on
specialty in the
United States. They
can't, doesn't make any
difference what country they're,
they're from,
they have to do a residency
in the United States. I hope
that answers your question.
>> Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Doctor Harrison. I think
that's, it's great. I mean,
I love that. Right? More doctors
coming to the United States, we
need them, we're desperate. Come on
down, we need you.
So if you're hearing us, so please,
wherever from we need your
expertise. So a
couple other, I'll, I'll give you
one question but two questions
lumped in. So I'll be
quicker. So
number one, how many
other states
do loan
repayment? And then how generous
are other states
comparable to New Mexico?
And then also
does New Mexico's
reputation
fall into
recruitment woes
because I know whenever I travel
some people are like, oh, you're from New
Mexico. Did you need a
visa to get here? Right.
Or they're like, oh, breaking
bad, great. And
I want to make sure that our
reputation
doesn't precede us in a bad
way. So, I guess
two little questions lumped into one
and that's all I had Mr. Chair,
>> uh, Mr. Chair, uh,
Representative Block,
um
in respect to the last
piece, uh Were
you speaking to my
relatives?
You will that, that
that question
does uh
come up uh very
frequently and
we
um
we get it uh a
lot in terms of
language. Uh
more than
say you're in Mexico,
it's more than do I need to
be able to
speak Spanish.
Uh you know, I
only know medical Spanish
uh you know, will I need
to have an interpreter with me?
Tho those are the types
of, of questions that
we get
the, does that?
>> Thank you Mr. Chair. And then the
other tiny question
was other states
regarding loan
repayment?
How comparable,
let's just say Utah,
Colorado
states like that. How
did they range versus what
we provide and offer
Mr. Chairman
>> Mr. Chair uh
uh
Representative Block.
Um I
just edited
uh
um
for something called
the rural health hub
uh which
does all those kind of
comparisons and I
just did the
loan repayment
piece. It, it it
should be online
pretty soon.
Uh it's all over the
place. Uh Some
states
um
will,
um,
be a little
bit
less definitive
and contracting.
Everyone who gets loan repayment
signs a contract.
And in our
case, uh you
know, you all increase it, increase
the length of the contract from
two years to three,
which is a great thing because that
gives a chance
uh for,
um,
uh
people to tap into
it. The
issue
is
in some
states
that can be continuous if
you stay in
place
in our State. It's
pretty clear,
clearly communicated
that the contracts are
dependent upon
what the legislature
appropriates
for the program.
That's not true in every
State.
Um
You get into things
like
um
scholarships
versus loan repayment,
it's all over
the place. And, and
I,
if you
would say in terms of
reputation,
New Mexico, in
terms of the programs
that we offer, that
you all
offer
again,
those 30 years that I've been
doing this, it's been also been at
the national level.
New Mexico is regarded
as the best
for rural
health
programs
historically,
until you all
increase that
those dollars to loan
repayment. I would have
said today, every
one of the programs that
you fund are
underfunded
and it's pretty
impressive to go
from 45 awards
to probably
more than 1000
awards coming up in a
week or two.
And that was done
by putting money
into a program that
has existed since
1987.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Doctor Harrison
>> Representative block.
Thank you, Representative Jones. You're
next. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. I'm
Representative Jen Jennifer
Jones and I represent
32 which is Hidalgo
County, Luna County
and part of Donan.
And thank you Dr Harrison
for being here and
thank you for being open and
honest. I don't think that's a sin.
So I think,
I think we like that.
So your opening
story about,
I believe you said it was Mr.
Hernandez back in 77
who had a heart attack on his
roof hits home to me that
happened in my district.
And although we do
have, we have services
in Lordsburg and Hidalgo
County, it's always a
struggle, isn't it?
Yeah. So,
um, you have quite
a challenge in recruiting.
I want to go back to the very
beginning. You said
I want you to clarify
671
vacancies. I know
Mr. Chair asked you to clarify
that. I still didn't quite understand what the
vacancies
were.
>> Mr. Chair.
Uh Representative Jones,
if Mr.
Otero were
to, uh,
ask us
to fill a dental
to make referrals for a
dentist, uh,
we would say how
many,
if you wanted, uh a
family,
uh, family physician,
whatever.
When we get
that entity
telling us that there's a
vacancy,
we regard that
vacancy as a
true opening,
a real job and
that if we can find
candidates to
refer to them,
we, we would love to
send 10
qualified applicants
to every one of those
openings. But we
know that if we
find candidates
and by the way, we,
we, we tell
the organizations that
we work with, we're
not the end all, you know,
use everything that,
that you can afford to
do, but those
are real job
openings.
>> Ok? I understand that. Now,
I just want to make sure that,
yeah, that was clear.
Um You, you said,
and I'm gonna try to make this,
you know, concise here.
Just keep it to about one
or two questions. But you
said that most
people ask about loan
repayment
and the call
schedule.
So I'm gonna assume that
when they decline
an offer or a
potential
position,
that those would
be the two top
reasons that they decline
in, in a lot of cases. But,
but what I want to ask you
is
what are the reason when somebody
says, or are you able to give
me this information? I don't
want to come to New Mexico after
all. What are their
reasons for
declining?
>> Uh, Mr. Chair
Representative
Jones,
that is an answer
that should come from
an in-house
recruiter.
I, I don't want to duck it.
But,
um,
you know,
does it mean that,
uh, someone comes to
Silver City
in March and the
wind is blowing
too hard
in March or going to Las
Cruces in
August and
it's, uh,
you know, 100 and
10 or
coming up here.
Uh, I remember
one time coming out of
my house and there were 100
and five inches of snow
and I, I was trying to come
out of my house and
I'm originally from Michigan
and believe me, I didn't want to see
100 and five inches of snow.
It's, it's more of those living
things that we hear
about, uh,
in, in community,
uh, connection.
The other thing is there's a
lot of fishing
on the part of candidates
looking for.
Yeah, employers
look for the perfect
fit candidates,
look for the perfect
fit and,
uh, the
things that we hear are
are not as precise
as an in-house recruiter
could answer.
Ok, >> thank you for that. I
know last year when we were
in Albuquerque,
I, I don't remember
who the presenter was, but it
was, it was noted that
they were having difficulty
finding physicians to come to
Albuquerque because
when they visited,
we have a great reputation.
U and M has a great
reputation. But when they
actually visit Albuquerque
with their families, they said
we can't live here.
Crime
education. You know,
this goes so much deeper
than, than
just um
with the position itself
offers. But the environment,
we just, we have a lot of work to
do in every area. But
I was curious to know if, if
you would echo that,
but I do appreciate your
presentation. Thank you very
much.
>> Thank you, Representative Jones
Representative Ortez. Do you have
any questions? >> I do.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm Christine
Ortez. I represent House District
42 which is right here.
Intels. Thank you so
much for being here.
I found your
presentation to be a bit
of a bummer to,
to be quite
honest.
Um But
really illuminating, I think we
have a lot of work to
do to
create an environment that
allows us to recruit
better, you know, folks
here and grow our
own medical
care providers. What
do you think about
just paying
for their
education?
What would that look
like
as a recruitment
tool
>> that
um Mr. Chair
representative
I'm all for
it?
Um, I
don't know
how much money is
available to do
that. Uh, the
educational indus industry
and health care is
gigantic. I'll, I'll give you an
example of something that went
awry and it was the
National Health Service
Corps Scholar
Program. Uh,
and it actually might
apply to one of the
recommendations that, that
I made to you.
Um,
there's
the scholar program,
uh, pays tuition
books
fees
and a
$1300
monthly living
stipend.
And
um
I don't know if it were through
lawsuits
or through interpretation
of statute
that
tuition
is defined as
tuition.
So for example,
uh I think it was
four years
ago, the National
Health Service Court Scholars
Program
had,
I believe nine
P A students
at us
C
the tuition at
us C
compared to the
tuition at UN
M
are gigantic. So
uh lawyers need
to be involved because
tuition has
many different meanings
uh in the context
of of education,
accountants,
accountants.
But uh what that
did is
actually limit
the number
of P A
students being supported
because the tuition was
so high
at us.
C
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you, Doctor Harrison. I,
I just, I think it's
something that we should be thinking
about. Um
we could pilot it out.
You know, it's one thing to
have loan forgiveness, you
know, if you've gone to another
school and then you're coming to New Mexico
to practice.
Um And I'm glad that we've
been increasing that
loan forgiveness program
though, I mean, it sounds like
it's yet again oversubscribed.
Um but it's another thing to
provide, you know, a
medical degree for
free as we do free colledge
now. But for these graduate
degrees, for these
necessary programs that
we know we're trying to recruit
for.
>> Uh Mr.
Mr. Chair
representative May make another
comment.
Please
even discuss this on the way
up here from Albuquerque
today.
Um
What happens
when
there is an
incentive
to go to a place that you ordinarily
wouldn't
go?
And there, there
is a,
from my perspective, a
potential
danger in
that we
would just drive people to
urban areas.
I again,
the accountants and the attorneys
would have to get in involved
to, to make sure
that, you know, kind of like that New
Mexico Health Service cor
the Department of Health has to
approve of the place where
they work.
Uh It can't be
just
anywhere.
Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative Ortez.
Are you on LFC?
I'm not on darn
it.
>> I have some friends who are LFC. I
can give them text.
>> It would be great. It would be
great for
anybody on this
Committee.
Senator
Rodriguez.
So you've got to
take all of this
information. Of course, we have
staff from LFC here.
But, but
one of the main things we
need to make sure comes out of this
hearing is that
LFC understands
the importance of
those various
programs
that help with recruitment. I mean,
how are we going to deal with our
shortage if we don't
have adequate money in the
tuition loan repayment?
If we don't have money in
the, in the
recruitment effort, if we don't have
money and expanding it to behavioral
health, if we don't have, don't have
all of those things.
So, yes.
So Senator
Rodriguez, you're next.
Thank >> you, Mr. Chairman. Good
morning, Doctor
Harrison. Right? Yeah, I get it
correctly here. Yes. Thank you
very much for your presentation, your
work. And Senator
Ortiz Pino put it all in a
nutshell. Actually, I had written
down some points
here. I wanted to elaborate
on but one primarily
from all that you
said I picked up
at least one very,
very important
point and that
is the fact that we need to
take a step
backwards here
and go back
and do it right.
We're never going to get there
to, to have enough
providers, enough
nurses, enough
physicians, all the
providers that we have shortages
in which is everything I think
in New Mexico,
unless we
provide the foundation
that we need. And that is, you
mentioned, Dr Harrison
wrote it down here that we
don't have enough
trainers. You
mentioned, we don't have the
expertise and then
we don't have enough trainers to
train in recruitment
and so on. Well, we can't
have the expertise if we
don't train people first
because they're never going to get to the
expertise, then we're
never gonna get to
having providers if we don't
follow the two prior steps
training and then
more of course, um
expertise and money.
But I guess one thing I
wanted to um to
mention Mr. Chairman is that
considering the magnitude
Doctor Harrison of this problem
that we're facing and I hear
it all the time, 29
years and I've seen how much
worse it's gotten. It's, it's
never been adequate julie
that what we provide, but
much worse in the last
several years.
And I just
wonder why you
are only requesting
Dr Harrison $2
million. You mentioned
that you said
I wrote down a small ask
here because $2
million you said there's no money
specific specifically
set aside for recruitment.
And, and I thought,
you know what $2
million is very little when
you think about the magnitude
of the need. So you May want
to just go back and I'll
mention this to LFC,
but you May want to go back
and, and just ask
for a little more, maybe
you'll get the 2 million if
you ask for more. Otherwise you May
get 100,000 and not
get anywhere. So
that's what I had to
say,
>> Mr. Chair
Senator.
The reason that I mentioned
the 2 million is
that in previous
presentations, we
had spoken about
creating an endowment
that would allow
for
whatever was generated
from that endowment
to
be con
go to
recruitment
uh As it
is
right now,
the recruitment
dollars are
split out of the
Rural Primary Health Care
Act. The, the bulk of
which has been
reduced from 16
million down to 11
million,
which uh
has meant
lower awards going
to the 19 or 20
organizations including
our own. So we
had spoken about uh
perhaps
uh
providing seed money
for an endowment and, and I
do agree with you that it, it, it
is not enough
money uh for
recruitment. Uh
And again, I was
thinking in terms of
what we
had proposed
directly for behavioral
health, the behavioral health
side of things.
>> Yes. All right. Thank you. Thank
you for that. Um You made
one very um strong
and pivotal point here, another
one. And when you said that
organizations say
we have, I wrote
it down, we have real jobs
if you find them
that says it. All right there.
We're never going to find him unless
we step back and say, ok,
what are, what are we doing or not
doing that is
perpetuating the problem.
And that's why
I mentioned what I did about the,
about the tomb a and more
but Mr. Chairman, I know we're
short of time and I'm going to
mov'e on, but I will bring this up
to LFC.
Thank
you.
>> We have unearthed a
second member of our Committee
who's on the LFC
Representative
Ferrari
>> ads.
>> That's close enough. Go
ahead.
>> I'll still give great
recommendations to increase
our funding for every
medical school that we
can.
Thank you Joanne
Ferrari representative
for House District 37
in Las Cruces, kind of the
east side.
And um
Dr Harrison,
I've heard
you for years mention
a lot of these
things and I'm glad to see that
funding is getting increased,
but we do need to
continue that and an
even bigger
formats that can
be handled.
Um But one of
the things I thought was
really great that Lalin
took to heart your
one recommendation. You've
been beating the drum
and how
to support
or when you
are recruiting to
include the spouse and find
their interest and how
the community can work
with
both,
you know, or partner. I should
say, not always
a spouse,
but
to make sure they're part of the
community and they
want to come to that area
especially in the rural areas
too. So I'm glad
to hear that they took
to heart for your son
and daughter in law. I hope
that has, have they
confirmed it
yet?
>> Mr. Chair representative.
This was some years ago.
>> Ok.
So good.
And
also
can you tell us how
many um
physicians
um we need, well, how
many physician
assistants
we should change at that?
The, the
physician can oversee?
You said that
there,
we need to have
more
pss
under physicians
oversight. Do
we need, can we change that
to a greater number of
people that the physician
can oversee
or is that something? The medical
board
does,
>> Mr. Chair
representative that
is a medical board
issue and, and their
statutes
and
it walks back
to just
the lack
of physician
availa availability
throughout the
State
and that's also
associated
with uh some
of that workplace
thing and being
appreciated and
what have you? So
a physician,
uh I
brought up my knee, I
asked the orthopedic
surgeon, how many, how
many patients did he see in
clinic when he does
uh the outpatient
side? And he told me
40 a
day.
So, yeah,
physicians seeing
30 or 40 patients
a day, I can
tell you some horror
stories about what
some physicians have had
to do in order to make
it uh or even to
be working
where they can see enough patients
to make it
um
that
it's
um
a fine balance. I think
that the National
organization
uh associated
with physician assistants
is looking at
Legislation,
um,
to allow
for
uh
uh-huh
more latitude
on the part of
physician assistants than they
have right now.
And I would expect
that I,
I don't know if there's anybody
here from the New Mexico
Association of
Physician Assistants or
not, but I would assume
that they're at least looking at
it.
>> So, Mr. Chair and
um, Doctor Harrison, is
this going to be
changed at the national level
or should we, is that something we
should consider
talking to the medical board
about changing in New
Mexico? >> Mr.
Chair
representative, this is
a State issue,
but I can
say that I've read that the national
organization is
interested in lobbying the
States to
change their
statutes. You
know, it's a, it's
a big deal to
um
push a discipline
uh
to accept another
discipline uh to
have much more authority.
Uh If you all have
been around those of you who have been
around for a while and fought the
wars around uh
uh dental
therapists, for example,
you know, those are, those are
tough battles to get into
and the boards really
need to address their
Legislation.
>> And Mr. Chair
of my last one is just
a comment about
as we were
looking at CYFD
and some of the problems
that they're
having. I
agree totally with you about
the
master
of social work
students and
getting more certifications for
other different
levels because
there's been a lack
of
training and
experience that I
think has led to a lot of
CYFD
problems and
we need to help improve
that. So, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you
doctor. Thank >> you
representative. There are
four Members remaining.
Five.
You're ok. Ok.
Four Members remaining and
we'd like to try to mov'e it along so
we could wrap this up by 1130.
So,
Representative Chavez,
>> thank you Mr. Chair.
Um I think I probably have
more comments than questions Eleanor
Chavez. I represent um house
district 26
on the west side of Albuquerque.
So in
terms of retention,
I thought that, that, I mean, that's one
of the things that I've always
looked
at and I think one of the things
that we also need to consider is
working conditions.
I remember when the
entire all of the nurses
in the OB department at
Gallup quit because
of their working conditions, they felt that
they were not
safe. So they ended
up leaving
the other piece. I wanted to
give an example of
when you talked about
folks who come here, want to be
connected to the
community. Many
years back, ST Vincent
recruited a number of
nurses from India
and they also worked on recruiting their
families and bringing their families here
too so that those nurses would
end up staying. I don't know how many of
them did, but
I thought that that was a very
interesting
idea.
Um The other thing
too is that in
terms of
recruiting health care
professionals and behavioral health
professionals, one
of the things that and I think it was
kind of briefly mentioned by someone else
is that we really need to focus
on growing our own, right? We
need to begin thinking
about, you know,
how are we going to fill
up this pipeline?
I know that our end
shortage has been a shortage ever
since the end of World War Two.
And that's been a long time and we,
we haven't figured out
how to do it. And I'm thinking,
you know, we need to get very creative
in terms of growing our own
and really starting at the elementary
and middle school level so that kids
know what's available to them
and have the opportunity to
understand
sort of the professions
within health
care
in terms of social
workers. We are in a very
desperate need right
now.
And my understanding
is that and this
necessarily maybe isn't
something that you can
do, but I just wanted
to put it out there that
when social
workers graduate, there's been
some problem in terms of
them being able to get their
provisional licenses. So they've got
to wait a number of
months
before they can actually
practice. And we need to figure
out why that's going
on and we need to rectify it
so that they're in the pipeline
right away because we desperately
need them, especially
at departments like
Cyfd.
I think those are my comments. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. >> Thanks,
Representative Chavez,
Senator Pope. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chair,
Senator Harold Pope.
Junior serve as the
Senate Majority Caucus Chair also
representing district 23
Northwest Albuquerque Bernalillo
County. Um
One question, Doctor
Harrison. Um
and, and
I know you you're not dealing with
policy or anything at all. And
so what I, what
I preface this question with
has nothing to do with you.
But I'm looking this
as looking at this as a
recruiting
opportunity.
So
we've seen after
Roe V Wade
reversal, we've
seen what's happened in other states when
it comes to abortion and reproductive
care. I was actually
on a flight coming
from DC. Last week.
I actually met a physician from
Idaho that's like leaving
their State. And we've seen this in
other states where
some Obgyns
feel they do not
want to serve in some of these states that
have some of these draconian
laws. Is this
an opportunity for us
in New Mexico to maybe recruit
some of these
Obgyns and M Ds
to come to New
Mexico?
>> Uh Mr.
Chair, Senator
Pope,
the answer is yes,
every working
day.
If I see on
the various
mechanisms that we
use to attract
candidates
that if I see
an ob a family
physician, a
pediatrician
from one of those
states, and there are
more of them
even if, even if
they rarely say New
Mexico,
but I send him an
email
and I, I
say
New Mexico is a
place that allows health
professionals to practice
to their consciences.
I put that in my
email
and I put
the sources of loan
repayment that are
available to us
and guess what?
Few people actually do
respond
and, and say, hey,
I'll, I'll send
you our
resume.
Um, I think we're going
to see more of
that as
time goes on.
I, uh, uh, I have
a new boss, uh,
who's a physician
and Chair of our, we have a 17
member board of directors, by
the way, from all over the
State.
And,
uh, he's a physician
and I told him, you know, I see
people
with 50 years of
experience, 60
years of
experience,
40 years of
experience looking
for work and he
didn't believe me. So I pulled
up my computer and, and
went to
one of the sources that we
used and I showed him all of the
people in those
categories.
Um,
we need to reach
out to people
in every State to
come here.
Uh A lot of
people
are outliving their
retirements,
uh, those people,
um
The number of people
in the Southeast
looking for work is
amazing.
The number of
fourth year medical
students who have
decided not
to go
into ob
training in those
other states
is
stunning.
Uh So we're gonna
have a, an additional
opportunity more than
likely if our
training institutions
can expand
that we might be
getting even
more residents at
the physician level from those
states.
>> Thank you, Doctor Harrison and thank you Mr.
Chair. I just think this is
a huge opportunity.
As Doctor Harrison stated,
we're gonna allow medical
professionals to really work and do
the work, you know, their conscience to
really put patients
first and
not worry about laws or worry
about going to jail for
what they feel is doing the right thing.
So that's all I have Mister Chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator Pope
Representative Herndon,
who also is
a advisory member on the
LFC. It turns
out
>> thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes,
we are LFC strong here
today. So
um thank you, Mr.
Chair, Mr. Presenter.
I'm Pamela Herndon House
District 28 in the Northeast
Heights. So there are just three
points I wanted to bring up
to you. One, we talked
about a recruitment and
how do we get more people
here? And when you're
asking for money, one of the
things I want you to think about
asking for is more
funds for the communities
to careers program
at UN M because
that program directs
students who are
right here in our own State. We
heard about growing our own
to go into a health field
and it takes them and gives
them the experience to do
that. So are you familiar with
that program?
>> Mr. Chair
representative, I'm very
familiar
with the, the in
intricacies
of advocating
for programs
within uh
UN M probably
is a little above
me. Uh
But I
would advocate for a
lot of different
programs
at, at UN M.
>> Thank you. I, I really
think highly of that program.
And, and the second thing that I, I
think we need to look at
is some barriers that we
put in front of people
if they want to go into the health care
profession. So for
example, if there's a young
woman who has
decided to have a child while
she's in high school
and she wants to go into the
B A MD program,
she has the grades, she has
the scores on the, on
the test, but she can't
do it because she's,
she's decided to have a
child. We need to remove
some of these barriers because
we want to make sure
that we are giving the people in
our own State, the
people who have the culture and the
background to stay here and
to advance when they'd like to.
So help me to advocate
for that. So I present that
to you. And then the
third thing that I want to present
to you is that, you know, you
made the statement that it's
the Department of Health
is the only one advocating
for behavioral health. Well, I want
to challenge you on that one,
Dr Harrison because
I want you to also look at the
health care authority. So
they have a, you, they have a man
named Nick Buus who sits
there. He's the Director of
Behavioral Health Care, but
not only that, he sits
on a major work group
looking at behavioral health
care and how we're gonna get more
people to come to
this uh uh State
and, and to coordinate
behavioral health care as well
as to train them to come
in. So I share with you those
three items
and uh I just want to say
thank you, Mr. Chair, thank you, Doctor
Harrison, Mr. >> Chair.
Uh uh Representative,
May I respond
just a little bit to the last
one? So
this is, this is very
personal.
I do not
believe
that
the
responsibility
for
health care
in New Mexico
should be solely
based upon
what the
health care authority
can spend or
not spend.
I
worked in behavioral health
as a senior administrator for
15 years. I'm a lot
younger than I look.
Uh
um
and some of your colleagues know
a lot about mental health and
substance abuses as
well
by putting everything
into Medicaid.
We eliminate
a large portion of our
population in
regard to behavioral
health services.
And
uh when
I
said
that
I didn't know how
HSD
did anything
in recruitment
and spoke to
the Department of Health,
I meant specifically
for recruitment,
not, not
other things of
which I am totally
unaware of.
Back in my day, it
was the Department of Health
that did all of the behavioral
health and substance abuse
work and it was not
restricted to
Medicaid
patients.
>> Thank you very much, Doctor
Harrison. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. >> Thank
you, Representative Representative Lajan.
You'll wrap it
up.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair, Representative
Luhan from Santa Fe. I
represent house district 48
and I to sit on
house appropriations and
finance. So we're
quasi
um Members of the
LFC
which is great.
Um
Whatever that means,
um
we serve, we serve to fix
the B to um
work on our state's budget.
And one of the biggest issues that uh
I've been working on,
particularly on behavioral health
and, and health care in our
State. And one of the people
that I learned, some of the
most information is from
Representative Eleanor
Chavez and my
mother who
is a health care professional.
She's a nurse, retired nurse now.
And so this is uh this
was uh indoctrinated
in me at from a young
age
um with my, with
my mother and all those that
uh she surrounded
herself with working on a
State policy for
healthcare professionals
in the labor union. Uh
So
when I come to this, I come from, I
come from a
predisposed
position of a
bias on, on
focusing on our workforce.
Um When I'm looking at uh
aspects of, of what's going
on in our health care
with our healthcare professionals.
And I grew up in a robust
time in Santa Fe
where we had providers and we
had specialists and I
babysat for them
um as a young girl
myself. And so I know that they
were there and what is
happening now is that
we're losing those provider ships,
especially in, in Santa Fe. We
don't have these specialists and they're coming
in and they're retiring
and um
they come for a while and then they
leave. Um
And we're seeing this all over
one of the things I have, I actually
had a really good friend that I went to
colledge with, who recently moved
back to Santa Fe and is a family
practitioner.
And what he
um has been
discussing with me
is we need to
look at our health care
providers that come
in as practitioners
and starting up their own businesses
as small businesses
and looking from their budgetary
perspective as
what they need
and they
are, they
have, how do I
say this? They don't have a lot of benefits
when they come into our State as
from the perspective of being a
small business. Now,
I'd like us to look at that
and, and as we're looking at recruitment,
I also also, I am a former
hr director for the State of New
Mexico. So
I'm trying to catch
up because I am sorry, I missed most
of your presentation this morning,
but I'm catching up with my colleagues
and, and uh kind of finding out
what you were talking about and
just listening to the comments from
everybody, we
haven't really put our finger quite
on, on, you know, what is that,
that main button of what's going
on in our State? Well, the fact of the
matter is many things,
money, not being one of them when
we have invested $1.2
million bi billion
dollars from our State
budget into behavioral
health programs and
systems.
Money is not the issue. It's,
it's the recruitment. It's,
it's the, it's the provider
ship in our
workforce. So one of
the things that I have
um ventured to,
to figure out some of these
uh working with my
communities and working with local governments
too is where is the local
government um
and their perspective in all of
this Mr. Chair and
where, where
are they spending the, the funding and the
monies that are going down
to them for the programs that they
have? Uh We are
in transition right now from
HSD to H
AC and that
we need to.
Um today is the first
day, today is July 1st.
Today is the first day of that
transition on the
ground. Uh We need to
give that a little bit of time to get up and
running and see how, you know the
functionality of that uh where
that's gonna go as far as like,
you know, our insurance programs and
those sorts of things. I'm
glad you touched. These are more comments,
Mr. Chair. I appreciate the time,
but I really appreciate what you
said and, and just the
whole focus on Medicaid
right now. We're, we're gonna be looking
at another program this
Session and there's gonna be many
policies that we're gonna be looking
at regarding
uh behavioral health and other
um
um other
regards in the industry of
health care,
one in particular that we were
presented last week in, in
courts and corrections
was the Samson Sam
a fund that is going, that
we just got um
uh administered or
going to be administered.
Um based upon the program that
we're gonna put on, we're gonna put
together, but it is only
and solely for
Medicaid.
Uh those that receive
Medicaid. I'd like to look
at the expansion of that when we're looking
at our, our health, uh, Purchasing
Act and how we
expand things, not just
for behavioral health, but
uh across
the, the streams
of, of revenues
for our providers. Because I believe
that this is something that I'm
hearing in my own,
from providers that I know
and from retired
workforce and
from,
from other aspects.
But we have to
realize though, too, that
those that receive Medicaid
benefits are
huge or the Majority of our
population in New
Mexico. And we have to
first focus on them and I'm just gonna
say it very clearly that
that is, that is primary
for us to, to
realize um
but the, there's not just one
thing that's,
that's leading to this problem.
Um We're trying to figure
out also Mr. Chair
and you're part of this is, is how
we, how we
um interface
uh behavioral health with
our justice systems.
And what's that gonna look like?
Uh We're, we are trying to
meet the need and
demand of, of what is going on in
our State. But the recruitment
part uh I
can tell you
personal experience.
Uh I was a pre-med
student and I
was gonna, I, I took
my MCA and I
was, I applied to U and M I was
in the process of and I applied
to other, other places.
But the one thing that, that
inhibited me
was exactly what Representative
Pamela Herndon said I had a child
with special needs.
A young child and
I could not, there was no way
that I there was, there were
the constructs were not there
for me to be a medical
student.
Um, though
I, that was, that was something
that I was looking to do.
So all those things and
I just wanted to as the last
person to talk. It's a
whole bucket list
of things that we need to
focus on at the same
time.
Thank you, Mr. Chair,
>> Mister Chair
Representative.
All of those things need to
address. And if you give me one
minute, just to
respond to the last
one that you spoke
to,
um
there is loan
repayment,
there is loan for
service
and there are scholarships.
One of the things that New
Mexico is
lacking in
in health education
scholarships,
there are very,
very few of
scholars, scholarships
that are available. Some
communities have been able
to pull it together to
help, help out uh
with students
going on into
uh health education. Not
every community has been able
to do that. Not every
educational institution
has access
to uh
scholarship resources
for, for students,
but that would be an
arena. I think that
would be worth exploring
to, to see because I'm
not aware of any organized
effort over the years
to address
scholarships.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Representative and
thank you, Doctor
Harrison.
Uh obviously an area
that the Committee has a lot of interest
in. Uh I would
summarize the things
that we need to, to make sure
get into this year's budget.
If we're going to see any change
is more money for loan
repayment.
We're gonna hear tomorrow about
the possibility of scholarships
for be behavioral health
fields at the graduate level
and at the, at the
community colledge
level
money for your program
to recruit behavioral health.
Apparently you don't have that.
I mean, you do it with other people's
money if you can find it
federal money or, or
foundations or whatever,
but we don't give you any State
money to do that. And that's something
we ought to add to your, to your
budget and a staff
person to do that.
Um
The new Mexico Health Service
Corps, which
I've just discovered
exists and, and we
need to make sure it's fully funded
and, and operational and, and
effective.
The thing you
mentioned to us last year was an
endowment
that would be in effect a
fund that, that
communities or clinics
or hospitals could utilize
to add
to the package
of incentives they, they have
available to them.
And a constituent of mine
brought up mortgage
shared mortgage
payments.
That, that, that might be
because what happens when you give a
shared mortgage payment,
they're building up
equity.
You know, you, let's say the, the
mortgage on their house is
$2000 a month.
They pay
1200 State
pays 800
they're building up
equity in that house so that
it really is a good way of
incentivizing them. I
hadn't thought about that before, but
that's another possibility that
could be done out of that
endowment fund. We didn't
create it. It was one of our bills
last year that didn't,
didn't happen, but
that's still on the agenda is
something we might
try.
And with that, we thank you. Thanks
for your work and thanks for your
presentation, Jerry,
>> uh Mr. Chairman Members of
the Committee. Thank you
for the
opportunity.
This is the first time
in
30
years that
I was pretty
blunt and
uh I need to say
to Representative
Ortiz
perseverance pays
off
and I wouldn't have been
doing this for
30 years
if I
didn't have
a thrill
when somebody
comes to work in Taos
or goes to work in Dimming
or goes to work
in Gallup
and to
know that everyone
who does come to
work in New
Mexico that
they're saving lives or they're
making lives better.
And I did not intend
to be negative. I tended
to
be pretty
blunt.
>> Well, thank you. And I think the Committee
joins me in absolving you from
your
sin.
Secretary Allen. Good to
have you with us this
morning.
>> Use this one Secretary
if that one, that one does
work.
>> So Secretary Allen will
be giving us an update on the
Department of Health
uh efforts at
staffing
fully all the State
facilities.
>> Thank you, Mr., Chair Members of the Committee,
Patrick Allen, Secretary of the Department
of health, the state's Public Health
and health care Facilities agency.
Happy to give you an update on
our facilities and it sounds
maybe like talk about a bunch of other
things too. Uh Depending
on what, what all is on your
mind. Um You have a
presentation that I
will go through. Uh
quickly I've brought um
brought some folks with me in the interest
of time. I'll uh I'll introduce
them if I get in over my head and bring
them up to help me to
help me answer questions. So I'm
gonna go ahead and dive into the uh
into the powerpoint that
you have. We're gonna talk about four things.
We're gonna talk just a little
bit about an overview and,
and sort of what are our
facilities and what they do.
A little bit of it. That is a reminder
for some of you. I know there are a couple of
new faces to the
Committee and so maybe a little bit of
grounding there. We'll talk
about um finance, staffing
and census in the facilities,
maybe answer
some questions along the way
there as well as, as some
preconceived notions. I'll
give you a particular update on
the new construction at the vets home,
which I know is on lots of folks'
minds and then see what
questions that you might
have. So if you want
to go into the, the fourth
slide, this is
just a quick overview of the
lines of business we're in,
people are used to thinking of our
facilities in terms of there being
seven facilities
and, and thinking of each
of them being a, a thing. And
that's certainly true. But
we have a mixture of lines of business
and we have different lines of business
at different facilities.
And so really, there are six
different things we do
across our facilities.
We provide skilled and
long-term care, we do
that in three different
facilities. Um
And, and in particular, the
probably the most surprising thing
is that the Meadows is a
long term, is a skilled nursing
long-term care facility at the
Behavioral Health Institute.
It's really at the
campus and integrated
from an administrative standpoint
into the campus, but it's not really a
behavioral health facility. It's
simply a long term,
a long term care facility. We
also provide services at
Fort Beret and at, at
Vets Home. And I'll go into a little bit of detail
about each of these facilities.
We do physical rehabilitation
at the New Mexico Rehabilitation
Center. That's, that's
not chemical dependency,
alcohol and, and drug treatment.
That's people with
traumatic brain injury, traffic
accidents, significant
surgeries, those kind of things that
need physical rehabilitation
posts, stay
after surgery. That's one of the
lines of business we do there.
We have facilities that do
treatment for substance abuse, which
includes NMC as well
as Turquoise Lodge in
Albuquerque. Um We
provide adolescent behavioral
health services
at two different facilities.
Um General
Behavioral Health Treatment, of course
at the Behavioral Health Institute.
And then we are a DD
provider
in, in Las Luas in a
variety of homes across that
community. And I'll
talk a little bit about that. That's kind
of a snapshot of what the,
of what the facilities
do. There follows several pages
in the presentation that I'm going to
speed through very
fast. But
at, at your leisure, it gives you
some sense of, of what we
do at the, at the various
facilities. I've already
touched on the meadows at,
at Bhi a long-term
care facility that's
licensed at 162
beds. And I'll talk a little bit
about staffing and licensing
and census when I talk about census
generally. But you can see a little
bit of a listing of the kinds of
services that we provide
there. The next
page talks about Fort Baird
Medical Center. This is the
descendant, um,
uh, of what was once
upon a time, the, the
base medical facility
at Fort Baird, one Fort Baird
was a fort. Uh, of
course, it hasn't been that in a very
long time. Um, and
this is AAA uh,
um, uh, a
facility that was built to
replace what was the old
Fort um Fort
facility. It is
also a long term care facility
and does have 11
unit that treats veterans
particularly. It's not a veterans
facility per
se. Um, but
that is part of the part
of the patient
mix.
Next is a New
Mexico
home. The picture that
you see here is a, is a mockup
of the new small homes that are
under construction
and should be opening,
cross our fingers, throw salt
over our shoulder, knock on wood
soon. Um,
I, and I'll talk a little bit about that
when we do the Veterans Home, uh,
update.
Uh, next is,
um, NMRC. I've already
touched on it a couple of ways. It
has a alcohol and drug
treatment wing as
well as a physical rehabilitation
wing. It's located in
Roswell.
Um
I think I got a duplicate in mind.
Turquoise lodge is in, is
a facility that's at the Gibson
health hub in
Albuquerque. It does also
a
substance,
substance use treatment and
the substance use programs usually
involve both detox
rehab, all three of detox
rehab and some kind of in, in
intensive outpatient
treatment. So a full
portfolio of services. Yes,
I, I don't >> think that's a
duplicate.
I think that, that
that's one of the questions we were
going to ask you about because
the rehab center is approved
for substance abuse
treatment, but I
don't
know if much of it is going on.
That's the >> Yeah, I can, I
can. Well, I'll just touch
on, on that now. Yeah.
So across
our facilities we operate
on, it's at about 90%
of our staff capacity.
So in all, for all intents
and purposes, full at
all of the facilities,
NMC is the exception
to that. We've got some challenges
of that facility both on the medical
rehab and on the substance
use side that we're working
through with
some administrative changes and
some and some other things to get
to get that facility up
to more, more
what it needs to be in terms of capacity.
But the census there is
is low even for the
staffing challenges that we
have.
Uh let's see, uh
touched on turquoise
lodge, Sequoia adolescent
residential treatment center
is a, a facility
also in Albuquerque
for Tage
males, usually
with a behavioral health diagnosis
as well as some kind of
violent expression
of that behavioral health
diagnosis.
Um
And then, and then
two more behavioral
health facilities, we've got an adolescent
program that is part
of the Behavioral Health Institute. And
this is for again
for teenage boys with problematic
sexual behaviors. And
then finally, the the
business units at,
at the Behavioral
Health Institute, those
include the forensic
facility, people who have been accused
of a crime but are not able to
aid and assist in their
defense. Um
uh people who have been
convicted uh a
but for
but for insanity and so
they're in longer term treatment at
the facility. Um
We also uh operate
a, a community-based
service program that
has about 400 patients
at any given time. Uh
1000 over the
uh over the course of a year.
Um And it's a, as
you can see by the sign that's pictured
here, a very old campus
with buildings that range
from relatively new like meadows
to some that are
spectacularly old.
And we have a major
capital project underway right
now to replace the forensic
unit. And then finally, a
little bit of an outlier
is the Las Salinas community
program. This is the descendant
of the old training
school approach to people with
intellectual and developmental
disabilities
where they were sent to a
centralized kind of a place
often in an agricultural
setting. Um uh
what exists now
in Los Luas as we've
worked through the, the
decades long
deinstitutionalization
process. Uh is a,
is a set of 21
actual residential homes
across uh a across
Los Luas in Valencia
County um that
provide a variety of services
on small group settings,
usually about four
residents in those uh
in those homes um
uh as a uh as a way of
providing those services. So that's really
kind of the portfolio of what
we provide. What I'd
like to do now is just talk a little
bit about, about the
money uh and about census
and those kinds of things. If you turn
to slide
16,
it'll give you a kind
of a rundown of where we are
from a financial standpoint. You
can see down the left
hand side of that slide
um uh our budgeted
revenue, uh the
revenue that's materialized
and then our expenditures and then
a shortfall, that
shortfall actually is a little bit
bigger. Now, the,
uh, with an, with
some additional shortfall
at the vet's home. But basically
our finances, unlike
a lot of State agencies
are really variable
due to the billings that we're
able to achieve for
the patients that we treat.
Um, and, and there's
a lot of variation even
across our facilities
at, uh, at the Behavioral Health
Institute, we have
people who are in our forensic
unit for whom we're not able to bill
anybody. And in fact, there's
federal law that prohibits our
bill billing Medicaid for
those, uh, for those individuals.
The adult psychiatric
unit is almost that
stark, not, uh,
not quite. Then we have
facilities like the vet's
home where we're able to, to build the veterans
administration for,
for costs. Uh, other
long term care facilities
including vets are able to bill,
uh, Bill Medicaid, but
that's all pretty
variable income.
Uh, in terms of what our patient
census is, what their payer
sources are and
our ability to build those payer
sources. We do have patients who
are unable to pay.
Uh, and so we bear the cost
of that and you see, uh,
you see that show up
in, uh, in general
fund. If you
go out and talk to talk to
providers in any
of these sectors, developmental
disabilities, long
term care, behavioral
health treatment, they will tell
you that they are
challenged to be able to
provide services
for the rates that they get paid
and in that context, we're
a rate taker just like any other
provider. We're subject to Medicaid
rates. We're subject to
uh behavioral health treatment rates,
va all those uh all
those kinds of things. And so
you see a very large allocation
of general fund that
either covers patients who are
not able to pay at all where there's
costs that aren't covered
or make up for the
shortfall in rates in terms of,
of cost that's being,
being delivered. The
big variable in our budget
right now is at the
vet's home where the construction
project has gone on
for a very long time
with some as it seems
like every time we get, feel like we're
getting close to being able to open those
new homes. We have a new challenge. The
most recent is the water
system in uh
through the consequences and it's a
ability to provide
adequate pressure that's
resulted in our need
to, to construct
um uh storage tanks
on site uh to be able to
store water right now.
Uh Well, I'll talk about, uh I'll
talk about vet's home in a minute, but that gives
you kind of an overall picture. We went
into the last legislative Session with
a pretty significant shortfall
across our facilities about
$14 million.
Um We were able to close that
through some actions that I'll talk about
in a minute. Uh and then a,
a set of supplementals
and, and specials that we were
able to allocate. And
with the exception of that
variability at the votes home, we're going
to come in at the, we have
come in. And now that today is
July 1st at the end of
the fiscal year, about where we expect
it to. The
next slide just
indicates where,
where we've allocated
the, the supplementals
and specials. I would point
out two things. You'll see that
there's about 6.5
million that was allocated
to the Behavioral Health Institute and
about 2.72
0.8 million allocated
to Las Salas
in all of our
facilities, we
really are at a place
where we're at about
equilibrium on those facilities,
money in from all payer
sources and co
and money out in expenses
is about even we
believe we have structural
deficits actually at BH
I and at LLC P
that are, that are reflective
here at about these dollar
amounts. We're working
with LFC to get
them to see the world the
same way that we do.
Um The, the biggest
challenge, there are a couple of challenges.
We have one that I think we've
now answered is on the,
on the census side.
Um Will Rogers once said
it's not what people don't know. That's the
problem. It's what they do know that just ain't
true. And one of the things
that you all do know
that just ain't true is if only
we filled up our facilities, everything
would be fine. We'd have plenty of revenue
and we'd, we'd make money and, and
be all right, Los Luas,
uh, has 100% of its
beds full. Uh, it's
fully staffed. Its staffing
is almost entirely State employees
without using contract staff.
I'll come back to that in a minute as
well. Uh, and they're
running about a 2.5
to $3 million deficit
even though they're doing everything
they're supposed to do and billing
everyone, they're supposed to bill and
collecting all the money they're
supposed to collect. And so,
uh, so we think that's a challenge
there. We think the similar challenge
shows up at Behavioral Health Institute
and we're working with LFC
to get to a place where we,
we rethink the same
thing, uh, on
that.
If you go to the next slide, uh,
this is gonna give you AAA
Tracker,
um, over the last 12 months
of, uh, of our
facilities on,
on balance, we're
running at about
90% of
our staffed
beds, which is a
little bit more than about
50% of our licensed
beds. What goes
into that? Well, when
you think about the finances of a
facility, you've got,
um, you've got census and the
revenue that comes with census, but
you've also got expenses
and some of that is based
on how you're able
to staff those bets
in a perfect world. We'll be able to do
like we do at Los Lunas and
staff our facilities
100% with State
employees. Um,
the fact is in most
of our facilities, especially
those, aside from Las
Salinas in Albuquerque that are in more
remote communities, we're not
able to do that and we need to bring in
contract staff like lots of
other health care facilities do
that. Contract. Staff is a lot
more expensive than,
um, than hired
staff. And so
you can't just simply say,
well, let's contract with enough
staff to fill the facility up
because you'll, you'll push the facility
underwater and spend more
on that staffing than you bring
in. Uh, then you bring in, in
revenue. Nevertheless, you can
see that, uh, that census, it
has been climbing.
Of course, we're digging out of the hole
created by things
that happened in, in congregate
care facilities of all sorts
during the pandemic.
Um And it's a little bit of a, a
long slow path to be able
to build uh to build back from
that
second thing I
again, in terms of trying
to, trying to run the
facilities, as
people often say, more like a
business um
is been, has been managing
our costs. The next two
slides will show
you a display of our
overtime costs and
facilities. And we had
gotten ourselves into a, a
place that um where
we were paying managers
overtime uh in our
facilities, which is extremely
unusual if not completely
unheard of. Um
and, and at the, during
the legislative Session, uh
when we were struggling
to show that we could, we could
stay above water, we made
a decision to uh to
stop that practice of paying
managers overtime. That
was painful. Um
I, and if you
haven't, if you haven't
gotten calls from
my staff about that, you're the only
elected officials on earth who
haven't. Um
I I, and you can see
that show up in the graph
on, on the second page
where you see a dramatic drop off in
overtime. And, and
again, that's, that's overtime
for supervisors and managers
in our facilities. They still, if
they're, if they're in direct
patient care positions qualify
for comp time, we've worked
to try to pay accumulated comp
time at the end of this past, uh at
this past fiscal year.
Um But we're,
we're, we're, we're
out of the business of providing those
supervisors and managers
with paid cash
overtime.
Part of the challenge has
been, we created our, our, a
little bit of our own problem by,
by moving people
into supervisory positions
who weren't really in
supervisory roles.
And so we've now created a nurse,
four category, uh
that those supervisory
nurses, if they're not actually supervising
people can mov'e into,
that puts them uh
in a, in a more of a
foreigner's role back in the bargaining
unit subject to being able to pay, pay
overtime. So some of this will
change a little bit. But, uh but
we do think we've made a change that's
important in terms
in terms of that.
Let me turn finally. Uh
If you look at
um uh slide
22 that's a quick
update on the vet's home.
Um
We
are hoping
for what they call partial
substantial completion
uh in a couple of weeks by
July 19th.
Um uh that is,
is basically
allowing us to consider
the project complete. But
for the temporary
water issues that we're having to
do uh until we're
able to deal with water
issues, uh long
term. Um
And then you can see when we would
expect to take occupancy
across the six
homes, um
We will then have some licensing
work to do. Licensing
is a little bit bifurcated. We're
licensed by
the, the Division of Health
Improvement, which on
Friday was a part of the Department of
Health and today is a part
of the health care Authority
and they do prospective
licensing. They'll come out when we're ready
to mov'e in and say, yeah, you're good to
go. Veterans
affairs requires there to be people
living in the facilities,
um, to then come
out and do a licensing
survey. And that's a little, that's a
little hair raising,
um particularly
with this water issue and,
and trying to make sure everyone is
ok with the fact that we have this
temporary water solution
in place uh versus
a long term solution. But
um uh that's what that
will look like with that Mr.
Chair Members be happy to answer
questions on this or
uh anything else that,
that you'd like to ask me
about?
>> Could you just update us on
two things? One
last year you talked
when we were in Las Vegas, you
talked about the
effort being made
to bring
the Behavioral Health
Institute uh
into
a condition where it would be
certified to do substance
abuse treatment. Is
that still on the in the
works? And how close
is that to >> have Mr.
Chair Members of the Committee that's actually
NMRC that was
not accredited for substance
use treatment and that project is
underway. Now, we got $2 million
in the Session that we're
using uh as a, as a
special to do the work necessary
to get that accreditation and that should
have a significant impact
on the, on the residency
uh there to be able to do
that, the other, the other
project that's being talked
about and there's a meeting next week
or the week after. Um
uh with San Miguel County
has to do with the, the county's
interest in creating a
substance use treatment facility
on the campus there
in some association
with um uh
with NMBH
I, that's part of what the
meeting in a couple of weeks is
about is to, is to,
is to try to turn that into a
real project.
>> Yeah, I guess I, I do
remember my recollection
was that the,
the, the
director of the Behavioral Health
Institute did indicate
that he was
taking some steps to
try to get
substance abuse treatment
certification on the
facility itself. I I
had long been of
the of the
mis misperception
that the
State hospital did provide
substance abuse treatment.
But, but he, he
said no, but we are
looking at that and are taking
some steps. >> But I guess
is here
>> is that, is that, did I
just totally misremember
that
>> I think this one
works.
>> Yeah, Mr. Chair. Good
morning.
So a lot of the individuals
who are admitted have dual
diagnoses and we
are providing kind of
that detoxification in
those things. But we, we do not
provide direct
substance abuse treatment. We're
not licensed to do that. And I think we
did have a conversation of eventually,
that would be something that would be benefit
of us. This
facility that you're speaking about. The
epidural building that
Secretary Allen just mentioned across the
Street across the Street could provide
a good discharge resource for
us to discharge into that
treatment facility. And we
are still, as Secretary Allen
said, trying to figure out how to coexist
with that facility.
>> But as of now, you're
not taking active
steps to get
licensed as a
substance
abuse
to send people there who would just
not have dual diagnoses
but simply have a substance
abuse diagnosis.
>> Mr. Chair, a large
part of our
business is in the
court order treatment
and right now there's no new Mexico law
that would authorize
someone to send an
individual involuntarily
to bh I.
So we are still working
primarily under the mental health
codes which allow people
to either go to our forensic unit on
a, you know, court case or on
our A PD unit for a civil
case.
>> OK. But,
but there are steps being made
to uh you
said a $2 million appropriation
to the re rehab center
uh down in Roswell to,
to expand that as
a, as a resource for substance
abuse. >> It's already a substance
use treatment facility
but it's not
accredited which has an impact
on who's willing to pay for residents
to be. There works
well for people who are completely uninsured,
not so well at all for
people who have
commercial insurance or
other sources. >> And
one other question before we
open it up to the Committee on
slide, 16,
were you talking about the
revenues for the year and so
on? I'm
curious
about
you don't have authority to
spend on the
right hand side there. The second bullet
down
the false surplus
showing you having
a money from the
land grant fund.
I mean, you already have
authority, I guess to spend
6 million,
but you don't have authority to spend
eight. Why is that? What's the
difference there? >> Yeah, so
Mr. Chair Members of the Committee, the
Land Grant Fund exists
in a somewhat different budget
category that we,
we have limited ability.
Uh and in fact, none to
spend above the budgeted
amount we budgeted if I
remember correctly, about
$4 million of land grant
income. That money is
extremely variable
from one fiscal year to
another. When it comes
in, in excess of our budgeted
amount, we don't have authority to spend
it. We do expect to go
into the next legislative
Session with that as
part of our ask to be
able to, to give us
authority in fiscal
25 to spend
the money, the excess money that we
earned in fiscal, in fiscal
24 >> You
know, but, but you do,
the universities have that
same
dilemma of
Ruben
>> because
of
that,
the, and
due to the volatility that
the car on go
to, we have to
all, all of the budget
revenue items that are projected.
The legislature set the cabinet.
We, we
have the,
>> yeah, I mean,
when we say volatility, it's
just going up, up, up, up, up,
it's not going up and
down anymore. >> I
think it's actually, it,
it, I don't think it would go up
from the level. This was an
extremely high level of
funding this year and what >> the,
the, the land grant
permanent fund is going to hit $30
billion this year
and it's not gonna come down.
I mean, everybody was worried
that we were gonna tap it with
the, the early childhood
thing and that's just we blew
right past it.
Uh >> Well, then
as they say from your lips to God's
ears.
>> But anyhow, that's,
that's another matter for the
LFC, our Members who are
on the LFC, powerful
LFC Committee can take that
up. It's beyond us,
Senator Rodriguez.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good
morning, Mr.
Allen is a doctor or Mr.
I just thank
you. Thank you Mr. Allen
um for your work and your
presentation just, just
quickly. Um I
want to make sure that we're on the same
page and I'm not
misunderstanding. Is
it the case based on your
presentation that
we truly just
have
one rehabilitation
center and
give me a moment here,
which is the new Mexico
Rehabilitation we're talking
about that one is in Roswell.
I want to make sure I get the name correct.
Ok, so that's in
Roswell. That's the full
that I find based on this
like real more a little
more, still needs quite a bit of
work, but more
comprehensive
services. Now
the other one we
have and the only
is in is
Turquoise Lodge for
adults. I'm talking about adults.
Sorry about that, >> Mr. Chair
Senator, if you're talking about for
alcohol and drug treatment.
>> That's, >> yes, >> I'm so sorry. Yes,
I I will make it clear
for substance abuse
issues. Thank you. So,
Turquoise Lodge is really
the only one we have in the
vicinity on
this side of the
State.
And I
know that the
situation has always
been dire to have
more services for
rehabilitation and so
on. But I guess one
of the things that crosses my
mind is that if I
look at turquoise lodge here on
page 10. Um,
it indicates on
there that
the
outpatient
IOP, I guess that's what it means.
Intensive outpatient
services. They meet
multiple times a
week.
But I guess the question
that I have is the detox
part only takes
five, I shouldn't say
only. But considering
the problem, it seems like we need quite
a few more comprehensive services
5 to 7 days for
medical detox.
Once they get detoxed,
then
do they immediately
leave turquoise
lodge and
hopefully be
in that 3 to 6
month period of
rehabilitation services
or do you have
a little more comprehensive,
more service
for transitional time?
>> Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair
Senator.
The ideal
progression is someone
comes in and does medical
detox. It's especially true
for alcohol addiction
but also true for
for for drug
addiction. They would then mov'e
into the inpatient a
um a adult detox
program. So they get through their medical
detox, they would then
do intensive inpatient
work and then progress to an
outpatient program either through
us or uh in a community
they May have come from or or
something along uh along
those lines, of course, along the way,
but it's a voluntary
program. So we have people who will
do charge themselves against
medical advice
at either of those first two stages,
which which is unfortunate but
does it does happen? But
that would be the progression
is through all three of those
lines of business. Ok.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Mr. Allen. So during
the progression of
this
intensive treatment,
you talked about impatent
treatment. Um
during that time, how long
does that last? That
intensive treatment?
I guess I'm picturing somebody
going in Mr. Chairman
to be detoxed.
And
then after that,
what happens within that
impatient treatment before they
go out into
the community and hopefully come
back for rehabilitation
services during this
month. >> So
Mr. Chair Senator,
the the
the detox is
as you see on the side, about 5 to
7 days, call it a week. Um
The the inpatient
rehab is then about three
weeks typically.
And a and in that
it's the beginnings of the
process of learning all
kinds of new ways
of thinking and behaving to
break the cycle of addiction.
That would be uh group treatment,
individual counseling, those kinds of
things. Um
as part of a
comprehensive
program of beginning
the process of, of,
of addressing addiction
and then upon successfully
completing that, moving into some kind
of an outpatient a program
which May be an intensive outpatient
program or it May be something
like a 12 step program or something
along those lines as people
begin living their lives outside
of a outside of an intensive
care environment. Is that helpful?
>> Yes, it is helpful, Mr. Chairman I
know we have but I promise this is a
short one. Do you allow
like families
during all this time and know how
important it is to have a support
system for these
individuals actually for anyone
but specifically for individuals
that have substance abuse.
Do families, do you
allow them or encourage
them to come in during any
of this period
of time that you're providing
services? >> Mr. Sheriff
Senator, if by coming,
you mean visiting those kinds of
things? Yes. Once
people are through the detox
period. >> Yes, for
training and, and helping
families learn about the,
the problem and the situation
with that one or two
specific family Members.
It's important that
Mr. Chairman, that
families, if
they have a family, that they
understand the magnitude
of this problem and,
and what it's all about in
order for the person to
succeed. Thank
you. Ok.
So if you do, you do support
it. Thank you. All right,
Mr. Chairman, because of time I'm going
to stop, but
I guess I have to make
a final comment here. I've been here a
long time and as Senator
Ortiz Pino has and
maybe others and
in all honesty,
this whole scenario that
we're talking about
doesn't seem to have
changed and improved
as far as the
services, the comprehensive
wraparound services that
we need in New Mexico.
And um,
you know, from what I see the
same criteria,
the same scenario
that we have here
that you indicated,
Mr. Allen is the
same thing I have seen for
many years
and yet our situation
is getting worse and worse
and worse, not only from
alcohol, but the
drug addiction and for
various reasons um,
some have mental health issues
as we've spoken.
Some,
some don't, they just didn't,
weren't dealt the same deck of
cards. Some of
them May have been fed
alcohol or drugs
when they were little.
Who knows what the situation
situation is? But what I
do know is
that what I see
here is pretty
much a duplicate
of what I have seen for
all the years that I've been
here and that is
29 years.
And it's a sad
situation. Truly. I know
I'm preaching to the choir but,
but we're not going to change
the trajectory
unless we provide more
services, some wraparound
services for them
for not only during
the transition of this detox
time, but, but always
case management, support
services. You know what I find
Mr. Chairman is that many people
feel stigmatized
because they've had a problem.
And you know that
one thing, one
time I heard and I'm going to end with this
Mr. Chairman. I
heard
I turned the radio on when I
was traveling to a Committee
meeting and
it so happened, the news
were on and
there was or someone
speaking on the news and they were
talking about substance abuse.
Long story short is
that something was
said that stayed with me
and that was having to
do with alcohol abuse
or drug addiction.
And the person who was
speaking said
that the only way
to guarantee
exactly that those
words, the only way to
guarantee that it won't happen to
you, to anyone,
us, anybody is
don't start.
So, you know,
the, the first thing that crossed
my mind is that is so true.
Anyone can fall
victim of,
you know, something like this so
serious. And
so with that alone,
we should be not only planning
but be ready to
take care of the, of
the the problem that we
have and, and as we see it
before our face and our eyes
growing every day,
we, we have to
do things differently
and, and um and
certainly put more
into this comprehensive
wraparound service that I'm talking
about. We have like, for
example, Mr. Chairman
HSD has a linkages
program that we we
fund somewhat. It's not
nearly adequate
uh for providing housing,
people who have problems like
these, not only need services
as we know, they need case management,
follow up, they need someone to help them
find a job, they need a
place to live,
it's just a huge
problem and we have so many
holes in the system
that it's just not going to
happen unless we come
together and, and try
and get this whole comprehensive
system in place. Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
more venting than anything.
Appreciate you allowing me to speak
this >> long. Thank you,
Senator Representative
Lujan, followed by
representatives Chavis Herndon
and block.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Uh Just a couple of
questions. Uh
Thank you, Secretary for being here.
Um First question. Um How's
your hr division?
How, what are you, do you have
vacancies? How are they
doing,
>> Mr. Chair representative?
You're asking about our human resources
team, like the
entire agency we have, we
have vacancies. Our, our um our
hr function
is actually reasonably
healthy. Um
uh in terms of its,
its functionality, its ability
to get its work done, its ability
to be supportive. Is there something specific
you're looking for?
>> Just as we're talking
about recruitment, we're talking about
the, the functionality of hr
and all of our vacancies.
I guess I'm approaching this from
a uh finance
position, budget,
finance position. And we're going to be
asking, you know, some of these questions
and you know how that,
how that division is, how
strong your hr is
to me is
relevant to how strong your
agency is. And so
that's where I'm stemming that
from. >> So if I could comment
on that just a bit, Mr. Chair,
Representative Luhan,
um that
and this builds a little bit on
Doctor Griffin's
presentation. The
challenge we have right now is
lack of human beings.
Um Everybody needs more of
everything everywhere.
And that's true whether you're in
health care or other caregiving
positions like long term care,
childcare. And it's
true whether you're
at laut um
the, the, the
challenges we have are across
the entire workforce
at virtually every position
of, of any kind.
And so while I'm very happy
with our a our department,
it's not like
if only they could try harder, they could
find those people out there who need
work and are willing
to come fill our jobs.
And it's not like there's some
pocket of health care professionals
often Minnesota or
somewhere who, if only
they got the right pitch from New Mexico
would come here and provide
care. We've got a shortage
across the entire country
in, in all of these
positions. Um uh
And so I think we're making
progress. We've steadily been
chipping away at our, at
our vacancy rate across the
agency. Um We've been
steadily building
our um our, our
census and our facilities.
But it's a, it's a, it's
a situation that's well
beyond sort of how well
is the hr function doing its
job. >> Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I
would say
have an analogy
of a cell, the constructs
of a cell and the nucleus of a
cell and that being
your hr
uh positioning and,
and what they are doing and how healthy
your hr is a
huge indication of how
healthy your agency is. So
I wouldn't neglect that or,
or even equate that
to being
um
on the same level of other
things because that's,
that's where you're going to get your talent,
that's where you're going to find your talents.
That's where you're going to
build out all the
needs and issues in your
agency, Mr. Chair.
So that's where I stem
from. The
next question I have is in
regards to
be able to have
collaborative. So
can you just from your
experience and participation
with the collaborative? Can
you, can you
give us some insight as
how that has
been in uh as you've been
in your Secretary
and the Secretary
of, of doh.
Um As far
as what are you working
on strategically as with
the collaborative Mr. Chair?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair, representative.
Um uh The collaborative right
now is uh is
is taking a step back
and really trying
to identify
its role and
and then the work that it needs to
do the collaborative was created in
an environment prior
to the expansion of the Affordable
Care Act and its
structure made a lot of
sense before Medicaid expansion
occurred and it was
around a wide
diversity of
payers doing the
best they could to, to,
to, to find
and provide services. The
dynamic is quite a bit different now
with um uh
with Medicaid expansion,
60% of New Mexicans
on Medicaid to the
comment that someone made earlier,
obviously Medicaid
isn't the only paer source, but it's a
very significant one.
So right now, what the collaborative
is working on is
trying to be more strategic
and be able to, to
identify what do we
need in the State broadly
across behavioral health. What do
we have, where are
the gaps and what are the
best ways to fill those gaps.
I'm really excited to be
able to dig into that because I
think there's a question in my
mind of what is the role of
state-owned facilities?
Um We're used to thinking of them
as safety net facilities.
Um, but
that's, that's kind of not
a useful term anymore in
a, in a post Medicaid
expansion kind of a world.
So where does it make sense
for the State to own and operate facilities?
Where does it make sense for the
State through Medicaid employee
benefits other sources to be a
purchaser of services? And that's
really the work that the collaborative
is digging into.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I really appreciate
that update from you on
that. Can you
can you, that's, that's all
I got I was about to say and that's all I got.
I wanted a couple of those,
those insights of what's going on
there. Thank you, Mr. >> Chair. Thank
you, Representative Representative
Chavez, followed by Representative
Herndon. >> Thank you Mr.
Chair. Um Just a couple
of questions in terms of the
staffing. It sounds like staffing
is you're having
some difficulty fill filling
positions at all
of all of the agencies
that are contained in this
report.
OK. Which one
>> representatives
has, has done a
pretty good job
and we're
relatively fully
staffed at turquoise
lodge and at choir which are both
in Albuquerque. And I think being in the
metro area is a big
piece of it, the rest of the facilities
are in more rural communities and have a much
harder time. Ok.
>> So, >> excuse me, I, I
just have to challenge you on
that. So there's something wrong
then if, if
turquoise Lodge
and Sequoia are
almost fully
staffed, their
censuses are half
of their capac their license
capacity. So,
and there's a waiting list. I know
there's a waiting list for turquoise
lodge. II, I
don't understand.
I mean, because
it's always been told to
us. Well, the reason turquoise
lodge only has 19
residents when
it's licensed for 40
is because staffing.
But now you're saying no turquoise
lodges is able
to benefit from its proximity
to the urban
area
on your >> chart. >> Great question.
And, and, and the issue there
is in the accuracy
and appropriateness of the actual
licensed bed number.
That's an issue that hasn't been
revisited in, in quite a
long while and which we're
doing right now. And the issue at,
at, at turquoise Lodge
is its licensed beds
is literally the count
of beds in
rooms, um which
doesn't take into consideration
any of the other things that you need
to be able to do as part of a comprehensive
treatment program, treatment,
Spaces Group, uh
uh uh a group therapy
rooms, places to eat
those kinds of things. And those
are really the limiter
uh in terms of uh of
capacity more than staffing
right now at Turquoise. So there
are two things that we're looking at first
is do we just simply have
the wrong number of beds licensed?
Second. And I should have
probably put these in opposite
order. Can we work with
the city to identify, are
practical ways to be able to
make use of more space
at the Gibson Health Hub
as a way of addressing some of
those other uh some of those other
issues. Obviously,
you know, their answer kind of
drives a little bit of that if it's,
yeah, but it's two floors up
and completely disconnected from what
you're doing. That's not so
workable. Uh versus,
yeah, it's, but it's across the
hall. We can probably make that work
those kinds of things. So we're trying to work
through those issues. But right
now I would say that the license
beds are significantly
higher than the actual
functional capacity of the
facility.
>> Now, I'm confused. So
you actually have less
beds.
>> Again. The,
the, the, the, the the
mattress isn't the problem.
Uh The, the, the
space that we need to provide
a comprehensive alcohol and
drug treatment program
for people laying
on the mattress is the problem.
And, and so we, we,
we have more mattresses
than we can use based
on the treatment space. >> So
then following
that, then the are, are
you basically saying that
the number of now
licensed beds will
decrease
>> Mr. Chair, representative
couple of different paths.
One would be to work with the city to
figure out can we expand
our footprint in the Gibson Health
Hub to provide more of the
treatment space and be able to
use all the mattresses?
Um But if the answer to that ultimately
is either no or it's not
practical, then we might reduce
our license number of beds.
Yes.
>> All right.
Go ahead. We,
we moved turquoise
into the hub
for years. It's
had 40 capacity in
its other facilities.
And so you're saying we moved it
into the hub and now we
can't handle is
what was the point of moving into
the hub? If we lost half the Bes
>> Mr. Chair II, I
can't speak to what
happened previously in
terms of the relocation there. That's where
it's been since I've been
at the been at the agency.
What I, what I know is from an
operational standpoint.
Um We,
we cannot effectively and
safely use all of the,
all of the actual beds that we
have.
>> Well, it seems
to me that we need to figure out how
to basically be
able to utilize all those
beds because
definitely there's a need,
right? Um
>> But if I could,
but if I could, if I could just
comment on that
though,
I think let's let's not lose
the forest for the
trees, right? Plus or minus
a handful of beds at turquoise
Lodge.
Important
thing to answer. But in the
big scheme of what do we need
across the State of New Mexico for
alcohol and drug treatment
capacity doesn't
begin to scratch the
sur and we need a much
more comprehensive
answer and approach in
investment in that capacity.
Turquoise lodge plays a role
in that for sure,
but we're not gonna, you know, if we add
20 beds of turquoise, that's not
suddenly gonna gonna
fix the, the
the treatment capacity problem we
have in the
State.
>> Yeah,
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Allen. Is the
department going to propose such a
comprehensive plan?
>> That's the uh the the
work that Representative Lujan
asked a bit ago having to do with the collaborative
is where that, where that work would
occur.
>> All right. So then
my other
question is about
Sequoia. How
many beds are at
Sequoia?
0, 36 I'm sorry.
Um Are all of those beds
full? >> We have just
now finally reopened. The third,
those are organized into
lodges, um,
that are basically wings of the
building. We've now just reopened
the final, uh, the final wing,
there's a little bit of an incremental
element.
Staffing, you need a minimum
amount of staff to open the lodge and
so they are now all open.
All the beds are not, not
fully yet, but we expect to be on track for
them. >> So then my other question
in terms of staffing
are wages an issue?
>> Absolutely, Mr.
Chair representative, um,
at all
of our
positions, whether
they are licensed positions
like nurses or,
or psychiatrists or psychologists
or, or positions
like uh mental health techs
or, or CNAs.
Um, we have significant
wage issues.
We're used to as a State
and we're like any other State thinking.
Well, we want our wages to be
competitive. Um,
and in Las Vegas that
means, uh, a behavioral
health tech position,
an entry-level position
is competitive from
a wage standpoint with working at
Walmart. Um,
uh, um, you,
your mileage
May vary in terms of the relative
attractiveness of being a behavioral
health tech at BH I working
with forensic population
or working at Walmart.
I would suggest that we probably
need to think about should we be more than
competitive so that, so
that we can attract a, a more
significant workplace. And then these things
always tend to be pretty laggy.
We, we look at
as a State
personnel office and,
and LFC look and decide
we're competitive and then time
goes by and wages go up
and we, and we fall rapidly
behind. So I would say all
of our positions um
pay significantly less than
they need to be employers
of choice to attract the
best workforce.
>> Mr. Speaker, Mr. and I would
agree with that. So is there a
plan, are you all
going to put forth a proposal
to increase those
wages? >> Mr.
Chair representative,
we tried last
year >> to >> try
again. We are and
I expect to try again.
Thank you, Mr.
Chair,
>> Representative
Herndon followed by Representative
Block.
>> Thank you Mr. Chair
and
thank you, Mr. Secretary.
Just uh could
you please just help me to understand
something you talk about
the behavioral health collaborative
and looking at the gaps and
services that
May be needed. And
II, I just want to
know who's on that
collaborative because there's also
a behavioral health working
group that's been meeting
involving the State, the
cities, the counties.
And I want to know are we
duplicating services or
how are we needing to bring
these two
together.
>> Mr. Chair representative III
I can quickly get out
over my skis here. I'm a
member of the Collaborative and
Services co-chair. The collaborative
really belongs to the Health
Care Authority and they would
probably be much better able
to answer more
detailed questions. The
collaborative itself is
made up of a wide
array of agencies
and other partners.
It's the there are then
statuto statutorily
established advisory
Committee uh on a
variety of topics that
uh that feed information
up into the collaborative.
Um And, and
so I, when
you say the working group, I'm not
completely sure whether
that's something yet different
or if that's referring to one of the
sub pieces, I think it is
one of those sub pieces.
But I, I think we're trying to
work hard at that
collaborative table to make sure that we're
not, you know, spinning up
different conversations about the
same thing in different places.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you Mr. Secretary.
And with respect to
the uh you talked
about people going in, going
into the intensive
uh care program
and then they are going into an
outpatient program
and then they can go into
a, a different program. I,
I guess on a continuing
basis my question to
you is does Medicare
Medicaid pay for
that? And you say some people
just drop out of it themselves?
And I'm wondering, are
they dropping off because
Medicaid won't cover it anymore
can you help me to understand
if they are still
getting
support,
>> Mr.
Chair representative? I
think that varies
with the, with the
aftercare program
and its nature and the
individual that's, that's
um uh that's
seeking treatment. Um
If you, if your aftercare
is to join, join
a 12 step program as an example,
there's, there's not a cost associated
with a, so there's nothing to, to
bill or pay.
Um if you're in an
outpatient program,
um, the limitations
on that are gonna vary with your
payer, whether it's, whether it's
Medicaid or,
or, or private insurance
And you, I I know have all
dealt with um
with behavioral health
parity issues
and, and, and
how insurance pays for
behavioral health treatment versus,
versus physical health
treatment. There are limitations
in most cases. And so it's certainly
possible someone could get
to the end of their, their
benefit um while
they're still able to benefit
from treatment, but that's going to start getting
very specifically
specialized to each individual
and their, their pair source,
generally, all pair
sources provide for
outpatient treatment of one
sort or another.
>> So, mis thank you, Mr.
Chair, Mr. Secretary.
So are are you
suggesting that maybe some of
the opioid settlement
money that we have should
be utilized to extend
that treatment whenever it's needed,
particularly for those who would
otherwise qualify for
a Medicaid program that
isn't subsequently
funded?
>> mhm. Uh
Mr. Chair representative, that's,
that's, that's a great
question. I
think to this
point, opioid
settlement dollars have generally
been used around structural
issues and,
and more front
loaded if you will
in terms of addiction.
And, and, and so I'm
thinking of the, the, the
inpatient treatment
intensive uh in
intensive outpatient, those
kinds of issues as well as
things like harm reduction.
Um uh uh student
based health centers of a wide variety
of things, but mostly on the front
end. Um rather
than, rather than looking at the
backend, that's not to say that
that's not something that we
should explore. And as the,
as our use of those funds
matures over time, I think
we'll, we'll get to that discussion,
but that's not been the focus so
far. And of course, I should
say there's State
allocation of money and then there's local
allocation of money and that that
differs a little bit as
well. >> And one
last question, Mr. Chair
Mr. Secretary with
respect to needing
more long
term rehabilitation
facilities. I understand
that down in
Lee County, they now have a
new hospital, but now they
have a fully vacant
hospital building
down there. Are we looking
at perhaps converting that
to a long term
facility to help where we need
it? >> Mr.
Chair representative, I wouldn't, I wouldn't
say that that we're at the
stage of any particular
building being
something that we're we're looking
at. I think what I'm interested in
working through with the behavioral
health collaborative is
what is the state's role
versus, versus
other players' role in
trying to expand capacity. And the
example in San Miguel County
in, in Las Vegas is a good one where
it's really the county taking
the lead and wanting to use
a building owned by the
General Services department on the
Bhi campus and
be the primary deliverer
of those services potentially
in some partnership with us.
And I think that's going to be what's going to
play out, looking at any particular
facility anywhere in the State is
what's the right mix of
who should do what,
where I'm really trying to stay
focused with the collaborative
on what do we need and how do we get
more of what we need
and where? >> Thank you, Mister
Chair. Thank you, Mr.
Secretary.
>> Thank you, Representative
Herndon.
And I guess that would apply
to um
Desert Hills as well.
Your efforts at obtaining
Desert Hills for a
facility.
Yeah.
Representative block
followed by Representative
Ferrari.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Mr. Secretary. I'll be really
quick. I appreciate you for
being here. I think it's a great that we're
having this overview. I
think it's awesome that
we're making progress
on the veterans home, but unfortunately,
sorry to hear about those
back steps that we had. So
I'm glad to hear that there's progress
there. It was awesome to see
the facility when we
were, when we were there
for the Veterans Affairs Committee
and to see the progress and it's
a beautiful facility and I cannot
wait until it's completely
opened and ready for
residents to go in. So
that's just one thing. And then
Mr. Mr. Chairman,
I just had a question about D
DS D I know
Dr Acosta, he did a great
job, I think at D DS D
and he was promoted so good job for
him. But who
is now running D Ds D?
And are we looking
for a new director
or is there some kind of search
process that's going on? >> Mr.
Chairman? Thank you, Mr. Chair,
representative of the Developmental
Disability Supports Division is
part of what has moved over to the
health care authority. So it's
part of that agency
effective today, Jen Rodriguez
is the acting um
acting director of
the division on uh uh
on Doctor
Costa's moving to run the public health
division. Um And
my understanding is
that uh is that the health care
authority is actually recruiting
for both the divisions that,
that we've moved over
DH I and D DS
D.
>> Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and
that's all I had. I appreciate it.
Thanks.
>> Representative, thank you,
Representative Block, Representative
>> Ferrari. Thank you Mr.
Chair and thank you, Secretary
Allen. Um
I was, I'm just
concerned that we don't
have throughout
most, most of the
southwest of the State,
you know, facilities so that
people can go
into um
treatment
um
and stay, you know,
close to family to be able to
visit and things like that.
Um
And you just kind
of
um mentioned
that we, you're not looking
at expanding more facilities
at this time, have
you considered, you know,
some of the things that communities
are trying to get funding
for
um kind of like a
jail
diversion type
facilities like the
Miami
Model
that uh
several representatives
and communities have gone
to visit
like um
Representative
Jones has.
>> Sure Mr. Chair, Representative
a couple of things first,
um really important to
remember the Department of Health isn't the only
game in town, right?
Uh The there are, there
are great facilities and, and
in fact, I visited one not long
ago in Lordsburg, that's a behavioral health
treatment program in an
outpatient, obviously,
um uh that helps
provide supports in that community.
So, um don't think
of, you know, our facilities
on the map as the the
100% network of,
of what's out there. Um
uh Similarly,
the health care authority
um rolled out this last
year and I think uh I think is
looking is likely to look
for further funds this
year for its rural health care
facilities grant fund.
Um that is specifically
for the purpose of providing
money. Um Two
entities that are looking to
expand health care
facilities of all kinds including
behavioral health in their uh
in their communities. And so
whether it's the Miami model
or the, or, or the
Phoenix model, which is also very good,
somewhat different. There are a bunch of
models out there. I don't know that the model
is particularly important, but
the, you know, the question is, do we have
partners? Do we have a
access to resources? And do we have a
strategy. I think, I
think we can't say
that the answer to any of
those is 100%
fully. Yes. But I think there's good
work being done on all those
fronts. OK, >> great.
And thank you Mr. Chair
and Mr. Secretary.
How, when was the
last time or how often
is the Behavioral health collaborative
meeting now?
>> Yeah, Mr. Chair representative right now,
the Behavioral Health Collaborative itself,
meetings are are on
pause while we're doing
this structural work. Looking at
how to update the structure
of the collaborative and its subcommittees
in light of how things have changed
since the law was initially
created. >> Ok.
Thank you. And Mr. Chair and
Mr. Secretary, I know we
haven't gotten a chance to
talk more about the
Alcohol Office of
Alcohol Policy
that you're overseeing.
Um
have are they
weighing in on some of
these things? Uh
you know, like what's going on
with the um facilities
that you are overseeing
for behavioral health or
for, you know, substance
abuse? >> You know,
thanks Mr. Chair
representative. The, the
Office of Alcohol Prevention is
in fact now up and running, we have a
director, all those things that I, I
think we didn't have the last time we
talked. Um uh uh
they are engaging
with the agency broadly and
with partners on a variety
of strategies around how to,
how to address
our challenges. Right now, I've
tasked them particularly with focusing
on a set of policy
recommendations of what kinds of things
can we do um
from, from a
statewide policy standpoint
to try to address um
you know, questions of,
of access
to both services, access
to, to
alcohol, drug
treatment, those kind of, those kinds of
things. So, absolutely, they're
engaged with us. >> Ok,
great. Because, you
know, Mr. Chair
Mr. Secretary
New Mexico being, you know,
three times the national average
and we're losing over
2000 people a
year and
who are part of the age,
mostly the age group that
is part of the workforce, we're
trying to retain and recruit
and um, we
need to save their lives.
And I think this
is a big
responsibility that we have
toward the State
to remedy this
yesterday. So
I appreciate, you know,
talking to you
more about that and
also gaining the
support for the different things that
are needed. >> Absolutely,
Representative Mr. Chair,
the Department of
Health has committed itself to a strategic
goal of a, of, of becoming the
healthiest State in the country by
2040 preventable
death is a, is a huge piece
of that. So whether it's uh
overdose deaths,
um death and illness
related to alcohol, that's a,
that's a, that's a primary
focus as we try to do that
work. Thank >> you very
much.
>> Thank you, Representative.
Um I just had one, some
concluding comments.
We, we had, we had
bill this as a State
health care facility,
staffing update
and, and
basically, you know, what,
what I understood from your
presentation is that
staffing is not the
problem at
turquoise
and sequoia.
Uh
water is the problem that
veterans,
there's, you
know, competitive salary
problem at in Las
Vegas at the Behavioral Health
Institute. But
that other than that, you really,
you know, if we could raise the
salaries. There really wouldn't be
a, a staffing
problem. And
yet when I look at your
census, you know, the,
the graph you showed of the census,
the only one that really
increased was the veterans
home
in July of last year it went
from, it was at 51.
It's at 91. Now
that 41 increase
is just about the totality
of the increase in the
total column. There
really is not much
change in,
in your overall capacity,
not capacity in your overall
census. The number of people
you're serving in the facilities
is pretty much stagnant
except for the veterans.
And that's because you opened up the
new facility.
But, but
turquoise is lower
than it was last year.
Uh Sequoia
looks marginally
larger but it's only at 18.
So it's, it's hard to tell.
There's no number in July of
last year look like it was about
10. So maybe eight more kids
there.
Other than that,
there's not much real change
in the census.
And, and I,
I'm, I can't
begin to express my
concern that
as we race into
this
alcohol
drug abuse
epidemic that we
have our capacity
isn't growing. I mean,
we're, we're not actually,
I mean, if we were
contracting with some private
hospitals to pick up the
slack, but we
have fewer people in turquoise
today than we did. And I
know you said 20 is not
much, but that's
half, we have half
as many people as we used to
serve at turquoise.
So my overall impression
is that we're not, we're
losing ground, not gaining
ground. And
maybe if the rehab
center can get
license for
and then we could actually staff
it and actually at
maybe 15 or 20 people
there that would pick up some of the
slack from turquoise.
But our, our State
capacity for dealing with
alcohol and
drugs
under this graph
is less than
it was be, you know, a
few years ago,
we're not, we're not getting
more people into, into
treatment when that's the
need. So
what is the waiting list? For
example, at Turquoise Lodge
today, >> Mr.
Chair, a
couple of comments first,
I I would
characterize your summary
just a little differently than,
than, than you did. I
would say that in
Albuquerque and Las Luas
staffing
is, is less
of a concern than it
is in other parts of the
State everywhere else. It's
dire. Um
And that's not just at Las
Vegas, that's all of our
facilities that are, that are
outside the the
metropolitan area. The the
staffing challenges are,
are dire.
Um They're
not dire in the metropolitan
area but they're not good. And,
and so if I, if I
left an impression that that
there's not a staffing challenge,
II, I apologize for
that. I think, I,
I think also
if we, if we think
about our facilities
as the capacity for
alcohol and drug treatment in the
State, we're vastly
understating
the capacity, that's not the
State capacity. The State
plays a fairly
narrow role that needs
to be updated
and refocused again
from its pre
Medicaid expansion
perspective as a safety
net provider. Um
But, but we are just
a very small element
of the total capacity for
service in most of these
lines of businesses. There are a couple where
we're the only game in town
forensic treatment for,
for instance. Um
But I think that the challenge
is that, that we need to
look at the whole, at the
whole system, at all of
the providers, at all of the
capacity at a at
all of the people who
staff those facilities.
We're all short. Uh
And, and New Mexico
is not the only State that's short.
All the states are short. I think
some of the discussion you had with doctor Griffin
about um foreign
trained uh health care providers,
I think is, is right on the mark in
terms of the kinds of things
we need to look at as an overall
State system. Uh And
so, you know, we're working
to, to increase
the census that we have
in our facilities and
that, you know, that change in
in Sequoia May
have been a small number of people. It almost
doubled um over the
uh over the course of this period of time.
So we're working
incrementally piece by piece
to be able to increase our
um uh our
census. But it's really
a mistake. I think to think of that
as the overall system
is a very small
piece.
>> Thank you.
Um,
anybody else? Thank
you very much for coming and presenting
the information. Um,
we, I, I would
say that there are two takeaways
we ought to consider for the,
for the upcoming
legislative Session. One would
be to try to find
a way to, to
increase those wages
because if, if they
can't
out, you
know,
offer higher wages in
Walmart, we, we're, we're
doomed. Uh
And if we can't,
uh, expand the
space available and the Gateway
Center, by the way, has enormous amounts
of space. It's not a question
of space. It's just a question
of the State asking
for it and demanding
it and us backing them
and giving them the money to pay
for it so that we could get
bigger,
more
fully developed
facilities there if it's not
just a question of beds,
but I just think it's terrible
that we only have 20 people at
Sequoia. I mean, at, at
turquoise
when I thought we were
working our way up to 40.
So, and maybe we
need 50 or 60
there. I just
have to say when we were
at campus
last two weeks
ago, they said
yes, when we, we run them through
these first three stages and
then we send them to turquoise
for their long term care. And
then they come back here after
that to the
uh community care, whatever
that next stage is the two
or three years in an apartment.
It all sounded like a great
system. I had no idea.
There are only 20 beds at, at
turquoise available.
So that's the
bottleneck. Uh,
if we don't have more
beds, I mean, if we
can't serve more people there
than 20 at a time,
that whole cares
campus thing is, is,
is operating
with one hand tied behind its
back. It's just not
gonna work.
Um But,
but thank you. Now, Members,
here's the deal. We have lunch served
and it'll gonna get cold if you don't start
serving it. We have six
people signed up for
um, public
comment and we're gonna start
that but don't wait
for the public comment and
start serving yourselves
and, and, and eating
while we hear from
the following
people
and I, I May be messing
up your name, but it is Steve
Fender here.
Ok. Is I, did
I get it close? Is I even close?
Ok. Good, Steve. Come
on up. Your first,
Anna Nelson is second
Alvin Sali is
third
Lorraine Mendiola is
fourth
Julia Retton is from
the hospital association is
after her
and
there's a, that's it. There's
only four because James Kaiser
is going to speak tomorrow
and then we have two online.
So please
Mr. Fender.
>> Thank you mister Chair and
thank you Members of the Committee for
giving me a minute to,
to speak about behavioral
health in
Taos County. And in
rural and frontier
areas and, and I'm
very grateful to see
Representative Ferrari
here and
Representative Ortez,
both of them have been champions
for an issue that
kind of plays into
all of this, which is
the alcohol
excise tax
and increasing that, which
has not been increased since
1993.
And I consider
it a shame
and,
and very disappointing
that money
from the
alcohol
lobby
has taken precedence
over the lives
of our citizens,
our friends and our family.
And I, I hope that
that is something that is,
is addressed at
our next Session.
Um What I wanted
to just give you a short
update on and, and hopefully
at some point, we can have a
chance to give more
of an update from
the standpoint of rural and
frontier areas and in
dealing
with substance use
disorder and
alcohol. And,
um, what we're trying to do
here is provide a continuum
of care for people and,
and uh, uh
Secretary Allen
mentioned this. We've been
working for six years now
to get a detox center
open in Taos.
Um, so we don't even
have a starting point
yet. And,
uh, and of
course, this is unfortunate
we're working in that direction,
but we, we're looking
at not only
detox but
also
uh
residential treatment
and transitional
care and,
and the other aspects
that are, that are necessary
to get people
from a point
where they
want to recover
to a point that they are on
the road to recovery
and what's been talked
about. And, and I've
heard it several times here
today. The
challenge is, and I'm, I'm
a person in long term recovery
myself. And
the challenge is
that when
somebody decides
that they want to get into
recovery and
we have to tell them,
ok,
we'll get you
somewhere in
two weeks or
three weeks or a
month.
By the time that
happens,
they can, too
many other things can happen,
including they can die.
And this is a
deadly disease.
And we have to remember that it
is a disease.
The, the stigma
surrounding this
would have people
believe that it's a more moral
issue. It is not a
moral issue, it is
a disease and
it is treatable
and we need to
provide the services
that can, that can
treat people
currently
in Taos, the
alternatives for somebody
are the hospital or the
jail that
is unacceptable.
And in many
rural and frontier
areas, that's the
case. Those are the, those
are the options for people.
And so we need to,
we need to take a look
at, at
how we're taking care
of, of our
friends and family. This
is not just some other
people, these are our
friends and family. I don't
talk to anybody
in our community or
anywhere else who has
not been affected
by, by
this uh by this
disease. And it
is only
getting worse.
And so
unless we take this
seriously and
start providing
services, not
only in the metropolitan
area but in rural and
frontier areas,
then um then
the problem is just going to
continue. So
with that, I want to
thank you once again, Mr.
Chairman and thank you Committee
Members for allowing
me to speak. >> Thank
you, Steve. Thanks very
much,
Anna Nelson, followed
by Alvin
Sali,
>> good afternoon mister
Chair and Members of the Committee.
I'm really grateful for this
opportunity to join you
all. I'm Ana Nelson.
I'm the director for the Center
for Excellence and Social
Work. And
I bring today with
me 30 years of experience
in the helping professions.
25 of which I have
served families
in New Mexico who
have been uh CYFD
JJ or, or protective
service involved and the
communities who invite them back
home uh
after
detention or
placement. And so
I also wanted to share, I have
been a social work educator
since 2009.
So this is the experience
I'm bringing to the dialogue
today. Before
you, you have a
brief of
a brief, a 2024
snapshot of New Mexico's
social workers. This
includes factors influence
our professional well being
and an interactive
map that does
have a link within the
document that
allows you to look
at your counties
specifically how many
social workers are licensed
within your county, what
type of liger they
have and what
source of
social work they would be able
to provide based on their level
of licensure.
So uh briefly about
the center, we are located
within the New Mexico
Highlands, Fo Valdez
School of Social work. Uh
Though we serve
all schoolss, all social
workers across the
State, uh We
also uh foster
collaborative networks, promote
best practices and social work
education. We provide
continuing education to
our existing workforce
and we enhance pathways
to social work as a career.
So I bring this brief to
you today because it is
very relevant to your dialogue
around workforce issues
specifically for the profession
of social work. Uh
It prevent, it presents
formative findings of the
survey and you'll receive
the full report in
August during your August
meeting. Uh
So I wanted to
highlight a few brief things
from the survey. We learned
that a strong Majority of our
workforce feel pride
in being social workers
and we gain satisfaction
from our work.
However many of us
struggle financially to
make ends meet.
43%
report student loans
are adversely impacting
their financial well-being.
37%
work more than one
job to make ends
meet. Uh Over
half have experienced
burnout and vicarious
traumatization.
39% have considered
leaving the profession.
15% of our
workforce right now
is considering going to
another State and
34% plan
to retire within the next 10
years while we only
have 69
provisionally licensed social
workers in the pipeline
currently. So this
foreshadows an even
greater workforce challenge
in the future. In
closing, the center team
would like to extend our gratitude
to Representative Chavez
for your sponsorship and
advocacy in receiving the House of
Representatives certificate
of recognition.
Uh looking at
environmental justice as a
core competency for social
workers working in New
Mexico, as
we speak, at least
two people have lost their
lives and approximately
8000 people were
displaced from wildfires
in our State. 100
people just yesterday
required emergency
rescue from flooding
in rados. So and burn
scar flooding is putting
Las Vegas water supply
at risk. So this
is an emergent
issue. New Mexico is
experiencing the driest
period in 1200
years where all
333 of
our counties statewide
are considered drought disaster
zones. We also
know that exposure to extreme
heat contributes to
increased aggression,
violence, suicide,
post traumatic stress
and mood, anxiety and
substance misuse
disorders. We
urgently need New
Mexico specific
research and environmental
social work practice to foster
community driven strategies
for climate change related
behavioral health disparities
and our social work workforce
stands ready to
respond. We would
also like to express a warm
note of thanks to superintendent
Clay Bailey and
his team at the New Mexico
Regulation and Licensing
Department for their
assistance in obtaining the
current list of licensed
social workers. Without
this access we would not have been
able to create this
accurate interactive
map that you all have before
you. Thank you, Mr.
Chair and Members of the Committee
for allowing this time to provide
this brief and
interactive map. We really
hope it's a useful tool to
each of you. Uh
so that you can look
at what social
workers are doing within your
county. And
thank you so much.
>> Thank you very much, Anna. Uh
Let me also
remind the audience you're, you're
free to come up and help
yourself because there's a lot
of food up here. So we
want to make sure that, that
um we don't waste it and,
and you're welcome to join us for
lunch. Come up and help
yourselves. Alvin
Sali that doesn't include
you. You have to buy
your,
>> but I am on a diet.
Mr. Chairman, I'm trying
to uh thank
you all um for a few
minutes here to visit with you and
thank you Members
for all the
hours you put in and
dedication and
trying to improve the lives
of New Mexicans.
I want to, first
of all, follow up on
you all have appropriated
the last few years,
$83
million to
increase the number of
social workers in New
Mexico. Social
work is the largest profession
in behavioral health.
And um you've heard how
important it is in many
respects.
Um I was hoping
and maybe it will happen
uh tomorrow during the higher
Ed presentation
to find out where
we are with the
$83
million. Um
The um $50
million went to
increase the number of
social work faculty by
25 at the universities
to teach full time.
That's four courses
uh which should be
producing 500
new social workers
per year. So
I'm, I'm wondering where we are with
that. I think that's critical.
But you all
had appropriated that funding
and then the additional
$20 million
for, uh,
helping with, uh,
supervision
and tuition
cost. I think
that's critical as we've
heard from Dr
Harrison and,
um, Dr
Nelson.
Um,
one of the things we've
done, uh, with the, uh,
social work task force
which the Senator
funded uh through
his junior money
is to look
at what are the steps
to a pathway
to a full social work
task force in New
Mexico? And I
must say there are a number
of barriers there.
And I think
even though I think Dr
Harrison said,
anybody says
they know anything about workforce
development is delirious,
but social workers have been called
worse. So we'll go
ahead with that. But I think we've
identified that and I think it would
be very helpful
if there is some money to set
aside to study
either through Dr
Nelson's Institute
or others.
Exactly how to
overcome those barriers.
Because uh back
to what Representative block
mentioned earlier, we
have had success in New
Mexico. We did
have a full
staffed social
work workforce in this
State, one of the few in the
country and
social workers under the
New Mexico statue.
If you practice
social work,
like in CYFD, if
you're doing social work, you
have to be licensed.
The statute is very clear if
you call yourself a social
worker. You have to be
licensed in New
Mexico. And
so we, you
all have greatly
expanded through
funding those
um opportunities
to increase the number of
uh social workers. The
other thing uh following
up is retention
is so critical.
And you heard that from Dr
Harrison,
we have study after
study that shows that if people
doing social work
are licensed social
workers, they stay in those
jobs longer. And that only
makes sense. If
you're were
educated to be a computer
scientist and you're hired to
do child abuse
investigations, you're
gonna look for a job in your own
field as soon as you can.
But if you've spent
at least two years,
if not four years of
higher education, done
internships and so
forth and decided
this is what your career is
going to be. You're gonna
stay as social
work much longer.
So I
would say
we need to continue to
focus on retention.
But I think we also can
in many respects,
uh continue to increase
the number of social workers
that were attracting to the
profession and in
that way, better
serve be behavioral
health staffing issues.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you. And, and one
of the things that was included
in that
uh
appropriation that Alvin has
mentioned over the last several years
was some money to
help UN M begin
the phasing
in the development of
a school of social work at
UN M. So that
we would have an additional
resource of
educating social workers. So.
All right, good. Thank
you. Um
Next is, and
she's, she'll be our last
in-person um
public commenter. We have two
online. Uh
Julia
Roten.
>> Ok. Don't worry.
Just
Proteus
Presbyterian.
>> Hi there. Uh Thank you
for being here in Taos
and, and allowing me to speak in
public comment. Uh My name is
Julia Ritten and I
work with the New Mexico
Hospital Association.
I am pinch hitting for
our President Troy Clark
who was a big
pinch hit since he's a good, I
don't know, at least a foot taller than I
am. So he's on his way
in here and uh asked
me to step in. This
has been our first opportunity
to um attend
an LH A meeting this
interim and we
wanted to express
our sincere gratitude
and thank you to all of you
for the uh
incredible support that
we received during the legislative
Session for um
the Health Care Delivery and Access
Act, which is
a new State
supplemental Medicaid
payment program that will
um support
our hospitals financially in a
number of ways.
Uh The program is anticipated
to bring um uh
net over just
$1 billion
with A B uh starting
next year. Um
And we
cannot overemphasize
in any way the impact that that will
have on hospital operations,
ranging from uh
workforce
retention recruitment,
all of these things, uh all the way
to uh clinical quality
improvement as well
as the um really,
really important um funding
that we received,
that we call bridge funding to
help uh the
rural hospitals,
including the Incredible Hospital
here in Taos. Uh Holy Cross
make it um through
until those funds start flowing
in. Um the beginning
of next year that we
anticipate, um
we uh received
almost unanimous support,
only one vote in opposition
and that one vote in opposition is
no longer a part of the legislature
already. So I just,
I want to thank you all. We
also owe a debt
of gratitude to the Governor and
her team for her support.
Um I just, I need to
shout out Rena at
the Health care authority. She's been
great in implementing this program. It
requires CM SS approval. So we're
in that process. Um
As well as the support
of uh the
Legislative Finance Committee. I want
to thank both uh Ruby An
and um Allegra
for meeting with us last
week um to talk
about their analysis of
this program and the report
that they'll be presenting this afternoon and then
being open to receiving um
some of our feedback on some concerns
that we had with some of the facts
presented in that report.
Um And so Troy
and I will be here uh through
the rest of today and
tomorrow and are happy to
uh offline answer any questions
or um you know, give any
clarification that's needed. But
as always, just want to say thank you
for all the work that you do
and um in supporting all
of our hospitals.
Uh It's,
it's gonna be a really
monumental change when this money gets
flowing. Uh For our
Members, we represent
47 of the state's hospitals,
every single CEO including
James here in the audience is in
support of that program
as well as a handful of hospitals
that are not our Members. And we
hope that um we all feel
this as patients ourselves
and that uh that
it can um fix some of the
problems that we have here in the State. So I just
wanted to say thank you and
um happy early
fourth of July.
>> Nice.
Um Again,
a reminder that the
meal um is
available to anybody in the audience,
not just for the Committee
and it's been provided
by uh
the generosity of P
MS and Larry Martinez.
Thank you, Larry for, for
providing us with a nice
meal today.
Great. So now we
have two people
online

Next is Yoli
Diaz.
Are, are you there, Miss
Diaz?
Yes, now we can

Thank you. You'll easy

do have one last person
uh
in the audience who wanted to
make comment. And that's Eileen
Luhan, the newest
member of the Holy Cross
Board of
Directors.
>> Good afternoon,
everybody. I am
very honored to be here
in front of all of you.
Very intelligent
people.
My name is Eileen
Luhan and I am enrolled
member of the Taos
Pueblo
and I was recently
appointed
by
our Taos Pueblo Governor
and his administration
to serve on the
Holy Cross Medical
Board.
What I want to say is
that I take this appointment
very seriously.
And I'm learning from
professional leaders of
the Holy Cross
Hospital.
I have had the
opportunity to
observe and witness
the workings of the board
Members, the
CEO and
directors of all
departments.
They are awesome
people. They
take their job
seriously
looking forward to the
ultimate goal
which is
to provide our
community,
high quality
health care
choices close
to home in an
environment of
continual
improvement and
service excellence.
So in
order to uphold this
goal, we
as a team at
the Holy Cross
Hospital are
here today to inform
you of our needs
to support the
institution.
We have the challenge
of providing
100 and 1%
services to our
community.
I thank you
for this opportunity
and hope to meet you again
in our journey as
service
providers.
Thank you for your
attention.
>> Thank you very much, Miss
Lujan. So
Members that concludes
public comment, unless there was anybody
else here who wanted to
say anything,
Ellen. Are you sure you didn't
sign up? This will
be
unusual.
Ok.
I, I thought you were the
public member of this Committee. I
didn't realize we didn't, we hadn't
officially appointed
one.
So with that, we're gonna
take a uh before
we get into the
afternoon agenda, we
are gonna take a 15 minute
break. So we'll come
back at, uh at
about
118
and resume our work at
118. So until then we'll
take a break uh
and be back in 15
minutes.
>> I,
because I
