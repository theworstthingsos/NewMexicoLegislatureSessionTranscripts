The Public Academy of the
Performing Arts. So put that on
your calendar now. I see your
phone's out. That's the last
Saturday in July and we look
forward to seeing you and thank
you, Madam Chair.
Good morning, Madam Chair. Good
morning all. I'm Charlotte
Little. I represent House
District 68 on the northwest
side of Albuquerque, the
general, the vicinity of
Paradise Hills and then on a
ranch.
Uh, so good to have you all here
this morning. Thank you.
OK, thank you, and our vice
chair.
Madam Chair and members of the
committee, um, I'm Senatory Gray
Hemphill from Silver City. I
represent Senate District 28.
Wonderful to be here. Good to
see you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. My name
is Mark Edwards. I'm with the
Legislative council Service.
Uh, my nephew plays for the.
ing Arts Academy, uh.
There's the public academy for
the Performing Arts, PAPA,
Poppa. So they're known as the
potato heads,
uh, but they're very, very good.
Thank you, ma'am. Sure, um.
Over on my left is Rebecca
Griego who's with the
legislative council service. She
is also our bill clerk during
the session and then over on my
right.
It being a Gaynor, another
drafter with the legislative
council service and one of our
IT people, Marshall, and I
don't, and Cato was in the back,
but I don't know their last
names.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you, um, my name is Debbie
Serignon. I represent House
District 21 in Bernalo County,
the Monzano High School area, if
you know Albuquerque. All right,
I believe we are ready, um, our
first presenters are next
generation challenges facing
9/11, um, county a affiliates
affiliates
One in and Nicole Brown. Come on
up, whenever you're ready.
Estes
40.
morning.
If you'll keep one my card, one
my off.
So that we don't get a
statement.
Good morning, Madam Chair.
Members of the committee, my
name is Julian Senna. I'm the
current GIS affiliate chair for
New Mexico Counties and also the
supervisor for the GIS division
in Santa Fe County.
Joining me today is Nicole
Brown, who is the vice chair for
the E 911 directors affiliate
with New Mexico counties.
And also the director for the E
911.
Communication Authority in San
Juan County.
We come before the committee
today to express the need.
For amendments to the enhanced
9/11 Act.
Article 63-90 NMSA 1978.
Due to the technological
advancements in modern
telecommunication systems.
An increase in New Mexico's 911
fund revenue stream is required
to prevent budgetary shortfalls
at the local government level.
And so Nicole and I would like
to provide the committee with
the following information.
Good morning, um, you'll see we
give you some graphs and one of
those, uh, talks about
Staffing and some other issues,
the 911 emergency surcharge of
51 cents is not increased since
the inception in 1989, um, we've
um added some different lines to
it, so wire line wireless, VoIP
phones, prepaid phones, but it's
never been increased from the 51
cents, um, since 1989. Uh, this
is the 3rd lowest surcharge in
the nation despite New Mexico
having one of the highest
numbers of 911 calls per capita.
So we
of around 1,169
calls in New Mexico.
Um, and that information was
given to us by the Department of
Finance, 911 Bureau.
Only one, PA or public service
answering point was fully
staffed in 2024.
Uh, we, as a director's
affiliate believe that some of
that can be attributed to um low
wages, 911 operators are um, you
don't do it for the money, but
they should also be paid.
Uh, you know, compensated
appropriately for the work they
do do because it is so vital to
our communities. So it's hard to
keep to retain them if their
wages aren't.
What, what they should be.
Thank you, Nicole.
So what we're really talking
about the big buzzword that
everyone's going to be hearing
is next generation 911, uh, also
known as NG.
one.
The successful statewide
implementation of the next gen
911 system.
will require significant
investments, new costs.
An interoperable is the key
phrase here.
IT hardware, software, and
integrated systems.
The national emergency number
associations I-3 network.
Also known as Nina
For various components of that
system, one of them being known
as the emergency Services IP
network or EEET.
There is also another component
of this system called next
generation Co Services, AKAN
GCS.
And costs as you see on the
slide are projected to be in the
millions, 3 million for the
Ezine, 3.5 just for the NGCS.
You
Implementation and maintenance
of cybersecurity through the
Office of Homeland Security.
And this cybersecurity.
estimated at about a million
dollars.
These
System requirements are ever
evolving, as you are aware,
cybersecurity is a big threat to
our nation and so the projected
number of a million is
essentially where we're at
today.
But it could certainly rise.
Implementation of NG 901
computer uh compliant.
Computer aided dispatch systems
or what are referred to
frequently as CA systems.
At each 911 dispatch center or
as Nicole referred to them as
the public service answering
point, the POs.
s across the state initial
deployment.
It was a $7 million as for 14
PAs per year.
But we do have a total of 43 PAs
that cover the state of New
Mexico and.
or recurring maintenance for
these systems is estimated at 3
million.
Along with this, all of the
local geospe geospatial address
data must meet these.
Standards for next generation
911.
Consulting expenses, statewide
data processing, quality
assurance and quality control
efforts, statewide data
evaluation and validation,
special projects for entries.
without adequate GI capabilities
and capacities will be affected.
also the
of the 700 megahertz
interoperable radios for
dispatches in 4 and first
responders is estimated about 4
million.
We are aware that there are
additional bills regarding the
radios, but what we're
specifically discussing here are
actually putting handheld radios
into first responders and
dispatchers, so there's
additional incurred cost.
Finally,
New Mexico's 911 fund has some
of the strictest limitations on
what 911 emergency surcharge can
cover compared to nearly every
other state in the nation.
With our 911 fund only covering
about 20% of PSAP costs versus
the national average of 50%.
PAP salariesA systems and the
700 megahertz radio systems
costs are currently passed to
local governments. This creates
an inequitable 911 landscape
across the state.
Especially in our more rural
counties and small towns.
And I'll just say.
the 911 expenses are not
optional.
If these costs aren't funded
through the 911 surcharges, one
of two things will happen.
One, these expenses may be
deferred.
Potentially risking life and
property.
And these costs too will be
shifted to county and municipal
general funds significantly
impacting local governments and
Eventually
Forcing them to cut other
services.
So what we're asking and what
we're working um with Senator
Patilla.
is an increase of 99 cents of
the surcharge, making it $1.50.
Um, we are also asking to expand
the cost categories that are
covered by the 911 fund to
include P POP wages, the next
911 cost CAD systems, um,
something that's coming with
next to 911 is the geospatial
data, so that's why GIS is
affiliated with us because
they're working hand in hand
with us on that development
geospatial data is much more
accurate. When a 911 caller
calls us, we are going to get a
much better picture of where
they are, but that all comes.
With cost like
Julian said.
And then, of course, um, also
include the interoperable
radios. Um, we'd also like to
clarify the language of the act.
It's called the E 911 Act or
Enhanced 9/11 Act. We no longer
are using the enhanced 911
system.
We're moving on to the next gen
911 system to make it a little
more evergreen as technology
develops.
Just simply call it
The 911 Act.
Um, and then adding some
appropriate modern technology
definitions. Um, the reason CAD
systems or um computer dispatch
systems are not being funded
right now is because that
technology I don't think was
really common in 1989 when the
act was created. And so the
verbiage is just not there. So
if we could update it and and
kind of try to make it a little
more evergreen so that it can
grow as technology changes and
um and I think we are ready to
stand for any questions.
your presentation. Do we have
any questions?
Representative.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for the presentation
this morning. Um, my question
has to do with uh Madam, uh, it
would be helpful to um
If uh
So I receive my bills uh for
either wireless or um or our uh
all inclusive home setup.
And what I see on there are
those surcharges right now. And
so I'm wondering, I try to make
heads and tails of what those
actually are. Sometimes I will
call the providers to see.
Explain this to me what this
does. So if, if possible, um,
would you please, it would be
very helpful to clarify you, you
went through very quickly what
and I heard that one of them
include the wireless fees in
there, the surcharges. Would you
mind expanding that list to let
us know what all is going to be
included in this, what you
foresee, I, I appreciate the,
the um description.
Of what these do, but uh.
For many of us trying to make
heads and tails of our bills.
This would be very helpful.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Uh, Madam Chair,
um, so it's.
It's only ever the 51 cents and
it's perfect phone, so per
landline or wireless phone, um,
void phone or a prepaid phone.
So if you, you know, if your
family has 4 cell phones in your
family, you'll pay 51 cents on
each of those cell phones.
And, um, we, like I said, we've
We've gone back to uh, you know.
We started with wireline phones
in 1989. There weren't a whole
lot of cell phones. And then in
2001, we added cell phones and
then in 2017, we added the VoIP
and the prepaid. So I, I feel
like we've really tried to stick
to the 51 cents and just add
each, you know, phone category
as technology grew and I feel
like we've kind of done
everything we can do with 51
cents and it, it's just that
time to increase it, um, on your
handouts.
You'll see one of the graphs if
adjusted for inflation, our
surcharge should be at $1.29. So
the 99 cents increase would
bring us.
Just below the national average
and and really bring us to a
good place for the state of New
Mexico.
OK, so, uh thank you uh for that
response. Um,
I, I think what would help me,
uh, what would be helpful would
it be to um.
Uh, have a description of what's
included in the surcharges or
maybe because you described the
9/11 piece you described a
couple of other uh pieces in
there, and that's what I'm uh.
I would like to know about.
What, what the service would
include.
Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. We
can, we can research that and
have that more.
I, I don't know.
I don't know what the others and
I don't know what other
surcharges. I, I'm only familiar
with the 911 surcharge, and I
don't know if any of our experts
back here we have some.
Yeah, if you want.
Morning, Madam Chair, members of
the committee. My name is Steven
Weinopf, 911 bureau chief with
the Department of
Finance Administration, local
government division.
Um, so we're specifically
talking about the enhanced 911
surcharge.
And then as mentioned, it's a 51
cents surcharge on landlines,
wireless phones.
Um
voip systems and uh os just to
clarify, it's not based off my
phone, it's by simultaneous call
volume.
And then
For prepaid wireless, it's, it's
a 1.38% um charge on point of
sale.
Slight difference
Um, but when you look at your
cell phone bill.
It'll expressly say enhance 911
emergency surcharge, um, 51
cents.
That is the specific surcharge
we are looking to address.
With this initiative.
Thank you, Madam Chair, members
of the committee.
Thank you very much for that
clarification. Uh, I that just
settled more with me that was
what I heard you say, but I
appreciate that extra clarity.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Representative Nix is
Representative Harper.
Good morning. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Um, yeah, thank you for
being here this morning. Really
appreciate learning more about
Uh, this, this service in this
program, uh, just a few.
Questions. So, Madam Chair, uh,
you mentioned in your
presentation that
Mexico has some strict
limitations on what the
Surcharge can cover.
Um
Then looking at the last.
Page in your presentation.
Um
Just trying to understand what
that strictness is, what other
states.
Sometimes covers what New Mexico
covers.
You maybe just speak a little
bit to this uh column, you know,
differences in what's approved
in New Mexico versus other
places and
Help me understand that.
Thank you, Madam Chair
Representative Harper.
Um,
from my perspective as a GIS
professional, they can speak to
the computer aided dispatch
systems.
There are certain
functionalities within these
systems that are now
map-centric.
Uh, the data that we produce in
GIS.
is essentially ingested into
these new systems.
Under the current statute these
systems are not funded.
the current surcharge. So from
the GIS perspective, um, being
able to support computer aided
dispatch systems given that
we're headed to.
and geospatial
um identifying information is is
critical.
Yeah, so, so Madam Chair, thank
you. So,
Yeah, so looking at this chart,
right? So when New Mexico
implemented the enhanced 911.
Surcharge, they.
You know, the legislature made a
decision what they would allow
to be funded out of it and what
they would not.
I'm just looking at this table,
I'm, I'm interested to see that,
you know, personnel wages were
specifically excluded from this,
right?
That administration was
specifically excluded.
Um, you know, uh, facility work
was.
Specifically excluded, right? So
I'm trying to understand.
Um, why that was the case.
Um
And I don't know if any of you
were there when this was passed
and what the discussions were,
but that's interesting to me
that
That legislature at that time
felt, OK.
You know, this is gonna show up
on everyone's bill in the state
and we're likely to get some
flack for that.
So let's be very specific about
what this is going to cover so
we can go back to our
constituents and when we're
called on it, we can say, no,
this is funding X, Y and Z and
not A, B, and C.
So, uh, Madam Chair and panel,
do you have any?
Did you speak to people who were
there? Do you know why? I mean,
you understand what?
Why the legislature made this
decision.
Uh, Madam Chair and
Representative Harper, I was not
there and I can't speak or
speculate to that, but I do know
that the technology in 911 is.
I mean, exponentially increased,
and I just don't think that that
that was something.
They could have foreseen. Um, I,
the way it looks to be on this
chart is they funded.
The the 911, the phone system,
right? And, and that it was a
big technology improvement at
the time for people to call 911
at 911 to receive, you know, the
phone number and potentially an
address. I mean, that was, that
was a huge improvement at that
time. So I think that it was
more focused on handling that,
that traffic and and
understanding that and not
knowing how technology would
evolve in order to support.
We process 911 calls. So I think
um.
You know, 911 operators are not,
uh, this is getting into another
issue, but a little bit, um, one
operators are not classified as
first responders. They're
classified as clerical
employees, and I think because
at the time they were answering
phones and processing
information, um, and the
expectation of what a 911
operator can do for you now when
you call 911 has increased,
right? You, you expect a
professional on the other end of
the line, who knows how to help
you in your worst moment.
And so the technology and the
training and everything that has
increased.
On the 9/11 side of things. I
just don't think.
Anyone could have foreseen how
fast that was going to grow. And
so when the act was created,
the, the verbage is just not
there to support us using it for
anything other than the phone
system.
Yeah, that was a great help,
madam chair and yeah.
Madam Chair Representative
Harper, if I may add to that.
Um
We, we looking back at the
previous legislature that had
approved.
when one act
They actually did a good thing
in leaving some vagueness within
the statute because after 1989,
we came to
It was the year 2001.
And they had the addition.
Of
a voip phones or no excuse me,
the um.
Cell phones and prepaid cell
phones.
So they left room
Mm
grow, but
If you look at it, and Nicole's
point, it's more specific to the
actual technology of taking the
calls and handling the calls. It
seems like that's where their
mind was really focused at that
time.
And I was actually just given a
little piece of information.
Some of it, some of the.
So some of it is in roll, so,
um, and not necessarily in
statute. So there is some, I
guess, wiggle room there that we
could do some rulemaking
changes, but I think, again,
stressing that evergreen's fun
for the future and address it in
statutes. So, so thank you,
Madam Chair and panel. That was
actually what I was looking for.
That was really helpful. Thank
you. um.
Uh, and maybe just a couple
other questions, but first, um,
Uh, whenever I hear that there
are opportunities to make
changes in rule.
That is so much easier than
getting something through the
legislature. So I
Um, I'm not discouraging you
from carrying a bill, and I know
Senator Padilla is really good
at, you know, getting things
through the legislatures, you
have a great sponsor.
Um
But I would just encourage you
to also in parallel.
I consider uh
Rule changes that would be
helpful and and work on those as
well.
Um
OK, so going on to the numbers
then, um,
So, so ma'am Sha panel, I heard,
uh, and I seen the presentation
here that the fund covers about
20%.
Of
PSAP costs.
So could you maybe, I guess
first share what, what is that
dollar amount, that 20%?
So I can back calculate what the
100% is.
And, and then the second part of
that question is,
Um, that other 80% is covered.
Through local governments?
Madam Chair Representative
Harper, um, so we have.
Some information here from um
from the Department of Finance,
um 911 bureau, so it looks like.
The total, I'm reading this
wrong, uh, the total fund, um,
last year, the actuals.
Um, we're 20 million, 647.
I'm gonna let Steven walk
through this.
He knows more than I do.
And Madam Chair, members of the
committee, uh, so in fiscal year
23.
The enhanced 911 fund uh
distributed.
$13,751,149 to local
governments.
So
So I just answered.
The second part of your
question.
Um
PAs, otherwise known as public
safety answering points, um, you
know, they are the center that
answers your 911 call and
they're also the center that
dispatches.
Please fire EMS, um.
Those
He saps are funded largely
through local governments, uh,
typically a consortium of local
governing bodies that enter into
a JPA.
Um
Operating costs, you know, are
funded by those local
governments, some of that
technology, some of that 911
equipment is funded through um
A variety of
Bond sales at the local level.
through state capital outlay.
I could, I could speak to my own
center in San Juan.
through a
a.
percentage of a GRT tax.
Um, that we split with our local
EMS.
And, um, we are.
I mean, we, we've maxed out,
we've got taking as much of
that.
That is allowed in um the the
statue and um I'm currently
running at.
Just about as much as I can, um,
my budget or my combined center
is a roll over and we.
I, I mean, if, if we
Tap out that fund, then it
becomes funding from our the
agencies that we dispatch for.
So our local fire our fire
departments, police departments
have to find the money within
their budgets to then contribute
to our budget, um, so the fund,
you know, helps with training
costs and with the cost of
maintaining our phone system,
but that's all it's limited to,
right? I have several other
costs keep us redundant.
To keep us up and running when
there's a power outage. 911
can't go down. So there is a lot
of funding that comes over, um,
and in County we're very
fortunate. We have a a good
strong GRT right now, and, and
plan for that, but um having a
little more leeway within the
state fund would, would really.
And, and that GRT tax is an
option, not all counties have.
exercise that county option.
Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair and
everyone for the answers here.
So,
Um, if I understood correctly.
Um, in FY 23 since.
You know FY 24 is just kind of
Closing here shortly. Um, it was
about $13.7 million.
And if that accounts for about
20%.
Of
The PSAP costs, then the
And the, the maths is that
You're looking at roughly 68.5,
you know, let's just say $70
million.
Is the total cost.
Um, for, for this program.
And right now that $13.7 million
is coming from a 51 cent.
Charge and Madam Chair and
panel, you're proposing raising
it to
doll or something $1.50 so it'd
be a 99 cents.
OK, so panel, so essentially,
uh, multiplying that by 3.
Right now, so that 13.7, you'd
expect that to raise roughly $41
million ish.
Under this new
This new
Proposal
Which would be
60%
Yeah, 20 times 3.
Maths works.
Yeah. All right, so, so I guess
my
Thank you for helping me
understand kind of the numbers
and and what our generate and of
course, knowing that, you know,
my constituents, including my
wife are not going to be happy
to see, you know, the cell
phone.
They go up
Um
You help me just understand a
little bit about.
Where you would expect.
This money to be used and really
the lens I'm looking through is
right now the local governments
are making it work.
Right?
Um
Maybe it's not working as well,
right? You mentioned that it
would be nice to have a higher
salaries, so that might be an
answer, right? We're gonna
increase salaries.
But
Um, the concern I have is
This is going to be a one for
one.
Offset, you know, I'm gonna be
paying.
in tax
To cover 911 and
And my municipality is just
going to offset that one for one
and spend money on other things
You know
devoted to authorize them to do,
you know, that's how the lens
I'm looking through here. Does
that make sense?
Right, if my rear ranch was
gonna get another.
$25,000 or whatever the amount
is.
Or they just get a
Say
The job 911, you guys got that
money that we're not going to
pay you anymore and we're going
to put that money somewhere
else.
Does that question make sense?
Yes, I believe it does, um, I,
I.
Would
Respectfully disagree.
Um, I think that we have a lot
of posts coming. So currently we
are implementing kind of step
one of the next gen process, but
right now in, in New Mexico.
Uber knows exactly where you
are, and 911 does not, if you
call 911.
So once we connect
And and deploy this as and the
next gen core services. We will
have that information, right?
We'll be able to know exactly
where you are when you call 911.
That's going to make everything
move faster and, and get you a
better response and, and a
smoother.
Um, 911 call with your 911
operator, right? Because we
don't have to have this back and
forth of I don't know where I
am, well I need you to tell me
because I can't see on the, you
know, my technology is not
telling me where you are. So
that part of it, you, your
experience 911 will be smoother,
but that's only step one to the
next gen, um, we also need to
interconnect and, and be
interoperable so that if I take
a call that is moving into the
next county, I am able to send
that call a whole package.
To the next county and they
don't have to waste the time of
exchanging information. OK, now
you have to tell this other
operator where you are. I can
send all that down straight to
that operator. And being able to
do that is going to take the
interoperable CAD, the inner
optums phone systems, all of
those things and
On top of all of that will be
cybersecurity. The last thing we
want is for that to not be
secure.
So I think that
The cost
Will not
He deferred, I think that what
will happen is if locally they
cannot afford the next steps of
NextGen. It's just gonna kind of
be piecemeal throughout the
state as the funds can implement
it in certain areas and the
communities that can support it
will get it, and it, it won't be
a cohesive system throughout our
state so that no matter where
you are in New Mexico, you're
getting
The best 911 service.
Yeah, so
Madam chair and yeah, I, I'll
give you an opportunity to.
Uh, answer the question as well,
but, um,
I think maybe I didn't ask the
question well enough, because
I'm, I don't have any problems
with the technology, you know,
the.
You know, knowing where we are,
I mean, I, I don't have any
problems with any of that. My
concern is right now 80% of this
cost is being covered by local
governments.
local governments see.
Uh, a big increase in the fund
amount.
You know, now it's covering 60%.
They're gonna say, oh, I only
have to pay 40% now, and they're
going to cut in half the money
that they're giving to you.
Which is a net zero.
So my question is, how are you
going to ensure
That
You actually were able to
keep all of the revenue you can
roll forth these technical
changes.
I can speak for my center, the
money that is allocated for me
is allocated for 911. It, it
can't go anywhere else.
So we will just continue to make
sure that we're receiving, you
know, are moving along with the
best,
but interrupt you right there.
So.
This year, it was allocated for
911.
Next year when they put their
budget together and they see
you've got
How many extra thousands of
dollars.
I
San Juan government get a cut.
The money that they put next
year.
That's my question. Yeah, so in
my in San Juan County, they
can't. I'm funded by a GRT that
is
911. But I think in other
communities that has the
potential to happen, um, but
right now I don't think that
they, they have the technology
in the first place.
So I, I.
Yeah,
Yeah, so I think the intent is,
you know,
Uh, DFA with this fund we're
very good at purchasing
equipment.
Maintaining that equipment and
what we've seen is that there's
a potential, you know, when I
look in the horizon and I see
gaps with computer aided
dispatch systems.
Where I walk into a piece.
And they tell me it's broken or
they tell me they don't have a
CAT system.
When I want to insure, um, and
and by putting this
You know, money into the fund
that we can fund this and have
some oversight and maintain this
equipment.
is to ensure that all the
information that comes with the
91 call and now we're able to
move to an IP system where we
can incorporate data into this
system. We need to ensure that
that data and that information
is going all the way to the
first responder.
Not stopping at the 911 center.
Um
And, you know, so I think we we
mentioned computer dispatch as
an important.
Peace of moving that information
along to the first responder,
um.
But we're also looking at, you
know, if we look statewide today
with the build out of our state
radio network.
Investing
Probably over $100 million or
approaching that number, um.
We feel that
The 9/11 fund can make a
difference for our rural
communities.
Helping them get the capital
equipment they need for radio
infrastructure to join that
system.
Um
And it kind of move the needle
in that area as well. So, um,
some of these.
You know, are kind of new costs
that we would like to support.
Within the 911 fund,
And then
Just in my day to day, I receive
requests, um.
Or
New hardware, new software, that
is brand new to the industry.
Um, and I have a hard time.
With the limitations of the
fund.
Um, you know, funding any of
that and so and so the.
That's, that's where we're
starting to see some haves and
have-nots, and I'm sorry for the
length.
No, no, Madam Chair and panel,
thank you for that. Um, you
know, I'm, I'm a research
scientist at Sandia Labs. We
work on cutting a tech
technology, right? I'm, I have
no problems with the technology.
I'm just saying, I'm sure and
I'll just finish with this, is
just be careful what you ask
for.
Because I look at this chart.
And, and I think the
legislature.
Back in the day was pretty
astute and
Spelling out exactly what these
funds could be used for.
As you're talking about software
and hardware.
But a few change it so that you
can now pay for personnel wages.
I can guarantee you that local
governments are going to cut how
much money they're sending to
911 centers.
just be careful.
Be thoughtful
What's what you asked for.
They came out.
Thank you, Representative, um,
next is Senator Hempel.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for the presentation. I just
had a few quick questions. I was
just curious on figure 2, how
are the decisions made about
staffing, why are there some
places where the 911 center is
fully staffed and some are never
fully staffed cause it doesn't
seem to correlate with like
urban areas are not fully
staffed, so who's making those
decisions and what is it based?
Madam Chair and Senator Hempel.
I, um.
I think that every director
across the state is, um, there
are a lot of.
Issues with staffing for 911.
Um
The fact that we're 24/7.
Um, and the shift work involved.
Then of of being a 911 operator.
The stress
Um, on them is high.
Mistakes that they, you know,
that you could make in a normal
job and say, oh, that's just a
human mistake.
They're held to a higher
standard, right? They, they need
to be and always calm.
And so that it takes the job.
So then it, you know, goes into
finding those very special
people, training and um and a
lot goes into that before
they're ever able to.
even take that first call and
it's really hard to know if the
job, if you can last in the job
until you take that first call.
So we, we put a lot into them as
individuals before they, you
know, a lot of training, a lot
of time, a lot of certifications
before we can really know if
they're gonna like the job in
the first place.
Um, and the recruiting become
constantly hiring and constantly
training directors doing that.
Um
Then once you get them trained,
um.
Then it in my jurisdiction, I've
done the math, uh, the average
time that a firefighter, a
police officer or a medic spends
on a call. It's 43 minutes. The
average time one of my operators
spends on the phone is uh be
anywhere from a minute to 3
minutes.
Um, so in the time that an
officer or a firefighter or
medic has dealt with one.
Traumatic incident, my
dispatcher could have handled 3.
And we, um, and every time of,
of police officer or a medic or
firefighters come to it, you
know, they arrive on the scene
at dispatcher already touched
that scene through the phone.
They've already helped to calm
things down. They've already
given instructions. They've
given CPR, they've, you know,
do, done a lot of things to help
make that scene a little more
smoother for them, um, and so
it's, it takes a toll on the
operators. We do have a high
turnover rate because of that
high stress level, I think that
Um
And then we talk about wages. So
a lot of dispatchers, um, a lot
of centers are not able to pay.
You know, you can make as much
Chick fil A as you can make it
911. Chick fil A is probably
significantly less stressful. So
would you say that it's mostly
turnover than some places it's
just harder to find and retain
those people. Is it, is it
challenging to find someone to
do the training. I'm just also
curious about the training, is
it like you get trained
initially or is there ongoing
training? Is there ongoing
debriefing if you do have a
really traumatic call is or
somebody is their mental.
He support, how do we improve
the retention rate of those
individuals so that they do feel
supported, not overly traumatic.
So before, before you, before
you start, can you concise
answers because we're we're
we're ready for them.
Um, so yes, we get initial
training and there's ongoing
training, so there's both, um,
New Mexico is forward in that we
are one of the only states, um,
that have a a state
certification for 911 operators.
So that's, and, and something
that you have to maintain and do
training for. So that's, that's
really great, um.
The, you know, the mental health
support is there?
To a point, um, but our smaller
rural communities and centers
do. And so when you look at that
map and you see that.
There was one center in the
state that was.
how we can better support those
rural areas.
And I'd just like to add that,
you know, a lot of these
emergency emerging technologies
and NexGen 901, we feel that um,
you know, by integrating what is
now, you know, sometimes 89
screens that the dispatcher is
looking at.
consolidating and integrating
the sources of information into
like a single panel or you know
one screen or or limit that so
we, we feel like emergency
emerging technologies will
assist in retaining uh you know,
good dispatchers, um, but, but I
think it's worth noting there's
a national initiative.
reclassified dispatchers as
public safety,
to address this retention issue,
um.
So
Mexico 911 directors affiliate
is also pursuing an initiative
to address reclassification
within our state as well and and
recognize them officially as
public safety.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam
Chair. My other question is what
would the impacts be if the
surcharge is not increased.
I can speak to that directly,
uh, if the surcharge is not
increased, um.
You know, we're looking at
A delayed
replacement cycle for existing
equipment.
Um
Will continue not funding
computer aided dispatch will
continue not funding radio.
And
Will be limited to the extent
that we can assist local
agencies with cybersecurity
initiatives, um, which we feel
is very crucial as we are.
Transitioning to an IP 911
network.
In 2025.
You know, lack of
interoperability
and Madam Chair, I'm just
curious if.
These surcharges have not been
increased since 1989, have there
been requests that were denied.
If so, what were the reasons?
How come it hasn't increased,
Madam, we've we've just.
What we kept adding different.
Different lines, so adding the
boy, adding the prepaid, that
was a little bit of a bump.
Um, I think we've really tried
not increase it and and do what
we could for the fund.
And met him year by year the key
then.
Reintroduces these are all new
costs.
This is to replace something
that is a one for one.
I appreciate Representative
Harper's comments about staff
wages, but we're also talking
about a lot of new costs.
essentially there's just gonna
be a failed 911 system if we
can't get to that. For example,
being able to send video.
Vo to text. Various options that
we can now use with our
smartphones that these legacy
systems just simply cannot
support.
You, you'll have failures and
services you're already having
failures in service.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you for your responses, and last
question is, which state is
doing it the best? Where are,
where's the technology, the
greatest? What are their costs
there, we have that information.
Are we trying to emulate?
Uh
Madam Chair and Senator help
Bill.
Um, so I am a part of the
National Association of State 91
Administrators and I have a
pretty good feel for what the
rest of the nation is doing, uh,
North Carolina has had a recent
success with the devastating
floods that came to the area.
They proved that NextGen 911
works, they rerouted calls to
other uh
you
So, uh,
So they had 90,000 calls that
were rerouted successfully and
answered at neighboring PAs.
So
That is a capability we will
soon have with our next gen 911
system in New Mexico is that
policy routing and emergency
routing. Um, however, I think a
success that you can see in
North Carolina is the
interoperability after that 911
call.
Is is rerouted across the state
and they are still able to
communicate.
You know, back on the ground and
coordinate emergency response.
Um
What you'll see if, if, you
know, I can easily provide an
FCC report that that has great
information um and comparative
charts showing.
Um
The rest of the nation and their
charges and what they're
funding, um.
What we've seen from our
neighbors, uh, you know, a lot
of states have recently
increased their surcharge to
fund the next generation 911
implementation.
So
You know
California, uh,
has led the charge, um.
But I think there's lessons to
be learned, some pros and cons
from from all of our neighboring
states, so, uh, you know, we we
we try and uh
Learn the lessons from all of
them.
Madam Chair. Thank you for your
responses. Thank you, Madam
Chair.
Thank you, Nick is Senator
Rodriguez. Thank you, Madam
Chairman. Uh, good morning,
Julian and Nicole and the
Southern Iceman, the audience.
Thanks to many people here who
provide services for for all of
us, right? And I think, Madam
Chairman, that until something
hits you that you have to use
it, you realize how much, how
important it is and how much
it's needed.
I just have a 2 or 3 questions
and I'll be as short as I can,
Madam Chairman, but I wanted to
see.
If you can explain to me the
difference. I passed a bill 911
enhanced 911 surcharge a few
years ago for the Association of
Counties, and I know that
because we went through so much
discussion on that and I still
have the nice award, Madam
Chairman, it's a nice glass bird
and it says 911 and enhanced
award and on and on, so thank
you for that. But this says that
we have an increased it since
1989. I can't remember if that
enhanced surcharge was, I think,
in
increased some. Maybe it was
just the language that was
changed, but tell me what, what
we did then that is different,
um, on the surcharge specific to
this one. Thank you, madam.
Madam Chair,
Madam Senator.
I believe it's 2017 when the
enhanced 911 act was amended to
include the voip and prepaid
surcharge, um, and, and if you
go back and look at the revenue
estimates from that time, um, we
have not seen those revenues to
the extent that we we expected,
um.
I don't
Yeah, OK.
Thank you. Thank you very much,
and you're absolutely correct.
Thanks for refreshing my memory.
It was to add those couple of
new things to bring it up to the
new technology requirements and
Madam Chairman, another question
is, are these um changes that
you're requesting like the next
generation NG 911 and so on are
all these um federally required
also to comply with some federal
regulations.
trying to help you to see how we
could do this.
Uh, Madam Chair, Madam Senator,
um.
NextGen 911.
Is
The 911 industry keeping pace
with telecommunications and
technology, right? You know, we
need to keep it, we need a 91
system that's gonna work with
Apple and Android devices
specifically. Um,
The FCC is supportive of the
implementation of NextGen 901.
They recently released a report
in order, um.
Mandating, originating service
providers, you know, to include
wireless carriers to.
route their calls to a state
designated point of interconnect
for next generation 91 system.
OK. Thank you, Madam Chair, but
that brings a point of question
here too is that wouldn't they
Wouldn't they require adherence
to the American Disabilities Act
or technology and new
enhancements and so on also,
that's a federal law.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator, uh, that's a very good
question, a very good point. We
are implementing text to 911 as
a part of our next generation 91
system.
And
Um
We believe that
You know, that will
adhere to the ADA community and
increase the services in that
capacity.
Yes, um, and that being said,
um, it'll point out to some
reason I asked that specific on
some potential language you may
want to consider as I was
drafting some few things here
when you were talking. But
before I go there, uh, let me
just mention that it's not only
texting, for example, that we
need for people who have
impairments, but take for
example, deaf people. Deaf
people have to use certain
equipment. My daughter was deaf.
I know I used that equipment a
long time ago, uh, and now
there's
new technology that hasn't even
been updated as much as we
should be, but for example, the
relay service for deaf people,
they can't speak into the phone,
but they can't hear the other
person speaking either.
And so what do you do? Well,
there has to be a technology
format to allow them to
communicate, right? That hasn't
been updated either, Madam
Chairman, for many years.
And so that could be something
to tie into, for example, in, in
a, in a very broad uh term.
But with potential to help you
pass this legislation not only
because we do need it in the
state. We need to enhance our
911 services, but also to comply
with federal regulations and
also um not only for the
American Disabilities Act that
for, uh, which would require
adequate and um
Adequate and updated for lack of
better word, information for
people who need special um
special forms of communication,
deaf and also some people may be
deaf or or may or may may be
hearing but may not be able to
speak, you know, some for
whatever reason.
Um, elderly people who have some
hearing um deficiencies. They
don't have to be deaf, but they
have deficiencies, for example.
So all these things that may
come into play, but, but that,
um, that being said, um, that's
just for your arguments as
you're trying to proceed with
this. So, um, another thing is
that um,
I was looking at this whole
thing and I thought, well, wait
a minute here, it really, it
really is about enhancing um the
911 system that we have overall,
um, it, it says 911 surcharge
increase and yes, it's going to
increase the surcharge, for
example, because we haven't done
it for 35 years.
Since 1989.
And we all know I don't think it
can be argued that the
communication um systems have
changed where they're so
obsolete. In fact, with
computers alone, we from one
year to the next, they become
obsolete and you have to redo
them and so on, but all that
being said, I, I was just
thinking about something here
that may work, may not.
Yeah I'm just throwing things
out as I'm thinking fast here.
But if you do the language, for
example, where
It, it is for
example again, I was just
throwing words out or um
updates.
To the
And handd
9 because they're they're gonna
bring up the fact rightfully so
that this was enhanced in 2017
by adding a voiceover protocol
and and all these things that my
bill did back then, but
Uh, so this is as their updates
to
For information technology and
communication systems.
Um
And
Um, for operational support.
The reason I say those three
things, you can summarize it and
include all these things into 2
or 3 words.
And, and it makes so much sense
that you're merely updating this
to meet federal requirements.
In federal law updated to meet
federal or to, I guess you would
call it meat that update to
federal law, whatever words you
want to use there to comply with
federal law. How's that? With
the ADA and that kind of thing,
but also.
Uh, to provide for operational
support, and that would, you
would be able to use that.
Or if you use the word
operational support, you would
be able to use that for
salaries, for CA, uh, computer
aided technology, for example,
software, you know, hardware,
I'm gonna suggest something else
for that here that may work, but
software would fall under um
operational support, you would
also be able to use that money
for um for all these were the
other highlighted them here, but
I have a pencil and I can't see,
um, yeah, for their, um, well.
Ad System software, salaries,
operation, and also for FTEs,
for example, to those are
full-time equivalent positions
that you may be able to use
cause you need staff too, but
again, you, you probably have
some positions, but you can't
fill them as you said, there may
be some there, I don't know,
but, but I'm just bringing out
some things that would be
covered under operational
support. You can almost do all
your administrative stuff under
operational support, including
the software and that kind of
thing. Now, um,
You, you can use for like the
computer aided and radio systems
that you have here too, it's
called, uh, where did I see it
some radio where I said
somewhere in here. I saw a radio
systems, yeah, but anyway, I
lost it and just maze that I
wrote, but somehow there, but
there's another way to be able
to get some
Um
Equipment, for example, radio
systems, if you need physical
radio systems and, and computers
for your computer aided, uh.
Systems and all these other
things that you would need that
would actually be like
equipment, bricks and mortar
stuff, smaller stuff, and that
could be, you know, the state
you can request funding counties
can request funding um through
the um legislative Finance
Committee and the legislature or
under this thing called specials
in the budget, the statewide
state operations, um.
Budget and that would be under
specials and you can call that
section 5. I'm just giving you
all this at once so you can, we
can talk after this so I don't
take so much time, Madam Chair,
but that's really what you can
do for those if you want more
equipment.
I'm just possibly making some
points here. I agree with
Representative Harper here and I
come from the counties, so you
have a friend here I was county
manager and county commissioner
for 4 terms county commissioner
and department head. So I know
the, the challenges that you
face.
And I, I support what you're
doing very much, but I agree
with what he said, strategy is
the key here.
If you put things in there that
would cause it to be derailed,
you don't get anything, OK, when
in fact, if you put operational
support, for example, you may
want to think of another word
that to us is what we use for
like operations, but, uh,
instead of salary increases.
That would make a big
difference, and I, I can see his
point. So just wanted to to
bring that up and then one other
thing, Madam Chairman, that I
wrote down here is um
Under the the only
Only one public service
answering point, PSAP was fully
staffed. OK. How many PSAPs do
we have in the state?
Um
Madam Chair, Senator, we have 43
total.
43. So there's more, there's 33
counties, so there would be 43,
there will be more than 1 in
some counties, depending on how
big they are, I would think. OK,
thank you.
And so those again haven't been
staffed and you have a good
argument for for all that you're
doing and also the fact that
they haven't been the surcharge
has not been increased for 35
years. You're going from $50 to
$1.50 that's um, but why did I
see a $1.50 dollars here
somewhere for the surcharge, OK,
so that's, that's not extreme,
and then you're complying with
federal law, uh, all of these
needs, oh, and, and also the
change, the rapid change in
technology and communication.
Transfer of that uh of your uh
information is is really key
here too
it's time to stop, so tell me
just to add to that for um.
Consulting implementation of
these systems, training on these
systems.
All under operational costs, I
think is a great suggestion.
Thank you.
Yes, thank you. And that also
can be um if it's only allowing
you to right now the current
surcharge of 51 cents only
allows you to use it for, and I
wrote it down here, um, whereas
that you can only use it for
Um, oh, what is it? Tell me. I
know you use 20% of it, but what
can you use it on right now?
It's only one thing it seems
like.
Tell me, um, what, what can you
use the current funding
fund covers the 911 network.
And the 911 call handling
equipment. OK. So there it is,
so you don't have any, any money
for all these other things we're
talking about, you're
restricted, what you're doing is
you're lifting those
restrictions.
So that you can use it for these
things, but you need additional
funds.
to expand it
And, and for operational support
too. So anyway, Madam Chairman,
I know it's late. I'm gonna
stop.
But if, yeah, I'll be happy to
help if you need to meet with me
or talk to me after this, and if
not, I know you're all bigger
experts than I am, so thank you
Madam Chairman.
Thank you, Senator. I just have
two quick questions, concise
answers, um, our, our state
personnel office just did a look
at different classifications,
different job classifications.
Do you know if you were a part
of that?
Look
Madam chair, possibly uh.
would have to follow up with my
peers at DPS,
because there may be something
applicable to the state.
Telecommunicators under DPS,
however,
The, the
Um
Requirements and and everything
that's
That that really does exist at
the local level for the majority
of our PAs. OK. All right. Um,
but to follow up on that point,
that there was a bill passed in
Congress that
asked the OMB at the federal
level to look at public safety
telecommunicators to move them
into a public safety
occupational classification.
We know if that's happened.
It's, it's a it's, I think it's
passed, Madam Chair, and it's
uh.
Lengthy process so probably take
2 to 3 years to unfold is my
understanding is gathering data
now. OK. OK, good. Um, the other
thing, um, the uh general
Aguilar came for us, the
Department of Homeland Security
and uh I, I, they had they, they
have radio services 322,600.
Under other and they have IT
in-house services, um, but I
didn't see specifically this.
So,
Um
It didn't look like it's in his
budget at all, or at least from
what he showed us. So you fall
under Department of Homeland
Security.
Madam Chair, the the enhanced
911 phone, uh.
falls under the Department of
Finance, local government
division
not under OK.
OK. OK, so it's you guys we have
to look at, OK.
It's like you're
Not really.
Alright, that, that's all the
questions I have. Thank you
again for your presentation.
So you mentioned the federal
requirements and um under the
National 9/11, they actually
fall under the national, um,
highway and traffic Safety
Administration, which is NISTA
and some of their goals is to
improve, um, response times with
9/11. So that's gonna require um
us improving our data at the
local level, so they can reduce
response times giving first
responders the information they
need uh faster, and then the
newchnologies text to 911 video.
Calls and location-based
services, um, so under the 911
program currently, we fund
training, um, that we didn't
mention that, but so training
now without all those new
technologies, um, we were only
able to um provide grant funding
for 433,000.
235 grantees and the actual
request for training was
593,000, so we had a shortfall
of training money, which was
160,000, um, which is currently
paid for, um, the 911 bureau
uses the surcharge to issue the
grants for the training.
So with the new technology, it's
going to be required that
there's more training, another
thing that NISTA emphasizes.
In collaboration with federal,
state, and local agencies to
ensure that we improve.
Uh
911 systems. I'm sorry, uh, just
for clarification, I'm Sabrina
Varela and I'm with the 911
bureau. I'm one of the program
coordinators there. And I was
previously a 911 dispatcher, um,
so I have experience in that.
Um, I also just wanted to point
out that a lot of the concerns,
um, representative Harper had
was, um, maybe they're not the
local governments are going to
stop giving or paying for that,
um, 80%, but a lot of this new,
um, the reason we're asking for
the surcharges because all of
these new technologies are not
being paid for and not available
currently. So, um, with that we
would be able to assist local
governments who are seeking.
those alternatives. Um, I also
want to give you an example.
Um, CA to CA currently that's
not a
A cupboard expense and so these
expenses, again, we'd have to go
to the rule, but
Um,
I recently was coming home late
from a concert and I just wanna
express to you that if I would
have known there was cat to cat,
I wouldn't have done this, and
I'm sure, um, the public
wouldn't know, but I encountered
a wrong way driver on I-25, but
I knew the quickest way to.
Get the information out was to
have.
My sister called 1911 agency and
me call another, and because of
that, because we knew there was
no.
Interoperability. We were able
to get multiple agencies to
respond, and they caught the
driver. Um, but
I die. Without that knowledge,
knowing that.
911 centers don't have the
capability to have
interoperability with each
other, they probably wouldn't
have caught him in.
People could have been hurt.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, Madam
Chairman, thank you for that
information.
Important.
I thank you again. Um, our next
presentation presenters are Los
Alamos National Laboratory
status update.
Keith and
Yeah
Uh
And Angela Miki,
um.
Green got stuck.
Whenever you're ready. Thank
you.
So hopefully you'll have the
slide decks uh in front of you
shortly, but my name's Angela
Milky and I'm the executive
officer for the deputy
directorate for Science,
Technology and engineering, and
with me is Cathy Keith, who is
the director for community
partnerships office. We're going
to give you an update this
morning of uh Los Amos National
Laboratory.
So if you go to that um.
Next slide, um.
Basically, world events such as
the overseas conflicts, um, in
places like Ukraine and the
Middle East that we're seeing
today.
are continuing to bring
attention uh to our national
security mission.
We have capabilities at the
laboratory that are in demand,
uh right now.
And strong bipartisan support
for the work that we currently
are doing.
As well as we're really working
to maintain the momentum that we
currently have that's focused on
technological advancements, uh,
that will actually help um in
these conflicts, um, make the
world safer through R&D.
The
This slide tends to take my
breath away, um, but over the
past 6 years, we have seen
enormous growth uh at the
laboratory.
Um, in 2019.
Uh, we had a budget of 2.9
billion.
This last year we just closed
out our fiscal year for 24, and
we ended the fiscal year at $5.2
billion.
Um, our regular in term
employees have doubled over that
time period, um, and we are
currently, if we include um our
contractors, our subcontract
workforce. We're just under
18,000 employees in Los Alamos.
And our procurements have more
than doubled in that time
period. This last year we closed
out at $2.2 billion worth of
procurements.
slide.
So with this enormous growth
means that um we have a lot of
employees who um are commuting
and coming in and living from
outside of Los Amos County now.
Um, and so we're working to
partner on these regional
issues.
I think one of the the key areas
that I like to highlight is our
new childcare facility, um, and
a UNMLA program um in childcare.
Um, this was a huge uh win um
for our employees and much of it
is in thanks to the early
childhood education and care
department.
Um, for the support for this
facility.
It doesn't solve all of our
childcare problems, but it is um
a help for our employees.
Additionally, we've been working
with um many property
development.
Uh
Folks in the community.
and making progress on housing,
the housing needs that we have
for our employees.
Now with that, that means like I
said, a lot of our employees
live outside of Los Alamos
County.
And so they are commuting um
every day into the county, and
this has, um, we've really
started focusing and had been
for a number of years on the
transportation issues that this
causes.
So just I wanted to highlight a
few areas.
We now have an express bus
service.
Um, we're running 4 trips a day
from Haake from cities of gold,
um, back and forth.
to work, um, the same for San
Felipe. Uh, we have a bussing
system that's going, making 2
trips a day, um, from the Black
Mesa uh casino in San Felipe.
And um the ridership has been
strong on that one and we're
looking to increase, hopefully
this fiscal year.
We stood up a carpool program,
uh, started in March.
Where um if we have 3 employees
who are carpooling, um.
up to the um their work sites.
They get preferred um.
parking status, um, and so
they're able to park closer to
their work sites.
That program um has quickly
grown to 42 carpools, um,
impacting 143 participants.
And then we're partnered with
NMDOT, um, and their vendor
enterprise to on a vanpool
program.
Or if we have 4 employees or
more, um, they get, um.
They're able to rent a new SUV
or minivan, um, and the state is
offering a subsidy, a monthly
subsidy to help reduce those
costs again from the lannel side
we offer um dedicated parking,
uh, for those vans.
We're encouraging our employees
who can, especially those within
Los Amos County to bike when
they're able. And so we've been
adding bike lanes along Pari Tow
Road.
Um, and as each section is
repaved.
We've also, we are also adding
bike lanes in both directions
along Diamond Drive, uh, during
our, uh,
2025 construction project.
Um, we've, uh, stood up. We now
have 15 e-bikes on campus.
That are part of a pilot
program, um, and they're
distributed to different work
sites, um, that help folks move
between sites, um, on site with
the e-bikes and we're adding
bike racks and bike lockers.
All with this, um, we have a
parking enforcement program
that's really focused on, on
making sure that illegal parking
is curbed and uh ensuring that
the available parking is managed
fairly.
Um, and I guess I'd also like to
highlight that um what we
currently or what we had in the
past, our track our taxi
service.
Um, we've shifted uh to more
on-site transit, allowing our
employees to park in less
populated areas, um, and get
bussed over to their work
locations.
as needed.
I'm certain that you've heard
about um the fact that we've had
a lot of construction in the
area of Los Amos County.
And so certainly our New Mexico
foreign truck route intersection
that work was completed in the
spring of 24.
Uh, NSA contributed to the
funding of that project.
We've got a new roundabout under
construction at the intersection
of Diamond and Pajarito. That'll
be completed in 25.
And we've got constructions on
Diamond Drive that's beginning
this year to widen the roadway
to two lanes in both directions
and adding in bike lanes.
Right now we believe that these
programs, especially the bus,
the carpool, the van pull.
are saving um about 210 spaces,
so that means about 210 cars
that aren't on the roads each
day.
Next
And then we have a lot of
science highlights that we
could, um, talk about and so
days, but I wanted to highlight
just um a few of those areas.
Um, so we now have a new
supercomputer, Vannao, uh,
that's been delivered and is
operational.
This is enabling us to um do
more AI work with more AI
applications.
Um
At the same point in time, we've
also created a new AI office.
That's coordinating our approach
across the lab to using AI and
the different resources that we
have.
Lance often um is in the news,
but we've ramped up our
production of isotopes, in
particular, here I'm
highlighting actinium 225, which
can be used in cancer treatment?
But our lance isotope program at
the laboratory is part of the
DOE's isotope program.
That produces and distributes
stable and radioisotope uh
radioactive isotopes.
For research and applications.
This is particularly important
as the international supply um
is is greatly impacted, um, and
so we're really working across
uh the nation to increase.
Um, are isotopes.
And then finally, um.
Um, a very big deal for us, Los
Alamos this year, won 8 R&D 100
awards.
Um, those are considered the
Oscars for innovation, and one
in particular that I'll
highlight, um, actually uses AI
to accurately simulate
performance of manufactured
parts to make them stronger.
Um, and better performing, and
so this goes along with our
advanced manufacturing
capabilities that we're working
on.
I'm gonna shift gears and Kathy
is now gonna take over, um, and
then we'll, we'll rest for
questions.
Thank you, Angela. um, Madam
Chair, members of the committee,
um, just some quick updates on
the laboratory and um as a
corporate citizen in New Mexico.
So, um, you heard that our
employment is up, um, the big
takeaway from that is $1.8
billion in salaries that flow
into our local economies in New
Mexico every year, um, you heard
about our small business and our
procurement being up, so, um,
the important thing there to
note is that um 606 million went
out to New Mexico small
businesses, um, we again strive
every year to um increase those
numbers and encouraged uh
Or at the lab to purchase
locally.
Um, our tax contribution last
year 155 million paid in GRT.
And we just had an economic
impact study completed by UNM
and NMSU collaboratively that
found that our overall impact on
the FY on the economy in FY 22
was 3.7 billion.
Next slide, um, a little uh
thanks to you, um, and the
investments that you have made
in technology transfer programs,
um, between, uh, the laboratory
with a stated assistance.
So NMSBA is probably one that
you may be familiar with and
have heard about before, um, the
New Mexico Leap program.
Um, and trigger
So these 3 programs support
entrepreneurs in the state of
New Mexico.
I just want to highlight here
quickly we've talked a little
bit about, um, advanced
manufacturing today, and really
the connections between what the
laboratory, Los Alamos is doing
as a research and development
organization, along with
research and development
institutions in the state of New
Mexico.
So advanced manufacturing is
included in the New Mexico
Economic Development
Department's primary, um,
priority industries moving
forward, um, we are clearly
investing in those businesses or
in those technologies at the
laboratory and spinning them
out. We've highlighted on this
slide, uh, a company that has
come through the LEAP program.
So these are entrepreneurs who
are from Berkeley. The Leap
program brings 3 entrepreneurs
in a year to the laboratory.
They spend 2 years
with and a fellowship with us,
understanding technologies and
getting to know them better and
then start their own spin out
businesses, so these two
gentlemen, um, spent 2 years at
the laboratory, are now in
Albuquerque, where they have
opened their business, which is
around space and advanced
manufacturing technologies. They
employ 7 people. This is their
first year in business. We hope
to see them expand, but clearly
we'll need a workforce for these
kinds of businesses moving
forward.
So a nice partnership that I
wanted to highlight between you
and him, New Mexico State, and
New Mexico Tech.
Um
Grant moneys flowing in from the
National Science Foundation
through New Mexico Escore to
those institutions in Navajo
Tech, where we will start
training.
An advanced manufacturing
workforce statewide Los Alamos
serves on that advisory
committee, and we all hope to
see these industries grow in New
Mexico.
And our takeaway, I, I think I'd
like to leave you with is that's
only gonna happen if we work
collaboratively. We see many of
those, um, collaborative
relationships happening in R&D,
um, because it takes more than
one R&D partner to strengthen
that network. We're going to
have to have a workforce that
supports these new and emerging
businesses in the state as well.
So with that just a few minutes
on education, I know we have
some members of the committee
who um have joint appointments
in education and members, many
members of the committee who
care deeply about education. We
do too at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, it should be no
surprise to you that we put an
emphasis on STEM education, a
little selfishly because we want
to see a future workforce in New
Mexico who we can hire. We also
want to see a future workforce
for the state of New Mexico, who
we know will be higher paid, um,
and to support.
startup businesses in the state
and other STEM employers.
So we make investments in K
through 12 education, um, we
launched 2 years ago, uh, some
traveling trailers that travel
around the state with our
employees, um, they target is
really junior high age
population students, so a lot of
school visits, talking with
students, our professionals
about what a STEM career looks
like, how they got into a STEM
career, um, and encouraging
them, um, to also pursue STEM
careers.
In the area of higher education,
we've made numerous investments
in regional colleges in northern
New Mexico, supporting, uh,
specialized pipeline programs to
train people for all these jobs
that we've added at Los Alamos.
So we're thrilled to let you
know that over 60% of our new
hires in the last two years have
been from New Mexico, um, and
from our institutions here.
We've recently partnered with
Northern New Mexico College in
Espanola to create a new um
center for excellence and
Information Technology and
cybersecurity.
You know, we know that over
750,000 jobs will be added to
the cybersecurity bill over the
next 10 years is the projection,
and we want to make sure that
local students in New Mexico
have the opportunity to join
that workforce.
Um, lastly, we'll just touch on,
um, for a quick minute, uh, our
employees at the laboratory and
brag on them a little bit in
terms of their community
involvement throughout the
state, so they are our greatest
asset 16,000 people, 18,000 with
our contractors, right, who can
give their time, talent and
resources to communities, and
they do. So last year they
opened their wallets and gave
over $2.6 million as individuals
to nonprofit organizations in
the state, um, and Triad who
separates the laboratory, match
those fundings with about $3.1
million
to nonprofit organizations in
New Mexico.
So with that, um, we will turn
it over for questions.
From the committee
think you representative Harper,
we'll start with you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you for, for being here.
Um.
I very much appreciate the kind
of high level overview of what
our labs are doing and I'm
excited to hear from
Uh
Director Gibson here later, um.
Uh
I want to first just say thank
you for the great work that the
labs do. I
As I sit here and I look at this
interesting slide that you slide
3 that shows the incredible
growth.
that speaks to something.
And, and really what it, in my
mind, what it's speaking to is
we have
Major concerns and challenges
that are facing our nation. When
I see your presentation, it's
very
I love that it's focused on what
is the impact in New Mexico, how
are we helping New Mexico
communities, how are we hiring
in Mexico graduates, are we
helping to fund New Mexico
government.
But in reality, the benefit of
Los Alamos is to our nation.
Um
Uh
And, and I wish I could share.
Even just
A handful of the things that I
know, um, but when you look at
what's going on in the Middle
East, Ukraine.
Taiwan
Um, there are a lot of very
smart people here in Mexico who
are working on things that go
across the president's desk
every day.
Um, and it's super important
that
We understand that it's not just
what are you doing for New
Mexico?
But that we are also supportive.
I mean, I have this uh YouTube
series that I just love to watch
during my lunch. I've got like a
little 12-minute lunch break at
my desk and it's World War 2
week by week. It's just a 12
minute segment, what happened in
World War II this week.
And they've got clips and maps
and it's, it's fascinating.
But uh
You know, it was only
100 years ago.
Even 100 years ago that we had 3
nations decided that they
wanted.
To uh take advantage of other
nations.
And I'll tell you it's not by
accident or happenstance.
We have not had a world war in
the last 89.
Because of
The work of allies and the work
of many.
People to sacrifice my people in
our nation, but it's also
directly related to the work
that's done at Los Alamos and.
I want to say
Thank you.
And um
Very grateful for the good work
that's being done.
representative. Any other
questions?
I can finish up if you don't.
OK.
I heard a lot of things last
week, so, um, but I did want to
tell you we're gonna have a a
day honoring on the labs and and
and and and uh White Sands, the
army labs on February 3rd.
That's when we're set for it. So
it might be, you know I've
already talked to your person
back there and, um, so I might
need to talk to you on getting
information, but we definitely
wanna
Recognize what you guys are
doing and how important you are
to our state, OK?
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair, little.
Thank you very much. Um,
Uh, this has been a wonderful
presentation about all of the uh
with the updates. And, um, I'm
not certain that this has been
addressed already, perhaps in
another committee.
Um, uh, but I'm wondering if you
might.
be prepared to share an update
on the concerns the
environmental concerns that were
raised by table Women United
that's come to light here
recently and if uh
This, this
That's my question, Madam Chair.
Thank you very much.
Madam Chair, Representative
Little, thank you. So there were
some reports that were released
late last week by Taited around
um
Environmental issues and um
specifically the release of
tridium, proposed release of
tritium, um, by Los Alamos and a
venting process. So we have not
had a chance to review those
reports yet. We would very much
look forward to getting them to
having a chance to understand
better what data is presented
there so that we can respond to
them. Happy to do that. Um, we
all share an environment
together in New Mexico. We're
very cognizant of that at the
laboratory, um, and do our
our very best to make decisions
that are um in the best interest
of everyone.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. I look
forward to that.
Thank you, Representative
Little. Thank you for the
presentation. I think it's
particularly exciting to hear
about your childcare facility
since um that's my area too and
my, my passion, just curious how
many slots are available in your
childcare facility and how long
has it been up and running and
is it only for employees at your
facility.
Madam Chair, um, vice chair and
fell, so the center is up and
operational. There are 150 seats
as licensed by the state of New
Mexico Early Childhood Education
department. Um,
We,
the center opened in January
and, uh, has had a phased
opening first with infants
because that's where we've had
the greatest demand among our
employees who are clamoring for
childcare for infants, and now
they are to the stage of
bringing on 3 and 4 year olds
and then up to 5 year olds as
well.
So, um, the
The
Organization of the childcare
center, as I will describe it,
is the University of California,
who's one of the operators of
Los Alamos National Laboratory
made a $2 million investment in
rehabbing a former shopping
center, um, into a childcare
facility. Um,
The childcare facility, however,
is a privately owned um woman
owned um minority owned small
businesses, um, been in business
in northern New Mexico for over
20 years. Um, so that's a
partnership that we have and for
the investment that we made in
rehabbing the facility, um, Los
Alamos employees are given
priority.
But it doesn't mean that
everyone there is a lesslamos
employee. What it means is if
there's 2 people on the waiting
list, someone who's a Los Alamos
employee gets first priority for
that seat right now, um, I, I
think I've heard from them that
over 90% of the students who are
attending are Los Alamos
National Laboratory employees,
but we, we expect that that may
change over time, um, and hope
that it will, right, as we have
in flow as students come in and
out of the program.
Excellent. I think it's so
important that we have
opportunities for moms or
infants. I know that was so
hard. I have 4 kids and trying
to manage an infant and getting
to work on time and I don't know
why more places don't offer that
because it.
Definitely encourages more, more
women to be able to continue
their careers and bring those
brilliant minds too, um.
Certainly are representative
Harper mentioned. I'm also, I
just wanna congratulate you on
your 8 awards, the R&D awards, I
think it's really interesting
that the word that you mentioned
was an AI stimulation because in
education, AI is still seen as
this dark thing, this like evil
entity that we need to encourage
children not to utilize students
to stay away from AI and so
I think that it's brilliant that
we're beginning to see it as a
useful tool that can um open up
more opportunities and
information that otherwise we
wouldn't have had access to. I'm
just curious what some of you
don't have to go through all 8,
but I'm just curious what some
of the other awards were for.
Certainly so, Madam Chair, vice
chair, um, I actually have um a
little blurb for each one, but
we had, uh, one for a compact
space plasma analyzer, which is
a small sensor, um, that's
monitoring space weather um for
space asset protection, um,
space is now a, a big key area
for our defense as well as um,
exactly.
Um, the next one was an ion pair
membrane electrode assembly, um,
and basically they're robust
fuel cells that provide superior
performance and clean energy,
um.
The next one was called men's
modular electrochemical nuclear
decanttamination system.
And it's technology that removes
radioactive surface
contamination, um, and reduces
waste.
Um, the next one is a
non-destructive alpha
spectrometer.
And this is the first field
deployable instrument for a
point and shoot in situ
measurement of actinides in
material.
Um, you can see themes all
around what Las Amos does. Um,
the next one's called Phoenix.
It's a portable high efficiency.
Ortho voltage energy imaging
X-ray. We also spend some time
with our acronyms, um, this is
the first portable X-ray source
to optimize imaging of thin and
thick objects simultaneously.
Um, the next one is uh radiation
aerosol dispersion and
inhalation model, um, and it's
an application running on a
laptop, it calculates radiation
dose to support emergency
responders.
Um, and then finally, um, safe,
which is a secure automatic
fail-safe eraser, which is an
information barrier technology
that protects data from theft
and accidental dissemination.
Um, and so those were the, the
ones that we had, um, gotten
this year. I would like to to
just add one comment on AI. I
think that you're exactly right,
um, we need to take some of the
fear out of using AI, um,
because at the minimum it will
be a tool for us, no different
than a scientific calculator
that I remember unfortunately
when I was in college were
banned from being used,
um, you always have access to
calculate.
It's not always gonna be at your
fingertips. Exactly, and now
they are a requirement in many
of our students, uh, classrooms,
those scientific calculators,
and I think that's, you know,
minimally where AI will be.
So, thank you. Thank you so much
for the presentation yearning
for lunch?
OK, so we'll come back at one or
Oh, lunch.
Thank you
Yeah
Oh we're waiting for lunch to
come up. I noticed you talked
about uh acronyms. What is NNSA
done.
One of your slides with
Lannel in northern New Mexico.
Mm
OK. Thank you.
