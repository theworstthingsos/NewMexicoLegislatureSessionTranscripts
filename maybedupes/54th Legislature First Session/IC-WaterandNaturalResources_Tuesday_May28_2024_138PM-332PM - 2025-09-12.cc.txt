good time saw some strange
things in the sky, and some of
us took a road A float trip down
the Rio Grande. I mean, the Rio
Chama, so we're all about water.
Uh, thinner. Phoenix. Thank you,

Um, staff.
Uh, Sarah. We admire lead staff
for water committee. We have Tom
Kuska. Uh, drafter, um
Eventually over here, and, uh,
Michelle is our current law
intern.
So a couple of, uh quick
announcements before we go to
the work plan, first off.
The microphones are really
sensitive. Remember that,
especially to like noise and
paper shuffling and any objects
on the desk?
Uh, we had some really bad
feedback. Uh, during the session
last year, so just be aware of
that.
Um, Apparently, someone found
the phone.
In the bathroom, the famous
missing there, OK, we're good.
Uh and and this meeting does
include public comment. Um, so
we have it scheduled at 415 if
we get there sooner, we'll do it
sooner, but we'll have public
comment both in person and on
zoom, uh on zoom, uh or neither
event.
The public will be given two or
three minutes. Uh, sort of
depending on what level of
interest. We have, uh, to make
public comments to the
committee.
Um
Uh, any procedural questions,
comments announcements before we
proceed to the work plan.
OK, so on the work plan.
Let's first talk about the
meeting schedule.
Um
So last year under the
leadership of Chairwoman
Stefani.
Um
I would say she worked our tails
off.
Uh, we extended the meeting
dates. Uh, we in the past had
been a day and a half when we
went to 2.5 days, and I think
she covered if not everything on
the work plan is pretty darn
close to everything on the work
plan.
Um, I have been intending to do
things a little differently.
Uh, partly because I know we're
all part time volunteer
legislators and I know we all
have
Uh, campaigns to attend to, And
so it was my intention to to
dial it back a little from 2.5
days to a day and a half, which
we had done in the past. Um
That being said, Uh
Because I asked for a day and a
half it said 2.5 days we got an
extra meeting date.
Which I didn't realize till I
started the list on the back of
the, uh, first work plan.
Um
So, uh, thoughts comments about
that? That caught me kind by
surprise.
I'm not sure which one was added
It might be, uh so I shouldn't
speculate. I don't know. I I'm
guessing I. I don't have one of
these on my calendar, but it
would take me a while to figure
out which one I'm missing.
The October is the new one, OK?
OK, so we we have 1/4 interim
meeting scheduled, Uh, it's been
my plan to break it out as I had
done before Doing one session on
water, one session on energy and
one session on sort of other
conservation topics. Uh, with
1/4 meeting.
The the symmetry of that kind of
falls apart, but that's OK.
Um, any, uh, reservations or
thoughts? Center City.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I think
it's a good idea. Maybe we could
do one on air.
I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.
Um, I think it's a good idea to
have an extra day and maybe we
could do one of the the extra
day on air air quality. OK, so
it's not an extra day. It's it's
really an extra interim meeting.
It's a day and a half. Well, if
you have the sort of the theme I
think we could add air as a
theme. Um, they American Lung
Association has really had a
problem with our air quality. I
think our last grade was AD
minus, um, in our air quality,
and we might want to look at
that, OK?
Thank you, Senator Stewart.
Well, you could add climate.
As one topic.
Uh, related to my office is
doing a lot of research on that
now, and, uh, we are happy to
provide other research that we
have done to the staff here.
So that you could have a
presentation on
Where we've been where we're now
where we ought to. Maybe go with
climate.
OK, and I think climate, um
would pair well with air issues.
OK?
Sir Luhan.
Uh, represent,
um, There is a Senator Leon,
but,
um, Mr Chair. I appreciate the
time I. I would concur with
those, um those topics and add
to them and say that let's let's
get some. Really, um, movement
on where we are with. Uh, the
ETA and how we are moving,
planning and strategizing the
next decade and and two decades
of how we are going to, uh, make
the mark
Of those those, uh, climate
goals that we have. I think that
it is essential. And I'd also
like to to encourage that we
have the
The new committee that the
governor has on the climate
climate committee that they that
we've, um
Um, funded through the state. We
need to have some updates. We
need to know where who's on that
board that's being created. We
need to know where they are. And
I also like to say we should
have some information and
hearings from the PRC and the
regulation as we are. We're
moving towards those goals and
seeing more. How we are meeting
those goals or those challenges.
Um
With the ETA and grid
modernization. It's all it's all
together if we're gonna if we're
gonna have a topic of climate
change, I think we have all the
above. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you. And, um Sarah tells
me she's writing all this down.
Uh, so so a lot of these, uh, I
think they're good ideas and,
uh, even if they're not a stand
alone and a meeting, uh, they
could certainly be topics for
the work plan as well.
Um, center Woods.
He's not gonna do it.
When should we have a topic?
Of how these laws are being
enacted. They are being
followed.
Who is administering who is
enforcing
Who is, uh, are we actually
making good law?
That is enforceable.
Did you, Senator Woods that you
have, Uh,
In particular where you think
about I do. I do have those. Uh
how about the Community Solar
Act?
Why? Why? You know we we passed
this law.
And now
Has has any of that been enacted
yet has has. Is there any
community solar on the ground
anywhere and and you know, we've
talked many times about, uh,
solar gardens, which is the next
step up.
Um
Where we at on that.
Um
We We We talked about produced
water.
Uh, there's laws out there that
govern produced water.
So you know the governor wanted
to to
Have a whole initiative about
using, uh, some of this produced
water.
Do we need to think about
changing the law and produced
water and and look at the latest
technology out there that maybe
we could recover at least half
of that volume.
To be used some way.
Um
Just look at laws that govern
Water.
That govern energy and see
If they are actually working.
If people are are are they
enforceable? Talk to the
agencies and see if if there are
enforceable
We've talked many times about
the the Water Data Act.
There's a whole law out there.
Now the agencies
Are not playing well together,
Mr Chair.
They do not get their their
information together as to what
that law says.
Uh, why is that can we can we
Incentivize them.
To to come together.
What would it take to make the
laws work? Why pass laws if they
can never work?
It's just pretty simple. Thank
you, Mr Chair. So thank you,
Senator Woods, I you know, I. I
think you brought up several
potential topics. I. I probably
wouldn't expect a topic on laws
in general, but updates on some
of those specific laws that have
had a lot of legislative
attention. ETA Solar, um,
Community Solar Water Data act.
I mean, I think those are all
fair game and so maybe we just
sort of look at enforceability
one at a time rather than as a
concept of enforceability.
Uh, Senators, Spanic.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I see that
hydrogen is already on our list
on Page three. But I, uh, would
like to see Make sure that we
discuss the legislative role in
hydrogen and at the top of Page
four.
Talking about PF, Um
We
Have received some major federal
funding, but it's not going to
help the little people. It's not
really gonna help. Um
Homeowners that are on Wells.
When they are affected unless
State is bringing some major
federal action so I'd like to
see if we can investigate that a
little bit.
Further. Thank you.
OK, uh, represents more.
Thank you, Mr Chair members of
the committee so
Uh, quite a few. A few sessions
back being Senator Woods.
Pass a bill.
To supply weather stations in
the state of New Mexico.
In doing so.
Uh, that project is, uh, right
at 50 or a little over 50%
complete in the state.
Uh, we have since had
I believe four other states,
according to the state
climatologist following our
lead.
In that, uh, process.
Uh,
I would. I would like to see
this committee
Uh, have the state climatologist
do a presentation.
Catch us up on where he's at.
And
We have, uh, some challenges.
That, uh, we're coming up
against in implementing the
program.
Uh, I'd like the Legislature to
know what those challenges are.
And
And maybe how we can all help to
secure this program for in the
future. The state of New Mexico.
And the right, uh, reliability
of it to support the community.
And, uh, if we could put the
But our state climatologist
And in our schedule somewhere
where we could, and maybe we can
even, uh
Set it up with him where we
could tour. Some of the weather
stations and stuff would be, I
think would be a great idea.
Mr Chair.
OK, thank you for that. So so we
sort of morphed like into the
work plan. Um, I, I take it the
consensus is we're gonna keep
all four of the interim dates a
day and a half meetings. Uh,
we'll figure out uh, if there
there will be themes for each
one. I suspect there will and,
um, let's let's talk briefly
about. Uh um, a couple other
things related to that one is in
November. Uh, we have two days
in Santa Fe and my hope in Santa
Fe.
Is that we
Spend some time going over
proposed legislation.
Um, I have. I personally have
mixed feelings about the
Uh, usefulness of a committee
endorsement. Uh, so I'm not
really sure What T. I'm gonna go
on, uh, there
But in terms of
Sort of like a trial run on
legislation that will be coming
forward during the session and
hearing from a bipartisan
bicameral, Uh, committee on pros
and cons of legislation. I think
that could be really useful if
we have, uh, legislation. I was
tapping my fingers. I picked it
picked it up if we have
legislation ready
So that's
Um, you know, sometimes
Uh, we get major.
Environmental legislation a week
or two into the session, and
it's moving target. And so I'm
I'm hopeful that we can, uh,
legislation that we know is
coming. We can have a robust
discussion of that in November.
Um, something else I would I
would like to do is, uh I'm I'm
inclined to cover fewer topics.
And give more time to each topic
because I'd rather sort of dig
in deeper and I also
To the extent that there are
different, differing points of
view on an issue. I would like
to have panels that represent
those different points of view.
So we can have that discussion
not only with us and the
Panelists, but also within the
panel. Uh and you know, really
sort of get to the heart of the
matter.
Um
I did do this once, Um
Some years back. We were up in
Chama, and I thought, I, I
thought it'd be a good idea to
do a, um free roaming horse
panel and I got a bunch of
different viewpoints on that
panel, and they like wouldn't
even talk to each other. It was,
um
It was not good. Uh, but let's
will work on that.
Um, uh, Another thing is, it's
gonna be my inclination to do
Uh, presentations that call for
or warrant, legislative action
or legislative funding.
Uh, so, like simply, uh, like a
community group that that wants
to talk to us about the good
work they're doing, Uh, I
appreciate that good work.
Uh, but since we're coming up on
60 Day session where everything
is germane. I really want to
focus on things that are gonna
get tackled.
Uh, during the session.
So those are, um just
But I've had about how they
approach the interim.
Um, before we go back to work,
Plan and I, I really want
everyone with work plan
suggestions to make them and
make sure we have
You or or or listed as
comprehensive as possible, and
then we can pick and choose from
that list. Um
Locations.
Uh, we have a short list on the
back page.
Um
I know one I had conversations
with, um
Representative Ortez. She
suggested Red River might be a
possibility. Any other, uh,
cities or locations? Uh, that
people would like to have us
have on the list. Uh, represent
lo. I would I would say, rather
than Red River if we went to
questa
Um and talk and look at what's
being developed. And I mean,
similar area. Um, but, um,
looking at what Chevron is doing
up there with the water plant
that they have in the economic
advantages and
And and things going on up
there. I think that that is an
important place for us to, um
really. Look at Mr Chair. Thank
you.
Um, we, Ortiz
Uh, it question doesn't have the
meeting space but that, but it's
in Red River, and it's just a
few minutes away, So I think
that makes a lot of sense to
have that's that's the biggest
thing happening environmentally
in northern New Mexico in that
part of northern New Mexico
Is the mine. So and then a good
example of, um
You know something that could be
a field trip. You know that kind
of thing? Um
So we will look at field trips.
Um, we did schedule last year or
the year before we had picked
Los Luceros as the location and
they couldn't accommodate us.
The the committee was too big
and we ended up at Northern New
Mexico College instead. Uh, so
there is that there is that and
this is historically a big
committee. Uh, so we need a
facility big enough to
accommodate us all if we show
up and, um, lodging in the town
as well, Yeah, I think that we
that area you could
Accommodate between those those
communities and I've actually
talked to the community there
And maybe the the public school
would open up. Uh, for us as
well for a site. Uh,
Also visit to have our meetings
chair. Thank you.
OK?
Um, represent Kate.
Thank you Chair. A suggestion
would be, um, to have a we could
meet at the rear Rancho Public
School Training Center, which is
as vast technology and large
rooms as well. The corals,
siphon and, um the issues that
are happening with urban
agriculture, whether it be in
corals or further down in Los
Ranchos. I think there is a
variety of issues that could be,
um, brought to the attention of
the river management.
OK?
Thank you.
Uh, 11 field trip that I, uh,
had envisioned because I've
never seen it is the low flow
conveyance channel.
Um
Which the same engineer's office
wants to.
Uh, reactivate, um
So I think that would be
interesting. There is also a
request that we hold our August
meeting.
Uh, at
New Mexico Tech.
Because apparently the Health
and Human Services Committee is
that right, so the Health and
Human Services Committee is
meeting those same days and we
have significant overlap.
Between the two committees.
Yeah, So the idea is that
members could be a tech and it
could move back and forth to
hear different presentations.
And I, you know, that seems
reasonable to me.
Um
I like this OK? Any further
comments on
Days of the meeting, or, um,
Locations of the meetings.
Um Riverside, Armstrong.
Uh, thank you, Mr Chairman. I
would love to see you all at New
Mexico Tech, and we could also
do a field trip to, um There's
the, uh, sanctuary, the Bird
Sanctuary area around there.
Also, hobs has been pushing
really hard. They have a
beautiful facility down there
that could accommodate a large
group and another field trip
could possibly be, you know,
seeing some of the the water
situations with the oil and gas,
uh, in that area.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
The same
OK, Let's let's get back to, uh
um Any other work plan topics
people would suggest center
steinborn.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Of course,
I'll put on a plug for Las
Cruces, 10 year anniversary of
the Organ Mountain Desert Peaks
National Monument.
Nothing says natural resources
like that.
So, um, OK, So you know, I. I
heard your idea, Mr Chair on
focusing on issue areas. I think
there's a lot of issues that
don't necessarily fall in one of
those, or they might kind of
tangentially that I think are
really important legislative
issues because they neglected. I
think we need to pay more
attention to them.
And I'll just mention a few of
those. Of course, we know
wildlife issues, but, um solid
waste issues.
Plastics.
Which our state hasn't taken any
action on plastics. More and
more states are, um and there's
different things we can look at
there.
Um, contamination in general
looking at a whole host of
contamination cleanup issues in
the state that are perfect for
use of one time money, including
the 300 abandoned and neglected
contaminated sites all across
New Mexico, a banning uranium
mine sites.
Um
I could go on and on, so those
are just a few and is there if
you got those, but, um, that I
would love to see us go into and
see us take legislative action.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Represent Lujan.
Thank you. Mr Chair on topic
matters, um, back to the site if
we do go to Red River, uh,
questa area, uh, we could bring
up the topic of hydrogen as it's
mentioned multiple times here,
but green hydrogen specifically
and getting into the
conversation and bringing in our
electric co op, Uh, tower in
towers as well into the
conversation, I think narrowing
The conversation around what is
going on and what we are.
Expecting even from the
executive office on hydrogen and
and policies is pretty crucial
right now, seeing how we have,
um
We know that the the governor
spent this this, uh last month
going to the world.
Uh, Summit for hydrogen, and we
need to have some more
explanation and some more
involvement in that
conversation as we've seen in
previous, uh, legislation. I'd
like to know what is going on.
Um, and dealing with um Yeah.
How we are, how we are looking
for water clean up and as
mentioned before with with
representative Ortez in what's
going on in in Questa, I think
those are important topics right
now. Thank you.
Represent Kates.
Uh, thank you chair, um, just to
add it for another topic as
well. It's in my location is we
have a great example. And, uh of
several things. One is storm
water and groundwater
management. Uh, the Harvey
Jones. Uh, channel is a small,
um, example of as a
representatives of more. I was
talking about having multiple
stakeholders trying to work
together is very difficult. They
have about nine different
stakeholders between
municipalities. The flood
As well as some environmental
groups that are doing a storm
water and groundwater
management. Um, a project that
has been very successful. Um,
and so I would add that to the
topic of that area. Thank you.
Oh, wait, Uh, Representative for
C. Thank you, mr Chair. And so I
went to a, um
Presentation. I forget now when
it was and it was, uh, centered
around, tribal, Um
Energy climate issues. It's been
driven by, uh each tribe is part
of this. It was a tribal energy
summit some something around
that where all the tribes
described their efforts.
And how they were, um,
unfolding.
The, uh in addressing
All of the issues that we just
talked have been raised Water.
Uh, clean energy. All of those
topics and I think it would
really be helpful to us because
our tribes have such a major
presence in the state and
because I learned in that one
presentation from the smallest
and the largest tribes that each
and every one of them Mr Chair
are advancing.
Um, at a very good pace, and
they're getting a lot of support
from the federal government. And
of course, they're using a lot
of what we've been able to what
they've been able to tap into
with state monies, and I think
it would be worthwhile to have
just a panel.
On
Hearing from our tribal
communities how they are
advancing in these areas because
they also can assist us in terms
of the water. How there are
treating how they're working
with preservation conservation
on around water, and I just
think it would be very useful.
Uh so I would propose just that.
Um, I think they need to lead us
in many ways, uh, rather than
us, leading them because they
Have some very sacred and
spiritual ways in which they've
interjected those into their
economic and development and
development projects elsewhere.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Senator Woods.
One last topic, Mr Chair.
While I wildfire mitigation.
We're talking about.
Another.
Dry summer.
Maybe the topic needs to be as
to you know, they said that big
wildfire over in Texas was
started by a downed electric
So what? What would it take?
To
Not only safeguard some of those
Down poll situations but also
safeguard the utility companies.
To say, Well, we've did this.
This and this.
So then.
We should be able to lower our
liability on one of those.
Big wildfires.
So
What work could we do on
wildfire mitigation?
To cut down the wildfires.
Out there.
Many of the wildfires started in
my part of the world is from a
chain dragging or something on a
highway. Many highway fires
You know? Who do you blame on
that?
Someone caused it, But you can't
ever catch em. But if if
Signs were posted. You know
different things. It might help
but wildfire
Mitigation.
Represent ferry.
No.
Represent her.
Uh, thank you, Mr Charon to add
on to Senator Wood's comments.
Uh, again, the the, um, aging
infrastructure in rural water
systems is is just a huge a huge
part of wildfire suppression If
you don't have six inch pipes,
uh, you don't have enough water
pressure to even hook up to a
fire engine. So so in the north,
you know we have
Uh, I have 41 mutual domestic
water associations, many of them
very small associations less
than 100 people. And, um, we've
done a lot. I mean, I've trained
everybody on the water trust
board and we we got in a lot of
applications We got in 30
million this year out of the out
of the 150 million that we
handed out just in district 41.
But that was by having town hall
meetings explaining to people
how to do this, But really, it's
an issue statewide for rural
districts.
They They don't that that
infrastructure was all built
after World War two and it is 75
years old. It is aging if and it
takes millions of dollars to
repair And to re, um, you know,
redo these. Uh um, projects and,
uh, we're not gonna capital
outlay our way out of this. It's
It's really gonna take some
strong investment.
Uh by the state in rural
communities, and, um and and and
having a real a real solid plan
to step forward. We did that for
Las colons. We did that for
tribal infrastructure. We have
separate funds on that, Uh, I
did introduce legislation that
died dead on arrival a couple of
years ago on on another fund to
do rural infrastructure, But I
think I think we should look at
that, and it's really is not
only about clean drinking water,
but it's It's also about
Suppression.
It was a furry
Thank you, Mr Chair. I'd just
like to, um, support going to
Las Cruces. Um, Senator
Steinborn mentioned. Um we
could um uh, talk about the, um,
pollution of the aquifer from
the, um, test facility That's
close by and then also go and do
a hike in the Oregon Mountains.
That's close to there. So, um,
But even though there isn't a
main PF, uh, contamination there
are P I think is in
The aquifer. Um, pollution that
they're trying to fight and
other chemicals too.
OK, we'll We'll definitely put
it on the list. Uh, we were in
Las Cruces last year, so we
might move. It was it just last
year it was last year.
We can go again,
Sarana.
I'm just real quick. I think
this has been covered. But, um
for gas and oil. I want to know
how much water they're using
fresh water they're using and
then how much produced water
They're producing. Need to see
that somewhere because I, um we
were on a water excursion and
and I asked that question. Where
Who? How much do they using?
Where is it At? Where can you
show us and they couldn't give
me an answer The water on that.
OK and and produced water is one
of those topics that's both
You know it's both waters and
energy so it doesn't fit neatly
in one or the other.
Um
Tender Cervantes, did you give
your hand up?
First of all.
Um, commend you for your
His policies for the committee.
I mean, I've been trying to do
that. I shared this for quite
some time and then shared
others, and I think a smaller
number of topics and a deeper
dive makes more sense. The other
thing I would suggest to the
committee is leaving time for
dialogue amongst ourselves. We
we have these meetings where the
pa, the agenda is so packed that
we get. We gain a lot by just
listening to one another talk
and leaving for his free time is
what I would usually suggest to
all of you. Your name is
chairman. I think that's
important that I don't see on
the work plan is, uh, those of
you that have been around the
water issues for a long time,
Senator Stewart
I know this is the old
expression whiskeys for drinking
and waters for fighting, right?
And you all know the expression?
Well, uh, a great deal of our
resources, time and energy is
devoted to lawsuits over water,
and I think it would be wise to
invite the attorney General, uh,
to come in and discuss with us
what staff he's got and what
commitment they have to various
lawsuits. I saw. I see some work
plan kind of generally talking
about settlements and
litigation but between the
Native American pueblos farmers,
uh, it's Colorado, Texas,
Mexico.
The the A GS office is full of
litigation. I think it'd be good
to have them come in and perhaps
consider the need for an
executive session to talk about
that litigation.
I'm always really surprised by
how oftentimes water litigation
gets resolved without us, Uh,
which were the elected branch of
government, but we'll come in.
We'll be told the Amet.
Congratulations. The Ammon case
is settled. We just have to come
up with $90 million and the
deal's already been cut and
signed, and we just have to come
up with the money that that
really shouldn't be How it
works. We should be involved
throughout the process and on
the front end So I, I think
involving the A G in our work
plan, at least for some
presentation would make some
sense.
In Las Cruces is a great place.
You come down, We'll get you
chili on your way back up.
That's a bribe. Sorry. Call the
Ethics commission.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. Um
Yeah, My, my hope, is, uh,
That the work plan list is as
inclusive as possible.
So any other comments? I
certainly welcome. Um, we will
prepare a draft. That'll be
submitted, Um
Um and so like, if you think of
something on the way home, you
know, please be sure to send us
an email. Uh and we'll get that
added in
Um, herbs are small.
Thank you, Mr Chair. This is
great. Um, the under the other
Proposed work plan Topics number
18 for space ownership. I think
perhaps sort of seeing that
within carbon management and
carbon mitigation as part of
particularly within the energy
context makes a lot of, uh, of
sense, Mr Chair.
But also land my support to, um,
focus topics, deep dives and,
uh, really
Making the most of a short but
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chair. I'd just
like to add to it. Uh,
Representative Herrera was
discussing in, uh, the
infrastructure conversation. I
think if we don't get a hold of
the infrastructure conversation
and the needs and and really, uh
Really address it. We're we're,
um we're gonna be in a lot of
trouble because we already are
in in that vein, I'd say I'd
like to look at some of the
possible new technologies and
solutions that we, uh we have,
uh, coming into the state, one
of them being, uh, taking
atmospheric water and turn it
into clean drinking water. I
think that that is that would be
something to to hold at one of
those conversations. We're
talking about our drinking water
infrastructure and having some
solutions while we
Deal with the issue at hand in
the contamination of some of our
groundwater and
And other things that we're
seeing across the state. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
Why don't we, um
Please feel free to keep
thinking of topics. While we
sort of pause when we go back to
introductions because we had
some people arrive, Um, let's
let's pick up the people who
haven't introduced themselves,
um, represent Romero.
Thank you, Mr Chair,
representative Andrea Romero
from Northern Santa Fe County.
I'd be happy to not pause and
talk about another topic. But
I'll get on the list. Thank you
for having us, OK? I didn't. I
didn't hear that. Oh, I'll have
another. I have a topic that I'd
like to discuss. At some point.
Thank you. Would you like to
introduce yourself with? Yes.
Thank you. Everybody. Um, I'm
Joe Cervantes. I represent
Senate District 31, which is
about how about 1/4 of the
population of Dona County, and
it's a district that goes all
the way to the border of Mexico,
Um and El Paso.
Uh, representative Roy
cer.
Thank you, Mr Chair. And and,
uh, thank you to members of the
committee.
Place here and members of the
audience. My name is Patricia
Royal Caballero. I represent
house District 13, which is the
far Southwest Quadrant of
Albuquerque. And I'm happy to be
here again on this committee.
Thank you.
Uh, thank you Chair. Um I'm
representative Kathleen case
from district 44. So all of
Corrales, parts of Rio, Rancho
northern part of Albuquerque and
the unincorporated area of
Alameda.
And Representable.
Thank you very much. Mr Chair.
My name is Nathan Small. I'm
privileged to represent House
District 36 all down in Dona
County, some of northern Las
Cruces and much of the
Northeast, uh, part of Dona
County.
Thank you.
Did I miss anyone?
Um, I guess last call. Oh, ribs
have, uh, Ramiro.
Uh, thank you, Mr Chair. Um,
just a couple. Maybe one
question. Is this gonna be sort
of strategized as like a
Categorical list. OK, not just
the laundry list is that
Makes sense. Um, it will it will
get reorganized under the under.
Large headings. Water energy
conservation, Maybe climate
change. Uh, air? Uh, what we're
since you might have missed this
discussion. We, um
We shortened the length of our
of our interim, and as a result,
they gave us an extra meeting.
So we have four meetings instead
of the usual three. So we have
1/4 meeting that we might
Uh, used to focus on climate
change or other issues like
that.
Thank you for the clarification.
OK, so a couple things I would
love to. Maybe add to the list.
Uh, we had heard recently at the
water leaders. Um
Uh, conference that the
governor's office might be
looking at a fund that coheres
around not only the strategic
water reserve that was proposed,
um but also a broader
infrastructure Water
infrastructure fund. We could
get an update on that. It
doesn't We don't refer to any
sort of proposed plans at this
point from their perspective,
which I think would be helpful.
Um, another one would be on the
settlements that are currently
pending, Um, tribal water
settlements. All of the various
Patients that are in the queue,
Um, including those that have
been adjudicated like the Emmett
Settlement. How getting an
update as to how those are
performing, Um, and hearing from
the stakeholders would be really
helpful, and I think whether or
not it's
However, that may take place and
who would convene. I know that
our for pueblos in our district
that are subject to the adamant
a settlement.
I would love to hear from them
about how they're leading in, Um
Working through all of the
various things for as a report
for the Legislature, Um
And then building on that
Perhaps the aquifer mapping
program could be part of how to
mitigate some of the settlement
issues that apparently we don't
get these maps until we're in
litigation. So, um, just a plug
for funding that fully. Thank
you, Mr Chair.
OK, Thank you, Um
And I would know, you know the
governor's proposal was this
strategic water supply.
Because we already have a
strategic water reserve and we
are forever going to struggle
with that distinction because
they're
Um
OK, last call for topics, at
least at this meeting.
OK. Any other comments,
Questions concerns suggestions
about the the work plan, meeting
locations, meeting dates.
OK, great.
OK, so we're gonna We're gonna
move right along. Um
Like I said, if you think of
something on the way home,
please send us an email. Uh,
send us the panic. Um, have you
thought in advance of what month
we're going where so that we can
Plan around our other committees
and travel.
Um the, uh, sort of spans? The
only month I thought about is
August and New Mexico Tech
because of the the overlap that
was discussed.
And we will get
We will flesh that out soon.
And get that to everyone. It S.
I'm just a quick maybe Santa Fe
for October because of the
election because of the
election. Well, you get how many
people can you get? You know the
to the meeting that? Yeah. I see
your point.
OK, so that is right before the
election.
And having an Santa would be
good for the Santa Fe people
Great for Las Cruces.
Yeah, OK, well, we'll we'll work
on the we'll factor in the
election.
OK, so so next up.
Next up on our agenda. We have
post session report Natural
resources. Michaela Fisher and
Austin Davidson. Um and this is
my understanding is
Um
You're gonna tell us not what's
going to happen. But what did
happen in terms of budgets and
natural resource agencies? Um
Go ahead.
That's correct, Mister Chair and
thanks for having us I'm Mia
Fisher I'm a deputy director at
the Legislative Finance
Committee. I'm here with Austin
Davidson, Who's our natural
resources analyst, Um, you've
got a presentation that looks
like the one that's up on the
screen. Um, you can just follow
along the second slide there
just as, uh, Mr Chair said I'm
gonna provide an overview of
what happened with the, um
fiscal year 2025 General
Appropriations Act. That's what
happened in this last session
with the budget.
Um Austin is going to go into a
little bit deeper dive on the
natural resources agencies and a
lot of what we're gonna cover is
in our LFC Post session
publication. Those that you are
on the Finance Committee know
this publication. Well, it looks
like this. Um, it's on our
website. Um, it's a good
reference if you ever need to
come back and say, Oh, my gosh.
How much money did we put
towards this or what actually
happened, It's It's nice and
written in a, you know,
consumable form.
So on the third slide next
slide.
A lot of you have seen this, um,
chart before we use it in a lot
of lfc presentations. This just
shows the roller coaster ride
that we've been on with revenue
growth. Um, over the past, you
know, two decades, um, that
black line represents changes in
recurring revenues. So in it's
above the line you we have
increase in recurring revenues.
That's below. We've had a
decrease and you can compare
that to the amount of recurring
appropriations that the
Legislature has made over that
same time, which
Those blue bars.
Um and you can see you know,
it's this is our boom and bust
chart, but it's really been all
boom. Since you know the years
of solvency and fiscal year 16
and 17
and recurring spending has has
followed that. You know that
you've had more money to spend,
and and you've spent it so you
can see, especially in those you
know last
Three years, you know,
recurring revenues. Recurring
spending grew, you know, in the
double digits almost 13% for two
years there in fiscal year 23
and 24 last year, Uh, recurring
growth was only 6.7%, which
seems relatively modest compared
to that, but that's in response.
As you can see, Um, recurring
revenue is starting to moderate.
You know, we only had, uh, less
than a percent increase from the
prior year. So, um, that was
still you know, 12.8.
Billion dollars of recurring
revenue that, um, came into the
state for fiscal year. 25.
Hm. And I'll show you that you
know 6.7% is it's a nice sweet
spot if you turn to the next
slide.
Um
There you go. Yep. The state's
budget needs are expected to
grow, so you know, it's it's
It's your guys hard task every
year to figure out, you know.
Well, how much can we still
spend and not, you know, create
an expectation for spending and
out years that's going to be
more than the revenues that are
coming in. And so our economists
have done, you know a lot of
stress testing a lot of
forecasting to figure out where
that sweet spot is, Um, you can
see us. You know, we had a 3%
year over year growth really
just meeting inflation for the
next
That you know those green bars
on the left. You're leaving a
big gap, You know between that
and the revenue coming in on the
other side, you know if you had
10 years of recurring budgetary
growth year over year, you'd be
underwater pretty quickly by
about fiscal year. 28 is the
projection. So 6 7% you know, it
leaves you a little bit of a
cushion between that yellow line
and that, um, black line, which
is the budget with the $12.8
billion there in fiscal year.
25. That leaves you some space
for some
Occurring growing growth and,
um, keeping your reserves at a
comfortable place.
So the next slide
Here's the overview of what
actually happened in the fiscal
year for fiscal year. 25 in this
last session, uh, $10.2 billion
recurring budget. That's the
6.7% growth that was up from
about 9.5 billion in the prior
year.
That included, uh, 3%
compensation increase for state
classified employees, teachers
and higher Ed. Uh,
professionals. That was about
$89 million.
Oh, excuse me.
And you can see that you know
from that chart the spending
growth was really driven by
health and human services,
particularly Medicaid, as well
as, um, education and
particularly public education,
you know, says each of those
grew by over tw 200 million. You
know, it was close to 300
million for a public and higher
ed combined, and a lot of that
was driven by comp, You know,
just like most businesses, the
state spends a lot of its money
on personnel, and every time you
increase salaries, it costs a
lot of money.
Um
The other thing that happened
obviously, last year that most
of you know about is the
healthcare authority came into
effect kind of absorbing a lot
of, um, programming from the
Department of Health in
particular, as well as you know,
employee benefits from the
General Services Department.
You've got a super big agency
now. It's um, eating up almost
$2 billion of that, 10, you
know, $0.2 billion budget.
Um And when you start counting
in federal funds, including
Medicaid, the total budget from
all funds from that agency is
now you know, closer to 12
billion, it's bigger than the
state budget itself, so that's
going to continue to be a large
liability on the state. Um,
mostly driven by Medicaid rates.
You know, when Charles gave this
presentation in the C in April,
he made a good point that you
know when you think about
Medicaid When the economy is
down, you've got more people
relying on Medicaid for their
health care, and that costs the
state money.
But you know when the economy is
doing better, and maybe there's
not so many people relying on
Medicaid, the federal government
says, Hey, you're doing great.
You can pick up more of the
share, so it's kind of a double
edged sword. That's gonna be a
liability on the state going
forward. Kind of, no matter the
economic situation that we're
in.
And then on the next slide. I'm
going through this really quick
and you'll notice the
presentation is very thick and
you've got a lot of supplemental
charts, but I just wanted to,
you know, give you the high
level in, um
Reference to your time. But you
know we're here to answer any
questions, but I did want to
talk about non recurring
appropriations. So you know when
we looked at that chart a few
slides earlier with the
difference between the revenue
and the spending, and there was
a little bit of a gap there.
That's often where you're, you
know, Parking your non recurring
spending, state agencies have
been coming to the LFC with a
lot of requests. Um, in recent
years because there has been a
lot of money to spend, and you
can kind of see how the number
of those appropriations this is
just for
Special appropriations. So this
is just for one year money, But
you know, it's we're up to a
$1.4 billion in non recurring
funding for those projects now
and many of you know that there
was some movements last session
to help, you know, say we didn't
We don't wanna just do one time
funding for one time projects.
You know, we wanna be able to
spread some of this non
recurring out over a few years,
And so there was some like the
grow fund, in particular, which
many
You know about it was a a trust
fund that you parked about a
half a billion dollars into that
spins off into an expendable
program fund to help pilot some
of these bigger projects for a
few years to see. You know,
maybe we wanna see Gather some
evidence. Does you know this
teacher residency program does
this differential response
program work? Um and then, you
know, consider after we gather
some evidence if it makes sense
to work into the recurring
budget, rather than either doing
it in the recurring budget in
the first
Place or funding it just as a
one off in these, um
Special appropriations. So, um,
if you want, we can talk a
little bit more about some of
that non recurring money. We
also did a lot of fun transfers
trying to, you know, shore up
funds. Um, I know one that's
probably particularly
interested. Interesting to this
committee is the Conservation
Legacy Fund, which you plugged
three Hun 300 million into this
year to help make sure that that
fund is spent, you know,
starting to spin off money to
the agencies for programming
sooner rather than later.
Um, I think all pause there and
turn it over to Austin to go
into the details about some of
the natural resources agencies
but again, happy to answer any
questions. Uh, you or the
committee might have Mr Chair.
Thank you, Mia. If you turn to
page seven, you're gonna see a
little bit of an overview of
natural resources. You're gonna
see that the reoccurring
spending grew by 12.2 million.
And if you look at that table
you'll see on the baseline. The
percentages.
Now, if you go to the next
slide, which is gonna be page
eight, you'll see more of a deep
dive into the environment
department and you'll see on
that graph that from FY 14 to
now, FY 24. Their budget is
increased by 100 and 81% for a
variety of reasons, but
specifically in FY 25. We
increased their budget by 6.9
million or 27%, and a lot of
that went to the agency wide pay
races and then the appropriate
placement program that they're
doing at NMED.
Additionally, the remainder of
that went to building leases and
then office space.
If you go to the next page,
which is gonna be going over
energy, Minerals and natural
resources department
You'll see that similarly to
enemy D. Their budget grew by
quite a large amount over 10
years, roughly 89% and we
increased their budget in FY 25
by 12.5%, or 4.4 million
1.2 million of that went into
the second hotshot crew that
we're gonna be developing in New
Mexico.
And then In addition to that, I
went to the state parks. They're
also receiving funding for their
vacant positions.
Going into that next slide is
gonna be page 10.
You'll see the office of the
state engineer, which also has
the Interstate stream commission
within it.
And you'll see that similarly to
the other two agencies. Their
budget increased by 100 and 13%.
Over 10 years we increased their
budget in FY 25 by 2.7 million,
or 8.9%, and these increases are
related to the 2023 water policy
and Infrastructure Task force.
And also the Water Security
Planning Act implementation.
Also we passed out something
that's also part of the post
session. It's gonna look like
this.
It's gonna be basically a
breakdown of the general
recurring funding that we do for
natural resource agencies and
then the non recurring and
you'll see on that green slide.
I think it's going to be darker
Gray. I apologize for the
printout. Um, you're gonna see
that it's gonna break down some
of those major spending items
like the fully funding the
conservation Legacy Permanent
fund 20 million going into the
Indian water rights settlements
as well. So that is a really
good tool to look at
specifically what is going on
with each of the agencies
breaking
Reoccurring versus not
recurring.
And with that, Mr Chair, we can
stand for any questions about
specific.
OK, thank you for that, Uh,
questions from the committee.
I notice you said that we, uh
Increase the budget for the
Environment department.
Or
Better placement of their staff.
So
Did you get what? Uh, did did
The Environment department
finally get with the
Human Services Department.
Who
Change the boundaries of those
A bands.
Do we place them in in different
Rec categorize them. How
That was such a mess.
That
Who gave
Who blinked who who? Who ended
up
Saying that right?
So Mister Chair and Senator
Woods. It's It's It's a good
question. You know, I think
The state personnel office is
looking in particular at the
engineering classifications
Right now, I think there's some
concern that they are. You know,
the pay bands are not what they
should be at market, but I'll
say
You know, you know, because
you're part of the legislative
Finance Committee that we've
been working with Deloitte for
the last year and the State
personnel office to do an
overhaul of the whole state
personnel classification system
and make sure that
Our state employees are, you
know placed in the correct jobs
and that those jobs are placed
at pay bands that are
competitive with the market. Um
There's some indication that
we're we're a little out of
whack with probably some
environment positions, but maybe
that there's some
misclassification happening
there as well. And so the intent
is to come back this session
with something that's reasonable
and makes sense and we're not
doing a lot of this. You know
one agency one off appropriate
placement in the future.
Sure it's a whole lot like well,
you know, environment got it
done. Let's go to
Energy and minerals and see what
we can do there.
The state personnel office is
supposed to classify people
And they're supposed to hire
people in two classifications.
And your resume should
Put you in that classification.
I know this is way far off the
topic that you would like to
discuss, but it's a topic that I
think is very important because
I guess we're still close to 30%
down on
Unemployment in the state
overall.
And if you guys wanna make more
regulations
Not saying that you do.
But if someone wants to pass a
law in someone supposed to
administer that law
And we have more and more work
for people to do.
And we have less and less people
to do it.
Some rubbers. Gotta meet the
road.
And
I've tried to understand that
pace that state personnel office
It presented several times and
Who
I don't know what
It is an amazing story. Uh,
anybody needs a good nap. Invite
that guy in
Thank you very much, Mr Chair,
so, so I would like to discuss
something.
Um, with the committee. It's
unfortunate Chairman Small
stepped out. Uh, and this isn't
A topic that necessarily looking
for a response from
They'll see staff.
Um, this, uh, this is more of a
committee, um, issue.
So back in April.
Uh, I was
Cruising the news and I saw this
story from Source. New Mexico.
Which is one of the sort of
independent news outlets uh,
legislatures interim session
will include more focus on child
welfare and water.
Uh, Mexico Legislative staffers
at 10 of Agenda agendas for
subcomittee meetings dedicated
to child welfare and water
scheduled in the summer and
fall.
And
My issue with that is that I
think this committee is the
water committee.
And that if we have a
sub-committee of let's say
Finance committee
Um, I am very concerned that
For the the policy direction
that this committee and the
standing committees
In the House and Senate, uh,
including House Energy, House,
agriculture and sand
conservation.
Diverge from the policy
direction that is funded.
Through the state budget.
Uh and I had some discussion
about this issue with Chairman
Small who is
Just walked back in. We're
talking about the LC
subcommittees.
Um
And
It. It goes to my, uh,
frustration.
Um, that
We We have a process where the
budget is largely divorced from
policy making committees.
Uh, there are some exceptions to
that.
Uh, the EEC is, to some extent,
an exception.
Uh, the transportation budget.
Starts in the Transportation
Committee before it goes to
appropriations.
Um, I argued to Speaker Egolf.
That the Natural Resources
Committee budget should start in
the natural resource Committee.
Uh, committees.
Um and likewise.
We have health and human
services. I mean, we have each
of our standing committees.
Has a certain
Area that they focus on.
And for the most part, they are
state agencies that correspond
to those those areas of focus.
Um
I made the same argument to, uh,
Speaker Martinez and I was just
as successful as I was with
Speaker Egolf.
In convincing him to change that
process. So so here we are, with
LC forming subcommittees.
To address water, and it's a
concern of mine.
Um
German small not to put you on
the spot. But would you care to
Give your perspective on that.
True.
Uh, thank you, Chairman. Um,
great to see both, uh, deputy
director and, uh and Mr
Davidson. Thank you, Mr Chair. I
think I'd summarize a few
thoughts, one to thank the LSC
for their work to to really
share. Uh, kudos with this
entire legislature, as as we can
see from the numbers, our
natural resource agencies have,
uh, by proportional share,
probably been the largest bene.
Uh, in terms of of recurring
growth, and now we're seeing
significant non
recurring, uh, investments. Um
So that's something I think we
should all be very proud of.
Think particularly in the House.
we've worked to implement. Uh,
as many and and increasing
number of opportunities for all
members to participate.
And, um
That's I think a hallmark of
something that we've done. Uh
and we've seen our partners on
on the Senate side. I think the
subcomittee, uh, in this
structure, in part, looks at the
past appropriations of which we
see. There are, um, the most
we've ever appropriated, at
least during my time, and
there's a significant need to
sort of catch up and look back.
Um, I think speaking for myself,
and I think in confidence with
our members
We welcome um
A sort of continuing to leverage
each entity. Uh, you know,
frankly, there's more work than
To have everybody working on it.
I appreciate Mr Chair and share
the sentiment to sort of focus
at work so that it's going as
deep as possible.
Um
Would be a few a few thoughts.
but in and I would say, Mr Chair
that as we again we take on the
House side. We've had some
really good opportunities to
integrate. Uh, participation,
feedback and expertise. I think
we see now with LFC. Uh, I
choose to see the subcomittee in
that very much in that light as
additive and leveraging. It's
good to have concerns that are
raised so that we can mitigate
those.
Um
And when we look at the overall
funding levels and the outcomes
that we're getting more
enforcement
Uh, more, uh, conservation. More
partnership amongst different
stakeholders.
That have traditionally perhaps
been at odds. I think all that
points to positive, uh,
progress, so I guess my question
for Chairman Spa for the
committee is
What can we do to ensure that
Um
A water subcomittee and a water
committee.
Are working in concert.
That they're not on separate
path again speaking, Mr Chair
speaking solely for myself, Uh,
this type of opportunity is
central to that again. Speaking
solely for myself, the different
regular, uh, monthly, if not
more frequent check ins that
that we help lead. Uh, you and
we're taking this opportunity
now earlier than it's ever been
done.
Um
And I, you know, I could sort of
think back to past years when
there was critiques, probably
fairly that not enough
attention nor funding would go
to natural resource agencies.
There was frustration with that.
I think now we're hearing and
rightfully so that there is, uh,
major interest.
Appreciation for funding and the
desire to coordinate and
leverage strengths.
And I think, uh, you raising?
um this both concern as well as
looking as an opportunity is
exactly in line. I know. Uh, LSC
will be going to Socorro in
July. I think it is.
Um
And so I think, simply raising
it as an issue looking at the
Potential downsides if we don't
coordinate
But also being very open to
The opportunities.
And frankly again, I think, Mr
Chair. Uh,
Um, looking back with
Appreciation for the recent
Very significant focus attention
and investment in natural
resource agencies is positive.
So, II. I appreciate all that.
Um, you know, I'm in favor of
Um
Collaborative work between the
committees, um, between the
members, and we have members
that serve on both committees.
Um, I I one of my concerns is
I think the policy committee
should have a larger say in the
budget process. Another of my
concerns is we have at times
seen
Policy proposals. Um
Not adopted.
By the Legislature not adopted
by the policy committees and
still live on in the budget.
Um and
Move forward, and that's uh
That's a concern, uh, of mine.
Um
I had
The opportunity to meet with, um
Some members of the executive
branch, uh in discuss, uh, the
water strategic water supply.
Uh, which was a uh as initially
proposed A half billion dollar
investment. Um and I, You know,
I told them I
I wanna see a bill.
I wanna see a bill that outlines
what the strategic supply water
supply is how it works, Um, how
it's reflected as policy of the
state of New Mexico, not just a
line item in the budget.
Uh and they
I think heard that, um
You know, we'll we'll see how
that plays out.
OK, So, uh, we're getting some
some requests for comments.
Let's go The represents, Uh,
Lujan first.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um I would
just like to say that it was
If I'm not mistaken three years
ago in this committee that we
really moved the, um
The needle if you will on the
budget when we were looking at,
uh, some of the the budget
requests that were moving
forward and really making a
stand. I think that was under,
um, our vice chairs. Um
Tenure as the the chair that
That that's that, Uh, in interim
session. Excuse me, and we had
AFC.
Present and we had the agency's
presence and we actually had we
were to me. Budget hearings in
this committee and I thought
that that really moved the
needle. I was very, um
I. I like that That happened in
this committee to be quite
honest with you because it
really showed where every kind
of where everybody was and the
direction that this committee
was moving in in really
enforcing and why we saw these
budget increases Really with the
OS C budget at that at that time
and the advocacy from this, um
Membership here. That really
moved that, and we do have other
members that are that serve on
HFC or NLFC. And it would be,
um maybe more discussion with
our leadership with our chairs
to make sure that those members
if interested, are on those
subcommittees. And there is some
coordinations there and
I think that that that is a way
of working that and also that I
think we had other subcommittees
during LFC, where the chair of
of other committees with LC and
so forth were invited.
To those that when we had those
subcommittees and S during LFC
to make sure that their voice
was was present and represented
for that committee, so those are
the types of coordinations that
I've seen happen. Um, and the
way that this committee has
really had an influence on the
budget. Thank you, Mr Chair.
Thank you, representative, Uh
Senator ST Lopez. Thank you, Mr
Chair. That's good to hear, Um,
from representative Lujan, that
there are some efforts. Um, I
was gonna talk about the
legislative, health and human
services. They've had this
concern for a long time about
how things can appear in the
budget that affect policy
decisions, and all of a sudden
they're in the budget, and
there's no legislation about it.
Um, which gives the agency total
and complete discretion. Um, and
what they tried to do when
Suggestion. Um, a couple of
years ago is then. Uh
Co. Trujillo and I or Cheesy
Pinot met with had a meeting
with the lfc. Um and my
understanding is that didn't
result in anything that that was
significant. Um, so I think that
it's really important that we do
have those those discussions
because I while while it's not
good to have legislation without
funding, it's also not good to
have funding without
legislation, and we have both.
Um and I well and I've been the
situation of legislation without
funding with the water Data Act.
Um and, um and now we're
scrambling to to get I mean,
that was one of the first bills
I ever worked on in past and
we're constantly struggling, and
we're doing it with junior
money. We're doing it with other
things. And and that's just not
not the most effective way to
run. It would have been better
to have had those conversations
early on to make sure that that
Bill was adequately funded.
So I really encourage you in
what your idea is and support
any kind of, uh,
Enhance collaboration
Communication. Um
Policy input into those
expenditures. Thank you.
If I can just add on to that. I
mean, that was my experience.
uh, in in past years.
Um, under different leadership
than we currently have that you
know, I had to bill to have a
fiscal impact and I could get
passed through a couple of
committees and we go to house of
preparations and it was dead on
arrival because it wasn't in the
budget and so in inherently any
policy, or, um, change I wanted
to implement in the state that
had the fiscal impact.
I. I couldn't do
Um, that was That was my
experience. Um rosette cats.
I thank you chair and and thank
you for your comments. Um, I sit
on the Health and Human Services
Committee and we, too, are very
concerned about the
subcommittees. Uh, I do
appreciate the positive remarks
by chair small on the Cooper
operation that you know all
information. All data is needed.
I do look forward to a process
in which the committees and the
subcommittees can be
communicating with each other so
that we can best take advantage
of that additional data. Um, I
think
That that would also build some
trust in the
In the process. Um I just have a
clarification. Question one,
please. For your indulgence, Mr
Chair for Mr Davidson. Um, uh,
it could be on slide eight. But,
um
The question.
When did
Uh, the state begin to start
Right? Uh, rolling their
facilities management all up
into
The General Appropriations Fund.
I believe that it was 2019 Mr.
Chair representative. Are you
talking about capital? I
apologize for not understanding
the question. No I. I
I appreciate that. I'm sure I'm
not clear. Thank you. Um, uh, I.
I believe it would be reflective
on this. Environmental
department on Slide eight. But I
may not. So, um, I do know that
previously to 2019
that individual departments,
cabinet positions and individual
departments their facilities
management was through a variety
of different types of state
purchasing contracts and in 20.
It was the state goal to roll
them all up into the general
services. Correct.
Mr Chair, Representative. Um, I
apologize. I don't know that off
the top of my head. I can
certainly circle back as to the
history of that. I do know that
for the past three years, the
Environment department has
funded its building leases and
office spaces through the
General fund as a recurring
appropriation, and that is
common with other agencies.
So th Thank you, mister
Davidson. So, um and and and, uh
and and I don't know either.
This is a legitimate question,
but to me this graph
Um as the red line hits more of
the top of the blue line may be
more reflective.
Of the fact that we're rolling
our facilities management.
Up into this budget, then
The story of
Um, raises and staffing and
things like that. So I just want
to bring that to the committee's
attention. And maybe, um, in our
next meeting, we can get a more
in depth where you can send me
an email more in depth to
answer. I would appreciate it.
Thank you, Mr Chair.
Represent.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
Yeah, I remember. A year ago. I
think we were at the water
leaders Conference in, um in L,
Cruces and hearing getting a
press release on the front page
of the Albuquerque Journal
saying that we're going to
create a water, a strategic
water supply. Um for a half a
billion dollars, 500 million and
And I
I was just kind of aghast. And I
remember thinking, weren't we
just and I asked a member of the
environment. Uh, staff, weren't
we just talking six months ago
about trying to
Put in the budget 11 spots so
that we could hire people 11
people at the Environment
department. I. I said, Am I
going a little crazy? And they
said No, that was the
conversation. So what I'm saying
is I. I guess I'm going along
with the chairman and saying, I
always thought budget should
follow policy and I. I
continually see us.
Doing policy chasing after the
budget and and I do appreciate
Chairman Small your leadership.
It is a different environment. I
get it. And if these committees
can work together, I I don't
know exactly how that will work.
I think it's I think you're
trying to work in the right
direction, but I think it's a a
constant problem with this
legislature.
That that we we don't have
policy made at the policy
committees and then take it over
to the, uh, Appropriation
Committee. And then they decide
whether or not they'll
appropriate that and and it just
seems kind of normal to me. But
you know, I started in Congress,
and that's not normal either.
But at least there was a process
where you did authorizations.
Defining policy, and once that
was completed, you then took it
to the appropriation committee,
where then they decided whether
or not they would appropriate
the money for that, cause and
and again. No system is perfect,
but I would like to, and I hope
we're moving in that direction.
I would concur with you,
Chairman McQueen that that's
really where we ought to be, and
that's we're hearing that from
every single committee in this
legislature, So thank you.
Um, center Woods.
So, Mr Chair. I'm dominating too
much of the conversation here.
I. I dislike to bring up a
couple of things There's
sometimes on that.
Budget Committee.
You were brought information.
That probably the general public
doesn't have not that it's not
public information.
But like a water right
settlement.
They come to us and they tell us
the court dictates us or some
Somebody signed off on a
judgment.
And
We gotta pay the bills.
And it's not in FN or not. It's
it's we pay the bill.
And
I dislike that totally
Because I don't feel like you
guys got to vote on it and I
didn't get to vote on it.
But we gotta pay the bill.
And some of those are discord
dictates.
But other times we actually have
Executives, the agencies
That overspend their
appropriations.
Y'all don't get to vote on that.
I don't get to vote on that.
Sometimes we get to vote on a
bar.
But sometimes we let it go.
And it's against the law.
As chairman.
It's against the law.
And we let it go up to a tune of
over $100 million
The budget.
Is in the process of being made.
Last month.
So if you want something in the
budget
You better start talking up real
quick.
Because about
85% of that budget.
It's gonna happen. Just the way
it is right now. Is that close
85%?
Uh, Mister J and Senator Woods,
I you're talking about. It's
already cooked
Well, you know, I mean, we don't
We don't cut people's salary
generally in the budget, you
know, and that's a big
expenditure item. So so yes, I
would say, you know, we we do
incremental budgeting to a
certain extent.
There's a lot of that budget
that is already
Gonna be enforced.
You don't cut people salaries.
A lot of that stuff is out
there. That's the bill is gonna
have to be paid next year
because we made it last year.
And so, so much of that budget
is already out there.
So whenever you want to start a
new program, I might take you
back to page
Three.
When you want to start a new
program in the state of New
Mexico. We're not into cutting
nothing. Are we
We don't want to cut nothing
out. We wanna start something
new.
What this page shows you right
here.
Is that we're coming to a point.
That oil and gas is going to be
steady.
Oil and gas pays so much of our
bills.
Now we don't have any other
business in the state That's
doing very well. OK, Y'all
hadn't figured that out.
And so when oil and gas kind of
get steady
We don't have a rise in income.
To start new programs on
This is
Essentially, we're talking about
We better stay in the 6% rise
range.
And budgets.
Are we gonna as soon have to
start cutting
The revenue will not support
over a 6% rise.
On a budget.
Now, how much do you wanna give
state employees?
For a raise every year.
You? Well, the sesame you want
to give them whatever the cola
is right?
I mean, we wanna keep Oh, right.
So much of our budget is already
defined for us.
So when you talk talking about
new stuff
You have to have an increase.
In revenues coming into the
state.
But if you want to put some of
your program your new program
into the budget
You've got to start very early.
When it gets to the time of the
session.
And you want to bring a
Something in to start a new
program. At that point in time,
there's very, very, very little
money available.
At that point in time.
That's where
Representing small was talking
the other day about
Reserves.
A cause reserves is what we
Oh,
In the treasure in case the
revenues don't come in like we
think.
That we can lower those
reserves.
And have a little more money to
spend today.
And I know I'm going way far out
of the the the part that you
want to talk about Mr Chair.
But I want to tell you why. I
believe it's so hard to get
something in the budget.
At the time of the
Of the session.
I'm with you.
Ever new program should be voted
on by all of us.
Ideally, it would pass
completely through both houses
and be signed by the governor
before it goes in the budget.
But
For some of that stuff.
We're pretty sure that's gonna
go through, so we put it in the
budget.
There's a phrase that you can
use in that budget.
That won't let it in.
And that's contingent.
Of this bill being signed into
law.
I would keep
That's a question you should ask
during budget time whenever it
comes on the Senate floor.
Ask that question.
How many of these
Budget. New budget items are
contingent upon laws passing
And make them pointed out in
that budget, and I would other
thing expect each and every one
of you to do is read the budget.
Right. So for Sanborn read every
sentence of it.
Understand, or at least read the
back of it.
Read the back of it.
Read the specials.
If you want to know what's new
in the budget, read the
specials.
Try to understand the specials.
I'm preaching. I apologize, sir.
Uh, I know that the the
experience that I've had on the
the courts
Many times is by listening to
Senator Servantes.
Both in comedy and on floor.
And as he says, many times we
are mandated to pay bills.
That we don't have a chance not
to pay.
These these water right
settlements, the Indian water
rights settlements.
The uh uh
Many times the, uh, regional
water systems.
Some of this stuff is just there
that we're gonna have to pay.
And it was a decision. You're
not supposed to encumber
another, uh, Legislature, but we
are
We do every day.
Some of these things are in
process that that we have to
pay. We have to come up with
money to pay.
But
If you want something in the
budget
Start going to the budget
Committee and and and start
Talking it up.
That's the best way in the world
to get it in a budget committee.
Is start early, and we've
already started already. So
Two things. I agree 100% with
you, sir.
We should vote on everything
that's in that budget.
We should vote on it twice. We
should vote it on in a bill.
And then we vote on it.
When you see the overall budget
Coming to you.
But please read the budget.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator Woods, I. I
would just, uh
One comment You made, um
Which I think it was true.
Chairman Smalls, Uh, job would
be a lot easier, and that is if
oil and gas was steady.
And
Oil and gas has been big.
Recently and going up.
Um
If it was steady, you could plan
for the future and if it was
stable
You'd have an easier job
planning for the future.
But we all know it's not steady
over the years, so that's
something they got factor into.
And I know, uh, Chairman Small
has been, um
Uh, doing a lot to plan for that
future, So I appreciate that.
Uh, represent Roval Caballero.
Thank you, Mr Chair and thank
you for bringing this, um, very
important point.
For discussion because it's been
something that, as has been
mentioned by everyone who spoke
before and thank you to Senator
Woods. Um, he had on a lot of
major points, um, that I was
gonna make and that we've had
discussions on and then, um
Representative Herrera. I think
throughout the years uh, Mr
Chair we've all been having, uh
um a bit of friction.
In terms of how to
Um, manage.
Our policy.
Um
Decisions that
We will write into legislation
with
Uh, budgetary. Um
And, um
Relationships if they are, so
I'm gonna give you an example.
Um, real quickly and and thanks
to this senator's tenure.
An experience.
Had I not been, um at
Under his wing.
Um, I would not have known a lot
of these details.
This past session, and this goes
to representative Herrera's
point about chasing policy
chasing
Budget and sometimes vice versa,
But more so policy chasing
budget had to do with geothermal
and represent a small kind
attest to this as well. Senator
of Theo.
Was the lead sponsor in the
Senate, and I joined him in the
house.
And
He realized early on
The significance.
Of the geothermal policy
research and development, part
of it.
And then the contingent bills,
tax credits and the the fund.
And the relationships.
And, um, but we missed all of
the policy, Um, building that we
did in that piece of
legislation. We missed.
The time frames.
Of what Senator Woods just spoke
to
The time frame is relevant to
budget and discussions that are
going on all during this
process. It started literally a
month or two ago.
And so consequently, in order
for us to be able to move our
bills through the committees.
One of the key question to
committee chairs were asking
was have you addressed?
The budget.
On this because what's the point
of having a discussion in
committee? If the bill is gonna
pass the committee and then die
because it doesn't have
The budget approval. So there we
went.
And and this was a good question
and chairs are asking these
important questions because that
is why I mean it's it's good to
have the policy discussion,
obviously, because it's key
legislation. Uh, from what many
of us Mister chair, however.
We then were chasing the budget
We had to chase down where the
process was. We had to then kick
in high gear with the
departments and so on. Others
are familiar with that.
And so this is a good example
One example. The other example
has to do with the energy
transition app.
In the ETA. It was ve I mean,
it's a huge bill.
Um, it took me literally and I'm
a sponsor. But it took me
literally.
Um, several years since it's
passed to understand the full
impact.
In the full impact, Mr. Chair,
It clearly gives us our policy
direction.
For the next
Whatever time period 10 years,
maybe I I it, says 20, but
Gives us a clear policy
direction.
Where's the correlation
relationship between the policy
that's dictated in that act.
That's now law.
Relevant to how's that being
discussed in the budget?
Uh, as it's unfolding.
We have an app a law that
Senator Woods alluded to
earlier that's already dictating
what we should be doing that all
of us should be looking at
introducing legislation that
pertains to major components. If
we agree with them in our
constituents.
Are in line with them should be
following so that we can ensure
that we meet the goals of that
law.
So that's another example that I
give because in reading through
it, I realized that there are
huge number of renewable energy,
water issues. Other issues in
that act that we should be
already addressing in our
policy 60 day sessions. This is
another reason why we should
have
Longer sessions every year. Um,
Mr Chair, so that's another
example of how we could
strategically relate.
The policy piece of legislation.
To what has already been enacted
in law.
And we stay.
In a great relationship because
then within the budget
discussions were aligned.
Our bills are aligned. Our
policies are aligned. So I say
all that, um
Mr Chair to offer the following
suggestion.
That I think would be very
helpful if chair small and
others could
Kind of, um, referred to
sometimes we forget that we have
excellent experts.
Right here in the state. One of
the persons that I learned
Very much from and why I became
my my field of expertise, and my
study was public financing and
budgeting was from James
Jimenez.
The former Cabinet secretary of
D FA.
And James Cimen is also taught.
This course taught many of us,
uh, in this room and in in our
staff, um
About the relationship between
public finance and budgeting and
the Legislature.
And part of graduating from that
class was to
Uh, in enumerate.
A process We were to come up
with a
What? I just described
legislation budget, how it's
aligned and who to go to and how
does it unfold?
He would be an excellent person
to invite.
By the LFC cause we can't we may
all have our expertise.
But there's some of that. We
need to rely on their wisdom and
their
Broader, uh or more singular
expertise in what we have
So my suggestion would be before
this gets too far into the
process that perhaps him having
him come and give a short
presentation.
So that we then can align better
Chairman and chair McQueen align
better what we've been
discussing.
And maybe find
A resolution to an approach that
would be appropriately placed
our fiscal our policy with
fiscal and fiduciary
appropriateness.
As we enter into my fear, Uh, Mr
Chair if we don't resolve this
is that we're going to, um
Fall short.
Of meeting a lot of our, um
obligations that we already have
that are
Outlined by previous pieces of
legislation and also the interim
process is for the point of
What you mentioned earlier.
We're we have water experts as
an example we have experts come
And talk to us and and and help
guide us in our policy
decisions.
And so
We're already behind. We also
use the interim process as a way
in which to hear from our
constituents. That's why we meet
around the state.
About policy priorities.
But but we're already midway
through a budget.
Process. So again, we've got to
kind of step back. I think a
little bit because I sit on a L
HHS I sit on LES C.
I'm here in a few other
committees, and it's a burning
issue.
With all of us, and so, I, I
thank you again for bringing it
up, and that's my suggestion. We
need to lean on who can help us
get through this. He also, um
um, well, anyway, James Jimenez
is a wonderful resource and I
would recommend that he come and
present.
To, um, share small and, uh, the
committees. Thank you.
Thank you, representative
Sarana.
Thank you. Mr Chairman. I am
pretty much echoing what
Senator, Wood said. We start the
budget early. We hear from all
the agencies and the experts. So
that's part of it. Um, there are
four of us sitting members
voting members on this
committee so you can always we
can work together to get the
word out every meeting. We have
so we can make sure we keep
water up in front and on the
subcomittee. There are 18 of us
on the committee and when it was
COFD or water, and I think, was
it 3/4 of us went to water, So
we know how important it is, and
that's our main topic or our
Real importance. The other thing
when you talked about the budget
I'm a sitting member. There are
things on the budget that we
have never seen and all of a
sudden they're there, So you're
not the only ones who hasn't
seen them. They're just pop up
magically. And but, um, but, uh,
anyway, I just wanted to say
that, um, Senator Woods pretty
much said everything.
Then your city of Lopez. Is it
OK to go back to ask the
question, and I apologize. I
know this is the second time.
So, um, thank you for the
presentation. It was really
helpful. Uh, Mr Chair, um, one
of the things that I don't see
here is the budget for the
natural resources Trustee. Is
that because it where isn't it
in the attorney General's
office, or how would we follow
that?
Uh, the office of, uh, natural
resource trustee is gonna be
under NMED. But that's not gonna
be with Excuse me in the New
Mexico Environment Department.
So it would be so where is it?
Um, this was not created with
that in mind. It's such it's
such a smaller agency while it
does manage AAA large amount of
money, I didn't include it in
this specific graph. I can
certainly give you a breakdown
of their budget. If you'd like.
The The reason I ask is it is a
very small agency, but it has a
very important job and they do
use
A lot of, um or they could use
probably more attorney, um,
work because, you know,
enforcing state law and for the
on behalf of the community is
such an important, uh
Work that I think this committee
should be aware of it and also
perhaps provide input.
In increasing the resources that
they get mister chair. So So
thank you. So they just
So do we know it's just where
where would it be under
Under this
Uh, Senator, I apologize. It's
not going to be under there.
It's gonna be within the post
session and it's gonna be within
our volume two, but I can give
you the numbers right now, if
you'd like.
In terms of what specifically so
for general fund transfers, the
agency is gonna be at about
721,500 for a general fund
budget. 707 121,500.
And then the fun balance that
they manage, which I think is
the money that you're referring
to is 10 million right now. OK,
And so I actually had a meeting
with him. That was one of my
first meetings when I got the
job, and they discussed how they
use a lot of outside counsel to
do a lot of their legal fees,
and I think that they did also
discuss the possibility of
increasing their personnel to
have lawyers on staff because
the current head, the natural
resource trustee is a lawyer,
and I think she would like more
lawyers on staff, So I think
that's certainly something I can
discuss with her, and that could
be something brought to the
Thank you, but Yeah, thank you,
I. I appreciate that, and I
apologize for forgetting that
that point
Thank you.
OK, uh Roset Ferri.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um there's
been a lot of really good points
about policy driving budget. And
we have that also with tax
committee that also, you know,
involves funding.
And we have issues like with
alcohol and tobacco that are not
being recognized their policies
that we need and getting the
funding.
To that committee and and the
funding. So I think when we have
all of these opposing policy,
not driving budget, or, you
know, uh, funding that we are
At risk for not doing the things
that need to be done first.
Thank you, representative, Um,
the nurse of Felix.
Thank you, Mr Chair. Um it's
been my experience at the chairs
have been invited at the end of
the interim to present to the
LFC.
So, uh,
If that occurs, or you could
request to present in the middle
of the interim, as well as at
the end.
Because
Some of the points that are
coming up today from the
members.
Could certainly be brought to
LSC.
In a hearing.
So that it's clear that we would
like to have some say.
And then if you have if we have
some recommendations at the end,
we could also present those to
that.
Um, even if 85% or 100% of the
budget was done, uh, we could
put our voice out there and
protest. Thank you. And, uh,
Senator Felix on to that point.
Uh, we were invited to present
last year and you were out of
town. So you had me go. I think
I had 15 minutes.
Um it it's a complicated process
to address in 15 minutes.
So, uh, I. I took the
opportunity. I encouraged them
to fully fund our our state
agencies.
As a priority and
Basically
Uh, resent the
It's really quickly, Mister
Chair. I just like to say that
Um
As we're going to address these
these huge issues these 21st
century issues if we will, but
have always been issues and
regarding water.
And energy policy that if we
We're gonna see that reflected
in the budget more than I think
we ever have. And we're talking
about infrastructure and we're
talking about how we're going to
develop planning and strategy.
The planning strategy a lot of
that's gonna get done through
the policy and a lot and there's
a lot of overlap of what FC does
as well with with the work that
those in front of us right now
are doing and I wanna thank you
for that. And I think that is
where I capture what is going
on, Um as a as a member, but
It's It's very hard. I think
that we need to be cognizant of
that. And I think we need to
understand what the policy and
the issues of this committee are
moving. How they are going to
move this budget forward because
never before, have we seen, uh
these types of increases in our
budget and it has been driven
and it is being driven by this
committee and the issues that we
we see, uh, policy wise in this
committee, so I'd just like to
really emphasize that and not
diminish any of our our voices
and what we we have before us is
As far as what we have to get
done for our state. Thank you,
Mr Chair.
Any further questions for our
Panelists.
OK, Great. Thank you very much
for your presentation.
Um so we're gonna move to a
public comment.
Um and I
Um are we on zoom is that
So it's not a Webcast. It's an
actual zoom.
OK, so if if you're on the zoom
and would like to speak to us,
please raise your hand.
Um, is there anyone in the room
show hands that would like to
talk to us? OK, see, then do it.
Um
Do you have any on zoom?
OK?
So, um, we we have two members
of the public that would like to
speak to us. Let's let's do if
you could, uh, make your
comments in about three minutes.
I'd appreciate it. Since there's
only two. We probably have a
little bit of leeway there. And
so our first up is Norm Gom.
And so we're gonna try to get
you unmuted.
It's
I believe I am Unmuted. Mr.
Chairman, we can hear you.
I'm Norm Gom, a licensed water
engineer, retired. I live in
rural Sandoval County, adjacent
to Albuquerque.
Um, I'm a former director for
5.5 years at the Interstate
Stream Commission. I'm currently
the president.
Of a nongovernmental
organization named the Water
Advocates for New Mexico in the
Middle Rio Grande.
I want to tell you that I really
appreciate the discussion about
Budget, uh, not driving policy,
but rather, um, making policy,
inform and drive the budget.
This is a short quotation from
the water policy and
Infrastructure Task Force report
driven by drought and climate
change. New Mexico's water
crisis has laid bare water
policies and processes that
users, practitioners and
lawmakers agree are not meeting
the 21st century needs of new
Mexicans under the stress of
drought.
Aging infrastructure and climate
change.
A window of opportunity is open
before us.
One of the authors of the Leap
Head analysis, which lays the
scientific foundation of
recognizing our water crisis.
Excuse me.
Climate is driving a
ratification. Preserving a water
supply requires mitigation of
greenhouse gasses and adaptation
to living with much less.
Time is of the essence
Water agency. Productivity
should be extremely appealing to
the Legislature.
Remember?
Water pot has laid bare water
policies and processes that
users, practitioners and
lawmakers are not meet or agree
or not meeting 21st century
needs.
Our agencies are equipped with
20th, century hardware and
software.
They have business practices
that date to the 19 seventies
rules and regulations that date
to the 19 seventies.
We have to have in addition to
the head count.
Modernization of the agency's
tools.
This year, right after the big
budget passed.
I learned that the state
Engineers Hydrology bureau
Was ready to almost mutiny
because they could not do their
jobs. They cannot do their jobs
with a computer resources they
have
I also know for my interactions
with staff.
That staff daily encounters
computer problems that hinder
their productivity.
So one of the questions I would
like to get an answer to is who
didn't ask or who said
That the OSCE and the IC should
not have computer equipment.
basic computer equipment in
their budgets.
I wanna switch now to another
topic that you're concerns me
professionally.
And personally.
For all of my career, I've
termed marginal water resources
opportunities.
Uh, seeming that seem to always
attract public attention. I've
described them as bright and
shiny objects that serve to
distract.
Not to really solve any
problems.
The water policy and
infrastructure task force, water
Management and planning work
Group, which I co chaired along
with Liz Anderson from the Water
Authority in Albuquerque and
LaDonna Clayton from the Oglala
Land and Water Conservancy.
We did not include those
marginal opportunities in our
water management and planning
recommendations.
First of all, they're not
statewide. Second of all, they
their niche, and they require so
much site specific information
that it's hard to say generally
that that that they're going to
solve anything.
So they need to be pursued.
But what most needs to be
pursued is taking care of the
water we have, and we're not
doing that governance needs to
change.
Bright and shiny objects.
Look upon them with with a great
suspicion.
Because they're not gonna solve
our core water governance
problems.
Last. I wanna say that water is
an acute problem in New Mexico.
Over the years. I had numerous
conversations with former
legislative finance committee
director David Abbey.
He always viewed water as a
chronic problem, a problem that
in new Mexico would never be
solved that we were going to
continue to fight over water and
and water governance really,
really didn't require.
The kind of funding that that an
acute problem deserves.
Well, we have an acute problem
when we have a limited time
frame.
To deal with it.
Climate is driving all of this
as, uh, Senate, Um
Senate President Pro TEM Stewart
said.
I believe that the LFC continues
to look at water quantity,
governance improvement as
discretionary. I believe the
finance leaders do not get the
water. Big picture if we don't
get our hands around water.
Governance, transformative water
governance in the next 20 years.
It's gonna be too late, so
please pay attention to the
basics. Pay attention to the
prerequisites like the Water
Data Act.
In the 2023 Water Security
Planning Act and all the things
that need to be in place to make
those acts acts successful. That
is where I request.
Your attention to center. Thank
you very much.
Thank you, Norm.
Uh, next step we have Camilla
FB.
Thank you, Mr Chair and members
of the committee. I'm Camilla
Feibelman. I'm the director of
the Rio Grande chapter of the
Sierra Club. And I'm sorry for
not being with you in per in
person. You can probably hear
the kids in the background and
that's the nature of my comment
today is that there ought to be
an overlying question for the
committee about what the cost of
global climate change is to the
state. What does it cost us in
terms of kids, health and
elderly People's health.
What does it cost us in terms of
water availability or the risk
of wildfire, and I think that
speaks to the intersection of
the policy and the budget,
although we receive such great
income from oil and gas, even if
the royalties are low and not at
market rate.
But what is the cost to our
state? What's the cost to our
wildlife to our lands to our
communities and to our health?
And so I hope that
As the interim plays out that we
can again and again return to
those questions of the state of
our state when it comes to
climate change. Thank you so
much.
Thank you.
OK, Uh, that's it for public
comment, Uh, any
Final questions, comments
announcements from the
committee.
Oh, center City of just a brief
question. When? When do you know
when? When do you think, uh, Mr
Chair? You'll have the where
we're gonna go when
Just for planning purposes soon.
OK?
That helps me plan
or Kates.
Oh, Rosen Furry. Um, When would
you like any? If we have another
suggestion? Do you want us to
make it now? Or do you want us
to just write it and send it
since we're pretty much at the
end of the meeting? Why don't
you send us an email? You send
me an email. Copy, Sarah. Just
one more about school. OK,
great and that and that goes for
for everyone any more
suggestions over the next
They are, too. Uh, please send
us an email.
Uh, Senator Steinmark. Thank
you, Mr Chair. Just just a
little footnote on what I said
earlier. I guess maybe for your
benefit Sarah and yours as well,
Mister Chair when we were
talking about contamination and
cleanup of contaminated sites en
MED specifically is getting
their arms around a proposal
that's ruminating the executive
so they would be a kind of a go
to entity for us and planning
about hearing about a fund that
could help address a number of
different contamination sources.
I was kind of generally speaking
about it earlier, but
Actually, the go to
Entity.
To talk to us about that.
OK, thank you for that.
OK, uh And with that, uh, thank
