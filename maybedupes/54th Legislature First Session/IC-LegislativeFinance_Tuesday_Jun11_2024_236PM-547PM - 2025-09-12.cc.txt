All right, are
um are
presenters
ready?
OK.
Are you ready for us?
All right, I think so.
Go ahead.
Why don't we begin? All >> right.
Um Good
afternoon, everyone. I'll give you a
little bit of a roadmap
of how we're going to spend our time
this afternoon and direct you to
your materials that you have.
Uh My name is Rachel Mercer
Garcia. I'm the LFC
analyst for CYFD.
Joined with me at the table is Emily
Hilla. She's the
analyst over it.
Um And then we have Sarah
Jens and Nathan Eckberg
who are also, we're going to walk you through
the presentation that you
have. So we have three
items kind of on
this child welfare subcomittee.
And so
I actually don't know the right term.
Are you chair of subcomittee?
Representative Vice chair?
All right,
let me know if this
kind of flow works
for you. Um LFC
staff have prepared prepared
an overview. It will be a high
level overview of the child
welfare system. How much do we
spend? How is it performing?
Then we have a legat
hearing where we're going to bring
forth three
performance challenges.
Um Secretary Garas will be
here to talk through actions that the
department is taking related to
those. And then we have
on the agenda, a deeper
dive on prevention and
early intervention. So,
um you'll see us kind
of swap out. And so
uh vice chair, I'll, I'll look to
you in terms of when you want to direct
questions. Um
But we're gonna be working from,
you have two items behind
tab D in your binders.
So you have a brief
that looks like this labeled
legist that I'm
not gonna read extensively
from the brief, but know there's more
information in it.
We are gonna be working
from this powerpoint
deck that just kind of pulls out
key information and it says,
uh New Mexico's Child
Welfare System.
Um And what Emily and I will
start with is just sort
of how is the system organized?
Where is the money and how are we
performing? Um
So I'm actually gonna start
on page three
of the powerpoint Child
Welfare trends and
I'm gonna talk you through some
high-level data about
our state.
Um So none of this information
will likely feel new to you all,
but just kind of grounding us in our
state's context.
Um If you look at slide
four,
we highlight for you all that New
Mexico has relatively
high rates of adverse
childhood experiences.
About 25% of all
adults in our state have
four or more
and adverse
childhood experiences predict
a number of
social outcomes
and they include things like
abuse, neglect and household
dysfunction and are
connected with later
life outcomes including
um participation
um in our state's correctional
facilities, higher rates of behavioral
health outcomes and they tend to
be cyclical. And so
that just sort of sets the
context um
for our state.
On the next slide, you'll see
we have um
persistently high rates
as well of
child maltreatment
and repeat maltreatment.
And so when we talk
about performance challenges,
this is one of the ones
um that we've asked the FD to
talk through, what are we doing to
change this reality in our
state? But we have consistently
had a rate of
maltreatment that is higher
than the nation as well as
a, a rate of repeat
maltreatment. That's a, a child
with a substantiated instance
of child maltreatment that reoccurs
within 12 months.
Um On slide six,
that rate right now is about
14%.
Um And to benchmark
that nationally is about
9%.
And if you look at slide
five, we talk a little
bit more about uh the child
maltreatment rates in our
state. Um As I
mentioned, we tend to be higher than
the national average. So the rate
of child maltreatment in New
Mexico is about
12.7 for
every 1000
Children compared to a national
rate of 7.7.
Um And so one of the challenges for
our state is to change that outcome
for Children.
If you look at the pie
chart on
slide five
that breaks down
substantiated cases
of child maltreatment that
includes abuse and
neglect. This data
is reported by
CYFD or Child
Welfare Agency to the federal
government. It does
lag a little bit. Um
But what you'll see in that chart is
about two thirds of
those instances of child
maltreatment are neglect
and that
mirrors a trend
nationally though nationally,
neglect makes
up about 74%
of instances of child
maltreatment.
So if you look now
at slide eight, this
kind of paints a picture of what
our state's foster care
system looks like.
In that first chart, you'll
see um the
number of cases of Children
who are placed in the custody
of CYFD and how
that has trended over the
last few years.
Um We had been around
1700
young people placed in the custody
of uh protective services.
We're now around 2000
youth
in the next chart you'll see
um over the last year,
sort of how resource or
foster homes
have trended. So
those are the placements for
young people. And one of
the things that you'll see is we've remained
pretty flat
over the last year and we have
about 1000
resource homes or
placements for youth in
custody
nationally. New Mexico
has a rate of child
care. I'm sorry, foster care
placement, that's a little bit below the
national average, which um,
child welfare experts
would generally say is a good thing.
But one of the things that we have
seen consistently is
that we don't have enough placements
for young people when they
enter into the custody of
Cyfd. And so this is one
of those second performance
challenges that we have asked
the department to focus on
this year. And that is how
are we doing in terms of finding
appropriate placements
for young people.
Research consistently
finds that placement in
a community based
setting
is the most likely
to produce a positive outcome
for a young person placed in
protective custody. Whereas
placement in a congregant
or group care setting
generally is associated
with poor outcomes for those young
people. And so another
measure that we keep an eye on,
um And you'll see in Coif
D's report card is
um whether you are placed in
the least restrictive
environment. And so, if there aren't
enough um
resource or foster care
placements, we may see an uptick
in that area. And so this is that
second performance challenge
that the department will focus
on, they will talk to you a little
bit about some efforts they have put in
place um to try
to recruit routine
and support um
foster care
placements.
We move on to the next slide
slide seven, we have
a little bit more data about what are some
of the risk factors
um observed in New
Mexico. Again, this
data comes from
the federal government, all state
child Welfare agencies
report it to the federal government.
And these are in particular,
if you look at the bar chart,
the risk factors that
are recorded among the
caregivers of
Children of, of child
victims. And so,
um while uh
we don't always get
data or information
about some of those risk factors.
What is consistently true
in New Mexico is that
drug use and alcohol use
are um
consistently the highest
reported caregiver risk
factors. I'll note in the data that
you have, this is from
2022.
Um And New
Mexico did not report
domestic violence data
related to caregivers.
The last time we did that was in
2020. Um And
at that time, that rate was about
2%. So
the trend kind of has
persisted over time where
substance use tends to be
one of the greatest risk factors
that are reported among the
caregivers of Children who
are victims.
Um And then if you
turn to slide nine,
we highlight some data
around Cyf D's
workforce, particularly
in protective services.
This has also been a persistent
challenge for our state
and mirrors national
trends. Um But one of the
things that you will see in that
first chart is that over
time, while appropriations have
increased for protective services
and personnel, um
Cyfd has experienced
challenges, filling roles
and has had high vacancy
rates. Um
You'll, if you look at
the first bar chart, you'll
see there has been an uptick in
fy 24
CYFD has made some
progress to fill vacant
roles um particularly
in protective services.
But if you look at that last
chart um continues
to experience a high turnover
rate among protective
service uh workers. And
that um according
to Annie Casey Foundation
is connected to or
turnover is connected to
several outcomes
um that are not positive for
kids in terms of longer
time to permanency
and that kind of thing.
Um to put New Mexico
in context. Um
our turnover rate among
Protective services right now
is 32%
nationally. The rate is
about 30. But
Annie Casey would recommend a
rate around 12%
is, is much healthier.
And so this is kind of that
last performance
challenge that we've
asked CFT to focus
on and that is um
workforce recruiting
and retaining a professional
workforce, particularly in
protective services.
Again, as I mentioned, they've made some
progress in terms of
hiring. Um and they
will likely talk to you all about
one challenge that they're
experiencing and,
and that relates to the
drawdown of Federal
title four E and Foster
Care Administration. That may
just be a barrier when it
comes to being able to build
positions.
Um So if you
go now to slide,
10, I'm
just gonna walk very briefly
through how our
state's child welfare system
is organized. Again, this
information is likely not
new to you all.
Um But it's sort of a reminder
that CYFD is not the only
system or agency involved in our
system. So, on that
first slide um
chart 11, you'll see
when it comes to preventing
child maltreatment, there are a
variety of agencies
involved that includes
the health care authority, the
administration of things like
child care Assistance or income
support that address issues
related to poverty.
That includes agencies like
CE D who provides
home visiting services.
Have you as you kind of move
down that pyramid
and the number of risk
increase at
that very tertiary
level. That's where CYFD
plays sort of a unique role.
There's no other agency really that's
kind of serving those very
highest risk
families where maltreatment
has occurred. So we share
this slide just to remind
that there are a variety of
agencies that are
involved in
maltreatment
prevention.
Once maltreatment has
occurred, if you look at
slide 12,
this is just sort of an
overview of what happens
in this system um
as, as a, as a means of
flow chart. So
uh
um an instance
of maltreatment is reported to
CYFD and then they
make a variety of decisions
um as to what to do
next.
If you look at slide 13,
we then note that
while CFD is
kind of primarily involved
in instances of
maltreatment, there are again
a variety of agencies
that become involved in those
cases. And so I want to
just highlight some of the other
organizations and agencies
that play a role. So
for example, the Department of
Public Safety in our state
has the legal authority
to remove a child and
place them into protective
custody. Then
the courts are involved. Judges
make um ultimate
decisions about if abuse or
neglect has occurred and make
determinations about
whether a child may safely
be returned home.
Um The Office of Family
Representation and Advocacy,
which is an
organization uh
an agency that was created and
operated for the first time.
This year. Independently
provides legal
representation to
both the Children and
the respondents in child
welfare cases.
Previously,
Ofra was part of the administrative
office of the Courts and they
now operate as their own
agency. And then the
health care authority is deeply
involved in this system.
Um in part, because
Medicaid is a key funding
source. And so just highlight for
you all kind of the interaction
of a variety of agencies though
we will be focused on
CYFD
today.
Um And then kind of the last
uh slide in terms of the system
overview on slide.
14, we just give you
just sort of a basic timeline
about the iteration of
CYFD as an agency
over time. So,
um COFD was created
in 1991
following a task
force convened by the governor
and at that time and
in the enabling legislation, you'll
see a real emphasis on
prevention and early
intervention.
Um Kind of the structure
of the department has changed
over time. In
1992 Adult
and Child Protective Services
were added in
1994 there were some
changes to the structure of
the agency and statute.
Uh And then in 2005,
um aging and long term
services was created and,
and took the Adult Protective Services
piece in 2020.
As you all know, we
created, you all created the early
childhood care and education
department. And so today,
there are four core
service areas
or programs that
operate in
CFD and those
are juvenile justice
Protective Services,
children's behavioral health, and then
program support or
administration.
So that's sort of the
overview of the structure.
Um If you walk
with me to slide 15,
I'll give you just a brief overview
about the funding context
or
CYFD.
So on slide
16, you will see
a little bit about the agency's
budget overall.
So for Fy 24
Cyf D's operating
budget was 384.5
million. Um
That budget breaks down
into those four programs
that I mentioned. Um
And in that second chart,
the bar chart, you can see the
growth over time.
And so between Fy
21 and Fy
24 you
all made significant
investments in, in
CYF D's operating
budget, particularly in
the general fund.
And so for Fy
25
Cyf D's operating
budget is relatively
flat. Um Though
you all made kind of targeted
investments on the special
appropriation
side,
if you look at that um pie
chart next to the
bar, um you'll see kind of
the breakdown of state and federal
funds um and you'll
see that um federal
funds make up um
overall
um about a
third. But if you flip to the next
chart, um on
page 17,
you'll see the breakdown
particularly for protective
services. So,
um currently
federal funds make up about
38% of
CYF D's operating
budget.
Um I'm sorry,
Protective Services operating
budget. And between fy
14 and fy
24 CF
D's operating budget for
protective services has
grown by about $100
million while
that distribution has
remained relatively the
same in terms of about
38% is federal
funds. Now, about
eightish percent is a
transfer in, that's
primarily TF and
the rest is general fund
when it comes to Protective Services.
One of the core um funding
mechanisms is the federal
title four Foster
care program.
So, um when it comes
to uh foster care
maintenance payments, that's the direct
care for youth in custody.
Um New Mexico
receives the state f
map rate, we essentially reimburse
for those costs.
And that right now is
about a little under
75%
when it comes to administration
of foster care, New
Mexico is eligible
or states are eligible to
reimburse about 50%
of eligible costs from
the federal government. And so
those are some of the key funding
mechanisms.
Um I point that one out
because CFD is experiencing
a challenge right now in drawing
down federal title four
E funds, we've seen a
significant drop
in that revenue
over the last two
years. And so CFD
is currently projecting
somewhere between a 13 and
$15 million
shortfall in protective
services this year. And
that is because of a
significant drop
in the reimbursement for
federal title four, that
I understand they're really trying to work
to understand what may be
driving that.
Um But if you look at
kind of that bar chart, imagine
then that about 13 to
15 million in the federal
funds aren't coming in
at that
level.
Um ok, so if you
then turn to slide
18, as I
mentioned, um you
all appropriated a relatively
flat operating budget
for Cyfd in Fy
25
in part, because historically,
Cyfd has reverted
quite a bit of money
um but made some
targeted
investments
in the grow or those
three year pilot program.
So if you look at slide
18, that lists what
some of those appropriations
are for fy
25 and they
include things like funds
to incentivize master's
level, social work
and the expansion
of alternative or differential
response
community based prevention
and intervention programs. And
also some targeted funds
to recruit retained foster
families. And you'll see
many of those targeted investments
are directly connected to
some of those performance
challenges that
I described. And then
finally, you all
reauthorized
prior year
special appropriations that had
gone unused and
that included 3 million to
support workforce development
and then 20 million for behavioral
health provider
capacity.
So that sort of summarizes the
operating budget side. I'm
gonna turn it to my colleague Emily to
talk you a little bit through the
it side and some of the
resources available
there.
>> Hello, chair members again,
I am Emily, I am the LFC
analyst for the Department of Information
Technology which
oversees all of these state
funded it projects.
And so I just want to talk to you all a bit
about the NM
impact project or C whiz. I'm
sure you've heard of this. Um but
C whiz it stands for the Comprehensive
Child Welfare Information
System there. Is
this it in depth sheet
that should be included in your packet.
I'm not going to go into it in too much
depth, but it does have project
history. Uh funding
breakdown. Is it
in your packet
and your binder at all?
Anywhere it
is.
>> Yeah, it should be behind
this brief
and it says I I >> T in
depth. OK,
perfect. Awesome. So
this is what I'm gonna be referring to.
But if you want to look at that more in depth
and ask any questions that come up,
please do. Um
But uh in 2016,
the Federal Administration on
Children and families
um announced new rules for states
to replace their it systems.
Currently, CCYFD
is operating on their family,
automated client tracking system
facts which is about 25
years old
after this new federal requirement
from the AC FCYFD
started working on their C whiz
project in November in
2017 with an
initially initial
cost estimate of 32
million with an end date in mind
of October 2022.
Currently, the end date for
C whiz is projected to be November
of 2027 10 years
later than the start date and
is now expected to cost
$82,000,056
million. More than the
initial cost
estimate.
If you look on slide, a
slide 19 of
the uh packet that Rachel was just
reading off of. You can see the LFC
report card rating. Um
Everything is in yellow, this is actually
an increase um
or a decrease um
in the overall rating. So that means
that Cyfd
is progressing pretty
ok. Um In terms of
how they have historically been
performing with this um
it project
but outside of having a new
it system to
maintain federal and
state requirements, some
potential be benefits
of uh C WS
to the child welfare system
include decreased time to
permanency, better
safety decisions, sharing
of data across agencies
and improvements to caseworker
overload.
Now, I just wanted to
mention a few
statistics that Idaho
has seen with their
sea whiz project.
They are the only state to have
implemented a fully compliant
C whiz system. And
according to their vendor Deloitte,
they have seen a 30%
increase in child welfare staff
capacity, an
82% decrease in
safety decision backlogs
and a change of 57
to 13 days in time to
safety decisions, which is
a 77%
change. So
this is a little bit about what the state
is investing. This total
82 million is not totally
coming from the states. Part of that
is federal funding and Medicaid
funding from um the
hahcahsd.
Um So far, the state
has funded $34
million in general.
Funding, CYFD
did not ask for any new funding
this past session,
but they did reauthorize
$10 million towards this
project. So that is
where CWS is standing
as of right now.
And with that, is it over
to me? Then
>> we will
pause,
we'll pause here and then by
let us know if you want to ask us any
questions, we're now gonna turn
it over. Then otherwise to
our colleagues who will talk about
kind of research and evaluation
related to prevention
programs and kind of best
practices nationally
unless you want us to pause for
questions. >> Um We
do have a couple of people that have
questions, but um
so we would be
moving along but not
to the legislate or we
would be going into the legislative.
>> Um So Vice
chair, um Nathan
and Sarah are going to share sort of
an overview of prevention
that sort of set the stage
for the deeper dive topics.
>> Ok. So why don't we go ahead
with that? And then um
right before
the.
>> Ok. So thank you, Chair
Dixon and uh members.
Um If you'll turn with me to
page 20 on the uh
LFC
slides,
uh like Rachel said, Sarah
and I are going to talk
about some of L fc's key
reports and recommendations over
the last few years having to do
with child welfare.
Um as well as uh
giving some examples of
programs that are currently being
implemented by CYFD
and that have historically been
implemented and really
whether or not these programs are
effective, including a return
on investment
analysis.
So with that, if you'll turn with me
over to page 21
here on 21 this is just
a quick note of an example
of what you as a legislature.
Uh One thing that you as the legislature
has done to, to help improve
the system and that is uh
Senate Joint Memorial
five that passed
this last legislative se
legislative session.
Um You can see here on the
slide, a list of the topics
that the task force
is looking at.
Um and that will culminate
in a recommendation
in uh in a report to the
legislature and the governor
uh in November of this
year, uh the first
meeting of the task force was
held on May 24th
and they are being webcast and are
open to the public. So that's
one thing that's a
direct result
of, of legislation that's going on
right now
if you turn to page
22 or slide
22.
Uh over the, the last few
years, LFC staff
have uh produced
a number of publications on the
topic of child welfare
and just to sum up the findings,
uh the legislature
may consider expanding
continued
investments
in
prevent uh early
childhood prevention
programs. And
uh these are programs
that Doctor Denis or, or
Sarah will talk about shortly.
Um And the reason we
recommend that is because we
know that these
servicess can lead to positive
outcomes. Uh However,
some of our findings do
show that there are
still some challenges with
program implementation
and oversight.
Uh Some examples of
uh recent reports that you can find
on our website um is
our accountability report on
early childhood, which we produce
every two years.
Uh We have a results, first
report on evidence
based options to address child
uh maltreatment. Uh
We have a recent program
evaluation on home
visiting. Uh But
again, Sarah will talk about some of
these programs in a little bit more
detail uh coming
up.
Uh So slide
23
uh this shows LF C's
framework for child welfare
system improvements
and it kind of goes back to what I was just
saying about some of the recommendations
that we found. And
so the first one is to implement
evidence based prevention and
early intervention programs to support
families and
divert formal system
involvement.
So that's kind of taking the money
from the back end where the
family is already in crisis and
moving it to the front end in the hopes
of preventing uh that
crisis uh
to recruit, retain
support and develop a professional
social work workforce,
expand access to be
health and other services
and strengthen oversight and accountability
mechanisms.
Turning to slide
24
this uh slide is
very similar to what uh
Rachel talked about
um over on slide 11,
but it just gives a little bit more.
Well, it gives examples of
really uh some of the
programs that are
offered by these other agencies.
So as you can
see, um as
we move down this pyramid
towards the point,
you'll see that it is really Cyfd
who is tasked with assessing and
addressing cases of child mil
maltreatment and
that's when the abuse and neglect
has already occurred. So the family
is in crisis. But
towards the top of that pyramid,
you can see
uh if, when we're
just talking about the general population,
when there aren't those risk factors
involved, we have
several different
agencies.
And then what's different on
this side is you have the example
programs they're listed on the right
side. So
for the general
population, you have uh
programs such as childcare,
income support and
family connects home visiting
as you move down towards that kind
of the middle of the
pyramid. Uh
This is when there are
risk factors involved. So we
see uh CYFD
sort of enter the picture at this
point and uh
you can see the programs involved
there. And then as you get a
again to that point,
that's when we have the more
intensive
programs uh including
differential response which uh
Sarah will be talking
about.
And is that I turn
it over? Yeah. So with that, I'm
gonna turn it over to Sarah and she'll give
some examples of these programs we're
talking
about.
>> Thanks, Nathan. If you'll all
turn with me to page 25
you'll see a
chart that has a
number of different returns on
investment for various home visiting.
Oh, sorry, various uh
programs that have been shown
to impact child maltreatment
and the returns on
investment for these programs varies
pretty significantly. Uh
And it varies from
$16 for every
dollar spent to less
than $1 or negative
return on investment uh for
other family preservation
programs. And the
reason for this variability is,
is due to a number of factors.
Some of it is due to
the impact that the program
provides. Other factors
are due to the cost of the
program. But one of the
pieces we want you all to take away from
this slide is that the programs
that are very targeted
towards uh those
higher risk families generally have
a stronger return on investment
because the impact that they can make
is a larger
impact.
Turning to the next page
on page
26.
As Rachel mentioned,
CYFD is not fully
drawing down all of their
title four E funds that
they, that they could
potentially draw
down in
2018. The family's first
Prevention Services Act
was passed federally
and what this act did is it
allows for additional
funding for evidence-based
programming. However, New
Mexico is one of only five
states without a current approved
plan to draw down these
funds.
And then on the next couple of
slides, we're gonna talk in
depth about some programs.
Uh The first program we're gonna talk
about is alternative response or
differential response. It's on
slide 27.
And so alternative
response uh is a
different way to respond
to uh cases
or an allegation of abuse and
neglect rather than a traditional
investigation. And
this type of
response is appropriate
when child safety is not an
eminent concern. And
what happens is an
individual come into the home
and conduct a family assessment
rather than a traditional
investigation.
The goal here is to
engage families and to
look at the strengths and needs of
that family without
determining or without
requiring a determination of
whether a maltreatment
has occurred. And
uh you'll see on the right hand side of
the slide, a flow chart
that shows how
alternative responses cases go
through showing that it goes
from referrals to being
screened in uh nationally.
And then for those screened in
reports, some are investigated
in a traditional way and some are investigated
in an alternative response.
However, in New Mexico, what we've
seen in our reports
is that CFD was taking some of
those screened out cases
and using
that using those cases
for alternative response, which is
not the current
best practice. However,
CYFD is working with any
Casey to implement
alternative response in a way that
is more aligned with current
research and they can talk more about
this when they're up
here.
Moving to the next slide, we'll talk
a little bit about home,
visiting
home, visiting is a
voluntary, a voluntary
program that provides family
support and helps
teach parents uh
skills and
uh information about child
development. It can
positively impact several
child and family outcomes
including child maltreatment.
Uh One of the things I want to point
out here though is there are different
types of home visiting
models. Some models
have very large returns on
investment while others do
not. And some models have
been shown to
uh impact child maltreatment while
others have not. Uh
You can see this best on
the next slide on
slide 29 where we talk
a little bit about nurse, family
partnership and safe care versus
family connects.
Family connect is a universal
light touch home visiting program,
Meaning that any
family in a given county
could receive this service.
However, uh
it is not a service
for high-risk families.
Family connects
uh would only triage
those families. And that's one of the reasons why
it has such a low return on investment.
It doesn't mean that the program doesn't work. It's
just serving such a broad
category of individuals.
Then you move to a program like
nurse family partnership,
nurse family partnership is met
meant for families that are low
income and that may have
one or two other risk factors
such as being first-time
parents. And this has a
relatively strong return on investment
of about $10 for every dollar
spent. But it's
not for families
that uh have a
history of uh
child maltreatment. Then you'll
look at safe care,
safe care has a target
population of parents who are
either at risk or of or
have a history of child abuse and
neglect. And it has
a larger return on investment.
And it's a program that is
specifically uh meant
for uh families
that Cyfd would
touch.
Moving to our next slide slide
30. We want to highlight
some programs that Cyfd could
rele in order
to strengthen
outcomes.
So you'll see. Uh we
had talked about three different pieces.
The first is that currently CUFD
operates other family
preservation programs
that have an estimated our
return on investment of
a negative $1
for every dollar spent.
However, Cyfd could rele
homebuilders, which is an
evidence-based intensive
family preservation service that
has a positive return on
investment.
Uh CUFD has yet to
serve families with safe care,
citing workforce challenges.
However, CFD could
continue or rele
working with uh
the regional Educational
co-operative nine to begin
implementing safe care, which has
an approximate return on investment of around
$11.
Uh Previously
CFD stopped using triple
P level four around
10 years ago and has
not replaced it with an evidence-based
program. Uh
CFD could rele triple
P level four as
a prevention tool for some at risk
families. And this program has
a return investment of $9
for every dollar spent. And
so these are some suggestions that we
have in regards to programming
and we'll now turn it over to
CFD for the legis sta and
their presentations.
>> Thank you so much.
Um So what we'll do
um before diving into
the legis that is
see um if the folks
that have questions right
now, um
want to ask before
we go to legis that. So,
um I have
um flags from
Representative Armstrong,
Senator Padilla and Representative
Baca. Is there anyone Representative
Herndon?
Ok. OK.
OK.
Representative
Armstrong. >> Thank you
madam chair and thank you for the
presentation. Um
My first question
is why is
this information from
2022?
>> Um So madam,
vice chair, Representative,
um the data that you
see the 2022
child maltreatment data
is the most recent
available that is the
federal reporting.
Um And so there is, there is a
lag um in a couple
of years when it comes
to our, to
compare our state's performance
to other states because
um it comes from that federal
report.
>> OK. Thank you for that. And
then can you um tell
me I I was looking
at the on page
five
at the definition
of child abuse and neglect.
Is that definition
the same definition that New
Mexico
uses?
>> So, um
Vice Chair Dixon
Representative, this
is the definition that's
included in the federal
capta. Our
state also has
a specific definition related
to abuse and neglect.
That is not precisely
this definition. OK.
>> Thank you for
that
page. I wrote down page
numbers because I was it was
going fast. Thank you madam
chair. Uh the on
page
seven.
I'm really concerned about the
first chart,
the state
child fatality
rates
and I know if we've got
a twoyear lag, I know that
that is going to be a lot
higher than
what it is now on this
chart. And then right
next to it is some of the
reasons I think
the risk factors.
Uh, the drug abuse
is one of the
highest
factors and
still
yet
we don't have in place
um
in the car a act
to mandate that
parents get help.
I just want to point that out. We,
the writing is perfectly
on the
paper.
And then I was curious why
domestic violence was
taken out of the
data was not
included in the
data.
>> Um So madam,
vice chair representative,
I can't speak to why
our state didn't
report
beyond the, the
federal child maltreatment report
does note that sometimes
the information is hard to
collect about
caregivers when
maltreatment is reported because
for whatever reason, they have some
information about the caregiver but
may, may, may not have complete
data. I can't speak
beyond that. >> Ok.
Thank you so much.
I just think if the, if we're not
reporting it that, you know,
if we're supposed to be reporting it and
we're not, I'd like
to find out why
we're not reporting that.
Um
We have a few suggestions
on things that we could
talk about
that could be
um
uh followed, you
know, kids in therapy.
Um how quickly your kids,
um, out of office
days, some things like that. But I
think we can talk about that in
another
area. And
then
on page
25
how many of
these,
um,
programs? Does
New Mexico? Do, do they do
any of them?
>> Uh, uh,
madam chair? Yes, we
do a number of these programs.
Uh, we have alternative
response, nurse, family
partnership,
uh,
parents as teachers, other
home visiting programs, healthy families,
a and healthy families, America, as well
as other family preservation.
Uh The ones that we are
hoping to add to our state would
be uh safe care and
homebuilders potentially as well as
triple
P
>> and, and uh madam
chair. Do I I
know the a lot of these
things do different things, but
are we overlapping on any
of these? Would
we be better off doing
one than the other
or should we be doing all of
them?
>> Um Madam chair. I uh
thank you for that question.
Uh I think that there is a
reason uh to do
multiple types of
home visiting models
um because
what the
each family has its own
unique needs and the
community has its own unique needs as
well. And so you
wouldn't want to just do one
service. You'd want to do it
plethora of services. So there's a
suite of options for
both the family and the providers
to choose from. >> Thank
you for that. And thank you madam chair
and, and so I know with home
visiting, we've been doing a lot of
investing in home visiting, but
our actual, our numbers are
really down and
we're putting a lot of money into
it. So is there
um I noticed this
triple P level four is
something that you all were
recommending uh
that we did away with
10 years ago, but we haven't
really replaced that.
And can you
tell me what triple P level
four
is
um just in a roundabout
way? >> Yeah. So
I'll kind of, I can talk broadly
about what triple P is madam chair.
I don't know if I have a lot of
specifics about what level four is
exactly, but triple P
has six different levels
going from universal programming
to intensive programming.
And I believe triple P level four
are for those families who are at
risk of um
removal or maltreatment.
I don't know the exact
components that are done there,
but I believe it is working with
families and I can get you more information
on that. >> Ok. Thank you for
that madam chair and, and
panel. I, I'm just
perplexed
at the,
the negative report
and how
um
I mean, we all know our kids are not.
Ok.
It's the writings on the wall,
the writings on the paper, the writings
in the data.
And I just don't know when we're
gonna
um
finally
pull up to the table and
do something about it.
I think we're all sitting at this table
wanting to do something about it and it's
up to us
to get that done. And
so I, I appreciate your
report. Um I
was just curious about a lot of those
things, what, what we actually
do and what we're not, but
um I know we're not
taking care of our kids. Thank
you madam chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Senator PTI.
>> Thank you madam chair. And
so I think both of mine are actually for the
department. So I think I'm going to wait on
mine. Thank you.
>> All right. Uh Representative
Baca, >> thank you
madam chair and thank
you,
I'm gonna refer to
slide four
please
regarding the
risk factors
and we talk about in your in your
slide there. Um You talk
about 25%
of adults have
four more of the aces
adverse childhood
experiences.
What is, what is like the trend
line of that? And how
has it been since
COVID has
that had an impact? And we see
because we just have 25%
but we talk about
10 years ago. Was it at
18%
or I I would
be interested madam chair to hear about
how that has increased
and what impact COVID has
had.
>> Madam chair
representative. We
can follow up with that data.
This comes from Doh and I
imagine we could collect them over
time to paint a picture of
how aces have
trended though. I don't have that
today so we
can follow up there >> and thank
you and and madam
chair and thank you for this because
you know, as we set up here,
um when
we're looking at, we, we get these
numbers and these numbers, you
know, float around, but
it's really, you talk about the
numbers and you talk about the story
behind the numbers
and those are what are important
for us whether through
appropriation or legislation
to as dark as a representative
Armstrong says, we
need to make a difference, we need to quit
giving lip service to this.
And so, but in order for
us to do that madam chair, I I
do believe that we need to
look in to a
deeper dive into that at.
Um
Thank you madam chair and
see.
Slide number
um slide number
nine
CFD Protective
Services Workforce. You, you,
you did talk about the high
percentage but
madam chair, what I would
also, what
were some of the reasons were
these people that were questioned
for them leaving the department? I
mean, what was the
reasons for the high turnover
madam chair?
>> Um So madam
chair, Representative
um CFD did
conduct a workforce
study several years
ago um as
part of the the Kevin
settlement and corrective action
plan that identified
a few areas, things like
high stress, high burnout
need for support and
things like that.
Um I would
point to the department as
potentially an opportunity for you
all to explore more
about um reasons
driving high turnover
and what they
know.
>> Thank you, madam chair. The that's
my questions will be for the department
itself.
Uh Representative
>> Herndon.
Thank you madam chair
and thank you presenters.
My first question has
to do with child
maltreatment and neglect
and when we look at this
uh statistic.
Can you please uh
tell me if we have
the data about what
was causing this maltreatment
and neglect? Was it that there
was lack of, of money in the
family? Lack of food?
Was there behavioral
health problems with
respect to the, the
adults? Do you have
that data? And where can we
find it if you don't have it with you
today? >> So
madam chair representative,
that might be a place
where could go a little
bit deeper in the data. What we're
able to report is the way that
we report to the federal government,
which is that broad
category for
neglect. >> And
thank you and madam chair and
presenters you, we talked about
Children in foster
care and a
lot of times that we
saw maltreatment
and drug abuse being
a a contributing
factor to their maltreatment.
But my question to you,
what happens and who's
responsible for the
plan when those Children
age out of foster
care? Because too many of
them are homeless, they don't
have jobs and then they don't have a
family to go back to. Is
that Cys D's
responsibility
or whose is
it?
>> Um So madam
chair representative
um uh statute
does allow for the provision
of extended foster care
and some support for those young
adults. Um
Senator Padilla, you were
very involved in that fostering
connections uh legislation.
And so there is some,
some uh support
and planning that CYFD
provides to youth aging
out um that number is
relatively small compared to the
overall number. And I
imagine CUFD could speak
further to the ways in which youth
are supported as they're aging out
of the system. >> Madam
chair. I mean, thank you madam
chair present. I'm not sure I understand
with you. Your answer,
the numbers rather small.
You mean the Children aging out
of foster care who are
homeless? >> Oh, I
apologize
madam chair representative.
So this state get
is a couple of years old
but roughly 80
to 90 young people
aged out of the system,
I cannot connect
that number to how
many then become homeless.
Precisely though nationally,
there is a strong connection
and the risk factors are
high in terms of youth who age out of
foster care and then ultimately
become
homeless.
>> Chair. Would you be willing to do it on that
point?
So I just wanted to say
that in the Fostering Connections
Program, as I understand it
about 250 to 300
actually age out. I think it's
every year they don't have
to participate in the
Fostering Connections program, madam
chair and Representative Herndon.
But if we capture them right at
16 and start
putting the plan together on
what it's going to be like for them at
18, then those are
the ones that we see very
successfully work their way through
it. Housing transportation,
health care, help with
the judicial system to,
you know, corrective action system. If they
need it, understanding,
credit, higher education,
all of those things.
But if they don't, then that's where
your homeless serious
issue comes from on
aged out foster youth.
So I just wanted to toss that out there. Thank
you madam chair. >> Thank
you madam chair and thank you mister
on that point. But I
just have one question for
you. Are you saying that it's
the state's responsibility
to put forth the plan?
And I just asked because we just
opened up a, a homeless
shelter for
students or kids
aging out of foster care. And
that was quite disturbing.
>> Uh Well, on
that, to respond to that, on
that point, madam chair and Representative
Herndon, it is the
state's responsibility to put the
plan together if the child
chooses to participate.
It, it's, it's
a but they have to start doing that at the age
of 16. We have a small
fix that has to happen which
we did through executive order this
year, we've had the White House come in
for that fix to
capture a few of the kids that were
being, they didn't have their
plan fully adjudicated or
they were being fostered in another
state. So you have
a whole slew of things that will
continue to get better with this
program, but it has to be
further adopted and accepted by
the youth that you know, that
they want to put their plan together
at 16.
Thank you. I know that was a long
I can take it offline
madam chair with her and there's other
services I'm aware of that can help in this
area. >> Thank you madam
chair and thank you very much for that
explanation. And madam
presenter, one
last question is respect
to the page
26 and
the information we
make sure that that is the correct
page.
It is and
it talks about uh to
date 46
states have submitted plans
under title
four E
and uh New Mexico is
one of five plans that's not
yet approved. So I
presume that there's feedback
on why our plan has not been
approved. And
so how long has our plan
not been approved? And
um where is
that feedback and who's
responsible?
>> Um So madam chair
representative, I believe
our plan was submitted in September
of 2022
initially um
under a previous
secretary. So if he
has received some
feedback and I imagine they could
speak to what precisely that
was and kind of the path forward
to resubmitting.
Um and responding to that
feedback, our understanding
is it falls into two categories.
If you look on the slide title,
40 Families First Prevention
does narrow the target
population for services
to for example, a
child who is a
candidate for foster care.
So there is sort of a narrow targeted
focus here and the second
area is for
approved program. So
under title 40
the Families First Prevention
Act, there is a clearing
house developed by the
federal government that has identified
evidence based programs,
many of which you heard about
today that this the
federal government has noted they
will pay for. So those
two categories, population
and program um are
the two areas for potential
feedback. >> OK.
And just for clarification,
madam chair and madam presenter,
the person ultimately
responsible for clearing
those items. When uh
for a plan that has not
been approved is that the
secretariat every each
one of these years and this is
2024 we're getting ready to go
to 2025 and
I'm just asking for
clarification in terms
of where that responsibility
lies. And >> so
madam chair representative,
it is the child welfare
agency's
responsibility.
So um led
by a secretary.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative Herndon.
Uh Next we have Representative
Garcia then Representative
Garrett. Uh and finally
Senator Shair,
>> thank you madam chair.
This question would be probably for the
It lady, you know,
on page 19 and
it's, it's got here
the investment new Mexico
Impact project.
OK. And it
it goes on to see what is
good for what's it doing.
But if you look down on
it it
started in 2017
and it an estimated uh
$36
million and it
went to 2022.
Now
that now the new project is estimated
to be completed in
2027 and cost
82 million.
The project doubled plus
10 million.
Why, why
so much on doubling
it plus the 10 million?
And why is it, why is it taking
so long?
>> Sure madam chair
representative um
to refer back to the
it in depth packet
that is behind the legist
packet.
Um There is more information
on that, but historically, there were
procurement strategies
with the previous it
vendor Benti.
Um And
so there
were a little complications
that caused delays in the project.
So that's why we're seeing the end date now
being in 2027
as opposed to the initial
2022
and dates. Um
And so if you turn to page three of that,
it in depth that has more
information of like the extensive
history behind the project
specifically with
Binti. Uh
But there were
some
delays. So for example,
on page three, uh
CFD sent around 7
million in general fund dollars
to Binti modules, but they
were not approved federally.
So these expenses that
were paid out um
because they weren't federally
approved, they were
sort of just
unconsidered from the project
if that makes sense. And so there
was funding that was spent
for the CW
project because it wasn't approved
federally. Um
that added on to the project
costs. And so because there were delays
that were not approved federally for
spending,
um,
that is why there is the current
delay and the expected
increase in costs that
we are seeing. Now. If that helps
answer your question, I could
probably explain it a little bit better
if that didn't make too much sense.
>> Madam chair. Actually, it doesn't,
it, the
problem we're having here
that these kids are
suffering and we're losing
kids
for what's happening with this
deal here. You
know, now you're telling me the federal is
not funding it. Why are
we even, why do we, why do
we have this in front of
us if we don't know what
the federal is not doing or is
doing? In other
words, what this is telling
me this is to, to
better the lives of
these kids.
Now we got to wait to 2027
to, to
uh get to where we
want to go. Is that what you're saying?
>> Not exactly. Uh
madam chair representative, if you
look at page four, there's the
budget history of how much was
from the state versus federal
funding. So during the time
when CYFD was contracted
with Binti,
um Rachel could help
explain this better than I can,
but CYFD
through HC A through
HSD, they
submit um
sort of project requests
federally um
to add project
scope and costs. And
so that wasn't
quite done
correctly. And
um in the past,
but there is still federal money
being realized for this
project.
Um
If that is
what your question is surrounding
>> madam chair,
what you just finished saying it wasn't
done quite correctly in the past.
What do you mean by in the past?
Are we passing the bug to somebody
else? Is that what we're
doing?
If you could explain that because
you just finished saying
it wasn't quite done
correctly in the past.
And to me, you're passing
the buck to somebody else.
That's what it seems like to
me,
>> um
chair representative, um
this has been resolved.
So um in the past
CYFD was contracted
with this vendor called Binti.
Um but because they were
required to undergo
a competitive procurement process
for all contracts to be able
to be considered for federal
cost sharing. There
were delays to these contract
approvals which caused significant
delays in the project.
Um Cyfd is currently not
contracted with this
vendor Binti.
Um The issues have
since been resolved.
Um And I know that this is something
that the current it project is
trying to avoid with
procurement strategies in
the future. Um
So there's no more delays
to be
expected,
>> ok? With that, you know,
I'm not going to drag it on because
there's a lot of questions, you know,
because CD has a lot of
problems and, you know,
and you just passed back to somebody
else and now we're going to
wait 2027 for completion,
right? Is that what we're doing?
>> That is when they are expected to
complete. Yes,
>> with that being said, you
just came back on what
the first question was, it
was supposed to be completed in
2022. Now,
we're hoping it's complete
in 2027. I correct.
That >> is correct. Yes. >> Thank
you. Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you representative.
Um, and
it does, um, the
um, it report
um is behind
the legis that
pages
in the binder.
And I noticed that
um there
are a couple
of
bolded statements
that help provide
additional context
to the delays
and cost overruns.
Um So
members can
take a look at
that, you know, when you have
time. Um
OK. Representative
Garrett, >> thank you madam
chair. Thank you for being here
everybody. Um
This question may be for
part two. It was about the
alternative response
differential
uh response. It, I
just realized it's in the legis
more extensively, would that be
appropriate to ask
in the next section?
And
ok, thank you. And then
madam chair one quick question
regarding it.
Um There's
an effort
to fund that's already
started
statewide looking at data
governance and
data sharing out of
icos in MS U. Has
CYFD been
involved in
that?
Great, thank you. That's
it.
>> Great. Um
Senator Chair and then
we'll go back to Senator
Paia for a quick
comment question.
>> So thank you madam
chair. So on,
on page eight, where
it talks about the foster care
trends.
So
the Children in care
has increased by 300
or more,
but the actual foster
families, while
almost the same has decreased
a little bit. Is there
anything, are there any
roadblocks that are keeping
people from becoming a
foster
family?
>> Um Madam chair,
Senator Chair, I think that
would be a great question for
CYFD in terms
of what they're seeing in terms of
roadblocks for becoming foster
parents. Because the data you mentioned
are the trends we're
seeing.
>> Great Senator Padilla
and then over to
Representative >> Figueroa. Thank
you madam chair and I'll be really,
really fast if at
all. So on the the
implementation of CWS,
did you say that it's already
10 years
behind?
>> Originally
chair, Senator
thesis project started in November
2017 and is expected
to complete in 2027
in November. So it's, that's
10 years originally, it
was planned to end in
October 22. So that
was five years from the initial start
date. >> Ok. So madam
chair then. So I'm
sorry one more time, who
was the company responsible
for holding this thing up this
long? >> Sure, that
was in part um Chair
Senator with um
their previous vendor
Binti. There are also two.
It's in the um
it and depth sea whiz
is also um
related to the Medicaid
Information Management System
and delays to that project also
cause delay to see whiz.
And so um there's
kind of like this,
there's multiple things going
on at once. So it was partly because
of Binti and federal
delays and
procurement strategies
but also delays to a
separate it project that
was is dependent
on. >> So madam
chair,
who owns it right now
and are there penalties for
not achieving this
revised
timeline?
>> Chair, Senator,
>> the implementation, madam to
apologize, who owns the
implementation right now? And
are there penalties to that
contract if they
don't? And if you don't want to answer that
part, that's fine if somebody else
can, but you're welcome to you can.
>> I'm not too sure if there are
penalties, I can definitely look
into that and get back to you.
But currently CYFD is
contracted with
three different
contractors. And so they have their
third party contractor
for their IV and V, their
independent verification and
validation, which is
respect. They are also
contracted with CSG
Government Solutions and also
Red Main Solutions. And so
Redmain I believe
is more responsible for their
deliverables in their
project management.
>> Thank you madam chair. So just
my last question is I would like to
know at some point if there are penalties
for holding this thing up, there
was the epics implementation
before this, which
I had to write a very,
I was chairing Science and Technology
at the time and I had to write
a letter to the former governor on on an
eight year delay there.
This is just really
remarkable
that we're not just, you know,
firing somebody.
I mean, it just certainly wouldn't fly
in, you know, any other environment.
So I we need to find out what's
going on here. Thank you.
And then madam, I do have questions
for the department. Thanks.
>> Thank you, Representative
Figueroa. >> Thank
you madam chair. I really thought
someone else would ask these
questions. Can
you give uh just
a quick overview of
how the budget is divided
between the four service areas.
What percentage of the
budget does
juvenile justice facilities
get protective services,
behavioral health and
then program
support?
>> Right,
madam chair
representative, is it ok if I just
give you the hard numbers and
I get nervous to
percentage.
Ok? Um so
overall I'm
gonna read you fy 24
overall. Fy
24 operating budget was
384.5
million
juvenile justice
within that
was
81
million
Protective
Services.
Uh was 226.8
million
and behavioral
health um was
54.5
million. Oh, I'm sorry and program
support was
a total of
21.95.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank
you for having that with you. I really
appreciate it. Has there
been any discussion about
whether that
proportional division of the
budget is appropriate? Is
it getting the results that we
need? Um
That's a broad
question and maybe it, it
goes more to the department.
>> Um Madam chair
representative, I imagine that is a
really deep conversation that we
have during the budget season
for fy 25.
Um the LFC
recommendation was to maintain
a flat operating budget
um as the department was
considering reorganizations,
but um
we sort of weren't
certain where
um the money would be
needed and, and so
instead maintained a flat
operating budget, but that's
a conversation for budget
development.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam chair.
My last question is about
page five. You said
the national average
is 74%
for neglect, that
74% of
maltreatment is neglect.
But in New Mexico, it's only
two thirds and that
actually is significantly
different. So I'm wondering
if we are targeting our
strategies
differently because our
maltreatment seems
to be the more intensive
kind and a little
lower on neglect
than the national
average
>> madam chair representative.
That might also be a question
for the department, what I will not
states do have
in their own statute,
different definitions of
neglect in particular. And
so that may contribute to some of the
variants we see across
states.
>> Great, thank you. Um
So I just have one
question and then um
I think most of my other
questions um
will fall
within the uh
legis that section.
Um And so
the only question that I have right
now um is about the
timeline
for the
data
implementation, the
IT program. And I'm
just wondering
if we could figure
out how long it took
in other states.
Um If this is an
anomaly, I'm
just curious if
you know, and you could get back to
us
>> chair, I can definitely get back
to you um to my
knowledge, only one state has fully
implemented AC W I system
and that is Idaho. Otherwise,
I do not believe that any other
state has
implemented the CW I
system also too. Um I
believe it is on page
four. The increase
in cost is also not just
specific to New Mexico but
seems to be a national
trend. And so it's not
just specific to New Mexico,
the um AC F
projected a cost of
65 million but other states
have projected higher
costs which the AC F
has not yet
um
has not yet to uh
states have failed to
provide additional cost estimates
to verify this claim. So AC F
has not altered its estimate
though other states do
have um higher
costs.
>> Thank you.
Great. Um
On to the legis
that
yeah, um
Rach Rachel,
will you um you'll
kick off the legis sta and
introduce um
everyone. Thank
you
this,
I'm sure.
>> Right. So I'll start by
introducing um the
other, the members of
the Cyft team at the
table framing the
big performance challenges that
we've set up for legis that and
then turn it over to
CYFD. So
um with me at the table, we have
Secretary Teresa
Casados, Deputy Secretary
Valerie Sandoval and
Deputy Secretary Kathy
Phoenix Doyle from the
CYFD.
Um For this interim,
we'll be focused on three
performance challenges every
time we have the child welfare
sub-committee. So those
key challenges
are um
reducing maltreatment
and repeat maltreatment. What do
we do about that
workforce? How do
we recruit and retain
a professional um
workforce, particularly
within protective services?
And then the third is how do we
ensure sufficient
um placements
for you in protective
services custody? So,
we have asked CYFD
to talk through what are the key
actions that
they're taking related to those
performance challenges?
Um You have this legis that
brief that goes deeper into the
data and some summary of the
history that got us here.
Um But I will turn it over
to CYFD to talk through
the key actions and
then note for you all at the very
back of that legis that brief
are some potential questions
you all might
explore
>> for members. The questions are
on page
nine.
Thank you. >> Thank you, madam,
vice chair members of the committee.
Um Rachel, thank you very much
for getting us started. But
before we start talking about the
issues in legis that I wonder if I
can just take a quick minute to
update you on where we are
on CW because I know there's
a lot of conversation and a lot of
interest in that. So,
um as they mentioned, it was
procured. Um you know, funding
was received in
17.
Um I think
I can't speak to the prior administration
or what they did to move that
contract forward. Um But
I know back in 2019,
there was conversation with
Benti with Secretary
Blalock. Um
and that moved forward for about a
year and a half. Um as they
said it wasn't a federally approved
program. And so that kind
of stalled that project
when I came on last
year in May.
Um There had not been
a contract entered into
with respect to CIS.
So they were in conversations
at that point, they had issued an
RFP, but it had not
yet been awarded
although there had been a
selection. So
we started moving towards a
contract. Um probably
June of last year
and I would say probably
August time frame, it was
discovered that it didn't include
the entire agency. It
was just protective
services. And
if we're going to function as an
agency and work well, there are
some crossover kids in juvenile
justice. We want to be able
to capture that data
and work with a full set of kids
that we serve. So I put a
slight pause, I love that
word pause. I put a
pause on the contract
at that point in time. So
we could include juvenile
justice and have it serving the
entire agency including behavioral
health. So a contract
was awarded
um I believe
it was November
time frame um
with Red Main
and the contract
does have an end date
of November 25.
Um So the work should be
done in a little over a
year from now. There are
penalties if we don't meet that
timeline. Um There
has been some back and forth
on that contract, but, you
know, I feel like we have a great working
relationship. Um We have
Joseph Botos from D
fa who's managing that project
for us and keeping it on
time. Um
And um I think it's
going incredibly well
in the time frame that we've allowed
for. So it's not
27 it is 25.
So I just wanted to make
sure um and give you guys
kind of that background and where we are
on the CS project.
So, all right. So
now we'll talk unless anybody has any
questions, I'll move on to
where we are on.
No. Ok, great. Thank you.
Thanks for the opportunity. And I
just wanted to introduce a couple more
people of my staff. Um
I have with me um Cindy
Montoya, who's my, a SD
director and
Justin
Boyd, um who
is my general counsel
and their information is in
your powerpoint um with their
contact information. So,
feel free after today if
you have additional questions or
want more information about what
we're doing to reach out to any of
the leadership staff that's listed in
that.
Um
So I think, you know,
prioritizing um child
welfare in New Mexico
as we're finding out is
really, you know, a largely
more than just
CYFD
um responsibility,
right. There are other agencies
that we're working really closely
with to really try
to figure out how do we make
our system in New Mexico
a system that works for
families that protects
Children and allows
families to thrive across the
state. I think it's
critical and it's one of the
reasons why we were really
um interested in starting our
family services department,
which we will talk about.
Um you know, but there's
overwhelming evidence
that attests to the fact
that, you know,
Children
in a well functioning
family will grow up
to be well functioning adults.
And that's really what we need to
make sure that we're doing is providing
them that opportunity
to have that background
and that stability as
youth, whether that
be in home
with services, whether
that be in a foster family
or, you know, where we're working on
reunification, or
if a decision is made, that
reunification is not
possible, getting them
into that stable environment
early on and not letting
that, you know, lag
within um the systems
and leaving them in foster care
for many years, which
is something that we have seen
done in the past where we have
kids that have been in foster
care for 8,
10 years. And so it's
really something that we're looking at
as a department to figure
out how do we change that
dynamic and really
provide them the services that they
need. So with
respect to our foster
families. Um and on
slide seven, I think
of your packet,
um we currently
have 1042
foster families.
And as um Rachel pointed
out, those numbers
have remained steady
and it seems like we start to
make progress in recruiting new
foster families. As it shows
here, we've had 16 new
foster families within the last
60 days. Our goal
right now was to try to get 10
per month. So we're short
of that in 60 days.
Um but, you know, working
towards that effort,
but we're also continuing
to lose foster families,
you know, for various reasons
some of those adopt and
that is it, you know, then
they're not continuing to foster.
Some of them are foster families
for relatives.
And once they get in that relative
placement, they're not doing any
fostering outside of that. And
then they do, you know, they're no longer
considered an active foster
family. This
1042 is
those of those who have taken a
child within the
last year. So if they
are inactive, we're
not them in the numbers
of what we count as foster
families. Um We
have a large number
of relative foster placements
in New Mexico. So
615
of the um we
have 2030 kids
currently in foster in state
custody.
615 of
those are in relative placements.
So we're over 50%
of relative placements.
But as I said, many of those
then don't take other foster
Children, some of them are duly
licensed and you do have
a sheet in your packet.
That really kind of does that
breakdown? It shows you the
jewelry license, the
non-relative homes, the
relative homes and then
how many beds, each of
those houses are licensed
for
so many of them take
dual, you
know, if it's a family group, they'll
take those Children into
one household. And so
we have a total
of
2061
beds statewide that are
available to us.
So the question is
if we have 2000
beds and
1000
2000 beds statewide
and less than that of kids
in custody, you know, why do
we continue to still have
office days?
And I think one of the things that we're
really focusing on in our
recruitment efforts
is making sure that we're
finding the right families,
those that can meet the
needs of some of the kids that
have, you know, a higher
acuity or different
needs that we're not
really reaching right
now. And so one
of our main focuses that we're
doing right now is to
recruit um
foster plus
is kind of what we're
doing. And so that are
families that have the
ability to work with
kids with higher acute needs.
And that's something where
we will be paying those
families a higher stipend
every month to deal with,
with those issues. Um
And so trying to
recruit those has been
a challenging effort, but
we have established
individuals in five of our
counties where we have high
need that are specifically
just going to be that
recruitment and trying to
match those needs of
those individuals with
families and work
towards meeting those um
foster plus
recruitments. Um
A lot of times that is part of the
reason why we have kids out of
state, you know, we're not
able in state to meet
those needs and then once they're
released from out of state from
whatever treatment that they needed
and they come back, we
don't have the ability
to get them into a proper
placement. And oftentimes
those individuals end up in our
offices, which is absolutely
not the right answer for them,
it sets them back and then we're
back into out of state
placement. And so that's
an effort that we're really focusing on
right now to try to reach those
individuals. Um
You know, I think part of the problem
that we have with retaining
foster families is
once we get kids in there
and we start to become so
desperate for placement,
we continue to push or
not listen when they're saying, you know, I
can't take another child
or that's not the right child
for me, we're kind of like we'll just try
it right. And we need
to, you know, do better job of
training those foster families that we
do have and a better
job of really listening to what their
needs are and working with them
to um
fulfill the training
that they're requesting or the
type of individual that they
need. You know. And
so um a lot
oftentimes it's really hard for us
when we have family units
because we really want to try to keep
those kids together and
you may have a foster family
who only wants younger
kids. And, you know, we're kind of like,
well, this is a younger kid
but it has an older sibling.
And so really trying to make
sure that we're maintaining that
sibling group in those
homes is something that really
um sometimes can be really
challenging for us in foster
families.
Um
So I think those are the efforts
that we're making. We have
individuals in each
county that are also
responsible for
just conducting
um resource
events to try to foster
families. So we've done
just since January
through now, we've done 100 and
24 events that we've
completed in different
regions. And on slide eight, it
shows you those regions and
how many we've done, we
have 36 scheduled
events coming up.
Um But we're also looking
to see, I mean, we've done
100 and 24
events and
from those events,
we've had 19
inquiries.
So looking
at is that the right
type of event to continue to
have and use our resources
for because we're not
getting the return on the investment
for sending staff out for those
types of events. So
really looking with partnering
with um community to
determine what is the right
event for your community
and how do we continue to
recruit there? We
had two pilot projects
through the Kevin S litigation
that was specific to
look at fostering
um families and
recruitment. Um One
was in Dona Ana, one was in
Farmington. Um I
think we got some really
good um
recommendations from
them on, you know, just in
those communities and what we could
do, we did partner
with San Juan to do an
event up there with some of
the people from the
um
task force.
Um I don't yet have
results of what that look
like, but I think partnering
with communities
and really targeting that
community event
for that community is I
think gonna be more
um of a
better return on investment
for us with
that. One of the
issues that we talked about was
office stays. Um
and really trying to figure
out what that looks like.
And I think as Rachel pointed
out, it's really important for
kids to be in a home
environment. Um not
in a community setting,
but I also think it's really
important for kids not to
be in offices and
with our staff working
overnight with them and then
expected to come back in and do their
job. So we did
open a multis
service home in Albuquerque
AMI Kids is the
provider. Um It
opened officially in
May and we've been transitioning
office days to that
location. It is
for males
age 12 and
over. Um
And at this point in time, we
have about 22
office days on a regular
basis that includes
uh males, females and
kids under the age of
12. So I
don't necessarily consider
those under the age of 12
that are at our receiving center
as an office stay.
Um You know, the receiving
center was designed to be
able to bring kids in
to keep them there while they find
appropriate placement for
them. Um If
any of you haven't toured the receiving
center, I'd love to invite you to do that.
There are some photos of it
in your packet. Um
It's a very welcoming
environment with staff
24 7. Um
It has outdoor recreation.
We were able to just
secure a 15
passenger bus from
um homeland Security
that they had purchased during the
fires to transport
um individuals. And so
that is now at the receiving
center so that they can take
those youth. Um We
took them most recently to a fishing
event that was held a couple of
weeks ago. They've had trips to
the zoo, they've gone to the
movie. Um So it gives
them the opportunity to get those kids
out, which they really didn't have
before. Um
But outside of the youth, the
receiving center, um we
have the capacity
now at the new AMI facility
for 12
youth, we've transitioned,
I believe five,
we have nine youth that
will be staying there right now that
are eligible. We're doing
it very slowly and methodically
so that they have opportunity
to transition them
in work with them before we
bring in another youth
and kind of build that in as a family
like environment. There are also
pictures of the new AMI
facility in your packet
again, if any of you would like to
go and tour that facility,
um We would love to have you
come and take a look at it,
talk with them about the programming
that they've done. They've
incorporated an education
program, they've worked with a couple
of local schools. Um
They've worked with CNM to
talk about workforce programs
and training programs.
They have an on-site um
educator, they have a chef
on site. Um
They have
a nurse on site and they're doing
behavioral health services
there. They are located
in the old Girls Reintegration
Center off
of Paner
and they did some remodeling
there. So that is
our efforts right now to
end office days for
males. We're hopeful
that we can still transition them
into um
you know, private foster
homes or into
maybe toly or
independent living if they're
16 and working with
them. Um As we talked
about earlier, you know, the fostering
connections, we have
about an
86%
uptake of
individuals who are exiting
foster care
um that do sign
up for the fostering connections
program. So it's
hugely utilized.
Um You know, we do have
a bill that will be introducing this
next legislative session that
does do a fix for some of
those kids that were not
eligible based on some of
the things that Senator Padilla alluded
to earlier. Um
And so that will include
those individuals as well for
that, but that's a
huge program and we want to make
sure that those individuals are ready
to be reintegrated back
and live on their own
independently. Um
One of the things that we talked to
AMI about is you have to
do financial literacy
for these kids as part of their
curriculum so that they
are set up and ready, you
know, to be independent
and on their own if
we end up putting them into
fostering connections and move
them to independent
living. Um So
that facility I believe will be
hugely successful as we
transition some of those youth,
if we do find foster
families for them, our
hope is to transition them
there at Ami
so that they feel comfortable and it's
not just we're taking them
and just, you know, putting them in a
home and hoping for the best.
It's really an opportunity
for them to get to know those
families, transition
with them there and
then move on into a
foster family. And
so we're looking to do the
same type of
um group home,
not a group home, but a multi
resourse home for
females. And we're in conversation
with another vendor right now to do
something for females, age 12
and above. And then any
kids 12 and
under will be residing
at the Foster at the
resource um
center while we
continue to find appropriate
placement for that.
So that's our hope to
be able to alleviate office
stay for right now. I
think that that will be
really beneficial for the
kids that we're serving, but
also beneficial for the staff
who's been working
those, you know, nights
and weekends and holidays
to maintain um the
space for those kids.
Um There,
we've had lots of
recruitment efforts and as Rachel
said earlier, you know, our
numbers are improving,
I think um we are
seeing more
hires in protective
services over the last
year, but we're also
seeing our
um
turnover rate decrease,
which is a really good thing for
them
because it does take
about six months
to get a worker up to
speed before they can carry a full
caseload. And so, you
know, that's one of the struggles that we
have with
respect to the Kevin S requirements
is, and I'll talk a little bit
about, you know, lowering the
caseloads for workers,
but just hiring people
doesn't equate to less
caseloads because we've really got to
get them up to speed.
And the last thing that we want to do is
just hire a new worker and
then give them a full caseload
and then within two or three
months they're gone and we see
more turnover. So
we're really being deliberate
about slowly integrating
them into the job as opposed
to just a warm body
and handing off a full
caseload.
Um And so you
also have in your packet
information about the recruitment
events that we've done over
the last year. Um We've
done just since January,
we've done 100 and
24 recruitment
efforts with universities
with high schools.
Um you know, just in different
areas and you have that on
here um that you can
kind of take a look at and see
the efforts that we're making.
We did um plan
to do some out of state
recruitment.
Um But as Rachel
alluded to earlier with some of the
financial issues that we're
looking at, um we
kind of put that on hold
because we didn't want to recruit a bunch
of people that we didn't have
funding to pay for.
And so um we can talk
a little bit, I'll go into that
in more detail, but these are
the events that we've done just
since January
1 of the other things that we're
doing to really build, our
workforce is kind of a
build your own.
And that is we've entered
into an agreement with Department of
Workforce Solutions for a pre
apprentice program. So
they're targeting youth that are in
their first year of college
that are considering
maybe social work or
early childhood to
really kind of introduce
them to the Cyfd world
so they can understand what that work
is and what it looks like and
see if they have any interest in
that. And so we're bringing them in as a
pre apprentice, they're
paying for 420
hours. We're matching
that for an additional 420
hours. Um, and
they are working as caseworkers,
they're working in the receiving center,
they're shadowing some of the
investigators
or um permanency
placement workers to
really see if this is something that
they would be
interested in pursuing. And our
hope is that it is.
And then as they go into their
next year of college, we can roll
them into the Stipend program,
which then gives them two years
on the Stipend program with
CYFD and then
upon graduation, then we
would try to keep them with
the promise of loan repayment.
So it's really a way for us to
build social
workers which I know are critical
for what we're doing. Um
and kind of foster
them through that whole
process with the hopes
that by the time we get through
all of those different steps,
they will be so hooked at
CYFD that there will be no
other
interest for them outside
of the department and then they will
continue to work with us.
And so that's something that we've
started. I think we have
eight, I think
three apprentices right now
with us. Um working.
Um It's the first cohort
that we've had. And so um
they're coming up almost
to the end of their 1st
420 hours
and so we'll assess, see
how that's going, see if they really have
that interest and then continue
with the next 420.
So that's one of the things that we're
working on to
improve and enhance
our workforce.
Um
So I think those are the
efforts that we've done. Did I miss any
of our workforce?
I don't think
so.
Alright. So
um
we go on again
as I said, we are reducing
our turnover rate, which I think is
really huge in the work that we're
doing.
Um
I did talk about stipends today.
Ok. So our stipend student
as in addition to those that
we're doing through the pre apprentice,
um this last academic
year, we had 33
stipend students um
that were working with
CYFD. We
have 15 stipend
students signed up for August
of 2024
and we're continuing to work with
the local colleges that have social
work programs to
increase the number of stipend
students that we have.
And then I mentioned the loan
repayment. We have
the $3 million that
was authorized by the legislature
for recruitment efforts
that was reauthorized in this
last legislative session.
We are looking to go
to um schools of social
work in neighboring
states um to
see if we can recruit
um outside of New Mexico
as well as what we're doing
with our local colleges with
recruitment efforts.
Um
And as I said, you have a list
of the job fairs that we've
done this last, this
fiscal year just since January,
we'll continue to do those
at local colleges at
high schools. Um
Partnering with Department of Workforce
Solutions in additional
um job fairs. Um
And just working on
creative ways to
recruit individuals
into New
Mexico. Um
One of the other strategies that
we're using in addition to Exit
Interviews and we
provided to you guys.
Um the most
recent report that
we have um it's a
cumulation of last year's
data from Exit Interviews.
Um And so we've given that to you
that just give as an idea of why
people have left
CYFD. Um
I was hoping to have the first
quarter results but we don't
have them yet put together. Um
But happy to provide that to you
as that report is done, that will
show this first quarter
as to why people are leaving
CYFD.
Um In addition to that,
we're doing stay interviews
um and Department of Workforce Solutions
is conducting those for us as
well to really find out
for those people who are staying
to work at CYFD.
Um to get a better idea
of why, what do you
like about CYFD? What
are we doing that works for you as
an employee so that we can
continue to do more of that,
especially in some of the counties
where you know, we're seeing
that we don't have as much
turnover versus those
where we do to really
figure out what are we doing in this
county that's, that's causing
people to stay so that
we could then maybe replicate
that in other counties where we're
seeing higher turnover rates.
And so, um, DWS
is conducting those state interviews
for us as well.
One of the biggest
issues for employees and
one of the biggest issues in the Kevin
S litigation is the caseloads
for our staff.
Many of them have
such high caseloads that they
suffer burnout and that
attributes to the high turnover
rate. So
these graphs that you
have on page 1213
and 14 of your
presentation,
really, it's a heat
map of where we are on
caseload standards.
So based on
Kevin litigation,
they gave us standards
that we are required to meet
with the total number of
caseloads per worker,
not including supervisors.
So these heat maps show
that based on
the right now that we're at the
200% caseload
standards and
you can see that a lot of those
areas are green, those
are where we're meeting those standards
within those counties. Um
There are still some where
we're not, but the goal
is 100% of the
caseload standards, for
example, in investigations,
it's 12 cases per
worker. And you
can see that we have
quite a few counties where we're
still not meeting those
standards. In order
for us based on the
caseloads that we currently
have to meet those
standards, we need an additional
59
investigators across
the state. Um,
and so that cost is
about $6.9
million just for investigations
and protective services,
um, to meet those standards,
um, for permanency,
um, we're doing a little bit
better in the 100%
which is where we're really trying to
be. We're doing really
well in the 200%.
Um In order to meet those
caseload standards, we would need
an additional 30
permanency workers
for a cost of about
$3 million
and in placement, we're doing
much better as you can see of the
200%. We're
starting to really meet those
standards with the exception
of three counties, Bernal Leo
being one of them.
Um But we need an
additional 12
employees to be able
to meet the standards that we have
set out there at a cost
of about $1.2
million. Um
So those are some of the
numbers that we need with
respect to additional
funding for
FTEs. And
in last year's legislative session,
we didn't ask for additional
FTEs, we just
asked for the funding to meet
those standards. Um
And so we'll be asking for that
again in this next legislative
session. Um so that
we can continue to do the
hiring that we need to be able
to get to those numbers.
And as we've pointed out to them,
even if I were to hire all
of those individuals, you know, this
month, we still
wouldn't see a decline
in those numbers until early
next year as those
caseworkers start getting
fully acclimated and are able
to carry a full caseload.
And so, um, you know,
it is a progression of when we
will start seeing a reduction
um in those
numbers.
Um, so I will move
on to repeat
maltreatment.
Um
I think it's really important
to understand that the work that we're
doing has
really shifted.
So as was said
earlier, you know,
CYFD was originally
started to work with
families and make sure that they were
receiving what they needed so
that they could be successful
over the years, it has
shifted to really focus
on protective services
and investigations
and foster care.
Um, and I think
that it's really important if
we're gonna reduce
maltreatment in the state of New
Mexico, we need to
really look at what is causing
that and how can
we intervene
earlier when we're not
seeing those neglect cases
turning into abuse
cases. So a high
number of our maltreatment
cases, about 50%
of them are due to neglect.
And as it was stated earlier,
you know, neglect is defined
differently in different
states.
And so it's really hard
to do a comparison to
say what is
neglect look like in New Mexico
versus other states. Some
of it have a much lower
rate, but they also
have a lot of things they don't consider
as neglect, right?
And I think there's been a lot of conversation
about poverty as
neglect. And are we, you
know, looking at that when somebody
doesn't have appropriate
housing or transportation
or um, nutrition
if they're lacking, right? Are
those really neglect cases? Or are
those cases where a family just
needs some support
and can we do that through our
family services
and give them the support that they
need? Um,
you know, even for medical
neglect, oftentimes they
just need to figure out how to get
on to the insurance or how to get
those benefits. And you know
that right now is considered
neglect and it's in our stats
as to neglect or
repeat maltreatment. And
so really looking at
and how we can,
you know, take those families out. I
know there was a lot of talk
about, you know, screened
in versus screened out.
And so, you know, some
of those cases are screened
out if it's just educational
neglect, right? If all that's
happened with that family is
a child hasn't come to school,
but there's no abuse,
then oftentimes they are
screened out. But that could
be a child who should
get screened into family
services for intervention
services. You know, we had a
case early on which is really
kind of what pushed me
towards pushing
for family services
where an individual was
referred for
educational neglect.
13 year old who hadn't
been in school for quite some
time as we dug
into that. It turned out that that
13 year old was being a
caregiver for a four
year old, four
year old sibling who the mother was
working and didn't have
child care for.
And so
we worked with E CE CD
and we got that individual into
child care. Well, then it
became a transportation issue.
Right. The mother used public
transportation, couldn't get
the child to childcare,
13 year old to school
and herself to her
job. Right. Those
are things that are easily
fixed, well, not easily but
can be fixed.
Right. That person should not
end up in the protective services
system because they are
trying to get to work
and raise their family. There should
be things that we can do
as a state to really
meet that family where they are and
provide those services
to them. So the 13
year old can go to school and the four
year old can go to daycare and the mom
can go to work and the
family can then really
begin to function and
thrive as a entire
unit. And so
those were the things that really
pushed us towards family services.
And I know we have a segment
on that later that Kathie will
really talk about what we're
doing in family services.
But those are the sort of
things that we're really
focusing on
to reduce the
repeat maltreatment,
right? We're working with
um the
communities to really determine
what is needed in your
community. And one of
the things that we're going to be doing this
fall are regional
summits across the state
to really focus in
regionally um
with those communities to
hear from providers, from elected
officials from law
enforcement. You know,
what are some of the things
you're dealing with in your
community and how
can we as a department help
to address those issues
together? Um
You know, we're starting up our family
resource centers. Our first one
is opening up in Valencia
County or it has opened
on a soft opening.
Um But we're working in Valencia
County and Dona on our family
resource centers where we
will have kind of a one
stop shop for families
to come to that are
open outside of traditional
work hours, right?
So if you're working
Monday through Friday, 8 to
5, how do you come
in and sign up for benefits?
How do you get the help that you
need? So, the family resource
centers will be open from 10 to
7 Monday through
Saturday. Um and it'll
give families an opportunity to
come in and get
benefits under one
roof. So there will
be community partners that
provide benefits, there will also
be state partners in
those locations that
will include, you know, snap
benefits, TANF benefits,
um how to sign
up for insurance benefits,
early childhood benefits
care. All of that will
be under one roof.
So families can really get
that care and not referred
to. We go over to HSD
or go over to this
building. And so really
trying to make it um
as convenient for them to
get those services that they
need under one roof.
Um And so, in addition
to those two
resource centers we have
another one that we're working
on a contract for
um in Rio Ariba
County and a
second one that we're working
on in Chavis County.
Um And so working with those
providers to get those up and
running. Um And as
I said, those will be a collaboration
with other state agencies
with the MC OS and all
of the partners to, to really
make sure that they're staffed and
that we have um people
there that can answer questions
immediately and get them
services.
Um So
that takes us to our family services
division. And I really
think that in our next segment,
that's going to be something that we're talking
about. And Kathy has a whole
presentation on
what that looks like. So
with that, um I'll
stand for questions and then
Rachel, I guess we can go into the next
segment of it. OK, I'll
stand for questions.
>> Thank you. So,
um just to be
clear, uh
we are on the
three o'clock item
on the agenda. So
this was the legis that
we have one more
section, uh which
was the four o'clock
item. Um And
uh deputy secretary is
presenting that.
So, questions for
now on
legis that
um
Yeah.
So if we have,
so I think
if a member asks
a question that's going to be answered
in the next segment, maybe just
say it's going to be answered in the
next segment. Um I think
it's fair to ask the question
um And
uh but so long as
everybody realizes that
we are just a wee bit
behind schedule.
Um And I believe
we're going to start with Representative
Armstrong. I had notes
that uh Senator Padilla
Representative Garrett
Representative Baca had
questions from before
any
others.
Ok. All right.
OK. Thank you.
>> Thank you madam chair. I get
so mad that we run out of time.
OK. This is important
stuff.
I'm not gonna, I'll just be quick,
but I have a lot of questions, but
I, I'll try to get through them.
Um So, um
thank you for your presentation
and I, I was curious on the
like the reintegration uh
features connections.
How much money
are you putting towards that?
And if an entity
is not receiving their money,
who do they complain to
and who can they go to, to
say I need money
for this?
>> Um Madam chair, Representative
Armstrong um Let me just start
off by saying I'm available anytime.
If you have lots of questions, I'd love to
sit down and answer them um
with respect to that question.
Um I don't have the exact
amount that we're putting
to reintegration
services, but we will get back to
you with that. But if they have
concerns that they're not getting their
reimbursements or their payments,
um Cindy Montoya
is the person that they should
contact for that
and her information is in your
packet, including her cell phone
and email address, which
you should feel free to share
with providers. She would love
that. >> Thank you so much.
Thank you madam chair. And
then um are,
are you reverting
money while you're
possibly cutting programs
that support Children in
offices and foster
homes? >> Um Madam
chair representative, we are not reverting
money. Um this year,
as we mentioned
earlier, protective services
is ending the year in a
deficit. And so I
just want to clarify um
that deficit has
happened significantly
over the last several years.
Um It's not that we're not
drawing down for e
funds. It's that the
amount that was budgeted
or allocated, we
is was over
budgeted. We have not drawn
down that amount of federal
funds in probably
four years and
yet that hasn't been reduced. We
continue to budget at that
amount and not
draw that down.
And so this year
rather than them moving money
around from other areas
to cover that deficit.
Um We've left it to
go into this next
legislative session so that we
fully understand what it costs
through protective services
to be able to provide the
services that we need to
do.
>> Ok, thank you for that. And
then um uh madam
chairman, uh how
many uh career
navigators have been hired
and are working with
families?
>> Um madam chair, Representative
Armstrong, I think that Kathy's
covering Kara and the next, but
we had 17
positions um
that we have advertised
for using TF funds
and then one manager and one
supervisor. I
don't think all of those have been
hired for. >> I'll wait and
ask Kathy when she
presents. Thank you. And
then at the receiving
center madam chair,
how do you
feed the Children
that you receive? And
are they in
school.
>> Um madam chair representative,
the Children, if they're of
age are in school
um
at the receiving center. And
so they participate
in whatever their local school
is, we have workers in Albuquerque
that will drive them to their
local school for the
day. Um You know, if
they're sick or if there's
issues that they have just
suffered, you know, at home and they're
just in and not
um really
ready to go back to school
yet. They will stay in the receiving
center without going to school, but for
the most part, they do participate
in school. Um If
they come from another location
to the receiving center, um
then we're doing virtual
school.
>> Thank you madam chair. And then,
and how do you feed the
Children that are there? >> Um
So at the Receiving Center,
they actually cook for the kids
on site. Um We
do get some donations from
individuals sometimes, you know, they'll
bring in pizza or they'll barbecue
for them. Um We are
putting in a new kitchen
area in one of the locations that
GSD is working on right now
for them because they don't
actually have a stove.
Um, they use either a hot
plate or an air
fryer um to prepare
those meals currently.
>> Uh Thank you for
that information. I, I just
think if we're giving free lunch
to kids, we need to
be and we're, we should be
feeding them
nutritious meals. I mean, that's
part of the whole,
uh, aces, right?
Is not good
nutrition. So I'm hoping
that that is going
to be your answer on
the, that we're going to be feeding them
nutritious meals. And >> madam
chair representative that is for
kids at the receiving Center for
those in our office days,
it's, you know, not, they don't
cook on site. So
some of them, we have, um,
vouchers from either local
restaurants or fast
food locations where they will go
and get the kids meals.
Um Some of those we have
providers outside of that,
that have set up kind of a, a
food um
meal train where they bring
meals in for the kids in
office. Stay.
>> Ok. Thank you for that. And how
about absenteeism?
Have you all madam
chair, have you all received
any reports from schools
on absenteeism?
And if so how
many, and what are
you doing about
it, >> madam chair representative.
I don't know that we've received
actual reports from schools,
but if we have not, we
should have um we
really struggle with getting
some of those older youth
to attend school. It
is a real barrier for us
in some of the office days where they
just absolutely refuse
to go to school every day.
Um And that has been
something that we really struggle
with. And so I know that
they have been setting up meetings. I
know for certain they have a meeting
coming up with Albuquerque
to really talk about what that
looks like. But um
it's a huge struggle.
>> Thank you madam chair. And,
but I'm talking about the whole
focus on absenteeism
from the, from across the
state is we're supposed
to report, the schools are supposed to
report to CYFD now
instead of
uh, whatever it was before.
And so are you getting those
reports in the school system,
>> madam chair representative. Yes, we are.
At the end of May,
you will notice when we do our
reporting, there will be a huge
spike in the number of calls
that come into sky.
Um And that is typically
because at the end of the school
year, they are reporting all
of those
absenteeism and
the increase in, you know, just
concern with kids being at
home without supervision during the
summer. So our numbers there
typically go up in the summer, but
we did receive quite a few
reports for absenteeism in the
end of May. >> Ok.
Thank you for that madam
chair and and
secretary because I I know it's
a chronic absenteeism
across the state. And
so, and we took the teeth out
of it uh for
the schools. And so I'm I'm just
really highly concerned
that the schools are being held accountable
for absenteeism
and they can't really do anything
about it. Um And
as as far as the uh
receiving center, how do
those Children
there, shower and
bathe. >> Um madam
chair representative, we have a full
bathroom with showers there at
the receiving center as well
as you know, separate bedrooms.
Um There's
you know, different areas for the
kids there, the kitchen, the TV
area. Um so
it's set up fully functional
for kids to be there overnight.
>> Ok, thank you for that. And
then um
um
on the food for
the the kids in the offices
and the staff
is the staff, are
they given a stipend for food
or the Children given a stipend
for food or are they paying for
that out of pocket?
>> Um
madam chair representative, I
believe the staff pay
for their meals out of pocket.
Um But we do have stipends
for the kids staying in the
office. As I said, we have gift
cards for them to go
and pick up food for the kids
if we're not able to cook for them.
>> OK. Thank you for all those
answers. II, I
want to elaborate more but I
know, you know that there's,
there's a lot of issues
but um
you, you, you were talking about
how you're gonna have
these uh
across New Mexico,
how people are gonna come and we're gonna
all talk about what's wrong.
In my opinion. The legislature
has said what's
wrong and how we can fix it.
And so has New Mexico
and no one's listening
um including the
governor.
So
we have given you
solutions
and the
between the governor and,
and the CYFD.
Uh you're choosing not
to implement some of
the solutions we've given
and I would hope that you would
reconsider because I think you're
gonna hear the same thing
over and over
and over. Like
I have for the
past eight years that I've been
in the legislature. Thank you, madam
chair. Thank
you,
>> Senator Pia.
Thank you madam chair and
madam secretary. I, I have to
say that I
think, you know, I beat this one like a
drum all the time
and I, I've gotten
a couple of pretty significant
pieces of legislation done to
help you, you know,
before you got there and all that and, and
now with the role that you're in now,
but this is really,
you're doing a great job. I
really want you to continue
the fight and continue
to push and continue to
lead and continue to
get angry and continue to do
everything you need with us
because you do, you're on the right path.
It's the first time I've seen all of this
data in such an
organized fashion
and you have your eye on the
right items,
uh, the air, the, these,
uh,
these
pictures or whatever you were showing us
here. Yeah, I think
they're great and everything. What I would like
to see you do though is add
maybe something on the bottom that tells
us over time. What
direction are these going in?
Because it's one thing to tell us, you know,
it's read this quarter or
whatever. But I'd like to see that it would be
getting better and better and better. And I know
you would too. So, so all of
these items, if we can add some
trendlines, so we can know exactly
what, what direction they're going
in
on the food being served at the
receiving homes. I think I've
disclosed that I grew up in this
system. I lived in the all face receiving
home for homeless Children when
it was when it was still in operation
and someone kept
donating coleslaw.
So I cannot stand
coleslaw now. So make
sure that you're not feeding
coleslaw, only feeding
coleslaw because someone
donating coleslaw, I can
I see coleslaw today and I want to punch
somebody. Ok. So,
but, but more on to serious
top,
how many do we have? How many
Children do we have in protective services
now again, was it 1042
or how many, about 2000 or
2000? And how
many
staff within
CYFD are charged
with
in any way, shape or form,
managing the relationship
and what's going on with those 2000
Children,
>> madam, chair Senator.
I believe we have
about
1400 of
our 2040
staff are within
protective services. >> So
I've asked this question in the 12
years. I've been in the Senate a couple of
times along the way. I
guess I'm just trying to wrap
my head around. Why
would anybody have these
outrageous caseloads
if you have 1400?
And I know that I'm really
simplifying this. I was having
dinner with the governor one day during the
session. I said to her,
why don't you just divide one by
the other? And it's like you can
have one
social worker
or case person to
1.3 kids.
How do we? And you
know, in the previous administration,
I did ask for this giant report
of about 27 data points,
one individual had
48 kids. How
do you even interact with that? You
know, with all 48 of them
on a, you know, on a
timely basis to actually positively
impact their lives. But
so I guess my question is and I know
there's a lot to it. There's
specialized care, there's
specialized cases and all of
that. I don't understand.
How do we have
caseworkers with
these gigantic
caseloads?
>> Um, madam chair, Senator
Paddy, I'm gonna let
um,
Deputy Sandoval take that
question,
>> madam, chair
representative. Uh put, I
mean, Senator, I'm
sorry.
Um, we have, I'm just going to
read off some numbers to you. We have
about um
60 employees
at our intake. We have
170
investigation workers.
We have 150
permanency workers.
We have about 25
in homeworkers.
Um and we have about
78
placement workers. Now
this does not include supervisors
or managers, those are just
frontline um
on the ground workers.
So >> what, what is the, what's the
ratio then on average for
the the the the
relationship with a
child
>> that would be based off
the heat map that shows that
will show exactly how many cases
are are with
those um each
worker.
>> So, so
just in addition to that, you
have to, you know, every child
will have like a
that our behavioral health
person will, you know, be involved
with a child and a
permanency worker and a
placement worker and an
investigator, right?
So all of those are dealing,
you know what I mean? They all have several
cases but each child
will have like four different
people that are involved in their
case. And >> so madam
chair and madam secretary, does
that make sense? I mean, should we
retool how it's
all designed end to end
so that there's more of a
direct
oversight, you know, to
an actual child's
life.
I'll just ask that question.
Should we redesign? How all
that's set up? Because it
seems to me like you have the head
count or a large part of
the head count that you
need, but the
ratio still seem to be rather
large for the actual direct
interaction.
>> Um Madam chair Senator
I, you know, I believe what we're trying to do
is really put a team to
wrap around the services for
that child. So, you
know, you have um
if you had just one
worker for that
child, that worker
would, you know, really have to
be a social worker and
be able to deal with their behavioral
health needs. And, you know, then
they'd have to go in and do that
investigation,
but they'd also have to then work
with the child for
finding them placement in a
foster family.
That same worker would then have
to work with the bio family on
reunification. And
you know, so I think there's
really specializations
on what each of those
do for
kind of making the
whole um as
opposed to having one person
trying to serve in all of those
roles, which sometimes are
conflicting, especially,
you know, if you're really working towards
reunification, but the foster family
is really working towards, you
know, not reunification
and maybe adoption, you start to
run into an issue where
um, you know, you're trying
to
what that looks like for that child.
And so >> madam Charles start, I know you
have a lot of, you want to keep us
moving here. But so what is the
average ratio
per, you know,
caseworker actual direct
care to
child? What is the actual
ratio on average right now?
What >> it is now or what we you
mean for? I think
it just depends and for
investigations, I think,
you know, we're at
about,
would you say 28
on an average across the
state? We're probably at about
28
investigations,
Children per investigator.
>> Ok, so then beyond the caseworker,
is there a day to day
person that's in the child's
life like a caseworker after
the investigation has occurred?
And what's that ratio do you
know? >> You know, I don't, we
will get those ratios for
you just an average across
the state? What that looks like? >> Thank
you madam chair and, and madam secretary I
think that would be good to know because
that's the day to day
and identifying this kid's in trouble,
this person, this child's, I
mean, being abused
in any way, shape or form even
sometimes in the foster home. I
mean that's, that's also
happens, right? So, so
naw I believe
the last time I checked, uh
was looking, they were
recommending a 12 to 1
ratio for the direct
caseworker care.
So I'd really like us to strive
if we're not there or if we are.
That's great. But I'd like us to strive to
get there. >> We are not
there. What is the caseworker
in Keven 15
to 1 for
that, but for a
caseworker
15 to 1 is
>> so it's in the neighborhood there.
Yeah. So the last time I
requested this data, it's been a
couple of several years. I mean,
we had, you know, again, someone
had 48 someone had
1220
22. It was all over the
place. I don't know where it is now. I'd like
to know >> it has
typically been all over the place.
Um You know, we've had, we've
struggled with backlog
cases which
really contributes to the high
caseloads that they have.
We did, you know, work diligently
at the beginning of this year
to really address some of those
backlog cases and figure out,
you know, what needed to be done
to, to move them along, whether
it be they need to be closed
or they needed to be relooked at or they
needed to be referred over to family
services. We
reduced that number from a little
over 2000
backlogged cases, I think right
now we're back up to about
600. Um
So, >> all right, thank you madam
chair. And I think, you know, I'm so shy.
I, you know, I won't call you.
I'll just wonder, no, I will
call you directly. But again,
last thing I wanted to say is
keep doing what you're
doing. II I love everything
you've got going on here. Just do
more of it. Thank you. Thank you.
We
>> will.
Thank you, Senator Representative
Garrett.
>> Thank you madam chair. Thank you
everybody with CF
uh for
doing it. Thank you
secretary. Um
three quick questions uh
following up on
Representative Armstrong.
Kids need haircuts,
clothes, pajamas
slippers. How's that
handled when they come
when they're staying at
office?
>> So we receive vouchers
that we used to pass vouchers
on to the foster families to be
able to do the clothing um
that is now included
in their monthly stipend. So they
don't have to have vouchers anymore.
Um but we do have vouchers
that we can use in the office
and so we can um use
those to get them those
necessities. Thank
>> you. Uh question
two madam chair
is um
foster home
inspections.
I two
kids from my school ended
up at that horrible home in grant
several years ago.
How often are
inspections
conducted?
>> Madam chair Representative
Garrett, they should
at least get two per month,
one from the
permanency worker who's the
worker for the child
and then once from the
placement worker who's the
worker for the foster
parent. So they
should get a visit from two
different workers every single
month. >> Well, thank
you madam, your last
question. And this,
this is a more complicated
question. So you don't have to go
deeply into it.
But of these, um,
615
relative
placements. How many are
grandparents?
Any idea? >> I
don't have an answer for that. We can
look and see if we keep that
data. Um, I'm not sure
that we do, but we'll check.
>> Thank you because madam chair, my
follow up is
all of us have
dozens and sometimes
hundreds of grandparents
caring for grandchildren
and it would
be good. And I don't
know how many of those grandparents
are actually in the system
or it's just been worked out
because their child's
overdosed or
whatever.
So I don't know if there's a way
we can collect that
data because
some of these grandparents that have on a fixed
income, they're taking care of
kids
and often some
of our kids are
youth that end up
committing crime. It's because
their grandparents
are, are challenged
so profoundly.
So if there's a way we
can get that
data,
that's what I would request.
>> Madam chair, Representative Garrett.
Yes, I think that that's
something that we really need to
look at. Um deeper. We
are working with aging and long
term services to really try to
figure out how do you reach those
grandparents? Because if they're
not involved in the system, them or
not connected with CYFD,
I'm not sure how
we, you know, make that
connection to really let them
know about what's available
for them to assist
um with raising their grandchildren.
So would love to kind of
strategize with you on that.
>> Thank you very much. That's
it.
Thank you, Representative
>> Baca.
Thank you madam
chair.
I'm gonna
start off by a couple of
questions or in a
story
to basically get to my
point.
Um Madam chair
and the panel, when
was he stopped open
in Valencia County for your
family resource
center.
>> Madam chair
representative, the
soft opening that yd
I had was
in late May
or early June. I can get the specific
date, but it was in that time
frame, they had
90 days, they got the contract,
they had 90 days to
open the doors, do the
soft opening, but they were also
hiring as they went.
Um And so that's why
we were calling it a soft opening.
They'll have more when they're
fully staffed and able to
really um
work with
families at full
speed. >> Thank
you madam chair. And the reason
I'll show my
nameplate Valencia
County. So three out of the
five legislators
are up here that represent Valencia didn't
know about
it,
which is going to lead me to my next
story.
Um Recently,
let me first preference this,
I'm gonna take a page out of the book of Senator
Sheri. I'm gonna tell a story to
get to a point
but it won't be three hours. I promise
you.
Let me start by premising
everybody in this
scenario was trying to
do the right thing for
kids.
But madam chair, I recently
wasn't called to a meeting
because I had ac YFD
worker who called the
police on a school
site
and um
what resulted of that
were
complaints.
So I had ac T
worker show up to the
school
felt that the need arose
to call the police on the
principal,
not the
family.
Are you guys aware of this
situation?
Your attorney is because he was on
it?
I don't need to, we're not gonna hash
that out. But
really what my question
is is it shows
about I was called to this
meeting and the meeting
began to go off and I was
sitting there with the, the, the
schools with
Coyfd and the
police
and we went through our introductions and I
purposely failed
or I purposely did not
disclose this
position.
And again, the the conversation
became very contentious. And then I
said, oh, I said, basically
by what power
do you have and what authority? Well,
we get it from the law from legislator. I
was like, well, by the way, I'm actually
a legislator and II, I
think that why
I tell that
story
is about the relationship.
It was very hurtful for
me madam chair
because three groups that I care
deeply about.
It's like watching your three best friends
get a fight,
you know, my support for the
schools, you know, my
support for police and
also for early childhood
and for kids.
And when we have three groups
that were sitting there and
couldn't have a conversation
about what's best for
kids. That
highlights a problem
that I think that we need to look
into deeper
because I think
that
we're talking about Child
Protective Services. We're talking about foster
families, but we
also in the same breath, talked
about early intervention and
identification
services.
So my question, madam chair
is
what types
of
programs and or
um things
have been tried by CYFD
to increase
partnerships
and communication and
collaborations with early
childhood and with public
schools,
>> madam chair, Representative
Baca I wish I could sit here and
give you a long list of
the efforts that we've made
to improve those relationships.
But I
don't think they exist. I
think, you know, one of the first
things when I came on a year ago
was really talking with law
enforcement. It wasn't even with
the schools, it was with law enforcement
about, you know, what is that
relationship look like and how
are we working together?
And it's something that we really
need to fix that
relationship. It's
not great. And
so, you know, we started having
conversations with some of the
local police departments, not
very many, but a few of
them, you know, where we were really
struggling. Um, we're
recently starting to
reage with the schools and have
those conversations. I know that
we've got one, as I said
earlier scheduled with
Albuquerque public schools.
They have a new superintendent
who's been very engaged
in the work that, you know, we're doing and
how we can partner to do things
better. Um, you know,
we've done some
outreach through the
public education department
at their superintendent meetings,
you know, to talk about that.
Um, but we're, we've
also are looking
to meet, they
may meet regularly as
superintendents on a, every
Thursday and really
getting in front of them,
um, to talk about,
you know, the challenges
and some of the things that we're doing
and some of the things that they need
from us as a partner,
um, to really understand what that
is better. And so,
um, honestly,
it's work that we need to do
a much better job
of. Um
And I can say that we haven't done much
engagement, at least under my
watch over the last year.
>> Thank you madam chair and I
will for the statement
say
whether it be in education,
in politics or
business,
the the better
the relationship, the
more we come to
a workable solution
and through that solution, through
that relationship comes commitment,
which again, I think all parties are
committed, including the
legislature.
Communication is another
big part of that. We
have to be able to talk
and understand what's going to
what, what we need, what the needs
are of each agency
and how we can help our
families. And
then collaboration,
we talk about funding,
we talk about reversions, we talk
about more money. The answer isn't always
more, the
answer is better.
And when we're talking about
this, we're talking
about sharing of information.
I'll give you an example,
madam chair
um
is really when we were talking
about and when we were beginning to
have this discussion and I became
the mediator of all
things.
What it came down to is
that the
staff, the the the
person who was there doing
the investigation
was did not feel that they could
tell the principal what
was going off. And again, I understand
that there is
certain things that would
impact an investigation that
could hurt that.
But I think that we need to
look forward and move forward
with what is it that
we have? You know, they're saying
that uh with schools,
we have FPA right, the family
education right to Privacy
Act. So we have that same responsibility
to be private about matters.
You guys also have
those but somewhere
in the middle, there needs to be some kind
of collaboration where there can
be information
shared, even confidential
that will not jeopardize
the case but
allows the school who is
also trying to protect that
kid.
Um so that they can
make better decisions because
um my last question will
be this is
what percentage would you say?
Or where do you get the majority
of your referrals
from
madam
chair,
>> madam, chair representative,
the majority of our referrals do
come from the schools.
>> So thank you madam chair. And
so that's my
point. The
most, most of your role
come from the schools,
they come from mandatory or
required reporters
and yet that's
where we have the
weakest relationships
and communications with. Do
we see? I mean, as I
said, that goes back to that
story, everybody
there was trying to do the right job for that
kid or do the right
thing.
But because of
the system or because
of past practices,
it got so bad that we
had three different complaints.
Everybody, we had a, everyone's
pointing fingers.
But I think that we have to really
sit down there and really try
to
fix the system
and fix these little measures
because we cannot
afford to lose any more
kids.
And the fact about it is the
teachers or school staff
may be your first people that
will see those types of
things. Does it have to be a teacher?
Could be a bus driver capture it doesn't
matter.
But without these lines of
communications, I don't care
how much money we throw
or give or allocate,
it's not throw,
allocate to
CYFD, it's not
going to be enough.
We have to do a better
job
of working together
because our students, our
kids are our future
and we owe them that.
Thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Bucket Representative
Herndon.
>> Thank you madam chair. And I
have a just a clarifying
question for
madam secretary. We were
talking about uh
maltreatment and, and
mistreatment of Children.
And I think if I heard
you correctly that if you
found that it was
education and they were
a child was maybe forced to stay
home and take care of a four
year old if they were 13,
that, that was screened out.
So that wasn't considered
maltreatment or
mistreatment. But is
that a policy? And
is it still the policy and
can we change it?
>> Um Madam chair Representative
Herndon, the matter wasn't
screened out, it was
investigated and there was
no um
abuse. So
it was in for neglect.
And that is what I was saying is
some of those neglect cases
when it's, that
situation
should be dealt with in family
services instead of
opening a formal investigation
and having that individual in protective
services.
>> Thank you for that
clarification.
>> Thank you uh
Senators.
>> Uh Thank you madam
chair. So I want to go back to where
I started a little while ago.
Foster care, uh
foster families
are there roadblocks? I know
you've done a whole bunch of these
meetings and you got 19 people
interested. Is there
something in law or in
regulation or
that's, that's people are
saying, yeah, I don't want to go there.
Um
>> Madam chair, I don't
believe that there's anything in
regulation
um that is
preventing individuals
from becoming foster
parents. I think that
we've discovered we have
maybe some internal
roadblocks to getting
them to that point.
Um You know, when we were
first a year ago, when we were looking
at that system, when we brought a
contractor on to really kind of
dissect what it looks like
for individuals coming
in. We were seeing that people
were inquiring
or being interested.
Um And then the time
from co contact with
the department to when we
actually engaged with
them was incredibly
long. And so a lot of
them were losing interest or,
you know, not getting that call back.
So we've changed that
process to really make sure
that we're engaging with them
early when they reach
out to us. Um One
of the other struggles that we have
is in conducting um
home studies. Um
So we have a couple of
vendors that do those for us
there. Um It
has been a really slow
process and so
that is another barrier
in getting that home study
completed for them so that
they can move forward to
licensing. So we're
looking at contracting with a
couple additional
vendors um
in doing that. And we
also have additional staff
that's doing home studies as well to
speed that process up.
So we were looking at a period
of time from when a
family actually reached out and
said there was interest to when
they actually got through the licensing
process of
about a year, wasn't about
a year. Um And that's a
long time for somebody I'm
interested in doing something and a year
later, they're finally realizing
that. And so we've tried
to shorten that process
and change our internal
policies and procedures
to remove some of those
barriers to getting
licensed. >> So madam
chair madam secretary,
what is the time frame now?
From the time I call you to the
time you say go,
what is
that?
>> About 90 days is what I'm
being told by my deputy secretary.
So
>> and so you're doing the home
inspection, you
said early? How
much is, when is that?
And what is that? I mean, what
are you looking for? I mean, because I
might be no, I'm not
letting you. >> Yeah.
So all, all of them are
required a home inspection but
I mean, there's a whole process. So they
do the engagement with us. We do
a couple of meetings, then they
start some of the training to
make sure it's really something that they want
to do. So I think
there's, you know, 15
modules of training that
they go through to
become a foster parent
and about halfway, three
quarters of the way through when it looks
like that's something that they're really interested in
doing. Then we start the home
study and that's
several different visits
to the home to interview
them to talk with. You know,
if there's other kids in the
home to talk with
extended family to really
get a feel for what that looks
like, um, through
that process. Um, and
then there's a final home
inspection. Um, right
prior to being licensed, that's
the last step.
>> And here you,
you,
um,
about two thirds
of these are, are
relatives.
Um,
is
this
my assumption with me
would be that if, if one of my
kids wasn't taking care of their
kid, I would just go
get him. I wouldn't ask
CYFD. I wouldn't do anything.
I just, ok,
you're a drug addict, move out of the
way
grandkids coming to live with
me. Uh,
and after you sober
up or whatever, then we
can talk.
But here it seems that
two thirds of, of this is
formal that you, that you're
involved.
Is there a requirement
that you be involved when
grandparents are taking care of grandchildren,
>> madam, chair Senator? No,
I think as was stated earlier,
you know, we don't know all the grandparents
who are taking care of grandchildren because a
lot of them don't come formally
through the department.
Um And that's why we, you know, they're
not taking advantage
of benefits or getting the
assistance that they need to be able
to do that. So there is
not a requirement a
grandparent can come
and, you know, step in and
take care of a grandchild, they
can themselves file
for guardianship or do
that completely on their own and
don't have to come through
CYFD. But if
there is a complaint of
abuse or neglect on that
child and the department
gets involved, and then the
grandparent says I will, you
know, be the guardian, I will take
care of them. Then that's more
of a formal setting and then they go
through that process. We do
have a different licensing
requirement for families.
It's not, you know,
the, the same as
just, you know, somebody wanting to be
a foster parent. Um,
you know, all of them do go through the
background check as well, which I
didn't mention earlier. Um
But for families,
it is a different process
and it is not the same
time frame.
>> So that leads
me and I
looking here for
are two thirds of
the Children.
Uh, you got two
thirds of the, of the
foster families or two thirds
of the Children with foster
families or
need to be, can
be, am I
doing this backwards are more
than one third.
Don't have a family and need
uh, some other
foster
situation.
I'm not sure I'm getting that out
right. >> I don't
know that it would be exactly one
third because some of them are sibling
groups that are with families.
Um That's how many foster families we
have. So some of those
family, foster homes
could have more than one
child. Um, but
I could get you the number of
how many foster kids we
have in custody that
are not with a relative
is that the number you're looking to
get?
>> So, and, and I just think
that, you know, in some cases,
we may not need a lot more foster
families because you've got
relatives. But
my guess is is that we
need more
non-relative
foster families.
And, and
since two thirds of them are,
I'm, I'm,
that's just a guess of mine.
And then the last one I had
is this and Representative
Hernan started down this
path. Uh the
transitional youth
programs.
Did we recently cut funding
for
that?
>> No, madam, chair representative.
No, we did not cut, we have not
cut funding for that program.
Um In fact, we have increased
funding for that. And I think there's
some special, um junior
money in appropriations to be
able to increase that. And
the department is looking to
work with, um, you know,
also, you know, private
partners to really
enhance that. We've had recent
conversations with somebody who's
interested in, you
know, promoting um additional
housing for youth. And
so we're looking at
um other opportunities
outside of government as
well. >> So I
was
in, in kind of a second-hand
way I was told that uh
this transitional
uh program was cut
by 25%.
>> No madam madam chair
representative, I would like
to address the 25%
because I think it's been a question that I
get asked almost everywhere I
go these days. So
we are really looking
at what our contracts
are. We want to make
sure that we're not just
continuing to
fund programs that
we funded for the last
1015 years
if they're not effective for the
kids today. So
what we've asked, um, our
contracts bureau
to do is
really kind of take a look
at all of those
contracts. Um,
as they're given to me this
year to sign, there's a new cover
sheet that really talks about
the effects of that contract. How many
kids did we serve? Was it
effective? Did any of
those kids end up? You know,
if they were incarcerated, did they
reentry or what does
that look like so that
we can have a better understanding of what those
contracts look like
the 25%
came because we were
talking about the money that
goes to falling colors.
And one of the issues that we
have with that is that we
don't know till probably
next week what
money they did not spend
on contracts. And then that
comes back to us the end
of June and there's no
way that we can get that back out
the door and appropriate
that. So what we
said was we were going to
appropriate
75%
of what they typically get
and hold back 25
while we evaluate their contract
so that we can look mid
year and see
who is expending their
dollars and how is that
going so that we can
increase their funding?
But we're not overfunding
contracts that aren't
performing. Um Because
as you guys talked about, we have
reversions every year,
um we will probably,
well, this year will help with our
deficit, but the money that
comes back, you know, in the next couple of
weeks from unspent contracts
would then typically be
reverted back into General
Fund, which is what we're trying to
avoid doing.
>> So, let me just make sure I got this right.
So I'm a contractor
and the contracts for
$100
but you're gonna, you're gonna
to pay $75
and then if I am still
performing, then I get the other
$25.
>> Yes, we will be looking at mid
year to see where those
contracts are.
Um, because as I said, we have,
if you're performing,
you're gonna get your money, mie
we're gonna increase your contract.
But if you're not performing,
we're not gonna just give you that money
and wait for it to revert. We're gonna
take what's not being
used and maybe give
it to, you know, Representative
Garcia because he has a separate
contract and he's already expended
the majority of his contract.
So we just want to have some
reserve that we are
able to move around
ourselves as we see the
need as opposed to waiting
to revert it.
>> Ok. Ok. That makes sense
to me. Are we stressing out our,
our contractors >> think we
did? >> Ok.
So that's why they're calling me and saying,
hey, what's going on? >> Yes,
because as we were
discussing it internally,
our staff heard we were
cutting contracts by 25%
and sent out information
to all of our contractors. So,
yes, there has been a bit of a
panic. >> Ok.
Can we contact them again and
say we are
chill out. Yes, or
perform one or the other.
Ok. All right. Thank
you,
Representative
>> Garcia.
Thank you madam chair.
Thank you for the presentation.
Back to what the, the
senator asked on that
25%. When,
when they enter into a
contract,
see they
$100
contract,
they have to use all that money
or how does that? Can you
explain that to me real
briefly?
>> Um Yeah, so the contracts
that go through falling colors.
Um So those go
through falling colors. They have a behavioral
health exemption and
there can be a whole slew
of providers in many
different communities that provide
services to our youth.
So if they're contracted, let's
just say to provide,
you know, at $100
per service
to child
X. But
let's just say they don't
get, you know, the number of
kids that they were expecting
to get right. So they can only bill
for the services they provide.
And so if we anticipated
they were gonna provide services
to 100 and 50 kids.
But at the end of the fiscal year, they've
only provided services to 100
and 30 kids. They can
only bill for that 130.
So the contract amount is a
ceiling and not a floor.
Um so they can only build up
to that amount, but they can't
get reimbursed for services
they don't provide.
>> Thank you for that madam chair.
Uh You know,
if they enter into a contract
for 100 and 30 kids and,
and their budget is they're
budgeted for
100 and 50 kids
and they have supplies for all these
kids and stuff and all of a sudden
the state doesn't provide them with
100 and 50 only have 100 and
30. What happens to
what the expenditures they
had
to be prepared
for this? 100 and 50 kids,
you know, say they got clothes
or, or supplies
for these kids.
And now all of a sudden
the state didn't give them the
150 only got 100
and 30 of them, but
they, they had bought supplies for
100 and 50. What happens to
that? The extra
money that they put into
place to get ready for?
I mean, get ready for these 150
kids. Does that make sense?
>> Um Madam chair representative.
Yes, it does. But the,
the contracted
services through
behavioral health services
are mostly for,
um, they're not for like
tangible goods. It's for services
that they provide to an
individual, um,
counseling or
therapy or
um, those types of services
is what we're really
discussing.
>> Uh, with that being said,
madam chair and
secretary.
Now you said that
not tangible goods, like
food and stuff, but
say,
uh,
Senator Sheer, he's a
psychologist and he's got
him booked up for
these kids and all of
a sudden they're not there
anymore. So what happened
to his money that he was waiting
for? Who, who takes
care of his
bill?
Because you know, to, to do to have
a doctor's visit, you know, you
don't just go to a doctor and
say here I am
or to have a psychiatrist or
psychologist come and visit with
you. He's not, you're
not just gonna call him tomorrow and say,
well,
we were scheduled
for 100 and 50 people. Now we
only got 100 and 30. So
what happens to that part?
>> Um So madam chair
representative, we don't give
them a contract based on a
certain number of kids.
We give them a contract based
on a dollar amount per
child. So we
don't say we're expecting you to see
100 and 50. We're
saying we're gonna give you
$100 per
visit and you
can do up to X
number of visits, but there's no
guarantee on the number of
kids they're going to see, because we wouldn't
know how many kids are going to come in
to custody in any given
county at any given
time. >> Ok. That,
that makes sense. Uh
Let me ask you a couple more
questions on, on
your vouchers,
you know,
to go get a haircut. You need a,
these kids don't have any
money, do places that
give haircuts
to that. >> Um
Madam chair representative,
some vendors
will take ac YFD
voucher. Um Some
will not um
sometimes the
workers will um
front costs and then
they're reimbursed by the
department. Um Other
times if it's going to be a large expense,
we will use our state
procurement card to pay in
advance for those services
so kids can go in and get those
services. I think there's just
a different variety of ways. We don't
do um, petty
cash in our offices. So
I think there's um, mostly
reimbursement of staff unless
they take a voucher or if
we know ahead of time that there's
going to be an expense and they
don't take a vo a voucher,
then we can do a
po
>> OK. Thank you for that. Uh, one
more last question. Uh,
on Rome New Mexico, a lot of
places don't take vouchers,
stores and stuff.
So, what do you do with these
kids that need to go to the store
and, and any, any grocery
store or
small store in rural
New Mexico and they can't get
a voucher. >> So
madam chair representative,
the money for kids,
you know, mostly in the rural areas
unless they're in office day. And
right now we have 22 kids
that are office days, the
rest of the kids in foster
care that, um, that
will not voucher, but that,
um, monthly supplement
for haircuts
or, you know, clothing
or shoes, any of that, it's
included in the stipend
that the foster parent receives
every month.
>> Ok. Thank you for that. You
know, we had a meeting at the via
ESPA about a year ago
or so and
uh the the
provider complained
about not getting paid,
has that been taken care of? Because,
you know, I sat there
and a bunch of
providers were saying, you know, we're you not
getting paid, we're not gonna
do
that, the kids.
So >> madam
chair representative last year, that
was one of the biggest issues that
we were facing. And so
in early May last year,
we pushed out
tons of payments
to providers. Um I
think for the most
part, that issue has
been resolved. Um I think
there still are some instances
where we have, you know,
hiccups where they're not getting
paid or they didn't get the
placement entered into
facts to know that that
child got placed with somebody and they
don't get the payment done.
But for the most part,
I would say that those payments
are being processed
timely. Um, the
individuals who process, so they're
part of our fax payment.
Um, those individuals have
typically been contract
employees through a temp
agency. We are in the
process of converting those
positions to full
time um, employees
so that they then are fully
aware of, you know, what the
requirements are, what's
eli an eligible expense.
So there's not time spent back
and forth on what's eligible
or not eligible. And we
have um employees who
are then long term employees
who can, you know, understand
what's needed at the department. So we're in the
process of doing that right now
through our reorganization
of the administrative services
department.
>> Thank you, madam, chair and
secretary. Uh I'm
glad to hear that because, you know, there was a
lot of people complaining
about not getting paid
and, you know, I got one last question
and this kind of bothers
me. Uh The reason
for leaving,
uh it's
19% for lack
of leadership support. What,
what is it, where is that coming
from? You know, before you answer
the question, it's not you.
I know you're doing a good job.
I know you're doing a good job but it's still
here and 90%
of the people are leaving is for
leadership. What, what brings
that on
>> madam chair representative? This
is last year's information.
So I'm hopeful it will be different
this year. But, you know, it's
hard to say, I mean, change is
really hard and we've had a
lot of change at the department.
Um A lot of structural
change, a lot of top
leadership that has left
that, you know, and
it's, it's really
challenging for employees.
So, you know, that could still
be the way they feel
that there's lack of leadership.
Um I think when we were
restructuring, um
you know, it was really hard to
kind of envision what it
was looking like. Um
And we restructured from the
bottom up. So we hired
the, the caseworkers were
our priority in getting those
hired, which then left
some of the offices maybe
with, you know, a supervisor
who typically has five
people under it. Now seeing 10
people and a manager
who used to see a couple
of supervisors now having
more. And I think
that has made it harder
for some of the lower level
employees and
frustrating for some of the
supervisors who now have
larger teams. And so
um over the last year that restructure
has, you know, taken some time
to kind of figure that out. And
I think that has led to the
fact that a lot of them feel that there's
not that leadership.
>> Thank you madam Secretary for
clarifying that, you know, because
you look at the numbers and you're
looking at today
and see why so many people are
leaving. But thanks for clarifying
that and thanks for clarifying
the, the payment of
people who weren't getting paid.
Thank you for doing that.
Thank you for all the answers. >> You're
welcome. And again, if any of you are
hearing concerns from foster
families where they're not getting their
payments or they're not getting
reimbursed, um you know,
I would encourage you to have them
or for you to call or
contact Cindy and we'll make
sure that we get that processed.
Um Pretty quickly.
Thank you >> madam secretary.
I got one more question. You know,
I've heard from people that are
foster
parents
and I'm gonna use one example,
ok. The
these people had a
little baby and they wanted to
get him circumcised and the
mom overrode the
ruling of the foster
parents that
they could not do it without her
position and she did not allow
it. What happened on
that because you know,
I'm just using that particular
it did happen.
You know what about other
instances that parents
have
overriding
uh authority
over the foster kids? It's not in
taking care of no
more.
>> Madam chair,
Representative
Garcia. That is
an issue that,
you know, we deal with
quite often even
about haircuts or,
or other
issues we
do, you
know, want to honor the bio
parents
and their
beliefs or
their cultural
circumstances.
So we will try to
do a teeming between the bio
parents and the resource parents.
And it also depends
on the type of permanency
plan that
the child is on. So if
it is reunification,
you know, eventually that child
hopefully will be reunified
safely and if it's
appropriate with
the bio parent, so
it is it
is a hard
decision.
Um and
you know, a teeming hopefully
will occur between the worker, the
resource parents and the bio
parents.
>> Oh yeah, I understand the cultural
part of it. But you know,
when it's a health
deal,
it's, it's hard for
uh for me to be raising a kid
and then you come tell me, well, you
can't do it because it's not your
kid no more. And then
another issue that, that, that
concerns me is
that we're taking kids
away from foster
parents
and two months later
you have another foster
parent
because of too many rules and
regulations. So those are just
concerns of my, you know, because
I, you know, I hear about
it and I look at it and, and
those are big issues that we need to
address.
Uh I don't need an
answer for that. I just want to less
common. Thank
you.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, Representative.
OK. Um I have a couple
of questions. There's
uh I'm gonna
shorten
two of my items
into comments, but
the questions I'll go ahead
and keep because I uh
Representative
Figueroa. Um Also
I think had some questions on this and
then we will hopefully
very uh
speedily move
to our final presentation,
which I hope will also be
speedy. Um
But we have a lot of questions.
This is a really important topic
and so to
um Representative
Armstrong's Point
earlier, it would be
great. Um Staff
take note if we
could just maybe double
the allotted time
for this subcomittee
because even though we have fewer
members than the other committee,
um we're, we're going
longer because I think it's,
it's just very, very
needed. And
um
so um
secretary thank you so much
for, for doing the, the legis
sta um and
Rachel, thank you
for the briefing.
I really appreciated the questions.
And so I tried to
lump my
questions into
those three buckets.
Um The
first
um
topic is the child
maltreatment. And so really
what I'm curious about
is the state,
the state's title
four E plan
and funds. So, could
we get an update very
quickly on
the plan? >> Um
Yes, of course. So
as was mentioned earlier, the plan
was submitted in September
of 22.
Um They rejected
that plan. We received the
denial in early
2023.
Um We started working
on a resubmit of that
plan and submitted it in
the fall of 23.
Then they
um sent us
back to us and changed
what it was that they wanted to see in
the plan. And so
they gave us lots of
feedback and we've, since
um probably
last
fall, we've been
working back and forth with them.
We've submitted a draft, they've
sent back comments, we've submitted
another draft, then
we had a phone call with more
comments and different things that they
wanted to see and we are
now getting ready once
again to resubmit
our plan. So
I think one of the issues
is that,
um and I
think Kathy can probably speak
better to where we are
since she's writing the plan.
But I think there's been issues
back and forth.
Um with respect to
that, I think we're looking to put
things into our plan
that are not yet
evidence-based, but
they are on the California
clearinghouse. And my understanding
is that they're being considered for
evidence-based
is that not.
Right.
Ok. Ok. For the title
Four Clearing House. So
we want to make sure that we're
able to draw down everything
that we're eligible for.
But we do struggle with
some of the evidence-based
programming that is very
restrict, restrictive.
So in some of our rural
communities, we don't have
providers that would do
those specific programs.
And we want to make sure that we can
provide programming across
the state. So some of
those are evidence
informed but
not yet accepted. And
so they're not eligible for four
E drawdown.
Um So I just want to make that
clarification and
have you understand that that's
kind of where our struggle is. I
think, you know, people think we
don't want to do evidence-based
programming. That is
absolutely not the case. We're looking
at that, but sometimes we're
limited on what we can do
in some of the rural communities, in
some of our, you know,
um tribes or Pueblos
um with the services that are
there with respect
to four E, you know, we
are drawing down
everything that we're currently
eligible to draw down.
As a matter of fact, we over
drw um last
year and we ended up
having to pay back
some of the four funds that we
had drawn down. So
the reason that it's looking
like we have a low drawdown
right now, which I think is about
10 million, is
that about where we are in
comparison to where we are in prior
years. Is that in
November, when they
notified us that we were
drawing down inappropriately,
we stopped the drawdown
while we could really do an
evaluation to see what that
looks like. So we will be doing
a large drawdown now,
which will then push that number
up closer but
not quite where we were since we
were overdraw. Um But
we, it will increase that drawdown
number.
>> Thank you. Um
Rachel. Um
Could you remind us
how many
other states have had
their uh title four
E plans
approved
>> madam chair. Currently,
there are 46 plans
approved, a few of them are
tribal entities.
Um But 46 plans
have been approved when we last
checked.
>> Um And
um
are there rural
states
as well
that have been approved
>> madam chair
representative? Yes,
within that
46.
>> Um And so I'm
really glad to hear
that, you know,
we're
finalizing.
Um Hopefully the plan.
Um
I wonder
if there
are lessons learned from
this? Are we
short staff? What
is, you know, it seems to be a
really
distinct and unique
issue that
we're
still going through
this? And so
what is it that the,
how can the legislature
help make sure
that we can
do this faster next
time
or even this
time?
>> Uh Madam chair, I,
I think it is for,
for New Mexico. I came
on board in like
September, right
at September of 22. And
so I was at the tail
end of that first
iteration that was
gone. And
I, I think it was,
um,
some of the difficulty had
been that there's some
disjointedness is
what I call it. The, the
collaboration is
so much
more improved over this
last year.
Um That, that's made it
easier. And
uh when we resubmitted
the plan, when they said, you know,
you don't have a robust
um evaluation
process, you don't
have um,
the, the curriculum.
Are you sure you know how to do this?
Are you sure that, that E
ce CD really wants to
work with you and wants to take these
high, really high risk
uh foster care candidates
because the, the idea
is that it,
it's only for foster care
candidates. And so our original
definition included Children
0 to 5.
We were really broad
and they said, yeah, no, you
can't do that. I mean, basically,
it's what they said. And
so we're rewriting
that as it's gonna have to be a
little bit more strict.
Um And New
Mexico is using family
connections, which is an
evidence-based program. It's
in the California Clearinghouse.
It's not in the title
four E Clearinghouse.
So even when our
plan is approved,
we cannot draw
down until
family connections is
identified in the for
Clearing House.
We could look at do
we want to do a completely new
curriculum? We've sunk a lot
of money into family connections
over the last 34
years and all of our
community providers are now
using it because it is
a, um,
evidence-based curriculum
that they're able to hire
for it. Allow
you have a, a master's
level supervisor,
but you have bachelor's level
on, on the, the workers,
the field staff.
Whereas if you had
homebuilder, for example,
which was looked at
it's master's level
clinicians
who are supervised
by a master's level
clinician. And they
have, um, they
do like, um, 2
to 5 hours in the home
a week. So the caseload
is maybe three
because you wouldn't want more than that. Like that's
an intensive program.
So if you think about that
across our state,
on how many clinicians
you would have to have to be able
to do homebuilder.
Our community-based
providers would not
be successful. They would
not be able to do that.
The, it's already difficult for them
to do family connections, but they
understand why that's
important. So,
curriculums were looked
at, it's just that
some don't work for
us. And so that's a piece of our
plan too. Why,
why does it
some of the delay?
And now they want all new
policies for all the changes that
we're making too. And so we're
hoping they'll accept draft
policies, but that's
because we're
family service is just now
standing up
and they know that. So they're
wanting the latest what
we're really
doing
>> it. Um So
if family connections
wasn't on the list,
but maybe we thought it was a better
fit when
we started using
family connections. Were we at all
concerned that it wouldn't
get approved? I
mean, just
curious about that thought
process.
>> Uh I don't know when
they madam
chair, they began, they chose
that curriculum prior to me
coming on
board and it was
already being
utilized and prior to
the plan being written,
the the first iteration.
So I don't
know if they started down the path and
like we're here.
>> So, ok, thank
you. Um
You mentioned
um
uh the social workers.
And so one of the questions that I had
about workforce
was to see
if we have an update
on how um
the funding,
if we're making progress
in recruiting
uh licensed social
workers. I know that there was a special
appropriation to help with
workforce. Um
And so are we actually moving
the needle um
on hiring licensed
social workers?
>> Um madam
chair, I don't
have the numbers in front of me of how
many licensed social workers
we currently have. Um
As I said, we had, you know, the
stipend workers
um that we're
rolling into that, but then they
still have to go and after they
finish school and do the license,
we are in communication
um with licensing Bureau at
regulation and licensing
because we have a high
number in New Mexico of
students who take that exam and
don't pass it. I don't have the
statistics right now, but
we're looking into that and
they're looking at what that
licensing needs to be
and if there need to be changes
to what that is.
Um I
think at the last count, we had
about 7.4%
of our work staff in protective
services of the frontline
workers that were licensed
social workers, but I don't have a current
number. Um But
as I said earlier, we did have
a trip planned to go to
neighboring states of
schools of social
work to do recruitment.
But then as we started, you know,
really digging down deep into
our budget and recognizing
the fact that we were not going to
realize the four funds and
that we were gonna be building
protective services in a deficit.
We kind of held off on
recruiting new people until we figured
out how we were going to pay for
them.
>> Thank you can.
So the special appropriation
though, that's for
workforce recruitment, can
that be reused for
title four?
>> Um So madam
chair, there are two different
special appropriations. There was
the 3,000,002
years ago that
wasn't spent, that was
relatively broad in
terms of the purpose, recruitment
retention. Um It
wasn't intended to fund
salaries though um
for, for um
caseworkers that is
similar to the special
appropriation that will take effect
for the three year pilot in
the grow also
to incentivize
licensed social workers, but
also not intended
for salaries per S
>> E.
On that point, could,
could those funds be used
to
um
do tutoring
coaching, whatever we need to get
people to pass their licensure
exam.
>> Um Madam chair
representative, those were some of the
potential intent for the use
of those
funds.
>> Thank you.
Um
We talked a little bit about
um sort of silos.
Um I think uh Representative
Baca had a, a compelling
instance. Um And you've
mentioned the Valencia
County
um
Family Resource Center.
Uh One question that I have
is there's a lot of work going on
in different counties, for
instance, Bernalillo County and I know
Valencia County and
um some of the others
um San Miguel
um have
started 100%
community programs,
you know, that bring together a
variety of
service providers.
Um you know,
transportation, housing,
um early childhood
and I'm wondering
if, if you guys
are coordinating with
those types of entities as
well.
>> Yes,
three
madam chair, our community
providers are definitely
coordinating with 100%.
They're part of many of
them. Um And
we are aware at
the family services
level or CYFD level
of the, the
activities that are taking place
because we don't want to,
to overlap, we want
to work alongside
and make sure that we have the full breadth
of services for our
families.
>> OK. Thank you.
Um All
right.
I think I will
end that there.
Um I feel
like I had a lot more questions
but
um
thank you. So, uh
family services.
Is that next?
>> Yes, madam chair. Thank you.
And I believe you're getting handouts
and I will
move as quickly as I can
and make sure and, and try to answer
all your questions. And so if I'm going too
fast, just go
stop,
it's too fast. Um
What family services
um is about, as the secretary
said is we really
are bringing together prevention
programs that were spread across
the department. So they're
coming from juvenile justice,
they're coming from behavioral
health, they're coming from
protective services.
And
um so I'm
moving through this. So
um the programs that are
there is we have
the community-based prevention
intervention and reunification,
which is often referred to as
CBPIR
we have because every family
knows what CBPIR would
stand for and how
it could help them. So, we really got to
work on that marketing. But
um we have family
outreach. We have in-home
services because in-home
services let you know exactly what
it is, it's in your home.
Um Keeping families
together. We have the Caro
program, we have the children's
trust fund that you might be familiar
with and they have their own
programming. We have domestic
violence services, the family
resource centers,
multilevel response, which
is also known as Differential
Response. And then we've
also brought over youth
mentorship and
um which will
address the families in need of
services and also
from JJ. So it's youth
mentorship and Fins or
families in need of services
that we're working to bring on.
And we hope to have that
started in July.
So if I'm looking
at, if you go to the next
slide where
it really talks about where
we're at, what kind of
programs are there,
um what they hope
to do and what they are
doing. Um I want
to call out CBPIR
because oftentimes
that's the one that's looked at when
we're doing our Senate Bill
58 program
inventory.
And one of the
outcomes for that is that
um 97%
of the families who entered
into that program do not
come into foster care.
So it's working
the curriculum they
use that is
um evidence informed.
I think it may be promising, but
it's nurturing parenting
and they use ABC
parenting. So it's in a
different clearinghouse in the four
E. But it's something that our
providers really
like and they're
having success with it based
on the numbers that, that we
get because we do look at, do
they come back, do they come into
care one?
But also we look
at then,
um,
do they have another
substantiated case or
do they have a substantiated case?
So those are the outcomes that we're looking
at because this is our primary
community prevention
service that we're
doing across the
state.
We have um
as I said, our domestic violence
programming, our family resource
centers which were um
in the process of really standing
up and we have two more.
We hope to have those contracts out
in July and we'll be
able to open those up in Rio
Aruba and
um in
Chavez County.
Um I'm hopeful that
we can get funding for mobile
resource centers. I'm keeping
my fingers crossed for Socorro
County and San Juan County.
And we're really looking at
that because we want to make
sure that our
families can come in to
a one stop shop and
be provided
what they need.
And so they're
coming in and
um that they
may need something as
simple as
um TF benefits
where they may need a lot more which is
parenting or mental health
services or
uh domestic violence, they
may need some support
there. It just
depends. And so the Family resource
Center is not, you have
this problem. It's right here.
Just come on in and we're gonna help
you figure this out and that's what doing
a family assessment and really
working with that family where they're
at using family
Navigators. So,
um
the children's trust fund
does innovative programming
and so they provide
funding
for different
community
uh programs
where it may not be
evidence based. Um
But it's something they really think
works for their communities. And
so they have their own uh
funding that they utilize
for that. We have the
multilevel response
system, which we
do have phase one, which
is out there with family
outreach and they, they serve
families who are
um had a screened
out sky referral or
statewide central intake.
And it's more like a cold
call where they're contacting them and
saying, hey, we notice you might
need some services.
Is there something we can help you
with? Um We're in
the process of working now to
do phase two, we're working
on the,
which we're working with Casey
Family Program to
be able to build
our infrastructure for
that differential response. But
you're going to hear it as multilevel
because that's how it is. I believe in the
statute.
And
so that
we think we have a 30
60 90 day plan with
Casey family on how that's going to
look, it started this month.
So that's the timeline for
that. We, we'll have to
hire for that specific
one also.
Um And
then we
have, I'll skip down to the,
the Caro program.
We have five
candidates who
have
been selected.
Um And it's going through
that process. We
have others on second
interviews, third interviews.
Um And
I think we're at 1st,
2nd and 3rd interviews and we've
had one area which
is Gallup where we've had no
applicants for care.
Navigators. That program
is gonna look a little a lot
different than how it was
because it wasn't really a program.
Um So it's
going to have a family assessment.
The career navigators will go to
the home for families who are not
engaging in any services or
going to the home. See the
child, do the family assessment,
connect them. It'll be intensive
care management services.
And, um, we'll
see, what do they need and
what do they need, parenting,
safe sleep. What does
it look like? What
we know we're gonna have gaps
identified for substance
abuse and substance use
treatment. We, we already
know that's going to be there, but we're gonna figure
this out. But the,
the primary, the big
piece of this is
that we're going into the home,
we're doing the family assessment
and we're really going to work with that
family and if they
choose not to work
with us, then we're gonna have an avenue
that's going to go back to investigations
because we've got to have
these Children receive
services. So,
um, I hope that
answers one question about how many
we have hired. Uh, we
also have,
uh,
I also did a breakdown
just to kind of show you what the community
pathway looks like.
Um, because we have a number of
community providers that
are out there providing some great
services and
who, uh, always tell
me they need more funds and less
restrictions. So,
um, but because they're
doing good work in their community,
but they're, they're working with Children.
0 to 17.
It's important to note that
all of our services
have an emergency
discretionary funding.
So let's say a family
says I, you know,
I don't have tires for
my car. They're bald or
whatever that safety
issue. Well, you can't just
replace tires for 20
bucks like that. That's what's gonna
happen. It could be your rent
that you need to replace
your tires. And so
that's what that emergency discretionary
funding is for, is to
support families when they're
in that just immediate
crisis. Something's happened.
The breadwinner may have passed
away. We've had that happen.
We've had grandparents
who are informally
taking care of grandkids and they
suddenly need beds. So
that's what that emergency
funding is for. And these
programs can work with
those informal grandparents
or relatives who are taking
care of Children. They don't,
it didn't reach the level
of us to take custody,
but we can support them.
And then we have what I call our
internal pathway. And so
that's, that's where
our in-home services are, there
are employees
and they receive cases
from investigations
and they also are using the family
connections curriculum
to be able to support
families.
And then last but
not least is,
um, our family resource
centers that we've kind of talked about. They're
just a hub. They're a one stop
shop for families.
And um,
the then if you have any
questions, you can contact me or our
director is Scott Patterson
Alatorre and that contact
information is there.
Um And with that, I
will stand for questions and that's
the fastest I've ever done
family
services.
>> Thank you. Um,
Representative
Garcia.
>> Thank you madam chair. I have
one quick question. Uh, Kira,
how, how
does that work? You know, I know
right now it's optional
for the mother to get help for
baby if it's born
addicted, how do you guys
follow up on that because you
know, how can you let a
baby and a mom go
out knowing
that he's addicted?
You know, is there anything
that we could do as a state
or how,
how do you work that
out? >> The
first part?
Um Madam Chair Representative
Garcia, we are
looking at introducing
legislation in this next
legislative session to address
some of the ka. Um,
we recognize that it is a
voluntary program.
Um, and we want to make
sure that we're not
pushing people away
from prenatal care,
um, because they're afraid
that we're gonna just come in
and, um, once they give
birth, we're gonna remove that child,
we want it to be
um where
they still seek that care.
But we also recognize the
issues that we have with
that. We are looking and
working with Department of Health on
maybe, um, establishing
universal screening so
that we can get in earlier
and work with those families early
on, um, before
birth so that we can do some
preventive measures or get
them involved in treatment prior
to the birth, um, to
really try to work with that,
but there will be
legislation this next session
to address some of those
issues. >> Thank
you for that because you know what, what
happens if the mom's
addicted and the baby
is born addicted, the
mom's not gonna want no
help. So, in the
meantime, if
we don't do something about this.
We're gonna start losing more kids
because, you know, if you're
addicted, you know, they just
don't, it, it doesn't go
away and then a parent
that is addicted that just
doesn't go away either. And
those are very important issues that we
need to address because,
uh, that's a big
problem, you know,
but like you see
parents that just don't care
about the kids and at the
end of the day that kids wind up
in, in, in foster care
or homes that they
shouldn't be in there to begin
with if we help them
prior, you know, knowing
that they're addicted and to let them
go. That's, that's tough.
That's really hard.
You know, it's almost a
crime to say, you know what this
kid addicted, let let them go.
They'll be on their own and that's
wrong. Thanks for bringing
that up on legislation, but we
really need to address that. Thank you
madam chair.
>> Thank you. If you just want to scoot
that over.
>> Thank you madam chair. He
thought I was trying to go first.
He's giving me the elbow over
here.
Thank you madam chair. And
thank you for answering the
question. I was
curious, when did we
remind me when we passed the K
A
law
>> madam chair representative,
I believe it was 2019
tw federally.
It was 2016. I
don't have that in front of me
that specifically
New Mexico I believe is
2019. >> Ok.
I'm just concerned that we
still don't have something
set up that's, you know,
after all these years and,
and we're trying to, uh,
still set it up
and navigate that.
Um, I
was,
I, I'm just
pretty
appalled
that, um,
we're still letting babies go
home,
born, addicted
to addicted parents.
And this is all
intertwined with
our education system, our
crime, our
lack of
family
orientation in New
Mexico.
And
once again,
Annie E Casey Foundation
released the 2024
new Mexico kids count data,
book reporting.
New Mexico ranks
last once
again in the nation
for child well
being.
And so we would really like to
hear. I
mean, I know you're probably working
with a legislator but
we are in this
committee now and we would
love to know what
you all are actually planning on
doing what kind of
legislation you're actually
thinking about because I'm going to
run mine again.
I guarantee you, I'm gonna run mine
again to, to change may
to shall.
So I I'd really
just like to hear what you're planning
on doing.
Thank you, madam
chairman.
>> Thank you,
Representative
Garrett.
Thanks madam chair. It's so
sensitive. It's hard
mandate versus
I mean, if we can mandate this
or that, so they
get to choose but they have to do
it. Um My
only question is on the
family resource centers are, are
those all done by
RFP?
And how many people
are
responding?
>> So madam, chair
representative, yes, we
did it through an RFP
process
and they
were targeted for specific
counties based on
similar to the heat map.
It was based on child
maltreatment.
And so
the response
rate
was low for
those specific counties.
Uh But um we did
get good pro proposals
and feel confident with our
contracts.
>> Thank
you.
All right.
Um So,
first, um I
want to thank our
panel for
this very long afternoon.
Thank you for sticking with
us and for the folks
um here
in, you know, in the audience
and those uh that
are watching the webcast. So
first, thank you for that.
Um Second, um Deputy
Secretary, I think the um
Family Services Department,
the stuff that
um you guys are working
on uh sounds very
exciting. Um And
lots of good stuff. So thank
you for that presentation.
Um And I apologize that
uh we asked you to,
you know, condense it and,
and make it fast, but thank
you very much. Uh for that
wonderful work.
Um Finally, I would
like to um I'd like
to ask the
secretary to
provide our
analysts with a copy
of the most
recent
report uh plan
submitted to
the Federal government for
the title four. E.
Um I would like for
our analyst to
review that as well as
the feedback provided
by the federal
government. And I would
like for our
analysts to be able to provide the
sub-committee with
an analysis because
I think that it is
very important that
we have
an understanding of
why we are not
receiving all of the
federal funds available to
us. Um
Before
we enter into
budget hearings,
um you know, I don't think
that we would be in a position
to um
support requests
without having that
information. So
if you would do that, thank you
madam Secretary.
And then if you
also don't mind letting us
know when
it's submitted again,
that would be wonderful.
And then Rachel can make sure
all of us know.
Um So thank
you. Um Thank
you for bearing with us.
And
um
>> so even if you
clarify the four E
plan and the money
is uh allocated,
would it be in the next
fiscal year of the
federal government because they
begin October 1,
we don't begin until
July 1. So
would it be another year before
we would actually see the funds
assuming that the plan is
approved?
>> You want to
Cindy address the
funny
we can't
that
>> madam chair and Representative
Herndon. Yes,
that, that is correct. We would
see results from that the next
fiscal year.
However,
revising the
plan will get us more
federal funding. If we
adjust it to claim
more funds,
it will I do
not believe get us
to
the amount that we would
need
that we've been budgeting or
appropriating and and
not >> madam
chair representative, if I can just
clarify for the prevention
plan itself,
the curriculum that is
being used for those
identified as foster care
candidates, which are the highest
risk Children
that would be receiving family
preservation has
not been approved
by the Clearing
Four E Clearinghouse
as of yet. So
even if the
approval happened
with this next
submission, we could
not draw down funds
until that
curriculum is
in that clearinghouse. It
is on the waiting list
for the clearinghouse to
review. So we don't, we
don't control that
component. So there's
two factors. It has to be a
foster care candidate
and it has to be
approved curriculum.
So I just want to make
sure everyone knows that even if the plans
approved, we will not
be drawing down funds. And there are
states who have an approved
plan and have approved
curriculum and have not drawn
down funds because they can't figure out
how to do it. So
there's that too,
that's out there. So
it's, it's a complicated
process.
>> All right. Um On that
note, um I think
our sub-committee will
go ahead and
complete its uh work
for the day. Members
are encouraged to head
over to the riverside
country club for
a social reception this
evening, sponsored by
Namo. So
thank you. Thank you very much.
