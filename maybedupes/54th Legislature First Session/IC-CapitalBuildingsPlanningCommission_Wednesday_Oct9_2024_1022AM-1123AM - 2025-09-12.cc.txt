All right,
everyone
works. We'll
go ahead and get started. Um I
think a couple of
housekeeping things, we're going
to change the
schedule a little bit. Um From
what the agenda says, we're gonna start with
Supreme Court and go to
Court of Appeals then burn Leo
Metro Court. Um
Also we are going to be
begin webcasting. So
for everyone who has a
microphone, please
turn on your microphone um when
you are speaking otherwise,
um you will not be heard
on the webcast. So only
while you're
speaking
Mr.  Chair. Thank
you. I have with
me. Uh Joining me is
MS Liz Garcia, the
chief clerk of the
Supreme Court. And
as we turn to the Supreme Court,
um
our courthouse of course is a, a
beautiful courthouse
built during the works works project
administration during the
depression completed
1937.
Um That of course means
uh today
uh close, starting
to think about 1/100 100th
birthday already uh for
the building,
but
there are significant
infrastructure needs that MS
Garcia will talk
about.
Good morning,  Mr.  Chair and
members of the committee I
wanted to thank the chair
for coming to the Supreme Court
building and doing a tour
with our chief justice
and really I to
the Supreme Court building, we
love our building. It's an
architectural gem
as Carl mentioned um
to New Mexicans like
the only building used
for its original purpose since the
19 thirties.
Um and we would encourage
you all to come to visit
us and do a building tour.
Um We
love our building. It's in excellent
condition, but we
have hired an
architectural and archit
um The Hartman
and Majewski design
group that provided a
comprehensive facility
needs assessment.
We are happy to upload
it and put it in the
system.
Um
Oh, what came
out of the um
facility conditions
assessment report
um really
provided us a number
of long term
recommendations.
Um They gave us
priorities
which was really helpful
for near term
repairs,
medium term
repairs, long
term repairs and really
concentrating on
security,
energy efficiency,
increase levels of physical
accessibility within the
building, digital
accessibility.
Um
And they
provided what I
would encourage the committee to
review is an executive
summary. Um
That really does a comprehensive
facility overview,
a structural
summary, an
architectural summary,
mechanical and plumbing
summary,
um
electrical and technology
summary of fire suppression
alarm summary and
then an overall facility
planning assessment
summary.
Um Just ensure
we are
making these recommendations
based on this facility
comprehensive
assessment um
to meet the current state of
the building and our future
needs.
Um
Really looking at
the
of the
facilities condition
assessment. We really want to make
sure that we address the
near term repairs
that were provided by
the uh
facility needs
assessment. Really looking
at the long term
needs as well
but really concentrating
on the priorities that were
identified is
very important to the
Supreme Court building and its
operations.
Um We
have come up
with a phased approach
and a cost estimate
um
that was provided by
the Hartman Firm.
Um
The total cost of the
project
has been identified in the
system as
14,380,000
to really look at
renovation repairs in the
Supreme Court building, focusing
on the garden level
basement repair.
Um And there
was quite
a bit of thought put into the
cost estimates
and uh the
priorities of the facility
conditions assessment.
Um
Again, workers trying
to keep up our
historic preservation of our
building, but
also looking to the
longevity of the
building, providing
an environment that's very safe
for our justices,
our staff and the public that we
serve. Um I
would answer any
questions.
Thank you. Any questions from the
committee?
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Um
I just want to say thank
you very much for doing
a facility condition assessment.
It really helps the committee
um in looking at your
requests and how you
prioritize
um moving forward. Um
That's something that we ask of
all entities is that
they do some sort of assessment
and then prioritize the project. So
that we can see
what the justification is
for each project.
So I remember last
year, um you came in with
a request for the basement
uh for the Supreme
Court. Can you tell me if
you received any money in which
you've done as far as uh
completion of those projects?
Because I remember that was one
of your, I think that was your number one
request was the
basement.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair
and
um
M Silva, just to
address the question,
we are very grateful
for uh the
guidance of this committee
and out of last year's
committee hearing,
we conducted a
facilities just
assessment based on yours
guidance. Um
So we did receive a
$4 million
appropriation to
address the
uh garden level,
the basement of the Supreme
Court building
through that we went through an
RFP process and we
were able to get the Hartman
firm to conduct a
facilities needs
assessment that was comprehensive.
Um We've identified
the near term repairs.
Um We have some
really critical structural
beam repairs that are being
made throughout that
funding. Um
So right now that
$4 million is being
utilized to make these
critical repairs in the
garden level. Um
But in our work
in our facility needs
assessment, it was determined
that the cost of
the repairs
were much more substantial
than the $4 million
appropriation.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you for the
presentation. You know,
I was actually going to ask the same
question about the, about
the, the basement.
As I know that this was
an
extremely important
priority for the
Supreme Court. There
was a couple of reasons for
it and I'm just
wondering
what the Supreme Court
has done in order to
address
the
space needs for
staffing that I think was
one of the biggest reasons for
expanding uh the
basement level.
Uh And then also,
um
do you have a
breakdown, the the
breakdown that you've discussed?
I, I didn't see it in our
packet, but I
was wondering if you had
uh that breakdown
and a phasing plan
for how you anticipate
uh moving forward with those
repairs based on your
asess.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair and
members of the committee. That's
an excellent question.
Um
This uh
planning and preliminary design
report, we will upload
it to the system with the
appendices. Um
And it's very good in terms
of determining priorities
again, short term
and long term. Um
But what came out of the facility
conditions assessment was
critical to the users,
the Hartman and um
Majesky Design Group
did a facility user
assessment and a facility
user survey
that was sent out to all
users of the Supreme Court
building. And that
really helped us
determine like some of
the key needs
assessments, space assessments
that are detailed in this
comprehensive report.
But in essence, it has kind
of shaped the priorities
um using a facility
conditions assessment
and helping the Supreme court kind
of prioritize? What are the
space needs assessment?
What are the critical needs
of the Supreme Court?
Including right
now, the
garden level basement really
needs some structural
beam repairs that are being
made um
pretty near
term. Um We are
in oral arguments right now
but we anticipate having
these uh constructive
repairs done
in the short term.
Um
But what I like
about the FC A
is it really gives us a long
term picture
and a roadmap for
the future needs of the
building.
So  Mr.  Chair,
thank you for that.
Is
there.
So what was originally
proposed uh last
year? Um
has that, has that
been, has that been
completely
changed? Which is fine
if it has because the assessment,
you know, should drive the
decisions but,
but where does it put you
in in the need
to to relocate
staff? And, and
as as you had originally
proposed last year
is, is moving, is
moving this out to next
year or future years
still feasible
or are you still finding
yourself with,
with a need
to potentially
reconfigure space
to address the staffing
needs? Because again, I think
it was about bringing
people back post COVID
having, you know, having the
space available for
that. As
are you able to address
that knowing that you're
not gonna be doing anything
with the basement in the short
term other
than structural? Because I think you
mentioned
Mr.  Chair and members
of the committee, um
the Supreme Court of New
Mexico. We have,
we have right now. We are
in this a
very busy season
for the Supreme Court of New Mexico.
We are holding oral
arguments
um in terms.
So we are holding
all of our appellate arguments
and we are making decisions
that impact the lives of New
Mexicans and people around the
country. Um
So we have to
be mindful of our critical
operational needs right now
and our staffing needs um to
support the Supreme Court.
Um based on the
facility needs assessment,
it seems like we can do
this in certain
certain phases and
certain ways to
like govern what are the immediate
needs. Um Coming
out of the facility
conditions assessment, there was
some recommendations to be
to do this kind of
in a phased approach
so that one
division of the court is not
entirely impacted
so that we can be able
to keep doing our business
day to day and have
it a little bit more structured
to be able to make some of
these
repairs
from Kelly.
Um Thank you for the
presentation. Um
We do you mind providing
us with a copy of the FC
A the cost
estimate um at
least for the basement
project.
Thank
you.
Um
So is the
28 million
for
like total
renovation of the whole building
or just the basement?
Mr.  Chair and members of the
committee
again, uh
the uh
facility conditions
assessment provided like
the whole entire
picture and the $28
million figure was for the
entire Supreme Court
building. Oh,
again, we
focused very
narrowly uh our
critical needs on
the garden level basement
level. That is where
the uh submission of the
fy 26
apple request is
at the $14
million
and it is detailed
on page 106 of the
cost estimate. What is
great is there is a table of
contents
and so the cost estimate is
included.
Um And so,
so the request we have for the
basement point
is that accurate?
Um
Mr.  Chair members of the
committee, um
I pull
the IC IP
uh plan submission.
Um And
in that description, it
was estimated
to be
14,000,380.
Um
You know, we can stand to
amend to correct it,
but um the
cost estimate does provide
a larger figure of 50
million,
891,000.
Um ok. And, and
you guys have a,
you got $4
million last
year and then you have 2
million from
also for the
basement.
Um So
are you able
to
start work on
it with the 6
million you have
now
Mr.  Chair and members of the
committee. Um We have
utilized the $4
million appropriation
that has been part
of the Comprehensive
project. We've been utilizing
that to make immediate critical
needs repairs.
Um And we are very
grateful for that appropriation
to make these critical
repairs. So yes, we can
start using that.
Um That
appropriation.
Um
The, the other
appropriation of $2
million was a
little bit broader.
My understanding it was
for
technology,
sewer and live
streaming of our appellate
arguments. We've made
substantial critical
sewer upgrades to the Supreme
Court building.
Um And we've
also done a lot
in terms of technology and live
streaming of our appellate
arguments
in short.
Yes.
Can you hold on real
quick? I
just,
you have a calorie cuz I can read
it right now.
Yes. So
it looks to me like it was
pretty specifically for the
basement that
you're.
Yes. Uh It, it
is. Yeah,
it's improvements to the
basement.
So I, I guess maybe you guys
could just follow up with
us on
the sort of like
what the 6 million will
cover that you have for the
basement for the total cost.
But
the
Absolutely
and, and  Mr.  Chair and,
and I guess one of the things that I was
gonna say is,
or I ask is, did the
FC
also take into
consideration
the improvements that you're
planning on making or
are, is the FC A
driving the improvements you're
planning on making with
the
um  Mr.  chair, members
of the committee. The FC A
is really driving
a lot of the
recommendations
of what is needed
at the Supreme Court building based
on subject matter
experts
have that have identified
critical needs in all these
areas. Um
So the FC A is really
determining our needs and
priorities.
I think, I think to be more
specific,  Mr.  Chair
is, is,
was the 6 million
expanded prior to
the FC A or
is it, did it drive
the decisions?
The
expenditure,
Mr.  Chair and members of the
committee, um, there
was a $4 million
appropriation that was made
directly to
GSD and
we have a legislative
language request
that's supported by
GSD so that
the Supreme Court can be the
direct fiscal agent of
those funds. So it
is $4 million
about the HVAC system
and some needed
electrical repairs
that we, that
they are critical, immediate
needs that we are
hoping to use next
legislative session so that we
can upgrade our elevators,
our HVAC system. So
that $4 million is
kind of on hold right now
until we can get that legislative
change. But again,
the $2 million has
been earmarked
for building improvements
right
now.
Any other questions from the
committee?
And thank you.
Thank
you.
Next will do Court of Appeals.
All right. Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Joining me here is
Chief Judge Jennifer
A from the Court of Appeals
along with uh chief
clerk of the Court of Appeals, Ramon
Maestas, the
Court of Appeals
um is in
two locations which you
might not think of if
you don't know about
the new Mexico Judiciary.
They have, um,
space in the Supreme Court
building here in Santa Fe.
And then they also have this very beautiful
courthouse in Albuquerque
on the UN M campus right
next to, um,
the UN M law School.
That courthouse um, is
now getting to the age
where we really
need to do a little bit of
maintenance. Um It
was purpose built
as the Court of Appeals building.
It was great, but of
course, the needs have shifted a little
bit and Chief Judge Arick
will talk a little bit more
about
it. Uh
bigger maintenance needs
as well as a little bit
of security and infrastructure
updates.
Thank you, Carl and uh thank
you,  Mr.  chair members
of the committee again, I'm
Jennifer ARRP. I'm the chief judge
of the Court of Appeals.
Ramon Maestas joins
us, our chief clerk
and then Christina keys our
CFO who we share with the
Supreme Court right now.
Um I just want to take a second
to, to really thank this
committee for your
support over the years.
Uh This fiscal year, the Court of
Appeals received an
appropriation, a capital outlay,
appropriation
of a half a million
dollars to address
critical security
issues at our Albuquerque
courthouse. Uh And
we are in the process of putting that
money to good use. So, thank
you very much. Uh As
Carl mentioned this year,
we have a couple of
capital outlay requests that we
are making um
as our
courthouse in Albuquerque
ages as
the needs of the public
and the court change.
We are adapting
um as we
need our courthouse. So our
first request
uh is just
over a half million dollars for
clerk's office
alterations.
Currently in our Albuquerque
clerk's office, there is
one enclosed office
only of Ramond,
that is Ramon's office.
We don't have any dedicated
office space for our
administrative team. So for
our deputy chief clerk
for our hr staff
for our financial
staff, uh instead
the remainder of the clerk's office
is open space with
cubicles. Um and
then there's a lot of dedicated
space to um
housed paper files that
we no longer have
with the move to our
Odyssey and electronic
filing system.
Those files have moved
online and we
don't have for that
uh large storage
areas. And so
the requests that we're presenting
today is to
convert that unused
uh space, storage
space, inefficient storage
space so that we can create
private suites
uh or private offices
for our
deputy clerk and our administrative
team. They, as you all
know, they, they handle
highly sensitive information,
personnel files, court,
financial files and we really
need some dedicated office space
for them. Uh In
addition, we would be
able to consolidate
uh the remainder of our clerk's office
staff in one area.
Currently, part of
them are in the back of the clerk's
office in an old storage
area in cubicles.
So we can consolidate that
space uh so that
they could be near the front, near the
window and better serve New
Mexicans. Um
Our second capital L A request
is, is a fairly minor
request of 96
$1000 for
stucco repairs.
So the exterior of our
building is
stucco as
well as tile and
with the age and weather
exposure, we are seeing
some pretty significant
cracking in the stucco
around the perimeter of the building
are north facing balconies.
So we have nine north facing
balconies, those are
cracking and accumulating
mould. And so
uh this uh
would be able to
remediate uh the damage
that's been caused so far
and also prevent further
uh further damage to the
building um due to
the due to the
stucco uh cracking.
Uh So, with that, um thank
you again for your time consideration
uh and your support over the years
and we're happy to ask or
answer any questions that you
might
have
for. Honey. Thank
you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you for the
presentation. Appreciate
it. Um I just
had a couple of questions. The first
is uh on this
reconfiguration of
space.
Um Have you
already received cost estimates
or how did you, how did you
come up with these particular
costs? And then
what's the square footage of that
space that you're gonna be
recon?
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair members of the
committee. Uh Hopefully,
Ramon can look up the square
footage uh while I
answer the first portion of the
question. So we received
a, a fairly rough cost
estimate
um
from
right con uh
architects.
Um And they gave us
a, an estimate
um based on the square
footage there.
Uh And it was, it
was just a fairly rough
estimate. We
adjusted that for
inflation as well
as adding gross receipts tax.
So the estimate estimate
that we received was just over
four $100,000.
The square footage is
2000
just under 2700
square feet.
Um And so
uh the price
per square foot back
when this estimate was
received was
100 and $50 per square
foot. And by the
time we get the funds, we anticipate
that uh
architecture construction
costs will have increased
through
inflation.
Thank you for that  Mr.
Chair. When was the, when did you
receive that?
C
see
you
uh  Mr.  Chair members of the
committee? Thank you, Carl. It was
March 25th
of this year. Ok.
Thank
you.
The
I think that I think that
reconfiguration of space
is, is extremely important. That's
one of the things that we promote
highly uh
in, you know, in lieu of new
space, you know, being able to reconfigure
space and utilize it in a more
appropriate way. So,
uh so I appreciate,
appreciate you looking at doing
that. Um
As far as the exterior repairs
with Stucco, same
questions.
When did you receive that
estimate? Um
Did you receive an
estimate?
And then I'll have, I have one other
father
and, and thank you,  Mr.  Chair
members of the committee. We also
received that estimate. March
25th. Our facilities manager
was very busy
right around that time of the year.
Um It's from, right?
Con uh
And um
the cost there uh
for the Stucco repair
and remediation work is
90,000, just
over 90,600. Again,
that that has
been um
inflation, inflation
adjusted.
Um
Thank you for that.
One of the things that I wanted to ask
on the Stucco is
um was there
an assessment done?
Um or, or could
they tell if you had
any water seepage
into the facility itself
and, and, and
whether or not there was gonna be because
I think you mentioned mould.
And so I, I just want
to, I want to make
sure that, you know,
as we get into
costs for mould
remediation if that was actually
taken into account in this, in
this cost estimate.
Um because
that, that can become a
little, that can become quite
costly and,
and we just want to make sure that
that you have sufficient funding,
not just to go ahead and address
the exterior stucco uh
to protect the asset,
but also have sufficient
funding in order to address
any, any remediation
mould
remediation.
Mr.  Chairman members of the committee. Thank
you for that. Uh The short
answer is, I don't know, but I'm,
I will find out. Uh
Right Khan,
certainly observed
mould in on
the exterior of the balconies.
Um I don't know whether they made
an assessment at the moment. I
don't believe he knows
um whether
uh with the cracking,
whether there's mould
within the building,
which again, that's an excellent
point would drive up the
cost to remediate
that.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Yeah, I, I would, I would ask
that that if it's possible to
discuss with Ryon
uh to just
get a better idea
of because
again, I, I think that, that,
that these are important
projects to fund, you want to protect
the asset. But
I think you also want to make sure that you
don't put yourself in a situation to
where you don't have sufficient
funding to truly
address
an item such as mould.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. That's all I
have
my
soba
thank you,  Mr.  Um
Just a couple of questions.
One is um
just a recommendation
in your future. Presentations.
Pictures go a long way
with us. So we're
kind of like listening to
you and your need for
stucco and the mould,
but I see you have some pictures
in your um in a
maybe a assessment
that um you did. So
maybe in the future incorporating
those pictures and
presentation.
Um Second,
when you are talking about
your space standards
and office
space and you're getting some
costs on that. What are you
basing your cost
per square foot and your space
standard standard
for each
employee? Do
you have that
Mr.  Chair members of the committee?
No, we don't have that. We
received a um
excuse me, a cost
estimate uh again
from a single architect
uh for the office
reconfiguration and they
provided the estimate of 100 and
$50 per square
foot.
Um  Mr.  Chair, the
reason I ask
is uh do you know how
big the area
or the office is going to
be per employee that
you're going to be reconfiguring the space?
Because that would be important
to know on your $150
per square foot
remodel
how large of an area,
if it's gonna be cubicles
or if a 10 by 10
versus a eight
by eight cubicle. Um,
there's a big difference cost
there. Art offices versus
cubicles. So just
wondering if you had that
assessment done before
you got that
Mr.  Chair members of the committee?
No, we haven't. So, uh
this will cover
architectural fees
which I think would, would really
go to that point of
how big are the individual
offices going to be? How big are the
cubicles going to be that are
consolidated? So we
don't have that yet.
Um  Mr.  Chair committee,
just a recommendation that we should
probably have that first
before um
making the ask because that
could vary in
high school
and members of the committee.
Uh Thank
you for that. Um
If, if the
committee will consider funding
uh the office reconfiguration
um with
the possibility uh as
the Supreme Court came before you
a subsequent year
asking for additional funds for the
same project. If the
committee will consider that
um the, as you
all know, architecture fees
are expensive,
the court of appeals is
unable to absorb that cost
with our operating budget.
So we would just not be
able to do this project unfortunately,
if we did not receive this, this
funding. So, thank
you.
I I just wanted to add
uh to Chief Judge Atr's
comment. This is all
existing reconfiguration
of existing space. So we're not,
it's not new construction,
although yes, certainly
putting up a few walls and that sort of
thing.
Thank you for the
perfect.
Do you have any other
questions?
Thank you.
Thank you very
much,
Mr.  Chair at this point. I cede
my space here to Chief
Judge Joshua Sanchez
and Ceo Lisa Low from
the Benli County Metropolitan
Court
real quick for the committee.
Um The Burnley County Metro
Court presentation
is um underneath the Burn
Leo County Metro Court
cip in the packet.
You have to scroll all the way
down.
Thank you. Page
92.
Good morning chairman and members
of the committee. My name is Joshua
Sanchez. I am
the Chief judge of Metropolitan
Court in Bernalillo County.
With me today is our
Ceo Lisa
Lowe who's gonna be
responsible for the
presentation. I've also got
our Co
Erica our
financial specialist
Nicholas Deckler and we have
Tanya Torres who is our
facility's manager.
Uh The one thing that I just want to make
sure the committee is aware
of is Metropolitan
Court is unique because we actually
own our own building compared to the
majority of the courthouses in the
state that are owned by
the county or the state
actually own. The
facilities are in and are
in charge of maintaining all of
those. I want to make sure that
Miss Torres has a seat up here
because I know she's got a lot
of good.
Nice.
Sorry about that.
Good morning.
Our first priority involves our
parking structure which is a
multistorey building and
consists of several load bearing
columns that have shown signs
of distress, cracks and
erosion and exposed
rebar. It was determined
that there is a water drainage component
causing this distress.
We have already started the first
phase of this project. However,
based on the preliminary
estimate, the completion
of this project will cost an additional
$294,800
due to the extent of the damage this
needs to be addressed as quickly as
possible. Structural
engineers have examined the
parking structure thoroughly
and have determined that this will be a three
phase project.
It should be noted that we are
also requesting emergency
funding through the Board of Finance
to complete this critical issue.
In our building structure.
As advised by the budget
committee, we hope to go in
front of the board in December.
However, the request will include
an additional $20,000
as we have located an
additional area of erosion
in the underground parking
lot in the courthouse
that is also critical and in need of
immediate attention.
Our second priority
um includes
the heating ventilation and
air conditioning, mechanical
infrastructure including
boiler replacement.
We are seeking the replacement of
five boilers as we currently
only have two functioning
boilers. Additionally,
additionally, there are nine
HVAC units in the parking
structures, mechanical room
each continuing to burn out
components of
those nine units. There are six
operational at this
time
with that. We thank you for your
consideration for our request and your
time this morning and we stand
for any questions that you may
have.
Good morning.
Um Thank you for the pictures
that was very helpful to see
the damage and what's going
on. Um When did
you get the quotes for
hopefully this year? Priority
one priority two.
Our quote for
um
the
the parking structure was April
25th,
2024
and our second
quote
would have been April 30th
of this year.
Thank you very
much.
Any other
questions?
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you so much
for the presentation. I appreciate
it. You know, as I
looked at these pictures, you know,
II
I almost feel like is
this, is this funding
sufficient? In order to address a
parking facility
or parking.
Um, you know, and,
and so
I guess I'd like to
better understand
what type of
repairs are
being proposed.
Um, is it,
is it gonna
be,
is it gonna be more related
to, to,
uh, uh, to crack ceiling of
the concrete,
uh, or,
or are there more
structural issues
that were determined whenever
this assessment
or was an assessment done?
And, and, and
how did, how did you
determine or how was
it determined the type of repairs
that needed to
be?
Good morning?
So,
um we did have the
phase one assessment by the
structural.
So that is basically
him coming up with an assessment
of what he does, the
damage kind
of a hypothesis,
right? So phase two
is checking all of that the
materials see
that goes
three has to go
consecutively right
after all of
this is coming from the
structure.
Uh current
market rate valuations,
the actual
construction of it
for the remediation, but it
is going to include not
only from
his initial assessment,
filling in the cracks, but there
may also be a need to
add
round
to.
Thank you for that. I appreciate the
clarification. And
what's the,
what's the square footage
of the facility? And, and
do you in that
assessment? Do they have a total
number of square feet of
repairs that are gonna be
necessary
that hasn't been
completed yet? Um
It's just initial basic
assessment, but they're gonna
really get in
depth.
Uh The total square footage of the
parking structure is
approximately
including that includes
21,000 square feet
of health.
Ok. Thank you for that. I
appreciate it. And
then just, just for for
clarity, this is just the
phase one request. In
order to get
you,
we've already completed phase
one. We, we got
to
let's help
you can speak to that. Yes,
we, we  Mr.  chair
members of the committee, we completed phase
one last fiscal
year. So we got that started and
that's where the estimate was done.
Um And we
were given the information on
what we needed to move forward
with phase two and phase three, which will
be done consecutively.
So this funding request,  Mr.
chair is, is really
for phase two
and phase three,  Mr.
chair members of the committee. That is
correct.
And  Mr.  Chair, I guess my,
my only,
my only concern with this
being or phase
three as well is
you're not sure what you're gonna
find. And
so, so uh
so what I would just say is,
is as a committee, I think,
you know, for uh I
think that looking at at
what at what
phase two looks
like, um you
know, and funding enough
to, to address phase two
make sense
because I don't know if we're
sure what phase three is going to be
because that level of
detailed assessment
hasn't really been done,
especially on a parking
structure of this size,
it could be
significant as far as
the, the repairs
that are, but I
appreciate the information
and, and thank you for doing
the assessment and, and
letting that guide
you.
Thank you,
Mr.
And any other questions I
have one before. How do you have
any? Um
So one question I have
is regarding your
previous funding and there's
a 2021 appropriation
or parking system and security
upgrades. I think
that was not fully
expended and some of that was reauthorized.
Is that
correct?
Um We actually
sorry,  Mr.  Chair members
of the, he did
request reauthorization
just in case
it wasn't able to be completed.
Um However, we it's
fully been, it's been fully expended,
we were able to get it completed by
June. Ok. So
there's no balance from
that.
Thank you. And I, I think I, I guess
I agree with  Mr.  Honey. I just, I worry
that when it comes to
phase three, you're not gonna have enough
funding. Well,
I guess we'll see what phase two
brings if funded
and
any other questions from the
committee.
I'm sorry, can you hear me? Thank
you for coming to present
today. Um I just
had a question on your presentation
with um where you're stating that
you requested an emergency loan
from the Board of Finance.
Where, where is that in the
process? And what amount did
you apply for for that?
Mr.  Chair members of the committee?
We're actually in the process of filling
out that application. We have not
submitted it yet. We're
anticipating that we will
be on the schedule for the December
hearing and
what would be the amount that you would
be looking for for that?
So it would be
about, what
is that
300
or
because it's the two, the
294 that we're asking for and
the additional 20,000 for
the other damage that we
have found.
Thank you for the clarification.
Thank you.
Thank you. That brings up another question for
me then um so
if you do get that funding from the Board
of Finance, you will not need this
funding.
Um
Mr.  Chair members of the committee,
we are seeking an emergency
loan. So, should
we be
awarded a loan, then we would
still be coming forward to ask
for the funding so that we can repay
the loan? If by
some chance we were awarded a
grant, of course, we would be
rescinding our, our, our
ask for this priority.
Perfect. Thank you for that. And I think
just stay in communications with us.
Um If we do fund this
project, we'll need to make sure that
there's language in the bill
to and make sure
that it states something about repaying
a loan. Um because otherwise
you might get some issues with that
language but just
keep us informed. Understood. Thank
you.
Any other questions from the
committee?
Then you have a number two request,
right?
Yes. Our number two request
was for our HVAC unit
or for HVAC for heating
ventilation. Um
We are asking
1.894 million
for
that.
Thank you. Did you want to go into any details
on that? The only thing
I wanted to add, this is the second
time that we've come forward before the
board.  Mr.  Chair members of the committee
asking for this funding.
We were not awarded this funding
last year, last
fiscal year. So we're seeking
replacement of five boilers that
we have, we only have
two that are currently functioning.
We also have nine HVAC
units and of those nine, only
six are functioning at this
point.
Thank you. Any questions from the
committee?
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair.
Um
So the
the units that are not
functioning
or are
those units impacting your
ability to utilize the
facility or
or have you,
what kind of remediation
efforts have you done in order
to maintain use of
the facility?
Mr.  Chair members of the committee, I
know Tanya has a lot more that she can
expand on this. However,
we're utilizing what we have
available and we're
continuously performing
maintenance on the
units that we have available.
However, with only some of them
working, um
the system has to continually
work harder and
there's a greater chance for those ones
to fail as well.
But Tanya, I'm not sure if you want
to elaborate.
Add  Mr.  Chairman
of the committee, we've had
to divert
classrooms to other
locations is an
educational center,
six classrooms,
two separate units. He
pull that one of those
is down. Um So we're
just making do trying to squeeze
them in one half of the building.
So it takes a lot of
coordination, but we
also have one of the units
controls, the
public lobby
and parking
office there.
It's been 100 degrees
in those rooms. And I mean, there's just
nothing
just
for now. And
as she said, we try to
maintain and take parts
from others to, to
get up and
running.
Thank you,  Mr.  Chair. Thank you for
that information.
Um
Are
I know we've talked about this in some of the
previous presentations and I'm sure we'll
talk about this throughout the rest of the
week. But what other
opportunities do you have to,
to be able to
secure funding for,
for these types of
critical
needs at,
at your facility?
Uh And I asked that question
because I know that you're talking about
an emergency loan through the State
Board of Finance specifically for the
number one priority.
But I'm wondering, is the
number two priority something that
potentially also
needs to be
secured through an emergency
loan? Uh
The other, the other
component would be
um I know that
that DFA has
opportunities for
for uh requesting
uh funding
for, for, for
certain, for certain
types of projects. And
I'm just wondering if, if you
all have looked at
because
this impacts your facilities,
other opportunities to be able
to your funding uh
outside of capital outlay
because this process sometimes
number one doesn't fund, as you
mentioned, this is, you know, this
is a second year
and then number two,
it's critical because if you lose
another unit, you're,
you're almost not going to
be able to
keep that facility
operating.
Mr.  chair members of the committee. Thank
you so much for that question. And you're
absolutely right. That is a huge
concern for us um, with
our aging building, you know, we're
in the 20th year,
everything is falling
apart. We're constantly
having issues with our, um just
maintaining the facility in
general. Um I
do not believe we have, we haven't
talked about going
forward to the Board of Finance
to pursue
an emergency loan for the
HVAC unit. And that's something that we
can definitely talk about.
Um, it
is a critical need and,
you know, as far as
our existing budget, our
general fund,
there's not any room for us
to absorb anything anymore.
Just now having this
building and
recognizing all
the problems that we're starting
to incur,
we're just kind of
trying to make do with
what we have and try
to make all of the
repairs that we can as
we're going and what
we're really trying to do is just to maintain
everything just to get proper maintenance
regularly so that we don't have
things breaking down. We
do have an on site
facilities team
who thankfully
are very knowledgeable in a lot of
areas and can make repairs on their
own. So that's kind of
been keeping us afloat.
But, um, recognizing
that our building is aging
and we're continuously having
these issues. Um, it is a huge
concern for, for Metro Court in
general just with the
maintaining of the
entire facility as it
is
Mr.  Chair. Thank you. Um
A quick question.
A lot of your units are down.
You're doing a great job trying to
figure out how close are
you to one more unit being down?
That the building cannot be used.
How close, where are
we on that? Do
more of these units,
one more these units
because it seems to me we
have nine and you
are out.
The math is gonna be somewhere where
the building can't be used.
Have you done that assessment
or
we're
members of the, we
actually had walk
through boats right now
to get at
least one for you
back up. Um
It
may
another unit in
there.
We're so happy you guys
reauthorized our rope gripper
funds because that has
really come into
play.
Um
You know, I don't know that it
would really,
it, it may shut us down.
We're just, we're running out of
space for those areas that are
occupied.
Um I, I can't
really speak
to what would make that
happen because each area
controls a zone of the
350,000
ft parking structure.
I think if anything like Lisa said,
we make, do you'd have to
shuffle people and find room
for
elsewhere?
Any other questions for the
committee?
I just have one quick question.
Um I know you received HVAC
funding in 2023
for the control system.
Um Was that control system
completely? Um that was that
project completely done? Um
I know that's not replacing HVAC,
but what was that
money fully expect?
Uh  Mr.  Chair members
of the committee, we actually
82% complete
and expanded on that project.
We're looking at
the meas HPV control
zero because we
do also have lighting controls
um that we are
projecting to be done
at the end of the. So
we're
making.
Thank you. And then you mentioned the
reauthorization of the electrical
grippers or
the elevator grippers? Sorry. Um
Was that just reauthorized
to a different purpose or was
that? And so that was to
the HVAC system,
correct? We've, we've
done a lot of HVAC
system
and so how much, how much
was reauthorized do
that?
Was,
it was 319,000.
And so far we have
expended most of it. We only
have 29,000 remaining
of that.
Um Thank you for that. And I, I could
ask you please update
CPM S with all of
all of these, I know that,
um, the, the
parking, um,
system and security upgrade, that one
still shows 230
reauthorized. And so we
need to make sure that, that shows it fully
expended that there was
none to the new
appropriation. Make sure that it
all aligns and
matches.
Um, just to
underscore
Wesley's. We,
these are funny.
I thought it was just you, but it's
affected me too.
Um, Just to underscore
Wesley's point. Oh, there we
go. Um
Having those updates
in CP MS
allows us to
give our bosses
as they're considering these
requests the most current
information about where the project is
at. And if it's like
showing that money
hasn't been expended
or we don't
have any of the kind of qualitative
updates that's
like all we know and
can show them. So
it helps support
your current request if
those projects are
up to date and so that
you're making progress, which is
great. Thanks.
Understood. Thank
you.
Any other
questions?
All right. Thank
you.
Thank you so
much.
It looks like we are running ahead of
schedule. Is are there any
other um, questions
or anything that, that A O
wants to talk
about or, or present
or?
No? They got
them.
Sounds good. Alright. Well then we
will I guess break
right now. I I don't think
dps is here and
so we'll probably break
till lunch till one o'clock
and we'll come back at, at
0 45.
