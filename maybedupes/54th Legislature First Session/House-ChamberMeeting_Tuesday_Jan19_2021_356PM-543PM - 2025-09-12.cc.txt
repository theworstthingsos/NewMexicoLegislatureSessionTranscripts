Thank you Mr speaker
One we do not have a copy of
what was passed out of out of
A whole debate over just a
little bit so we come in its
look at it says it in the bill
is on line and amendment I just
think of we decide as a paper
Disagree from what came out of
What was what was introduced
house bill one in the first
committee in the.
I guess it's more of a a
statement that I put in a
question and that is I I
understood that the governor
why now we're also having this
in house bill one.
Mr speaker does the channel
eighty of them being a bad
A service speculative than me
reiterate the question for the
gentle lady
The the bill that we saw earlier
that was introduced was now
I from what we heard and
Legislative Council earlier this
week and and then the governor's
a difficult emergency
declaration we understood that
little confusing could you
explain that discrepancy or that
change Mr speaker.
just adopted reflects no
amendments to the text of the
bill before the body now is
identical to the tax that was in
the Appropriations Committee
okay so thank you for that Mr
speaker and gentle lady I just a
second this is not what I saw
earlier in in and I can
I'm confused I I was of the
understanding that the security
and military presence was going
to either be paid by the
governor through executive order
Council services who had to
make this determination
obviously did not have the funds
to be able to pay for that so if
if there if you can make an
And now why we're having this in
the appropriation house bill
one.
Mr speaker and the gentleman
from San Juan.
Emergency orders do not
The one point four eight four.
As for public safety and the six
hundred and seventy four
thousand four hundred put
the gentleman from San Juan the
security costs are specific to
securing the capital on the
capitol building is the
Legislative Council meeting so
let me ask a different question
concerning the payment apart
from.
House bill one.
Council services administrator
hadn't made that determination.
without Legislative Council
Which is why I understood why
the governor filed that
emergency declaration so she
could spend up to seven hundred
fifty thousand dollars at one
Mr speaker and the gentleman
from San Juan those two figures
the one for public safety and
the one for military affairs for
The Legislative Council Service
funding.
understand it's in this bill at
this point Mr speaker and gentle
lady we were told that that was
something that was completely
within the purview of
Legislative Council services and
Legislative Council a vote and
approval I'm not suggesting that
this is this appropriation of
money I'm not saying that I'm
just saying up to this point
owned by the legislature and
Legislative Council did not
approve this in advance these
decisions were made in advance
that we're funding something
that Mr speaker and gentle lady
that should have been approved
by a vote and Legislative
Council and not by any
once again Mister speaker jelly
I'm just referring back to
previous Legislative Council
meeting earlier this week for I
brought up this exact point that
authorized this so with that Mr
speaker and and gentle lady I
just wanted to once again
reiterate my concern that we
approval of the legislature at
least of the house of how would
have to pass the Senate as well
but up to this point we have not
had what would have been
appropriate
but I I just once again want to
express that this process was
not done
in the manner of which
