Yeah.
The.
Okay
thank you mister chair I feel
like I got real right now
all right just getting mr
we'd make everybody left
me back contract so mister
representative again like I was
saying this so i'm i'm following
up on what representative girl
said we're all we're
you know in toughest mexico and
i'm closer to all parcels and I
am telling.
And so you'd be going through
three different states and the
check rewardings foot would you
know it's just a red flag just
where you know texas might not
have th.
So you got this guy this this
you know person that's on their
own enough in in is world
comment and then that anything
mr representative the other
thing is is just looking at the
at the logistics of when we're
hearing this and just that we
know that the feds are little
leaks I was reading that article
that.
There.
Give me a second role for.
But anyway.
So anyway the forest are
dreamed crucials rule is moved
forward it's just in a month or
so
and I think what what words me
about the bill is of course we
all care about safety that's
important
but the same time it's been that
the feds are coming out and make
it rather than a checker board
we have ten states doing the two
men rule and maybe others.
You know whatever those numbers
are but matters in this this is
to be a fellow rule
where everything's is is is unit
in unison.
I just give it as example.
States and so that that's just
that's one of my commission the
other one to safety unit in.
I would imagine.
Well as.
Monito.
Is that something that.
Some of the questions that you
had imag.
Do they have a camera and i'm
just I don't know the answe.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that we're not left.
Without the federal role.
After take it out will we'll
have the discretion to do that
and that also can be in.
Put in a discretionary role for
someone to decide.
That.
But it doesn't always work it
loses
it it's.
And your cameras will.
Yes mister chairman and
representative there is there's
a four facing camera that all of
the motives of required to have
my law and we do have an inward
camera but it it does not affect
the operation of that train it
tells you what happens when
there's a situation.
Talk about
automation or positioning
control in our
trip the meisure I tell you
right now I had an incident last
week last week every every
cruise you would talk.
I came I I departable in late at
night came up and over down he's
been.
If the train was coming down it
was in automatic control we came
up there there was a red signal
at the bottom there's a flashing
signal and yellow the train did
not slow down didn't slow down I
waited to the last not an last.
The train did not slow it down
my conductor was in a panic you
looked at me and he says you
want me to put it emergency as a
distance.
That train and I don't know if
you'd ever been.
And stop to train the signal
forty two m.
Tree it would have gone into the
red signal.
The.
Both true members are there to
support each other one question
you is this not right or what
about this.
Fishing and all that.
The.
We are going to.
Went through a control pla.
Only on said.
The dispatch remainly p.
Yeah.
Next station and.
Was against the real it was
like.
Stop the.
Yeah.
But it wasn't for that conduct
because nothing it should have
worked pick that up
so this happens every night
every night it's all.
Very good think you know it's
you know we all have or expect.
Representative.
Well smart tv.
Okay
but anyway I just think
there's nothing.
I I think my.
Other than that do you have
anything for short lines or is
there anything in your building
defined short line differently.
In comparison.
Mr chair.
Really coming up forty five days
at this time it seems favorable
at all.
You're not no longer worried
about those checker board
effects.
Sat down next to me at one of
her conferences and we discussed
the same.
When he gets replaced this guy.
Unfortunately it's
so we're going to get put in a
position it's more favorable.
One of the.
And that's what happened a few
years ago we're well on a way to
get the stateme.
Sta.
No they're not going to get on
the tr.
I'm a relatively land.
We talked about this.
The.
Um especially.
Have lost our rules in the fact
that.
We've been through a couple of
the president.
Yeah.
Today.
Technolog.
So in order to make.
Yeah.
Why we are where we are with.
Thank you mister chairman and
represented no they cannot
remove the control.
All they can do is be stopped by
that system.
The other railroads like that.
A little bit.
No.
Yeah.
The.
Well mr chair and representative
obviously they're you're making
a hypothetical if there's one
person on there yet that train
would continue continually go
there's a learner on there.
The.
So.
So I mean that the reason for
that re.
The.
Yeah.
Yes
last year we could not come to
an agreement.
The.
Yeah.
We are under the road with.
We go through a series of steps
but we came to the inst.
Maybe sort of decisions you'll
get sick time to something.
Changes in.
And it came down.
It's two thirty to worry when
they agreed okay.
The.
So that's why we're here we're
not like a regular union we're
not ask.
Now on a state level we're going
to try to g.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have.
I'd like to explain.
The.
I really do believe in the.
Thank you mister also you know
it's important for.
So my considera.
Near my district scene that
they're against it and I see
that has a spills are down
seventy percent and your
relevance are gone.
Mission I received
I think it's just something and
with on top of that in the short
period.
A decision that they printed
out.
For policies and safety.
Still hoping you'll find on the
bill.
Thank you mister chairman
because of the commi.
With the passage of senate bill
said.
Goods everyone here is.
That was.
Yeah.
Over forty f.
Three years and twenty
twentieth.
They not receive.
And their families are living
out of near the pocket so not
only is this issue
important for actual.
This also food security as well
as a early child and and it
children's welfare issue
because.
The.
Yeah.
The.
And mister chair.
It's a great question.
Right now we are.
It's not unique.
So yeah we we have been prudent
we have been a little.
Yeah.
My pension.
Thank you misses.
Yeah.
Fi.
Yeah.
Kind of the benefits that were
offering we have checking steps.
Provide that.
You just meant for.
So i'm not going to take
advantage of this but I return.
My question.
Mr.
You think about it l.
Yeah.
I i.
Will disclosure I am not a
reception
I hear something mister chair
represent I think we are too
conversation.
I agree with you.
So bendit
problem that we're going to have
professionally.
And so I have a couple
questions.
You know how you.
Does each member pay the same
amount.
The.
Standing per real program by
itself.
Exactly the same.
So mister
this just works like inter.
Pension when you g.
Young wall there and money if
more people are taking out.
And so the we're going to have
to
hard look at this.
To make some tough decisions now
the further we kick th.
To recover.
So we fix.
I think mister represent I think
our problems were having that.
And this you know we see this
increase is is more about.
Lower.
So it's just I think we're gonna
have to I prefer.
To make small equipment as we go
year by year.
Because.
Five years old.
It's jacket.
It allows you to be more nimble
for your decisions I would love
to see the do that
because it.
Um
I think we as a state have got
to get it in together.
And I have seen cubicle after
cubicle after cuba call empty
two thirds of.
So you're never going to fill
this fine if you don't have the
jobs
so if you don't if you don't
build host positions you're also
hurting yourself in peri.
There's no there's no money
coming in it only gets funded.
I think that's what's killing us
is is labor participation
we need to take this.
Charge all this.
Sixty five seventy employees and
tickets that bud.
And attract people in pen.
Marginal.
This.
Yeah.
This.
The.
Your.
The.
And then
h.
And other report instead of
obama.
That they had used national.
But it raised questions.
And they should be taken to
account in.
So I I real.
That's going to happen.
Yeah.
And so we came up with this.
But the desk out of wife.
And so this memorable is saying
less.
Equalized.
Yeah.
The multiply in particular.
When the big drivers.
It said those are the types of
things that we person ****
should be.
Yeah.
Mister chier repres.
So
what happens.
Right over time and and the
beaber started to or different
core horse and basically in all
of the cool horse para benefits
were higher than th.
And compensation.
New phones as one is
predominantly women and that the
beneficiary in that fine will
make over the.
Lesser benefit we have less of
benefits they will earn less
significantly.
Yes.
Research.
Yeah.
We're just in general it makes a
difference which find you are
yeah yeah.
Over time I don't know that it
was all.
It desperate to but it has been
in terms of benefits since
nineteen fifty.
And and it's not unnecessarily
in terms of how it happened
we and that's I mean they could
look at how did this this happen
is that the question of how did
happen the state h.
And one of them is a dominantly
woman and that's fine the
beneficiary's receipts.
You can look at what how do that
happen but is that okay
in just in terms of ex.
How these two first in which the
one that it offers this
predemically women will.
What we did was that we're not
so much focusing that is that
that exists okay the foot there
is.
There is a disparate what we're
saying is that an equity is.
Is more for justification terms
and urgency to d.
Okay so they could trip
well we're not seeing is when
that's most territory combined.
Can we fix the disparages
independe.
Yeah because that the disparate
is that they are without regard.
The educational system that the
beneficiaries in that fund will
make less than benefits.
But there is an urgency to do
something about.
Well sorted out mister chair but
it just I think what we're
talking here
i'm looking here mister chair
the all these different
funds that we're talking about.
You can see the contribution
rates you can see the the
funding periods of their but
there.
Your funding racials are
anywhere from on the law and
fifty two point nine percent to.
When you start looking at
at what time employee
contribution is and that varies
any.
Or the employer those range
anywhere from ten perce.
To twenty five almost twenty six
percent so each phone depending
on where.
Negotiate with your employer
those particu.
Their funds are going to have
either shortfall.
And their employer come
contribution rate is twenty five
point six five and so i'm i'm
just I think that experience i'm
obviously.
I'm just trying to understand
the understands
this is as part of what the
study is to figure this out
ready over understand represent
i'm trying to understand this
myself so so.
The steady
I think is is just looking at
all those things.
But I do know that would pair
out that there are mor.
The secure representatives
trying to clarify.
Meeting potatoes of your
discussion is that of the study
is that correct improv.
I don't want to say that.
In looking at.
Be that right now.
The beneficiary.
Now will make significantly more
in retirement benefit.
Ultimately.
He was teacher when last questi.
Because there's no.
Yeah.
Thank you.
In terms of already
with.
Right from the start.
Who were equating mister.
And
so mister chair
problematic is no
effective I had a a large cover
republican constituents then
they should be help me get
elected because I was going up
against rocker up democrats you
know my community and that's
that was I was burn my platform
the kind of get rid of
corrupt democrats and in my in
my.
But
I also realized.
With.
Budget committees
the senate financ.
C.
Where this issue a parity
was raised.
What would always
come up.
Well
you teachers don't have good
retirement plans because of all
the time that i've been up here
and actually we're talking about
some heavy.
These were these are kind.
Eighteen years into my.
Finance committees and there
are position words well the
reason that you.
Lack of decent.
The.
How I w.
So they kind of.
The thing is that these heavy.
The.
We're really kind of
litera.
The.
The leadership was the employees
including their the unions
really ca.
A all rounded by.
Renowned.
The employees are
entirely planned in terms of the
same employees.
And
the you know mister chair so
that's been problematic
and it hasn't been till recently
where.
We've been trying to make the.
You know but at least.
Remain and position that there
are many because you haven't
asked for the whole package.
Now we're seeing the
consequences of that having a
really around it dynami.
Work force.
You know and.
Because you know and i'll give.
They are.
They have that kind of
attraction to seen our you
evolve.
And.
Me personally I was a you know
after I kind of
ha.
Kind of a community development
terms of communi.
Other nationals other projects.
Politics.
So I have to you know that's not
good organizing our community if
you're going to fight against
the corruption
so.
I got the teaching bug when in
the teaching I took a twenty
five thousand dollars.
Listed a broker after I left.
And I was real successful and I
did it right there in the force
communities but I had that base
I had that's where influence.
And
so I took their current day I
started teaching that.
It was of occasion I found out
what those kid.
Actually become.
You know that's what I was in a
wonder.
Function that was happening
like.
So mister chair
that's been the problem I see in
terms of wide.
With the retirement.
The.
And as legislat.
Of how we
know
do the best that we c.
Retaining our educators and
developing another core group.
To fill them when that old poor
is starting.
So I think it's gonna be a real
task mister
that we really seri.
Work force.
And the retirement plan.
But I think we need.
Where we have indiv.
A dedicated year and I do this
process.
Yeah.
Will have to be a according to
the constitution.
So I just wanted to.
Yeah.
I.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
