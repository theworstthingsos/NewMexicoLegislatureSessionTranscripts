If we can get everybody, I
think we're ready to get started.
We're not too far behind
schedule now. And
so, uh, deputy
Director, Senna
Mr Hicks Connor,
uh, welcome. And I think
you're gonna talk about rules
and rule
making. >> Uh
Good afternoon, Mr Chair,
good afternoon committee. Uh,
we are going to talk about
rulemaking. Um I
do again want to just
introduce,
uh, not our
newest but one of our
newest, our second to newest,
uh, policy analyst,
Connor, uh
Hicks
and, uh, he's,
he's up here to make
sure I don't mess it up too bad.
Um He also, I,
I want to give him some c I want to give him
credit. He actually produced
the report that you have the
review on the healthy school meals.
This is part of his uh
policy topic area.
And so he went ahead and,
uh, did the, the
rule review. He's also
going to be looking into the school
meals, uh program
over the interim and
as director ornament
mentioned yesterday,
um I do want to say
for the record and, and I, I hope
this doesn't sound too bad. We,
we wanted to present these
rules to you before.
Uh, you heard from the
secretary there was
some, some scheduling conflicts
and so we, we flip flopped.
So you may have gotten some of your answers
already. Maybe you've been able to
answer some of those questions by
now. But this will give
you an opportunity to get a
pretty, pretty detailed
look at what the rules are asking.
I do want to say that
the first rule, the healthy
universal school meals. And by the way, we're
behind tab nine
in your binder if you're not already
there. Uh
This is a proposed
rule and
um I always feel as a former
policy director at PE D
and responsible for
rulemaking at the agency
during that time
that um
these are open to
changes, right? These,
this is a proposal that gets
put forward out to the
public public,
the the department receives
feedback and comments
and then obviously they're,
they're able to make changes
or not, you know, as it
as it may be.
So, uh the first
rule is the healthy universal
schools meal. Um
This was proposed in April
23rd if
adopted. The proposed effective
date is July 1
2024.
Um As I mentioned,
there's a comment period
that usually culminates
with a public hearing for each
rule. And so for this particular
rule, you, uh the
public has until May
29th,
May 29th, 2024
to provide uh
feedback,
formal feedback to the department
about the rule, there is a
hearing for this particular
rule on May
29th from 130 to
230 at the Public
Education Department. So just so that
the public knows that if they
want to submit feedback
through the rule feedback,
email and that's listed on this form
as well, they can do that
or they can show up at the
meeting and say
things.
Ok. So the
first I'll, I'm gonna go
over most of the details.
Um It's a pretty lengthy rule.
There's a lot of requirements
uh
about the meal program
and I'll try to cover as many of them as
possible. And then obviously, uh Connor
and I will, will answer questions as
needed. So the rule
itself is to establish
this, this the
healthy Universal school meals
program
as uh provided
in, in laws 2023 chapter
30 Senate Bill four.
This is a bill you all
passed
and it establishes the certification
criteria of meal quality
improvement requirements
for school food authorities
to receive state reimbursements
for the provision of school
meals to all enrolled
students. And
so essentially what the rule does
is it provides some a list of
requirements, two sets of requirements
actually by which
schools are then eligible to
receive state
reimbursements. And I think it's important
that we clarify right away
that if a school is operating
a federal meals program,
they're receiving
federal reimbursements,
right? So if your, your school
qualifies for a
community eligibility provision
and your students are already receiving
free meals. That
school continues to do that.
Your state program
essentially back fills the
portion for which
schools are not reimbursed
if they don't qualify for that community
eligibility. And you have
students who are, you know, are
technically full
uh price paid
students. The state
is reimbursing schools
for those students, right?
Not those that are already
receiving uh federal
reimbursements.
So in order to qualify
for the program, there are one
of two levels that a school
can be. Level one
and I'll say this right away. Level
one you'll see has
a long list of requirements,
not all of them are required.
There are a few pieces that are,
you can sort of pick and choose
which requirement to meet. And
I'll mention, I know we talked a little bit this
morning about growing your own
food. There's,
that's an option and it's
not necessarily a requirement.
I'm gonna speak to that. So
to meet the level one
compliance, if you
will, you have to
do a few things.
No less than 50%
of reimbursable national
school lunch program and school breakfast
program, meals.
Uh They
had to be freshly
prepared,
add an on-site kitchen prepared
by the school food authority.
So in, in
order to, to
qualify for level one, they have to
be freshly prepared at an on-site
facility,
they have school food authorities
which are essentially your school districts and
charter schools participating in the
program have to
offer at least three items
on a weekly basis from
New Mexico farms, ranches or
food businesses.
School food
authorities have to adhere
to one of the
following. Either
they have to no less than
50% of schools
have to grow food on
campus with
seasonal incorporation of that
food into meals
or
no less than 50% of
schools in a school. Food authority
shall have cafeterias with
print or digital resources,
promoting locally sourced
nutrition education.
So just to clarify
or, or emphasize,
you can half of your schools
either have to grow food and
incorporate them into meals
or at least
half of your schools have to
have some school local
locally
sourced
resources about locally
sourced food and we'll get
in. There's a little bit of some,
some interesting language usage
there, there's a little bit of un you
know, we're not clear exactly
what that means.
And so, but I did want to clarify
that you can grow your food
or you can provide information
about locally grown food. That's
the way we've interpreted
it.
So that's one of the two choices
in that particular
area. School food authorities shall
also adhere to the to the below
performance measures. And
so all food
authorities have to do this. These are
required all
students grades uh
kindergarten through five
shall have up to 20 minutes
of seat time, not
including time spent
walking to or from
class.
All food authorities shall have
share tables where
foods can, where folks can put
food that are not, that's not
eaten,
unopened, allowable
food.
Schools shall have a system for
monthly donation of
unused food to students or
community based organizations.
So those three are
requirements.
The next uh
requirement is another one
of those either or
so you have to have at least
one of the following performance
measures. One
is that all students K
through five are offered
recess before lunch, at
least two days during the
school week
or at least
50% of schools in the
in the school. Food Authority shall
engage in plate waste
studies on a
quarterly basis
or at least
50% of schools in a school for
authority shall have a composting
program. So you
heard
recess before
lunch, you
heard plate waste
studies and
you heard composting
programs in order
to be eligible for level one,
you have to do one of those
three
things
on on a quarter
and at least a quarterly basis.
School food authorities shall actively
engage students and families
in food and nutrition services
through formal processes
to incorporate feedback. So
this is a provision to
to engage the community in
feedback about your your food
services.
Um
For the next requirement. Again,
there's gonna be four, you're gonna hear
food authorities have to do at
least two of them.
The first one is impaneling
an advisory council
so that you can have student
and family input.
The second is uh
providing uh students
and families an opportunity to provide
formal feedback on meal
quality.
The third is to have
feedback on menu
design.
And the fourth is that schools
would conduct taste
tests for both
breakfast and lunch. So you heard
four things,
an advisory council
input on meal quality,
input on menu
design
and taste tests
and school food authorities
have to do at least two of
them to
qualify to be eligible
through level
one.
Again, the next one is, is also a
sort of a menu of
options. There
are you're gonna hear four
pieces
uh and they have to do at least
two of them. Schools
shall incorporate food and nutrition into
education. I'm
sorry, nutrition education
into teacher and staff
professional development. On
a quarterly
basis,
they shall monthly include
culinary or nutrition education
during the school day or
during out of school time at
all. Elementary and secondary
schools
they shall ensure that middle
and high school students engage in
food preparation,
breakfast, lunch or
snacks
and that all schools shall have
access to nutrition education
activities on a quarterly
basis. Again, you
heard four things
professional development for teachers
and staff
education for students
during or out of school
time
that middle and high school students actually
engage in preparing
food
or that all schools have
access to nutrition education
activities on a quarterly basis.
Four things you have
to do two of
them.
So that's level one.
It's a lot. You, you see
that there are a lot of requirements
but with some flexibility to
pick and choose how you meet those,
those requirements
to be eligible for level
one. I'm gonna talk a little
bit about level two and
just to be clear,
there's no distinction that
you can either meet level one
or you can meet level two
if you meet either of them. They mean
the same thing you
qualify for full reimbursement
from the state program.
Level two though,
doesn't have options in
order to meet level two,
you have to do certain
things. The first is that
75% or
greater of our
meals have to be freshly
prepared at an on-site
kitchen.
The second is
that all schools shall
offer more than four
items weekly
from a New Mexico Farm Rancher
food business. Again,
level one was three items. This
is four,
no less than 50% of schools
shall grow on campus.
Um Again,
growing food on campus for
incorporation, no
less than 50. Whereas for
level one, it was at least
50
no less than 50% of schools
have to have a schoolwide educational
program that provides nutrition
education. All of
those are requirements for
level two
eligibility.
And then finally all
school food authorities
shall adhere to
all students uh shall
have up to 20 minutes of seat time
for lunch. There should
be shared tables
and they should school shall have a system
for weekly or daily donation
of unused food to students or
community-based organizations.
Again, level two is much
shorter. But in order
to be eligible for a
level two,
certification, essentially
you have to do a school food authority
has to do all of those
things. Ok. So
you've got two levels.
Both of them mean the same thing that
you are now eligible to
receive your full
reimbursement for the state
from the state, for the school lunch
program
if I if
you fail to meet those
requirements,
um
essentially what happens and I and
I could get into the language here. But to be
honest, if
you're not already familiar with
the reimbursement rates
for federal
free, reduced
and paid lunches,
it can get kind of complicated. But
the bottom line is, if you're not
compliant,
you only get reimbursed
at the paid student
rate, which is a lower rate
per student than the
free rate, right.
So even if you're not
compliant with all of this schools will
receive some reimbursement from
the state for
their, for their meals,
but not the full
free lunch reimbursement.
So they, they get some money but
not enough probably to cover the
meals if they're not compliant with the
requirements.
So that's the rule itself.
Uh, I want to point out a few
issues that we as staff,
uh, determined for you.
Um I'm gonna go ahead and, and,
and skip to uh if
you're on page four of our,
of our review a
definition and we've heard this
already, the pe D is receiving
public comments from uh
on their website and they post
update those regularly.
We flag this for you that
the term freshly prepared
meals is not
defined in the rule nor
is it defined in statute. So
there's some ambiguity about what that
might mean. And we've
heard we've seen public comments
already that folks in
the field are also asking what, what
does that mean exactly? How do we meet
that requirement?
We talk a little bit about c
time and recess
requirements,
right? Um Those
of you and I was an elementary school
principal. I
tried to do this
thing with recess before lunch and it
did seem to help with. There's this
understanding that
kids don't want to eat,
uh They don't want to eat all their food
because they just want to rush out to recess.
And so if you give them some time for
recess ahead of time. You let
them come in to eat afterwards.
Maybe they're not in such a rush and they
eat more food.
Right. Probably
work for some, maybe not for
others. But that's what the,
but that's what the requirement is
here.
Um,
the seat time again is trying
to make sure that students have enough
time to actually eat the
food that they're provided.
What we point out here is
that there's really
no um
statutory
provisions
that relate
to being able to, to
dictate how much time
kids or when they go to
recess or how
much time they spend for
lunch.
Um Again,
uh for the on campus
growing of food, there's,
there's no language in statute that makes
campus grown food a
component of the school meals
program nor does
the section authorizing Pe D's
promulgation of rules for
the program, make mention of such
activities. Again, it's
not a, it's not a, a
requirement,
they have other options. We
just point out here that statute doesn't
really address
that.
Um
Let's see here,
there were some questions as I said
about the language that
directs uh school
food authorities to have
locally sourced
nutrition
education. Uh
We point out here that the language
is ambiguous as to whether the
educational materials need to
be from local sources
or that the materials
should be about locally
sourced food. I think we
can make some assumptions that it's about
locally sourced food it seems like that's
the point. It's just a little
ambiguous in me. You know, the department
may want to look at that in terms of uh
clean
up
the membership on the f
School Food Authority
Advisory Council lists four
performance measures.
Uh two of which must
be um
must be followed to comply with the
rule. It doesn't,
the rule doesn't specify
who should be on that council.
So that, that could, could
result in some uneven
uh implementation.
Schools could kind of pick and choose
who's on that council. Uh
Again, maybe this is just a
clean up or technical issue
that the department may wish to,
to address so that
uh school districts, school food
authorities have some clarity around that
issue.
Um Somebody
mentioned composting again, those
are, that's one of the options.
There's no language in the, in
the um statute
that specifies the
requirement for composting.
Uh Let me just point that out
here. So uh
Mr Chair, I can continue to go
through the rest of the rules or I can
stand for questions on this
particular rule first. If there
are any, whichever you'd
prefer,
let's do it. Rule by rule.
People are telling me
then stay
focused on, on one
individual happy to do
it.
Representative
>> where
thank you Mr Chair. Um
Thank you so much for
this. Um I
have, OK. So
there's
uh levels. What
do we know
what's the purpose for the
two levels? If both of them will get
fully reimbursed. What, why,
why, why be one or the
other? >> Mr Chair Representative
Mina about Moya uh This is the
point at which I forgot to
say that pe
D is also here
in case in case we need to
defer to them for some questions. I
believe that the difference
is it provides some
school districts and flexi school
food authorities, some some flexibility
as to how they meet the
requirements. And so
you can choose AAA smaller
set of requirements, but
they're a little bit uh
maybe harder to meet
whereas the other requires
um
more requirements, but
you have some flexibility in which ones
you can choose. And so I think it's just a
initial of
flexibility.
>> Um Thank you, Mr Chair. Yeah,
I, I don't, I don't understand
there and maybe they can give
me a little more clarity. I just don't
see, I don't see
like why go level two if
you meet the lesser requirements,
like why? Like
um no, if it, if it
all gets reimbursed to me,
it's this kind
of
goes against the intent
of this bill.
The bill was
trying to take care of food
insecurity for so
many of our students
and giving
those that don't qualify,
they're not title one schools, you know, they
don't qualify for the fed dollars. They
don't do anything else but they still have
students that are food insecurity
that there's still, there's still a lot of people
that don't have food at
home. That was the purpose
for this. And now we're telling these
districts that they have
to jump through
all of these hoops or they
will not get
reimbursed
and they have to
compost and they have
to, you know, like they
like, yeah, I mean,
and there's, it,
it frustrates
me. It, it, uh, you're,
you're taking the intent
of what the, the
law was
and
watering it down to
where you're now you have
more unfunded mandates
because we're, they're not gonna get as much
money as it's gonna take, to be able
to, to, to manage
growing your own food, to
go, uh, to, to composting
to doing all this stuff. Those
are, those are full time employees
that are gonna have to manage these kind
of things and the money that
they're gonna get reimbursed is not
gonna cover that. So now
we have districts that are
already
at a deficit like
this district we're in right now,
what, 9.5
million. And we're
telling them in order to get reimbursed
to provide free meals,
they have to jump through hoops or they will
not, but they
have to provide all of these things
that are gonna cost more money and
more money and more money.
And now we're putting them deeper in
the hole. It's,
it's, it frustrates me and I
know it's not you,
but it
just, it, it frustrates me
a
lot
>> others.
Representative Garrett,
>> thank >> you, Mr Chair.
Thank you. I did
cafeteria duty
for three years for a school with
1100 kids.
And so it's like
the size of the school,
the age group matters.
Just one quick question
is also like
school shall conduct
taste tests for both breakfast
and lunch. I mean, you could
have three people do the
taste test.
Uh It's just
interesting.
I think it's a little bit too much now.
I understand what Senator Brandt
talked about
farming.
I, I just think it's a little bit
too much. That's all. Thank
you.
You
know,
>> Senator ST,
>> sorry.
Uh Thank you Mr
Chairman
as a uh frustrated
farmer myself.
I was actually in future
farmers of America. Uh,
when I was in high
school, I love to
grow things
but not everybody is like
that. So
this idea
that for this
number two districts
are required to grow
part of their own
food.
So did the pe
D consider
the tools they would need
the cost of seeds
which are high, the cost of
bedding plants which are even
higher, the
shovels, the watering
and what happens in the
summer? Uh When
no one is there?
So is there
any flushing out
of this requirement?
It's just, it's so
bizarre. I did talk to
the secretary on his way out
and he mentioned that,
um, they had help in making
this rule by,
I don't know, the farm to
table people or someone
like that. That's
how you got composting
and growing your own and
having recess and
sitting down for 20
minutes and all of that, this
is just so
far past
the original bill.
That, that's my issue.
It is so far
out.
The, I've actually
texted, uh, Senator
Padilla to ask him to tell
me what the purpose was
of his senate bill
for. So we
hear legislative
intent from the
source, but he
hasn't responded so
far. So, have
you looked at the responses
on the PE D website?
Are people talking
about those issues in
particular? And
is there a,
is there, is there a way for
us to, uh,
continue that maybe
Les C needs to,
um, get
on the because in
the past, um,
Les C staff
has put
together what
you talked about, this is not
defined well enough,
this is not defined at
all. You know, this
will be a problem for schools.
Have we done that
for this rule?
>> Mr Chair, Mr Chair,
Senator Stewart, we haven't done
it formally yet, but we were happy to
do that for you. Uh We do
meet uh weekly
actually with, with PE D
staff and policy
staff and so we'll, we'll be sure to,
to comment there as well
in our communication with staff. So
far, they have emphasized
the need for folks to
submit public
comment. Uh It's, it's
the, it's the sort of thing
that that does to give them something
to point to if they do make those
changes. Um But to
your, to your question about
uh us reviewing the feedback, we've done
that as well. There are
concerns about funding and whether
or not, you know, who's gonna do this. They've
talked about, obviously,
the growing season for food
is when no one is in
school. And so the
need for staff to,
to oversee those
things when they're not maybe on contract
and I can speak. My,
my, my wife was a
teacher at a school that
wanted to do this and she felt pretty
strongly about it too and,
and a, and a group of people would
rotate through the summer and
she said I'll never do that again.
So I it can happen,
but it does require, you know, additional
staffing uh
we, we, I haven't seen anything
about tools yet
but I think, but
I think funding is, is certainly
a concern. Uh We
actually, I was just, I was just reviewing
them again because pe D updated
the site yesterday with
it went from like six comments to
40 something comments uh
as, as they update it
regularly. Um I heard
concerns about water honestly
in some of the, some of the districts that
are facing water
regulations right now. If you've
been paying attention to Eastern New
Mexico, uh Perales,
this I think was a comment from
Texaco. Literally
said we're not allowed to water things
because of the the water
prohibitions
uh in the in that part of the
state. So there are some, some genuine
concerns about how they would even accomplish
some of these things.
>> So Mr Chairman, I think if
this was not a mandate,
it would be different, you
know, teachers rise to the
occasion like your
wife, you know, certainly
if I was in schools
now, I would bring my
trusty shovels and
watering cans and whatever
seats I didn't use.
Um because that's what, what
teachers are like, you
know, when they're told, well, you gotta do
this, they step
up. Um It
just this, this
doesn't seem
fair
to turn it
into
such a different
idea than
the original bill.
I mean, I want kids to
compost, I want families
to compost. I want them to
understand it. I want
them to like to grow
things and all of that.
So, the impetus
behind it is good.
It's just, you
know, having another mandate.
This, this truly would
be an unfunded
mandate. Um
I believe so.
Um I, I hope
they will re rethink
this. So thank
you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank >> you, >> Representative
Baca. Thank you, Mr Chairman
and thank you. Um
I'm in 100% agree with my
colleagues here when we talk about
legislative intent and we talk
about what was a good
idea to help our
families in
need. And now what we've
done is we've
actually shifted the burden
to school districts that are already
stretched.
Um
You know, II, I would think Mr
Chairman and, and if we're
wanting to, to
have these types of activities, then we
should be able to fund them and
provide opportunities
to schools that
have done this. I, I'm gonna
forget the name of the school that I was.
I think it was Los Padilla Elementary
that has in the main in the South
Valley has, has
taken upon themselves. And these
folks have actually gone out and found
their own grants.
So then rather than rather
than do that, we could relieve
some of that burden and we can
provide them funding
for their greenhouses
for their growing if
that's what the school and the staff
and the community want to
support, but to have
every school district
and charter
school
comply with this, I think
is really is
already stretching a very,
is already putting more tasks
on a very
burdened uh system.
And so I know that it's not you.
But this, I, I
think this goes along with
other um
when we talk about providing
or passing legislation,
if there is a, a rule
that is going for the betterment
and to make our uh better
for schools, I'm for it.
But this rule and the rules that are
coming up here have somewhat made
it more problematic.
So, thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank >> you, >> Representative Senator
Brand.
Thank you. I, I appreciate you
guys uh
bringing this and having us
look at this. I'm sorry, I, I got
the cart before the horse a little bit earlier,
but the horse was here, so I wanted to talk
to him. Um,
but uh you know,
it's, it's just again,
it's one of those situations and I
think uh the pro TEM is
100% correct. It's an unfunded
mandate
just like the 180 day
was an unfunded mandate
and you know, the PED
continues to add
things that
is really the legislator's
do job if they want that
to be there because that's where
the funding comes from.
So they're committing us
to things, you know,
them to things that they have no
funding for
and trying to force the hand
of the legislature,
which is supposed to be the appropriator.
They're trying to take over the role of
the appropriator
by forcing it.
And II, I think we have
to be very careful as legislators
to quit allowing the
executive
to go beyond what
is supposed to be their
scope.
And, you know, we,
we have had a really bad
habit since I've been here for 12
years. Bill and I came in
together. We're not
gonna talk about how long the pro
Tim's been here,
you know, but, you know,
they can, they continue
to
constantly
try to get out of their
lane and
we continue as legislatures
to give away our authority. We
need to stop
doing that.
So, you know, it's one of the
things for the next four years.
If I get re-elected, I'm,
you know, gonna focus on is
we've got quit giving away our authority
and, and Pet just
continues. They're just one of the
departments. So I'm not trying to pick on
Ped, but it's just one of the departments
that this executive branch
continues to overstep
their authority and try
to get into the
authority of the legislature
and it's got to stop
the courts have stepped in a couple
of times now and they're going to step in a
couple of times more
as long as this continues to
happen. So I thank you guys for
giving us a good briefing. I pulled
it out of the book so I could take it home
and, and uh work
some more on it and, and I'll probably
ask my caucus to submit a
letter on
this particular subject because
I think this is, you know, the
last rule on the 180
was ridiculous. This is
beyond ridiculous.
So, thank you madam pro
TEM for talking about the unfunded
mandates and we've got to quit
allowing that. That's got to
stop. Thank you.
>> Thank you, anyone
else? I don't see
any. So
deputy director, if you'd like to move
on to the next one.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh
The next one is going to be relatively
quick, I think uh
this is a, this is a rule
that we talked about
prior to the session. So it's been a little
while. This was when it was initially
proposed, it's an accreditation
rule. Uh And
as we said, uh I want to
say back in November or
December,
um the
accreditation rule
essentially compiles
a list of already
existing statutory
and regulatory requirements
and puts it all into one
place so
that uh districts
have a consolidate, a
consolidated place
to look at all the requirements
that, you know, both reporting
and otherwise uh that
the department asks of them.
And so, um
the one thing I'll, I'll, I'll
mention that is still,
is still an issue, although I'll
clarify it a little bit is that the
rule does ask
that in the reporting
districts uh show
the department how they
are budgeting uh
specific funds.
So, special education
gifted students and
at risk, uh
funds districts
have to report to, to the
department, how they're
budgeting those funds. And
as we mentioned in, in the,
the winter or late
fall,
eg funds are generally
discretionary
and so districts are
allowed to spend those those
funds. However, they'd like, I do
point out here that even
though they're required to show how they budget
those funds, there is no requirement
for how they spend them. So just
to, just to clarify
that,
um
at the bottom of page one, I talk a little
bit about the substantive issues.
Again, these are reporting
requirements that the PE D
has of school districts and charter
schools. These
are uh for the most
part, live in some
other piece of statute
or regulation already.
So, reporting about board
training, uh you
all passed a bill this year
that uh
specified that board training,
this requires them to report,
that requires
them to report about financial
audits, their program
plans, budget and actual
expenditures,
school enrollment,
school kind of ability,
data, uh
attendance improvements,
school safety plans,
post-secondary plans,
class loads, caseloads and subjects
of instruction, tribal
consultation, the tribal
education status report
and student needs assessment. Again,
all of these are already living
someplace but this is the
the compiled
um
process by which they
can look at them
all. Uh I
do want to point out that
uh in their changes pe D
did make some changes based
on feedback to the rule.
They uh
clarified a little bit. I know
they heard some concerns and we saw some
concerns in the feedback
that somehow this accreditation
rule was required
of private and
tribal and bie controlled
schools that
there was some concern that Pe D
was sort of overreach into a place
where they didn't have authority.
They clarified uh this
in the final rule that
for those nonpublic and
BBIE schools,
most of the rule provisions
apply to only to those
seeking state
acre accreditation, choosing to
seek state
accreditation.
So if you're
being accredited by an
external entity that
is approved by the department
and you don't want or need state
accreditation,
the most of this doesn't
apply to you. If you're a private school,
for instance, if you're already a private school
and you're accredited by another agency,
these don't apply to you. The
change that Pe D made
here, I think clarifies
that a little bit.
Um Again, there's an a
annual accreditation
cycle that
uh the secretary would determine
the accreditation status of the
schools which would remain
in effect until the next accreditation
determination. We happen,
that's gonna happen every fiscal
year.
Um Again,
we talked a little bit about
consequences.
Um And these are
options for the
department, not
a, not a
step by step process
necessarily, if a
school is not accredited, if they don't
meet the requirements
of the rule, there
are some things that the department
could do
and that those did not change
from the proposed rule to the final
rule. They include requiring
a locally developed plan to correct the
organizational programmatic
deficiencies,
directing the organizational
educational planning of a local
school district or public
school suspending
from authority and responsibility. The
school board superintendent or school
principal bringing
action in direct in district court
for the order of consolidation of school
districts closing the
school or executing
other remedies in the public school
code that might be appropriate.
These existed
in the proposed rule, they stayed
the same in the
adopted rule
on page three of
the review for this particular rule.
One thing that did change is that the
department
specified uh some
provisions for charter
schools. So
uh in order to clarify,
um what might
happen, the adopted rule
contains specific charter school
provisions in response
to public comment that authorizer,
charter school, authorizer not, the
department should be
responsible for accreditation.
The department cites
um the charter
school, the finance of
the school,
public school code for
its authority to accredit charter
schools. Uh The final
rule provides that in addition
to conferring approval or
disapproval status on a state
chartered or locally chartered
school, the department
may suspend the principal from
authority or responsibility
pursuant to its statutory
authority to suspend
a local principal
to notify a charter schools
authorizer for purposes of the
suspension revocation
or non, non
renewal of the school's
charter or
execute other remedies in the
public school code that may be
appropriate. So again,
they, they did include these charter
specific provisions
uh in the adopted
rule. Otherwise,
the rule uh is
very much the same
as the proposed rule.
And Mr Chair uh will stand
for questions on that
one.
>> Questions on this particular
rule
seeing none
carry on.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. The
last rule we're going to
talk about is the one that you've already
spent the most time talking about
today and that's the
school instructional time
requirements.
Um I'm happy to
go. I, I think it's important that I
go through some of the specifics that maybe
you didn't already hear about.
Um I'll
start though, of course,
with the, with the status
of the rule you heard this morning from
the secretary. Um
a little bit about that
the district court judge
did issue a preliminary
injunction prohibiting the
department from enforcing
this rule until
the trial is completed
and, and the court finds
about the legality of the rule
itself and
So until that happens, they
can't enforce the rule.
And based on what the judge said
earlier this week,
they
must,
except all school
budgets that comply with
the statutory requirements
of instructional time. So the
1140 requirements
and the professional work, anything
that complies with the actual
law should
be, um,
approved.
They're not allowed to enforce
the provisions of the rule
until the conclusion of that,
of that trial. We've
heard today that the first hearing
for that trial won't happen until
July 2nd.
And so
again, that's, that's
after the start of fiscal year
25. And so
essentially, effectively
delays the implementation of
this rule if it's, if it's ruled
legal, uh, for at least
one fiscal
year.
Ok. I'll talk a little bit
about the rule itself. Uh,
most of these, uh,
we talked about the
first time when the rule was
proposed, they did
make some changes pe d did make some
changes and I'll talk a little bit about
that, but you'll see the
bullets there about the
high-level requirements.
Obviously, the all schools
must comply with the law of
1140
instructional days must
be a minimum of 5.5 hours
and can be a maximum of 7.5
hours, half days
must be at least 3.5
hours.
A school lunch shall be a
minimum of 30 minutes, school,
lunch time, lunch, recess
and passing periods to and from
lunch do not qualify as
instructional hours.
Uh This is a change and you'll see
in a table that I kind of pointed out,
but secondary students must
attend a minimum of 3.5
instructional hours per
instructional day
unless they provide evidence of
participating in an
equivalent amount of time
for an apprenticeship
work study program,
dual credit program
in employment in community
service or similar
activities. This is one
of the changes from the proposed
rule. The proposed rule
um said that school
secondary students had to
attend at least
four
courses per
day per instructional day.
This changes that to
hours versus
courses,
uh, instructional hours or days
lost to whether other events must be
made up. And the
secretary may waive those requirements due
to hardship,
up to 60 instructional hours
for elementary and up to 30
hours for secondary
instructional hours for secondary
grades may be used
for professional work,
but must be scheduled
before after
or on a day
other than the required minimum
180 days.
So to clarify that a
little bit, in other
words, as
long as you have 100 and 80
days of school,
that's, that's the minimum
requirement
and you have to meet the
1140. If you use
some of those professional work hours
to meet the 1140
you can do that.
But it can't happen during the
instructional day
in one of those
180 days.
So that's
again,
um
no more than four days can be remote
instruction and at least 50% of
remote instruction must be
synchronous.
Um
So while all schools are
required to meet these requirements, the
adopted rule exempts
early college, high schools
and school districts and charter
schools that meet certain
proficiency and growth
targets in reading language,
arts, as determined by the secretary,
this is that exemption that we've
talked about before the
pe D issued a memo
that specified
the requirements for those
exemptions uh
based on
um
reading language, arts proficiency
scores.
And then uh the adopted rule
makes no changes to
proposed K 12 plus
provisions.
Essentially mirroring the
statutory provisions around that
program. So I won't
talk too much about that again.
On page two,
you'll see the changes
in that little box between
the proposed rule,
uh, and the secondary
rule. I'm
sorry, in the adopted
rule,
the, the adopted rule also
removed uh requirements
for five day school
weeks. So you heard the department
say that you can have
a four day school week under this
rule? And that's technically
true. You've probably heard
this already. But in order to do
so, a school district would
have to have about 45
weeks of school if they were to
maintain a four day
uh school
week
calendar.
And then, uh, the significant
issues at the bottom of the brief and the,
and at the top of page three
again, just sort of,
uh, recaps what
the court did,
uh, over the last few
weeks about the rule
itself, that last
paragraph talks a little bit about,
um, the temporary
injunction. And of
course, the, the judge made it pretty
clear there that, uh, in his
finding at least that
the, the
rule was in
contradiction to
statutory intent,
legis legislative intent.
He cited uh both the,
the 1140
but also the change that
happened from
2009 to 2011
when the legislature
passed a law requiring
100 and 80 days.
The pe D
uh adopted a rule
requiring 100 and 80
days in
2011,
the legislature repealed
that law requiring
100 and 80 days because of a
number of factors.
The rule was never repealed,
but it was also never enforced.
And the judge cited all
of that legislative
action as evidence
for, for legislative intent
in ruling that this was in contradiction
to the uh
to the law. I'm
not a lawyer. And
so, um, if you have any
legal questions, I probably shouldn't answer
that.
And with that Mr Chair, we stand for
questions. >> Thank
you, Senator Brand. I
think you were the first on my
list here.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. And, and,
um,
uh,
yeah,
so, I mean, this one's also
a mess. Uh, I
appreciate, um, and I
want to thank Stan
for the,
uh, Superintendents Association
bringing this lawsuit. I
think it's, uh,
it was pretty clear this was never
the intent of the legislature. In
fact, uh, Senator
Stewart, Senator Soul
and I have had this
discussion in
committee and LES C
and pretty much everywhere about
this particular issue. And I don't
think any of us agreed
that we should be mandating
this. Um, and
so it was pretty
clear, um, you know, we had
discussions on how much time
should be spent for, you know,
teacher, uh,
improvement, you
know, for professional
development. Um,
I lost part of that discussion
but got some of those hours
in, you know,
but the, you know, that
there's a process we go through
and, and again for, for the
PED to just ignore
that
um, which is clearly what
happened. I, I think it's very
disturbing. Um,
and I, I'm glad
that, uh, at
least
the Superintendents Association
did something. Honestly. I think
we as a legislature should have
filed that lawsuit
and done it ourselves
because again, they're
trying to take away legislative
authority.
Um, I know I'm
probably beating a dead horse
and I really like horses,
so I'm not gonna beat one.
So, um, I
just,
you know, this rule I
is, is really
causing a lot of
problems. Um,
I do, uh,
I know Ped's not up there
but, you know, I, I have
had some
reports
already
that districts
and charter schools that had submitted
their calendars and
under the new
rule that now
after the judge's order tried
to resubmit new calendars, we're
told that Ped would
not accept
them, which is a
direct
violation of the court's
order. So
I'm just going to give, you know,
pet a little warning.
If that continues,
then they'll go back to court
and the judge will
hold you in contempt. So I, I
think that would be a really bad
idea for Ped to do
that. Um,
so, you
know,
I would comply with a court order
if I were you
otherwise, I think the
legislature will have to get more
involved
and, uh, we, we do have some
pretty decent attorneys and we
can hire some.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. I
appreciate you letting me say my piece
and
I I just, it's really
concerning to me.
>> Thank you other
comments,
Representative Baca,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman and
thank you John for this II
I do have
some
some questions and and and maybe
just start out with a statement that
I looked around this table here and my
colleagues and I
during that session spent hours
and days in a room
trying to find out
what was a workable
situation
and the fact that that was
rule, we, we, we
did all this work and was it in
place for
very long and all they come
back with another rule and I
think that it didn't
validate the work
and the
bipartisan support
that went into
uh defining these instructional
hours. So
um
I think that that is the, the
frustration with that,
you know, we, we talk
about
um Mr Chairman, we talked
about local decision making local
control and I think
that time and time
again that has come up there and
I do believe that
decisions about a community
in their schools are
best made
from this, the school district
and the communities that they serve.
Um Mr
Chairman uh and
I'm actually gonna, I'm
gonna ask this of Stan
rounds. OK, Stan.
And I apologize when you know somebody
20 years you can put them on the
spot and that's just
sorry, I
didn't know you. But my, my
question to you, sir is
what impact
did this rule have
on budgets or would it have had
on budgets
and what
issues has it
caused, Mister Chairman.
Sorry.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Members of the
committee, John did a great
job of reviewing what the
court order was. Let me
read a couple of pieces of it because
it's going to be important that I
translate that down to what
the districts are
asking me. In
fact, I have a call at three
o'clock with
superintendents about
this. The first thing I'll
note is the court order does
not just
impact those districts
and charters in
the lawsuit.
In fact, it,
it
sells
ped cannot enforce
new rules 6.10
0.5 against
any new Mexico
school district or
charter school, regardless
of whether or not they
are a named plaintiff in our
lawsuit. And
I want to understand that on behalf of the
superintendent, we filed this, we
wanted clarity
but it wasn't for a
select group of anybody. It
was broad-based.
It was the policy issue. It
was the legal
issue there.
Rule Trump law,
things like that, that we wanted to
clarify. So
districts knew where to
go.
Um Two other
things. Defendant shall not
reject calendars
and budgets complying
with N MS A 1978
section 22-2
dash 8.1.
That is your
law
that gave the 140
hour requisites
and included
embedded professional
development, which had,
by the way, had broad ranging
effect, not just on four
day weeks. This is not just a four day
week issue and
it says as a minute, even if they do
not comply
there words, they
uh they shall not reject any
school calendars and budgets complying
with N MS A 1978
as amended, even if they do
not comply with a
180 day requirement
in rule 6.10 0.5
and defendants are restrained and
enjoined from requiring
New Mexico public school districts and
charter schools including but
not limited to plaintiffs
to submit operating budgets
and school calendars
complying with the 180
day requirement of
new rule 6.10
0.5 NM AC.
Now, here's a question that
is before us that,
that
we're trying to give advice to our
council to districts and
that is the the issue that was
raised just a minute ago. So if you are
a district or charter school has
already submitted
your budget
with a
calendar
in such a fashion as
to meet the 180
day requirement,
which at the time before
the court ruling
could have been considered by
as the rule you had to
follow. Can you
now resubmit a
calendar? That
would be more of your normal
operating condition prior
to that
uh were of the opinion?
The answer is yes.
So we think this is very
broad-based about what
can and cannot
happen as far as
approving a budget.
So that's part of I think where
the gray zone is at that we're trying
to answer the rest
of it is districts are really trying
to navigate this. So
what's the chance
that this will be
ruled
differently
than what this
injunction calls
for? That's a a
Kika. That's a timing
question.
So when we had a scheduling
conference yesterday
afternoon, I
stepped out of your meeting to get
into the scheduling
conference. The
judge scheduled July
2nd as
the next hearing date
for this matter in his
court,
all budgets are due
on or about June the
15th
and go into
effect on July the
first.
I'm talking to our councilor of
the opinion that that means
that all budgets
that are submitted in the current
year would
be. And Representative Garrett
Mr Chairman, thank you for
the question of the secretary.
I think he was clear
the the issue is
that if you submit a
four day calendar or
I'll, I'll call it your
your normalized
calendar with your past
practice
that it will be approved
by the state. I think that's what I heard him
say. I believe
that's what the order requires
and that's what we're advising districts
about the issue. Here
is a tremendous amount of confusion,
concern and whatnot
things that mitigate
this districts
right now are telling
employees whether or not they're going
to be renewed.
One of the issues in this
is that
if you add more
days to a calendar
in many districts, they were
reducing staff, they were riffing
staff to get
home.
And so we believe
this relieves that
issue for, for
those districts.
Ok. So those, those are the kinds of
things that are out there.
Um Superintendents
and boards have worked
hard on budgets
as they always do
and this duplicitous budget
process didn't work
in, in our opinion, in their
opinion, that's what we
presented to the court.
That's what the court has agreed
to. Is it over?
The answer is no,
there's a hearing on July the
second
and there are several things that can
happen in that there can be
a summary judgment. Either
way as an
is in order for that hearing,
there can also be a full hearing
on the on the on the
matter. There are
briefings that are under way that are
due to the court before July
2nd, that will go to the judge for
him to look at. So this
is still in process.
What I will assure you from the
Superintendents Association.
Uh Mr Chairman
Representative Bakke is
that the Superintendents
Association will continue to
pursue this
legislatively with you in
the next session. We
feel like there's enough ambiguity in
the process that we
need to do. We need to talk
with you
about are things we need to
clarify, define
under the law and
then go from there. And so
thank you Mr Chairman
for letting us
do that, Mr Representative
Baca, does that
answer?
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you Stan. I guess
when we're looking at you
heard about $9.6
million for Law Senate Schools,
about 3 million of that was tied to
the 180 day rule. So I
need to be very clear
that a third
of our budget deficit
was tied directly
if this rule were
put into place. So I
wanted to highlight that.
Thank you Mr Chairman
and thank you John and thank
you, Stan
and Connor, sorry, >> Connor,
Mr Chair and Representative Buckey.
And again, this, I I hope
this is not too far out thee out of
the scope of the presentation,
but the practical
effects there of the of
the delayed
implementation. If any imple
implementation of the rule
also has some some practical
effects on you heard about the unit
value. You're familiar with the the
setting of the unit value.
There are assumptions built
into that unit value
calculation. Every
spring K 12
plus is a big part
of that because school districts get
additional funding. Um
and you know, without speaking to
specifics because we don't know exactly
what the, what the impacts of that might
be. But that also plays
into how many units
are generated at the district
level. Um based
on the assumptions made around
the rule and, and whether or not
schools would comply or
how they would comply with the rule.
And so there, there's also some
practical implementation
I implications
uh for the department and looking
at that unit value, you heard the secretary
this morning say they were going to
take a look at that calculation
and I think that's also gonna be impacted
by this.
>> And thank you Mr Chairman
and thank you John. I guess the question
is when are
they gonna have to wait till January
for this unit value to come out
there, you know, we talked about the,
the 5.1%
that was increased, the 3.1%
that was actually dispersed
to districts.
Um So
when
would this have to be, or districts
be notified or even
given some kind of hope that the unit
value is gonna increase
so that it, so
that districts have some sort of
relief? And I, I see Sonny out
there, I know that Sonny was at LFC.
I don't know if there are
thoughts in that, but I, I guess
really the question is he said
that Mr
Chairman, that it was
hopeful that the new
unit value would come
out sometime
prior to the beginning of school
year in June. And
July, was that correct,
>> Mr Chair Representative Baker? That's
right. >> Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
Thank you, Senator
>> Stewart.
Uh Thank you Mr Chairman. I'm
gonna be a little bit
off-topic.
Um I want
to talk about the effort
that I and others
have made for the last 10 years
to extend the school
year.
Uh in 2008, we
had the American Institutes of
Research that
did a long
study of New Mexico,
basically told us
that we needed to add 10 days
to our school year, go up
to 185
if we were going to make a difference
in student
achievement,
you know, this is an election year
I've received re uh
questionnaires from a
lot of people.
Uh Nobody
in those questionnaires,
neither teachers union
or these other groups
are asking us any
questions about
student
achievement.
It's only about
what the.
So,
um,
we've passed two bills from
the Senate where we tried
to extend the school year by 10
days, passed
overwhelmingly
bipartisan.
They were both killed in the
house.
Uh, Utah State
got 20 million
from the federal government to
study K three
plus because it was the
only program in the
whole country
where we were trying to
extend the school
year to benefit
students.
So two huge things
came out of that.
If you don't treat it
like an extended school
year, those
gains students make don't
last if
you have a
true extended school
year, 25
extra days,
those students
that are
in those early grades
make a 20 point
gain compared
to students that are
similar to them
that don't have an extended
school year.
Hawthorne Elementary,
which I live six houses
from was part
of a tops program
in Albuquerque. I've
gotten eight letters from
those teachers
begging me
to have them keep
their 100 and
94
school year day
because they've moved that
school from an MRI
school to a
traditional school.
It's taken three years,
but there they are.
So I have
very mixed feelings
about what we're doing.
I
continue to
look at that. Yazzie
Martinez those 600
pages, they're
based on park test
scores.
So we're trying
everything
except
extending the school
year to
improve student
achievement.
Um and we're
doing a good job in
some areas,
but not on this.
Now, I understand, you
know, when I worked for a
PS and my, one of my last
jobs was an early childhood
liaison where I had to go
in and look at kindergarten and first
grade students
to see how
to help them be
successful.
Those teachers would say to
me if I came in March
April, you know,
if I just had a couple
of more months,
these kids aren't ready
for first grade, they're not ready
for second grade. We need a
longer school year and
shouldn't we be paid for
it. So finally
we do that, but there's a
wholesale rejection
of a longer school
year. So,
you know, I don't know what's gonna
happen with us. I,
you know, I, I do my
best to try to look at
that academic achievement,
which is why I'm so focused
on reading. I, which
I was also focused on math,
but I'm one of those. I'm not
a math gal. I
like interesting math
problems but
I don't know how
to change our
projection.
So, you know, I'm just
kind of depressed about what's
going on now
because it's like we've done
this way. The
pandemic has just
made us be so
divisive and I,
I believe we're divisive on this
issue. I mean,
I wish we were extending
the school year really
part of the reason this has
come up and I've
got this data from
the pe d some people
say they're wrong.
Um that a third of our school
districts actually reduced
hours, a third
of them kept about the
same and a third of them
actually made the
180 day or
more. And we
put the money in the
budget to pay
for teachers to
have uh their
regular salary
extended. So it's
a way to pay teachers
more, but I
get it, you know, we're tired
of pandemic, we're tired of
school. We don't want to do
it as long as
is necessary
to make a difference
in these students,
academic achievement.
We're so low
in our N A scores.
We we dropped. Yeah, we
were last, but now we
are really last. We're
really last. The
pandemic has impacted
our student achievement
more I think than any
other state.
Uh So,
um
so I'm sorry,
Mr Chairman II, I
took advantage of a
soapbox here
because there's another
way to look at this
and there are other issues
out there
and uh
I don't know where we'll all
end up, but I
know where I am. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator. Other
questions,
comments.
I'm sorry. >> Yes,
thank you, Mr Chair.
Um I love the passion of this
committee.
Um I just
want to re reiterate as
one of the sponsors
of House 130
which established
1140
hours is that, that
came out of two years
of work around
the state, every district,
every type
of thing. It wasn't
something that we just
came up with.
Um The second thing I want to
mention
is uh we
carefully looked at the
inclusion of
the 60 30 hours of
instructional time within the
duty day because so
much of educating
teachers to more
effectively address student
needs comes when
you're in the classroom, you're
observing an expert
teacher teaching a
math lesson
who got incredible results,
which you struggled with.
That happens during the duty
day with actual students.
The third thing is we can talk
about um pe D
in the text of the
2023 budget
was supposed to review
the schedules to ensure
that there wasn't a reduction
in hours that evidently
didn't happen. The fourth
thing we'll say is the
elephant in the room is attendance,
you can extend the school
year. But if kids don't
come to school, it doesn't mean
anything. And, um,
I would like to ask him
among his, his,
uh, duties
is, you know, how,
how many actual days
do our kids go to school?
You know, if we really actually
look at the required
hours or days,
how many kids we
know that a huge
number of our kids are
chronically absent.
So extending a school
year and kids
just have less days not
to attend doesn't really solve the
problem. And then my last
comment is we've had four day
school years. I think
Gail Armstrong who's
in her fifties went to a four day
school year. There's school districts
that have had four day
school years
uh for decades
and decades
and in
this state, I mean,
we're a western state by
golly, you know, we're
not gonna have any trains because
we've got to have our cars and our horses
basically,
but we
value local
control and I
think we have
to really
uphold that. A y
locality
knows what works
best.
Sorry, that's my comment.
Thank you.
>> Thank you, representative.
Um, other
soapboxes. I'm
teasing, I'm just trying to lighten the
mood,
right?
Thank you. I think that was the
last rule
Thank you so much. Uh
Certainly, sometimes when
we have the rule things, we all just kind of
not like. Ok, thanks for letting us
know there were some very
good discussions about some
and, and what our intent was
and, and how these
fit with legislative
intent and other things as
the, the rules are being
promulgated in some very
controversial areas. So thank
you, Mr Chair, >> just
as the committee know that we
intend to bring you a rule review
every meeting if there
are and you heard from the,
the department this morning
that they've, they've issued a couple of other
proposed rules and, and
so we'll bring those to you as the
interim uh goes
on.
>> When is next with the directors
report
job?
>> Yes.
Ok. >> So
director, please, if you go
ahead with the director's
report,
>> um Good
afternoon. Thank you, Mr
Chair uh
members of the committee.
I have four
things uh to
quickly go through for
you. Um I
also just want to have a, a moment
of gratitude for the committee
and your passion
for
um lifting up education
in New Mexico. We
try to serve you as best
possible and all of your
voices are really vital.
Um And
um we hear you all. So
thank you.
Um I'm gonna do the
first thing I'm gonna do is just
review the post
session, um
review um memo
for you to take a vote on
and approve.
Um
This is
um a
Oops, I have an annual report,
Jess. Can you bring me actually the
post session? Thank
you.
This is a
um
a document that we put together
every year for you.
Um After the session,
uh It is a
historical document
in a sense that
lists of all of the
action that was taken place
that has taken place
um
through the session.
Um I would like
to thank Merritt
Andrews.
She is our resident
um
editor
for the team. Uh
She does incredible
work for all of us
in terms of copy
editing. Um really
ensuring that we are
following the LES C style
guide uh that
all of our t are crossed. Our I's
are dotted that we
um spell out numbers when we need to
spell out numbers and we
use num numerica
numbers when we're supposed to
use numeric numbers.
Um So merit a
lot of gratitude for
you. Um And she's
also master
actually dealing
with the publishers and getting
this in a beautiful form for
you all. I'd also like
to thank um
Tim who
as you all know is our data
guru um
for the team. And so the
appendix um
I'll go over some
um beautiful graphics
that Tim supports us all
with. Um
but really the whole team
is part and uh part
of this and uh you'll
see their effort and good
work throughout.
Um You'll see
the all of
their
thoughts and
um effort in each
section. So if
you'll just open the front page,
you'll see the contents.
Um the table of
contents,
the post session review is
divided up into sections.
The first half is really the
text. Uh What has
happened in terms of public school
finance in during the
session. What has
happened in terms of student
success during the
session? What happened
uh in terms of educated
workforce
infrastructure, data
systems and governance, whole
child system
supports and
equity. And again,
this is all focused on
the legislative session that happened
this year.
You'll have an introduction, the
session action that
occurred in each
category. And then the road
ahead um that's
based off of a continuance
and sort of the work plan that we
hope to PURs um
um move
forward with.
There's a list of the
appendices and
I'll go over a couple of those
things, but just to orient
you, there's an introduction on
the first page. Uh
You can read that at your
leisure. This is also available
on the website. It's good
resource for your constituents
or others as well as well as our
stakeholders in
schools.
Um I'm gonna just point
out a couple of things very quickly
so that you can take a vote and
also read this at your leisure.
But uh public
school finance on page
three, you'll sort
of see the layout of each
section here. I'll go over
an example of public school
finance. Uh
Daniel is
responsible for this section,
so it's all of his good
work here. It's
introduction with
the general amount of funding.
Uh what the estimate
was with the consensus revenue
estimating group and what they are
projecting for fy
25
the
cumulative appropriations
in house bill two as well
as the feed bill.
Um You'll see on
the next page sort
of a breakdown of what happened in
terms of the GA A or
the General Appropriation Act.
And then specifically what
has happened around
the state equalization guarantee
the 5.1%
increase
overall for the
tub total public school support. But
then also mirroring in terms
of just the SCG itself,
uh you'll see the key
topical areas where there
was increases.
Uh You'll see a listing
of categorical appropriations
that Daniel has listed for
you and the transportation
distribution.
You'll see a section on page
five on the public education
department budget.
And then there's also an element
in terms of the government results in
opportunity, expendable trust
or the Grow uh program
Fund and the Grow Trust
that uh we are
paying attention to. I think there's
been made mention of this
uh throughout the uh the hearing
this week. Um And
we are hoping to
have good um productive
discussions with the F
and LFC around this.
And the importance of LES
C being part
of this is as
on behalf of the
legislature in terms of
studying education and
also having a
better uh idea
of um
I want to use the word realistic
but um
achievable
and meaningful
metrics, performance
metrics in education.
Um
You'll see on page six
that Daniel has for you. A
small um insert
around what is the public Education
Reform fund that's was
important this year in the
legislative session in terms of
the um um
using up
the bulk of those funds
and what they were used on.
And then a small synopsis
there of the road ahead in terms
of finance, on behalf
of the LES C. So
each of the sections is gonna
mirror the same sort
of um
introduction, the,
the session
action
and then the road ahead.
Um And again,
you can take a look at
that all um on your
own time.
Uh It's pretty in
depth. Um, it'll
cover everything from the
graduation requirements to the
higher education Trust
Fund, um,
direct capital
outlay appropriations that
were made, um,
as well as, um,
a listing of all
that was made in terms
of, um, post-secondary
appropriations to Native American
student services.
So it runs the
gamut and it really is
again a historical document
for you all and a review
of all of the action that happened
during the
session.
I'm gonna turn quickly
to your appendix then and it's a
hard page in
the middle of the
book
and following the appendix
are some very useful
do, um,
pages.
So the first appendix a
lists all legislation
related to public education
that moved through the
session on whether
or not it was finally chaptered.
Um, you'll see thing
you'll see on Appendix A that it's
listed by
number
through the House and then the
Senate.
And then if you turn the page to
page 42
you'll see the same
listing organized a bit
differently and this is
um through topical
areas. So education or support
services, what
bills were related to educated
workforce, the bills
related to equity,
the bills related to governance
and higher education.
Again, you'll see whether or not it was
finally chaptered in the chapter
number. Um
or, and, or how
far it got, whether it
was deemed to remain or not, the
house vote and the Senate vote as
well.
On page
45
you'll see uh the
actual ga a
language related to public
education. So the
page right next to it is a
synthesis on how to read the
General Appropriation Act.
It's very useful
resource.
Um All
of you are very familiar at
this point. I think
in terms of actual reading
of the GA A, but that's a good
resource to have
particularly for constituents.
And there are on the
website, there are direct
links to each of the sections in
the GA A which is very
helpful.
Um But we also
have um in
the post session review
for you, the language that
was vetoed
um in the General Appropriation
Act. That way you can see what
particular elements
um were
vetoed by the
executive
following the language
on page 48 and
49. You
see an actual
um high level
that includes the LES C
recommendation, the
original LFC recommendation,
the executive recommendation, and then
the final operating
budget.
Um I'm gonna turn to page
52.
This is something new
that we included this
year
uh
that Tim put together for
you. This is
actually a history
of the General Friend appropriation
of public for public
education.
So he's
starting here for
fiscal year 16.
And you'll see that there's different
segments in this table.
The first being the actual
general appropriation Act
bill number and a link
to it actually. Should you
go uh like to go
there? Then the list
in terms the number
in terms of public school
support
the percent of the total
general fund appropriation on
line seven. And that's
a very interesting noting
that like in, in fiscal
year 16, the
total general fund appropriation
percent was 42.4%.
And we're sort of back down to
that
space
for fiscal year 25 or
42.9%.
Um What's interesting
is when you look at fiscal year
23
although the total amount is
less, the
percent of the
total general fund appropriation
was
larger.
Starting with the
line 10.
You'll see the higher education
budget including
the institutions, the higher ed
department itself and
student financial aid as
well as the um
the beginning of the
opportunity scholarship
with fiscal year 21.
And then the subtotal for
higher ed
starting with line
17, the early
childhood education
budget support
and intervention, the early
childhood and education care
department.
Public Pre
K.
You'll see the subtotal
on line 23
as well as on line 24.
The percent of the total
General for appropriation
we wanted to provide for you here.
A total of the
budget that actually goes
to support education
beginning with birth
through higher
education and
how that percentage is
in terms of the total state budget.
Again, this is informing
you to be um
enable, enabled to make
better decisions
around and, and or
advocate around both public
education. But then
understanding the relationship with early
childhood and higher education
in the
budget.
Page 53 is also
interesting. Um
We do produce this
every year for you in some form
or fashion. Um I
like the bar chart
as well as the pie chart
right there comparing
uh the difference in terms of the public
education, the total
public education budget
um contrasting with
other state
agencies.
So again, that's not the public
school support but the actual
department.
Oh, no
budget.
Um
On 50
page 54
you'll see the general fund
appropriation that goes to
public education.
Uh The
actual difference
between the state equalization
guarantee, categorical
appropriations and
then contrasting that with the
pe D operating budget,
higher ed and early
childhood.
On page 55
you'll see the history of
the unit value uni value
has come up this year
as a
interesting topic
and a struggle for the school
districts and, and it is
a struggle for the school districts.
Um You've heard and
I've heard at large from
many school districts and had discussions
with superintendents for the
past month about
their struggle with this.
But this is uh actually
an interesting historical
overview of the years
where the change
went into the red.
Um
and the large increases over
the past couple of years
in the actual unit value.
So if you actually turn to
page 56
you'll see that for
fiscal year 23 and
24
the change in the unit value
is the
13%.
The rest of the document
provides legislative changes
to the public school funding formulas
by year.
And then on
page 71 there's a
listing for you of the direct
capital outlay appropriations
that happened through the
session.
Mister Chairman, I'll stand for
questions.
>> Thank you and wonderful
document. Uh I
have just kind of a, a basic
question. The
finance committee
get this
and the there are a number of things
that, you know, I I
hear
misinformation about
how much is being spent
and sense of the
total budget and things of
that sort. And, you
know, I haven't obviously had a chance
to go through this carefully,
but there are a number of
things when we're advocating
for budget and other stuff
with the finance committee that,
that gives us some real strength
in advocating for
why it matters that we
support education to higher
levels. So
would, would encourage, I
don't, you know, it's kind of
like you can take a horse to water, you can't make
him drink, we can give them the water,
hopefully some of them will drink
it. But
>> yeah, thank you, Mr Chair.
Um We can certainly provide this
and, and I think we'll provide
this to all legislators
and um send it to their
office um including the
finance committee and of course,
share it with our good partners,
the staff Sunny, um
as well as director Sali
at um at LFC.
Um to be honest,
they are good partners and
some of the data comes
from their work.
Um So it's really
how we um
hope to elucidate
the information for you
all and sharing
it. >> Thank you.
The one that comes to mind
is the actual
percent of the total budget that
goes to education has gone
down. Uh The
total number has gone up
but the percent is
a better measure of what our commitment
statewide is to public
education and it's
decreased back down to
42.9. I
think it was from a high of
about 46 just a couple of
years ago. And so
I think those are, are important
points, comments from
other
legislators. I don't see
any. So, thank you very much. Do
we, we need to have a
motion then
to adopt the
post session review
of the legislative education
study. So moved
by Senator Stewart seconded
by, I was
reading Brandt Representative
Baca, I just
looked at the wrong sign my bad
looked at the wrong sign. Is there
any opposition to
that motion?
Seeing? No, it is
adopted. >> Thank
you, Mr Chair. Um I
also want to just briefly highlight
this document. We sent it
out with our activity report. A a
quick mention about the
activity reports.
Uh We do produce
sort of two versions of the
activity reports. The first
is for you and your
um eyes in terms
of uh research
that we're doing on a weekly
basis related
to the topics and the work plan in
particular, also
important updated information.
Um
And we also send a version out
to stakeholders.
And so that's why you were
hearing particularly from
superintendent and Belen how he
really appreciated those
documents because we send
a version to
the stakeholders and superintendents
in particular charter school leaders,
as well as some partners
across the state.
So they are getting to see some
updates on research
and have an idea as well. So
we have two versions of activity
reports going out right now.
But one of the first activity reports
we sent out this interim
had a copy of this
um also
uh that
we sent to you. And this is the quick
guide that we produced
really for
stakeholders.
Um And we
have gotten fabulous
feedback on
this document.
It's very short,
easy to read.
Um The
charter schools loved
it and used it in their
um um
retreat. We
had wonderful feedback from
superintendents who asked
about it, but it's essentially a
quick synopsis of important
legislation that impacts
them. Um And the Public
Education Department, a
quick review
of the budget and what
happened in the budget.
So I'm gonna just point out
one thing from the quick guide that I think
is very
helpful
and that's actually on page
19
budget highlights and I'll
give some strong kudos
here to Daniel who
put this part
together.
Um
not only did we have the
high level and an explanation
of the high level in layman's term
for stakeholders, but we
had explanations of
what happened in the budget
that you don't always
see through the
GA A. So for instance,
the first is a
line item in the
high level that's not necessarily
explained or called out
in the General Appropriation
Act, but it's the
net unit
changes or
reduction that
accounts for the drop in enrollment
because we do have drop in enrollment
in the state. Uh What
we hope to do is research that a
little bit more to understand
implications for the state in the
long term. Um
But the
trade-off from that
reduction with the 30
million that was also
included for flexible
dollars um
provides an actual
net change of 10 million
that was added.
Um So this
explanation, I think is
helpful for stakeholders in terms
of understanding what's happening
in um with the budget on
your behalf.
Um There's
also the inclusion of the
K 12 plus units
at 60 million um
with the legislature
um committed to
that program, I think
in terms of the units of
um at the original
intention of House Bill
130 the
average salary
increases.
And then it goes on
in terms of both the explanation
and then the select budget language
that, that applies
to that particular line
item in House Bill
two or the General Appropriation
Act.
Um So again, this has been
really uh welcoming
uh received
a lot of great feedback
on this and um
um stakeholders who
are very appreciative.
The other two items
that I'll briefly talk
on. Uh Mr
Chair are just a quick
fy 24 budget update
for you.
Um
You can
find this um
I think there's a version for
you behind Tab
nine
10.
Thank you John.
Um but it's simply
an update on where we are with
fiscal year 24 the
LES C budget as we
approach the end of the fiscal
year and look to close out
where we are.
Um
We're very healthy
in our budget. Um
Please and I'll talk about
next personnel
and how we have hired
two new
analysts.
But um
we have
um as
of May 9th. Thank
you, Alonso for
um keeping track of our
budget. So well,
$352,000
left of our
1.467
million in two hun in the two
hundreds, which is personnel,
we have
9000
left 9.4000
left of
35,000 in
professional services and
contracts.
And we have about 88,000
left of
265,000
that we have budgeted to spend
in 400 which are
other areas.
So we have quite a
sizable
amount here
in terms of budget.
We do need to do some
adjustment for next
year. And we're thinking about this,
we have a pretty tight
budget actually for fiscal
year 25 of the increase
in staff as well
as um a better understanding
of travel.
But one of the things that we have
inherited or seen over the
past couple of years is
that travel
wasn't budgeted enough
and yet, um
uh we had
too much that was particularly
budgeted in the three
hundreds. So
we're making some adjustments
there.
Um Finally, Mr Chairman,
I just want to do a quick update
on personnel. Uh
We are fully staffed.
We have an amazing team.
Um I
had the opportunity to introduce
Alonso and Manny and
you're all very familiar with
the wonderful support staff that
we have um
at the um LES
C.
Um but our analysts
um are
um really
incredible, they
have a
breath of experience
and um
education behind them.
We have two new analysts that I'm
gonna just talk a little bit
about and then
you can turn around and
see them. They're all here except for
Annie.
Um but
um the first all
introduces Connor
and uh Connor
start joined us in
March right after
the session
and uh a couple
of important points about
Connor so you stand up,
Connor.
Come up. Yeah, and Mark
come up.
Yes,
thank you.
Connor is the son of
educators.
Uh
His parents are both
educators and
he grew up in Redmond,
Oregon.
Um
Connor
has his
um degree in Political
Science from Boston
College and then he has his
masters. This is very
impressive, his master's
in public policy from the Gerald
Ford School of Public Policy
at University of Michigan. That
is one of the top
schools from policy
in the nation.
He's um been
incredible go-getter.
Um As I said earlier, around
the work plan really
involved. Um
and just
um a bright,
bright star,
Connor is also 25 years
old.
So adds to the
youth of the team and he has an
incredible um
future ahead of him.
We're, we're very excited. He
comes from us actually directly
from Washington where
he was serving uh Governor
Inslee in the, as a director
of Constituent Services.
So, um
he's um
definitely a people
person
and outgoing
and a couple of things about
Connor that I'd like to
share that he has an amazing
voice. Apparently, he's actually
already been
um
a part of a,
well, why don't you share?
>> Uh Yeah, so
actually they have a
Mr Chair and all
others. Uh They're
actually I am.
I was starting the fall
singing 10 or two in the
uh Sangra de Cristo Corral in
Santa Fe. They actually have a
concert this weekend. So if
folks are, they should
go
>> and Connors also
already been volunteering
in Santa Fe as part of habitat
for humanity. He jumped right
into the community.
So I
really excited
uh also
equally proud
and excited um
to have Mark
Montoya as part of our
team.
Um It is
incredible to have another person
on the team that is equally
savvy with finance.
And so Daniel doesn't feel so
alone.
And when we were interviewing
for um Mark's
position, I'm
gonna actually put Daniel
on the spot here. This is uh
exactly what Daniel
said. He said
when we were interviewing all
the other candidates would come through.
Daniel said, what would Mark
say, what would Mark do
because he was
so impressed with Mark.
Um So
it, it was a, that was actually
very telling to me when we were
going through the interviews because
Daniel is hard to
impress.
Um
Mark most
recently was a regional finance
manager for the Mexico
Finance Authority. He's
also a senior investment
account manager for
Pera. So he's got
both experience in
terms of Pera and the
Finance Authority a
long time. He's got
his degree in business and finance
as well as an MB
A from
Highlands.
Um One
of the most amazing things about
Mark is that he has an
incredible sense of humor.
Um Yeah,
his, it's, you
don't know it at first and
then it just like,
wow,
um, surprises you and it
is incredible. So,
um, he lives in Rio
Rancho and has a couple
of Children. He's a
great father, you can
tell. Um,
and um it's
really nice to hire someone
who's that um,
strong leader from
New Mexico.
So with that
Mr Chairman, uh we
have an amazing
team
and I think I'll stand for
questions or
uh that's your update,
>> questions, comments from the
committee.
Is that story,
>> Mr Chairman, I really do
think that these
are the best documents
that anybody in the
legislature produces
every year.
So I, I use them all the
time when people are always asking
questions that
the answers are in
these documents. So
I'm very appreciative
the LES C staff
and director.
>> I, I agree they're
easy to find the
information. It's easy to
digest and understand
where that's not always
the case. I have to read things
three or four times in some of the other
documents to really understand
what it's trying to get to. And,
and these seem
clearer than, than what
we get from some of the other agencies
and such other questions,
comments,
if not tell us
where we go. Now, how do, where
do we meet for
our field trip?
And then also
Representative Baca
if you tell us about this
evening?
>> Certainly. Ok,
Mr Chairman. Um
we are all going to meet
at Meta um,
at the front
door there, I
suppose. Uh Again,
this is for um,
staff and
members only. It's not open
to the public. Um So
I wanted to, um, repeat
that, um,
since that meadow had
asked for us to
keep it as a closed
tour, uh,
we'll be there
for probably
about an hour or
so and then have some break
time and then, um,
have a wonderful reception
that is being hosted
by um
Representative Baca and
the Village of Lounes.
So you want to share
Mr,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you, actually, the
um
reception or the dinner will
be at two of those and it's
uh from all the
uh Valencia counties as far
as uh Tanya
Mita Bar Moya,
Senator Baca, Senator
Sanchez and
Representative Armstrong. So
uh that reception will
be at six
o'clock at TFI
Los for those of you who like the
candy apples. It's right next door to
Terry's Sweet Garden.
Um So you can do this. And
so um
as you said before, after the
tour, just kind of head over
to Teofilo. It's right here on main
street as far
as uh right across from
the big Luna mansion. So if you see the,
the, the, the Luna
mansion there, it's right
to the north of that Teofilo.
It's got a great story,
great history
and they'll make sure that they direct
you to, to where we're having dinner,
but that is for legislators
and staff. I hope that
you all can go and get some good
new Mexican cuisine here.
And uh I appreciate
look forward to seeing you guys
here.
>> Thank you any final
questions or comments for
today, other than
stuff at the tour,
if not, we will
adjourn for today
and we will see everyone back here
tomorrow at nine. Is
that correct? And are we able
to leave our, the various
papers and other things? We don't
have to worry about any of that. Very
good. Thank you very much.
Good day, everybody.
