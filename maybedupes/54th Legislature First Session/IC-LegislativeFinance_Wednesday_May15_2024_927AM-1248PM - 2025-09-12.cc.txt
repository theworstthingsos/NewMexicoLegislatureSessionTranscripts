I know as we move forward with the
resources that definitely
are available
and more resources that are going to be
needed. Um If
we can go ahead and address
uh the issue in
terms of how you're establishing
the pipeline for
uh future engineers
in our educational system.
And uh that'll be the
first one. The second is
uh as we move forward,
particularly as we
deal with um
the I
40 issue
and particularly, let's
say from the Texas
border coming across,
coming all the way through.
Um We know that that
is definitely in
dire need of uh of
much repair.
And, and so the second
question would be,
what other ideas do you
have in terms of how we
can secure additional
resources, you know, we
established the, the match
fund this last year and,
and uh during the
legislative session.
Uh But how can we secure
more resources? Because we
know that definitely is an
important uh
artery through our
state also
tied into. That is the
alternative uh
work that is going on
or will be going on around the
Raton area with
the 25 million that were
appropriated for that.
So, the second, of course, is going
to be uh ideas
in terms of leveraging
additional resources because
that definitely needs to be a
strong commitment of ours.
And then, and then lastly
as we deal
with all of this,
how do you see? And
I really appreciate this
report and hopefully we'll be
able to go ahead and get something like
that for each
one of the districts to help
people within our
communities, understand
the complexity and the
ongoing work and outreach that
you all continue with.
This definitely
is
an inundated issue.
There's so much to
it and you all are doing
everything possible to
take care of our, our
road issues.
But again,
the pipeline for
employees and then
secondly, other
ways that we can help leverage
resources. And if
we tie that together, then
definitely, hopefully
at least a fiveyear
period. Uh We'll
see that we're not only caught up,
but we're uh we're
definitely a state that does
have the full
uh range of
uh of health and safety issues
addressed as we, we
address our transportation here
in New Mexico. So with that Mr
Chair, I just pose
those two questions to the secretary
and to the individuals that
care to respond to.
Are you going to that AC L?
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you,
Senator. Um
So about two months
ago or so we started working on a
pipeline strategy for
the Department of Transportation.
And the, and the goal of course
was to get that out
to institutions of higher
education and other training
providers to help us with
the, the long term pipeline. Because
you're correct. And just as
recent as yesterday,
we had a conversation
about the need for us to
really start to take inventory of
our licensed engineers, their skill
set, their experience and start aligning
that. And we got to start
thinking about that statewide
because, you know, we,
we have gaps in some areas
and we start thinking geographically
limiting, you know,
who can we send there.
But we've got to start thinking about how
we can leverage our engineer,
you know, depth uh
statewide um to help
in all parts of the state.
So two months ago, we started
this process and we started, and we
work with workforce solutions
and the higher education department
to develop a strategy,
um a multi pronged
pronged strategy that doesn't
just focus in on engineer
development, but it focuses on
how we're going to start recruiting for entry
level positions as well in
all of the various communities starting
with high schools and, and so
on. And so
about three weeks ago, we
released that proposal out
to institutions of higher education
and I can share it with the committee
and we um we, we
work with Secretary
Rodriguez at the Higher Education
Department to essentially get that
out to all institutions.
Saying here's our
strategy. We need you
all institutions to be our
official partners
and that prompted very quickly
a discussion with N MS U
Global and, and their
staff down in Las Cruces
who is really eager
to leverage N MS U Global
for uh training
for a number of key positions
because not just in engineerer
fields, but we have other
positions um short of
even college credentials, like
like um uh our
uh our bridge
inspectors, our engineering
techs, our P MS, our construction
managers, etcetera, etcetera,
where we need uh programs
that can train for those
professions as well because
they don't need to be engineers,
degreed licensed
otherwise. Um
So we have that
strategy out. We're looking
forward to the partnerships, everything
from growing our apprenticeships to
year round to repeat
to growing the wages for those
apprentices. I mean, right now,
if you want to be an intern,
rather an internship, if you
want to be an intern at dot
And you're just a junior in high school, we're
gonna pay you $20 an hour
to $18 an hour as a
high school student, as an
undergrad, it goes up as a graduate,
it goes up and we just want
to start bringing,
you know, students and potential
engineers into the field. So
that strategy is out there.
It's, and, and we can
share it with you and, and, and
any ideas you have to strengthen it will be
good. The I
40 your question about I 40
is significant. You all know that
we've presented and have
discussed publicly, you know,
the study, the preliminary
study that was done from Arizona
State line to Albuquerque,
which is half the battle that you discussed.
Senator. And
I think it's estimated
for, you know,
full, you
know, full construction on
six lanes interstate
at $3.8
billion or something like that.
Right. And
so, you know, stand to reason
that from Texas to
Arizona, you'd be looking at
double that amount to,
to really build out the capacity
by 40. And
there's a number of ways to go around
doing that project. Uh Federal
funding is always an option, but right
now, a lot of the new
federal funding is coming by way of
new programs or federal grants and
none of the grants are gonna fuel
a project to, to, to
that tune.
So I, I think working
with you all collaboratively,
um you know, there have been discussions
about, you know,
continuing, you know,
reviewing debt service
options with legislative support
for debt service. Um
Those are options. We're very
conservative agency when it comes
to incurring debt quite
frankly. And we're going through the process
right now of restructuring
it further to save more
money. Um
And then the approach the
legislature used in a, in a
strategic way where,
for example, the state through
severance tax bonds um could
support that initiative
because one time
appropriations, you know, would
have to, you know, would,
would take a long time and,
and they really would chip away
at your overall
budget.
>> So Mr Chair just in closing
and I know there's quite a few other
questions I have, but this is going
to be the the impetus
of it. I really believe
that we need to establish
a stronger revenue
stream, not
only to take care of I 40 but
our entire
transportation
system in New Mexico.
But again, I commend you, Mr
Secretary uh the
dot
Commission for
their hard work for their vision,
particularly Chair
Walter Adams. And
as we move forward, whatever I can
do to assist, please let me know. But
again, thank you and I commend the
efforts that you put forward. Thank you,
Mr Chair. Thank
you.
>> Um Thank you, Mr
Chair, Mr
Secretary. I
know that the the delays,
whatever the delay is, whatever the
reason is currently
just cost a ton of
money. So
for Pinon Hills uh
extension in
Farmington,
according to Mayor
Tom Taylor, of course, he was mayor when
he was 12 and 18 hundreds.
But
um
when they first looked at
it, it was a $2.5 million
project, then
we got, I think $36
million now and it's
already not enough to finish
the project.
And then last
week, Department of Workforce
Solutions came out. Oh, you got to
pay everybody more.
Well, all of
the, everything's
done. So
now we're gonna have a delay because we
have to pay more. Now it's going to be more
than $42 million it's
gonna be $50 million or
whatever.
So the first and, and the same
with the Aztec uh
bypass, just delay,
after delay, after delay and now it's
double what it was
when we started.
Um
How do we, how do
we
stop the delays because the
delays are really
tearing up the
budget.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. And I'll
chime in on a couple of those things, Senator.
And then I'll, I know my
colleagues here know way better than
I, first of all,
I believe we're working with workforce
solutions on the wage rate issue
to minimize that impact.
So I, I think Secretary
Nier and I have, have
already had a back and forth to ensure
that the issued wage rate so long
that it hasn't expired
will prevail and, and we'll
be in, in good shape with
that project
for sure. But you're
absolutely right. I think
one of the things in
particular and I know this is a
preference of certainly our, our chief
engineer and staff is,
is, you
know, funding more projects with
state resources, right? Federalized
projects take a significant
amount of time. I mean, staying
in this area, right, with,
um with the second phase
of the Farmington
project
is moving
through the federal requirements
for Rightway acquisition,
right, which is slowing down
our ability to move the project
without it being fiscally
constrained. And
so funding more projects
with state resources simplifies
things and does reduce the amount of
time necessary to get those
things done.
But I'm gonna turn it over
to Rick and Lisa. They, I
know that they have, they
have put paper
to pen on every way to shorten
the time it takes to get projects to
construction.
>> Sure, good morning. Thank you, Secretary
Mr Chairman, members of the Committee
Rick Petty Executive Director.
Um So Senator Shair, that's
a great question. And there's a couple of
things that we need to do too because we experienced
that as well. Um
You know, kind of through that COVID
and pandemic.
Um You
know, there was three things that we,
that we did right off the bat.
One of them, we started a
stockpile um
notice to contractor which allows
the contractor um
to be able to purchase materials that are
hard to get or, um,
have a long lead time,
be able to, to purchase those
materials, stockpile them and then
we would pay them. So they didn't have to,
to, to eat that money.
Um And we created that stockpile
NTC for many commodities
and any still uh uh
commodities,
um, aggregates,
um, you know,
electrical equipment, signals and
lighting and things like that. And
it really helped a ton.
And then we also worked on,
for example, fuel escalation
and steel escalation clauses. So during
the contract, if, for
example, still were to go up by more
than 10% then we
would negotiate a new
contract price in order to kind
of fill in that gap
um, and help the contractors
and ease the contracts a little bit that
we were, there was some relief
there and that, that certainly
helped. Um And
then, and then lastly, we've been
really looking and, and and
talking about um
contract time, right?
Um A lot of times that we
provide contract time with
mandatory completion dates
um that really could
potentially um
hurt a contractor and
in that they would be limited
on how many contracts they could bid
at one time. So, by extending
contract time or making the,
the mandatory completion date
um prior to winter
and having allowing them all summer
to get some of these jobs
complete, um allows
them to bid other projects
and um kind of stockpile
them if you will and, and
be able to finish them at
their, at their own kind
of uh um construction
pace over the summer. Um
So those three things really
helped a lot and with
dot um I know
that they're not easy to do and they're not easy
to match because we do have fhw
a involved at, at all,
you know, at all facets. So it's, it's
difficult and those conversations are
difficult, but we were able to
weed through those and, you know,
those really helped us a to,
to kind of balance
that, that
um that cost and
the delays and um
those types of
things.
>> So Mr Chair,
I know we talked about
engineers.
Uh obviously
we have heavy equipment operators
and uh
and lesser skilled people
that are just gonna stand there and tell the traffic
to slow down.
Um But I am
confused and concerned
Mr
Chair,
we graduate a lot of
engineers.
They don't stay in New
Mexico.
My, my niece is one of
them
mechanical engineer,
graduated from New Mexico
State. And I don't
think, I don't think that she even
ate at mcdonald's before she
left the state
with an engineering
degree.
Yeah.
What can, what can we
do to keep those
folks here? Especially because
we're paying for their school
now.
>> Senator. She, I know two kids
that graduated with engineering
degrees this year. Right.
And they were starting
pay, they told me is their
job offer was at
200,000 a year
to start. I
don't know what your niece
got but dot
S District engineers are nowhere
near that. Right? Or any engineer
we have the pay
study should reveal some
of that right?
Where we are with engineers
and if we have to pay in that pay
band,
um I can't read my
copy yesterday because it had so many
dots on it.
But that should reveal
in the pay study where
we need to be to pay district
engineers and civil
engineers and
structural engineers. Right.
If we need to be in the $200,000
range
dot Has that ability
because your vacancy is still at
600. Right?
What's your vacancy at now?
>> It's about
444
>> 140 they move that money
around and budget it so they could
increase those engineering
pay scales without
any other budget
increase. The
study is going to reveal a whole lot
when it comes down to
what specific,
specifically
an engineer
at the environment department
needs or an attorney at
dot And an
engineer
for civil or
structural engineers gonna
that should reveal us to
where, what we need to
pay to hire those kids in New
Mexico. I don't know how you can,
can't require somebody in
a free market system to go get a
job somewhere
when they have a concert
in Austin every single
day. And the only time
they can get a ride
on a Disneyland ride is,
you know, this on 491
it's, that's almost better than a
ride on Disneyland with those dips
and everything in there.
And so that's, that's
a good question, but that pace study should
reveal a lot of
that.
>> Well, Mr
Chair,
that ride is, is only
good if you're exceeding the posted
speed limit
to make it a Disney ride,
which I would have never
done ever. But
that's why I know it's a Disney
ride.
Um
But again, to, to
both of you. So
if we're paying
for education, I think we
can say thou shalt
stay here for a
year or two years or 10 years
or whatever the number is.
But at the same
time,
if these things are costing
the state tens
of millions of dollars in
delays, it
may be worth finding hundreds
of thousands of dollars to
stop
it.
Yes. Um
But I think that that's,
that's just a
huge
uh
issue for us because I know
that just having the, the
folks to do it, whether they're
heavy equipment or engineers
is, is a huge problem for
us.
Um
I know that once you start
paying an engineer $200,000
well, then the environment department's gonna
want an engineer for $200,000
and blah, blah,
blah,
I don't care about them. Fix
the roads.
Um
But then kind of an unrelated
question. Rail runner.
Did we pay that off
yet?
>> Mr Chairman Senator, I
can't recall the amount
that's still outstanding, but
there's still some debt
service attributed to
those expenditures
remaining today.
>> Ok. >> So is that
a bonding capacity that we
could use if
any part of
it?
>> I, I was looking at your
P
I was looking at your pay study,
so I didn't hear the question.
>> So Mr Chair, the question
was about rail runner.
Uh Did we pay it off? He said
no, but the question
is, is that bonding capacity
still available to us
any part of
it?
>> So Mr Chairman, if I, if
I'm correct, that dates back
to 1998
authorized bonding
capacity at the time about
$1.6
billion. And
so that it was at in at
that time that the legislature
authorized the bonding
authority. The
last of that authority
was assigned
to projects in 2021.
I think it was about 240
million of it. And so to
date of that 1.6
billion. All but 1%
of it is either been or
spent.
>> Thank you, Senator Sheer to your point
on Tab E
page four
and the numbers aren't there
if you look under the EK
line and I'm getting
this from Joey and
you look at nine
number, there's a
one there on
18, the
pay study is going to show an engineer
should be making
$250,000
a year. That's
what our pay study is going to show
us.
The number is not there, but
on page four
and it's the EK the last
column line 18
1 that four
stepper five
step
12345
step increase is going to get engineers
to 250,000 a
year. And that's what the
pay study is going to reveal to
us. Thank
you. Thank
you,
Representative
Juan.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you as always for
uh what you do for the State of New Mexico.
I know it's a tough job and,
and we're all going to whine about our
districts that we don't
ever get enough money.
So um but
uh I, I'm
really wanted
to, to thank you for that
and for all you guys do, but I also
wanted to come back
to uh MS Bega
on this um on
the, the sheet
that you put out for the
mckinley County ongoing
construction projects,
um, which I'm proud
that, you know, you all
are working so hard,
uh, to get this
route, uh, in
better condi condition.
Um, I don't travel it
often. I traveled it
yesterday morning and,
and I see all the
improvements that you guys are making
and, and much appreciated,
but I want to draw your attention
to the map on the last page
that you did
um for district six.
And I see. Um,
you know, of course, here I go again,
Kathryn County,
uh with one little red
dot And I
just called,
um, maybe a week
ago, maybe two
weeks ago about
the conditions of highway 60
from Kamado
to the Arizona
border. Uh just
because of all the potholes
and, and things like that. I
know we're very rural, New
Mexico. I know we don't get a
lot of travelers, but that
is a main corridor for the
snowbirds. And so
I just wanted to make
sure that we're not just focusing
on mckinley and
Sibila, the little
piece of Sandoval, San
Juan Rio Ribo, which
I don't see a lot of dots there either.
But the majority of
uh in my district that I
represent Mr Chairman
and, and ladies and gentlemen is
that I have
different uh dot
district in every one of
my areas. So
it's really confusing
to try to remember who I'm
supposed to contact for what I
always have to look at the map every
single time. And
so I just want to make
sure that you don't forget about,
uh, Kron County
and that we can take
a look at that road. I talked
to a nice gentleman. I was trying to find
his name, um, online
or on my, in my contacts.
But, um, uh, it
is all of our
roads,
in my opinion, we need to be
putting a lot more money into
infrastructure, a lot more
money uh
because
we talk about economic
development coming to
New Mexico
while a and
we're doing a really good job like
the Los Luas exit
and, and the road between
here in, in Albuquerque and
Arizona from Arizona to Albuquerque
and I 40 I 25.
But we can't forget about those small
little routes
that people travel
every day.
Um
I just wanted to bring that to your
attention and, and, but
ultimately thank you
for what you do. Um
But just don't forget about
the little guys in the
rural New Mexico. So I
didn't really have a question. Just wanted
to remind you about that. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I did
have a couple of questions. The
first is on the
sheet that was
provided at the top
of the pile. The state and general
fund allocations
question I had for the cabinet
secretary, Mr Chairman
is when I look at your
2021.
Um I'd like to know
what the contract term was on
that. In other words,
why is,
what is the
balance?
In other words, you've got a
grand total of
over $41
million here.
So I'd like to know what the balance
is for each one of those
communities. You don't have to read them
now. But why wouldn't there be a column
there? So you can see what's
outstanding
>> Mr Chairman Representative that
we can provide that.
Absolutely. Since
they draw down on reimbursements,
typically there's a few that are disbursements
we can provide to
you what the balance is
against each of these agreements.
>> I think it's important for the committee
to know that Mr Chairman when you
look at 2021
and you and I'm just looking
at mckinley County
now and
it's 100 and
90,000
and then you've added these additional
dollars. I'd like to know what the
balance is.
And I'd also like to know
what the term of the contracts are
and how is that determined?
Does the term of the contract?
Is it three years? Is it
four years because this isn't
capital outlay?
So what is that? How are the terms
of the contracts
determined?
>> Mr Chair representative, as I
mentioned, there's,
there's really three high-level
kind of buckets that the
requests come through
emergency high priority
project funding gaps
and unmet match. So
typically what we'll do
is provide the funding
and tie it to the
project itself. So if we gave
someone a TPF
award for
800,000 and they had
100,000 gap
and their TPF award was already
for two years. Then
we'll give that gap
for those two years. Give them
enough time to finish the project.
If they have a federal project
and it has to be done in one
year and they have a gap,
then we'll attach a one year
timeline to that
project to coincide with their
already existing project.
But Mr >> Chairman, the part
that's confusing me is when you see
state and general fund
allocations
is state not
General Fund,
>> Mister Chairman Representative,
it's not. And so
the State Road Fund, for example,
would be the non general
fund. So the state Road Fund
comes through the
tax distributions that you
all, of course, that we
negotiate with LEC
ahead of. And
the general fund would be,
for example,
if there was a section
nine appropriation
that said may be used on these
projects, but there was
another project added
by the agency that
funding would typically have a
three year life
cycle attached to it. So if
we gave it to an agency, we wouldn't
be able to give it for longer than
that. And so that's the
difference. It would either be State Road
Fund or a
general fund appropriation. >> I
think that's important for local
governments to know Mr Chairman
because
they're going if they're the
lead, if they're the lead
agency for these
projects and not the
state, it's going to be on their
construction timeline.
So I think it'd be important Mr
Chairman to know what the balance
is for each one of these
projects because
they have different out year
allocations.
And Mr Chairman, I'd like to ask the
department due to high vacancy
rates. I had no idea. And that
following this
closely for about a
year, it's at
440
people. What's that
percentage of vacancy
rate?
>> Mr Chairman Representative. So it's
been on a steady down
turn for about the
last 12 months. It's
about 15%
now.
And so yeah, it's,
it's a high, it's lower than the
statewide average of vacancies,
but you spread the
400 out over the state
in six transportations. I mean,
you have like DD
six has the
best vacancy rate. It's
what, 6% or
something like that right now.
And so when you pepper the
400 out, you don't have a
glaring issue,
but even just
being short, two or three
individuals in some divisions,
especially in our engineering
department, it's a big
deal. >> So Mr Chairman,
because of it being part of
the engineering division,
how much has that increased your
contract budget
for outside engineers,
>> Mr Chair
Representative, I don't
have that among, but you're, you're making a
safe assumption there that
typically what will occur
is for projects
where the
additional oversight
and augmentation support is
necessary. Then we use that
on, on, on contract
support. >> I think that would be an interesting
number to see Mr Chairman
because is
it a better
investment to have a
higher salary rate
or is it a better
investment to continue to pay
for contracts? They are
one time investments.
Uh The other question I have
Mr Chairman for this
district and correct me
if I'm wrong. Uh I
understand that our
district engineer is planning
on retiring. Is that
correct?
>> Yes, Mr
Chair, >> what's the
succession plan for that, Mr
Chairman?
>> Sure. Uh Mr
Chairman Representative, we actually
are bringing in a, a contractor
to help us with succession planning for
the entire agency,
right? So
we finished up that contract
and so we're bringing a group that's
gonna actually
sit with
critical positions like our
district engineers like the one
Mr Padilla holds and chief
engineer positions, etcetera.
And what they're essentially going to
do is two things.
One is draw from these
critical positions,
they're going whiteboard this
job. This is what this position
does from the perspective of the
individual who holds it. Now,
what is their institutional
memory? What are the things
that, you know, could have
improved on, you know, their
role within the department,
etcetera. And that's the
first thing we're going to do and we're gonna try and
get that done by the end of the calendar
year. The second thing
they're gonna do is help us embed
into the agency as
part of our, our personnel,
you know, our, our hr
processes is how
do we essentially do that
for every single critical
position? So over the next
several months, we're being very intentional
about bringing a, a
contractor who's
gonna essentially at some
point sit with these
engineers right here
and draw from them, what we
need to say, all
right, to replace them. This is
the skill set. These are the tasks,
these are the responsibilities,
et cetera, et cetera. So that's what
we're doing to do long term
succession planning
specifically for this position.
And any other for which we receive
notification of resignation or
retirement is our
goal will be to fill the
district engineer position far
before MS Vega
departs. And so that there's
an opportunity for transition
and >> that, so let me ask you
madam chair, what
is the salary
that would be offered then?
And I'm concerned about that
because what I don't want to see
happen is an
engineer that's assigned out of
Albuquerque to try to
cover district six.
I really want to see an
engineer that is full
time in district six
in the district six
office. So
I'd like to know how is that going to
be recruited?
>> Um Mr
Chairman um madam
chair and representative,
it's been my position
that our recruitment has to,
you all may be familiar that I come
from, you know, like the higher
education background,
right? And if
you see what institutions of higher
education do to recruit high
level officials, albeit a
basketball coach
or a president,
the, the resources that
they spend to
promote a position and
support even a relocation
to the area for some of those critical
positions is, is
big. And so it's
my expectation for
these high-level positions
that we move through the
exercise of
that level of recruitment.
Um spending some resources
to go out to Colorado,
Arizona, Utah, neighboring
states and talk about the
opportunity. And
then beyond that is when they get
here is we need to really showcase
the department, right? It can't be just
your interviews at two o'clock come
in. We'll, we'll ask you questions
for two hours and we'll
see who does best even
with our three position,
our district three engineer position.
Mr Padilla did the interviews but
provided an opportunity for
the district community to come in
and interact with those applicants
and give them a sense of
here's the community, here's what they're
concerned with and, and
let them chime in on the,
on the quality of those applicants.
And so I think what
we've got to really do, especially
in communities
where
we know that we're going to have to
present opportunities for housing,
you know, options for housing.
We we may in some instances
need to consider employing the
spouse of the
district engineer. We need
to introduce them to the school system
if they have Children. So
those that's kind of
the the the
recruitment culture from where I
come that I want to bring to
dot for some of these high-level
positions. >> Ok. So Mr
Chairman, we can expect
that for this district
engineer uh
position when it does come
open. >> Absolutely.
That that's my expectation, not
just for the district engineers
but for some of our critical engineer
positions. >> Thank you very
much. And the other question I had
Mr uh Mr Chairman,
it's looking at the second
document that you provided.
Uh I'm looking at
CN uh the very
first project I 40
Cooly Interchange.
I have a question about why
the um construction
date is
April
2621
and then it doesn't resume for
another year. What,
what's that
about
>> Mr Chair
representative? The
the the construction start date
was actually
when the notice
to proceed happened and then the
construction actually
started.
And so we had some
winter
um
suspensions and things
like that that had happened.
>> So Mr Chairman, my question
is is if a construction
project of this magnitude
of $19 million
is delayed,
how is
the multiplier
uh determined when
you have increase in
construction costs?
How is that
done?
>> Um Mr Chair
representative on this
particular project, we did
have the some of
the items that we talked about.
We did actually add
by change order, the
notice to contractor
onfi escalation.
Um We also
did some design
changes which did
in in actuality cause
some delays and we did
sit down with the, the
contractor and also
execute a change order to
absorb some of those costs
on, on their part. >> I
think what my point is, Mr
Chairman on this is that
if you do that consistently
across the state,
what is those change order
increases really look like?
And what, how does that impact
your budget?
II, I was surprised
to see that it was that much
time for
an, for an interstate
project. I'm very familiar with
where that project is located.
I had no idea that it would have
had that kind of delay.
Um I guess the
final question I had is
that Mr
Chairman, as I'm looking at
the current
and upcoming studies in
mckinley County.
This box culvert
project at exit
eight is very close to where
we had problems
with the
um uh
rail
rail. Uh This
project that we just
talked about
what happens if that doesn't
get
fixed.
>> Mr chair
representative
without being able to
utilize New Mexico
118 as a
detour. Then you
have what happened when we had the
derailment which is we have
to send
and detour everybody
on us. 491
on New Mexico, 53
New Mexico 602.
So or even
I 25.
So it's very important that we're
able to
accommodate all types of
vehicles on our
frontage road
system. >> So I
think that's an important
piece after we just heard of
the derailment issue.
If that isn't
fixed,
then what impact
we have across the
board, I think,
and, and I think George is right when
he says the national economy
is affected by this,
if that isn't fixed,
I think that
not only New Mexico
but everyone that's
traveling west
would have the same kind of
problem. I think
that needs to be
a priority. And I don't
understand why
this isn't considered
part of a bridge
initiative.
And I know you have a separate bridge
budget.
Yes, it could.
But can't you guys put it on there
then can't you put that on the
bridge initiatives? Then there's a
separate bridge
budget that
this could be put
under
>> Mr Chair representative. You're
correct. We receive bridge funding and
so we can look into prioritizing
that understanding. Of course,
that the priority for
escalating that
alternative detour route
is about a month
fresh.
>> I appreciate you also putting
the letting dates on here. I
appreciate you all doing that. Thank you,
Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you Mr Chair.
Thank you Mr Secretary for what
you do. I truly
believe that economic
development drives
in. It doesn't fly
in, doesn't fall out of the sky,
it drives in on good
roads and especially
in the part of the state where I live, it
does do that.
The first time I saw this
year's budget, there was
$40 million in the
transportation budget.
And that was frightening to
me coming off a year
when we had 300 million in
it. I,
you probably
saw, I whined, I
cried, I complained,
I bellyached.
It finally left the house
with about 100 and 40
and,
uh, went
to the, went
to the Senate. Thank you
senators for kicking
it up to 400 million.
What I was told is, well, you
didn't spend the money from last
year. We've already talked
about engineers,
but the other thing out
there is contractors.
When I, when I was young, there
was brown construction,
there was a huge
contractors that built road in the
state. Apparently not enough of
it because we're still
very short.
My
testimony
in the
in committee was
if we don't keep something in the
budget for these contractors
to know that they're gonna have work next
year, uh, they're not
gonna stick around the, the
contractor that's doing 39
is out of Colorado. I
mean, perfectionist. If
they do a beautiful
job, beautiful job,
we need to
develop our own contractors
in state. I'm talking
about road construction
contractors and we
need to get the ones that are
good from out of state,
bring them in here and make them,
make this their home.
Uh,
we cannot do that if we
don't fund our roads
and we cannot have economic
development if we do not
fund our roads. What
are we doing? We've
talked a lot about what we're doing
for engineers, but
for road construction
contractors that
rebuild our roads,
what are we doing to help
push that forward so
that we do spend the money and that we
do have that they do see a
future here for
them.
>> Well, uh Mr
Chairman representative,
I think you hit the nail on the head. What they really
want is stability, right? I
think from investments
in heavy equipment to standing
up, you know, what they need
for material
and understanding what
the, what, what our letting forecast
is going to be from a dollar's perspective.
That's really what they ask us
for now. Do they still
struggle from time to time also with
workforce? They
absolutely do. Um,
and, and we see that
when we let
something and we get, you know,
one bid and,
you know, it's 10 15%
above the, the engineer's estimate.
We know that this
contractor is essentially saying, hey,
listen, I'm gonna have to really pay to
get folks over here and to
get this work done.
And so to, you know, to your
point about growing their bandwidth
overall, the number of contractors
in the state of New Mexico, it does
create a more competitive
space, right? And the
availability of them is,
is less concerning for us,
but certainly in rural parts of the
state, we, we will see
that um you
know, they um
you know, they're kind of
uh head down tackle
the biggest projects that they
can, you know, really does
interrupt their ability to take on some
of these smaller projects. But I
think to answer your
question point is that stability
that if we invest in this
workforce, we invest in this
equipment that
we know that there's work available
for us for the foreseeable
future.
>> So Mr Chairman,
lastly, I would
like to remind
everyone that I 40
doesn't stop in Albuquerque.
I I 40
for us, stops at the Texas
line and
uh from
Tucumcari,
actually from
Albuquerque
there, there's holes in that thing.
You can lose your pickup
in. I mean, you hit
that thing in your front
door. I just had my
car had to be totally
realigned from all the
from hitting those things.
I know we did one lane on
going and coming, but
it was just kind of a
you all know the
difference in the type of treatments
that you did do, but
then it was a much appreciated
a place or two. It's
already, uh, beat
out. But, uh,
we
six, I
agree that I 40 needs
six lanes. Probably.
I'd just like four
lanes that worked. It didn't
have all in them. Uh, they didn't
knock the front end out of my car.
So, uh, please
remember I
40 from the, from
Texas to, to Albuquerque
also. It is a, a
real corridor
for money into our
state. Thank you, Mr
Chair,
>> quickly Mr Chair.
I want to brag a little bit. I want
to brag a little bit on the district
two engineer Francisco
Sanchez and his
presentation that he made in
t it
seemed to be a lot of I
am on that
overpass over there
and it's, it's a good
thing. Uh
We're trying to keep the viability
of two little towns
there there,
business, small
business area, they do
that. And so I
appreciate the
redesign
there. Uh
and also want to
put, put some
brag in on, on
the construction engineer
uh uh Michael
Smelter
Smelser
and he is a
really a
dandy and
he helped me uh
go into some of those secondary
roads around
around Clovis there
and I think it was
77
maybe it's a small
road back in
there. I was having some
real issues with
some high
erosion
and uh
they, they came
up with a little bit of a plan
there and that helps some of the
local, uh,
keeping their fences up.
It just, you know,
we all talk about the
big, uh, events
we had over around Clovis
and the high rainfall
last year and it was
just very destructive
to some of those, uh,
side roads
and different things. And
so, you know, you
have your boatload
everywhere. I
realize that.
But, uh, thank
you for, for
those guys to come
out and, and help
solve some local issues.
Uh It's, it's a big
deal that, that bypass
deal has been,
you know, thank
goodness, I didn't promise
that
12 years ago when I got
elected,
but it's, it's,
it's a needed
thing. And I, I think we
got some community buy in on
this, this design
this time.
>> Senator. That's a, that's a really good
project. It's a good partnership with
Texas because
that, that uh that
great separation will kind of straddle
the border, but fundamentally
they'll submit the grant. We'll
come in with the match, manage
the project. It's, it's a good
collaborative with Texas.
>> Yeah, I think
we're, I think when we have
the local buy in now, I think
we're, we're golden
and I know it's
still years down
the line, but
at least we have a plan
to cover to close
these three crossings
and, and get a little bit
more help through
some, some
grants and things.
So it'll be a big deal.
So, thank you on
that.
>> Thank you. Uh I don't
have any other questions. I'm gonna ask you
something. I know it's on your agenda that
you're gonna refinance a
bond. Why
are we refinancing that
bond at 5%
at current rates? And what is it
currently at
and why are we refinancing
that bond? >> Sure,
Mr Chairman. So at every other
commission meeting, uh nm FA
provides updates to the commission on
our current debt structure
and about four
months ago, um our
advisor provided
um insights to the commission
that uh the current rates
could provide some relief on our
series 2014
bonds, which is about
100 and $23
million. And
so um the insights they
provided was uh
basically a refund of
those bonds for a series
2024 bonds would save
us about $9 million
between now and 2032
when the debt was expected
to be paid off
anyway. And so
the way we're going to propose it
is we anticipate saving
in about $9 million
and we can get the debt paid
off a year earlier um
by 2031. And
so that's the presentation
we'll provide to uh commission for
their consideration next
week. >> And, and
now that we figure out a way to
fund you without
increasing road tax
and without bonding,
right?
I mean, it's a cautious
tailor. We need to get out of the, we need
to get out of debt because it at
some point this is going
quit where we're gonna have cash
and we're gonna need that flexibility.
But if we don't pay off this debt
sooner and earlier,
then we, when we do hit that
point,
they're gonna be looking at us even harder
saying you have this bonding debt from
2032 just say it happens in
25
not just a comment,
not a guess or anything,
then they're gonna look at all the bonding
debt across the board when you say, well,
we refinance those bonds
in in 24
to 32 instead of paying
them off 25
and not having that bond debt and
having what's the
capacity of that bond? What is,
what is a dollar amount 100 and
say 100 and >> uh
Mr we'll, we'll the
that series that will refund is about 100
and 23 million. And,
and our, our debt service
coverage is, is
actually pretty phenomenal.
Um Usually a debt service
coverage of three times.
Your debt service is considered
really good for a bond rating company.
Um In this structure, we won't be
less than 8.6
debt service coverage.
So I I think just dot
Overall has been conservative
and that goes all the way back to
basically 1998
for the grip projects.
>> Yeah, but, but in
this scenario
where we're in this
cash influx of money
paying off bond debt
makes our financial
statement look so
much cleaner across the board at
the state. I mean,
that's why we structured
the stuff the way we did it right
is not to bond stuff
for five years out. The governor's
water plan wanted to do something
for five or 10 years
out. And,
and we know
that while we have cash and our building
cash, our financial statement
could
improve our bond ratings
overall from a AA
to a AA plus
or AA minus, which
reduces that rate even
greater when we borrow that money.
So I'm
cautiously watching that the rail
runner, we just need to get paid
off. I'm
so tired of that thing. They just need to
put a casino with
alcohol on it. Maybe it'll make a
profit.
But other than that, it's like the spaceport
is just, it's a drag on the
state for the bonding that we do
and we just never quite get
there, uh, where
we hired where and then
Lisa, I don't know if you
turn, I don't know if this is,
you're gonna be leaving us at some
point. Right.
>> Yes, Mr Chair, my plan
is to leave at the end of the
year.
>> So thank you for,
we may not see you again before the
end of the year, but we may but thank
you for everything you did for this
district, >> right? Fiscal
year or >> end of the
calendar year.
I didn't caler
but,
uh, and, and,
and first of all,
thank you for everything you did for us
and hard work. It's a lot of take. This is a
large district, right?
Pretty much goes from reserve
to
almost a little north of here
and from the state line
to, to Las
Lunas to
the cut-off road. So that's a large
district to cover. And so we
appreciate that and
people may not say it, but at some
point in time when we call you and I
try not to call you very often,
but you know, people
complain, we have to reach
out and
so thank you. Uh So
Ricky where we, we don't have
a district engineer in how
many districts and how many are
coming to retirement.
>> Uh So Mr Chairman,
we only in one district.
Um And so we just made a job
offer um
today, yeah,
maybe this morning we made a job offer
for the position in district three.
And to our knowledge, this
is our only retirement
in district six.
>> And so
what did you offer
him in, in pay? And
is he a degreed
engineer?
>> Uh Mr Chairman, I believe that
by statute, the district
engineer has to be a licensed
professional engineer.
Um Yep. And so
he is going to be a
licensed engineer and
what we do for parody
essentially is, is
very little degrees
of freedom from
the other engineers. And I think
the rate of pay for our district
engineers across the board is
something like
7171
between 71 and $72 an
hour. About 100 and
63,000.
>> Ok. Well,
what we may send Deloitte to you
because I mean, if we're going to hire those
engineers, right, we're gonna change
that pay structure
and I don't have the numbers
here. I just have X's and
ones to get that. So
you should probably start looking at
that and make sure that
we're aligning district engineers
if they are engineers in the right
categories,
some of them may be categories
incorrectly
which would give them a higher pay
and, and we're gonna have to fix that
problem. But the ones you're
job offering now,
according to our Deloitte study
and our, our talks
with the executive on getting
the pay
correctly is
you should probably be looking at that
number. So you're hiring at the
correct rate in
order to get those. I
mean,
uh, in Lisa's position,
which will come up in December, I mean,
hopefully you're looking right
now
and she's going to move out that you're
making job offers right now,
either internally
or
are somewhere in the system. So
when she leaves, there's a smooth
transition, we're not
having this vacancy gap
as we move forward, especially going through
those months.
Um,
this year in your in your budget year.
How, how is that money
getting doll getting
spent? And we have it
all budgeted and
ready to roll in after
the uh uh
uh on July
1. >> So,
so Mr Chair, we do
actually, what we're hoping to launch
in the next three weeks is a dashboard
that will account for every
single dollar we
received in the last legislative
session. And so
what we'll do is track
on a public facing
dashboard, the
section
11 or was it 11
funding? Yup, section 11,
funding we'll have on a public facing
dashboard where it's allocated by
project. We'll
also have that for the
70 million allocation
that was assigned to those
40 projects on the dashboard.
And we'll show you exactly
where it's going and the process
and treatment will provide for each of those
projects. And then
we'll also track the
120 million
that we've assigned to
each of the districts for
maintenance. And so
we have all those allocations made
now and we're working with our, it to
get the public facing dashboard out
as quickly as
possible.
>> And so on the maintenance side
are the districts telling you that where
they want the maintenance money or who's
making that termination,
Lisa. Are you doing that in your
district? >> Mr Chairman?
And sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt
Lisa, but um so
what we did earlier this year
is we sat down with all the districts.
Um We had them program out
about, I'd say $30
million. And then when
we actually went to the district to start
program programming those projects
out, we went directly from their list,
their need. Um
you know, the, the projects that they
had on the top of their list. So we started
checking those off first
and making sure that we are,
you know, we, you know,
we try to touch everything like Lisa
said,
>> you say you have any additional
comment?
>> Uh Mr Chair, no, we
did as Rick
indicated, we did, he asked us
to put some lists together,
we visited with, with
himself and John
Romero and we were able to get
most of our needs
addressed.
>> What do you mean most of your needs?
All, all your needs should be in
the kind of address because
you only had a $6006
million maintenance
number in
prior years. Now
you got 25 additional.
So you should be pushing
31 million
in maintenance
where we short in
District six for
maintenance,
>> Mr Chair. What
I was indicating is that we have a lot
more need than we do
budget. So although
we did get this additional
funding, there is still
going to be some additional
needs
in some of the outlying
areas. You know, a lot
of that funding is going to go
to I 40
US 491
and these bigger larger
roads, but we do still have
some needs on some of our
smaller routes.
So, >> on 491 are we
going to take the roller coaster ride
out there? I mean, really,
if you, if you're pulling a horse
trailer or something
across 491
it's almost a better ride than
at Disneyland.
I mean, and, and
so are we gonna take
those
dips? I mean, when you hit them, you
hit them and they're, you're really not
prepared for them
unless you drive that road
enough. Are, are we gonna
fix those
intentions
in maintenance
>> Mr Chair? We are going
to make a good attempt at
it. There, there is a lot of
clay on
all of us 491.
So even if we
dig, I mean,
with some of these, the four
lane, when we reconstructed,
we were in areas where we
were digging 10 ft and
still and still
in that clay muck.
So, unfortunately,
with the, the soils
that we have out there,
it's a very difficult
proposition, but we are definitely
going to make an attempt at
it. >> Some of
those are
pretty in it and I go,
my district now goes all the way
to snotty, right.
That's where the road that,
that representative Allison was
talking about. That crosses into
Arizona where they're doing a lot of bridge
work, right? So, driving
that road and then driving to grandson
I 40 quite a bit. I mean,
even the mill and overlay,
there's a big void out there
currently right now and it just keeps
getting bigger and, and so
we, you know, mill and
overlay is good, but in
that area it failed
on I 40. And
so I need to get
some attention to that.
I think everybody in the room
probably, you know, they'll hit
it on their way out of town. So
the, the district engineer's
office in case you want to get off
and complain is get off at
the Milan exit. You go take
a left, you hit
the, I forget the road,
but you take another left and you'll be at
the district yard office.
So
just So, you know, uh, I,
40 I mean, I don't know how we're gonna
fix. I, 40 I mean, if it's
$3.5 billion
to fix that into
six lane road, that probably
doesn't include bridges
and each bridge, the one
they're gonna put at Church Rock is
$60 million. So, if you
just take an average of that
right
across from
the Arizona line to here,
that's five, probably five or six
bridges, that's
five times six, that's
3.350
million just for the bridges
in just a 20
mile radius. That
doesn't include going the other way. So, I
mean,
I don't know, I'm a firm believer
if the state police would enforce
the right-hand lane traffic and maybe we
got tighten that, that
would help because
the truck drivers are now
hanging the left lane because the
right lane so, so
rough and, and
so I don't know how we're gonna
fix that, but it's across
the board. It's all of I
40.
And then with the, what happened
in the, in the train wreck,
those roads across
that they rerouted
around and never
probably seen traffic like that
before. And so now
we're gonna see failures on
those roads,
those two lane roads are not
designed for those loads.
And so now we're gonna see f
that, a commodo
and all through that area
going around and,
and, you know,
uh, I think they're working on the
road from window rock to
Galla, but those
road failures are gonna be pretty
bad and even from
Church Rock to
Pinedale or when they reroute
through there, those road
failures are gonna be even more. So, I don't
know how we're gonna get that caught up.
Um,
I keep hearing there's a roundabout
on the north side of town that
I, I'd advise you to
quit that because
on that interchange nobody's
gonna understand a roundabout
And I went through one the other day
at Ganado, right?
And it is so wore
out and that's not a high
traffic road
and nobody's gonna be able to
get around that roundabout and,
and do that. It's just gonna,
it's kind of a dumb
idea to
do that. And, and
that roundabout is just
won't make common sense on
interchange. Is there any other interchange
in the state of New Mexico when you get
off and you'll have a
roundabout?
>> Well, actually the one
at, um,
at the casino
has I, it
has one too
>> and, and that one is pretty wore out
too and I got a feel there the
other day. So that's
another cautionary tale.
Um, the main concern
for me is we have all
this money and we're still short
on hiring
and you have 400 vacancies,
but last year was around
600.
And so how
are we going to fill that
400
vacancies? I
mean, to get road maintenance
out by dot I
mean that is when we fund
you guys, our goal is to for you
to hire employees
and to fix the potholes and
do that. But if you're 400 employees
short, how are we going
to get those employees hired?
So, from
all corners of the
state.
>> So, yeah, Mr Chairman, that's it.
And, and that's the strategy. I
refer to Senator Campos
from the high school
recruitment to the post-secondary
recruitment and, and we'll share the plan.
It's very high level two
page. But
I I mean, there,
there, when you look at
it some elementary things
that we could be doing to
really just go out
visit with high school students. Take,
for example, the project you worked on
with the B Proby proud
to take to follow
that semi truck
to a high school with our
equipment. Get
students excited, interview
the seniors offer
them jobs as highway maintenance,
upper, you know, a highway maintainer
basics in the same
day before they
graduate high school are things
we've got to be doing for entry level
positions, right? And so
there's just gaps with just
grassroots efforts that
we, that we've already kind of been
doing. I mean, right now, we have that
ability, even with our interns, we're
giving the ability for our chief engineer
to go out and say we're
interviewing you, here's
the offer letter we want
you in two weeks. And
so, um I'll share
the plan with you all and if you have
any ideas for how we can,
you know, enhance it and it's not this
long drawn out plan. It's,
how can we start doing this next
month? >> Yeah.
I mean, that may help a little bit. Like
yesterday we were in grants and we
weren't aware of this but they
have a heavy equipment
operating school
inside the prison at
Springer.
Right.
We, as a state are we allowed
to hire, hire people that are
on parole or probation?
I don't know. I, I just don't know,
I'm asking but they were
teaching those women how to run
excavators and heavy
equipment.
Right.
And we have women
that work for us that are just
a good truck drivers as they
are operators. Right?
And, and so are
we can, we
hire
>> Mr Chairman? That's a great question.
And, you know, we've entertained
that,
that little project.
Uh, it's been about, I'd say two or
three years where we wanted to,
um, have
that ability to hire
those individuals, for example,
on winter maintenance
to be able to, to get, put them
in a truck and be able to
drive and,
uh, rely on them to actually get
the job done. Um,
we entertained it. We, we work
through the process, I think
at the end of the day, I think, um,
the insurance is probably
what kept us from actually
entertaining that pro making it
a reality. But it is
possible. I mean, we believe in second
chances. Um, our people out in
the field aren't perfect, believe me.
Um, but uh, we believe in
them and I think they, uh
they, they, we produce some really
good operators. Our program
is full. Um, you know,
John has worked tremendously
on our, our heavy equipment
operation down in Roswell, New Mexico.
Our classes are full and we're pumping
them out as fast as we can.
Um So it's, it's been very
working, very good for us
>> and, and just to go back to
representing Chatfield
s comments
about getting contractors, right. The
hardest thing to do in New Mexico
is to become a young contractor,
right? Because you got to put
in the hours and then you gotta
have a contractor to sign
off on your license and
are they willing to do that? Most of them
aren't because they can see this
competition and,
and so that becomes a
problem in, in, I don't
care if you're framing a building
or paving a road
or doing whatever
that, that
group of contractors. And
we'll probably gonna have to change that
and look at that has such
a tight control on
everything and
getting people into the
contracting field
that
you're not gonna get the growth that you
want.
And, and so as
contractors
retire, move off
whatever happens, right,
you're getting less and less
and that circle gets tighter and
tighter and then
that's why you're paying a premium
for, for getting
jobs and, and they have
to bid four or five jobs at a
time and they're trying to do all four or
five jobs and it's just in,
it's impossible to do,
especially if you look at
the bridge work. Right. That's just
structurally. So, takes
so time consuming to
do. You guys
are gonna have to come up with some idea
to get contractors
in the field and competitiveness. I
mean, otherwise we're gonna see
these companies by
other companies in New Mexico
and, and they're
gonna be nonn New Mexico owned
companies that are, that are moving
in and that's a lot of them are that way.
The big boys are that way in,
in contracting a lot of
them. You look who's doing
the, the stuff out here,
uh, by the casino.
That's the largest construction
company in the world,
right?
And, and when you need
that local economy and growth,
so the county
complained about hiring contractors,
but then they do a sole source
contract and
so only one contractor gets it.
And so when there's no competitive
bids or no other contractors
allowed in, in the
market,
and I'm just talking about young
people that want to work and, and
grow up. I mean, the hardest thing to
do is to get that
experience.
We don't have a school. I'll give you
the perfect example. My son went
to, he
rodeo, but he went to community
college in Arizona,
right?
He got his heavy equipment, he
got his OSHA, he got
his grade certificates,
his all in one
whack at, at one school. And
we don't have that in New
Mexico to
create those guys that
operate heavy equipment and
run blades and
all in one school
complete.
And Ariz A dot
Arizona Department of Transportation
hired out of that school like
crazy and
contractors hired out of that school
like crazy.
>> Mr Chairman. We'd love to have
any high schoolers
come our way. We have a very
robust program and we could pump
them out just as fast, I bet.
And uh, there we're a one
stop shop. They can come in. I can teach them
just about anything. >> So
you guys have that at dot
>> Yes, we do. We have a trading
academy down in Roswell. I
can teach them dozer blades.
Bacos
transports just
about any piece of equipment that we
have operating here in the state
of Mexico. I can teach it to you
in about a week. >> And do we have
them housing and how do they
get certified? Right. >> This
certification program. Yes. So
they'll, to, to come on as a
basic require that they get
their CD L. Once they
get their CD L through
some OJT,
then we'll move them right into Roswell
and we'll start, you know, whatever
that particular patrols lack if they
need. Um, for example,
uh, equipment operators to handle
snow trucks. Well, we have the
simulator, um, we
have, uh, you know, some pretty
specialized equipment down there and
we can pump them out in a couple of weeks
and they'll be pretty proficient.
>> I mean, why do you require
me to get your CD L?
First?
>> Mr chairman and members
of the CD L is so
important. Basically in
the field, all we do is hire equipment
operators. We don't hire
um, office staff or
secretaries or bookkeepers,
things like that. The only thing we hire in the
field is equipment
operators and that's critical and
crucial too. Basically, it's
mission critical for us
and, >> and I know, well,
all these young kids are getting their
CD LS, right? And then all
our insurance are denying
them.
And I don't know if the state is a problem,
but if you come out of school,
you know, you get a CD L at
18, your
insurance says they're 18
years old, they have no driving
experience. We're not gonna insure
them and some of them are spending,
you know, 17
to $20,000 getting
their CD L.
I think here in Gallup it's
about, it's
about 6000 a
driver because we have some going
through it. Now, that's what we
hear. And so,
but the insurance is denying
them right? And when a
CD L driver cannot have any
tickets, any DWIs,
any past history
and those kids are spending that money
at 18. And they're
saying,
so how does the state handle that
when, when
on their insurance, when they
have an
1820 year old CDL
driver with no
experience today?
I know the state cover
that. >> Yes, Mr
Chairman, the state does cover
that.
So it sounds like we're a pretty good option
then I, I reckon,
>> well, if your pays
right, because they're spending
$20,000 to
get their CBL.
Right. That's a whole
another kitty. But, I mean,
we ought to expand that training
program. Not just
have it in, in Roswell,
you ought to have it in
maybe some, I'm just gonna
stay out here because I live here.
Right. And,
and to get more
kids because
at 18 or years old
and they want to leave while you're gonna send
it wrong. Well, I don't know if they're mature
enough to handle
that, but if they're kind of close to
home, you know, you can
have it in grants where they have a big
yard and,
and have that and,
and, and train those
but don't, don't limit them to one
area. That's, that's a
problem, >> Mr Chairman. I, I
think that, that you know, we,
we, we entertain that certainly.
And some trying to, trying
to branch that out a little bit. But when
it comes to heavy equipment
operators and, and learning how
to, to, for example, to
learn how to run a blade,
you need some, you need some acreage.
We need, we need a little bit of room.
Um, and we're not teaching just
one guy, so it's not just one blade.
I mean, we have, you know,
1012 blade operators,
1012 blades going at one time,
we're gonna need a little elbow room.
And I just, aside
from, you know, Expo, New Mexico, I
don't know if there's a place that can,
that can house 1213
blades and, and men and
women, you know, out there,
you know, try to spread them out as best
we can. >> Lisa has a whole
carrot farm next to
her
old carrot farm, milk
and give you capley
money to purchase that. But I mean,
you, if you really want to train him, that's
what you're gonna have to do is you're gonna have to
get him into the local market. I
mean, the B Pro B Proud
Truck is in Zuni this week,
right? I think on Friday
and that thing is just
exploded
into how many kids are going
through that. And the tracking
is kind of unreal
on how many tech jobs
are, are even excavating jobs
that they show interest in.
Right? I
think that representative
I'm showing you had question >> Mr
Chairman, I would just suggest that you
possibly reach out to the school
districts that are implementing the
CTE programs. I
know Socorro high school
kids graduate with their CD
L and they don't have to pay for
it. So I
think there's a recruitment
strategy there
in the high schools, just
a suggestion and I would love to go
visit it if we ever have a meeting
down in that area. Thank you, Mr
>> Chair, Mr Chairman. If I could just comment
on that, please. And
representative, I think that's great
and we are reaching out to the high schools
and what we'll do is we'll go to those high
schools. We'll do some recruiting,
we'll take some equipment, we take
our simulator, we have a mobile
simulator, we take it out there. They love
to drive that and well, I'll tell
you what, we'll get a line of kids
out that thing. And um you know,
like, like the secretary said,
we'd like to offer jobs on the spot
or come by and visit us this summer
and take a look at we can do because
we do have that equipment actually,
once they can, they see the grater,
the dozer, you know, at the
yard. Um Eyes
get pretty big. It's pretty
cool.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair, Mr Chair.
I would just, I would love a description
of the program and contact
information. I think
there's some quotes in my
area. That would love
to participate. Thank
you, Mr >> Chair.
I think you need to spread
the word about that program because
I never heard about it.
And 15
years later I, we're
learning about this and
there's a lot of kids that want to come in
and then supposes got to fix a problem
with hiring
once you and it, and it may not be
a small issue. Maybe an agency
issue too, not just speaking
for you, but
that lag time in
processing, right?
When a person needs a job needs
to be within 4 to 5
days or they're looking for another
job and
got themselves.
Ok. We look forward to seeing you
at the next LFC meeting. Keep
tracking where you guys are headed
and, and that's it.
So, thank you guys. Thank you for your
presentation. Enjoy your
trip home on I
40.
Stay in the right hand lane. You'll
hit those
potholes
on this
one,
Kathleen.
We
>> and then it's just always on. Hello.
Can everyone hear
me
wait for the chair
to,
>> he might have
to turn it off because I can see
feedback if there's 22
of these mikes that are on?
>> Ok. Got you. Thank
you.
All right. Um Good
morning, Mr, chair, committee
members. I'm, I'm
Doctor Kathlyn Gege. Um
LFC program evaluator,
I'm here today to present you
this policy spotlight on
regional recreation centers
and quality of life grants, which
is Tab H
in your notebooks.
So, first
I'd like to thank LFC S
Capital Outlay staff that
really worked hard on this
project. And I'd
also like
to thank and congratulate
the staff of the local government
division that set up this really
popular program.
And they're
here today to answer questions
at the end of the session,
this presentation.
So turning to page one
summary,
the legislature appropriated
$85 million in
2022 and
2023
for local recreation and
quality of life projects.
D fa set
up the regional recreation
centers and quality of life
grants program to distribute
the funds which were primarily
from the American Recovery
Act program. The
legislature did not
appropriate additional funds
in 2024.
We're now almost 18
months into this program.
This policy spotlight
asked, was this a good
investment, should
the legislature continue
dedicated funding for these
types of projects
and what improvements could
be made?
LF C's research found
that so far things are going
well. D
FA s application and award
process generally followed
best practices for capital
outlay.
There's some early successes
in project implementation and
other other cases
where outcomes are uncertain going
forward. We present
six case studies in this
report that illustrate
common characteristics for
project success and also some
risk factors.
There is value in having
these projects
of dedicated funding for
these types of projects
which otherwise might
compete with other
higher priority public
safety and infrastructure
needs. Um
There's also advantages over
local capital L A funding
in that they these projects are
vetted and more likely to be
fully funding.
Therefore, this report
recommends that the
legislature and D fa
continue funding
this program with
some additional best
practices um
incorporated to
better ensure project
completion.
So pa uh turning to
page two
background,
this section provides
an overview of funding
for recre recreation
and quality of life facilities.
As table one
shows
many local governments lack
resources to fund these
types of projects on their
own. Historically,
the state has supported
these projects through local
capital outlay
appropriations
and also through a
state match for federal
land and water conservation
fund
awards.
Chart one on page
three shows
that the federal money for
uh land water conservation
fund awards pretty much dried
up around 2000.
Um However, the state
has continued
to provide capital outlay
funding for and in the
past five years has funded
about 500
projects. Um
tolling 100 and $86
million
also. Um So
the, the state then created
the legislature appropriated
the $85 million for
this um program
that we're talking about today. And
it also uh in the past
session created the new Mexico
match fund with the goal of
leveraging federal dollars.
And I know that you've heard some about
that already um in this
meeting. So
turning to page
five,
uh DF set up
the uh new grant
program quickly and projects
following best practices are
on track for
completion.
This section um
first looks at how D fa
implemented the program
and then looks at how local
governments are implementing their
projects. And as I
said, we, we present
some case studies
um that illustrate what can be
learned from this pilot period
of this program.
Um And I just want to point out the
details of the case study
projects are in appendix
C of this
report.
So DF generally followed
best practices um
as per capita
outlay, as I
mentioned, they set
up an application um
pro application
and award
process.
They um had three
categories of awards
and there were three tiers of
funding levels just
to note that projects were
vetted using standardized
criteria. And also
um they were awarded
based on how they rate, how
they rated on that
total point
count.
And I wanted to
um also direct you
to uh Appendix A which
has a list of all the projects
that were funded and the award
amounts for those projects.
And Appendix B uh
shows the scoring
criteria, the scoring
rubric that D fa developed and
used for these projects.
So turning to
page
six,
chart
six,
I mean chart two, sorry
chart chart two shows
the distribution by size
of these projects
and on the opposite
page
um
table one, table two
shows the distribution
of the geographic distribution
of these awards.
So D
FA
was not able to fully
fund uh
projects
which is the best practice
for capital outlay, but they
were able to uh
fund about
72%
of the projects that did
receive awards.
So that means that the
legislature's um
$85 million
appropriations supported
$276
million of total projects
costs.
Turning to page
eight,
uh we're gonna look at how the
local government
implemented these
projects.
So completed
um
recre uh completed,
completed recreational
quality. This is like a
mouthful.
The RRCQOL
projects uh shared
common characteristics that
supported their success,
shovel readiness
cost sharing and local
capacity to manage and
exec execute
projects.
So, uh
the following case
studies uh
show
uh how,
how projects, how
early completes exemplify
these um
these characteristics. So
case study, the first one
is the city of Deming
in Curry County who
both had significant uh
projects that they were able
to complete fairly quickly
once they received their awards
in 2022
the result was as shown in
figure two, the city of Deming
opened their a
inflatable water park
last summer
and figure three shows, Curry
County's event center
and Livestock pavilion
which is um
scheduled to open early this
summer for the county
fair.
Cost sharing and fully
funding phases are best
practices for capital outlay
to ensure project
completion.
Although D fa did not
require cost sharing,
they did actually give points
for cost sharing and
many of the projects
that are completed, you know
that, that we mentioned
here um did
contribute a local match and
also had other sources
of funding for their
projects.
Requiring cost sharing is one
way to ensure that projects are
fully funded and
to show that there's actually
local buy buy-in for
these projects. So they're more likely
to get completed.
Turning to page
um
10
case study three, the
city of grants followed
best practices in planning
and design including
appropriately phasing its
project.
However, it relies solely
on state funding and does not
have a funding source for
future phases.
Figure, figure
four shows that
um
the design for
the city of grants,
multi-purpose arena
um and a
rodeo photo
um and this is a great
project and
with your
support, this project
is going to complete the first
phase of
um of
this event center. However,
in the long term, there, there's no
funding for this. And you, I
know you heard a lot yesterday
about the infrastructure
and capital needs
in Sa County and in
many communities. And so
again, these
projects tend to get
bumped.
And finally on page
11, some
communities may be
unable to execute
their projects without
additional technical
assistance. LF
CS fieldwork found that
many smaller local
entities
not only let capacity
to write grants and get
funding, but they also
don't have the capacity to do
the preconstruction planning
that's required for these kinds of
projects. For
example, case study four,
the village of Cuba did not
adequately budget for planning
and design and required
additional assistance for its
park expansion.
Um Cuba had to go
out and find additional resources
to do the prep planning and
permitting um
which they didn't know
they had to apply for
money for so,
but they did manage to pull it
together. And as figure
five shows um
the now the
now and the after um
of their planned park
improvements
DFA was not able to
provide
a lot of uh
technical assistance to
applicants, but the state does have
many resources that applicants
could be referred to.
And finally, as
on it says on page 12,
the legislature
appropriated
$3.5 million
in 2022 to
2023
for a new capacity
building program.
So that also is available
to applicants for these kinds
of projects.
So turning to page
13,
a more rigorous application
and award process would increase
the likelihood of future
project success.
Uh In this section,
this section considers how to
build on the lessons learned
from this um from
the early days of this project to
improve future
projects. And it really
focuses on
um higher
cost projects, the
$1 million plus
projects where we start getting
into the kinds of issues that you were
talking about earlier, about
increased construction
costs, not finding
contractors, really having
to do your um
get your shovel ready
projects. And so these
are all issues that we also talked
about with this um
committee in January
when we presented the, the
escalating cost of public
construction.
So um
one of the some of
the the best practices that
we talk about here are two
phase, funding, funding
design first and
then funding
construction. Once you know what the
actual costs and phasing
are um
ensuring that
that sufficient
amounts is budgeted
for planning and design.
Um And then having a
pre award, a better pre
award screening process that
includes a site visit
and um more review of
documents.
So table
four on page 14
shows that many projects
did actually get
planning and design funding,
which is a good thing.
Um And there's some other
issues that we mentioned here
about that, that
that process can take
longer than people think like
up to three
years
and then
to page going to page
15. Um a higher
level of pre award review and
screening is needed for large
construction process.
So again, this is really targeted
at those high cost projects.
Um Our threshold
is greater than a million
dollars, which was a large
project according to D
FA S
um tier
levels.
Um Mora County
is an example
of a
project that is stuck
still in the early design
stages. Um Their
fitness center and plaza
improvement plan
is shown in figure
six.
However, it's
uncertain at this point
whether that project will
actually be completed before the
reversion date.
And this is one of those areas
where had they
only been a had they
only gone for design
funding. It may have
helped them really focus on what
they needed to do.
So turning to page
16.
Our final
uh
case study is for Bernia
Counties, Mesa del Sol
Sports Complex,
which is south
um south
of the Sunport up on the
Mesa. And it's a huge project.
It's going to last for years,
um carefully phased, but
it exemplifies all the
best practices that we talk
about in this report.
So, um the
county
had a local match,
they have
dedicated bond money
that's going into this project.
They have um other
sources of funding.
And this is an example
where this project
um could this is an
example of how
the legislature and
this program could
help more ambitious
projects in larger communities
by just helping with phasing
and gap funding when they need
it. So uh
figure seven
shows
the um conceptual site
plan for that, that
project.
So should the legislature
to um decide to
continue funding this project?
Uh Our recommendations
um At the end of this chapter really
center around center around
having a more rigorous
pre award uh
process particularly
for the large
projects.
So turning to page
18, uh the
legislature and D fa
should consider options to
continue and improve this
program. Um
This is a great program,
these projects would not have
gotten funded otherwise
and having a dedicated
funding source, as
we know um
helps these
projects. It
takes these projects out of competition
for these other huge
projects that they otherwise would
compete with. There are
areas for improvement
um which we talk about
in the report. And I briefly
touched on and
just in addition to
those things, uh the state
would benefit from a current
inventory of recreational
assets and
ongoing assessment of their
condition and project
outcomes. There is
no uh
state agency that
tracks recreational
assets. And so we
don't really know what's out
there and what their condition is.
Um DFA
could require
its uh
it's uh grantees in
future to track some
outcomes. In page
19 list, some
common uh
metrics that could be
used to in terms, you know, just
basic stuff like even
visitation and frequency
of visits. We don't know that
those numbers.
And then a final
policy
uh note that came
up is
that
that uh community use
of public school facilities
is considered the best practice
for leveraging resources,
particularly in rural
areas, but also to
promote health.
And, and
um
we went to, we
visited it in our site
visits. Um We saw
the village of Cuba Park
and we saw the Milan Park,
both of which are
either
across the street
or you know, nearby
to public school
facilities that have
playgrounds and have ball
fields. But those
uh facilities are
fenced in and not available
to the community.
Uh Public school Facilities
Authority Adequacy
Standards do not
include community use of
schools at this point, but they
could. Um
And the
PS fa uh
PP, the
committee that
um
the capital outlay committee for
public schools does not
allow funding
for a for
community use at this
point. And again, they,
that, that could change as
well. We conclude
here with um
an example of the Los
Alamos public schools with
which recently partnered
with the county
in replacing their two
elementary schools to
build a bigger gym so they
could have these events.
Um And then also
they um had another
area for community use at the
second school.
So finally, um our
recommendation,
our recommendations
focus on how
D fa could improve
this program going
forward.
Um And
also, um
as we said, as I said earlier,
the legislature should
cons um consider
continuing this program to
establish a fund
and um
start funding
it.
And
given that it's better than
capital outlay
um normal capital outlay
processes because
it's a vetted process, it's
transparent.
Um There's an attempt to
really uh follow
best practices
which means that these projects
are more likely to go forward
than normal projects.
So final, I just
wanted to again say that. So
Appendix A lists all
the projects. Appendix B
shows the scoring criteria
and C gives some detailed
project profiles
of our case studies.
And with that, I'm
happy to answer questions,
>> Wesley. You want to come up,
I'm not gonna let you drive all this
way. >> Do you want to come to
Kelly >> and while you're
coming up, did you get that pay
raise?
I, I know he's listening.
So I'm, I'm gonna be keep
harping on that
>> did you get a pay
raise,
>> Mr Chair? I
have not heard of one.
So, so not yet.
>> I think I'll make a call
today.
Let me ask you something, Wesley, was
this your brainchild and how
we scored this and did
this
>> Mr Chair.
Um I was
involved with some of the
scoring um with the
2022 funding. I was
not at local government division at that
time. Um I was just at the Capitol
Bureau Chief. Um but I did
work with local government division
and the bureau Chiefs there
to try to develop the
best way
of scoring these projects and trying
to get the projects into the
communities um into
all of the rural communities. That was the
goal um from both,
both sources of funding. And so,
yes, I, I was involved with
some of that. >> I mean,
this the way this worked out if you
look at the the one or
two year projects, right?
And, and everything, everything's
moving, right,
>> Mr Chairman. Yes, it, it seems
like most of them are are moving and
um we are going to have a meeting with
all of the grant
um um
entities next month
in early June to
make sure that they are moving and
to try to figure out what
some of the hold ups are. If there are any hold
ups, >> do they have timelines
and dates where they expire for the
grant? >> Uh Mr
Chair, yes. Um the
2023 funds expired
um are going to expire.
We're going to expire this fiscal
year and then the 2022
we through 2025
but we did get that
fixed in the last session.
So, um we haven't sent out
those amendments yet. We are working on that.
We're getting those out with
all the other um extensions
that we have to do and hopefully
have them all done by the end of this fiscal
year. >> But the, but
the 2023 we did not
extend correct. >> We did
Mr Chair. We, we extended all of
it to um to
basically December 31st
2026 or June
30th
2027.
>> I mean,
let's just change capital to this
program because the scoring seems
to be pushing that way.
I mean, if you look at the
2022 and
2023 projects,
some of them are 100%
complete
>> Mr Chairman. Yes, some
of them um did do a good job
of, of getting the fund spent
and, and they were right on top of it, I
think part of it too was
they weren't sure if they were
going to get extensions and so
they knew they had to move on them
quickly. >> Yeah, I mean,
some of these projects are pretty unique
like that. Demming
Water Park is, that's
very interesting to me. I
mean, we probably
have to call it ice skating over here,
but I don't think
the water would ever warm up that enough
to really
enjoy it. But I mean, these
are the, the way these projects and the way
the structure is is pretty
impressive to me
how quickly they're
moving
and how,
how they're getting done and the scoring
and everything, it intrigues
me over capital
outlay
to do that. And I know you
new infrastructure,
what's the new tile remind
me, >> Mr
Chairman. Um It's the infrastructure
planning and development division
>> with higher
pay,
>> Mr Chairman. We'll
see,
>> I mean, are you, I mean, looking
at this, I mean, and there's
no question but in looking at
this in the way this grant deal
worked out is
probably
a real strong talking
point for capital outlay
fixes
>> Mr chairman. I agree. I think
um you know, getting a
pot of money and doing
application based process
and developing some
sort of scoring criteria and
policy um
does help um to
help us get the information, we need
to make sure that we're funding the
right projects.
>> Thank you very much, Mr Chairman,
members of the committee
just, just quickly, I want to go
ahead and commend the course of LFC
staff for the
analytics. And then
secondly, uh Wesley,
if you would just help me
a little bit here to understand
as we deal with the
Mora project, the 2.5
million, and I know that's going to be
important with
that in combination with some
of the capital out to
complete the courthouse.
Can, can you elaborate a little
bit in terms of the
work that you're putting into
something like this to ensure that
the, the resources
are, are spent appropriately
quickly and
that the project is complete.
Because I think that's,
that's what the, the chairman is
getting to. How are we
getting these projects
moving, how are we getting
them funded
and then how do we complete them
and then of course, maintain them as we
go along. So, if you would please, just
in brevity, please, thank you,
>> Mr Chairman, Senator
Campos. Um In, in regards
to um the Moor County project,
I think um we are working
closely with the contractors
there. Um I mean with the architects
there to, to make sure
that we develop a plan
um for them to move forward.
Um Border County is a little
bit more complex and that there's
multiple projects going on in the
same area. And so we
are working with them to make sure that we
can not only um expend
the funding but make
sure that, you know, it's all
the work is being done in coordination
with other projects going on in that
region. >> Uh Mr
Chairman again, thank you very
much for the ongoing
efforts. That
is an example of how we can
move projects forward
by working directly with
the the local entities. Thank you very
much, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you. So
let me go back to one question
under this program, Wesley, what do you
think d fa capacity
is to handle this? Is it
50 million? Is
it
>> Mr Chairman I think um
with the additional resources
we received um this last
legislative session, I think
um our capacity is better.
Um I think it's still difficult, there's
a lot of capital projects out
there as you know, and
um you know, it, it does take
time to do these types of programs,
um you know, to run the application
to score, um to
review all the scoring and
to select the projects
um is, is a little
bit time consuming, it takes a
couple of months, um a few months of
times um holding webinars
training that sort of thing.
Um Once the projects are
funded, um you know, it's
just like, you know,
administering a typical capital
project after that. >> But
what is your capacity? I mean,
this last year, what was it,
50 million that we put in
or, or prior
>> Mr Chairman for the rec grant?
Um I think it was 45
million the first year and then 40 million
the second year, we didn't receive any
funds this last
session. >> And
so, but it is 40
million like the, the
ideal spot where you think
you can handle that or is it
100 and 50 million
Mr >> Chairman? Um I
think whatever funding you
give us we will administer. Um
But to answer your question,
I think the ideal spot probably
is close to what we in the past
between 4050. Um
We could probably handle easi easier
than um 100 and 50.
We do have the matching grant that we are
also trying to administer.
So there's lots of other things that
we're, that, that we're working on.
Um, but I think we could probably,
you know, do 40 to
50 million pretty well.
>> Ok. That, that's kind of what we want to hear
because, I mean, we can
drown you in money
and then never get anything done
or we can find a spot where you
can make things flow like in
this report,
that really makes a difference, right.
So they're getting stuff done. So, I
mean, we'll look at
that number right, around
$50 million to do
that. There's no money
this year. So the applications have
probably dropped off. Right. But
what, what amount of
applications did you have
that couldn't, didn't
qualify or didn't
receive money? >> Mr
Chairman. Um It was about,
um, I think it was 25%
or so we could not get
funded. Most of those were
due to um
Noncompliance's
order with auto compliance.
Um There were very few that
were really denied based off their
type of project they had.
Um I think, you know,
when we look at the IC IP
S, um I think we do have
a means of trying to see what is out
there with the IC IP S if,
if we can identify Park and
rec type projects, which we
can, we have that category, we
can see exactly what the needs
are in the state so we can
provide that information for you,
especially after this IC
IP. Um go around
here, you know, by September October
time frame. >> And then
let me ask you this like in grants,
which is yesterday,
we talked about outdoor
reck across the board, right?
And, and putting the road,
it kind of just made sense to me. Putting
a road to the top of Mount Taylor
is like driving to the top of
Pike's peak, right?
Is there? So it is
available for infrastructure like
that. Apparently it is
because the rodeo grams and grants
got awarded that way,
>> Mr Chairman. Um I think
we, we can if we could keep it as
broad as we want or, or
keep it um as,
as um
you know, related
to specific park projects if we
want it, it, you know, it depends on the,
on the language of the, of the
appropriation. >> What do
you recommend
>> Mr Chairman? Um I
recommend trying
to keep it a little bit
um more detailed with
a better scope um than, than
utilizing it for road projects.
Um I just think that
if we get to too
many projects outside
of the intent, then,
you know, we're gonna be looking to
try to fund those types of projects.
And I think if we keep it more to
outdoor recreation,
um you know, actual
facilities that the, that
the citizens can use, I think that's probably
better
>> and, and I want you to think
about this along with your pay
increase. I
is,
do you think this structure would
fit for
capital?
Think about it. You don't have to give me an
answer if it's a longer question.
I mean, I don't want you saying,
yeah, we could get it done or we could do it.
But I mean, as we move
along to $6
billion in capital,
right,
>> Mr Chairman, I
honestly do, I think that it it could,
the structure would work well with
capital.
>> Could you mock up some scenarios
for us as we move
forward? I know
that we can look at this and maybe
pick something that's coming in
or, or, or
projects that are, you could probably
look at my list and, and
take a few for example,
right? And,
and the president of you and, and m
sitting right behind you, maybe we'll pick her
project and, and
some other ones, but I
I'll advise you please don't
pick the Navajo nation ones
because that that's a whole
different creature to try
to, to Amini
and to do that. But maybe
you know the city of gallops
projects, grants
projects, right?
And do some some scoring
and how those would score in the
system in the capital
process to
do that
and that we may
start capital one or two.
I'm just thinking quickly
if we did a capital
project two years in
advance saying we
want your two years out here so we
can score it to see if it qualifies
and if it doesn't qualify,
then you're not eligible this
year, maybe next year you come back
and you can score that way,
>> Mr Chairman, I could definitely do that. I
think, I also think that that's
kind of just a piece of it. Um I
think, you know, we're talking
about state funds right here, but
we could also look into federal
funds for some of these projects
as well. Um Maybe not these
particular projects but other
projects that are on, you know,
entity IC IP S
so um yes, I think, you
know, we can definitely use that kind of a
system but we should also look
at other, you know, sources available
as well to make sure that we can
get multiple projects funded.
I >> mean, however, you guys want to
minister it because you, you, you
guys are the ministers,
right? The problem is, is,
is we fund projects and,
and we don't know
anything because we think we know, but
we really don't know
because they bring us a sheet of paper and they
have the documents and
you read through them and they say, oh yeah, they
qualify and then you find
out later all the
they're in violation of the executive
order on there
on there
uh reports or something they're
missing in. So
do a mockup for, for
capital and then I don't know where we're
gonna squeeze that in this summer,
Charles, but we should, we should
probably do a mockup just to see
how that's gonna
work
and see how, how that would
work in scoring. So then we know that
money would be moving and be
scored in, in
and how it would go.
So I don't
see any other questions. So,
thank you. Enjoy your
time.
Enjoy that pay
increase,
Senator Shear. I
did see the pickleball court in
Kirtland. I imagine you have your
own pickleball
set.
I don't even know how you play
with.
Let's see,
Secretary Ayo
and
Eric Eric, you're gonna start
us off.
Now, this is a legis that hearing.
So this is one of those agencies
we're going to be scoring in legis
that through the summer because
of the transfer with the health
care authority and everything that's going
on.
Her budget is actually big
gonna be bigger than the state's
budget.
Hello,
Gina.
>> All right, Mr Chair members of the committee.
My name is Eric Chenier. I'm
the LFC analyst
for uh
the health care authority will
be the health care authority coming up
on uh July
1st,
first of all, before we
get into it, I wanted to go over the
legis that overview, just kind
of what these hearings are all
about.
Um I know it's been
probably at least since last
interim, since we've had a, a
legis stat. And so I just
wanted to kind of remind the committee
um kind
of the way this these
these hearings go.
So
legat was launched
in 2021 builds on
existing efforts in New Mexico around
evidence-based
budgeting.
Its main goal is to strengthen
collaboration with state
agencies in monitoring
the implementation of state
programs and improving state
budget decisions.
Uh legis that involves
ongoing regular meetings
between the legislature and
departments.
Participants review key
measures and diagnose
performance deficits
and then decide how to fix those
problems.
Um So we try
to make these hearings uh be
focused, right? Uh
Meetings focus on most
important performance
metrics. Um
You'll see that in, in the
my presentation coming
up, uh They're meant to
be more committee driven.
Um So they're, they're
short uh presentations
from myself and from the,
the uh agency
and they're more meant to get uh
the committee more engaged
and more um
asking questions.
Um They're also meant
to be deeper dives
um action
oriented
um agents. We're,
we're hoping agencies can commit to
specific actions by the
next meeting, representing
important near term
progress.
Um Even if the
challenge is being addressed or
longer term,
uh they're meant to be
collaborative.
Um
We're hoping to foster
collaboration between the
committee and the
departments
and then we also want them to be
impactful, right? We want to be able
to come back um in a year
or two and say,
you know, legis that helped us
kind of bring
around whatever change is
coming up. So
with that Mr Chair, I'll go
ahead and I'll move into
uh my actual presentation
it should be in behind tab
I uh in
your books there. It looks kind of like
this just without my,
my handwrit notes
there.
And so why, why
did we want to do this one? This is
going to be uh the first
one for
uh HSD specifically
HC A health
care Authority, specifically
focusing on both um
physical health and behavioral
health access.
Um We wanted
to do this because
one of the big reasons is we've,
we've made big
investments, you've made big
investments into this
department.
Um
Either from 2023
and 2024.
We've got about
2.5 $2
billion that have gone into this
department. Um
both state funds and
general funds.
And so
most of that money,
not all, but most of that
money um is
going towards, you know, different
types of rate increases.
And that money is kind of meant
to help
improve access and help
improve
um
uh people's ability to get
good quality
health care or
evidence-based
behavioral health
services.
And why do we want people to have
that access?
Ultimately, it's to improve
the health care of
New Mexicans, right?
And so if we look at
um under tab I
here, the
um
the first little bit of data
that I have there
just, and I just provided
some of these rankings.
Um
we don't rank great on
some of the behavioral health rankings,
you know, 36 for overall
mental health prevalence,
which actually we have improved
a little bit um over the last
couple of years, but it's, it's still
up there.
Um youth
with major depressive episodes,
youth substance use disorder were
pretty high ranking on
our on that.
Right. Um
And then in the physical health
side, a lot of
these measures that kind
of affect um
women and Children. So, maternal
mortality, low
birth weight, um
we rank pretty uh
pretty high on these, on
these, on these measures
compared to other
other states.
Um And the one thing I wanted to kind
of me uh mention is
that we don't
actually have a lot of
great measures
of how
well um
people are able to
access
services
other than I feel like
one of the best measures is folks
come to you guys,
you guys kind of bring it up to us
in hearings or over
the phone and we know
about it because of that. But
honestly, as far
as like statewide, um
there's, there's not a lot of great,
great measures out there. And
so you'll see
some of these measures that I'm talking
about later on in this presentation
are kind of beating around
the bushes of access,
but they're not necessarily
um
hitting it head on, right.
And so hopefully, that's
one outcome of this legis
that is that maybe we can start
working towards
um developing better
measures of
access.
So one of those measures
utilization uh without
better access measures,
utilization can be
used to approximate whether Medicaid
members are
accessing the services the state
is paying for.
However, utilization
metrics. Um
the service that
um
however, because the utilization
metrics, the health care authority
tracks or units
of service, the state does not
know if more or fewer clients
are receiving care.
It could just be that there's a high
um a group
of high utilizes out there
that are using all those
services and we don't
know if it's widespread
or not, you know. So it's
utilization isn't a great
measure either. But
what I will say if we go on
to page
two,
One of the first measures there,
mothers with newborns
receiving prenatal care,
prenatal care within
42 days of enrollment
with an MC O.
So this is actually improved
a little bit since the
um pandemic, we
used to hit these measures
um pretty well
prior to the pandemic.
Um
But uh in
2022
80% of newborn mothers
received prenatal care in the first
trimester,
which was slightly lower
than the target of
83%. And below
the national average of
84%
because New Mexico has such a
high rate of births funded
by Medicaid,
about 76%.
In 2022.
The Medicaid program has an
outsized impact on
population birth
outcomes.
Uh The
next measure I'll talk about is
one or more annual wellcare
visits, ages 3 to
21.
This is another one that kind of beats around
the bush, right? Like if,
if they're not getting their visits,
it's probably because they don't have
access, but we're
not 100% sure about
that. Um Over the past couple
of years, less than half of
Children enrolled in Medicaid
received annual well child
checkups as
recommended by the American
Academy of
Pediatrics. Uh
but prenatal care
Proust appears to
have improved.
Another one here. Emergency
department use for routine
care. If folks
don't have primary care
physicians, other
outlets to get their care,
they're gonna go to the emergency room.
Uh most likely.
And so that a lot of, you know, and
that um ends up
being an expensive way
to care for people.
Um
And, and so this
is, this is more of a
symptom of
not having access,
right?
Um
The last measure I'll talk about
receive community-based
services seven days after
psychiatric
hospitalization.
Uh due to New Mexico's high
rates of behavioral health
prevalence, the
state need needs
improved. Um follow
up care after an emergency
department visit
for behavioral health reas reasons
especially for
Children.
Um
And then one other thing I, I do
kind of want to mention to you
is there are
some state rankings out
there, you know, as, as I
was kind of preparing for this,
um I saw, you know, like
11 of them out there and it's not
perfect
is we actually rank
11th, which is pretty
good up in that, you know,
pretty good for
access to behavioral health
services.
But again, if you look at that first
page, our outcomes aren't
so great. And
so either there's an issue with
that measure the way that they're
ranking us,
um or
there's some something else
that's kind of a disconnect there.
And so I think um one
thing to kind of think about for
us also
is
what are the, what are
the types of services that people are
able to access?
And that's one thing
I kind of just want to leave you with
is, is it
evidence-based
behavioral health
services?
And if it's on the physi physical
health side, are
people able to access
good quality
services? And
that's, that's kind of the,
that's kind of the main
um kind of point
here and then just,
just to kind of point you in the right
direction. I'm gonna stop
talking here on page starting
here on page three at the
bottom. We give you
guys some um suggested
questions that you can
uh ask throughout this
hearing of,
of us.
Um
And that's
it. I'll pass it over to the secretary
for further
comment.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr,
chair members of the committee.
Good morning. Thank
you, Mr Chenier
for your thoughtful analysis.
Um And actually, uh
we at the health
care authority look forward to collaboration
with you on this important issue
around access to care
um as a New Mexican
myself, uh I'm a
lifelong New Mexican.
Uh I have two Children
here and I am a user of the
healthcare system. So
I think I can just acknowledge
right off the bat that uh the
health care system is not
as robust as we need it
to be. And that's my job is to
sort of think through ways
of making the system more
robust. But I too
have had to take my Children to the
urgent care because I couldn't get them in to
see the pediatrician. I know
this problem is real and I'm not
gonna pretend to like
it's perfect. We are, we
are making some progress and much
of that is due in
large part to the long
term investments made
by the legislature here in New
Mexico to support the health care
system. So I just wanted
to say that off the bat, I do
really appreciate the opportunity
to collaborate with the LFC
uh on these issues. I
think that they're incredibly
important and we look forward
to sort of thinking through
uh how we can do a
better job of measuring that access
to care. And we are doing some things,
but we love to hear your feedback on
how we can do better.
Um You do have a little slide
presentation, but in the interest of
keeping it brief, I'm gonna skip
over a
slide
that's labeled three, but it's really
number two, I think.
Um and go straight
to what's labeled as slide
four in my presentation about
rebuilding behavioral health in New
Mexico. I do want to
call out um
that we have
seen a 104%
growth in the Medicaid
psychiatric providers
and a 73% increase
in core professionals. That's huge.
Uh growth actually
exponential growth in the behavioral
health system um
since 2019.
So from 2019 to 2023
you can see in the um
graph on the right what
that growth looks like in both urban
and rural New Mexico. But we've
seen um
more than double more
than 100% growth in the number
of providers actually
accessible in the system.
We've had 2.2
million behavioral health visits
for Medicaid members in
2022. That
was a 68% increase
since 2018. So I
do agree that behavioral
health, we have access
issues. I think the problems are very
real, but we are making progress.
And again, thank you in large
part to the investments made by this
committee. Um We
are in the process, we, we
did some increases to the
behavioral health system in
this fiscal year. Uh
raising behavioral health
uh codes, the
reimbursement rate up to 100 and
20% of Medicare.
We're getting ready to raise those
again, up to 100 and
50% of Medicare in
2025. Uh
So the budget supports that,
I think that's going to be a huge influx
and we really attract providers
to New Mexico.
We have to
Mr Cheer's Point
added five additional
evidence-based practices
to our Medicaid benefit
package. Those are really
designed to be community-based
services that are targeting,
for example, um
youth and adolescents
who are struggling with
mental health conditions. We know we've seen a
surge in those coming out of the
pandemic. So really trying
to focus the network of
care and the services
that the population needs to make
sure that those are available to New Mexicans.
We're also providing
training free of charge to
providers uh to
make sure that they know how to deliver
those services.
Um We are in the process of
building out certified community
behavioral health clinics.
Those will be introduced in
January of 25
6 are provisionally certified
already. So getting ready
with that roll out,
um we are working
through uh Medicaid funded
Cara care coordinators. So
that's the program that
links substance
uh new moms who
are struggling with potential substance
abuse to services
as quickly as possible. We're doing
boots on the ground in hospitals
to link them to care coordinations. We
actually have people in hospitals
trying to connect with moms
um while they're in the
hospital to see if we can
connect them to services before
they leave. Um
We are pursuing
Medicaid federal approval
and hopefully we'll be receiving
federal approval very soon to
offer Medicaid services
30 days prior to release
in correctional settings. This
is one of our waiver initiatives.
It's been under negotiation with the federal
government for about a year and a
half, a little bit longer.
We are anticipating that we're at the end
of the line there and hopefully
expecting that approval very
soon.
And we are participating in a national
initiative to align housing
programs for New Mexicans with
be complex behavioral health
needs. And I want to apologize.
I mean, rues here, I should have
introduced uh Nick BUCA,
our Behavioral health Services division
director who is here also
to answer questions and has been
leading much of the work
that we're talking about
today. Um
On slide five, I just
wanted to call out that about
26% of
New Mexicans on Medicaid are
receiving behavioral health services.
So a little more than a quarter,
that number has
been steady since
2020 but we
have actually seen quite a bit of
enrollment growth. So
I think we're serving more New Mexicans
on Medicaid uh
through for
Behavioral health services. And we've
seen um that
kind of hold study roughly
a quarter.
Um
Sorry, there's, there's
a labeling issue on the slides.
I really apologize. I think I have
a different deck than you all. So
it says slide four on
your thank, thank
you. Um
There are some additional
things that we're doing in our new
turquoise care program that will
launch on July 1st.
I'll talk a little bit more about that
this afternoon. Uh, but
wanted to call out again
um that we are
um we
have new contract requirements
for timeliness
and access to providers
including appointment standards
that will be going live in July. I'll
talk more about that today this
afternoon. Um And then
we've also added um
responsibilities for our
MC O partners
in the roll-out of mobile
crisis teams and
mobile response and stabilization
that is for both Children and
adults. So, uh you
know, we all are concerned
about families experiencing
crisis, Children in state
custody. Um Those
services will be there to
support um and wrap
around those families who are
experiencing those crises.
And so we're really focused on building
that out um
in terms of appointment standards,
those that will go into effect
uh in July.
Uh we do have new
appointment standards around non
urgent behavioral health
care uh
for an appointment time to be no
less than seven days
for
um
sorry, uh Behavioral
health follow-up care within
30 days and for behavioral
health crisis uh
within 90 minutes
of the
request.
Moving quickly on to
slide five.
We wanted to also talk
about Medicaid primary care
reform. We are doing
a lot of work to also build out
not just the behavioral health system of
care but also the primary
care network here in New
Mexico, we are
on track to have doubled
the number of accredited
uh primary care and
psychiatry residency
programs. By 2025
we will have doubled that. That's a huge
accomplishment for the State of New Mexico.
Again, thank you to your
investments, residents
and training will increase from 100
and 42 to
264. That's an
886%
increase in 2025
74%. Uh
data show would stay
in New Mexico to practice uh
if they graduate from our institutions
here. Um And we
are working really hard to bridge
gaps in services,
really focusing on care,
coordination and navigation.
Again, I'll talk a little bit more
about that today, but
we are in the process of going
live with our closed loop
referral system which will really
try to connect the dots for
our New Mexican patients who
are trying to access care but need
other supports as well like
food and housing.
So really making sure that those warm
handoffs are occurring to connect people
to the right network that needs
to serve them. Um
And then I wanted to just call
out that we are working really
closely with our MC
OS to implement a single
credentialing system
that will be really helpful for
our provider network. I know many of you
have actually asked me about that.
So that will be rolling out soon.
I will get you all time frames on
that. But it is going
to be a huge incentive
for providers in terms of that
reduction in administrative
workload. Um And then
we will be also launching
a new provider enrollment system
that's much more user friendly
that will be going live in the
fall. October, September,
October time frame,
um where providers
today they call and
they have no idea what they're
missing for their enrollment
uh to sign up to provide
services with, with the state.
It will provide a user map kind
of like your Domino's app that shows
you exactly where you are in the system
and exactly what you're missing. So I think
our providers are going to have a much better,
um, time serving
our Medicaid patients here in New
Mexico.
Lastly, on slide six,
I did want to just call out uh
the work we've done to stand
up the rural health care delivery
fund as a reminder
that started out with 80 million
in the pot that about
79.5
million has been distributed
out to New Mexico or is
obligated to New Mexico
providers. We are
supporting 54 organizations
across 28 rural
counties which will equate
to 212 total
service types available statewide
that are not available today.
Um Each organization is
expanding or creating new
services. Those are
really focused on behavioral health,
primary care, maternal
and child health, dental,
hospital, surgical, and
optometry services.
Um We do anticipate
that through that fund, we will
be able to facilitate access to
over 400,000 new
health care services for New
Mexicans by
fiscal year 26.
Um and
14,750
services have been invited to New
Mexicans since November of
2023. When those funds
started to be distributed,
three providers are already
profitable. So good
news, I think a lot of providers
out there were just really hungry
for an investment in the start up
funds, they know what to do.
Uh They had really excellent
proposals. We're taking a
look at all the ones that didn't get funded
to see how we can try to support
them with what
remains in the funding
that was allocated
to the agency for fiscal year
25. Um
And we are really
excited about that program and we
are really tracking
um what services are provided,
what new staff have been hired and
what revenue is generated through that
program. And with that
Mr chair members of the committee, I'll
rest for questions.
>> Thank you. Uh real quick
before we go to questions on,
on Eric on page
one, your,
your chart on the utilization.
Could you explain that
to me? I'm a little bit
mix and how many
services and how many times.
And
>> yeah, Mr chair
and members of the committee.
So for example,
on the physical health practitioner
visits per 1000
members
in 2022
that was about
6741
per 1000
members.
So
uh
you know about what is it about
6.7 and
10
members received
a physical health visit
essentially, right? And
so that uh
decrease from
2019 from uh
7692
per 1000
visits.
Um And
so one of the, one of the
points I was making earlier
is that that
uh measure
doesn't completely
tell the entire story because
it's just
visits,
it's not individual
members, right? And so you
can't tell if you know, an
individual member went to
that doctor say
seven times, right? So
there might be high
utilizes
um in, in that data
set, we don't know. And so that's
kind of the point I was making on
that data. >> So we're
not really getting the expansion
because we don't have the numbers to
say if there were repeat or if there
are new individuals in the system,
right?
Senator
Woods.
>> Beautiful.
Thank you, Mr
Chair.
I spend
about
a half a day every
year
with the mental
health resources there
in Clovis.
Uh trying to
listen to them, trying
to
hear what
they say.
And from what I remember
Mr Chair a lot
of those referrals
was court
ordered.
And so I guess the
question I have
is
how many
have we got any
statistics to know
how many people
just walk in and
say, man, I, I need
some help uh
compared to how
many are court
ordered
that uh we
are,
you know, either you
come in or
not or, or I
don't know how to explain that. But
have you got any statistics
on
that?
>> Um, Mr Chair, Senator
Woods, I don't have statistics
with me today, but I can go back
and see what we can poll.
Um, so that's
a really good question. I
will, I, I don't
have the answer for you today,
but I will go back and see what
we can pull for you on
that.
>> And, and that's what I'm,
you know, that kind of
brings it down to me
is,
uh,
much of the, the
crime problem
is described to
me as
a behavioral health
issue
and,
and I don't know how to form the
question,
but
we talk about, you
know,
uh, a few minutes ago, we talked
about what was this one person
going back for many visits
or was this one
many people going for
one visit?
And I
know there's
a
many times the court
orders
a continuing
visit, uh,
you know, you show up
once a week
in order to
stay out of jail
or, or, you know, along with
your probation or,
or whatever.
Uh, but the, the,
I guess the question,
can we tell what kind
of success
rate we're having
with these, with
this investment? We're,
we're, we're,
uh,
we're putting money into it
now. We're
getting,
we're getting people
to go,
uh, even though it may not be
under their own
will, we're getting
them to
go.
Are we being
successful
at these endeav, is there a
major,
we can tell,
I guess, is the
question.
>> Yeah, Senator Woods, um,
Mr Chairman, you know,
I think that's kind
of the point of this hearing, right? Is
we don't have a
great understanding. I mean, we
can see the outcomes,
we're not doing that great.
Um, as far as the
outcomes go, those
measures on page one at the
top.
Um,
and I think part
of
what we need to understand
a little bit better
is are the services
that we are providing
evidence-based.
Um, we don't, we don't really
know. Right. We don't have a great
inventory of those services. We
don't have a great,
um,
understanding of
how effective they actually
are. Um,
and if we don't know that, then we
don't know
essentially, um,
whether or not those services are
working towards improving those
like higher level kinds of
outcomes on page one
there.
>> Yeah. And thank you,
Mr Chair, Senator Woods. I
think it is a,
that is a complicated,
it's a complicated question with a
complicated answer. I don't,
I don't necessarily think for
example, the
goal of the services is to
cure all mental illness.
I think that is not
realistic and I think that
people with
mental illness
live with it for much
of their lives. So
prevalence of mental illness
alone may not really
tell you how
well the system is doing. It's
really are they able to manage that?
Are they getting access to the
services they need? Do
they have um you know, a
stable, other
stable supports in their
lives to kind of
ensure that they are able to
function? Um So
I think the system really requires
investments in
sort of the community-based
care, the crisis
system that will be there
to help people when they have
a crisis. We've rolled out
the 988 system. But for
example, those mobile
crisis services are really
essential to making sure that we
can show up for
people and provide the wraparound
services that they need.
And then again, you know, as
people exit the
correctional system, we
are going to be connecting them
with services so that when
they leave, they've got
a stable plan. Um
and they are able to, and hopefully
that will reduce both
recidivism and create
a more stable
um you know, approach
for, for that population. But
again, I don't think, I
guess through the lens that I'm looking
at and you
know, I call on
director Buus
to lend anything else,
but I, I don't necessarily think
that the goal is to,
for example,
cure all mental
illness. But I think
that it's really to create that
stability and Mr Mr
Chair with your permission if
um Director
BUCA may speak.
Thank you.
>> Um Good morning
Mr Chair, Senator Woods. My
name is Nick Buus, I'm the director
of the Behavioral Health Services
Division. Um
We do
coordinate with the administrative
officers of the courts
to see what has been issued.
Um It is a little difficult for us
to kind of mesh
and make a one
size fits all bucket into
that, but we can get you data
on that. And I'm happy
to follow up on that to
the secretary's point. I think
one of the things when we're looking at
behavioral health
and I just want to reiterate
is that, um,
you know, behavioral
health is not orthopedics,
it's not, here's an ace
bandage, some Motrin, stay
off of it for four weeks.
And, um,
we're never going to see you again.
There may be multiple visits
similar to someone who has
diabetes or
cardiac problems. And I
think one of the things that we're very
happy, um,
as far as success goes
is when we look at the 988
system, um,
over 90% of those
folks are
resolved on the
phone and we,
while we don't have the data to
say that they
did not end up
100% in the emergency
department. But many of the times
folks that, um,
potentially are calling
988 would have
ended up there and we're trying to
lessen those resources as
well as lessen the impact
on law enforcement,
fire and ems.
And I think as we're looking at the
system and as we're building this
out, one of our
goals is to continue to build
out that crisis continuum of
care because 988
mobile crisis teams and
CCBHC really
all go hand in hand
to enhance the community
resources that the secretary
mentioned before
and it's
incumbent on us to
try and strengthen that
and figure out where it is.
And I can tell you that
many behavioral health
providers um
including mental health resources
who I met with last month in
Clovis. It's a wonderful
facility
um
applied for that rural health
care grant to
build up that infrastructure to
look at. How can we
expand into
doing things like mobile crisis
teams, how can we
better serve and bring
folks on? And one of the things that we
want to focus on
is how do we expand workforce
to improve that capacity
because that's going to be a key component
as we're doing this.
So, um
my long answer to your short
question, sir is that
it's a number of
parts that we're going to try and put into this
plan to strengthen
that especially in our rural
communities where some
folks might have to travel over an
hour, which may not
be the the
best use of their
time or effort or
trying to get them to those
resources? Thank
you.
>> And, and with that, I, I
used the probably the
wrong word when I said
cure because
I know it's a mortal,
mortal, mortal.
I guess a
quick question would
be.
Does
Medicaid
pay?
How long, how many
visits do they
pay for? I mean,
is it a, a continual
deal as
long as they need the
help they will
keep paying?
>> Uh Mr Chair, Senator
Woods. That's correct. There's no visit
limit, no hard visit
limit on Medicaid.
Um
It's based on the medical necessity
of the patient and whether they
still need that
care. Yeah.
And there are also, I would just
say no cost sharing requirements.
So should be no
barrier from,
you know, in, in that way,
in terms of access, no
cost
barrier.
>> I also spend a lot of
time talking to
uh one of my friends
in Tucumcari,
the mayor
Moya
and uh talked
to him quite a bit about
his, his circuit
writer
approach to this,
going from town to
town
uh
trying to help
in the rural areas.
Uh uh
and again,
very complicated
but
Clovis and, and
there's a, a five county
deal consortium
over there trying to
put in a
regional
uh
facility
uh with uh more
under a hospital
type setting.
And of course,
they're way
underfunded
and they haven't
got that together
yet. And one of
the big problems seems
to be staffing.
How do we get that staff?
How can we get, can
we attract? I know
that many
times it's
video
conference
uh now
used
uh
because we don't have the
high
education
psychiatrists
to be able to come into
town. And so
they use video medicine
and uh video
conferencing. So
I, I am I'm
concerned
about building that
facility out. Don't
tell Clovis that
now
uh uh Arry
County, but I
am concerned
because
I'm worried about the
staffing.
We've got a hospital there
that has closed one wing
of the hospital
because they literally don't
have the staff that they used
to have, they don't have the
doctors, the surgical
doctors in
town that they once
had
and it, you
know
how, and
I, you know, I'm not gonna ask you
how to fix that because
uh that's an ongoing
problem too, Mr
Chair. But
this is just
one segment of
health we're talking
about and in
New Mexico
and we need lots
of, of staff to
take care of this. I
would say this is probably one of
the most underserved
areas in the
state when
we start talking about
6000 people or
so. That's,
that's crazy
that
I don't know if you all remember
back in the day, there was
actually a guy running for
president that it
came out that he was going
to a
psychiatrist
and they kicked imp plum off the
ticket, they wouldn't even talk
about it. And
one, they interviewed one lady
and she said,
ask her what she thought
about it,
presidential candidate
going to a psychiatrist.
And she said, I thought
all politicians need to
go to.
That's probably the case. Uh
with many New Mexicans
is we a
lot of us need some help
in those issues.
Uh It's,
it's hard to say
in this time of
polarization that we
have in the political
arena that
uh there's a middle ground on
anything. But
if we expect people
to become
compliant with
normal society,
there has to
be
a metal ground
normal
and it seems to me we're
getting,
that's a fuzzy line.
What's, what is
acceptable, what
is normal?
And so how do we take
someone
that has moved
across that line too far
and take him back to? Well,
this is the line you have to go
back. I
know that's what
I'm sorry. Chair.
Thank you.
Thank you for your
>> Senator Woods. Just for your
information that the Supreme
Court ruled now with pretrial
detention, they, they
can't order you into any
services.
So
if they're gonna detain and
they, they came out with that ruling,
so you're not, those people
that are not ordered in that court system
are not going to be allowed to be ordered
in that court system.
So that's gonna be very interesting
to see what's happening, especially coming
to a special session
saying that we want to change some
laws and, and put people in
treatment
and the Supreme Court
has now ruled that you can't do that.
So gonna be
interesting senators and
then we'll try to run through and
just make sure you get to your questions. I
know. >> Um, thank
you, Mr Chair. Uh,
first
with a few exceptions.
Most of y'all weren't born when
the uh presidential
election he's talking about
happened. I
was, it's embarrassing
but there you go. I remember
it, uh, on,
on page two,
uh, where it talks about emergency,
emergency department,
routine
care.
Um,
in there. I, I
think there are several things
that I, I think we ought to try to figure
out how to measure separately.
One is I'm going just because
I feel like going,
but the more important
one is I'm going because
500 doctors left the
State of New Mexico last
year.
So there's nowhere else to
go.
Um, and so I think
that that's a much larger
issue on here. But
clearly if
the, the, what do
you call yourself now, health
care
authority, uh,
can help figure out how to
keep doctors,
which again is a
multifaceted thing.
That's, that's huge.
How do we recruit doctors? How do we
keep doctors? That's
what lowers that, that's what
lowers Medicaid costs.
That's what helps all of us
a along the way.
So I think that's an important
dividing
line.
If I can't go to the doctor
is different than I just felt
like going to the, er, because, you know,
I had a hangnail and it was bugging
me in the middle of the night.
Ok.
Um,
the, the, the next thing
here is, uh,
we talk about everything
growing
and
I believe one of our, our
largest problems
with, with health care in
general in New Mexico
is the payer mix.
When Medicaid and Medicare
are paying for 80 or
85%
in, in, in a lot of the,
uh, areas, rural areas.
Um, so there's
no, no commercial
care.
That's part of the problem with,
with keeping
physicians. Ok?
Because physicians just,
I mean, they can go almost
anywhere else and make a lot more
money than on what we're
paying for Medicaid and Medic or
Medicaid.
And um
so how do we change
that? And again, that's an
economic issue.
How do you get employers in
here that will, that will provide
commercial insurance?
But I think those are two things which
are beyond your
scope, I admit,
but things that are very
important to the
department and
if you can help us fix
those two things,
I think that we then fix
your problems.
So thank
you. >> Thank you,
Representative Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and,
and thank you, I apologize
for missing part of the, the
um uh
presentation. But
um secretary,
I would like to know
where I'm so
excited and
happy that the
MC O Appointment standards
standards have been updated.
How do you
think that
the
actual people seeing the
patients
are gonna manage that
when we have a shortage?
How how do you see that
um
unfolding
>> uh Mr Chair
Representative Armstrong.
So just to clarify, are you
asking about like the administrative
folks in the offices that
support providers and
sort of their ability to
manage a
practice?
Um Just can
you clarify that question,
please? >> Uh
Most certainly,
Mr Chairman, I'm
wondering if you're
mandating the MC
OS to make sure these appointments
happen within
seven day calendar days,
the actual
behavioral health specialists that
are seeing the people,
how are they going to
manage that if
they're, because they're already
overworked and
I, I would assume
seeing as many patients as they
possibly can already,
>> Mr Chair Representative
Armstrong, I think that's a really
great question. Um
So our goal
through all of these reimbursement
increases and the workforce
supports is to build out
a system. So there's not as much
pressure on a single provider,
but really that
we, we have enough, we have
enough access to care to go
around um need
wise, but not enough to
meet the demand. So we're really trying to
build the supply
to meet the demand. And I think
it's really making those
investments to meet the
supply and
that will involve us
leaning very heavily on the
MC OS.
They should be making financial
investments. We've really
tasked them with
sort of reviewing the behavioral
health network looking at where
we need services,
making investments. It shouldn't
just be the state of New
Mexico, it should be
them coming to the table
and we've said to them
and there's been a lot of work on
this lately, um
come together,
really work together
to build out the network of care
that we need in New
Mexico and make those
investments with your dollars.
And I'm gonna talk this afternoon a little
bit about some of the
reinvestment expectations
that they will be that are
made in their new contracts to
do that. But I think
um it really does require
the system to come together
and strategically look, and
I don't think that's been happening. I
think everyone's been kind of like we're
gonna fill this gap over here
or we're just gonna live with this access
to problem access problem
here and we're not going to
really fix it or we're going to wait until the
state fixes it and that's not
acceptable. We really need
these carriers who are,
you know, we're paying billions of dollars
to make those investments. And I think
that will start to happen. I think that's
been communicated and we're really looking
at having um making
sure there was such a thirst
for those rural health care
fund dollars. As I mentioned
earlier, we had $500
million worth of applications and
we had $80 million to
give out. I
said to the MC O, I think you should
look at these applications, you
should see which ones
are really ready to go and
like start making those investments.
So I think they're listening,
it's gonna take some
urging along
and some partnership, but I
really feel like
it's gonna take that investment
to support those providers so that
they actually have the capacity.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you for that. I, I appreciate
that because I know,
um, I get complaints about that all
the time and I know
everybody in this room probably
does as well. And
so, uh, going
on to, uh, what
you mentioned about the,
um,
rural health care delivery
fund, um, I'm
really excited to
see,
uh,
that, uh,
it's actually working
and I'm hoping and, and I'm
pretty sure the answer is going to
be. Yes. But do you have data
to back up all the
money that we're putting in out
across the state? Are
we receiving any kind?
Are there any strings
attached to where they have to report
back data? I know
you said three of them are already
profitable, but
I'm not, of course,
I'm worried about profit, but I'm also are,
are worried about
access in those
communities. So, is there some kind
of data reporting that we will
get a chance to see?
>> Yes, Senator
Mr chair, Representative
Armstrong. Yes. There.
It's just like a grant. They have
to sort of submit all of
their, every the way that they
spend the money, what it's being
utilized for? We're tracking
the utilization data, the
workforce, how many people they've
hired? Um
we will be happy to report back
out on that. You know, it did just
launch uh sort
of at the end of 2023.
So it's
probably a little bit early to
be able to report out, but happy
to come back with that
information. For you.
>> Thank you for that
because as far as I'm concerned,
it's kind of like Lida,
we don't want to just throw the money
out there and hope that they are in
business for a couple of years.
We want them, we want it to
be sustainable for
them without
subsidy.
Eventually, you know,
subsidize the start up
and, and incentivize
that, but eventually
we would like to not subsidize.
And so, um I would, I'm
looking forward to seeing some of those
reports and hope that it goes the way
that I'm hoping it goes.
The other thing that I just want
to thank you for um
secretary is the
credentialing and
removing those barriers.
Um We have
had across the state of New
Mexico, so many
um entities that we're
waiting on credentialing
and so to implement
that in, in
uh we, I
believe we did it in law
and in,
in the rules. And
so I'm, I'm really
happy that you did that
and uh and, and
I'm actually proud of you
to, to be able to get that done
because it is a big
barrier, removing
barriers and being
fair in New
Mexico is
one of my top priorities
and this was one of them
and, and I'm just really
happy that, that, that you
got that done. And I don't know if
people in this room know how
hard it is and how
people tried really
to start a business
and waiting on the credentialing
forever and ever and
ever and ever
and hiring
an entity to help them get
through the credentialing. That's
how difficult it was.
And so spending
dollars they didn't have to spend.
So I'm just really proud that
you, you've, you've got that
done and let's hope that
we hold uh
the feet to the fire of
getting that credentialing out there.
So thank you for that
>> Mr Chair representative.
If I may just real quick, we would also
be happy to report back on the
time frame where we are today
for enrollment of providers
and credentialing and where
we end up because I think
there is going to be a lot of improvement
in those metrics as well. So
happy to share that with
you.
>> Thank you. We've got quite a few
people on the list,
so the
ice is melting and we'll have hot
water with our cokes if we keep
stalling. Senator Gonzalez,
>> thank you, Mr Chairman and I'll
make it real brief
Eric on the
legislative staff on page
one.
So with our
early childhood
program
from birth to four
years, does any of that tie
into this?
For example, like on
the low birth
weight,
>> um Mr Chairman
and Senator that more
tied into um
the measure on the second page
related to
words receiving
um you know, making sure
that mothers receive the
care that
um
a prior
to
um depending up with the
child
is
culture.
Have
>> Mr Chairman Eric,
what I mean, is,
are the programs tied
in or they're
completely
because right now the,
the early childhood program, we're
having it from birth
to four years
and uh maybe if that's
not happening, maybe we need
to because
why, uh you know,
work with a problem
if we could solve it. You
know.
So I'm just saying,
can they tie
in?
>> Um Mr Chair
Senator Gonzalez?
Um I do want to, we
do collaborate quite
closely with the early childhood
education and care department
in particular around
the home visiting program
which really targets
sort of prenatal
home visiting.
Um Women can also
be sort of new moms can also
be engaged in
that postpartum period, but
we are working really closely with
them. So I do think there's
a lot of overlap and
synergy today.
They're one of our closest
partners and
we're working really hard
together to try to
increase the uptake of that home
visiting program to
support uh
pregnant women
and new moms as they
sort of navigate
what that's like and the experience
and services that they need.
So, and also to
support sort of addressing those
prenatal measures
that Mr Shae
mentioned. So we are working closely
together but always
opportunity for improvement
too. >> And Mr
Chairman, I guess just to,
for my part to understand a
little bit more.
So that's good, you know
what you're saying? But
who pays for
it? >> Uh
Mr Chair,
Senator Gonzalez, we
actually pay for it Um the
early childhood education
and care department refers
women into our program and
we are the payer
work closely with >> them
very well. Thank
you,
>> Representative
Pansy. >> Thank you,
Mr Chairman. Um
Great to see you secretary.
Uh First of all, I just want to congratulate
you on a number of these
initiatives that you have
outlined. A lot of them are
long awaited.
Um And I think you're very exciting.
I'm
really pleased that LFC
is doing the legis that process
with your agency this year because
I think it'll really
allow us to dive
into how all of this is
rolling out. Um
The I just have
one topic to, to
ask you about which is
um network
adequacy
and um
how you
all are looking at that. It, it
strikes me as someone who's
been working on uh
access to healthcare
coverage that we're at a
better place than we
have been for years
between um
rising enrollment on the
exchange with private
insurance, um
health care affordability fund
programs,
Medicaid coverage,
potentially Medicaid forward
coming. Um We're
at a great place where people
finally have
not everyone, but
increasingly so people
have access to coverage,
but yet I think all of
us um hear from our
constituents about
long delays to get
appointments. Um and
certainly it seems
uh that Medicaid
is no exception to that.
Um So it just seems
like there's a bit of a
disconnect between
the
um access
to coverage side and then the access
to services side. And I
think one of the ways
um that we can
look at that is sort
of the
accuracy of the provider
network, the
completeness of that
network. Um But the
thing I really wanted to ask you about
was care, coordination and case
management at the MC O
si, don't really
know how that works.
Um And I look at
the appointment
standards that you have laid out
around, you know, people
should be receiving an appointment
within a certain time
frame of the request.
Um And then I think about
how an MC O
would even go about enforcing
that with these
huge provider networks.
And um
and I, I think about care
coordination. So could you just speak
to, you know, what happens
with care coordination, how you
all are measuring
that or reviewing
care coordination?
Um How do we know that
people are actually
getting help
faster?
>> Yes. So uh Mr
Chair, Representative
Spanski, thank you for the question.
I actually think um
care coordination. This
is actually one of the great
mysteries that I get asked
out, asked about a lot.
Um which is really what what
happens with that. I
think since the
launch of Centennial Care,
there's been a focus on this
sort of idea that
the MC O will call
members that will do health risk
assessments, they do a health risk
assessment to
determine. So what
category do people fall in?
Um Sometimes people respond
to that and some people, some people
don't, if it looks like
uh someone might need an additional
level of care, they get a sort of comprehensive
needs assessment that tells the
MC O everything they
really need. But
most of that care coordination
today is happening by the
MC O.
There are a lot of people
with serious health care
needs who don't really
understand who the MC O is
or really want to work with
them. So we are
actually changing that
focus in turquoise care
to a more delegated model
to really have a more
community based care
coordination model.
So for pregnant women, for
example, you know,
really know who this MC
O person is, but if someone from
their uh doctor's
office is reaching out
and helping they have the ability
to coordinate that care more
locally, um it's
gonna work a lot better. And so
we've really shifted the
focus. Um
And I'll be happy to share.
Uh I don't have this the data
on care coordination today. I'm
happy to send that though as a
follow-up item in terms of
like what services are provided.
What's the data showing?
Um I do think that care coordination
has been somewhat moderately
successful, but I we're really
look, looking to ramp
up in turquoise care, what
our expectations are that more
in person, for example, those Kara
moms, we're sending those care
coordinators to the hospital.
Um And we're having
community-based organizations
do it. Um We
were recently talking about care
coordination for Children in state
custody. And I asking
the MC OS to coll locate with
CYFD, like work
together, send a community-based
entity, a community health worker
to CYFD who could really
navigate the system and
sort of break through those barriers
and scheduling. So we,
that's really how we're looking at it.
That's going to be the new approach.
So we're happy to share
data. We'll, we'll provide that
to you, but it's really going to be
also more focused on those
high need populations,
not as much based
on um sort
of tiers of, of
members, but really, you know,
pregnant members, justice
involved members, those Kara
moms really
focused and targeted people
without housing so that we're
really targeting
uh those, those
members that really need it the most
and trying to break through the barriers in the
system for them.
>> Thank you for that. I think the
community-based model is really
exciting. Um
I would just Mr
chairman and um the
staff, I would just
encourage LFC as
we're looking at the
percentage of members
served and hopefully having
data on unique clients
that are being served particularly
for behavioral health.
And then looking at the secret shopper
survey, how
many phone calls does it take to actually
make an appointment? It would be really
wonderful to look at
care coordination too
and see what
role is that playing.
Because I think often
people who are seeking care, think they
have to call office after
office. They don't necessarily
know that they could call
one person and have that
person say, oh, this
is this person's booked up.
Let's call over here, let's check
this service.
Um And I
think we won't until we
figure that out, we're not gonna
see these numbers go up. People
are still not going to be able to get
access. So thank
you very much, Mr
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Mr chair members of
the committee.
So we tried
to have some legislation to
have some funding increase in
which we talk about behavioral
health and even the money
that was there was not fully
utilized, but there
was a shortfall after we kind
of had all the listings of the
needs compiled, which came out
to I think a little under 300
million.
But even then with the A
OC
that um that
distribution
is index for
inflation
but
not for the um
is what's collected
is index for inflation
but not the distribution
which reduces the value of the
money going
out.
So that was an issue.
The other was that the
funds
um
the language that was in there
did not prioritize
the commu community-based
initiatives that
need to be addressed.
So to me, those were like
very low fixes
that could have been addressed before you even
got here. Um I
hope there's something you can move
forward on that and make sure that does
not occur um with
whatever we're going to put forward. Thank
you, Mr Chair members of the >> committee,
Senator PDO. Could you explain
what funding source or what
you're, everybody's kind of looking
like. >> So, one of the
initiatives that I had
that I sponsored a bill with a couple
of other legislators were to
increase the excise
tax. And all
that funding would go to
all those programs that
intersect and merge over
to all these departments for
all those um
nonprofits, even the
programs that were existing
to fund them fully,
to build a foundation
um to address all these
needs. And even here and
with this in community, uh we
have seen an increase in gun
violence just within the
past two weeks. Um
Some of it was
occurred here and then bled
out to the Navajo nation.
So that needs
uh it,
it's, it's detrimental,
especially when we talk about our, our, our
Children and our community
safety. Thank you, Mr
Chair
>> represent
LR.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I
have had a chance to
go through this presentation.
I did have a couple of
questions if I may.
I'm looking at page
um Well, the page
six,
the cabinet secretary has
provided on real health
care delivery fund.
I'm just looking at the map in
general Mr Mr
Chairman
and I'd like to ask how
is service delivery
determined?
Is it population
based or is it needs
based or how is it actually
determined in rural
New
Mexico?
>> Mr Chair
Representative
Lundstrom,
are you asking about a specific
quantifier on here? >> I
am. When I look at the map, Mr
Chairman and I look at mckinley
County with
eight organizations
available and I
look at Sebola County with
eight and
mckinley counties has got two times
the population. My
question is,
I'd like to know
specifically
who those eight are
if they provide behavioral
health. And I'd like
to know specifically who the
MC OS are that services
this county
because it, it's alarming
to me, Mister Chairman
that we have a situation
here
where in one of the highest
need counties
with two times the population
of a neighboring county
that we've only got eight
service providers. So I'd like
to know who they are
and do they provide behavioral
help? >> Mr
Chair Representative Lundstrom, these
are, these are awardees
of this fund.
So these are the entities
that applied for and
received funding through the rural
health care fund. Um So they
basically, it was a competitive
award. We did try to focus
on behavioral health and primary care and I will
get you the list of those
awards here in
mckinley County. >> So you don't
know who they are and you're in mckinley
County today, >> you
know, I should have that. I can get it for
you. >> I'd like to know who they are.
Mr Chairman. I mean, I'd like to
know who they are because
it's important to understand who
the M CS are that
they would contact.
You know, what I remember about
M CS is once those
contracts are set
with the state of New Mexico, it's
hard to change what their service
delivery is going to be.
So my question is to
the LFC staff, can you
do that? Can you
now say with an MC
O contract that's already been
set up that now
we're going to be a
referral network
into providing health
service into places like mckinley
County. Is that a,
is that possible?
>> Charles
Mr Chair, Representative
Lundstrom, the intent of this
fund is to say
a provider
does not provide
family functional therapy,
which is a behavioral health
service for
juveniles
and the state can
ront the upfront, basically
cost of putting
that into place, help you hire,
give you money to hire the person,
give you money to train the
person. Um
And then that service is
already built into the MC
O contracts and the Medicaid
program. And then that provider
would start billing once they saw
patients um for
that, that, that particular
service, >> then I misunderstood
what the answer was here by the
panel because I said that
um there
is a referral
process, then a
referral process
that if my local provider
has a question, they
can call the MC O on
my behalf and say,
gosh, you know, we need
this done and,
and, and what have
you, how does that work?
>> That would be Mr Chairman
Representative
Lundstrom, the care
coordination that we're paying for at
the MC O level.
Say I'm having trouble
finding that provider in
mckinley County, but I need
a service. I can call
the care and
they can help find
the family functional
therapist um
that's available down the street
because the one I called wasn't
available because their
caseloads too big. >> And
isn't it true, Mr Chairman,
that many of these rural
folks I know myself
included have to
receive health
care in Bernalillo
County. So
does it, does it
include outside
of my county to
receive that health
care
>> the
the needed
uh specialty service?
Um The MC O would help you
find where that is
available. If it's not
available in your local community,
it could be in another
community that does have it
>> because I think that is an
incredibly important
statistic to have.
I would think that it is
well known that it
is a kind of
a inordinate amount of
burden for these
metropolitan hospitals
and care providers
when they're taking on the entire
population of the
state. Be
prime because we don't
have the services in rural
New Mexico.
So I, I want to know
who those applicants
were,
who are they? >> Um I do
have it. Uh Mr Chair
Representative Lundstrom, I apologize.
I did have it in my packet. Uh
just took me a minute to find
it. Um, here in
mckinley County, we're funding
Family Medicine Associates
that's providing women's
health. We're
providing um funds
to first nations community
health source, that's primary
care and behavioral health.
We are providing funds to
Frontera health, New
Mexico. That is behavioral
health as well.
We have Gallup Community
Health, that's primary care
and behavioral health.
We have jumpstart
LLC, that's
also behavioral
health
and we have
Presbyterian Medical Services
providing primary
care. >> Ok,
Mr Chairman of those that were
listed, I think there's three that
I know that are
basically
started and here
I think the others actually
are headquartered outside of
mckinley County. Is
that, is that the case for some
of these? And they're just
expanding then into
mckinley County. >> Mr
Chair Representative
Armstrong. That's true. The
the does
allow for providers
to stand up services and
expand in a rural
counties. So that could be the
case and I could
get the details of all these applications
for you. I'd be happy to share
it. I also missed one. We
are also funding Sibilla
General Hospital
Children's Health Services. >> I just
want to make sure that it's not just
going to be
video
cameras
because they don't have the
provider physically in
mckinley County
and because they've stood
up an operation
out of Bernal
Leo into Gallup.
That is going to be more than
just video conferencing
for behavioral health.
We need people on the
ground, we need people
that actually see patients
face to face
and actually understand what
the conditions are and there's
no available
triaging for them after
they are
finished with their appointments.
And I would like to ask
then Mr Chairman, is
that then available
from the, if a
organization out of Burnley
County or
anywhere in the country
sets up a
business in
mckinley County to provide
behavioral health,
are we then going to be
able to monitor what's actually
happening there,
>> Mr Chair Representative
Lundstrom? Absolutely.
Um The intention is
not for telehealth services. These are
actually like these are
funds for brick and mortar
services that to actually
like stand up services in the
community for
real face to face
visits. Um I,
I will pull the full detail
on all of those funded for
mckinley County and we will be
overseeing them very closely.
We're working really closely with them
to make sure that they're
successful
and that we're addressing
barriers for
them. So there are some
providers that have struggled with some
of their start up plans. So we're helping
them make adjustments and providing some
technical assistance along the
way. >> I'm very, I want
to just say I'm very supportive
of this rural health care
delivery fund, but
just like uh
rural uh
telemedicine or
rural education,
these kind of programs
that are set up specifically
with the understanding you're gonna be
videoconferencing
in rural New Mexico where there's
no broadband
capability and
there's nobody there that can actually
explain to you what you've just been
told where there's no
quick referral to
ask a question.
I would have concerns about that.
I want to make sure it's not just video
conferencing that it
is more and it's a deeper, it's
a deeper type of
service.
Um
and I'd also be curious
why we only,
uh, of those that aren't
necessarily located in
mckinley County that are
standing up
services
because we'd be a high
Medicaid
county.
Was that consistent throughout
the state where you have high
Medicaid
payers?
Are they standing up these
services then? So
they are able to be paid?
>> Uh, Mr Chair
Representative Lundstrom,
yes, that was a criterion that
was used. It was we wanted
to make sure that we were looking
at Medicaid utilization. The
providers actually have to be
Medicaid providers in order
to receive the services,
uh, or the funding.
And we wanted to make sure that there was some
distribution across the counties.
And I think we
ensured a lot of
statewide distribution so that we weren't
really focusing in just one area.
We wanted to make sure that we weren't distributing
those funds across
New Mexico. And again,
there are some counties that weren't eligible
because they're not rural counties. But
um other than that,
the funding was
distributed based on
that formula with
Medicaid distribution and
Medicaid um
population also a factor in the
scoring. You >> know, that,
that is my final comment. Mr
Chairman is when I look at some of
these counties,
you take San Juan as an
example, there's a major
rural population there.
Same way with Sandoval,
Santa Fe. All these counties
have rural populations
that don't necessarily get
served uh
by, I
don't know Presbyterian in Burn
Leo. You know, I, I think
that
gosh, I hate to see anybody
that lives in a small rural
community not
eligible then or they
can't apply for these.
Um I
understand that you need more money
into this, but
I, I'm very, very interested
in what's happening in mckinley
County. I want to know
how many patients are being run
through there. I'd like to
know who's actually standing
these things up
and how um
service delivery is
determined. Thank
you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, II I
will I get my
comments. Uh
Senator
Rodriguez,
thank you, Mr Chairman. Good
morning. I don't know what time
it is. Good afternoon already.
Uh Secretary
Aeos and of course
our great staff, Eric, thank you
for your presentation and your work.
Uh, just um quickly
here, one of the
um, things I noticed
from the very answer and I was
impressed with that Carri,
if I may call you that,
um, from the beginning
of your presentation
was you mentioned that
one of your priorities, in
your words was measuring
access to care.
And I think all that we have discussed
today focuses on
that. How do we measure
access to care and it's
through data. And
uh you did go forward
later on and indicate
that you
would be reporting on
data that
has to do with the MC
OS. For example,
how many people I'm using your
words, how many people have they
hired and for what?
So we can make sure we,
we know what the MC Os
look like as we're doing
these, these
um lucrative
contracts
now. And the reason I say
lucrative is because I know that we
have spent an appropriate
approximately $1
billion just for
behavioral health services
alone. That that's a
pretty significant amount
if I may say it myself.
And so to lack
the data that is necessary
to adequately
monitor
the performance, the
results, the patient
outcomes.
Um It does not
seem like the right thing to do
at this. Not only
now that we're seeing a very
strong, um,
increase in
the need for behavioral health
services and,
uh, and just people on Medicaid
and so on. So all
that being said, let me get
to the issue here
and, um,
the last health committee meeting
we had and even
prior to that, uh,
anytime the issue comes
up about behavioral health
services and I know it's
not HSD anymore, it's
the, I'm sorry, health
care authority now. Ok.
Um The,
the having to
do with the HM OS and they
may be doing a great job. It's
not any insinuation
whatsoever here.
But the same question
keeps coming up
and the same response keeps
coming up and we still
don't have the data and it has to
do with this is
that we may have
some data as to how
the MC OS exist,
how many people they hire, as I said
before and what their administration
um looks like the
organizational chart and so
on. But the data
needs to be given
to us
for the patients
themselves who are the
focus of this whole
scenario, this
whole contract
process and behavioral
health services and MC
OS and HSD and all that
we do should be focused
on the patient. How can
we monitor the outcomes?
What, what kinds of
services are being
provided by the HM
OS to these
patients? Are
they, how many
people were
treated for depression?
How many people were treated
for uh lack of
nutrition. Um
How many, you know, different
areas we understand
because of HIPAA laws that we can't
have names on there. We're not
asking for names. We're just
merely asking for
the types of
services that are being provided
to how many clients so we can
break it down and know what we need
to improve, uh what
we do
now, what we have been
told in the past And I don't know
if it's still the case,
but I have strongly
disagreed with this is that
the, the
contracts themselves
have proprietary
provisions
that are blended into the
contracts that
preclude the state
from requiring
MC O contracts
uh to,
to uh report
on these issues that I'm
talking about with specific
detailed data about the
patient again,
just the, the services
provided or the
ailment. Um
And if that's the case,
then how can
we justify
spending this enormous
amount
um on these contracts
if we're not getting the
information and the
results that we need to
monitor the, the
performance
um of the MC
OS and the services
provided to
these patients.
And I know we're discussing specifically
behavioral health, but I'm talking
this and generally
all blended into Medicaid.
So we
used to get it in
the past, Carri,
we used to get all this
information from
HSD Van.
Um having to do with
lots of different areas.
We used to get the information
on measuring the number, the percent
of clients served through
evidence-based practices,
prevention services, high
fidelity wraparound services
and on and on. And now
we're just not getting any
of that. And uh
I guess at this
point, um we're just
wanting some data
and do you plan
to change that or to work towards
changing that? And if so
last question, when can we
get the information? Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Chairman >> Mr
Chair Senator Rodriguez.
Uh First of all, I
would love to apologize
if that's the case. I
definitely
um
always um a
proponent for
transparency. Uh I
definitely would not
be uh the
person that would make a call not
to share data with you all. It's
data on your investments
and for the people of New
Mexico,
um we
do actually get quite
a bit of data and in
fact, I think we actually
do have data that may have been
referenced as
missing during the
report. So I think we would be happy
to have that
conversation.
Every single
Medicaid claim
that equals a reimbursement
has a
patient,
the the service
provided the primary
diagnosis oftentimes
the secondary and tertiary
diagnosis. So we have a
lot of data on what people
need and why they're accessing
care. If there's something
you all need, I would be
more than happy to work with you
to make sure that you get it.
Um We're, we're really
available to provide that. I just don't
know what I haven't been asked for
anything um The
only thing that I know of that
is really proprietary data
is really based on the contract
between the MC O and the
provider in terms of what is
actually paid in that
contract. Um
That is proprietary.
We do get that financial
data, it is just
not data that is
allowed to be shared
widely by
provider. We can share it
in the aggregate,
we can say on average,
here's what the Mc Os are paying for
this service. But we can't
say between
you know, the MC O and this
provider over here, how much that
contract negotiation is? We
do see that data, but that's the
only part that is
not sort of
at that granular level
available. And then of course, there's HIPA
protections but anything in the
aggregate, we would be happy to provide
and I'm more than willing to have
that conversation with you about what you
need. Thank you, >> Mr
Chairman. But that again
is on the aggregate.
But my main point
is what
services are these
patients within this aggregate
scenario? We're talking about
what services are they getting
are following them? Who monitors
them and how, and
um I understand
what you mentioned, Carrie about
the, the fact that we can't
require
um and even
that, I don't understand why, but I guess
it's part of the contract
provisions in there
but why we can't
require information
to know how much
of the contract
amount is going
to certain services that
the MC OS are providing.
We need to know whether
part of it is going, how much
is going to behavioral health,
substance abuse,
depression, as I'm just using
these terms, whatever it may
be in there. So we can
again monitor that this thing
in the aggregate. I
mean, it, it's good, but you don't
help us to define
where the real problems are
and how, what we can do to
fix them and how we can do it
together. That's what I'm asking.
Thank you, >> Mr
Chair Senator. We'll be
happy to work with you. We have all,
we have all the service data,
so I'm not sure why
it ceased to be provided,
but we'll be happy to have
that conversation and revive it so we
can get you what you need. >> Ok.
Thank you. And I'm going to get deeper into
this a little more carry
by
when
>> more
Mr Chair Senator,
we I think
what would be helpful would be to have a
conversation with either some
select group to figure out what you
really need um
so that we can pull it. I
think it's when you're
pulling data. It's a pretty big
data warehouse that we have,
we get a lot of financial
information. So it's really
just kind of honing in on what
you all want to see and happy to work
with um
Mr Shae on the
details of that request
and then we can kind of put together some
kind of proposal. But uh you
all also invested
in a new data
team uh for
our agency uh
partially because of
this issue around making sure
that we're providing the
transparency that
everyone deserves to
have. Um And so we're
building out that team, but we have a
data guru
at our agency, happy to take a request
back as soon as possible. And we'll, we'll
try to put a timeline
on what we can provide
and when it's just we need to kind of provide
some parameters on what you all
need. >> Thank you
and finally, Mr Chairman and thank
you, Carrie for that. Um
Is uh basically,
I, I would like the
department to
do at least one
thing here to do all
possible to
ensure that any
and all information coming
out of that contract
that is not
prohibited by law
um HIPAA loss, for
example, be
broken down into,
into a data that
data collection we're talking
about that's useful for us
to be able to, to
follow the performance
and me performance measures
and also clients and so
on to see where we need to do more
and what areas for, for
people and patients that need
this help. Um,
and so if it's just the,
the amounts that you
said between
A, an MC O and
the provider they contract
with for services
and that's different. You
know, I'm, I'm
concerned, I mean, I would like to
have that too because it should be
about full transparency,
not only partial and
if there's a way that we can
get that out, it would be
great. Um, so,
um, I'll leave it at that. I think
I pounded on this enough. But,
um, yeah, we can talk and meet
whatever you need any more questions
or information you
need from me. I'll be happy to have thank
you, Mr Chairman. >> Just to
add to Senator Rodriguez's point.
I mean, this is all public money.
So when they're awarded a
contract that money,
we want to see how much flows from
the providers to the
actual providers,
what they're getting paid and
what's not flowing to the providers
because the provider rate increase
were based upon those
providers making more
money than
the contract. And
so that's a detailed,
want to see. We should be able to see
everything. It's public
money. No dollar should
be hidden. So when we
go to look into that, if,
if the MC O just don't want to
know what their contract is,
then I guess we'll start I
A and in filing suits
to get those numbers, if we have
to if we have to, we'll
bring them in front of LLC
and make them raise their right hand
and we'll put them under oath
if, if we're going to go in that
depth. But this is all public
money. It's, it's pretty
simple, one more
person. And then me, Representative
Ellison,
>> thank you, Mr
Chair.
Any time that new
services or new
agencies are
established, it
seems that people that
benefit are the
metropolitan areas, the
urban people and
the rural people are often
neglected.
Um
I am very interested
in your rural health care
delivery fund
where
you said that you're trying to
support 54
organizations across
28 rural
counties.
I'm here to tell you that
we have
the New Mexico Alliance
of Health and tribal
councils established
in 33 counties
and nine native
communities.
Are there any plans
to co-operate,
communicate and
collaborate with
this organization across New
Mexico? So you
can attain your goals.
They have already
uh started some of the goals
that you list in your mission,
vision and goal
statement. In fact,
uh their mission statement is
very, very, very
close to yours. So, are
there any plans to co-operate
with that organization?
Thank you, Mr Chair,
>> Mr Chair Representative
Allison. I think that's
a really great suggestion.
I um
we will definitely
be happy to collaborate with them.
I, I would love to do that work
with them. Um So we do
have another 46
million in
funding for fiscal year
25 for this rural
funding. Um
And I will commit
to you to reach out and
make sure that we start those connections
if we haven't done a very good job of
that. So I will make sure that we do
that after we leave
today.
>> Ok. Thank you for that Mr
Chair.
In this past legislation,
I was finally able to
get uh some
money for them to the tune
of 3 million. We
had been asking for
6.1
but uh this is the
first time that they were ever
awarded any money and
it was uh 3 million.
So if you've got
46 million,
we'd love to see the other
remaining 3.1
million allocated to them.
So, thank you madam
secretary. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you. Uh you
know, in your presentation, it's my
page three. There's some
things that are pretty alarming to
me and it's
raising the Medicaid reimbursement
rates and we're pushing that out to
2025
when the fiscal year starts
in July 1.
Why are those rates not
ready to go on July
1?
>> Uh Mr Chair, we
received an appropriation to go
up to 100 and 50%
of the Medicare rate,
but we only received enough
funding for half of the
year. So in order to
get to 100 and 50% of
Medicare, we will have to
start those rate increases in,
in January. I
would say that
it is actually a better plan to do
it in January and I think that the
agency feels
like,
um, and I'm gonna talk about this this
afternoon. I know there's more
discussion on the rates, but
the amount of work that
it takes to do these rate
increases is very
substantial. And doing them
in July has resulted in a lot
of retroactive reprocessing
that has been a headache for
providers, um,
and a burden for
everybody. Um,
we think that it's better to
tie those to January
going forward. Um
And in this instance,
we actually received, there is other
money that will be flowing out in
July
and I'll talk about that today,
but for that, we only
received enough to do
six months of that
funding
>> Eric, is that correct? That we only
funded them for six
months?
>> Uh Mr
Chairman.
So
the language in House Bill
two is
for
up to 100 and
50%
of Medicare
and we were trying to leave that
language, um,
broad so
that
honestly, the department wasn't
super clear on how much it would cost
for a full year.
Um,
and we weren't totally
sure how much that was going to cost.
Right. And so it's up to 100 and
50%. We didn't know if that was
gonna cover the
entire year, um,
for 100 and 50% that
could go to 100 and
40% or 100 and
30%.
Um, with that
appropriation,
>> Mr Chair, I
think during those
legislative discussions, we were
clear that those would roll out in
January. That's, that's my
recollection. I'm
sorry if it wasn't clear, but
we, we can't get to
150% of
Medicare with that appropriation
for a full year.
>> You can get to another number
whether it's 1
25 1
3140
I mean, the Mark Tennis administration
since started this,
they started this with
ending in a calendar
year and starting
and then coming back in the next
year and saying, oh, we had a shortfall
and we need to backfill. I mean, this is
a Marous administration
move that they started this
and, but when we appropriate
money to start in July,
that should be the start date, whether
you get to 110, whether you get
to 115
and we start triggering up that
money needs to flow
because you're gonna come back and
say, oh you shortfall this next,
this last year and
you go to the maximum like
it, the language says
in here but not in house
Bill two. And then
everybody's saying, well, it says 150
but we're not getting 150. And
so, I mean, that's the
same thing with this behavioral health
clinics that
will be uh in
125. Why are we
waiting till, till,
till January of 25
to start these
clinics?
>> Mr Chair, uh I'll,
I'll let Mr BCA speak to
the roll-out plan for
the certified community
Behavioral Health Clinics
just real quick on the rates
though. There's
no January for
or July 1st. Date in the
bill. I do want to just say
that it doesn't direct the agency
to raise the rates on
July 1st.
So we're just following what
the law says to try
and get up to that 150%
of Medicare the
budget. The agency's
budget request will
include in its base that
continuation of that
150
appropriation
in fiscal year 20
>> six. Doesn't the agency's
budget start on July
1st.
>> Mr Chair. It does, of course,
but not every, not every
initiative begins on July
1st. And so we knew that that
appropriation was enough
for the six months
to get us to
150.
I'm sorry if that wasn't transparent
during the session. We're happy to have
some discussion about that, but
um we thought we made it pretty
clear, it >> apparently
wasn't because we had to put language
in the back of the bill
to get you there. And so that
number was never clear in the beginning.
So,
>> um Mr
Chair, thank you for the question
regarding uh certified
community behavioral health clinics
or CCBH CS.
We have currently
applied to the federal
government to
enter into the demonstration
phase um
for CCBH
CS. And we
are awaiting an answer on
that application which we're
anticipating to be mid to late
June with the roll
out on the federal
plan of being
later in the, in the year.
So we may be able to
start before January
1st, but it's a little bit of a
conservative date as
to when that will be
uh if we are awarded,
which I believe we have a good
chance for
um to
be effective January
1. So we are
also looking at Plan
Bs. So if we are
not awarded, how do we
continue to move forward with
this and provide
that critical service?
So right now,
the, you know, the
um the plan or
the timeline is
contingent on whether or not
we're awarded through the federal
government.
>> I I mean,
how much money? I think
700 million last
year we put in behavioral health,
right? And, and
we can't stand these clinics
up on our own to build that
backbone of that structure back
up after it was destroyed.
And why can't we build
it up on our own with the amount of money that we
have in Babri Health right
now and
then say, ok, if the feds come in,
then the program, it will work. I mean,
this is a, a major
topic in every
corner of
every state and every
city in every county in the state
of New Mexico. Why
are we waiting
to stand these up
when we have that amount of
money sitting there?
How much did not go use last
year? Eric in
behavioral health? I mean, we had
20 million sitting in ARPA
money that was
for, for
to, to start these
clinics to
get the buildings to turn on the
lights, to buy equipment
that was ARPA appropriated in
2020 or 2021
that sat there for three
years, $20 million
that didn't get used to standing
up. And now we're saying, oh,
we're gonna wait and see if we get a federal
award when we have this
amount of money
sitting there to get this
majority of our issues.
Governor wants to talk about a
special session. This is
dead center right in
the crosshairs of a
special session if
we can't provide these
services. And
we go to a special session saying
we're gonna alleviate
the problem with homelessness and
mental health
and we're waiting for a
federal,
uh, grant reimbursement
to do this.
We're just spending our tires in the
mud and,
and it's sad because at
some point, I mean, I,
you hear about this all the time
and I'm gonna ask you about mckinley County
because I'm gonna tell you how it really
works
is we're sitting
here spinning our tires in the mud
and there's not one person
in this entire building
or entire state that needs
this issue resolved in
their communities
everywhere.
So why are we waiting on the feds
and not standing this program up right
now when we had 20 million
appropriated,
>> Mister Chairman. Thank you for the
question. It
is not that we're waiting on it.
We do have six clinics
that are provisionally certified. We
also have two that got
congressionally directed
funding. They
have been certified what we're
trying to do is
to have the system
in place through the federal so that we
can use the state general funds
for other programs, including
things like the evidence-based
practices that we're
trying to expand on.
The program is going to go forward.
We are committed to CCBH
CS and we have
a number of other clinics
including in rural areas
that are interested in moving
forward so that the
dollars are there.
Uh And the intent is
there, we would just like to
try and make sure that we're
utilizing federal dollars
as opposed to the state dollars
first as our first
option. And
that's what we're awaiting on that
answer. But we do have
six that are
provisionally certified as of
today. Um
We do have two that
got CD F funding
um including uh
Santa Fe Recovery, which also
operates here in mckinley
County and I'm going to be
visiting with them this
afternoon. Um
to kind of talk about what are some of those
options because there are a lot of
start-up costs that we're trying to
offset and not put that
on the provider.
So this way they can be ready
when they do get that provisional
certification and move forward,
but they can have a turnkey
operation.
>> So, I mean, Carri just stated she
had $46 million of
flexibility. I
mean, there, there's
the money, there's grow
money in there. I was told right
for this year to stand those
up, there's
money everywhere. I mean,
instead of just approving
provisionally six,
we should be at the 60
year or 100
and 60 number. I mean,
I don't know how many years we've talked
about behavioral health and
the issues that are coming and,
and because of what happened in the prior
administration to rebuild
that, but we're six years
into this administration
and we've gotten
zero
six.
I mean, that
is
morally really wrong.
So, I mean, the $46
million can be used anywhere. The grow
money is committed. We should
be standing those clinics up.
So that's just my comment.
I mean, I think we're probably gonna have you back
or circle back around and, and
give us a detailed explanation
of why these aren't getting
done because
it's not for a lack of money
and it's not for lack of
resources,
>> Mr Chair. I hear
you what? We'll take it
back to the team. I hear what you're
saying, which is go faster,
build out the system of care
we need. So we will
take back, we'll look at what other funding
opportunities we have and
we'll be happy to come back. >> How
much are you planning on reverting in
this year's budget,
>> Mr Chair? I don't
have that answer for you
yet. We will
have more information for you on
that soon if you want to know,
but I don't have that today. >> I mean,
those are bars that I would look
at it and say, you
know, those are things that need to
happen in the state.
Eric. Do you know how much they reverted
last year?
Well, the south current authority
wasn't
>> Mr Chair. I'll have to get that to you. I,
I think it was,
um,
>> Mr Chairman.
Um,
so their
fy 23 audit,
um, actually says they should have
reverted 31
million. They didn't
do that on time and it ended up
being an audit finding in
there.
>> You're gonna have 31 you had 31
million in the last year. So, I mean,
that's, I'm gonna
look for, for bars for make
those transfers to get this done. I
mean, there's no
reason why we shouldn't be getting
it done. It's just,
it's, it's an
excuse
when we know that need is so
great.
I'd like to see the ones in,
in Sebola County too.
But in mckinley County,
the three you're talking about. I know
the locations, but there's
three more that I've never even seen
a location in mckinley County.
I can tell you where P MS services
and if you don't call on Monday at eight
o'clock and they don't answer the phone,
you get no mental health
services. Now,
the clinic, uh Galp
Clinic, Community Health
Clinic is a start up over a two
year period. So they're just,
they're growing and they're growing
tremendously. The
other clinic has just been sold
out by a private practitioner
to another company. So we don't know if
that's going to continue their
private services. The other
three,
give me a physical address because
I, I'm pretty
much around town quite a bit
and I've never seen an
address and a
card on the post
office next to the wanted
poster or anything
saying you can get
mental health services here.
So I really don't think
they exist in this county
in a physical local where
people can say
we need to take them there and, and
I know they don't exist because
if we talked to the police
officers,
they have no place to take them
but to jail for mental
health. And so
they lock them in a cell.
There's no treatment. There's
Santa Fe recovery is,
is more of an alcoholic and
maybe they're moving that, that
direction, but they
just don't exist. And it would be interesting
to see which ones exist in Sebola
because I may know of
two in Sebola. But I don't drive
around that town every morning.
So I can't tell you their
physical location.
So maybe
you ought to just do that for statewide
and then maybe we'll have
another conversation in Carl's
bed on
how we're gonna get through this resolved
because
every session we come here
and, and every session they're saying,
oh, how much money did you guys give
to mental health? And we said 700
million is sitting out there for mental
health and we're
not moving,
moving the needle at all, we're
not getting the help and
the special session is
coming. And if
you can't explain to the
executive
who wants to,
to retain
people and give them these services
and we don't have the places to do
that.
There's no need for a special
session.
So thank you. I
know I'm a little bit hard but Senator
Rodri, thank you. >> Just
be. Thank you, Mr Chairman before
you um go on to the next
topic. And uh let me, let
me just say
it in a, in a very
synopsis or, or
short ways if I
can that
um you know, in
these MC O contracts
that we're talking about, if
we have a quest to
ensure transparency,
which we're all talking
about
and
more than a quest,
but a determination to
provide some
meaningful
behavioral health
services,
ensuring all of
that. Um
Why is it that we
couldn't have a carrier? Maybe
we can to have
the information that we
need to, for
example, on
the administrative
costs of the MC
OS, how much is their
administrative costs
and how much is
their profit?
Um And
how much is actually going
into direct services
for these clients and patients
that we're talking about and into what
areas? Um
as we said, how many were served?
What areas are they served in
and for what and that kind of thing?
So is that
possible to get that information
to us when you get this data
for us? >> Carrie Mr
Chair, Senator. Yes,
we have it and
there's pretty clear contract
requirements on what their profit can
be with their administrative cost can
be and then what the amount is that
they have to pay toward actual
services. So that's
all set forth and it's actually part of
my presentation this afternoon so we
can talk about it more than, but we will,
I am committed to providing
you the data you need. >> Ok.
Thank you. So clarify
for me in a nutshell here. If you
can, what is it that you
can't provide that you said
other than this and this
and this, we can
provide you the
data. So what is it that you
can't provide about these
contracts that by
law we couldn't have? For example,
when I say law, I don't mean our
laws that too, but I mean
federal laws or whatever restrictions
we have. Thank
you. Thank you, >> Mr Chair
Senator Rodriguez. It's really
just limited to the
negotiated amount
specifically
between the carrier
and a provider. Those
are federal antitrust
laws do not allow us
to share that information. The agency
gets information about
that. We share
it in the aggregate, we can say,
for example, Blue Cross
is on average paying
120% of
Medicare for these services
over here. We do see
that, but we
can't share the
agreed upon amounts
between, you know, they
might be paying 100 and 30%
they might be paying 100 and 50%
of Medicare. They have negotiated
rates. There are federal
laws that protect that information.
>> I see. Ok. But because as
Senator Munoz mentioned is public
money, I'm wondering
in, in these scenarios
you're describing between the
MC O and the provider,
there has to be proprietary
information. Apparently,
then um
the MC O would still
have the
um the
responsibility to
provide the information
to us as
to what they're
requiring from the
providers to see
that these patients are being served.
Our only goal
here is to make sure that
the patients are getting the services
they need. And,
um, I,
I guess so
we, we give, we do this
millions of dollars contracts
to the MC OS, the MC OS
contract with providers, but we're
not supposed to know between the
MC O and the provider
information because that's
proprietary. So
how does, but the MC
O hopefully gets
it, but we don't
get it. And we're the ones that
are looking
and at
allocating
the funds, the public money
to ensure these services are met
for the people. >> Mr
Chair Senator. I
mean, we're happy to provide everything
that's available.
We do see those
financials,
there's a lot of
oversight that actually does
occur. Um
We're happy to provide what
we can share within
the boundaries of,
of the law
and I'm absolutely committed.
I do want to say I haven't, no
one's to my knowledge,
submitted a request to me
saying that we really want to see all of
this data. So I would
love to partner
with you, make sure
we know what you need and
get you that information. I'm
definitely not withholding
anything that is
available publicly and
absolutely
100% agree
that these are public
funds and we will
provide maximum transparency
to all of you. Absolutely
want that as a taxpayer and a New
Mexican myself. So
uh very committed to doing
that. We'll partner with you to make sure
that we get you that
information. Thank you. >> And
again, it's Mr Chairman. It's not only
for me, of course, individual, but for the
whole committee and, and wherever
it needs to go for the public
also. So, thank
you very much. I appreciate that in
place. Again, as I said, it's not
insinuating that you're not being
transparent, but we see
the gaps here where we can all
improve and ensure that
we do all we can.
Thank you.
>> Thank you for your time
and, and you got a lot of work to
do. Your guru should be able to
get us a lot of those answers if we're
paying a guru. So
pretty quickly, >> Mr
Chair, she, she will be able
to, I think I'm not quite
done. So I'm coming back for more
later. So you can
ask me some more questions. >> You're more than
welcome to join us for lunch. Lunch
is out in the hall. Sabrina
President of U and M has provided
her lunch. Do you want to say something really
quickly?
And
I'll take
credit.
So we'll find out
uh over here in a bag.
I did get rugs for
all the little members
and they're called lamp rugs and they're
so they're a matching pair.
I'm not gonna let pick
out the colors. I'm gonna let you guys do
that because if I give the wrong color to
somebody I will get the
blame. And
so they're, they're
called lamp rugs and they come in
sets so you can
put your lamps on them or whatever.
But I got them for
everybody from out of town, everybody
from in town already probably just
got a little set.
So, uh you're
