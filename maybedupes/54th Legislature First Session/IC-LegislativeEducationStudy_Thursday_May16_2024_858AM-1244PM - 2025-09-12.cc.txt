>> Good morning everyone and
anybody who's watching online,
we're starting a couple of minutes late but not
too bad. Um We're
here in Los Lunas for the
second day of the LES
C. I'm uh,
Bill Soul State Senator from
Las Cruces and acting as Chair
today as our Chair who is a
current high school teacher
is finalizing grades
for his seniors that I think
tomorrow is their last day
this year. So he's off
doing that. Uh,
before we get started, one of
the announcements is
the tour this
afternoon of
the
Meta Center is
just for Les C
Members and staff.
And so it's not open to,
to everyone. I just want to make sure
everybody's aware of that.
Um, here in Las Luna, uh
the Las Luz district
and superintendent Kilter
is going to be uh
presenting highlights
of their district.
And uh
you, I guess, I guess a
brand new super, relatively
new superintendent. Uh when
the Secretary of
Education, uh
Arsenio left for
the Public Ed Department.
Uh loss Luiss is also one of
the districts named in the lawsuit
against the Public Ed Department
attempting to halt the 180
day rule. So that's
some interesting little
juxtaposition of,
of roles, I think with that.
But uh Superintendent Kelter
or Kettler, I'm sorry,
Kettler.
Uh we're,
we're here for you. >> Thank
you, Mr. Vice
Chair. Good morning
and welcome to Los Lona
schools in our
Terry Ortiz teacher
resource center. I hope
um, you enjoyed breakfast this
morning that was prepared by our
maintenance and student nutrition
department. Um, who does a
fabulous job. Um,
we've had Maury
and um, John SCF
working on the it side of
things. And so,
um, a lot of time and
effort has been put
in to welcome you to our
wonderful school district.
Um We are honored to host the
legislative edu uh
education study Committee
uh both today and for a half
day tomorrow. And
we appreciate this opportunity
uh to host a group of
legislators who work
diligently uh
for the students of New
Mexico. Um But
we are also honored to be able
to present to you today some
information about our district.
Uh My name is Ryan Ketler. I
am the superintendent for Los Luna
Schools. I'm in my first
year as superintendents
um anywhere
um but particularly here
in, in Los Salina schools.
And um
prior to accepting this
position, uh I worked
in um Rio Rancho
and before that in Albuquerque
Public Schools with me
today is Chief Student
Services Officer, Susan
Chavez and Chief
Academic Officer Jessica Montano.
I will let each of them introduce
themselves when we get to their
part of the
presentation.
Um However, before
we jump in, one of the
wonderful things about loss
Luna schools is our large
number of, of employees
who grow up in our community,
who graduate from our high
schools, who go to
colledge, um
or straight into the workforce
here for loss Luna schools
and come back to
dedicate their entire professional
lives to Los Schools. It's
very unique and I think it's
what one of the things that makes
us um lo salo
schools
today. I want to share with you an overview
of Lona schools,
the challenges that we are facing
with our 2425
budget and a look ahead
at a few of the important things
that are happening um in
our district. Uh We
will also share a few commitments
that we have uh
to our community and to our
students. And this is just
a small sampling of a
larger uh
program that we
offer in Los
Luas.
But due to time constraints, we
had to pare it down to some
of the uh the
highlights.
Um Our mission in
Los Luna uh is
preparing empowering and
inspiring all students to
reach their maximum potential.
Our vision is that
Los Luna schools will be the premier
school district in the State of New
Mexico by exemplifying
high levels of learning for all
students. And our motto
is every student
matters and every moment
counts.
Los Luna is a wonderful
place to live.
Los Luna. Schools are a
wonderful place to work
and for kids to go to school.
Last summer when
the superintendent position was posted,
I had absolutely no
hesitation about
applying. Um
In fact, I was in Chicago,
Illinois and uh the
posting went up and
um before I even left
Chicago, I had uh put
together my resume and, and
submitted my application.
We have a great mix of
small town community
feel with larger
town amenities. Uh
We are rural but we
also have the conveniences of
Home Depot and Walmart and
Starbucks, which is
fabulous. Um
At last check, we
were the 10th largest
district in New Mexico.
Um We currently have
8239
students in Los Luna
schools. Uh
and you can see the breakdown
there. Um 74%
Hispanic Latino,
13% white Caucasian,
9% American Indian
Alaskan native.
Um
2% black or African
American and then less than
1% Asian, Hawaiian
and Pacific Islander.
We have 10 elementary
schools, two middle schools
and three high schools, one
of which is an alternative
school, uh which also
has houses our family
school, Digital Academy.
And in addition to that, we have
eight support sites.
Um I believe that we are
still the largest employer in
Valencia County with
more than 1500
employees.
Um Our teacher compensation,
the average pay for teachers
is um nearing
$73,000
and the salary range
is just a shade under
60,000 all the way up
to 96,000. And, and
that's just teachers.
We serve 13
communities um
which uh
in Valencia County, there's
about 46,600
people. Um Of
that number
12,483
are under 18
and 66% of
those are enrolled in
Los Luna
schools.
Uh We serve 6
16% of our student
populations uh
of our student
population receives
uh special education
services. Um And if
you include um our gifted
students in that, the number goes
up to 18.6%.
Uh We are very proud of
our nutrition
department. They
cook everything, um
from scratch already, we
rely on a lot of local
produce um
for our meals. So we're
providing healthy meals
for our students. Um
We serve about
500 a little over
500,000
breakfasts uh
annually
over a million lunches
and provide about 40,000
snacks. Um The
Transportation Department,
uh because the size
of our districts, it
takes quite a bit of time
uh to get from highland meadows
out by highway six and I
40 all the way
across the river
into Meadow Lake.
And in fact, when I
first started, I rode
with our transportation
director for about six
hours. So I could check out
all of our communities and where our students
come from. And it, it does take
that long uh to make
a tour of all, uh all
of our communities. Um But
we serve 3900
students a day. Uh with
transportation, we have
60 daily bus
routes. Um
We travel about
4900 miles per
day, which we're nearing
a million miles in
a year and uh
48%
of our students
um or
benefit from
transportation
um, while we are on transportation.
And before I mov'e on, I would like to
point out that last school
year, uh, we had to
mov'e $1.2
million out of
operational to cover transportation
costs, which I think
is a
common theme
for a lot of districts especially
um, districts like Los
Luas that are more rural.
Um This year, we're estimating
1.5 million, uh
coming from our operational budget
to, to cover our transportation
costs.
You can't see the data because my
slides got
a little bit, um,
goofy. But in terms
of proficiencies, we
are um
above the
statewide averages
in every category with the exception
of science
and our six year
graduation rate, which is
just a, a shade below
the statewide average. So
we recognize that we have
some work to do and
we are actively
um in involved
in programs to
um raise student
achievement. Um When
you look at the New Mexico
Vistas um
site, you will see
that um our traditional
schools uh include
Desert View Elementary,
Raymond Gobal, Doone, Peralta,
Los Luis middle school,
Valencia, middle school,
Los Luna High School and Valencia High
School. Our
schools performing
um in the next
15%. So those that
are not the top 10%
are and considered spotlight
are Bosky Farms. Uh
Kathryn Gallegos Elementary
and Sundance Elementary.
Um We have some schools that
have additional targeted support
and those um are
schools with a student
group performing in
the lowest 5%. And
so we, as we work
um on planning
professional development
curriculum uh and
program, uh we
work towards
getting those schools out of that
A T si uh
designation. So those would
be an parish uh
Toma
Elementary school and Valencia
elementary school.
Um We have one school
um that
is in MRI
status, that is our alternative high
school. They have not
been able to mov'e out of C SI in
three years. Um But this
year I am very proud
to report we have 80
graduates from
our alternative high school, which
is more than we've we've ever
had. So that staff and
principal are working very
hard um to get those
kids uh their
diplomas. Um We
have three schools,
two schools uh in
comprehensive um
C SI Los Lunas
elementary School
and uh Los
Lunas family school. Just
so just a little um
data
snapshot.
Our budget for the 2425
school year has been our
biggest challenge. It is due
on May 29th
and as we have had many
work sessions and
board meetings with our Board of
Education, we have worked
on cutting
uh to get
to a number
um that we feel
is sustainable uh for
the future
while we experienced an
increase in the initial
unit value for next year,
uh from this year's final
unit value, the increase is
small and, and quite
honestly, uh not
enough to cover all of our
expenditures.
We have experienced a a
decrease in enrollment
between the
2019 20
school year and the
2324 school
year, we've seen uh a
decline of
3.6%.
But I would like to
say there is good news
that we have seen a very slight
increase in enrollment uh
since that time. So coming
out of COVID, uh we're
seeing very
small, less than a percent increase,
but it is an increase and
we're projecting an
11.1%
increase by the
2930 school
year. So that would
be uh specifically
at our elementary schools. And
so that would be
4100,
4200 students to about
4600 students.
Um This is all due to new
construction. There is a lot
of construction happening in Los
Lunas. Um And
so we anticipate more
families um
moving in
currently
with construction
families within the district are
moving around, but we
are anticipating um
as more housing becomes
available, more families
moving in and leading to an
increase in enrollment
in the next seven or eight
years.
We've also seen a slight decline
in our TC I due to
veteran teachers leaving the
profession, uh and
their replacements being brand new
level one teachers.
Um in addition, with
3% salary
increases, which um
everyone appreciates
property liability insurance
increase. Um
of nearly
29%
medical and dental
increases. We
estimate an additional expense
of over $5
million.
This current school year,
we were able to
have what we called
all Learner days in
which those days
double counted for student
attendance days and staff
professional development days.
Uh but moving forward, we're
unable to include those.
And so that's about another
$2 million
that we
will not be able to expect in
next year's budget.
So in addition to all of
these things, the esser cliff
is a real thing and
we, with the expiration
of Esser funds,
we evaluated
positions and programs
but still need to mov'e some
positions and programs
that were previously paid
for uh with esser
funds to
the operational budget.
And so that is
adding an additional
$582,000
roughly uh to the
operational
budget
when we total our estimated
operational revenue and
subtract our estimated
expenses, we're
estimating a
$9.6
million shortfall
that will have to be covered by
cash reserves.
Given that large shortfall,
we continue to work on
trimming the budget
where we can, but the only
place to make significant
impact is in
cutting positions.
And that is something that
we really do not want to do, we
would like to not have a reduction
in force. So we
are actively working
hard uh
on other measures
to reduce that
shortfall. Uh
Number one, so we don't have to cut into
cash reserves so much. But number
two, so we do not have to have a
reduction in force.
Um Some of those measures are not
filling current vacancies
and strategically moving
people uh into
positions where they can best serve
students.
Um We have moved
some assistant principals
into principal ships as
we've had some principals retire
and or leave the district
and in doing so, we are not filling
those assistant principal
positions. So we
will start next school year
with uh some elementary
schools with
no assistant principal.
Um We have also
looked at um other
departments and where they have
vacancies such as
maintenance um
and with our Sr Os.
So we are taking every
precaution to
ensure we don't
have to have a reduction in
force. Um But
to really cut into
that
um
shortfall, it's
people,
88% of our
budget is wrapped up in
salaries and benefits. And
if you want to make AAA
Dent uh
in reducing um
a shortfall, it has to be
people. Um But again,
we are committed to not
to that not happening.
Um This was just a slide
with a breakdown of our expenditures
by function. Um
56.4%
of our operational budget is
in direct instruction.
Um And I believe
we actually, this is
a few days old. Um,
my chief finance
officer has made
some other shifts and moves and
we're, we've neared, we're nearing
60% on direct instruction
now.
So again,
um,
we have eliminated
several positions, Director
of Education, Technology,
director of language innovations,
director of personnel
positions. We've
shifted people around
into different funds.
Uh, specifically
15 eas
are being moved from operational
to DB and Medicaid.
Uh We're not filling those five
vacant assistant principal
positions. We are cutting
out of town, professional development
travel. We
are removing school
supplies in Los Luni.
We started purchasing
school supplies for all
students so that, that burden
was not on uh
families
and we are able to do
that again this coming
school year, but we
did not budget it
into next year's budget for
2526.
Um We are not filling a vacant
SRO position. Uh
We are strategically
using our remainer remaining
sr funds that run out
at the end of September.
Um And then we are reviewing
the cost of takeho vehicles.
We've also had to cut
um in other areas
such as um legal
fees, office supplies and
materials for all departments
and our annual inventory.
And we are reducing our budgeted
amounts into
emergency reserves by
$560,000.
And so we
are working hard
and, and looking at
every line in the budget to
make sure that
we are serving our students and
being fiscally
responsible.
Now, some positive
news,
three things that I really wanted
to highlight today is our Peralta
Elementary
construction.
We uh the new
school will consist of K
through through sixth grades as
well as an eight classroom pre
K center.
This building is being
designed with flexible
learning
construction began
in January on January
29th of this year
and it will be
ready beginning
with a 2526
school year. And at last
check, the project was
on track
and on time,
uh the remaining side
improvements will
happen after students mov'e into
the building. So this would be
um additional parking lot
spaces, um additional
playground spaces, um
other fencing things
that um are exterior
to the actual building. Um
And inside
currently, the foundations and
concrete flat work has
been completed and steel
erection should be happening
this month. So
it will be exciting to see those
uh walls go
up.
Also coming in this
uh new year
is a strategic plan.
Um Working with an outside
group. We are nearing the
completion of the strategic
plan and we have
identified four
strategies,
first, build,
collaborative student centered
cultures,
second, build trust with families
to serve as partners and their students,
academic learning,
third to build system
strategy and capacity to
support strong
instruction and
fourth to develop strong
people systems to foster
a strong student centered
culture in Los Luna
schools. We are
entering the final phase of the
strategic plan. Where we
are developing goals
as well as metrics and milestones
to make sure that
we are able to be
number one held
accountable and to
ensure success
of the strategic
plan. The goal is
to have the strategic plan ready to
go July 1st of, of
2024 with
a roll roll out to the
community. Um In
August
finally, um
while this is not
necessarily
positive to, to
start, we did not
pass our three
mil Levy last November,
we were unsuccessful.
Um But this has
potentially devastating
consequences for Los Luna
schools. And so
we are holding a special
election um in
August which is an all male
in election as you know.
Um And so
what we are doing with
our special election
campaign is using
a variety of methods to
reach people including
vid video messages and
commercials. Uh Our
district website, social
media, digital newsletters
and print media like
postcards. Um
I wanted to share a commercial
that we are running um today.
However, the link uh was
not working when I sent it.
Um But um it
will be on our website soon
and it is currently running on Krqe
channel 13. We
um wanted to highlight
the technology use in our
classroom. And so the commercial
is all about
kids and then explaining
how important
technology is in their
cla in their classroom and in their
education. And
so um we
want to make sure
that we pass this uh
mill levy because really
it's, it's about our
technology, infrastructure,
uh as well as educational
technology in the classroom.
And so with that, I'm going
to turn it over to
um,
Chief Academic Officer Jessica
Montano.
>> Good morning, everybody. Thank you for
being here today. I'm,
I'm really excited to, to
do this presentation because this is,
this highlights what our students
are doing. Um
and, and that's why we're
here and to see some of the things
that our kids are doing just
brings that excitement back.
So we currently
are part of the cohort
two for the Innovation Zones
grant um
that has helped us to fund
some really exciting activities.
The first thing is that we've used that
money to um
fund 10
uh paid internships
for our students. We
had internships with
uh many partners in our
community. However,
um being able for
us to pay them and not put that
burden on our industry leaders
who sometimes have
other types of restrictions that
keep them from helping fund
internships. Um
Us being able to do that has really
helped our students to get into
some really
purposeful internships
that align with some of their
pathways in their
careers. And so the
community has been great in working
with us to, to provide those
opportunities. And like I said,
we've used the Innovation
Zones grant to be able to
fund that. So there's some of our
kiddos working in some of our
industries, health care,
automotive, and
culinary.
Another thing that we use the
Innovation Zones grant
for is to start to
build our Capstone
projects in our high school,
uh specifically loons high
schools where we use the grant money
for. Um
We
have partnered again
with community Members throughout
our community to
provide opportunities for
our students to really become
part of
creating
um problem
solving uh
and, and solutions
for our community. And so some of
our capstone projects centered
around um
are elderly in our community
working within
our, our,
our senior
citizen centers as well
as our assisted living
centers. We also had
some of our students that worked
inside of our
younger schools and Elementaries
working with literacy programs.
They, they hosted literacy nights
where they gave away books and read to
students. And then we've also
did a lot with our
um homeless community
and our poverty community
where they've done some resource
fairs. Our students
created an
opportunity for the
community to come in
and get the things
that they need. They worked with industry
partners across the community
to for donations
um for
clothing, for food,
for bare necessities
that, that, that, that our community
might need. So real
big, shout out to that. I wanna
wanna say one thing about the
Innovation Zones grant
is that we were able to
get in last year on the
second cohort and we,
we did the grant for one high
school. We were really
hoping that there would be a third
cohort so that we could include our
other two high schools in that.
Um Because we'd like to extend
this, these opportunities
to the other two high schools. So
that's one of our goals.
We also use the Innovation
Zones Grant to work on
creating um an
opportunity for our community
to work with our schools
and our students
in creating what we call a graduate
profile. Um We
did a lot of exploration this
year in discovering
what other communities
and other schools are doing for their graduate
profile. And you can see
engaging our students and exploring
what that would look like and what
are the things in their inside their
school community that they would like
to enhance
or support or
really um use
as a launching pad
into their growth
as academics as
they mov'e forward to prepare for that
post-secondary
opportunity.
One of our other great
partners in our community and you'll get
to see that this afternoon is
we work very closely with
meta and some
highlights that we
were able to
um feature today is
they've worked closely with us with our
women in stem
and providing opportunity
for our female
students to really
look into those science and math
and technology. We
also received a couple
of grants this year from,
from meta, one is
for a maker space and
the other one was for wind
energy. So we thank
Meta for their
support.
Some of here is some of our
highlights of our CTE
programs. Um
We have
had the opportunity
to acquire
three virtual
reality um
cat simulators
and we have one in each of our
high schools. Uh We work
very closely with
uh the CC
um industry so
that students can
actually have
the opportunity to walk out
of high school with a certification
to be able to run
three separate types of
equipment and excavator,
a backhoe and a front
loader. Um And so
working, working as
we, we, we brought these into the school
and we've had an opportunity to really
get into the curriculum that is
provided from cat
and it's, it's very,
very intense.
Um But once our students go
through that, it's, it's a certification
that's industry recognized and it's an
opportunity that I don't
think most students have
um to actually have
an to be in the
machine and to actually learn
what that machine is about. So
when they do get into
the workforce,
they have, they have that experience that
they can carry out.
We've done a lot in the
last couple of years to bring
our CTE teachers from across
the district to work together
and communities of practice,
they've been able to meet anywhere
between three and four times
a year. Um And that's
really built our programs
for them to be able to have that
time together to
collaborate. Um
and, and work
towards goals the best for our
students. We
also do a lot with virtual
reality in our middle schools.
And one of the things
that we're fortunate to have
is transfer
VR and this
is an opportunity for students, students
to virtually explore
careers. So for
an example, a student might be
able to get
into the automotive world
and see how to change oil
in a car, or they might
be able to get into the health fields
and learn how to draw blood.
And so they do this virtually.
And it's a low risk
environment for our students. It's
a great opportunity for them to
explore. And then
when they get into high school, they're able to
choose different CTE classes
that they might not have chosen
before that experience.
We've also worked with industry
leaders in our, in our
community. Um I
don't know if you're aware of. There's
a project nationwide
called Grit to Greatness
and what it is is it's um
construction industries
primarily in our
community that
um come in and they speak
to students about their
trade and about
what their careers
opportunities are in
their fields. And
so, um back in
December, we visited
with community industry
leaders, we visited
every third grade class
and there's a book that we
were able to purchase for all of our
third grade students as they went
off to Christmas break.
Um and it's, and it's a
journey of moving
students through the trades and
it, it's, it's a cute, it's a cute
book, but it really does, does
describe the different types of
trades that are out there and to
have trades, people
come in and read with our students
was really powerful. Um
And then we've also been able
to have trade
fairs um at our high
schools that we bring in our
community as
well.
>> Good morning, everybody. My name is
Susan Chavis and
MS Montagna and I are both
graduates of Liina High School.
We're proud products of Liina
schools and we are very
proud to be with the district.
We both have dedicated our entire careers
to Liina schools. I'm in my 23rd
year and year in
year 24th
year. So we are very happy
to be here and very proud
of our district and have seen
a lot of growth in our
our lifetime here in Lunas
as native
residents of this community.
So I will be speaking about
educational technology
and informational
technology. Our
journey with
educational technology has
has been very prosperous.
We began our journey many,
many years ago and
we received a
a really
great leap with our journey. In
2014.
Wilson of schools was
three of 119
schools across the nation
that received Apple connect
ed grants. So three
of our schools, our elementary
schools were outfitted with
devices, 1 to 1 devices,
ipads for the
students, ipads and
macbooks for the teachers and
Apple came to listen
to schools and provided professional
development for all of our
students or all of our teachers
at those schools.
They were also
outfitted with wi Fi
and really supported us with
learning how to use those
devices. We
quickly learned that it wasn't
going to be sufficient for
our sixth graders who are going to middle
school to have these devices
and be an educational technology
rich environment and
then mov'e into middle schools without
the devices. So the
roll-out to middle schools
happened with ipads and actually,
MS Montano was an administrator
at one of our middle schools at the time
and was very
instrumental in helping
the roll out, help them.
Shortly after that, we soon
realized that we can't stop
at the middle schools, we have to mov'e on to the high
schools. So all of our
high school students then
all received Apple
Macbook Airs, which
was amazing at the time.
And that was at the uh we
purchased the Macbooks, I believe
at the 16 during the
1617 school year.
And we wanted
to make sure that our teachers had
those devices in hand
at least a year before the students
did. So that way our teachers
can learn how to use those devices. So
they were learning how to
use the device because not
everybody's an Apple user.
It was, it's a change for many
people. It's a different operating system.
So we wanted to ensure that our teachers
had enough time to
really learn how to use the devices
before the students had
those devices in their hands.
So by the 1920
school year and we all know
what happened. In 1920
our students had Macbooks
and our, so we
had three elementary schools that had
ipads. We had our middle schools
have ipads and we had our
high schools that had Macbook
errors. The pandemic
hit in March of
20
all of our
students because
of the Apple Connected
Grant and because
of planning by
many Members of our district
team, all of our
students had devices within
the first few weeks when the pandemic
hit. So we
were very fortunate to have
all of that in place
and it started
back with our partnership in
2014 with the grant.
Little. Do we know that we would
be prepared for a global
pandemic in 2020
by receiving those
grants
in addition to that, and you see in our
pictures on the top,
I guess top left
hand corner, those are our digital learning
coaches. They are very
instrumental in supporting
educational technology in the
classroom. This past
spring, we hosted a
film festival. It
was our third film festival.
If you ever have an opportunity to
come and see the showcase that night,
it is quite a treat.
We have our kindergartner
who are showing off their
filmography skills to
our seniors who are
ready to go work for Netflix
with all the skills that they have
learned to. The
right of that picture are,
are schools that are
recipients of Apple distinguished
schools. We are the only
three, there's three schools
in Louna
schools that are
Apple Distinguished and we are the
only ones in New Mexico that have
that distinction.
We also have three Apple
Distinguished educators. It's
a rigorous process. They
apply throughout the country
to be recognized with this
distinction and they are
able to support
us with their Apple
knowledge.
Many of our teachers are Apple
learning coaches and
many of us are all Apple
certified teachers. So
this all supports the use
of using Apple devices.
It's really unique to walk into
many of our classrooms because our
students and our teachers are leaning side
by side how to use all of
the apps on their
devices. We
also really
wanted to
prepare our students for a
world outside of Apple. We
know not everybody uses Apple.
So we do use Google
Suite in our in our
classrooms as well. So they
have the opportunity to learn both,
both type of operating
systems. We
are also like MS Montano said,
very big with our virtual reality.
It's very exciting to walk into
our classrooms and see our students with
their VR headsets and they're looking
up and just in a whole different
world, they could be in Paris in the
Louver, they could be
in Australia, they
could be anywhere across the
world with their devices.
So that's really exciting.
We know that we couldn't do anything
without our information
technology team to support
us. It's not just having the
teachers to teach the students to
learn the devices on
hand. We have a very
strong it
department here in Liina
Schools and that started
many, many years ago, we
knew that we needed to have the
tech or whenever
something goes wrong, who's the first person
that we call when our devices do
not work, we need our tech
supports and many of them were
here to prepare for this
today. So I do want to give them a
very big appreciative.
Thank you because they're
working on many things this week
and they were able to help lift
off what is happening
today. This
past spring, we
decided to
use a large portion
of the remaining of our sers funds
to implement our
interactive flat panels. And I'm looking around the
room because there's not one in here. There,
there was one in here.
Every classroom now
has brand new interactive
flat panels to replace the
smartboards and there's not
smartboards in here, but
our smartboards became very
antiquated looking
at our projectors and how much
it costs to replace the light bulbs and
projectors. It was a
reoccurring cost. So
we decided to mov'e
forward and have State of the art
technology. So if you look at the picture
on the top left hand corner,
that is one of our students using our
new interactive flat
panels and to walk into
the classrooms and to see
the students use the IFPS
is is really
exciting. Many of our
students who could not hear
before when things were being
presented because of
hearing difficulties or
challenges they can now
hear in the classroom. Many of our
students who cannot see the board,
they can now see the board because
the screens are huge, they're 86
inches. So
it's quite, quite exciting.
In addition, we talked about our ipads
and macbooks and of
course, none of this could happen
without our network operations
if our servers down.
That's a very exciting and
challenging day for us in the city
schools because so many
of us are on our network
throughout the day, whether it's the
use of canvas, whether
it's through our emails,
through instructions that that is
occurring. So
network operations and
making sure that our wi fi is
fast and
accessible is crucial
to us in the schools.
And then finally, I know that we spoke
about the three mil funding, but that
is truly something that will
support the continued
growth of technology
in Liina schools.
>> I I would like to add when
talking about um
our Macbooks, we
offer a buy out
program to our seniors after
they graduate at a very minimal
cost last year. I believe we
seniors purchase
those for, I >> think they're
$25 >> $25.
So, so they, they leave
lo in the schools with the
Macbook that they've used
since freshman year,
but they have a computer that they can take
with them into
colledge or
career or whatever they
do post secondary life.
Um And I think that's
fantastic as a
dad who had to buy
my child a computer
for colledge. >> And I think with the buy
out program, our students take
better care of their devices because
they know that they can have the opportunity
to buy them when they leave.
So it's an incentive for our
students and
their parents.
>> Finally, I wanted to
mention school safety.
Um We take school safety
very seriously. Uh And
I, I do believe
that if we don't have a safe
and secure environment, students
can't learn. And so
we are
proud of our school safety
measures. Uh We believe
that we are cutting edge and
leading in, in many
ways in New Mexico.
Uh but that's
not a good enough
for us. We
really want to continue
to grow and implement new
technologies and best practices
in school safety. And so
we're always looking to the
future and what we can do
better. Um Currently,
we have 20 armed
SRO officers
that's two at each high
school, uh one at
all of the other schools
and um a rover.
Um We have
10 security guards,
those are 10 campus security
officers. Um We
have a strong positive
relationship with Los
Luas Police Department in
Valencia County Sheriff's
Office. Um
We have the protecting
and preserving our future group
which meets um a few
times a year to just
discuss um
safety precautions
and how we can
work together with.
Um not only the police departments
but also our fire departments
and, and other
groups. Um
Our schools have secure
vestibules, um
camera systems.
Um and we take part
in the Rave Panic
App as well as the Stop
It
App.
And with that, we are
open for questions.
>> Thank you very much, appreciate it. And
so if people have questions,
please get my attention and I'll put you
on the list first. We have
Representative Garrett.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for a great
presentation. I'm ready
to go back to work. I'm a
retired teacher.
Um I'm gonna kind of
go backwards starting
at the end. Do you put
your next step
plans? Are
they computerized
online?
>> So, actually, um we
are going to be starting to do that
starting with this year's eighth
graders. And um
so it'll be next year's freshman.
Uh We have purchased the
school links
um
platform and that's what we'll be using
for that. So, yes,
>> great. Thank you because Mr.
Chair hearing all your, I mean,
that's something that should be online.
So I don't know if you're the first or
the only, but thank you.
Um Oh, and I have to say
Mr. Chair, thank
you for um
lending your deputy
superintendent Brian Baca.
He is such a blessing to
this Committee.
So I have to say
that sits next to me
in all my committees.
Um OK. My next
question is on
um
you talked about
how meta based
is, is contributing
and about the importance
of Innovation Zone.
Are Amazon and Meta.
Are they involved at all
in paying for paid
internships? Is that
something that's
happening or will
happen.
>> Not currently,
it's something that we can definitely
explore. Um But
as of right now, they're, they're not,
they're not doing paid internships. They
are, we're
partnering with several
different. Oh,
Fortas, I'm so sorry, Forts.
Yes.
Do you want to continue with? What
meta has done with us are
other projects?
>> So meta is moving forward with some
internships. However, we are currently
working with Fortas who is
the construction
manager with all the
constructions occurring at
that campus. And when
you go today, you're gonna see how incredibly
large it is. So they are
providing internships in the summer
for our seniors. So
it's a uh
internship to work
program apprenticeship.
>> Thank you for that. Mr. Chair
involves the trades as
well as the tech part.
>> The tech part is still moving forward, but
the trade is definitely where the
focus is right now.
>> Uh Thank you. And
then my big question
from the beginning of the
presentation, Superintendent
Kettler is, it's
horrible that you have to do
the cash reserves.
What is responsible for these
shortfalls because we're
hearing it from all over the State
and you have really
pinpointed
the impact of key
personnel that
you can't place
or, or hire.
Um and all,
and we're not talking about a
overpacked, you know,
people will complain. Oh, there's too many
administrators. We're not talking
about that here. We're talking about
key classroom
personnel, key
people. What's responsible
for the shortfall in your
view. What can the State
do to
address that?
>> Mr. Chair Representative
Garrett? Um I believe
that with
the 3% increase
in salary, the
increases in medical
and dental insurance
and the
steep property and
liability insurance
increase. Um
The TC I was
sorry, the
initial unit value
was set too low. Um
I, I believe that
um
it had nothing to do with
the Esser cliff or the end of the
Esser funds because we cut
previously. Nice to
have programs that we
were paying for out of Esser
um and moved
just a minimal amount
of things we felt were absolutely
necessary uh and
operational. So,
um I think
the 3% salary increase was
is amazing. Um
And but coupled
with the other increases
and the the initial
unit value being set where it
was it was
it's leading to our
issues. >> Thank
you for that explanation.
And as you know, the Secretary
is next.
So thank you very
much. That's my questions.
Thank you, Representative Garrett, uh
>> Representative
Baca.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and >> actually get
to question >> your boss on this.
Is that
what's?
Yeah, I will be very
kind unlike
other times. Um Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you
panel,
um
Doctor Kettler on top of
other measures and thank you for
your thorough and concise
presentation. We appreciate
that. Um
When we talked about budget shortfall,
you, you had a slide there. But
what other measures are being
considered to meet
the, the deficit, your
budget
shortfalls.
>> Mr. Chair Representative
Baca, we um,
have gone
through the budget to
reduce
um, line
items, supplies.
Um We're looking at,
um, takeho vehicles.
Our Sr Os currently are
on call, um, 24
hours a day, um, and
take their vehicles home because they
May be called out in the middle of the night.
Um, but we're looking at
eliminating that and having
them leave their vehicles
at a central location.
Um, we are limiting
takeho vehicles to
essential personnel,
um, in maintenance who
May be called out in the middle of the night
for a water leak or,
or anything like that.
Um,
we are, I
think I mentioned cutting
out of town travel for professional
development.
Um,
we are
eliminating vacant
positions and
moving people around
into schools. Um,
we have looked at cutting
our academic coaches
which, um, none
of us want to do because they are
extremely valuable in our schools
and the coaching cycles
with teachers. And
so, um, there
are a lot of,
a lot of things that, uh, we
have looked at and
continue to look at our, our budget
is not due until the 29th.
And so we've got,
um, a little bit of time
still about another week
and nothing is off
the table. And that, that
unfortunately includes
people. >> Thank
you Mr. Chairman to follow up to that.
Other districts have reached out
to me and they have talked about the possibility
of cons or consideration of closing
schools in order to
make, make to meet
budget. Is that something
that you've heard? Not only
here but from other of your
colleagues across the
State?
>> Uh Mr. Chair and
Representative Bakki, yes.
Um Thank you
for reminding
me, we are
considering closing one
of our elementary schools. In fact,
that is a topic of
discussion at our board meeting on
Tuesday night. Um
One of our older elementary
schools will be discussed
on uh closing
that school reallocating
um that staff to other
places and moving
students um into other
elementary schools. Um
In addition, our
alternative high school is
on uh an older
campus that needs lots of
renovations. And
so, um while
it has not expressly
been said, um
in public, I know there have been
discussions about that possibly
being the next school
that um
gets closed, but
the program itself would just get
moved on to one of our
other high school
campuses.
>> And thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you, uh Superintendent
Kettler. Um,
when we talk about this
and we talk about the State, we're
talking about how does it impact
kids? I mean, when we sit up here, this
group as educators,
um it
really is, how does this impact
our schools and our kids because it's
not just the kids in Las Unas, it's
all kids. When I sit in the seat
here, I have to
consider and think about the
kids in the northwest, the
southeast and the metro.
So um
that is a concern because we're sitting
like in when we had the
economic downturn in 2008
9, this whole
State
was in a was in quite
a, a difficult economic
situation. Now,
our State is sitting on a $3.5
billion plus and the fact
that we're having to look
at making drastic cuts
in order to make a budget
is somewhat concerning to
me, uh Mr. Chairman,
my follow up is
um
teacher is it has teacher
recruitment and filling up positions been
a problem for law sona schools
like it has for others. And that
could include teachers,
administrators, bus drivers,
cafeteria workers,
educational assistants.
Um has that
been
somewhat
problematic?
>> Uh Mr. Chairman Representative
bucket it, it has been
somewhat problematic.
Um Bus drivers are
always in short supply
and as um
every district knows
you have to
increase your salaries
of your bus drivers to be competitive
especially in the metro
area. Um
Special education teachers
are in short supply
and uh have been
difficult uh to
recruit and hire. Um We
spend a lot of time
going to career fairs.
Our chief personnel officer
um Andrew Seiss
and his team
go to all of our universities.
We are
um in
agreements with all the major universities
for student teachers who once we
get those student teachers in, we do not
let leave. Um
We have ed fellows
and um so we're
taking all the steps to
ensure that we um
are able to hire
individuals, um,
more specifically trying to
hire high-quality individuals.
We grow our own. Uh
We have a very good, grow your own
program. And
um, so
the impact is
still there how,
um, however, we are
working hard to
minimize that impact
as much as possible.
>> And thank you, Mr. Chairman and it
was communicated earlier
that Launa schools
is the largest employee in the county.
So when we're talking about
some of the potential for
some of our reduction in
force layovers, that
is that is May
impact directly our community
right here. Our, our,
our families, our folks
that go to school here and again,
what it could actually be, Mr. Chairman
is a com a compounding
effect is we May be
losing even more students and
staff to other places
right now in a
situation where we have a teacher
shortage. If we don't have
jobs statewide,
we May lose even more of
those valuable teachers
ancillary, support
staff uh
that are
necessary
every position is necessary to,
to uh support
our schools and our communities.
Mr. Chairman, my final question
to you, Doctor
Kaylor or the panel. Ok. And
this came up yesterday, I'm gonna ask
it, is that part
of the work that this group does?
Is it makes recommendations on the
budget. One of our work
plans is going to be the
State equalization
guarantee, ok.
This is going to be something that we're gonna
be taking a look at.
So, uh Mr. Chairman and
superintendent,
what is it that you need? You
know, many times we make the mistake that
we think we know here in Santa
Fe.
But what is it that we need
and should be considered
when we look in the
funding of
public schools
in New
Mexico?
>> Mr. Chairman Representative
Baca.
Um I don't know
how else to say it other than
money, which is
an, and I
apologize, it's not meant to be
funny. Um but
the increase uh
an increase in the unit
value sooner
than January. I mean,
typically the final unit value
is comes out in
January. Um but the
sooner that that is
increased because I
believe there's still almost
2%
um that was,
that's available, that was
released if I'm saying that correctly
uh to, to the public
education department. Um
I will say that if we
had not been fiscally
responsible since about the
2011
or 12 school year,
um Los Luas would
be in really bad shape and I know
for some districts
um they, they
are in worse shape than we
are because they did, they don't
have the cash reserves.
And so um that
final unit
value or increasing that unit
value now rather than later
would be extremely
helpful. I
don't
>> and, and thank you, Mr.
Chairman and, and thank you superintendent.
I guess the question is
drastic measures. May be
done a across the board
in our states to meet budget, the
requirements of submitting a
balanced budget,
which May include cutting
deep into cash reserves, which is not
sustainable, which means
that we May be looking at closures of
schools, a reduction
in force. And
the fact is that we as a
legislator as the appropriators
and lawmakers, we have
the responsibility and the duty
to make sure that we properly fund
schools. And so all
these cuts are going to be
made
just a little too late that
there May be all these actions and
then come back in
October or January. When
whenever we go back or during the
special Session, we
come in and we make the
um we make
these changes,
the damage is going to be done.
And I want our colleagues those
listening to
understand that because
we, as we said before, if
there's one thing when we can
all come around and we can all come
together on it's our
kids and our because
they are truly our future.
And so I just want to thank you, Mr.
Chairman. I want to thank you
uh Superintendent Ker and
the panel uh for your
presentation.
Thank you, Representative Baca, uh
Senator
Stewart.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and add my thanks
to your presentation
a lot going
on in Los Luna. It's
very exciting to be
right next to meta and be
able to tap into that
a little bit.
I want to mov'e away from
money. I know that's the main
discussion, but there
are a few other things
going on.
Uh I'm
uh I'm just curious
as to how you are
implementing structured
literacy. Uh
If you've chosen
a different reading program
for this next school year
and what that might be
um if you've gotten
all your elementary teachers
trained and how you're doing on
your administrators,
um that really need to start
to understand what
we need to change with.
Reading.
>> Chairman Representative. Thank
you. Um We are
currently using
Hegerty as our structured
leaders literacy program.
Um We have done an
amazing job this year.
Um Actually over the last two
years of partnering with our
daycares um
and our Pre K programs that are New
Mexico, pre K outside
of um our school
district. And we
have um
I believe we have
certified
pre K teachers
and daycare
teachers um
in 10 different
daycares um on
the Haggerty program.
So that's what we're doing
to prepare our kids once they come
into our schools.
Um As of
yesterday, I believe we
had two and they were new
teachers to our district that
needed to get certified
in our letters program or
the state's letters program. So we,
we're almost at 100% with
our letters, which
is a huge,
huge accomplishment
because that is a, a very
lengthy program and,
and that certification takes quite
a bit of time from our teachers and our
administrators. Um
We also have
amplify that we're using for
EL A which is kindergarten
through eighth grade.
Um And this is our second
year with amplify
um very
rigorous and in in depth
program, which is a little
bit different than what we were moving
from, from our journeys.
Um So that has been a
learning curve for our teachers and
for our students, but we're
starting to see some growth in our
reading um with
our moy data that
we, that we were able to pull from
January, we're starting to see some growth
in our reading. So it,
it's been, it's been successful
to implement that
program.
>> Uh Well, thank you for that,
Mr. Chairman. I,
I think I, I came
down and uh observed
one of your elementary schools
with the
governor's uh staff
person, Mariana
UMA
and I, I saw them
use Hegarty. It was
really great. This is a pre
K program
so that Hegarty
that is an amazing
model, but
it takes a lot of
training to be able to
do that easily
rather than looking at
the book all the time. She
was doing it very easily.
So, um, well,
so that's great. We
should, we should really
start
seeing pretty
significant
changes. Uh
Just this year
we had saw an increase
in reading proficiency
for native American students at
5%
which, you know, anybody that
knows, uh, education
and assessments and
changes. That's
stunning 4%
statewide. Uh,
so we should start
seeing those numbers
continue to
increase,
uh, with the
elementary third
grade testing.
Uh So thank you so
much for doing that.
And um so
anything else you need
with that early
literacy issue? We did,
we do have money in the SCG,
but you know, that's what we're
all murmuring about
today is it wasn't enough
probably in
any area. Uh
So are you
missing
things for, to
fully implement structured
literacy at your elementary?
>> Absolutely. And again, it's
money.
Um are we are
at the um
sunset of our CLSD
grant. Um And so
we have one more year and we're, we're
just using up as much funds
as we can. Um I
believe our, our funds are
out June 30th. So
that would be, you know, I, I'm
hoping that they're looking
at some other literacy
grants or to continue that
CLSD grant to make it a
second waves
that, that would be
super helpful because that is
the fund that we do use
for that program for our literacy
programs.
>> So that's the federal grant
through it. Is it
right? So, I mean, I think
there will be more money, Mr.
Chairman through the
Feds also.
But um
we we should be,
we should be
as a State
putting in the funds to
take over those federal
funds. So thank you.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you, Senator. Other
questions from the Committee.
Sarah Lopez.
>> Ok.
Thank you, Miss. No, you can hear
me. Yes, thank you, Mr.
Chair. Um I appreciate
the information that you have shared
and just wanted to a
sideline is to say Ann
Parish has always been near and
dear for me. Um
When I was working with the YWC
a many years ago, we used to have a
program. Um So
I'm very familiar with
um the
community itself.
Um and I'm, I'm
hoping that
the school is still doing
well and of
course, within the community itself.
I know there's always other issues that
affect that
particular neighborhood as I
call. But um
I just Ann Parish
always has a soft spot for
me. >> Thank you,
Mr. Chair,
Senator Ann Parish is
actually one of the schools that received
the Apple Connected school
grant back in
2014. And so
they are an Apple Distinguished school as
well. And we're seeing amazing
growth at that
school.
>> And speaking of uh Mr.
Chair, Senator of Ann
Parish, um we are
going um out for
design funding uh to
rebuild that school uh
in the coming year. So I believe
we are on the agenda for June.
Um but I wanted to
add at Ann Parish. Um I'm
really excited that
um the principal was able
to um
offer uh Orton
Gillingham strategies um
specifically at that school.
And I've seen some amazing
growth in, in that
particular school in those
students which I know I've
talked um
with
uh
Jessica about
uh expanding and,
and as well as Susan about
expanding Orton Gillingham,
uh district wide.
Um But again, Orton Gillingham
is very expensive
and, uh, funding is
always a, a
consideration.
>> Thank you, Senator. A
couple of questions
or, or kind of
concerns.
It's very frustrating to me
when New Mexico is a wealthy
State and we hear
regularly from our districts
that there are financial
and money problems
and we hear from our finance
people. Oh, money, money
doesn't solve all the problems.
It sounds like it does.
Um, how do we
go about,
you know, fixing those problems?
And let me give a little
context the last year or
so. We tried, I
was trying to put $200
million un,
uh, unaccounted
for not unaccounted for,
um, un
uh,
un mandated into the
seg for districts to
use on the projects they
need.
It got cut down to 30
million and we're not
and a lot of that still came with
strings.
You know, I hear now as we're
talking about the Esser cliff,
you know, how do we make the
Esser cliff?
We've got money. We could fund it
out of State funds or at least make
it a general slide instead of a
cliff, any
ideas as to
how you would spend money
if we didn't mandate how
you had to spend it? Uh
Certainly sounds like some personnel
things, but you know, if money were
not an object, how much do
you need and what would you use it
for
>> Mr. Chairman? Um
I, I do want to
acknowledge that the most
um I believe the most
important person in a
student's growth and development
and achievement is that that
pers the teacher that
human in the classroom.
Um but with that comes
training, professional
development um so
that they um are able
to deliver a high quality
education. Um and a
lot of that is centered around
high quality educational
materials. And
um with
that again, um comes
training and so
um I guess
to answer your question and I
hope, hope, hope this does answer
your question. Um If
money was no
object, um
we would be spending
a lot more time um
with our teachers in
coaching and feedback
cycles, uh professional
development and training um
specific to the high quality
instructional materials.
Um And our
administrators
would, we would have
enough administrators to
cover not just the
management side of that job
but to be the actual instructional
leaders in the building
in those classrooms um day
in and day out
to in with feedback
cycles to ensure that we are
reaching um
our, our
goals.
>> Thank you. Uh One of the
things we regularly hear from
the finance people when we've got
this largest of money
is they want to take today
money and make it tomorrow money.
So they're putting it into all these
funds. You essentially
said the same thing, but in a
different way in that
you want to take that money and
train teachers for the
future. Once teachers
are trained, you can't take that training
away. It's forever training.
It's forever money that's
invested into a good
future now. And
so again,
it, it's very frustrating to me
when I, we hear from
districts
that
lots of the problems they
face in personnel,
in providing good
education, all
go back to having enough
money. We
shouldn't be trying to do education
on the cheap in a State that
is as wealthy as New Mexico
is. And we allow
kid 50% of our Children
to live in poverty and, and we
allow that to happen,
you know, and so I, you know, anybody
who's listening, I hope, you know, we kind
of really start pushing that.
New Mexico's got the money
to do a plus education,
not mediocre education
or trying to do it on the cheap.
So, thank
you. Any other
comments?
Thank you so much for your time
this morning. Great district.
Thank you for the hospitality and
breakfast. Very much.
Appreciate all of
that. Um With
that, I believe we're going to
transition over to
Secretary Arsenio
Romero, Doctor Romeo.
Um This might be a good time,
quick bathroom break,
anybody and we'll get started
in five minutes or so.
Thank
you.
Good morning Secretary
and uh welcome to Les C
here in Las Lunas
and I've got some
notes here. Uh
You were asked to present, it looks
like on hopes for the coming
school year ideas for partnership
during the interim.
Uh an update
on the 180 day rule,
an update on accountability issues
with P and certainly
uh people are interested
in the unit value issues
with things, but with that, let me
turn it over to you and your
team.
>> Well, thank you, Mr. Chair.
Ok. I want to make sure I have the, the
mic on. Thank you for having me
here today, everyone. It's wonderful
to see you. Uh It is
great to be kind of back in my
own old stomping grounds here. And
so, uh just to be back in this
room and see some uh some
individuals that I got to work with over the
last few years. Uh Las
Luna is a wonderful district and
community and uh
they're continued to, to
do innovative things
uh in this district, but
something that we can definitely
emulate across the across
the State of New Mexico.
Um I also had the opportunity
uh a few a couple of days
ago to participate
as a keynote speaker in the Belen
High school graduation where I got to see
Representative Moya there and it was great
to be able to see her
along. Of course, just to
a reminder that's where I grew up.
So I, I graduated on
that same football field
uh in 1992.
And so I got to graduate
or, or congratulate
the graduates of 20
for it was a wonderful
experience and I
just want to thank uh Blynn because I know
you were there yesterday uh
for hosting me
at graduation on the
14th. Um
So, yes,
Mr. Chair, we are here today
to be able to give you an update on some
of our projects and
priorities that we have
within the public Education department.
Um I, I know that there are some
questions and, and definitely want
to spend some time with conversation.
Um I do have with me to
my left um uh
assistant Secretary
Frostad and
director uh Lynn Vasquez,
they'll be helping us with some, some
questions and conversations
specifically around
policy and uh
uh assessment and
accountability as we mov'e
forward.
So again, thank
you for having me here today.
Uh
Excited about sharing some of
the, the work that we're doing across
the agency. Uh Just
a reminder, this is as we get
ready for our 60 day Session,
this will be the last
60 day Session with this uh
Executive leadership.
And so we're looking forward to
uh um working with you to be able to take
full advantage of
that.
Is there you
got. OK. You got the clicker. Thank
you. We'll, we'll get organized
here.
So just to start off uh for
the conversation of this morning,
I wanted to start with some of the
priorities that we continue
to still focus on around
educator recruitment and
retention, uh really
around whole student and
culturally, responsive education,
secondary education
redesign. Uh Looking forward to
some of those partnerships we have
with some key districts across New
Mexico. Of course,
literacy and math. I'll give some updates
on some of the work we're doing around those
areas. Office of Special
Education and the Executive
order, the Governor put forth with
us and the uh wonderful
progress we've made in that area.
And of course, the work we've done
uh around data systems
and uh it systems across
New Mexico and specifically
uh within the department.
These are some of the areas that we're
working on. These are what we're going to highlight
this morning.
So as we go off into
our, our first bucket
really around educator
recruitment and retention,
uh We really kind of
focus around three areas.
This is educator fellows,
clinical practices
and school leadership preparation
programs uh
really quickly. Uh We
are, I I feel
very um
optimistic and
I want to celebrate the work
that each of these programs have done.
Educator fellows in specific
has been uh outrageously
successful. I do want
to thank you all for the continued
support as we're moving from esser
funds into State funds for this next
year to do that. Right now,
we have uh a little
over 450 educator
fellows across the State of New
Mexico. Uh This
is a great opportunity because
we're able to go right into those
communities, really
recruit individuals from those
communities, hire them
as educational assistants where
they'll be able to spend
extended amounts of time
in classrooms with master
teachers. Uh They're also
able to get funding
to go to school and
uh get their teaching degree.
Uh We're also able to support
them to uh
with also pay
and support them in time to
be able to do their classwork, but
they're also hooked up with a coach
and this is uh extremely
important uh to really
see the success that they, that
we've seen them have throughout
uh their, their tenure as
an educator fellow. We've had a number
of educator fellows already
graduate the program and they're in
class. Now. What's
wonderful about this is because
we in, in the, the, the
title of this STL
is educator recruitment
and retention. What we,
we are seeing uh
that's very valuable is that
not only are we able to
hire these people as educator
fellows, but the
retain is at a
high level because these
individuals are from that community, they're
able to stay in that community for
2025 30
years. The other
statistic I want to point out to this
is we have about 20% of our
educator fellows are coming
from Tribes, Nations and
Pueblos. And uh and
so the this how important it is
to make sure that your
educators, your teachers
um look like you sound
like we talk like you. And this
is a great example of being
able to see that happen through the educator
fellows program, our
clinical practices. We've got
some wonderful um
programs within that,
uh which is paid student teaching
teacher residencies and principal
residencies. We've got some
wonderful partnerships with hired
uh institutions to make, to
make this happen.
And uh you know, I, I think
back when I was doing my student
teaching back in
1995 I
think it was, it was difficult
because uh this
was kind of like your job,
you really couldn't have another
job to do this.
Uh And it was limited
in scope, you had a semester
of student teaching. What this
has been allowed us to do through
paid student teaching teacher residencies
and principal residencies is
provide extended amounts of
time in those um
experiences to make them
much more prepared in both
being a teacher and a
principal.
But it also allows for them to
be able to get uh some funding
for that, which has been a
barrier from, for some
students to get into the, into the
teaching or principal
fields. And the last
thing to highlight here is the school
leadership preparation programs
uh again, uh moving
from the classroom into taking
over a school can be quite
a shift. And so
this allows for us to be
able to work with those
um up and coming leaders
to make sure that they have the skills
necessary. So when they
take over a school, they are
much better prepared and are able to
stay in that and be much more
successful.
Next slide is around whole student and
cultural responsive education.
Uh Yesterday, you had a
presentation on youth
suicide prevention,
uh Doctor Seiss, uh and
AP s all shared statistics
around how important this
is and that we pay
attention to this issue and I couldn't
agree more. This
year. Public education
department is using 6 million
a $6 million appropriation
to fund many of these
uh different behavioral
health programs including
work and restorative
practices. We'd like
to ask your support in
continuing uh to
support this, these types of programs
in the upcoming sessions
uh so that we can expand and
continue to support
existing programs.
The federal funds have also been
leveraged in the past.
Uh these funds worked uh
that we've used are expiring
soon, which makes it all
the more important that we
have your support as we mov'e
forward. And of course,
the expanding opportunities project
eop which took effect
in October of 2020
recruits and retains school based
mental health providers to
serve the needs of students across
the State with a focus
on rural and
frontier communities that
have a high percentage
of at risk and vulnerable
students populations
at at risk for negative mental
health outcomes. This
year $9
million
A $9 million initiative is
funded by the US Department of
Education. The goals
of this project include increasing
numbers of quality mental health
services providers in
high need. Schools
particularly in rural and
native American
communities.
68 students have received
tuition assistance and 17
have received stipends through programs
like this. Additionally,
100 and 14 existing mental
health providers have received
salary enhancements a
as retention
incentives. Uh Again,
these are some of the highest areas we
have with vacancies
across our State. And so this is
helping support those highly qualified
people to stay in those positions.
We're also expanding
MLS S uh
Representative Baca yesterday,
you mentioned the importance of MLS
SI I very much agree.
Uh This year, we're continuing to
coach schools to make sure students
receive these services as
needed. This is another
area unfortunately, where we did
not receive the full funds
for the upcoming year. So we
are moving forward, but we will need
your support to be able to
continue to expand these programs in
years to come outside
school. Uh time. This year,
we had funding to implement
K 12 plus outside
school funding of
uh for up to six days
across many districts. This
was a big shift this year uh
for many school districts
uh as we get into next year.
Uh This is one of the things I
have been working with superintendents
on as to be able to be prepared
for the funding is
not uh there at the same
levels as we have going into the next
school year. So we're working
with those school districts as
they start to transition uh
into what outy school
time funding will look like in the
next, in the coming year. In this
coming year.
Community schools uh
there is an $8
million.08 million
dollars for this next year, which is
down for the, for the current
year from 10 million.
Uh This does mean that we're
gonna have
to have uh a uh a change in some
of our services uh with that
reduction. And so we are
working with school districts now to help
them transition and
uh support them in using some of
their, their uh
their seg funds
to be able to con continue
these programs. At the same
level. We have health
services and high quality
nutrition. Uh The Public
Education department is collecting
feedback on this role.
Uh It's required by statute
for the implementation of uh
Senate Bill four which provides
the free meals to students.
Uh John will be covering this a little
bit later today. So more information
to come on this and of
course, student attendance, this continues
to be a uh core
area of the issue we have across
New Mexico no matter where you're
at. Uh again,
we use funds this
year uh to really
support uh many districts
across the State uh in
innovative and competitive
programs. Uh media
campaign is currently
underway. I
do want to thank you all for the support
for the $5 million for the upcoming
years. We are uh
in the, in, in the
planning stages. Now about how we
will continue to support this,
we're really looking forward. Uh I've
had some wonderful conversations
with uh superintendent
Gabriella Blake and AP
s about how we can
use these funds. And I'm, I'm really getting
some great feedback from her.
Um And AP s about
how we can most efficiently
use these kinds of funds.
Uh Of course, uh with
Bilingual Multi Multicultural
Education Act, uh The
Public Education Department
has met with Representative
Guolla and we've had
some really wonderful internal
conversations about how
we're going to continue to implement for
next year. So look
forward to uh more information on
that to
come
secondary education
redesign.
All right, good job
Greg.
Um Of
course, uh we were uh we'll
be implementing the new graduation
requirements for our new incoming
uh cohort of students.
We're excited about this. This
was heavily needed
as of the last graduation
requirements weren't updated since
2007. We're in
a much different time today. I'm,
I'm very optimistic and excited
about the progress moving forward.
And then of course, uh I've been working
with school districts to give us
feedback because
I believe it's already time
to have start having conversations
about the next iteration of graduate
graduation requirements will
be in the next few
years. Uh
PED has been working on the
implementation of House Bill
171 high school
graduation requirements.
Uh This is including
existing updates in existing
rulemaking such as the
repeal of the demonstration
of competencies. Uh
excited about the continued
work moving forward with uh
with CTE programs across the
State of New Mexico Innovation
Zones and work based learning.
These are all highly successful
programs and the only thing I
can say based on the conversation
you had with Las Unes officials
earlier is the more money
we have, we will put that to good use.
So any support in that,
we will make sure that those programs
continue to flourish and
grow
literacy and math.
Uh Again, we
are excited about the
upcoming summer for our
summer literacy programming.
Uh Again, this is
our efforts and I want to
thank you for the support in doing
this, the $30
million support
to make sure that we can, we can work
with 10,000 students this
summer. Uh We have been
hard at work. We have
contractors in place.
Uh We are continuing
to recruit students
and instructors for these
programs. We're also
working with uh both
leas uh
charters out of school time
providers, municipalities,
counties, uh uh
private providers
for daycare to be able to be
host sites for these programs.
Uh this summer right now,
we're right around 5000
students that have been enrolled in the
program and we're about 1000
instructors enrolled. So we
haven't got to our goals
yet. Uh This is a,
an ask, I have to go
back to you all um to
please go back in your
communities and support
uh the summer literacy
program if you can
help us with getting just uh
to push along the message
of how we hire
and get instructors in
place um and continue
to enroll students in your
communities. Uh Again,
this will be a highly
valuable uh resource
for students. Uh We're
gonna be working in a 1 to 4
setting this summer in 4
to 6 week programs. We've
been able to work specifically with
local communities so we can customize
uh those programs to meet their
needs. Um We're
also building in a bieg
programming and
uh language programming into the
summer programs which I'm very excited
about. We've had some wonderful, wonderful
conversations with me.
Many of our pueblos that we can
continue to do that work.
Uh Looking forward to uh
the, the data that will come
out of this. We will be
given a pre and post
assessment so we can measure the short
term gains that will be
happening this summer.
We're also gonna be
working to do some
long term studies
so we can follow these students over
the next three years to see how
uh this will be
benefit them and impact
them in a positive way
for math. We are
continuing to work with our micro
credentials. The public
education department is
developing an online PD
opportunities for teachers
to improve their math instruction.
This is gonna be an area where I I
will be asking for
additional support as
we mov'e into the years ahead.
Uh This is one of the areas that we
were not funded this year
uh to be able to do math and stem
projects. And so
uh in a later slide, I'll talk a little bit
more about the the the work
ahead of us to be able to continue
this work. Also
algebra and math pathways. The
public education department is
developing a new scope
and sequence for algebra two
really to modernize the course
and align it with the
SAT
Special Education. Very
excited about the work
around the Office of Special
Education. Uh I do
want to thank our Governor
for uh for the
Executive order to, to establish
this uh opportunity.
We are moving
fast and strong.
I do want to give a
huge shout out to
Doctor Cage and her team.
They are also working closely
with us in the public education
department with but also with higher
education and E ce
CD to improve services
across New Mexico uh
for students with disabilities,
we have really changed our
focus where we are
not leading from Santa Fe.
We are heavy in uh
working within communities.
In fact, that team right
now as we speak is working
within communities to be able to help
meet their specific needs.
And uh we have gotten some
really wonderful feedback,
not only from schools
and school districts, but also from
parents through the parent
academies that we have. This
is a team effort and we want to
make sure that everybody involved
when it comes to the education of
a student with an IAP,
all have the tools they need to be able
to make the best decisions.
We uh soon we will be
uh be able to share with you some
updates around a unified
IEP system which I'm very
excited about. If
you are a teacher, you know that when
you get a new student in the school.
Um and that student has an
IEP. Well, it's great
if you get that IAP on day one,
sometimes it takes a week,
sometimes it takes a month.
Sadly, sometimes it takes
six months to be able to get that IAP
in, this is gonna be able to
very much fast track
that. But also make sure that
across New Mexico,
we have a high quality
IAP process in
place. So that's not just
the, uh, you know, the paperwork
uh which will be beneficial
that we have a standardized system, but
it's also the process itself.
What are the iaeps look like?
Who's involved in the conversation?
Making sure everybody is aware of
what the roles are in that IAP
process. What
does it look like after the IP
process is, is signed,
completed and implemented
uh to where we look at uh
updated goals and what the
year evaluations are gonna look like. So,
very excited about that.
Again, we're continuing to
provide regional support.
Um Also another area is
around the salary differentials.
So I do want to thank you for the
$15 million over the last
three years to really
incentivize individuals
to work with students with disabilities.
Uh Again, we have, we're always
hovering around 750
or so vacancies
um in classrooms with
qualified teachers, the
highest percentage of that is going to
be around special education
teachers. What we know
is that many of these uh
special education teachers,
uh they're actually teaching but
they're in regular classrooms.
This is gonna very much help uh
incentivize them to be able to
take advantage and use their
special education license
and come back over to take
over and, and work in classrooms
with students with
IEPs
also around uh uh
braille standards. Uh
We're proposing
a rule that establishes
standards specifically designed
to support students who are
blind or visually impaired
in developing braille literacy
across all school subjects.
So more to come on this too
and looking forward to this. Uh this
uh support for students
also some programs like best
buddies UD I and Eclipse.
These are all programs that support
students with IEPs
and will continue to expand
and support school districts across New
Mexico in these types of
projects.
Do a little time
check
data systems.
Of course, these are systems
around accountability, student
information systems, data
collection and reporting systems,
Nova data
warehouses and data governance.
I have two experts in that to my
left. Uh I, I'm
looking forward to the conversation
around this. Um
We are just
uh have rolled out updated
uh supports for school
districts across New Mexico
and giving them uh the
really the newest accountability
data. It is very
important to me that
we get this right. Uh
I know as a teacher, as a
principal, as a superintendent,
I very much put
uh much value into
the data. I have to help me make decisions
about how we mov'e forward.
Uh We, we're continuing to refine
these systems. And I
do want to thank uh Lynn
Vasquez here to my left.
She is, she and her
team have worked extremely
hard to get us to where we are now.
And I am uh very
um very happy with the
progress that we've made. Um
Also, I want to thank school districts
and some of our partner school
districts in helping
us put this, put this
together so that we
are able to provide
very highly reliable
data for school districts to
be able to help make those
decisions.
We're also continuing
to uh to
uh update our ESS A
plans and
we're doing that work. Now,
we're working with community to be
able to provide feedback for us
and we will continue to
provide you updates on our
SA plans.
Uh We also are engaged
in external audit with our external
audit partners so that we can
continue to improve our
processes. Uh We
have posted a public facing
accountability calendar. So
Le A's are abreast
of the key activities and
dates related to the accountability
cycles. We've conducted
interviews and hosted feedback
sessions with districts and
charter schools, um
educators and education
nonprofit partners uh that
really include that have it
provided meaningful feed
feedback to the State so that
we can continue to improve
in New Mexico Vistas.
Uh NM Vista's uh
2.0 will
be uh be made
public on Monday.
Take a look at it. I think you are
going to be very, uh
impressed with
the, uh, the progress we've made and
the improvements we've made. If
you are a parent, you're a community member
or a teacher, it's gonna be
very valuable information
for you to be able to make, uh, make
these uh continued decisions about
students. We
revised the state's 2019
consolidated State plan to
reflect corrected business
rules for future accountability
cycles. This, uh
really amends accountability
portions to the State
uh improvement plans
and will be posted in public
comments over the next weeks.
Uh Another area
that we, I want to be able to bring up with
you as we get closer to the 60 day
Session that we've had some
conversations about is our student
information systems.
Uh We have uh 89
school districts, we have about 100
charters that means that we
have multiple student information
systems across New Mexico.
Sometimes this can be our greatest
barrier in making sure that we
can have those student informations
talk accurately
uh with highly
uh reliable data
to our Nova systems.
Uh We, we continue to
work through many of those issues
this year. We'll be
looking at
the uh real
possibility of moving towards a
single student information system
across New Mexico. This
will highly
um support
us having better data
and faster data so that we
can get those out to school
districts and share
that with communities. So
we will be looking for your support around
that area
this year uh PED is undergoing,
it's the first year of the implementation
of NOAA. Each reporting
period has gone smoother than the
last. Uh some
stakeholders are starting to see the
value in having
uh really one set of
books instead
of, of, of many.
Uh I know there has been some
concerns around uh the
the the reporting
periods. Uh Again,
we are, every reporting
period has gotten smoother.
And again, we're having those
conversations with school districts because
many times, most
of the time, the issue is just
that talking between their student
information system and
Nova and making sure we have
that reliable data and
accurate data coming in.
We've worked through many of those issues
and we're, and I'm looking forward to
the end of the year. Uh I do
believe I do know that that's
continued to improve every time we
do that we have our
data warehouse uh data from
Nova will soon be available to the
public through increased
transparency and reducing the
need for I A request which we get
many, much of.
I'm also excited about
data governance. Uh
Public Education Department
is working on data governance
procedures over the last day
and a half. So very recently,
this week, we've completed
workshops on data governance and
we're looking at ways to improve the data
systems within the
agency.
So with uh
this last slide, these are some
legislative considerations
uh that we have for you to be
thinking about as we get closer to
our 60 day Session.
Uh And I know that some of this came
up with our Las Unas
partners. Uh prior to me being
in the seat here um
is really fully funding
insurance,
um
strengthening requirements for
educational leadership preparation
and licensing, uh
required math professional
development and learning plans,
providing high school reading
support. As we mov'e,
you got to hear Lass talk about
the the the successes they've
had with structured literacy
at the elementary levels. We will be
working next year to complete that
with our fifth grade uh
round of teachers. But we're
also gonna be taking a
large leap forward
in making sure all of our middle
school. So 6th, 7th and 8th
grade grade teachers have
training around structure literacy
and we will start to look at how
we're going to start steep
that into our high schools.
Uh We've done a lot
of research, we've got a lot of data
back. Uh There is a
need that we've gotten feedback
from superintendents across the State
about providing more drug
counselors in high schools.
Uh This will be something that we will
be uh continuing to look at how
we can expand that across new
Mexico reducing
exclusionary practices.
Uh We want to make sure that students are
in school. Uh We want
to take a really hard look at what it
means to be able to be expelled
or suspended.
This always does have a
negative effect on student
learning. Um Updating
Community Schools Act uh
continuing to fund behavioral
health programs, fully
fund funding elementary physical
education, additional
funding for instructional materials,
supporting attendance
initiatives, providing a
statewide student information system
which I spoke about earlier
and requiring a common IEP
template. Uh We're very close
to be able to see that become a
reality. I'm looking forward to sharing
that IAP template with you
very soon.
So, uh last
slide, uh
this is a really
around our 2024
S A plan amendments
of the public Education Department
is in the middle of revising
the S A State plan. So
we want to take a moment to ask
as many people as possible
to provide that input. So we're doing
that work right now.
Additionally, um
ESA is in the
reauthorization of the federal
education law that gives
states more flexibility to
make decisions that are right
for their students and families.
Each State develops a plan
that describes the state's direction
for a variety of topics
including its long term goals,
how it measures State accountability
for its schoolss
strategies to support it
students as well as supports
for educators and school leaders
among other requirements.
The public education department's
current State plan was
approved in
2017
and it was the last amended in
2020. Uh
So it's time that we are able
to do these amendments once
again. So Mr.
Chair Members of the Committee.
Uh thank you for listening
to me this morning. I know it's a lot of
information. I know that there's
some other questions about some of these
topics and others. And
so I will stand for any
questions along with my team. Thank you,
Mr. Chair. >> Thank
you. Questions from the
Committee representative
Baca. Oh, good. About
starting us off. I appreciate it.
All right.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you uh Secretary
Romero. Um I'm
gonna have a number of questions
but again, just like before,
just very brief
concise to the point.
Um
one of the
uh errors you brought
up. Uh
Mr. our Secretary
Romero was about the teacher and
ed fellows. OK. Last
year, I know there was an attempt to
reduce that uh
amount that was appropriated
the year before.
Um Can you, can you
talk about is, is that program
adequately funded or do we
need to put more monies
in that to make sure that
we have a pipeline of
educators and next
generation of teachers?
>> Uh Thank you. Representative Mr.
Chair representative. Uh
so again, it's
been a very highly successful
program and I do want to
thank uh everyone for their
support. We're moving from
ESSER funds over to State
funds. What we're looking at
is to be able to continue with our
current cohorts to make sure that they can
finish the program. Uh You
all did fund it at $20 million.
That does seem to be right now
an adequate amount to be able to do
that. So I think we're
properly funded specifically
around educator fellows uh
with some of the other
pipeline programs,
we can also be able to
improve those. Uh those
others are in bucketed systems.
So I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm looking
at what that's going to look like as we mov'e
into the next three years.
And so I uh so representative,
I will continue to give you updates on,
on kind of where we're at with, with those
other preparation programs.
>> And thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you,
Secretary Romero. Uh One of the
areas I was brought up in was
transportation.
Transportation is a, is
a, is a problem statewide as
far as the districts are having
support with operational
funds. What
what measures are, how, what are you guys
looking or considering to
actually help support districts
that are already as we
see in a budget crisis?
>> Uh Absolutely, Mr.
Chair representative uh that
has been an issue as long
as I've been an educator
is uh fully funding
transportation. Uh
What I do want to tell you is
that transportation allocations
will be going out today.
Um looking forward to that. And
I, and I do acknowledge that this is
going out much later than I
would have wanted to.
There's a reason for that. We
wanted to make sure we got this
correct. I've been working
very closely with uh fiscal
and transportation within the public
education department. We will
be adding in a r
rurality
factor um to
be able to really balance out
the changes that we have
um in uh the
transportation allocations this
year. It was difficult because
what we found with the different
uh uh possibilities
out there that there were winners and there were
losers uh with
that very
um I was very
much sensitive, the needs of
many of our smaller and rural
uh districts and
many of the uh
the, the
ways in which we were
producing the allocations,
it was gonna hurt rural
communities. Uh But I do
think that this is the, what you're gonna
see today is going to
be um
as close as possible to
keeping people at least
whole or actually seeing them
grow uh somewhat.
Uh Again, this will be something that
we want to work on together
with Les C and you all as
legislators to
uh to continue to evolve,
to make sure that we're, we're
adequately funding
transportation.
>> And thank you, Mr. Chairman and my
my next question was regarding
some of the summer
reading institute or summer
literacy institute. Um
My question, um
Mr. Chairman and Secretary
is uh
let me first be clear, I do
support the
initiatives for to improve
reading. I support that
100%.
How many uh Mr. Chairman
and Secretary, how many folks have signed
up so far for this
uh summer reading institute?
Um because I
believe that you had
a capacity for
10,000.
>> Yes, sir, Mr. Chair representative, we've
had, we had just under
5000 students sign up.
We're continuing to add more every
single day. We've had about
1000 instructors sign up for
this. Uh So we're about halfway
to our goal. Uh Today
is um uh the
middle of May. So we
still have some time to be able to continue
to sign up. We're working directly
right now with our tribes bubbles and
nations to uh to be
able to support uh programs
within their teds, their
tribal libraries. But we're also
working very closely
with our uh uh
with our daycare
private providers. Uh
Many uh uh
school age Children
are actually in daycare
centers during the summer.
And so we've had some wonderful con
conversations with private providers
to be able to, since they're
there, we can be able to
provide this type
of opportunity for them in, in
those private settings. Uh We
will be over the next
couple of weeks providing
the train opportunities for those
instructors. Um This
is a great opportunity whether you're a
teacher, a retired teacher,
whether you are now a school
time provider, whether you work with
Children in any capacity.
Um This will be a great opportunity
to be able to get AAA
quick training
around structured literacy.
It's also gonna be wonderful
for our um
our teacher, our, our individuals
that are still with universities.
This will be their first dose on structured
literacy that will help benefit them when they get
their own classroom.
>> And thank you and
Mr. Chairman and Secretary,
you know, I I brought up the issue of
budget and uh to
my colleague, uh Senator
Stewart, it's, it's not always about
money but uh it
has been communicated. And
have you received the similar
communication regarding
many of our districts facing
this budgetary
um shortfalls?
What in your opinion, Mr.
Secretary has
um causes
or May have added to this budget
shortfalls and what
remedies do we see
um to
help districts? Because
as I said, Mr. Chairman and
Secretary,
what we're facing is we're
we're talking about already
lacking
staff to work in
schools for
our districts that are
gonna be impacted. What
assurances do they have
before drastic measures are
taken to make
budget?
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
Representative.
Absolutely. This is a, a huge
concern for me. Also,
it's a, it's a concern every
year as we start to mov'e, uh mov'e
forward to the next school year and
prepare budgets I've
had dozens
of conversations with superintendents
across the State and,
uh, really trying to gather
information so that I
can, you know, better,
um, support them moving
forward. I kind of put this
into four categories.
Um, and this isn't true for
every single system, but it's,
it's overall, I would
say that these are the four categories
in which we see us facing as
we mov'e into this next budget
season. First one is
enrollment across the State of New
Mexico. We see a drop
in enrollment. I would say this is by
far the number one issue that we
have uh school districts
are seeing those drops in enrollments.
And when that happens, um
it can have a major
impact on budgeting for the
next school year. And so
when that happens, when you have
a certain level of classroom
teachers, especially a certain
level of
administrative staff, it
does require that we start to have
some of those conversations about.
Are we properly staffed? Are
we heavily staffed in some areas?
Are we short staffed in other
areas? So enrollments,
number one, number two,
as we see that the switch
from esser funds over to State
funds, this has been
um hard in some areas.
Uh Some districts really relied
on esser funds to be able to support
teacher pay and contracts
and they're having to, to shift away
from that this year, which is
causing some uh some major
growing pains in that area.
The next. And I, I think you heard
that from Doctor Kettler is
around, uh, the increases
in insurance costs and this was,
uh, this has had an effect on
every single school district
across the State. Um, I
do want to say that,
um, we've had some really
positive conversations
with NMSA and
I really don't have anything to report on that
today, but I'm, I'm looking, I'm
optimistic that I'll have some
positive news
to be able to report on the
insurance front moving forward.
Um And I do want to thank our
partners uh from Nims
as they've really worked
closely with us to
be able to make sure that we
are doing everything we
can as we're getting ready
for this next budget season.
And of course, we have this
uh seg funding.
Uh The legislature
did appropriate about a
5.1% increase for
seg funds. Um
just to kind of put this in context
uh every year, as
long as I've been doing this, uh we
have, we come out with an initial
unit value um after
the legislative Session. Uh
And then in January,
we come out with a final unit
value uh this last
year. Uh I was, I was
happy because we were able
to provide an
initial, you know, value
highest that I've ever
seen as an educator.
I worked really hard to be able to
be, to do that. I knew
that that was important because this is going
to be the, this year that we're in
now is the year that we're
shifting from ser funds and the State
funds. And I knew that that was going to
be um a
hardship for school districts.
Um As we get into this next
year, we're doing the same work,
we provided a 3.2%
seg increase and
there was a few reasons for that.
Um I have been able to work
with uh Les C
staff and LFC
staff. Um I,
I very much
appreciate and
value their input to
this
around this. We're
looking at
going into it a little bit more
conservative for many reasons.
One is around enrollment,
around uh
both growth and declines
in enrollments and those insurance
costs. Um Seeing what those
final calendars are we gonna
look like. Uh But
we also had conversations
about, uh you know, typically
we have an initial value and finally a
value. Um I do
think that we'll be able to to
establish an initial value
soon, uh once we're able
to, to get all those calendars in
and we can actually do see
uh enrollments uh across
the State of New Mexico. So I
am, I'm, I'm pretty optimistic
that we'll be able to, to
re-establish our initial,
you know, value very
soon.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and uh
you know, I'm not gonna be labor, but
like for law
school district, we
only lost or had a reduction of 50
students that doesn't nowhere
near equal
$9.6 million.
So I, I do
agree, Mr. Chairman and
Secretary that, you know, you, you talked
about this but
um you know, we
talked about the percentage that the
unit value be too low and,
and my fear
is that, you know,
if we're waiting until January,
all these drastic measures will take
place. Uh I just
have
um another
question you, Mr. uh
Mr. Secretary, Mr. Chairman
Secretary, you heard about
the SCG and you heard
about some of the work that's going to be
done in this? Ok.
I, I asked a question earlier
about what areas
or what needed to be added. You know, we
talked about the at risk, we talk
about the family cost
index. What
other areas do you see
need to be considered when we're looking
at the SCG
um as far
as work or
um work on that to make sure
we're appropriately uh
funding schools. >> Uh
Mr. Chair representative,
um I think so many areas
I mentioned that we talked about today.
I think there's definitely can be
work and conversation around
transportation. I
know there's a lot of uh conversations
around uh reduction in class
size. Um Of
course, we want to be able to
expand um
many of the initiatives that we
see working uh like
teacher preparation programs
around innovation zones around
CTE these are all
areas that we want to be able to see
expand, but there are a few
areas that I'm really concerned about
because we got zero funding in it
this year. Uh One is
around our math uh
uh uh math, the
work we're doing around everything
in math. We had zero funding
for this year. So we are having
to kind of scrape pennies because
we can't not do that work.
Uh The other is around bilingual,
multi Multicultural Education
Act. Um Also the
Hispanic and Black Education
Act uh were cut.
So we're having to really think
about how we can continue those
services. And a big
one that was uh we got
zero funding is the work that
we're doing with our uh
with our schools and needs of
improvement. Uh We
have dozens of
schools across New Mexico that
continue to need this support.
And uh we were, we,
we got zero funding in it this
year, but that work still needs to
continue. So uh
we will be working with you
all to, to ensure that hopefully
we can get that funding back to this next
Session and >> I will
yield my time after this. But I also think
that another area that needs to be addressed
in the SCG
is the, the
issue of school safety, that it
needs to be funded properly, not
just as far as
the, um, the, the
actual physical plan to the
buildings, but also in
people and the social
emotional learning. When I saw yesterday that
New Mexico is number one
as far as in, you know, youth
suicides
and the other types of behaviors
that we're hearing and seeing. I
think that we have to do a better
job of actually
funding and supporting
our schools, our students
and our families. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Thank you,
Representative Baca Senator
Brand. You're
up. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. Um
So I have a few questions.
Um
One is you, you have a
proposed rule.
I think it's proposed. Maybe it's
a, maybe it's
actually already put in place
uh dealing with the
uh healthy
school meals
program
that is requiring
schools to grow their own
food,
who gave you the authority to do
that? >> Sure,
Mr. Chairman and, and
Senator um there,
there is a new rule that
has been proposed, it is open
for feedback at this time.
Um and
it, it does not have
a requirement. Um It,
it, what the, what the rule
does is establish uh
the definitions around quality
meals and that is one of the
options. Um,
for one of the two
options includes
growing, growing
food toward the
school lunch program. Yes.
>> And, and my understanding is
that, that,
um, the rule
says you, you won't
get a,
the highest reimbursement
unless you grow up to 50% of
your own food.
>> Um, Mr. Chairman and
Senator, no, the,
the rule does not have
a, a particular, uh, amount
set for how much of your food
needs to be
grown.
>> Is it just that 50% of
the schools have to do
it?
>> Yes, it is not. It, there
is no, there's no
quantity of
food that needs to be grown.
It's about the, the
schools that are using it and the
number of months
that the
um, in which the food
is used.
>> So, um, I
guess I'll go back to my other
question, which is,
uh, where did you get the authority
to do that?
>> The um,
Mr. Chairman and
Senator, the,
the statute,
uh, as before
from the,
um, provided
the agency
with um,
the, the requirement
to create a rule
around um,
school,
the quality meals for schools,
excuse
me.
>> So I got, got it open right
now.
And can you tell me
where?
>> I, I don't have the rule
in front of me, Mr. Chair
and Senator >> I'm
talking about in the law because I don't
think that I, I mean, I, I don't
want to speak for anyone else on,
on the legislators,
but I don't remember
voting for
us to require schools to
become farmers
and grow their own food.
I don't know if, if I'm
incorrect and if everyone
that's in the legislature knew
that, but I certainly didn't know
that >> Mr.
Chair and Senator II, I
did not mean to say
that everything that is
included in the rule is
specified in the
statute. Um
You asked for where we had
authority to make the rule and we
have general rulemaking authority.
But also the, the statute
did provide for the
agency to create a rule in
this area. And as
part of that we did,
um, the, the
agency is
charged with filling in
areas that are
not specifically provided
for in statute.
>> Right. So,
um,
I'll, I'll look through this some more
and I, I understand that the department
has general rulemaking
authority.
Um
I, I think as legislators, we're
gonna have to start really being a little
more careful
because the departments
on every bill we
pass, you
know, they still have implemented
completely
incorrectly.
The bill that I passed on,
uh, students
going back and getting their high school
diploma.
That rule has
nothing to do with the law that was
passed and
they've never corrected it.
And, you know, we have a Judge
that's, that's put a stay on
another rule
that, uh, pretty
much they didn't have any authority to
do and yet they
did,
we, as legislators are gonna have to
be a little more careful
because we have departments that
have decided they don't really care what
we think and what we do
and I'm sorry to say, but I believe
your department has gone a little
rogue
and you don't really care what the
legislature has given you authority
to do. You're just doing whatever the hell you
want.
And that's very disappointing
to me.
Um,
II, I think that what
you've done on the
180 day
thing
was a complete overstep
of your authority. And
I think this is pretty
darn similar.
None of us intend for our
schools
to have to grow their own
food. That's
not what locally grown was supposed
to be about.
Um, if they
want to, that's
fine,
but to, to make
it where you're not gonna get
the full
reimbursement
if you're not growing
in half of your schools, I
don't know who came up with
that.
But, uh, I don't think
that that's something you
should be doing, but
we start focusing back on,
on reading and
math and the things we're
supposed to be focused on.
We can't get those things right.
But you want to play in all these other
areas.
It's, it's
really disturbing to
me. I
think the department has
lost their freaking minds
and I'm very disappointed and
very upset about what the department
is doing. And then on the
180 day rule
thing,
you know, the department,
I'm gonna speak, speak to legislators
a little bit here.
The department put
out their
instructions on the
rules. Their
instructions violated their own
rule.
They couldn't even get their instructions.
Right.
This department is a
mess
and I'm, I'm not gonna be as,
as rude
as, uh some of us
were
with the
last governor's
Secretary,
but this is, this
is completely
inexcusable what this department
is doing right now to our
schools.
100 and 80 day
thing.
They can't. Good
Lord. The implementation
instructions don't even
comply with what the rule
says.
I can get you the emails by the way,
if you want to have those that show
that, that prove
that
it's time that, that
we start holding some departments
accountable
and this department has been,
has not been held accountable
by the legislature at
all. Um I'm
glad there's a Judge that's actually gonna
hold them accountable
and, and do away with this
180 day rule that you
had no authority to put in place.
In fact, it went completely
contrary
to what the legislative
intent was and you knew
it
and I know you won't speak about a current
ongoing case. Fine. I
will.
It's completely unacceptable
what this department is doing. You're not
making it easier for our schools to
teach and you're not keeping the
focus on teaching our
Children and
the focus should be on our
Children
right now, we just keep
slipping further and further behind
as a State in
education
and this department has not made it
any better. They've made
it worse and they've made it harder
for districts and it needs
to stop or
the legislature needs to
act. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you, Senator. Uh,
next I have Representative
Moya.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, um, Secretary.
Um, I have a
couple of questions. Um
One of them is having
to do with the summer literacy
program. Um What
tool are you going to use
to help monitor the
effectiveness? Um Is it going
to be like with I station that's going
already go right into
it. So that way um
we can actually, and, and
is that information kind of
two parts gonna be available
for teachers to be able
to uh get
so they can start the year out
and see what possible gains,
hopeful gains is that
these students have uh for
the beginning of the year. >> Uh
Yes. Thank you, Representative
and uh Chairman and
Representative Moya. Uh Yes,
we will be having a pre and post
assessment to, to within
this summer reading program.
It will be Dibbs will be the
pre and post. Uh We
should immediately be able to get results
uh from the pre and post to be
to share both with you as an
instructor, as an educator
and with families. We're
also gonna be working with higher
education to be able to do a long,
uh, long range study over the
next three years. So we
can really follow these students to
see if they have continued
improvements over that
time.
>> Um, thank you, Mr. Chair and Secretary.
Um, that, because that's important
that the, the teachers I
know for me as a, as a science
teacher, I get very frustrated
like when, because we only test
them in the 11th grade.
Um, But I have never
seen data.
I've never seen what my kids
get, what my kids don't. I
personally I would
love to see that I would
love and, and how can I
improve what we're
doing as,
as a, as a science department if we
never see the
data in which
like we see general data, we
see a percentage of the entire
school, but I want to see
what they're getting. Is there certain
concepts that are harder for them?
Um And, and I know you guys,
we've had, we have this
huge focus
on um with
as we should on reading and,
and math and, and the fact
that you say that we don't have
any funding for math is like,
that blows my mind
because that's our,
our math scores are terrible
in the State. So why
we're not getting funding for that is,
is crazy.
Um
But, but, but
it's also um
you know, why take a test
if I don't see data, why
take a test if I don't see
what individual students are
doing. It, it shouldn't just
be for a post on the
website. It should
be used as a
tool
for, for, for
teachers to be able
to see what their kids
are getting and what their kids aren't
because we talk about data all
the time, but data is useless
if we don't see it.
It really is.
Um So,
um the other question
is, um
uh why is there no
enrollment data published?
Uh We should have info
about the 40
81 20 day
counts and um
but there is no district
school enrollment published. And
when will that be fixed?
Uh >> Thank you, Mr. Chair,
Representative Moya. I'm gonna turn
it over to my partners. I think they have a, a
good uh answer
for, for those questions,
>> Mr. Chair and Representative.
So the the 40th
day data is available
that um
it May not be published on our
website. I don't know that 40 day
enrollment data typically
is I'd have to check but
um our 80 our 80th
day data, we are working out
the last little bit of
validation issues that we
have. Um
and we will be certifying
that data and making it
avail, making it available
very soon. Um For
100 and 20th day data, there still
is some, there still are some
districts with that
we're working with to get their data
cleaned up and ready. And so
that's still taking a bit it really
is just our back and forth with the
districts making sure that
everything is correct before we
release.
>> And um thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um Thank you Mr.
Frostad.
Um So is
it, is it just the, the
back and forth that's delaying
it or is it that that certain
area in your department? Because I know you
guys still have not a
full department? So is it,
is it that you need
more people to be able to
process this information or
is it districts possibly
like, what do you think it is that is
delaying this whole thing?
>> So the Mr. Chair
and representative the the big
difference this year is the shift
from stars data
collection system that we've had
for 20 years to
Nova. And
the there have
been uh
it change
in itself is difficult and
the the big shift
for districts
is that rather than
exporting their
data from a student information
system and then being able to make
changes on a
spreadsheet and then submitting
spreadsheet a a spreadsheet
that does not directly come from
the student information system
is different from
Nova. Now we take the
the data directly from
Noda through an API
into from from
the student information system through
an API straight into Nova.
And so the data needs to be correct
in the student information system. There's
not that intermediary
step for them to make the changes
too. And so it's just
working with
districts to make sure the data is
correct in the student information
system. Um so
that it can be pulled across into
Nova directly. And then
also making
sure that we have
had struggles with the student
information systems themselves, with
data mapping, making
sure that the data that we pull out
of the I makes it into the
correct place in the Nova Database.
So there have been, there have
been a couple of different areas that we're
working on. But right now,
the big, the big push is
to make sure that the districts
have the data correct in
their student information systems.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
and Mr. Frostad. Um
I, so basically it's, it's
first year bugs
because I do remember
that that we had a meeting last
um interim. That was, that
was the whole point of moving over to Nova
because it's supposed to be
easier, but I get
it that first year. It's always
crazy. So hopefully,
hopefully in years to come, it
will be done a lot quicker
because we'll know what bugs
we have already solved those.
So, thank you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
and Representative and, and
Lynn if you'd like to address the science
reports. >> Yes, Mr.
Chairman Representative Moya, thank
you for your question about this science
assessment comment.
I just wanted to clarify
that we do
provide
individual student results
at the indicator level
for our
performance categories
that aligned to the standards on
our science reports.
Um Every district has
a district test coordinator that
would be the person that we would
communicate with. There is a
calendar also
available publicly that the
Secretary mentioned his
presentation where we
announce to schools when they can
access that data. And I'm
more than happy to follow up for
you if um to get
your school so that that you
know that you have access to
>> those.
Yes, Mr. um
Mr. Chair, please do.
Uh because
like I said, I've taught
science for five years and I've never
seen data.
Never.
>> Thank you, Representative uh
Representative
Garrett.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for being here.
I, I have someone that blames
me for all violent crime
in the entire State.
And so I feel like we kind of
put you on the hot seat, you're
responsible for everything. So thank
you for being Members of Pe
D Lynn. It's great to see
you. How long have you worked for PE
D? >> I think it's
now combined eight years.
>> Ok. It's great to see
you again. Um Couple
questions. Um
First of all, I'm glad to hear Diels
is being used as
a long time
test coordinator who's
tested hundreds and hundreds
of kids with dibels.
It outshines I
station
by a million
percent just
as an experienced tester. I have to
say that uh who
got the contract, who are
the contractors for the literacy
program? Uh Mr.
Chair and, and uh
PD
>> Mr. Mr. Chair, representative,
uh I don't have, I
can't think of the names off the top of my head. We
have six contractors that we
did, uh, did a
work to. We are looking
forward to working with all six
contractors. Uh, they
will be kind of working in specialized
areas. So for example,
we have some that will be helping us
with the, uh, the virtual
type of instruction.
We have some that will be very specific to
rural and very
specific to urban
centers. Um
None of, none of the,
uh none of the six contractors had
the capacity to do the whole
State. So this is going to work
out. Well, uh representative,
I don't have the names but I can get you
those names here.
Um Soon. >> Uh
Mr. Chair and Mr. Secretary,
please, if you could give it to the
Committee, that would be really great.
You talked about uh
5000 studentss have
signed up 1000
instructors
um in that training,
something like Dibble's took
me basically a year
to master and
I was already an experienced
educator, reading
instructor.
How are people going
to learn how to
deliver this important
program? Also for people
that it sounds four
kids are easy. I think anybody
in the room who's been a teacher knows that
you can have the four kids
from,
um
let's just say very
streps
enthusiastic,
hard to sit down
for four hour period.
So how are you gonna
train people who come from
diverse experiences
to do the
management?
Uh Whatever
larger situation
exists,
the testing alone,
I did. I've done a week of
DeVos training probably
four times.
How are you going to
ensure that
it's really done to
fidelity?
Plus the letters
training? >> Absolutely,
Mr. Chair
Representative.
Yes, that, that's, that's our next
challenge is to be able to
provide high quality training
for each of these instructors
uh that we have across the State.
We will be working directly
with those vendors. They do have
a training program in place.
The training will take
place really like the last
week of May. It's going to be a
five day, 40 hour
training um in
their specific uh structure
literacy programs. Each
vendor does have a different uh
way to
um to uh
to, to provide
that structure literacy. So it'll be
very specific to that vendor's
training um and
uh and instructional materials.
Uh We will also be providing a
coach for them also. So
these instructors will be uh
be coach throughout
the the process through
the vendors so that they get
that continued support.
Again, this
is another opportunity for
many of these instructors who are
current educators
to get another dose of structured
literacy. Uh But for
many, it will be their first experience
with structured literacy. So
we will uh our goal is to be able to
support them to the full
extent so that, that they're
successful. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Secretary.
How many sites
are these 5000
students going to be served
at? Thank >> you, Mr.
Chair representative right now,
we have 69
local leas and charters
signed up for this. That
now that doesn't mean that
there, there could be multiple schools
within that le
A. So we are actually
working directly with LE
A and charters now so that
we can evenly distribute
out those sites.
So I would
multiply that number up, I don't have a
solid number for you, unlike the
specific school sites.
But that's coming soon. We're
also working with local
tribal education
agencies to be able
to put the programs
within local communities within
tribal libraries. We're
also even working with local
tribally controlled schools
to be able to do that also.
And the work is happening right now to
be able to uh add more
sites when it comes to uh
both uh
municipality
and uh county uh
summer school programs uh
specifically, like we've had
some great conversations with uh
Albuquerque right now,
so we can extend that into some of
their summer recreation programs.
And lastly, we're doing the work right
now to be able to expand
programs into many
of our private daycare
providers. And so that, that
work is happening across the State.
Much of our rationale
around this is that we are, we've
got a map and we can see
where all of our, our spots
are and we're trying to make
sure that we are emphasizing some
of those, those blank spots
across the State so that
we're making this as easily
accessible to families as
possible. >> And
Mr. Secretary May, I
absolutely, the,
the contractors
are Lavinia May
Center, New House reading
Horizons and TNT
P.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. And,
and um
can you send that to
us?
Can't. Right. I
got one of the four
down. Um
And then Mr. Chair. My next question
is if we're using
dibbles in
the summer literacy
program.
What about year round? The
State is used eye
station.
Um, a, a well
trained Diels
person testing
kids can actually with
accuracy,
tell a lot more about a kid's
reading than you
can with Ice Station which
requires additional
testing. Ice Station
is not enough to
really accurate in a short
period of time.
Uh Is the State gonna mov'e
to Diels? That's amplify,
right?
I want to take that one
is, is that represent
a mov'e in the coming
school year?
How are we gonna mix
Dibels and Ice
station? Go
ahead.
Now,
I'm sorry for people that aren't
familiar with this.
>> So I, I will speak to
this from like the assessment
program versus the
internal CN I
programmatic decision about
using des. So
um we, we've
been using I station
for quite a while.
Um It,
there's a adage
that measurement, people
say that if you want to measure
change, don't change the
measure. Um
It's been, it's been
something that the prior cabinets
have discussed about
looking at a different early
literacy tool. I think it
was a difficult kind of a double
edged sword coming out of the pandemic
and teachers really needing that
stability. We talk
about the the amount of time it takes
for training cycles and so forth,
especially when it's a statewide
initiative. Um
And so I think it's always
kind of a discussion that we're
willing to have on the table,
but we also really
appreciate the stakeholder
feedback. Um The feedback
today, um Mr. Chair
Representative here, apologize
for not using your titles. Um
The feedback today is, is, is
really helpful in knowing
that um we will continue
to engage our
districts, our statewide
Assessment Accountability
Advisory Committee in
making those decisions. We always
like to um
land with the assessment
task force, which we did back in
2019, which
is one of the reasons why we kept that.
But I just want to underscore
um the rationale for that
in terms of
Diels. Um Just
again,
having that as another
tool, we think about the balance
assessment system. We
want schools to have access and
we want leaders to be able to make
decisions about the tools that are
in place. Um And
so we consider DLS as
part of our statewide assessment
system. It's
a range of tools
for, for educators in our, in
their tool belts.
>> OK. So mister Chair, I I
understand then that it's
an ongoing conversation. It sounds
like Los Luna is using
devils. Is
that? No, I
thought that's amplified. What's
the amplified?
They are the
same
but
they
OK. Got it.
OK. Things change
quick.
OK. Um That's my
questions on
literacy. Oh,
I have one more literacy question.
General Aguilar from the National
Guard said that he was asked by the
Governor to do a pilot
literacy program.
Are there other pilot
literacy programs
that people around the State have been asked
to do over the
summer. >> Mr. Chair
Representative. Yes, we will
public Education Department will be
working directly with General Aguilar
to really put on a
program specific to
uh middle school students
in the Albuquerque area.
We're looking at working betweens
uh 50 to 70
students um and
in a multiple range of, of,
of areas,
uh one is around leadership
development, being able to provide
them access to
um uh internship
opportunities and
uh looking forward to that, that positive
partnership part of that will also
be uh part of the day
will also be around structured literacy.
So I'm looking forward to this being a
a wonderful pilot,
but to answer your question, no,
that that's, that's the
the extent to that definition
of a pilot project that we have
going on for this summer.
>> And, and Mr.
Secretary, Mr. Chairman and
Representative, I wanted to clarify
a little bit the the contractors
that were mentioned that I texted to
you, uh the contract process
is not finished for all of them yet.
So there's still potential
contractors and I
provided that in the text that I sent
you as well represents.
>> Thank you very much Kate.
My next question has to
do with um some of the
questions that Senator
um Grant brought
up Mr. Chair. It
it is a bit of an elephant in the room,
the 180 day decision
by the Judge, I
understand that the next he's
done an injunction the next
hearing is after the July
1st deadline,
how does that impact our districts?
They've been turning themselves into
pretzels with two
schedules,
funding
transportation? You name
it. Can you really
talk about
the specific
impact of the
judge's decision?
How does that affect our school
districts and charter
schools
today right
now, in light
of the calendar request, they
received,
uh they just
the nuts and bolts
and, and a real conversation,
we really need to hear what's
going on.
>> Um Yes, uh uh
Mr. Chair representative,
uh we will be moving
forward uh and adapting to
the judge's order. Uh
This is something that
um we are continuing to work
on specifically with
each individual district.
Uh We've been having those conversations
about what their budgets and their
calendars will look like.
Um And so, uh we're
gonna go forward with business as
usual uh today.
Uh We still have, we, we, we've
actually gone through about maybe
20% of budgets uh
with district so far.
So this uh this
uh new information that we have to mov'e
forward, um will,
you know, theoretically not
have too much of a negative
impact. I hope on school
districts being able to prepare their, their
calendars uh for
many of those districts that were wanting
to be able to mov'e forward with their,
their current or
um current four day
calendars or what they've had in the
past. Uh I think,
you know, everyone
that I've been able to talk to, we
prepared for those, those,
uh, conversations to mov'e forward with that.
So we're gonna support them to be able to
make sure that they, um,
are taking advantage of
uh the the best calendar they can put
forward.
>> So Mr. Chair, that means
if a district, I think
it's 58 districts
on the lawsuit, 58
districts have four day charter
schools
can't, they then
continue. I,
I just wanna
specifically, they
do not have to change
their schedule to five
days and, and
also how can they even
comply when we don't have
test scores?
>> Mr. Chair Representative. So
correct. They would, they would, I, I
think in your example,
I can give an example if a school
district was a four day district, they would
continue to be a four day district
moving forward.
>> So Mr. Chair, they do not
have to comply
based on the judge's injunction
that's now in place
>> Mr. Chair. I correct.
>> Ok. And as you
know, I'm one of the
sponsors of
the 1140
Hours
and it was only in
place for two months
when suddenly
a rule was made.
So I feel
like
not honoring the
legislative intent,
not even
giving it a year,
which I told the Governor
it's an inappropriate to
change when we haven't
even seen something for a year
in action.
Um, so, yeah,
very. Um,
I'm glad that the Judge
actually read everything. That's
all I'll say on that. Uh
Mr. Chair. My next question is
funding for community schools.
I've gotten texts and calls
that the community school
budgets have been cut in
half that they can
know they can only use the
money to hire
coordinators when
some of them had used
their budget, you
know, to hire social workers,
something like that. Can
you give an update
on the community school
funding situation
which is seriously
consi
for those out there? >> Absolutely,
Mr. Chair Representative, yes,
the funding this
last year was in the amount of 10
million for this current year, it will be
8 million. So there
is a reduction in what can
be provided with that
difference
after consulting with uh
with LFC, uh and
staff,
what what I believe to be
true is that this was
uh always somewhat of an
intens intention to make
sure that uh that
these funds for this grant was
able to help get those community
schools going. But over
time, there would be a transition
in and how they continue to support
those. And so
that's some of the work that's happening
now. We have
uh we're working with school districts right
now, uh you know, specifically
to help them with that transition.
Uh But uh it, it
will be impossible to keep the
same level of funding when we go from
10 million to 8
million.
>> Thank you and, and Mr.
Chair and, and Mr. Secretary,
you talked about needing
um
Legislation affecting the
Community School Act. Can
you say specifically
what kind of
Legislation
it was one of the recommendations
on the handout?
>> Sure. Yeah. Uh
Mr. Chairman and representative,
one of the big um
one of the big
reasons to look at
the Community Schools Act is the
language around
the
$150,000
amount. Uh Right
now it is a fixed
amount, but not all
schools May need the
same amount of an
award. And so we'd
like, we, we would like
to be able to provide some
flexibility in the amount of
award. Um Also
there are, there have been some
changes in uh
community schools from
when the act was
instituted. Um
The for instance, the
number of pillars
around community schools has
changed uh in,
in the newest work done in
that area. And um
so there, there are some other updates
that we would like to consider as
well. >> OK. Thank you for
that specific. I really appreciate
it. Uh Mr. Chair. My next
question is the media campaign
for attendance. I have to say I
haven't seen it.
Um I don't watch TV.
Is it on TV? Is it on
radio?
Um Where
is the campaign,
>> Mr. Chair Representative? Yes.
So it, it's gonna be all those places
you just mentioned, we will have a
media campaign where we have
billboard campaigns, but
also specifically around social
media campaigns. And that's all happening
right now. Uh I
would love to be able to, I can
maybe share with you directly some
of what, what those ads look
like and make sure that
you get some of the
exposure.
>> And Mr. Chair, something
that um and Mr. Secretary
and team, something that legislators
always request is if
you can uh
send to the 112
legislator stuff, you know,
graphics,
um things that we put
on our social media, we all have
social media. I
mean, just in this room allowed
alone, you probably reached
20,000 people
um from our dedicated
followers,
you know, pro and con
followers. So yeah,
I'd appreciate getting
it. It's just one
more tool in the
toolbox.
OK?
I have just a couple more
questions.
Um Mr.
Chair and um
pe D team,
a great concern to me
and it's been brought up by several
people here already
is we're talking
about post
teacher training, literacy
training once you're
already a teacher, math training
when you're already a teacher.
Um We've talked,
how robustly do you
work with the colleges and
deans of education?
I mean, some of this stuff
isn't Legislation,
it's done through policy
and budget work.
Um As somebody
who did an unpaid
teacher residency when I
became a teacher still
paying for it
um
there has to be more
robust math. OK. I
went up to calculus. I'm not
afraid of math. I love
math. My
math training was
about a
lucy goosey
semester of
math. I
learned math through
Turk Math when I was actually
teaching. That's when I really
learned. So
it just seems like
especially for elementary
teachers, we
need to really,
really look at
that math and reading
training. And as, as
representative
um Mirabal
Moya always says science,
actually, my science training was
the best of
my um
training. So
I just wanna request
that they're
really included.
So that that
happens. And
then um Mr. Chair, the
other thing is
another Lucy
course, secondary
teachers required to take reading
across the curriculum.
And there are still high school
teachers out there
that say it's not my job
to teach kids how to
write. So I just,
that's another aspect
of the preparation for
teachers that we have to look
at. Ok.
And I do believe I just
have two more questions, Mr.
Chair, the special
education differentials
when, where, how, why
it's controversial
when special ed
ed teachers
get differentials and
others don't, I mean,
as language arts
teachers, I can't
tell you how many weekends
evenings we take
grading essays
and giving feedback
um
who determines
the amount of the differential,
who gets it,
please some
details when,
where, how I
anything you've got. >> Absolutely
Mr. Chair representative, I'll
try to quickly answer your question.
Uh we are actually putting together
a grant process right now. So
schools will be able to apply for
grants so that they can
request the funding that they need,
depending on the amount of,
of need that they have within their
district. And so that
is that we're putting together that grant
process now and that should be going
out in the next few weeks.
>> Thank you. Ok.
Um And the
oh and Mr. Chair
and Mr. Secretary, the timeline
for the uh
State equalization
guarantee or sig
what's the timeline for
upping that from
3.2%?
>> Uh Mr. Chair representative, I would
I, my goal is to do
that sometime over the next
few weeks.
Um So, II I don't
have an exact date for you today, but I would
like for that to happen before we come back
in the next school year.
>> Ok. That's, that's a
six months. No,
that how many months? Three
months, four
months. >> Well,
we May and they'll come back in
August. So I'm, I'm hoping it'll be sometime
in June or July.
>> Ok. Thank you.
Um And then my
last, I actually have a
last question.
Um Mr. Chair, my
last question is the
common um
individual education
plan template.
I thought that was
already, I
thought that wasn't something for
the 2025 Session. I thought
that was already underway.
Can you give an update on
the process on the IEP
>> Mr. Chair representative? Yes,
that is underwear right now,
we're look, we're working with
different vendors to see
uh what that May look like. We're very close
to the end of that. I think the next
time I'm in front of you, I will be able to
give you a really great update
on what that's gonna look like.
>> Great. Thank you so much,
all three of you and thank
you, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you, Representative, uh Senator
Lopez. We're a little bit behind
schedule. I don't want to stifle
questions, but
as we continue to keep things
tightened to the points,
Senator, >> I to understand
Mr. Chair, I only have 20
questions.
Just
kidding.
And actually Mr. Chair,
um, the representative asked a
few of my points so
I won't have to reiterate or
ask more questions.
Um I appreciate Mr.
Secretary,
um, your legislative
considerations, the list that
you have here and maybe there'll be
more, we'll see.
Um, but I, I do have a
question when you mentioned here and
reduced exclusionary
practices. Are
you talking about suspensions
or, or what Mr.
Chair, Mr.
Secretary >> Mr. Chair?
Senator? Yes. So that that
would be part of it. I'm gonna give that
to Assistant Secretary Frostad. He's
been working on that. I think he'll give
you a very concise
answer to that.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and, and
Senator. So
one of the areas that we're looking
at around the State, again, one of
our biggest problems is attendance
and there are, there
are, are multiple
reasons around attendance. One of the things
that we'd like to do is
not only
incentivize students to come
to school, but we also want to look
at not pushing them out
of school. So yes, we are looking
at um using
restorative practices instead
of suspension and expulsion as
much as possible and providing training
and opportunities for
staff to learn about that and have
another tool in their toolbox
to be able to deal
with um
student discipline issues
in ways other than suspension or
expulsion.
>> And, and I appreciate that, um,
Mr. Chair, Mr. Secretary
because that's been an issue for a very
long time.
And I can talk about the schools
in my area in my
Senate district 11,
um, a couple of schools in, in
particularly where
we've had issues over many, many
years and I've been around a
while. So I'm, I'm glad to
hear that it's still
on the list for consideration,
but Mr. Chair or Mr.
Secretary, as you know,
um,
it's not just an issue in
the metro areas but also
in rural schools. Um,
I know I have spoken
to many parents who've had some
issues as to their child,
um, when that, that
child has been,
um,
precluded from coming to
class, uh, for many
different reasons. And then where does the child
go? So, I'm glad
that it's still on the list and has a,
it still part
of the discussion.
And that also leads me then Mr.
Chair Mr.
Secretary, um I
recently,
um as we
all use this thing, right? So it's
easy to flip through and find
different sources
to read from, but
I was looking up New Mexico
and our numbers of drop
outs, um, were still
high um
in the number
and I know, um,
you know, even for some
friends, uh who've
had their, their child
who has dropped out for many different
reasons. But,
um,
what is it that we could do? Is
there something in your toolbox
that you're going to be proposing to
us? Is it part of the
consideration? Because
I also believe Mr. Chair
Mr. Secretary, it also
looks at those exclusionary
practices. I think they're all kind
of intertwined.
Um But what
is it on your radar with regards
to dropout? >> Absolutely.
Thank you, Mr. Chair Senator.
Yes. Uh That, that is
uh, one of our priorities is
not only how we
reage students that have dropped out, but how
we continue to increase
graduation rates across New
Mexico to get him
across that finish line. Uh
We again, this year,
we, we are working with specific
districts to do that work and we do
have the media campaigns going out.
Now, uh for next
year, we have that five mil million dollar
allocation. We
are putting together the plans right now where
we're working with uh with many
districts to help us with that plan.
This is going to help guide us and what
the next step is going to
be. This won't be
an issue that we solve. Uh Just
tomorrow, it's going to be something that we have to
continue to work on.
But um absolutely.
So, not only are we looking
at how we improve attendance
and graduation rates, but also how
we improve our instructional
practices, how we get
students to want to be at school.
Uh Many of the, we've seen a lot
of the success around CT
programs and around
Innovation Zone projects that are
happening in school districts.
It's important that we make sure
that students want to be there. They
have connections to the adults and
other students and that
we have those uh those
exclusionary practices that we
start to step away from to
make sure that we can uh ensure
that students want to be there, they
feel successful and safe there.
It gets to center uh represent
Baca's comments
around safe schools. All these
uh play a part into
making sure that we don't have
dropout and we continue to
see students stay in school so
they can graduate.
>> Um Mr. Chair, Mr. Secretary
again, I appreciate that, but
of course, it's always as they say the
devils in the details and
but it's also implementation Mr.
Chair because we May say something
good that works in, in a
larger school district. But again, when you
look in rural New Mexico,
um they do have dropout.
Um It's something
that I think we have to
keep at the forefront.
And a couple of that Mr.
Chair is talking about Adult
Basic Ad.
Um You know, I I still
believe Mr. Chair for many
years I have spoken
about and I know others have too
about the economic
value
that if we could truly work
with um
improving
outcomes for
young adults and even
others who dropped
out for whatever the reason May
have been. But to
get them back in
for that little
certificate
that says they've completed high
school, an Adult
Basic Ed, Mr. Chair, we
really haven't paid much attention to
it over many, many years,
Representative Miera and I worked on
Bill's years past
and it was just kind of a
feel good. Um
but I really believe Mr. Chair,
Mr. Secretary that Adult
Basic Ed is still another venue
that we need to look at
and adding value to what
we
propose and we know this
because if your child sees
that your parent is going, or even
grandparents going back to getting
that piece of paper,
it makes a big difference,
a real big difference.
And then Mr. Chair, another question
with regards to, um, and
I noticed in your,
you were talking about the
uh a plan amendments
and of course, this is title seven
with the mckinney Vento Homeless
Assistance.
Um
What are you considering? What
is it that um that
your department? And the reason why
I just bring this up, Mr.
Mr. Chair Mr. Secretary is
because, um
and we know, you know, the issue of
those who aren't unhoused, not just
in Albuquerque, but many other
communities. There are for
many, there are families
who don't
have access to permanent
housing
and
what can we do from the State
level, from your department? Mr.
Secretary? Um to
really, I think
utilize these dollars
in a, in a fashion in a way
that truly helps
families. Um
Do you have any suggestions?
>> Uh Mr. Chair Senator?
Absolutely. You know, I've been
working with the
families that fall
under that homelessness or mckinney
Beto category
for a number of years. I would
say this is the big
conversation. We could probably spend a
couple of hours just talking about
this. But I would say in
terms of, of,
of the, your, your, your
question just now is
really about supporting schools
and school districts around how we
identify families
that require these kinds of support.
Sometimes that's the biggest
step that we, we sometimes
fail in communities
because we don't have the processes
and procedures in place to do that.
So we are continuing to work
with leas and
charters to make sure that they
have a high quality system in
place to be able to identify
those families and students that need
that kind of support. Once that
happens, then, then we
have the dollars and then, and
the uh the the systems
behind that to be able to
um identify
how to specifically support
those families. It's always a little
different. Is it transportation
issue? Is it a food security
issue? Is it, is it
actually um um square
footage and where they're living? Is
it temporary? What that's gonna look like?
How do we provide them with those
resources? But step one
is how we have a high quality
identification system and
that's what we'll continue to do to
try to improve that for school districts
across the State, >> you know,
and I thank you Mr.
Chair Mr. Secretary because
this to me and
others, of course, uh
has a relation especially
with um kin,
grandparents are
raising their grandchildren. And I've had a
very
informative conversation
with persons in Taos,
in Taos school district and with some of
their charters up there
specifically about, you know, the
Sinia school, that whole
community um where
they, they do have
a population of
Children who are
in need of services, but also
the families need some
help and it May be temporary
housing as such. But
Mr. Secretary
Mr. Chair, I would
hope that we could have
some conversations
or some creativity in working with the
early childhood department
um with your department and
some of the other service areas.
Um I think if we could pull
resources together
that would really help many of our
families that are in need.
Um And then Mr. Chair
uh one more
area and I'm sure it'll be part of our
discussion through the interim. But
when we talk about charter school
accountability,
I think we
really, you
have a charter school division. Mr.
Secretary,
I, I've had
some conversations with some persons
for some charters in my
particular neck of
the woods where
some of the audits
are taking a very long time
to catch up
with maybe some discrepancies
that have taken place.
And ultimately, Mr.
Chair, Mr. Secretary,
I know the Public Education
Commission has oversight,
but then you also have local school
districts who have oversight
depending if their State approves
or if it's, you know, for
the school district oversight
approval.
So I would hope Mr. Chair
that as we proceed in having a
conversation about charter schools
that we truly look about
accountability, but especially in
the audits as
to how those monies are being
spent and the
paper trails.
Um because Mr. Chair,
Mr. Secretary, I have some data
that is very troubling
and,
you know, our, our charter schools
truly,
um,
being held accountable
for their, their governing
board. Um,
I've had some Legislation Mr.
Chair over years making sure that
it's not, you
know, your
brother-in-law or somebody
else as part of the board.
Um, I know it's hard to find
governing board Members but I think
there's some duplicity
issues of membership on
some of these boards too that we really
need to have some oversight
on just some
concerns. But I'll bring those up, Mr.
Chair as we get more into the
discussion on charter schools.
>> Mr. Chair Senator. I would
love to have more detailed
conversations with you about these two
topics around home homelessness
and charter schools. Maybe you
can, I would love to get some details
and, and try to be as supportive
as we can to come up with a plan to
mov'e forward to support both those
areas. >> Ok. I'll be in touch,
Mr. Chair, Mr. Secretary. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator. Um
I've got a couple of questions, some that have
been touched on, but I might
expand a little bit.
First one is
in the Ozzy Martinez. Everybody
talks about the literacy but math
was a bigger concern. Uh
You talked some about some of the
math issues. Do we have a
structured
math initiative?
Are there good
research based programs
out there? Where are those as
far as implementation?
Uh and particularly
colledge? I think uh
Representative Garrett talked
about our colleges of
education,
preparing people to
be math teachers on day
one and then also concerns
about the alternative certification
programs, some of
which are entirely online.
Where are they getting
math instruction and
professional development
types of things so that we don't have
retrofit once they're in classrooms
that we're doing it on the front end,
>> Mr. Cherry. So yes,
there's uh much work
being done around uh
both math and
science and stem areas
of of instruction.
Uh We have a wonderful team
that is continuing to improve
that for high quality instructional
materials. We're also looking
at providing uh the badging
system badging is that the right word,
the micro,
micro credentials. I I
apologize and this is
really specifically to give that
specific uh professional
development in these areas so that
they can have uh better
teaching outcomes. Um
And so again, we've
talked a lot about
um structured literacy and
what that looks like. And this is, this
is a, a program that's
been able to come down to us. It
doesn't quite
equate to math. So we're
developing many of those programs
now also, uh
we are working with
every one of our higher
institutions across New Mexico.
Uh What some of the work that I am
able to do along with Secretary
Rodriguez is we
are aligning uh coursework
across New Mexico for every one
of our institutions. Uh
This is really gonna
allow for us to have that high quality
standard, whether you go to
Northern or State or
UN M or Highlands,
whatever that May be. Um
You're gonna be able to have
access to that high quality
uh uh pathway
in teacher preparation
programs. Of course,
we are requiring uh
structured literacy to be part
of those programs. Uh so
that they have that in
as it as in that teacher
preparation program. So they're much
more uh prepared when
they get their own classroom. We'll
be doing the same work around
math. Uh
There are some, of
course you talked about
the alternative uh processes
in the online schools those
continue to be improved
also. And uh
also working with those,
those uh
online programs,
those are going to be held to the same standard
as the in person programs that we
have in which we will be
accrediting those programs across New
Mexico.
>> Thank you. Uh Because
recently I had a conversation
with someone who was finishing up
the teacher leader
program at New Mexico State,
which as you know, is my local
one. And I
asked
an a program they never mentioned
structured literacy. They
never even mentioned Aces
or trauma informed
care. They never mentioned
community schools or
administration of those.
Um
very concerned that
our preparation programs are
preparing teacher leaders
who have to do these are gonna
be doing these things and it's
never part of the curriculum
or discussion. And
so just the
accrediting overview
as to whether that's actually
happening in classrooms
or whether Yeah, yeah, it's
on the paper but we don't really do
it type of things. And I think
the same concern with
the math ones and
particularly the
online ones is I don't
know how you can teach structured
literacy through an online
program rather
than actually practicing it
in real life. So just kind
of please keep close
watches. We accredit that
those are actually
happening on
the ground in those
programs.
Um
Mr. uh
Secretary
a little while back a year or two ago,
we talked about paperwork
reduction within
education. Where are we
as far as reducing the number
of reports that are being
required of our
districts and charters
and, and others. I know we
kind of had a big push start and
then it looks like that's kind
of flip frittered away.
>> Uh Mr. Chair, let me start
with that answer. I might turn it over to
uh Assistant Secretary Frostad because
a lot of this is around uh
his area when it comes
to data and, and
uh infrastructure around
technology, uh much
of the work we've done around
Nova. And of course,
um the system is being built
into that is to make it that much
easier, more efficient
and uh allows
for less repetition of
work. And so,
um representative Moy, I did
point out this is, this is, you know, this
is the first year. So there are, we're
working through some of those bugs.
Um Every time every iteration
of this has gotten much, much smoother
and we'll continue to do that to next
year. Uh I remember
when Stars was put into effect, we had
some of those same uh issues
when Stars was put into effect.
This is a big system that's really
going to allow
for that more efficiency
of, of time and
paperwork, which is now a lot of that
is, is electronic,
but uh Secretary you want to add
to that. Sure. >> Thank you, Mr. Secretary
and thank you Mr. Chairman. Um
This is, this is an area
we, we have been working
on and would love to continue to
partner with LES C
on in particular,
um, last
interim, I believe it was, we
sat down and talked about some of the
reports that were required.
Um The definitely the,
the most of the
reports that are required are required
by State statute.
Um
And we would
be, again, pleased to,
to look at what
maybe,
um, Members
don't need to see
as much anymore and we could
remove from State statute.
Um We, and we prepared to
report on this, um,
during the last interim as well. And
again, we're, we're pleased
to continue to work and
to make, uh,
inroads in this area because
we, we definitely don't want
to be, we don't want to be working.
We don't want schools to be working on
data that's no longer
necessarily needed by,
by Members to make
good decisions, make good policy
decisions.
>> Thank you. And you know, if
there is a list of those
kinds of things, there's going to be a whole
lot of new Members in the legislature.
Those might be some nice bills for
them to carry that. Just
remove a reporting statute
that is only there for,
you know, that somebody has to comply,
but nobody ever reads that, you
know, there were a list
of, of some of those that you
all see. Uh,
certainly I think you'd find this
Committee and others interested
in, in getting those off. We think
that by putting a reporting requirement
on there. It provides accountability,
but that's a false accountability.
I think if it's not really
used for anything.
Um, certainly there have been some
discussions about the unit
value that was set
at, you know, there was a 5.1
increase, but only 3%
or so is being pushed out.
People are very concerned. I'm getting
lots of calls from districts,
uh, just as far
as getting that money out
the door.
So we just a comment
there. Um I would
hope Secretary,
you know, we've talked a lot about
concerns that we're,
or at least I put out always, we're
a wealthy State yet we seem to
be doing education on the
cheap. Certainly,
if you could carry to
the Governor and administration
about fully funding
education instead of
trying to do, get as much as we
can for as little as we
can. That would be
very helpful as we're
moving forward and would
certainly encourage partnering
with Les C. And we've got an
amazing team of
professionals back here
who can assist in lots
of these areas on getting
things done. You know,
please let's work
together to, to fully
fund education
in the State and to get things
done. Uh because
I think we're all frustrated when we
see how much money there
is, that's being put off for
25 years instead
of meeting current needs
and, and trying to get those things
fully funded. So would
appreciate and I think the LES
C staff is happy to work
on trying to get that as we're
setting up early budgets to
present to the LFC
on how do we fully fund
education instead of uh
doing, getting as much as we can
for as little? Um And
my last one
is,
you know, would like for you all to
think as we do as well of
how do we fund the real
cost of transportation
rather than some districts
have to support it out of
other things. And I don't know if
that's a,
some sort of a mechanism
of a reimbursement
mechanism for real costs
rather than putting it into the
budget and then there's not enough and
people having to, to find
other ways of doing things.
So just, you know, put a
couple of things out there. I think those are the
things that I had on my list if you'd
like to respond to, to any
of the other things.
>> Uh Mr. Chair, thank you for all all
those comments. I, I agree.
Uh we and, and absolutely,
I think you summed it up. Well, I, I, we,
we need to work together in a
partnership to make sure that we can
fully fund public
education. I know that we can solve
the issues of transportation.
I know Les C has put a
lot of time and effort and a
lot of the brainpower from the
individuals behind you around
that. I'm also looking
forward to collaborating in that
area. Uh within
the public education department, we've
talked a lot about really doing
um specific studies and audits
around that. Um so
that we can see what the different
uh plans are across the State.
Again, 89 school districts,
uh they all somewhat
sometimes have a different approach to
how they set up the routes,
how they, what their buses look like
where their students are. And
so this all plays
into a bigger plan. So,
absolutely, I'm looking forward to that continued
partnership so we can solve that
issue.
>> Thank you, Secretary and I very
much appreciate you being here always
and very open with your,
your uh comments and
things and, and the as
we mov'e forward, we're trying to, to
make sure things are always good for
our kids. And I think that's
your focus. That certainly is our
focus. Um
And the more we can
partner together as
we, we try and get education
fully funded and get policies
in place to make sure it's, it's right
for, for our kiddos,
which also means the future of New
Mexico. So thank you
so much.
Um
And I will take a very short break.
Uh We are about
half an hour behind
schedule, so we'll quickly
transition to get uh
Tim up here with
data dashboard and website
overview and then break
for
lunch.
Yes,
you
know
>> this.
Yes,
tell
people.
Yeah.
So.
>> Mm
>> OK. Tim, tell
us about our new redesign
of the district >> dashboard.
Good morning, Mr. Chair
and good morning Members.
Um I, I, I'm
gonna start off uh
with some introductory
slides uh to talk to you
a little bit about sort of the
vision behind this. Um
As I'm talking through this, I would
encourage you to pull out a
laptop or a personal
device uh to,
to navigate some of this stuff.
Um Unfortunately, our we site
isn't live quite yet,
but I will show you and walk
you through the development site
and show you the new
functionalities and
then I will give
you a link to our
dashboard which
is live and you can go to right
now and you can start navigating some
of the data on that
dashboard
before I begin, I want to
just express gratitude
uh in a couple of ways. First, I want
to express gratitude to
Gwen uh and
her leadership. I think
uh she has uh hired
some extra analysts and
put aside a
role for me
on the team to really dive into
data stuff, which I think is going
to be very great.
Uh I think it's going to lend
a lot to the analysis that we do
over the course of the year. Uh
I also want to extend gratitude
uh to the rest of the team uh
for allowing me to step into
this space into a support role
to help everybody with some of the
data in their analysis this
year. And I hope that we
prove to you that uh that we're
capable of doing some really high
quality analysis.
And that helps you during the
Session as you're considering budget
and policy.
Uh with that, I'm sorry, we're behind
tab eight in case anyone
needs that.
Uh
So, so let's just
dive into uh
sort of the the high
high level why we
need data, right? And
we we use data at LES C
to do data
driven policy making.
And so here's a quick
slide for you. A lot of this is from
the data quality campaign
and it talks about the importance of
high quality data
for various stakeholders
throughout education.
Educators need data to guide
instructions. School leaders need
data to build schoolwide instructional
supports. Community
partners need data to
understand gaps in education
sys services and to
tailor their out
of school time supports and their
their opportunities.
Families need data
to make decisions about
children's educational journeys.
But legislators
and our target audience
here, we need data
to evaluate the impact
of investments or not
the money that you have invested in the
education system is
making progress towards meeting
the state's long term goals.
Uh a little quote from the data quality
campaign right there on the side,
states need data infrastructure that
meets the needs of all of their
education and workforce communities,
including educators and institutional
leaders, students and families,
local and State education, workforce
agencies, policymakers and the
broader public. So that's really
what we're talking about today. Data
that works for
everybody.
Uh The public education department
who you just heard from has a couple
of roles in data and a couple
of bureaus related to
data. Those two bureaus are
here on the screen for you
and on slide four, the
assessments, research evaluation
accountability bureau or
area sort of this
new amalgamation of their
assessments and their research
evaluation accountability team
into one
bureau. Uh and,
and, and that the roles of
that bureau are to
provide assessment uh
literacy and to provide
technical assistance
on assessments, to
analyze and publicize
assessment data, to
use assessment data and graduation
results and assign those school
support designations that you
heard about those T
IC SI and
MRI schools and
then use those designations
to make awards to schools.
So the money should follow
those designations to
support uh the
the interventions that they need
to, to improve their
performance.
On the other hand of things you have the
Information Technology Bureau
and that's the side of pe D that's
working on project Nova and all
of their data systems.
And the, the job of that
bureau is to validate school
data submissions to store and
warehouse data to make
sure that their uh their
SI S every school
districts si S
interfaces with Project
Nova and that they can
use that data and share
all of that data on the PE D
website.
And then there's sort of this unspoken
role and responsibility
uh right in the middle there that those
two bureaus need to be in constant
communication and constant
collaboration with one another
to ensure that the data that's
coming in is also getting
posted on the website. It's also
reliable for our purposes
so that we can use it. And
then it's also getting shared out
to the
public
Les CS role. Your
role in all of this is to
use that data and to
study the issues in public
education and build a
consensus, right? So
we're studying issues all
year long. We're coming up with a set
of Committee endorsed Legislation,
we're coming up with an education
budget. Uh So that
uh we, we
have consensus around some of the issuess
that we've been studying. Uh
And we can rely on the data that
we've used to do that.
Uh And so this
continuous cycle of
adaptive policy making, you heard
a little bit about it yesterday as
Gwen was talking through the
work plan with you all. Um
but we have moved, I guess
officially with your approval
of the work plan, we've moved to this
dark blue bubble up top
to the red bubble. We're we're
past our planning phase now
and we can start on some of this
research, this analysis,
this gathering of stakeholder feedback
from the community. And
then we can use that to
tailor budget and policy
proposals. And then once
those budget and policy proposal
proposals are enacted,
we can evaluate the results
and then it goes back into planning
again. So it's all
cyclical and it's all
reliant on having good
data to do this type
of analysis.
And once again, a reminder
of the research agenda
or of all of the topics that we
cover at LES C uh
from educator,
workforce student success
budget, education, support
services, whole child equity,
technology assessment, accountability,
governance, and capital outlay. All
of those things have this
through line of
good high quality data
underneath all of them. And so
that's sort of the role that I'll be
playing moving
forward in the interim is providing
high quality data
analysis to support
each of those
uh
each of those priority
areas and each of those topic areas
that our staff are covering
for you.
And some of you might have seen this
slide before. But we have talked
about how uh student
outcomes lies at the center of
all of the investments that you've been
making. Uh the family
income index, community
schools, structured literacy,
K 12 plus CTE
teacher residencies, teacher
mentorships. Uh There,
there's a through line through all of
that, that is all of
that is supposed to improve student
outcomes. And when we say student
outcomes, we don't just mean
proficiency, we mean
differentiated outcomes
different ways to, to show
that students are growing and
changing uh that
students are able to find
jobs or have a career
or go to colledge after
they finish high school. So
that's the nuance in, in the
type of analysis that we want to provide
to you so that you can make
better informed decisions.
And uh sort
of that's, that's sort of where we're
headed for the next
interim.
So with all of those topics
in mind, I want to take a moment
to walk you through
uh how we have
restructured our
web page uh
to
be more focused on the topics
that we're covering. So
once again, this uh the site
is not live
yet. But
when you go to the LES
C website, here's what
you'll see.
Maybe I'll zoom in a little
bit.
Uh The landing page has sort of
a static image here of the Capitol
and a little blurb about LES
C what you all do and what we do
as your staff for the
Committee. Uh And,
and you can see those uh
blue
headings at the top. Those are sort
of the new way that we've
structured the website. Uh
If you go back, if you
scroll down a little bit on the landing page,
you can see front and center.
These are the main
publications or a set of
main publications that we have produced
for you. Uh The
quick guide and the post Session
review are those two
recent most recent publications
which you'll get access
to uh today.
Actually, we've got uh
during the director's
report.
Uh One of the problems
with the old website was
that the we,
the way that it was organized
was very difficult to find
staff work and very difficult
to find some of the analysis that,
that we provide for you. So that
if you had a question, you'd have
to ask us where to find it on the
website so that we can find it for
you. Uh Or if you had a
constituent who
was coming with the question, uh
we, we would have to
provide that answer. So
one of the purposes
of this redesign is
to make sure that the public is
better able to navigate
the website, better able to find the
work that you all are
seeing at these meetings
without having gone to the
meetings themselves. So
uh
the
one way to do that is this new bill
analysis page which will show you
every bill that
les C analyzed
during the 2024
Session. There's a drop down here that
you, you'll be able to set, select
which Session you're looking
for a bill. About. Uh
another way is this
briefs and reports page which
we have redesigned to
uh hopefully not
be so focused
on the meeting dates or
the date that all of
these publications
were
uh
in front of the Committee, but
rather uh be
focused on topics
so that you can take a look at
everything related to educate
workforce in one
place. In
addition to this sort of an
uh the
organization of the publications
there, we've got a new way
to organize and once again, this is a
work in progress. So this will look a
little bit different when it's
done. Um But we're gonna have
every annual report, every
post Session memo and every work
plan for the, the past few
years just right here on one
page for you so that you can have
that in addition to having the
most recent ones on the home
page,
uh the big change and,
and sort of the major restructuring
is here under this education
topics, which I'll blow up a
little bit on the screen for
you. Um This is that
that topic slide that I just showed
you every topic and every
analyst at LES
C is in charge of one of
these topics that,
that we're covering this year
will be listed
here.
We'll go to educator
workforce
just as an example.
A little blurb about the
importance of the educator
workforce. A contact
name for Annie, uh
the analyst in charge of
our educator workforce
block, a
brief description of the interim
priorities or in the work
plan that you all approved
yesterday. And
then a list
of recent publications related
to educator workforce for about the
past five years or so.
Uh So this, this is really
designed to say, I
want to know everything
that Les C les
C has done related to, let's
say data and technology.
My my block, I want
to know everything Les C has done
related to data and technology
for the past few years
is right here on the data and
technology page.
Those are the main changes
to the website. Everything else here
is about the same. Your Committee
information hasn't changed. This is
where you'll find information about
upcoming Les C meetings.
Then about Les C, we've got an
overview. Uh We'll
post uh employment
or uh uh
roles that are open on
our team here
or in a full directory
of everybody that works at
Les C under the about
tab.
So that is the
website
redesign.
>> Yes. Um First, I was
just telling Gwen, you're
amazing in that
you're here navigating this
on the thing while never losing
a beat. I have to stop talking
to find what I was doing and then go
back. So it's I
just was very impressed,
Representative
Garrett.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Tim.
Very exciting.
Um on the
topics.
Do you have to enter
those
manually?
Like, I mean, we just
talk Senator
Lopez was talking about charter
school governance.
So everything has to be
entered
or
>> what one of the hopes
Mr. Chair and Representative
Garrett, one of the hopes
was that
we would have an improved search
functionality with this too.
Um Once again, work in
progress. Uh A
huge shout out
to Kayla Stan at
LC for all of the
work that she has put in on this.
Um She's doing it solo
and she's been working on it
for a couple of months and she has to deal
with us coming back to her and telling
her, well, actually, if you change
this a little bit. So
um I it
is a plan to
have an improved search
functionality so that you want
you when you go to the list of
publications, you can just type
in some keywords and get and get them up
there. But uh for now, sort
of knowing what topic you're looking
for is sort of the best way
right now to do
that. >> And
one more question Mr. Chair. So is
this the new
address, the WWNM
ledger.gov entity les
C default? >> That that is
the Mr. Chair and
Representative Dear. That is the
current address for the LES
C site. It, once this goes
live, it'll just replace
the current website
that's up right now.
>> Ok. >> Thank
you.
>> Now,
other questions from
Committee,
it very interesting
and exciting. I'm looking, it's like, oh
my gosh, that would be so great
because now I kind of look up
agendas and things and
not quite sure where to find
other things. And it's like,
yeah, sometime in the past I remember
we talked about and
it looks like it's gonna be much
easier to find data and
information and doing it on the
fly. Some when we're
in committees come
January as
well as other times as you indicated.
I often have people ask me about
something and it's like, well, let me see if
I can find it and I'll get back to
you and sometimes I do
and sometimes I don't and sometimes I
just defer them like you might
find it here and,
you know, see you, this will be much
more uh
effective at getting
actual information to
people, other questions,
comments.
OK, great. Sorry. >> No,
that's, that's all right, Mr. Chair.
Um So, so that was the,
the, the website redesign.
Now, I want to spend a few moments
walking you through the
dashboard. So on
this slide here, this will have a
new URL for
you. Um I'll leave this up
on the screen for, for those of you
who wanna visit it right
now. Uh and just give
you a little bit of background about
um the dashboard
itself. So Gwen
yesterday said that I built
the dashboard in one month, which
is kind of true,
but she's also over selling my
abilities a little bit.
Um This, this has
been about a year in
development of
uh and, and the very first
step that this was,
was over the last year or so
building a database
for LES C staff
so that we have all
of our education data,
everything related to proficiency
rates, attendance,
graduation, uh
finance, all
of it is in one place on our Les
C drive that
everyone can access
and uh that,
that took about a year to get that
in shape. And once that got in
shape, we started being able to use
it for more fun stuff.
Uh And so one
of those fun things that we did was
was build this
dashboard when
I first started at Les
C uh one of
my, I was an intern back in
2016. 1 of my
roles was building
fact sheets for you all.
When you would go out to communities,
you want to know everything about a school
district that you're visiting.
Um So we
built these fact sheets that had
all of the data about
a school district that we had access
to. Uh and
we would put it in a sheet
and uh that took a
lot of manual effort
of around copying
and pasting into Excel and
doing all of that. So we
got Tableau and we started
doing a dashboard with Tableau
that we could print out for
you. And that took a lot
of sort of manual finagling
as well. So finally,
we got to a point where it's like we have
all of this data, we
have it in one place on the drive.
Let's build something that we
can share it with all of you in
a more reliable
fashion and that everybody
in the State can
access as well.
So this is the landing page. You'll
have a little dialogue that'll pop
up that just tells you
to get started.
Select a district
here. Um
Gwen had this idea that I, I
could walk you all through some research
questions as
I was uh presenting
this. And so I came up with
some research questions. And then
yesterday, uh during
the work plan conversation,
you all asked a bunch of research
questions. And so now I
get to use the dashboard to walk
through some of the questions you asked
yesterday and it was less
work for me.
Um So
the first thing that I
I
asked here is sort of to give
you a
uh version of
this overview
slide is I want to
know everything about Los
Lunas, the district that we're
in right now. Uh I want
to know just basic overview
where are the schools in the
district and how many
students are in the district and what are
their demographics? And that's all on
this first overview
page here. Uh You
can use this map here to sort
of zoom around the school district.
You can see that there are 18
schools within this geographic
area and I'm
sorry, let me blow it up a little
bit for, for you all.
Um And if you
click on the map, you can zoom in
and see exactly where those schools are
located. And
if you click again, you can
see co located schools.
So you can see that here.
The Los Luna Family
School is Colo
with Valencia
Elementary, right?
If you zoom in here
and a
little bit further,
you can see
sort of where we are in the
district. So right across the Street
from us is Los Luas Elementary
and then just down the road from us
is Raymond Gobal Doon
Elementary. So some
information about the map of the school
district. Uh You
can see some of the enrollment
uh data
that the superintendent was talking
about this morning. Actually, you can
see about 8500
kids in the district for the past
few years. Uh in
fy 20 sort of
drop in enrollment due to
COVID. Uh and
overall the enrollment, the
enrollment has declined about
2.9% over the
past 10 years, but it's actually
up 3
2.5%
since the end of
the COVID pandemic.
Some demographics of the school
district data down below.
This will give you demographics
by race and ethnicity as
well as those other demographics
that we pay attention to
particularly economically
disadvantaged students.
English learners, students
with disabilities. All
of those are here on
this uh overview
page.
Moving to the student assessments
tab
this is a
description
of all of the data that we have
regarding proficiency rates.
We've thrown on some graphs
here that might look a little bit
familiar about the percent
of students proficient by
uh the percent that
are low income according to the
family income index.
And then some charts that should look
familiar on the
achievement gaps. So
yesterday, representative baca
you you had a very important
uh caveat or a very important
question about data
broken down by
grade level or about
being able to
drill down to see
where changes in performance
are happening. So this little drop
down here at the top of this,
you can dig into that. You've
got elementary school data
in Los Lunas. You
can see about 38% of
students in the district are proficient
compared with the
statewide average.
Right underneath that. Let
me blow it up a little as
well.
This is your reading proficiency
right underneath that. You've got
your math proficiency
compared to the statewide
average. Los Lunas
apparently does well in
math and
in science as
well.
If you
pull that drop down down,
go into middle school, you can start
to see how that
changes at the middle
school grades and
then one
more time
the high school grades,
how does that proficiency rate change
compared to the
statewide
averages?
These graphs? Uh we used to
call them beating the odds graphs.
That's not what they're called here. But
that's sort of the purpose of these
graphs is to show you
the percent of students who are
proficient at each of these
schools compared to the
percent of those students who are
low income students according
to the family income.
Uh, each of these dots
represents a school and those
schools in blue
are schools in Los Luna.
So we can pull one up
here. And Parish
Elementary has a
61.4%
low income
and they are,
I'm sorry, 26.9%
proficient in reading. And
that is above that
trendline. So that suggests that
the schools are performing
slightly better than predicted
based on their
poverty rate.
And the same can be said here
for an parish in math
or an parish compared with
its poverty rate is far
above that
trendline for the entire
State.
Uh Finally, on this page is
the achievement gaps. Uh
Representative Garrett, you
asked today, how are you asked
yesterday how uh
proficiency
disaggregated by
uh students with disabilities?
Look. So part of the reason
that we do these achievement gaps is
to show you progress
towards meeting the goals in the Martinez
Yazzie lawsuit. And so
we've got a drop down here for each of
those Martinez Yazzie subgroups,
students with students with
disabilities is one of them.
You can see a wide achievement
gap and by the way, that's not
just in Los Lunas, that's across
the entire State. Uh
students with disabilities
tend to per perform
far below the
general education
students
in both uh sorry, reading on
top and math
down below
that.
Uh We can do that. We can do the
same for graduation
rates. Uh
Here is the graduation rate
over time in Los Lunas. These,
these are the full four
year graduation rates currently.
That's all we have in here. Uh
But then you can see that four
year graduation rate for the most
recent year disaggregated
by student subgroup. It's all
of those red bars are below
thew average or have
a graduation rate below the
district average and
everybody above that blue,
that bar in blue
has a graduation
rate higher than the district average.
So you can see, uh, students
with disabilities down here
represent Garrett, uh the
lowest graduating
subgroup in, in
this particular
district.
All right. Um,
let's stop picking on those lunas
and let's look at Rio
Rancho.
Uh We, we have
heard, uh
I think Superintendent
Cleveland has been very outspoken about
some budget issues that
Rio Rancho is facing for the
upcoming year. Uh So
if you have some general questions
about what Rio Rancho's
budget looks like here
is uh an
a
side by side
of what they actually
spent in fy 23
and what they plan to spend in
fy 24 their budget of
expenditures uh for
this past uh fiscal
year.
And you can see, uh
particularly in Rio
Rancho, the district
spends quite a bit of
their operational fund
on student transportation.
And that's something that, that
we showed for
you and uh, that transportation
report that we did for you last year.
Rio Rancho is one of those districts
that is hit by the density factor
and they have to pull money out of their
operational to make
their transportation program whole.
And so you can show that here
where as maybe a
district like
Gallup
doesn't have to pull quite
as much of their uh
transportation because that density
factor helps that
district
uh on
the sidebar here. Close
to those two, we also have
something to look at
districts cash balances.
So you can see over time
school districts that
uh accumulate cash
balances. This is something
that legislative staff have noticed
that you all have noticed. Uh
and that is something that, that we're
paying attention to uh
for our interim uh,
study is what
are we going to do with all of these cash
balances and what's a responsible way
to look at them. But uh
for now, we're just looking
at what the districts budgeted and cash
balance for the fiscal
year. And we're looking at that
compared to their overall
uh budget. So,
Gallup, you can see here
cash balance of $50
million and
that represents about
22.5%
of their overall
budget.
All right,
teacher workforce uh represent
Miraval Moya, you asked
yesterday or you made
a, a comment yesterday
about uh teachers leaving
the profession in the first five
years that they're there.
Uh So let's take a
look at uh we'll look at
Belen your district.
Um We
have uh an example
here of some of the data that we
have for Belen uh including
overall salary,
I'm sorry, uh average
salary for level 12 and three
teachers compared to the
statewide salary. So you can see
Belen uh has
about uh
11.2%
lower salaries
than the State.
But if you look sort of at the
overall average in Belen.
Uh it's about half a
percent lower salaries
than the rest of the State
on average. Uh
These histograms here
are meant to show you
the age of teachers and
their license level. So you
can see a bunch of level one
teachers down here,
uh from 20 to about
40 years old,
you can see level two
teachers start to happen
around 25 years
old. And
then you can see level three teachers
start to happen around 30 years
old and
they extend throughout
the or sorry throughout
the age distribution
there. You can also
see the number of teachers
by years and license
level. So you
can see years of
experience here, sorry.
Um So the
here are your teachers
who are have 0 to
1 years in the classroom.
Uh You can see a Majority of
teachers that we have data
for show that they are
uh have 0 to 1
years of experience
and they sort
of taper off
pretty substantially after
that. I think
this is also a good
uh opportunity
to tell you all that. This data
doesn't quite look right.
Uh And that is,
that is a problem
and that's not a problem that
we have an answer to at LES
C. Uh the data
that we're we've collected and
compiled for you. This is all data
that is shared by the public
education department and this
is data that we use
to, to
set the budget every
year. This is data that we
uh rely on when
we, we are trying to estimate
what it's going to cost to
do salary increases,
for example. Uh
And so at or when we
are looking at the TC
I and the funding formula
that TC I calculation
is built based
on the years of
experience of a teacher. And this
is the data that we
have on the years of experience.
It, it just seems wrong.
Uh So, so
an opportunity to put
data out there is also an
opportunity to gain feedback
from districts for districts
to come to us and to go to pe
D and say, hey, the data
that you have on us is wrong
and here's how to fix it. And
so that that is sort of another
goal of getting data in
front of districts is to gather that
feedback about what might
not actually be
correct.
Uh Finally, on this uh
tab, you've got
some graphs here
that look at the demographics
of teachers compared
to the demographics of students.
So in, in Milen, in particular,
uh you've got a Majority Hispanic
population, 80% of
students are Hispanic. Uh
20% of students are
Caucasian and a very small
2% up here. Native
American that compares to
the teacher demographics,
54% are
Hispanic, 40%
are Caucasian down
here. Uh 6% are
Asian. So
the this this graph is really
based on some research going around
that uh that suggests that
teachers and, and you heard this
from the Secretary uh earlier
today as well. Uh Teachers,
students learn better
from teachers that look like them
in terms of, you know,
gender and ethnicity
as well. And so here's, here's how that looks
at the gender level, about a
5050 split for
students. Uh in terms of
male and female statewide,
this is the case, there are
just not that many male teachers
out there, the Majority of teachers
are
female.
All right. Last one, I
promise. Uh
Representative Frere is not here.
But she sent us a question yesterday
about uh facility
conditions and her question was
related to the conversation
that we had about uh whether
we're gonna need to,
to uh replace
a bunch of schools all at once. And
so uh the, the que
the the data that we
have on school facilities is compiled
by the public school Facilities
Authority. They
calculate what's called the
WN MC I or the weighted
New Mexico condition index.
Uh And you can see a list
of that uh schools
that have a higher WN
MC I are in poorer
shape. So
Belen High
that uh school
that we were talking about yesterday
or that superintendent Sanchez was talking
about uh
the
WNNC I for that school
is about 57.4%
which suggests that the school is in
poor condition and is about
ready for repair or
replacement.
And one of the reasons is that it's
old.
Yeah.
Uh so, so Mr. Chair, I will just
briefly touch on
um a few
of these last slides. Uh
The, the, the
dashboard is really
in a, in a State right now
where, where we're trying to get
some information in front of you
to make some quick
decisions. The,
the data
that we put on the dashboard,
it doesn't answer any
questions. Actually, it sort of
raises a lot more questions.
And that's, that's true for data in
general is that
you can use data to answer
some questions, but really
data is best used as a
flashlight to highlight
how to best answer
questions and to highlight
the next steps for
research. And so that,
that's really what the purpose of that
dashboard is that if you
have some broad questions about
how many students are,
are economically disadvantaged
in my district, uh You can
take a look at that here, uh
some deeper questions about what do
we do to help outcomes
for, for economically disadvantaged
students that's going to
require some, some deeper
analysis. And and
we'll get into that throughout the interim
for you a list of
the current functionalities. That's everything
that's on that sidebar. But
in the future, we want to
build out the the dashboard
to have some more State level data
for you all so that you're
not just looking at district by district
data. We also want to be able
to drill even deeper, to get to
the schools themselves
and to, to look at some
of the, the performance nuance
by school. Uh
I, I have this vision
and I think it would be really cool to
cut the, the
data by legislative districts
so that we even if
you're in Albuquerque, you don't have to
look at Albuquerque wide
averages. You can look at just
your schools in your
legislative district,
uh or if you are
in a, a legislative district
that goes into two
different school districts that you
can have data from both of
those school districts
to, to rely on
when you're making decisions.
And then the last thing that we want
to do is build this out with some of the
work that we're all that we're doing
throughout the interim.
Um Part
of that is measures of student
growth. We want to make sure that students
are growing academically over
time. We want to show you the
impact of those programs that
you're investing in like
community schools, family income index
structure literacy, all of that
we want to put
on here some sort of
explainer on
school calendars and
learning time and how those
might be contributing to student outcomes
as soon as we're done with that program
evaluation, Annie
is working on a an evaluation
of class loads
and we want to sort of add that
to that educator, workforce tab
and make sure you have access to
how many students per class
and at what grade levels?
Uh And then uh Jess
is doing some really great work
with the strategic data project
at Harvard on really
understanding differentiated
measures of student success.
How do we understand whether our
students are successful beyond
proficiency beyond
graduation? Uh And
we want to add some of that work to the
dashboard as well.
Final note on
education data governance.
Uh This is
something that, that we've
put on the work plan and I'll,
I'll, I'll be working on throughout
the interim, but you
all should know sort of what
that means and uh
what it exactly I'll be
working on. Uh You,
you heard that from
Secretary Romero that they have,
they are taking data governance
seriously uh within
their agency and that's really good.
It's a great step uh to
be sure that they have some sort of
guiding questions and
strategic governance
over why they're building
data systems the way they are.
Uh what, what I think would be
another step in the right
direction and what, what I plan
to work on over the interim
is bringing in
other agencies as well.
So we've got a longitudinal data
system that's just
been kicked off at
the higher education department.
We have an early childhood
identification system,
EID at the E
CE CD. Uh
So we, we want, we, we see
these data systems being
developed and we have a lot of great
people in the State who work on
data, but we
also them being developed in
silos and
nobody is really meeting
in a coordinated way to say
these are the questions
that our data systems should
answer. And
this is the way that we need to
build it to answer those questions.
And so what we're really
looking at here is a formal
data governance structure
and some of the
reasons that that
other states have have adopted,
this is that it facilitates
and stream lines work on data systems.
It builds shared goals. Uh
It builds a formal structure
for cross agency data
decisions. Uh It
clearly defines the roles
and responsibilities of everybody
involved in the process.
Uh And then it
could really streamline some of the
work that's happening on, on things that
you've invested in like the
longitudinal data system
that just really, it's
been, it's been a while to, to
get that stuff rolled
out. One
more. Last note, Kentucky
is a State that does this and does
this really well and we'll be digging
into some of that as well.
That's it. I'm
done.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate
the opportunity to
>> just a couple. I have a question
or two. We'll get to, to some of the
others. But how's data get
updated? I mean, is it
have to be manual? Is it an
automatic when there's new data
that it repopulates
>> Mr. Chair? Great
question. So the data
with that is
inside our dashboard right here
is uh publicly
available data from
the PE D website.
So when pe D posts a
publicly available data
file, I download it,
I transform it into
something that communicates with our
system and then it's sort of
automatic from there.
>> So how do you know when they've
done a new one or
do you just check it every once in a
while? I mean, it would be
nice if somewhere in the future
when they
update new data that it
just automatically
repopulates, I don't know
how technically difficult that is
to make happen. But
>> Mr. Chair extremely
difficult actually. But,
and, and the reason for that is
that uh pe D sort
of through
all of their leadership changes
and through all of their staff changes,
um the way that they
format those files changes
every year. And so it does
take sort of an outside
eye looking at it to make sure
that the file can
be read into the system.
Uh Ideally long
term uh
goal would be to
have universal
format for all of these
files that sort of
feed into that. Uh
We were hoping with
project Nova that
that would be sort of
the outcome of project Nova that we
would be able to access
uh district data
reports and that the the
format of those reports wouldn't change
every single year.
>> Thank you. Yeah, it just seems like
a almost a full time job for
one person just to keep up
with, you know, each change,
you know, every day, there's another little
change I've got to go in and find and,
and make that. So,
Representative
Buck,
>> thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you
Tim. You know, um
what I appreciate about this
is the access to data when we're
talking about making decisions
and we're talking about much
of our policy. What
people don't understand is much of what
comes out in the Session actually
has its roots here. And
as we're the more informed,
we are regarding the
data regarding the need,
the better we're able to not only
appropriate but also
legislate to support
our schools. So I I appreciate
that. So Mr. Chairman
Tim um
the question I have is you said this
is public to all. So including
school districts. Is there any
special
uh
as far as logins required for
school district or does everybody
have the same access to
this >> uh Mr.
Chair Representative Baca, it's online
so anyone with the URL can
access it
>> and
well, and, and my question, my
reason for that is uh Mr.
Chairman Tim, is
that what I appreciate
about it? Is all the data is compiled
here in the other systems,
you have to kind of go back and forth
between systems and
platforms. And so
uh what I would also
respectfully ask
is that school district charter schools
or whomever that they
be informed of that, not
just saying it's on our website, but
if there's a way we can communicate
it, I think
parents,
staff, teachers,
whomever would have that. So
I would just respectfully ask if
there's a way to
communicate the
existence of this site
to our school districts. I think
it'll be a great resource for all
parties involved, but thank
you for doing this. Thank you for
pulling this data. And I, I would like to see
that every inter meeting
for the LES C that we look at
some area of
data, you
know, based upon that topic.
>> Thank >> you, >> Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Representative
and I think our director
has a comment.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
Representative Baca.
Um We will endeavor
to share this um
in multiple ways with the school
districts. Um We
really honor communications with
them and I think that's a great suggestion.
This is also for you to
share with your constituents.
Um So that it benefits
you as well.
>> Thank you. And, and kind of a, a
comment that you made, Kim
and I had heard recently in another
uh area
data doesn't have an opinion.
It just is. No,
it, it, it doesn't mean
one thing or another. It just
is what it is and, and
having that unless it's
incorrect, but even then it doesn't have
an opinion, it's
incorrect.
Um Representative
Moyer,
>> thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you,
Tim. I love this
dashboard. I, I, because
I'm, I'm a data person so
I like to be able to
see the information, look it up
myself. I don't usually
rely on other people. I would
rather see it myself. So I love
the fact that it's here
and it's all and for all schools.
Now, my question is, um is
it just like leas
or is it charter schools also?
Do you have all of that information
or is that harder to
>> get
Mr. Chair? Represent me on
the current
functionality is just
districts and those
districts have their
local charters pulled out
of them. And so when you're looking
at a total, it's
just the district
um the, the future
functionality and we hope within a
couple of months that, that be
extended to schools as well.
And when we get into schools,
that's where we start to
like build specific
functionalities for charter schools as
well. Uh Part of the reason
that, that it is that way is just
the, the
architecture behind all of it
made it difficult to
say if it's a charter school,
pull up these charts,
if it's a school district,
pull up these charts charts
instead, right? Um There's
some things that we just can't look at
at a charter school level.
Um I think
the like the
map is probably a good
example of the charter
schools one point on a map rather
than a large
geographic area, right? And
so we might not want
to make the map the same
sizes as a
district map, right? We might
want to shrink that and give you other
useful information about the school
on that landing page. So
future future
functionality, but certainly within a couple
of months.
>> Um Thank you, Mr. Chair Tim.
This is, this is really amazing
in your one month getting
it done. Um
But uh but, but I, I
really, I really appreciate
it because so many times when we're
talking, not only to our
constituents, but we're talking to other
people. Uh you throw
out values or,
or, or data and
it really doesn't mean anything unless you
can show them that this is
what I'm actually talking about
because from what I've
learned, even in all of my
colledge care, anyone can find
data to, to, uh,
support their, their point of
view. But if I can show
them what this actual stuff,
then that's different, especially
when I'm looking at the
cost of what it would replace
my high school, which,
uh, uh, Senator Brandt
says, why is it?
So, uh, uh, such
a high percentage. And I was like, because it's
old,
it was old when I was there 30
years ago. It was
old when my sister was there 50
years ago.
So and
and it needs to be
replaced. But thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative uh Senator
Lopez.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you Tim.
This is beautiful. This is
wonderful, so much
needed.
And um you know,
Mr. Chair, this maybe could
be a template for
some of our other committees.
Um interim committees to look
at um health and Human
services, interim Committee, there's a whole
bunch of other potentials.
So I think you
May
um sparking
something to come
further and just one more
question, one thing um in
in your list of
information,
maybe at some point to
include
resources
because if the public is
coming to look at
it, they can
see all the data but maybe
they could help
with some information.
So it could be some resources
that maybe we refer to
Mr. Chair as Committee and such,
maybe some other,
you know, work that
we use.
Any, you know,
any whatever that
name, any Casey Foundation
or some of the other places that we
usually reference to that come and
do um you know some of
the work that we utilize to. But I
think at some point,
maybe some references because I think
that would be also great for the public
to be able to click on. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator. Other questions,
comments
again, Tim. Amazing.
I wrote down some notes. You probably
ought to be getting called to go
present at N CSL
Education Commission of the State
CS G West
because I don't
hear about other states having
anywhere near this level of
access to data
in such an easy
to, to find. At
least I wasn't here clicking,
trying to keep up with you. That would have been a
fool's errand, but it,
it appears easy to, to
click on find and, and
keep up with the data
uh and wonderful and also
that other committees that we
don't want to lose you out of les C
but be beware of
what you've created because
it's pretty powerful. So,
thank you so much. Uh
I do believe we've got
lunch is available.
We are scheduled to come back at
115 which is
about 40 minutes or so.
If we're all staying here and
able to do that, that will get
us back on schedule on
time. Tim, thank you for
the, the wonderful work and,
and working with the rest of the team
on getting all of the, the
information in both
dashboard, both sets
from the districts to also
the, the legislative
side of things and you're,
you're such a resource
for us all. So I appreciate it. Thank
you. We're adjourn for lunch.
