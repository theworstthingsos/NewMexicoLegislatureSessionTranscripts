add one additional requirement
for each regional plan.
Uh, and the requirement is that
regional funding priority. And
if you're a member, a region
could have a number of different
priorities. I think this was a
very good suggestion, so there's
one entity that's in charge of
reports, uh, that requires that
each region also report on
recommendations on successes,
gaps and needs to better provide
behavioral health services, but
Madam President, I was simply
going to give a brief lesson on
what a concurrence is for all of
the new members.
So for everybody that doesn't
know what a concurrence is when
in this particular case, the
sponsor of the bill said, yep,
this is good, we concur.
Uh, but the sponsor could have
said no, we don't like it, and
voice vote when it's not all
friendly, then we have to fight
about it, but this one's all
friendly, so I completely
support uh the concurrence.

correct?
A statute that requires
The prevention of waste and the
protection of correlative

reasons.

There's no way to notify the new

the risk every day I get up and

They're gonna determine that.

and they know the reward. Thank
you, Senator. Uh, Madam

Eddie County. Why was not San

particular bill.
Um, Madam President, you know,

major oil company is here. Most
of them have moved out of Conoco

the corner of McKinley County.
Uh, you want to make sure that
you treat those exploration
rails, you treat the rest of the
state differently, but when you
where, where that is. The rest
of the state is a little bit
risky. You're gonna take a
gamble. You don't know if you're
gonna hit, you may hit, you
don't know what it's gonna
produce, but in this area of the
state, we know this produces.
many small and independent oil
dealers have left the state in
the last, let's say 5 years.
Madam President, Senator, we
won't have that, have that. We'd
have to ask the independent uh
business as a result of.
The increased taxes.
And difficulty it is to to stay
here.
I know particularly one who's
actually left the state, um.

I guess the other question is

And I just wanna finish with a
final note here that as you
know.
And Senator Madam.
If you want less of something.
You tax it.
If you want more or something.
You incentivize it.
We think it's going to bring
more revenue to the state.
by taxing it.
It's gonna do just the opposite.
Thank you. Any other debate on
the bill, Senator Woods, madam.
Um
President,
heard in this debate, uh, Madam
President, when we bid these.
We evidently get money, I mean,
think that is less productive.
I'd like to know what some of
those bids have recently gone

to say, Madam Chair, Madam
President, because, you know,
Can I at least get an idea of

depends what, who owns it and

Just wanna make a couple of
points. I know the time is
short, but this is um.
I mean may go down as the, the

main charge is to increase.
The amount of income that the

We don't trust you to make smart
For every $1 in royalties that

that's the relationship we have

Thank you, Senator Calle goes to
Madam President, Senator, I just
want to give you a little bit of

live, uh, I think.
If you go into Lee County, we've
got some really outstanding
facilities because of the local
economy there and oil and gas,
uh, I leave my house around 4:30
Madam President, uh, senator is
that uh there are peripheral
areas around the lines that you
have here that are going to
Texas and I'm concerned that
they'll be, uh, more.
that affected me and I've not
heard this year, Madam
President, Senator, and I'm just
wondering if you've had any
discussions, Madam President,
Senator, about any discounts to
looking at any of the miners
that are actually New Mexicans
and what this does to him, Madam
President, Senator.
Madam President, Senator, yeah,
we did look at that, but that
would violate the enabling Act.
Thank you for that, Madam
President, that's senator, then
if you look at the difference
between Texas and New Mexico. I
there's gonna be a lot of
damage, uh, going forward as we
take this bill forward. So with
that I'll yield. Thank you,

Madam President, it, it would
totally depend upon the lease

that, it's gonna be very

since 1970, we have not raised

they're called ducks, and they
will drill those and they will
