Julia, are you gonna start us off or is Mark
gonna start us off?
Ok.
>> Yeah, I'm sure
you know,
sign.
>> Ok, good afternoon.
Uh Mr Chair members of the
committee, my name is
Julisa and
I'm the LFC analyst for the
economic development block.
Uh Today, we will be doing a
legis with the economic
development department
um And I am joined today
by acting Secretary Mark
Roper and um
director of the Office of
Strategy Science and Technology,
Nora Sackett.
So I'm gonna kick us off and I'm gonna
go through our staff briefing
that's on tab
I and it's gonna look
like our regular legis
that um
I'm gonna go through the brief and then I'll pass
it over to the
agency um to
share their
presentation.
So the focus of today's
legis is
um on
um Ed D's
efforts to support
their science and technology
target industries.
Um So
those industries are
aerospace, intelligent
manufacturing, cybersecurity,
Biosciences, and
sustainable and green energy.
And these are five of their
nine targeted industries that
they've, that they've identified
in their strategic plan
as um showing growth
potential in New Mexico
and as well as um
increasing our economic
diversification.
Um However, these five
industries uh represent
or make up
6.7% of
the state's total
employment.
Um
And you can see that in chart
one on the first
page of your legis
um three of these industries,
cybersecurity, Biosciences
and green energy make up
0.5% or
less of the state's
total private
employment, aerospace
and intelligent manufacturing make
up a
more. Um So yeah,
so that, that's the focus of this legis
that is Ed D's efforts to support
these industries.
So a little bit about how we
got to this legis that
um
so
econo Ed D's strategic
plan, they've identified these targeted
industries. Um
And then last month in
grants, you heard an
LFC analysis from our
economists on
the industry clusters.
And in that analysis,
we identified that
the education and knowledge
creation uh cluster
as one of New, new
Mexico's largest clusters.
And you can really think about that cluster
as like the universities
um research organization.
So I think the labs
um and that, that
kind of space. Um So we're
pulling from both the strategic
plan and then our recent
cluster analysis
um for this legis and
that's why we're focusing on those
five target
industries.
Um So a little bit about how we
evaluate these industries,
we kind of focus on three
measures that's um
competitive advantage,
wages, and regional
diversity. And that's how we look
at these different industries
and their kind of growth
potential in New Mexico.
Um So starting
off with competitive advantage,
that is basically
how much uh industry is
growing in New Mexico
compared to the
national industry rates
or trends. Um
So going to
page two, that's
the first chart you can
see that these industries have
grown an
average of like 18%
in the past four years.
So it is pretty significant
growth. Um
However, when we compare that
growth to national
trends, we
will see that aerospace
and intelligent manufacturing
are actually growing at a slightly
slower rate than the
national industry.
Um On the flip
side,
um
uh the other three Biosciences,
cybersecurity and green
energy are growing in a
slightly faster rate
in New Mexico than the rest of
the country. Uh which
would tell us that in those three
industries, we have a competitive,
competitive advantage.
Um And just like
just to kind of reinforce
that the competitive edge in
New Mexico is driven
by our labor and
capital, which are things that we
can influence with
policy.
Um A second metric we look
at for these industries are
their wages. Um
And in chart two, a
page two, you can
see that the average wages
for these industries is
90,000,
which is
57%
higher than the average wage in New
Mexico. Um So
again, one of the reasons we want to focus
on industries with high wages
is because it's going to
increase our state
per capital
income as well. As
qual quality of
life. And
then the third metric we look at when we're
looking at these industries is
their regional diversity.
Um And that's on chart two
on page two or sorry,
chart three.
Here you can see that intelligent
manufacturing and Biosciences,
78% of their
employment is
in Ben Leo County
while the other three have more than
50% outside of Bern
Leo County. And one
of the reasons we look at
employment and like regional
diversities because we know
that um investing
our like state resources
in industries that are
pre predominantly in distressed
labor markets will improve our
long term
employment. Um
Research suggests that
a job created in a distressed
labor market is actually
going to increase long term
employment by 80%
more than a job created in
a healthy labor
market.
Um So that's a little bit about
the data of like or how we
evaluate these industries.
Um Next, I'm gonna be
talking about Ed D's efforts
to support these target
industries. Um
So the agency has a variety
of tools to support these
industries. Uh You
have Lida Jtip
and then of course, the
programs and grants that are
supported and administered by
the Office of Strategy
Science and Technology.
Um So
Mark or the acting
secretary will show more about the
office and those programs.
But um that office
recently launched two
pilot programs
to award non
funds to
um energy innovation
and commer commercialization
um And on page five,
that top paragraph, you'll see some
of the recent awards that were made
out to certain
projects.
Um Then you also have Lida
uh which the agency
administers. And
on the bottom of
page two, you'll see a
chart with the past
two year of LITA awards
that were specifically made out
to science and technology
target industries. And we went
through and how we got that.
We went through the past
LI awards and looked at their
employment codes and matched
that with what's in the
agency um
strategic plan.
Um So roughly in the past
two years, 52 million
went out to those agents to
those industries uh
which represents
roughly 39% of those
awards. So 39%
of L
awards in the past few years have
gone to these target
industries.
Um And then finally
on or sorry and
then with that funding,
um those leader awards at
50 52
million um will
support roughly
581
jobs with an
average
salary of
56,000.
Um And Edd estimates
that the average return of
investment for, for those
projects is
37%.
Um in
terms of Jtip,
um we looked at Fy
23 Jtip Awards
and of those awards,
99% of them
went to Ed D's
Target Science and
Technology Industries,
which is just showing that
Edd is supporting and
focusing on these, on these types
of um industries
And then finally, just on
E D's recent
appropriations to the agency
to support um
the science and Technology.
So the legislature and you all have made
pretty significant investments
into the agency
to support these industries.
Um starting even
just when the last, last
session, uh
the agency in total
received a 31.2%
increase in its recurring
funding. 500
of that was for
uh positions targeting
these target industries,
um as well as 5 million
in recurring funding that was
initially tied to
the Climate, energy and water
Unit. Um And
although the legislation did not
pass, um, EDD will
share about its plans
and how it's going to use that recurring
funding for
that kind of same
purpose.
And then I'll also just point your
eyes to
page three that first
chart. Um This is
tied to a 50 million
appropriation from
two years ago for
advanced energy. And while a
lot of that funding or a portion
of it was earmarked for other
agencies as well as 20
million for border
planning, um 7
million of that is, was set
aside for advanced energy
grant programs. Um
So these are just a couple of the
efforts that you all have made
or the appropriations
investments you all have made
to the agency to support the
Science and Tech
um uh
kind of like a
block. Um
I'm now gonna pass it over to
acting Secretary Mark Roper
and Nora to
present their stuff.
>> Thank you very much, Mark
and Nora, you can go on. >> Thank
you.
Thank you, Julisa.
Um
members of the committee,
um I want, I want to
start by
um introducing
uh our, our local
support here.
Uhrin Gamboa
has recently been hired
to be the uh uh
director of the Carlsbad
Department of Development, their
local Economic
Development
Organization.
Uh Kristen has a long history
here in New Mexico. She
is uh worked with the New
Mexico Partnership.
She has worked in the
village of Los Luas
and most recently worked
for the public service
company of New Mexico uh
helping them in their
economic development strategies.
So I'd like to ask
Christian Christian to stand up
so that you can
all see her and,
and welcome her to our new
position here in Carl's
Bed.
Uh If you want to go ahead
and take a look at
the short
presentation that we put
together, uh I heard
the chairman loud and clear and
I didn't want him to get his shredder
out. Uh So
we, we kept our presentation
short uh
and to allow us plenty
of time to answer your
questions uh in reference
to the legislature.
But on, on the
second slide, the, the
1st 1st thing
on the left hand side,
you're going to see what, what we
really say is. Thank you. Thank
you to you, the new Mexico
legislature.
Um You, you've
recognized the, the
efforts that we've, we've
done as Julisa
just pointed out a very substantial
increase in our budget.
Uh And we just really
truly want to say thank you.
Uh We appreciate it.
Uh And we're going to continue
to work hard uh
and not disappoint you with
that with that.
Um On, on this
first slide, we talk about
the, the half a million
dollars that, that we
got for previously
unfunded
positions.
Uh and where that, where
that money is going to be dedicated
to. Uh So,
uh the previously unfunded
position is this
wonderful person sitting next
to me, the director uh
of Office and
Science and Technology, Nora
Sackett. Uh So
now that uh now that we've
had this funding, uh
her position is
now in a permanent
position and will
continue to be funded
there. Uh We
also are, are going
to be adding to our wonderful main
street team and adding a main
street specialist uh
to the team
and we have a previously
unfunded position. That was
the food and hunger agricultural
specialists that is
really helped in our, in
our egg industry and really
helping our,
our small
producers, our, our
small farmers and
ranchers, helping
them get their
product to market
and also working
with uh local
and, and
people like uh such as
senior center schools
and those and helping them get
access to locally
grown
foods and,
and improving, not
only uh
the economics uh for
the local farmer, but also
improving actually,
uh the
schools ability
to, to feed their Children in
a more healthy manner.
And then finally, uh
with these uh
with these new positions
comes additional
paperwork. Uh
And so we, we are
uh we previously had
a temporary
administrative assistant
that will now be able to
uh put into a permanent
position. So again, thank
you. Uh We, we
we will be adding those, those
four, those four
positions uh
to it if we move
on to
the next section,
um I'm going
to
steal Juli's
microphone
so that Nora, so
that Nora May, may help
me. Uh because
we're going to go, we're, we're going to
talk about the new recurring
funding
and
the plan we put together for
this fiscal year.
Uh Now we, we understand
that uh this funding
is beyond this fiscal year,
but we really think we need to get a
strong base
uh behind where this money
is going to go on a true and a
good understanding of where
we need to go into the
future. So
you'll notice that the five
the, the first one on
the on there
is the uh asset
analysis of this five
specific industries
that we're talking about. Aerospace
bioscience, uh
advanced computing,
advanced energy and,
and uh water
tech. Uh and
what that $750,000
is going to go towards
is we're going
to put out an
RFP to
do an in depth analysis
of each of those industry
sectors to help
us really truly
understand what our assets
are, what our
needs are, what our opportunities
are. And
to really have
uh get a
deeper dive into our strategic
plan of what we need to do
to move those, those
those particular sectors
forward. Uh
The plan is to
get these RFP S
out as close to the beginning. Of
the fiscal year as possible
and have them back uh
in time by
the end of October, so that we have
them into next year's budget cycle.
So we have those true answers
to put into our strategic
plan. So we can have
uh so we can have that in
uh for the
legislature to understand where we,
where we want to go
into next year's
budget.
And I'm gonna turn things
over uh to Nora
now to go over uh
the the next few
sectors uh on,
on this slide
three.
>> Thank >> you, >> Acting secretary.
Thank you, Acting Secretary Roper
and thank you, Mr chairman and
Committee. Um
The second line item on this
list is the second
pilot project pilot
program round of the
uh research university
team pitch award.
Um That is a new
initiative that uh the
first iteration is uh
currently underway.
Um That was
originally designed by former
Acting Secretary
John Clark.
Um
There we go. Um
And really designed to
bridge that gap,
both encourage
um researchers
and innovators at New Mexico
Universities who are
developing new
technologies to take
that leap of faith out of the
university and to commercialize that
technology. Um
When that happens, there is a quite
a big gap that we call the Valley of
Death uh where
they often fail.
And uh the intent of
this funding is to
provide a, a parachute
if you will for that leap of faith.
Um And to
assist them in really
establishing in a business
here in New Mexico that's
going to commercialize
that technology um and
eventually create jobs and expand
the state's tax base.
Um The third item
is a
pilot program
contract,
looking at two
initiatives, we're going to start these
with an RF I to really
gather some
industry
information.
One thing that I work on
frequently in this role
is identifying gaps
for science and
tech start ups that
are going to be the
next large
companies that, that hire
hundreds of people here in New
Mexico.
And we often
especially due to our,
our strong national
labs, we have start
ups who move to New Mexico
from other states just to work
with the labs. And we want
to capture that
and make sure that they are
staying here, thriving here, creating
jobs here.
And one of the things that
they really
lack is a
mechanism to
guide them through all
the processes of
doing. So. So uh
whether they need to find
an office, whether they need to connect
with a variety of people.
So really looking at a kind of
wraparound services,
navigation on
a contract contractor
to complete that work for
start ups in those target
sectors for oss
t the other
aspect is a carbon concierge
pilot. This is really building
on
the
bill that this funding
was originally tied to
the climate division bill.
We have a lot of
firms here
in New Mexico who want
to
implement measures
to decarbonize to be
having a lesser
carbon footprint
in their work in their
business. Um and aren't
quite sure how to go about that.
So we would like to
uh contract with folks
who do know how to go about that to
connect them with those businesses
that um often
Edd and our community
business and regional develop
team are already working with
every day. Um But
that's just not a, a knowledge
base that we specifically have and
to be able to provide that as a
resource to those
businesses um
which also
then leads to greater business
for more New Mexico businesses who are
doing that decarbonization
work. Uh
The fourth element
is um funding
for a competitive
programmatic deployment
for a quantum
ed a tech hub, which
is a, a lot of
words. Um but
what that means the
Economic Development
Administration is
currently running a tech
hub uh funding
opportunity at the federal
level. New
Mexico is in a partnership with
Colorado for a quantum
tech hub quantum computing
and quantum sciences.
Um We are finalists
for that we should be hearing
any day. Now,
New Mexico
is
flies
under the National radar a bit when
it comes to quantum technology.
I previously didn't
fully understand
what a um
sector leader New Mexico is.
We were the first state to have a
phd program in Quantum
Sciences, Sandia
National Labs and Central New
Mexico Community College
are developing a nation
leading quantum workforce
development program which
is critical to everything
we do. Uh
workforce and
quantum is
really in
the science and tech uh
universe scene is the next
big thing frankly. So we really
want to get ahead of that train
um before it leaves
the station without us and
particularly
capitalizing on our national
labs and our universities.
Um And we already have
um I recently met with a
quantum start up that wants to move
here, specifically wants
to headquarter in Albuquerque,
specifically work with
the labs. So we
acknowledge that that is a
unique opportunity to
capture more of
those entrepreneurs and businesses
that want to come here and create
jobs here.
Um The
what is this fifth bullet point
here is
also really looking at
some
prior
conversations with the legislature
for the
growth of this office.
We would like to
contract with sector
specific individuals
to provide
targeted
guidance and consultation
to start ups and companies
in those sectors.
Um was
done sort of
previously in a an
iteration where had
innovation vouchers. It's
kind of the next step of that something
other States offices of
Science and Technology do as well
where they contract
with a subject matter expert
in that field so
that they can provide that
guidance specifically
to companies and
start-ups in that field
for them to grow and create
jobs here.
Uh Lastly
again, um building
specifically off of
the Climate Division
um legislation that this
funding was originally attached
to, um
we are looking to create
a competitive award
process for
pilot projects, technology
demonstration in
advanced energy and climate
tech. Um What we
often see
is uh
innovators
in this,
they need to be able to
to exemplify
their technology on a on
a larger scale in climate
tech and advanced energy. It's often
not not kind of a computer
science level done in
on a desk, in a lab. It
has to be done on a larger
scale, a pilot plant to
pilot an example
of of how the technology works on a
greater scale in order for it
to move forward. Um
This is also something a lot of
other states offer. And it's been
a difficulty for
us sometimes when we have
um innovation that was
born here by
New Mexicans that are from here and they
want to grow their technology
and grow their company here
and uh haven't had
state resources to be able to,
to do that. And so they have gone
elsewhere frankly. So we're
hoping to begin filling that
gap to be able to
provide some funding
for those pilot
programs and technology
demonstrations.
>> If you go ahead and move on to
slide four
again. Thank you. And because
of your support, here's
some recent successes that we
can talk about
and the
Chips and Science Award Act,
there were just 10 awards
made nationwide and two
of them came here to New
Mexico.
Uh about
two months ago, you heard that
Intel as
part of the $8.5
billion award for
projects uh
was part of the chips
uh funding
just this week. Uh
We announced that Rocket
Lab also known
as Solero in
Albuquerque, uh
was awarded
$23.9
million from
uh the Chips and Science Act
Award that will add
an additional 100 jobs to
their existing workforce.
Also the National
Science Foundation uh
Regional Innovation
Engine Awards
uh for
um
it's also part of the
Chips Act unm
received a $1
million on innovations
for water and energy
security.
Uh NTU received
it for advanced manufacturing.
Actually micro
factory, micro,
factory innovations and
the tribal area
uh received
nearly a million dollars
and also Space
Valley uh
received a million dollars.
And then finally, uh the
Department of Energy and Science
Grants, uh we received
five of the 50
awards uh were
made to uh start up
in 17 states and
6.3 million of that came
to New Mexico. So again,
thank you to your support.
Uh the money. We're,
we're leveraging that and
bringing those federal dollars
into the, into New Mexico
and creating uh
and creating new
opportunities uh
in, in New Mexico.
Mm And then
again, on the, on the final
slide that, that we'll
present today
uh something we've
implemented uh in in
this
administration
uh before under
lita uh we
had uh
items within our project
participation agreements, the
contractual obligation
of reporting jobs
uh and capital
investments. What we've done
during this administration is
we've started to make it an, an uh
requirement that the
companies uh
also submit to us an
annual report of what's actually
happening on the
front end. We, we
uh work with the companies and
they do their projections of what's
going to happen. If
they, you know, once they locate
or expand into Mexico, they're
going to do all these
things. Um But now
we're doing a, an annual
review of what actually
has happened. Is it
on track? Is
it ahead of schedule? Is it behind
schedule? Where, where is, and,
and, and where, where is it
also uh happening
additionally, you know, I, I
don't think everybody fully
uh understands
that when you hear the big,
the big numbers uh
of jobs and lita
and, and all the things associated
with the project that
it's not like we write a check
upfront uh and
say here's the money and go have a good
day. Uh
It's a reimbursement
program. First of all,
lead is uh and
so the companies have to first
expend the money for
eligible expenditures and
land building and infrastructure
before they can be
reimbursed.
And also we
have uh
developed a
mechanism within
policy and now within
rule uh that
those uh that those
moneys are
uh handed out upon
uh certain levels
of achievement based
on the overall thing, you know, certain
job creation, certain
capital investment goals
before the money is tran
out. So
it, it's not a blank check
up front, the money comes out
uh as they achieve these certain
goals,
um as
uh as it works that
when we do uh
make the award,
we, we encumber the entire
amount of money and
it is placed, uh it
is placed with the
fiscal agent uh to
be held for that project.
But in the event that the project
uh doesn't meet the
requirements, the money is
reimbursed
um back to
the back to the state
uh in the event that
they don't meet their requirements
contractually, then we also
have uh by statute
security in place in which we
can uh claw back money
that they have received.
Uh So this
is uh
one of the items that,
that we do now on an annual
basis. And, and
we've uh because
some projects happened
prior to the implementation
of this, of this
uh mechanism,
it, they weren't contractually
obligated to give us this
information. Uh But
we've worked with them.
Uh And
uh we've had a good working relationship
with the majority of,
of our active projects. And
so this year, we were able to
get reports back from
60 active leader
projects uh
to be able to assemble.
Where are we uh how
much money have we invested? How
much money are we proposing
to invest? And what
kind of return on investment are
we getting? Uh And
as, and as we look at
this information,
um we look at the
actual fiscal return
that's happening from this. We're not talking
about total economic impact.
We talked about indirect jobs
and, and those types of things,
we're talking about how
much money is
coming back into the
state city, county,
school district, special
taxing district coffers,
uh and groce receipts
tax, personal income
tax, corporate income tax,
uh property tax.
Uh So we, we look at the
actual fiscal
return. Uh and
as you, you know, as you
would invest into your
own 401k,
you look for a return on
investment and what these
numbers are showing us is that we're
doing fairly well with our, with
our L awards. Uh
if we look
against uh all
incentives. So we
also look at when we have
A I project, you know, how
much Jtip did they
get? How
much did they get in high wage job
tax credit? How much did they get in the
manufacturer, investment tax
credit? If it was rural, how much did they get
in a rural jobs, tax credit?
We look at all of those incentives
plus what they potentially
got through LITA and
we look at their uh we look
at the return on investment and you
can see the state getting 100
and 1% return on their
investment. If we
include all
entities, cities, counties,
special taxing districts
and schools, we have a
347%
return on investment.
And then if you look even deeper
to the money that's actually gone
out the door. So that's
uh the, the first number
is potential if
they access all of the money that's
been awarded to them. Uh
The next, the next level
is
how much they've actually
accessed. And as you can
see there, uh
it's substantially
more and then the
final two are just to
talk about just if
we eliminate all the other
incentives that we're
talking about, you can see the ro
I is, is then
substantially even even
greater. So again, thank you
for your support. It's because of
your support that we're able to do,
make these investments
and create these
opportunities for
New Mexicans to
improve their way of life.
Uh And thank you for the time
we're ready to
stand for questions.
Represent
pedigree.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair and thank you
acting secretary for the
presentation.
Uh I
guess we'll start with what you finished
on if I uh
Mr chair and acting
secretary, if I read
this page
five correctly, uh
Your first line item
return on investment against
all incentives
awarded
understate in New
Mexico.
If, if I do
my math for
every $100 we
invest, we get 100 and one
back.
That would be 100 and 1%
for return.
>> Mr chair members of
the committee. Uh Representative
Pettigrew. Uh It
would be $201.
>> Ok. All
right. We do math. Different
thanks.
Um
With respect to
some of the questions that I
had you answered a whole bunch
towards towards the
very end. So we are looking
at all the different,
different tax subsid
subsidies, everything
that comes back in with respect
to that
Mr Chair and acting
cabinet Secretary
with
I think we met in 2011,
2012 time frame.
And uh you were in
Roswell when I was in Lovington
and
we looked at economic
development
projects with
lead lita or Lugar
funds, however you want to call
it very
specifically and
how that money
came back and
what I heard and
what our clawback options were
and different things.
Sometimes we looked at quality
of life and we
didn't have a return
on investment. Sometimes we looked
at manufacturing and
we had very,
very specific return on
investments. And
if they didn't meet
that they
a loan
or a grant turned
into a loan
are, are some of the things
that you're doing that right
now from the state
economic development side,
looking at it that way? Or is it
strictly a complete
claw black back if
it, if at the end of three years,
whatever the terms are,
they haven't met their number of employees,
they haven't met their uh
the revenue expectations
or the verse receipts
expectations. Are
you
strictly on the clawback
side?
And what are your,
what are the expectations
and do some of those clawbacks
maybe? Or grants
turn into loans?
>> Mr Chair
members of the committee representative
Pettigrew every,
every projects
unique in itself,
but generally
speaking,
the
projects have
a defined start and end
date. Uh Smaller
projects are usually five
years, the larger projects
are usually 10 years
within that time
frame.
Um There are
certain expectations along
the way and
if they don't meet them, then
there is usually discussions
about, you know,
why, why is,
why is that happening?
And do you still anticipate
getting here
uh in, in
order to get there and
to the point that
not all the money goes out out front,
so they may not have received
all the money. And so we look
at where, where we are
against the amount of money they've
received.
If it's a case
of
closure,
which unfortunately does
happen in some instances, then
it's 100%
clawback.
There's, there's,
there's no question about
that if we
get to the end of
the rainbow,
so to speak, the end of the
fiveyear time frame
and they haven't quite met the
expectations and they
have either have or haven't
taken all the money
we look at where we
are
uh and know that
they're still here and they're still
a going concern, providing
economy to the,
to the community and to the
state. And then
we, we most likely
will look at either a partial
clawback or an
extension of the agreement to help
them get to where they need
to get. So
every, every project's unique.
So yes, there are instances
of 100% clawback
and then there are instances
of partial clawbacks
and then in most
instances, it's a matter
of reworking and extending
the agreement as long as they're
continuing to be an
ongoing
economic concern
for the for the area to help
them get there because, you know,
we we want them to be
successful and so taking
money back from them while they're still
trying to make a go of it is,
is not beneficial
to them. So we, we try to work with
them in order to make them
successful.
>> Thank you, Chairman and thank you
acting cabinet secretary.
So I appreciate
the response
in no case whatsoever.
Does the
grant turn into a
loan?
>> Mr Chair members
of the committee representative?
I apologize.
No.
In our current
in our current policies, they're
all grants with
security
uh held for the
purposes of clawbacks.
So, but, but
ultimately no, there, there,
there is not a loan
component.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Just a
couple more questions with
respect to that. As,
as
um
I, I skip that one first
um in
August of
2023
Governor Grisham
put a press release out
celebrating a billion dollar
manufacturing investment
for
maxium solar
technologies.
About two months after
that, Mr
Chairman
acting secretary,
the
news report came out that
the actual
um
the press release indicated
that there was a billion dollar
investment by the
company.
About two months after that. A
story was written on the
fact that that
billion dollar investment came
with about 600 million
in in subsidies.
Can you speak on
that,
>> Mr Chairman, members of
the committee?
Uh The first thing I'll
say is don't believe everything you
read.
Um
uh that particular
project um
is closer to 2 billion
in total capital investment
when uh when
it, when it's in, in, in full
completion.
And
yes, the potential
for maximizing
the total incentive
package which does include
industrial revenue bonds
and the, which
would be an absence of
property tax on that
on that facility for
30 years,
as well as the
other potential
incentives there
including
an $18 million
lead investment. If
they access at all
high wage, rural jobs,
I mean, high wage
jobs, tax credit,
manufacturers, investment,
tax, credit, etcetera. Uh
The the total
for a $2 billion
investment would be
600
million.
>> Thank you very much, Mr Chairman.
Thank you very much for your
answers. I'm
gonna sit back and hold
the rest of my questions and
listen to what everybody else has to
ask.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and thank
you for your presentation.
Um I was
curious
to
know about the
um it was actually on
page five of the
legat
uh briefing where
it says that
uh some of the research universities
received some
money and I
was curious to ask
if that was
750,000
to each
or 7700 and
50,000
total.
>> Mr chair members
of the committee representative
that was total.
So each
recipient in this
most recent round of
the Higher Ed Award received
about $200,000
for their award, which did
include an awardee from
New Mexico Tech as well.
>> Thank you for that. I appreciate
that. I was I'm
just so did
the money go to New
Mexico Tech or to
the entities
um
that are named here,
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
representative. It will go
to the
um recipient
itself not to the
university. Um
They will form a
business to
spin their technology out and
commercialize it and it will go
to that business. >> OK. Thank
you very much. I just know we
have the technology
enhancement fund that goes to
the university. So if it's
going to the individuals
and, and how do
Mr Chairman
and, and M Sacket,
how do they
um how do people know
how to apply for this
money? >> Mr
Chair representative.
Um we have folks
a variety of ways.
So um the Economic
Development Department puts out
announcements when we have
awards upcoming and when the
awards open for
application. Um and
my office does a lot of
work of within the
the science tech ecosystem
of putting the word out and sharing that
information with everyone.
>> Thank you for those answers. I
appreciate it. Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> One thing just on that point is
the Tech Enhancement fund. We put
75 million. Are
you guys awarding that money out of
there or is that HED that's
awarding out of the Tech Enhancement
Fund? >> Mr
Chair that's via HED.
There are um I
sit on the internal
committee as D's representative,
but it is not awarded through
Edd.
>> OK.
Represent
Hernan.
>> Thank you Mr Chair
and Um Mr
Secretary uh acting
Secretary, my question is
regarding the funding
under the leader program
and as I understand
the leader program, it is,
it's supposed to empower
community of
exceptional young leaders
from under resource
backgrounds to be
engaged in areas
that will raise the economic
development within the state
or city. And so my
question to you is why
are we requiring
of funding to
be reimbursed
as opposed to helping them
upfront? Is that
a policy that is made
by Edd
or, or please explain
that
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
Representative Herndon by
statute,
uh the Local Economic
Development Act
that we commonly refer to
as Lida is a reimbursable
fund that's by statute
and it is to
reimburse for investments
into land
building and infrastructure
by qualified
entities as defined
by the statute.
So the, the uh it's
a mechanism in which
to move public funds
into a private sector for
the purpose of economic
development. Uh and
only uh using
those funds for things that
will not leave New Mexico.
So the investments in the land
building and infrastructure,
regardless of
the ultimate success
of the company will remain in
New Mexico. It is
an exception to article
nine, section 14 of the New
Mexico Constitution that
we commonly refer
to as the anti
donation clause.
Uh I I believe the
statute you referring
to uh is
uh is
the Opportunity fund
and it is not as it
is not the local Economic
Development Act.
>> All right. Thank you,
Mr uh Mr Chair
and Mr Secretary. And then
I'd like to go to page
uh just for
clarification in
terms of a page three
of the presentation.
And you talk about the second
round of research
university team
pitch award pilot
program. Now,
the $800,000
that you have listed here
is for a second
round was in a different amount
for the first round.
>> Mr Chair representative know
that was the same amount that we
are currently operating. The first
round with
>> and then just for clarification,
Mr chair and madam uh
presenter uh
in terms of the
diversity of people who might
be at applying for this,
you talked in general
terms about how
the announcements are made
for applying for this
funding. How are you
also making
sure that you are getting a
diversity of
applications?
>> Mr Chair representative,
the applicants to this award
in particular must
be from
our new Mexico Universities
and so we work directly
with the teams,
especially the commercialization
offices at those
universities.
I think typically, you
know, they know their community
best so
they do a lot of work to spread
the word in that as well.
We did have a very diverse group
of applicants this
round.
>> All right. Thank you,
madam.
Thank you Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you. Thank you Mr
Chair. Thank you to our
Panel
House Bill 195.
Made it clear that
the opportunity Enterprise
fund should be used for
speculative buildings
not to pay for
mom and pop stuff.
And then also on the
questions on page six
about site readiness.
Um I'm really interested to
understand some of the
answers about your plan
for the funding,
additional requests,
how you um
determine who gets
it. And if
you can give me kind of a case
example, Nora you talked about
the location
of the quantum start
up. Um If
you, if that relates to
the site readiness plan, I'd like to
hear about
that,
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee uh Representative
Garrett. Uh
Again, thank you. Uh
There was the
additional half
a million dollars placed into the
budget to do a site
readiness analysis
uh of publicly held
properties. Um
So the, the
plan for that funding is
simply that we are going
to issue an RP
uh to get uh to
uh engage with the company
uh to do an
analysis of the publicly
held properties. We have currently
done an internal
analysis around
the state utilizing our regional
reps and our local economic
development organizations
to identify publicly
held properties
that are designated as a,
as industrial parks
around the state.
There's approximately
30 that
we've identified
and they will be part
of this part of this
study. Uh, what
we're looking to
get out of this
study is
to determine
how ready is,
is each individual
site? Does it have
power? Does it have water?
You know, and what, and
what capacities are
those, uh, does it have gas?
Does it have fiber? Does it
have roads or
is it uh in some
cases, just a piece
of dirt that we've identified?
It would be a really nice place to have
an industrial park.
Uh And the
uh the purpose
is, is to
a identify the
gaps.
And then b
probably more importantly
for this body is
what are the estimated costs
of bringing all these publicly
held properties
uh to a site readiness
status and
it's, and understandably
and, and we know,
and I believe the,
the sponsor of the legislation
knows that it's a big
number and we're not going
to attack it in one
year, but
identifying what those gaps
are and being able to
prioritize those
can help the body
of the New Mexico legislature
make those decisions.
And right now, it's just a
matter of somebody thinks it's a
good idea and we ask
for X number of
dollars without any rules. So
the, the, the ultimate goal
behind the study is
to really define the gaps
and identify what the
costs are.
And then I'll, I'll, I'll
let Nora answer the
second part of that question,
>> Mr Chair
representative.
So you asked about, for
example, the quantum start
up that I mentioned. And
if site readiness has to do with that, I
would say not so much at that
scale, typically
a very early stage technology
company like that, it's going to be
more about the
resources available
in a place for
that particular
startup's Sandia National
Labs and being able to collaborate
with them on quantum technology.
Um not as much
about the physical
infrastructure of a site at
that stage that might hopefully
come later as they
grow.
>> Thank you and just a quick follow up.
So then I understand
um Mr
Oper that you're really
looking throughout
New Mexico, not just the
Rio Grande Corridor,
but in our rural and frontier
areas, what the potential
is for businesses to locate
there? Am I correct?
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
representative? >> Yes.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
quickly.
When I talk to economic
development, people over
in my district,
they many times
talk about the available
workforce when
they're out there trying to attract
industry. And I
think of it as kind of
a a cross pollination
kind of a deal.
So how is the
economic development
working with other
agencies such as
workforce solution
and energy minerals
and natural resources
to to prepare a
workforce for future
jobs
in any
industry?
>> Mr Chair members of the
committee. Senator Senator
Woods. That's an, that's
an excellent question.
So,
um, I'm
gonna digress for just a minute
in order in order to have economic
development. The first two things you
have to have are water and
electricity.
Uh, if you don't have those two things,
then you're not going to have economic
development. But
beyond that, uh,
almost
exclusively
to any project,
the next question is going to be
about workforce,
um regardless
of its 20
person job or
a 2000 person
job. The question is going
to be the same and not only about
the number of available
bodies but the
skill set of those bodies.
So we,
we work uh we work
really hard, especially
with our higher education
community college
network
to help
because they, they seem to be
more nimble and, and have
the ability to
shift and
change curriculums in order
to meet the requirements of
of of an incoming company
or an expanding company that's
already there to
develop those skill sets. So
we, we work very hard in
that in that sector
with our community colleges
across the state
and in working with them
and developing the proper curriculum
to get the, get the workforce
ready and keep the pipeline for those
companies.
Additionally, with
the New Mexico Department
of Workforce Solutions.
Uh Part of our JTIP
policy requires
companies to work with the New
Mexico Department of Workforce
Solutions
to
look and identify
potential potential
companies and
also within JTIP.
Last year, we implemented a
new policy
to allow an extra
5%
for companies on a
reimbursement basis if
they'll utilize
either the new Mexico Department
of Workforce Solutions or an
independent third party if they
choose to
help them with recruitment.
And the reason behind that
was simply because
especially
smaller companies
sometimes don't really have the
hr resources
or the wherewithal
to truly understand how to
recruit people in
today's in
today's environment.
So engaging with either New
Mexico Department of Workforce
Solutions or if they choose an
independent third party
to help them,
it improves
their chances of hiring
good people that
will stay.
Uh So those are the things
as far as energy, minerals
and natural resources.
Uh I'll admit we don't have
an active
participation with them on
workforce development. We do
work that we, we do work
with them a lot
on, on technical issues
around their uh
around their regulatory
side, but not so much on workforce
solution.
>> I would like to think
that that
we have communication
between all of our
agencies
for years in
particular
because we're trying
to, to
incentivize
businesses through our
leader and the
JTIP programs
to come to New Mexico,
help them in their
training. But they have to
have like you say, many
times warm bodies
and sometimes I
wonder our workforce
solutions
group.
Uh and you're not, you're
not that agency. So I don't
mean to put you
on the spot for
that. But
sometimes I wonder how
much they
incentivize or,
or investigate,
are we
training,
are there qualified
people or,
you know, exactly
how they look at that
problem? But that's
another question for a different
agency. So,
I, I won't, I won't
hammer you more on that.
But I'm glad to hear that you
are working with higher
education
also. Uh It
would be an interesting fact to
see and I'm sure this is
not under your preview
either, but to
see how many people
we graduate
out of our colleges in the
tech fields
and even the medical
fields to see how
many of those
stay in New
Mexico.
And, and I know that
you don't know that right
now. But um
you know, we have state colleges,
we're spending a lot of state money on
them. And it just be
interesting to see
how many of those
graduates
stay in New Mexico, how
many, how many businesses
there are for them to go
to our jobs
opening at the time
of their graduation
are to see if they're being
recruited. And I know
that all that stuff
is high in the
sky and I apologize.
So thank you.
Thank you to appreciate
it. Thank you, Mr
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you secretary for the
presentation.
I appreciate the comments
on page four, the legis
that, that
suggests
prioritizing
our distressed industry
growth in our distressed labor
markets, which are often
the rural labor markets.
And one thing we have not
discussed today,
which I believe is still
sometimes an obstacle
is high speed,
reliable broadband
in those labor markets.
What part does that
play in the industry
growth, particularly the
industries we're targeting
in those labor
markets in particular?
And how does your office
collaborate
cross-reference
with obey to
um
coordinate
>> Mr chair members of the committee,
Representative Figueroa.
Um E
excellent question. Excellent
point F fiber
and access to
high speed is,
is critical to the success
of pretty much any
business in today's
world. Uh And
it's still a challenge in,
in rural
America and
rural New Mexico is no different
than that because we do have a
lot of, a lot
of space between people in
New Mexico. So it's, it's
definitely very much a
challenge. Uh We
do work uh We do work
closely with the
broadband initiatives
within the, within the
administration
to help identify
the places that, that uh
are in need.
Uh And to help
uh leverage
those, those
places uh that
are looking for potential
federal funding, et cetera
that are, that are available.
Uh In fact, just this
morning, I was working with a
potential grant
uh project for Valencia
County. This one just happens to be
in Valencia County, but uh
we've worked with, with
many of them across many
counties uh across
New Mexico. So
we're very active in that
portion of trying to help find
money and resources uh
for those for
those people. Uh
But you're absolutely right.
It's still a challenge
uh to
uh to a good portion of,
of New Mexico
and Post COVID.
Uh you know, more and more
people are looking for remote
opportunities. Um
because um
that pandemic
did open up uh
some eyes and some
opportunities that you can do a
lot of this work remotely.
Um But again,
it's a challenge in rural New
Mexico to have those
opportunities. And so we need
to continue to be diligent,
invest in the, in the infrastructure
and the resources to do,
you know, to, to expand
that.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank
you, secretary. So, water,
electricity,
workforce
and broadband.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I just
have a quick quick question um M
Rodriguez on thank
you for your presentation first, Mr
Rodriguez on, on the legis
sta on page
two
where we're looking at average wage and
science and technology target
industries, um
cybersecurity that
seems really low.
Um I just
remember Raja saying his were
100,000 or higher. So
I didn't, what, what are we
measuring there?
>> Those so these average
wages, uh Mr Chair.
Thank you representative. So those
these average wages were pulled
from um
some employment codes that we have
like quarterly census, employment
like records.
Um So they, those
are state
wages but they could be
slightly off. So we,
we can go back at those,
but that's what we pulled from
that source. >> All right, I, I
just thank you because that
was kind of an issue on how much, how
expensive it was or
the wages of cybersecurity
and trying to get them here and
come at the rate we're paying them. So
Roger said about 100 and 50
100 and 515 was probably
average. Thank
you. That's all I
have
>> there. There you go. Thank
you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you, Mark for the presentation.
I got a quick question
of a year or so ago. There
was $5 million
allotted to the power plant
when it closed down for
economic development.
And can you explain to me
how it all went to mckinney
County and Sebola County
didn't get any of it? And
what effect did it have with
Sebola County without
happening? It
was that legal
to do that or how did that happen?
Will you explain it to
me,
>> Mr Chairman,
members of the committee,
Representative Garcia?
Uh Are, are you
referring to the special
uh lito appropriation
that went to mckinley
Sa County? >> Uh
Yes, I am. Ok.
>> Uh The two
projects that uh that
were funded out of
that, out of that fund both
did happen to be in mckinley
County. Um
It, it was kind of
a first come first come
basis. Uh
There was, there was
no, no preference
at the same at the
same point. Uh That
doesn't mean that a project
in Sebola County uh is
still very much,
uh, available
and open to, uh,
potentially
funds.
>> Uh, thank you, Mr Chairman
Mark. I understand what
you're saying at first come first served.
But is that, was, is
that in statute, is that law
or is that something you guys just
came up with? Because I
know that the paper mill
got all that money,
you know, and it's in mckinney
County, you know, I know there's
a lot of employment
there to Sebola,
but the reality of it,
Sebola County didn't get anything,
you know, and we're struggling
with everything we're trying to do
because, you know, we lost everything,
we lost the power plant, we lost
the marathon oil.
And to me it's a little
bit unfair
for my county to
not get nothing. And
then you're turning around and telling me
Mr Chair first come first
serve, that's not a very good
judgment. I don't think,
you know, we need to look at
all people that are
involved that are
struggling because of this
and first come first serve is
just not the right word, I
don't think. And you know,
how did you come about that
judgment? Who made that rule that first
come first served? I >> guess,
Mr chair members,
members of the committee.
It wasn't, it wasn't
a rule that
was made and no, it wasn't in
statute. Uh,
you're, you are correct in the
fact that 5 million of it
did go to
save mckinley paper
who would have
gone dark because
of the shutdown of the Escalante
Power plant. Had it
not been for that?
And that was the savings of
100 and 25 jobs
that pay in excess of
$100,000.
Of which a
portion of those do work do
live, do live in
Seul County. A portion of those live in
mckinley County.
Uh, so it was a critical
investment, uh, into that
particular project.
Uh, although it, uh
may have only
created uh about
20 new jobs,
it saved
100 and 25
very high paying jobs
in a rural area, uh
that were in jeopardy
because of the shutdown of the
Escalante power
plant.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair
Mark.
What makes you think that they were gonna
close because they did not get this
$5 million. I know they're
getting steam off
the,
the power plant, but
they were in the process of doing their own
steam work to keep that
project going. You know,
just young
cop between a rock and a hard
spot because, you
know, my people
work in that power
plant. I mean, in that
uh paper
mill as much as people from
Gallup do. But yet
the same token
Sebola counties didn't get
anything so we
could make our part
of it thrive
like they are over there. And,
you know, it just concerns me
because I get that question
asking me all the time,
why did
Sebola County not get anything? And
mckinney did? And I understand
100 and 20 jobs, I appreciate
that very much. But
the reality of it, it would be
like giving Albuquerque
everything and giving
Bernardino right next to
nothing because Albu is
bigger. You know, it's just
hard to swallow and,
you know, when somebody
makes that kind of
decision
and then be some people
out. It's just, it's hard, it's
hard on
people.
>> Mr Chair members of the committee
represent
Garcia
um point
taken. Um but
it wasn't a, it
wasn't a conscious decision by
the administration at the time to
slight anybody. It
was a matter of
uh doing the best, uh
the best for an opportunity
that was
there.
>> Thank you, Mr chairman
and, you know, on, on
Sebola County,
uh we're struggling to get
anything, you know,
because the, the money is just not
there and it's on reimbursement,
uh, thing that you said
and uh
Mr Yarbrough down there is
struggling to get anything
going because we just don't have
the money and
yet there was $5
million there that when someone else
completely out of
somebody say, well, this
is a good judgment call.
It, it might sound good
but it's not good for everybody.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman
>> Representative
Dixon.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Um
And thank you for the
presentation. Um
A lot of my uh
questions and
excitement about um
what Edd is doing have
been answered. Um And Julie
said, thank you for the, the great
legis that um
summary uh and the
work that you're doing,
uh I
do actually have one question.
So I, I lied. Um
but
uh the last
item uh
in the legis sta
um or the last bullet
for the investment in science and
technology. My question
is uh what is
the status of the recommendations
outlined
in the agency's strategic
plan uh for the
industries discussed?
And so I'm just wondering if
there will, you
know, is an opportunity for
us to get an update on
the strategic plan.
If I recall correctly, there
were like near
term, medium
term and long term
steps and so it
would just be great
um
to, to have an update at
some point,
>> Mr chair members of the Committee
Representative Dixon, uh
excellent question and
part of uh
what was
done with the 20 year
strategic plan, which
was the first of its
kind uh
was to make it an active
living and breathing document
that it wasn't just a fiveyear plan
that sat on the shelf until the next
time it was to do an a fiveyear
plan. And so
we uh we actually
do a review on
an annual basis
uh of where we are,
uh what we've accomplished,
what we still need, you know, what,
what are still the goals
uh and it has
been completed and we can
get you a copy of
that uh of
that evaluation and
update on on this year's
annual report.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chair. Thank you,
secretary. That would be wonderful.
I think a number of us uh would
love to, to follow
along with the progress. Um
and then just
wanted to,
um you know, share
my appreciation for the work that
you guys are doing um
to, to really
strengthen uh
economic development and
diversification into other
areas. Um You know,
there's so much potential in this
state and I really appreciate
how thoughtful and deliberative
uh you guys are being with
the funding. Um
And so I just wanted to say, thank
you,
>> represent Garcia for a second
time
he's retiring. So, I
mean,
>> thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chairman uh Mark. I
just want to clarify. One
thing, it was
actually uh $9
million. It wasn't
595
million went to
uh the paper
mill and the
other four went to mckinley County somewhere.
Can you explain that to me >> briefly,
Mr Chair members of the committee,
the appropriation was $6.5
million. But you are correct in
your numbers that mckinley
County uh did
get investment into
their industrial park.
Uh That was, uh,
that was over and above
the original appropriation
that came from traditional
li
>> uh Thank you, Mark
that just uh makes me
even more concerned on
what, how this is happening
because, you know, uh Sebola
County got completely left out
and you know, the sad part
about it that I represent Juan
mckinley, Sebola, Beio Seor
Counties and
it just went one
entity and it is
concerning. Thank you. Thank you, Mr
Chairman. >> Thank
you. And just to continue that, could you tell
me where the industrial park is in
Gallup? The, the money was spent
that had to create jobs
in a certain amount of time
because
they have a plan
industrial part, but
there's nobody
there and there's no job
creation,
>> Mr Chair. Thank
you for the question. Members of
members of the committee.
Uh that is all part of
the site readiness uh
that we're, we're going to
be studying across,
across the state in order for
a property to be
marketable. It
first has to be site
ready. Uh And that
is uh that, that was
an amendment to the, that this
body, the New Mexico
legislature made to
lita to allow
for a horizontal infrastructure
uh into publicly
held industrial parks and rural
areas to make them
marketable and, and
ready for investment.
Uh So, uh
no, uh
today or, or at the time
of the investment, there wasn't anybody
there. Uh But now
that the infrastructure is starting
to become in place, they have the
opportunity to place people
there.
>> And, and do you know where that's located?
Is that the one at Carbon
Coal
>> Mr Chair members of the committee?
No, that, that is a privately
held industrial park
that's on Carbon Road
owned by the Gallup land
partners. >> Where was the other
industrial park? >> The
other industrial park
is,
it's, it's, it's,
it's north of Gallup is,
is,
uh,
is
if I got my directions
right? >> Why don't you find out
for me? Because the only one in the
privately held one
wasn't active or anything?
>> No, it was not.
It was into the public. It's
in the, the property owned
by mckinley County.
>> Yeah, I don't think at that time frame they
owned any property in there. I think they
recently purchased some. So
that's something we'll probably look at. I
guess your comments are
exactly right. Don't believe everything
you read, right.
Um So could you
uh break this down for
me? You
know, I forget who mentioned like,
why are we not retaining jobs
in, in New Mexico with college
graduates. Right. Because
there is no jobs for
them.
There's no jobs for
someone. I know a kid that's
graduated last year and
luckily got hired by
the, by the
labs at
$225,000.
But a lot of these young kids, there's not a
lot of jobs for them. Not a lot
of jobs when they go to school and
come out and say, well, I
got an engineering
degree in
aerospace engineering. I'm
gonna go to Florida or
Houston or
another state.
Where are we creating those
jobs for those kids in
those graduates
sectors in New Mexico? So
that we retain
them,
>> Mr Chair members, members
of the committee.
Uh that, that
is uh
a, a good question. And
b part of why we need to
make the investments that we need to
make in these very specific
industry sectors
so that we can
continue to grow
the economy in a non oil
and gas
way. If
we make those investments
and can create those
jobs and opportunities,
you, you
can look, you can,
you can look and so
see that unemployment
is down, the economy is
in a positive position
over and above
just uh oil and
gas. There's other
activities that are happening.
Are there as many jobs here as
we'd like? Is there as many quality
jobs here as we'd like to know
is the answer to that
question.
But in order
to, in order to do those things,
it's a competitive world out there, we
live in a capitalistic
society and we
need to, we need to compete and
continue to make the investments
in infrastructure and
in the industry sectors that we
want to see grow.
>> And I mean,
whether you can
go across every
aspect we've talked about today,
right dot Had
a 40% of vacancy rate,
right? Maybe those aren't
college educated
people but they're certificate
programs or something.
And we're trying to create those
jobs of mental health,
right? You can go through all
that and, and
that should go hand in hand with
almost economic
development, right?
If you take Gallup's almost a
perfect problem of
economic development is
you have a hospital that's
was gonna close in December,
right? When you,
you want three things, you just said
them, right? Facilities,
education, water,
electricity, the four things
you need and, and
gal misses on some of those, on
those points. Uh
When people start looking and
say, OK, if I bring in this labor
market of
50 people, right?
Where they gonna live, what's
the hospital like? What the schools
like? And then they say,
well, you don't meet three
of the points and let's move to the next
right criteria. It's
usually maybe a different
state. But on
lita, the
average 60 L
projects and the
average length is four
years. I've
seen a lita award for a
meat market in Santa
Fe for
350,000,
which is a high
end meat market,
right? It's not the
average person.
And how many jobs did we
create in that high-end
meat market in Santa
Fe? And
how much lead do we give them? And if
you don't know off the top of your head, that's
fine. It's just
>> Mr Chair members
of the committee, I
don't recall the exact
job number off of the top of my
head. Uh And
it is, and the,
the L award itself was
not for the front
facing uh
retail market that you're
referring to. It was for the
production side
uh to um
process and
handle the different
uh the different types of meats
that they are selling in, in
that, in that front and not only
in Santa Fe but in
but in other uh in
other markets and, and areas.
So the the money
was for the production
side of it. The actual
meat cutting and
processing of that, none
of the money went into the retail
facing, uh, spot
that you the, that you're referring
to. I do
not recall the, the
exact number of jobs
that, that were associated with
that. >> I mean,
Lida, I mean, when we
originally did it, it was
$50 million. Right. For,
for big giant project.
Maxion. Right.
To hear Maxion, we have 50
million sitting in the
bank and Lidas turned
into capital alley.
Four years.
We don't know exactly how many jobs
it creates. We
know that there's clawbacks that
doesn't happen. The glove
factory closed in
Gallup and everybody's pointing fingers
about everybody.
I don't think they ever reached the,
the amount of jobs for
Lida and then
the city and the county, whoever
participated, they're on the hook,
correct to pay back the Lida
because of the closure.
Right. >> Mr
Chair members of the
committee,
uh the average
length of of four
year, that's the average length
of the 60
projects that are active. Some
of them are 10 years, some of them are
brand new and only a year
long. Uh So that,
that is an average length
of those projects to
answer that question
specifically to talk
about the, the glove
factory uh
in mckinley County
at Church Rock. Uh
No, they didn't meet, uh
they didn't meet the goals
that was originally hoped
for. Uh
Unfortunately, you know,
um we,
they, they did not
uh, no, mckinley County
is not on the hook, uh,
for,
for the money.
Uh, there,
uh, there's
2.9 million
$2.92
million that was
in, uh, it was in the bank
that is never, that was never
distributed, uh, to
the company as part of the I
agreement because they never met those
requirements that you're referring
to. Uh, so that
money is sitting in the
bank, uh, and
will be reverted back
to the state of New Mexico
Lida li A
Fund uh
or uh to
D fa depending on
the origin of those funds.
Additionally, there
was uh uh
additional funds held
in security
that will be clawed
back and
also reverted back to the
fund. Uh
They, they did have
some
success.
They employed anywhere up
to 40 people uh
for a period of
over uh
over two years, nearly three
years. So there was some
success to the project.
Uh People, you know, for
a time frame, uh didn't,
didn't make money, didn't
pay property taxes to pay
personal income tax to generate
some groce receipts tax.
So, ulti
ultimately,
uh you know,
it wasn't successful
but the taxpayer
was not hurt, the money will
come back.
>> Yeah. Well, I think there I
RBS and every, every
other portion of
that. So, so there is a
loss when you include it all.
Did you say that some of these
projects are over 10 years
old,
>> up to 10 years old?
Yes. >> So, I mean, we're allowing
a longer time frame than
Kale.
I mean, if we're trying to create
jobs, a 10 year time
frame is not
what we're targeting.
I mean, we, we expect a
company Maxion is gonna
come in, don't you just tell
us Maxion came to you and
said in
what year I will be
operational and
start employing people
in what time frame am I
gonna start my construction
phase? Right? Because if
we roughly you said
600 million incentives
between city counties, state,
I RBS everything, right.
So what time frame did they give
you to do that?
>> Uh Mi Mr Chairman,
members of the
committee. Um
So first of all, on,
on 10 years larger
projects, uh
typically I have a 10
year, I have a 10 year time
frame because
uh
they're in an area
where you want to monitor
and understand
uh where the project is
going over 10 years, the smaller
projects are typically five
years in length. Uh
And uh
because uh because
they're smaller in nature,
uh specifically to
Maxion.
Uh That, that's a
project that was
uh uh when, when it was
announced, was anticipated
to take nine months
for engineering and
design. Uh
Then there was going to
be a twoyear construction
cycle. Uh And then
at which point you would uh start
employment, the employment
ramp was over a fiveyear
time frame to get from zero
to the total to the
total number. So
um it's a, you
know, big projects at that
or, you know, take time,
it takes nearly two years
to build the building sometimes.
Uh So you
don't get the immediate
impact, but ultimately
you will get the long term income
and the benefit.
>> Yeah, and, and that makes sense when you're
building a building. But some of these
give me some projects that are,
that are over the five
sixe limit.
Do you know any off the top of your
head?
>> II I, to
be honest, Mr Chair, I,
I don't know off
the top of my head, but I can get
you that information. >> They're not
billion dollar projects.
$100 million projects.
>> Well, they're probably 100 they're
probably in the hundreds of millions
of dollars. Yes.
>> And, and would you know where they're
located?
>> Uh Most of the 10 year
projects are going to be located
in either um uh
Albuquerque
or
Morus.
>> And then, so then if these are
some of these are going out for
10 years, how do you
justify all these numbers and these
percentage increases?
Then
>> Mr Mr Chair
members of the committee,
uh we
analyze where they are
today. How
many jobs have they created?
What are those average salaries,
what the capital investments they've
made, uh
etcetera. Um
We have spent a lot
of time going over the
model. In fact, we've even
sat with LFC staff
to uh to go over
the model uh to talk
about how, how we, how we
do these calculations,
we look at where they are
today, we look
at what incentives they have
received today.
And then as you uh as
you look at that, we also look at the
potential of incentives into the
future,
uh you know,
aga against that.
So uh that's
where we are. We look at where they are
today. Uh at the end of the
year,
>> this page five of, of
the investments and you, you just
have a return on them. All right,
for the next legis that why don't
we break them all down and say,
OK, the first
one which is just a bullet
point says 100 and 1%
return incentives on all
awards. We
want to know where that is
uh where they're located because they've
already received the lead
award
according to the way I interpret
this. And then,
you know, the one at
696%
that's one is very interesting
uh return because that's
gonna be either Intel or
a larger
company,
>> Mr chair
members of the committee. That's,
that's, that's the aggregate
of all 60 projects
the actual money accessed.
Um So Intel
will be one of those projects,
but it's, it's not
exclusive to that.
>> But if these are 60
projects, all
60 of these projects in this sheet
are already awarded and
completed, >> completed.
No Mr chair
members of the committee completed.
No, they're active.
So again, they could be in their
first year, they
could be in their second year, they could
be in their third year. Uh
They could be in their longer
time. They are active. Uh
We, we
a again, this is,
this is new. Uh
We didn't used to do this at all.
We are doing it now, we review
them on an annual basis to see
where we are on all the projects.
So this is where they are at
the end of the year, they're
not completed. Uh
There's probably
uh out of that
60 there's probably only
four projects in there
that would be considered completed and
closed. >> So
56 of these projects that
are scored are not completed
or
>> are not completed and
closed, >> so
completed and closed. I mean, they
met their leader and, and
they, you awarded the
money, >> right, Mr Chair?
That it would be correct, I
guess or, or the
money has been >> dig a
little bit into more of these numbers. I
mean, this is, I mean,
job creation should be
like Maxion.
OK. Give us a two year time
period. We know you what
your investment is going to be. We know
we're going to invest,
we'll wait the two years or
almost three years before you
really,
maybe even four. Right.
And that big of a project and
see, see where you're
at. But some of these other ones,
we should be able to close and,
and really gather up kind
of quickly. I mean,
you know, Lida turned in, it's
turned, it's cape now,
this is a cape list
that, that's
longer than capital, all
a, that's a 10 year
time period. Right, to close
out the books.
And we
always get to the end of the
year and, and all of a
sudden, you know
that Novem October,
November, there's 80
million in LITA. And
then on December
31st, when we start
ending the session, there's only
5 million in LITA
and we can
never explain those magical numbers.
So Janessa for the next
legat, let's really dig into these
numbers. Let's dig into
the Lita project awards and
time frames and let's
match them up to as, as
they go through the year, how much
they have? Mark, what
is your total amount sitting
in media that is
appropriated
to these projects?
>> The total Mr chair
members of the committee.
Um
We, we
have shared this information
with LFC staff.
Uh So we're, we're, we're happy
to get uh uh get
into that. Uh As
far as what the current
balance is going into.
Uh July 1,
it is $15
million.
>> Ok. And
Jenessa, I
mean, uh what is
the total that we've spent a
liter in these 60 projects.
Do you know that marker
>> I Mr Chair,
not off of the top of my
head. But I could, let's get,
I can get you that. >> Let's get that
number. I mean, at the end of
the day, everybody in this
room, we, we hire Ed or
whoever, right? We want you to create these
positions. We want to create these jobs and
then we come to you and say we want you to create
these jobs, right? And
we say, well,
if we invest in these,
we have to invest in four years in the
future before
somebody graduates their,
their maybe
a senior in high school,
right? And in
targeting these industries
to keep New Mexicans here
because it, there's
not a lot of jobs out there
for, for our
graduates and that's why they're
leaving. They're
young people want to go
to Austin Phoenix
wherever they want to go. L A
live a bit of life. But I mean,
the the job creation
numbers, how
many jobs did we create
through Lida this last year,
do you know?
>> Yeah,
Mr Chair
members of the committee, if
we're talking about jobs
actually created, are we
talking about jobs? And
now there's, there's the difference
>> in those numbers, jobs created
and at the end of the year, from
the beginning of the year to the end of the year, they
started issuing paychecks.
>> Now, I, I
don't know that I know that
answer I can tell
you that the, the
number of the 60
projects that we're talking about
is 5800
actual jobs that have been
created >> and we can
justify those in tax
returns or CRS returns
or some.
Ok. All
right. Thank you.
Share your
time.
We're gonna jump to these action
items real
quick.
So it's tab M these are
for tomorrow at 11 o'clock.
So the
meeting that Senator,
she made this request so we can try
to get home before midnight.
I move approval over the manners. Mr
Chairman,
you have the option.
There's a motion for the minutes. We
have a motion for the minutes
by Senator Rodriguez. Do
you have a second by Senator compos
any objection to the
minutes?
So none, Charles, what's
next? >> The next
one is on
Tab
tap in
and this is the contracts
for the next fiscal year.
So we're asking for approval
for the Bieber
contract and for
the contract with Ralph Vincent
for our budget system and
it support and
then you see the the next batch
of uh plan contracts
that we're not asking
for approval yet. Um But
that's what was in the, the overall
contracts plan for
the budget for fy
25.
>> We have a motion for approved by
Senator Rodriguez. Let me ask you one question,
Charles, why, why
we're still using Bieber for
economic development when they're
actually not A UN M?
They claim they're under UN M but
they're not
is when we asked them to look at
economic stuff. They said we
don't have a contract
with the
legislature.
They're kind of an independent company
is Bieber influencing
our revenue
projections and costs.
>> Well, we primarily use Bieber
to access um
a number of different economic
data. Um
that is one
set of data points that we
get uh to
use in the forecast
along with uh national
subscriptions to
other groups that both
we use and DF
um economists use as well.
So you're getting multiple
data points coming in that
they're synthesizing
>> and we can't buy those on our
own. >> Uh We
can look at alternatives
to uh Beber, it
is an entity
within UN M
uh that usually does operate
on soft money contracts
for specific
services.
>> I mean, they've done a number of
studies and economic
impacts, right?
>> And those were usually
probably under contract with an
agency or some other
entity.
>> They have a
motion.
I have a
second
>> for the work
that
let's see. Are we
putting that out
or we just
arbitrarily
>> it's under 50,000? So I don't
think we have to go out
to
>> correct
giving
up
one.
>> Yes, Bieber is not the only
entity that we work with to
get this type of data.
And you can see the detailed scope
of work on the next page on
the type of information that they're giving
us.
>> We have a motion the second
by
Representative Dixon
any objection to the
motion.
>> And then the next
thing is in that same Tab
Mister Chairman that we want to make
you all aware of.
That's after the
Ralph Vinson scope of work.
This is a request
for proposal.
There is no money appropriated
for this purpose, but in case
there is into the future
would be to continue. You've
approved $150,000
extension to
the Deloitte
contract on
compensation and
classification
for the next phase
of
the implementation of that
new system by making sure
that people that are
moving on to the new
classification system are
in fact doing that work. So
if you call yourself an engineer, are
you really doing engineering
work or
not? So
that's going to take, that's
going to be another phase
we're proposing to put out
an RFP to see
who would like to compete to help
the state do
that job and have LFC
oversee it should an
appropriation be a made
uh whether in the special session
or next session, uh
This contract
could be executed, but we would not
execute a contract without an
appropriation but want to
start the RFP
process uh
right now.
>> So if this appropriation was
made, well
in a special session, then we
could bid the, >> we, we
have, we would have the bidding
process already in place and
be able to execute the contract
shortly after the appropriation
was made to get the work done
before you come into
the session. Uh
And figure out how
much the new compensation system
is going to cost. >> Do >> we >> have a dollar
estimate?
>> Uh I would
estimate a max
of 600,000,
but that we would ask
for bids on the scope of
work.
>> Ok,
Senator Woods.
>> So
this particular contract
is just got to do with the state
personnel office
and doing all the work
to see where we're standing
if we're high or low. And
all of those >> that
work has been done, Mr
Chairman. Uh and
they've recommended Deloitte's
recommended a new
um classification
system. This
contract would be to move
everybody off of the old one
and on to the new one and
make sure that those individuals are
in fact properly
classified
>> because Spode does
not think they can complete the
classifications
on their own.
So they want Deloitte to do
the classifications and put
them in the system.
So we don't end up like the environment
department paying
the secretary $90
an hour, that's in a $28
classification.
>> And this type of work is work
that other companies could
bid on that contract. And that's
why we're proposing to go back to,
to RFP
as opposed to just extending
the existing Deloitte
contract.
>> Mr Chair. On that
point, we
suggesting
we talked about
salary,
public
safety.
>> No, we already
discussed salaries and benefits
in the prior session. We had
Deloitte a year
ago, two years ago. >> Well,
they've just finished their
work >> two
years ago. We said we're going to do a
pay study which hadn't been done in
20 some years. Deloitte
has wrapped that up and looked
at the be benefits and
classifications right
now supposes come in and
said,
25,000 state
employees,
we need help. We can't
manage the classification
system and they
want Deloitte to go in there and
say,
and dot Who's
doing a million dollar study
of classification on their own
outside the
legislature
by someone that's never done one
before. Now,
we're saying we're gonna go into
dot System and we're
gonna classify these employees
for say, a district
engineer, right? That
should be 175
to 200
then keep moving through the
system
and then go to the next
agency and
I'm just making these numbers up,
right? Economic
development. Here's
what the head
of economic development should pay.
Here's the deputy, here's the
classifications below that
for their job description
and put them in the system.
This is what this contract
would do. >> Thank you. And I
appreciate
your
question. I believe I
heard
director
say that the case
of decision was made
in the special
session
>> that is
>> I go back
to
salaries,
crime, public
health.
>> Well, it's called the feed
bill
and, and, and so
as we move forward
in order to, to wrap
up our classification, I'll just give you
the, the, the exact, the, the
district engineers in,
in district
six in, in mckinley
County in San Juan,
she makes 100 and
47,000. The Deloitte
study says they should make
174
right? And
the market's saying
200,000.
And so when we
come back to the session this
next year, we're gonna appropriate
20 to 30 million
because we bought,
brought everybody up. Now,
we just need to fix those intermediary
areas. And so
that cost and
for them to classify it
because o cannot
handle the classification
work in their system.
We're gonna have to get it done in
order to get it
right.
It is public safety,
but
don't answer the phone.
>> That's all the action items,
Mr Chairman, if you
want to move it on to the next
panel.
>> Ok,
>> then we need a motion on that
one. We
vote >> on,

ok.
Who's gonna start us off
>> JJ TJ
Parks,
>> Mr Chair, >> Heather
Brewer, let
>> me get him up to the table,
Mr Chavez.
Chavez
and go
ahead.
>> I have a question.
Um
the, the topic we
just wanted
and suggest that we for a
L require
Edd to give us
a complete list of time
and we do that and
provide
that.
Yeah,
I don't see the
tracking
several questions calling
out today
shows
essential.
>> I don't know where Janessa
went.
>> That will be on the follow up
list.
>> It's
not
>> OK. I think Janessa
was tracking that.
So
who's gonna start us

Counselor?
Everybody's pointing fingers if you want me
to?
>> It's on
ok, good afternoon. Uh
chairman members of the committee. My name
is JJ Chavez. I'm a
city council mayor pro TEM
for the city of Carlsbad and
welcome to the city. I'm glad
you guys are here members.
Um I'm here
to talk about the quality of life for the
city of Carlsbad. Um
As you can see the background,
uh the river is one of
our main amenities for
the city of Carlsbad. Um We
cherish it and we're
proud of it as you can
see right next to it. We also have our
water park
um that we use for our
kids as well.
Um We're very proud of
that uh one
major entity
we we're proud of is
that we only charge
$5 to use
it. Um So basically
anybody could use it
and if you're over 65
it's free to get in. So we have
our kids, our grandkids can
go. And
um, one of our philosophies,
we're not there to make money.
We're just there to break even.
So we have a place for the kids to
go and stay busy
for the summertime and a
place for the community to go.
Also behind you guy,
behind the
over here is our put, put,
course as you
can, um, later go
by, uh, we only
charge five bucks as well.
Um It's done and paid
for, it's there for the
kids and the community.
We're not there to make
money, it's there for the
community to use
and to keep the kids occupied as
well. So we're very proud
of keeping the kids
occupied their kids,
the grandkids and as well, I
like to go out there and try to
work on my skills as well.
Um Also
we have our, our
sports complex, we have a $10
million sports facility that's for
our kids. Um
We have uh softball
as well as baseball
and soccer. I'm proud
to say that that's completely paid
off. Um that
was based off oil and gas
and all our tax revenues
and when we, that we were able to
receive, so we
were very proud of that facility
as well.
Um
We don't charge a fee to get
in. We don't charge
any, any
amenities. So
if you want to go play, you can
and then we also, we
have leagues as well.
And one thing we do proud
ourselves if
a kid or individual
cannot afford the fee,
um the leagues will
sponsor a kid and
able to sponsor them for
the season as well.
So if the family or
individual can't, can't
support them on the league will,
will sponsor them and,
and, and they'll be allowed to play. No
kid is left behind. If they want to play
whatever sports we'll give them
the opportunity to play as well.
So we're, we're very proud of that
as well also for our
seniors and we have the North
Senior seniors as well
as the South Senior Center and
we have our meal program as
well. Um, so if the seniors
can't make it to any
facil, make it to any
facility, um, they have the
option of getting it delivered as
well. So we're very proud
of that
also. Um Throughout
the year, we have basically
just as we speak
as I speak right now. We have
our mine, we have three
mines right now. We have
mosaic and Trippi and
as well. We have
whip. Um
Currently right now we have the mine rescue
competition in the city
of Carlsbad. Um We have
teams from I believe,
Missouri, all
the major mining
industries that are
in town. So,
um that's currently being held right
now. Uh Missouri
Kentucky,
um several teams from
Carlsbad that
are competing regionally for
the national title as well. So we're
very proud of that. They're all
here in Carlsbad.
So, um that
we're also a national championship
as well for a mine rescue
team, so
as well. And then this
past summer, uh we
had a Gus
Maack, we had close to
300 Gus
basketball teams
uh within the city of Carlsbad.
It was held right across the river
overlooking the river.
Um I think we were
290.
We were fairly short from
breaking the record of 300.
Our goal this year is to break
300 basketball
teams, um which
is awesome. We're very proud of that.
Uh Everybody enjoyed coming down
here, the weather,
uh the facilities and the
motels. So
um we try to offer as
much as we can. Um
As you look through the river, we
also have our pickleball
courts, our tennis ball
courts.
Um We have our
ad, a splash
pads as well. So if
Children aren't able to,
um we comply with our
ad a compliances, we
have a
splash pad, two
separate splash pads.
Um So whatever
limitations you have, we're
able to get you on there as well.
So if you can't make the water
parks, um you can do
a splash pad as well.
So if you, if
you have free time, members
of the community, feel free to go
outside and, and uh
check out our, what
we call the beach, but it's actually
the PCOS River.
So we're very proud of
that and
then also downtown,
um We're considered
a historic area
as well as
the Hagan Arts
Park um by the
library. That's
we've put uh several
arts districts there as
well as multis
planted in the area.
Um We're very vested
in our local community
for artwork as
well. Um
And back in 2017,
uh the city of Carlsbad was
designated as a age
friendly community um by
the World Health Community
Organization. And
we're very proud to be the first
in the state, so
uh very proud of that as
well.
And then,
um
and then also
as well as
um for us being a small town,
we do have a transit system.
So I know sometimes in
a small town it's hard to get around.
But uh we do offer
a transit system
any time of day of the week, we do
have specific routes, we
do run and if you can't make
those routes and you can call the
number and we'll go pick
you up whatever time,
um, you need, we'll pick you
up and take you to the
spot you need
and we'll gladly pick you up and take
you. You want to go back to your
residence or if you want to go back
home. So,
um I'm very proud to be a citizen
of Carlsbad.
I
uh graduated
from college
and I came
back to Carlsbad. I'm very proud
to be here and, and
happy. So thank you for
your time.
>> Thank you very much for,
for your work and your presentation.
But before I go on,
I, I just want to say, I agree.
It's, it's pretty beautiful out
there. Uh Never,
I've been here several times for
meetings, but I never really
saw this area I
would pass by fast and
never did. It's beautiful. Thank you.
Um ok. Do we have any
questions,
comments from the committee? If
not, we're going to go on to the other two
gentlemen and then we're going to go
on to questions.
Yes,
I think what we're gonna do
thinking again here
is that we're going to go to the
others, finish that and
then unless you have to leave or
something, then I'll accommodate it.
Ok, so good
to see you, Heather
again.
I saw Heather last night at
dinner. >> Thank
you, madam, chairman, members of the
committee. Thanks for having me
today. I am
here on behalf of an organization
called the Permian Strategic
Partnership. Um I
hope that if you've heard of us
before, you will know even more
about us when we're done here
today. And if you haven't heard of us,
I hope that you will see the important
work that we're doing in the communities
in Southeast New Mexico.
And um if I can
put in a plug for it, the
importance
um
work that
organizations similar to
ours, should they be organized
around the state could have on our
communities as well.
So we are
a nonprofit
organization founded
by oil and gas
developers and two
institutions of higher
education. We
started out five years ago with
19 oil and
gas developers. There's been some
consolidations here
in uh in the Permian. So some
of that has changed, but we've also
expanded. So we now have about
27 members, each
of whom funds the
organi at
a healthy
amount every year
and charges
us with the mission
of reinvesting
those dollars
into communities impacted
by oil and gas
development. Um
We are proud
to have been doing this work for five
years. We are excited to share
with you some of the positive outcomes
that we have seen in this
community.
The next page
on the handout text about
the focus areas where we
work. Our focus
has been in health care,
workforce development,
education, and
roads safety.
We had been doing some work in
housing. We are changing
and transitioning away from that, although
we continue to work with the community
to find those
solutions.
So over the course of the five years
that we have been working here in Southeast
New Mexico in order to support
our local communities, which
are fabulous.
Um My son is very
disappointed he is not able to
come with me to go to the water park
today. So we
definitely even people who aren't from the
community, appreciate it.
Um We have
invested 100 and
$60 million
directly into
um communities in Southeast
New Mexico and West Texas.
And we've done that in ways that have allowed
us to leverage those dollars.
So we know that our collective
impact in this region
has been $1.5
billion and that's a key
part of our mission is
not to simply write a check
to cover a project, but it
is to leverage those dollars to
get additional money in,
to invest in the projects
that we know will make our communities
better and make our communities
stronger.
There are some specific numbers
breaking down the areas
and what we've invested. I'll talk a little
bit about some specific problem
pro projects
here in Southeast New
Mexico.
Next slide is some information that I
know you all are very familiar
with, but we can't help but include
it in here reflects the
economic impact
that the Permian Basin
has on this region
and on the state of New
Mexico. I know you're very
familiar with that. So we'll move on
to the fun work
that we've been doing down
here. One of the
big projects that we have worked
on is funding
Cal Ripkin Stem Centers.
These are STEM
labs with trained
teachers and educators
in those facilities
in every single elementary
school in
Southeast New Mexico within the
Permian Permian Basin.
And it's been an exciting opportunity
to really give
back and generate
interest at
the school level. The local
elementary school level to
help support Children and
families moving
forward directly
impacts 15,000,
almost 16,000 New
Mexico students. And we
continue to work
with the Cower and Stem Stem
Centers to ensure that they have
the supplies that they need the
instructional support and all of
those things to have the biggest
impact possible on
our
students
in education. We have
been working with
an entity called the Holdsworth
Center. It's an
educational leadership
foundation and that
does some of the most significant
work in the country around
developing quality
educators and principals
in communities working with the
school districts to make things
happen. Um We are
very excited to
have brought these programs
um to the
school district. So one of the things
that has always been a, a
problem with
smaller communities is traveling
outside of the state or outside
even of just of the district in
order to
get professional development
to work with some of the great
thinkers and foundations.
And so we flipped it around and we
paid for the whole to center to come
out here and meet
locally with the
teachers, with the educators, with the
principals. In order
to ensure that they truly have
access to this
kind of development, right?
Can't leave a classroom
um for three or
four days and not have that
have some impact on Children. So
bringing those programs here is
making a huge difference.
Um We also one of
the things we like to talk about that
came out of our
Permian Basin Superintendent
Summit um
is an
exciting a
new approach
to working in the classroom
called opportunity culture. And if
you do have a chance to get to
Pr Leva Elementary
School here in Carlsbad,
or to talk to some of the
Carlsbad um
municipal schools, folks who are here,
there's some really important work that's coming
out of these
teacher training programs
um and new ways of
doing things that are making a real
difference in the
communities and with students
who need it the
most
in our principal internship
program. What we
realized. And what many
of you probably already know
is that
being a high school principal
or principal at any level is incredibly
difficult job and
getting thrust into that
job after having been a vice
principal or assistant principal or
just finishing your phd
can be a really difficult
problem um and can
create a steep learning curve
which also leads to the
high turnover that we see
um in leadership in
schools. So what we did
is developed an in internship
program and I should be
very clear, this is a paid
internship program. So
we pay a
salary for
an aspiring
principal to serve
as an intern in
a local school with
a successful principal
in a highly successful school.
So that when they do get that call
and there is an opening and it's time for
them to step into that role.
They have that experience and
they've been able to do it as a full
time job and
being able to support their families
and be part of the
community
with the road safety
work that we do
in Southeast New Mexico. We
work very closely with Secretary
Romero who was here this morning.
Um because we realize
that our member companies realized
that oil and gas trucks
put a lot of wear and tear on the road.
They do and
we need to be good
partners in making sure that
our roads are safe and making sure
that our communities are safe
and making sure that there's collaboration
with the state to
help encourage
um public safety
and road safety here in the
community. One of the
things that we heard the most
um in talking with first
responders down here
was in rural
communities. It's not
always the ambulance who's there
first. It can be the
sheriff, it can be
someone who is off
duty volunteer firefighter.
Right. There are a lot of different ways
that people help each other
in communities in southeast
of Mexico. But what we
heard was a major concern,
particularly among law
enforcement police officers
was that when they arrived on
the scene of a terrible accident
on the road, whether that involves
a truck or a family car or
any combination thereof,
they had to wait,
they had to wait for an ambulance
to come. They had to wait
for the life saving equipment
that they could be using
as the first people on the scene.
And what they asked for was some
funding was support to get
that equipment into the
communities. And so
we stepped up
and provided
everything from lights
that you can use for
dark side of the road at
night to the jaws of
life. So that first
responders, regardless
of what their role is,
is um
traditionally
in communities in Southeast
New Mexico, they can
take on the most difficult
emergencies when they
arrive and those
um supplying folks
with that equipment. It does come with extensive
training. We follow up
with them year after year, we
replace those supplies as
they need to be
um replaced. I also
I heard you all talking this
morning about driver safety,
which is obviously a
huge issue
and wanted to put
in a little plug. We have been able
to partner with the Permian Basin
Road Safety Coalition
to fund a
Youth Driver Safety
Clinic that will be
at the Eddie County Fire
Complex on June
26. So
you get a little certificate for this.
It may or may not help
lower your teens,
um, car insurance payments,
um, but it certainly will help them
to become a better driver. We
certainly encourage
participation in those
programs and
we also work with our
own um
member companies employees to
ensure. And I'll talk
about this in a minute with the CD L
licensing that we have the
most qualified and safe
drivers on the road for the
work that our member companies
do.
The next project
you want to talk about is singularly
my favorite
project um that we have been
able to support. It's the Permian based
in Counseling and Guidance
Center. We have three
centers, Carlsbad
Hobbs and Gal
and effectively, what we are able to
do is to pay
for um
be affordable behavioral
health services to come back to
Southeast New Mexico.
This is a huge change. There's
been a lot that's gone on
in the past decade with behavioral health
services here in the State of New
Mexico and uh
rural communities are
suffering in
ways uh that,
that really multiply
magnify that
problem. And so we are
excited to be paying
for professional counselors
in a safe secure
environment in
rural communities to
support, support people in
need and whether those are
Children, whether those are
adults, they are
getting the service that they need.
I do, I don't want to speak
for the mayor of Dal.
Um because certainly he can speak
very well for himself. Um
But to share a
story, he
uh when we first started this program,
referred to students from the high
school in Dal
and asked that
we
take,
listen to and here and
accept this person as a client
through the services. That
person went through the
counseling services
through the permanent Basin counseling and
guidance. And the mayor
has repeatedly
said that he believes that it was
those services that saved the student's
life. And we are
grateful um to
be able to pay for and
support those programs here
in Southeast New Mexico.
Which one I I that point I
should put in a sort of
a we see our
role as partnering
with the public sector,
right? We want
to partner
with the work that you are
doing to leverage
private dollars in
order to make the
most of the
the communities in order to
do the best by
these communities that are impacted.
So we by no means want
to take over the entire health
care system or an
entire behavioral health system.
But when there's a gap and there's a
need and there's something that we
can step in
and do. We are happy
to do that.
Indeed, it is our organization's
mission
Permian Warrior Partnership
is a newer program that we
have started. Um
This is to help
veterans in the
community in a
variety of different ways. Um But
the most important, um
from our perspective is the workforce
development effort. So
we are able to
help veterans
here in our communities,
find jobs, find employment,
and oftentimes connect
with the great
opportunities in the oil and
gas sector so
that they can return home,
be welcomed into their communities,
have jobs and have ways
of continuing to give
back after their military service
is
done.
Our flipped internships are
going on right now. You
may ask what a flipped internship
is. I will tell you, it
is very difficult to take a
group of 25
teenagers out to
a rig site or a well site
um and show them
all about the industry.
Although um our friends
at Conocophillips actually did that
yesterday. So sometimes
we can make it happen. Um
But what we decided to do was
to bring internships to
our students, right? We
can't get a
kid to Houston to
see what an accounting office looks
like. We can't get
someone out welding
necessarily on a site.
We can't show the full
range of opportunities
within the industry
um because
of the distances and because of
other issues, so we bring the
internships to the kids.
So for two weeks, um
our students uh and
it's from each school district
that sends two students.
Um We
put them up at the New Mexico
Junior College. So they do get a little
college experience life in the
dorms. Um Not
too much life in the dorms.
They go home on the weekends.
Um But the
internship comes to them. So
representatives from our member
companies come and demonstrate
different work opportunities, different
things. And we've completed
this program. This is our third year
doing it. It's got larger every
year. Um We've completed
this program and have kids say, you know
what this is not for me.
I do not want to work in this industry
and that's great because
now they know where they want to
go or at least where they don't want to
go and they can try something else out.
But we also see a lot of other people
who are able to get a much clearer
perspective on
the education that they need for the kind
of work that they want to do in
order to stay in their own
communities with their own
families.
So a quick um
and dirty list here uh
by the numbers
of the things that we've been able to
do over the last five
years. And I would be remiss
if I didn't specifically
point out the CTE
school in Hobbs, I am
certain that you have
had the opportunity to go there. But if
you haven't hit them up,
they will take you on a tour and
your mind will be blown
Um I would love to
say that we are solely responsible
for this project, but we are not, it
was an amazing community
collaboration, including
the Maddox Foundation,
including the city, including
the county, including the
state. It was an amazing
example of the kinds of partnerships
that we're talking about that
come together and make
a huge difference. And we've seen
already students going through
there um with much
more focus and much more direction
because they are able to
choose pathways that
really work for
them. Um So if
you look through some
of our other programs here, I
would love to talk about all of them,
but you can find more on
our website in our annual report at
Permian partnership.org.
Um But we are working
to train
residents who work in the
hospitals over here.
We are training nurse
practitioners, pas
um We also are working to train
counselors who can come and work
in the Permian Basin Counseling and Guidance
Center and we
are here for the long haul.
It's been five years
and we've been grateful for
the opportunity again to give back
to the communities that have
given so much both to this industry
and to the state as
well as to help
address impacts of
the industry upon the community.
I would be happy
to take any questions
um talk further. Um
No doubt on any of our
programs. But I
know that uh the Maddox
Foundation also has some
amazing work
that they've been able to
do in our community and we'd love
to hear about that.
>> Thank >> you, >> Heather. All right,
Mr Parks. >> You're >> next.
Thank you, madam, chair
members of the committee. It's, it's great to
see many of you again. My
name is TJ Parks. I am the
CEO for the JF Maddox
Foundation. Some
of you may remember me. I,
in 2021 I
retired from
public schools after
40 years. I was the superintendent
for Hobbs municipal schools for the
last 11 years.
So I am a recovering
superintendent. So bear with me
if you would. So
the JF Maddox Foun
Foundation is a private
family foundation. Uh We
are a place based
organization uh
which means that we fund
most of our projects in Lee
County and in Texas
Tech, uh the reason
we chose uh Texas
Tech or Texas Tech chose
us is our founding
father,
Jack Maddox was in the
first graduating class from
Texas Tech University and
his brother in 1929
and his brother Donovan graduated
in 1932.
And so we have a longstanding
tradition with Texas Tech
University and
all that they do. Our
board is made up of seven
members. Uh five of
them are family. Uh They
live all across the United States
from Boston to California.
Uh They are a third
generation uh
of family members
and we're very grateful to have
them. We do have two independent
directors who live in
Hobbs uh, and they
really serve as the eyes and
ears for the family who, who
don't live in Hobbs.
Uh, the second page. If you look
really is the vision of, of,
of the Maddox Foundation, which
I, I can tell you from
being on the other side of the table.
Many of us thought that
whenever, uh, the second
generation moved on to
become emeritus, we were very
fearful about what would happen
because you wouldn't have any
board members that would live in our community
anymore. But they're very
dedicated to
Lee County. Uh And,
and literally, the, the
vision is they want to make
Lee County a place that they're proud
to call home. Uh
We have uh quarterly
board meetings. Uh They
come back to Lee County for three
of those board meetings. Our, our
fourth board meeting is
typically held uh
out of state in Dallas.
And that's usually where we have our
financial meetings where
our financial consultants can
come in and, and meet
just a couple of the programs that
we, we have uh
on an annual basis. We
have our distinguished speakers
series. I've listed a
few of those speakers on
there. Uh Many
times we try to partner
those with projects that we have
going on. I can tell you when we
brought Shaquille o'neal in that
was not the case.
That was just a hope, high
profile name that we brought
in. Uh and,
and he, he was a very
interesting, very
large man uh to
come in. Uh
Jose Hernandez
uh was the
first, is the first
immigrant astronaut.
And I can tell you he
probably, if I'm not gonna
say probably he was the most
impactful speaker that
we've had. When you look
at that list of
speakers, he was by
far the most impactful
one. We still have Children
today. Uh that
in the elementary schools whenever
they do their
uh they
heroes, they will
dress up as Jose
Hernandez and
speak. We had uh people
who attended that lecture
series who literally
did not speak English,
but they came to hear Jose
Hernandez uh talk.
And if you've not seen his
story a million
miles from
earth, I think is the title of it's
either on uh uh
Netflix or uh
on Prime.
I, I would highly recommend
you, you watching that
video,
Amy Vandyken we brought
in uh she was a, a
gold medalist
uh and she is
actually wheelchair bound today
because of an A TV
accident. We brought
her in because we
sponsored to help sponsor
a wheelchair basketball
tournament uh in
there if you see Mike
Rowe on there. And,
and as we spoke about the,
the core, Mike
Rowe was the speaker
prior to our
bond election for Hobbs
Municipal Schools
for the core,
a very,
very interesting
man to hear, speak as well.
He's a very, very colorful
man. Uh our
Maddox Leadership
Institute, very
proud of that. Uh When
I was superintendent of Hobb schools.
I met with the, the
Ceo of the Maddox
Foundation at the time who
was uh uh Doctor
Bob Reed. Uh My
concern was as we
met throughout the community.
Uh Everybody that
sat in the room was uh
older white men.
Uh We had no minority
youth coming up and through
our leadership. And
so through our uh
partnership with
the, the Fanning
Institute out of the University of
Georgia, uh we
created the
Maddox Leadership Institute.
Uh We will start the next
series. It's a nine month
training uh to
give them relationships, not
only amongst themselves, but to
help them build their
leadership skills, their speaking
skills, so we can create the
next generation and
we heavily recruit a lot of
our minorities throughout the
community to try to bring them
on the Jack
Maddox Distinguished
scholarship uh
has morphed
throughout the years. Uh
There are several programs that you
say gosh, would Jack Maddox be
proud of this? Uh The
answer to this question is no, he
would not. Uh Jack
did not believe in giving money
away. He
started a loan program. Uh
He would loan students
money but he was not for
giving money away.
So I'm not sure that this would
be one of his favorite
programs that we currently
do. But if you look at that
uh one student who's
chosen gets a free ride
anywhere in the United States
and we have students that attend
anywhere from Stanford to
Harvard uh all
across the United States, Texas
Tech, Eastern New Mexico.
They get to choose where they want to
go and then we changed
it a little bit this year. So we have
four students that will get
20,000 and 15
students that will get $5000
scholarships. I think one
of the greatest benefits that they get
is we hire uh
we contract service
with AAA college
counselor that she
helps them fill out uh
grant
uh scholarship information.
She helps them choose
uh a college and
individually she's on,
on their call list and
helps them get through that. And
truly, I believe that is the most
beneficial thing that they've
got. And then we
offer grants
when they are not
timed. A lot of
times that you see foundations,
they will have a grant
application cycles. We do
not cycle. Uh We,
we can receive a grant today.
We can receive a grant in
December. We just
live within our budget uh
locally, our,
our staff can award up to
$50,000. Typically
anything over $50,000
we get board approval for
those, those uh
projects.
And some of our current
projects that our board has approved
is uh we have a five year
proposal that we're going to do
some renovations in downtown
Hobbs. Uh Some
of that will, will require
us to do partnerships,
collaboration with the
city. Uh We're waiting
on some uh paperwork to
go through uh to name
that we do.
Uh Hobbs August nights
in August. We have the tree
lighting ceremony that we use
what's called Ship Street Plaza.
Uh And that will, we're
planning on doing a $3
million renovation to that.
And then some of the other things
really, some of it is cosmetic
and some of it is recruitment.
Hobbs is growing
north. Uh And so
economically, those
businesses are taking care of their
north and it's kind of leaving
downtown, uh a
alone and
that's really downtown
Hobbs. Southern Hobbs is our
most dense
population. Uh,
and it's a high minority
population, that's where
our office is located. And we
want to make sure that the community realizes
we're bought into that. And
so we want to really focus
that and make sure that we recruit
businesses to continue
to uh juv
rejuvenate and, and to
keep that part of our community
because it's, it's very critical
for us to have that
habitat for humanity
is, is thriving in Lee
County.
Uh We know that part of
that is because of the foundation, but
a large part of that is the
other businesses that they partner
with. Uh we have roofing
contractors that do for
pennies on a dollar. We'll put a
roof up. We have
uh uh electrical uh
companies, we have
ping companies that work with
them. C tech has
been a great
partners for them. Some of those
kids work over there on
internships.
Justice House
a program. This is
one of those that you say, gosh, you're
not a place based because
Burrell is actually out of Las
Cruces. Uh
the residency program,
uh we are recruiting,
uh we will start with
two residents that will come to
Lee County up to
six residents.
And it's the, the
1.5 million is a two
year program that we
will, we will front load
for Burrell.
Uh Our intent
is, is selfish to
an extent. We hope to recruit
those interns, we
will give them incentive uh
incentivize them for
some housing. Uh that
whenever they finish their residency,
we hope that they will stay in Lee
County. Uh They have
a similar type. It's a scholarship
program that they do with the Yates
Foundation in Artesia.
Uh And so we have partnered
with the Yates Foundation and other
programs as well.
Uh But uh
the, the
Burrell program we're extremely
proud of and that, that actually just
started uh at
the, they'll start
recruiting now. Uh
Lovington uh boys
and girls club, uh
we, we just uh
uh awarded a
$350,000
scholarship. They had a, a building
that had sat vacant for a number
of years and they had no
resources for their kids for after
school or uh
Lovington does not have
any childcare
facilities. Uh And
so our goal is that they
will be able to do the renovations
to that building for childcare
and for after school program for
their kids campaign
for grade develop level reading.
Uh We are in our first year
for that. It's a seven year
or five year program for
$1.7 million.
I think we all know
uh reading and
education in the state of New Mexico
where we all have a concern
and whenever you talk about economic
development, the greatest economic
development driver that we have
is a, is a quality
education uh that
we can help provide and reading
is, is the basis to
everything that we do. And so we
want to put an emphasis to
that leaning
into that. Uh our,
our newest project that we
actually have going on
is through a training called
the Ames Institute. Uh The
Ames Academy
aim uh was
part of the Mississippi
miracle. Uh
Everyone
realizes that Mississippi
went from last in the United
States uh to the middle
of the United States and reading
proficiency that was
not a one year program, that was
a 20 year program.
But the foundation of their
growth was by using
A I institute and structured
literacy, which is based
on teaching kids
with dyslexia how to
read. Uh And so
we are in the initial phases
uh as a former
superintendent, it was
my, my idea
that we
required the five
Lee counties superintendents
and their central office
staff to go through the initial
training because I want
to make sure that they realize how
difficult this training
is. So
we myself
included. Uh we will go
through the training through October
31st.
We will offer it to
principals on the next
stage. And then if the
superintendents see that this
is something worthwhile in their
district, we have planned
on training teachers.
We can't do all
every teacher in Lee County in the
first year, but we will phase that
in over. We've also
created a partnership
with at least three of
our county commissioners to help
defer some of our costs in
that. Uh But we,
we know that that is going to
be a real key factor
in, in, in addressing
the reading uh delinquencies
that we have with our, our Children.
And that's, that, that really is
near and dear to all of our
hearts. The next
few pages are just some of the
projects that we've uh partnered
with. And I think the, the, the
greatest thing that we have with the
foundation is not the money
that, that we offer up.
Uh We, we
understand and again, I, I was
on the other side of that table for a
long time. Uh
The very first conversation
I had whenever I was named
Superintendent of Hobbs Municipal
Schools uh in
2010, uh
Jim and Don
Maddox came and met
with me. Uh I was,
I, I had been
named but not, it wasn't
official. And they
sat down in my office and they
said, are you willing to continue
the relationship with the JF
Madox foundation? Uh
And I'm
an idiot, you know, knew
how to answer that question whenever
they had, had, had
awarded over $9 million
at that time to Hobb schools.
And so we continued that
relationship and, and
I've just known the family for a long
time and have a lot of respect for them
and they've done just tremendous things.
But I think it's the, the ability
for the foundation to have
a collaboration throughout
our community. If you look at the
core, the center of Recreational
Excellence, you know, it was a
$63 million
project that brought
the City of Hobbs, the Maddox Foundation.
Hobbs municipal schools. At that
time, we contributed
a million dollars. And
the reason that we did is the, is
the high school closed
down their pool,
which was a blessing.
Uh If you own a
pool, you know, the rigors and,
and the issues that go along with that
pool, our pool was aging at
the high school. And so it
enabled us to have a, a full
competition pool
without us having to maintain
that. And of course, New Mexico
Junior College uh had
$10 million from state
funds in there as well.
Covenant Hospital, which opened
up in 2021.
Uh We were able to
participate in that
uh the city of Hobbs
through some of their
collaboration I think was
a big recruitment for to
get the hospital in.
Uh we received
word yesterday that they
hired their first cardiologist.
And so we're really excited about
that. They've been able to have
recruiting and as we
talk about jobs and we talk
about recruitment, it's
very difficult to get doctors
into the state of New Mexico
uh with the malpractice fees
that we've got that they
and, and with covenant,
uh which is based really
uh you know, their, their, their,
their main
office there in our region
is in, in Lubbock. It's,
it's hard to pull doctors
over. Uh But
again, we try to,
to try to all pull
together. Uh
right, beginnings, preschool
in Jal. Jal
had plenty of resources
to be able to build the building.
They did not have the resources
to be able to train, to provide
furniture and some of the other
start up costs. And so we
partnered with them
uh on that, one of
our older projects is a walking
trail uh that
goes uh it
really does two things.
We, we offer
it as a fitness
uh for people to walk,
but it's also a beautification.
Uh because on the other side
of that trail is a railroad
and it's some of our industrial
areas in oil and gas,
which sometimes is not the
prettiest landscape that there
is. And so we
partnered with the city on, on
that. And then of
course, CCH which, which
we already talked about, which we were
blessed. And I think one of the
greatest things about C tech, if
you talk about construction of
that is that it came
under uh what we had
projected in cost. We
actually had
more partners than we had or
more money generated than we,
than it than it cost to build.
And all of the capital partners got
together and we created
a fund that, that
we invested with
the community fund out of
Albuquerque, a $5 million
fund because we know
uh that, that vocational
classes are much more
expensive than a regular
English or a math class
and some of the equipment
that's in there is gonna have to be
replaced and we don't want that
burden to fall on the school
district. And so they
have uh a fund
of $5 million that,
that has been invested that we hope
that we'll be able to maintain that they
can, they can use for years
to come. So, with
that, uh again, we're very
proud to be here, very proud to be
in southeastern New Mexico
and, and uh very
glad that uh the LFC
is in southeastern New Mexico
and uh
certainly would stand for any questions
at this time. So thank you.
>> Thank you very much, Mr
Parks. Great
work. My goodness. I'm I'm
impressed and I'm sure
all of us are. If I may say
that we've got
Representative Maestas
and Representative Pettigrew
had to leave. So we got Representative
Dixon after Maestas.
So proceed.
Senator. >> Thank
you madam chair. Thank you all
presenters, Mr
Mayor. Just some questions
of I love
what this city has done with
its, with its river banks.
Um Just
me. I'm from Albuquerque where the,
where the river is
or adjacent to the water is
the Bosque and it's managed
by the an entity called
the Rio Grande Middle Rio
Grande Conservancy District.
Uh And in the mou
it's Essen essentially a city
park, but the city doesn't treat it
as a park anyway. That's my
issues. But is there,
is, is this
next to the river? Is it private
land or public land
primarily
adjacent to the water's
edge?
>> Um
No
>> members not.
I'm sure members
quit Smith.
As you can see we're
public.
Um all behind
us.
It's
>> when you it's
not. Oh
sorry.
Uh When you get
fairly past the train
bridge, it goes into
private.
Um what I mean,
private, the banks are private.
The housing is private but
the river is public.
So um
you can basically go up and down
all the way up the
river. But
the only thing is you can't go on the
bank, which is the housing,
the private houses.
>> Thank you, madam chair. Thank you, Mr
Mayor. The, so the public portions
of the River Bank. What
has the city done with that, with that
land? >> Um
Madam, chair members of the
committee. Uh
We put our uh,
of course, sidewalks. We've
done sidewalks. We've added
a, a par
three golf course, um,
as well as
well as we've added more to
the
south end of
our banks as well. A new
boat docks as
well, um,
fishing banks
and then additional wreck
rec centers. What I mean, we
have a rec center down
behind us, what I say
south of me as well
for our kids. Um
It's a rec center that was an old
electrical building.
Um It's been converted into
a rec center. What I consider a rec center
is basketball courts,
volleyball courts,
um, team ball
courts, whatever a rec
center has for kids.
Um They are allowed to go
there any time of the day
after school and summertime,
get out of the heat. They can go in
there and play as well as
well. Um They are allowed to practice
basketball as well in there
as well.
>> Thank you. Thank you, madam Chair Mr
Me. It should be commended.
Uh There's a,
there's a, there's money in
last year's budget to do Bosca
restoration there in Bernau
County. Sort of be
interesting what folks uh
allow to see
happen because
Albuquerque is one of the few
cities in the country that doesn't utilize
its river for anything in particular.
It's just there and it's a
fire hazard. So,
so we'll hope to learn from
your, from your
city's leadership and I
will look forward to having you up there
one of these days. Thank you. Thank you, madam chair.
Thank you. >> Thank
you Senator. And I think I said
representative earlier. I don't
know when I called your name. I
appreciate that your
patience with me. All right.
Now we're going to go on to Representative
Dixon and then Representative
Gail
Armstrong.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Um Thank you
for the presentation. It's
really exciting uh
the work that you
all are doing down here.
And um
you know, I, I think Miss
Brewer knows that it's
uh an inspiration
and a model for, for
the rest of us. Um
a couple of questions
um about
the work. Um
And I think
uh this goes to
the Permian Strategic
Partnership
um or maybe
it's, well, I'll let
who whoever answer
uh coordination with
PE D for
the principal
uh for the working with
principal and then also
structured literacy. Uh
What type of
coordination
happens with PE
D? And is the
structured literacy program
the same that PE
D is implementing or is
it a different
program?
>> OK.
We spend a lot of
time talking and working
with PE D. Um And I believe
I said Secretary Romero's
name earlier when I meant to say Secretary
Cerna with transportation.
So we work very closely
with pe D as well
as with the children's cabinet through the
governor's office to
ensure that the programs that we're
doing, not only comply
with, but actually amplify and
augment the work that the
state is committed
to doing.
So I would be
happy to talk in in greater detail.
Let me, I'll give you another example
because I love examples. Um
We, the state provides
money for teachers
who want to get their National Board
Certification
and those are great
dollars dollars well spent. We know that
makes a huge impact on the classroom,
the permit strategic partnership
in order to make those dollars go
farther in other parts of the state. We
pay for the
National Board Certification fees for
anyone in our three counties in
Southeast New Mexico who wants to
go through that program.
So we are
very much in
tune with what pe D is
trying to do what their goals are
as well as what our local community
school districts want.
Um And how best
to find
some of the
some of the middle ground
in working forward with
them
>> madam chair representative. So
the structured literacy program
that we're talking about.
Uh every, every teacher in
the State of New Mexico or elementary
teacher was trained in letters
training, which is foundational
training. Uh And we,
we, we support that 100%.
But if you don't take it. Beyond
that foundational approach,
teachers don't really understand how
to teach. It's like learning the
rules of the game but not learning how
the game is actually being
played. So
the AM Institute on the structured
literacy is literally
teaching teachers how to
teach what, what
they already know or, or
what, what structured
literacy is. So they've got
the rules of the game. We're
taking it to that next level and
we have met, I, I met
with Dr Romero.
We're hoping to use this as a
pilot in Southeastern New
Mexico. We've
invited Dr Romero. We
have, it's, it's a hybrid
model. And so we have
two in person
trainings that, that they will come
to Lee County.
And we've indicted invited Dr
Romero to come down to observe
us in that to
hope that that would be a leverage
to bring the rest of the state in, in
with a training.
>> Thank you madam chair quick. Follow
up on the structured literacy
uh for the uh
for the supplemental
training to teach the
teachers. Um Do
you have a specific
building for
that
or do you just use
an existing
facility?
>> Madam, chair representative?
No, we don't have a separate
facility. I mean,
because it is a hybrid
model right now and right
now it's just the
uh superintendents and
the, and their executive staff
on that.
They,
if you've ever taken an online
course. So you, you
have work that you've got to do
in preparation. Uh You're
watching videos, you're reading
materials, there's, there's quizzes
to be taken. But the, the
short answer is no, we do not
have a separate facility.
>> Uh madam chair. Um
uh Thank you so much for
that. Um Elaboration.
I had a
suspicion that
um it was structured in a
way that would accommodate
a lot of people in different areas.
Um But I did want to confirm
that. Um So I
appreciate it.
Um
The
uh other thing
I just wanted to
mention um
is the important
role that the work you all
do here and
how it informed some
of the bills that we had in the
legislature in trying
to set up the Federal Grants
Administration and, and more
recently, the matching grant fund.
Um And so I, I did want to
thank you all for that because I
do think you've been a
model for the rest of the
state. Um And with
that, I was wondering
um if there
is, you know,
sort of a message that you would
share
um to other parts
of the state, you know, what,
what sort of lesson
have you learned or
what message
would you impart uh
to the other
areas,
>> madam, chair Representative
Dixon. If, if there's a
message to be said, I, I think
it's that no one can do it by
themselves. I
think the collaboration is the
key. I don't think we should rely
on state funding. I don't think
we should rely and put the, the
onus on uh
the private sector. I
think we, you know, if
something is important. If something
has that, that relevance
to it, I think we should all
be able to come in and, and pull
uh from every
aspect. But I think the collaboration,
the buy-in from the community
uh is, is what makes
uh anything that we've done.
Uh glisten is, is
certainly what, what's made it
work.
>> Madam chair. I do apologize.
I did not follow decorum
last time. So I apologize,
madam chair and Representative
Dixon. Um with the
permanent strategic partnership for the
first two years that we were in existence had a
program called the Southeast New
Mexico Grants Initiative.
And what we did was pay
for grant uh
writing and technical
support for local
entities applying for grants
where there's a nonprofit organization or
a municipality
and the
lesson. And I know we've
shared some of our success
rates and the dollars
that we were able to bring into communities
or help communities bring into them
for themselves is a
better way to put it. I think
the lesson that I would put out
there is a little bit of
money can turn into a lot
of money really, really
quickly. Um We are
very excited about
the various grants programs as
well as the technical support
programs that are
coming through the councils of
government as well as through the state
and through D fa because
small amounts of
money to pay for a grant
application can turn
into um
entire new buildings,
entire new programs.
Um and that investment,
um you know, it's hard to
spend money before you have
the results. But those small
investments in grant writing
and grant application um
has a huge, huge
return on investment
and we will continue
to do as much of that work as we can
down here, but certainly appreciate
everything that the state has been doing.
Thank
you,
>> madam chair
representative.
Um for
my aspect is it takes
community to raise a kid.
I it takes all of us uh
for the city of Carlsbad to
get all these projects off and for
us to get these programs and
tournaments. It wasn't
just the city of Carlsbad. It's a partnership
among private
oil and gas and the
local communities as well
to get all these going. It
takes all of us to get
these going to for all of us
to, to get these
programs and, and, and
together. Um
it's just not one person and
it takes a group
and, and we're glad
to have that partnership among
our industry as well as
our private and among
our commissioners as well as
our city councilors. So we're very proud
of that. Thank you.
>> Thank you so much. Thank
you madam chair.
>> Thank you representative. All
right, Representative Gail Armstrong
here. Next.
>> Thank you madam chair.
And thank you for the
presentation. I I
always uh get
a thrill out of
listening to what can
happen in a
community
when
there's partnerships
and you're not just relying on
the government to come in
and save you.
Um I love
that you put on
the Maddox Foundation,
your core
values
and, and I would hope that everyone
would read them
because
working together and,
and the things that you guys have
accomplished is
just
amazing. And then you
look at both
and you see
you have so much in common
that you're both focusing on
education, housing,
um different things for the community
that actually build up your
community. Uh The
Burrell thing
is just, it blows my
mind that you guys thought
of that. And
so I'm, I'm just, I just
wanted to tell you that I'm really
proud to
know that companies,
you know, oil and gas get a
bad rap
all the time.
We take a look right
here
and see what they do for the
community.
Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Armstrong. Representative Brown.
And then we have Representative
Baca.
>> There's some Garcia.
Thank you madam chair.
Well, I was gonna start with the same
observation you just heard from
Representative Armstrong and that
is these oil and gas companies.
They're
not treated very respectfully
by some people in our state
and, but they're good
people and
they're smart
people and
they know that when they get together
they can achieve things like this. So
100 and $60
million madam chair,
but look at how that's been
leveraged. And I remember
when the strategic
partnership was started,
uh, everybody was thinking, oh, money,
money. And
people were asking what are we gonna ask
for? And someone said, well, let's ask for
a new bridge, but
that would have cost every
penny just to
do that one project. But look what
you've done by being,
um, strategic.
And I guess that's why you're the strategic
partnership,
madam chair. Um, I, I've
used this phrase before
so some people in the room have
heard it but it
is if you
want to go fast,
go alone, if
you want to go far,
go together. And that's
what I see happening here. You're
together on this.
Um So impressed,
I've known of the Maddox Foundation
for many years
and honestly, we're a little
jealous that Hobbs has the
Maddox Foundation. Um
because I, I know through the
years what a lot of what
you've done. Certainly not
all of it, but I wanted to ask
um Mr Parks
on the core values for
Maddox Foundation
and I'm gonna read them out.
Uh The core values are
dig deep
think and do big
be a constant
ally,
measure twice cut
once and bring it
home. And so I'd like an explanation
of what you mean by measure
twice cut
once now.
Chair,
I mean, I know what that means in
carpentry.
OK, >> madam
chair, Representative
Brown
II, I will tell you the difference
between uh working in
public education and, and
working for a philanthropic
organization in,
in public education as a
superintendent with 10,000
students, it like you were drinking
out of a fire hydrant.
Uh when, when
you had parents question you,
they wanted an answer immediately.
Sometimes you didn't have
the opportunity to find the
exact answer. So
you, you had to give answers. And
so everything was an
immediate response,
working for a philanthropic
organization and working for a
family, you
research everything that you
do. And so
when we agreed, the,
the Burrell program was
started six years
ago, we
just signed a contract
two weeks ago.
Uh the, the
core, the Center of
Recreational Excellence was a
10 year if not 15
year project.
And so by
that, we do our
research, we do our due
diligence to make sure
that anything that we're going
to support has a
high likelihood that it's going
to be successful.
I will tell you that the board that
we work for is
also very
that they are not risk
averse. They want
us to take chances. There
are opportunities out there
where we have uh
grant partners that
come in. Uh that we
say this may not
work, but it
may work. And if it does
work, it's gonna have a great impact
on the community. So
by that, they
expect us to do our due
diligence to do our
work, to do the
background, to make sure that whenever
we do sign a
contract, whenever we do offer
a grant, whenever we do support
something, it has the greatest
likelihood that it's going to be
successful,
>> that's also very
wise
um madam chair.
Um I mean, I, I could just
go on and on about how proud I
am of all of you and
um just
impressed, so impressed with
what you've accomplished, but I, I,
I'll just leave it at that. But
I, I do want to say that
I hope everyone who can be
here tomorrow um
will be here to hear Carlsbad
Munic municipal schools
talk about Holdsworth, which
we just heard, talked about
in opportunity culture.
Um Also
amazing and
I get a little jaded sometimes
when I madam chair, when I don't
see us improving
in reading scores and
math scores and
get a little discouraged.
And I even
few years ago took on a pro
bono project, editing a
new um uh phonics
program for an author
in Texas. And
I learned so much about
reading. I also taught several
of my Children to read
and it's not that hard, quite
frankly, it really isn't.
Um But
we have got to address
that and what you're doing here,
some of your um
programs are, I think
gonna make a huge difference. And
so I just want to say
thank you to all
of you for what you're doing and
for JJ and the city
of Carlsbad, I've
watched
the growth and the improvements
and the um,
um, amenities
increase and it's
been very impressive too. So
thank you all very
much.
>> Thank you, representative.
All right, Representative Baca,
you are next. >> Thank
you madam chair and thank you for your
presentation. I want to first
congratulate you on that partnership.
You know, as far as
with uh what, what you guys
have done it
really is that you guys
have given an opportunity, taking care of your
students, which are, you know, our
families, you have
created opportunity. You've created
things that allow
kids to be kids and
families to spend quality time
together. I would say
that we'd probably be dealing with a lot less
issues if we spent more
money on
those types of activities. I want
to congratulate you also,
I think it's a model for other
um
corporations or industries.
I have a couple of small
corporations in my
district meta
and Amazon
um that I think
that it should not just, I mean, I, I
compliment oil and gas,
but for these other
industries,
I would encourage us to go back to our
communities and try to get
those
corporations
to invest in
these types of
activities.
Madam chair. I'm actually gonna
address this to superintendent
uh Parks um,
as a 31 year year educator
myself,
um superintendent,
can you, uh,
can you tell me as far as
what types
of
funding or what types of
activities are needed in
schools? If you can answer that very
briefly, that we
need more of,
ok,
that you've needed when you were
superintendent when you were
in Hobbs.
And then what we need more
of as a state,
please,
>> madam chair Representative
Baca
I, I think we've all
come to the understanding that
vocational trades
uh have need to come
to the forefront. You
need to fund them at the level that they need
to be funded. Uh
The 1.25
multiplier for every
child, sixth grade on
up isn't adequate
and it, and it's wrong because
you're getting funding
even if you don't order.
Uh if you don't offer those
courses, II, I
can tell you and, and uh
superintendent
Strickland knows this much better than
I do but
his costs for the
core are
much higher
than it was prior to
having the core uh or
on
or C tech, excuse me,
were much higher than having cch
before he had school
if I could, if
I could push anything forward
and our bylaws
do not allow us to get
involved in, in
legislative policy.
But my recommendation would
be to really look at the cost
of vocational programs
at, at the trades
because they're just
much more expensive than
a, than a math or a science
classroom and, and you
need to fund them at the level
that they really
require.
>> And thank you, madam, chairman
uh chairwoman and
up, I have a
follow up question to that. As far
as uh we
talked about CT I, I've
brought up many times about school
security and school
safety, you know, we
talk about this. Um
but madam chair and
superintendent, when we talk
about other types of facilities,
I'm talking athletic facilities
and I'm talking about performing arts
centers. How are those
projects
funded,
>> madam chair, Representative
Baca, they're just funded out of their
operational funds.
Uh If you're going to build a new
facility, you've, you've either got
to pass a bond or if you
have uh your mill
levy, like I believe
Artesia never passes a bond.
They just have the consistent mill
levy that, that comes up.
Uh but, but it comes out of your
operational funds
>> and, and thank you madam
chair and thank you superintendent. That's kind of the
point that I was gonna make. II I heard
that somewhere about 40 miles up
north that take football pretty serious.
I don't know, but I've
heard I've heard rumor
but I, I think madam
chair and I think colleagues
here that
school districts, especially small
communities have to make the decision
between building school buildings
and creating opportunities for their
athletes as far
as their athletic fields, their
performing arts fields or
other types of activities
that are going to engage students
and keep them in school.
We're gonna be talking about attendance
tomorrow. We're gonna be talking about
different types of,
you know, struggles that we
have.
But madam chair and,
and, and uh colleagues
here, I think that we need to
also look about how can we
fund or create
some opportunity that
school districts don't have to
choose between building that
classroom or
providing opportunities for
their, for the athletes.
I was one of those kids
without sports.
I would have not, you
know, I would have been
the more challenging kid.
I had to be, you know, eligible
in those types of things. So
I don't know how and what the
answer is madam chair and
chairman. But I do
think that we need to look
at how do we create
opportunities? I know that Senator
Maas talked about some of the
sports and what that does in some of
the sports facilities. I
think we also need to look about
how we can support school districts,
especially in our small communities
like los other places
that don't have the oil and gas
that you have here and you get the
partnerships but
still have and we still
need to take care of those athletes
and those young people
that are interested in our activities,
so you can
respond to that. Thank
you madam chair.
>> Thank you representative.
Anyone want to respond or
do we just move on to the next
person? Do you what do you think
>> madam chair?
I will tell you, I was one
of those kids as well. I
would not have gone to college. Could
not have gone to college. Had it not been
for athletics? It
paid for my, my college
degree. I,
I do think that
there's,
uh,
you know, whether it be
band, uh, whether
it be performing arts, uh,
whether it be athletics,
uh, typically that's
what keeps a kid in
school. Uh, you
know, unfortunately you don't have
a whole of kids who are really excited
about going to math class, you
know, that wake up every day and say, gosh,
I can't wait, you know, to go to
English four. That's going to be just so
exciting, but they do wake
up excited to go into football
practice, going to basketball, practice,
going to band practice, go
going to their uh
visual arts or performing
arts. And so I think we always
have to remember that
that's, that's an extension
of the classroom. Uh
And a lot of kids learn
a lot of life skills in
those
events.
>> You all right. Representative
Baca with that.
Ok. Thank you very much.
We've got one more
person on my list
and that is Representative Garcia.
Thank you for your patience.
Uh >> Thank you madam chair.
Uh Thanks for the presentation.
It's amazing what uh you can
get done when people work together.
You know, you, you just mentioned
uh athletics in, in
schools, you know,
when I grew up, I didn't have that
opportunity. You
know, I was in Vietnam at the age
of 18. So
my opportunities went out the
door. But I'm glad
what you're doing for kids now
to give them that opportunity
to advance themselves.
And, you know, this foundation
is a good deal and
like you said, working together
is a good deal. Now, I
want to go to the pro TEM mayor
there. You know,
you said quite a few
times, kids, kids,
kids, and that's very,
very important.
You know, uh you mentioned
the river here, the
activity you have for kids.
You know, a lot of communities don't have that
opportunity and I'm
glad you're pushing the the kid
part. And you know, I also
mentioned a lot of
this is funded by oil
and gas. You know, we
need to remember, you know,
everybody wants clean water
and fresh air. We all
do, but we can do
it all without oil and gas right
now. It's not gonna
happen, you know,
and uh we need to remember
those things because uh it's
important to everybody,
not, not just the co not the
air and, and the water,
it's important to, to
human life in most part of
the state of New Mexico. And
I commend you for what you're doing for
our kids and I commend
you for doing what you do
for our teachers and stuff.
Thank you. Thank you madam
chair.
>> Thank you very much representative.
I think we are done
with this item. We want to
thank you for your presentations
for your work and, and
just your, your vision. You,
you really are amazing.
Thank you very much. And
we're gonna move on because we're
getting a little bit
late here. So
we're gonna go on to the next and
last item that is Medicaid
behavioral and physical
health workforce.
And we've got
Rianne Escobar here
with us. Hi, Rianne
from LFC
and we've got Michael Richards,
senior Vice President for Clinical
Affairs at UN M with
the new Mexico Health
System.
So as
soon as you're seated, you can
get started.
We've got a handout here before
us will be
back. OK? Thank
you. >> There
we go. OK. Thank you
madam chair. I've
been being careful here. I have
a little virus but
it's a very low viral load.
So I, I think I'll be OK just
talking so you can hear
me. Um
madam chair. The item
is number J or
letter J in
your hand
out in your
binders.
Uh looks like
this
and um I'll
go ahead and begin and then I'll turn
it over to doctor
Richards to go from
there and I think you all have.
Yes, his hand out as well. So
we're good. All right,
perfect.
All right. So again, madam,
chair members of the committee, I'm
Ruby, an Esquibel, a principal
analyst with you
all and working in collaboration
also with the Legislative Health
and Human Services committee.
So I'm gonna
basically talk
from some bullet points, but
I'm gonna reference the
document periodically
just so you all can look at
graphs and that sort of
thing.
So
I'm basically doing the
background sections here
first.
So I
think preach to the
choir. Pardon me?
Yeah, I already said, yeah, Tab
J J
as in Jack.
So pre like I said, probably
preach into the choir a bit here.
But um as you all
know, New Mexico is
facing ongoing
challenges in ensuring
high quality health care
is accessible for
all New Mexicans. That's been
sort of our mantra here for a
while, is accessibility.
We've been putting the funding in.
How do we ensure
accessibility and
statistically and evidence-based
and return on investment,
ensure accessibility. So
those are the things we're
trying to gauge and I'll give
you the punchline here right at the
beginning, we don't
really have good data and
uh we've been putting
lots of money. You're gonna hear about that
across all kinds of
programs, but
we really don't have good data
and good ways
to
show that we're
getting a strong return on investment
and we're really manifesting
additional access,
accessibility for
everyone. So
I'll, that's the frontline
saying it upfront and I'll repeat
it again at the end. All
right. So
counties in New Mexico
need health care
workers more than
any other occupational
field. Uh So
da based on data
collected through
2023
almost 85%
of New Mexico's counties. So
that's 28 out of 33
listed health care
workers as their number
one occupational
need. So
pretty much the whole
state.
Additionally, according to the
New Mexico Workforce
Solutions Department,
the worst labor shortage
in the state is health care workers
with a particularly
strong need for
nurses.
And also according to the
Workforce Solutions department,
between 2020
through 2030
New Mexico will need an
additional
16.7%
in health care workers. And
by 2036
New Mexico will need an
additional 28%
in behavioral health care workers.
And that's based on data
from the health, the
National US Health
Resources Service
Administration. So
it just paints the picture
that what we all
know we need, we need health care
workers,
the Health Resources Service
Administration, the National
entity reports that
mental health provider shortages
impact people and
communities throughout the
country. With
New Mexico, South
Dakota, Wyoming, Montana
and Indiana facing the
most severe shortages.
So we're one of the top five
states in the country.
So this is a national really,
this is an international
issue everywhere in the world. You go
everywhere everyone's facing
health health care shortage
issues. But in just the
US, we're one of the top
five, particularly in behavioral
health. New
Mexico has 19
designated geographic
mental health shortage
areas. Um And that's
covering basically all of our counties,
28 counties.
So approximately
845,000
residents, almost half the
state are
underserved. So
that gives you an idea
there
So as I indicated,
these issues related to health
care shortages are
national,
national data show that the
shortages of physical
health and behavioral health
providers
are
particularly
prevalent and
pervasive
in rural areas. And
of course, we're one
of those rural states and other. I
don't, I don't think Indiana is some
considered so much in rural state.
But when the other list
of the five rural, the states I
mentioned they're all pretty
much rural in nature as
well.
The Association of
Medical Colleges estimates
that a shortage of primary
care providers of
between
260,400
are estimated
across the country by the year
2036.
So this
again is a national
issue and something we need to be talking
to our congressional
delegation about looking
at, I didn't really put this in
here but looking at lifting
the caps and I don't know if Doctor
Richards knows is like the back of his
hand but lifting the caps
on uh
for
residents and
people in medical schools and all
of that because those are a lot of those are based
on federal caps. So that's
something that we really need to
look at as a nation.
Um Also
many states including New
Mexico are employing
strategies to try to
address provider shortages.
And what some of these strategies
include are
loan forgiveness, loan
issuance and loan assistance
programs which you'll hear more
about malpractice
reforms which you all have
heard a lot about when I'm
sure that's not gonna end,
um, scope of practice
modification. So I think
we'll for sure, at
least during the 60 day be looking
at some legislation on
that um
telemedicine parody.
So we've done a lot in this state
around telehealth. I think there's a lot
more that we can do around telehealth
and telemedicine
mobile clinics. Um
We've done some expansion
around that and I think that
we're looking at doing more to
try and provide more
outreach and clinical support
in rural areas through sort of hub
and spoke models utilizing
mobile clinics
and also provider
reimbursement increases, which
we have done a substantial amount.
You all have supported
that as a legislature
in both for Fy 24
and Fy 25.
Uh up to 100 and
20% of
uh Medicare rates
in Fy 24
particularly targeting
uh behavioral health,
maternal and child
health and behavioral health.
And then for up to
100 and 50%
for Fy 25.
So there's been a lot of
support for that and a lot of
funding investing.
So regarding
funding
the health care Authority
which will officially
be uh
beginning as
of July 1st. So
formerly the Human Services
Department reports
that for all the Behavioral
Health Collaborative Agencies.
So this is
corrections, the
courts, the
Developmental Disabilities
Council, all of those entities,
there's about uh 13
to 16 entities that make up the
Behavioral Health Collaborative per
statute.
So for all of them, in
their fy 25
operating budgets
total, there was
$1.2
billion that was uh
appropriated for
them. So
that's a substantial amount I
think last year you were hearing. Oh
yeah, we topped a billion dollars
invested for behavioral
health agencies
and then um
for nursing,
nonrecurring appropriations
for faculty endowments
and financial aid
for fy 23 that
total 59 million.
And then the higher education
faculty fy 25
the higher education faculty
endowment totaled 50
million and the Social
Work endowment totaled
80 million.
So a substantial
amount of funding going in to
support all of these entities
and build that
healthcare workforce
pipeline.
Also in
Medicaid Behavioral
Health, which is not
counted in that 1.2
billion number that I told you for the
Behavioral Health Collaboratives
and Medicaid behavioral Health
just in general fund
dollars. Um There
was 100 and 72
million in tested for
fy 25 and of course,
that's leveraged almost
um 3 to 1
with federal funds and
then graduate medical
education
was over
received over $5
million in general fund dollars. And
that's leveraged as well with federal
funds and
then for the loan forgiveness
programs for fy 25
those totaled near
$15 million.
So with this litany
of funding here that I'm going
through, I think you get
the picture that the
legislature has
substantially
funded
health care and
healthcare professions and healthcare,
workforce. Moving
from Fy 23 fy
24 and moving into Fy
25.
So I wanted to talk a little bit
more about the loan forgiveness
programs.
So data provided
by the higher education
department
demonstrates that loan
forgiveness for health
care workers increased
exponentially since Fy
21
in fy 21.
Um there were 100 and
44 individuals
that requested
loan forgiveness and
22 of those individuals
received an average
award of
$25,000.
The average award amount
remained the same for fy
24
with
1000 122
individuals applying for
loan forgiveness and
701
granted awards. So
big increase.
Um This growth indicates
that at the very least
more individuals are learning
about the loan forgiveness
program. However,
as I indicated at the very
beginning, it is
unclear at this time if the
program is achieving its
desired outcomes
of recruiting and retaining
health care workers in the state.
So we don't really have clear
data on that. So we're putting the
investment in but are the
folks really staying beyond their
initial commitment? Um
We don't have good
longitudinal data
on that. And
then um so more data
is necessary.
Also, this
program has cost the
state of New Mexico
almost $15
million in fy
24. So
uh a substantial investment.
So we will need to look and try and
get more data and we're trying to
partner with HED
on that
and regarding our
health care, labor force
production and needs,
um New Mexico Universities
have on average 3000
individuals enrolled in
classes focused on health
care. This includes
anyone in a nursing program or
social work program,
even if every student
were to graduate and seek
employment in New Mexico and
in the health care field,
there would still be a short
of of shortage of
approximately 2000
workers within the health care and
social workers field.
So to address these issues,
again, the legislature,
y'all appropriated
$50 million to
the higher education department.
Again, for faculty
endowments, 59
million for nurse
um faculty endowments
and financial aid and
80 million for social worker
endowments,
higher education
institutions in the state
report graduating
1142
nurses in 2023. And
this was down
5.5%
from the
1209
reported in
2022 and
down 14%
from the 1328
reported in 2019.
Additionally, applications
for nursing fell by
6% year over
year and are down
19%
over the past five
years. So
we're not having the
uptake in just the educational
system in, in our institutions
of higher education for
people going into nursing and
all. And
um however, the
nursing program budgets
have grown
72% over
the past five years.
And nursing program faculty
have increased 29%.
So we're investing in
the, the infrastructure, the
resources but the
students are
declining
and then higher education
institutions, enrollment
in master level social work
programs fell
8.4% from
2022 to 23.
But it is up 1.1%
over the past five years.
Applications for master's
level social work programs
fell 18%
between 2022 and
2023 and
are down 13% over
the past five years.
However, again, spending on
social work programs increased
29%
between fy 19 and
Fy 23.
So I think you're
starting to see the picture here.
We're, we're investing
trying to get these folks and
we know we need them and yet
we, you know, needing to
get the students into
school.
And then over the past three
years, the legislature
has appropriated that 80
million I talked about for social
work endowments for faculty
and financial aid.
And at a relatively
conservative assumption of
a 4% return,
the endowments would provide
3.2 million annually
for social work programs
equivalent to 44%
and a 44%
increase on the
combined total
7.2 million social
work programs, the
spending in Fy 23.
So the funding
is there.
So social work program
budgets increase by
13% from Fy
22 to Fy 23.
And again are up that 29%
that I mentioned.
So that gives you a picture sort
of of the background,
our needs,
the investment in higher
education and
then I'll talk a little bit now about
Medicaid. I think you all
have heard us say so many
times. Um New Mexico
is the highest per capita
Medicaid state in the
country we have.
Now, it's about 42%.
We've gone down from when we were pushing
almost 50% of our state's
population on Medicaid. Now, we're
at about 42
43%.
So let's
look at Medicaid data on
workforce and all
Medicaid data indicates
all the contracted
managed care organizations.
So the MC OS
have increased the size
of their provider networks.
So that sounds
good. But the MC
O provider network increases
are not equal
and not at the same
pace as the increases
in Medicaid enrollment
between 2019 to
2023. You
all will recall.
We're starting in July 1
with the new turquoise care Medicaid
program. We'll have four Medicaid
MC OS. Prior to that, we had
three Medicaid MC OS.
So Blue Cross Blue Shield Prez
and Western Sky.
So the growth
in the provider network
um that I referenced
earlier really was driven by
increases in Western
skis network.
Um the data on
page four.
So, um you,
you all can look at that,
the data on page four
indicate that as Medicaid
enrollment grew between
2019 through
2022. That's during
COVID when we couldn't take
anybody off. The Medicaid
rolls the growth
in the number of Medicaid physical
health and behavioral health
providers trended
downwards um
with an uptake just in
2023.
So both the numbers of physical
health and behavioral health Medicaid
providers and the per
capita numbers of
physical health and behavioral health
Medicaid providers
trended downwards
um from 2020
through 2022. So
we have basically an
adverse situation going on here.
This is when our, our,
our enrollment in Medicaid was
really trending upwards because
everyone had to stay on
and yet the providers were trending
downwards and yet they were
getting paid per member per
month fees. Also
as the graph on page
five in, in the graph on
page five, as it shows
the Medicaid national
Provider identification
number. So that's called the MP
I that data, that's
a way that we can track
individual providers.
That data shows that Western
Sky community care which
started it's Connal
care contract in
2019 that
it increased its network
more than Blue Cross, Blue Shield
and Presbyterian for
both physical health and
behavioral health.
Approximately one third
of the providers
overlapped between
all of the entities
and the
um so
there was duplication a lot in
this system. So when we say
all the providers, they're really
working for everybody because we
don't have
maybe, you know, extra
providers that can just
serve Blue
Cross and not serve Presbyterians
say our state, our system is too
small. The
table on page six
depicts that in the
Medicaid Provider network,
many specialties.
So I'm trying to address now, just
specialty care, many
specialties showed an
increase from 2019
to 2023.
Some specialties though
such as nurse practitioners,
physician assistants, internal
medicine, family medicine, and
obstetrics, gynecology
or OB gy showed
large increases. So
that's good. However,
other specialties such as
pediatrics, emergency
medicine, dermatology and
midwifery showed
modest increase and mixed
results in the year over year
trend.
However, even though some
specialties did show these
substantial increases,
the Medicaid provider
networks, number of
providers in any given
specialty still was
not fully adequate
to serve the growing Medicaid
population and
the provider appropriate
per capita access to care
in both urban and rural areas.
So the the requirements that we
need to meet.
So
that's why I'm saying it, it's a little bit
of a mixed picture because we'll show,
we show big investments
and yet not the number of students,
we show some increases
in the network but not up to the
levels that are really needed per
capita. So a mixed
picture and then we don't have sufficient
data on our
investments. And
then on page six for behavioral
health providers and the Medicaid
provider network between
2019 and
2021
there were increases in
counselors, social workers,
nurse practitioners and marriage
and family therapist.
There were small increases
for psychologists, psychiatry
and neurology providers.
However, these increases
stagnated in
2022 and
2023.
So about to wrap up
here. So, um
in the report, um
there's data on
pages seven through
nine from the
UN M Healthcare Workforce
Committee's 2023
annual report on
county level shortages of
primary care physicians,
nurses, ob GS,
psychiatrists and, and
um also the committee's
recommendations on how to address
those shortages. I'm not gonna go into
that because I think um
my colleague here is gonna
address that but that
data is provided for you as
well as some graphs and charts. So you
can look up your districts and
see how you're faring.
Um That's on pages seven through
nine and
um in the
appendices, we have some
pretty substantial
appendices in this document.
These appendices provide
more data on the loan
forgiveness repayment program
costs, nonrecurring
nursing and social work
appropriation,
appropriations, social
work appropriations,
the percentage of individuals
awarded loan repayments
by healthcare
profession between
Fy 21
all the way through Fy
24. And
there's a heat map in there of New
Mexico prescribing
behavioral health providers by
county as of
December 2023. So
you can look in your, it's mostly
all the Rio Grande Corridor
and then um
also uh
county maps
of Medicaid Comprehensive
Community Support Services,
what we call CCS
S um those
providers that are actively
billing in um
Fy 23
and a county map of the
breakdown of the new
Mexico Medicaid
license, alcohol and drug
abuse counsel providers
or laid a providers.
So provide you a little more data
and a little more breakout and a little more
county level data. So
you all can look that up in your
areas. And in
summary, madam
chair members of the
committee, uh as
I've indicated much financial
support has definitely been
appropriated by the legislature
to address the recruitment and
retention of
health care workers in New Mexico
over the last few
years. However,
the results and outcomes are
mixed to,
to poor. And while we're
still lacking data regarding
if this is really sustainable
improvement and
if the access to health care is
actually being realized.
So with that, um thank
you and I'll turn it over
to Doctor Richards
who is the executive
vice president with the
UN M for Clinical
Affairs, with the UN M
health system. And um
thank you, Doctor Richards.
>> Thank you very
much.
So, thank you madam, chair and
committee members and directors
for the opportunity to be here and
talk with you today. So
I'm a professor of Emergency
Medicine, but my, my
job right now is really health care
administration and I'm, I
think the way to describe that
position is like, I'm the chief
operating officer over the
university's delivery
system. So this healthcare
workforce issue is something that I
think a lot about from both the
perspective of being
a professor and in an
academic institution, but also
trying to build clinical delivery
systems. So what
what I hope to, to be able to
do in the few minutes I've got
is maybe give you a couple
of ideas that we haven't
talked about and some ways
to think about this workforce
shortage issue. So if you,
if you go to page two
of the handout that I provided
I really have 55
ways. I'd like to get to the
points. I'd like to talk
a little bit about the workforce
report that Miss Escobar just
talked about and about
how I look at that report and
what it means and what it doesn't mean
because I think it gets a lot of
attention. The second
thing is really to talk about what
drives our workforce needs.
And that's a place where I have a couple
of new ideas, I'd like to put
out there. And then, and then
how can we really
understand where we are and
what we really need?
And then to talk a little bit about
what the national data shows
where we're at right now and where
we're going to be. And then
kind of then with like a
list of things that we can do
to work on this. So
on page three is the,
is the, the healthcare
workforce committee report,
which um which this is
the slide that shows primary
care physicians to
benchmark using the
2021
data. And, and
I've circled on there, Beo
County which says in this
particular method of
looking at the data that we
have 100 and 38 primary
care physicians above the
benchmark. And Valencia
County is 47
physicians, primary care
physicians below the benchmark.
And I'll tell you that this
graph evokes a
strong emotional
response by many people who
say if you are in Bernardino
county and you try and get a doctor's
appointment. How in the
world can this be? Right.
And, um, and so the
number is actually right. And
so if you slip over to the next
page, what I'd like
to just offer up is is what
this report really shows and
what it and what it doesn't
show. So this is a
per capita comparison.
It shows how many
doctors we have
or nurses or
dentists that we
have per capita
relative to everyone
else. And so the
problem with this report
is that it makes the assumption
that what everybody else has
is what we need and
that's actually not a
very accurate
interpretation. So
the number is in fact
correct. These are so
the data is accurate. But
by labeling this as a
benchmark, it's a bit
misleading because no
one has enough primary care
doctors right now. So having
the same amount as the rest of
the country doesn't really
tell us where we're at in terms
of what we need. The other
thing that's really interesting about this.
And this is probably one of the more
important points I hope to leave you
with today is that when you
look at this and you see things
like Bernalillo County is
green and Valencia
county is red, then,
then you can come to the conclusion
that maybe we have a distribution
problem. Maybe if we could
level out the workforce from
urban to rural, that
would give us the kind of health care
we need. And I'd like to
offer up that. That's also
a misinterpretation of this
graph. And in a couple of
minutes, I'm gonna talk a little bit
about why because what
this doesn't show you
is the health care
infrastructure. This only
shows you the health care
workers. So this
really doesn't show us,
this shows us what the supply
is. It doesn't show us what
the demand is. It
misrepresents, I think the issue
of distribution. So
if we flip over to the next
page, which is
page five, when
we look at this from the perspective
of building a healthcare workforce
or building clinical service lines
within the delivery system,
we actually use a whole different set of
tools and the, the
tools that we use
um are really
driven by a company called SG
two, which is, which is
part of the National Healthcare
Quality Consortium visit that
we're in. And it looks
at at the things that,
that, that help us
understand what drives the
need for health care.
And so for example, the
demographics of the community
are a big driver and
not all communities have
the same demographics. And I'll
go into that a little bit
practice trends, you
know, are really important piece
of this and um
geographical consideration,
especially given that we have
really more concentrated
urban areas and we have less
populated rural areas,
make developing
health care delivery systems more
challenging for us in New Mexico.
But beyond that other kinds
of things like how productive the
workforce is with the reimbursement
models are
practice trends that,
that involve things like
technology like. So
for we're recently looking
at, at, you know how
many cardiothoracic
surgeons we will need
in Bernalillo County.
And even though we've got an
aging population,
there's not a really big
growing need for cardiothoracic
surgeons over the next 10
years, we only need
one more. And the reason
is the way that we take care of
heart disease is
changing. So we
don't need as many surgeons
because we're taking care of that
disease in a different way.
So if we flip over to the next
page, I'll dive into a few
of these demographics
and practice chan trends
and geographical considerations
a little bit, a little bit
more. So probably the
most important thing for us to think
about in terms of geographical
trends is the fact that New Mexico
has an aging population.
And that's that first graph
there on the left and
we'll, you know, we'll be the fourth
oldest state in the United States
per capita. That
really is important
for us because the
demographic of
65 and older
in most health care
categories consumes
four times as much health
care as the demograph
traffic of 18 to
64. So if you're
getting an older
workforce, the needs
for health care go up
and the types of services that
you need change.
And so understanding that
demographics is really
important, you'll also
see on here that the,
that the pediatric population
doesn't grow at the same
rate. And then, and
really kind of important, I'll skip
all the way over to the right side slide
here where we've got a
relatively declining
birth rate in our
state for,
for, for when we think
about trying to deliver
obstetrical care.
And um and we start
thinking about how we're gonna train
a workforce to be able to deliver
obstetrical care. This
declining birth rate becomes an
issue for us because
it now is the rate limiting
step for being able to
grow some educational programs
like family, community medicine
and obstetrics because they
have to have a number of these
patients to be able to,
to be able to, to create a training
program. You have to have a certain
volume in a geographical area
to be able to have a high quality
program. So these demographics
are really very important
drivers as we start
to think about what the health
care workforce needs are
in New Mexico.
Now, I want to switch over to page
seven, which is
probably the, the one thing
that I want to make sure that I, I
spend a couple of minutes on
which is this this
trend in practice?
Um because we talk
about the needs of health
care, the health care
needs based on the idea
of, do we have enough healthcare
workers? I would
like for you to also think that
that the way that medicine
is practiced now, we
also have to ask the question, do
we have the health care
infrastructure,
not just the workers.
And now in some cases,
the reason why we don't have
the clinical delivery system we
want is because we don't
have the health care professionals to
recruit into the delivery
system. In other
cases, it's because there's
no health care infrastructure
to recruit the writers
into. And that gets back
to that graph. I was showing you earlier
that showed the Valencia County
with the red. You
know, you've made a big investment
to be able to build a hospital
in Valencia County, but
the hospital isn't there right
now. So you know, so
when you look at a map of
health care workers, you're
gonna see a red in
Valencia County because
there's no hospital for
doctors and nurses to work
into. So that's not
just a health professional shortage
issue, that's really a
health care infrastructure
shortage issue. OK.
And the and this concern
is continuing to mount
this graph that's here on page
seven shows the
shift and how physicians
practice medicine.
Now you will see that in
from 2012
to 2024
that most physicians
are now employed
by a corporation
or a hospital system.
Ok. They're not in independent
practice. And you can look to
see after COVID the
giant increase of
movement from, from those
kinds of solo independent
small practice to moving
into corporate practice.
So when we think about
trying to address the health care
needs, we have to not
only just think about the people
we have to think about, is there a
place for them to practice
because they don't practice
without health care infrastructure.
And this graph I think is a
really important demonstration
of that. Ok.
And the next one. So where
are we in terms of health care
infrastructure in New
Mexico? Well,
there's lots of ways to try and think
about this problem. And the one that I'm
gonna offer up now is
how many hospitals beds
do we have relative
to other States in
the United States? And
it, and it turns out that we
are 48 in
terms of number of hospital
beds per capita.
So if that is the proxy we
use for health care infrastructure,
you'll see that we've got a
real lack of health
care infrastructure, not
just providers. And
so when we think about where
we're at at 48 where
we come in at about 1.7
beds per
1000 capita,
the range in the United States
is 1.6 to
5. So you can see that
there's a huge range
if we wanted to be just
at the national average
of hospital beds per
capita, we would have to
increase the number of hospital
beds we have by 31
percent. Ok. And if
you look at this map, I
show only the hospitals of
25 beds or more,
most of the hospitals which are
25 beds or
less are critical
access care hospitals and they
do a special kind of
clinical care there.
So when you look at this map, you'll
see that there are
large geographical
areas where there just simply
isn't health care infrastructure
uh to support the kind
of workforce that we want.
That's an important issue when
we start thinking about building the
workforce and the
distribution.
Now I'd like to switch over to,
well, how do we know what we
really need? Ok.
And, and I'd like to offer up
that there that since we
started doing this kind of work on
our own, looking for the health care
workforce that this
national issue has
caused the federal government to develop
some national tools which
help us understand what
the workforce needs are.
And there's this National Center for
Health Care Workforce Analysis,
which now has a very robust
set of tools to let us be able
to do analysis on
workforce needs. And if
we flip over to page 10,
you'll start to see some examples
of these tools which are
available, which now let
us look at both supply
and demand
using some very sophisticated
models. The two graphs
that I have on here show
one looking
at physician workforce
and then the other one that's on the
bottom left shows a nursing
workforce dashboard.
And if I flip over to the next
page, you can see that
the way that they do this model
is to take into account some of
the things that I talked about
before, where you really
look at the supply
from the perspective of
who's entering into the
healthcare workforce market,
who's leaving the health care
workforce market, what
are those drivers? And so, for
example, you know, if you've got an
aging workforce, which we
do in our state, then
your supply is gonna look
different than in other states.
If you've got a
compensation issue
or a practice environment
issue that affects
the supply. OK.
When you look at demand
in the Hersham model um
that they're using now, it takes
into account the
demographics of the community,
it takes into the health
status, it takes into
account the reimbursement models
that are there because all
of that really helps
impact demand. And
all of that is put into a
very complex
simulation model that
lets us look at
what we have
and what we
need something far
more robust than comparing
ourselves to what our number
is to other numbers. Because
this takes into account these
specific issues by
state. So what
does that tell us?
Um So if we go to slide
12, what you'll see
here is that and, and I
picked this for all physicians
that New Mexico actual
physician supply is
right at the national
median. OK.
Um And that's actually really
close to what the New Mexico
health care workforce report
says that we've got a national
median. But as MS
Escobar just talked about a few minutes
ago, we've got a national
problem. So knowing we're at
the national median doesn't tell
us where we really need to
be. So if we go over to the
next page, we can start
to look and say, what's, what do this
national data tell us about
specific groups?
Now, I picked a group here and
this one is family community
medicine, but there's 74
professions which are in the
data system. Now that
you can do the modeling on
to look at where we're at
today all the way
through 2034.
And you can even run what
if scenarios, what if
you know, you had
uh you know, more people enter the
market. What if you have more
people leave the market
so you can do what if scenarios?
So where are we? Well,
this would show us that, that
for family, community
medicine. Um
And we're right at about
right now, about 93%
adequacy.
Um Now that's for the
whole state. Another
really important point is that
if you were to segregate this
data and
say, well, 93%
adequacy for the whole state,
what about the rural part of the
state? You'll actually see
that these numbers almost drop
in half. So while the
urban areas might be at
90% the urban
areas, um I mean, the
urban areas at 90%
the rural areas will often drop
down to 40
45%. Showing
that that's a even a bigger challenge
for us. And where will we
be in 2035
on primary care? We'll be
at 82% adequacy
showing us what the demand
is and this is the shortage
that, that you can see on this
particular supply.
All right, I'm gonna flip
over to the next page
which talks about pharmacists,
which is a very different kind
of issue for us.
When we look at pharmacists
in our state, you'll see
that right now. We're at
100% of the
supply and demand.
And, and that when we look at
2035 by
pharmacists, we're actually
at 100 and 25%
of what we need.
That actually creates a real
opportunity for us as we
think about addressing some of our
health care, workforce needs.
And I'll talk about that in a
moment on page
15, I've given some
some data that
show where we are by
this simulation model
for 2034
for New Mexico across
multiple disciplines.
So for, for physicians,
we're at about a 78%
adequacy or a
shortfall of about 14
100 physicians,
nurses, 81%
adequacy. Now, this doesn't include
nurse practitioners. This is
just registered
nurses of over
5000 shortage.
Behavioral health is the
place where we have some of the greatest
needs. We're only
at 48% adequacy
for behavioral health. But
I'm gonna also go back and
say that that is
in part, not just a
worker workforce
shortage issue. It
is really a
infrastructure issue.
We are missing whole
parts of the behavioral
health spectrum of care.
And it's in part because we've had
reimbursement model up until
recently, which didn't
pay for those kinds of levels
of care. So they don't
exist. So we don't have
the infrastructure and we don't have the
providers. That's a big
part of why we see such a, a big
gap there on dental
hygiene, 64%
and overall allied health
at about 88%.
So this gives us a sense of
where we need to
go. Now on this
number where we've got
physicians at about uh
1400%
adequacy.
Um I'd like to flip over to
the next page and say a couple of things
about that. So when I
think about how to address this
issue, I really
think about it from the concept
of what do we need to
expand? How do we need
to train, what do we need to do
for recruitment? What do we need
to retain and then where
are opportunities for
innovation and
on expand.
What I really believe we
need to talk about here is
expanding the clinical
delivery system and
infrastructure, not
just the training program. And
I'll say that the work that you did
last year with the Health Care
Access Act and creating
Medicaid um
funding for New Mexico.
Um it goes a long
way to helping stabilize
a clinical delivery system
and to be able to build clinical
delivery system. And
so there is work that's being
done in that area.
Here's an example of something that,
that around around where
infrastructure really does make a
difference. I think many of
you know that at U and M
we're in the process of building
new bed towers right now
and we'll be in those
the first of the phase of the bed
to hours in the spring of next
year. And then, and then
as soon as we're into that
phase, we'll move into the next
phase of bed tower. So
we can look out over the next
the next decade
and know that
in our clinic, my clinic
specific clinical delivery
system, we'll be
adding um adding
almost 300 new hospital
beds. That means that
we'll be adding about
400 new physician
faculty members to the School of
Medicine over the next decade.
That's almost a third of
this short workforce
shortage. What's driving
that is the fact we're now
gonna have infrastructure to
recruit physicians to
practice in. So that's
an example of why I'm saying the
infrastructure is a huge
piece of this
and the work that you've done around
Medicaid, given the very large
Medicaid patient population
has, has helped us
do that. When I think
about training, that is really
the educational programs
here, thinking about the
pipeline programs and how
we recruit. Um
and one of the most important
things that we've done in this particular
state and Miss Esquibel brought this
up is the
resident physician training
or graduate medical
education. Remember
doctors trained by going
to college and then
medical school and then
after medical school, you
then do residency
training which last 3 to
7 years, then you
can go out and practice medicine.
Well, we have, we
will by the end of this
next round of expansion.
We're gonna go from
750
GME spots at
UN M to over
1000 which will make
us one of the largest
residency training
programs in the entire
United States.
We're able to do
that in part because
Medicaid in our
state has created the
reimbursement models
that let us do that.
Most states have not
done that. So that's an
example of how we can
do things around training
programs that create
opportunities to grow our
workforce in
terms of recruitment. I think
that there's lots of things that we could do
around health care policy,
you know, to help, you know,
with recruitment, but this
really deals with things like scope
of practice. And so I'll go
back to that pharmacy
item that we talked about.
So we have a highly
trained workforce
with our, with our clinician
pharmacist who are
able to do lots of
health care and they're spread
throughout the state. We
are already a national
leader in allowing those
individuals to be able
to help deliver health
care through things
like testing and treating.
We need to continue to
expand that so that we
can take advantage of that
really, you know, highly
trained workforce. And that's a
part of what we mean by scope
of practice, everyone
has workforce shortage
issues. And I think that we
do need to look at what our neighboring
states are doing and make sure
that we don't get behind.
And M Escobar brought
this up loan repayment
programs for example, or a
strategy that other states
are using to be able to
recruit workforce because
we're only gonna be able to do
this. If we recruit
nationally, we're not, we
don't have the demographics to
solve all of this need
by ourselves. And
then retention. Um
retention really is, you
know, the drivers of retention are a
little bit different than the drivers of
recruitment of this workforce.
And frankly, this comes down
to things like community factors
like good schools
and crime are really
important once health care
professionals come and there's often
a reason why they leave
work life balance.
So being able to get into a
community that has adequate
structure. So they're not just there
by themselves and, and
have a practice environment that is
rewarding. So I think that
that when we look at this problem,
we have to look at it across
the board. It's not just one
thing that we need to do.
And in the center of this, I have
innovate and, and I
put that here because
um while this is a really
big task, I
actually think that we can do a
good job with this in New
Mexico and probably better
than other states.
And, and so I'll offer up
that we've got a history of
doing really important
innovation, things around
workforce. You know, for
example, the School of
Medicine in New Mexico
and Medical education
was created around the idea
of problem based learning.
We were the, we were the
institution that invented
that and it, and it
became the national model
for the way medical education
was provided. It was the basis
for how we created a medical
school in this state
project. Echo is something that
you all know about that
was wholly driven by the
fact that we didn't have
enough gastroenterologist
and they weren't distributed
well enough around the state to
be able to take care of
predominantly our Hepatitis C
burden. Well, we
took that problem. And with
the work of Sanjeev
Aurora, created a model of
how to deliver health care
that has changed the way health
care is delivered, not just in New
Mexico, but around
the world.
And um or
the way that we, we've used community
health workers to navigate
and to connect to our community in
the unique ways that we need to
deliver care in New Mexico
or the things that we've done around
scope of practice. So
I believe that while this is
a really big task,
there are lots of things that
we can do that in aggregate
are going to help us get to
building a better
workforce, but
also building a better overall
health care delivery system.
So thank you madam chair for the
chance to, to present this
and um I turn it back over
to Rian.
>> All right. Thank you very much,
Doctor Richards. And
do you have anything else to say,
Rian? All righty.
We're going to go straight
into questions or comments.
I've got three people here
and we can move
on. Uh Representative
Gail Armstrong. Then we've
got Representative Chatfield
and Representative Baca.
Thank you, Representative Armstrong.
>> Thank you madam chair and thank
you all for your presentation. I'm gonna
start with Doctor Richards since
you ended and that's
fresh on the, on the our
minds right now. Um
I, I really
appreciate your map
analysis because it's always
really irritated me
when uh you know there's
no hospital in Capron County.
Well, there's not enough people
to have a hospital in Capron
County. And so
I I really appreciate
that your whole breakdown
of, of the mapping system
of that. And
so one of my questions was
on page eight. Why
is Socorro and Sierra
hospitals not on that? Are
they just acute care?
>> So, um madam chair and
Representative Armstrong,
I'm only showing
hospitals of greater than
25 beds on
this. And, and the
reason I did that was
because because in
our state, we have, I think
we're at about 12 acute
care access hospitals
now and those are typically
hospitals which are 25
beds or less. They
have a different kind of model
of care, very important
for those communities. But that's
a little bit of a difference
than the way that you deliver
care in a
larger acute
care access hospital. >> Ok.
Thank you. I I did hear
you say that my apologies.
Um The other
uh the last thing that, that I just
want to mention is um
is on page
16
and that scope of
practice,
I have tried to
change scope of practice
a lot.
Uh And everyone's
very protective of
their scope of practice, including
pharmacists. I
have little
clinics in Catron
County that
dispense whole
packs
because they can't dispense
individual. They can't count
out 12 pills, they have to
do a whole pack. So it
drives up the cost of health
care. It
um I've tried to
get it passed where they can
dispense and
the pharmacists don't want to let them
dispense. The doctors
don't want the pharmacists
to treat. And
so until we
can figure out how to bring
everyone to the table
and stop
protecting their
entity, I understand why they
do. I mean, I know a Palmer doesn't
want an electrician to do
plumbing and vice versa
unless you're trained.
But in a simple thing
of counting out
12 pills or
whatever. I, I mean, I think it
makes a huge difference for
access for rural
New Mexico. If
something like that could,
could pass.
And um
so I just wanted to bring that
up that the scope of practice
is a big hairy
monster. Sounds
really simple, but I, I
wish it wasn't. And so
if you could elaborate
on how we could possibly fix
that, I would love to hear it.
>> So, um madam chair and
Representative Armstrong, yeah, you,
you're exactly right.
Um You know, we can put these
ideas out here like changing
scope of practice. But I,
but I think that your assessment
that this is a much
bigger challenge than it sounds
on surface that we
have lots of licensed
health care professionals that have to
come together as a medical
community and, and,
and, and reach an agreement
about about the ways that
that health care can be provided.
I'm under no delusion that
this is a really big lift for
us. We're, we're actually
ahead of most other states,
but we're nowhere
as far along as we
need to be. I, I
think that the, that
understanding that, that,
that we're all um
concerned about ensuring
that patients get safe
care and that we're
at the professionals who are delivering
the care are
adequately trained and that
they're part of a system that
allows us to ensure that the
quality is there.
Um That, that, that
those are all the things that people
bring to the table when they're
concerned about modification
of scope of practice
or maybe even,
you know, getting to
um uh to
ensuring that we're,
you know, allowing people to,
to practice to the level
of their training. But,
but I believe that we have more
than enough need and
more than enough work to
go around and that,
and that we can demonstrate
that that there are
safer models
that, that we can
employ. >> Thank
you, madam
chair is
uh the other
part that we're leaving out, I
think and that is
um
licensing.
We have a very
rigorous,
depends on what you're trying to
get licensed coming from another
state. We don't have
reciprocity, not very
good reciprocity.
We hold ourselves very high
and mighty and it's really
hard sometimes for
someone coming from another state to
get licensed in across the
board in anything
but specifically social
work. And so
um behavioral health
specialists. So I think
that um making
sure that we send the message
that uh it's
important to New Mexico
that we
expand or remove
barriers, uh remove the
barriers so that these people can get
their licenses. So I just want
to make sure that everyone knows that it's a
huge problem in the state right
now and that we could use some
help
making sure that we, we
remove those barriers.
The >> go
ahead. So madam chair
and Representative Armstrong, I think that's
another really important point
and just a just something to
consider is that, that
as we um II
I agree that you're
right. It is, it is difficult
for us to in some
places to have the kind of
reciprocity that you hear
about in other states. But
just as an item for consideration
here is that that in
some places and this is certainly
not all of the things I think you
might give examples to.
But as we change the scope
of practice to allow
a standard of care
that takes advantage of a
health care professional
um to do things
in our state
to practice at the license, the
level of their education and
competency, we
in some cases are
well ahead of other
states. And so
then, then that does
make the reciprocity
issue a little bit more
complicated because
if pharmacists in our
state are
trained to be able
to do a certain level
of care
that may not be the case in other
states. So as we're bringing the
health care professionals in,
we have to think about how we
bridge that gap
between what we allow
and train health care professionals to
do and what other states
do. >> Thank you for that.
I I just know like in the
behavioral health, they have to
have three years or five
years experience.
And so that, that really limits
our pool when we do that.
So, thank you for your answers and your
comments and now back
to Ruby Ann. Um
As usual, thank you for your
presentation. I'm the
biggest question. The first question
I have is why don't
we have the data?
And because you
kept saying lack of data, lack
of data, lack of data.
And will this
um the New
Mexico Institute of Mining
and Technology appropriation
to help build the new
dashboard? Is this gonna help
us to be able to collect the
data? >> Um Mr
Chairman Representative
Armstrong,
I think basically we we
know that across so many areas,
we're lacking data. So
this is sort of a pervasive
problem pretty much
everywhere. So
we make investments,
hence the growth
appropriations, right, that we're
trying to make those data
driven evidence based. So
trying to change
the gauge a little bit on that. So
I think I think just across most
things, we are data
poor in terms of outcomes
return on investment, that kind
of thing. And yes,
I think the
$750,000
appropriation that was made to New
Mexico Tech for their
health care dashboard will
certainly help us.
And as Doctor Richard
said, you know, this new
model
that um her has
put out and stuff, that's another
tool to help us. So
I think we're getting more
robust overall
just in
terms of different
ways that we can
leverage the data we do
have. But do
we remain short in data?
Yes, we do. So
I think we really need
um some help particularly from
the higher education department
on some of these things that I mentioned
earlier in the report.
Um And we know that with
Medicaid and some of the other
clinical data, we have other partners
that can help us. So we're
hoping that HED will step
forward and help us provide
more data and outcome
driven data. >> Thank
you for that. Thank you, Mr
Chair madam chair. Um
I'm, I also was
uh concerned to
hear all the information
on how we're, we're
putting in the infrastructure
for the nurses, but
we're graduating
less and,
and the cost is higher
um to in,
in the uh higher education.
Uh So that's
something that we really need to
watch closely. I just saw an
ad a couple of days ago on
television for Western
um New Mexico
University who's started a
whole program, a nursing
program and a lot of it's online.
So I think we're, we've
got the outreach and we've got
the, the base
now as usual,
a little, a little too late,
but hopefully it can
catch up. So I really
want to keep a close eye on that
because everyone
wants to, to
uh you know, more money for
more things as,
but as long and I don't mind doing that
as long as it's something that's actually gonna
work.
Uh The
malpractice I I see
here, many states including New Mexico
are employing strategies to try
to address provider
shortages. Some
of the reforms that states
employ are as
follows the
loan forgiveness, which we've
done malpractice
reforms. We haven't really
reformed malpractice, we made it
worse. And
so that I think that was our
real punch
in the gut to
uh independent or I don't
know what to call them independent doctors. But I
think that's why a lot of them are
working for corporate instead
of having their
own practice because they,
they need that coverage.
Um
The other question
I have is and it, it
may not be relevant yet.
But um I know
that the uh we
have a special session coming up and
we know some of the details
that the governor wants to
um to look at
and that's involving
assistant outpatient treatment
and criminal competency.
Um in
a rewrite will
require extensive
expansion of behavioral health
services. Have
you all done any kind
of analysis on
what that looks
like and
what the needs are
and, and what it's going to
cost. Have
you seen any bills?
>> Um
Mr Chairman Representative
Armstrong, we've seen
some initial bill
drafts and we are looking
at an array
of
services gaps.
We're particularly looking right
now at Certified
Community Behavioral Health Clinics
and where we're at with that,
that's an initiative that
uh we just got a
demonstration project through
Medicaid to get additional
funding for that. So that's
proven to be a very effective
model. There's some other,
for example, Washington
State has a
new, um, hub and
spoke model that they're
looking at for behavioral
health and um,
Doctor Richards right here.
He was in the center of our hub
and spoke when we were dealing
with COVID UN M was
the, the anchor and
then we did the, the spokes all
out to the rest of the state and they had
morning calls at 6 a.m. all
through COVID. So
that's a model that
we are very effective
at doing some here
in the state. So we're
looking at different things
um, beyond that,
um, I'm not privy to the
other internal
conversations.
>> Ok. Thank you. It's just,
uh, I know that, um,
everyone in this room
knows that we
have a shortage of behavioral
health providers
and so expanding
that I just don't see, you know,
how we're going to do that. And,
and at what cost
until we remove some of the
barriers for people to come
in, we can recruit from out of
state, um
encourage, uh
you know, kids to go to college
for this and make it an,
an easier thing for them
um, still with a high
threshold. And
so I, I was just
curious about that and I thank
you all for your, your answers.
Thank you. >> Thank
you very much, representative. We've got
representative Jack
Chatfield, Representative
Baca Representative Brown
and then Senator Mayas us.
So see if we can
keep our responses
um as short as
possible. It's getting close
to five o'clock and I know this
is a very important matter.
So we want to proceed.
Thank you.
And we have one more person here
just raised his hand and that is
Senator Rigs. >> Thank
you madam chair, uh
madam chair. I would like to
dig around just a little bit more
on the behavioral health
aspect of your, of your
presentation. We
all reach just this
earlier today, set through a
presentation
by the Department of
Transportation. And
one of the problems that they
had was
uh traffic
fatalities
involving pedestrians.
And guess what the highest place
was
was Santa Fe
was Albuquerque
and we know where it's at. It's
down Cyris road,
it's down areas
where, where you
have a lot of homeless the
that are panhandling
in the media
and, and
uh the crime
has gone
up. My, I
shared with everybody they're
of hearing it, but my car was
broken into
uh some of my
colleagues have, have
trouble with their homes, having
the windows knocked out in Santa
Fe and in
Albuquerque
and, and
uh
these, I
mean, any
amateur knows. So what we're dealing
with is
drugs,
uh mental
health.
What are we gonna do about
it?
>> So, Mr Chair madam,
chair and Representative
Garcia, you're exactly
right. There's a, we, we
do have substantial
issues with both
homelessness and substance
use disorder. And I
think that, you know, the conversations
that we've been having about needing to
expand the access to
care and the treatment and
being able to take treatment to
those environments where those individuals
are at are some of the things I think that
we need to focus
on.
>> What do you need
madam chair to
get that done? Do
you need money? Do you need
more people?
Uh
who do we need to look to,
to put this process
on? I mean, great
answer, but it just
kind of, it's the answer that we
all know, you know, we need
to to
treat, treat them. How are we
gonna treat them?
>> Um Well, sir, I think that
I, I don't think that there's just one
answer to this because it because
as you know that and if you pointed
out that this is an
unhoused, oftentimes,
the the group you're talking about is
an unhoused group of
individuals. And some of the things
that we're exploring
right now are how we
actually take care
to them on the
street. And so I
think that as we get some more
experience with some of
that, what we're referring to as
street medicine program
that they may be, that may
give us some,
some um some ideas
about how that could be
expanded. Um
where we think so where we can take
the care to them in
their environment um
to, to try and help
them get access to the care
that, that, that they in some
cases either don't know about or
have the resources to
be able to come and do on their
own.
Thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you, Representative
Chatfield, Representative Baca,
you are next. >> Thank you
madam chair and thank you, Doctor
Richards. Um
First of all, thank you for your
um in-depth
and very thorough presentation.
You took the wind out of many of my
sales. And so I
wanna, I want to thank you for
that. Um Definitely had questions
regarding I'm from Valencia Counties as
you saw that. So when I saw
that Valencia County being the
worst or in
the most in need, I I
appreciate your
explanation.
I also appreciate
the the explanation
about expanding the residence
from 750 to 1000.
Am I correct? In that
>> madam chair, Mr
Chair? Yeah, Representative Baca.
That's correct. We'll we'll be
expanding as we expand our
hospital beds, we'll
expand the our residency
programs to 1000
>> and and thank you, manage my my
question. Really the last couple of
questions and again, I'm expecting
brief is about U and
M School of Medicine. Ok.
So how many
students we have, how many come in
a cohort? What
is the percentage of these guys that
actually guys and girls that
actually graduate?
And you talk about
infrastructure and capacity
is are we using
all available slots
in U and M uh medical
school? Would
increasing that
capacity or infrastructure? Would
that help with some of
our uh
shortages for health
care workers, madam
>> chair? So, so madam
chair representative baca, so
we're at the UN M
School of Medicine. Um A
typical cohort is
about 100 and three
students. OK.
And um and we have about a
7% acceptance
rate. Um So
there's lots of individuals who
are interested in medical
school. Um We have
years where the graduation
rate is uh where
where individuals may not all
graduate on time.
Um And we, we
keep those students in the
program um It
give them an extra year to be
able to, to achieve
the medical school milestones.
And so we end up with a graduation
rate of, of, of
individuals who come into the program
of greater than 95%.
And that's right at about national
average. But I will just
say, you know that there
is an opportunity for us to
increase the medical school
size. We are
really committed to, to
providing that medical education
to New Mexican
students. But I do
think we're gonna have to challenge ourselves
to say, how do we ensure
that we're giving every New Mexican?
Um that wants to go to medical
school an opportunity to do that
by increasing the class
size, which is something that
Dean Finn is currently working
on. But I think we also need
to recognize that, that,
that, that many of those
individuals need
additional support to be able
to complete the rigors of,
of, of, of medical
school. And so
part of what we'll be looking at is
how we can
create the support systems
to ensure that our students
are going to be
successful. Ultimately,
we get right at the national
um uh graduation
and board board pass
rates >> and thank
you madam chair. Just a quick follow up
question. You said you have the
opportunity for expansion.
What would that number look like?
And what would the cost of that
that be to increase?
I mean, are we talking
10 more students per cohort?
Are we talking 25 more students
per cohort? And
what, what types of
support would you need from the
legislator uh
to, to make
this possible? >> Um
madam chair um and
Representative baca the
university is currently working
on a strategic plan
for growing all of the health
care profession programs including
the School of Medicine.
The biggest rate limiting step
that we will have right now
is the size of the clinical
delivery system. But that is
expanding. The next biggest
rate limiting step we have is that
the current infrastructure or
Fitz Hall is a building
that is greater
than 60 years old.
And so I believe that
that President Stokes
and Dr Zoon
and Doctor Finn
will be advancing over
this over this legislative
session discussions about
what that infrastructure
replacement would need to
be.
>> Thank you, Doctor Richards for your answers
and thank you madam chair.
>> Thank you. All right,
Representative Brown, Senator
Moesta, Senator Rigs and we have
one more Senator Woods after
that. So, Representative Brown,
you're next. >> Thank you madam
chair. Uh So,
um, Doctor Richards, I
was also gonna start asking some
questions about medical
school enrollment at U and
M. Uh
So about 100 and three
students per class that's up
from, I think it was 70 or
75 a few years ago. So
there's been some, some movement
there. Um How
many students overall
uh in the medical school?
>> So madam chair of Representative
Brown, we
we, we typically
bring 100 and three
students in 100
students in per
cohort. Almost
all of those are New
Mexico or they
are students that, that,
that um, that are Native
American or have a
connection through like the,
the wiki program.
So it's a predominantly New
Mexico Medical
School program. And
um, and so at any time,
you know, we'll have it's a fouryear
program. So we'll have
about 404
125 students
total in the program.
Each class is, is
ideally around 100
it can go up or down depending
on whether the students all stay
on the fouryear track.
>> Thank you and madam chair and
doctor.
Um
It's my understanding, I've seen
a chart in the past or a map
that shows that the medical
school tries to get at
least one student out of each
of the 33 counties. Is that
still the policy madam
chair doctor? >> So
madam chair and Representative
Brown that there's not a
geographical
um criteria
for medical school.
However, the way
that we, the way that we recruit
for medical school is that
that um that there is
the in-state requirement
or the connection to New Mexico.
Then our approach
is that we set what we think
the the the requirements
are to be successful at
medical school. So the
MC A T scores and the grades
and we set what that needs to
be and then we do a
holistic interview of the
individual to, to
try and find who is
likely going to be able to
contribute to New Mexico
and be the kind of doctor that
our state needs. And I
just offer that up because
that's not the way that it's
done in other places.
Other places only take
the most competitive
like the student that has the
highest MC A T score
or the highest GPA,
those students are likely
to do really well in the
academics. But they
may not necessarily be the
kinds of doctors that we, we
need, who are connected
to the rural communities
and and connect connected
to the mission of delivering care
in New Mexico >> and madam
chair and, and Doctor
Richards. I, I, I've
heard many times that
students who grow up in rural
areas, they go on
to med school are more
likely than students who grew up in urban
areas to go and practice
in rural areas. Is that still
the case? So >> madam chair
and representative, yes. Yes,
we, but when people have
connections to the
community, they
are more likely to go back to the
community. So we,
so if you're from the community,
you're more likely to go back.
But when they're in training,
we try to give them exposure to
rural medicine and
to the rural communities which,
which may help build the connection.
Um We also try
and recruit them to come and do
residency programs
here. And, and so if we
can get someone who does, who's
from New Mexico, who
goes to a New Mexico medical
school and does a residency in New
Mexico. That's our
greatest chance of having that
individual
stay.
>> Thank you madam
chair and doctor. So it's
my understanding, maybe this has
changed that
when a student
graduates from medical
school and then goes on to
residency that there's a
federal law
that limits
the income that that
resident can earn.
And it's shockingly low.
Last time I heard it
has is that
accurate? And if
so has it boosted
any for that madam chair?
>> So madam chair
and Representative Brown,
we we pay,
there's not, I am
not aware of a limit
on the amount of
compensation that a resident
receives it for
the University of New Mexico. We
set resident compensation
at the national
median. OK. And that
national median is what is
what we pay. And it turns out
that that actually is a really
fairly good compensation
given that the cost of living in
New Mexico is less
than it is in many other
places. So we set
our compensation at the national
median. And um when
we also do um analysis
on what drives individuals
to pick a residency program.
Um It's the quality of the
educational experience.
It's the colleagues.
The compensation is
number 10 on the list
of things that are the drivers.
It's really the educational
experience and, and, and,
and, and, and we are actually
doing really well on
that. We have 100 and
77
residency spots that we
recruit into every
year. We had over
12,000
applicants for our
177
spots. >> That's good
news. Um Madam
chair, I
think part of what New Mexico
was doing was
trying to get more students into
medical training. So we have
the was the BS MD
program. Is that
still going madam
>> chair? Yes madam chair
and representative. The, the
that was the expansion we did
from 75
up to the 103
that program is still in
place and
um and uh and,
and it is still thriving and,
and we do have good results in terms
of retaining those individuals.
But I also say that that
what we have done in this state
really thank to the
credit of, of,
of our, of,
of, of um
HSD is
to create the Medicaid reimbursement
that has allowed us to grow the GME
programs because those are
individuals that
have been trained somewhere
in medical school
and are spending the last
phase of their training here
in New Mexico.
And so the time frame
to be able to recruit them into the workforce
is a much closer proximity.
And so that's been something
that, that we really focused
on.
>> And then I just want to finish madam
chair with just a couple um
observations. Um
doctor, were you in the room? We
had the last presentation
about the permanent strategic
partnership and what it's been
doing to help with
me um medicine
>> madam chair. No, ma'am.
I >> I I just
want to point this out because I
think this might be part of
how we improve the
situation.
So briefly, this
partnership, it's a
collaboration of
oil and gas companies,
about 26 of them that
uh got together and
they all contribute money
to work on
things that will improve quality of
life in the Permian
Basin.
And one of their um
focus areas is health
care. And so what they have
done, they realized we had a
shortage
in, in the basin. And
so they started
taking
money, not big
sums necessarily,
but for example,
um to Texas tech surgery
and subspecialty, they gave
12 million plus,
they gave uh 12,
12.5 million to the Permian
Basin Behavioral Health
Center. I could go down the
list. There are, let's see,
+5678
medical training
facilities or programs that
they gave money to.
Uh And so here's the
result and this is in the last five
years and it's very
impressive. So
madam chair um
in the last five, this,
this organization has
existed for five years. And
in that span of time,
madam chair, they
have um
produced eight surgery
and subspecialty fellowships
per year.
Um 12 physicians,
assistants per year,
10 family medicine residents
per year, 33
mental and behavioral health
counselors per year,
60 pre-med graduates
per year and
um 130 registered
nurses per year. So
they're making a very big
difference with making a
very strategic
investment in
um in
uh health care
learning. So
not every region
has a group like this,
but it's something to strive
for where they actually
do something very
constructive to help with
the health care. I
want to point out also um
madam chairman that
um at the high school level
here in Carlsbad,
um we have instituted
um academies for the high
school. Every student
must select one
academy in which to learn.
And it's a sequence of
courses. One
of those focus areas is
health sciences. And so
we're growing young
people to be
in, interested in going on
in, in health care.
And then the I guess the final
thing I want to mention
is um when it comes
to behavioral health, that's
been a huge issue here as
well. But
the community
collab groups collaborated
and we now have, I think one of the best
behavioral health programs,
it's called Lifehouse.
It has everything from
detox to
sober living houses
and the community just really
sure that we had some really generous
donors. But
we took this on ourselves,
not waiting necessarily for
a state solution because it just wasn't
coming. So there are some of the things
we've done madam chair. Thank
you.
>> Thank you very much,
representative. All right, we're
gonna move on to Senator
Maestas. You are next
and then Senator >> Rs. Thank
you, madam chair. Thank
you, doctor.
Thank you. So, I'm looking at page
seven,
uh, trends in
physician employment
and you say percentage of
employed
physicians,
what you mean is essentially they have a
boss, right? They're not,
they, they're uh
they're not employing
themselves.
Like in other words, in
other words, it's a movement from
private practice
to the
consolidation trends.
Uh Could you tell me
in your opinion, what,
what is some of the factors
that that are leading to this consolidation
of doctors? >> Um
Madam chair and
Senator Maestas, the, the
reason that individuals move
into that kind of practice
environment is that
that uh that
administratively it is very
difficult to practice so low
medicine, the infrastructure
that is required for things
like electronic uh
documentation
creating of, of of
contracts with
payers. Um
the infrastructure that's
needed to support a medical
practice. Um It's
it, it is harder and harder
to be able to manage that
unless you can come together
and realize economies of
scale to be able to
support that infrastructure.
And then I think that is probably the
biggest driver of it.
And then there's the other driver
of it is that that
individ that, that
that the current practice
of medicine, really individuals are
looking for partners and
a large enough group to
be able to have the support, to be able
to practice with other
colleagues. Because medicine
is incredibly complex.
And then it's also a way to
to not only it's a way to kind of
share important things
like call burden. So
being in a bigger group
offers lots of
economic advantages
to be able to pay for
all the administration.
And it creates the way to be
able to build the infrastructure to
be able to support contemporary
>> medicine. Thank you, madam chair, thank you
doctor. And then at the bottom, you
say
55% of doctors are in
health systems, 22%
in corporate entities. Could you give me an example
of the health systems
>> madam chair, Senator Maestas
University of New Mexico is a health
system, a corporate
entity might be a doctor
owned group um
where it's a, a large
multispecialty group
where the doctors that work there may
or may not be owners of the
group that would be an
example of a corporate entity.
>> So for no, no, I I know the
example but could you name some of
them? Like for example, Presbyterian,
I'm >> just Presbyterian. So Madam
chair Presbyterian University of New
Mexico, ardent are
all big health systems.
Um Optum for
example, is kind of a little
bit in between if you
look at um New Mexico
Gastroenterology group
that would be like a corporate
or new Mexico orthopedics
is a corporate practice, >> understood.
Wonderful. Thank you doctor. Thank you madam
chair. And then also, uh,
um,
with regards to behavioral
health, you, you said some
very wise things.
Uh
um
There was a chart with, oh yeah,
yeah. So on page 15, madam
chair, Behavioral
Hall,
3460
uh persons, 48%
capacity.
Uh you
mentioned reimbursement rates
when I, when, when all the money
in my home county burr, there
was a tax imposed by the county
government. Uh We
now have tons of money at the
state level, although it's only a couple of
years old,
so to speak. I
thought, you know, kind of
build it and they will come if every
nonprofit behavioral health entity
doubled in size.
Uh but it's just not happening as
fast as it needs to happen. You mentioned
reimbursement rates. What are
uh in your opinion, what
are some of the things that need to
happen to
beef up our behavioral health
infrastructure,
>> madam chair Senator
Maestas. It's I believe it is the,
we, we need to, we need to build
infrastructure, we need to support the
reimbursement. Um
And, and then I think we've already
talked about its
recruitment.
>> Thank you. Madam chair.
Um Nothing
prohibits us. In
addition to asking the
Feds to increase
reimbursement, nothing would prohibit
us in law to, to adding to
that theoretically
also, with regards
to
entities, they need, they
need a location, they need a
space. I
think legally nothing would
prohibit us from
building space
and then leasing it to
behavioral health
entities to, to
practice in, in those
spaces. Um
But it's something that we need
to learn as a state government from
folks like yourself
to, to build
that out and recruit and,
and, and make it happen. So anyway,
thank you madam chair.
>> Thank >> you >> Senator
Mao Sander Griggs. You are
next. Thank
you madam chair and thank you
guys for,
for all of that and we need to back
away from this guy a bit, I
guess.
Ok. Ok. On,
on page 15,
we, we talk about our,
our gap and our, our
adequacy.
Uh we
mentioned, we mentioned
dental hygiene and
when you talk about that, are you
talking about the
hygienist or we talking
about dentist? We
what is included in the dental
hygiene? No
>> madam chair, Senator
uh Greggs. In this particular
case, this is dental
hygienist, not
dentist. >> Ok.
Thank you madam madam. Uh
Thank you madam chair. Thank you guys
for that because uh
just a few
years back, we had a big
to do about dental
therapist and
dental hygienist
and the uh the
dealers, there were plenty of
dentist at that
time. There
were questionably
enough
hygienist
because they were all
in Albuquerque.
Uh So the, the
issue when we, when we have
any of these numbers like
this, we're saying that,
ok, statewide,
we're short
60 or we have 64%.
So we're short
36%.
But in
Clayton, New Mexico, we
may be completely short.
We may not have anybody.
Uh Alamogordo
may be shorter than Clovis
or Carlsbad.
Uh So that while the
number gives us an idea of
the, the big picture,
it doesn't really give us
the, the picture
of New Mexico
is in
spots
because Albuquerque, you
may have
all the dental hygienists you
need probably don't,
but you may be closer
than uh than
64% of
them. Uh So
I think that the
number just needs to be kind
of expanded or, or
laid out a little bit differently.
So we would, would have a
better understanding
of that. And if you go
back on, on page
three and you talk about primary
care,
physicians,
practitioners are,
are moving to
hospitals or
groups,
um
I, you know, I believe that
that's what's what's happening in
Alamogordo.
Uh and, and
recently, and
Senator Munoz, Senator
Scher, uh
I believe it was, is
Gallup where the hospital
in, in Gallup
just lost the
uh a lawsuit
and it was a, a
substantial
jury award.
Um What's,
what's starting to concern me
then if, if we look at
the trends
where doctors
are moving to either
hospitals or medical
groups. But
we're seeing awards
like that
for
malpractice, I guess. And
then that's a,
uh,
that's the, whatever
we call damages that are,
can be way high.
Uh, as we,
as we see those things
happen,
how do we intend to
address those
in New Mexico? Because
if the doctors are going to work for the
hospitals,
but the hospitals in are
losing lawsuits
of substantial dollars.
And I, you know, it's, it's
gallop maybe this time
we lost one of nearly
$30 million in
Alamogordo
several years
back. I
mean,
we talk about we have a
shortage of doctor but where
the doctor's gonna
work if
we, if we can't
have
facilities
for them to work in, what,
what do you guys see
as it relates to
that?
Can you briefly respond to that,
please? Yes. >> So,
so madam chair and Senator
Greggs, you're, you're,
you're right on both points.
The rule, the rule needs are
much greater than the urban
needs and,
and in terms of the
impact of
professional liability,
it is a issue
and I think that we
do need to find a balance
between ensuring that patients
and families are adequately
compensated for bad
outcomes and the need
for being able to create a sustainable
delivery system. That's,
that's, I believe that that's a
public policy challenge
in front of us
now
>> and, and madam chair
and, and, and real quick, there's also
been young
pushes in
the recent past because
when we talk about primary
care physicians, talk
about primary care
practitioners.
Uh there's been a push by
advanced care
chiropractors
to be considered
as primary
care practitioners.
Uh in order to meet the
need for that,
as
frankly,
most uh
patients
are referred
if the situation
is uh
is bad
enough. So I
don't, I don't know how y'all
stand on that. I'm not, I don't really
necessarily need to know,
but I, I think as we,
as we look forward, we, we're
gonna have to find other
ways and we don't
have the ways that we
need today.
And I don't know whether that's the right
answer, but that is one
group that
continues to
push to
have the
status of primary care
practitioner. So, thank
you madam chair. Thank >> you,
Senator Greg, Senator Woods.
Thank you madam chair for your
patience. Can
you tell me
approximately how many
doctors have left
New Mexico since
COVID
>> madam chair? Senator
Woods? I don't
have that number, but I could do
some research and get something back
to you. >> Ok. I've
heard as many as
500 is
what I've heard
and why I make
that statement. Uh, you,
you're talking about
facilities
and we've got a
hospital in Clovis
that has shut down one
wing
because
uh, they only have
one surgeon there.
Now, there were
four surgeons,
those four surgeons was
able to keep that
wing occupied
and now it's
completely shut down
and why I bring that
up all
together. I don't mean
to be preaching here madam
chair. The reason I
brought that up is
Clovis and five
counties over there
want to bring in a
behavioral health
center to,
uh, uh,
have housing
for, you know, so many
beds in that
center to,
to,
to function.
And the local
behavioral health people tell
me there's not enough
staff to even staff
that there's not enough
doctors to do that
the community wants
it. They want me
to fund it
somehow
but there's not enough staff to
staff it. And I know
you've said time and time
again it's a
rural
problem.
I've got a hospital
in, in
Tucumcari that's
trying to build a
hospital.
I've got a hospital,
you know, and, and it
can't be much
of a hospital over
a, an emergency
room, er, type
deal to get them on down the
road, but it's right there on I
40.
Uh, and I've also
got a hospital in my district
up at Clayton
and right outside
my
district
is a miner's
hospital
in, in Koufax
County.
All of these hospitals have a
lot in
common,
but not all of them are losing
population. Clovis in
particular has
gained population
because of the cannon air force
base and,
and those people
need O
GB YNS to,
to, you know, things like
that, that, that we don't
have
uh enough
of, and we're
losing health
care
out of state, which
that
happens.
So, thank you for
your time. Uh
I'm concerned
but your
argument that we just need more
facility doesn't
hold up and close.
Thank you. Madam chair.
>> Thank you, Senator
Woods
Dr Richards. Would you briefly
respond to that at this
point? Do you have anything to
add >> madam
chair? And Senator Woods?
Actually, sir, I completely
agree with you. The needs
in our communities need
to be looked at community by community
in some places. Maybe we
don't have adequate
infrastructure and other places.
Maybe we have facilities and we
don't have the workforce.
I will say that it is
gonna be increasingly
challenging for small
facilities to
recruit things. Like you've just
brought up a, you know,
surgeons 20
years ago, the practice of
surgery really
lended itself to
general surgeons being in those
communities and having a
group of two or three,
the current contemporary
practice where
there's so much subspecialist
makes it harder and
I, and I appreciate the struggle
that you
have.
>> Sure. Thank you and thank
you, Senator for bringing that up. I
guess it hit reality when you say
you've heard 500
decisions left the state
and I that, that's
pretty scary, but it could even
be higher. So, thank
you. All righty. We've got
Representative Herndon, thanks
for your patience and you are
the last on my list
and then we
will call it a day as far as
the meeting goes before
tomorrow. Thank >> you. Thank you madam
chair very much.
And um,
Doctor Richards, my
question follows up on one
that Representative Brown brought
up and it's regarding your,
your B A MD
program. A few years
ago, there was a young woman who
graduated from high school, but
she had chosen to have a
child while she was in
high school. She otherwise
qualified for the B
A MD program,
but she couldn't enter it because
you all required those
students to live in a,
in a dorm. She couldn't
live there with her child. Has
that policy been changed?
>> So madam Chair Representative
Herndon. Not,
no, but I can tell you
that uh Dean Finn
is challenging the
the educational leadership at
the School of Medicine to look
at new models
of how we create
the pipeline programs,
um especially
in light of the fact that other
states are creating those kinds
of pipeline pathways.
And so I I don't know
that the change is contemplated,
but I know that the Dean
is looking at new
models.
>> Thank you very much. And madam
chair and doctor
uh Doctor
Richards, I, I do
know that you all have a program
at the university. It's
called communities to
careers. This
year, your budget allowed
for additional 12 point
I mean, an an additional
12.5 million
was given to the university
for discretionary
purposes. And
the question is whether
or not any of that funding
would have gone or is
planning to go to the community's
careers program? And the reason
I ask that is that we
have this process that we're looking
at to grow our
own and the
number of students who
apply to be admitted to
that program with three times
the amount that could be
accommodated based upon the funding
that they have. How are you
planning to resolve that?
>> So madam chair Representative
Herndon, I'm not sure about
where the distribution of that
funding is right
now, but I can follow up
with you on that.
>> Thank you madam chair
and, and Dr Richards. I
have one more question for
you uh with
respect to the
residents and you talked
about the ability that
they were being paid at a
medium rate.
One of the things that the
residents have brought before
this committee is that
the residents in
Colorado and in
Arizona or
surrounding States are making
much more money than they are and
they're very concerned about that.
So last year,
this committee awarded
a 5% raise
to the University of
New Mexico. It doesn't
appear and you might correct me
on that, that none
of that was given to residents.
And this year they're asking for
3.4% to
just sort of help bring them on par
with the surrounding states.
How are we addressing that
issue? So
>> madam chair Representative
Herndon, the three, the,
the I believe the funding you're
referring to is $3.4
million which was in House Bill
two, which was uh
specifically linked to
the supplemental directive
payment program associated with
Medicaid. So the
university um
um has translated
that to a 5%
raise which we started in
January of this year.
We've proposed another
2.5% raise
to the Resident Union,
which would start in July
to give them a 7.5%
raise, which would be more
than the $3.4
million. All of that funding
would be coming from the Medicaid
supplemental directive payment
program. And we've been working
closely with Secretary Aijo
to account for that
expenditure.
>> Thank you very much, Doctor
Richards. Thank you madam
>> chair. Thank you representative
and thanks for always being so
just patient and calm.
We appreciate you.
All righty. I think we are
done for the day. I'm
gonna defer my questions because
I think we're pretty beat already.
So, um, I will
catch you offline if I need
to. Thank you for your
presentation. Your work, Ruben.
You're great too. We appreciate
you. Have a good evening and
see you. Thank you
madam chair. Go ahead, Mr
Chairman. You can announce a
reception
>> Charles
no more 17
page
presentation.
I mean, we drink from a fire hose
all day long and,
and so we're gonna
go from 10 to
4,
but they bring a presentation
that's longer than four pages. We're
gonna roll over them.
It's just, I mean, we've
sat, we've been gone here,
we left here about 745 this
morning. We took a 45 minute lunch
break. I
mean, we can only,
we can only absorb so much
information, right? And
then my brains
shutting off on health care
anyway. But I
mean, we're gonna only
absorb so much information
in a day and it's just, it's getting
the presentations get long and
the questions get long and everybody
wants to ask the question.
So we're gonna have to start shortening some
of these presentations,
period.
Take notice.
Thank you. I appreciate your time. I
know you did a long drive down here
Ruby in. I guess
we'll, we will not dump any
more money until we
get some
data and
performance. 530
reception, 530 reception
is right down the
hall
and it's, we're right on time
for the reception.
Senator Campos. You don't even get to go
comb your
hair
>> programs. And so
that you were, I mean, we're
talking about more,
but what I don't see is how
we are coordinating those in
the cities and programs
are already in place
and there are no long
term resident
facilities. And
MC O is not
necessarily,
can you help us with that? Because
that's, that's really,
I, >> I, I >> believe >> we >> can.
>> And actually even
Friday, we know we're opening
up the Crisis Triage
Center. That's kind of a
demonstration of.
