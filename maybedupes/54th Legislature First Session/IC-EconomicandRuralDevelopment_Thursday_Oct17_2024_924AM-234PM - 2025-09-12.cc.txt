Good morning, everyone.
Arney.
Well, very
excited to be here
at Netflix today and very
excited to get on
our tour. Um
It was a big
um
I think I, I know
Dan worked really hard to
make sure that this happened. So
Dan Ajar. So thank you so
much and thank you all for hosting
us. We have had a
great couple
days here in, in
Albuquerque. Um
Just the hospitality
and just the presentations
have been wonderful.
Uh No, no
pressure on you, but you know, we're
gonna wrap up here with you. So I hope
you in good. And
um but with that,
I'm gonna go ahead and just turn it over
to you if you'll introduce yourself
and get, go ahead and start with your
presentation. Uh
Welcome and,
and uh look forward to hearing
your presentation.
>> Thank you, madam, chair members of
the committee.
Uh You'll look at your thing
and you'll notice that I am
not Shanie Harvey.
Uh I am Mark Roper,
uh officially the
division Director of Economic
Development for, for the
Economic Development
Department and
also currently acting film
director for the film division.
Uh While we look
to replace that position.
Uh Shani is on a well
earned vacation in a
place called Thailand. So
she's not going, uh she
offered to
try to do this virtually and
I told her that,
uh I would
cover for her.
Um So the
creative industry division is where
I'm gonna start today.
Uh It's a brand new division
within the department that was
established by,
um by the legislator
legislature two years
ago, uh
in which we uh
got money
uh two years ago,
the division was stood
up. Uh And then
last year, we actually got
FTEs to this
position and
Shane has been
selected to be the
director
of the Creative
Industries division. Uh
And uh we
currently have uh
the second position
fill. Uh they will
uh they will be starting their
position in November
uh as the second uh
person in the Creative Industries
division. So we will be fully
staffed uh
the by November
1st in, in the Creative Industries
division.
So, real real quick,
we'll go to page uh page
two. I don't think they're numbered
necessarily, but we'll go to
page two and uh
we'll talk a little bit about
the Creative Industries
division uh
as stood up by the new Mexico
legislature. Uh
We're looking
to uh advance
creative industry based
economic development, supporting
entrepreneurs and small
businesses and
really trying to
assist organizations and
individuals uh
to
support their creative industry
companies and workers
through education through
workforce training
and a lot of what, what this
division is going to have to
do is really
understanding the
needs uh from
an infrastructure standpoint.
Uh and
infrastructure we always
think of as roads and sidewalks.
But infrastructure can
also be just getting
organizational structure
together to help these
people that are people
in these businesses that are
in this creative
realm,
get into business.
Uh because they have,
they have great talents, they have great
skills, they have great
products. Uh but they
may not necessarily be
that uh have
that
entrepreneur uh
business spirit. Uh
they're very creative. And
so a big portion of
what this industry is going to be
doing is serving as that
liaison, helping
those people advance
theirselves uh within the
industry and ultimately
growing the economy uh on
the creative side.
So as I mentioned it, it,
it was uh
it was stood up by
the division as we go to page or
by the legislature as we go to
page three under HB
eight. And
that did come with
a special appropriation of
$2 million.
What we did there is we went out
to, we did rps
for grant applications
and, and we were looking for
communities to
submit ideas
and, and part
of that was to try to figure out
what were the community's ideas
under creative industries
uh and try to get that,
that what that idea flow
and, and understand because
not everything's the same
across the state of North Dakota as
you guys very well know,
there's a big difference uh uh
across the state,
whether you're in the northwest or the
southeast or
uh southwest and
northeast. So
we accepted those
applications. We were able to
award 18 grants totaling
$1.8
million
to those communities. And,
and we got some really
good uh feedback
and really great projects
and, and the little green stars
on that map uh show
you where all those uh
where all those projects
went. So we did get a
good distribution
across the state of New Mexico.
We didn't cover the entire state,
but we did get a good distribution
across the state.
We also provided capacity
for 82 partnerships
across educational
institutions, industry
associations.
In that first year, we were able to
assist nearly 1200
entrepreneurs and supported
34 programs across
those uh 18 different
awards.
Moving on to page
page four.
Um The Creative
Industry divisions also
completed their strategic
plan with the remaining 200
k of that uh
appropriation.
They hosted the inaugural
Creative Industries uh week
as part of that RP.
So the contractor assembled
the creative Industry week
across the State of New
Mexico. And as
I mentioned, we have now uh
officially thanks
to the appropriation this
year, uh
hired a division
director and a
coordinator.
And you can see
that uh just
the, the
things that we were able
to do that first week of June
during the creative start-ups by
some of the illustrations
there
in a quick snapshot
Mexico's creative
economy, about
$6 billion in annual
activity,
$1.6
billion in taxable
wages,
12% of all G
RT establishments
are creative industry. That's a really
big number.
Um When I mean, when we
talk about 12%
of the G RT collected in
New Mexico is coming from the creative
economy. That's a big
number.
And there's also showing that uh
we've had a good
growth pattern. 100 and 18%
growth uh projected
for arts, entertainment and
recreation uh since
2023. So
it's, it's a growing industry.
It's one we can capitalize
on and you can see it has good
return uh
directly back
into uh not only into
the economy but direct
fiscal return back to the
state in the, in the form of G
RT.
So where are
our future
opportunities? Uh
The strategic plan
identified
uh cultural heritage
and innovation at the very
top
experiential
economy uh
that you know, being able to go
in, see touch, feel
under in this creative uh
economy. A good
example of that is
uh is this little place called
Mealor in Santa Fe? You might
have might have been there.
Uh That's one of those
experiential uh
type experiences, that's
part of the economy
uh reinvigorate. Uh
Again,
reinvigorate is
capital for the economy,
really identify capital
for that economy, where is capital
available and how and how can
people access
capital
may not know how
to, how to find
that. Uh
And then again, using
data uh to
help uh to help
drive and uh
feed the strategic
plan and
then making
um education
learning experience
part of part of that overall
economy uh that not
everything has to do
be stem
stem is a quality part
of the economy. But, but there
are other industries within the
economy that can be also very
helpful that are outside of STEM.
And the creative economy is one of
those,
I'll now quickly transition
because I know you guys want to
get onto a tour
with my good friend Nick
Maniatis. So,
um New Mexico film
and incentive
overview
uh that is me
there. Uh Currently
uh I, I do
anticipate that uh
Secretary Black and
Governor Lujan Grisham
will have a new film director in
place in the very
near future and, and I
will be able to shed that title
also. So uh
but real quick, uh
we'll just, we'll just
go through a couple of things
about film in
New Mexico. And,
and
what else can we see
Oppenheimer Academy
award-winning,
filmed in New Mexico about
New Mexico.
Uh It, it,
it was so
much New Mexico. It was
a great film. I don't know if
everybody's seen it.
Um Everybody told
me before I went and saw Man. It's
really long and it's
like, and
I sat there and, and to be
honest, I was so enthralled with
the movie that I never, I didn't
realize I was there for three hours.
It was just an absolutely phenomenal
movie and I understand
why it won an Academy Award.
But
uh and then
equally uh we
just had the, the
premiere of this
event here in Albuquerque
of Res Ball
uh filmed
and produced in New Mexico
uh and
written
and directed by
a New Mexican. Uh
She grew up in, she grew
up in Gallup. Uh She
was a co writer on this film.
She's the direct, she was the
director of this film.
Uh Talk about a
great New Mexico story,
a young lady that uh grew
up in Gallup, got
her educate port a portion
of her education at
CNM.
Uh
Now she's producing films
for lebron James
productions
being uh being
a Netflix production.
Uh and it's a great movie
if uh I know uh
Senator Maestas
was at the premiere.
Um But if you haven't
logged into Netflix,
it's now up on
Netflix. And I would encourage
you to, to look at
that too. Out of
range is uh seasons
one and two, that's an Amazon
Prime series. So as you can
see, as I go through these,
it's not just this beautiful
facility of Netflix, our
Cornerstone, New Mexico,
our first film partner,
but virtually any,
any film industry
logo that you
recognize they're
doing work here in New Mexico.
And it really is a testament
to how this industry has
grown since the tax credit
first came into
place
uh many years ago during
the Governor Johnson
administration, uh we
really are, are now in a
position where we have
a growing and, and
good workforce uh
in, in the film industry
and we're attracting quality
productions. Dark
Winds is now in its third
season uh here
in New Mexico
as we get a little more
uh into what's coming
up. Uh Duster is
a HBO series
uh Eddington, an, a 24
film feature Apple
TV is doing
the US with Matthew
mcconaughey. Uh
And hopefully we'll convert
him from loving Texas to New
Mexico eventually.
Uh That would be my goal.
Uh You can see that
uh since 2019,
we filmed in 85
different locations here in New
Mexico. It doesn't all just
happen here in a studio like
this. It, it happens on
location across
New Mexico and you
can see a list of,
of those communities.
Uh I won't read them all to you,
but you can see it's a wide
variety of 85 different
places here in New
Mexico.
When you talk about uh
productions, you, you,
we measure it and how
and how much each production
spends. And as you can see
historically,
since uh
fiscal year
three,
to fiscal year 24
we've seen a, a very,
uh a very strong
growth in
production spend here here
in New Mexico. You can
see a couple of dips in there. I,
I think one of them you can uh
easily the,
the 2020
year is pretty easy to
explain as to what that
dip was about. We all experienced
and lived through COVID. Uh
And we know what that was.
Um And then you can see that
there's a, a little bit of a dip
from our high point there and
uh between Fy 22
and Fy 23
to this current year and
that, that was due to some labor
unrest and, and, and some
strikes that happened.
But we're, we're now seeing
that uh a little bit, we're seeing
that bounce back now that those
have, uh that
strike has been, those strikes
have been settled and
the uh threat
of a strike with the
teamsters has been put to
rest. So we're starting
to see that, that, that
number change and go back
in a positive direction.
But, but even with that,
uh with those things, you can
still see it's a really
huge increase over
the years and very much a vibrant
part of the, of the
economy.
Uh thanks to
the
legislature, when
you recognize that
we needed to push
this uh
outside of the corridor,
outside of the Santa Fe Albuquerque
Corridor. And you put
in a 5% rural
uplift and we saw Bump
it. It helped
uh for those films
being filmed outside of that
60 mile corridor
around uh Albuquerque
Santa Fe, but
it wasn't the bump we were hoping
for. And so you went back
and
made it double that to
10%. We really
saw a huge
increase uh in
rural productions because
because of that. So,
um I
know
Representative Armstrong is
going to tell me that
that zone
is unfairly
includes
Magdalena.
Uh and
I won't disagree with
her.
Uh But I,
I can tell you, I, I know,
I know why those
zones were, were
chosen. Uh
And it's simply because
it aligns with what
the uh with
what the unions will
pay in per diem. That
if you get outside of that 60
miles, the unions
require per diem to be paid
to their workers to travel outside
of that zone. And that's what
the uplift is uh
set to
counteract. Uh
So, so to encourage
companies to go outside of that
zone and not be a, not
be out a financial risk to them
because they have to pay per
diem. Uh And
unfortunately, for those
and, and Magdalene is not
alone. I just know I've
heard Representative Armstrong
uh say that more than
once. Um
There's other communities that get
caught in that also such
as Taos
um and, and
uh the places like that,
but that is the reasoning
behind it. Uh Not
everything is fair. Uh But
that's the, that's the best
way we could. Uh
we, the collective, we
including you the legislature
uh to implement the rural
uplift. But again, thank you, we've
seen a really great
uh improvement
uh in this past year since
the 10 since we went from 5
to
10%.
So, when you talk about jobs,
it's
um
it's different than the,
than what I would call my
traditional world of economic
development. In my, in my traditional
world, it's really easy
to, to count jobs
because they're, they go
to a plant to assemble
something, make something
uh on a
daily basis year
round. Uh And
so it's real simple to
get their U I reports
track how many jobs they
have and
that's simple. Uh We can
track jobs, we can attract
uh track payroll really,
really simply film
industry is different. Every film
is its own, is its own
company.
Every single production
is most likely stood
up as an LLC.
And that's how, and so
those that work on that
film will receive
either A W-2 or a 1099
depending on the arrangement
for that
production. And
at the end of the year, they've been
employed on
789
different productions over the
year,
which means they have 789
WWS or 1090
nines, but
we don't have an easy place
to go say how many
people are employed. So
it, it does, it
does take a little bit
of uh
looking at the
spend
understanding uh
traditionally how much of that
spend is spent on
payroll understa
and how much of that is spent
on other services, uh
equipment,
materials, those types of
things. And then
looking at what the average wages
are. And then we can have a pretty
good assumption
based on the spend
based on the
percentage which right now runs
about 47%
uh, of the spend is
spent on payroll on the remaining
53% is spent
on other materials and
services. So we can,
we can come up with a pretty good
calculation of how many
jobs are in the industry.
And then we can look at other things
uh such as union
enrollment like I ac
480 of
uh nearly 2000
people that are
union members.
And you'll see this uh
1452 people
on overflow.
Uh What's a person in
overflow?
Uh Those are people that are
yet to achieve
their union card status.
Maybe they don't have enough
hours. Uh There
could be a couple of most
likely, that's the most likely
reason, but they're an overflow.
So when every, when all
1911 people
are working and actively
engaged, then the union
goes to the overflow where those
people then get their experience
to ultimately get to their
card. So
when you, when you look at that, that's
really
uh
a number of uh about
of about 3300,
nearly 3500 people
that are just in a AI
and then when you look at the
uh the other uh
industries
that are listed there, I won't read
them all to you. But uh
uh you, you can
see that it's a very strong
uh membership uh
there. And
that uh that 8000
estimate is, is backed
up by some good
data.
So, uh
wages,
it's important. We,
we hear conversations about
livable wage all the time
and, and we all know that
uh you know what it takes to live
on a daily basis. So
seeing an increase in
wages is uh
is always a good thing
uh for the residents
of New Mexico. And that's really
our ultimate goal from an economic
development standpoint
is to create, is
to create career paths and
opportunities for New Mexicans
to improve their financial
positions. So
seeing a 39%
wage increase is a very
positive sign.
Um in that industry,
of course, you know, inflation
does have some uh
some impact on that, but not
all of it. Uh
The uh we
haven't had a 39%
inflation increase but
i it does play some impact
but the bigger impact is the fact
that we're just having more quality
films, uh
more
uh
productions happen in New
Mexico at the higher level,
uh which is seeing this great
increase in wages and
really creating a solid industry
in New Mexico.
So you can see that the average
wage now is 3675
an hour, which is about
$74,000 a
year, a very solid
income.
Everybody wants to talk about
uh the tax credit um
because it is one of the
reasons they're here. Um
let's, let's not dispute
that uh the incentive
is one of the reasons that people
uh like to
film in New Mexico. We have
great landscapes, we have
great facilities that you're going
to get to tour today.
Um But ultimately,
you know, as in any business
activity, bottom line is
the, is the key
factor. And so,
uh you know, our incentive program
is uh is important
to the health of the, of the
industry.
See, as you can
see
here, there's two different
uh historic
trends there. Uh
partner and
non partner, non
partners or all those
films that are filmed here that have
not entered into a partnership
agreement with New Mexico.
That would mean any production
that is not Netflix,
NBC Universal
or 8 to 8 productions.
Um 88
to 8 productions in Las Cruces
is the third film
partner. Uh
So those, those
numbers there.
Um But you can see uh
cumulatively
uh in, in thousands
of dollars where the tax
credit
is
and then
uh you just talk
yesterday on return on
investment uh
from, from
our uh other programs in
economic development. Uh
But we also look
at how, you know, we can,
again,
what's the return on
investment for the tax
credit? Uh What do
we get back out of it?
And uh the ultimate
major is that we're, we're
just under $8
in economic impact
back to the State of New Mexico
for every dollar that we put,
we put into the program.
Uh So we are seeing a return
uh return on our
investment and overall
economic
growth.
So, the New Mexico Media Arts
Coll uh Collective
that again, thanks to
the New Mexico Legislature
is currently being
constructed and
built in two locations in New
Mexico.
Uh It was
established in uh by the
legislature in 2022.
Uh There was a $40
million appropriation.
Um 20
million of that came out of the capital
outlay stack and the, the
other 20 million uh came
out of ARPA funds.
Uh And that is uh
currently working
on building two facilities, one
in Albuquerque and one in Las
Cruces, both
in conjunction with Institutes
of Higher Education.
The Albuquerque campus at
the rail yards is a partnership
between the city of Albuquerque,
the New Mexico Media Arts
Collective and Central
New Mexico University.
Um And then you also,
then we have the uh
project in Las Cruces
that is a partnership between
the New Mexico Arts
Collective,
New Mexico State University
and Arrowhead. Uh
And they are building
a uh
digital um
media stage
uh there in Las Cruces on
the AC I property,
a couple of quick
pictures of the rail
yard project
and process.
Um, there's, there's
still a lot of work to be done,
but we are on track
at this point to
open the doors in
January of
2026.
I know it seems like a long time
away but, uh, it,
uh, it does, it does
take time to uh
remediate and
build things, uh when
you're trying to go into a historical
structure like that. So it
does, it does take some
additional uh
time, but you can
also see some of the,
um, uh,
the modeling of what it's
going to look like upon
completion and
then the Las Cruces, uh because
it is going to be from ground
up, it's going to
also be opening in the spring
of 2026 even though
we, uh we
just now are putting a shovel
into the ground on that
project, but it's going to happen
much faster because it is a ground
up build
and they're
currently
working on which
company will, will do that.
There's two really quality companies
out there that, that will
most likely buy for
uh who will put that in there, that
build stages like
this uh across
the world.
Uh And then on the Las
Cruces, uh
the the difference
between the two facilities
um CNM
will overall
operate uh the
facility at the rail yards
as part of their institution
and the new Mexico Media Arts
collaborative
in in collaboration
with them will, will
work on their
uh additional educational
resources that are over and
above what the 16 member
institutions do across the
state and teaching into the film
industry.
The facility in Las
Cruces will be a
partnership
between New Mexico State
University
Arrowhead and
a third party operator.
So when the facility is
completed, they will have
a third party operator.
It won't be a Netflix, but
it'll be somebody like Netflix
that will lease the facility
and operate it as a,
as an active
production
facility. Uh
And then when during the
downtime in
between shows those types of
things, that's when New Mexico State
University AC I will be
able to use the facility
for educational
opportunities. Part of
that agreement will be
that all those productions
that that third party vendor
brings into that facility
will require a
portion of paid
internships from
the AC C and New
Mexico State University will be
used on those productions.
So it'll be a hands-on learning
approach to that
facility. But at the same
time, uh be able
to maximize the
the usage of that facility
by opening it up to,
to productions
and it will be the first
completed full-size stage in
Las Cruces, which will be a really
big deal to that to that
area.
We don't have a, we don't have
sticks and bricks to have classes
yet into the media arts
collective. And these
aren't uh uh I
will say these are not reflective
of the types of things that will be
taught there
ultimately. But
there's some things that the industry
saw that we needed some
uh we needed some help on
right now. So this
year, we're going to have these
uh these
programs taught through the
collective as part of
this year's curriculum.
Uh in conjunction
with OSI uh
CNMU and M
will be doing the Mac
Safety Pack and
then there will be other webinars
and in person
uh lecture
series that will happen in
multiple locations in New
Mexico, including
some rural locations.
So, uh
again, these aren't the types
of things that you're going to see
ultimately at the media, but
there are things that the industry needed
right now. And it's a good
way to start actually
moving people through
uh these that are,
that are needed for the industry to
start getting that uh that
on board.
Um And then finally on
the media arts collective,
you know, here's a couple
of other initiatives. Honor
song.
A big thank you to Senator
Shino. Uh
He, it, it was his
dream, uh his
push, uh they
got the money together to do
this um wonderful
documentary
uh talking about
uh us
history.
There will be a premiere
uh uh on
uh the Native American
veterans uh at
the Veterans Memorial on November.
The second uh
invitations will be going out
very soon. Uh
And you're all uh
very much welcome to
come and attend that premiere of the
uh of this, of
this. Uh We're
also as part of the
collective. Uh
They're working on a data
dashboard that will be
comprehensive and complete.
They're working in conjunction with the
higher education department to
do that. And
of course, um
we wouldn't be complete if we
didn't tell you a couple of things that we
want. Uh So,
uh this year, we,
we will say that
um we will have
a $1.5 million
request to
for ongoing operations
at, at the mini Arts
Collective at this, at this
point. Um You know,
we, we are not
bringing in any revenue from these
outside sources. And
so, but at the same time, we
still need to stand up these programs
and push forward and
complete what we've invested
now
somewhere in the neighborhood of
60 million public
dollars. But we need
to, we need to invest in the
people uh in the things
to make, necessary
to, to move forward and not
just have empty buildings sitting
there. And then
one of the things that came out of one of
the governor's town
halls
uh that and uh
cabinet in your community
was what happened to the Governor's
Cup. Uh The Governor's Cup
competition
um
was a competition
that happened several administrations
ago and disappeared
somewhere along the way.
Uh We are in the midst
of reinstill
the Governor's Cup
and, and we don't
have all the rules and everything in
place. But ultimately, it will
be for people to
submit
scripts and
ideas for
productions and then they will be
given uh not
only and they will be given
an acknowledgement, but they will be
giving some financial resources
to then take those and
market those those ideas.
That's what the ultimately
Governor's Cup is going to be
about. So I know
you're really looking forward to a
tour. So thank you
for the time and, and thank
you for no questions.
Uh
And, and, but again, thank
you very much for your time and
I, and I will be happy to answer any
questions that I
can.
>> Thank you for your presentation.
First on the list is
Senator Hamlin. >> Thank
you madam chair and thank you, Mark.
Um You know, I'm always excited
and, and inspired about
this because I feel it's one of the
several cogs that we need in
order to diversify our economy
because uh we
really need to look at all of our
different options.
Um You know, in
uh in Las
Cruces, we had
this a couple of years ago
where there was a training session
for local businesses
to be able to provide
craft services and any of the
auxiliary services that a film
production would require.
Is there a statewide program
that helps when
they're in communities work
with the local businesses in that
area if they're available
to help provide those
auxilia auxiliary
services.
>> Madam, chair members of the
committee, Senator
Hamlin, uh
we can stand up that
program on a one by one
basis. But to say there's,
there's a program in
place that is
standing. No, but
when the need is there such
as what happened in Las
Cruces? Yes, we have the ability
to stand up and do it,
but we don't have
just a standing program
that's done on a statewide basis.
>> Ok. Is there a way to like maybe
put on the website
if you want to be part of this?
These are the things you need to have in place
because that's what they did down in Las Cruces
was here are the things
that you should have in place in order
to be able to
provide services to
a production set.
>> Uh madam chair
members of the committee, Senator Hamlin,
that's, uh that's an excellent
idea. And, and I know one of the
things that uh
uh Secretary Black
is charged
with is to improve
websites across the board
uh for our department uh
to be more
user-friendly and have
better data, better,
um better things uh
for that very
similar to uh the question
that uh Representative
Armstrong had yesterday.
>> All right, thank you. I appreciate that.
And it's just really ways to
kind of keep that money in our community.
We're talking about how much money this is
going back into our
community, but
we often don't think of the other
support services that are
provided for that, not just
the film crews
um and all of the staff
that would be required to put on a
production, but we also
know craft services.
Um maybe,
uh you know, uh entertainment
opportunities uh when there
are downtime so on and so forth.
Any of that. I think it'd be,
it'd be helpful because it would help us in the
community. Like if
there's a business that seems like it
would be appropriate and give a
chance. Um We'd like
to do that, our friend Russell who
was here yesterday,
he was free. He's
frequently asked to cater
for movie uh set
productions. And
so, um
you know, we'd like to, I, I think that's a
good opportunity for people throughout
the state. And I think film Las Cruces would
give you the criteria that you could just
put on your website.
Um And then,
and, and speaking of that, and
this is more of just kind
of suggestions. I made the
suggestion uh two
years ago. Um
So movies filmed in
Georgia,
Avengers, Ozark,
that's television show Hunger
Games, All Three Black
Panther. And, you
know, they're filmed there because at the
end, it says
made in Georgia and
it has a giant peach on
it. And
I think any of our
movies, any of the television
shows that are filmed in New Mexico
can say made in
New Mexico with a red and
green chili. I don't
think we should use the Zia. We already
culturally appropriate that enough as it
is. But I think we're known
for our chilies. Is there a
possibility that that can be
something because
not only is that branding
films in New
Mexico, but
if I were to ever go to
Georgia, I would
pay attention and want like, wanna go
see these spots because I now
know that it was filmed in
Georgia.
>> Uh madam chair members of the committee,
Senator Hamlin, uh we do have
a requirement that New
Mexico is, is
uh logo
is on any
film that's, that's produced
here. Uh And, and
uh Mr Manian can
talk to talk
to during the tour about
about how it's done. But I really
like uh your idea
that maybe it
should, it's on there
when you, it says >> it will
say made in New Mexico.
You know what I'm talking about?
The, that giant
peach >> it's not as
prominent. So
I think that's an excellent
suggestion to
see uh how we
couldn't do that in a, in a better
fashion. It's there.
It's just not as prominent
and, and as well displayed as
those in Georgia. >> And maybe
I know, there, there might be some
more, um, legs
to that. But I think
just a graphic at the
end of anything made in New
Mexico use the colors
but red and green chili. I mean, that's
what we're known for,
um, you know, throughout the country
and then with that,
what that can spring up and this is
where I start thinking about like, marketing
and pr is
like, where in New Mexico campaign?
Because you listed all those
85 sites
that could be a whole
tourism thing of
like, I mean, and, and that I know happened
because of Oppenheimer
is that people wanted to go and see
those sites.
Um You know, there are a couple of
movies filmed in Messia and I'm like,
oh, there's such and such
shop. Um
You know, we, we kind of do
that with like several shows
that were filmed in Albuquerque was like,
oh yeah, like breaking bad. It's like, oh,
yeah, I've been there every
time I see that hotel at the corner
right off the highway, I think of
that. And so I'm wondering
if there's, there's an effort
that could be a partnership with the tourism
department that could
be, you know, where in New Mexico
here's the movie, here's
the actual location.
Um I mean, it can be
flushed out a little bit, but I'm just thinking if
we're talking about really
maximizing
the economic impact of this
industry
that we can make it available to
everyday people, not just people who
are gaffers and people who are
skilled in the film
industry, but also
the consumers
because I certainly
want to be able to go and see
sites. Um when I
drive by the dark
winds studios and I see the
police cars, I
love that
and, and I, I think
that's, that's making it to
where the film
industry is relatable to every
single New Mexican. Not
people in the field,
not people who are providing the
auxiliary services, but people
who are the consumers of the media
itself
and like simple
tourism things
made in New Mexico
where in New Mexico can
you
to every single New
Mexican?
I like our space program
but my neighbors, the
guy who cuts my neighbors with
grass
going into space is not something
that's gonna happen, going to
the movies most likely
will. And seeing
television shows that are filmed
in New Mexico are way
more accessible to people in New
Mexico than some of our
other industries. And I just think it might
be, you know, an idea to
flush out and
like really capitalize
on because that's a whole new tourism
thing,
especially for people who are renting
those rvs. A
lot of people from Europe who are renting
the rvs and going throughout our
state,
they might like to go see those
too.
>> Madam chair remembers. I think
that's an
excellent,
I will, I will call acting Secretary
Adams as I'm driving back
to the office. >> I mean,
it's not >> like it's not
seriously. I mean, that's an excellent
suggestion. >> Yeah, it's not a
mandate. It's just something that I think
as a consumer
I would like to see, I would like to
see television shows that say Made New
Mexico. It's my state. I'm
proud of it. Um,
and I get, I get a little
testy when I see made in Georgia all
the time, which is, you know, the
Hollywood of the South, we
should be the Hollywood of the Southwest
and, but we also
want to make sure that our
residents, everyday residents
benefit from this industry
too. Um And
I think that there are ways that we can get that
investment by just
making it a little bit more
accessible.
That's, that's all madam chair and,
and I, and thank you for being open to
those ideas. Um
When you the first show that comes
out with a maid in New Mexico and the
green chilies, I just want
to be there with
it. Thank you, madam
chair.
Thank you, >> Representative
Herndon.
>> Thank you madam chair. And
thank you. Um Mark
one of the big items
that has been going on is
the New Mexico Academy
for the Media Arts. The high
school charter school
has been working really diligently
on putting together a documentary
on how students are feeling
coming out of the
pandemic and their mental
health and stress.
And they really wanna collaborate
with Netflix on that
documentary. How can
we make that
happen,
>> madam, chair members of the committee
Representative Herndon, you're in the right
place. Um
I, I would, I would
suggest you, uh you
ask uh while you're
on the tour uh of
what their process
is uh
to
uh to be
able to get a production
on Netflix. I, I know
there's just like anything in
the world, there's, there's
rules, there's regulations
uh that they have to follow
and then they have their own internal
processes. But
I, I would ask, I would
ask while you were on the tour
>> and thank you madam chair and thank
you, Mark and one other question
going back to your
presentation and
if I look back and you
indicate for every dollar
that we invest
in a tax credit, we get
$8 back. Tell,
tell me how we are seeing
that
>> uh madam chair members of the
committee representative
Herndon, uh that
is uh that is an
economic impact
number. So,
so that, that number
is,
um you
know,
how many jobs
have been
indirectly
created
and then how and
over economic
jobs have been
on uh
discretionary spend
and how that's affected gross receipts
tax on
property
tax and whether
they are renters or
buyers, uh that's all
calculated in there.
And then uh
also on personal
income tax. And then we also
look, and
so that come
from,
we also look at the
uh ancillary jobs or
the additional jobs such as
caterers, con uh
contractors,
equipment, rental places, those
types of things that uh
that are there and
the impact that they have on the
economy. So it's an
overall look
at all the impacts that
those uh those
productions have on the
economy. And it's,
it's a 7.7 to 1
ratio.
>> Thank you, madam chair. Thank you,
Mark
Senator >> Maestas.
Thank you madam
chair.
Uh Thank, thank you doctor. Thank
you. Uh uh page
18,
page 18 on the
tax credit
payouts,
we have the dark blue, which is the
non partners
and then the light which is the
partners
on that flight 24.
That's from
a
just 3.5 months.
July,
that's last year. Um last
year until the June
30th
did the partners not like
submit their,
their invoices. How was
it? $9.54
million?
>> But
that madam chair
members of the committee,
Senator
Maestas.
Um
that's a really good. I don't
know that I know the answer as
to why, why it was
such a small
number? Uh
I mean that that was
partially a strike affected
year. So maybe
that uh
maybe that had a bigger
impact on
uh studios
uh than the other uh
productions.
I I
don't, I I
can get that answer for
you but I personally don't
know the know the answer for
that. But let me, let me check and
see what that difference is. Thank
>> you madam chair. Thank you, Mr No, you're
correct. That strike hit the
productions hard. The
um
and then tell us a little bit about the film
office. How many do you know by
chance how many
workers
are in the film
office?
>> Uh The film office
currently has a staff
of uh six
people.
>> Ok. And then,
um and then also
madam chair the uh
the um
so let us know if the chief
executive wants to tweak the
statute.
Uh you
know, it's a, it's tough
to, to do
a bill on that statue because there's so
many moving parts and it's tough to
manage. But um
but the uh the, it's
actually a requirement. Uh
madam chair Senator, it's
actually a statutory
requirement that
a filmmaker put that at the
end. So if
we do open up the statute
and, and to do some improvements
on it, we can then change the
statute to explicitly
say, you
know, graphic of
such size or whatever. But
it's a,
nothing, nothing would
prohibit the
filmmaker from doing it anyway.
But, but um
but yeah, it, it had took a
stato requirement to, to make that
happen. And then,
um
and then also with regards to
the, the
school,
this is um
you know, some of the bills in the past
kinda shaved up for
percentage or, or, or
attempted to shave a percentage or
two and
funnel it back into
uh local interns, local
um
local work programs and stuff like
that. And now that we have so much money. Now,
we do the, we
just, you know, because of the leadership
of the gov, we just created the
um trying to
find it
the, essentially the
um
the film school,
essentially. Um
And so there's gonna be a
headquarters. Oh,
here we go. Page 20
actual media arts collectives,
a $40 million
investment
uh main campuses
in Albuquerque satellite campus and
cruises. You give me, I
think you mentioned this. But could you give us a
quick update? So the the
Albuquerque campus is gonna be housed
at CNM. Could you
tell us a little bit about how
that's coming into? Um
fruition
>> madam chair members of the Committee,
Senator Maestas. The, the
Albuquerque campus is actually
located at the rail yards
uh in Albuquerque
and, and CNM
City of Albuquerque and
the media arts collaborative
are collectively
working on developing
that facility. So
CNM will have
uh all the, all of
their film training programs
will take place at this new
facility. Uh
and then the facility will be
available to the Media Arts
Collective
for
II I guess the best way
to describe it is we have 16
member institutions of which
CNM and N MS U are, are
two of them. But there's 16
member institutions of higher
education out there that are
teaching film
uh studies. And
we've all agreed
collectively through higher
education on a
set curriculum
for that basic
film studies that all
16 member institutions
are now teaching
what, what the vision of the
media arts collective is
to use an, an education
term is like a master's
program. Um
They get the basics at
the 16 member
institutions and then the next
level up uh of
training will happen at the
media arts collaborative.
Uh That's the vision.
So they won't be doing the,
they won't be interfering
or doing the same things
that member institutions are
doing. Uh They
will be doing basically the next
level of these will be
things that aren't offered
by a AI or other
unions and their training
packages. These won't be things
that are offered by members of
higher education. These
are specific
trainings uh that will
be uh useful
in the industry to
take them to the next level,
to get into the higher paying
positions.
Six
months.
>> Thank you madam, chair
director for the, the UN M
Film department.
Um
There was conversations a while back
that the UN M Film department
wasn't necessarily
in line with the curriculum.
Uh that was kind of doing something
different. Do you know anything
about that or can you comment
on
>> madam chair,
madam, chair members
of the committee, Senator Maestas.
Uh what I can
speak to is that there
was uh a
time when there
was probably
16 member institutions
teaching 11 different
things. Uh
But, but that has
uh there, there has been some
collaboration and
cooperation
um between all
16 member institutions
to agree on a set
of curriculum uh
that they're all comfortable
with and, and that they're all in
line with. So uh
I believe that has that
has uh changed.
>> Thank you so much madam chair. Thank you
for that. The um also with
regards to the incentives, what's,
what's super,
super, super neat is
um
is uh is when
the,
is when the film shows
New Mexico shows the various
towns the various landscapes
uh as opposed to being
in a, in a, in a studio.
And so folks who
watch the film, you
know,
ca can be made aware that it
was filmed in New Mexico.
There's another aspect of a film
in which New Mexico is actually a
character in the
movie. Uh
And what I mean by that is that
like
Longmire was filmed here, but it was,
the character was Wyoming, it was the
fictional place was Wyoming
Breaking Bad, was filmed here and the
fictional place was Albuquerque
or New Mexico. So New
Mexico was in fact a character
in the movie. There's also
another aspect of moviemaking
in which the moviemaker
tells a New Mexico story,
like Oppenheimer or even
historical fiction, like some
of the Billy, the kid movies and stuff
like that. So I think
what was talked about uh the last
time the bill came
around uh but
didn't have broad support at the time
was to do a tiny
incentive uh
like 2% or something
to telling a New Mexico story
or 1%.
If in fact, New Mexico is a
character in the, in the,
in the film.
So uh so if the
chief executive wants to,
wants to improve on the
statute, that's, that's some stuff we could
think about between now and
now and January. Thank
you madam chair. And just lastly, I
want to thank Netflix. I want to thank
all the partners, all the
filmmakers. I'm
just so grateful personally and,
and as a, as an elected
official to all the moviemakers,
they um I think we have
the best blue-collar crew
in this country.
Uh And slowly,
hopefully we can get more and more workers
above the line.
Uh Because that's the dream, that's the plan,
you know, that, that there's a Tyler
Perry out there somewhere madam
chair, New Mexico, Sherman Alexei.
There's um uh
when New Mexicans start uh
dominating above the
line, that's when the tax
incentive will truly truly
uh make its mark. So, thank
you, >> Manager.
Thank you, Representative
Matthews.
Thank you madam chair.
Um Thank you Mr
Roper for your
presentation.
Um
That better.
Um
There was a meeting
that we had
during the regular, one of
the regular sessions of
this committee.
Um And
I can't remember whether it was last
year or the year before,
but a
group of extras
had come in
and were
complaining about
not being paid
about mistreatment
and other kinds of issues
like that.
And I don't
remember specifically what
they were asking us to
do, but we, we didn't
pass, we, we
didn't uh consider
any particular legislation
and pass it on,
but I it
was, it was of
concern. And so one of
my, so my question
is what
if anything is
your office
or
perhaps
some other state agency, I'm
not sure whether perhaps we're
forced development,
um, what's
doing to be sure we're
protecting these
workers,
um, from,
um, mistreatment
or lack of appropriate
payment and so forth.
Um, because it's kind
of a unique situation
compared to other
workplaces.
>> Uh, madam chair members of the
committee, uh, Representative
Matthews. I'm not,
I wasn't in that committee meeting. I,
I'm not directly
aware of, of the
situation uh that you're
talking about.
Um But broadly,
I can say that um
there's a couple of
avenues uh
that, that individuals,
if they feel they are in that
position uh can
seek. Uh 1st
1st would be the Department of
Workforce Solutions
uh to
report the, the
company uh
for failure to pay
and they have mechanisms in
place in which to, to do
that also in this
industry. Uh
The majority of these
jobs we are
represented by, by
labor. Uh
So
uh talking to
um whichever
uh whether it be S A or
Ayat or wherever it is
talking to, I, I would
assume s a based on
what you're talking about. Uh
talking to that
representative would also be
another avenue for him.
Uh But for sure, uh
contacting the New
Mexico Film Office would always
be a good way so that they
can, we can help them
get to DWS
a wherever they need to
meet.
>> So
madam chair,
thank you for the
answer. So
there. So the New
Mexico. So your
office is
responsive if
workers make those kinds of
complaints. Is that
what you're saying, >> madam,
chair members of the committee?
Yes, we we
don't, we can't directly
impact it but we can
help them get to
the Department of Workforce
Solutions to the appropriate
unit representative
to help them with their
situation. So yes, we
would, we would definitely serve in
the technical assistance
liaison capacity to help
them. >> Madam
chair, Mr Ober,
have. Are you
aware are those kind
of complaints being made
to the film office?
>> Uh I
madam chair members of the committee
Representative Anthony's
uh not in the short
time frame that I've been in the acting
position. Uh But
I, I do believe that there
have been in the
past uh uh
accusations or
uh of, of such
nature of, of which
to my knowledge have been
resolved. But I,
I don't know that for
sure.
>> Thank you.
And uh
madam chair,
I, I would only say
that I just hope that
we're very sensitive to this
because I think there's a lot
of room and
kind of a lo I
don't, I don't want to call it a lo a
loose industry but
an industry that has different
kinds of work hours and
work situations that we
are um
being sure that we're
protecting our
workers and
at these job sites.
>> Madam madam, chair members of the
committee, I couldn't agree more.
I I mean, um
you know, our
mission,
our
whole thing is
improving the lives of New
Mexicans. So people
not being treated right in the
workplace, regardless of the
industry is, is
behavior. We shouldn't, we,
we, we should do everything we can
to, to stop.
>> Thank you and madam chair. Just a
couple more questions uh
on the creative
industry's division.
My memory when
it appeared before us in
committee during the session
was that we wanted
to be sure that it was not
duplicating with the
film
industry piece
of your agency is
doing. And
um
so my, my question
is, have we
maintained that
division? So the
Creative Industries division
is not simply
an adjunct
or an add-on to the
film industry,
part of what you do.
>> Uh madam chair members of the committee
represented that absolutely. In
fact, uh the
legislature put it in
statute
that uh that it
doesn't enco
uh uh creative
Industries does not include
anything to do with me Meteor
film. Uh So
that, that division has
definitely been
made in its in statute.
>> Um And madam chair,
Mr Roper, just
a couple more questions about
that.
Um
The 1.8
million for the
1800 I
think
however many there were, I figured that it's
about $100,000 grant
per is, are
you going, is there an effort
to grow this
division?
And if
so, have you figured out
sort of the, the, the direction
you might like to grow it.
And if you could share that with us,
I'd appreciate it,
>> madam, chair members of the
committee, Representative Matthews.
Uh Sure, there,
there's absolutely a desire. It's
a brand new division.
It's, it's
two years old. Uh
We are
now uh
three months into actually
having a director, uh,
and a person
uh involved in uh
shortly within
the next two weeks,
we will have uh the coordinator
position filled. So we will
be for the very first
time, a staffed uh a
staffed
division
and part of
the efforts uh
with the original money
was the $200,000
to do the strategic
plan to kind of
give the basis
in the footprint for
uh for the division.
So yes, there'll be
great efforts on not
only reaching out to the
individuals and the communities
uh on how we can grow
the efforts there, but
also in in
the positive and
and correct direction
of the of the division
itself.
>> Great. I look
forward to uh
madam chair, look forward to your
next uh update on
that. And then the very last
thing I want to mention is
when I taught entrepreneurship
at CNM, which
is back several years ago.
And
I was absolutely
amazed at the number of students
who had on their
own, developed
entrepreneurial
ways to be part
of the movie industry, whether
it was makeup artist,
whether it was
um doing the,
the food, the, the
catering for the food.
Um
hair design.
I it was,
there was
just a, I mean,
there was an outgrowth of that
and they, they were in my class
not to figure out what
kind of job they should have, but to
figure out some skills
on how to market and do those kinds
of things. So
um I, I just
think this industry can go,
I mean, we, we have
that entrepreneur,
entrepreneurial spirit
here. Um
And with some support
and so forth, this industry
industry can be
just incredible for us.
Maybe even a peach if
you, if you were a peach
of a,
thank you >> and
thank you for your
support.
>> Uh Representative
Armstrong, >> thank
you madam chair. Thank
you for your presentation.
Um I first want to thank you for
the map of
the Creative Industries
Division. Uh Shout
out to uh Kathryn and
Athena from Magdalena
that really worked hard
to, to try to make that
happen in, in my little
town and um
and promoting it. So
I really appreciate the map.
I wish more entities would
map where some of that grant
money goes. Uh
Just so we can see how it
is spread out equally
as, as equal as possible
across the state. So thank you
for that. Um
The ro I
um there's,
I love the film
industry. Don't get me
wrong, but there's a lot of industries
in the state of New Mexico
that if they had that kind
of uh incentive,
I'd like to see the RO I on
that. So just to shout
out to other industries,
the rural uplift
zone, um it was
actually moved a little
bit and, and
I appreciate that
because everything
outside of
that
zone, um,
I see some names where,
where some uh,
films have been made.
So I appreciate
that. I'm still gonna whine about it
like you said. But,
uh, uh, that's my job
as the, that area's
representative. So
I didn't really have a question, but I
did want to thank you for that for
the, uh, the map especially
um where that money goes
and, and we can, I can actually
see it in my, my little
tiny town of, of how
it's something that's good for
my community. So thank
you madam chair. >> Thank
you. Thank you for that.
And for the record, I
never said wine.
Um
but uh a big shout
out uh specifically
to your people in Magdalena, they did
a great
job,
>> Senator
Tallman.
>> Oh, thank, thank you madam chair
and thank you Mr Roper
for very
interesting and
comprehensive
presentation. Just a quick
comment and a quick question.
Uh This isn't, I
don't mean to criticize
my good friend from Lass,
but she mentioned
something about we
should
uh promote
sites for movies have been
filmed. I have a
interesting situation. I had a
constituent. We had a
house that was
used several times
in the filming of breaking bad
and in one episode, they were throwing
pizzas onto the roof.
Have you heard about this? You,
you know what I'm talking about?
It. Got it got so bad they
had to, to
build a fence around their house.
So people wouldn't
throw pizzas under the
roof. Just interesting
comment. But it
is a good
idea,
but just don't promote
it where
people are throwing pizzas. >> Well, that's
where certain locations
can be eliminated, you know, removed
from that tour.
Um, just out of respect for the private
homeowner. But, and that's what
I was thinking of is like more of
public
locations.
>> So, uh,
question, well, you know,
there's an arms race,
a lot of things, arms race among
colleges to build the most
expensive and exclusive
student unions. And there's an
arm race in your industry
where states try to
outspend each other
and offering in
a financial
incentives to encourage
people and
businesses to locate in their
state. And of course, there's
a arms race on the film
credit. So my
question is, do you foresee,
uh, it seems to have settled
down but you foresee
an increase
in that arms race
again,
>> madam, chair members of the
committee, uh Senator
Tallman. Uh, it's a
good, very good
question. And no, I, I,
at this point, I do not.
Um, and I know, uh,
Senator Maestas brought
up opening up the,
uh, the package, uh, at
this point, I don't
believe that the administration
will be opening up the
film, uh, for
any modifications
uh in this or
uh within this
administration. I, I don't
anticipate any
changes to the, to the
film. Uh bill.
Um As far
as process and
especially as far as uh
the the tax credit,
I think everybody is comfortable
with where it is.
>> Well, thank you for that answer.
And uh that's all I
have madam
chair.
>> Thank you,
Representative
Little.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Thank you. I enjoyed
the presentation on my drive down
this way. So
thank you very much
as you were describing this. I didn't
have the handouts, but
I couldn't help but feel
madam chair, the pride
that a lot of New Mexicans
have when they see
their communities on the
screen, when
they recognize the people
that they have grown up with
and even to
recognize some of the challenges
that have been brought out in
these in, in film.
So um
II I,
it's more of a comment
madam chair, but I just
wanted to
add
um
that I think it's a
great thing. We've talked
about this so much
uh in the last couple of years that I've
been serving about
our Children seeing
themselves and that
the
seeing their lands
and their communities.
Um
It's, it's a very
meaningful uh to
see themselves represented
on screen, to be
acknowledged, to be
seen.
And um
I am looking forward
to the encouragement
that studios like
Liz at Netflix
will give to encourage
uh
um writers
and screenplay,
folks and producers
to continue the work that they're
doing
um to
bring that forward
to give them the opportunity
to actually put
their those
incredibly creative
thoughts onto a big
screen or
in some cases. Uh
so madam
chair. Thank you for that moment.
Um I do want to
recognize that. Thank
you.
>> Well, thank you for your
presentation today. I
am, I don't have anybody else on
the list, but I appreciate you being
here and updating us.
Um I it's, I'm
always excited to
see um locations
that I recognize
and um
I, I think uh
representative little said it
best when you see
um reflections of
our culture um
on the screen. And so
um appreciate the job
that, that you all are doing. So
thank you for your presentation.
>> Thank you madam chair.
Um There's
one, there's actually two more
things that I'd, I, I'd like to
mention because it, it did come
up during Senator
Maestas uh
conversation.
Um
There used to be
as part of
the film Bill,
uh a thing called give
back.
Uh And that
specifically
was uh an amount of
money that any
production and
it was a set amount. I don't recall
what the amount was. It was a
small amount, but
the, and then they paid that
directly to an Institute
of Higher
Education
when the bill was redone.
This most recent
time give back
was taken out.
Um I and
I, I can't speak
as to the whys or the whats, but
it was taken out
and it has
become
a negative
point in a lot of ways
a those institutes of
higher education aren't getting that
anymore. And they, and they feel
it, it wasn't a lot of money but
when they got it, it was
really nice because it didn't have strings
attached to it and they could kinda go
get equipment or get
the things that they couldn't
typically do. Uh,
but the more negative
side that I'm referring to
is it has become
thought that that
money was given to the
media
collective and,
and that is not
true that, that, that
money just was taken out
of circulation. It's not
going anywhere. Uh,
and, and,
uh, I know you're going to hear
that from an institute in
your, uh
area. And I, I just want,
I want everybody to understand that
that's not what, that's not what the
legislature did
and that wasn't the intent at
all. Uh, so
give back, uh, I think
if the bill does open back up,
it's something that the legislature
should look at. Um,
but, uh, it,
it was not
taken away and given someplace
else, it was just eliminated
as part of the tax
program. Uh,
so thank you for
letting me have the,
have the time on that
and, and talk about that. Thank
you very much. Enjoy your
tour.
>> Thank you. Um, before
we go on the tour, we're, we've got
some housekeeping to finish up.
So, um, we're gonna,
we're gonna move through that.
Um,
we need to do,
um, public
comments.
No,
nobody.
And nobody online.
Ok. Well,
public comment is now
over with.
So um
before um
we, we go on there, I do
want to thank Bianca uh
Gutierrez and the Grocery
Association for pre
breakfast today. Of
course, uh Dan and Jar for
setting up our tour.
Um I also wanna again
thank uh CNM
for the two
days of hospitality
and those um
that provided lunch and dinner
for us. Why, why we
have been touring and
uh and visiting
this area? So thank you
for that. And
um so
we are going to our
next
month
will be our last meeting
and it's November 13th
and 14th. Uh I
just wanted to make sure that
we, we remind not only
our members but anybody else
who is wanting uh
legislation to be
considered for endorsement
that that is the time um
that we need to, to hear
those bills.
Um And so you
would need to reach out to
Martin or Shana
to get them on the agenda
to be heard. So,
um again, the next
meeting is November 13th
and 14th.
And so to make sure you're
on there um
for
consideration, uh
we need to,
to get that probably that
information within the next
two weeks.
So um
please let us know
and with that, I don't think we have
anything. Oh,
yes. And of course our
staff who uh we
appreciate um I
know it's hard to set up, especially
in another location on the last
day. Um I
appreciate you being here
um And all the support that you
give us and we
could not do this without you to
be able to travel to
different locations. So,
thank you. Um
They're, they're be behind
the scenes but always
working very hard on our behalf.
So thank you for that.
And with that, I'm gonna adjourn
so we can get going on our
tour. So
we are adjourned.
