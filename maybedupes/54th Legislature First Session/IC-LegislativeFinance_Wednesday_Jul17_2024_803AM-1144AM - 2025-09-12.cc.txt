I did notice one of the new
staffers had a
briefcase.
Did you notice that I, I can't
remember his name.
One of the new LFC staffers
has a
briefcase
I hadn't seen in a
while
ready when you are.
>> Great. Good morning,
Mr. Chair. Good morning
Members. Um
My name is Ismael Torres.
I'm the chief economist for you
all at the legislative finance
Committee and I'm gonna
start on Tab K
this
morning.
Give you all a second to turn over. It's
a brief with the title money
matters at the top
and it's on State revenue
volatility and fiscal
stability.
And
I always find it helpful to start with a little
bit of context.
And these volatility
revenue volatility
studies are a recommended
best practice from
national organizations,
national fiscal agencies like
Pew, the Volcker Alliance and
others. And they
recommend this
regular and recurring
study of a
state's revenues
for volatility in order
to help support
uh best fiscal prac
best practices fis for
fiscal management in order to
help states manage
their, their fiscal volatility.
Because if you're not looking at it, if you're not
paying attention to it, if you're not studying
it, of course, you won't know what's going
on. And we did
our first iteration of this
report five years ago, my
predecessor Don Iglesias,
um did the first study
and what she found at that time
was that the State had the most
volatility in
decades.
And following that
report, the legislature
made a series of
interventions, what I call stabilizing
measures that I'll get
into here shortly. Um
But even still in the
five years since that report,
the State has only gotten more
volatile. So
what I found and what I'll be going
through in this report is that actually in
the last five years,
the State has had the most
volatile revenues
in the State in the LF C's
history over the last 70
years. And the only
time that came close
to that level of volatility was the five
years before it. So
you all are under an incredible
challenge, especially
over the last 10 years to manage
this level of volatility through both
budgeting and also revenue
management. And
uh uh the challenge that that
face is not, is not only a
challenge that you all face, it's
a challenge that your economists as
revenue estimators um
think about it's,
it's what keeps us up at night because it
makes it really challenging for us to do our
job and tell you all how much money you
have. But of course, it
affects New Mexicans because
the critical services that they rely
on are subject to
this volatility and that means
that their services could
be pulled back at any time
given this volatility. And
it also makes it challenging to
improve services when
you're constantly having to tread
water and stay ahead of the game
when revenues keep going up and
down.
So I'll start on page
one. If you take a look at the chart
at the bottom of the page here,
this is the general fund
revenue change every single year.
This, this chart only goes
back to 84.
But you can see something remarkable
for about 20 years starting in
the eighties, there was consistent
revenue growth.
Now, when we're talking about
volatility here, we're talking about
peak to valley. That's sort
of what I'm looking at when
I'm looking at this chart and you can see
over that 20 year period,
we had pretty much
above above zero
revenue growth, which is remarkable
consistency, maybe a
peak to valley there
of 10% at
the at the most. And
then starting with that.com
bust in the early two thousands
at the turn of the millennia. You
can see that the volatility peak
to trough grows pretty
consistently. We have a
spike following that small
recession right into
the great recession, which had
large revenue
decreases. And
then we had somewhat
muted revenue growth
coming out of the great recession.
And then of course, the oil
bust in um
15 to 17, you can
see that large revenue decline again,
there the subsequent
boom in oil production
in Southeast New Mexico,
the pandemic declines
again in revenue and
so on. You all are very familiar with
this story, but you can tell that
those 5%
variations have suddenly become
1520
25%
variation. So in any given
year, your revenues could
skyrocket by
25% or decline
by 25%. And we've seen that
over the last
decade.
And so what we do in this study
is we, we do uh what,
what Pew calls a volatility
score. And that is we
take a standard deviation
of all the percent changes
over a period of time
which really in in
in layman's terms mean,
what is the expected
deviation from the average
growth? So if you see a
volatility score of say
10, that means that we
can expect that revenue can
jump or drop by
10% in any
given year. So 10%
would be in my
uh uh you know,
estimation quite
a volatile revenue source. And
as you, you'll see in the table
at the top of page one
here, our total
volatility
over the last five years has grown
from 8.4 to
11.9.
So over that five year
period, the total general fund
can expect to jump or decline
by almost 12%
every single year, which is a considerable
amount of, of revenue
change. What you'll
also see is the Pew
rankings here
for State
volatility
and five years ago, we
were the fifth
most volatile State in the
country.
Over that time, you all
have have made some stabilizing
measures that have supported
the State have, have diminished
the amount of volatility that we otherwise
would have had. And
because the rest of the country was
also undergoing a lot of
volatility with the pandemic and
federal stimulus packages,
um The State actually
improved its volatility
ranking by one. So now we are the
sixth most volatile State
in the country
and almost not
quite two times as volatile
as the average country or
as the average State in the country.
So as I go through this
presentation, I'll be referring a lot to
these volatility scores and
just keeping in mind that that
reflects the amount of percent
change that that revenue can
go under in a given
year. So if you
turn to page two,
I'll highlight some of the stabilizing
actions that you all have taken in recent
years. And again,
following that study in
2019,
the legislature tackled some of
this volatility by creating
distributions of windfall oil
and gas revenues to the early
childhood trust fund
and the rainy day fund.
That's the uh uh Larry
Laran AA um tax
stabilization reserve.
So, following
those two interventions
in 2019,
um our study
estimates that the
the stabilizing measures
have actually reduced our revenue
volatility by 37%.
A pretty remarkable number over
those five years. And despite
that we're still extremely
volatile. So it just goes to show
how much more volatile we could have
been without those
and without those interventions,
um we're estimating that we would
actually be the third most volatile in
the country behind Alaska and North
Dakota. But as, as you
saw on the previous page, we're
still at
sixth.
Um If you take a look at the chart at
the top of the page here,
here's what these
revenues over the last five
years look like
currently in blue, the
volatility score there. So the general
fund again, you saw that close to
10% and
then direct energy
since these are related to oil and gas
revenues, how volatile are
they? Now? About 30%.
That's a significant amount of volatility,
but they could have been more than
double that amount if
these stabilizing measures had
not been put into
place.
Now, this because
this study only goes through
fy 24 we
weren't able to estimate
or, or we weren't able to see the
benefits of some of the other stabilizing
measures that you all have put into
place, namely the
caps on certain oil and gas
revenues in the general fund and the
distributions of those revenues
to the permanent funds
that will still take some time to
come into effect. Fy
25 is the first year of
those stabilizing measures.
But we estimate
that that specific
measure will reduce volatility
by 55%
in the coming five years. So that's
also something that we
expect will have a large
part positive outcome in
terms of our revenue
stability.
So I wish it was all good news, but
it's not. Um the
other changes that the legislature
has enacted in recent years
have also eroded
stability to some
extent, specifically
reductions in stable sources
of revenue, personal income
tax and Gross receipts tax
to the tune of about $1 billion
on a recurring basis
has shifted the
state's revenue and
budget reliance on to more
volatile revenue streams.
If you look at the second chart
on the page here, you can
see our major
sources of tax revenue
ranked by volatility
against the US
average.
As you see our sales tax
or the Gross receipts tax and the personal
income tax are among the most
stable, around
10% revenue
volatility there,
corporate income tax is
at 80. So
in any given year, we can almost
expect all of the corporate income
tax to double or go
away in any given
year.
And uh nationally
corporate income taxes, if
you are a State with a corporate income tax
tend to be the most volatile
sources of revenue in
a State. And
yet new Mexico's corporate
income tax is
almost triple the national
average. And that's in large
part because our industry
makeup of corporations
is oil and
gas is highly tied to oil and
gas. And of course, that
those revenue sources, those
corporate income taxes are
highly volatile with that
industry.
Um As you can see though the
direct energy
revenues have
are are more stable than the rest of the
country. And that's because of those stabilizing
measures that you all put into place, as
I mentioned. So
as a
a as
a matter of revenue volatility,
when the legislature considers
making tax changes,
if you
make changes, reductions
in the more stable sources of revenue,
of course, by necessity, that
means the more volatile
revenues um become
all the more important in the general
fund and it's not
just personal and, and uh
sales taxes,
others stable sources
of income have been earmarked out of
the general fund. This also contributes
to revenue volatility
sources like the uh health
insurance premium tax. That's a very
stable source, the motor vehicle
excess tax, those are taxes
in recent years that have been
taken out of the general fund which
has contributed to revenue
volatility. These
reductions uh are
estimated to have increased our volatility
by 5%. So not
nearly as much
introduction of volatility as
reduction in volatility that in
the actions that you all have taken over the
last five years on
net still a positive
uh uh gain in
instability.
But uh an important
to note unfortunate side
effect of some of these earmarks and
cuts
moving on to some of the
emerging issues that we see in this
study. If you look at the chart
at the bottom of this page,
these are the revenue
volatility scores over
time for
major
sources of revenue in the
general fund,
you'll notice corporate income
tax in the red there.
It's a large source of
volatility.
You can see direct energy
revenues in green slowly
coming down as those stabilizing
measures take effect
Gross receipts and personal
income tax both towards
the bottom of the list.
But
something that is not a source
of tax revenue, but actually
a source of investment revenue
from the money
managed by the State treasurer's office
is highlighted there in yellow as
ST and this is on the
right axes. We've
seen almost
1000% in the
last five years. So
extreme volatility in this
revenue source.
And if you turn to page
three, you can see
these revenues, both corporate income
tax and, and the
earnings from the State
treasurer's office charted
in dollars here.
And you can see that level of
volatility, especially
on the State treasurer's
earnings as it can be negative
any in any given year, it could be a
drag on the general fund
to extremely positive
in the next year. And that
goes to show that reflects
that 1000%
volatility score on the previous
page. And I
think it would be helpful to provide a little more
context on what we're talking about
here. The State treasurer's
office manages
liquid funds for the
State. The
primary
mission I would say of
the State treasurer's office is to
manage the general fund. So
as these revenues come in from tax
sources and the
appropriations go out to
agencies, that sort of
quick moving
money is managed by the State
treasurer's office and they
invest this pool,
what which is called the State General Fund
investment pool in is
what in is what
very liquid assets
so that this is overnight
repurchase agreements.
Three month treasury bills
up to two year
treasury bonds.
So what
can happen
is as
these investments
are affected by the change in
interest rates. So if interest
rates skyrocket, for example,
the valuation of the
State treasurer's office
holdings will decrease
rather quickly. And that's how you can
see this negative
in fy 21
as interest rates started
to ratchet up quite quickly.
The other component here
is the amount of
assets under management
has doubled in the last four
years. The State treasurer's
office, as I
mentioned, manages the general
fund but also invests
bond proceeds pools. So
unspent capital appropriations are
also in this pool. And as
we know, as you all know,
those funds have grown tremendously
over the last several years and that has
contributed to ballooning balances
which then have higher
earnings or losses
and all of those earnings and
losses are attributed to the
general fund.
And as your economist,
of course, this keeps us up at
night because
when I'm thinking about the
potential earnings from the general fund
or potential collections
from the corporate income tax, for
example, that represents
about 7% of the
total general fund revenues.
And as you'll remember
or, or hopefully remember from
December,
the consensus revenue estimating
group is expecting
revenue growth of about 3%
in the coming years. So
if about 7%
of the general fund revenues
could swing up and down and
even go negative in a given year,
we're certainly worrying about telling
you about 3% growth
when very
quickly and, and without a
lot of notice, we can see that go
negative. So this
is something that we watch very
closely and, and I'll have
some uh um
more discussion about tools to
manage that level of volatility
shortly.
Of course, some evergreen
sources of volatility,
oil and gas production in
Southeast New Mexico drives a
large portion of our Gross receipts
tax, maybe about a
quarter. So a
quarter of our Gross receipts
tax represents
um maybe
10% of revenues.
Those are extremely volatile as
well. And the same goes for
personal income tax. We have
the oil and gas
proceeds withholding
tax. So this is similar
to your wage, withholding it
comes out of your paycheck. It's similar
proceeds from production
on oil and gas well, is withheld
for income tax
purposes. And
we are now seeing that share of
the personal income tax grow
to a similar share as the Gross
receipts tax, maybe about a quarter
or more of the personal
income tax. Now coming from oil and
gas proceeds. So the
personal income tax, which used to
be our most stable source of revenue
of tax revenue I should
clarify is now becoming
just as volatile as the Gross receipts
tax.
So these are all the things in our
mind and I I should actually plug
here one
that occurred to
me this morning that I did not
list uh
reversions
when you all make
appropriations to State agencies, the
money that's not spent is reverted
back into the general fund and it is
considered at this time a
recurring source of revenue.
And that is because we expect
some amount of reversions every
single year, but the
amount of the reversions has
grown extremely volatile in
recent years as
agencies need to
catch up with the spending
or with the appropriation growth that
they've experienced. So we're
also experiencing a large amount of
volatility in
reversions from
agencies.
OK. Now I'll mov'e
on to some of the tools available
to you all. Some that you're very
familiar with that you've already
used um in
managing revenue
volatility and a lot of
these are best practices as recommended
by Pew and the Volcker
lines. You can see
that the first tool here is
permanent funds. The chart at the
bottom of the page, the
gray line represents
the contributions to the
permanent funds over these
years. And you can see
that if we had
uh allowed
for all of these revenues to
reach the general fund, there would
be a significant amount of more
volatility, especially in the most
recent year. The general
fund could have experienced $1.5
billion in losses, had those
revenues not been going to the permanent
funds. And instead
the dark Maroon line here
represents the um
distributions from those
permanent funds to the general fund.
And instead of declining by
1.5 billion, they actually grew
by 500 million. So,
uh a very
useful tool for stabilizing
revenues. There convert
a lot of these one time spikes in
oil and gas into
recurring sources of general
fund revenue through the power of compound
interest.
If you turn to page
four,
this is a common tool employed
by states to
identify
revenues as one
time and make sure they're used
for one time
appropriations. Now,
there are many ways to do this. You
can see the way that the
grow fund works at the
top of the page here.
If revenues in
aggregate um
exceed appropriations,
they'll spill over into our checking
account. That's the general fund operating
reserve. If that checking
account fills up past
8% of spending,
all of the excess will now go
into the grow fund.
This has been a proven strategy
for the State. It used to
fill up the tax stabilization
reserve and that's helped to
mitigate the declines
in oil and gas. Uh the
decline in the pandemic and
then it filled up
the tax stabilization reserve, the rainy
day fund, which was then used to
backfill um
budgets when revenues
declined. And so
that is continued to use
continue to be used in the Grow
Fund. The tax
stabilization reserve is still gonna get
funds through excess oil and
gas revenues.
So we take a five year trend
in oil and gas revenues.
Anything above that amount goes
into the tax stabilization
reserve until reserves
are at 25%.
And then it continues on to the
early childhood trust fund.
So those are
strategies that can still
be employed on some of these other
volatile sources of revenue.
How do we identify one
time bumps
in revenue, say through
the market, through earnings
on the State treasurer's office
or through reversions
or through corporate income tax
revenues? Um These are
all tools that could be applied to
those if
you turn to
page
five.
I also want to highlight
um maybe a bigger
picture way of ma managing
volatility, maybe not on the revenue
level, but sort of the aggregate
general fund picture.
And that's really by
limiting our recurring
spending below
our recurring revenue. So it
sounds kind of common sense, but
states have a tendency to
match their recurring
revenues with recurring spending
over time. Of course, we have
had extreme revenue growth
over the last several years and we're
still catching up to that recurring
revenue. But as
we do catch up to that recurring
revenue, it's important
to note as a best practice.
It's important to keep a gap,
a cushion between recurring
revenue and recurring spending.
The idea here being that
if revenues,
volatile revenues
collapse in any given year,
there's very little notice, it
often happens very
quickly and
strategic budget
making it gets much
harder to do in an emergency.
It gets much harder to do
when you are facing
a AAA tight turnaround,
a special Session. Um
It's much better to leave that
kind of cushion, maybe
use that cushion for
nonrecurring appropriations
and allow for drawing from
the reserves if volatile
revenues
in the recurring revenue category
fall.
And your
economist in the consensus revenue
estimating group put together a stress
test every
estimate. And you can see that stress
test on the right of this page
here. And
what the
legislature could do is
maintain a cushion
between recurring revenues and
recurring expenditures equal
to the stress
test in the current
fiscal year only. So in this
last estimate, it would mean a
cushion of at least
$281 million
between recurring revenue and
recurring expenditures.
And then the reserves would
be counted on to get you
through the next two years.
So in this example,
reserves would need it to, would
need to be about
$2.5 billion
to get through the period.
As long as the
recurring appropriations and
recurring revenues left a cushion of
about $300
million.
And
this would just allow the
legislature to
spend the interim
strategizing thinking
about budget planning
for how to address a revenue
shortfall rather than
having to come in quickly and,
and reduce budgets um
with short notice.
And of course, um
another evergreen
strategy here is maintaining
enough reserves to get you through
a stress test which I just
went over
and Mr. Chair,
if you'll turn to
page six here,
I'll close with
some final thoughts on
revenue volatility.
This is the history of
recurring revenue growth
and appropriations
growth through the
LFC history about
70 years here.
And again, I
think what really stood out to
me was through
the history of the LFC. We've seen
six instances
of recurring appropriation
um cuts
and five of those have been in
the last 20 years. So over
the history of the LFC, six
times recurring revenue, recurring
appropriations have been cut,
five have been in the last 20 years
and three of those have been in the last
eight years. So you
all are under tremendous
challenge in managing
this volatility and budgeting for this
volatility.
And there's definitely still
work to be done and and
we have plenty of
suggestions for you all
um in how to continue to improve
that so that hopefully
you all's job can be easier
and we can stabilize
this source of revenue.
If you turn to page seven,
I'll just close with
these appendices
that show our rankings how
volatile New Mexico is compared with
other states.
There's a a listing
here that shows
numerically
how much improvement we would need
to get to the national average
and then a map on page
eight
and with that
Mr. Chair or madam Chair,
I'm happy to take
questions.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much
Izzie. Do we have any questions
from the Committee? Uh We've
got, thank you. We've got
Representative Gail
Chasey and I don't know if I have a list
Senator Munoz that just tipped out.
So let me look at the list before I
want to be fair with
everyone.
>> Thank, thank you madam
Chair.
Um
uh Thank you for the
report. Um Interesting
enough, I I was curious,
what percentage do
we assume
will be reverted every
year? And, and,
and
yeah, does that, what is
the average percentage that we
assume will be reverted every
year? >> Madam
Chair and Representative
Armstrong, we
estimate about 1%
and not quite 1%.
Um We've seen
in two, I believe,
not this last fiscal year, but the year
before we hit 3%.
So it tripled
and uh we're
not yet at the end of, to
see at the end of this last
fiscal year fy 24.
Um So
any anywhere from 1 to
3% is what we've been seeing
lately. >> Thank
you. Um, so much
for that madam
Chair. I wonder if we
um
so every, every year that
the that the budget
grows,
that 1%
grows
and why would we
count that in our
reserves,
>> madam Chair and Representative
Armstrong, it,
it's actually
counted in recurring revenues
which, which might be even
more serious
because um because
of the volatility mentioned
and and those
reversions are then budgeted for
future recurring spending. And
so it, it's certainly
challenging as economists
to predict that source of
revenue. Um
and especially in
these runups of, of budget
growth,
it would appear to us that
those revenues May be one time
in nature.
>> Ok. Thank you madam Chair. And so
we don't count them
and in our as part
of our, of our reserves, we
count it in the
uh part of our recurring.
Ok, I misunderstood
you. I thought we were counting
that as part of our reserves and I
didn't really think that
was correct. So. Ok,
thank you madam
Chair. >> Thank
you very much. And Senator Gonzalez,
my apologies. I think
you were first on the list, but I
didn't have a list here and
just got it. Thank you for your
patience.
>> Thank you madam Chair. No,
that's fine. And
uh thank you, you know, for
the report. Um
I think one of the parts
that, um, that I was gonna
ask you is um
on page
five
um in
showing the, the
stress
test,
um,
what is the,
I guess the pluses and the
minus that
this couldn't be like a five
year instead
of a one
year.
>> Thank you madam Chair and Senator
Gonzalez. This
is, this is a three year.
So we're thinking
about declines in
revenue that could last over the course
of the of 2.5 years.
Really.
Um our
constraint, our current
constraint in doing these stress
tests is also the
availability of the
forecast data.
So when we
conduct these stress tests,
we contract with
Moody's or Bieber
um both S and
P
to
estimate how much
sort of volatility there could be in
the economy or oil
prices, for example.
And sometimes
those estimates
only go out three years.
So that's a limitation. But if
five years is of interest to
you, we can certainly
try to work on
that.
>> I, I think one of the,
uh, madam Chair and
he, I
think one of the hardest part
for us
and, uh, we
sit here as a, as a
Committee, but
then outside from us,
even including our, our own
peers is
so all we see is
that there's money,
you know, and why can we fund
this or why can't we go with
this or hire?
And I always feel
like the real
base, the foundation is
understanding what you're
doing to the base with a
recurring and
every time you add to the
recurring, you're
increasing that load
and, uh,
maybe, uh,
coming up with something that
would be, uh, that
could be distributed or even
to the media, you
know, showing New Mexico as
far as, yes, we
do have extra
funding that has
been coming in from oil and
gas. But look at what we've
done in the last five years in adding
to the base.
And, uh, just
that perception, you know,
just I, I get
hit from all my constituents.
They just see we have money,
you know, and police
submit a request for this and
this, especially when
it comes to capital outlay.
But, um, I think it would,
it would help,
you know, with, and, and that's one
of the things that I struggled
when I was superintendent
is they will only
see the year that you're giving them
the raise. They would say, well,
we're just getting three. And I said, yeah,
but look at what we've done in the last three
or four years, you had
all of that and it's more
like 12 14%
of what we have done.
And because that's already,
you're gonna get that
automatically,
you know, unless you were to make
cuts and
just a thought.
And thank you for the report.
Thank you very much. Thank you, madam
Chair. Thank you.
>> Thank you, >> Senator Woods. You're
next.
Thank you madam
Chair.
I'm gonna show you how much I
don't know madam Chair
real quickly
here
when the State agency's
budget is
set.
How is that money pushed
to that agency? Is it pushed
through quarterly
monthly?
So, so, and the
reason for that is so
that
the State treasure
can invest that
money.
That's
the State treasurer has the
money until it's pushed
to the agency.
And he makes
investments on that
money
until the agency received
it. Is, is that
right or is that wrong?
>> Um, madam Chair and
Senator, the
State treasurer's office invests it
until it's spent actually.
So even even when it's attributed
to an agency, it still May
be invested until
those funds are spent.
>> So it's, it's a
reimbursement
agency is
reimbursed
for what they
spend.
>> Madam Chair and Senator.
It's, it's a drawdown. It,
it's pulled from the account
when the money is being
spent.
>> An agency issues
warrants to
the State
treasury
>> that they will request
to draw down through DDA who
then creates
the trans the transfer
from the funds to
that expenditure. >> I
guess the
question I'm asking,
it's a State treasure
that invest
the, the
appropriated
budget,
that it's a
State treasure. And then
the other funds are invested
by
other people.
The, the, the,
the other
reserves so to speak,
were invested by
someone else.
>> Madam Chair and Senator
Woods, the State
treasurer's office actually
invests all
of our reserves because
those reserves need to remain
liquid in the event of
a quick revenue downturn.
The State Investment
Council invests on
a longer term basis. So anything
really beyond two
years
and that's not in bonds
is invested by the State
Investment Council.
Um, but
reserves, um,
bond proceeds,
the general fund appropriations
and revenues as they come in and out the
door. Those are all under the State
treasurer's office in >> the
State.
Don't mean to cut you
off madam
Chair.
So the State
Treasure's office
has a council that
helps him do that or
does he just hire,
uh, an
investment group to help
him do that
>> madam Chair. And Senator
Woods, the
um, State treasurer,
she has a State
Treasury Investment Committee
that includes the Board of
Finance and, and other
folks that sit on that board
that the treasurer reports
to and, and they vote
on contracts for
sort of bank services
and other, um,
you know, investment services that the
State treasurer's office uses.
Uh, so, so
both the State treasurer is
making these decisions on, on
who to contract with, but there is an
oversight component as
well. >> Ok. And the
State Investment Council
is investing the
permanent
funds,
>> madam Chair, Senator Woods.
Yes, and also other
endowment funds Early Childhood
Higher Ed, um
Conservation
Legacy or, or maybe the land
of enchantment, I I get those
confused. So
any funds that are sort of
water trust fund, any funds
that are intended to be
long term in,
in investment?
>> Ok. Well, thank you
for explaining the the
mechanics of the deal.
Uh I was thinking
it was quarterly
but it's monthly. So
that, that makes sense.
Thank you, madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator. >> All right,
>> Representative Dixon, you are
next.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Thank you Izzy for
the presentation.
Um
I would
like to talk a
little bit more about the
stress test.
Um
Just to make sure that I
sort of, I following
how we
um
get to these numbers.
So
when uh on
page
five
for the stress test,
so the upside
scenario
is assuming sort
of, you know, rosy
future. Um
What is the
downside scenario?
Can you just walk through that a little
bit. And yeah,
absolutely >> madam
Chair and Representative Dixon.
There are two downside scenarios
presented here. They are
not summed.
So the the worst
case is just the worst case
alone. The
light sort of pink
there represents a
moderate recession. So
nothing at the level of a 2008
recession. Um
much closer to maybe like
a.com boom
or bust, I should
say. And then the
dark red represents
a oil price
crash. So this
oil price crash is in the
upper thirties, lower forties
and the subsequent decline in
production that would follow
if this scenario plays out, of
course, in this scenario, there's also a
ramp back up in prices in
the later years. Um
But if you were to
say, face a moderate recession
and a price
collapse, you'd have to add those two
together to get the the
total potential
loss.
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Um and Izzie and so
for the low
oil price
scenario, um you
said upper
thirties, lower forties
for the barrel,
the price >> per barrel. That's right,
Mr. Chair.
>> Uh madam Chair is he
I have
do oil and gas
companies, you know,
are they still
operating solely
on price per
barrel when they're making their
decisions or has that changed
in the last couple of years?
And, and do our numbers
reflect that >> Mr.
Chair and Representative Dixon? That's an
excellent question.
I think you're hitting on
something recent,
this sort of change
in in investment decision
making by a lot of these
companies, which
is a, a fixed capital
investment plan, capital
investment being required
to uh draw
oil out of the ground
to create production.
And as
long as these
wells are profitable
to drill, we
expect consistent
drilling. That
being said, this is
sort of the price point,
what we call uh a
break even point
where
if you were to drill a well,
it would cost you more money than the
resulting profit. And so this is
sort of the pain point where oil
companies, regardless of
their capital discipline
would start to throttle
back production until prices came
back up.
>> Thank you,
madam Chair
and Izzy. And so
to get to that low
price
for be, you know, to sort of reach
that breakeven point, we would
be looking at OPEC
you know, opening the
floodgates or, you
know, some really
significant change
is that
>> Mr. Chair, it could
mean um Russian oil
coming fully back onto the marketplace.
It could be OPEC um
increasing production.
It, it could be a
number of, it could be
much
more
quickly um
deploying renewable energy
sources that one it
would be much more unlikely,
another pandemic
things that really curtail demand
in addition to increasing
supply.
>> Thank you. Thank you, madam
Chair. Um
When the
um consensus
group um
is doing the stress
test and considering
um appropriate levels of
reserves, um
can you remind me, do they do a
range
right now, >> Mr. Chair
and Representative Dixon,
um the range presented
are those potential
scenarios
but uh
something that
has been um on
the top of my mind is we
haven't as a consensus revenue estimating
group connected those necessarily
to expenditures.
Um And so I think
part of the point I was making
earlier with the cushion between
recurring revenues and recurring
expenditures
would be that we need to take a
closer look at that. And,
and I think it would
merit some more analysis
from your economists
if that's the choice, if
that's the path that you all would like us to
take.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Thank you,
Izzie. Could you
restate that for
me? >> Yes, absolutely.
I'll try to be a little less
confusing.
The consensus
revenue estimating group puts
together this stress test
with different scenarios,
different outcomes
and in the past or, or
recently, currently, we
give the those scenarios to
you all to make a decision on
how much reserves you might
think to be necessary.
What we don't do is tie
those scenarios to
the to the budget
to give
better perhaps
guidance or recommendation on
how much reserves should be. That's
sort of a missing step
in the process.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Thank
you Azie. That was
perfect. Um
Because one of the things that I always
wonder about as we're
discussing, you know, an
appropriate level of reserves is
opportunity cost. Is
there a way that we measure
opportunity
cost,
>> Mr. Chair? We don't.
Currently, we, we
could, we, we certainly
could by taking some
expected return on
investment, either economic or
fiscal um
on the money not spent, we
could attempt that kind
of analysis.
>> Thank you, madam Chair
and Izzy. Um and
if you know, we
could um as a Committee
make some uh requests
of our economists to
dig a little bit more into that. I
think it would be really valuable
um as we mov'e forward
um with some of these
conversations. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Yes, very
good. Um representative
and thank you, Izzie, we're gonna
mov'e on to Representative
Pettigrew. Thanks for your
patience and of course, our
Chair, Senator
Munoz,
>> thank you madam Chair and thank
you for the
presentation.
Um
I like numbers and I like digging
into the weeds. I appreciate
all the data you gave.
The Majority of my questions will come
to you guys later. But
um
one primary one
madam Chair is
with reversions
and you know, I think
we discussed it.
They've been at the highest 3%
over the last couple of years,
right? So
it's about 315
million.
That money goes back into the
general fund,
correct?
So, how is that
allocated then
afterwards? Or does just
carry into the
general fund's potential for
the following for the next
year, >> madam Chair
represented the
latter. It, it carries
into
the total pot of money
that is then appropriated in the following
year.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank you
Izzie for that.
So
what has
the State legislative body
ever looked at
saying
Ok, we've
got 18 department secretaries,
they revert a total of
315 million.
That money doesn't go
into the general
fund anymore.
That was money that we had for that
year,
put it into an
investment fund of some
sort, say a transportation
fund, say
something that we can start
building on to
create that
State departments, uh,
for a multitude of
reasons are ineffective
with respect
to
spending the money that they've
asked for getting the
full-time employees that
they need uh really
effective at, at requesting
bar adjustments and stuff like
that, which I think we'll talk about again
today. But
when we look at that, why can't
we look
at or do you think
as an economist
from your looking at it from your
perspective, does it make sense to
say? OK, we had a
chance to spend that this year. We
didn't, let's invest
it and let's invest in
something that needs it. But from,
from my standpoint,
you know, we've been pushing for
State Transportation
Fund for, for
several years just
because
of, I mean, we
walked into,
we walked into the 30 day
Session with a big goose egg
on, on
uh spending money for new
road construction reconstruction
this year. And,
and so we got a good
number at the end of it,
but for
years that, that we
May not have that flexibility
because of the
volatility,
but it not make sense to make it
make revert
that to an investment
>> madam Chair and Representative
Petigru. I think that would
be a great idea that
sort of follows this
um best practice that you
all have already employed
and is recommended to
identify one time bumps.
So to Representative
Armstrong's Point, you
could say
in statute that
1% ceiling
on reversions in the general fund, we
know that they're that there will be
some amount of reversions every
year, but anything above
1% might be one time in
nature. And all of
that goes to a fund of your,
of your alls choosing
the, the road fund could
be a great example of
that. Um I think the
tool could also be used
successfully with the
State treasurer's earnings.
You know, you could set
aside all of the market
volatility and
attribute it to the grow fund, for
example, to help
take it out of the general fund,
but still allow it available
for appropriation by you
all. Um,
and I think,
I think these are, are
proven tools that
could, could
and, and, um, would be very
helpful to apply to
both reversions and
State treasurer's office earnings,
maybe even corporate income taxes as
well.
>> Thank you madam Chair and thank
you Izzy for that. So
my last question
when, uh, your discussion
with Representative Dixon
about the
volatility and the,
and corporate decisions made
with respect to oil and gas,
I think that we
at least you and I can agree
that that price point
is price per barrel
is one minute
factor on whether or
not
uh an investment
is made to continue to
drill in
the, in, in New
Mexico. There are
so many other factors that deal
with that. I mean, I
can,
I can permit and drill a
well
500 ft away from
the, from the New Mexico
Line and have it
done and, and
have six wells on a 40
acre site.
Um By the time
I even get my permit
for in on the Texas
side, by the time I even
get my permit on the New Mexico
side. So there's
decisions like that as
well. And we look
at, we look
at uh
um air qualities
and stuff like that, but
none of the studies that we
do, um,
actually take in
the east to west
airflow
with what we have.
We just claim it all as our
own and we make our, our rules
different because of that
when we all know
that the Majority of it is not
our own because we
have such
good policies with
respect to what we do
and stuff like that. So
as we look at
that volatility,
um
and
where we say, I, I
just want to make it clear
to,
to our Committee that
in the years where we're in
a downturn with respect
to the amount of
production
uh or new wells
that we're actually processing.
Um
oil and gas industry over the
last 30 years
has gotten really good at using those
years for, for
uh infrastructure growth.
So our personal income
tax, our corporate income
tax, so many
other pieces haven't become
quite as volatile
because it's
converted differently.
We May not have as much to the
State uh
to some of our
funds because
we're not, we're not creating
new wells, we're not increasing
barrels per day,
but it's not really impacting
as much on the,
on the tax side. Would you agree
with that >> madam
Chair and representative?
Absolutely. Our,
our taxes currently are
a little more, our personal income
tax and grocer seats
tax are a little more stable
because of that sort of
dynamic that you're describing,
um, corporate income
taxes are, are a little bit different.
We have seen that a different
trend on corporate income
taxes. >> Thank
you very much for the presentation.
Thank you very much for the time.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much,
Senator Mr. Chairman.
You
>> thank you.
Um You
know, I think we're at
the tipping point right now, right,
because we have 2.6
billion in, in credits going
out roughly,
right. And that
was our regular income
coming in
and now
we're flattening out
and we're seeing this direction. I
mean, you're looking at maybe
a 3% increase
in budgets overall, kind of
tracking
your number, right. So that
tells us how much volatility is
out there. But the interesting
thing to me is the Federal
Reserve in Hobbs.
And I think, I don't know if you heard this
or seen that presentation
that they came out and said that the
Permian Basin is a
driver in the US oil
economy and will remain
that way. Right.
Well, depending what market price
is, right. And,
and if they pull back
and then you're seeing the largest
oil and gas companies, right?
Acquire other companies
at record numbers, right.
So they're in for the long
haul,
they know that the production is
there. They just can't get it out quick
enough at the, at the rate the
market's at right now.
And so New
Mexico is, as we've
given roughly
2.6 billion
away in numerous
things from low income tax
credits to film,
to, to
retiree health care
that takes a draw on everything
else. New Mexico's
reoccurring number is
getting dangerously
low
and the reliance is
increasingly
high.
So if anything changes
in those two scenarios,
right,
if we don't raise
taxes,
then our dependence on oil gets
greater and greater every single
year.
And if
we keep giving
away
tax credits at a
cost and we
don't have the reoccurring
the stable reoccurring
money to do that. Right.
And that's taxes,
then we're the perfect
scenario of X and Y,
right. If
we had a recession, if we had
a big downturn or even
the short one,
we'll be all right with reserves.
But the reserves are just a
number so that
we don't go back to
Session
in the big picture of it.
Right. The government can
still operate in this reserve
level. The Governor
doesn't have to call the legislature
in to make
changes. And
so you can, you can handle that
and maybe, maybe a
year's worth of budgeting that we
have in there to, to string
that out.
II, I don't know how we're
gonna handle
this, but I mean, you talked about
agencies that are
having trouble
handling money
and reversions are
now counted as reoccurring
money go into that just a little bit.
So Xyz
Agency had 100 million
appropriated.
Their reversion was
$10 million. So
that goes back into the
reoccurring number to increase
the or to
>> madam Chair and Senator
Munoz, the
amount in the previous
year
will sit in our
checking account will
be available for nonrecurring
appropriation in the coming
Session. But the
expectations for
future reversions do
get built into our
recurring
revenue expectation which
is then um
built on for recurring
budgets. So there is AAA
component of
building future
recurring spending
on sort of
ballooning
reversions
from agencies.
>> So, I mean, that's something we probably
need to really look at.
Right. That
and bars, what were the bars
out of the, at the end of the year
to spend for? I
mean, whatever,
right? Unless it
was federal money coming
in. Unless the bar
was something that
was in a
deficit,
then any reversions
that they spent, I mean,
uh the Department
of Corrections was infamous for this
last year, right?
Taking 200 level
money and then, and
then, you know, doing
capital improvements with
it. Well, when they should just ask for the
capital improvements and not built
it into that reoccurring
budget. So
as we expanded their reoccurring
budget, they're, they're really
using capital for reoccurring
and it's gonna throw
that number off.
I mean, how do we tighten up those
numbers
and say, ok
to this agency? Well, you had
100 million, you averted 90.
So we're gonna do a 10%
increase on your, on your
budget to keep that
non that reoccurring
number coming down because
they're not using
that
and that's a big scenario to go through.
But I mean,
>> yeah, um Mr.
Chair, I
think when it comes
to committing to recurring
spending for an agency that
reverted a lot, that's
a decision and analysis
that should
come up or will come up during
the budget hearing. It might
not be on our revenue side.
I think if you want to do
something on the revenue side, something like
Representative Pettigrew suggested
could be really helpful.
But um I
certainly agree that
when
looking at recurring spending
reversions are a big
indicator
of, of budget
needs. >> But we've
over, we've overinflated
these budgets and they can't
spend it. And
then, you know, just
say it was a 10% increase
in that agency over time,
then that 10%
is included in our overall number
when they're not actually spending it. So
we could drop that
if we went across the board and did
10% to everybody
that they're really not spending,
then then our reoccurring
number would come
down.
II I think that might be
have to be in our
scenario to try to figure out
Charles. >> And so Mr.
Chairman, that's part of
um the direction and the budget
guidelines is to take a look at those
things for analysts to
say, uh how do
we rightsize this budget
based on what they're able
to get out the door
year in and year out?
Um And that's what you actually did
with the corrections budget this last
year, as you tried to
rightsize that to make
sure they could provide the security
services, um
but not continue to overfund
them. Um
The same thing with, uh
looking at the bars.
Uh are there opportunities
to reallocate
savings for a different
purpose within the
agency because they're continually not
able to fill all the positions
that they've, they've had
funded to do other
work. So
that reallocation or reduction
is an analysis that staff will
be bringing forward on
both of those to make sure agency
budgets are right sized.
>> And izzie, I don't know if that would
be a reallocation. I, I think
it just should be a reduction, right?
Because we're, we're at the cap,
to me, we're this cap
scenario, right?
We've given away this much,
our reliance has increased
this much, right? We
need to close that
gap and you
got two choices, raise
taxes, right? Get
the money back
and in and lower your
reliance, right?
Because if something happens, then
you have that
or you got to start making
reductions now
to make rightsize
agencies. So if it does
happen that
they right size because
I mean, we gave the environment department
where they up 100 and 60
some percent this
year
and they've been saying
they've been struggling for years, but I mean,
every agency can no
longer say, oh, well,
since 2009
or 2016, when
I got cut, I I never
got back to that level again,
they're above those levels,
right? And with
the pay study and the pay
increases across the
board
everywhere, we should have
leveled off this year.
And so how do we really, this
is the year we have to
rightsize the budget
moving forward
no matter how much money we have,
right?
I'm asking you that question
and give me this month,
>> Mr. Chair. That's
um you know, the difficult
decision I think as, as
represented here that, that
you all face is
what's, what's the
right point of right sizing. We,
we can offer some
guidance like a
cushion between recurring
revenue and recurring spending.
Um different mechanisms to
take one
time revenue surges
out of the recurring equation
so that um you all
can maybe worry a little bit
less about that volatility.
Um But that's certainly a
difficult decision to make
and um not
maybe not in my prerogative to
tell you all how
to approach
it other than the guidance
that I can offer.
>> Yeah, I mean, is this the year that
you rightsize the budget
over the last four years,
we've increased, what, 30
some percent?
What, what do we increase over four
years?
>> Mr. Chair depends on the timeline,
but
certainly, I think that
would be the three year calculation
off the top of my head.
>> So I mean, this is the year
for right sizing because we
funneled that money in, in,
in three years in recovery plus
ARPA
plus the amount of capital out
there. Uh To
me, this is the year you rightsize
everything to get it stabilized. So
you can take a good
look for +357,
10 years out.
If we don't do that this year in right
sizing budgets, then
we're going to be in this
voluntarily.
He and say we're just gonna
guess so. I
mean,
I think you guys need to work extra
hard on figuring
out where agencies are at,
right?
And what they've done in the last three
years
to right side cos
anything happens in the
market,
I mean, we're, we reliance is
going up and, and it's going
down the reserve.
I mean, the reserve number is just,
it's a number, right?
How many years can we make
it? If we had a
10% or a 20%
or 30% or
40% downturn
in, in without having
to go in and draw from other
funds.
I mean, we
look at capital and we have
what 5.5 billion
sitting there, Kelly
in capital roughly around
that, right?
And, and I'm gonna ask
you so, you know, maybe that this
numbers how much of that
is in cash,
right?
And how much is bonded
and what's the blend?
Because
there's no place in the
State that's going to use a billion
or $2 billion worth of capital
within one year.
And so how do you soften your
reserve number
and create
other funds or other
avenues
to help uh get the
return on investment, right?
Your earnings is what's going to save
the general fund in a downturn
unless the stock
market completely crashes.
And so if you can earn your way out
of that with income
and, and not have to
increase taxes, I mean,
that's a scenario, that's
really the best
scenario.
So I think we're going to have to
look at should we
target capital
as a reserve number?
And the legislature
in Senators has been
here over 26 years. I
think
we've never been able to change
capital. So
downturn in the economy
May, May help us
resolve the capital
problem if, if we
say this
is included in our
reserves
and, and
if anything happens,
capitals going away and,
and we're gonna
stabilize
because 6 billion
is 5 billion
is uh
is that in reserves
30%
>> Mr. Chair closer to
5050 >> percent.
So we have 50%
plus 30 we have 80%
sitting there of unspent
money
when we could get a
30%
or return on 30%
of it. And it's
kind of a, a magical
number. But I mean,
whenever you have cash in the bank that's
sitting there doing nothing, you need to do something
with
it,
>> Mr. Chair, if I could, the
5 billion is, is
also being invested
right now at the State treasurer's
office contributing
to that sort of volatility we're seeing
from the State treasurer. So we are getting a return
on it currently,
um
whether it's bonded or
cash.
>> Yeah, but the reserve is, is
doing the same scenario.
It's just which number are you gonna
count,
right?
OK.
I represent a
small,
>> thank. Thank you very much,
Mr. Chair. Thank you very
much Izzy um
Mr. Chair for Izzy.
Uh the
So next year
after SV
26 fully
implemented, uh
our volatility
will
decrease
>> Mr. Chair. I,
we estimate that that will
be the case.
The, the
um what will be
a sort of determining factor is these
other new sources
of volatile revenues in the
pit in the G RT
in the C um
in O earnings in
reversions will
outpace that we don't expect
that to be the case. We expect stability
to improve because of that
change. Um the
counterfactual.
So if, if that measure had not
been put into place, we
expect we'd be 55%
more volatile. So, so we
have a, we're expecting a 55%
reduction in volatility against the
counterfactual and
overall stability to also
improve, dependent
on the path forward
with these new sources of
volatile revenue in the general fund.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you, Izzy.
The, the really
the big way to increase
volatility would be
to do sort of one
of two things
uh overspend
on recurring
go at or even
above recurring
revenues and
or to
enact another
large revenue
deduction, another large
tax package that is
completely unpaid
for those would be, I
guess two clear
ways to increase
volatility. Which do
you agree, Mr. Chair?
Absolutely, Mr. Chair
and Mr. Chair,
those scenarios, I think
I feel fully comfortable
in saying we're
taking those off of the table.
It's the responsible thing to
do, but Mr. Chair
and Mr.
Torres
taking those two
really irresponsible things
off the table that
still leaves us a ton of
tools as we look at
next year's budget.
Would you agree,
>> Mr. Chair,
a ton of
tools a to
I still think a large amount of
opportunity for spending,
given, given those
constraints
and, and other tools in the toolbox
as presented here and maybe
others that I'm not thinking of here
to improve
the state's stability. Absolutely.
>> That's great. Thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you
Mr. Torres. You know,
I think a couple of things
come to mind, you know, last
ye yesterday, the
presentation with
the next generation
VO eight and II, I
know Representative Armstrong has
stepped out, really appreciate
her putting together
work to do the explosives
to her. Um
But it is fascinating
for us to hear,
you know, 19
eighties they put
in the VL A right,
biggest thing at that time,
still one of the biggest things
that we have here in the State,
the State paid
for uh the
visitors museum we put
up, you know, we were
excellent partners
with far fewer
resources. Would
you agree, Mr. Chair or
just,
I don't know if you have to agree or
disagree, that just sort of,
it really struck me that we
were helping build big
things,
you know, 40 plus years
ago under
remarkably tighter
fiscal
constraints.
>> Mr. Chair Representative
Small II, I
think to that
question, what comes to mind is the chart on
page six, which
is to show
that
our, our total
budget was certainly
smaller, but
one of the benefits of
stable revenues
and stable revenue growth
is the confidence that you
all can have in making those kinds of
investments. And
the recent volatility
is sort of um it,
it makes those kinds of
investments challenging.
Um as Senator Munoz pointed
out because
of the concern that
revenues could decline and and
maybe those appropriations might need to be
pulled back. So
that that's maybe I
can you. >> Thank
you Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr.
Torre, that I love that. I think
that sort of stability
and confidence
really allows
longer term thinking, couldn't
agree more. Although
Mr. Chair Mr.
Torres, that
brings me back to sort of
SB 26 going into
effect
alls well,
not all
dominant
signs point towards
reduction volatility. We
see an overall reduction
in 20 by
22.
It seems to me that
we're on a very clear path,
particularly
in the likely and
certainly the current
price and production
environment where we're
going to be looking at sending
potentially a
billion plus
straight to the severance
tax, permanent fund
without any of us having
a chance to do anything with
that. And that
obviously compounds
very, very quickly.
Um Mr.
Chair Mr. Torres Investments
still looked at as one of our
fastest growing sources
of general fund
income.
That's right, Mr. Chair. That's
awesome. And, and Mr.
Chair, Mr. Torres
briefly, you know, for
some of the areas I certainly, I think
about departments like NME
the New Mexico Environment depart
department.
Pretty significant
investment.
You the same news
articles that we have,
they're staffing up and
they're able to
inspect facilities
in a way that just simply wasn't
humanly possible
before Mr.
Chair Mr. Torres. What's
come from those
inspections
for me not
to put for me? What's
come from it is doing
a better job, more
fines for folks who are doing the
wrong thing, fines and
money that comes back here
and collaboration with
folks who are doing the right thing.
What does that mean? Mr. Chair
Mr. Torres for rigs,
rigs still at 100 and
seven? You know,
stable Mr.
Chair Mr. Torres
with that increased
regulatory scrutiny
and public safety.
Are we still sort of
punching above our weight
weight? pro rata,
we're stronger
in drilling stronger in
production than,
than Texas. Would you agree
with that? Mr. Chair Mr. Torres
for the share of the
basin.
>> Mr. Chair
Texas does have a larger
share of, of rigs
in the basin.
Um But certainly
to your point about punching over our way
on a per capita basis,
um the best,
the best, maybe the second best in the
country. >> Thank you, Mr.
Chair Mr. Torres. And you
know, with, they have
two thirds of the production,
they have far
more than two thirds of the
area from which to
produce both onshore
and offshore. And so
that's where I sort of draw
the conclusion that we're
term
punching above our weight.
But um in a
much more concentrated
area with much
more scrutiny, with
better, stronger rules,
more money coming back to us
for fines for folks who are doing
the wrong thing. Partnership
for folks who are doing the right
thing. We're still in this
very strong price and
production environment.
Uh Mr. Chair, Mr.
Torres, as we think
about the uh our
trust funds that
we've created.
Um It
seems to me
that well over
$5 billion
and frankly, probably closer
to 10 is
probably easily
available in sort
of the event of
a catastrophic
COVID like downturn.
Is that your
understanding,
>> Mr. Chair and
representatives or Mr. Vice
Chair, the
the easily accessible might be in the
eye of the beholder um
the certain investments.
So if, if you're counting say
early childhood trust fund or
other longer term funds,
those um uh
are maybe
statutorily
easier to get to in
some sense, but they
are invested in longer term
holdings. So they
take more time to liquidate
um and could
liquidate at a loss from the financial
perspective. So
in terms of um
actually liquid assets
from the economic perspective,
I would say
maybe about 5
billion
>> Mr. Chair, Mr. do.
That's super helpful. Thank you
for that.
Um
So super
helpful, Mr. Chair, Mr.
Torres, I think the
I would echo the call
for um
further analysis
across areas. One
certainly on
all areas
of risk for volatility
and the need to for us
to be on
guard there,
Mr. Chair Mr. Torres,
the um
the opportunity cost
piece strikes
very real, right?
Because if the there are
some things that are core
responsibilities
and if it's a road that we don't
rebuild today, and
we're going to rebuild that road in
five years when
it takes a full and
complete and higher
cost, that
is a
opportunity cost that this
State will have to bear
and that will potentially
impact us more
negatively than
were we able to address
that? Which is can
be one of the arguments
for staffing
up or at least
strategically investing
in technical
services so
that we have the folks to bring up
infrastructure online
now. So the opportunity
cost and Mr. Chair
bringing back to the consensus
revenue estimating
group,
the
additional information, you know
the suggestions about new
funds I think is really
wise.
Also a
consideration
about reserve
level targets
within
our reality
where we can say
sort of 50%
reserves $5
billion that
is relatively
that is politically
accessible
liquid enough
to to
uh to utilize
should that need and hopefully
it doesn't ever arise.
We need to, we need
to look at new
funds, we need to
rightsize our reserve target.
We need to be
appropriately sort of
cautious about recurring
spending growth and
start really thinking about
what these opportunity costs
are, uh and
how it influences
how we act.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you very much for that. Let's
mov'e on to Representative
Herndon, your next representative
and then we have Sanders
Sheriff.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Just
three quick questions. Um
Mr. Torres, as we
look yesterday, we talked
about bars
and particularly looking
at the insurance
uh department of Insurance
and there's some additional
money that needs to be made given
there. My question is,
where does that money come
from? And so
does it come from a reserve
or there's
recurring
dollars? So that's
already been set
aside to be spent? But now it's just gonna
go to another uh
department or
area. Is that how we use that
money >> madam Chair
and Representative Hernan. There,
there are a couple, there are a
few ways you
could appropriate to that
fund. One is
from the pot of available
recurring dollars, another
from the pot of nonrecurring or
reserves as you call it, as you
mentioned. Um, they
could also come from other funds that's
obviously a less used
option. Um So
there are a variety of options available to you that
could come from recurring or nonrecurring
sources. >> I I
only mentioned that because one of the things
that came up is that someone overspends
that budget. That,
that's a criminal activity.
But if we have the recurring
dollars that have been set
aside for a budget anyway and not
being used, I'm just
wondering that that
application wouldn't apply under
those circumstances because
the budget hasn't gone over anywhere.
We're just putting it in another
place.
Well, you probably don't need to answer
that one. Ok. So then
another question that I just want to
ask is with respect to our
general fund dollars.
So our, our
treasury, our Department
of Treasury uh
is required to invest
our money. And so do we
have a statutory amount
uh uh expected on
return on our
dollars
in our general
fund, >> madam
Chair and Representative, no,
there is not AAA
minimum or a goal
or a target in statute for
their earnings because
those earnings are highly dependent
on the market and
also on interest
rates. So,
um, it would be
difficult to expect them to
meet some sort of
minimum because it's
difficult to predict the
amount that they might earn in a given
year. >> Ok.
And just one last question for
understanding with respect to
our reserves,
is there a percentage
of the reserves that has to
be liquid at any
given time? Because
those reserves I'm expecting
are to be, are being invested
so that if we do need to
use them, they are available right
away without penalty to the
State >> madam Chair and
Representative Hernan, I would consider all of our
reserves to be liquidated. They could be
used at any time.
>> Ok.
All right. Thank you. Thank you, madam
Chair. Thank you.
>> Thank you, Senator Sheriff.
You're next. >> Thank you
madam Chair.
So one of the things that we didn't
touch on that,
that I wish I
thought of earlier is the,
the pensions in in funding
those, does that add to our volatility?
Because, well,
eventually we're gonna have to pay
those.
>> Uh Mr. Chair and
Senator Share. This
study was specific to the general
fund. I think on
a statewide basis,
um We could,
the analysis would change
probably to the point you're making
more volatility in the
long run. Um This is
not a forward-looking estimate
of volatility. It's, it's
really looking
backwards.
>> Ok.
So
madam Chair,
I do think that
that's one of the things that we need to
consider if
we have excess funds again.
How do you, how do you take
that out of
the equation for future
volatility?
Um
I know we had talked about no,
no new taxes here a little
bit ago, but I
believe tax reform
is, is important
and, and we've always
danced around that because
anybody puts in something,
well, it's not tax reform, it's
tax cuts and, oh my God,
the Republicans have lost their mind
again.
Um,
but one of the things that I honestly
believe is
that we're not overtaxed in New
Mexico particularly,
but we are taxed in such a
confusing way
that people don't understand it.
So when, when they send out their
site selectors,
they look at this and they go,
well, I don't understand the tax
code. Let's go to Arizona
and they've never, and,
and it's difficult to get past that
first step.
Ok. Uh
So we've got things
here, but, but the
tax,
the way we're taxed, I
believe is a serious
problem.
Um, maybe my
tax plan is not the one, but
we certainly ought to be studying
that and thinking about that
because I think that if we had the
tax plan
right,
then we reduce volatility
for a variety of
reasons. But,
but then we can attract other
industries.
And,
um,
and I think that we're overlooked a
lot. In fact, I've talked to
site selectors. They don't
understand. Oh, yes,
we got Lita and we got Jtip.
Yeah, but what the hell
is the groce receipts tax? And
I don't understand this other tax
and I don't, yes, you can give me
this tax break, but I don't understand
it. So they're not even
willing to put in the time and effort to
do that. So I think that,
that that would
help on a variety of
things. Also,
I believe the way we regulate
ourselves
because sometimes our regulations
seem to be just punitive.
Oh, we don't like you, let's regulate
you as opposed
to uh health and
safety kind of regulations. So
I'm not talking about,
uh you know, doing away with all
regulations so that we are,
are polluting the environment.
But I, but I do think that our
regulation, our regulatory
mindset
again drives away other
possibilities besides oil and
gas. And truly
the only reason oil and gas companies
are here is because they can still
make money despite
the confusion in taxes. And
despite the regulatory
world we have,
but it seems that we're trying to
run them off too
anyway.
And then when we look
at new industries right
away, we
we,
we make some kind
of,
I don't know, we come to some kind
of conclusion that that's a bad
industry and I want to use
carbon capture, for example.
So carbon capture, we had the
opportunity to be the
center of the universe on
carbon
capture.
We could have been
that
we could have been
the intel of carbon
capture. And we
decided that that was bad that
the technology wasn't right. And
now people all over the world are going
to carbon capture
and we're gonna be left behind because
because we're probably
never gonna do it right.
And if we do it now,
we're the latecomers to the
dance and we could
have been the center
of the universe,
but we made some kind of weird political
decision
that's counter to the volatility
issue. That is very
real.
Um
When we look at our
infrastructure,
we need, well, San
Juan County of course, needs rail,
but the rest of the
State are
roads we're talking about. If we don't
fix the road now, we're gonna have to fix
it more cost in five years.
Well, sometimes even
if we build the road now we're gonna have to
rebuild it in five years
because we put all these heavy trucks
on it and it really wasn't designed
for all these heavy trucks.
So, so we
need to think about that as well.
How do you, how do you make at least
one of those lanes
be able to stand up to heavy
trucks for a couple of decades
as opposed to a couple of
years. And
if we have enough money,
then let's, let's do that.
But then again, that
reduces the,
the volatile
volatility
because again, now we
can attract other businesses.
And so from
my perspective,
volatility
is based on
oil and gas is is
our industry. We're
all in the oil and gas business,
whether we want to be or not, we're
all there because that's who
pays, that's who pays
the teacher's salary. Most progressive
teacher in Santa Fe is in the
oil and gas business because that's
who pays the salary.
So
if we don't want that, then we've got
to expand our
horizons and say, ok,
now we're ready for some
kind of manufacturing. Now we're
ready
for
whatever. I mean, there's
so many things out
there.
So
yes, all the things
we talked about, but
until we're, until we are ready
to truly expand
our horizons beyond oil and
gas,
it will always be volatile.
So
that's where I am. Thank
you.
>> Thank you. Thank you very much for
your um comments
and um looking
back to our
co-chair here,
Nathan Small. Thank you for
your, for your great comments you
made earlier too. I know you're
busy talking is always
humble, but I just want
to say thank you for those comments
that you made. You're absolutely correct
in, in what you indicated. So,
ok, then um
I think that is it for this
topic? We're thank
you, Izzy. We're going to mov'e on to
the capital outlay.
Spotlight Kelly.
There you are.
If you are
next.
>> Um madam Chair Members of
the Committee were behind Tab
L.
Um I'm Kly Carwell
here with my colleague, Antonio
Ortega and we work on Capitol
Outlay for you all at LFC.
Um Today we're gonna
present to
you a uh quick highlights
on local
capital outlay in Socorro County,
as well as a couple project
specific um
highlights for the village of Magdalena
and for New Mexico
Tech. So
I will um run you through
this memo quickly
starting on page
one.
You can see that local entities
in Coo County from
2019 to 2023
received 30 capital
outlay appropriations
totaling $7.9
million for that whole fouryear
period and outstanding
balances on those projects
um are currently sitting at about
72%
to give you a sense of
scale. Um
This puts local
entities in Socorro County
in sort of the bottom tier
in terms of total
capital outlay received.
There are only 10
counties in the
State that over this
fouryear period receive
total capital outlay,
appropriations of less
than $10 million
including Socorro County.
Um These numbers are
starting to mov'e up.
Um The largest chunk,
about 50% of their
capital appropriations
over that four year period
happened in 2023.
And you can see in the second main
bullet on the front of this
memo, uh local
entities in Socorro County
received um just under
$5 million in capital
appropriations in the
2024 Session
alone. Um
So, you know, that's
kind of a Majority of what they
received over the fouryear period
by contrast.
Um However, uh
there is more capital
money overall going
into Socorro County due
mainly to the presence of
New Mexico Tech
here in Socorro.
Um and also the firefighter
Trading Academy that is
run by the Homeland Security
Department.
So over that same 44
year period, um
higher education and State agency
projects in this county
received uh
over $21
million and
balances on those projects
are sitting at about
90% right
now um
driven mainly by
the Kelly Hall building
that is under
construction.
Um Here on this
campus right now that you'll hear a
little bit more about from Antonio
going forward.
Uh in the table on this page,
you can see the top
recipients of local
capital outlay in Socorro
County. They are the city
of Socorro, followed by the
Navajo Nation. Um
The satellite community of
Alamo um that
belongs to the Navajo
Nation is in Socorro County.
Uh and the village of
Magdalena
if you'll turn now to page
two.
Um We're not
highlighting projects
in the city of
Socorro in our spotlights
that Antonio will take you through.
But I did wanna give
you a little bit of a picture
of some things going on in the
city.
Um So you can see on
the in the first
bullet under city of
Socorro on page two that
Socorro received uh
about $2.5
million from 2019 to
2023
and about half of that
was in a larger
appropriation um
for improvements to the Finlay Gym
complex.
Um We also wanted
to point out to you
that um Socorro
County is home to one of
the senior centers that has
been struggling to
spend its capital
appropriations.
Um We've talked during the
budget cycles
recently
about these
large outstanding
balances on
the GB
packages for senior
centers.
Um
and those
large outstanding ba
outstanding balances
were mainly driven by kind of a
group of senior
centers, uh for
which there were zero expenditures
on their projects sometimes even
after three years.
Um And the Vegeta Senior
Center in Socorro County
is one of the senior
centers that falls into that
category. Um They
have three outstanding
appropriations
that have zero expenditures
in them. You can see a list of
those in the second
bullet under the
city of Socorro.
Um, they're relatively
small um,
appropriations that
they've struggled to spend.
Um And
uh there are some folks
from the city of Socorro who can answer more
questions on this
here if you would like.
But, um this
senior Center was actually
closed for the past
year. Um
The non metro AAA
uh terminated the
contract with the
county who was previously
running the Senior Center,
which led to its closure.
Uh My understanding is
that this center has
uh experienced some
operational challenges as
well as budget issues that
led to this.
Um It has recently
been transferred to the
city who will now operate
it and who just
reopened it.
Um
And
um,
the
uh so I guess I
would say now that it is reopened,
we'd hope to see some progress
on these appropriations
including the one dating back
to 2020
which has been extended
for a year, um
but will need to be spent
soon for that money not
to be
lost.
All right. Uh If you turn
to page three,
here at the top of this page. You
can see a summary of the Village
of Magdalena's capital
appropriations. They received
a little over a million and a half
dollars from 2019 to
2023.
And in 2024
they received four new
appropriations totaling about
$700,000
for projects that did not appear
on the Village's IC
IP. Um I just
wanted to say a little bit here
about a disconnect
that can commonly exist
between the IC IP and
actual capital appropriations
that are made by the legislature.
Um You can see
in the table the top
priority uh
projects that are on
the village's IC IP,
including
uh some wastewater
improvements that are over $5
million and a
community event center
that is $2.5
million for communities
of this size. It is very
difficult for them to
fund these larger
projects through
capital outlay.
Um Because there simply
just isn't enough money to go
around uh from
their Senators and
representatives.
So sometimes
there is a disconnect between
what's on the IC IP or
the planning document for
local governments for
capital projects
and what is actually requested
of you. Um Just
because communities,
you know, sort of know it's not
realistic that they can
um go ask
Representative Jaramillo or
Representative Armstrong for
$5 million
for a community with 800
people. So that's sometimes
why you actually don't
even see the requests for
the projects that appear on their
IC I PS. Um
And why it can be
difficult to ultimately
fund those higher priorities
at the local level.
Um
What one
thing that the village of
Magdalena has focused
on, um,
significantly in the past
10 years and has made progress
on which you'll hear more from
Antonio about uh
is critical
improvements to its water
system about 10
years ago, they experienced
a water crisis.
Um And that
has resulted in
their focus on improving that
critical
infrastructure.
Um And lastly before I turn
it over to Antonio, um
as I mentioned, uh
New Mexico Tech is
actually the major recipient
of capital dollars
in Socorro County as a
whole. Um
with total appropriations
nearing $20 million
from 2019 to
2023.
Um And again,
that is mainly driven
by a major construction
project uh with
appropriations dating back to
the 2020 GB cycle
that is being built
now. Um
And Antonio will take
you through some specific
projects for Magdalena and
Tech
now.
>> Good morning Mr. Chair.
Uh Yeah. So starting
us off with our first project
spotlight. Uh the village
of Magnan, Magdalena,
which as Kelly had mentioned has
been making uh improvements
to its water systems
um as part of a broader
effort to address the
2014 water crisis
when its only functional
well went dry.
Uh The village has prioritized
constructing or improving
three additional wells and
associated infrastructure
and implementing well monitoring
systems that allow earlier
identification of low
water levels.
Currently projects supported
with capital outlay include
improvements to the Benjamin
well, these improvements
consist of installing a new
well pump, enhancing
a well house and adding a
new storage tank and
building a booster pump
station.
The new tank will add
100,000 gallons
of storage capacity
and the booster station will reduce
pressure on aging pipes
which often break under pressure
when drawing water directly from the
well.
Uh The incremental upgrades
aim to enhance Magdalena's
water infrastructure,
increasing storage capacity
and reducing pressure on
pipes will ensure a more
reliable water supply and
reduce the frequency of pipes
breaking, making
service more reliable to
residents.
In addition to capital outlay, the
village has received 1 million
in support from the drinking water
State revolving fund to drill
a new well and make other
system improvements.
This funding package includes
a $250,000
loan component with the
remainder provided as a
grant.
If the village utilizes the full
award loan repayments
over 30 years will total
about 8700
per year or
$725
per month
cost. Escalation is a
significant concern and May
prevent the village from completing
the project's intended scope
without additional funds.
Additionally, village staff
reported that all water
lines need to be replaced
a project that could cost an
estimated $15
million
capacity to manage grants
and projects and to maintain
existing infrastructure is also
a challenge for the village which
has limited staff who wear
multiple hats. Uh
For example, the village did
not have a Clerk for
about two years which resulted
in them falling behind
on reimbursement requests.
And furthermore, during a site
visit with legislative staff,
the mayor had to take an
ambulance call as he not
only runs point on the water
system improvements but is also
a medical first
responder.
While the village has made
significant progress since
2014, there's a lot more
work to be done on its water
systems. Like many
communities in the State, its basic
infrastructure is
old and failing more
frequently indicating a need
for ongoing investment to
fully modernize the water
infrastructure and ensure
long term
reliability.
Uh Now, moving on to the next
page
with the New Mexico Institute
of Mining and Technology
uh Cali Hall
edition,
uh the Cali Hall edition
at New Mexico Tech.
Uh Well, a actually I wanted to
preface with a little note
um saying although
we have mainly been focusing
on local appropriations and
spotlights this year,
we wanted to highlight a statewide
project at New Mexico Tech
because the university
uh is the major recipient
of capital dollars in
Socorro County,
New Mexico Tech is
currently constructing a
major addition to the Cali
Hall petroleum recovery
Research Center, also known
as the PR RC
to improve lab safety and
efficiency replacing the
46 year old original
Cali Hall building.
Uh during a site visit. LFC
staff noted water damage
from fru roof leaks
and high temperatures resulting
from a lack of cooling and proper
ventilation for many lab
spaces which spoke
to the need for the project.
Uh As of fiscal
year 23 the P
double RC employs 27
full-time staff, six
supported faculty and
serves 32 grad
students,
research labs at Caley Hall
support enhanced and
improved oil recovery
methods, co two
sequestration research,
core flooding hydrogen
production, research and surface
chemistry.
The project is proceeding in two
phases due to cost
escalation and the need to spend
the initial appropriation before
its reversion date.
Appropriations for the project
date back to the 2020
General Obligation bond
cycle. And the project's
trajectory speaks to the
challenge in the current construction
environment of providing
major appropriations to higher
education projects.
Before planning and design has
really progressed.
New Mexico Tech noted
that plans for the building were
reduced by 5000 square
feet due to the cost
escalations.
Phase one is currently under
construction and includes
various labs, utility
work and office spaces.
Phase two, supported by
8.5 million in general
obligation bonds secured in
2024 will add
additional labs, office
spaces and restrooms.
These funds will need to be
approved by voters this fall
to become available to the
university to complete
phase two.
The Caley Hall edition at the New
Mexico Institute of Mining
and Technology is a
$25.2
million project with a
cost per square foot of
1110
that aims to improve the university's
infrastructure. The
P double RC recently
secured a $52
million carbon sequestration
grant and this research
is conducted by faculty
House in Cali Hall
underscoring the importance of
the faculty for ongoing and
future research
endeavors.
Thank you.
>> Um Mr. Chair.
That's all we have. I just wanted
to um acknowledge
that the mayor
and the town Clerk of Magdalena
are here. Um And
thank them for the time they spent
with us. Uh as
well as staff from the city
of Socorro. Um
and New Mexico
Tech
>> take questions from Committee
Members,
Representative
Armstrong,
>> thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you
for your report. Um
Just so people
know, I've, I've sent an
email to try to get
those um capital at a
dollars to vegeta moving
through the city and
hopefully that, that we had the
same issue in the village of
Magdalena. Uh our,
our prior
county manager decided
to and, and I guess
the commission decided to end it
with the,
um, for the senior
centers with the State. And
so
county just said, I'm
out, we do
now have a new county manager
and we'll see where that goes from
there. But I know the village of
Magdalena took on the
responsibility along with the
city of Socorro and we
appreciate that because we
should be taking care of our
seniors and our veterans
for sure. Um,
one of the, the things
that I can tell you, everyone
knows we're beating a dead horse
with the information
of
the rising escalation
costs of things. So,
you know, the, the mayor just handed
me a little note that
says, you know, they have 1.2
million on hand to try to fix
the complete the Benjamin,
well, the booster station
and the water tank and
they're $1.2
million short.
So, and
most people know in
rural New Mexico,
especially in, in
my district in
Magdalena, they have
two
legislators,
a Senator and a representative
Socorro City of Socorro
ha has a representative
Jaramillo, but I don't actually have the
city of Socorro anymore, but we
still try to work together to fund
as much as we can.
That's, you know,
feasible.
Um,
and I appreciate
this information.
I actually took it out of my book.
I don't think I'm supposed to do that, but
I did because I
want to make sure
that
nothing against the mayor
or the village of Magdalena. But
like we said, we don't, they don't know how
to manage sometimes or a
ask for the money.
And so helping with
Callie and I have talked about this
and several of us
having someone that they
could go to where they
could ask for the help.
How do we
start this
project and how do we end it? And
where do we get the money and
they're doing the best they can.
And uh as you know, heard
earlier, the mayor wears many
hats in
Magdalena. And that's part of the
problem with frontier
and rural New Mexico
is uh the same
thing in the school system. The, you
know, the athletic director
is also the principal and teaches
English.
So
I really would encourage us
to find some kind of
entity
that and, and all cogs
are not created
equally
to help
these individual
uh smaller towns
uh manage.
They're just as important to me
as the city of, of
Socorro or Tier C
or, or Berlin.
So
if we could find some help
where they could get some help to
manage the the funds
coming in
and it would
be really helpful. So, thank
you uh the mayor to the mayor
and the city and the the
county for all they do and to
Representative Jaramillo.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman
>> Kelly, you
May also want to
give to Representative Armstrong is
the grant fund match,
right? That can also
be used to leverage the difference
for the 1.2. And that would
be a grant.
I think we put 75
million in there last
year this year.
So, I mean, there's,
there's leveraging out
there,
you just got to match them up and,
and so if you can match
up the grant money with
the with the appropriation
in the loan, then I think
you can get the loan paid for
and the grant money.
Senator Woods, was it you
that wanted on the list?
Then I'll go down the line
>> quickly, Mr. Chair.
I noticed the cost per square
foot on the
institute. Uh
building is
$1110.
Does that include
the uh lab
equipment on
that?
That's, that's kind of
pricey. I was just
wondering
>> Mr. Chair, Senator
Woods, I believe it
does.
Yes,
we, we can get you confirmation
on
that.
>> And on the, the
city, uh
Magdalena, the
water.
Well,
I was talking about it
costing
700
$1000
somewhere.
Is that
>> so one year
>> original cost I think was
there, they got appropriated
million two, they had a shortfall
for a million or a million two
because
cost and so they're a
million million too
short if I remember
>> correctly.
>> Now, that's, that's the whole
water system or is that just
the well?
>> Well, on the pump
>> station,
Mr. Chair, Senator Woods, I can
clarify a little bit.
Um So
we, we've kind of done this
with a couple
quote-unquote water projects
and local communities that we've
spotlighted where
they're making sort of a
bunch of incremental
improvements to
the water system from a
number of different funding
sources. And
uh in this case, were
sort of reporting to
you on all of
those active
projects.
Um And so
they had a million
dollars from the drinking water State
revolving fund um
to drill a new well and
make associated
infrastructure
improvements and
construct associated
infrastructure. Um
They also have
capital outlay that
Representative Armstrong
mentioned
to make
improvements to
another well,
um including
infrastructure associated with the
well, a booster station
and a storage
tank. So there's,
there's kind of a bunch of
different things going on
that are all sort of aimed
at the
same goal of
making the water system
one more resilient in
terms of supply
and also just
function better
um with some
of the aging pipe
problems that they
have.
>> I'm not gonna ask any more
questions. Thank
you,
>> representative
one.
>> I
thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um And thank you
Kelly for coming in presenting.
So I think really what this highlights
is all of us and uh
representatives of rural
areas, how thinly we
are stretched when it comes to
giving our communities money
and um
and trying to equalize that
out for urban
areas.
Um uh
who uh II, I
think we talked,
we were so envious that um
reps in, in Albuquerque were
able to build a park and we were really
struggling for water
and sewer and, and
those needs and
um going back to
Vitta, I really want to thank the city for
stepping up um when the counties
stepped back
and uh and providing
that. So what is
I, I hear that in
2020 they
um were allocated
84,000 and they really
need that. They just opened
the vegeta site um
Monday.
So what are the chances of
them getting that
84,000? That
um that is just sitting
there?
>> Um Mr. Chair,
Representative Hario.
Um So
according to our reporting
system, the aging
and long-term services department
has extended
the deadline for spending that
money by a
year. Um
And, you know,
as far as it stands at this
point, that means that
that money would need to be
spent um
in the next year.
Um As Representative
Armstrong kind of spoke
to, there's a little
bit of an administrative issue
with the funding was allocated
to the county, but now the
city has assumed responsibility
for the senior center. Um
And that's what she was
indicating there's
efforts to figure out right
now that needs to happen
before they can actually spend it.
>> Ok. Thank you so much.
Thank you, Mr. Chair
>> represent
pedigree.
>> Thank you Chairman. Thank you, Kelly.
Uh
The
as, as I go through these
numbers and water system
improvements are one of the things
that
just
I deal with a lot. 20 years
ago, Chairman, I
could,
we could have a water well
issue and
I could get
design and permit
through the Os ES office
in less than three
months.
Now, I'm lucky to be able
to do that in 9 to 12
months. The
bureaucracy that we put
through this
to be able to do some of
the things that we need to do
actually change the
engineering costs and almost
double them
because of the process that we
go through that we
have to continue to go
through the amount
of money that you have to build.
What you want to do is
nowhere near what you
need.
I can, I can tell you
that up front and,
and it, and
there there needs to be a way
that we can, we
can
work to streamline
some of that process
as we continue to
mov'e forward
with this.
And
we talk about the disparity
with respect to capital outlay
and rural communities versus
urban communities.
Chairman, I think it would be really
good to see
county by
county
updates on
when capital outlay is
put out
county population
and amount
of capital
outlay
compared 33
counties
after every cycle.
And look at that. I can
tell you mckinley
County, um,
outdoes us in Lee County.
I, I want to say 7
to 1. It May be as
high as 12 to 1. That's
been a while since I've looked at those
numbers,
it would be good to be able to look
at that and figure a way
because our rural communities
still have to
survive.
And some of those rural
communities are the ones
that actually provide for
the urban communities
to survive.
We look at, uh, how
much return on investment.
Um Ben Leo
County
puts back into the
State. I think it's somewhere around
$2300 per
person.
Uh Lee County is
over 200,000 per
person.
You look at that,
separating that, putting
that, that, um,
money out there and,
and then redistributing
it in such a way that it helps
all of our counties
and our rural counties.
When we compare those things, I
think, I just think it'd be really good
to see what that capita
outlay percentage looks
like every year
so that we can actually start
making some good decisions
that protect our rural
communities. Thank you,
Chair.
>> You know, they do it by county,
right? And by, we
already do it by
county
capa. A right. We do
it by county agency
city. We do city. I don't
remember if we separate
the cities.
No. So we do it by
county and,
and get that total, then you
gotta break it out,
you know, who gave it where
it came from,
how it's doing. If you gave your
share, they'll give you a sheet
every quarter, who's
moving their money, who's not moving
their money. So
you, you want to drill down
into percentages. I don't know
if, if we can do
that in the system.
That pro that's probably a
hand.
I don't know how you do that over a five
year period of $5 billion. I'd
be almost
crazy,
you know, let me just say
no.
>> Um Yeah, I mean, we
don't specifically track
population in the
system. Um We
could put those numbers together for
you. I, you
know, I did look up Seor County
before this and
being in that sort
of bottom
tier in terms of
total dollars they're receiving
does roughly correspond
to also being in like the
bottom 12
counties for population.
Um So, you
know, it is true that the way
the capital outlay system
is currently structured
dollars
flow
via population,
there's a correspondence
in terms of the number of dollars,
uh local communities receive and
how big their populations are.
Um And
you know, whether you think
that's a good thing
or a bad thing is
sort of a matter
of
interpretation.
>> Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, Kelly.
I think mckinley County proves
to be the offset in
that
with respect to population
versus how much money they
receive. So, I'm
just at the end of
it, I, I just think it makes
sense that we look at it
and we continue
to,
um, look at
ways that we can improve,
supporting our rural
communities.
>> Don't look at my cap
outlet because it's all in the
red because
they don't spend it. So just consider
aversions.
If you look at mckinley
County and the way they did cap this
year, you're including all the dot
projects too.
So those are big numbers and big
districts. I mean, so those,
those skewed those numbers
this year if you
look at it that way. So,
so it'll be
different. Any
other questions?
See now, I just want to go back
to one thing on Izzy's presentation
and, and those of you that haven't
been here in
2016
in 2016, the
treasurer made a choice,
right? He had a
choice to go to jail
for writing bad
checks or he had to
continue to, to write
checks. So every State employee
got their pay. Right.
That's how bad it was in
2016.
And so those of you that
haven't seen that
or been through that
and, and
you want stability in,
in your budgeting and in the
State. But
2016 was really,
09, I was there
but the feds came in and gave us
money. But 2016
for someone to make a choice. Do
I not pay a person
payroll? That'd
be you guys at LFC? And,
and a lot of people sitting around
the room and
go to jail or, or what do
we do? Right? Because the State
had no money. Charles.
Do you remember what, what
roughly how much cash we had
in the bank or we in the negative? That's
why we were in the negative.
That's how bad it was
in our reserve level.
At that time, I think
we were at 10%
and our budget was
five,
$5.5 billion was our
budget. Our reserve was
10%
and we still couldn't hold our
head above water and
we, we
emptied out of all of David's
buckets and piggy banks and
everything he had hidden under the
couch. And
so that's how bad it was in
2016.
And those are national
downturns in the
economy.
If you look back at that deal, you can
see the housing
bubble at.com
some of them we didn't get below but
2016
pretty much broke the
bank.
So just, just think about
that, Senator
Gonzalez,
>> thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Just on that
point.
And I was here on
2016 and I have
also been here on prior years
where we really
go through some very tough
times. That's
why, you know, I keep
emphasizing and
repeating how
important to really look at
that recurring part
because every time you add to
the recurring, the base
goes up
and, you know, you can't
leave that out because,
you know, that's what you have,
that's what has happened.
So, you know, keeping that in
mind and you
know, yes,
we do have
the funding that's coming
in, you know, at the surplus
level, but with a very
cautious, you know, to
what it does to the other side
of the recurring part.
So thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
>> Thank you. Thank you. I, I
think we're good,
appreciate everybody's time here
today. It's my understanding that Senator
Sheer and Senator Woods will be
shining shoes for
tomorrow
and Representative Heron
will be ironing shirts for
tomorrow.
Thank you for doing
that.
>> Uh
>> See who we have
next.
>> We got
the,
who's >> doing the bars? >> Charles
Scott
>> Scott, you're doing the bars.
>> Scott will do it first and
then
upside down.
What
>> is there a fire
somewhere?
>> All
good morning, Mr. Chair. My name is Scott
Sanchez. Um
I'm the LFC analyst for public
Safety. Today. We will
discuss the LFC objection to
a budget adjustment request
submitted by the Department of Homeland
Security and emergency management
at the end of fy 24.
Um I'm joined by
State fire Marshal Randy
Varela. Um
Major General Miguel Aguilar is
on his way. Um
Homeland has also brought several
key staff Members who
are behind us in the audience.
>> We are behind Tab
M >> Yes, Tab m
sorry. Some
might remember a hearing in Silver
City in 2022
where a similar objection was
raised.
This is the third time in three years
that this has happened. It's
worth noting that during the
June 19th, 2022
hearing where a similar
objection was lodged, it
was stated that although a late June
bar was not ideal, it would
be a one time occurrence
to get straight to the heart of the matter.
The committee's main concern lies
in the contravention of legislative
intent. Represented by this
request revenue
in the fire protection fund
comes from a 3%
premium tax on auto and
fire insurance collected by the
office of the Superintendent of
Insurance
Senate Bill. 256
passed in 2021
clearly directs any excess
revenues in the fire protection
fund to the general fund,
not the fire protection grant
fund yet.
Homeland Security and emergency
management is again attempting
to mov'e these funds in a way that sidesteps
this directive.
This bar proposed a
substantial $12.2
million increase to the
nonreverting fire protection grant
fund. Mirroring
similar adjustments in fy
22 and again, in
fy 23
all told, nearly
$52.2 million
has been redirected.
Each of these bars is landed on the
analysts desks within a tight
tenay window at the end of the fiscal
year. This
time, C didn't get the
official notification that had been
submitted. We only caught
it because we were dotting our I's and
crossing our Ts on the last day of
the fiscal year.
That means that this bar went into effect.
And even though it's gone into effect, the
Committee still must decide whether
to support directors in his
objection
by submitting these bars.
So late in the fiscal year, the
Department of Homeland Security Emergency
Management effectively
bypasses the legislative review
process and avoids the
debate that such a significant
financial decision warrants.
This approach circumvents the
established process and
impacts the transparency and accountability
Members and constituents
expect
in summary, this objection is not
rooted in the desire to cut funding
for local fire departments,
but rather in the desire to uphold
legislative intent, ensure
the proper use of State funds
and maintain the Integrity of the
legislative review process.
Thank you with
that. I'll hand
it
the State fire
Marshal.
>> Good morning, Mr., Chair Members of
the Committee, Randy Barla Steve
Marshall. Uh
As you're aware, the money
that we do receive from the
fire fund is a 3%
tax and insurance rates
that we all pay.
Uh and this money is very
important for our fire departments in the
State of New Mexico. Uh
As you're aware, the money
that come from the 3%
tax are strictly
for firefighting
for the departments in New Mexico.
If we return any monies
and we continue to return this much
money to general fund.
It's hurting our department out
there and it's hurting our
communities. As
you're aware, the cost
of trucks, cost
of equipment, cost of p pe has
probably gone up by 50%.
And now if you need to order
a piece of equipment,
an engine or
a wildland truck, you're looking for
2 to 3 years, maybe four years
before you receive this piece of
equipment and they're
running an old equipment
trying to maintain this equipment
till they get this. So I
think it's very important that
we continue to support
our local fire departments and keep
this money with
the fire departments
as it was intended
for.
>> Thank you anything
else
this,
so,
Charles, why don't you review
this? So, so
everybody understands
what's, it's not
like we don't want support
firefighters, but the way you're
doing it is
is in a structure that the
legislature.
>> So this
program intercepts
money that would otherwise have gone
to the general fund
and you set up a statutory
formula
for the State fire
Marshal to estimate
how much that formula
uh would cost to
implement for the fire fire
departments. And
he does that at the beginning of the fiscal
year,
what's happening is they're
coming back and then any
amounts that come in above
that according to the
bill you all passed should
then be transferred to the
general fund.
Some of the calculations
for the fire protection
fund do include a
transfer to another
program called the Fire Protection
Grant Fund, which is a
nonreverting
fund.
So by waiting until,
by setting the initial
distribution and then changing
it at the end of the year
in order to
then take the excess
proceeds that came in, that
would otherwise go to the general
fund. They are then
transferring that money to
the fire protection grant
fund contrary to law.
Hence my
objection.
The other issue
is doing this at the
very end of the year
does not allow for the
Committee to review
that bar in any
objection before
the close. So it's, it's into
effect no matter what
any bar that's submitted in the
last 10 days of the,
of the fiscal
year. And that's the concern of the
analyst is that we
weren't notified. We are notified
in May and I
indicated that we May object
to that because we had
before. But the
official notice of
what gets processed through the
system, uh
didn't get to us and we
didn't see it in the system until the
last day of the, the fiscal
year. So that was the other
concern we've had.
It doesn't have anything to do with
support for
our local fire
departments. It
has to do with that. You're the
appropriating body
and you're the body that sets
up the statutory framework
to make those decisions which
you can change in future
Legislation if you so
desired. That's
why I objected
to the bars to discuss
this issue. Um
There's no action on the part of the Committee
that's necessary because
the bar has already gone into
effect.
>> So,
Charles, you can set
the rate as high as you
want,
correct? So,
have you increased that rate over
a three year period or a five year
period?
>> Uh Yes, sir. We can
actually erase the
>> projections. But have
you done that in the past to increase
that rate?
No,
and, and so if you haven't
increased the rate
and you haven't spent the
money and then
you divert it to the grant fund.
That, that's our real objection.
Right. If you need
money or operating money, you can
always increase that rate because it's a
general fund diversion.
Correct. And he
sets a rate,
>> he sets the projection of how
much money they think they're going to get.
Yes.
>> And so if your projection is
low,
that's the problem.
>> Yeah, mis Mr. Chair, if I can,
I, I think that's, yeah, you're absolutely
right. And in the,
we're, we're,
we're kind of uh held back
a little bit from
the formula that we use in
projections is a three year average
over over the last three
years. Uh And which
has been traditionally done and it, it
almost is always going
to be wrong uh
because what we've seen is
projections increase.
And so it, the projection
that we use when we go to
the Session and talk about what
we want to budget
is, is never going, it's
almost always going to be less
than. Um
And so that's, that's
the reason why we end
up uh short
every year. And so
if, if we've got the, the
freedom to
change that projection
without using that three year
average, um
it uh it would allow
us to ensure that the
money that comes into that fund
is utilized for what its intended
purpose is.
Um But there's risk
in it as well. And
So, um
you know, what, what I would, what I would
think is that we've got to have a conversation
about how the
structure in that statute
is today so that we can
ensure that those funds are being
utilized for what they're
collected for
Scott
>> Mister, Chair Members of the Committee.
Yes. And so I think again,
going back to similarly
what was discussed in 2022
it's not that the LSC
doesn't want to support local fire
departments, but it's that during the debate
of Senate Bill 256 or
what ended up being laws 21
chapter 125
the bill as it was originally
making it through,
you know, didn't have this additional
provision about reversions
to the general fund for the Senate
Tax Business and Transportation
Committee added that
language back in saying
that any additional
funds beyond the projected
revenue should revert
to the general fund at the end of the fiscal
year. And that was an explicit
decision that was then made by
the Senate and the house, they voted on
it, they approved it and
this kind of
sidesteps that provision at
the end of the year every
year.
>> Questions from Committee
Members, Senator
Woods.
>> So the only way to
change
is to change the
statute, the
only way that
would be quote
legal would
be change the statute
and say the actual
instead of the
estimated
is that right? Is
that the
procedure
>> that would be, that would be one
policy option. That's
correct.
>> The, the question I've got
are the funds,
uh, the fire
protection
grant
fund,
is there an excessive
balance in that
fund
that we're
worried
about?
>> That did not factor into the equation
because of the,
um,
the transfer in our
view violated statute.
So whether the fire
protection grant fund,
uh, needs more money or
not, was not part of the,
the
analysis
>> like
>> represent Senator
Rodriguez. >> Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. Good morning to
everyone.
And Charles, please correct
me if I'm wrong here. But
it seems like we have three
parts here that perhaps
the legislature needs to
work on to help
our fire departments make sure that
we don't have any unintended
consequences by
the mere fact that we have
language in the law
that May be triggering a
lot of these problems.
But number one would be that
we have change
the three year
average somehow
so that you don't have
that small amount to deal
with. It can be a bigger
average or less or
whatever just to get the
accom to get your amounts
accomplished. Number two
would be to set a threshold
by which if I
understand my notes here, by
which revenues cannot go
below a certain
amount. Um,
before other things are triggered,
for example, to ensure that
at all times you have what
you need for the fire
departments. Um
And then number three would
be that,
you know, if I understand this correctly,
the excess that we're talking about
would be because of a statutory
provision we have would go
into the general
fund and not stay
with the, with the
department. But
you know, that seems to be
very much bordering
on what we do
in areas. For
example, we call it reverting
language. You know, if
you, if you don't use the
funds, which in
this case could be like in
excess of, if you
don't use the funds, they can
revert back to the general fund
unless we have language
in the statute that says that they
are not reverting
um nonreverting language
that it stays within the
department. And
so,
you know, it seems to me
that there's
at least three
options here to correct
the problem because for the last three
years, we keep
doing this and I appreciate
the staff catching this
and re respecting,
recognizing that the appropriating
body is the legislature.
Um um,
so I do very much
appreciate that, but I think that we
all have a responsibility
to work together to ensure that
we can get this done so
that you don't have to be coming every
year for the same, the
same problem.
So, um that's what
I would suggest and
primarily Mr. Chairman,
uh perhaps, and I, I
won't be here next year for the
Session to work on any
language uh for
you. But I can tell you that the first
thing I would do would
be to work with
legislators on the reverting
language. I
think that would probably
take care of some of it. And
again, with thresholds if we
have to thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I hope I didn't confuse anyone too
much. Thanks,
>> Representative >> Garcia.
Uh Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for the presentation.
Good to see you General
Secretary as
always.
Uh
Mr. Secretary
General,
you mentioned that uh
you just
the last three years,
you kind of estimated is what's
going to be three
the last past three years, right? Am
I correct?
Uh under
when you do that, you
know, we know inflation is
terrible.
So at what percentage
of inflation are you
adjusting yourself
to?
You know, because I talked to the chief earlier
and he said something about
30%
inflation rate and
I think inflation rate is more like
65%.
Is that a problem
when you ask for
money, you're not asking
for enough of it. Is that the
problem >> Mr.
Chair Representative Garcia?
Thank you. I think that um
and, and if I misunderstood this,
if, if someone can correct me
because it's there was
a quick education on some of
this stuff since, uh, since
this is the first time I've dealt with this. But
as I understand that the,
the three year average is based
on actuals that have come in the last
three years, which gives
us what we project for the following
year. And so
in a, in a, in a
system where right now
they're climbing over three
years, uh,
inevitably the,
the three from three years
ago is going to bring down
what we project. And if we're
stuck in that formula,
uh and, and we
don't have additional language that
allows for adjustment,
we're always, we're, we're not
gonna ever have the opportunity
to spend the amount
of money that comes in
because we don't know what the
final balance will be.
Frankly, the 12 million,
some of the 12 million that we, we
did the bar for is
money that actually won't hit the
accounts uh
into sometime
in, in August or
October. And
so we're always trying to
catch up to it. Um
Either we've got to look at a
different formula or
we've got to have the flexibility
uh to, to have the
money available for what,
what it was collected for
or the intent of the collection was
for because we're, we're not,
it's not a matter of,
we just didn't spend the
money, we, we didn't have
an opportunity to. Um
And, and more importantly, it's not, we're
not the ones spending it really, it's
dispersing it out
into the
communities where those firefighters
need that support.
>> Thank you for that madam
Chairman. But on that formula, do
you have inflation
included into that or they don't
allow you that? Because you
know, uh Mr.
Chairman, I talked to the chief
earlier and I asked him
what it would cost to equip
one person, one
firefighter with all
the stuff that they need. And he gave
me some number of, would you
talk on that touch on that
a little bit, sir?
>> Mr. Chair representative
is to equip one firefighter.
Now, you're looking about
$23,000
you gotta buy their P pe
their jacket
pants, boots,
gloves, helmet and
SCB A. So you're
looking about 23,000 per
firefighter and
not including the Wildland
year that they also need. So that'll
probably bring it up another
3000.
>> Thank you for that. Uh,
uh, fire Marshal and
Mr. Chairman. You know what
I'm getting at is
what these people are getting funded
and what is costing to do a business
anymore. It's just
not something's wrong
with the system because,
you know, and I'm looking at
not your bigger fire
departments, you know, your
rural fire departments are gonna hurt
even worse than what they
are. And we need to
kind of, I don't know how you can address it
because I'm not gonna be here next year
either. But
people that are gonna be here
next year really need to take a
look at this because,
you know, we're funding
people to do
stuff and then we're taking the money away
from them. And, you know,
and Mr.
Chairman
and, uh,
whoever are there,
you receive your money on July
1st, right. Uh,
what you're allotted
every year that
at the end of the physical year, am I
correct?
When do you actually get the
money,
>> Mister Chair Representative
July 1st,
>> actually get the fund on
July 1st or on,
on your hand, you can start
spending it. >> We
are, we are, is if I, as I understand
it correctly. And again, you
know, the, the the financial experts
can, can correct me
if I'm wrong. We get,
we get in our budget, the
ability to spend the amount of
money that we went
to the legislature and you appropriated
as projections
from the three year average.
We, we, we don't
know what actually is going to come
in and it gets collected from that fund
because it gets collected throughout the
year. Um And
so we, we
don't, we don't know
we July 1st what got
appropriated in, in the
last Session we have
access to right now.
That's the projection.
Uh And that the appropriation
was based on or the appropriation is based
on that projection. What
we don't know is what's going to actually
come in over the course of the
year. And that
typically in the last few years
has been more
than what was
appropriated based
on the projection. I
hope that makes sense.
>> I thank you for that. In other
words, you can't, you can't really go out
there and do the shopping and because
you don't know what you're gonna get. Am
I correct? So that,
that backs everything
up a little bit
on, on trying to spend
the money and you
have a, what a year to spend it.
Am I correct,
>> Mr. Chair
Representative Garcia? That is
correct. >> Uh,
thank you for that, uh, general
because the, the problem is
if, uh, we give you
$12 million and you
don't, you weren't expecting
that you can't spend
it. So it kind
of reverts back to the, the
system and, uh, what
I'm getting at, you know, I'm just
worried about,
like I said earlier,
uh, look at the fires and, and,
uh, in Rio do so
just everything is going
wrong that can go wrong. It
is going wrong and,
and our local fire departments,
our rural departments are gonna struggle
one day and we're gonna be saying we should
have taken care of this,
you know, uh, I hope,
I wish I could have been here next year,
but I can't, but that's not
here nor there. But,
uh, this Committee
needs to really look
at what needs to
be done
to help
rural New Mexico. Thank
you, Mr.
Chairman.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Uh, this question
May be for
Director Salif.
Um,
if the
bar has already
happened,
can the legislative finance
Committee still
object.
>> Statue gives
authority to
object to a
bar
to the LFC
director and the
LFC director can just
object and then during the
course of the fiscal
year that will
cause the bar to
stay in abeyance
for 30 days or
until the LFC
Committee holds
a hearing to review
it. It
cannot, that objection
cannot stop the bar from
going into effect if DF
approves
it or
even if the Committee
votes to support
the
objection.
And then the rest of
the law is that if there is a bar
submitted at the end of the
fiscal year, within 10 days,
it automatically goes into
effect. So you're relying
on D fa
to be the gatekeeper
for
approving bars or
not and you're relying on the
LFC staff
to flag
and usually that
flagging during the
course of the fiscal year of something
that we don't think is following the
law is enough
to have a hearing, is enough to have
meetings at the staff level with
DFA and typically a
withdrawal or let's do it the right
way
and avoid the need for
the Committee to have a hearing
process. >> Thank
you. Thank you, Mister Chair. Thank
you.
Um Question
to uh the fire
Marshal and Secretary.
Um Have you
brought language
um to the legislature
um in the 23
or 24 Session to
address
this
>> mister Chair? No, we have
not. >> And
mister Chair, why have you
not? If you've known that this is an
issue. >> Uh,
ma'am, uh really
uh with everything else that we have going on, I'll
be honest with you. I did not
really think about it, uh,
but it's something that we will work
on this year and see
if we can get some language
changed on
the statute. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chair and thank
you. I, you
know, while I
can appreciate that
and while I
have, you know,
utmost respect
for the
department and
the service of
our first
responders,
I also have two
Children.
And
this,
the fact that
this is the second time that this
has happened and we were
told that it would not happen again.
And there is the third time, my
apologies and
that there hasn't been a
fix when there
is one
that is a problem for me.
Another problem for me,
Mr. Chair
Secretary is
that the legislature
is a coequal branch
of government.
And you know,
I am very
concerned that there is not
appropriate recourse
for the legislature
to demonstrate
that it is a coequal
branch. I don't
think that this administration
has always treated
the legislature as a
coequal branch of government.
And I think that's a problem.
I think it perpetuates
issues like
this. Um
And so,
you know, I, I do think it's
important to reiterate
that nobody is questioning
the
importance of
firefighting,
providing the resources and
the tools that our firefighters
need. However, this is a
totally inappropriate
way to do it in
my opinion.
Um Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you,
Representative de
La Cruz.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
for my own notification.
What is the ask
today
or is there an ask
or is this just
informative
>> Mr. Chair, Ros
de Cruz, we, we were
asked to come uh
to address the objection.
II, I don't think there's an ask
although um
if, if, if I can,
this is a great opportunity to say
you're uh you know,
Representative Dixon, you're absolutely
right. Um
I, I probably should have known
a little more about this uh
prior to this, this
issue happening, there won't
be 1/4 time. Uh
We'll, we'll figure out how
to address it if we can address it in
language or projections
uh to get the funding where it's supposed
to go uh within
law, we'll do that if
we need to address the statute and
you're willing to support us doing
that. We're glad to do
that. Um But
I, I don't, we, we don't have an
ask. I think it's really is, is a
response to the objection
of the bar. >> Thank
you, Mr. Chairman and continuing with my
edification.
Uh So if I'm
understanding and perhaps this
is a question for director
Sali,
we, the State
has established a
fund for this
particular activity
and the fund
can be
accessed based on a
three year projection. Is that
correct,
>> Mr. Chairman, a three year average
of how much revenue they
had
was generated by this
tax revenue.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If,
if the, the
revenue that's generated
is in excess
uh to
the projection,
there is not a mechanism
for, for accessing those funds.
Is that correct?
>> That's correct. Because by
statute it's supposed to transfer
to the general fund. This
is a, a program
that's intercepting a revenue
stream that
says anything in excess
of that amount that comes
in, goes to the general fund. >> So
mister Chairman, so there is no
mechanism for a carryover,
correct? Thank
you. I think I understand it
seems that while
it May seem a little time-consuming
for, for you all at this
point, I don't see any
way around uh
amending the Legislation.
Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Um Senator
>> Sheer.
Um Thank you Mr.
Chair.
So
first let me just back up a
little bit and make sure that I clearly
understand the difference
between
the fire protection
fund and the fire protection grant
fund. What
the
briefly, what is, what's the
difference,
>> Mr. Chair Senators,
the Fire Protection fund is where
the money goes when it's intercepted
from taxed
revenue, a certain
amount based on the projection that's
submitted to us during the budget making
process is
appropriated into the fire protection
grant fund, which
is a nonreverting fund
that allows
Homeland and the State Fire Marshal's
office to make these grants
to municipalities. And you can
see a list of those grants
that were made in Fy 24
starting
on,
I think page
10 of your packet.
But if you look on page three of your
packet, the statute is very clear
about the fire protection
fund, which is the intercepting
fund. That's the language
that was added by Senate Tax
Business and Transportation
that specified
that anything in excess of the
projection submitted during the budget
making process is to
revert to the general fund.
And I think to get back a little bit
to Representative De La Cruz's
question, the ask isn't necessarily
that we don't mov'e the
money. It's just give
the legislature enough time to review
it until the statutory
changes put in place.
>> So Mr. Chair, as
you know, we have issues with bars
all the time where it appears that
uh agencies are
changing
uh the legislative
intent and
for this to happen at the last
day. Wow,
I don't want to change the legislative
intent. It
is,
it appears that we are
intentionally trying
to, to circumvent
everything and, and that
bothers me.
So
two questions here.
One is what
now? Well,
it appears that what now
is too
bad
legislature loses
and there's nothing we can ever do
about it.
And uh
we had to find a way to do something about
that. So a recommendation
May be
that in
law there's no
bars prior to
45 days
uh or
yeah, 45 days from
the end of the year, you can't have a bar
period
and that gives us at least the time
to look at it and, and object
if we want to. But I also
think that we ought to object to a lot more of
these bars because they clearly
are moving funds from
one, from
one purpose to another
purpose that, that
we as the,
as the appropriating body have
done.
Um,
that
yes,
they need to come up with the right
answer uh
during the budget process.
Uh I know that the right answer is
always variable but it's always
variable with everybody.
So this isn't, uh,
isn't
special,
but maybe we consider
changing the statute to
say no
prior to 45
days. Just can't
do it.
>> Senator, she, this
is not a misuse of money. The
money is used correctly. There's no
question about that. It's getting out,
it's going to where it's gonna be,
but the GSD Secretary
is here. Do we remember the $150
million hold that was created last
year because of
violation of the statute,
right? You're now
diverting money
and non
budgeted money
that takes
it out of legislative intent.
And then it's
not a matter of the same thing with
GST. It wasn't a matter of
misuse, right? It was
a matter of the statute
and following the statute, but
this one is more of a
diversion
and a cost that you don't
calculate on your
balance sheet because we don't
see it.
And 22 was
notified, they were notified
23 they were notified
24. They
didn't, they did it the
last minute, same three
exact day scenarios. So,
whoever that staffer is
pretty much knows the
system that
if they do it within the last 10
days that
they can get away with
it
and, and that becomes
a violation of the statute.
And that's the issue we're here
at today. It's not
misuse of money. It's not
misappropriating money. It's
not anything other
than the statute clearly doesn't
allow them to do that.
That's why last year I was so hard
on bars. Right.
And, and we see this and, and
when we give agencies bar
authority,
this is what happens and,
and it's,
it would be a totally different scenario
if they were misusing the money. But there's no
misuse here. This
is statute says
this and you're doing
this Gs D's issue
was statute says you
have to do this and they
didn't do it. And
so when the statute
violates, we have
no in the tenay
timeline, we have
no choice in LLC. But to
place the objection, that's what it
requires us to do. And
that's what Charles did was follow the
statute.
So there's a lot of fixes that we can
do, but we got to get
the number. But if, if you
say we're going to appropriate
$100 million this
agency and
then at the last minute, they borrow
over that amount, then
they're using the
legislative authority
to expend money that they
weren't appropriated.
>> So Mr. Chair, it's
just
maybe it wasn't a violation
of law, but somebody's certainly
gaming the system and they're gaming the
system to the detriment
of the system, but also
all of the taxpayers in the
system and,
and somebody should be held accountable
for that, especially if you do it three
times in a row
could be an accident, >> but it
was a violation of law.
It was a violation of the
statute.
First time you May get a mistake,
second time, you May get scolded,
but third time, you know what you're doing.
And so they knew what they were doing, whoever
did it. >> So, so
who do we hold accountable
and
how?
So I,
>> again, >> that's all Mr.
Chair >> Representative Smaller
next.
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank
you all for being here today. Uh
General. Thank you for your work
and response and
across the board
and particularly
uh in uh
Riodosa
Lincoln areas.
Um Mr.
Chair, uh
I guess I would
echo the comments that were
raised by Rosem
Dickson uh
General, appreciate very
much the very clear follow up and
feedback from your end, which is that
there will be a
statutory uh
fix
proposed. I think
we're very clear that this has
already gone through
um that there needs to be
a statutory fix and
in particularly in this area,
there's sort of no disagreement
from the Committee. I
do want to sort
of uh
I guess, connect a
little bit to what was just raised
by Senator Scherer.
The while
I'm uncertain about
sort of
uh
what level of
change is needed to the
underlying bar statute.
I, I think this really
does sort of underline
the need for us to revisit
that as a legislature
because
um the
intent here is
to work collaboratively.
I feel like we're
doing a better and better
job as the
LFC with
our analysts, our director, our
staff being good partners
with the Executive
when that partnership is
rejected and rejected,
particularly in ways
that
um
sort of remove
the, the coequal branch
as my colleague, the vice
Chair Dixon mentioned,
then it's time for
us to revisit
the underlying statute
that allows for this to
happen. We have
to uh
maintain.
And, and so I would ask
perhaps um
director Sali, can
we put sort of
a, a little bit of a dive
on the underlying bar,
the, the the statute
that specifies these
timelines
also sort of that
tenay uh automatic
timeline. Again, I'm not
advocating it right now for
any specific change,
but there's clearly at least
a need to revisit this
and to, to ask a
question. Is
this serving us uh
as well as it can
at this time,
I'll turn the mic
>> certainly, we can
take a look
at the bar statutes. We're doing
that for the Accountability
and Government Act right now
in partnership with
D FA when it
comes to this program,
an alternative to
an intercept
is
just let the money flow into the
general fund and give them a general
fund appropriation and you make
the determination about how much
you want to support
um those
entities. Um
or we
come back with some other
ways to
um for you to that. I
mean, you made a determination about
how much you wanted to appropriate
for that purpose. And it was
a three year average of the
prior three years
and this bar is
usurping that decision
that you made. And that's why I
objected. >> I
think we, the, the
there's clear support for
the objection based upon the
statute that was passed.
There seems like thank you,
Director Lee Mr. Chair.
I think collaborative in general
would ask from your end sort
of that we dive in on
all options. We know we
want to fix this or
to update and to address it.
We dive in all options
director and Chair
Munoz. I think
the addressing
the underlying bar
statute a lot
as part of our work
on uh
updating the Government
Accountability Act. Sounds great
to me. Um
And yeah, that
sounds great. Thank you very
much.
>> Let's see. Representative
Sarana,
>> thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think
all mine have been asked all my
questions and I guess
one thing I would say is
um maybe it's training,
maybe we just need, you know,
as a body, we sit in LFC
and I'm I'm new. So there's so many
things I don't know. But if
maybe if we train better and, and
get them to understand exactly what's going
wrong then in
supporting them, we
could get things done the right way.
Um I think that's part of it
is. So let us know we're here
for you guys. So make
sure we're here to help you and,
and ask. All right,
I know, you know, this is scary
but you can, you'll, you'll be
ok.
But thank you Mr.
Chairman, >> Representative
Armstrong.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize
for missing part of the,
the um the
presentation. I was visiting
with the mayor of Magdalena.
But, um,
can you explain to me and, and
possibly Charles, uh,
the fire protection
fund
and, and the, the grant
fund, where does that money come
from?
Again?
>> It comes from premium
taxes on homeowners
insurance. One
of the, and it's an intercept
for that revenue that would otherwise
go into the general fund.
You all as a body said,
take three years
of what came in
and average that for the,
the prior three years. And that's
how much money can go
out through this program to
fire departments across the
State, as well as
you set aside a
portion of that, that
can go into what's called the fire
protection grant fund,
which provides just
that grants for equipment and,
and things of that nature for
local fire departments.
That's a nonreverting
fund
from the, the revenue
stream. That's
the intercept. Um
You said anything that comes
in above that three year average
should be transferred to the
general fund. That's what the
statute said. And this bar
is taking
recalculating that and
transferring all of the money instead
of to the general fund into the fire
protection grant fund at
the end of the fiscal year.
>> Ok. Thank you. II I
thought I remembered
that because Mr.
Chairman, I remember running a
bill to take
all of that money and put it in the grant
fund because
that's what the tax
was originally
for,
is to support
local
firefighters
and, and the things that, that
happen in the area.
So, um I,
I know my bill
never passed, it, passed
another entity
with uh with some provisions
in it. But,
you know, originally that's what
this tax was meant for.
And so I think,
um I
think they're only,
uh I know that that
what has happened is, is
not palatable
to the Majority of us.
But I also want everyone
to remember what the original
intent
of that was
four. And
so, um I,
I, you know, everyone
does it. We, we
know that we know the
rules, let's play
by the rules.
Uh And if you
can,
if there's a, an area where you
can go in and you're still playing by
the rules, then you're gonna go in
there. So we need
to make it really clear that
we want to support
you. We need to make it really
clear of what,
why was this
tax put in
place and
remember that
and think
about
the
four pages
of entities that it's
helping.
And uh speaking from
rural frontier, New
Mexico,
I know this helps my district
and my area a lot.
So, II I
know you all want to play by the
rules. We just need to
make clear what the rules are and if we
need to change the rules and we
need to let them know and that's
fine. But please remember
what this fund was created
for, to begin with.
And um
it used to all
go into the
general fund and very,
very little
went into the grant.
So it's only a change in the last
few years that
they received more. So
I just want people to remember
why we created it in the first
place. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Thank you >> uh
represent
pedigree.
>> Thank you Chairman and
thank you all for standing
up here and
uh uh taking the
fire line holding the
fire.
Um
So to be clear,
Chairman, we have
$12.2
million that didn't
get spent
and they want to revert
to the to
the different fund. Is that
correct,
>> Mr. Chair Representative
Pettigrew, there's, there's
$12
million that
wasn't in the appropriated
the appropriation based on the
projection. It's above
that uh
that was transferred into the,
into the fire grant fund so
that we can distribute them.
Um We, it isn't
that we didn't spend
it. Is that we didn't get the opportunity
to spend it because it was above that
amount
if that makes
sense.
>> No, it does
not.
>> Good. >> It might
help to think of these two
funds
regardless of their similar names,
is the intercept fund
and the grant fund
and the intercept fund is the
one that's supposed to revert
anything in excess of
the projected amount
that we budget during
HP two.
What this $12.2
million was,
was in
excess of what was appropriated.
So there was additional revenue
that came in during the course
of fy 24
that otherwise would have reverted to the
general fund.
But, you know,
in a, in a mov'e that was a
little contrary to
59 A dash
53-5 which
is what talks about
appropriations from
the intercept
fund. It
got moved to a
to the grant fund which
does not revert.
And that was, you know, again, the,
the third time in three years for reasons
that we've got over a few
times.
>> So Chairman, if,
if, if I'm getting this
right,
there's a certain amount of tax that
goes into this intercept
fund.
And so
with respect to that,
how often are you getting
those revenue
statements
from,
um,
our tax department
to tell you that. So
was, was this $12.2
million? I mean,
so if we go July
July 1st to June
30th 2023
to 2024
at the end of, of
June at the end of the month of June,
sometime in the month of July,
you get your revenue estimate
right of how much
is coming in. So
after the first quarter,
you would know if
you're already in excess of what
you're, what you're supposed to be
receiving for the first quarter.
Would that be fair?
Is that a fair statement?
Charles?
So then
we would know again in the second
quarter, then we would know again in
the third quarter and we would
only be dealing with one
quarter
adjustment
if we were taking care of this
on a quarter by quarter basis.
Does that sound
fair?
So we, why wait until
the last minute
Chairman,
these are your money to >> come
in?
Yeah,
not all of them. It's,
it's a fair, it's Mr.
Chair representative pedigree, it's a
fair question. Um
And so
some of it should
be addressed in very
much in the manner in which you,
you are asking.
We don't know what comes into the last
quarter until
after the quarter's
over that
that can't be addressed
by, by that, right?
And so, um
we, we were aware
of some of the revenue that was
over the projection
late, which is why the bar
came in late.
Um Again,
it, if there's, there's
other ways that
we can I think address
this, uh
so that we're not in the
same space next
year and, and
like I've said before, we, we
won't be here. I think it
just really becomes a matter
of, I
think to, to representative Armstrong's
point is, is, is
the intent to, to take
all those funds that are collected
for that purpose
and distribute them out in the
fire departments.
Do we want to set an
amount as
director
suggested
and then appropriate
it? I, I think,
you know, you're the body that
decides that.
Um and, and
I think the, the point is very
fairly made, which is
we need to figure out how we adhere
to that um,
that legislative
intent and follow those rules
and it, it will
um there will not
be another bar at the end
of next June with my
signature on it from
this fund that,
that I'll assure
you
the hope is that we address
in the Session,
a different mechanism
to get those funds
uh where we intended
them to be.
>> Thank you, Chairman. Thank you
General for that.
So
we have the Fire
Protection fund and then we have
the grant fund.
Is there any
separation
in what those two
funds do with
respect to expenditures?
Is there something you
can do in the fire protection
fund that you can't do in the
grant fund? Or is there something
you can do in the grant fund
that you can't do in the fire protection
fund?
Chairman,
>> Mister Chair Representative Petter.
Again, it's just my understanding that
the Fire
Protection fund, the intercept fund
only intercepts the money it does
not make any expenditures except
for the appropriated
transfer to the grant
fund at the beginning of the fiscal
year based on projections.
So the expenditures to local
agencies only come out of the grant
fund. >> Thank
you very much. So, if we
did the quarter by quarter, then it
makes sense when you would
have only have to
deal with the closing
of the last month. Would that be
fair? >> Just, just
to clarify, there's a statutory
formula that the fire Marshal
has to follow, to distribute
money to local fire
departments. Um
basically for operating
costs um
through the fire protection
fund and fire
protection grant fund is
reserved for
equipment.
>> Mr. Chair Representative pedigree.
I think the other, the other part is the
fire grant fund
is distributed by a council.
So they,
there's, there's a larger
body that looks
at the funds that are available
and then, and then uh
works through
applications and distributes
those out. So there's,
there's a little difference in, in that
sense as well about how that money
is distributed.
>> Thank you very much,
Chairman and thank you Charles
for that. Thank you General.
So
with respect to this, this is
strictly fire.
This doesn't deal with first responders.
This doesn't deal with ems,
this strictly deals with
National Guard and fire.
Is that, is that
fair, >> Mr.
Chairman, fire departments?
No A MS
there's a separate fund that you created
for that this past
Session,
but they are first responders.
>> Ok. So,
so I'm just
trying to get a grasp of it
so I can understand.
And uh
Chairman one last
question. So as
I read this letter,
the money was allowed
to go into the grant fund,
correct? Or it was
distributed to the general
fund, >> the
money was diverted to the
grant fund
contrary to the statute.
Hence the
objection.
>> Thank you director. Thank you,
Chairman.
>> It's in Shino. You want to explain the
>> amendment
in,
let me explain it
belongs
>> today.
>> I remember this bill.
Uh you know, I I it came
in as a, there was
no clause and I think for the very
same reason that we had a previous
conversation with our
analyst is that when we divert
money uh that
come into the general fund,
I mean, that's, you know, I
impacts our, our projections
overall and so forth. So the
concern of the Committee at that time
was thing over
that should revert
back to the general fund.
And so that was the, the
reason for putting that amendment
onto the uh
uh to the bill at that
time.
Uh
But, and I think all of us,
you know, clearly understand that there's a tremendous
need in, in in our, in our fire.
And I mean, nothing, you
know, we're all supportive of
this. Uh but
now that we have some data and I'm on
LFC now. So this is kinda
good to, to uh
to get a chance to, to
see, you know, our
actions, you know, what
happened in the Committee. Now, I'll be
able to see. But my
question is
on the, the 33.8
million that were uh
awarded to
the
um projects
under a fiscal year 24
grant awards,
what was the total amount
requested
and for those grants?
And this is
obvious is, is the amount
that's awarded. But what
was the total request
that came
in?
Mr. Chairman and
uh
>> Mr. Chair, Senator Shino, the,
the amount that was requested
was 49 almost $50
million. >> Ok.
So about three quarters
of the projects were funded, about
a third of them were
not roughly
correct. OK. All right.
Yes, I think that just goes to show
that there is a tremendous need. And
I think, uh
knowing what we know now,
um, I hope we can
come up with a solution so that
the money, whatever that amount
is, is able
to go to all these, uh,
uh, fire departments. I
know Majority are in rural area
because, you know, most of our State is
rural and, and I
think that they do. I know
in our area in James,
you know, we have our own tribal,
uh, ems and a
volunteer fire.
But with the amount of traffic
that goes on highway four to the
Vice Caera, to all
that area,
our tribe, you know, is taking care
of a lot of area in the whole corridor
and so forth and, and, and
volunteer fires and so forth.
So I know that they serve
a tremendous uh
amount of people, not
just our own respective communities,
but, you know, people that are traveling
and visitors to our State, so
certainly appreciate
the conversation. I hope we can
uh resolve, you know,
this issue, the next Session so
we can come up with a solution. Appreciate
it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> Thank you. I mean, you
see the problem, right? I,
I don't know who did that for three
years in a row, but if that was my
staff or they might be
sweeping the janitor's closet
for a couple of weeks
and see if they learn their
lesson that, I mean, statute
statute, you
can't
mistakes happen, you
can say don't do
it again. We did that
mistake happened. Again, we said,
don't do it again. And
third times it's the
charm, right?
Um My suggestion to
you is you remember that
we are paying
volunteer firefighters now,
out of that fire
protection fund.
And so all
those rural firefighters represented
Armstrong,
uh, every
rural volunteer
firefighter can now get
paid and it comes
out of the fire protection
fund.
Right. And,
and they'll need equipment
which comes out of the fire protection
grant fund, right?
So there's a balance there that we
need to fix
and, and
so let's work on that
during the next Session.
Uh I appreciate your time. You want to
give us a little quick update on Riodosa.
What I know you
and I know I hear lie's name.
I, I actually do
some federal work for federal
leases and I was down there and your,
your names were popping up. I didn't
see you but
>> Mr. Chair and I'll have,
uh, if, if Ali wants to come up here,
if I mess anything up, she can, I
think the,
um,
so we
are, um, working
really hard from the
State level. Um
I think if you look
at, uh,
where we
were in Hermit's Peak, Calf Canyon
is a comparison and I know the city,
we also started hearing that
because we're, they're getting
a lot of, hey, we're better off than what
they were, but, but it's still not
fast enough. Um,
the agency has
been far more
forward leaning
in getting out into the
community and anticipating
what needs are there.
Uh And so the staff's done an
amazing job
for,
you know, for a $6
million budget
to have uh
the capability to get
out and, and get in the
community. Um
And so we
are uh we are currently working
between D HSE M and all the
State agencies and the guard
on providing as much support
to Rito. So as we can,
um you know, the,
the, the challenging
piece of it as you know has been
that it was a
devastating
very fast
fire. Um
that was followed up by
monsoon rain almost
a few days later.
Um You know, we
hope that after this week, the
projections for rain,
uh we'll, we'll call for
less and then we can start
to get into what long
term recovery looks like
from the perspective
of um getting
people in long term housing
because they're all in temporary
housing right now for
the those that lost uh homes
that were primary homes.
Uh fa just
yesterday, uh approved
direct housing.
And so that will allow
us to start
the piece of
bringing in fa trailers
for those that need them.
Um And
between FA
and I and I think you uh you're
familiar with it, the State,
we're looking at how
do we more
quickly identify a
space to bring those
trailers in so that
we can get people in those long term homes?
And I know the mayor, uh, has
been, um, uh,
has done an admirable
job of demanding,
uh, things get done
very quickly. And
when in my conversation with him
last night I told him
just keep doing it,
keep fighting because
that's what's getting stuff
done. Um, and
then the other piece of it is that we
start to work at, look at what
mitigation looks like when we
get a few months
now as the rain slow down
is what,
what did we see in flooding that
happened this year? Because I
mean, it, it's all been documented
quite well on social media.
How do we start to put
better mitigation strategies
in place for next year's,
you know, spring and summer, monsoon
time. So,
um I, you know,
I, I think uh I think
we're, we're moving along
quite well
although,
you know, II I would
love and are fighting to have
people in homes that they can
rely on, uh,
you know, today and it's
just, it's never gonna be
fast enough, but I don't know if you got
anything to add or if you got any specific
questions about those things because those
are the, those are the really the tough
parts right
now.
>> Ellie. I did hear your name and praise
a lot down there.
II, I was there for a
short time. So just so you know, that they
appreciate you guys and in
your hard work and your names
were saying, yeah, that they're doing a great
job. I met
a new staffer from
Oklahoma. I think he's been
with you three months and so I
had a chat with him real quick.
Adrian was there, Adrian
sat in some meetings and
so it was
good for us.
Representative Small. You had a
question.
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Uh Echo the
praise uh Mr.
Chair. The question.
Um The, I think the
South Fork fire,
the cause has been determined
to be lightning. Is that,
that's right.
OK. That's super good to
know. I do want to
ask, um
I, I know that there were,
it, it seems like there were
some tensions
within the
area and within
the county in
particular, there were some
tensions related.
Uh
well, won't go
into too many of the tensions. I
want to highlight that that's an
issue
and um
particularly
with in
any case
and especially in light of
the South Fork fire being
lightning caused.
Uh This
May be a better question
for State police
but is
sort of that
um front and center
on D HSE M
radar screen
and is the State
uh prepared
and, and sort of integrated
into ensuring that there
is during this very
difficult time and as we
work very hard to
rebuild and
with the resilience and other
things, are we gonna
make sure that
this stays a safe
situation for all
community, me, community
Members, no matter
where they're from, no matter where they
live.
And if you want me to, if
there's questions about that, I can go
into a bit more specifics.
I'd rather not. But if you
>> can't, because I'm, I'm, I'm
not. Absolutely. >> Thank you
Chair. I think there are
tensions as I understand
it and I have garnered from
uh related
between uh Members
of the, there are
some tensions for,
from some
in um
uh sort of riodosa
proper
related to
erroneous
uh
uh assignation
of blame for the South Fork
fire to
uh Members of the mescalero
Apache, sovereign tribal
nation
and resulting
tensions that
within the community.
>> So Mr.
Chair representative a
absolutely. I think that
we, we heard those things
as as they happened. I
don't know, I don't, I don't know
if anyone really caught it. So that
first press conference
we did with the Governor I think
was was day
two.
And um
you know, lower the State
Forest or
mentioned that
there was lightning in the
area. Uh
You know, I
in that first press conference
as we were going through, I think the challenging
piece becomes when you're in
the middle of fighting a fire, it becomes
very difficult to figure out where
the fire started.
Um And, and
it, you know,
uh so there was a lot of
speculation across
social media. I saw him too, lots
of questions about it.
Um I think it's,
it's the, the
tough part becomes trying to figure
out
um you know,
how we stay
patient in
that process
as an investigation
happens onto into
the, you know, the, the cause
and origin of a fire
and then attributing whether there's
criminality to it or
not. Um
And that this particular
fire was just, it was challenging because
we were asking hard
questions
and the vast Majority
of government with the exceptional
law enforcement was oriented
on put
out the fire,
save people's lives.
And then how do we start to
posture into recovery
and to make sure that because we
knew in that 1st 24
hours, we didn't know what the
number of homes were. We
knew there were a lot of
them. Um And
for, for really was a, I think
it ended up being a 17,000 acre
fire about 12,000
in those 1st 24 48
hours, a
significant of homes loss.
I think the vast Majority of those homes
were lost in that 1st 24
hours. And, and
so I, recognizing that
it was a very challenging thing, I
think that for, for
us and, and the lead from the
Governor, uh, and, and
for, for D HSE M
was a,
let's, let's,
let's put off the conversation
about who
caused it and what happened.
Let's focus on saving
lives and getting that fire
out because the rest
will come. And frankly, even
if we focused on that, we
didn't have any answers to
give and it led
to speculation and that always becomes
challenging
>> Mr. Chair and, and
Representative Small, I think it's also good to
point out how closely the,
the two elected
parties are working together.
So the village of Riodosa
and the tribe Mascaro
tribe are, are hand in hand
helping each other. Um
They're, they're putting forward a very
united front um
in order to, uh,
you know, be, be
good partners together. So I
think it's, it's very good to point
that out. Um I do know that I think the
Governor did ask for them
to put out a joint press release
stating a lot of that too. So I think they
are currently working on that.
>> Thank you both very much.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
>> So let me ask you something
because you know,
we're going to special Session and I'll
tell him what's gonna happen.
Um
There was a, the mayor told
us that at, at some
point, somebody issued everybody
a $5000
check.
We don't know who that is.
You know, the O
SI said they made insurance
issue $5000 checks
and payouts towards their
damage, but
they said that that fa
issued or somebody issued a
$5000 check to everybody.
Do you know who that is?
>> So the only one that I'm aware
of, excuse me, Mr. Chair.
Uh The only one that I'm aware
of is O SI that, that
gave the specific five
specific $5000
check. Um Of course, in the
manner that you just mentioned,
um fema is handing out
money. Uh when we
were with them, the end of
last week, we were up to about
$3 million that have been
handed out and are on the streets.
I know that dollar amount has
gone up. Um
So they,
no one is specifically
other than o si handing out
straight $5000
checks. >> So fa
is handing out checks
to individuals
probably specific to their
needs, right? If
your house is still standing, but you don't have
power and you got to get food
and you're in a hotel
and you gotta buy clothes.
And so those are,
and do you have any idea
what the average amount May be
or
>> Mr. Chair? They do
range very much. It's, it's kind
of a formula based off of what you talked
about, what, what you have lost,
what your needs are,
especially if you don't have
anywhere else to go and you do
need additional assistance
with maybe a hotel
room or somewhere to, to
be able to rent. Um but I
can get you, we, we can go back
and get you guys the averages.
>> We just want to verify that we
heard that and then we're
having a discussion and
in, we didn't
remember exactly who said
it and where it was coming from. But
I just wanted to codify that, that
there is that fema
is handing out checks,
>> Mr. Chair. Yes, I I would also
like to point out too that the State
has hired um we have
about six Members of on
staff underneath what we call a disaster
case management team.
That team is down there.
They're intended to help people through the
application process of any
program. So the intention
is to be a one stop shop where
someone will come in and see that person
and say I lost blank
fema helped me with this. But
I still have a gap. I still have
a need. What other resources do
you have for us? And they're
intended to, to start partnering
them with either other federal resources
and maybe other State resources.
Um And their, their sole
intention is to fill up the application
on their behalf. Sit there
with them and talk them through it,
be the ones who guide them and let them
know where in the process that
application is. So if you do
happen to hear
of, of issues or you need
someone to help someone
specifically with an application,
we do have Members of staff that are down
there to help do that. Where are
they located? They are at the
DC which is in the
Hutton facility and then
another one which is in the
Mescalero facility,
they're called Disaster Recovery
Centers and we
have the exact addresses. So
we'll get them written down for you
guys.
OK.
>> Center,
which
>> I got a, a
request from
a insurance
agent and
took him carry
because he said one
of the governor's
health orders
demanded that insurance
companies
pay checks
as you talked
about.
And when the Secretary
of, of
insurance Secretary was,
no, not the insurance
Secretary. The office of the
superintendent of Insurance
was here. I asked
that question
and she said they were all going
to comply. That
State Farm was
objecting, but they
decided to
comply also.
So I'm assuming
it was the people
who had
injured
that those
insurance companies paid
those checks. Now, I
know not everyone
had,
I think you told
me
somewhere about
60%.
I don't remember where 60%
had insurance or 60%
didn't have insurance.
But so
that's a, that's a big
bearable. But
I understand that
the, the
health order
required
those insurance to pay it.
And when I ask
the, the,
the
superintendent,
she says, I'm not gonna ask
them to do anything that their
policy doesn't
say.
So. Evidently the
policy say something
about that.
So they're forcing,
I shouldn't say forcing,
they're requesting
those companies pay that.
And why with your
policy
am I saying that?
Right? Kind of
some way they >> requested,
but then Jake resisted
and so then they make
Jake
unresisting and send
him a love letter.
Uh,
thank you.
I think that explained it pretty well.
Right.
Excuse me. Thank you guys
for your time. We appreciate
it.
>> Ok? Um
We'll go to our next,
uh bar
objections.
It's great to see Mr. Simons.
Uh, who is our
analyst, uh, Secretary
Doucet. Thank you for being
here.
Um Thank
you to you and your team for being
here. Um
Let's go ahead. Uh We'll
go first to Mr.
Simons.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee. So uh
behind uh the
paperwork for the Homeland
Security Bar objection, you
should see additional
paperwork uh
for the bar objection
related to the general services
department. So
the GSD uh
asked for a
$25.5
million bar um
for the employee group health
benefits program at the
end of the fiscal
year. Um
previous, just
to take you back a little
bit back to
fy 20
four's budget making
process. So,
ty typically, what
happens with the employee group
benefits fund is
the legislature had
authorized uh
the agency
to uh
given agency
budget authority to meet
expenditure needs. And the
general expectation of the
legislature was
that the
agency would raise
revenue essentially through
premiums charged
to State agencies,
uh local public bodies
and their employees.
The, the agency would charge those
premiums in amount that was
needed to meet that
revenue. Um
And, and, and balance
both the, the revenue and
expenditure side
of the ledgers.
So, um, if you look
at the second page of the
bullets, I'll just uh point
you real quick to a table we have
here on
um uh revenue
and expenditures from the
employee group health benefits fund
over the last several
years.
So in the first column, you
can see what we call recurring
revenue. Essentially, that's
regular revenue
that the agency receives.
Not just through
uh the
uh the premiums
that they charge uh to State
agencies and other
entities, but also
through uh different
uh revenues,
whether it's interest on,
on income or
some, some rebates they
receive and things
like that. So that's the
recurring revenue side. As you
can also see in the second column,
here, we have a significant
amount of nonrecurring
revenue that's
been dedicated
to this agency for this program
for a, for a couple of
years due uh
due
to the
inability of the agency
to raise sufficient
revenue to meet
expenditures. So,
um a couple of years
ago after
the uh
the legislature approved
a premium rate increase
and provided funding for that rate
increase that was eventually vetoed.
Uh the legislature
decided to not
set the agency's fy
24 budget authority
based on what
they expected to spend,
but based on expected
revenue at current rates
and then provide the agency
with budget adjustment, specific
budget adjustment authority
to increase their
budget in the event that
the agency received
new revenue from
uh premium rate increases
or from a net change
in the number of
employees that were participating
in the fund. So,
um if you look
again back on this table, you can
see, uh for example,
in Fy nine in Fy
20 through Fy
23 you had a
significant
uh uh
shortfall
in the recurring
revenue amounts
um when compared
to the total expenditures of the
fund. And this
is the first um
bar objection
that you're hearing because this is the first
time that agencies
needed a bar to do
it. You've always in the
past set
their expenditure authority
higher than their available
revenue did for
fy 24
was set
revenue based on
revenue. We actually expected them
to see and
um give them authority to
raise uh to do
a budget adjustment request only
in the event of additional
revenue coming into the
fund.
Uh I mentioned before. So
sort of one of the things that that's
been keeping this program
afloat uh is
special appropriations
directly from the general fund.
So, uh
just to
back up a little bit, we're not talking
directly about general fund
revenue here. Uh
The general
fund impact of
total expenditures on this fund
is really only about a
third. So you've got
about a third
allocated to the general fund,
about a third, more or less.
These are very rough numbers.
A third uh for
other State agencies that are
funded by funds other than the
general fund. So federal
funds or other State funds and
then about a third
for local public
bodies.
Um
So the, but over
the past several years, uh
you all have allocated more than
200 million in
general fund appropriations
uh to this program
to uh account
for the fact that those revenues
haven't been sufficient to meet
expenditure needs.
So, going,
going back to the, the specific
bar. One of the
things that we look
at when the agency
submits a budget
adjustment is their
projection of revenue
for the fund. And you
can see that
those projections. I'm sorry, it's
actually it's a
little fuzzy because these are, these
are copies of,
of
images but
beginning on page
18
in your packet. So
this was a revenue
projection provided
to us in
May of 2024
when the agency submitted a
a different
bar saying
we need to budget
additional
revenue
that we've brought
in,
you know, pursuant to, to those
rate increases. So, as you
can see here at that time, the
agency expected to
end uh the
fiscal year with about
$407
million in uh
recurring revenue
uh for,
for the year. That's in addition to
any of the of the special
appropriations that you all
uh provided. And so
ultimately, uh the
bar that was successfully
uh processed, set
the agency's budget authority
at $407
million. If you
turn to the next page, you
can see a revenue
projection that was provided to
us in June.
So uh there
was an, there was an additional
uh revenue
increase uh
that was expected to be
as, as high as
423 million.
However, as you can barely
see in the expense column,
the budget authority requested
by the department was
432 million.
Uh And uh that
would have resulted in a deficit
of uh a
little more, a little more than
$8 million. So
based on the,
the terms of the budget adjustment
authority that you all provided
because we, because that
budget authority requires
additional revenue,
uh There was, and
there wasn't sufficient revenue
to support the
requested budget authority.
Uh We recommended
objection to the
Committee. Um
So with that
brief overview, Mr.
Chair and Members,
I will hand it over to Secretary Doucet
to talk a little bit about
this.
>> Good morning.
Um Good morning,
Chairman, Members of the Legislative
Finance Committee. My name is
Robert. You said I am the
Secretary of General Services
Division.
Uh Today. Also I have with
me, my deputy director, Jennifer
Khan and my A SD director,
Shani Romero. Thank you for
inviting me to respond to the
LFC objections for
the FY 25 Bar
Authority request that we
made. I first have to
start off by saying
um we made a mistake at
GSD, a human
error when we
utilized projections on our
first bar request that
was accepted. And
we received. Uh we
based it not on actual
expenses that we had today.
Um But projections,
this was an error and
the first bar should have been approximately
75 million to pay
actual expenses for the health
benefits myself.
My deputy director and my A
SD director,
when we found the error, we
fixed it, we set
guidelines and card rules
for this not to happen.
So in a nutshell on
that, we should ask instead of the
50.2 that
we asked
uh the
first one, sorry 5
23 24 we should have asked
around 75 million.
In fy 23. GSD
was given budget authority for
approximately 421
million and received 30 million
special supplement to pay
the health benefits
for Fy 24. Gs
D's budget authority was
reduced by approximately
64 million to give
decision maker greater
oversight. This budget
authority reduction did
what it was tended to do and required
us myself
GSD
to ask for a bar for Fy
24 to pay health
benefits
as we increase those revenues
by implementing a 10%
premium increase. Last
year, we needed that additional
authority in order to have
the flexibility, we needed to
pay the medical invoices. We
received
the problem. The bar addressed
was the authority to
exercise the use of the money.
It was not asked for. We
didn't ask for extra money.
Just the authority to use the new
money brought in by these
premium increases
in Fy 24
GSD increased premiums
to the State of New Mexico
customers by 10% for
the full fiscal year and
for the L PB
customers half of the year. In
addition, GSD increased
premiums additional
10% for all
customers. For Fy
25. These
increases have been made to address
the closing gap between revenue and
expenses. So for the last
year and a half that I've been here,
um I've increased
it last year and this
year 10%
each year.
Thanks to the legislator
and the Governor GSD
was allocated additional funds
during the Fy 24
Session to realize
the shortfalls between
revenue and expenses in
Fy 23 as
well to cover the projected gap
between revenue and expenses of
Fy 24. Despite
the 10% increase,
these additional funds have
allowed for fy 24
expenses to be paid in full
without adding to the
fund balance.
Um On a side note
too, as we
know, the new health care authority
started July 1st, my
deputy director myself and
ESD director are still
working on with Secretary
A Miho and she'll probably talk about
that when it's her
time.
So in a nutshell,
we made a mistake
on our projections. It was a human
mistake. We caught it, we
fixed it. We should have asked instead of
about 50 million, 75 million
in the beginning when we came
and asked for the additional 25
million, which was
great. This is what we talked about
last time. I was in front of you who
has the oversight.
It, it worked. Um
You objected to it. Understand
the objections. I was asking
for the authority of the money
that we had to pay for the
bills. So
that's,
that's my part
on this. >> No, that's great.
Thank you very much
Secretary. Uh If
uh
yes, Secretary a
Mijo, we've got you
uh online
and uh if there's
anything that you want to add
before we go to uh
member
questions,
>> she
thank
you.
Change.
Yeah.
Yeah.
>> Yeah. Secretary, we do.
Thank you. We've got the presentation.
Thanks to our staff. For getting that
and we're gonna turn slide.
15.
>> Great.
Yeah,
and carry. Ho hold on one
second. We do. We have
audio,
we don't have audio on the
Webcast. We got a
text,
hold on one second.
Captioned
this to
that.
We
are,
we're, we're hoping to pay
for the special Session with you. Given
us the winning lottery
numbers.
This, I don't think that
all
that's
risk
if I send it to
you.
Are we good
Kelly?
Checking
someone need to
talk?
>> See?
>> Ok.
They can hear you. I don't know if they can hear
you. Uh, we're
just gonna go, go ahead and
carry.
Yes.
And
you.
Go
ahead.
All right, questions
from Committee Members represent chap.
You look like you
got
>> Mr. Chairman, I, I feel
if you've seen where you put the
dice under the red cups
and then they shuffle them around.
That's kind of how I feel about
this. Uh
We
if we, how much have,
do we lack
to be able to pay the
bills in premium
increases? I was told a
couple of years ago, it was about
25%.
We come up
10%.
>> Mr. Chairman Representative, the bills
are being currently paid
>> so the premiums are equal
to the amount that goes
out. >> Mr.
Chairman Representative, not
necessarily, it's not a
linear mathematical
formula. It just depends
on the month, what type
of, what
type of benefits are being used?
Who goes in that month, what
we're collecting?
And
for the 16
months that I've
been here, we've increased it
by 20%.
Um We are trying to catch
up, is it solvent
at this time, Mr. Chairman Representative?
No,
>> so Mr. Chair and
Representative Chatfield, if I can
refer you to page
two of the bullets on
the LFC brief. So
this has several years
of um
revenue and
expenditures out
of the employee
group health benefits fund.
And so if you look
at the recurring
revenue column for Fy 24
through the eighth,
the fiscal year is not yet closed. So
we expect there to be
some, some expenditure and some revenue
coming in and out of that fund.
But if you look at Fy 24
you can see recurring revenue
of uh at that
time, about 399
million and
total expenditure of
463 million.
So that's a gap of about
$64 million.
Um And for Fy
24 and again, that number
is not final. If you
look at the Fy 323
line, uh which is
there, you had total revenue
of 378
million and expenditures
of about 476
million. So that was a, that
was nearly $100 million
deficit. So,
uh again, since that fy
23 there has been a
10% premium rate
increase. Uh
There's uh on
the for the next pay
period for State employees,
there is a another 10%
premium rate increase.
Uh So um that's
above the
medical cost trend, so
that should moderate some of
those costs. But
at the same time, the
fund is uh
needing to close the
gap. We are still
are still
continuing to see medical
inflation. You can actually see that on
page four in
um the
uh the report card
um portion
of that. Um
So uh average
change in fy
23 was only about 3%.
That's relatively moderate. So
those costs have not been
increasing um
as significantly as some
other plans. Uh
But I think
the secret, the, the health care
authority Secretary who I think has
something to add on this
um is is looking for
additional cost increases,
but just for you all to
keep in mind uh as
you begin preparing agency
budgets for the coming
fiscal year, there probably will
also need to be continued
rate increases to support
this fund.
>> So Mr.
Chairman, my
real question is
this,
if we know
that the
premiums are not
enough to pay
the bills
every year, we give this
agency a budget.
Why don't we, it's
illegal to have
a a fund
that's upside down.
Why are we not
putting enough money
in the budget to pay the
bills? And
then, I mean, you have two
aspects to it. One, you
have to raise the premiums which
we've been doing apparently
gradually.
Number two, we have to budget
enough money to pay it,
but instead of budgeting
enough money, we always
make this man come in
here and, and uh
tell us that he doesn't have enough
money that we go through a whole another
process to uh
do a special
appropriation. When
we knew in the beginning of the
year there wasn't enough.
So that is
the part of the dice
shuffling that. I don't
understand why. If we
know it's not enough, why
don't we make it
enough? >> Um,
you know, Secretary, how we see
your hand up. So just one
second, if you remember
correctly representing Chatfield,
the reason we got in this position
because
statutorily just
like this last stuff we
heard they did
not raise premiums under the
statute under the health care
and $100 million that goes
to cities, counties,
everybody.
We picked up all
that including one guy from
the B Weevil Cotton
Association.
You always hangs out there in my
head and, and
so that's
the reason you got in this situation
because statutory increases
weren't made. Now, you gotta play
catch up. You don't have
three years worth of increases. The
average was 6%.
That's 18%.
This year is 10%
that's 28% and you got to
play catch up throughout
that time. I think you did a 10
or 15%
increase.
And >> Mr. Chairman, we did
a 10% last
year for the
State employees and LP
in the LP B's local public
bodies. They didn't do it for
half of the year and then
starting July 1st.
Everybody in the plan
is a, a 10% Mr.
Chairman and >> 10%
is still not enough. It's
still a shortfall. We needed to get
to 25% but that's
sticker shock and an employee
and a cost. And so
we're gonna continue to be in
this situation.
We need to speaking to
that, we need
to
agree with the cities and
counties that this is not
retroactive so we can get out
of that lawsuit that's in
limbo right now. So
I need you to figure that out. Get
rid of that
thing.
You know, you're still in a holding pattern
in that suit. I mean, the city, the cities
and the counties, >> Mr.
Chairman, I'll check into that. The
last of my knowledge is that we
were out, the Judge didn't
make a decision, but
I will double check and I'll get back with
you this week.
>> So represent Chat villages.
Catch up. Math.
We we can't ever get caught
up, right? And if premium
increases 10%
in the next year, we're gonna
be lagging behind every single
year.
>> So Mr. Chairman,
the
uh fund
is, is essentially
it's funded
by the
revenues
from,
from the premiums.
It does not, it's not
funded out of the
out of the general fund. Is
that, I mean, is it
funded directly from the
premiums or is it funded
from the general fund? >> It
depends on the,
the the entity,
a State employee and I'll
use the Secretary,
his health care premium that
he gets out of. There is a certain
portion that's paid by him,
certain is paid by the
State. I don't know the
percentages and it's
different in every scenario.
So what happened is no
increases.
So there was no premium
increases off the board. So we were
picking up the whole
thing.
And so each and if
you had State health
insurance and you were, or
you might have retiree health, that's
different. But uh,
State
insurance,
you're, you pay a portion,
the State pays a portion of the health
care costs. Right.
But when there is no increases,
your, your payment
was exactly the same for
three years. And so
when you get to three years later,
an 18% increase that
needed cut up on top of the
10% that needed to
happen is what
makes us in the deficit
going forward. So >> Mr.
Chair, my thought is this,
the agency is going
to put that in their budget
and their budget is
the, no, I'm talking about
the agency that has the the
worker that is getting the health
care right? They're gonna put
that in their in their
annual budget and so
that budget comes to us.
And so then we pay it through the budget.
We either pay it when
we write the
budget for the agency
and their workers or else we pay
it uh when we're
playing catch up, I, I wish
we would just get it
over with and I, and
I would hope that
the our
State and local
governments are
never again faced with a bill
like like we had this one
time. Thank you, Mr.
Chair,
>> Mr. Chair.
Just we have
three tiers on our health care
system. The top tier, the
higher paid employees
State pays 60 percent.
The employee pays 40 percent
the mid-tier. It's a
70% the State
pays and
30% in the lower
tier, the State pays
80 percent and the employees
pays 20
percent just for
information. >> Thank
you,
>> Chairman. Uh Thank
you and thank you for the
presentation.
Chairman. Help me get
to where we're at with this
because this, I wasn't here
when this, these
decisions were made.
But this sounds very similar
to the paid family medical leave
Act that we had this
last year where the fir
and the information
was very crystal clear. We do
this in 26 or
27. The program's
gonna be defunct. We're gonna
have to change the way we fund
it. And it sounds like
this is a proven system that
has proven out to be
not working.
And so
help me where,
where I'm wrong. And I'm
that comparison,
>> the system worked
until the
Executive did not follow the
statute. And
so I'm gonna
pick a year in
20 I'm just picking a
year, nothing
meaningful in one
year. The Executive says we're not
increasing premium
on health
care and premium on,
on employees,
right? When
the Executive made that deer
termination and you weren't the
Secretary then.
And the Secretary says, ok,
I'm gonna listen to the
Executive and
NOREM premium
increases were incurred
and then the next year don't
increase premiums. And then the
next year don't increase premiums
and then we're
squawking and I think I was squawking
that one day. There's gonna be a day of
reckoning and the day of reckoning was
100 and 10 million to 100 and
30 million.
And so it worked
until the Executive
violated the statute and said
we're not increasing
premiums.
Secretary
Mio.
>> Ok,
for
you.
Mm,
>> thank you madam Secretary. Any
other
questions?
Tender
Woods,
>> I'm reading the,
uh, the information
here on the Health care
Authority
and it
says
on
page
oh, they're not numbered. The
pages aren't numbered.
They are five. So it's
four.
There's not a number on four, but there's a
number on five. So
page four
and it says the health
care authority will now
serve 50%
of New
Mexicans.
So why I am
concerned
about what happened
with the State
employee
insurance
is that we're
not taking care
of balancing this
boat
and we're talking
about
taking on
50%
of the State
of New Mexico
and run an insurance program
for them.
Now, am I wrong
about what I'm seeing
here, Mr. Chair
or, or Mr.
Secretary or,
or madam
Secretary
>> Center, 50% of
New Mexico is on Medicaid
right now. And
so that's just adapting
those into the health care
authority, those that
50%.
>> So we're not worrying
about the
premiums for that
50%. on
Medicaid.
Yeah, so we're
but it, it talks
like that
we're expecting to take
on more in that
position.
Is that right or
wrong? You have
NASA Secretary
madam
Secretary.
So from what I
understand
your your
program that we
have been calling
the
employees.
Let's
see,
Employee Benefit
Bureau,
we're gonna operate it separate
than the
Medicaid
section. We're
gonna have it all in-house
under your
authority, but
we're gonna operate it
completely separate and
sold
from
the
uh
well, like the from the
health department, the development
disability supports
division, the vision
of health improvement.
So we're all this is
gonna, we're still gonna
be collecting
premiums from our State
employees and our local
uh service
and local people,
local
government
and we're going to operate it
separate.
Give, give me the rundown
on that one more time or how
are you gonna combine all
this to
a to a cheaper program
for the State
employees?
How, how is that gonna
work?
Yes.
Well, on page
six,
you're talking about
health benefits, health
coverage including
medical dental vis
prescriptions
for 450
to 550
million a year
life insurance fund,
6.1 million per
year. Stay
well, health centers, 2
million a year
employees assisted program
offerings. Three
and confidential.
2473,
65 service
for half a
million a year
voluntary
benefits.
Um member
then pays 100
percent.
So
we're paying
how much now
and how much of that is
federal money, I guess is the
question, but
it's too complicated
for me to see right
now. So I'm
not gonna ask any more
questions.
Uh madam
Chair, madam Secretary,
I thank you for your
comments,
Mr. Secretary. Thank you
for your comments.
Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you. Thank
you very much for that. Do I have anyone
Representative Mr. Chair
small? Did you have anything to add
or ask before we go
on?
>> Thank you. Just
ask briefly. It seems
like we're moving
closer to
getting this
right sized. Is
that
fair? And Mr. Simonds,
I'd ask your your opinion there
as
well.
>> Uh So um
Mr. Chair
and Members.
So I, I do
think the the gap is
certainly narrower than
it was in fiscal year
2023. There
were um
the the premium rate increases
have helped.
Uh I think there's a great deal
of, of hope as
Secretary Omi
um says that some of
the work that she is doing
around uh contracting
in particular can
uh help uh
moderate cost
increases. Um
I do believe there is
more of a need
for uh premium
rates. If you look, for
example, at the difference
between um
premium rates for public
school teachers
and uh State
employees. Uh there,
there's the rates
for the public school insurance authority
for, for
similar plans, but their differences
are significantly higher. And
so that tells you a little
bit about
um how
the uh the
premium rates for this
program got. So below
what the actual costs
are. Thank
you
>> madam Chair and Mr.
Chairman. Yes, the
gap is getting smaller
and I do appreciate all the help of
this Committee and the elected officials
in the governor's office and
the other secretaries I've worked with
for the last year and a
half. I
know it's frustrating sometimes but
we are on the path
forward.
>> Ok? Uh Thank
you. Thank you madam
Chair.
>> Thank you. Um
I don't have anyone on my
list and so I want
to say thank you to, of course,
our staff also
and uh cabinet Secretary,
deputy, all your staff for all
the work you do. I think this
was just uh informational
has been indicated before.
So um we're gonna
mov'e on, but thank you once
again,
we're safe. We're done. I
want to thank them Mr.
Chairman through Mr. Chairman. I want to
thank the, the staff
also very much profusely
for all their work. They do
all the time. >> And
thank you.
I think we're good. Everybody's
adjourned. We'll see you
tomorrow.
>> Yes, I know. Don't
>> forget Representative
Herndon.
>> Usually we say see
you next month and now it's
tomorrow
>> we adjourn sunny night.
