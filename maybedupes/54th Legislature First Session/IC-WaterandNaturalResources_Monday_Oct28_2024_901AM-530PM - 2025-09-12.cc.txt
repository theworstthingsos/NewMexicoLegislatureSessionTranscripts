Um My
exar weed me. We also have
Tom and Day
and Leo Gonzalez
team
today.
>> Thank you.
Um
Our vice Chair of this Committee,
center list of panic is
traveling did not be here
today. I have asked
for sorry now to help you
Chair. Uh
I I would like to
thank the
staff. We, we had
a big delay but um
you can see them working feverishly
to get us up and running.
I also want to share that.
Uh this
uh this meeting
has been a lot of work coming
together. Uh And we
originally work at
a, at the first
meeting of the
Water National Services
Committee
and there were the
fires and I can
remember talking to Vice
Chair Stannis
and she was telling me they had to,
we had to reschedule, we had to mov'e the
meeting and I can
tell there, you know, as soon as those
fires are out,
they're gonna want
visitors.
And um
soon as the fires were out,
then the rains came
and then it clearly it was, it
was just too much uh at that
time. So what we did
was we swapped the two of the
meetings, we were supposed to be in
Corrales uh
today and we did that
first. And so we came, we
still got a chance to come down.
Uh and it is a beautiful place
and I'm happy to be
here. I also
share that uh,
scheduling for the
agenda has been tough and I'd like
to thank Sarah
are a lot of hard work that she did
on that. Uh, in
terms of,
you know, it might be a little, a
little harder because of
the location. It's a little
more remote than Santa Fe
are out there. Um,
it's a tough time of year.
A lot of us have
campaigns to
attend to, you know, we have an election
and I think it's eight days.
Um and, you know,
other, other things
coming up. So
we have had a hard time scheduling
people and I have tried
to have panels
where we have a
different points of view
or, and I haven't
always been able to get those
different points of view.
And
one thing that we face today
is we have Zoom,
uh which is the
blessing and a curse.
Uh I do play
of Zoom meetings and
it's great to be able to do a
meeting without having to
travel.
Um That being said we
do these committees in
person and
it's much better for the
Committee and for the presentation
to have people in the room.
Uh So when I have
uh advocates or
uh State employees
who
one testified, but we
only do so by
Zoom.
Um It's just not
as effective and
it's frustrating me that we can't
get people out
at the committees and that's
certainly been the case
today.
Um But we do still have a
good agenda. Uh
I think this
is our energy focus
meeting. And
first we're actually
have
in a presentation from
Roia.
Um You
come on
that.
Our first presenter is
uh President
Thoria of the Mealer
Pache Tribe President.
Um Thank you for having
us and thank you for coming this
morning.
>> Good morning. It's
good to see you all here and it's
good to get started finally.
So, thank you.
So, I'm very honored to welcome
you on behalf of the Mescalero
Apache tribe and express
our deep appreciation for
your commitment to understanding
the things that are important to us
here. Mescalero
Apache tribe has a rich
and resilient history in this
region. Our people
roam freely freely
for hundreds of years across
Texas, Chihuahua,
New Mexico,
Arizona, and Sonora.
These are all lands that were
once our
life and our home
today. Three subtribes,
the mesle on the pan and
Shaa comprise our
community. And
together we reside on a
reservation of over
463,000
acres. These
encompass the sacred counts
of Sierra Blanca,
Guadalupe mountains to the south,
three sisters to the
west and the
Yuro heat of
outside of the White
Sands missile range.
All of these represent the
four directions of our
universe. These
mountains have profound
meaning for us and have
guided our least traditions
and way of life for for
many many years,
the end of the mountain Gods is one
of our proudest achievements.
It embodies the tribe's
commitment to economic
development and our
dedication to sharing our
culture with our visitors that
come here through
this renowned resort. We have
created a sustainable
source of revenue that
funds essential governmental
services, supports
community programs
and provides meaningful
employment for not
just our own people but
people in the surrounding
communities.
It allows us also to
showcase our heritage
and the beauty of our homelands of
thousands of guests each
year.
Looking to the future. We
are committed to sustainability
and stewardship of our lands
and resources
and we have begun developing
a carbon free energy
initiative to help
ensure a cleaner and more
resilient
future.
This actually started
quite a few years ago.
The Mescalero Apache
tribe has conducted
several feasibility
assessments. We
have looked into the
possibility of wind
energy, solar
energy as well
as biomass energy.
And that was would be
using waste marber
operations.
When we looked at biomass,
we also evaluated
the possibility of a
pellet manufacturing
plant, wooden ship
boilers for heating
and cooling and
biomass
generation.
And and quite a few years
ago, we actually
started
another part of this
transition working towards a
carbon free future.
We developed a carbon
credit project
and that will be to
help us
conduct sustainable
forestry operations into the
future.
Our plans
for carbon
redevelopment are currently
in its early stages, but
with the valued partnership
of tri-state and the Old
Harrow County Electric
Cooperatives, we aim to build
an energy foundation
that reflects our respect
of land and our responsibility
to future generations.
As we learn more about our
tribe, we look forward to building
a foundation of understanding
and collaboration.
I just want to thank you for your
support and allowing us
to share glams. We are
and our vision for the future
and we are honored to host you
and are grateful for your
dedication to the community.
We will you. So
I didn't cut it a little short
just so we're not going way over
on time. So I wanted
to thank you though for the
opportunity.
Thank you very much. >> Thank
you, President. Leave here on
our next panel >> too.
>> So don't go
anywhere.
So our our next panel is
wildfire. In fact,
to questions about
the fire I
would hold off on that and
then to mov'e
forward. That would be
great.
Ok, so let's uh get
the next panel up to the
table,
please.
So welcome everyone.
Um We
typically
go in the order
that you appear on the agenda. So
present if you're ready
to talk about
wildfire.
Um please
take,
>> well, I'm a
silver lining kind of
person and
despite whatever goes
on and whatever happens,
I always try to keep a positive
attitude because
life is hard enough as it
is without
having a
positive attitude,
it makes it even harder.
So that, that's one
of the things I've, I've tried
to stay positive
throughout different presentations
and I, as I've said several
times here and I'll say it
again in the midst
of opportunity in the
midst
of
ok,
in the midst of crisis
lies great opportunity.
And that's the direction I'm coming
from for me,
Guerro, the pandemic
we had a few years ago, made
us keenly aware of the need
to diversify our revenue
streams. We
cannot wholly depend on
tourism as needs to
elevate our community.
And we are currently considering
development of solar
energy to produce
costs and strengthen our
infrastructure. But
one of the things we remember
here in Meteo is
that our logging, the
logging of our forest and
the thinning that we've done
is what has allowed our people
and our homes to survive the
fires we've experienced
over the past 30 plus
years.
One of the most contentious,
threatened, endangered species
we have in the Sacramento
Mountains is the Mexicans spotted
owl. The listing
of the owl essentially shut
down logging industry and
Cloudcroft, which
is located in Otero
County.
We have since bound
over the years as we've
been, you know, doing a
lot. We have been doing
a lot of thinning and a lot of
longing along our southern
boundary because of
the concerns for the disease
and insects that have been building up
in the forest, especially
on that southern side of the Lincoln
National
Forest.
We are finding that a large
number of young owls are moving
from the cloud cro area
along to the southern part of our
reservation into
recently logged
areas. I'll say that
again. They are moving
into thin open
recently logged
areas. We
need to find a way to work
with federal agencies such
as the US Forest Service
and the US Fish and
Wildlife Service
so we can protect our
communities while also
providing jobs and revenue
that will help our
thrive.
We do need to keep
managing the forest
every which way we can
so we can protect these communities
that are here in these mountains.
It's important for our,
our survival and,
and our continued
development on
letting the other people go ahead to
speak that.
>> Thank you very much. Uh
except we have
be
Crawford
>> fake steri.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
commissioners. Uh Thank you
so much for coming.
Uh just a quick update. We do
have a fire on the Bluetooth
scar this morning that they're
of their body. I just spoke to
JW
mccoy. We do have a helicopter
coming in from Arizona.
It's gonna attack that. It's in
an area that's pretty
access but,
well, hard. Yes, we're still
recovering from the data
station and I appreciate you
folks coming here. Many of you. I've
seen four
uh you've been in and
to the area and see the
devastation. So we
all know what that's about. It's
affecting our economics
around the community, not to start
business, but it's also
affected the building in
Harvard, G
RT. Uh just
in the 2.5 months,
we're down about $2
million G
RT report that we
just received last month
or this month. A few days ago. We
were
perplexed because it was
higher than it was the year
before the year before was a
regular,
there was a one time anomaly
that uh one of our groceries
had a different code.
So we were refunded about
it and that,
so with that was, we were
only down
$600,000
in revenue. So you can see the
trend that we're heading into
and we appreciate all the
considerations that
the uh the
legislators are looking at for
recovery. We still have a
lot of folks that do not have
homes, we short homes
before, you know, we had several
projects that we've worked
on over the last 56
years that are
starting, you know, we're
able to get a 9% tax
credit housing where
we're gonna be starting on the 72
apartment complex.
We do have a 10 unit
modular facility
that should be done by
end of December.
We were very excited
about that. They good quality
homes, but
sadly, that's not gonna be near
enough to, well
losing so many of our
folks that work
in facilities like the ones that
you have here that you're set
in today or restaurant or
business.
Uh All of those things,
you know, those folks don't
have. And
we are really
thankful for the C ID,
the construction industry, vision
and State and overworking.
So we in
love with us here, understanding
the situation with
some of our mobile home park
that were deemed
unsafe, uh
that we were gonna have to mov'e out
nearly 200 people,
no place for those books
to go. And
so we appreciate the way that
they were able to work with us,
you know, local electricians and
PNM. I do have something good to
say about PNM.
They showed up, they did a
good job uh
to help us maintain that. So
it's good that we're working together.
And that's one of the things
are so happy to have
my, one of our commissioners
here, President of the
to work together
regionally, to endure the
issues that we have
to start thinking more of
broader terms instead of
just be, it's about
me. And so we
appreciate all the things that you can
do and that
you have, uh,
force management.
She touched on it. You'll hear more
about it. It's a big thing here.
We understand that we should
manage our forests,
uh, that we won't have the time
of fires that we've had with the
intensity and it
doesn't matter if you have
defensible space. I'll tell you
that right now, the village has
long andens space.
We tighten that
criteria every year
about tightening. I mean, we
expand our here
so many more feet away from
your home, surrounding
your home with gravel or
dirt, 3 to 5
ft out leading your
trees. Uh, getting
rid of a lot of the
underbrush that before we
put in their work, it's
for beauty for whatever
we learn that we can't
have.
So working with
force management inside the
village. But when you have these hot
fires that are jumping from
ground to ground in
these wind f
uh, it doesn't matter
what your home because
sometimes some of the best
defendant homes,
hard homes that we had in the community
were wiped out.
All of that helps
if we could start moving
out into the National
for working with our federal
partners, State partners
to get that the,
the mindset moving
in that direction.
It's just as the President
said, come,
the is
a rapture and it doesn't
like flying through a bunch of trees
no more than you like running.
You can't see the pre,
so what we have seen is
in areas developed
areas that dials.
So if we can be smarter
and not just work the car
on all of these things, I think together
we can make a lot. Seven
car Maing is an interesting
topic for me.
You know, I'm, I'm really not sold on.
I mean, I know we have people that
love our electric cars, but
it's pretty strenuous
when they're driving throughout the
county. Um
You know, to be able to get from point
A to point B with the running
heater, right?
So I know that we need to
mov'e into that area all
about moving
forward being, uh you
know, better stewards of the environment
that we have clean air and
clean water. All of those things
need to work hand in hand
and mov'e in a progressive
pace that we can all land.
But we at the
village in the city of
rural sedans, we have the
join use board that
operates the wastewater treatment
plant that we're I'm
happy to say after many
years of investigation,
feasibility studies,
we are starting our solo
project. So
we're very happy about
that. And so that
is gonna be starting this
month. Uh
Thank you. We were
able to get a 0.01%
interest loan that we'll be able to
pay back the savings
that we're gonna experience because
as I said, we did multiple
feasibility studies on how
this will actually work
technology from when
I was started on the council
12 years ago or
maybe even longer than
that.
It just wasn't there the
expanse, but the
improvements that have been made
in solar. I am becoming
a fan of those things.
We have looked at a biomass
plan. It's hard to
believe that the feasibility
study said that we did have
enough PS
slash
wood to support
that. And so
I think that those things can be looked
at and if we work recently
on those things that we can
also be better stewards
of helping thin and
dispose of rather than just
putting it in.
So, the Village Road also,
we're working together. You'll see
some improvements as you
drive. If you're driving
back out north at uh
Alto
Lake, the
affectionately known as the
duck pond is being
cleaned. Thank you
and our cys and
we're working together with to
get that cleaned out because it
did its job to help protect
our water source, which it was out to
lake D
pond filled up, kept
it all the slash where we were able to
keep it clean as possible.
And I know that uh Representative
Zell was here, several of the
others during the floods that
they were instrumental in keeping
eyes on because it was all hands
on deck and that
and so so many of you showed
up, uh, with your
eyes on it, make phone calls and
help to sell tremendous.
So it is a big group
effort and we thank you
for all the things that you've done for
the things that you
so. Thank you very much
and welcome to Lincoln
County
and
thank >> you very much
pleasure.
Thank you Mr. Chair
and thank you,
distinguished
legislator.
Uh I'm not representing the
commission today, the
land commissioner district.
By time
I am representing
the Sierra Baca
Regional Task
Force recovery
and economic
development.
Um This is a, this
is a, a group of
leaders. In fact, everybody
here with the exception
of, of a lady that
is a member of that task.
Many others including
uh stakeholders such
as businesses
and, and
local leaders
are part of that. Over
a period of eight
weeks, we've
met gotten
reports from DH
SCM which are very happy
with their engagement
in that process.
This is the third Committee
that we've actually started
on. We tender to talk to
you about
uh what we have
suggested
on things going
forward. These
are initiatives
that we believe
if they are funded and
supported at your level and
above, we'll turn
this region.
Remember I said Sierra
Blanco region
and that includes the Mescalero
tribe, obviously
includes Lakes County
includes the downs,
includes the village and
all the municipalities
around and even of Tarrell
County. In some sense,
this, this is
a an endeavor to look
at the interdependence
of the various
problems and solutions
that we have
identified.
Here's an example
if the race crack
and rich is gonna talk
about that or
it's not up and running,
then that affects not only the
whole State in
terms of revenue
and horse racing, but
it also affects
the end of the mountain gods
because you go to the race
track, you leave the
race track and let go at the
end and the end
therefore, is
part of that connection.
Obviously, the
village is
critically tied
to that, that
situation as well.
So, so we see
the family being
engaged completely
with the economic
uh recovery
effort and obviously
the ups and downs of what
we've been experiencing. Uh
Here later, here's a
case at the point that
about 14 to
1500
residences that
destroyed either through
fires and
floods over
this time
just last week.
I think this is correct. Uh
We had to,
we lost 300 homes
because they were condemned by
flooding.
This is unbelievable.
This is our workforce.
These people don't have
homes,
they, they,
they can, those that have
insurance can't be bill
because we can't get
insurance,
think of that.
So the read the the
whole real estate market
goes down,
the, the idea
that this money just stays
or goes away and comes
back, you know, that
isn't how it works. It
works through
a series into
relationships that I
want to encourage you
to encourage a
Legislation. One
forward. Here's some
specific examples that
I'll try to be
brief.
We're trying to encourage
smart logging. What
does that mean? It's not the old way of
clear cutting, smart
logging is great in the
tree in accordance
with the ecology, it's
present and the
best practices
that are known
wildfire barrier
creation. Obviously
having a
fire safe
community which I know the
village has worked on.
It's important but it's
not enough.
And then what do you do
with that, that
product, that
wonderful product that you cut
and cover? Well, you
need a so you need,
you need the ability to tell
you that that product
and turn it into something
economically
which then generates jobs.
Reven and,
and actually causes
our economy to
not be just a one
horse
deal.
Other things
uh the sawmill that
we talked about the least
be revitalized
at industry. Help down
in the mesal area, tribe
repair the weirdos
of the operation.
Remember this
was a man who
made disaster.
I'm talking about,
I'm talking about
arson.
I'm talking about the
disbandment of our
force
permitted and actually
supported the
devastating fires
that, that we had,
that devastation
resulted in horrific
burn scars that are
all up near
uh the headwaters when we
get the water from
the kennel for the
village, the Hondo
now.
But when you have a burns garden,
you don't percolate
water. What
out precipitated
whether it's snowpack
rain or anything
else, it just runs
off, it runs
down to the river,
it does a
river and ends
up in the Hondo river
and then in PCOS pa in
Texas,
take us remember
goes to Texas.
So that's an in a relationship
too. You don't manage the
forest, we don't
manage water
and the high desert waters are
critical,
critical say
problem
and then the cost to try to
get back while we're
experiencing that we've
lost well
over $100
million of a
of, of
assessed value in
homes. You
know,
what does that mean?
Revenue school
suffering? Right?
Um
People can't get insurance
because of that, that loss.
So you can't be billed. Even
if you get your money from
your previous
insurance,
you can't, can't get a mortgage
and to be built, you can't
get newer.
When we talk about
this divisible
phase around urban
communities, wildfire
service interface,
the proper management
of of the
forest
end up having all
kinds of good things that
attack
insurance companies realize
that the fires
will be less
intense,
they can be stopped, they can be
filed
effectively.
And that means that maybe
they're not a risk that that
can't be taken
off. It means that
insurance can go back. It means
mortgages can be made. It
means people can have
homes to live
in thriving
beauty. Once again
have
there's a lot of things uh
that I wanted to talk about,
but I realize my
time is rather
free because of our late
start. But but we're
gonna pass out
um by
mail to all of
you list of about
10 initiatives
and they, they've included things
I've already talked about but
of affordable housing
development needs to be more
because we just lost
300. I just told you
that
the restoration
of the Hondo Valley
is seus
all that stuff
that even
even though raised track
actually kept very much
of that from
impacting
of communities
and watersheds
further to the east,
it didn't do the whole
thing. So these
are ses that have been there some
well over 100 and 50
years, our entirety
fair
support resource
both in
both for the community,
but also it's kind of a
national church here in New
Mexico.
Uh support for
small business and
employment
stabilization.
We actually have some of you May
have heard of the Lincoln County Community
Foundation 501,
see-through
done, done the
Lord
in helping out our
families
who lost their homes
in terms of need
bei
short term
assistance.
But they, they
don't have enough
money to
actually help out with businesses
that we losing.
You can go up and down
and around Lincoln County, but
particularly uh
in the downs and in the village
where a lot of uh
businesses are struggling,
they've had to lay off people
and see the owners
themselves that are are, are
running because
I can support to
pay
for
the the amount
of tourism that we
have is down.
Some businesses, I think
uh 50 to 80%
loss in revenue or some
that's devastated
business.
So what we've done
is some Members of
the of the community have
gone together, put
together what they
call as a business recovery
fund
and that fund is underneath
the Lincoln County Community
Foundation.
What that allows us to
do is to actually
get government
money to go
into the
Community
Foundation
and they can further
distribute it
to the business recovery
fund. You're catching
how this works.
And that is a fund
that is put
together people
who are going to be
request
for assistance to
get us through where
we hope by next year,
be back in the game.
And I I feel
COMT
and then, and then
uh this is very
important um
a regional
version of responder
training sentiment.
So you, you May or
May not know that, you
know, even
though we lost all those
homes, we
saved far more.
And it was our volunteer
fire departments along
with the Risa
fire department, Darrell's
fire department and many
from communities
from your, your uh
your locales that
said help to
us. We
are very proud of the
volunteer fire departments
and the fire departments
who are full time a
here, but we need a trading
center in this
part.
Why is that important when
you're fighting fires and structured
fires, you have to have
specialized training
that it's
annualized that
improves your certification.
It helps us out with
insurance. It
allows a community
again to feel
safer and improve
to the outside world that we are
just that. So I
wanted to bring that up to your
attention.
Uh Finally, uh
ski
Apache.
Um The State is
actually very good. Thanks for
the thanks for the good offices
of uh Harland and
others
to actually make some of
what I will call
intermediate repairs
in the ski run
rail.
He on the road
and less of circumstances,
it's a, it's kind of a
tricky. I don't
know if you've ever driven it.
Um, they close it down
in the wintertime at about
seven 16
that when it gets dark, right?
It's treacherous
and it's difficult to,
to use uh,
any kind of snow and
vision and it's
limited. We
think that a tram system
such as uh
in Albuquerque and Sandy
Ire
is, is something that can
really help out
the broader community, not
just ski
patching, but really
help it. Turns
it into a, a
365
day. Uh Even
you don't have no
uh opportunity
for visitors like
to hike and
buy
to, to use that
area up there
and it becomes far more
valuable for
invasion. So
those are some things I wanted
to talk about. You were also
handed out uh uh
a little
handout and
this is a, don't
expect you to look at it.
Um I would ask at some
point you do,
but it's from a man
called uh his name is
Mavi.
And um if
you look through it, you'll see a
series of pictures
that for about 100
years, a difference
in the time that they will
take
the first set kind of
a at, at the end of the 18
hundreds, early 19
hundreds. And then about 100
years later, he took a series
of pictures
that
were taken from the
exact closely
uh exact same
spot the original.
And, and when you look at
those two, the old,
the new, you'll see
that the old pictures
show a very different
picture. The one that
we are overgrown,
that's not the natural
State of the
for
and then that
caused these
disasters that will
continue to grow on
Mexico.
So I asked,
please take a look at that,
educate yourself what
really is natural
to the environment
and, and unless you
don't have people at all
around, you can't
just depend on
these massive
wildfires to
do something different. That's
not how it works. That's not how
exciting.
Thank you very much, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you. >> Our next
step. We have Ricky
>> Ball.
Good morning, Mr., Chair Members of
the Committee. Thank you guys
for taking your time.
I know we've been
traveling, traveling a lot
here lately, taking care of a
lot of different issues for them to
stay and
we really appreciate it. But I
think that the common
denominator that you
here, by the way, I am the
general manager, middle
Senator
is that this community
has come together, this
whole, the
task force was created
to look after the well being
of the whole of the entire
area. Not
just one is not
just one with what was
happening with Tity
and all. And I
thank the common denominator
that you all hearings that we
need your assistance and the
assistance for.
Uh we're all sitting
here watching our friends
and our neighbors
while business
watching our
world.
Um they're
homeless and
there's numerous things that are
happening, happening around
here. We need your support
on and in which
you gotta have the asses
to go on.
Um I think the President
put this is
way the, but the
devastation it's
ending
here as
creating relationships
that go on.
Um your media
imagination
travel to Acom.
Uh The racetrack started
here in 1946.
Racetrack has a
hal far-reaching
effect within the
State uh
from the reading industry
to sell your troubles
to
be.
Um, but we're just
one aspect
what's happening, that needs
to be done.
Area. I've got to
thank each one of the panel
Members up here today
for the work that they look
forward and
not just, you know, every
other day, it's every
hour, every minute,
every day
to get
into
seven, get it
back
and, but we're running
out of town
and we need
support
how many twos
Js
and this community
of the Astros to all our
together, we become,
we're looking at the stars,
but we know that we got to be
realistic what our
kids. I
just, I
obesity you a lot
during Session
and I will
be able to come right now
and drive in that
area. But it seems
like every time I live
here I go
and it's
got and
PTST,
it's, it's, it's
been something that I
don't wish, you know,
but we need you.
Yes,
I
>> thank you. And our last
panelist's
responsible.
>> Good morning, Mr., Chair Members of the
Committee Uh
Thank you for having me here
today. I
am. I want to thank you
all to, for your efforts that you
have made in holding us. I'm
gonna be talking about the
electricals or
distribution cooperatives in
general this morning.
Um As you know, we are
impacted by these, we
have been in the past few
years, uh the
last largely
for
us and, and I want to
thank you for all of the help that
you provided
us on that. As you know,
these electrical
cooperatives are nonprofit
power and we are
owned by the communities that
we serve. We
have 16
of electric cooperatives
across the State of New Mexico
covering the 80%.
Um And we have another
three that cross over
from Arizona and
Texas, the
co ops. I just wanted to
give you an update on what they've been
working on uh in these
rural communities. They have been
working to expand
and accelerate their efforts
on wild wired mitigation
and working within their communities
to do that. They've
also been pursuing
funding that can
help with the
assist with infrastructure
um protection grid
hardening. And
we've also been working on
vegetation management,
um vegetation management.
You May or May not know the
cost of increased
dramatically for us over
the last several years,
we've also been working on
forming partnerships with the
State, with State
forestry and with
BLM to maximize
our efforts to mini mitigate
uh these wildfires
and trying to determine
how we can work more
collaboratively to do
that. We've been
formalizing our wildfire
mitigation plans. We've had
them for years. Uh We
have been documenting those
formally, however, to make
sure that all of our
maintenance plans and all of
our efforts are documented
for um
anyone to see
and we have been working
to continuously
improve emergency management
and restoration efforts
afterwards. Although
the wives do a wonderful job
of that already, they're always
looking for ways to improve
that.
Um We have also
been working on community
outreach
and education
around our electric
cooperatives and
how we manage wildfire
medication
and we're going to continue to
improve in that area as
well. Some of the grid
gardening that we've been working on
is to replace our wooden
poles with steel
pools. We've been working
on expanding vegetation
management and just
recently working to
determine how we can become
more a partner
in the community wildfire
in planning
efforts. I
also wanted to make you aware
of some efforts that have been going
on, especially across the western
states on
Legislation.
We have the same concerns
while we have our homeowners who
are losing insurance,
um
We at the co-operative
levels are going through
some of the same issues.
Um It is concerning
across the country, the
impacts that these wildfires
are having. I've been working
with my western colleagues
um to work on
how we can come up
with especially
uh wildfire
liability caps.
As you all know,
like I said earlier, we
are owned by our communities
and by our Members, we are a
nonprofit. What
would happen in a
case of liability.
We could potentially
bankrupt and
cooperatives, depending
on what that liability
is. As far as insurance
is concerned, it's been getting
harder and harder
to maintain uh
reinsurers
to ensure these
cooperatives across the
country. This isn't
just happening here. We have
900 cooperatives
cooperatives across the
country in the US.
We serve about
52%
of the country
nationally.
Um Our concern now
is that insurance
that used to cost us,
you know, 100 and
$20,000
for maybe 20 million
uh in liability is
now costing 2
million. And for
some of these cooperatives who May
only have 1500
customers, as you
can imagine, we are
unable to sustain that.
So these are issues that we're having
across the country. We are
looking at Legislation,
potentially reliability
cap. We want to
be part of this ongoing
collaborative effort to ensure
that we are part of solving
a problem. That's not just
for our homeowners
that we're concerned about our
communities, those who
continue to lose
housing and they can't
rebuild because of
the same issue. We
could run into the same issues
for our electric walkways
and if we don't exist
who will serve those
communities when it comes to
electricity. So
I ask for your continued support
as you continue to support us.
Now Um And
to help us all in solving
the issues that we have here
in New Mexico. Thank
you for letting me speak today.
Thanks.
>> Thank you all for
your presentations.
Um
It's good to hear about the recovery
efforts you guys
inter lives.
I'm sure the legislature
would be interested in
helping
some way that we
can going
to the Committee first upgraded version of
Scott.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman
question.
Has any
study
then conducted
to terminal
but a sustainable
forest and management
logging,
timber processing
operation
would look like in the
region
and in the
as
the
economic benefits
and jobs
that might result from
that
activity.
>> Representative spot. I want
to turn that
question or the answer
to a Madden President.
She really is the in
this.
>> We have never done a
regional study and that's
something we do need to
do.
I
we we do have to get
back to looking
at the
national
Forests
as part of this
plan, not
just looking at
mescalero because
we ourselves
have the last Lincoln National
Forest to the north and
south. And
so I, I think
we need to be able to meet
with the National for
the Lincoln National for
us and start
considering the idea
of having annual allowable
cuts. We still
have that on the reservation.
We do not have currently
a sawmill to accomplish
this. But
one of the things when we
had done the biomass
cogeneration
feasibility study,
we needed more wood than
what comes of the
reservation. We
did approach the Lincoln
back. I think
2004,
2005,
they did a capability
assessment. And at that
time, they had determined
that the
existing
amounts that they are making
available is all they can make
available. And I think that was
like around 3 to 4
million board feet per
year. But I do
know when
the
Sacramento district, the
southern part of the Lincoln
National Forest.
When, when I started
working for vi a forestry
in 1985
we went
into the Sacramento
District. Look at
logging there. They had
highly cable logging
and it was my understanding
that their annual allowable
cut was like 30,000,004
ft per year.
These trees without
being cut,
that's what's making it so
dense here. That's
why we're having a hard time
controlling the fires in these
areas. The
in addition, you know,
regardless of whether people
believe in climate change or
not, we are seeing
hotter temperature in the
summertime,
longer lengths of
summertime and
that's also allowing
insects to breed
longer during the season.
We have had problems
even in mescalero
with the logging we have done
in the mid nineties,
we had a barf
epidemic. Those
bark beetles are still out
there. They are still
building up. We have
things like bruise and
budworm that's also building
up. All kinds of
defoliator insects are
building up. So we
need to nip this in the bud.
Now, we need to
have our National
Forest also
participating in this thinning
and logging
program.
>> Oh, thank
you, madam,
President Mr. Chairman.
One last
question. He
said that uh
30 million
or, or 3 to 4
million
board or
made available,
which was not another
product
to sustain
an ongoing
operation.
Do you know how many million
board feet are out
there in
total and
would be available for these
activities?
>> I don't have current
data, but
at the time when we had done
the feasibility assessment
with Lincoln, I
believe they were projecting
that their biological
growth was 15
million more feet per
year.
And, and even then
the the that cut
that they used to have was
30 million board feet.
So they even then they
weren't capturing the whole thing,
but we would be in a whole lot
better condition that we were
making more effort in
that
direction.
>> And who's making the
decision to limit
the amount of 10
available
>> the US forest service
and, and it's
deferring to the
environmental groups
outside of this
region that are
pushing the owl.
I mean,
we are still
even on the reservation, we
still have to abide by
us fish and wildlife service
rules. We do
have a Mexican spotted
owl management plan.
So when we encounter it,
we do manage for it.
But one of the big differences
is we do not set aside a
critical habitat.
So these are areas that
might suit the owl, but
they're not necessarily
in those areas. I
think if the Lincoln
could do away with that
piece of the
recovery plan,
setting aside
potential habitat
when there's no owls. I I
think that's a bit of over hill
to tell you the truth. They
are breeding and doing
very Well down there
on >> our land,
um Mr. Chairman Madam
President of Way Art, somebody
say that the
managed areas
receding
repopulation
face. >> Yes.
And, and, and I
didn't mention that. And
also earlier,
Mayor Crawford had
mentioned that they
are moving in,
you know, they, they,
most of the population
was on that southern end of
the forest
as we started
logging in order to
protect ourselves from
possible wildfires
coming from the south.
We, we have been
hitting it hard for at least
the last 10 to
15 years along that
southern boundary.
They're moving in on
our side into these
locked areas.
So the idea that they
have to have these really dense
conditions, I think
is
it needs to be looked at
more.
We have opened
up some of
our, we have a
lot of research on our
reservation. We would
not allow maps to be given
out, but we did
have a person
from the Rocky Mountain Research
Station that did
compare and contrast
as far as l the hours are
managed and so forth.
And, and
it shows that
those owls have a lot
more resiliency
than people realize.
I think they are
be found in more open
areas. Our
surveyor, he just
retired this, this year
after he did our, our surveys.
He got punished in August.
He has surveyed
in the Carlsbad caverns
area on the Guadalupe National
Park and they
have them even in those
cliffs along
there. So saying that
they have to have this
forest. I think it's
not
correct.
>> Ok. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Thank you and
President of the.
>> Thank you. And next will be represented
blue
H
>> Thank you madam Chair.
Thank you. I'll tell the
presenters.
Um
I guess my first question
to go to the owl
management. Uh
So do have we
had the federal government out
here um
creating any kind of updated
study on the management of
the out
of
>> they have recent information,
but they still haven't revised
the recovery plan.
The Mexicans bought it
and that's something I
think that really needs to
happen. This
whole
Sky Islands
of mountains here. This
is,
this is a fire evolved
ecosystems
and for them to be here,
somehow they had to be able
to adapt this
ecosystem. And,
and another one
of the things, you know, we,
we're currently updating
our chest management plan and
one of the things that's always been
in there and I, I did
ask about it, I,
there's a section on soils
in our forest management plan
and ever since I was
at P I Forestry in the
eighties, I always kind of
wondered what it meant and it,
it talked about the primary
soil type in this area
are molluscs.
So I, I, as
we're updating the management
plan, we did talk to the
man that did the
soil survey. Stoneman
and Landers was the, the
company that did it. And
I asked him, what does that
mean. And he
said molo
sos are grassland
soils.
That's huge.
They're not the forest
soils, they're grassland
soils that
tells you a lot as
there's never been a
thing for us like it is
now. >> Thank you. Thank
you, madam Chair. I appreciate that,
that the scientific in
information and approach of
how we're uh you
so the issues
we've had up here.
Um, but to have
a balance and I think
that's, that's one word. I haven't
heard there's a balanced approach and
without getting back to
um an economic development
plan as well as a
conservation plan.
And so I'd like to, I'm just
taking note of your words.
I think we need some more information
on that. My next question,
management goes to
Chari Sheri
in our,
the fire mitigation
uh and planning that we
have that we need to have our,
our co-ops
utilities, what
would be or have you
looked at the cost of, of
technology, adaptive
technology and
what that means to our co-ops
as they are incurring these
other uh costs
with insurance, out of
insurance,
madam Chair and >> representative.
Uh Yes, representative, the gluon,
we have looked
at those things right now.
Funding is
a priority for
us and funding is an issue.
Uh again, because we are
nonprofits. We
are, it depends on what it
is we're doing. Right.
First, we have to make sure we have
foundational efforts in
place. Second,
we look at technology.
We also though have to look at the
miles line that we
cover and what sort
of technology is going to be
available or
that we have about 61,000
miles of line across
New Mexico.
Um, one of the
issues too, just like
with public
safety power
shifts. One of the reasons the
co-ops have the
issue, there was just turning
that off because you could be turning
off 100 miles of line.
Um And so
when it comes to technology,
there are some concerted efforts
as far as studies are concerned.
I mean, there are the labs are studying
some of the things we have an N MS
U that's studying. Um
We do have ami
with a lot of the co ops and
there is technology that's
becoming more and more available.
But again, it's going
to depend on
how that's going to work with the
miles of line that we have
madam Chair
representative.
>> Thank you man and just
just for question on the
for the of time.
Um as we
as one of the recommendations
to be able to have our lines to
the
underground, I think looking at the
areas especially
require areas to
start those kind of projects that it's
just not feasible
that Chair
>> madam Chair representative.
So there is a
misnomer that underground
is going to solve all the issues,
but depending on the terrain,
especially in mountainous
area areas,
um it's almost
impossible in some cases
to underground those lines
in addition to that, it's
extremely expensive to
underground. Um
So it wouldn't be a solution
necessarily for our
Moar
Madam Chair and thank you >> madam Chair.
Appreciate the
time.
>> Thank you. Representative. Next is
Representative
Herrera.
Uh Thank you Mr.
Chair. Thank
you uh analyst.
It was an
enlightening uh
presentation and
I deeply appreciated
all the work that each of you have
done, not only
for your region but really
for the State of New Mexico.
And, um, I
commend
your hard work. And
II I,
I was a foundation
director back in 20
years ago when the Sarah and
had a up in the
house and we lost $400.
And I, I
just, I can't imagine
1300. I mean,
and, and these were people
who left with credit cards,
you know, I mean, I mean, when
you talk about a
community where you have
the high, low company, well,
it is really,
uh, a, a hard
heeled client. So
thank you all for your
efforts. I, I'm
very curious. Um,
commissioner,
uh, this, I'm
very, you said to, we're
gonna make 10 recommendations
to the State. And,
uh, mortgage insurance is
hard for every rural
place in New Mexico.
It's, it's just not this,
it's the same thing. My
homeowner's property personally
went on to $300 a month
last year and I
called my insurance agents
and she said, don't buy
it, they'll cut you
off and
it's, it's a real
problem for for,
not just for this,
this is happening in Hawaii,
California and everywhere this
is a national problem. Insurance
companies are not
insuring me
and, and, and especially
in rural areas. And
I just wanted to know
um but commissioner
if, if uh if you
have a recommendation of the State,
if you met the superintendent
of insurance, I'm just curious where
you're, where you're
at.
>> Thank you, ma'am. Um
So our, our approach
has been
the bottom up approach.
In other words, if
we solve the
source of the problem,
consider that the problem
really is risk
to reduce that
risk,
then
the the the problem
with insurability
ends up being less
so.
So, so
you know, the these, these insurance
companies wanna make money
and, and they wanna
have the least amount of risk
that they possibly can. We
all know that, you know that. So
I'm not telling you
anything but
if, but if you get, you
get to the point where you say, hey,
we've got a fire rise
community that
includes a building
code which kind of hard
uh the interior, you know,
build pasta tiles
as an example of
roofs. There's other
things, of course,
you strengthen the
firefighting capability
within those communities
and we talk about that and some
other representations
and then you also
have this, this thinning
process. You've heard time
and time again
and where, where the fires
are not that devastating,
they can be stopped
at that wildland
urban
fence.
Then then you've set up
an environment
that's financially
attractive to the
insurance,
that's what they do.
But right now it's so
bad all over the State
and by the western
states
uh that they've been kind
of
generalize their
risk and try to spread it across.
We think we
think that one of the things
that might happen at the
State level
is an effort in the
licensing uh side
of it to say,
hey, you've got treat
communities
individually,
not just the whole State.
I don't know if that's possible,
but you see where I'm getting
it. If there is a
community or a region
like we have
here
that is able to
establish that
it's fire
wise
to coin a term
that we've done the,
the, the vetting process that
we got the boundaries that
we have the
firefighting capability
to talk about
uh investing
in.
Then maybe one could
say that
insurance companies would
be more
willing,
feeling more comfortable
to insure that agent.
And I think that would be
my
suggestion.
But our approach certainly
is to try to find out
and mitigate
what's causing
that high risk to
stop
that.
>> Thank you, Mr. Fisher
and Mister Chair. I just want to
add that there are a group of
uh industry
insurance
um advocates
or people who work in the
insurance industry. We, we
do have, we do
have an insurance policy
in this State or
if for people who can't get
insurance, but it only goes
up to 250,000
right now. But for
affordable housing, you
know, if you're doing service,
they, they might
be able to get insurance and we're
talking about how much
that should be raised or could
was and how much it would cost to
stay. Uh but,
but there's a limit on
that and it doesn't go very
important, but we're uh I
can tell you there's a group of people
working on it right now,
meeting with the superintendent
of insurance and seeing
what we can do to
help >> uh
all rural communities
>> really who
face this problem. So thank
you, Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you representative.
We start
now. >> Thank you Mr. Chairman
and thank you for your presentation.
Um We were here for
LFC and, and as we
took a tour I it
struggle that there were, there were
ha there were
um
there are homes with signs of the
insurance companies and there
were several that didn't have any
insurance companies. So I
don't know how many were not insured,
but it is devastating.
But I have a question for
Mr.,
>> um,
the >> downs being devastated
and, and over and over with flood and
on how many people
did to the
downs in Deloy from
DOSA.
I'm sorry, I couldn't >> hear you.
How many people >> did the joson
t employ
>> the track itself was
of constantly f
when you
the face. So
once I season
and again, during
no full
time,
but during the races,
way up to be another
time,
I'll try to carers
to we Spanish
things.
>> So from 100 to
500 throughout the
seasons
>> there >> seasons
1,000,000
>> and I'm >> just a,
just a moment.
Um
It, it really is a
lot more than that.
If you go up and
down Hona Valley, the
Benina Valley and you go
outside, we've got some of
the, the biggest
uh
readers
in the State.
Uh We've got
trailers
and, and so you can
see how it's
not just the
rent for
all down
great, but
the impact was far
beyond. I just
want to make sure >> that keep
that
produce to
>> a
>> distance. You said, Reverend
sos last
three
years as
often explain their
here. That's what
it all starts.
Latins who
are owners are
noor and all
over the United States,
Canada, Mexico
and Brazil. This
racetrack is the Kentucky
Derin
of
and if it doesn't
happen here,
Ilo,
it does
presently an owner, one in a
one. But with that made
saying that's my
next test. It's a classic
admit. They're saying that's
my home. It
all starts
and that's the reason so would
have gave his trap
back
and the economic
that it has the
United States,
mainly New Mexico.
Uh We've
got new owners
coming from California that
bringing their breeding
farms.
We've got
broken into the brain, their
brain
and that's how we all start
at the brief.
Yes.
Thank you, >> Mr.
Chairman
John.
Where is he from? >> Mr.
George heard
Texas
basically
so serious.
It's very involved with
when their counseling,
these students as
much
time.
Um Thank you Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you for that. Uh Next up for
your website priority. We
still have four
people on the list.
I ask you to keep
your comments or questions
brief and your answers
brief.
>> Uh Thank you Mr. Chair
and just a follow up
about uh
Mr.
that found
to raise you that
um
have you um
seen a lot of horses
coming from, from Terra
Sunland
Park?
>> We haven't because we had
to shut down in
July. So
uh but in the
past to answer your question,
yes, there was training center
centers at
Pantera, there's one and two
or else at the Worman Park,
there's numerous training centers
across the State.
Yes.
>> Um And
have you since
there is a quarter horse racing
and um a
lot of the quarter horses do
come from there too.
Have you seen um
some of the
euthanization of horses
from the IP,
that equine
infectious
anemia,
>> uh, as a director in the
A, uh, a, I've been
very involved with
the, everything that's going
on with that
and I tried to keep up
with everything that's been
done, you know, to
stop the spread of the
E I. And,
uh, even as recently as this
morning, uh, the
trainer, the one specific
trainer that was heavily
involved with the E
I,
his, uh, soar
suspension was lifted
this morning.
Call
me really? Between
the lives they getting a hold
on the C I are
getting, getting everything
under control.
>> Um,
I think there's been over
20 some, maybe
26 forces
that have been euthanized
in the past few months.
And, um, do you think
they'll hold accountable
the, um,
responsibility
that,
um,
uh,
the, um,
racing, excuse
me, the racing board should
have, um,
held more of a,
this warranty
process
and, and
that wasn't, it was just kind of
like
>> there's, there's a multitiered
effect to
14 of
any livestock
in the State of New Mexico. And it
basically starts
with the
livestock board
that's in communication with the
racing coach.
And for me to go into the
depth of that I couldn't
really say because I
don't know
everything and, and
every case that
stemmed from Texas to
California, uh,
total,
I'm not aware of the
liberty case.
Uh, what I do
know as soon
as the rest of the commission found
out about it. Uh,
I think they took every
measure that they could in
cooperation with the
lifestyle
to find
these horses
we, and,
and working with
the USDA as
well, you know, to
get control, whatever
all the oops
is
>> Mr. Chair and
I think it's going to
come out
that they didn't, that it
was very much,
um, covered up
and went on
months. They were,
you know, finally things
were happening, but you're
raising quick in July.
So maybe that was
part of why they were
spare.
Did you have any horses
that were,
that you do
that? >> And I know
the other race tracks for the
State with
cooperation and directors
from the racing commission,
uh, they love their,
their rule.
Uh, it,
you only had to have a
Coggins once
a year and I
know that Seal hard has in
admitted a new practice that you
have had to have a New Coggins
within 30 days prior
to. I know
Texas has done something
very similar to that.
California has done the
same thing. They've, they've
created of
new standards
protocols that they have
no Conus for
behind.
>> Well, thank you very much. I appreciate
you. Thank
you,
responses
and
Townend
>> Ready. Turn it on.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um,
and analyzing,
brought real
interesting
presentation forward. But
I think there's one topic
that we have
missed that is
crucial and
that is the
conservation
of water
to the valley
and to the State.
Um
madam President, I
said,
uh on
more than one occasion
on the house
floor,
uh, and, and other
committees that if you
want to see,
uh for
management.
Hello? Yeah,
or
go to this.
That is
where
you can drive by or you
can actually see
the utilization
of the person in a
wise manner. What I would
say is wise man.
But I believe one
topic that I'm gonna ask
you found on a little
bit is
this overgrowth
and what it has done
is the utilization
of water.
Can you address that,
please?
>> We have too many straws in the
ground
and, and
with the wire involved
ecosystem that we
have, I do
believe we had quite a bit
more water. Even
in Mescalero, we are
seeing especially
our wells, the ones
used to cattle and, and
wildlife. We
are having to drill them
to 300 ft
deeper. There is
a huge problem with
that and if we can't
treat the whole mountain, we're not gonna
be able to deal with that.
We May have water
out of the room and, and the
forest management,
keeping these forests
more open like they were
like what you see on the
handout that they gave
you. That's the
key to keeping water
in this area. I mean,
we're, we're talking about
insurance and electricity
and all that. If we don't have
water in this place will not
be. It is
very important like you
mentioned. >> Thank
you.
II,
I just wanted to create
a right. So
I know ICI
and I had the
community leaders. So there is
down
of
in the village itself
in Alco
water is a real.
So,
so I
think it, it's
interesting that
this
>> um I'm
very impressed with
the leadership
of the knowledge
um that is
uh
required for
this uh
crisis,
but it's not only
what you said. Um
I know that we talked about the
exhaustion that you can't
rest yet. It didn't
continue. I want to
make sure that I understand
what it is that you
need from legislator
looking for
commissioner for me
to provide him a list of
Atend things you're asking.
Um And great we
can ASA and it
here. Um,
I, I hear that you maybe,
uh, talking to our
congressional delegation
that you need,
um, advocacy
with the National Forest
Service.
Um, and
I hear
that you May
need, um,
issues to look into
the superintendent of
insurance with
the superintendent of insurance.
I appreciate,
um,
your ability to give us
a roadmap of what to do
to sort of address the
risks. But I
live almost four
hours from here
on a flat dry
base with no
dreams and my
property insu insurance
almost double
and they quoted me because
of fire.
So I'm not sure
insurance companies
or you see your great
intention, but I like the
attitude of it and
you know, it's at least something we
can do. Um
I, I'm asking, I have
two questions. One is
the funding that the
legislature, the emergency
funding of the legislature
of the job. Do
you have access to it?
Have you had access to
it? And how quickly did
you use it? Just for
emergency services?
Um You asked for
help further uh
help. I need like economic
development.
I'm asking a bunch of questions
here and then you guys pick which ones
you want. We've learned a
lot of
that we from our
clean water pumps and
things like that. The virus
in Las Vegas. So
what lessons or what
legislative uh
support that was
provided to
Las Vegas that
you think that would help this
area now?
So I'm asking for
what it is that
you have or some kind of
technology for
you to use from
um, that fire
because I know that there was a great deal
of technology that
came out of that
management
thing.
>> Well, we uh haven't
received $22
million of the 44 that
the bill is gonna be
hopefully accessing of the
70 actually 100
million overall
scheme of things that you folks
did. So we
haven't been able to access
it just yet. We're still going through
the FEMA process, which,
you know, is somewhat cumbersome
for it's proof through the
fema process. And then with the
State uh
approving those just to
make sure that they're
qualified
in that they're reversible.
So we're in the process
of that. I do.
So we do have access. We have
signed contracts that will cumbersome
of those funds on
bloodshed recovery. This
is a big thing that we're just speeding
up with uh trash
racks, the teaching ponds,
uh asco baskets, all of
those kind of things are going to be coming
out of some of that. I know
the county has a lot more invested
in that as far as debris
removal, uh road
clearance and all of that. I know
they're into it for about $12
million that some of these
funds we thought would be
reimbursable
um through the FEMA
process on bar A and
now that, and that it's gonna be
part C
which is a longer term
period. And so we are working
with those and some of you over here
and others are working
on our behalf to make
sure that we can get access to
those funds.
Um We're still working
on reversible that the village
has had out, you know, for some
months fema record,
it's a different program.
So, through the cog
and other organizations,
we've been able to obtain grants
that we've hired FEMA specialists,
engineers that are able
to work correctly.
The FEMA we do have a new
fa uh I forget
what it style is.
Jose. Uh
it's kind of like coordinator.
Yeah.
And he's been here before he was
here, German Bride. So we're very
comfortable with the guy who's knowledgeable
about the area. Been working with
other folks that are
within V that are working
hand in glove with folks
from D HSE
M uh they work
with the State. So if you
have those folks that are intimate
with the, what's going on in the
community and accessing those
funds and documentation
preauthorizations, making
sure that the things will
be. So
we, we expect it to be able to
start using those funds pretty
soon. And I know once
they start going, they would
quick because I
personally signed, you know, over
$50 million of
an agreement,
watershed recovery. Other
things I've mentioned before,
Alco Lake and Deduct Pond,
that's part of that program.
So uh to help us
cover a lot of our deductible
which is 12.5% for
the village and 12.5
for the county uh of
money that we honestly don't
have. So it's
within your health that we're to at least
prostate with some, with
confidence.
And so we're moving
forward
>> if I May give you the,
the, the counties uh
story is very
similar.
Um I, I
think going
forward, we,
we need to look at how the
Legislation is
written and what
are the, the guidelines on
it. And I
think the
counties can do a better
job in, in
putting together
that language. So it is
more accessible than it
currently is.
Uh you know, our
budget in the counties is
pretty limited. So when
you have a 25%
or in this case,
a 12.5%
out of
$40 million
expenditures, it
can rapidly
and immediately deplete
uh the resources that the county
has. Um
So we're very appreciative
of, of the initial effort.
I think, I think the
cautionary tale
is that the county
needs to be more
engaged without
the Legislation that's written.
So the D fa
feel like uh they
can spend in the
way it and by
the original uh
pa
>> thank you so much. I
think those are great
updates. Uh
As a legislator,
we need to know
where's the bottleneck
and the process. And so
thank you very much.
I will say I will
talk to you later because I know, we're
at the time, but
I am interested in any
kind. I know we've learned so
much about
technology that was developed up
in Las Vegas over the
last on
clean the water,
um and pumps,
it came from the oil
and gas companies.
Uh that, that, that
technology that was
developed uh was
very beneficial. And I know
that in the
universities of,
in that area are
now specialized in
these kind of,
of wildfires. And so
I hope I, I like
to hear that a team
work of maybe should have
used all our State
Christmas. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator
Woods is always
brief, >> very
brief.
All right, a couple
of questions and they can be very
easily. Yes or no
question.
Has there been a flood control
land of going this
year
>> in the process?
We, uh, the village, the,
the gonna be 3 to
5 years. So we take
a grant
called Very
Well recognize
Fola Engineers that are in the
process. Now, they
should have that completed
by middle of the December
hoping. Uh, so
that we do have flood planning
for the village and
the, the butters sheds
that affect us like
cedar.
>> Ok. So we're talking
about the middle of
December
to have something in
place.
And from that point forward,
we can go
with such
things and set it back
politically and,
and that kind of things that
maybe we can
mitigate some of the insurance
costs that
way.
Chairman >> Senator. That's
what we're hoping, uh,
because of the,
you know, the high water mark close
to three, maybe 6
ft in some areas and
identifying the new floodplains
and flood ways and some for
business such as
Oxford
employs over 100
people. They're still in the
stage of rebuilding. Not
sure how much, how many
people they're gonna employ because
we don't know what it's
been. It will be done
to mitigate water damages
from the floods coming at
70. So a
lot of those things, yes,
we hope that it will answer some of
those so that we can reveal
as far as insurance
mitigation. That's a whole
another subject. I know there's
several of you myself,
including work very
plan to try to see
what we can do and also
working, you know, the
managers of our eyes open
number
>> and the the subject of
insurance is a big
deal and
complicated,
complicated deal.
And Mr.
Chair, I don't
know when you've been asked to, but
I've been asked to go
several
seminars,
get a better education
than insurance.
One of the sad things is
every so often
on the bill that we
have. We do not have
peace in the legislative
under the insurance
person.
And it's
sad when we don't
have that expertise
within the legislator
itself,
then we grasping
to for knowledge.
So in that
grasp for knowledge, I
noticed that you would say
that New Mexico
Back Fund was not
being
a put
together so that you can
help with your
45%
of matches,
uh, is,
is there some things you
can bring forward to give us
some direction
on that, on a yes or
no answer.
And if you can bring
those things forward is what I'm
saying. We're
looking, we're looking
also for
opportunities
here to
help you
>> fitness or some things. I think
we can, uh,
but the health, but it's
a, it's very comp
>> ok. And,
and make
sure
just reiterating
the losses, we have
flooded fire
pale to the
losses we
have
paid.
So we it's a
complicated,
uh you know,
they say, well, we we should
be paid higher
rates in one part of the
State and other part of the State.
They're relating to
this and
that
unintended
consequences
of Legislation
sometimes causes a
huge amount of
fraud
and
I could go on, but
I heard
a r that I was
along with it. So thank
you.
And there was, that was just >> a
rule. Uh
Rossel
briefly.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I
appreciate y'all's presentation
today.
Um
Madam President, I think
you will agree with me many,
many, many years ago
when I was working
with the land council committees and
stuff like that, a healthy
forest was considered to
be 50 trees
or less for
an right now. We
have areas around
here and elsewhere
of over 1000
trees,
right? With the
devastating fires, we have
had not only here but up in
the Cat Canyon Roberts
Peak area, the little
bear fire the Bluetooth
fire, mcbride
fire.
All of these
have been devastating fires
because of the conditions that
had the, the US
Forest Service
has not done their job
to protect and it's
not protecting our
wildlife
nor the residents that
live in those particular
areas. Whenever we're
talking about conservation.
Whenever the US forest
service does not
come in and clean up their
forest, it is affecting
those people, not
only in those particular
areas but downstream
as well. F
I get really upset
whenever I talk about the US
Forest Service and the Army
Corps of Engineers and their
lack of doing
anything to help the
State of New Mexico.
And if anybody is here that would
like to stand up and say, I'm front
of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Let us do it now.
Oh, wait, they're not
here because it's not that
important anymore.
And yes, I do get real
upset because of what affected
y'all upstream
here during,
especially this last
fire that we had
and then the flooding that
happened of the fact.
And we,
and I said
my ranch is 70
miles from
here
because it wiped out.
I can't tell you how many
miles fences. All my
water caps, all of our
bridges were
impacted by this, all
the way through Rosswell, all the
way down to Vegas
River.
Army Corps of Engineers,
sits behind a desk
in Albuquerque, twiddling
their thumbs and then there's
a new machine that comes
in every four years
and we have to go through the same
process over and over
that the erosion problems
that we're seeing not only up
here in this
particular area but up
in the Las Vegas areas, well,
where those fires have been
nipping. Now, we're going
to be seeing them over on the
western side of the State.
And I think it's time that
we as a legislating
body do something
about this because
the insurance problems
that are taking place
up here or in these other fire
areas are now
us now it's track
because we just experienced
a big flood down there last
week.
And
because of what insurance
has done,
the Majority of these people did
not have flood insurance
on their homes.
And I can't tell you the number of
homes that have been lost out there.
Thank goodness there were
just two fatalities
in the raw area last
week
and we did not have the
devastation that you
guys experienced over
here in, in
Redos. If anybody
would like to see what
did take place,
especially in
uh the curve up
there at the center. The Meacham,
I do have videos
of that and what took place
at the race
track.
And that is very important as
far as our tourism industry
goes and the welfare
and the well being of
this community.
And we've heard from the mayor and the
commissioner and
MFA,
what
happened whenever
everybody had to be
evacuated from this
community. We
had dot Thank goodness
working finally use
some common sense there
to get people back
into Reda. So
they would even have a
work
because of economic
growth
with sty
folks.
I just,
what we're seeing growing
now on these
areas that have been here, especially
after the little bear
fire
is nothing but
scrub,
nothing will eat
it. We have cedar
growing which
has been, I can't
remember who said it, Mr. Commissioner,
I believe, said it uh that
takes over 100 gallons
a day out of our
watersheds.
Folks, we
have to wake up, we have
to get our sawmills
working again.
The environmental
department, make sure
that those were shut down
as well as our cotton
gins throughout the
State.
There's only two lived in the State
of New
Mexico.
But the erosion problem that
we are facing downstream
now is unbelieve.
Unbelievable. And whenever
it goes to washing out our bridges,
which we experienced
this last weekend
because you cannot
go from Rossville
to Artesia on 285
anymore because both
set the bridges are
because of the
trash that has accumulated
and argue with forests that
are now going downstream.
Mr. Chairman. Thank you very
much.
>> You >> and
last we have
the 10
>> bits
and
thank you Mr. Chair and
I just wanted to
uh, well, first of all, I want
to talk about
mainly for our,
our
Committee as well
as everybody listening
in. I wanted
to just talk about some of
the red tape, the
bureaucratic
nonsense that goes
on where we can't get things going
on. So back in
July, we
did not
the to get some
emergency funding to
Lincoln and Otero
counties,
there was one piece
of language put in
there, which
was of
public infrastructure
and because we had
public infrastructure in
there, it didn't
cover class
A and B.
So it didn't cover
debris.
Well, who was thought,
how do you fix public
infrastructure? Ladies and
Gentlemen, without removing
debris,
but now they're not able to draw
down on that money
until
the, until the Session
comes around. And I'm
gonna run another some
more Legislation
to see if I can clean up
some of the
language
or it doesn't say public
infrastructure so they could
get the money to take
care of debris,
remove.
It's frustrating
because you don't know how,
I mean, you do know how to write
it and then
there's people that write
the Legislation, they give
you a and then you run it
through your people
and if you get
seven, a sense of eye
on it, then you can
normally get
it let through the right as time. But
now I just found
out last week
that now we can't access
debris removal because it
says public infrastructure
frustrating
insurance.
The I have
worked with the office of
the Superintendent of
Insurance and they
are trying to work
some insurance. We're
trying to get the caps raised
on a lot of our commercial
as well as our
residential
insurance.
Now
I call the banker just
a local banker.
If I get fair
plan insurance, will you give me a
loan?
No.
How does that help
life?
Why are you giving me insurance?
Probably because you have a mortgage.
Well, if you can, if you give
them, if you have a mortgage
and you give the insurance and your
banker, your financial
institution does
not recognize
it. What good is
it doing? Us? We have to
figure that out because it doesn't
have cost free
replacement
if I'm your Baker
and you borrow $350,000
for me and, and the State
is only going to protect
you for 200,000.
I don't want the loan. I need
you to be made whole I'm, it
needs to be 350,000.
We are working on
that and
they are moving the caps
as as I
mentioned. And
then um
just for this
particular
Committee,
I am gonna be running the
Legislation and I would like
to get the support on changing
the language to where we can bring that
money in our in our
community can access
that 70 million that was
brought back.
And um
and then I just wanted to
mention that we
have hundreds
of drugs running
our roads right now
and you know what's gonna happen
with all of our roads
in the village as well as in the
county.
And uh I'm
not trying to be greedy.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm just
trying to make our
standard communities
back up and make it
whole again. And the
reason I missed this is
because our friends over in Chavis
County are fixing to
go through the same exact
thing and they're gonna need
to, to be made whole as
well and please
whoever's gonna run it the
Legislation to us,
the public
infrastructure. Thank
you. Mr.
Chair.
Thank you representative and
thank you to pan.
I think that was the
best Pamela. I
appreciate you
all.
Hey, next up,
uh, we have, well, gas
royalty rates, one city trust
land with
assistant commissioner,
State land
office.
Thank you, sir.
We're running late.
So we do
have a lunch coming
up in your own organic after
lunch as well.
Uh, if
you don't feel the need to
take out here for >> a lot of
time
that
I'm glad you give me all some time back
today. And, uh,
all to all that, I heard this
presentation a couple of times in
the last few weeks. I see, uh,
Representative Scott
there was and, and
that as well. So,
and of course, uh,
the Chairman was still
sponsoring 48
the uh 2024
legislative Session.
Uh Again, I'm Gregor Lo, I'm the
assistant commissioner or
mineral resources of the land
office. I oversee
our oil gas and mineral division, including
our Water Bureau and
our Road Management division as
well.
Uh,
and thanks all of you for being here
and it's great
that I come in for 12
last night.
See that this facility is
the, the fire
damage and the, you said
shed Isac
uh,
but of course, I did that quite
meaningful, uh,
damaged, uh,
destroyed buildings and homes. It
was so
very
still that,
um,
that's why
I,
I going through all of these,
I'll just note that this
past year was our, our second
best year to date, uh
over $2.5
billion in earnings, uh
some 90% of that
from all the gas industry. And
we have those industry
here. Uh I always thank
you for that. Uh
That was a tremendous
uh all of
money and about
90 million of that from our oil and
gas.
Uh I also point out our,
our major wind projects,
the renewables. Uh
We have the uh
largest
wind project,
the Americans from Canada
Del Fuego on stage, trust
that uh that pattern
energy. And so I, I
think I saw some of those folks
here. You
thank about as
well.
Oh,
finally, I, I would just note
that uh we have
uh some oil and gas industry
trainings. This past year,
we had over 200
participants. We offer
a one on one training
uh for anybody.
Uh Due to royalty management, the
average uh Atend
has been working in the world
space, but just one of them here
so important for
us.
Next slide, you can see the State lands
that are assigned to uh
beneficiaries and this
really drives what we do with the
land office. We're working
for our State
Westland beneficiaries,
you all know 80% of
them. Uh
80% of these land benefit
K 12
Education
backing Gas
Royals. It's good with the land grant
Permanent Fund
and uh
spend about 6% of the final
rolling average education
in
and you know, the land
office, about a 6 to 8%
think it's free depending on the
month. I think that's
about one third of the
State average. That's because
people identify with our mission
land office. Ultimately, this
is real. It's about how
we make a little bit more money
for
sharers.
Next slide shows are burnings
by uh
past uh
14 years,
tremendous uh
UPSing oil and
gas
revenue.
A couple of blame guns
and pull that slide
it out.
Sick of
the final pages here
on screen
rubbing in the world. It is a great
Legislation.
Um especially
what this bill will do will give the
land office a new
maximum ro
rate of 25%.
Currently, the highest rate we can
charge
score is 20%
and this
of course will only be
on, on new
leases. No existing
leases,
the unaffected. In
fact, our average world screen is
just about 13
some percent. Most
of our leases unfortunately
held by production
for decades
and released
12.9%.
And uh so we
have this kind of wait in
lower average
grade I
believe to 25%
would would get us uh
on par with
Texas. We talk more about
that. That's the
general rule of that.
Our counterparts connect
space.
Uh bidding of the horse on leases
is entirely voluntary.
No one ever has to bid on
the tracks that we put up our
or two
every
month
and not this
issue leases
uh we sell
a 25%
PSS
things
20%
expired.
Very simple will
place and
a stab champion. Two
word place, word,
1/5 1
order
place
uh
stayed on.
There are a couple of changes to
build
services.
The next slide,
uh We believe that a
25% real rate bes
an additional billion in revenues
to our school kids beneficiary
in decades
uh to see the
projections. But a lot
of these projections were
uh a little lower than
what we had in
office.
Of course, it takes time
for the higher world
to come into
effect.
Its about three years
to get the first slowest
thrill
companies traditionally buy
and at
least five years to
down to production. That
is we can fill the Boles in your
two or three year
for take
off the
actually
benefits
the uh S IC
projects that uh a
little solution. So
1.5 billion
more perent on by 20
51.3
billion.
The next slide,
why we gonna do
this?
I do this because
the beneficiary and for the
trustees
State trust
tenants,
if before them get the same
rates that
uh Texas has the
third of
25%
even if we had the same.
I right now, it would
still be less expensive
Texas
our oil and gas list. If
you all know set by
going back to a
place
we don't get to create in
terms of that
piece.
And
our allows us to
take a substantial
deductions for processing
on natural gas.
Uh two of last
eight years, 0.6 of
dollars uh
that cost us
$400 million
must about 15 million
year.
This bill will produce
up to 85 1
year. Still,
their costs are lower
than in Texas.
Also, the uh our,
our oil and gas
is for all depth, all
formations. And Texas
can auction off
pieces, balms, They
can sell at least desperate,
bray, desperate.
And finally,
another things our
our least gives to
have five years.
Torill
in Texas, the
bus
and in Mexico.
So private
transactions, there's a
25% growth as
well.
I believe we consider this because we
have just rock
better. Texas
is a couple
of these you can get
but
density as well as
100
was
are have
slide,
the United States production
perming and non
perm.
And I would be the third
largest
oil and gas producing region in the
world,
large,
the country of the world compared
to.
So if they
Russia
>> pull your mic a little bit of
those, >> sorry,
something
like I was yelling.
That's not
better.
The next
slide
you see the importance of the
Caribbean in New
Mexico,
basically counts for all
introduction to be a
little
San Juan
Basin,
Birmington also drives
Texas oil production
well
and here we can see the great
to so the DNA counties
uh produces almost one third
of the
oil produced in the
Permian,
uh, entirely
across Texas
and Texas
Fund
at the top of Herlo
producers,
both of these two names that
are you aware
of?
But this slide shows
our inventory
of open acreage,
dark green. Is it
acreage that we still have to
lease? Uh, the
pink color there? And
it has already been the
things that, uh, the current
commissioner has release
for six years in
office. Uh, a
as you can see, there's,
there's almost no open
in, in the best parts of the
permian. Uh, we don't
believe that this Legislation
will, you know, unfortunately,
have type of
impact we love just because we
don't have
much. Uh, they
had, uh, left
police.
You're also aware
and many of us have discussed
this before, but,
uh, commissioner
pa leases our
best anage so we can
get that
acreage up for sale
at 25%.
So, holding
those tracks for the future, although we're
still having a
regular
sale,
it's doing pretty well. Was,
was.
This slide comes from an
LFC product that compares
uh tax rates
and number of
well producers State particularly tax
in Mexico about
their worst
royalty rates are not
tax to what own
gets for
everybody.
Atlan
one
question, we price
out
New Mexico affirms by
having a higher reality
range.
Um I
don't believe so. That's generally
not who's buying right
now. In
fact, about 1%
of our royalty rate, about
1% of our royalty receipts
come
from
companies. It's about 20 million
a year. Uh
Independence
basically as well bill here
that
depend
uh one thing to
consider when we
increase
the Theseus goes
down a little bit
decent or affordable
out of the
25%
to
potatoes.
Got more slides here.
Um I thought
this was interesting.
Not because of the Tyler or anything,
but just a
55 of the companies involved
in my own gas summer is a
horse officer as provider,
but
uh five
companies earn about
$250 billion
profits in past
years. About
85 83 million
a >> year in
profit,
84 million. >> This
could bring in over time
to get up and go higher
royalty rate. I would
produce 84 million, which
is 1/10
1%
the profits.
Five companies
we pay probably half
royalties in New Mexico.
So it would be half a 10 to
1% of this
province
summer would be,
we're charged with
earning top dollar for
our beneficiaries.
About the 25%. We should
be on par with Texas.
Absolutely.
>> And leaving a
>> billion >> more >> dollars and by
not doing this
last thing I'll say is
a beneficiary. It's
a fiduciary.
Uh I
think that's a role a lot of us
have played in
our last for and others.
My, my inla moved in with me
in February for health
reasons, both
suffered from
Convention Alzheimer's and other
health issues. We
sold their house
and uh
Oron
and that the thing
that uh we
sold their place, they're better,
they're gonna count on it.
So you can only get
80% of what that, that house
is worth.
I think you're gonna get
300,000
law there. What we're
running up against is this law that's
leased, which is most
we can ask for is
20%
getting 25%
test
that I won't up for any
questions, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you, Mr. President. >> Questions
should
be quickly more common. I think this,
I, I fully support this.
Uh and I have heard this
presentation a couple of times
now and, and, you know, in
LLC last week,
uh we went over
the
uh we
have a, a
federal
presentation on,
on the voice
reports on oil and gas for
our State in the region.
And New Mexico is,
is everything and more that you're seeing
here. So I think that if
we're seeing these profit margins
increase as you've mentioned, I mean, I think
it's very clear all
the information, any
question I have is, is this
in here
the question I have is, is why
I think we done
this
in the past. And that's
really what is, is kind
of like it cruciating
to me because we are losing
in these record amounts of
production profits that
we're seeing that New Mexico
really is using that on
a lot of these
royalties and this money
to go it. But, and you
know that the cost of everything
is just going up Chair
and for us not to do
this, it's really,
um it's, it's
beyond, hasn't been
done. It's one of the ways that
I, I was principle when I
started as a legislator
that needed to be
done. And I know
that we, we
try to, I just
hope we get it in this next
Session. Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator
C.
Thank you all very much. So,
thank you for the presentation.
I kind of an interesting question. I'd
like to know that the
Commissioner Richards
um in the
last year or so
announced that she would be
suspending issuing
leases until
the Legislation does royal
increase.
That always puts me in
mind of this balance of our
government tensions
between Executive
like land office and
legislature. So it
feels a little bit like somebody's got a gun
to my head and I never like that feeling
very much, but I'm trying
to figure out a couple of things about that.
So one, first of all
the, the materials indicated
this past my house
pass, set up. How far
the
>> Yes. So mister Chair
Senator Cervantes, uh this
bill uh
died in the Senate.
Finance. It was her, but it
was not allowed to come
up for a
vote.
>> What part of that is not
breasted
>> that it was brought up on that.
It was raised in the Committee,
heard of the Committee but
not where we done.
>> No, it's, it's not, it's
not unprecedented in my Committee at
all. But
I was to hear
that.
Um, but I, I was
curious, I thought that
advance and,
and this
extension
comes up a little bit, I think in part
because even the industry itself seems
to be political materials
here. Let's say
the industry seems to be
indecisive itself,
uh which is, they're not taking the
position one way or the other, which
is prejudice to me. I
can't imagine that my, is
my business, will it
or law to have the
organization
and also not taking a
position on? I
know the represented here today and I
appreciate it, but I, I
don't understand that
and I still right about that,
the
position
the, that they're paying
should be increase
on
anybody in business. Does
that?
Yeah, thank
you. Am I right? Take
no position on this.
>> Uh Mr. Chair Senator.
Uh yes, that's correct. Uh
The moga has been
neutral on this bill.
In fact
that vocal
in
support
oxy and eg two of the
biggest uh oil and gas
producers in New Mexico,
uh both stood up
uh the
House and Senate uh Committee
hearings on the bill and
support. And we also have some
suppli supporters among
other demo companies that
might be why they
might be rolled. And
then Senator,
you know, back to your,
your
uh
statement that,
uh, you know, you
don't want to feel like this is, you know,
the commissioner of the land
office, I had a gun
in your head or trying
to wash your hand.
You know, this was clearly
never, uh me
in that way.
Um The commission of
public lands is still doing the
monthly lease sale, THS
use it every month.
Um We're leasing some very good
tracks, not the
best stuff but certain stuff that
selling for a million dollars or
more for just like
100 and 20. So
some very decent track
involved.
And
I think the, the commissioner
and her staff, we felt
that
that
just couldn't keep
leasing the best lands
for a sub market.
Ra uh that
was, uh,
you know, in a sense giving away a lot of
value in companies that are
pays and more
25% ros great
in Texas.
And
we,
so that was really the, the
genesis of that. That was
not to, to
make it look like a, a conflict
between the branches
>> and I appreciate that. I May not
that at all. I
said to me my,
that's exactly what it feels like.
So, um, so you
guys pass this Legislation,
I'm gonna take like the poison.
All right.
But that's what I'm sure
that's probably not what I was thinking.
The again, I,
I'll sit here as a businessman
and going, I can,
I can an industry or
sector our economy
saying say
there's a proposes of Legislation
to charge us more
for the cost of doing business.
And we take a position on that
is, but I'm missing
something here and I understand what you're
saying, it some parts of the industry,
we're OK with that bos are
gone. II, I just have to better
understand that because I,
I'm out of
the, I don't understand
how much they were literally
gonna be, but
obviously, at some point in time
comes to where we're charging too
much, we start taking ourselves out of the
market. Um But
we truly
low so low
in, in Texas.
Why is anybody
uh
drill in Texas? Well, they all
come here and isn't
that sometimes we want? So that's
what we want to be
low in the market place
to attract business
here guys. So we do that with other
things, film or whatever
else we do. So
I want better understand
why,
why there are
we comparing Aam really
on the right hand, like we really
album and one
just went out in
my role, the that great,
I could better understand
that some
the
um
but I, but I do hope that
at some point that we get better or some
guy industry
but, but
well, suggest
that it is good to the
market, a good
market right to
Texas
right now.
I have that
and this is I'm not talking to
use that
they here that
represent more mass
interests of legislature,
parts of s you have
it my part.
But
those that are here that representing the industry
and in fact that there's even division
within, I think I
see division within the
industry all
be kind of
about what the right
thing to do in terms
of,
I do appreciate
taking my questions and this issue
that, that we're holding back
of these. Like the
reason is because I mean, if
you're in business, you sitting
there thinking, ok, we're
holding back these
leases
waiting for the legislature to increase
the role. So future kind
of the rate would be higher will
ultimately do more
to accomplish the mission of the,
of the commission will help
get obviously maim that.
So that makes some sense.
On the other hand, while
you're studying those leases,
you're depriving yourself
of revenue
and business
in, in perhaps the
market condition that exists.
It May not exist
next year, over year after that
as, as prices fall.
So you, you really
can't just say, well, waiting
until the Legislation
increases the world in ultimately
profit to save because that
May not be entirely true.
And, and I don't know what
I, I just got a real analysis but
what has the suspension
of those things causing us
in terms of the time value? It was really,
but I'm thinking about the time value
that of those
funds that could have been in
over that period of time. I guess that
there's no such analysis >> that
very soon.
Mr. J said,
no, we were not
done
technical analysis of this.
But as Mr. Garcia
Richard says, we'll, we'll
take a delay in earning a
few million dollars on, on
on the lease sale
that once we have that
higher royalty rate
turn around and sell those
leases, they
make of those on
the bonus on the lease
sale. And then we make
billions more for
permanent five school kids
uh in the long run. So
we always say we're willing to
delay making a few millions to
make it at least.
>> Well, again, I appreciate that
you're saying willing to do that,
but we really can't do that
intelligently once you know a side
by side analysis to what wouldn't
happen if you least
those put out those.
Now at the current rosing
R as supposed to way
to some unknown
date in the future, the royal
might be higher. You, you
can never really do
honest, genuine
analysis and say one's better
than the other without
in the future doing that side
by side and that hasn't been done.
So I, I really can't say this
is probably gonna be
better for
the revenues
to the State to the
beneficiaries of the
State trust. I,
I know that you can say that,
but I would be
right. We should
right to postponing the
vision of those issues will
ultimately be
more to say,
to say that
that's the given.
I think it's probably a
pretty, thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator
Representative.
>> Uh Thank you, Chair. Thank
you very much for your presentation.
So um the microfilm was
away from me for a little bit.
So I to go over some
things that are in the
fire.
I I'm just recapping.
Um You have,
the land commission
has already come to the legislative
two years to
ask for
equity. Um
And then
25%
of their, their leases.
Um And we've yet to
be able to
uh provide that our
neighbor, the shares
of the mason
is charging
25 percent and the
industry that would have
to pay this
is not
providing uh
stay neutral
in it. There's another conflict
in that organization
that they are not
uh opposed
or
um uh for that.
So, thank you very much. I
um when, when
um when our
State into
these leases, how long are
they
for
>> Chair Representative? Uh
the lease is a
five year lease which gives
a company that period
of time to drill,
establish a commercial well,
once that
well is producing,
remains uh
producing into
commercial quantities. It's
held by the production.
So then
the, the leave can go on
uh almost inde
until that well
is essentially plugged and
abandoned
or another. You have
subsequent we or wells on
that lease and
that can extend it as well. And
this is why our
average royalty rate, despite
decades of leasing and 18
and three quarters of 20%
loyalty rate, our average royalty rate
is still uh 15
some percent
because
our first world rate
ever was 1/8
or, or 12.5%.
And that's
what's holding us to kind of
down and
in our ability to
create more royalty
value uh
for >> thank
you Mr. Chair. So, um
thank you very much, I very
much applaud the land
commission uh for
not entering into
the what can basically
be a
20 year or
lifespan contract.
Um obligating
the State to take
substandard
uh uh
leasing rates
uh which would be against
the mission of the land
commission who is supposed to
be earning
fair market value
to help our.
Uh so I do
appreciate that. So
despite Um With
one of your maps, you
show a map of
Herm Basin.
Is that
two or three
times, what is the
larger landmass
in Texas compared
to New Mexico?
Is it four
times the size of
land mass in New
Mexico twice the size
landmass?
>> Mr. Chair
representative, uh I
think the Texas Permian uh
land wise, I think about
three times the size of
New Mexico's permian.
And uh as you'll see in that
slide that compares
the counties, counties to
Texas production. Uh
We're producing about
uh one third
of permian production in Texas,
approximately two thirds of that
production.
>> I think it's just my last
question. So, uh
from a non
oil person as
well, uh land
mass doesn't necessarily
mean the most amount
of oil. Uh
And so, uh when
we have a larger
land mass
for more
drilling on the
pide, but
through our
studies now
we do, we
have identified
resources
of the fossil
fuel, correct. Um
And that on
even on a smaller land
nurse and
correct,
>> Mr. Chair Representative.
That's correct.
Um
Companies go out, they do
uh seismic studies
of of areas
often before or
after uh wes
them. And
what? But I think what
is
we in our understanding of
geology now? It's just
the thousands of wells have been
drilling over the past
decade. Um
Nearly all of them
uh in the last 56
years, uh
the horizontal,
many of them
having
all side on a role
uh
frac jobs while
three or four miles.
So you have a very good
understanding of
geology uh
in New Mexico and Texas.
And in many of these companies,
um we've been here and they
have operations
that have incredible resources in
those states and they, they
develop them one
slide. I realized I, I clicked
over um actually
showed that
in
2020
21 and 22
the growth in oil production
in New Mexico
uh beat out
taxes on a per barrel
basis. So
uh New Mexico is
adding more new barrels
of oil in Texas, not even on a percentage
basis
on a percentage basis.
Well, uh when
the LFC
presented or
the Dallas fed presented the
LFC last week, but I did
see that Texas uh
narrowly beat us out last
year. So we have to change
my.
>> Thank you very much Mr. Chair
and thank you for your presentation
and thank you for
protecting um
discuss it. Thank
you.
Thank you >> representative that we
represent. Stop
and I would note that our
lunch is ready and
waiting for
us.
No, Mr.
Channel,
we're gonna have a little conversation
in just
a
Mr. Chairman to
address
first Senator
Savona's
questions.
Well, why
some
companies within
the industry had no
objections.
No, she
turned
of this plans
will stay at the
unable end of the
located in the State or
already of
beliefs,
the vast Majority of
this
so release on
major all
companies which
dominate
they landscape at the
moment.
So these folks have
not been
participating
for the most part
in the
well will be inhibited.
Would be folks
that don't have a
stationing
trying to establishing.
So it would be the new
companies trying
to come
and
developed a footing.
Yeah, there will be certain
cc
where Marvin Wall
companies would
here and there
need to track to fill
out.
But that would be
I would select the
exception
right
now,
Mr. Chairman Mr.,
when you agree
with me that
the viability of the
prospect
in New Mexico versus
Texas would
be a function
of
profitability
which would depend
on not just
alters
but a number of
other
factors.
>> Mr. Jared kind of got
uh yes, the viability
as well. Deployment of
capital uh certainly
depends on
retirement on investment, ultimately
profitability.
>> And, and I
still believe in one of your slogs
to New Mexico
tax rates and
production law
8.5%. Is
that
>> Mr. Chair of that is
correct.
>> You have paid a lot of
serve lower and
emergency school tax
some with
tax over the
years. And I believe
on one of those products,
his time 2%
and then the other
18.85.
I was curious, this
is where he developed
a to
have
>> Chair Representative Scott those
numbers LFC
publication, I believe
in June
of
2023.
And I understand to
compare uh all
all the major uh
taxes across
the board and
that product
was
essentially LFC, the
town to
compared to the various
tax related costs in
business,
New Mexico with the
other um oil
and gas to these
states.
>> Mr. Chairman Mr. Bloom
Thera taxes
on oil and gas
on average about the
average sector's
what we have supported
economic
for many, many
years.
Now, I
believe I heard Mr.
Chairman Mr. Moon a
question as to
what study had
been effected
to determine the
point of
maximizing
revenue to the
State.
That is a limit to the point
of diminishing terms.
575
25% but
not 40%
to 60%.
Not right. Do you
have
any information
which you could provide to the
Committee that would
substantiate
that a quarter of royalty
maximizes
return
to the State or we
just
>> sure that got
uh that's an excellent question.
Why, why 25%
if, if
uh
I think what
we, one of the things we're trying to
do is is stay competitive
with Texas. We know that
there's a
golden goose out there
for New Mexico. And so and
gas providing
massive percentage of
our state's uh
budget and
paying for, for schools and
all the rest. And we want to be
sensitive to that.
Uh We
asked for
permission to charge up to
30 percent rating.
Uh Yes.
Uh
We think that that would have had
places uh in this
body. II, I think
we down we want to be respectful
of the fact that we need to
keep to your point.
We need to keep New Mexico
uh competitive with
Texas and
make sure that we're one of the first places
that companies wanna produce
homes.
>> But Mr. Chairman Mr.
L, we do not
know whether
25% is a
competitive rate
in New Mexico or not
because of the
differences
in State
income taxes,
the regulatory
environment,
uh royalty rans
all come
into play and
they are substantially
different.
20
New Mexico and
Texas.
So those
bits are the
while 25%
of all and raised as
I pretty
much the standard
in Texas, there
are other
factors in New Mexico
that do increase
substantial,
the cost of doing
business.
Now, one last question,
how many State
papers are one
the lease
current?
>> May I have that data with me
here? Give me one
second
currently under Lese
General acreage
lease Aster
Chair and
we have about
1.9 million
acres, 1.8
million of which are
under these
four oil
and gas. The other 100,000
approximately are for other
minerals in the
sand gravel
uhle
unit. And if I might uh
represent Scott, I, I would just add
that.
Of course, we don't know the effect
of, of what you
see at a 25% rating
will be, no one
has to bid on
that track doesn't
sell, you know,
the worst come back to the land
office,
lease it again. Uh
at 20% we do have
some violence here. No one is
being uh
forced by anything
uh more expensive than
they want to,
>> which from the time value.
Understand one Mr.
Chair would have an
effect in State
revol.
>> Uh Sure that
uh yes, it would, but
we can turn around and
release that the next, the very
next month. So hopefully
it would be just a small impact in terms
of time value. Again,
as I explain to Senator
Shaon, um
we know we're giving out a few
millions, a few
million dollars this year
by not by not leasing
uh best tracks. We're
still lea substantial
number of other tracks
in. And
uh we know when we release
these premium tracks,
uh they will, they
will sell, sell for top
dollar. As you mentioned.
It's, it's really about these private
equity folks now trying to come
into New Mexico, establish land
position
and
we see what, you know,
publicly available information, we
see what uh
sells in our,
our line close
bidding and many
of these companies overbid by millions of
dollars to uh
get a half
section.
>> So, um
to, to finish my previous
question, Mr. Chairman Mr.
Bloom, we've got
1.88 T
acres of the lease.
How many acres would be
impacted by the
steamboats?
>> Yeah,
Mr. Chair representative, I'm sorry, how many
acres will be impacted
by >> this new
office?
>> Uh Sheriffs in a
sky. Uh
at this point, we're
probably
talking
to tens of thousands of
acres. Uh We
do not have
much premium acreage
left to lease.
Uh You put your finger
on it and you said
uh the tracks
that, that we'll be leasing
be to fill in sorts
of tracks. Um
A lot of times those are the
tracks that are dominated.
There might be uh
40 acres or
80 acres uh
kind of stranded somewhere that
somebody wants to bring it
into a unit.
Uh
And so they would, they would dominate
this. We put it up.
Um You, you've
seen the map that many
times that I showed today,
we just don't have
much Aage pre married.
Those, those tracks are held
very dearly
by oil
and gas companies and they, they
keep the by production and wish
they were coming back, but they
don't tend to.
>> So Mr. Chairman
Mr. Bloom, you to
have a fix
number there
of how many acres would be
impacted. But she did
bring up a point that is
so concerned. The industry
has understand
it from several operators
to the State land office
is now
trying to determine
whether or not stricter
production is economically
viable and
in circumstances where it
is determined by the
land office to
not be economically
viable.
Those wells have been ported
shut in and
plugged
and which
would have the secondary
effect of
making
this a
no longer
HPP
and now available to be
released.
Um Could you address those
concerns >> or is that
so in an interesting time, I'd
rather not go
>> into a stripper world
instead that you're talking
about
world out for
>> insurance,
Mr. J.
Those gra
traps are in some
circumstances currently
being held
by whales. That would
be
considered
that if they are in
fact showing in and
plugged
many premium
tracks available
for least
admire rates.
So certainly does
have a very honest conversation,
but I hope
held us back from lunch
long enough. Thank
him as a Chair.
Thank you,
Mr.
Thank you very much Scott and I
appreciate that.
Uh >> next >> step. Uh
hopefully >> briefly
catch
>> the only ones to >> have the best lunch,
I guess so,
Mr. Jared. Thank you very
much
>> more. >> We do that. I will, I
will be second to the
least
somebody's behind
um, Mr.
Chair and the Assistant Commissioner
Bloom. Thank you so much.
Um It was stated earlier
than this has been seen a couple
of times when it's really been seen
legislative five
times or so. Has it been
presented last 55
years?
>> Uh, uh,
Mr. Chair Senator,
uh II, I think
I'm not certain how
many times the bill has
gone in front of the legislature. I don't believe
it spent every year with the commissioner
has been at the land
office for six years, but I think
there were three good,
good strong attempts to get
across the.
Ok.
>> Mr. Jarron
Christian Bloom. Thank you. Thank you for that
answer. Um
Couple of questions
here. We're
talking about the prime acreage.
That is roughly 1%
of the total leased acreage, which
will make it roughly 2000
acres. Is that ballpark?
I know we discussed that just
a little bit now,
but, >> uh,
Mr. Chair Senator,
uh,
is, is, is determined
by, by factors that
are actually set out
by, by the, by the legislature.
It's, it's a sparring system. Uh,
three of them are
geological to tend to be
more
economic
in their outlook
and how we for the tracks.
Um And so
at any given time, how many
primer we have
depends on what,
what's, uh, what's come
back to the
land office, say somebody
made rents and comes
back or
uh,
production, uh,
expires
and, uh, are coming to
report the production
and uh, they
didn't know it expire. We
can, well,
at least expires so board. So we
just don't know what's out there.
Um, but I would say this is the, the
tens of thousands of
acres,
acres. We can
have
>> Mr. Chair, just commissioner.
Thank you for that. Um
Just a little question on how we
got to the 15%
overall. Your
15% royalty rate
average is that figure
on barrels produced
or is that a total
acreage
leased across the
State? >> Mr.
Chair Senator? Great
question.
Uh
We look
at the volume
of oil that's
produced oil and gas that's produced
at the stage
multiply that
by the
price then, and then we
figure we
look at the loyalties we
receive and
we, we divide
uh
production,
we divide that number by the production
value and begin the average of
percentage. Um
So it's around 15
7%
>> Mr. Chair and the
extra glim. So that that
would essentially be a
function. It's kind of
both end of, of acres
leased that of of barrels
because really what
we have is the prime acreage
that is in production is probably
a lot closer to the
20%. And
we figure the average
acreage, you know,
for wildcatters or,
or whatever across the
State with that
acreage figured in
and the amount of royalty that comes off
of that, that would
extremely
way on the lower side
of the 15%.
Correct. >> Mr. Chair. Give you a
better and more clear example.
Uh imagine
that the value of oil and gas from
State trust land is $15
billion. If we received
enroll payments, 1.5
billion, that would be an average
royalty rate of 10%.
Correct.
So that's
essentially what we need to get that,
that 15% figure.
Um In fact, at one
point, it was a little, a little bit
higher. It's not down a little bit. It
must have been some more production
from uh
lands that were leased out
at 12.5%. These
are available World Series
currently are 12.5%
16.67%
18.75
point
>> okr it up here real
quick, Mr.
Jared. Couple
maybe two more quick questions
representing or
represent, excuse me, Assistant
Commissioner Bloom.
Uh
when
we're applying the new
25%
would it be applied to those
canceled leases that
Representative Scott
had
to Mr. >> Chair
Senator?
Uh not
necessarily. So the
question is, would
canceled lease
that comes back to us, would
it automatically
uh be
leased leased out again?
25%
not automatically.
And in fact, it was likely
wouldn't, was the land that comes
back to us
as
an expired or cancel is
from
uh
the, the parts
of, uh, land
office lands that, that aren't the best.
Frankly, that's what we get the most
back of, uh, best
lands that ever treasure. They hardly
ever have production
lapses. Uh,
most of the stuff we get
back, not the
best and May or May not
be, you know, it has to be
that if they see piece of
20 or 25% so
serve of
20%.
>> Um, Mr. Chair
and Mr.
Bloom,
how many leases
has the study planned office
canceled in the last,
maybe a tough question, how
many leases have been canceled in the
last 12 months?
And is that number
increasing
or remaining
roughly flat over the last
say six
years?
>> Mr. Chair,
Senator, I'll just
read these numbers and we can figure
out they're going here,
um,
in February of this
year, we got
5904
leases
on Friday. We had
5932.
So we're about 28
pieces from February
and
>> that's
Mr. Jared Mr.
Blue, that just
VC, the stating
the to the total number
of leases that includes both
canceled and issued
two leases.
>> Yeah.
Yes. Uh
Senator, uh, not
quite sure. I follow you there, but,
um, I'm saying that, uh,
the total number of leases we
have. So we leased
out more than
we've, uh, had,
uh, chance that are expired through
the past
eight months >> and
I'll just leave this. I know that we
probably don't have the information here.
But uh Mr.
Chair
Measure, I would
just, and maybe we
could circle up after, but I
would just like to see the trajectory
of canceled leases to see
that if the driver
for this is
potentially going to be used for
punitive triggers to cancel
leases on, you know,
various interactions
or something like that and see
those canceled leases
would be increasing and
therefore they, we have the opportunity to
least with a higher rate
later.
>> I would be glad to do that.
And uh you know,
uh we say one
other thing to, to this point
that we're somehow trying to claw back
these in an unfair
manner from industry.
Uh One of the things that uh
the Mogan IP and M
is to do is to
put online
every month in a, in a PDF
file
copies of all
the letters we sent out to
Leti saying that um
their lease is going to be
canceled or has
expired.
And we
do that because
there are
many, many wells
on leases
that, that are held
by non listing
operators. So company
owns the lease, then
companies B CD and
E uh will have
wells on
that on that lease.
And those might be from
contracts from
10 years ago or 40
years ago. Sometimes there's no
communication
between the operator and
the West seat. And,
and so what we did was
wanted to alert operators
to this and then, and
they see that at least
danger of
cancellation respiration,
they can go out call
this less, maybe be somebody
that, that passed away or
maybe they didn't, they didn't get,
they had changed our address with
us so they can work on
this to get that rent
paid. Um
If we were simply
interested in bringing
back all the ignorance we could
uh we wouldn't
do that. We want things to work
officially at the land office and it seem
like a very reasonable request
from enroll to us.
And so we did it and
in order to answer Mr.
Scott's question,
uh I
uh
our well, commercially viable,
we do send out uh
pay quantities, letters
tasking comes
to justify their will
uh is still producing
in a commercially, commercially
viable uh
way. And it's not just
one. Well, it's actually for the entire
lea so if there's five
wells out there, we add up all
the, all production on it
and we've sent out
about 12,
maybe 15 of these
paint on these letters. I
think the last
six months right here.
So they're, they're pretty rare.
It's a pretty,
um, tough analysis
to do frankly. And so
it's my staff to do a lot of
them,
>> Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you, Senator. Uh,
last up we heard
Townend.
>> Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank
you for, we spoke and I think
Senator Spot has brought
up
where the industry is of this
particular.
>> Sorry,
>> let me try to get that
better. Ok,
I apologize.
Um It, it's been
brought up uh
about where the industry
is on this particular
measure. Of course,
today. And
um uh
IP A NM,
the independent group that
represents producers
in, in New Mexico.
Have they taken a position on
this
>> Mr. Chair, Representative Townsend?
Yes, ID and M uh
has taken a position
on this bill and they always
stand up
and >> Committee.
Absolutely.
>> So the industry
of 300
I think there's about 300
Members of IP A and the
folks and you
have the Moga
has how many
Members?
>> Uh Mr. Chair
Senator, I, I'm not
aware of how many
Members.
>> It's, it's just over
1000
and two of 1000
have stood
up in this important
this
just to bring in the person
back to the >> reminded.
I not
desperate,
>> um
get this piece of
Legislation
were pass
and 25%
was the new
rate with
these
premium leases
immediately on
sale.
>> Uh Mr. Chair Representative
Council, uh all
these leases would
not be
go for sale or go for
sale at once.
Um
Trying to keep this brief II I
believe you're all aware that
the land office
funds itself
based off
of
money it earns that goes into
the maintenance file, essentially
a stream of money that
um
gets immediately distributed to our
beneficiaries. So
uh call it $100 million a
year, we take out
20 $30 million for our
budget.
Uh
We try to
uh sell
those leases
uh in a way that
that spreads it out
over time so that
we know we can
always,
they pay for our, our
budget there at times in the
past. Uh We
didn't have many tracks left
to sell, for example, back
when I we were working at the end of the
power registration 2012 to
2014, uh we
were really scraping bottom of the barrel to find
some decent tracks to put out there.
And so we needed to ration
now. Still still >> kind of
rationing.
>> Thank you for
that
one.
Will these leases,
will the sale of these
leases be
dependent on the
price of
oil and natural
gas or is it
more dependent
on the percentage
royalty that the State
May
receive?
>> Mr. Chair representative?
The whether
or not we release it, say
25%
20% or lower rate be
based on an
evaluation of
the geology
score for three factors
there and a couple other factors
related to
um
what tracks we're selling
for in that area. Currently
they're doing well. It's a hot area
sales
and how much
the uh nearby wells
>> PD
that
>> Mr. Chairman
and I appreciate
it. I think you
will.
I'm kind of surprised uh
along the lines
of Senator
Cervantes
that the analysis
of current
price versus
royalty rates. I
mean, how is
the State of New Mexico?
How is the student,
the child in the State of New
Mexico? They
asked to
um
Bream
and when
I believe when you, when this
decision was made
to withhold these
leases prices
were really at a premium
and they have slid a little
bit and
they May slide a little bit
more.
But
to address the issue
of representing the
Children of New Mexico,
it just seems like it's a shot
in the dark that
it's gonna be better
in the long run without
actually
um
saying that you're going to
limit the sale
until the price
reaches a certain
mark
or
the role need to reach a certain
mark and,
and just holding out and saying
I'm not gonna sell it
unless we get this
without
contemplating
the risk associated
just seems to be short
sighted and I
would just offer that.
But I believe
that
to this
panel because it's
very
interesting
to recognize that
the industry has taken
the position
and I just didn't wanna
leave here today with,
with the
premise that the
industry didn't care. That
is not the case. Thank
you, Mr. J. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative Townsend
and thank you. Uh
I just
wanted to know that presenting
this bill last year
was really never questioned
in these premium.
There's never question
that these
framers would demand
this price that they would
uh people who need
it
first.
So I think that market is
there and I
think the legal
mandate of us
maximizing return on
our trust assets
is there and
those two things should come
together. So thank you very
much, Mr. MLO. Uh
can be done with us after
lunch. We are going to break
it to lunch. Our lunch is
apparently right
here somewhere
to
and we'll be back at
130. So we're gonna
have to, to a half
hour we restart
every one third. Uh
If that, that
was
>> great
Dr
put
together
and
this
today
to
go with, in
fact,
severance,
you know, are
they
function
that the world is toxic?
This
thank
you.
So
that
thank
you
right
up my
ass.
They say 20% taxes
space
separate or
red
so
severed and second.
Pretty
like
that.
That's
so none of those they can find
one.
Those
I
the fir I voted
for it in Committee
and on
the
so
that these guys straighted out the
I
Yeah, the essential
guitarist's
Yeah.
One of the
major
and this does it
Rockman
you want?
That's,
that's
yes
fighting.
That's why.
Ok.
Ok.
I was glad to talk,
check.
Ok.
Oh, that's
great.
So,
so
that
and set up
there wasn't very
much,
it was a B set up.
So,
so,
mm,
I like you guys
but
let's start. We I yeah,
like
so.
Hi sir. Can you hear
me?
61?
>> video is on
and audio is
on
mm
Testing, testing, testing
my
microphone,
anything on your end
with my
audio,
>> the
books and and that
is not.
Go
ahead.
I can >> hear
conversation
>> that.
Mm
All
right.
I like
it.
That.
No,
no
that's just one
tooth's
>> let me share my
screen.
>> 1312.
Well, I'll be able
to
and more
than
a
it sounds good.
12
C
>> one.
You guys hear me
yet?
>> 12
when
one
I
have
it.
Yeah,
I think they do. Let me add
that.
So my
last
I think
that
12
I just have a
side
they seem to
be
but
it
jobs
and
so 1
2000
I
have.
All
right.
So
uh she's a little bit
more
so
that
let's
see
but
yeah
about
I
ask
which
is
but
a big
not.
Oh
that
so I
just
yeah,
seven
2%.
Thanks
sir.
So
well
the
yeah,
so
that
mhm
I
saw
so
that's
awful
but I wish I have
no
also most of the most
of
Oh
ok
and
also
so
yes.
Um
yeah.
00 it's, it's, it's
the best
thing.
Uh what kind of
a
mhm.
I
am a sort of saying
that.
So,
so
>> testing microphone.
How does that sound?
>> What I
didn't
uh
testing, >> testing
123.
>> Uh
>> Fantastic.
>> Mm.
Oh
Guitar
J
support
all
and
to talk
about.
So
um
so,
so
OK,
but it
was
the
department
Sandberg
to
just.
Mm
Yeah,
it,
yes,
so
I,
we have
got
two.
Ok.
It's
that,
no.
Oh,
well the guy he's
coming in the,
but I'm wondering, you
know,
trying to find,
if, if
I were
there
that a lot of fast,
I just heard this in the
coming.
Yeah.
What are you trying to do
for
you on
the
swum?
Testing,
testing,
testing,
testing,
testing.
That.
Hello,
this is
mhm.
Hello.
That
um
we
get
and
uh
so
are regretted.
I think this,
it started
uh
just
food
>> and so we did quite get back
to one versions.
Uh
145
we will go.
It's a, our
first, our first
channel set up there
is
oil and gas or c
setbacks, oil and
gas boils.
Uh
We've lost most of our convey
lunch. Hopefully they'll be back
soon. Uh We'd like
to share that
the
I did
uh
nicely the
LC staff
to join us today.
They've done a study on
effects. Uh and
we were told they were
available and I
am
um
frustrating
um fact
that
so, um
we, we don't have that benefit,
which is unfortunate and
we might talk more about that
in the back. So,
um
start up generally in the
order of the
um,
I
and not, and I believe
Michael Lumpkin is on
too. Is
that
right?
Right. Ok. So
Mister Min,
uh
we only have an hour for
this panel and we have
five speakers. So you
keep your comments to
the, you know, 5 to 7 minutes
range. Um So
we have time for questions
So please go
ahead.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
>> Chairman.
>> Uh Let me test and make sure that
everyone can hear me on your
end.
>> So
>> Mr. Chairman, can everyone hear me
on that
end?
>> Yes, we can hear
you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
Members of the Water and Natural
Resources Committee. I thank
you for the opportunity to speak
with you this afternoon.
It's my pleasure to address
the application of
best available scientific
methods and best
available science to decisions
that are related to oil and gas
production setbacks
and the protection of public
health.
By way of introduction, my
name is Dr Mike Lumpkin.
I'm a board certified senior
toxicologist at
CTEH.
I first want to share a bit about my
career in toxicology
and human health risk assessment
related to the
protection of public
health. I
earned a phd in toxicology
in 2002.
During which I also served
in a public health capacity
for the first time as
a volunteer firefighter
while completing my graduate
work. I
have over 22 years of experience
in the practice of toxicology
and risk assessment, which includes
five years co-author
chemical risk assessments for the
US CPA, the
CDC and the Department of
Defense. I have over
10 years of experience as
an emergency response
toxicologist with
CTEH and
over six years of experience
designing and overseeing
studies of chemical
exposures and
associated occupational
and public health
risks.
Throughout this career,
I've worked to protect public health
and the communities I've
worked in across the United
States, including the
communities in Colorado
where my family presently
resides. As a
scientist, I
rely on quality data
that is both specific
local, relevant
contemporary focused
and robust to make
determinations
and evaluate human health
risks.
Today, I'd like to talk about the
importance of using best
available science for policy
decisions that affect public
health, specifically
determination of setback
distances for new
oil and well uh
gas well
development.
I'll first speak to the
frameworks that represent
the best available science to
evaluate oil and
gas development and health
effects as well as
what we've learned so far about
safe setbacks using these
frameworks. I'll then
speak to how New Mexico
can apply these frameworks
to develop effective
policy based
on the best available
science.
So human health risk assessment
is a process that
we as risk assessors use
to identify whether or
not there exists a
risk that we need to be
concerned about and need to
manage quality
risk assessments matter.
Because it is this
science based data
that policymakers
such as yourselves,
serving as risk
managers need to
make public health decisions
that are themselves based
on the best available
science. Today,
I'll focus on the exposure
assessment portion of
the risk assessment process
which is defined as the
extent to which a population
May come into contact
with the chemicals of
interest.
Questions that exposure
scientists risk risk
assessors asked to determine
if health risks from a
source release
needs to be managed?
Include the
following one.
What are the sources
themselves?
How do the released chemicals
mov'e and change in the
environment once they are
released?
Who might be exposed
and to what levels, how
often and for how long
are those populations
or communities exposed?
We couple the answers
to these questions with our
understanding of how potent the
chemicals are to produce
adverse effects
and erring On the side
of caution, we calculate
the likelihood that exposed
populations May
experience actual
harm. This
science based framework has been
used and endorsed by
regulatory agencies for
decades and is
continuously being
improved by best
available scientific
methodologies.
So, studies that are
used to estimate exposure
and risk can be
divided into two types of
studies. One,
those that rely on methods
based on assumptions about
exposure and
two, those relying on methods
that actually measure the
exposure. The
former method defines an
assumed exposure to
something. While the latter
measures the exposure
itself, the
former assumes that there is an
exposure coming from i
unidentified source.
While the latter can actually
specify the source of
exposure,
the former assumes the
processes creating the
exposure are the same
today as when the
study was conducted.
While the latter incorporates
information on contemporary
practices and
processes.
In the end studies that
rely on assumed
exposures May be useful
for identifying a
possible exposure
disease association,
but they stop well short
of showing disease
causation which is what we
want to know.
However, studies based on
actual measurements provide
key data that are necessary
to scientifically
determine the
evidence or lack
of disease
causation
studies that use distance
to wells as an assumed
exposure or
report airborne chemical
levels from obsolete
industry practices
suffer from the vast
uncertainties built
into their assumptions.
Further systematic
review of these studies
using
despite a review of these studies,
um using
rigorous scientific
methods have shown
them to be fraught with
assumptions both
on exposure on the
confounders of effects
and inconsistent seasoning
incoherence in
the results among
studies and within studies
that would preclude them
as the final basis
of a sound public
health
policy.
On the other hand, studies
that have been published
by public health scientists
from State of Colorado,
the State of Pennsylvania,
He I Energy
uh Scientific
Scientific Group, all
report reviews of the
science as a
whole rather
than as
individual um
or
individually selected
studies. Unlike
taking one study's conclusion
in isolation, these
reviews considered important
factors like the quality of the
science to answer
questions about the exposure
directly from oil and gas
versus other contributing
factors.
These study authors have found
that there is not consistent,
strong evidence of
increased spec
specific health outcomes
ranging out to miles
from oil and gas development
sites. When we connect
this information with
actual measured data
and what we know about the
chemicals of potential
concern coming
from oil and gas production.
It's not surprising that we don't
see consistent
of evidence of
harm
with this understanding of the
frameworks leveraging
the best available science. Let's
look at examples of how New
Mexico can apply these
frameworks to develop
effective public health
policy.
An example of an already
existing set of data
is the NME DB
TECH special monitoring
project. This
program includes an air monitoring
station in Carlsbad
just northwest of
the President present
Boater air monitoring
site which is down in loving
the system reports high
frequency continuous
data that
can cause of
of oil and gas development emissions
that can cause health
effects
under sufficiently high
exposure
conditions.
If we look at these data
and correctly averaging
the average them
using appropriate methods
that have been accepted by
various regulatory agencies.
They can be used in the risk assessment
framework to determine
if a potential risk of adverse
health fix actually
exists
as an example in the case
of the benzene levels measured
by the NM AD project
over a two month span. At
the end 2023
average benzene levels
designed to protect
against adverse short term
health effects
even in susceptible
individuals.
As shown by the dotted
line here on the
graph at nine parts
per billion at the
top.
Further, if these measured
levels were to persist
in time, they would
not be sufficient to reach
safe, to reach
even the safe long term exposure
levels as indicated by the
dash line shown on the
graph at three parts per
billion. Additional
air monitoring programs
that are paired with rigorous
risk assessment of
the monitoring data would be
useful for specifically
characterizing
processes and the
community air quality
in New Mexico
communities.
And I would encourage
collaboration
um among scientists
across various groups
that are performing error monitoring
to evaluate
the the data together and
transparently and
apply them in the
appropriate risk assessment
framework that we've been talking
about.
So to conclude my
presentation, there's an
opportunity here now
to leverage best available
science to inform the
best back distance
policies for New
Mexico,
I pointed out that published
reviews of health outcome
studies of assumed
exposures have shown them to
be largely inconsistent,
lacking cohesiveness of
findings and thus
unreliable to show causal
evidence that oil and
gas emissions
cause specific adverse
health outcomes in
communities that have been
studied,
measure exposure data
collected in communities near
oil and gas development in New
Mexico and other states.
Along with formal
risk assessments have
shown chemicals not to
have been
at levels of concern
for their
thex to community Members
performance of additional
studies of actual
measurement and risk assessment
analysis in New Mexico
would reduce the
scientific
uncertainty
that goes behind setting
setback distances
but possibly more importantly,
reduce the public concern
over potential health
impacts.
So policy that
mandates a prescriptive
one size fits all
setback is not
a public health policy that's
based on the best
available science.
But processes using
established frameworks
would allow best available
science to inform public
policy to protect
the health of new Mexican
citizens. Mr.
Chairman and Committee. Thank
you so much for your
attention.
>> Thank you for that next step. We'll have
a great uh and for
the rest of the pan will begin
for about 5 to 7
minutes.
Do you mind if I myself
the last,
I don't have a tremendous amount
of data to
show
and we'll skip over to you for
now. Uh
Doctor
Coen.
Yes. Hello everybody.
Thank you for giving me the
opportunity to
share
us work to
do
so.
And
yes, so
I thank you.
So
I'd like to emphasize
that this word
also of this
and
from three different
universities, you
guys?
Yeah.
OK. So this entails
study
that
Mexico is
about seven
miles
on southeast
of Tulsa
and it's the upper left
corner.
You,
hey doctor, I'm gonna interrupt
you for a second. Do you be
happy or in
now.
No, we don't
have to be able
to
see
or
so. So we don't have it in
front of us. So you have to
turn your ps around
and doctor, you're
gonna need to speak of
it. You have our time
here.
OK? We'll try to
up a little bit more, a little bit closer.
Um, so
what you see here on the screen
is a map of the area
where we conducted the
study. It's
Mexico uh
78
miles south
of
and this
one program run
for a full year of
April last
year remain this year
and we deployed
life sensitive
and regulatory
rided rated
um money calling equipment.
That's the same dialogue
on equipment that's used by
State agencies of the
EPA. And I believe
it's the most extensive
number in terms of the
number of money and
the language of the
study and monitoring
study that's been conducted in
New Mexico
and all the
data with the public
and real time on the
website.
That's the monitoring
trailer
sign
um to the
findings and that's,
that's been picking up
some attention. I
just to run
class ago. You have
seen
online public education
labels thee
in Mexico Town,
the needs first in
downtown L A.
So how did they also come
to that conclusion? I'm gonna
go through this
now with a number
of slides and this
conclusion mostly
concerns Muslim
pollution.
Um
We
reported through this
webinar at all and presentations,
the highest Muslim
levels that have ever been
reported in
Mexico
and also show that
the cost of
the
most driven by all
the specials.
So why are we so
concerned about the
ozone ozone is a
strong
damages
tissue. And
for that reason, it's been regulated
by the Clean Air Act
for more than 50 years.
Elevated levels of
ozone cause
spread chest
pain, wheezing.
Um So all together
respiratory
infection, crepy
ailments
increased risk.
Asthma epa
estimates that every year
of the number of 5 to
6000 people
die from Chile,
the United States
due to elevated
ozone and
elderly athletes
and Children are
the groups that are most
susceptible
to elev elevated
ozone, especially people
who work and spend a
lot of
time.
So this shows
year five
ozone monitoring
data and
it's the same data. But on
the left side and
plotting the raw data,
monumental resolution.
On the right side, this
data has been average to
eight hour averages.
And we find out the
features in here. First
of all, you can see that the
oone is mostly elevated in the
summer months and it
drops in the winter
was back up next
summer, it goes up and
down a lot every
day. It was up and
down. It's very, very dynamic
as you mov'e from one
to our
average leader, it looks
like the levels are
lower and that's certainly
an effect of average the
data. Most
regulatory data
consider our
average leader. So it
kind of method,
the tiny
concentrations, it's
important to
realize that you need
our
theater
or averages that
actually
actual levels that
the population is exposed
to a New York Times,
you can be significantly
higher.
And the clicker
here
where you gonna be
um
can mov'e forward
side. I on
this is
OK. Um
So who was on this
regular needed?
Um What I put on here
is the start five
first, that's the
EPA national
and get air quality
standard
set 70
parts per billion for the
a own standard.
So that's the data of the
light. You can see
that in Loving,
that
line will succeeded many,
many, many times. So
the 70 PB is the level
that is protected
of public health.
Um What's,
what's important to
realize that
that pre
and health standard
um doesn't quite
meet up with other countries,
considers safe
level of exposure,
for instance, the
Union,
Japan
and the standard of 60
possibil
public health. And in
Canada, it's 50
possible. So the
United States actually has a
better that
less
than these other
nations.
So um
here you don't need to
look at all these numbers
on the left side,
the ranked highest
boson days in
2023
the right side ranked
highest boson days.
2024
is me and
loving. And
it's list
by the
height of the ozone
recording and then
State.
And I want
to point out that in
2023
Lovinger
31 days
where the national
alcohol standard
was
in 2024.
We observe only six
days when that
was if
you take the mean
of these or
for the, that's the
four
year that was used
by the EPA
regular oil purposes
to get a value of
86.8
million that four R
and that's important, important
value because
that compliance
with the
national,
this is a map that I told
from an EPA website
that shows the
areas within the country
that currently no
attain the
O on standard. And there
are different classifications
that from water to
bar to
severe and
serious
and, and you can see the
areas that suffer the
most entire Muslim
or color included
here. Um But
where we are in Loving, there's
no classification.
So the New
Mexico South
Falls,
but
it's not yet been
designated as honor
to
area.
I think that 86
P PB
value and put it in
this table. And this is
from a website
that lists the
highest average
boson values in all these non
attained areas.
So on the map and
actually Loving would
fall in fifth place.
Loving would be the fifth
most
area in the State the
nation has when.
So that it would have the
86. So
so it
would be the
highest on
the area in all
of the United States among
all 51
areas that are
followed by the EPA. It's
being not
obtained. The
also national
and
standard.
This is a, a really
interesting
graphic getting from the
EPA
that shows all the locations
where bosons monitor,
data reported to the
EPA. Now these
that in all the
ozone
and this monitoring
has been going up or
going down. So the
getting better or
getting worse
point down.
I here that
ozone has been declining.
Just go, that's what we
want, boson went
down. Um
There were
also the
better health
population. There are
very areas
who are on the trend,
eyes general
tendencies. See
in the nation, you can
see that the calls,
but Omon is one of the
very few place
country
but also has
increased. And
as a matter of fact, it's the
only station in the United
States where ozone
levels are above the
national AMBI quality
standard and where
the ozone has
been
what I presented now
in a number of slides
comparison of
the data
observations from
Larry measurements
been doing at the same time,
the Colorado
these yellow a
show the monitoring
locations that are
North Northwest
Denver and
what is in Boulder?
And this monitoring programs
were implemented by local
governments because
of the citizens concerns
about air quality
and this area is he
impacted by initiatives
from oil and gas operations
that are indicated by
these dos
that are all reflect
oil and gas windows either
operating or
permitted. Will
be another
soars
loving with the data
in these four locations.
The Northern Colorado
projects. Now the
Colorado front
the data here in blue
and an area that's in
serious non
with the O center,
the love indicator on the left
side as this
shows me
curter in 2023
that the whole and
was so
the love in the of foreign
says
the
length of exceedance
minutes or hours that
were
running
from.
So where this is
coming from
doctor, so
I need you, I'm gonna need you
to get your presentation
short. You're on
pace for another 10 minutes if
we don't have that talk.
So how much
time to
be? >> We provided
>> a guideline at five to seven
minutes or 10. >> Right.
>> But I apologize when I was
invited, I was
there for 15 minutes.
If, if you could >> just
sort of hit the, the highlights
and ramp up, >> I'd
appreciate it.
Um I'm more than halfway through,
so I'll, I'll try to speed up a
little bit. Um
This slide
demonstrates
shows the
uh the of
ozone in this
philosophy as a function
of wind speed. And
um it shows very clearly
that the high ozone in line
is mostly transported
on the southeast, but
much lower ozone levels
from moss
and from
the um
and the rest of the world
so that,
you know, is
admitted, but it's in the
atmosphere from
the organ
compounds
outside.
So I want to show you some
but they want to why we have
such in
this area itself
cos that this
compares
the
one of those
or
loving with
the data on the other
side and
you can barely see the
other leader because they
very, very, very at the
bottom. So I wrote this
up for
graphs
and so you can ei
easier
different
um how the
ethane and the oil and
gas trees are loving
compared to
gluons
solid sense fail.
And they see the
cur because they're
solu and very
bottom.
So if you compare
um eth as one
of these organ
compounds with the
water side, that's the
distribution
of the data,
what to point out
of and
the exposure
benzene in this
area as well be
in the come along
as
well, safe levels,
benzene identifying.
And they on this
here again,
compare to
be lobby
size
uh and the
statistical
distribution of pen
and loving.
So we do a
maat comparison
with we don't
have as much
pensin and
loving
as
and I
comparison
methane, those
are new
methane is to play.
This is methane
and loving
again. And it's hard
to see like here in the
same feel
the methane of suspicious
loving that
those long on the
boder, it looks like
it
reason is that the the
in this is very,
very, very bottom.
Um I
can barely ski
very low
Mexico
like ozone. You also
need Nether
side
that
side level. I think
that's really remarkable
and that was one of the
biggest surprises people
to do. Um
Looking at this bar graph
again, you see that
sites loving
on average higher
and a lot of side
and it's remodeling
Cosme
resolves from
combustion.
It's not, you know,
emitted
leakage of vapers,
but it required
burning of rain.
And if you compare the
population
some
where den that's about a
factor of 300
different and
much higher
population density and
much higher population
Denver and not even
less than Knox
side to see the
water is lower
than the far less
densely
in the
area in.
And that the
presentation as a
summary
or
that so
acknowledged that the study
was funded by the
health. And
thank you.
Thank you. Thanks. So,
Josie,
>> thank you, Chairman and representatives.
My name is Josie Zuniga.
I'm an organizer and a member
of Youth United for Climbing
Cres Action. I'm
22 years old. I live
in the Permian Basin region,
more specifically Eddie
County and I'm the daughter
of a royal worker.
Today. I'm here to speak on
behalf of a one mile
setback around schools.
Currently, there are only
800 wells within a mile
of schools. This is 800
wells out of above
70,000 productive
wells in the State. We
are asking that the State prohibit
more wells around schools
and we ask the new production
to occur at least a mile from
the schools. This is not a
huge ask. It is a
small ask, but we do a lot
to protect the health of the Children
in New Mexico. This bill
would not halt production or
cripple the industry.
It would simply be an of
protection for our Children
to make sure that no ruc
occurs in their school.
I am proud to live in this beautiful
State full of beautiful people,
land and culture and I'm
proud to call the land of enchantment
my home when it comes to
beautiful people the most beautiful
of assaults are Children.
Several peer-reviewed studies
have shown that proximity to oil
and gas production can be
detrimental to the health that
we currently.
There are about 34,000
Children across the entire
State who go to school with
at least one oil and gas.
Well, within one mile of
the, in some counties
like Lee, there are
28 there are
28 students, there are
28 schools with at
least one Oiler Gospel
within one mile of the school
in Carlsbad, there are students of
six schools all within
at least one mile.
Some schools
have more than one well
surrounding them, for example.
And Loevy ages came through 12
local 41 property.
Approximately 647
Children attend these
schools from the school.
There are 48 wells within a one
mile radius of the schools
and there are four wells within a half
mile radius. The closest is
0.44 miles
which is only a short walk
away. Studies
show that Children who have more
distance between them and production
are less likely to become
ill compared to Children who are
closer and have a higher
probability. There is a
variety of illnesses that
Children can be exposed to
some symbol of respiratory
infections at a higher
risk of asthma. More
dangerous illnesses like cancer
are also a possibility
on a local scale. You
May hear people talking about
their need signals in time
struggling with asthma or
experiencing bloody doses
regularly. As you
heard today, the recent
air quality monitoring project has
identified very poor air
quality in the loving area.
And many of these pollutants that
have been identified are hell
harming pollutants. I have
a hard time believing that any one
person in this room doesn't
have our children's best interests
in mind. Science is not
fearmongering or an extremist
political idea. The ask
for setbacks themselves is not
political but is a public
health protection ta and
asking you to support a one
mile setback around schools.
Listen to science and come
together for the Children of New Mexico.
Thank
you
>> very much. Uh
Colin
Cox.
>> Thank you.
Morning, good afternoon
Chair.
My name is Colin Cox from the Center for
Biological University.
I'm here to talk
to
the,
I'm Colin Cox. I'm, I'm
the center for biological diversity.
I'm here to talk about the need for
a one mile setback
public schools.
And before I begin my
remarks real
quick, I would like to draw
the
attention um
to cteh
uh the Doctor Doctor
Lumpkins
operation.
I believe the President here was requested
by Novoa
today,
Committee Members of the kind of the Google
CTE HS recommendation.
Um for example,
there's a New York Times article
2010 on June 18th.
The title is Record
of V PS Gulf Work Testing
firm raises conflict of interest
questions. Um
They quote toxicologists
familiar with CT HS
work saying
that CT ac
th is quote paid
to say that everything is
OK.
Another article
even more recently, the Colorado
newsline in September
1420 was
titled oil companies rely on
the contro controversial
term to rebut
study which
was about C ce
H
setbacks.
Even a recent critic on the American
prospect in March
23. The title
is Theer Path of
the contractor monitoring the
air in East Palestine.
That article describes
a history of while
critics called
inaccurate testing.
Tilton works the corporation.
But I it
um that article also
discusses the lawsuits
that C A and the
quality of their work
and the fact that Members of the Congress
War Corporation is
not
stop the
awareness
to.
>> mhm. >> And then
I guess so there, I'd like
to began my
comments. This is my
resignation of the New Mexico
schooled by oily
gas. Um We
can start,
we heard a little bit about this from
joy.
Really? What, what I can hear
about is the
34,504
students who attended public
school within a mile of the gas
wells,
848 wells
affecting these
34,000
plus students at
roughly 90 schools
in our State. And
I want to kind of put that in perspective.
1%
of oil and alcohol
in New Mexico, over
1% are
endangering the health of over
11% of New Mexico
uh school
Children.
So let's turn off
to just have a
couple of examples surrounding the permanent.
And so
in Lee County, we talking about
28 schools surrounded
by the 400
wells 11,000
students. Eddie
Counties.
>> I do >> so, why
don't you just, she could slide
it over. So
like still too quiet. I
apologize. My
favorite. Thank you.
So Eddie County nine
schools, 4500
students
a while
elementary is a particularly
dramatic example or the
61
miles
within one mile element
school. I'd
like to turn to slide in three
looking at examples in the Santa
Mono Basin.
So in San Juan County,
44 out of 68
schools have wonderful
wells within a mile,
affecting 18 more than
18,000 students.
That's over 84%
of school Children in San
Juan County attend the
school without a month
but gas in
the Farmington Aztec and
Bloomfield school districts,
all, all 30 more
schools than a
mile.
Elementary as an example has
19 wells.
Why doesn't this? Why does this
matter?
So let's turn it slightly
more and
we will deliver this too much because we've
heard from doctor about
this ready but oil and a
production balloons
and releases
specially consider volatile
organic compounds, nitrogen
oxides but they
others
olive organic
organics is a kind of a
category ofs. There are
hundreds of chemicals
under that umbrella
that release oil and gas
production among them
Benzine, which we are
about
is is one of
hundreds.
So let's turn to the slide
five. Um
So, so one of the
peer-reviewed
epidemiologic studies
um have found
associations
between proximity
to oil and gas wells
and a lot of
negative.
Oh yeah.
So
and the greatest risks
are the Children. So of
these 50 studies
and they important, you know, residential
proximity to oil and gas wells
is leads to a pregnancy
outcomes with the
cancer
hospitalizations,
asma exacerbations
and
healths I
included in the handouts.
I'm not gonna, we don't
on this or anything right now.
We've included the
science behind the need for
setbacks that's in your
materials.
This is a
summary of some
of the studies
and there are more panco all
the time
and about the need,
but I won't go through them individually, but
I will touch on a couple of highlights.
So on slide five,
let me see a
recent study from 2023.
The Children living with a
mild as
well 5 to 7 times
the risk of
developing lymphoma,
cancer of the blood
than unexposed Children
and even Children under the
fire away
still have double the risk
of develop. Compare
to not exposed Children.
Studies have measured
higher concentrations
of air pollutants, two
miles from reproduction
levels and one mile from mixing
wells to turn
to. So six
please.
Um you know, just kind
of summarize a few of these,
you know, studies have
found
birth defects for people living
in six miles as
well.
Um and
has some exacerbations within
up to 10 miles from
wells. The low
birth weight
occurs again up to 10
miles from the wells.
Increase pre adverse
health outcomes for
up to 12 miles
of greater
harms.
Lower distances,
increased risk of low birth
weight, average, decreased
average birth weight and overall
health index for
invents
or individuals and
a half miles of record
say with elevated
risks up to two
miles.
I also want to mention that a
low birth weight and decrease
in health index can have lifelong
consequences um
for the baby
and that as that baby
becomes
ok. These
studies show that the risk
of health problems increases
greater proximity and
density of oil asphalts
around me, the closer
you are more production
there is around the greater the
harmer.
And these results are
consistent.
These results are consistent across
multiple studies from New Mexico,
Pennsylvania,
Colorado, California,
Texas, Oklahoma
and Ohio using
different methodologies in different
locations, different time
the and among diverse
spot
and they all
show
health risks for limit
to global to oil and gas
production.
Like to turn into slide.
Seven.
Just
raise awareness about this issue
is the oil and gas companies have
a really bad track
breaking the law
and earlier this
year and
the result of a joint study they've
done with the D A, they
visited 100 and 25
oil and gas sites
under the jurisdiction.
75
were illegally
ait
all or is another
thing violating
the quality and the act,
the 60%
rate. That's
just 100 and 25 sites,
55,000
plus 40
roughly $67,000
in this State for
those.
Um And
it would take a decade to visit all
55,000 of
those.
There's not a whole lot of
incentive for them
to do
better than, you know,
40% compliance or
60% viol
dictionary.
And like a please, I'll
be very quick on this one. And
so I talked a lot about
this
and this essentially
shows the dotted line is
the health that is health
standard for ozone levels.
Be county is way
way way above that line.
Lee County was also above that
line. This
is data going all the way back
to
the color version on the
web behind you is a
little bit easier to follow
my for the black and white. But
I think label and
San Juan is my color right
on the line
D to late six
months
perm Meva is getting
worse
and these numbers are permitted with these
monitoring station and a little
further from the pollution and
measuring lower numbers
than what he's team
has been like
the question
and but but it still the
same thing, right? The numbers are
unhealthy and
getting worse
slide in the lead,
please.
So this is really the
ask
um the
asking for a health and public
protection zone around public
schools just around public
schools. Currently, there
are no State wide
rules regarding health protection
zones, counties and
municipalities or electric
like this on their own.
They either have no help
buffer or plainly
inadequate buffer
to 500 ft
pointed. If you look at
the science summary we
provided and we have to provide
more information
requests. 305
100 pages doesn't have it right. There are
increased health risks for
variety of problems including child
with cancer up to one
mile, two miles even
further.
So 500 ft
buffer, not so
great.
And the point I'd like to make
is that the State is
responsible here and you've
got the power and the duty to put in
place meaningful protections for these
34,000 school
Children
while they're at school, they're more
care, the care of the State
and they exposed to
dangerous level.
It increased cancer. And
as another
because of the 800
the a that, well,
that surrounding
oil and gas productions
exploded. It's
double that. the kni
straight
with that increase in production,
an increase in pollution
and an increase in responsibility
for the State to protect its
Children. Well, those
by a new
care
and I'd like to point out that LFC
released their, their study
last week about the physical
impacts of setbacks
that was looking at a much
bigger setback.
I mean, not, not at any
currently proposed legislative,
but that was setbacks around basically
residences and
those buildings. So we're talking
about that was like, I believe
half mile set back around
literally hundreds of
thousands.
And what we're talking about with
health protection zones around schools
is less than 100 schools
that have wells around.
Of course, there are more than
100 in
the actual impacts, right? Less
than one, just over one, we
send world gas wells in that
range. Less than 100
buildings is one of the
setback would
mind. So
thank you. I know I'm gonna look
over to
say to protect
these students by pushing oil
and gas development further
back the public schools.
And I ask
again for you to pass the health
protection zone one
mile
public school. Thank
you.
>> Thank you for that and get
it for the benefit.
Like
so again, for the benefit of
the Committee,
not that we asked
LLC repeatedly
to be on this panel and
presented the study
and they were and they multi
10.
Um Mr. Full May
have anything that
>> yes, Mr. Chair. Thank you. I'll be
brief. Uh If
we can advance to slide six,
please. My name is
Gregory Lou. I'm the assistant for people that
are, my name is Gregory
Lou. I'm the assistant commissioner for Mineral
Resources. I receive
well, oil and gas leasing in
the land office
and Royal Management as
well.
Um
That I
uh what you're
looking at here is
Jefferson Elementary School
in Hoggs.
And I ask
myself
what to say about our State,
our society when
we cite wells
this close to a school,
build a school out among
wells and community cases
here
and we don't know the health effects on
Children.
I don't know how it's gonna affect
them.
That's what we were shown
by
various
environmental organizations.
New Mexico's
of the folks here here.
Stable.
The next slide please
sli
elementary
their counselor of the
number of
wells.
I I know
some
look at this like or maybe we're
blaming them.
I think we're all duplicated in this.
We got this far
down the pike horse
out of our,
now we asking
how as well and gas affect
Children. Somebody at the land
office, at least that, that's
that, that loose way there. All
those wells on it
beside the school or put a school
beside all those wells, one or
the other, but all
complicity
but Noles
LLC uh I think
is this is
from the presentation which they
presented Friday.
It, but I think it's, I think it's a good,
a good start.
There's probably some more analysis,
the data that they can use out a lot of
data together.
That's like
there's only one slide
on the holocausts
of
in proximity to oil and
gas. This
speaks a loud excite
police.
We,
if you look more at these
questions,
we need to.
So we should, we should dig into. So some
of these other things that the costs
of were shown to be
quite high at the State. If
we had setbacks,
what would cost be if
the setbacks are
smaller,
how much land is really out of reach?
And we have these kind
of regular three and four mile
laterals that can
uh reach a
land underscore and three miles
away. And so I have a
mile set back or two
miles back.
And
the study shows setbacks,
water some streams
and things of that nature
by reinflating costs.
What happens to pull it out?
Say
colledge last year,
one mile. I said that
how that affects,
there's so many public health questions you
have an answer. It.
Uh As I said,
uh the
environmental groups confronted
the land office
about the situation about all these
wells there. Schools
and
Garcia Richard did the only thing she
could to say,
I'm not going to keep contributing to this
problem. I'm not gonna use
more oil and
gas.
So we know what's safe and
so the State has to set
back.
We can't tell
there's no
movement law for us to tell
anybody to shut in their reduction
or plug. Well, here in
school, we
can't do that. So I think we we could
do, we did
first to last year
was to
put that moratorium that cost in
place. That's
what we can do. Thank
you.
>> OK. Thank you all for
your presentation.
I apologize for
the
do type frame
that's not even taking
into consideration. We got
our of life
form of
um so going to the
Committee first step where you
representative.
>> Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you for your
presentation all of
you. Um I
did Google
the first presenter and I see them
in LC and they weren't real creds
either, but
they're not good.
Anyway, we'll go to the
one that, that
article study
that makes sense. And that it's
truly a good
study for New Mexico because
they studied in Loving New Mexico in
the middle of the
heart of
where actually I'd like
to you doctor.
I thank you for doing your
study. Um
My question, why do
you think
with, with all your
results that clearly show that
ozone and methane and
all these way above the same
level? Why do you think
that EPA has not
designated this
as anonym itself? Do you have
any idea any of you?
But we start at
least.
>> Yeah. Well, thanks for raising that
question. And I was trying
with my selection of
slides
to make you
puzzled about that because
I've been puzzled about it.
I'm living in a no
human area and
the
very high
awareness
in the population of
the
State, writing of the
Morgan
by fund everything is
to local
government to
monitor those of the
pre trying
to help, try to all of the
State of the
public
service,
everybody to
improve with conditions.
And then,
you know, observe, I mean that the
observance nothing and
it's so much worse
for us
more for 10
years.
I have the,
I don't have the answer to my
list Um
but colum I think
is
false.
Thank you, >> Chair
and Representative
Epa most recent letter to the
State saying that they
weren't quite sure
about it on a team yet said
that, you know, they're working with nmed
on like other solutions like
those of recurs,
but we've seen since those of
recurs was passed those
on levels that continue to rise
and, and actually like a
rise is accelerating.
Um And nmed
doesn't know when,
if or when those
will actually bring
air quality into
rage. Like they haven't
modelled that. I believe they kind
of requested the fund to
do that populations but
didn't get it. Um
So we don't even, nobody
even knows if, if and when that
is going to work and we do know since it
was enacted a couple of years
ago that it continues to be
reverse.
That's all I know.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It just doesn't
make sense based on your graphs
and your data that how,
how, how much do we have as
far as ozone rates
levels compared to these
other places that are
designated as an
is? So it makes
no sense, but I, I have
a thought about it. I know how
powerful this industry is.
It's just, but
I
um
um
we, we
saw a lot in
LSC, we hear a lot
about Ozone.
Senator Woods asked a great
question in LSC about
ozone and
um, where
it comes from and
why it happens and how
dangerous it is. So
with somebody explaining
where it comes from
what it does to the Arab community
and, and really how dangerous it is
and how much it is accumulated
in the area we're talking
about.
>> Yeah, sure. Thank you.
Uh There's no way to get the slides
back on.
So I had had to
kind of rush through
that
for
no. So I have signed
that detailed
the health things of
those on.
I want that the most
vulnerable
parts of the population
are higher like the highest
risk systems,
infants, young
Children,
uh elderly
people that have
respiratory
um health conditions
and people that have
other
health conditions,
that cardiovascular
conditions. And
it just, it just adds to the
stress that
the human body
has to come
with.
And I want to repeat
the number that is
cited from an EPA
study that every
year United
States estimated
5000 to 6000
people die
prematurely
because of exposure
to elevate it also
5000 to
6000. We
have identified
that area
also a little bit
region colony in
the United States.
So the simple
extrapolation
would infer that a very
significant fraction of
those 5000 to 6000
people die
every year much
surely and
be in that region
because that's where that's
really, really nosy.
It's not the most densely
in the area in the
um that
is where you have the
highest OIC
country and
even more concerningly
while ozone has been
declining
99% of the
United States because
of very
aggressive
laws that we have been commitment
and we use emissions
of compounds
outside. We have
very, very
strong data that
show that in that area
of the country,
it's one of the very few
exemptions for
oxides are interesting
and this body
or comps.
So we see it in the
precursors, we see
it in the ozone, we see it in
drone based measurements, we
see it in satellite data
and this is an
area, it's clearly tr
in the opposite direction
in most of the United
States and also
Europe and Asia in
China, right?
So we
controlling
>> and and Mr. Chairman and
doctor, we know that
during the extraction process,
that's when the bo box are
created or ait
and the the knots are
emitted, right? And one of them is
a tell, tell me about that and
how it affects those.
>> Yeah. So there are different
processes that
contribute to
the evis of all
compounds
and nitrogen oxide.
So again, what you need
to have to make
ozone to use ozone
need to have warm sunny
weather conditions because we need
the sunlight
to to trigger the
chemistry. And that's why we've seen
much of the rosone in the summer
months, warm
sun, maintain
the sun high
throughout the day with our
sun. And then you need
these two recurs
and one light itself
and the only works frozen.
You really need to have
so you need the volatile
or, and
they need to have the nitrogen
oxides. So there are
different processes now
that drive the emissions
of the volume organics
and the oxides.
When we think
that area
drives 90 plus
percent of the
Volvi
are Islan
leakage
from oil and
gas. And it's
not likely not
just development,
but it's developed was I've
seen, it's the
first I've seen these
numbers that this
one study that was
pursued that 60%
of wells
operating
from violation
and leaking
and 60%
you know, if you have how many
1000 bills,
I think it was 16,000
bills. So that's
very well
leaky and 20
volatile.
And you see clearly in the
data
like
soar, we have
40,000
in Colorado, we have
40,000 there. This is
not and
I oil and
gas free area,
Colorado, but the levels are so
significant. They're
so.
So I think these numbers
explain when the
program is
high rate
of leakage
and
maintained
facilities.
Now, the second rule
that drives the Ozan
protection, the second chemical
class that is nitrogen
oxide. So I was
very surprised. I
personally believe the
data and we found
when we plotted it and we saw
higher levels of nitrogen
oxide in
loving the to
the Denver
um
be because nitrogen
ides and we know as emission
sources of power plants.
And we have been regulating that
for 30 plus years,
automobiles
that catalytic
nervous and automobiles
that the nitrogen oxide
emissions come down
and we've seen
nitrogen that's coming down
all over the country
except
basins where there's
tense oil and gas
development. And
the two sources that are
obvious that have
been described in
the literature of bearing
has a lot of we in that
area so
far as I
as one of the major sources of
meal size and
that there is also a lot of
heavy in
place for trucking. It's
also a major source
for.
>> Thank you. So it's there.
We know it's there, we know it's
where it's coming from and what it's
what it's doing to the communities.
I just don't know if the communities quite
understand it. But
um the other thing, at
least we have the Methane World Cup,
right? And in,
in our meeting in LSC
Secretary K said
there are because of
all the um
monitoring done
through satellites.
He showed that there were
387
super emitters of Mela
right now and 30 base.
So when we talk about
a lot of times the, you'll talk about
where the agencies, the bad actors.
Well, when we have 60% of
our weal uh
f there's a lot
of bad actors in this industry
and we need to figure out how
to um
curb it. But thanks. Thank you
for your information. Thank you
all for what you
have brought to this Committee.
I hope you listen and
um we know what, what's
happening. We know what we need to do
now. We just have to be brave enough to do
it and Mr. Chair
if I stop. Thank
>> you.
>> Thank you, Representative Representative
Keys
>> that gained my time to ever
since.
>> Mm
I appreciate
it.
Thank
you
Center for the presentation.
Uh doctor
I believe you, you mentioned
that you live in a non attain
area.
So
did, did I hear you
correctly?
>> It's a little, a little bit
older Colorado
and the
North Denver
Colorado front range
has been designated
as Ozone No Achievement
area for
18 plus years.
So let me explain a little
bit what that means
when this designation
is, is
meant or
implemented, it,
it requires the
State to develop
what's called a State
implementation.
The State has to come
up with the plan
to reduce
emissions and
bring the alcoholically
back in
compliance
with the national and
alcohol standards
as mandated
by the Clean Air
Act. And so
Colorado
has
a 15 years year
history of developing
State in which
implementation plans
is
uh addressing different
sectors that contribute
to emissions that
cause ozone
pollution,
um
revising
revising
fing procedures
and then also
monitoring
the also
of itself and
demonstrating to the
a every so many
years that their
own trajectory to
improve their
quality. Meaning for you to
lower the ozone
levels that the
citizens are exposed
to. Um after
15 years,
the Colorado from
range
like like some improvements, but
they're still on the
because they show the
table there.
So
and all
the
and >> thank you
for that or
doctor
uh Chair
and doctor.
So K
has this
non attainment area
affected your health
and you can just give me a short answer
on that. I
do you have some kind
of
health issues that are affecting
you from, from living in that
area?
Well, you
know that, that that goes
into my own personal
health
condition, but I, I do
actually have
slight asthma and
then
treated for that. I take
medications. Thank
you for that answer.
Thank you.
And
that's, that's kind of what I want
to get to. And, and we
are here today
in your testimony and, and
others here on the
panel,
how
we're relating the
non attainment areas and
asthma, the
low workways and other
things. And I see
that in my community
in Clovis,
uh I see
a grandson with asthma, I
see a brother-in-law with
asthma. I
see a lot of people that have asthma
around the Clovis area
and I don't believe
that is due to the oil and
gas.
So as a
legislator, I want to make sure
to make the right
decisions
as to how
we're relating all this
and, and, and the young man over
over here on my
lab, he, he
talked about five
times
the,
the cases in
this area I
believe.
And I'd like to get
more detail
on that. Arline, you
know how you came across that
number and we can do
that, we can do that online.
We're, we're, we're short on time
here,
but I see a lot of
the, what we're talking about
here today in
other areas of the country that,
that aren't
in this not attainment
area. So
I think we as legislators
out of love
at the broad and make sure
we make the right decisions
for the State of New Mexico
citizens. And I'm
really concerned about about the
kids. And with
that, I want to ask another
question
is, did anybody
do studies
of the air quality
inside
the
to really see
the Reding where
those kids spend most of their
time
and not
somewhere else other than
inside of schools. We
seem to be
concentrating here
today
on the skull kids
and I believe that their time would
be
in a high percentage
rate
inside a school. Did
anybody do any
studying
of the air quality inside
this?
>> Thank you Mr. Chair. This is
more on um as
far as I'm aware, there's not a
lot of data
on air quality inside the
schools. Um
You know, most of the studies
that that we're referring to the
included at the health summary.
Um there
of, you know, there are
impacts on the people
and I just kind of
broad epidemiological
studies. So this includes the time people
spend inside their homes,
inside their buildings.
Um Yeah, we don't have
specific numbers on air quality
side of homes or
schools.
And also to your other point
is that, you know, we're,
we're not saying that all
asthma and all cancer is
caused by oil and gas pollution. But
the science is showing that
the risks of
asthma exacerbations, the risks of
childhood cancer are
higher in these
regions. And that's
for oil and gas spaces across the
country. >> Thank
you. Thank you for that.
And, and I think we ought to
concentrate our,
our, our
study
in our
science
as a whole across
the border. We're, we're
see, we're seem to be
targeting at certain
areas, schools,
other buildings. And
I
want,
why, why are we looking
at it in that
manner?
And I,
I if
we're drilling,
we need, we need the
energy
but then we seem to be
picking on certain sectors
or certain departments
and, and, and I don't know
if it's direct
our attendment to,
to this bill is gonna be
presented in a certain
way.
Why, why are we not
talking about the breast Ls?
Why are we not talking about people
with not pills?
Why are we no locking your
but people
in downtown of Turkey
where we have a lot of, a
lot of eu
and what's there?
And why don't we compare that to
the and how,
how do we
compare that to the oil
fields of how do we would regulate
our working for
somebody else
if we're gonna push these regulations
forward,
>> Mr. Chair? Remember that was
more you know, I,
I, I'm, I'm
really just here to talk about
public schools. This is
something to talk about the
public health and oil
and gas. Um,
well, students are at public schools that
are in your care. Right. I
mean, we, we can't
control where people decide to
live in so people
maybe mov'e into an area
where there are as
well. Um, but,
but kids don't, can't
control where they go to school for the most
part. And right now they have
to go to, I'd
love to solve all of
the quality problems in New
Mexico. And I, I'd like to even have
a bill that could do that
that would look like. And, and >> if
it be here to tell us and
thank you for that answer
and thank you, Mr. Chair, I'm
gonna try to wrap this
up. I think
we ought to go back. I think we ought
to do a study inside the
school very
quality.
And I want to ask one more
question. This will be my
last visit Chair
or Michael
Lumped on, on soon.
Mr. Mr.
Lumpen, if you were to live
in, in New Mexico, would you
feel safe?
They
less than a mile away from,
from a, from an oil
well.
>> And Mr. Chairman and representative,
um, the answer to that
is yes, I
would feel safe living within
an, a, a mile of an oil
well, I would feel safe raising
my family there
and I answer that,
um, not glibly,
I answer that based
on the
s the best available science
and the analysis that I have
reviewed from
many quarters, uh from
scientists both in um,
State, uh
federal, um,
private consulting
and nonprofit, public health
groups. Um
And, and I look at
it, I think of it in terms of risk,
what is the likelihood
that emissions
from that sort of
site um, would
create an actual
exposure that
would cause
a, a risk of harm to my
family. Um
I the, the data,
as I've understand it and as
I've briefly
described it um
does not comport
with exposures that
would uh put
my family at risk including
Children. Um
But as a risk assessor, I also
think about relative
risks. Um not just
the risk of, of one
source, but there are risks of other
things around.
Um If, if
I'm thinking about uh raising
my family in New Mexico,
um knowing
the scientific basis
for the minimis
risk to my
family, I would be more
concerned about
the risk to my
Children uh
from um
depleted funding for
our schools and
the risk of my family for depleted
funding for public
safety and
public health services
um that, that um
depend on um
revenues from uh
various um
revenue draws within the
State.
So, um am I
worried that raising my
family in New Mexico
um would put them
in harm's way from a public
safety standpoint, public health
standpoint? No,
but if I compare that
risk to
>> the management
is
>> um
>> Mr. Chair, I, I believe, I
believe. Thank
you ever since tomorrow. So we
are over time for
this panel. We have four
people on the list.
So I'm gonna recognize all of you. I
ask you limit your questions
in about a minute or
two and to the
panel, I need you to answer the questions,
brief,
>> take a time. I'll try to be
as quick as possible.
Um
um >> to pull
micro phone call.
>> Sorry,
better. All right, I appreciate
the time. Um
So
I was at that FC
presentation uh last
week and one of the comments I made
sure was that we need
more data and more information, more
of, of putting all of this
information together
because
we have two sides or
we have a full spectrum of
information, but
science doesn't mind.
And so we're looking at the scientific
information and as I do,
I'm looking at the scientific
information, I just
actually looking at the
threat of
exposure amounts of
Bende and Noz and those
sort of things, I mean that
they are even lower levels over
time than when you
are telling
us about.
So
we have to have an understanding
that the
people living in these areas
are having been scheduled
over time. So my question goes
to have there
been lawsuits to
show that are, you know,
uh from,
from those that live in these
zones in these areas.
Against industry.
And if so do you have those numbers?
Should
>> thank you Mr. Chair.
And
I'm not aware of the
personal, like, toxic
to lawsuits against oil
and gas companies for like,
like what you're, I think you're
talking about one of, one of the problems
is that oiling gas
production and at least hundreds
of balloons
that have a variety of
health effects at a
variety of levels.
We don't even have good
data on many of them. So
benzene is one of the best
ones what Doctor Min
presented. Um
You know, his, his graphs show like a
three parts per million long
term threshold.
That's
the World Health Organization, but that's
based on known cancer health
effects. World Health Organization
recommends a
0.5
>> part of a million >> health
thresholds. Um
So, but there's hundreds
of pollutants that cause of
writings, we don't even
know what all of them individually do
and what thresholds are safe
and we definitely don't know
what, what thresholds
are safe, any combination
of exposure to 100
different flus or 203
100 pollutes at a time.
Um So that that makes those
kinds of lawsuits challenging.
It makes the data challenging. It
makes the need for following
like epidemiological studies,
like the ones with my health summary
that I can wait around.
Um all
the more important because
if we look on a polluted by
looking basis, we don't
have the data. Um
For many of the VO CS
that are coming out of these and what's safe
and what's not. And we definitely look at the
data on what combinations
look uh new over
time, but we can look at a
population and see
that populations in
oil and gas production areas
have higher risks of Asma
administration concern.
>> So Mr. Chair, uh so we,
we have those numbers of
those
conditions, the south conditions
of populations
that are living in these areas,
correct?
>> Um Mr. Chair,
I represent them. I'm sorry, I didn't understand
the question. >> Do we
have epidemiological
numbers of those health
conditions and individuals
that have them in these areas?
Mr. Check,
>> Mr. Chair Representative.
Um so are
a little we have, there's a lot
of epidemiological studies
um when that those studies don't
necessarily include individual
like that, that's kind of
epidemiological studies generally
don't look at individual
people experience a
particular problem. They're, they're
looking at like
large, you know, kind of statistical
analy of like hospital data.
And
>> that's my question,
the the larger
scale of a
population, those
numbers are recorded, you
have them
Mr. Chan >> Mr. Chair
and then that's what these studies
talk about.
Um Yes,
>> yes, thank you. And so I'm
trying to make it a
jump into another question.
So I I appreciate that.
So
what is the,
yeah, I understand but what is, what
is and from those
studies and the information, what is the
cost that you're bearing
on those medical
or medical costs for this,
this populations
that I don't know that
we're
included in the
Val
>> Mr. Chair representative I
I
information but
that, that requires
I I don't have access
to,
>> does anybody have that information,
Chery?
That's what I'm getting at. Sure. We don't
have all the data and information. Just
as you said, we need a
lot, we need this information
to make these decisions
because as it
was
um
um study
analysis, study that
it was as a, as a bigger
scale, there are more variables
that they were looking at and that
cost analysis
and what that means. And I think we
need to, we kind of, we need
to provide those numbers and we need
to this study, this
Committee needs to come forward and
say we need a certain kind of
study. So I
think that that needs to, that
needs to be they're done
or to look at how
we're going to formulate
item of this bill that we've
been working on over the years and
how we, we have all
data mim information
because this is gonna be
just a huge issue
for us during the Session which
I'm doing this for,
I mean many conventions
this year on energy and other
things. And this is been
far as one of the big
biggest bills that we're going to
be
focused on for
our 2025
Session. And I need us
to have that full information
and data, to have the
argument in order
for us to, to, to get
some def
information that
or that a better
level. I want to say thank
you to the,
I know I'm going on, but this
is, this is really rewarding
sharing. I apologize when going on.
But I, I
thank our commissioner
for some of the judgment. Some of
the things that she's looking at, how
she's, she's uh
she's looking at putting
a pause so that we can get some of the
materials and the understanding
and more, more
data at our
fingertips if you
will. But
I'm just like writing
notes and information
for myself trying to figure out in my
mind around this. I think
that
it's,
it's in front of us and I
think we need to, to, you
really get together. How are you
working? How is
anybody at the table? You
working with
industry and with legislators?
I know some legislators that you are.
But how are you putting this together
so that we have the whole
discussion, Mr. Chair?
>> So we're well, I appreciate
the inquiry and I would suggest
you, >> I would like to
connect out mind
after this to see how you're
doing that because we have
to have a fuller conversation and
everybody needs to be here talking
about the team really to
formulate and see how we get this done
because if we're just gonna
base things on one cost
analysis and not a full cost
analysis to,
to, you know,
change minds and like
what not and we're not
doing the
job,
Scott.
>> Oh, I, I need
to.
Why
in
very
well
on the top
on the surface
of the house Freberg
sin and
State.
And I see
in one of these
presentations
that there is a involved
to seven times more
likely chance of
developing
by
was with
him
2 to 5
miles
of
Mr. Chairman Cavalry
School
in my community of
50,000.
It is
within one
mile of
not one well
but
hundreds.
So can anyone
on the panel
represent to
me that
in my community, the
kids in my community
has seven times
the incidence
of lymphoma
as other
kids in the
State,
>> Mr. Chair we
got and we don't have any,
we don't have that information from the Department
of Health. I mean that has a specific
study on on lymphoma
and how that has not been been conducted.
And I don't know that I I'm
presenting a summary
of studies from
across the country. These are
studies and the way
epidemiological studies
work is that it doesn't necessarily
mean that any
one individual is gonna get
cancer. But like there's
this is a well developped
field of science is a real,
there are many studies
of about these
things and the
risk is higher and
the risk generally
for childhood lymphoma,
thankfully, it's not super
high, right? Like most
kids don't get
lymphoma and live
in our country regardless of where
they live. But what these studies are
saying is that the kids who live next
to we have a higher
risk. Uh Mr.
>> Chen,
let me ask the same question
about lower weights. Let
me ask the same question
about asthma.
And do you have any
evidence that
any child,
statistically
speaking has been
harmed by these
activities? Any
child in New
Mexico?
>> Mr. Chair represent
one of the in 2023.
I have to send you this
information.
Yes. So the the one of
the low birth studies is
specific to New Mexico. It was
published last year
and that and that does
connect increase low
birth weight risk in New
Mexico communities
with proximity that are
in the gas development.
>> I have underwear and I am
very closely
involved with it
with the health care providers
in my community. And
I have never
heard
anybody
saying anything
remotely
assembling what
humans are presenting to
that. And let me
ask to
this,
I say in some
of this literature in
front of me that the
American Lung
Association with
Brains Flea
County
header as
a Bee
Reyes
Dona
County
and Marito
County has
an F
so, I mean,
this is not a five line
nine organization
if there is a problem
and we have any counties,
these folks should
be rising
to raise the and yet
we don't, we're not even
represented as
a non attainment
area. So
how do you
reconcile
all of this presentation
on what is apparently
reality on the
ground?
>> Mr. Chair Representative Chicago. Thank
you for that question.
Um I can't
on the American Lung
Association. I know that
their calculus
for how they parade is
based on multiple.
We, we do know from
many enemy, these
data that Lee
in any county have
are out of compliance. Their air
quality is worse than the federal
health standard. And we know
from Doctor Helling's recent,
recent measurements, right,
that these
measurements that it's getting worse, right? The
air quality is not healthy
by EPA standards
and it's getting worse. That's, that's
the reality of the like
those are the numbers, they are
hard
numbers,
>> Mr. Chair and all
Rass.
I have not heard
beginning convincing
or
with hard
data from
the communities that are
being represented
as most harmful
to kids in this
State. If that's what
you're gonna represent,
then there should
be somebody
studying those
effects in my
community, the
community of girls
that
in Muni
in those places
where oil and gas has
been active
for 100
years and
yet
nobody
has raised a flag
about ill
health effects of
that proximity. Thank
you, Mr. Chap.
Thank you very
much. >> So
will
>> thanks Mr.
Chairman
>> I said in
the LFC
work and they
talk about,
said
and they did link
financial
credentials
but no predictions
for our
pretty fuzzy because,
I mean, they took
what they thought the
setback would be,
but we don't really know
what is going to
be Tori or who's
gonna be asked for
the next bill.
But I can tell you
this,
we're gonna have to cut down
spending in the State in
Mexico
if they didn't put in
set.
And it's going to be
interesting to see
how the sanely they do on this
panel.
So what spending they want
to cut back
when that goes
out. Everybody
in this room is
making living.
Well, everybody testified
this like 11
a gas,
either one side or the other.
You make a
little,
I don't blame you.
I'm, I'm glad you're work.
That's, that's fantastic.
I'm happy you're
working,
but I don't believe
that for
ramifications of
this a
broader
and
I
represent so
be centered to
Chicago
that
it is a, a
confusing
time to
me
and that there's two
experts.
So two different
things.
So I have problems with
that.
I don't mind study but
help
me
help me a lot
to, to get
this the
down.
So I guess
if anyone wants to do that, it
would be great. Thanks for
sure. >> Thank you,
Senator Senator mccutchen
briefly.
>> Yes, sir, mister, uh,
very much,
um, col glad you
brought up credibility in breaking the
law. Are those two things that are pretty important
to
you,
>> Mr. Charitable
Senator
I'm here to talk about
the need for help setbacks
around schools to
protect kids from oil and gas pollution.
So I'm happy to answer
questions. >> So
that is that >> a no.
Then
Senator mccutchan, I think the
answer is correct and he's here
to talk about sometimes.
I,
>> I appreciate that but he did
attack, um,
Doctor Lofton's report at the
beginning saying that
it was on credible section
important forreal
purposes.
If that was something usual
>> Senator, if they have a
point to make, I would suggest
she made a point without
the question and answering
form. Sure,
>> I'll make the point that
uh
Doctor Heick let
go from the Colorado University
Boulder. He was
like, oh because writing because
of his business and
because his,
his relationship
with his business and
the colledge was,
there was a lot of different varieties
there that
he was let go from
arguably of the
most liberal
universities
because the data was
not, was not
in line with the
agriculture.
And so when we're talking about
credibility and breaking
law, we have our main
aist who has been involved
in those
issuess
for quite some time,
he failed to disclose
funding
on certain
projects. And I
think it's important that we point out
if credibility and breaking law is
something that is important to the
panel, I know that it's
important
to the representatives and
Senators.
And so we have to know
that the information that we are
in to make
billions of dollars
and tons of
health
risks,
changes
to the State are coming from great
resources.
No further questions. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. >> Thank you,
Senator Mke
Ferrera
for one
question.
>> Uh Thank you. Thank you, Mister
Chair again.
And I guess the
underlying question
here is available
science, you know, everybody's
referred to them.
Uh And I guess my
question is it is my
understanding that we're not talking
about a setback
for, for oil
wells and, and oil
and gas operations that are
already in existence.
What we're talking about is
a while sent back
for new wells
and uh New New
Jerking. Am I correct
in that
>> there, >> Mr.
Chair Representative Herrera? Yeah.
Um what I'm asking for
today specifically is a one
mile setback around
schools. It's
public schools
right now. That is about 100
buildings that have mus
within a
mile.
>> Uh Thank you. That's >> all I have.
Mister.
Thank you, Representative
Townsend.
>> One question.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
One question, sir.
Um I understand
your comments
is you're concerned
about kids in
school, but you
go to one of the smallest
communities in New
Mexico,
but yet you admit
that alcoy
with hundreds of thousands
of people
is in a
worse
do area.
So is
it
you can
if you went well
because it was
a it was gave
you the ability to
attack the oil and gas
industry.
>> Thank you, Mr. for
the question.
Part of this project
you founded is
also Competitive
Power. Um We
succeeded to raise
funding from the Health Effects
Institute
and the Health
Effects Institute.
Um
We call
or propose those lines of
research to study
health effects
due to oil and gas
emissions and
they identified
as one of the target study
areas. And
so we
researched
the area more
suitable locations
and we identified
Loving as
a desirable
location because of the
logistics because
of
um
being in an area that
was
suspected
from um
elevated level of oil
and gas emissions
because of the
density of oil and
gas wells in the area.
And secondly, we
also
um
that had to be previously
on the density of
airing learning from
oil and gas wells that can
be came from
satellite in
that area
show that it was
one of the
regions for the
worst, very
dense, very,
very with
this.
>> Uh
just for the record,
it is important to note
that methane
uh produced or
methane
capture her
barrel, the full of
productions continues
to go down
the the
the methane
um levels
as is
is fulling down.
So the technology,
whether you're looking
at a uh M
AC T or a
Lear
uh oversight,
those types of
processes
are being introduced
in all
oil and gas activities
that So
I, I really,
I mean, what I thought when
I sit here today
was,
oh,
a shot
of a
technical shot at the
gas industry
without any real
credibility.
Uh, when you look at what the,
the actual industry
is doing today,
um,
that has been side stamped.
So I, I
think
of,
we're all, we're all concerned
about the health of the
world. There are Children
and their students
and I'm seeing in the industry
that's addressing that
the lectures for
you said today,
I'm taken
great too
because
I
just picking out a spot
where there's any
activity
Odesa. Would you think it would be any
different
nodes? That would be the
same?
>> So there was another question.
Um This
was a point study
monitor
aircons for one
year, one bank
location.
Um I showed some
data, some
analysis and quite
a few more of
those products
that illustrate
that the most
of air transported
the side from the
South, the South East
sector.
Um
There's no reason to believe
that we were doing this
monitor the most
weed
dirtiest air place
in some New Mexico
or Texas.
Um We don't know
of these measurements. We don't
have information on
the spatial distribution
oru there's some
satellite imagery
that helps us
to
identify
the surface
level is higher than in other
places. I think it's very
likely that there
are other places
and from where we
saw the ocean, most of the
I ozone transfer to
us there are other
places where there
is more than
contaminated
ocean levels are higher
and we will be monitored
at the site. And this
is
so it's most sure
that there are
people living in
areas um
exposed to do
levels that are
higher than what I shown
in thevar that
I
um,
>> I,
I don't agree on that.
I don't
know.
>> Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
I wouldn't make a pan
for being here and
especially,
um, Miss and
your, they be a for, um,
climate crisis
and
I think that's really great.
But if we only have
100 well,
we visited
Wran Locks for radioactive
Paters to be,
um, a site where we could
see through a special
hammer and that's flaring and
the methane of
exposure. And
then to think about how
that so looks like within
half a mile
of and we're
only asking for one
mile.
Um, and
then 100
buildings. Um, I
think we should be able to,
uh, monitor
the different
closes that we already
have and can't do
anything about changing or
closing up. But,
um, making sure that they have
the technology
to uh stop
the leaking and to make
sure that we have
um, the reduced and the
emissions as much as
possible near the
schools and then all of
the um,
housing that was
surrounding that school
that seems to be the
least we can plan to invest
in our students
and families
and then adopt
like mile setback
so that we don't have
further um
uh pollution
and exposure
for our.
Thank you, Mr. Chan.
>> Thank you. I
want to make the question to
Mr. Klum.
You mentioned the ability
to drill laterally
with the State land office, be
able to be of partial
for development and
specify at least that the
no surface activity on that
partially.
>> That's a very astute question.
I I was
actually gonna bring out no service.
I can see leases
that is something that is available
to be allowed in the neural leg
management, but we
cannot under the
current law, we operate
under
the track
plan and, and tell
the
when they
cannot put any surface
infrastructure or a well
had on the
lease.
>> So Mr. Flum are hard releases
for the single novels are set out
in statute word for word
detector.
>> That that is right now,
Sharon. >> And so, I
mean, I as an
attorney drafts
contracts and leases and
all sorts of stuff,
I'm always making the brute
notes. If I was locked
into a for the
diver was given 20
years ago, I would
not be sure of my
client. That's
something I think she
consider. Um
and my comment uh is
just, you know, we have this
LC study
and I tried like help to get
LCM here to
explain the study to go over the
study. Uh And
I'm mentally
frustrated
that
LC staff, although
continually told that they're
always available
that they're not.
Uh but I see an LC
study that has a wildly
broad
univers
setbacks
in terms of what they would be setbacks
on and a huge fiscal
impact,
but not in the
analysis of the benefits.
So when I think of the cost
benefit analysis, the
LC study goes into great
detail about
substantial
costs
but really leave the be
inside.
I think that's something
I, I hear from both sides,
you know, we need more
information about the impacts.
Um
I, I think, I think
we could but
I, I think
can't just ignore
the public health
costs, the
public health benefits
they will include and realized
by
providing some level
protection.
Thank you all for
your reason to,
we're gonna mov'e on to the next
family.
Ok. So our next
available I get
started
uh quite a bit and
thank you all for your patience.
Uh Once again, we have
Rayly three
and Ro and we
have Ben Shelton, got
deputy Secretary
and uh
Mr. uh
would you like to do
first?
>> Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you,
Mr.
Chair.
I know this is the last slab of
Canada. You have to hear from me from
here. I'm getting tired. It's out of my voice
by now.
Um
The land office is, is
I I explained to the Committee
staff. Uh
We're putting this together,
we don't have a role
permitting, well transfer, but we
do some things that are very similar
to that and we're doing some innovative
things under Commissioner Garcia
Richard and
I, I asked that would be of interest
to the Committee when he said yes.
So,
uh,
the processes
that we have that are similar to,
well, transfers are
a change of lease
assignment, signing a
lease and changes
of unit operator.
And
briefly, uh,
if
Cer Lessy has a lease and they
sell him to company B
uh, company that you can immediately
start from.
Uh,
but company a
and the land office
eyes uh
perhaps was never even a
apprised of the sale of
that least company
a previous, let's
see, would be
responsible for
any liabilities out
there. Uh
The company b had a massive
spill. We get old company a
responsible probably under
company too. So
what companies
typically do is as for
Street sign
and it used to be a pretty one
affair. Uh
What we have
done in regards to Richard,
she's driven a focus on
compliance,
fill up with this form.
Um She
can have a hand out in front of you
on the screen
and
we ask that
the assigner company
a identify
any skills on
that. We
ask them to
affirm that their
royalty payments and rental
payments are up to date
and all this information
of course, is shared with
the purchasing company so they
can verify these things as
well. We
ask, uh was company
a minded, we asked the same
thing of the company that would
receive the assignment company
b uh We
ask about compliance
to make sure that there are no surprises
out there uh for,
for us and, or,
or the company that is has
purchased or is getting assigned
that lease. And we ask
about the number of inactive wells.
And if there are inactive wells on that
lease, uh the four
wheel or change of
assignment, we make sure that
those inactive
wells areo and
abandoned abandon means
you're not familiar with that. Terminology. It
means that site is reclaimed,
doesn't mean that. So I
forgotten that infection
means that it's that
to get through. Abandonment means that
you've uh ripped
up the Kichi and you've rese
a new example.
Um We have what
oil and gas related infrastructures
on the lease. Uh We do
a satellite review of the
leases
and
we'll look for stating out there,
we'll look for old
pits and
uh some of these can be
1020 years old. We would ask
that the company go out
properly, uh
reclaim the, the pits that are
out there.
Uh
So we go to the next slide.
Um
And, and it really, it's the
same thing on
the uh
I uh
side as well, not be.
So we're discussing it. Uh
We make sure
that um that
that company is bonded in New
Mexico, we make sure they're registered with
the Secretary of State.
Uh We make sure that they're in good
State with the State. We want to make sure
that they're a company we want to do business
with.
Uh and
we asked them that they uh
agree with our cultural properties
rule which protects
our incredible
uht
heritage
in New Mexico, which
simply basically says
that a company
agrees to do a cultural
resources survey if
one has not been done or not been
done.
Uh lastly
to go to the next document, please.
And uh this is
for a change
of unit operator.
The reason
it's really the next slide,
please. Uh It really
gets the same questions. I'm not going to
go over in detail.
The final thing I'll say here
is that
a company wants to get a lease
assigned to it when a company wants
to become the unit operator.
Um They're
motivated to do so so that they
can uh go
out there and say make money
out of that in oil and gas
gene, right, in a certain
conglomerations,
combinations of
federal State and
private rent
and they
want these things. And so we use
it, it's kind of a Children when we get to
step in and say
we're not thinking you need an operator.
Let's make sure any
legacy out there is
cleaned up. That's
the, that's
just a bit. We want
to make sure that people are no longer
literally passing
trash in Mexico. Thank
you.
>> Thank
>> you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman Members be
Sheldon and the general can also
enact a deputy
Secretary,
sorry for a little bit
closer.
This is my first of three panels.
I'm gonna be your MC
for the afternoon.
Um Find this flavor
that will make. This panel is the same
I make in front of
which is that as Deputy Secretary,
I have proximate knowledge in many
things. My best for
you specific of every
answer ask maybe
to follow up in L A
even
so
talk about oil transfers
uh in the oil conservation
division. My first slide
is to there
gives you an idea of the volume of transfer
traffic that we process
at the Oil Conservation division.
And we uh
245 transfers
so far in 2004,
about 3000 bucks
every day. And we are looking
at, you know,
and what transfer and you can see
the third paragraph that we
take a at
describing what is going
on the transfer.
You can think of a large but
capitalized operator drilling
a well operating through
this cycle
then as that well becomes less
productive, it's not
ancom dollar or operating
for
selling
um as companies burn
and shift ass.
So we will be, we frequently
see at the end of a life cycle as a
well, that is not producing very much
in the hands of a very small operator
that maybe is not have the
resources that we would hope
for to
plug and abandon and do the environmental
rehe site.
Now, that is not an
absolute. And I
should also add that there's
not language that's in
the oil gas and
clear as to how
we must transfer well
overhead. We have you basically
do this under so plenary
authority and regulate
everything and anything
or gas.
So on the next slide
spun out was the
theoretical just of
uh example numbers
for to illustrate
this um this
process, you can
see I've got a hypothetical large
operator with a lot of well really
high production. $1.25
million in financial
insurance.
They May take a given well
and transfer to a medium
operator. Why you May
ask is this
red instead of yellow,
indicating maybe higher
risk encountered in my
previous slide. And the answer is that
while a medium operator is
less likely individually
to fail or go
bankrupt or go under
when they do, it is more
damaging when we
lose 1 to 300
wells that go kind of over
to the State custody.
Then that is we,
we worry about that. That's the
scenario that keeps us up
more than a small
operator with five
or 10 wells, putting
those on the stage on the stage
goals.
Um So you don't necessarily
get a clean sort of
risking the State going down
with operators by strands
occur. The other thing to note is
that as we step down in
size, we
production,
the size of those steps
down are not reflected in the financial
assurance.
We lose millions of
barrels a year, almost
of, of, of
production,
but we don't
necessarily
have millions of dollars to get away
financial insurance. So we
go from bad to
worse financial
Asur fund to where the State is
in its bottom, even though that
large operator is extremely
unlikely. Uh
to
our next slide slide for this
is the language house bill
133 last
year as in ended. I think that
bill was waiting to be heard
on the house floor last year.
This is the language on grants
regulation that
was proposed in that
bill
get all of us across generally
State regulators even
where you've got honorary authority.
You are always, always
hating out specific authority,
which is why we have this
uh this language
is not uncommon
for
our legal team that
is processing O CV
ring to see
a transfer application come on across
their desk and say,
hey,
that's the NOV for this
operator right
on desk
right next to me and how
we've got a transfer application.
This is not something that I would say
we have the capacity. You
know, if you saw the volume that we're looking
at, we are not looking to apply a
standard of
this kind of every
transfer application. But
we're looking what we were looking
for specifically then
and what, what that
is the ability to
pull, particularly if
we just looking transfer applications
out of the A and give
you a close
to.
Um, the
other note to consider is that it was
a matter of public
record now, um has
been petitioned
to change
our authority under the existing
language, the unmodified language of
the statue
authority. The past
practice as we have
um coming to with transfers. It's
been that these are,
you know, a PD
or relative.
We don't necessarily have our
rules right now. The authority
to stop holding out of the file,
stop the process and see
things, right? Um
So this is a petition
that uh O CD will
be, I believe
filing plus
short. But this is the
like the
conversation is like
the,
at the end of my size, I feeling great. I
brought photo
scientist.
Thank you, Mr. Child.
Thank you very much for your
brief uh presentation.
I appreciate that
question.
Ok. Well, I have a question. Uh
Would you show
me uh the
language? Talk about 133?
Um
And you said that you would
refer >> to
using a specific
authority
>> and you do
the level of scrutiny now
or uh
you know, based on your other
learning,
do you currently have this
authority
question?
I would say the authority to do this
is not specifically, we would be
going out outside of our rules
to do this right now as we currently
have
been.
Thank you.
See,
I
don't know that.
Thank you. So
thank you, Mr. Chairman.
>> I just wanted to follow up on
Mister Shelley's
answer. Uh You
said you would be going outside of
your
>> correct
as we have it right now. I, I
don't think
Mr. Chairman and Representative Henry
W would have
the,
I'm not sure what we would point
to to stop
a transfer in terms of
our moral authority. We have a very
broad authority or statute,
but that's fully worth as much as
we promulgate.
>> Ok. Thank >> you. >> Thank
>> you,
>> Mr.
>> Moving on next
bill.
Thank you, Mr.
Prue.
Next panel is
forms bonding and
reclamation and changes
Uh,
so, uh, we
have Mr.
Shelton and we have
Senator Dior,
um, both Senator
Dier Senator
or if you have
joined us, uh,
since this morning we
did introductions,
um,
percent February. Would you like them to do
a
preception?
Uh, yes, thank you, >> Mr.
Chair, uh, Jared
and read about a district
59 chater.
>> Thank you. And
so going to the panel,
uh,
Senator, why you introduce
yourself? And then we'll let,
uh Mr.
Shelton
that.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair, uh Greg
diver from Senate
District 27 which
covers Chavis
Lee
Roosevelt Gurry.
And
ok. And we, >> youy
and
Senator, I have been with
us for a while. I just didn't get back
to introductions to my
apologies. Uh
Mrs,
ok. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
Moving into our next issue
where we're talking about
bombing shortfall.
Um,
the first slide so
you can sort of slide. There
is our, is our case and when I mentioned
our, my previous
presentation
way back a few minutes ago that
we have a,
that are the thing that keeps us up
and is medium sized
companies going
under our case study with this
is cano petroleum.
This is the company that came in
with a venture
gap or basically private investment
backing. They bought a lot of
wells and what they
found effectively was that when
they went to work over
those wells and, and test production
that just the holes were not
coming back the way that
they pull completely up.
Um And that left a
huge, a
huge amount of
liability. The cano field is
the site of some of
most of our our lugging
work with a huge amount of our employee
expenditures in a lot of our
environment.
Um And this is just
323 even
wells. Um 100 and
55 of those
are probably on State and
private lands.
Plugging liability or plugging
liability is changing
as the price of plugging
changes. What we're finding to 2024
so far is that our
plugging costs kind
of continue to go out for about 100
and $50,000 for.
That's just our downhill
work to be clear
when we go, when we
go down, figure
out what's this? The State of
the, the case was the State of the
plugs. That's really
all we're talking about with the plugging
liability. The environmental
ends up being
separate and of
course, cao had a
complete bond amount
of, of
$700,000.
So the next slide um
I realized they titled this the bonding
problem. These are the top
12 operators by volume
2020 State
are not really our bonding problem
because most of these
operators, we will never
go and recover their bond
or any of their, any of their
wells. Generally speaking, they just
throw the wells, they plug themselves
and they sell them with.
But I wanted to slide
to give you an idea of
disconnect
that we are seeing the well
that we are seeing at the level,
the level of bonding we have
up here at the sort of top of
the chain uh
in New Mexico
for,
didn't not include on the slide
and Corp energy, which we
always usually learn because they're
not in our large oil
users. They are our largest
oil boder in the State
by far
1000
most gas
floats.
So moving um
moving on to the next slide
here, I just grabbed a random
sample out of like a
page
spreadsheet with all of
our operators. This is
just a sort of random snapshot
of our mid-sized operators
organizing around
about 100 wells.
So is there a few, the
few above, few
below? Um
And this is I I included
here to give you an idea of what is
where the, where the risk
starts to in State a little
bit more. Um You can
see that some of these are we
house with, you know, pretty high
level of production and some
of them are weho with
extremely low levels
of production. So the question
that we look at this
as well, which of
these, where, where is the
risk? Which
one of these smaller lower
producing mid-sized operators
might be, might be the
next to
uh to be
up a lot of
liability on the
State for, for active
wells.
Um You just never
know
that last for 1000
years. Sure. The brain was
a minute.
Um So
moving on environment
risk, this is sort of the, the
hidden factor
um
in all of these rec
funded, you know,
evaluations is
environmental.
Um A lot of
these wells
have
are, are not like the picture.
You see the environmental
contamination is not on the
surface. It's not, you
don't really get to it until
we start moving hardware
off of the pad and
get the idea of
um what's going on down
there. Obviously, the, the
cost of this are
extremely high.
Um We'll have a little
bit of a better
illustration
that
the
last
exclamation that we
give.
So you can kind of see the
basic breakdown of
what is in what we call what's
in the Redon.
Um We manage basically,
we can be different types of funds. We
have the il funds
um which are
money that we get from the federal government
under purchase formula grant
program. They
have some restrictions on how
we can deploy them. Uh
The other are VOM funds
which to
just on the land after the
om is their entire process
for, for
uh
um they basically just
contract up to us to go to
work. And then
finally, our
um we call
a State RCK funds. Those are the
general funds that you all appropriating
for us.
Um When we are
dealing with the American situations
on the ground, um
There's a bunch of stuff spilling. We
don't know if it's mostly oil or mostly
water. We don't
know possible. We
don't know what to do. We go
in and use.
That's our, that's our
Switzer dollar.
Um,
uh,
so
practicing my life for I was
there.
Um, we spent about 26
million so far in like
24.
Um, we are recovering
into the 25. Now
we 10 to stay ahead of this,
we, we are
uh always usually able
to spend,
I was asked as
well, Mr. Chairman and Members to include
some information about
salary legalization out of the
reclamation fund
because this is an issue you certainly got
questions on. In the past, there
is a statutory authority for
us to take staff to administer
the record. Um
This is a year by year sort
of rundown on
slide
um of what those actual
expenditures for
uh for staff FTE staff
salary benefits have
been um
since 2008, we
can sort of a big spike there
during 2015
16. Um
forward
uh maybe
around the round house with the
budget down.
We rather precipitously on
that.
The division at the
time. I remember life was
uh the
fal
um to bring me up the
current, I think we did add one
last year, which is why you see that little
spike of 89. I think we
are a people currently
um
expenditures
um sources of the wreck
fund. Uh
primarily. Right now, there's a lot
of the, in addition to special
appropriations that we get in
our,
uh, need to get
out there in
the conservation
task.
729 from
last year related
are a change
to increase.
Right now, the, the proceeds
from the oran has tax
are well high and that 5 million
numbers,
I wasn't able to scare
up the actual,
uh, proceed to
the fund from the tax.
Uh, I
mean, the part
so, but the 5
million proposed incentive
49
2024
would definitely increase,
represent an increase.
That,
that's it for
me
over. And you're gonna hold
my,
>> thank you, Mr. Chair.
Basically, what,
uh, what I'd like to do
is find our
point and to try
to that
all the time. But
so I'll just give you a brief
overview, pull the
clothes to put it right in front.
Think it is.
It's still a lot of that.
That's a lot here.
That's a little better.
Ok. Uh,
basically
what, what I would
like to see, I
think the industry would like
to see is
that oil and
gas pays a number of
taxes to the State of New
Mexico
included within those
taxes as a conser
tax
since the 19
seventies, that
tax has largely
funded the
reclamation fund
that, uh, Mr.
Jones just talked
about
and thinking about
that fund
and the monies that
are available
to us
a by industry
and viewing
all of the attacks
that the industry has,
has sustained.
Over the years,
we were thinking
of trying to
come up with a mechanism
where the plugging and
reclamation liabilities
that the State
uh
undertakes as
Mr. Sheldon said, has
suspended
uh to clean up sites
and to plug wells
that we use this
fund as
it was intended
back in the 19 seventies.
And that is to mov'e
a portion of the
monies that
go into the recognition
fund
so that it can't
be uh well,
it can always be uh
rated as we've
done in the past. But I
try to designate
a significant amount of
money to
ensure
that the reclamation
obligations and
the plenty
obligations,
our remand.
And in fact, I would
encourage the O CD
to uh
step up except and
plugging some of these
uh abandon wells
and they estimate 1700
in the same. But
we have the money that's coming
into this fund if, if
we were designate it
for these purposes
to take care of those
and they're called
Orland Wells in
fairly short
order.
And we
also have some ideas
that uh maybe
the O CD could
contract out
that work to a
nonprofit or have
another entity
oversee that plugging
work so that we don't
have to go
through uh maybe the
bureaucratic uh
processes
that uh sometimes
hinder
or profit action.
So the idea,
well, let's talk about
funding the all gas
conservation tax
is
0.0019
when the price
of oil is
under $70 a
barrel. It moves
up to 0.0 syndrome
24.
when the price is
$70
or more per barrel,
to tell you what that is,
it's basically almost
12.5 cents. If it's
under $70
it's 16, almost
17 cents a barrel.
If it's over
$70 a
barrel, it
doesn't sound like much money. But
considering the tremendous
production that we
are seeing
these days, it
amounts to a lot of
money and it
amounts to a lot more money
than what uh
we requested in the
Senate bill this last
term. And
I think what they
imposed this uh
term by
uh
at least I think a couple
of Senators I picked it
up is that
uh we take 100 and
$50
million
into a fund
that would fund
plunging
and inflammation
activities within the State
and keep that
uh uh fund at
that level each
year so that the O
CD can
attend to the
uh duties
of plugging valves
and reclaiming
uh
the service
where
a responsible
operator
cannot be located
now among Well blow
and the circuits
reclaimed by
responsible operator.
We also know
that
there are operators
who are financially incapable
of doing that as
uh was presented on a
sl earlier.
Uh
Welles May line
themselves into a small
operator's hand who does
not have financial
wherewithal to,
to beat those uh
uh financial
obligations and they walk
away from,
we don't have debit prison
much so we can't do
anything about
that. What we can
do is use, but
from the oil and gas
industry through the
tag
to allow
the State to plug and abandon
the wells and it doesn't fall
on the shoulders of
the, uh,
t and so
that, in essence, is
the, is
the uh crux
of the idea that went
behind the bill, uh,
that, uh never be it
over to the house.
Uh And it's,
I believe it's
been working on now.
The numbers are a little judging.
I
Mr. Gels mentioned
uh 50 million
uh taking up to 100
and 50 million.
Uh
And to
be that, that
amount because we believe that is a
significant amount that
the 10 and
1700
wells, it also
uses
our
four mi
uh to give you an idea.
Uh right now,
well, 2022 the reclamation
fund balance little over
21 million
uh this past year
because of its influx
of federal money.
I think that reclamation
fund balance is
approximately $54
million. Uh
So
all we're asking is
that uh
the look to
this vile to do
what it was intended to do
and to
maybe a process
that uh
is easy.
I did a process
that uh the State doesn't
have to wonder where the money's
coming from. It's
there, it's a fund
and it's uh
funded
by the uh
conservation tax and
oil and gas uh
production in the same.
And frankly,
there's no better time than to
do this. Now,
this is the quantity of production
that New Mexico is,
is
experiencing.
We haven't do it now. Wait
10 years for production
declines.
There May be more of a
so called we.
Well,
the liability is
increased ability
to pay for. That is
the, so I would
encourage my colleagues,
the House and the Senate
to uh look
at doing something along these
lines and, and
I think there, there will be a
bill introduced
uh hopefully,
and thank you uh through
the system.
Hopefully with
Shelton's
support.
Thank, answer any
questions.
>> Thank you. Uh Going to Committee
First out Representative Saran
Young.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you
for your presentation. Both of you
um
start, I just like to
add,
I will start the one of
the things you said on
spills.
Um
find a bill
or,
or how do you find the spill? Is
it through inspections through
um self reporting by the,
the um entity?
How do we find those spills?
Tell me that person,
>> Mr. Chairman Representative
Sarah, I think those are the two
of the main avenues through
c course the and
inspections we also
get. So
people will call
and say
when
on my property or it's
like hys
uh when II
I,
we'll get it from all sorts of
different things
just about any public
area.
>> So Mr. Chairman, so
there could be that we
haven't thousands of spills
that nobody's ever rewarded or normally
severing to spend that
possible.
>> Um
>> Considering the amount of oil wells
we have >> hypothetically,
I would say, yeah, our 50,000
producing wells, I would say
that we have
almost 6.5
1000 that produce
less than 100 and 80
days kind of a
year which are, you
know, kind of to say
on the, on the decline. And
those once
seven
great a
large producers,
the reports still
generally speed
they design
before we ever get there.
So places that we let
me out of so producing lower,
producing wells.
But
for,
>> ok,
so the average,
said in your slide, the
average of the well is
A B, is that
correct?
>> We're about 100 and 50,000
for just the,
>> so what is the range?
How much can we get some
somewhere else? The really long ones,
how much can they
cost
>> again without the environmental
remediation? I think our range
on the low end, we
67,000
of the high end we had a
well about
$400,000
to see that.
>> I know there's bonding.
So and there are different levels of
bonding. So the
one you were just talking about
say, how much
money are they giving in bonding
for? Well, at this
point, some of these
larger
>> us, Mr. Fair representative
Sarinana
right now, Mosen Wells are
under bla loss.
So after
$250,000
can cover
anything from
three to the 300
bus
>> very
one
three to >> three >> 100. >> So
the more Mr.
Chairman represent more and
more the blanket bond
is it's a blanket
bond that's captain at the top
end. So that's really where
that's the thing that's
responsible. Uh
I would say, you know, most of our
bonding fall is the availability
of those blankets.
So >> do we really
ever get any amount of money to
cover the cost to
clean this up for
bonding?
>> A blanket bond
again at
100 and $50,000
for. Well, a blanket bond
is
you're hitting just the average
on every single, well, a little
less than two
Bs right now.
And >> Mr. Chairman as these, we
get bigger, it's
just not gonna happen as far as
cutting.
>> Uh, yeah, we
are, we are
hundreds of millions of dollars
in all based
on not just the
1700
that Senator
Iver alluded to, but also
the outstanding liability
of
the potential for future wells
that
50,000 currently
operating producing
wells in the
State,
1% of
that 50,000 moves
down and demand chain
winds up in the hands of an operator
that cannot claim
it properly and it becomes an
orphan. Um
That's for tens, tens
of millions of and quickly spiraling
about hundreds of millions of
dollars.
>> Mr. Chairman does that happen often where
a large
eventually sends it down to a small
when they can or, and
the the cost
that have often or what percentage
of our wealth that I mean, people
can be.
>> That's a great question, Mr. Chairman
and Representative Sarinana. I don't
know that the exact percentage, you
know, the the other way that we wind
up for the or wells is just
as I alluded to in the previous panel,
mid-sized operators just
tipping over and that's
when we had over, you know, a
few 100 at a time
to the State role, which is, which
is really painful in addition to
certain with the
split and what we would
define as abandoned
well, between
abandoned by very small
operators by
large, large,
I should say size
o turn it over is I, I
don't know that I,
>> I
just wanted to stop you
once.
Um My next question for uh
Senator Nr
um
So
why would we want to do what you
want us to do in this
bill? What
benefit is it to the
State?
>> It's the wells white
and abandoned. It
gets the
uh service reclaimed
in a much stronger
fashion. It
doesn't
require
consentual pros to
go through that process.
But if you pass a bill
money is there.
And as long as,
as, as long as
we are collecting at
least 100 and $50
million a year
uh in the concentration
tax money is there,
this Legislation
chooses to
uh
appropriate
I send it elsewhere,
>> Mr. Chairman. So I
um the money is there in a
lot of things. We just don't have the
capacity of our agencies to
do it. So
um Mr.
Sheldon would you have?
So your inspectors don't
just inspect, right? Is
that true in some of these
things? We have inspectors
to do the
work,
they don't do, just inspect.
So getting it done, getting
what we need to be done to the
people you have. Can it be,
can it be done
quickly?
>> Uh Mr. Chairman Representative,
the actual Luggin well, is
not by inspectors.
We contract out that. So we
have on current currently
we have five teams that are on the
State payroll, uh the
plug wells, they plug that
well.
Uh
Yeah, and all,
all conditions normal and
that. Well, I,
I don't know. And
that also
a good question. So we're, we are,
we don't struggle with the spending the
money generally, whether
or not we are doing fast
function and how
many teams that we have, we
are restricted by the statewide
price.
>> So how long would it take us
Mr. Chairman to plug all the
wells that the industry
is?
Yes.
And because the
>> 1700 wells
currently in times
51 which
represent
um and it it
takes a long time because the the
other thing to remember Mr. Chairman
of that, so we don't just
like to mov'e, we don't
consider a site finished until
it, it's,
it's the environment recognition that
can take years.
Um So
that that is something
that's the tax.
So that's what we see in terms
of. And
then the other thing of
that,
that adventure happen when the
fiscal year time over
basically all of our purchase
orders close, we have to
stop all the work
while we do purchase
orders on
which is,
yeah, speaking of
the entire department
annoying for O CD
dangerous force to
have for that.
But that's a
prom a
ok
>> if I May.
Uh that is one reason
why we explored
posibility of
most enable a
contract with nonprofit
agency. Uh There's
several girls that
area oversedation
have
Sanli
material or
the cost regimens.
And we were looking at
that, that as a
model, maybe
how to handle this and
give more wells than
what I mean. So uh
in the O
CD, the
contract
problem with
an a program,
they alleviate some
of the hurdles that
are existing within
the agents.
>> Um is,
so, is that a problem, is
there a problem with that in O CD
or LSC
or
>> Mr. Chairman Representative said you
don't have the exact mechanics
was contracted with a nonprofit.
My understanding now
that we are face and
by what's on the statewide price
that are the menu was,
what is available to
us is what
is on
that? They are all
that are um
based in Farmington. We put
that in our, we got
zero responses from the Permian
for B so
we also,
and as the State you pay a
little more because the need
to drive
Farmington to the Permian or
we have to pay a little bit on
standby, the Carls
back.
Uh So
we pay a little bit
extra, but that, uh
that's a question I think that goes back
to.
>> So we know you're working on
it and you guys wanted them,
we're working on it. Um I
know you work hard. So,
um I think that's what my questions.
Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Representative Senator
>> Murch
Mr. Chair. Thank you very much. I'll
pull
Mylo
um,
appreciate you all being here.
Thank you for
your, your, your preparation
and likewise,
Senator and I would thank you for being
here, offer
some solutions here. There's
a few questions. So
we said the 250,000
is a blanket bond, but
that's just for the lowest
number of wealth,
correct
bonds increase
as you reach certain thresholds of
ownership.
>> Uh Mr. Chairman,
Senator, no, $350,000
is the, that is an absolute cap.
Um We can, we can assess it
multiple times
back with different bonding
requests for
different deals generally,
but it's always capped
$2000 which
generally you will see the
maximum bonding
held by any given company about
one great fire.
OK. >> Thank you very
much for that.
Um
So, historically,
what's happened with,
you know, that operator and, and let
me just reference some of my
statements and then I
don't like the State have to
pay for
that. I think we
can all agree with
that.
So we would prefer everybody's a good
operator. They will follow the
rules
and
you know, they clean up their own
messes. But that's the
reason why we have the,
the conservation
fund and that's why it was developed
so many years ago
as, as the State of New Mexico.
I know it's happened in Wyoming and other
states. Have they gone
after
larger operators in the
chain of tiding
when the smaller
operators that currently on the
wells are not able
to meet their volume
liability?
>> Mr. Chairman and Senator
mccutchen. Yes, I think that when
you see a fair amount
of uh
authorizing the third parties
to come in blood, uh
sometimes I would say
mostly that is kind
of the landlord. So for
instance, I,
I should say
this is the one who will
go back to sleep and off
is particularly
good about getting these
school to come in and
sure that they're backing the
operators.
Um We
do occasionally
authorize
operators or
the company drill the
well and to come
in uh to come in and
drill there to come in and there
are
potentially
that come into play as well where
different operators want different
date for production
reasons.
Ok, >> thank
you. Uh
Do we have any idea of the
percentage? You said we've got
70,000 operating
wells and 1700
Ish
Orland or abandon
wells? Not, not
p and a not loving, abandon or
love
>> uh Mr. Chairman said
we got, we, we don't
things exist, we don't
actually need that. You have
a definition of an orphan. Well,
we can sw the subset of our
inactive wells instead of
Mexico. So yes, we have
about um
50,000
producing
oil and gas wells in New
Mexico. Currently. 1700.
We kind of know whatever
a lot. Sure or
you could consider abandoned. I will say
that there's a number
out there of a lot of stuff that
would also meet this criteria
is have characters,
>> ok. Uh >> Running
that 50,000 number,
that's about, that's
about
0.035
3.5% I
guess total
whales uh
are,
are,
are left abandon,
right? And so we're looking to
plug those and if
we're talking about in
100 and 50 million in the
reclamation
fund,
that's gonna blow me,
you know, 1000 a
year, I guess that is
that direct. So essentially in
two years, obviously
labor and all those things,
essentially two years, 300
million will clean up the
downhill portion but
not the surface
exposure.
>> Uh Mr. Chair
and blood some
cal behind.
So I think that that sounds about
right again. The question is
not uh
the time question is
this,
we're not, you know,
if I was able to plug them
six volts a day,
I just need finding, we can
do
>> Mr. Chair and
Secretary Sheldon.
Uh Do you guys deal
directly with contractors help
me understand how the lugging
process works.
Are you dealing directly with contractors?
Are you giving them packages
to do? Is it on an individual
basis? Obviously, I'm
sure the change orders are night. Just
a nightmare because, you know, by
the time you get in your operation of
see in, you have to shoot, you gotta
do all of those different things. I'm sure
they, they, they take a lot of
overstate, are you
doing those in, in
packages that could
potentially extend that
your, your physical year
issues or is it kind
of Burwell a
big issues?
>> Uh Mr. Jarre, I, I think you
can be stuck there in terms of how they're actually
dispatching, whether they're giving a package
to the contractor working well
by well, um,
I don't know, but I, what
I can tell you is that there is a
free character
by the for
dispatch. So,
um, which also mov'e
to the time and expense
is that we tend to triage
the worst wells, the ones
that are actively
methane have sent these things
that are
two.
But by the time you gonna get that
team out into the, the middle
that dusty and they locate
the thing and they chase the family raccoons
out of there and actually get to get down
hole and figure out what's going on.
They can add a long time, they're gonna have a lot
of space. That's another
part of this, you know, you can
be the State
for
>> uh >> Mr. Chair Secretary
Chilton. Are, are you saying
that orphan wells
are a good place for
our?
Um, just give you a hard
time there. Um Maybe my
next question. Um
Mr. Chair is probably for
Senator and I would,
we've had the bone, the
conservation bone rated
over a number of
years. Do you have a number
that it, that it should have in
it? Uh
Not, not over a number of years
but potentially right now as it's
set up how much it should
be generating
in your
legs.
>> I don't even know
that number, but
uh
the amount
of, of
tax collected
in the conservation uh
from the conservation
tax is many
times what we would
designate
uh as
we put in the
reclamation fund and
health uh
solely for the purpose
of carrying out this
regulating and plugging and
abandonment or
we're asking for, for a
small sliver
to buy actually
right now that that
amount of money that's
coming into
the uh
concentrating tax
is, is
enormous
and many times 100 and
$50 million I'm
sure. Um
And so we
feel so,
you know, most of it goes
into the general fund,
I think right now,
uh by
sta
reformation, if I was
only given what
2/17
2019
17th of
uh the conspiring
tax uh collections.
So it's, it's just receiving
a small sort of
the overall tax,
whatever. Uh
So,
you know what we're trying to do
is find
a pool of money to
accomplish or that
the agency wants to
accomplish and
hopefully do it in a manner
that, uh,
the is
allowing more from
Reon.
>> Thank you, Senator.
Um, another
question or maybe it's, maybe it's
part of a comment.
Um, it, it seems to
me that
we probably have II,
I know we
do
and we, in the oldfield we
see good operators
and much more good operator
operators. Most
of the land guys that I
call when we
notice
something is
cleaned up immediately.
Um, you know, we had a still
not too long ago and
a truck it was, it's
passing by and they just pulled over on the
side of the road. They done
that. I
called, I called
a couple of companies that were working in the
area. It wasn't there
still and they ely jump
on it to clean it up because they're, they're
good operators. So I hate, I
hate the change,
you know, good
operators,
you know, with a few bad
ones, which is really what we're,
which is really what we have here.
And it seems to me that we have
a catalyst in place
and we are punishing all
the operators or at least,
you know, sharing in some of
the risks of industry. I
guess that we have
those larger operators
are painting the small operators
already with the conservation
tax. And so
by increasing the bonding
amount, we could
potentially
take some smaller operators.
Some of those are good as well
and they're producing much needed
revenue to the tune. I
think the document says
14 to 20%
come from, come from
sugar wells, walking
100% of the total production
in the State of New Mexico comes from sugar
wells. And so
what we have is is
probably some of those smaller
operators on
the
are the ones more
at risk of coming
up with these stills
or leaving abandoned wells. But
we're charging all the large
operators already
a tax because that's
essentially what that is
to, to recognize, make those
wells and with the,
with the prior answer
from Secretary Shelton,
but now we have
in some cases in the past
gone up the chain of title
to a larger operator,
they're paying for that twice.
So therefore they are motivated
and, and, and vetting those
smaller operators
with less over annual
things like that, many smaller
operators before
they sell them those wells. I know that's
been a conversation,
you know, in the county
a lot about, you know, who
would take over these smaller
assets. You know, for
example, you know, Oxy
or Chevron, they
simply have
to know that they're going to be
red company because they know that
they're on the hook because their name
is simply on the chain of
title. And so,
uh appreciate everybody
working together here
and, and your ideas
on I just
increasing or, you
know, allocating more to
the fund. It sounds like we have
a couple of stop gaps. You
know, the Secretary Sheldon
plugging one well, a week
with five crews.
That's, I guess
that's, and that's
pretty slow. So we're either, where are
we doing? 50 a year or
250 a year is each
crew doing
one that's
five years of 50 a
year.
So, uh,
man, that's pretty tough. That's only
five weeks, I guess for
the, for the,
for the guys that are there. So,
um but I appreciate
you to be able to do that. I think the catalyst is
in place, but you know, it's not gonna let out
operators and
I don't agree with them,
you know, but uh
I've been thinking about things in place to
pick up. Thank you
very much, Mr. Chair.
They, you >> said. So
we are now over time with this
chemical as well. Um
Several people on the list
and I know
that
our representative
briefly
mu
I speak German. I always
have
>> stage right before I
tell.
But anyway, thank
you all for being here today
for
>> everyone. That speech
right before
they
>> um
the up again,
right?
Whenever you're talking about uh
Secretary Shelter, whenever
you're talking about flogging
oil, there is a variant though as
far as the depth goes. Isn't that
correct,
>> Mr. Chairman and Representative?
Yes.
>> So whenever we're talking about
these people that do
come in, they pay involved,
they're a company
whenever they do like them, their
wills themselves, you do
have an inspection team goes
out, make sure
that they have done it in, in
accordance with what your
say
that
>> generally speaking. Yeah, that's my
understanding. We go
out.
>> Ok. And
uh mystery
of
>> Chairman Land.
Ok,
>> madam Chair.
Uh, I guess my concern
is whenever you put
your
together for this, why
did you not use updated
picture this one offends
me right here because that is not
a way. Best operators in our
State are doing
business in our State
right now. So I, I'm
offended by the picture. You have
been in this one
right here. We've got oil
all over the place. II, I
have a problem with that because
that is not how our
operators
work. And
if we are talking about,
um,
you said that of a pre
uh you're going to have
to go back on some of the
wheels that were plugged prior to
World War Two. Is that
correct?
>> Uh madam Chair and, and
Representative Zell.
Yeah, we've got, well, I think our
oldest, well,
is a 1907
drill. A lot of wells
that were the cement standards,
the oil and gas,
our standards for, well,
uh were not in
place but a lot of the stuff that we
were claim was
was
>> Okon. Uh
Yes, I was there whenever
this fund was
depleted
and it was not pretty.
We were a hard
time right then in the State of New
Mexico. And
uh what happened to the
oil and gas industry back
to the State as a whole
and it was not,
this fund was depleted.
There was that through
rules
of
Secretary Shelton
whenever those funds were
taken out
of,
taken out of a
CD for pay
payment and
salaries.
>> Uh madam
Chair and representative, I
think that that was probably part
just the standard budget setting
process in that in that
year. Uh
those funds were, I think
accommodated. I'm not sure what the
Executive recommendation there looked
like, but they were sw
on some variety, I believe
the other State that
those 2 to 3
year.
>> Ok. >> Thank you for >> that. But
it was not a good time to
stay in the. It
really was.
I remember a signature
number. I called to
sign.
Do you know the number or
maybe both? Either one of you all
can answer this. Do
we know how many, what
is the number of the small operators
can stay >> right
now?
I don't know how many small
operators have. It's
probably
quite large.
It's the
last
time I looked at all the
operators of the State,
the close
of oil and gas production
is uh
secured by the
top
but
1520
increaser.
Uh and then
we have a lot of small
producers that have, you
know, sometimes one or
two gloves and
so the numbers of
people
goosey are
large, the quantity,
the oil
and gas
bos
smalls generally
quite.
>> But yet
Senator, when
you say that taxes are still
paid out of those few barrels
that those Ws do
produce. And that is also
helping the economy and those local
areas. >> Yes, the,
the tax doesn't
discriminate
on
who the producer is. The
taxes on a barrel
of oil for 1000
cubic feet
of.
>> It's the same for everybody no
matter the cost.
And yes, there are some bad
editors out there and they do need
to be responsible for what
they have done to
as far as not doing
what they are doing to
uphold the standards of the
industry. That's my thoughts
on it. I understand
what we're trying to do here with
this. And when
you both agree and I think you
probably will whenever I say,
wouldn't this be industry
working for
industry?
>> That's how I would characterize
it is industry
to my knowledge fully
supports this idea
of creating this,
this
designated fund
that could be counted on year
after year to take care
of the, the
uh so-called Orland wells.
We May disagree with
the agency as to the number
of Orland wells that actually
exist, but we
do agree that the
fund ought to be
there. It ought to be
easily accessed.
And we want to
work with the agency
to make sure that there
is a mechanism to
get more than 50 wells
a year one and abandon.
We'd like to see that
backlog taking
zero, but 100 and 50
million is
approximately
1000 wells. While we
realize we probably don't have
the, the, the
quantity
of
out there to plug 1000
miles. But within
several years we ought to be
able to have that
law completely.
One. So
that, that is our, that is our
bottom. That's, I think,
give us so
we just like to see that, that
money according to the purpose
of which.
>> But what I do want to
stress the
Secretary Shelton, I think
you will agree is the amount
of people that actually go
out there
abandoning these stripper
wells. Sometimes it's not
because they're
just, it's
mainly because if there's a
downtick in the price of
oil or the G
gasses
so volatile anyway,
but whenever there's a downtick
in the price of
oil that they
really can't
afford to go in there and do
the themselves. Is that
correct?
>> Um Mr. Chair
represented by say, sometimes it
doesn't even take a change in the
price
operators and take
ownership while not
having the capacity of
one day.
>> Thank you very much for your
responses. >> Well,
the, the other issue
there are, there
was
sometimes
the operator
wants to keep that
inactive because there could
be a potential future
use for that bone
and they don't want to plug it
back into where
they eliminate
all future
potential economic
uses of that.
Exactly. Thank
you.
>> Thank you uh beside the
m
>> thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you,
Senator. I actually think
this is a great idea.
I uh I am
curious um
about uh what you
need to put a Noro together
to do this. What made you
uh
the
uh Members
decide to go in that
direction?
>> I think uh the end
is really,
you know, use this
as a source
of the beauty industry black
out and they would like to see the
backlog
taking care of them
and the sooner we get the
backlog taken care
of and just
deal with
whatever
subsequent
wells they can't
find a, a
responsible person to
blood your demand of them.
Uh We'd like to see that
taken care of as quickly as
possible. The disagree
world flows
with issues
concerning in
a species in
Southeast Mexico
and, and that is all
contracted out through a
nonprofit agency.
And if for that,
and they seem to be able to
get things done in a
very
provision mechanism
and they contracted
with airway management,
how they contract with
the OD or not.
They have a contract,
they're able to do things in a
much more prompt
fashion and
also don't have to worry
about some of the
procurement processes
that the State government
has to worry about. They
don't have to worry about
the, a
lot of the ways they can
get into the job,
the industry just wants the job
done. And so
that's, that's a
degen,
>> oh, we just, and Southerner,
I worked with the engineers
without borders on
water issues in the north
and, and they've been a helpful group
too. And uh I, I
really think that is the right
direction to go if we
can, we can plug
1000 miles a year
instead of a year
and do it,
uh, in a, in a way where people get a good
salary, but we're not making
a profit on the State. That
would be good news to me. Thank
you. >> I think the
other issue is,
uh, the, the
contract went to.
So Senator >> like
to mov'e on, I will
remind you to go through the
gym.
>> I
>> remember
thank you, Mr. Chair,
uh Senator
Geimer. Um,
with, with this
uh in
place the
in the oil
conservation tax
as it was originally
intended to be
for its changed
in the two thousands.
Um, you know, it
seems to me
that
many of the topics we're
talking about where well
transfers, the
bombing
shortage
of the,
the backlog
of
uh orphan wells.
Um This
solution
would address all
of those things as
do you think that's
correct
>> if the, if the
issue is that
there are people
operating
who leave
the citizens of
Mexico with
uh
financial responsibilities
to clean up
wildness
and if that's the
purpose of a bond,
then this
regulation fund
that it's used in this fashion
should address
the financial insurance
issues as well
because we, we not
only have the
plan, whatever
money is there,
whether it's low or
plan, we have
one, but this
really give the back
of the business
money that
can the fact of oiling
days and
supplies a
more fun
like viable
conservation
to utilize
it for the purposes of reclamation
and plug your
family
>> Mr. Chair as
well. II I just, I wanted
to clarify, this is a
tool, this is not
a
soI
definitely,
I think it should be very, very
to stay solvent
and working to
both. But I think this is a problem
that you have to tackle.
That's the liability
that goes to the State and growing
funds of the State need it. But
without I think,
doing some work to close the
bonding gap, that's
getting just
more the practice of lugging
the wells instead of selling
assets, um,
to
sell some assets to
trouble a
can to a we're
losing the,
um, just it,
it is a very,
very, so one thing is that
a good idea. I
have Big Asters, is that
what I
think?
But, um, but I
hated
some.
>> Thank you. That was all I had
was
>> thank you for that.
Um, so I've got a
couple of acquaintance.
Um, first off
for Senator Diver,
talked about the
amount of conservation
taxes being a very large
liver.
Um,
do you know what that have
been?
>> I, I do
the math but
all
what the ball
turn, >> give
me an estimate. What's the
apartment?
>> I have a lot of cheese.
Exactly.
When we discuss the
bill and discuss 100
and $50 million a
year, it
was a mere
fraction of
what was being
collected in the conservation
tax. The last couple of
years. Uh So
we're talking about
uh
probably in
the high
hundreds of millions, maybe in
the billions of dollars that it's
been collected.
>> Ok. And would, would you fund
the, the
fund by changing
that to 19
definition
or how, how
we, how would you
define the
new, new and
improved? More information
that
>> the, the
uh conservation
tax? 29 go
to the conser of the
conservation tax, go to
the reclamation.
Obviously, it would have
to be sufficient. Whatever
the fraction is that to be
sufficient, the
$150
million and,
and by the way,
that would not be each and
every year, if
O CD only spent
100 of 100 and 50
billion, there would still be 50
million in the in the
fund. So it would be 100
million back.
They only spent 75
million and 75
million at least go
into the fund next.
Uh So we ended
on the
usage of
that fund,
but hopefully, uh
they would be using
a large number
the first few years to get
to the flog and
to get this places
plan after a
while, probably
be entire small
number if we're not able to
approach 100 and
50. And if you ask where we
came up with 100 and
50 I
at least about 1000
just kind of
out of the air and bill.
Last second, I
think was
uh
I think that's what, what did
80 that we've
been the schedules this
year we've
got. So you
need 17 to 100
over. Well, and
figure if we can
get 1000
knocked out a year,
that would be a good number. And that
doesn't, you know, the rec
invention. That's just a
little bit. But
then
so,
>> ok. And would you,
uh,
secure
she to do some of the data
that found the
number
in 2020 physical or 2020
can be some
old
oil and gas conservation tax total
generated number of
dollars which have
27 million of that
change
population points to the
background.
but that's a lot
less
>> billions. Yeah.
Um
ok.
And so that's, I mean that bills
gonna score with a pretty high
fiscal impact because you're taking
that money out of the
general fund,
right? We
are,
uh, would you do away with the
ability to draw
on the reclamation fund to pay
for staff salaries or is
that a
non, non
material amount of money in the
>> overall scheme?
>> My personal opinion, it's
not a material
fact, actually get
to 2016
when it was 34
million or whatever the picture
was. Uh,
but $200,000
is in material
your mind.
>> Ok. And this,
it sounds to me like this if
we
potentially accelerate
the rate at which we
kept on the abandoned
wells. Um,
but this is
in addition to and
not in lieu of
bond.
I, I think that's what I heard,
Mr. Shelton say.
Do you agree with that? Certainly,
my,
>> I agree that that's what we
do and,
and if introduce in
its current form will
do, uh,
he has my opinion. I
wish it would be a
little,
but that's my own
personal
and >> I guess the, the question
is we still have an issue
with bond being
insufficient to cover
potential liability.
That's my concern >> and you
always will
because a bond is only as
good as the bonding company
that backs them.
>> Yeah, I mean, that's certainly
part of it, but there's,
there's also, you know, the idea
that we have many,
many wells on the blanket
bar that have the 250,000.
And my concern is,
you know, that Mr.
Shelton cited the example
of a particular company going
out and leaving us
holding the bag. I think
if there's a substantial downturn
in the industry,
we get hit hard all at
once and the
250,000 is not gonna
be sufficient.
That's, that's my
concern
>> and
that,
you know, if my
professional career,
we go through
many ups and
downs to have
that
the uh downs
are, are
really dub they're really
bad and it
not just affects the State,
it affects the
fine immunity
by far the stay
immensely.
And
uh
in
fact,
all these companies
and it affects the bonding
companies as well.
Uh And that's why I say, you
know, they have bonds,
bonds are only as good as
the bonding company that's
backing.
So there's,
if there are downturns
like we've experienced in the
past, uh
you know, we, we
do have problems, that's why
there's fund in
environment is
so critical. They
were up to me, I do the whole
thing if
you know that
much out of the
general fund, probably
tougher, tougher road
to $150
million doable to
kill a budget
cycle of
Glasgow.
>> And um Gentlemen,
thank you both for the
presentation. Uh I
was aware of this bill in the
last Session and as
you said, you keep office in the house. So
I was curious to know
more about it and >> I, I
appreciate the
>> presentation.
Um, before we go
to the next panel, I hate to do this,
but we need to get done.
We have minutes from
two meetings.
They were in your pocket.
Uh So first off,
we have the minutes
from the August
beating and Seor, I
have a moir
those
by second
by
out of the opposition
uh uh
and the minutes from September
and Pleasant of
motion.
Sorry, now that
second
and the decision.
Ok. So those are,
uh are
I'd love to say that our last panel
of the name
on our taking the last panel of
the day, um
come on up,
uh betting heralds
implementation
effectiveness
>> and >> permanency,
uh
uh
Deputy
Secretary
Sheldon.
Um
she'll be on the and
energy and
so we usually go
ordering a beer.
Um >> Mr.
Hilton,
thank you, Mr. Chair Members. This
one is going to be very, very, very for me
because we're
just to be providing
kind of the same high level update
and then a
snapshot of her
question.
G
she this
just a reminder of
the
uh
O CD really only handles
the waste component
of the
that in
9%.
But we kind of run.
Um
You can see on the
sli
um moving alongside
of the gates just to
remind you all how we got here. This
is a fairly
lengthening process,
promulgation side. We did all
this year. I would say
technical
themes and
work before
the
oh
uh most of our operations
are currently
actively reporting.
Um I
know
anticipating comment in
the question, the emissions
measurements don't always
thrive 13% of
my point or again,
the waste and looking
at missions. It's not,
that's Michelle's gonna
get what I'm talking about. So
if I are not
trying to put an overly nosy
spin on this, the
results was precisely,
do you have uh
exceptions about what we
consider to be uh
production? Well,
things like sour gas
or regular
drilling activity
are permissible,
declaring
there's a bunch of things to
go,
but you are
um on the whole
pretty happy with
um progress.
You
now we feel we think
we measured, we captured
about 50 million
of gas that used to have been
invented or flare that is
now
cycle
been captured.
Taxed. What
success by this
that in the last
minds will
pass.
>> Thank you, Deputy Secretary.
Good afternoon,
Chely.
Um following
uh
Deputy Secretary of
the City was
role uh
reminder of how we
got here.
>> You right
in front of you so you can speak right
into
it
>> from the New Mexico Environment
Department side. I
want to also
offer the reminder of
the lengthy rule
making that our
department went through
to probably part
50 or our
ozone precursor
rules. This
is a non invention
rule that the New Mexico
Environment Department
after many years
of stakeholder
outreach. And
that rule
is as is
the O CD waste
rule a phase in
rule and
2024 is a
big phase being
year for that
rule. And that
phase and continues
through the year
2030.
So uh as a
reminder, this was a
rule that
the
department
to
um promulgate
as a result of
the high ozone
levels and
the ozone detainment
initiative that
it um
began uh
I think it was
in the early years of
this
administration.
And so the
real focus of the ozone,
the initiative,
which um if
this is in alignment with some
of the discussion
earlier today, um
ground level ozone
is a
criteria for the
under the Clean Air Act
and in
uh several
areas of the State
of New Mexico, it is exceeding
the federal health
threshold. And
even if we're not over
that federal threshold, State
law requires us to,
to um put
measures in place
uh if we're closing
in on 98%
of that threshold
in order to prevent us
from surpassing
that. And so
we focused our
part
on uh
addressing
oxides of nitrogen
and volle
organic compounds,
those ozone
precursors to
address those increasing
ozone design values
that I heard about earlier.
As a result of the
ozone precursor
rule, we
anticipate
106,420
tons of volatile
organic compounds removed
from the air as
well as over
23,000 tons
of uh oxides
of nitrogen.
A cobe of
this rule um
as was being
developed um in
hand with the O CD waste
rule is
the decreasing of
methane as a result
of uh addressing
the
ozone.
And so we anticipate
that um when
fully implemented
the ozone precursor
rules will
decrease methane
by about
200 to
425,000
tons. And
that equates to 1.2
million of the
power equivalent to
powered 1.2
million rules every
year. So that
was a precursor rule,
began implementation in
2022.
Since then. Uh we
have had the
implementation of a new
federal method
and that new federal methane
rule um
is uh
was promulgated
in uh just a few
months ago earlier this
year. And it came
into effect setting new
mission standards and compliance
schedules for crude oil
and natural gas facilities
uh that
relied on the
park 50 rule as
a basis for its
development. So you will see
a lot of the same
um
provisions in our
part 50 rule or,
or DP A and
its
uh methane
rule. So the new
methane will be
called in the
Environment Department,
Guto B and Guto
C. Um
Quao addresses
uh the
um greenhouse gasses
and other air li that
are coming from the oil
and gas facilities,
um the
newer oil and gas
facilities and then
what we see
um is backward looking
and uh creates
compliance schedules
for
this crude oil and
natural gas facilities.
And so under
one OC,
the EPA has
instructed us as a State
to create a State
implementation plan,
incorporating the
new emissions guidelines
by March 9th
2026. So
this is the federal
law that we
are going to be integrating
into our
air
regulatory
environment.
Now,
there is a
overlap between
hard 50
the new me. So
what we're doing right now
is we are
looking at the
part 50
rules and we
are looking at
the new
methane rules for
which EPA has
provided us a model
rule and are
cohering them to determine the
best path forward
for our State
implementation
and to
go a little bit deeper
and what the State
implementation plan
is, this really
creates that permanency
piece for the
regulations. It's
a collection of regulations
and documents inspire
us as a State to
implement, maintain and
enforce of
air pollution standards and
fulfill other requirements
of the Clean Air
Act. Um
We are going to
enrich the implementation
plan, provide a plan
for implementation,
maintenance and enforcement
of the rule
and we will be
submitting that
rule to the
EPA
for the
uh for
Quad O
specifically
that work those
requirements,
inventories of
designated facilities
and from those
facilities, compliance
schedules, standards of
performance, test
of modern record
keeping,
documentation
and other requirements
that are, you know, have
similarities with part
50. So we
anticipate that a lot
of what is required
under new
EPA meth rule
is already implemented
by the industry.
And it's been quite
encouraging um this
past year going
to um several
conferences
in uh Houston
and Austin and learning
about new movement
technologies that
industry has been
implemented
in um the
oil and gas basins
and it
is incredible
spaceship
level monitoring.
I mean, it's pretty wild
and a lot
of the um
technologies
are
um
you know, are being
evaluated by companies
at this time can be
implemented and then companies
are trying to find which
technology and approach
works for them for purposes
of
compliance.
So to reiterate
the State, we as a
State must submit, a State
wouldn't
um to address
the new methane rules with oil and
gas facilities to
a by
March the 9th
2026.
And as it is
true with other State
implementation State,
he as a State do
not. Our State implementation
rule we run the risk
of would like
the federal
government create
its own rules for
us that there would be
a federal
implementation
plan and
we call that big at
the environment department
and no one wants this
because we
as a State are allowed to
have more control
and submit the
State of
the State version
as far as
effectiveness. Um
We are
very much aware as
these new technologies are coming
on board that are being
used by the industry
that there's also a
lot of
monetary uh
and satellite data,
bio data that's being
provided to us
and publicly available
for um that
is looking at
me beaks in our
State and around the
world. But of
course, the
zero wind of New Mexico And
so we really been
utilizing this technology
to understand where
those
are and really
target test board
inspections and
enforcement board around
where those are performing
so that we can be more
targeted
in uh what
we're seeing. So we can even
space and the
realm
flyovers,
you can see, um,
they gloom over
time. And so at
least to see
over and over
and over again, that
tells us that this is not
a quote unquote
emergency event.
It is actually
something that might be stomach
and weight because
um that these
operations are being
conducted and we need to
address that. And
so, um
in the anticipation
of um
utilizing the sate
satellite technology for
that, we have
been utilizing it
or um we might have
noted that we have
conducted joint sections
with a
and um satellite
technology and other
ways to look
at this data that we
formed where
we went. And
so we um of course,
or eta rather is
still processing those
because they're taking the
laboring more on that.
But we're very excited
to begin utilizing that
technology to
get a close up look at what's
happening on the ground.
Um We also
in effort to
be more transparent
about what kind of compliance
and enforcement interactions for
a we this
year started our enforcement
watch. So you can
see online
now um
where our endorsement
actions are
um geographically and
by company. And
then we did update
our civil penalty
policy.
Effective. Um October
4th that was
in need of updating.
Uh And I'm stay
is,
um, you
know, a note
to uh
the good actors
in oil and gas that
we have nothing to worry about. And
it's not for the bad actors
in the oil and gas that,
you know, if we find
infamous data
and inspections. And from
this reporting, we're
really gonna be taking a hard
book um under
our new
civil penalty
pumps.
I I passive
one.
I
>> thank you both. Uh My
panel presentation is about
this, forgive me for the lacking
out we law
Center shy must be going
over to the PC uh
Mr. Chair Members of the Committee.
My name is Ilin. I'm
the Executive Director of
Western Department Law Center.
Wanted to start as by express
my gratitude both to
the Environment Department
and the Energy
Minerals Resources Department
or the good work they've done in
place these
methane and ozone pretty
curs rules. They are definitely
different State. And
my bottom line
point that I want to leave you with
it to
support this effort
because it's very important.
I wanted to start by just a little bit
of level setting in terms of
where we're at,
in terms of global warming and
climate change and
global decarbonisation.
And as well as decarbonization
here in New
Mexico United
Nations Environment Program
just published this report about
two weeks ago. And the bottom
line here is we are
making virtually no
progress in terms
of decarbonizing
our world
and the New
Mexico sign an equation
adit and we're
on track right now for
2.9 °C
of warming that
would be
catastrophic.
This is an analysis
done by the Environmental Defense
Fund back in September
2023 taking
a look at the progress we made
here in New Mexico in terms
of decarbonization and
it background governing New Longridge
put in place the Executive
decarbonize the State
economy. We
have done gluten things, the Energy
Transition Act decarbonize,
decarbonizing the electricity
sector. And also with these methane
rules. Unfortunately,
we are not making that much
progress, anything
basically flat aligned
in terms of the State
climate commitments,
decarbonization commitments. And
this is of course a big problem.
We do have opportunities here
to increase better and
as enforcement of the methane
rules and there was a rigorous
rules for part of that
process.
Um I don't need to
get into the impacts of
climate change, but this
is looking at what that
perspective warming looks like based
on the un environment
programs analysis.
Again, looking at
2.9 °C
that is likely to be worse in
New Mexico and just give it way
that warming is distributed
around the world in
New Mexico. What this will mean is more
dirt and more severe
wildfires as well
as densify drought.
And a so this
is something that the State of New Mexico
has a vested interest in
interesting as aggressively
as possible
with ozone precursor
and methane rules. Looking
at the oil and gas sector
here in New Mexico, just
also to take a look at what we're talking
about. State
data. We have
54,000
producing oil and gas wells.
This is separate from all the
legacy wells that are out on a
landscape including
abandoned wells or orphan
wells in the we're talking
about especially mis
recommend. Other
key factor here is we have
30,000
approved but not yet
drilled
well in New
Mexico. So the oil
and gas production here in the
sea is likely to
intensify and the amount of
infrastructure we have
on the ground is poised
to
intensify.
Take a look at
why the legislators
work full implementation
and enforcement of the rules and a
degree. We can ratchet
up the ambition again, taking
a look at what the global
decarbonization trends are.
They're not good. And so
we really need to take a
look at the oil and gas
emissions sector in particular,
53% based
on State analysis. The
last State analysis that I'm aware
of, of State
missions on from
the gas sector. So this is an
area where we can make significant
progress. Now with
methane and ozone, methane and
ozone are co pollutants, which
means that you're able to regulate
and reduce ozone, you're
able to regulate and reduce
methane and vice versa. It's
coming out and save pieces
of equipment. So these are really
rules to drive emissions
reductions overall.
Now, methane is a
pollutant that when it's in the atmosphere
has a residency time of
around a dozen years or
so. So the more that we
can reduce methane, the
more that we can get ahead of the
curve of the
climate crisis and the more we can
mitigate the harm caused
by climate change in
particular irrigated New
Mexico, that also, of
course has those incidental
benefits of protecting
public health. A lot of discussion
about that this morning, I
know there's basically direct
causation between the
emissions from the oil and gas
sector and public health
impacts a study by
H energy.
For example, looked at
oil and gas or looked at
ozone emission problems
down and
90% of those emissions
were from the oil and gas
sector. So I know there was some
discussion about maybe there
are other sources of what's causing
some of these problems.
We know it's coming from the oil and
gas sector. There is an opportunity
to reduce that and that's
correlated with specifically
ethane emissions. And those
ethane emissions are coming
directly from oil
and gas. They're not coming from
other sectors. They are coming from
landfills, they're not coming from
ranching, they're not coming from
automobiles.
The other component here that I
want to emphasize is
the State of New Mexico has put in place
these rules, we have legal obligations
to protect quality and
public health State has put in
place these rules, we should see
it through. We made a Hemet, if you look
at Mexico, those who promise
to protect public health, they
also protect bottom line revenue.
That of course is a primary reading
of natural gas capture
methane, put more product in the
pipeline. That seems to be something
that the legislature is interested
in. So I would encourage following
through on those promises and
those commitments
in terms of some board looking
recommendations that we have.
These are five of them.
I'll run through them very quickly.
First of all is I would listen to
the environment and to
the energy Minerals, natural Resources
Department when they come to you
asking for additional
resources for implementation
and enforcement. I'm very
cognizant, for example,
the Environment Department brought
in $30
million in fines
last year at new
taxpayer expense.
Essentially that is well over the
$25
billion budget
for the Environment Department.
So this is something that has
really excellent payback
for the State itself
as well as ensuring that
there is adequate
and enforcement
and the regulates
around 55,000 or
so. It footies and has
roughly
May correct me on this, about a
dozen, less than a dozen,
I think half a dozen folks
who are actually ensuring that
kind of compliance. So it
seems to me that if we're going to rely
on oil and gas production in the
State, we need to
boost our capacity to ensure
we follow through on the commitments
that we have made to
the public. The other
component that I was mentioning,
I won't talk about it too much
was talking about. It is
taking a look at
quantity effectiveness of
these tools to see where there are gas
opportunities to strengthen
the mission we have on State
to reduce both ozone
precursors and as
well as methane
pollution. And with an
eye towards determining
what additional resources do we in
fact need, we know we need more
resources. How much let's
take a look at what that would actually
be and then also to
align it with
federal EPA methane requirements.
As MS Viano said, there
are a couple areas where I think we
could square up where the State
is at relative to where
the EPA is at with
its rules under the Clean Air
Act, particular with
zero Matic devices
and then also improving
detection and repair
requirements
that is particularly
important relative
to home, schools and businesses
that are proximity to oil
and gas. The ozone rules
have a provision in them
for heightened the
detection and repair within
1000 ft of
occupied residences. So
that is something that is getting at
that issue of impacts
to schools. And so if this legislative
body does not mov'e forward with
something like setbacks. One
thing it can do is make sure that
we're improving our
detection systems.
We can do that by aligning
with
federal.
The other component I want to touch on
is specific to the energy
Minerals and Natural Resources
Department. Right now, there is
a $200,000
cap on administrative
civil penalties that
Mr.
Secretary don't get
back. I think that's
ridiculous. I think
that,
but it's
frankly it served because it
gives an incentive for
somebody who is
violating the
methane waste rules.
Once they reach that path
to simply continue to
that path to make the
problem even worse. We
would strongly encourage
lifting that
$200,000 in
penalties. We would
also encourage
raising the daily
penalty amount of what it is
now at all
level
$2500
excuse me and raising that
to the level of the Water Quality
Act and your Quality Act, which
is $15,000 per day.
Those are two simple things
that this body can do to
improve accountability in
the oil and gas
sector. The fourth
thing that we can do is
codifying methane
reductions, not just as a
function of the Air Quality Act and
the Real Gas Act, but
as a function of
a
consideration potentially
in the coming Session on
this front, I would make sure to
include,
I think it is an imperative
to include the oil and gas
sector in those decarbonization
plans and to sink those
decarbonization plans to
energy transition plans to make
sure that we're not leaving communities
behind that are currently
dependent on oil
and gas production for their local
economies. The last
thing I'll mention is boosting
accessibility and transparency
of data.
The Environment Department has done a
good job with its enforcement
dashboard on this front, we would
encourage at
the energy Minerals and natural
Resources Department to
do the same something similar
to make it easier to go through
and identify what we're
doing in terms of progress
with compliance
with the Beane
Ways and rules. I was
looking around on the
website today. It
is
opaque to say the least.
So we would encourage improved
accessibility and transparency
of commissions data. And I
think that goes to,
to benefit to the Energy
Generals and Natural resources deployment
because it shows that the agency
is following term
commitments, confidence
in these methane rules. I think that
inures to the benefit of
all of us with that. I
I
think
>> thank you.
I appreciate that
presentation. I appreciate
um we losing
people. Uh The
question
for >> are on your
>> slides >> on
our, I believe
they are published on the website and
I'm having to provide and
if you want to reach out to me, I can
find my email
that's a
SG at Western
long.org and then I
can provide additional
substantiation on every one of
these.
I think it's like to be very
thank you.
Uh Forgiving, Mr.
Jared Representative
Quality.
>> Sorry
>> Mr. Chairman, >> thank you for your
presentation.
Um Secretary
Kitty in our last LSC meeting
said that the methane was
like, why they or
fire fire drug
they're gonna have fix what's
wrong and they're seeking
terabytes and getting terabytes of
information from satellites, so
we'll not be able to find them.
He also said there were
387
super
already that they found. So
there's a lot out there that's
not, there's a lot of bad
answers. I like it when you guys see bad
actors but to make it sound like
it's just a few sound like
there's a lot of but
um I just remember Secretary
talking about this and so
hopefully we can get this done
and hopefully you're gonna ask for enough money
to be a see, get this done
at the way we need to.
Um as far as
the 15,000.
Um think that
is that.
No,
>> remember when he spoke on
her
>> Mr. Representative
15,000,
Mr. Chair representative, I believe
you're asking about
raising
aols in $2500
a day, the civil
penalty up to
50,000 again, you know, if
you are all of
them that >> again, thank
you.
Is that doable through your agency?
Would that be >> doable? That would
require Mr. Chair representative?
I believe that require a statutory
change. Those are numbers that are set in
the
past.
So um
we had a bill last year
House 33 that had
a list of
forms
uh
steps in the right
direction. Um
I, I greatly appreciate
it when we have
uh presentations
that have specific
recommendations such
as the line.
Um
My understanding is there's not to be
a similar reform bill
to. So, are any
of these
22,
our panelists are not legislative
panelists. Do any of you
have any knowledge of any of
these recommendations
being pursued uh
in
Legislation
>> for the New Mexico
Environment Department,
we already have the Air
Quality Control Act
for uh
and the Clean Air Act
and the EPA
requirement that
we implement our method, a
rule at the State
level. And so we
do not need for
our action,
a piece of Legislation
that goes up above and beyond
the.
>> So that's that I
appreciate that.
Um One of my concerns
is authority is one
thing
umit
willingness uh
force of laws and
families. So if we
have a key administration
that doesn't want to exercise
that authority
are and they
simply stopped forcing
that
>> Members of the Committee for
the rule
that we're talking about
today, we will be
submit our State
implementation plan to
the DP A so
that it becomes State
enforceable. And
government
>> Mr. Chair, I
uh on that front, I
think we would agree with uh
Ciano in terms of
the eighties of the war. You know, I think from
a long term perspective, they are
very interested in
reforming the Oil and Gas Act.
It was passed in
1935.
That's had virtually no. And
then it's when you take a look at
the law and
Secretary Shelton May have a different
perspective on this, but when we take
a look at it in terms of
aligning State
oil and gas oversight
for all public interest
values, we don't
see that alignment. We think that there
are a lot of gas in
that law, in particular
in terms of thinking about how
we balance different values.
When you look at the Oil and Gas Act, it's
all about it maximize oil and
gas production. It's not necessarily
about protecting other
values within the
State. Be very
frank. I don't think the legislature
is position right now to
entertain oil and gas
reform. My organization,
Western Environmental Law Center has
mov'e forward with
oil and gas reform for a
couple of sessions. We
helped author a bill two
seconds ago and, and we
work with the
energy mine staff and resource
department last year on a bill,
those efforts of course failed.
And we just frankly, again,
this the conversation today,
we think it will be
difficult to that kind
of bills. We are looking to the future
for that effort in terms of building
momentum and alignment
or dative industry,
other opportunity that are
more tactical in nature.
So thinking about things like
lifting the civil penalties
cap within
the oil and gas P
of ideally
with setback, I think that frankly
have some challenges on this. And
then also looking at existing
statutory in order to see what we can
do at an administrative
level of things, for example, on
office
discussed. So I
think we're looking at it at a micro
level at this point and then
longer term, looking at a more
comprehensive reform.
I do know that one conversation
that is underway right now is
relative to climate
action and DeCarlo.
So that is the area where hopefully
there will be focus
in.
>> Ok,
>> thank
you.
>> Can you on
the
>> Mr. Chair representative with
Mulan, I am not aware of what
the any Legislation
looks like. I just know that there
were complications but the
way to look at the prospect
of some kind of
decarbonization
bill, I know that there were
prior bills introduced in
other earlier sections.
And so we look at essentially
looking at current
greenhouse gas reduction
commitments here in the State that the
Governor has put in
place by virtue of
Executive work 2019
that 003
as well as the commitments she
has made by, you know,
participated in the
US Climate Alliance.
Um Those are of course Executive
discretionary elections
and something to look at. How do we codify
that and how do we bring it to
ground here in New Mexico relatives
to our specific dynamics
here in the State? And one thing
I would encourage on this from that we
think a lot about
and encourage about with the Energy
Transition Act is seeking,
how do we decarbonize and at
the same time, a
forward with our energy
transition. So making
sure theon organization is
aligned with activities of,
for example, the
task force and its
advisory council. So really
looking at energy transition
and looking at decarbonization is
going hand and again,
>> thank you. I appreciate that. And
so along those lines, you said her
things today or,
and maybe throughout the
um inter
comedian
time that you're
listening and therefore you have
uh doubts about
participation or other types of
Legislation. Can you elaborate on
that?
>> Yeah, so I would look
back, Mr. Chair
representative,
we would look back to HB
133 which was last
Session. This was a
bill that was work
authored by the Energy
Minerals Natural Resources
Department. It was
introduced into the legislature.
It moved up to the house floor
and it died on the house floor.
Never received a vote
on the house floor
as that bill moved through
Committee. It was also watered
down. It got to the point that
we were pondering whether or
not it's in fact supported,
we continue to support
that. We were
extremely disappointed that the
bill was not given a vote
in the House and to mov'e
forward and
given how watered down the
bill was and how it
was frankly very labor
intensive oil
and gas bill in
New Mexico. Because we are so
dependent on oil and gas
production, that frankly sucks
the oxygen from
the conversation. It makes it
difficult to reconcile and
balance different
values. I think that
the, the amount of revenue
that we get from the State sort
of, I very candid
clouds judgments in terms of
our ability to align
oil and gas oversight
with the public interest. And
so as we look at the common 60
days, we did not think that it would
be more the resources
to invested in other oil and
gas.
>> Now,
thank you for being Can. Thank
you for that information.
My last question, the
great modernization as we're
talking about the T
A, they,
that was a type
of
or
you run into seven of the same
follow. It was
one they feel like there was two
years ago.
So
>> Mr. Chair representative. I
I don't, I am not a good
expert. So I want to be
cautious here. I'm well
aware that we do need to modernize
apart when it is
transmission capacity, especially
to bring renewals
online as fast as
possible. We need to do
that as effectively
as we can in particular,
the
values to make sure that you have the community
by it. One of the things
I think that is really pro with
transmission and I know we're running
with, for example, the
Del Rio transmission
line going to Los
Alamos National Labs.
If we do not bring communities
into the energy transition and
the organization efforts,
I think it will backfire
a lot of our ability to climate
goal, but also energy transition
goals and local economic
goals and
broader.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just have a
concern with the timeline of what we're
trying to get this accomplished and we're
gonna give up on like
I had a Session on the
I should thank you, but I
apologize. But
uh if you don't have a strong
focus then,
uh,
we're gonna have a harder time.
We think it was
>> just
>> thank you, uh Rosan
and,
and, uh, at this
time I would like to plug,
um, if you have a
bill,
um, in this
area, we want to hear
it in November. So we're
starting a list of bills to hear
it. Remember that
would include the things
from uh,
NMED relating
to the second
decision. Uh If
there's a, I believe
that May be working
on employment
bill. Um,
we have, uh, you
know, house
133 was a penal process
last year as it arrived
in the legislature and dealt with
all the way.
Um, prior
to that, we have a long
history of
really complicated bills
showing up at the Session a
week or two late and
not being ready for prime time.
So this is our chance
to review a
bill and give it a
betting before the Session
starts. Uh, that
will be the November.
Ok. Thank you all miss be,
I appreciate it.
We have one more pan
today and
the
pan could come
up and they will
appreciate
it.
>> Yes,
>> just
so our last panel of the
day and we're a full hour
late. I apologize.
Um, you
know,
if you think about it, we started
an hour over an hour late because
of problems.
Um, we sort of
time has kept
that,
that's the thing.
Um, our next
panel is the
carbon caption. It's
administration caping
force pays Uh
So this is
uh just sort of the catch
all panel.
Um
What are we doing with the
carbon? And do
we have, are there actual
alternatives
of to transition
and ways of pho,
so we generally go
into the
agenda, we have more
threes and
that's the third.
So first even start with
that
>> and
>> the microphones, you really gonna have
to like rry your
face.
>> All right. Is that
better?
Thank you. Uh I'm Robert
Walsch and Mar and
I and I put together presentations
that she'll be available on the
slides.
>> We have it and, and for
the public, it said that sooner.
But all these presentations
are also on the website
and then LS Under the Water
and Natural Resources
Committee.
>> Thank you, Chair with me.
I'm Aronin Walsh. I'm the
director of the Deployment
Research Center at I stepped
that in my work with
the C so
she worked one day for
50 years
and
with me is Marvin
from, and
he is help her as well
as a director and
assist
the
I slide there. And
I put on there on a
particular
in a very
hard
upper right corner
of the picture.
It's a little tiny building on
the white room
that is uh housing
2 Co2 store
as well. So I'm putting
C two into direct storage
right the day.
Yes. All
right.
So I think
it's really in order to start with,
why,
why wouldn't we manage that in within
our potassium storage and
then particular
director,
there's a lot of job which is
a as it doesn't
matter that you talk to, you're
a credible
data organization.
You realize that
this is not always as
like it,
this includes the just
reading an article by
them today. They
say it 2050 the energy
mix should be
the mix of
the
and decarbonize
the energy.
And the director
caption has
component
being
the four main reasons why there are
challenges is
energy demand versus why
we have a 3%
growth in energy
that every year in the
next three
years,
there's also critical be
materials,
strategic me
and then geopolitics.
And there are other categories
when you start to consider
cal
that is uh future
unmitigated emissions
by uh
that will be more. And
then the other moment
is legacy
and missions. We're
talking about the 1
billion
gonna be put into the
atmosphere, turning
out of
things.
This is what the the global energy
nexus gonna look like
or look like in
2015.
This was from the
US Energy Information
Administration
that the solar data from
IEAIEAVK
ours.
What you see is that coal is
relatively black
to see an increase of natural gas,
any increase the growing
liquids and the
biggest or most
rapidly growing area it's
remove out
and this is great. You
actually see 45%
more global power when it gives
you the thing,
challenges that 3%
growth put together 20%
with big waste of energy demand
ands time.
And
we will,
the rule was basically
claiming unan
and not replacing
old man.
Second category isre
building materials.
We're doing a lot of work right
now, producing emissions
from resources.
These are things like cony and
steel and
glass,
those are difficult to replace
and they are all current movements.
We have an example therere the
the time I
won't read through it but
a significant amount of
iron and concrete
cover
and
uh
was resident, you know,
from
natural mill
still even a single
win.
Likely we need
to mitigate emissions
from concrete
steel glass,
things like that
from, that's
the next step.
That's a longer term role
in the energy
transition.
The other thing is strategic
minerals. Uh
These things are things
that go up and down and the
bad. If
you look at the sort of
materials that we need more
renewable power
battery systems,
electric cars,
these are all things that have gone
out two X three X
the last
six or seven years.
This is just because there's no
plan to
electrify all 3
million games. They expect
to be on the planet
2050. But tell
you all up and down.
Ju right
now doesn't mean we're not
gonna
more.
But currently the mining that
any of the range about
1%
of
the
and we also coming
from uh
me
OED extends from
organizations
involved in
those countries are primarily
in North
America
or so,
when you go to the global South,
South Asia,
Africa and South
America, those
are places that are not, you
know, that's where a
lot of our materials came
in.
So I said GM politics played a
large role.
If you look at the left hand side
there, you can see
that. Oh, we see that you do a
much better job
by reducing their
use of fighter's articles over the next
30 years.
Uh
they
a reducing pull. I
have
increasing natural
abi taking
ligaments
uh about the same
and drawing notes.
If you look at the rest of the
world
they're growing and everything at a much
more rad range is
their own place and
coming next
30 years.
So they're going up and go and
gas throw like this
and
the challenge for decarbonization
and why I'm directing and
capturing comes
report is that the
OECD countries that are actively
decarbonizing their
energy represent
a third of the emissions
or the rest of the world
represents
anism we
need to do with Taler that
to get
clear.
Finally, uh her back
is for to think about legacy
and missions. Uh
This slide shows
uh nearly one trillion
tons of scans that have
been admitted by
developed countries in the
world over the last
1007
digital revolution in England.
At the top of that list is the
US around
425
million tons in emissions.
China is right below that.
China will pass us in the next
decade and
then it goes into.
So CO2 stays in the
atmosphere for 990
years. And on
an average basis,
that means you need to
consider ways
directly
on from the
atmosphere if you want to
be.
So how do we effectively
reduce uh
how ofir
wrong?
The biggest problem is that of carbon
energy everywhere is based
and then it's cheap, it's
what people can afford to develop
their economies.
That's what we do to develop
ours.
But right now coal fire
power is about 30% of
initiative worldwide natural
Gas. 22%.
It over
5%
at 8%. Still
at 9% in class at
about 2.5.
These are things that are very
large in place.
What will the next 2025
pas that
means you need to mitigate
or store those emissions.
That's why I'm dedicated the last
15 years, my great
departments.
We also uh
if you listen to the media, if
you listen to
Ieaghg,
they'll tell you they need to be sting
right now, about six days, maybe
tons of skins
here. And then another
several
of taking tos of pre
air from
director
caption.
All. So
one of the things we know in metech
is that we intensively
study these technologies
right now, I'm the principal investigator
on the carbon neuralation Histo
partnership up in the Western
West. That's
the blue bar. Let him out
there. He was a
department of created
four regional
initiatives to
capture the last
20 years of research and
turn them into commercial
projects
in our particular religions.
So in the in the
region, we have 14
states, relatives
research groups. We have
six national labs that are
participating
participants, many
universities,
geologic surveys
and
representing
if you look at the range,
you can see the
circles, those
are point sources
that range
is
we have the lines
which are significant transport
pipelines.
We actually uh one of the
most connected regions of
the country. We have
around
2000
miles of
pipelines available to
us. And then the
squares would have played in the squares to
get to. It was actually a
store
and most of those herm
invasive of the staff
and most of those
are are
in IUT
those are wells and use
injection or oil and
gas, things
like recovery, but
also need more disposal of
waste like
H two S
acid gas
disclosure.
This shows uh
39 projects
that the
Department organization storage partnership
is involved in the Western
US and
see that they are the broad
ranging in these types
of broad lines.
So what does CCS look
like? So this is
a kind of a surface view
for, you know, the point
sources. You have
things like also our
plan, we have refineries,
cement steel
plants, hydrogen
red
model, then you
have different caption recognitions.
First thing you have to do is isolate
two molecules either
before or after you
burn the
fuel. In the
case of fuel there, the
more you can do
through concentrating
air and blowing it through
the same amount of materials.
Both Mr. Barton
that take out the skills,
reverentially change
the temperature of the an
ski
all and get
isolated, mov'e
them.
So
that also
are also called
carbon
dioxide.
There's an essential part of the
planet or
reducing those at
atmospherics
or I'm telling me that we're about
400 parts of the lane right
now. That's double
what it's fed on
average last 800,000
years. Hard
imagined Sarah and that
the
so that
remove CT from the
atmosphere. There's a lot
of different technologies that are available
to do this
through decades
of a yes,
researching
everything about what the dad is
to say that one of the
source of the
atmosphere arrivals
and they are betting up companies
that are doing this that the
first.
So if you transport pipelines,
I
gustos
say, say that in
uh Mexico, we have
the popular highest
conservation my
life anywhere in the
world.
We also have the George.
This is a, a cross section
of the San Juan Basson
when you're talking about putting
students into storage and
you're putting it into a geology
bul
this is in San about
a mile and a half below the
surface. And
in Birmingham up to three miles
from all the signs
very isolated from
the surface by many
Permal layers.
And the wells themselves
are home
designed
deliberately
to protect things
like redwater. And in
trouble fall.
This is what that looks like
cross section. I know you've
been limit this under
C
currently in the world.
Um
86
deliberately
uh the deliberate
our capture project
behind today
and 19
about
second year. So projects that are
going to develop the US
and also operation
while working out 30 years
still in the
West.
So what was needed for
that? What
what can the in
allege
behavior? Well,
there's already a lot of things that that
happen with steel.
Uh Well, the rest of
the world,
most of the rest of the world uses
fix. So
if you're in Norway, they will
tell you that, you know, with your
co and
gas operation, they charge you
$100 over
time.
So then you, I take the
way to
do
in the US, we have
an economic or
inherent
approach and
reporting back to you, the US
tax code, you get
a tax credit for putting your students
in your storage
benefit of this is that
you can pay for
significant
infrastructure.
Look at
uh the
knowledgeable our,
we were trying to say that like running
carbon captions on
it, you would
need to capture 10
million years.
It
that's
$900
million in tax credits
or $9 million
in tax credits for 12
years costing
$3 billion building
carbon capture.
So I have been sended.
This
permitting is a very long process
about 3 to 5 years that
will
as
well. Right now,
the federal
government,
34 states
culture tribes are working
on getting premise three
states already have.
These states have an advantage
on
and new storage projects
occurring within their
region. New
Mexico is one of those states. California
is not colored here, but it is
actually pursuing it,
the thought of the nation,
it's also pursuing
it.
So all
that should be through the summary.
But basically
these are necessary technologies
to find their
goals.
Uh your needs of the
news,
at least at some level, direct
air capture deal with the
legacy mission said
and also deal with the missions that are
gonna come from
outside of the nois defination
for the next 25.
These are billion dollar
innocent
uh and then
uh have an opportunity
for the next
numerous of projects going on in the
State right now, including the
Escalle
Hydrogen. We have federal
storage projects
going on
in the Birmingham and in the San
Basin and
we are working on backs
as well. Places
where director
Pat
finally, uh community
involvement is essential,
a part of this
kind of remedy. We
don't have the of
that we work in, we
have no social license.
So a very large
i of the spread
is uh dealing
with outreach and
making sure that
communities are not taking advantage
of and to get the best advantage
of the stig
thank
you.
So that was
enjoy your presentation.
OK? So next step we have
on Zoom
A the
so
and with
the,
we can't hear you right
now
and then I see you talking, but I
can't hear
you.
>> Can you hear me now?
>> Yes.
>> Uh
rather than spend
time trying to share
my slides, which
I'm trying
to do.
Uh
Actually,
uh let me just
make a few points. You all
have my powerpoint
presentation in front of
you. Uh
In order to be an effective
tool for
decarbonization,
a carbon capture
and facility
must capture all
or almost all
of the CO2
produced by either that
power plant or
industrial facility.
Uh We've
looked and
we've tried to find
actual data on
the roughly 30
carbon capture facilities
that were operating around the
world at the end
in uh
the end of 2022
into
2023.
And we found none that
have come close to
capturing
90 or 95%
of the CO2 they
produce.
Uh the
best
uh is a,
the best performer
as a facility up in
Canada. Project
quest
operated by
shell uh
captured
roughly 80%
of the CO2 it
produced.
And that was if you ignored
the CO2 that was produced
by the carbon capture
facility
itself.
Uh
In addition,
adding retrofitting
a power plant or an
industrial facility for
carbon capture
will increase
significantly.
The amount of water that's
used by that
plant or facility.
Uh Using data
from the US Department
of Energy's Nettle
National Energy Technology
Lab.
Um
You I've calculated
and you can see in my
slides
uh that
adding
carbon capture to
a coal plant, the size
of uh the
four corners plant
would increase the
amount of water it uses
by roughly 40%
40
43%.
Uh adding carbon capture
to a smaller
uh natural gas
plant would increase
the
amount of water used by
that plant roughly
by roughly
50%.
Uh Similarly
adding carbon uh
retrofitting a
plant or
resurrecting a plant
like escalante
to produce hydrogen
for methane
uh
would increase the
amount of water that
the resurrected plant
would use.
Uh And my
last
point
uh is that
adding carbon capture
again to any
industrial
or
power plant
will be very
expensive.
Uh For years, the US
Department of Energy and
proponents of uh
CCS claim
that the cost of
CCS would go down
over time. In
fact, the 45 Q
credits that
the federal government is
giving out for CCS
have been increasing
from roughly $20
per ton in
2008
to now $85
per metric ton.
In the current uh
45 Q
regulations.
Uh proponents of
CCS are
now
well being led by Exxon,
among others are
now advocating to
increase that to $100
per ton. Uh
studies
by
PRO
CCS groups
suggest that, that
even that level will not
of subsidy will
not be enough.
So it's gonna be a very
expensive
alternative,
uh
expensive,
more water
usage and
not proven to
capture the amounts
of CO two that are
needed.
That's a legacy
of CCS
and that's the future
of relying on
it. Uh
in terms of direct air
capture.
Uh I
prefer
relying on the old saying
that when you're in a hole,
stop digging
first.
Uh And
that means we need to
get off the fix
of fossil
fuels.
Uh Maybe
somewhere down the road,
we will need direct air
capture. I expect
we might need some.
Uh But first, we
should try to replace
facilities
that
produce co
two with
facilities that
don't
just look at Texas
and you can see
wind
and
a solar
and battery storage
installations have increased
dramatically
and are expected to
continue to increase
in coming years.
Uh Happy to answer
any questions you might have
and I apologize for not
starting by Mr. Chairman
and Members of the Commi
Committee. Thank you
for inviting me to speak this
evening.
Thank you very much. >> Uh Next
up >> Morgan
Ogrady,
Mr. Chair and Members of the
Committee, thank you so
much for having me here to speak
today. Uh My
name is Morgan o'grady and I'm a
staff attorney with the Western
Environmental Law Center
I'm based in.
So I'd like to
follow up on Mr.
Schlissel presentation
outline some of the
technical uh
questions and risks
associated with carbon capture
and storage to talk
about uh
some of the risks
to New Mexican
taxpayers, landowners
and community
Members.
First. Um I'd
like to talk about pipeline
ruptures and I would like
to say that there are
numerous risks
asso associated with
carbon capture and storage.
I'm just going to speak
about a couple of them
today.
So to tell you a story
about pipeline ruptures
in early 2020.
A CO2 2 pipeline
ruptured in Sitara,
Mississippi
and uh
significant quantities of
Co2 leaked out in the
community. Carbon
dioxide is heavier than
air. And because of that,
it sinks into low
lying uh low
lying parts of the
land
combustion engines
cannot work when they don't have
sufficient oxygen.
So community Members
in Sitara were unable
to escape by car
CO2 is also an
asphyxia. So
prolonged exposure can result
in death. In this
incident, over 300
people were evacuated
and over 45 people
were hospitalized.
Luckily no one
died.
An increase
in carbon capture and
sequestration activities
will result in a
significant increase
in carbon
dioxide
infrastructure.
Next, I mov'e on to
uh storage leaks.
So this excerpt
which you can read um
later or now
speaks to what happens
when carbon dioxide
comes into contact with
water. Uh the
acidity causes
heavy metals to leach out
into water. So if
you're talking about groundwater
resources that
can result in significant
contamination
that would result in significant
clean up
costs.
So, on the subject of
storage leaks, I'll tell another
story. This
September, the public
learned about a we at
the Archer Daniels, Midland
Daniels Midland
Sequestration facility
in Illinois. This
is one of the or this
is the first plastics
permitted injection
site.
Liquid C two
migrated from the injection
formation to the
formation lying
above it
and corrosion
was found on one of the monitoring
wells. This
demonstrates the risks that
exist even when a project
is designed to meet epa
stringent
criteria.
Finally, I'll talk about
climate and financial
risks. So carbon
capture and
sequestration,
implicates emergence
and remedial response
costs because we don't
know yet what the
costs of
um
damages associated with
carbon dioxide
least or other
issues could be.
We May not have
sufficient emergency and
remedial response
costs allocated
to projects that are permitted
moving forward
and uh
that puts the burden on
new Mexican communities.
Should the emergency
and remedial response costs
be insufficient.
Similarly,
we have financial
insurance for closure,
monitoring and long term
care of of
carbon dioxide
injection sites.
And as we know in New Mexico
from the oil and gas context,
sometimes financial insurances
are not sufficient
to cover those cleaning costs.
So this is another financial
risk to New
Mexican taxpayers.
And finally, we have false claims
and climate benefits
because not
um because a very
small amount of
leakage to surface
which can happen.
Um Yeah, a
number of
mechanisms such
as when I
CO2 comes
into contact with an unplugged
or poorly plugged
oil and gas valve because
we have leakage mechanisms.
It doesn't take that much.
We co2 to cancel
out and benefits from the
storage when compared
to a renewables
fill out.
So with this, I'm going to
briefly mov'e on to discuss
for liability
which came up in the last
legislative Session
and provide a
few policy
recommendations.
So first with
more space.
Uh Case law
indicates that
poor space rights
are most likely
associated with the service
rights holder in New
Mexico. But
Legislation would provide
familiarity on this subject.
We advocate
for um for
the sever
severability of
more space rights from
service rights
because that connection
helps to protect New
Mexican communities who are
sitting on top of these
objection sites.
Unit is a
scheme by
which uh
smaller units
can be merged into
larger units.
I mean simplifying. But this
is the concept that um
you May know from the oil and gas
context and
in the extraction
context, uh when
you're extracting minerals like
oil and gas, this helps
uh protect the finance
interests of
mineral rice holders within
that pool that's being
considered. In
contrast, when we look at
injection activities, you're
talking about health and safety
risks in terms
of leaks to
groundwater, to soil,
which can impact crops
and to uh
surface which can
impact human health and safety
as well as climate
benefits. Um Any
climate benefits associated
with farming capture and
storage. So
unit can be done
in two ways.
Uh It can be
done voluntarily
where Members
rightsholder within
people can consent
to join or it can be
done in a compelled
fashion. Uh
where Members can be
compelled to join in
the unit of the
pool. Generally
in compulsory unit
gains, a certain
threshold of
um consenting
rights holders is
required before
the remaining rights
holders can be
compelled to join into
that pool.
And we would here
for a
um for
a voluntary
system because
the rights here are heightened
as not financial interest,
it's health and safety.
But in the event of compulsory
unit is
established, we would
advocate for a
very high threshold
before the remaining rights
holders are forced to
learn in this risk.
Finally,
uh liability
transfer of liability to the
State. As you can
see in the graphic on this
slide, other states
have established
schemes by which
liability eventually
passes from a
project developer
to the State and therefore
the taxpayer as
well, not
one State. Um At
least one State has
explicitly provided
any Legislation that that risk
will never transfer
to the
public, the
State. And we would
advocate as well for
reducing a transfer
of liability or
the risks associated with
carbon storage to the
State.
In conclusion, I
have uh we have
five policy recommendations.
The first is to reg carbon
capturing sequestration as a
climate solution because of
the risks that exist.
The second is to
grow ahead in the severability
of surface State
and four space
because of the risks to
groundwater,
soil and the
atmosphere.
The third is to establish
a high threshold for compulsory
unit
if a compulsory
of taxations is
adopted in the first
place. The fourth
is to reject the transfer
of liability to the State.
And the third is to create a
trust fund for monitoring
and compensation for harms
associated with
our collection and storage.
Thank you so
much.
>> Thank you for that uh Members
of the Committee, Representative
Sara.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you for your presentation.
It's a lot of things I know
about. Um I've been on
the Energy Committee for eight years,
this guy and, and
this is one topic, I could
never find
enough evidence that it
works. I would
read articles that said, you know, it
injected too well and it would come out
somewhere else to cause devastation
or just, I
just couldn't find anything that really
made me feel like this
is something we can
do. And I, to Mexico,
I believe, highly knew
I just couldn't
like with all the scientists,
I've talked to different people. I
just haven't found someone who
can convince, convince me this,
that this work. So this was
kind of kind of scary.
Um And I just had to
by on
our, it doesn't
extremely stay in the ground when we
inject it and does it
cause seismic activity?
Because those are things
well, seismic
activity.
Um I just want to know
because there's so many articles
that say it doesn't stay in the ground that
it's not. And with the
transfer in it,
our, that's kind
of scary of what you thought of
and the water use
that's I don't have water
to use for. So, but we
need something so anyone
who could tell me they will stay on the ground
forever, convince me
like
you,
>> Mr. Jared looks.
So,
I mean, nobody can guarantee
forever
that
nobody can guarantee forever
forever. But when you're living more is
at least 990
years because
that's, that's how long you wanna
isolate the ski moles
from the atmosphere. It won't make a
difference.
The uh when you put
CO2
into a variety
formation in the
subsurface, most of them are salting
water.
Roughly a third of it
within about a year or so
becomes absorbed
within that water. Basically, it
becomes pers
Perin water that makes
it lessen a lot
over the next uh
decades
to uh hundreds of
years. Another third or
so that the two will turn into
new ones.
And because of those
two factors
and because there's limited
access to the service, very
little of the and can actually
escape. And I wanted
to imagine as an
example of that,
am uh the
report there showed that about
307 tons of
C were released,
6 million tons
of C together
stored.
That's less than one in
5004%
of the C to lead.
And to me, that's a
win.
You kept nearly
6 million dozens skins even going
into the
atmosphere,
>> Chair and Members of the Committee. I
May that thank
you. Um First
with regards to AD
M that's a fair
point. But I would also say
that AD M is in its
first few years,
I believe of operation.
So if you consider that low
levels of leakage
um coupled
with leakage that
May occur in the remaining
year of that
injection project. And
beyond, you could quickly
get to that 1
1% leakage
rate at which point
it will have become more
effective to have built out
renewables. Instead.
Um The other point I would
make is that
when um you can
inject carbon dioxide
into a
couple different pieces, you
can inject it into
a manhood oil and
gas reservoirs.
Um But you can also inject
it into brine and saving
formations as we
discussed. But
one of the issues that
we're starting to see there
is that when you have
brine
um in these,
in these formations, it's
already full. I
simplifying. Um but
it is essentially already full
and so the best
force of a week to pull out some
of the brine and before you
inject carbon dioxide to
deal with the pressure issues.
Uh But my understanding
is that not all of the projects
are doing this because of
that. Um
We, we
don't know enough about
how these
prime saline
formations will receive
the carbon dioxide that's being
injected. And Mr.
Schlissel might be able to add on
to that, I believe.
>> Excuse me.
Uh
Yeah, I excuse
me, I would
comment
that the uh
two carbon
capture storage
facilities that are held up
as examples for the
entire world
are in uh
Norway.
Uh One of them is
Sleipner, the other is
snow white.
Uh not spelled that
way, but that's the way I believe
it's pronounced in
Norwegian
uh
Norway. Uh And
the developers of these
projects
spent a huge amount
of money used all
of the advanced techniques
to characterize the
sites to
see whether there would be
any
uh movement
of the CO2
that was going to
be uh stored
under the North
Sea.
And what has happened
is that contrary
to their expectations,
pretty much all expectations
is that the CO2
has gone places
where it was not expected
to mov'e. Yes,
there's not been,
fortunately, there's not been
any leakage to the surface
yet, but it's
a warning
about relying on
promises about
the security
of deep
storage of
CO2,
especially when
we're talking about needing
to store it
permanently.
Uh
Thank
you,
>> Mr.
Chair.
I'm glad you mentioned
uh sufferer because
it wasn't on your graph that
showed uh
percentages of
projects
C A two that was sort of projects.
I think that's a very close to
100%. It's been
operating for 13 years about
a million to per year.
You also don't even look any further
than the oil and gas industry
even in New Mexico or
long term
evidence of source
here and doing
a recovery since the 19
seventies without a major
incident. Also
over the last 15 to 20
years of new
acid gas disposal,
which is a combination of a two
acids, you know,
quite effectively without
any, any uh
leaks clubs either.
So the pregnant thing is
actually a real
issue when, when you
put fluids into
the subur this
comes back. I the question,
I'm sorry,
the formations that are
primarily used
for storage
are typically under
pressure, which means you
don't need to put
to, to more fluids from
them. Uh At
least not for a very long
period of time. It takes
a long time for them to fresh with
a point where they become of
a concern. Now,
they said that we dispose
of water and
well, and we do these seism
and we from that,
I would say of a million times a
year. See it too well
is about uh
25%
of the volume of a
large
watering vendor
that the fluids that you're putting into
the CO2 well are
compressible, which
means they have less of an or a
pressure impact on the
formation.
You can manage those
risks
when you build a that
program to be able
to give those
tax credits, you need to
demonstrate to the
EPA that you
do have a sufficient monitoring
program, you can track
the C two does.
And all of that is actually done
by monitoring rather than
by direct observation
most bar.
So you're doing models
uh that might tell you where
the cot goes.
Uh
Ultimately, you need to be
able to account for where that
the is. If it goes to them, you need
somebody else's space,
you can become responsibility for
that. I think
that the, these are all questions that
are not in my mind
that it's not a technical
issue. It's really an
issue of
whether you
think
renewables
hydrocarbons the next
25 years. I
don't believe that it's
true that I still
want to do something
about climate
change. That means you're
allowed dealing
with legacy
and missions. You left
dealing with
continuing high carbon emissions,
not necessarily from
us, but people in the
world that to me,
the bigger risk is to do
nothing.
Yes,
we're gonna mov'e on
our >> Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
Thank you for the presentation. This
is an Aing conversation
we've had over the last two years
now, three years
maybe. And I appreciate
how the conversation
is expanding, how we
are getting more
and more information, particularly
from New Mexico tch
I've attended uh
about two or three
of the presentations from
uh from that,
but I also really enjoyed the,
the information and
the recommendations
from
Southwest.
Um
Thank you. Thank you. I kidding.
My name is uh I have too much
information in front of me right now. I appreciate
your recommendations. Um
I just want to one our education
here to point the rep on the
fund. What was the
point
>> Mr. Chair Members of the
Committee? My
fifth point was that
it would be
beneficial to have a trust
fund established,
to provide for
um monitoring and
compensation for
harm.
>> I I really like that,
that goes to like an emergency
fund that we're looking at other types
of emergency,
um,
um, issues were gonna
have with the State discuss
throughout the day Chair. I'll get
into that. I
would, you know,
one of the, one of the things
I, I think you just covered here
in New Mexico. We, we've been,
uh,
sequestering carbon
for,
for over 40 years. Is that correct,
Mr. Cha,
>> uh, more than 15
years and that recovery
and going on 20 years
for
>> sure. And in those
locations, they how
are they
can,
what is the Mogra technology
work using there, Mr.
Chair
>> Chair for under
the
um they're
very good operating programs.
So in the case
of
of
gas, which is the closest thing
to glass six, which is really what we're
talking about pure storage is
two.
Uh you
already have on the surface
a system to
monitor for H two S
leakage because that's
a much greater health
concern CN 10.
So that is incorporated
into your monitoring program.
Typically, you'll have a
service
seismometers. You May have
more seismometers. This is
the monitor monitor
for
unexpected
induced seismicity
for, for a localized restaurant
lapse. You also
monitor the groundwater in a
large area around the
site. Typically
you'll, you'll get as many as
15 or 20 wells
in the area and you
continuously monitor
the the water chemistry range
changes that can be related
to any release
of gas. You can
also put in very sensitive
tracers
into the gas as
you injected periodically
and then have measuring devices
that can measure these things that
parts per trit or
parts
per,
along with that you can
do petters
which basically measure
representation
surface. You
do uh annual
testing of the not
an within
every three years. In New Mexico,
everything is required.
Testing of the
Integrity in the
wild.
You do that by checking
the fluid
that is in the diar space
of the well, you have a
well hole goes into
the ground in case of
a plastic well or glass
two well for
disposal
and protect
groundwater.
You have cement
steel, cement,
steel, semen
steel,
then you have a fluid
which is filled with biocides
and corrosion inhibitors.
And then inside of that
space, annual space,
you have an injection
straw
stainless steel too
which then delivers the skin to
death. So
all of these programs are a little
different for every site.
But epa
we take the information that you
have the other information
that's going on around you like
teet for
the New Mexico Network that's been
developed. Those
can be incorporated into your
program and the
program by the way has to be
reviewed whenever you need,
wants to review it.
So you May have to add stuff we change
this.
>> Thank you. That's just thought
there. And here's the cost,
a big heavy cost of
getting
that. My next question
is what if
we do nothing this Session because
we're gonna have
a Legislation
carbon capture.
Um But we do nothing right
now and an
industry or private industry is
already doing
this.
What does that mean for Mexico's
Ch
>> Mr. Jared?
That's a really, really good
question. The answer
is uh things will still
happen, it will be
slower because you have
to wait 3 to 5 years for a federal
partner. The other
thing that I don't like about it, this is the
next
is that we have an opportunity
to Mexico City is going to
plastic prizes right now. They
will be able to administer the
program for
O CD to do that.
They have to demonstrate to Edd A
that their program is at least
as stringent as the
Edas. This
gives us the opportunity
to characterize
or modify
assistant,
that assurances that we believe
are important to the
process. But
the reality is this is
already allowed, people who already
know we
can just make it
easier.
>> Mr. Chair and Members of the
Committee, I just like to make two
quick points. One
is that class two wells
are uh of
a very different scale than a
class six wells. Class two
wells are very old,
spoiled recovery. We've been doing that
for many years. Class six
wells are of a very different
scale. And then
um a second quick point
is that in the wake
of the AM
the EPA revised
its recommendations on
what steel was recommended
for these projects.
Because the steel that had been
used was the steel that EPA
recommended and then that
led to the corrosion
in one of the monitoring
monitoring wells.
So just to emphasize that
we're, we're learning a
lot as we go, even
as yes, class
two wells are very old.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank
you for your responses. And I
think my biggest concern is
that so we can start
happening. This is gonna
continue to have it, Mr.
Chair and
I just want us to be prepared
to how are we as a
legislature going
to maybe
regulate this? Maybe those
are the things I'm looking at or
where we're gonna be looking at
those types of
invelope from, from you this
panel today because that's
really where we're at. So that's
why I,
I would like your recommendations
by points that you made because we need
to look at those things
um from that. So
we can have, this is
gonna continue to have
and the
development of this
technology, you can
touch very much on the
direct air capture because I know
that's a different
entity that's working and all
that. But
where I'm, where I'm coming from,
Mr. Chair is where are we gonna regulate
this or where, what are we gonna do?
Because it
is, it is
happening and we
stopped to be here. Those are
the questions we're,
we know we can't stop it because it's
getting at because
this is private
industry that's already there. We have
to figure out ways
of, of
regulation. We have to figure out
ways of working with everyone needs to
solve them of these problems so that we don't
have
the concerns, the issues
of concern that we are making
deals today. I have concerns
Mr. Chair, I've Adam, I've had
very open discussions
with the, with the Gentleman that are
in front of us today over the
years and I I
will continue to have some of those
conversations. But what's for
us right now, Mr. Chair, what I like to bring
to find is that it's
here. We have, what are we going
to do as legislators
really developing those
regulations?
Thank
you.
>> Send ne
>> thank you. Thank you,
Mr.
Brady. You said that
you would, you would
want 100%
voluntary
participation in the formation
of the unit. But if you
require that there's going
to be very few
units. Four.
Do you agree with that
>> Mr. Chair and Members of the
Committee? Yes, that might
be the case but the
stakes here are very high
where unity
sitting on top of these projects.
Thank you.
>> So, so if
there's a
Committee, basically, if you
have 100%
voluntary unit
requirement,
you will never see
one of these
form unless you
have some unique
circumstances where you
have one or two
owners of
all the robbery that would
be encompassing the
unit, which in
New Mexico would be
uh not very many
places. So
uh that, that
bacteria would
essentially eliminate
this
>> Herrera.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I
I'm just looking at this
graph where 77%
is question of and
Herum Basin, how much of
that is New weeks ago and how much
is
intensive
>> Chairman
representative, I
probably couldn't give you that exact number,
but it's more or
less. Please put me
West Texas.
So that's the,
the storage
I think if you talk about A R
you have to differentiate adversity
storage, the HS
uh as
well. Those are designed
exactly like plus
their modern wells
and all all the
is
so that
number there bothers
me for a reason. It's
1000 the one we supposed
to be so
to work with the worst effects of climate
change. So
anything that this body will
do to
help New Mexico do
this in a sensible responsible
way when we get great
benefit, actually agree
with that
point.
But I think people are closer
on this than what they May
think. And all of a sudden
people get
thank you very helpful. Thank you, Mr.
Chen.
>> Thank you. And I think, and last,
and uh for
the Committee, I want to say
that
um
my perspective is I, I
absolutely believe that we
have,
OK,
the technology and the capacity
to do these things.
Uh But I am extremely
cynical that we can do in
a cost effective manner.
Um
Let's start with the
uh Miror Capcha.
I understand that this is being
done. Um I
think the
conference is Albuquerque,
the CEO
of
OXY and they were using it.
Um
But it seems to me that that's sort
of like it's like
niche hot in
use of CO2.
And if we were going
to do this
at a scale that would
affect atmospheric
levels,
and I mean, that's a completely
different scale. How,
how do you do that
in a cost effective
manner?
>> Uh Mr. Geer,
great question. And
if I May make a few comments
before I answer
that. Uh First
of all, if you say that CCS
is not a client solution,
you'd have to say that, you
know, >> I think my first
question is direct.
OK. I'd like to separate this.
>> So um the
plan that's being talked about
is um is
boxing in
Texas. It's part
of the D hub in
Texas that the, the federal
government has
uh funding.
And so they have two plans, they have
500,000 to
plans and
they plan to expand that
maybe 2 70
80 more of those uh with the
next I know how long they did
that. Um But
that's a project that the
doe is
funding.
Uh And the, the
whole model here is
based on what's called
business development. So
technology readiness
level D
UEFA CN and
Nel are
focusing on the commercialization
of this technology at this point
because over the last three years,
we've got from technology levels
of three or
five where they went from
a bench to maybe in
someone's garage and
now they're trying to make it
large.
So when you hear
some of the information that's being
presented, it's
old data.
That is one of the
difficulties
and the speed in which
this is all taking up is
amazing. So
bring the cost down is
the key, the d the doe
and the government, federal
government is trying to get it down to
like 100 and $3800
a ton, but you have to
scale up to do that.
And one of the big issues
is power, power
is a huge cost of this
in New Mexico. I was
talking to you about the,
the, the people
that land with the national
labs. Geothermal
is really one of the
amazing things in New
Mexico and trying to
figure out where we could
put an exact planet that's
next to a geothermal
source would be
amazing. And the lab
I'm interested in working with us
and developing that.
So, so you
want to bring your energy costs
down and the cost
of doing this down.
Now, I just want to caution
everybody that when you start
talking about how
much is this gonna cost?
Um when you're
looking at climate change
and what's really happening,
this is a sliver
of what has to be done
across the world. This
is not the fantasy, this is
not gonna save anybody.
This is after you
stop a lot of these
problems. This is the
clean up
and the, the discussion that
they had about just stop putting
it out there. If you don't
use CCS, not
that CCS
all these plans, you're
asking the world to turn off the
electricity and you tell
me who's gonna go do that.
All these lights in the
garner.
So when we
have the one, well,
you know, we should just be
lose. I agree,
but you're not gonna do it fast
enough. You're not gonna get
India China and other
countries to turn
off their CO2 tomorrow
using fossil fuels.
>> Ok. So that's gonna lead to
my next question.
Um
If people are emitting
carbon, I,
I don't have a problem. I
stop uh
by capture fine
with that. Um
But I again
skeptical of the character versus
stick. Um
I don't want to subsidize
it and I think if you
provide an economic incentive
to capture carbon, you
provide economic incentive to
produce car.
And I believe that was what
was behind the G
energy um
effort with say
they should, I don't think they
were interested in
um capturing carbon.
I think they were interested in capturing
tax credits.
So why
not use a stick?
>> I think so. If I May,
Senator, I mean,
uh Jerry,
um my wife says
this to me all the time when I start
harping on this, she goes without
regulation. None of this is gonna
happen and, and
I don't disagree with this.
But
um by my
opinion is,
this is one of the most
critical issues that
humans have ever faced. At
this point, we have never
seen a problem like this.
And if we don't solve it in the
next 25 years,
the problem that we're gonna have
is going to be completely
different than what we are talking
about right now. Completely
different when the environment changes
so dramatically that
it's really terrible.
I mean, it much
worse than what we can imagine.
We're gonna wonder why we need to
do this. So I'm,
I'm stuck on. Yes.
Humans like make
profit. People make
a lot of money off of war
facing. Uh,
there's a lot of greed out there.
And if you
use that as a, as a
saying, well, you know, this is not,
people are going to make money off of this. Of course,
they're gonna make money. But the question
becomes, how do we
pay work? And
the federal government is putting them the
tax credit out
there, how
Mexico can make this
useful is speeding
up the process, making sure
it's safe keeping communities
involved and the cost
of this will be companies will
come and then they will
sell carbon dioxide. My
goal is to pre sell
carbon dioxide to 10%
of the wealthiest people generating
50% of the co two in the
world.
>> So, um
I think a lot
of people would argue that we
have
more wars
because people make
profits.
So, you know,
the idea that we
should do this and it's ok that
people make a profit. Like, >> you
know,
>> the amount of money we're talking
and you look at what other
things we do with that
money.
>> All right, just
>> that, that's
for
>> um
scrolling.
Uh which I mean, like
uh the, the
issue for me
is
our ability to, to use
renewables to the lowest
extent in Mexico's
possible. Temple, Wind and
Sun, you can get around
40 to 45% utilization
out of our wind and solar.
But there are times when the wind's not
blowing and the sun's about
China,
you need to be able to B
power of
a legacy power
plan over the
next 20 years
that has carbon capture on.
It basically
performs the role of a gigantic
battery that lets us
thousands ups and down.
And so
to me, it's more of a, of
a power solution
power that is growing, whether we
want it or not. If the US and
Europe got rid of all their carbon
missions. That would be
20%. The very
important.
There's other people in many students
in the world. This is
where, where that comes in.
I can put some numbers on that
cost or that cost
if you like
OXY is
looking at 100 and $80
credit with 49
Q and about
100 and $20
California low car fuel
credit. So they could sell the o they
produce from putting that
sales in every
project. That means they think
they can do it with 300
time
companies. Clean
power companies that I've talked
to in
Arizona, Arizona
Public Utility.
They don't want to put carbon capture
on their gas switching
plants. They
think it's cheaper for them to
pay $1000 a
time for somebody else's tax
credits. There's a
market out there
and, you know, I work for
government. I'm, I'm in research
at the university.
But if you really want something done
in that scale, you have to turn
it over to business. That means you have
to give them the right
tools to be able to do that. That's
the regulatory environment. Maybe it
carrots but we have
sticks,
maybe it's
four
>> we in there. Uh Thank
you all for your presentations. Thank
you for uh
sticking with us through
the end of the day.

Energy Excel,
Energy and
the
price, the generation.
Uh Thank you very much.
Thank you everyone
very much. We,
