The general already on item

Thank you Mr speaker we take you
to that point.
The record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
House Bills sixty eight on final
passage has been taken and it is
now subject to debate amendment
or substitution the gentle lady
to explain the bill.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
house bill sixty eight in our
does is amends the spaceflight
informed consent act to change
our amend the definition of
launch vehicle inspection to and
eliminates the funds that clause
in section four and with that Mr
speaker I'll stand for
questions.
There is the bank
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
payment.
I yield so Mister speaker to the
gentleman from San Juan County.
Thank you Mr speaker I I confess
I couldn't resist the temptation
to ask my fellow freshman a
couple questions are still on
the phone for about twenty make
sure I have learned from this
one so in the film or to say for
example if I were to go
a white water rafting they had
me sign of liability for thank I
knowledge that this activity is
rusty and hi I'm connected to
you and therefore agreement to
waive my liability to the summer
concert Mr speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from us and want to
have to correct you I'm actually
a sophomore as my second
the ninety second term serving I
I I I appreciate the sentiment
nonetheless and Mr speaker and
gentleman it is similar however
other part about for any
reckless Momsen or knowing
behaviors that could jeopardize
someone who is lying and a
commercial commercial space
flight it also has a car about
four any knowing safety
violations or of knowing safety
risk.
Thank you Mr speaker forgive me
gentle lady.
For my job
In the gentle lady explain to me
why there was a from provisions
enacted unusually in this
legislation.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from San Juan although
I wasn't here at the time of the
provision was enacted when
commercialized space and
commercialize the flight was in
its infancy infancy in New
Mexico the state has spent the a
large number resources putting
in the infrastructure needed to
support commercializing
Development New Mexico we are no
longer in the that nation phase
and we are ready to continue on
inform space the informed
consent act in a manner that is
permanent for the state.
Mr speaker
I think this is an exciting
industry I'm excited The New
Mexico develop for front.
I think it's every little kid's
dream to to orbit the earth and.
And to look down on planet earth
I think it's a it's a
fascinating in in very exciting
industry.
and so I appreciate the the
piece of legislation and you
know from attorney up to make
sense to work for consenting
adults we all recognize that
applies spaces inherently risky
and so to the extent that we can
encourage the growth of this
industry I think that we should
do that of the state and I see
this piece of legislation is as
consistent with that growth so
thank you Ginnelly thank you Mr
speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Travis.
Mr.
Mr speaker thank.
Gentlelady yields please.
Thank you very much by reading
this bill it sounds to me like
you're very interested in space
program that is going on and I'm
assuming that this is directed
towards the activities that are
going over there going on over
there.
Of these two years see.
Northwest of Los crucis is that
correct.
Mexico of which this act the
fact.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
thank you very much this is in
case any other company comes
into the state of New Mexico and
launches.
Were so poor but told vehicles
whether hi a lo human is that
correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady that is
correct.
Mr speaker I did have a question
regarding section two of your
bill on page three the
In
wing laws to in two thousand
thirteen chapter one thirty one
six four and the for the benefit
of people as they get there can
you explain to them what this
is.
so section for other people
section four is just the repeal
of the funds that because I
without which are the in form
space quite informed consent act
would expire on July thirty
first of this year.
Okay Mister speaker gentle lady.
Does.
When we're talking about the
company that's already
established here for any others
that may come in can you tell us
about
What's more.
Right.
In this bill to carry enough
insurance to cover.
And I'm not I have never happens
to be able to come for.
From negligence.
Want no willful disregard for
the safety of the of the past.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
I think you asked me to question
so I'll start with the first yes
there is a requirement for on
insurance policy believe it the
million dollar.
It all the more coverage through
at the a certification processes
which required in order to be
able to fly your second question
with regards to
negligence and that the ability
to sue their for so what the
input and forms cannot talk this
morning the space flight
informed in fact consent act
does is it requires
commercialized space passengers
to our consents to the fact that
are going on and commercialized
faceplate is inherently
dangerous and so it is and the
knowledge meant of that fact and
it also allows for car about
for reckless wanton or knowingly
jeopardizing of course I space
flight passenger safety or
ignoring.
Quite a few warnings that of
course could also jeopardize a
commercialized space flight
passenger safety I hope that
helps.
Mr speaker gentle lady
This is going to make this
permanent is that correct and as
the body trying to sit in the
future is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Travis county that is correct.
Generating
Right.
Going to reference based
programming occur spaceport New
Mexico whatever one you want to
call it right now.
How many flights they books so
far over how many payments have
they actually.
Launched so far do you have any
idea.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
from Chavez I can't talk regards
the payloads I do know that
there are over six hundred
participants on a waiting list
at this time waiting to go up on
the first flight are they have
completed a couple of yes why
there are probably better living
and contributing to the New
Mexico and economy right now
down in Los crucis and we very
much look forward to the first
white so that we can get all
those passengers on the wait
list this guy.
Thank you very much for that
response Mr speaker and gentle
lady I know that one of the
first persons and signed up for
it was touring a principal.
And I know that these flights
are pretty expensive and she's
still one of the first
participants.
Mr speaker gentle lady I found
like that and someone I should
know who that is unfortunately I
do not so I can answer your
question.
Both the side of my aim to yes
she was one of the leading stars
in the TV series Dallas.
Mr speaker gentle lady I wasn't
allowed to watch TV in the
child's I guess that was my law.
As much Mr speaker.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for Sanchez and thank you for
putting in a place of my eight.
Gentleman from Bernalillo I
think a number of us take
offense at that since we all
remember her
as mature adults.
All right the gentle animal
there's further debate the
gentleman from Santa.
I yield to the gentle lady from
Santa Fe County Mister speaker
thank you.
I'm just curious.
The.
All of these issues and coming
up with.
There was also some protections
for people that would be on the
ground in that area.
And then that anything occurred
so this will cover.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Santa I have not seen that
within the purview of the
informed consent that that I've
been looking at but that's not
to say it isn't in there I've
just been kind of hyper focused
on the issue at hand so I'm
trying to get an expert on the
phone I don't know where she is
I can you come back to me or I
can review the act really
quickly and I can answer your
question okay.
Mr speaker I just wanted to make
sure.
Is there was immense.
We had fallen from the sky this
is not.
These changes this change would
affect that because if you've
been down to the spaceport noted
there's still people that live
around the area and so in the
event that a.
Well for lack of a better word.
Above those properties that
these folks were still covered
and that was a big concern of
the legislators.
That surrounding areas so I just
want to make sure that that
stated.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
and I'm sorry that your question
that is absolutely correct
people on the ground are are
excluded from the informed
consent and the fact and they
would be able to our hold any
commercialized space
actor accountable for any
damages that they might
encounter as a result of the
spaceflight.
Thank.
There's further debate the
gentleman from the
Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from Bernalillo.
I yield Mister speaker to the
general Domon from.
Right County I'm sorry I missed
that.
Yes Mr speaker gentle lady Lea
County is correct read through
forty one forty three is is is
going to remain in effect.
As a consequence of this
legislation is correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman from a
that is correct.
And.
Speaker gentle lady Mrs turned
to to limit the liability of the
provider's office space travel
and nutrient.
Of this prisoner correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman for me
that is correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady what is
the current you're right of this
equipment.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the this is experimental
equipment it's flying under and
at the experimental
certifications so failure rate
is kind of a moving target at
this point they are very close
to actualize white for regards
virgin galactic but I also want
to remind everybody that this
act actually applies to any
commercialized space for just
space or aerospace developments
or or
you know launch providers so
there are a number of
corporations will benefit from
the fact some of the attendance
at spaceport America some of
them are not Mexico is kind of a
bright house for aerospace
development throughout the
country so you know the failure
rate is is is a hard one to nail
down but the technology but
there these are the best and
brightest in the business and
they're doing everything they
can to keep everybody safe.
Mr speaker gentle lady let me
rephrase the question asked
specifically with respect to
fortune collector what is for
concern right up there space
flight the first.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
Lee so earlier in the process
and but act is going through
their type certification flight
log in twenty fourteen I believe
there was a unfortunately an
incident that occurred in a
crash and lost the pilot light
at at which point they had to
rebuild the aircraft which they
have done and they have taken
all the lessons learned which is
actually requirement through the
national transportation
transportation safety board to
take the lessons learned from
that crash and incorporate them
into their flight plans going
forward so that such incidents
will never occur again.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Okay so you're right to date is
a hundred percent let me read to
you from.
Last three to.
Forty one forty three and three
has true knowledge were
reasonably could have.
Okay dangerous conditions would
you not agree that a hundred
percent sure you're right.
Which certainly imply a
dangerous condition.
Mr speaker and gentleman family
so I I don't believe that your
definition of failure rate is
correct are there have been
several flights infants and so
failure rate is going to be
taken from the number of fights
occurred so one hundred percent
failure rate is not correct and
a dangerous knowledge of it
interesting condition is going
to be subject to the terms and
conditions that the passenger if
I need to the time so if virgin
galactic prince and in the woods
of Tina fey type certification
that's the federal government
stating to you that they believe
that their operations are safe
and they are ready for passenger
flight.
Mr speaker gentle lady how many
passengers will this vehicle
curry almost single mission.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
the I wish my experts are here
to answer that question I don't
believe that the more than ten.
Mr speaker gentle lady at six.
And the question would be
whether to a whole lot of
military insurance.
His per passenger for in
Albuquerque.
Mr speaker and gentleman from we
I do I I can't answer questions
as to the particular insurance
policy in place I don't
represent virgin galactic nor do
I have the the technicalities
are the information on that.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady friends for for
questions there is further
debate the gentle lady from
grant and d'abo and Sierra
Representative down.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you to the gentle lady would you
please feel.
I'm sorry I yield to the gentle
lady from all those counties.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady you know thank you
for is in my County Sierra
County and I am so appreciative
of folks from the northern part
of the state who see the value
in support space for could you
let me know like why are you
passionate advocate of the for
more.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady from all those counties I'm
an advocate because New Mexico
has the opportunity to be first
in the nation for commercialized
space and aerospace development
for counseling talking the
legislature about the importance
of diversification of our
revenue sources and this should
be one first or second on the
left you've already put a large
amount of investment in
infrastructure for aerospace and
all we have to do is adopt the
approach is you know if if if we
tell them they will come and so
we already have you know anchor
tenants at spaceport America to
have million dollar facility
that is already in existence in
New Mexico taking advantage of
the the.
The well the resources we have
in our two national laboratories
and we can support this industry
which will in turn support us by
helping us diversify revenue
bring high paying jobs that will
continue to be in New Mexico be
incurred in New Mexico and will
also help to grow our tourism
economy well.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady and I I
couldn't agree with you more I
think if you you know what
version is a marketing machine
they're known around the world
and they are on the cutting edge
of commercial spaceflight but
they are one of many tenants at
a space for that are going into
first at research and
development very innovative very
forward thinking technologies
that is absolutely honored to
visit and see it's not very
often that you go across New
Mexico you see multiple cranes
heavy equipment bulldozers the
man trust me like that place is
under construction and so it's
very exciting I remember my
freshman year the space industry
with about two hundred and
thirty billion a year and it is
it has exceeded four hundred
billion and the projections are
over five hundred billion and
New Mexico is poised with our
dedicated airspace and unique
opportunities of R. err a lack
of humidity and the other
benefits that we have to keep us
on the map in the front so thank
you I wasn't here for the
infrastructure was developed and
when the two hundred million
dollars in capital expense but
it's there and we should use
that that we should maximize the
and our are you aware that that
the state forty mereka is the
phone zip code.
Mr speaker gentle lady I would
not.
It's pretty cool there's a code
is that the five digit numbers
eight seven six five four their
federal numbers three two one
zero eight seven six five four
three two one zero and I think
it's time for New Mexico to take
flight and for this body have to
rally behind the space industry
and and the positive financial
impact to have statewide thank
you Mr speaker thank you madam.
There is for the debate.
Gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady please yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from curry county.
Thank you Joel and I have had
the opportunity to hear your
bill in the house transportation
committee and I know it went
from there on to House
Judiciary.
But as I begin to look at the F.
I. R. on your bill.
I noticed that it generates
seven million six hundred and
fifty eight thousand dollars FY
twenty one.
A little over eight million in
FY twenty two a little over nine
million in FY twenty three.
It surprised me to see it and
informed consent bill would
generate that kind of money so I
guess my questions are.
Can you explain to me how it
informed consent bill will
generate that kind of revenue.
And
A just like to talk about that
part a little bit.
Thank you Mr speaker Jonathan
curry thank you for the question
actually so what this bill does
is it gives certainty and it
keeps the Mexico competitive
with other states that are
offering then use for
commercialized space.
So what we have that you know we
unfortunately do not have the
only space port in the country
we do happen to have the most
impressive pretty wide but other
states have offered the
opportunity for commercialized
space
providers to to have limited
liability and so what this bill
does is that keeps us
competitive by offering those
those entities are I thank you
for calling airlines spaceflight
providers the the ability to
know exactly what they will be
on the hook for and how
liability would be defined in
the.
Thank you for that answer I
thank you for that you know
gentle lady I I watch a lot of
bills come through the floor the
are not referred house
appropriation of finance
committee but but they do have
an impact our budget this is the
first one I've seen as a
positive impact.
But yet it was not sent to house
appropriation finance committee
either.
So I I
I think this is a good bill I do
think it should have been sent
to House Appropriations finance
at it would would bolster the
the budget a little bit over
there.
But I I find myself more
importantly wondering are are
they're not going to be any more
request for state funds since
this
Is now generating in the
millions.
Gentlelady.
Mr speaker and gentleman for
economic I can't answer that.
Thank you gentle lady a little
bit of attended chief Madam I
know we have some
divisions within the state that
are independent they generate
their own revenues.
But we still see them manually
coming through the budget
process of I thank you for the
bill I support your bill and I
do appreciate you bringing four
thank you gentle lady.
There's further debate the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Sandoval and Santa Fe
Representative Lord thank you Mr
speaker will the gentle lady
from Bernalillo county please
yield.
R. Mr speaker I yield to the
gentle lady are discounts yeah
thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
I just have a quick question I
notice in here that the FAA
requires operators to carry for
five hundred million and
insurance and one point five
billion insurance cover per
incident.
Is there going to be how are we
going to regulate there's going
to be a committee of who's going
to make sure that all of these
companies because I know right
now virgin galactic but we may
have you on must come there
SpaceX want to come here and
blue origin which of phases may
want to come here who is going
to make sure that they have
their insurance and that their
current and updated on their
insurance.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
so are there are very robust and
specific requirements to
continue at the a certification
that the federal process and so
all insurance provisions and
requirements are checked
regularly in order to keep your
certification.
Okay that was my only question
and do you know if there's other
orders are given one more
question Mr speaker and and
Representative are there going
to be other places that are
other organizations that will
come here besides virgin
galactic will a lan Moscow a
SpaceX or Jeff Bezos blue origin
be coming here to New Mexico as
well.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
over although I I can't answer
that uncertainty because again
I'm not a representative of the
state's border any of those
corporations we're trying to do
New Mexico's create the best
environment possible to want
commercialized with our
freighters to come here because
we offer an unbeatable
combination of factors
infrastructure whether I'll to
to controlled airspace that no
other state can find so by
continuing to do what we're
doing and investing in these
industries for believing in them
and believing that this is the
future of airspace and travel
why wouldn't everybody want to
come here is no one else can
find what we can.
It thank you and gently to miss
because of the question I have I
do support your bill at anything
that helps our economy and
helps.
Put New Mexico first and
foremost is exciting for me so
thank you for bringing this bill
forward.
No further debate the gentle
lady to close.
Mr speaker I think you're
forgetting Mr speaker.
We thought on my board but the
gentleman from Santa Fe speaker
egolf.
Thank you Mr speaker I just have
one question and that is what is
the most exciting
our competitive advantage that
spaceport America has as
compared to other potential
launch sites in United States
I'm sorry mystery will generally
yield.
I yield to the gentleman that
they can't thank you Mr speaker
I can you please tell the body
what is the most exciting
competitive advantage that
spaceport America has as
compared to other lunch
locations anywhere on the earth.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman from Santa Fe there
are a number of exciting factors
but I think the one that stands
out most of the the fact that
the house to the specific of the
location of spaceport America we
are about a mile up bases on the
Syrian Center Mr speaker and
gentleman from Santa Fe that's
what when we tell folks who want
to come that New Mexico for
aerospace and commercialize the
development you come here the
first mile the state is free.
Exactly right thank you Mr
speaker thank you generally.
Is there anyone else in the
inner okay seeing over the
debate the gentle lady to close.

Thank you Mr speaker house bill
ninety two the same drinking
water testing fund
Raises the rate from three cents
to five cents for every thousand
dollars gallons of water
produced by municipal water
systems this building has not
been increased over twenty seven
years the increase will mean
about a forty cents per month
per household bills or five
dollars per year.
These these will be used for
testing to comply with the
federal safe drinking water act
and the regulations by the state
environmental improvement act it
requires the New Mexico
environment department to
publish an annual report
accessible by the public that
details the expenditures and the
test conducted using these
bunnies it also renames the
funds from the water
conservation facts the safe
drinking water yes funds so that
the name is specific to the
services that the fees provide
to drinking water systems across
New Mexico and finally the
stakeholders that support this
bill are The New Mexico New
Mexico Environment Department
The New Mexico rural water
association New Mexico municipal
the New Mexico association of
counties New Mexico department
of health New Mexico taxation
and revenue department and the
rules community associate
assistance corporation of
Mister's Mr speaker I also like
to.
At this time as my co sponsor
issue like to add anything at
this time.
Representative you're on mute.
Morning Mr speaker and thank you
gentle lady yes I'd like to I'd
like to like my colleague and
impact is a sponsor of this
bill.
Believe our communities deserve
to have a government is
committed to doing everything
they can do to ensure that we
have safe water to drink you
read the newspapers and watch
the national local news or go
online you'll find the states of
Michigan and New Jersey are
currently dealing with
contaminated drinking water in
their communities I don't think
there's anything we can do
that's more important than
ensure that our state has a
clean drinking water system for
all citizens and I thank you and
I'll add you back to the gentle
lady.
Thank you Mr speaker with that
we stand for questions through
the bank the gentle lady from
Travis Representative Ezzell.
Mr speaker thank you very much
for the gentle lady's from Dunn
and the and from Rio Ramos and
fade and tell shield.
Mr speaker will yield to the to
the gentle lady.
Mr speaker thank you very much
we all want safe clean water to
drink we wanted there is a
problem we want that taken care
of immediately to send a couple
of instances where there has
been some problems I know the
data my area a couple years ago
small town down there was
infected and the the sampling in
the mediation of the water
supply.
Well but they got it done Mr
speaker and gentle lady's
After doing a little bit of
research I'm kind of concerned
I've seen the.
In the department is quite a
few.
The suspicion.
Not going to call of the
increases I'm gonna call them
what they actually are Mr
speaker this tax increases.
The concerned general ladies can
intervention to the environment
department is doing this what is
the impetus behind in some of
these so called fans Crisis that
are actually tax increases.
Thank you Mr speaker and the
gentle lady
the he has not been there's no
but there's not been a change
that be in over twenty seven
years and in order to make sure
that the that they can keep up
with making sure the water is
clean that they've got to make
an increase if not they have no
plan intended but they'll be
under water.
Christian twenty seven years why
isn't the issue as the last year
the year before the year before
that because we all want clean
safe drinking water but the
concern is
violent Department noticing that
provide some of and day on
The bill that we have here.
The state water drink safe
drinking water testing fund they
also increasing the fees for the
solid waste program and the air
quality program and these are
just some of the bills I found
that have these so called
creases.
By the department and they think
that the department is.
And sometimes they're a little
bit of a change in my opinion.
Mr speaker and gentle lady say
that one of the options.
Answer this if you want to.
This.
Read this and analysis the firm
from members before the
agriculture water resources
committee that I do serve on.
This is going to.
Right for the environment
department.
Thanks.
Million dollars and you really
can you all can either one of
you verify those figures such as
straight up Mr speaker and
gentle lady's.
Mr speaker I yield to my of.
My co sponsor who is ready to
answer the question.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
and gentle lady and and thank
you gentlelady from in the south
I just just to give you some
background on this the water
conservation fund was
established in nineteen ninety
three as an incentive to
conserve water within the state
and is a unique way to fund the
costly sampling and analysis of
contaminants that is required by
the federal safe drinking water
act now over the years that was
good but in two thousand
seventeen to two thousand twenty
the the water conservation fund
revenue average two million one
hundred and sixty six thousand
six hundred and thirteen
annually and total obligations
average two million eight
hundred and fifteen thousand two
hundred and ninety seven
annually during this period the
water conservation fund
expenditures outpace revenue by
an average of approximately six
hundred and fifty thousand per
year
so this is why we're doing this
kind lady it's not that anybody
wants to increase fees on
anybody and certainly I have
small mutual domestic third
forty three small mutual
domestic water systems and in my
area and they will be taxed too
so I thought about this very
carefully I think I think
they've proven that the that the
the the obligations in that way
the demand and and this this
program is funded to go broke by
December of this year in fact in
the appropriation committee we
put in
as you know yesterday six
hundred thousand to just make
sure that we could still do
water sampling in this
transition period so I I would
like or everybody in the house
and certainly you kind lady to
understand that this is really
unnecessary
obligation I think that we have
to fill on on behalf of all the
citizens of our state and I
yield back to.
the gentle lady from genuine.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
very much for that explanation
and I'm from Travis county
within yes okay let's paper that
mixed up and try to put as a on
a bit it is and is.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Senator talking about this fund
it is currently run by the
environment department can you
tell me what the balance of that
funding is right now.
Senator maybe I just missed
hearing.
But gentle lady let me confer
with my expert witness.
The lady I'm being told by my
expert what victories that the
balance of the phone at the end
of fiscal twenty twenty was nine
hundred thousand.
Thousand dollars is what is
currently in the funding this
will generate Mr speaker and
gentle lady said this food
increase for the.
Help this approximately one and
a half million dollars annually.
Mr speaker gentle lady
What we're trying to do that I
think that
Everybody with their own natural
domestic system there on in
city water supply whatever the
case may be.
The clean drinking water my
concern is
This increase its regressive in
nature and and.
Just really concerned about some
of the low income families that
will be hit the hardest and
Mister speaker whenever I see
that the environment department
is coming for with.
Working through bills and
legislators to have their funds
increased to me that is nothing
more than tax increases Mr
speaker gentle ladies thank you
very much for your responses to
my questions and Mister speaker
I yield.
There's further debate the
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr.
For the gentle lady from going
on or no Rio Arriba sentence
health from the yield.
Of oil to the gentleman from San
Juan Mr speaker.
Thank you related Mr speaker by
to focus my questions on page
eight of the bill.
The project.
I'm a turn more specifically.
drugs are you and if you.
Mr speaker it would appear the
gentle lady is there twenty Mr
she's the.
The correct.
What.
Mr speaker I I'm on page eight
and what was the what was the
the number the line number.
So it's progress I ended for one
or Mr speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman I am prepared.
Thank you Mr speaker the wearers
and what these provisions are
getting out of.
If a water supply system I think
has a violation of the in our
middle improvement act these
programs from the.
And do part of that correct.
That is my understanding Mr
speaker Jennifer settle on.
Okay Mister speaker the minor
thing that.
We typically when you have a
violation of that it it requires
more frequent of testing as a
result of that violation and
efforts try to get that.
That water up to the clean water
standards.
Mr speaker that is correct.
It does this.
Of these two paragraphs Mr
speaker to the point the cost of
the additional.
Yes on the water systems.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan
I believe I know the answer but
let me let me confer with my my
and witness.
That is correct Mr speaker.
I'm thank you Mr speaker with
the gentle lady
mind sharing through her expert
witnesses I maybe I missed thank
you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker it is
Rebecca Roose.
Excuse me and our.
Joe Martinez.
Thank you Mr speaker.
So I I I know a lot of these
water districts are our rural
they don't have a lot of
members.
and as a result a lot of these
The association we don't have a
lot of operating capital and if
there is a violation of the
environmental improvement act.
requiring.
That water system to pay for the
additional testing.
Representative a real burden on
those association so with Mr
speaker additionally give me a
little bit inside us to.
Why the trio which was written
to draft the sections to make
that association.
Picked up the additional cost of
the whole thing.
Thank you Mr speaker my
understanding is that this is
actually a more effective for
our water systems I to have what
hello world as water systems in
my district and part of that is
by by being part of this
collective group it is if they
had to do it individually it
would be very effective for them
to provide the services and the
they would be able to to manage
that where
Where where where they're doing
it like this in.
It's taken out
Bye bye.
And I'm gonna refer also to my
my co sponsors to follow up with
the answer as well.
Thank you thank you general John
thank you Madam
Yes.
I was very concerned about this
to it I knew that this would
raise more small mutual
domestics in my district also in
and I think it's important for
the.
The state legislature to
understand that if you were at a
mutualistic wanted but less than
a hundred of people your your
annual salary increase your tax
and taxing would be about
seventy three dollars.
If you were a one if you're a
small mutual domestic but the
best five hundred users here
your increase would be about a
hundred and sixty five the year
if you have less than a if you
had.
Your annual increase would be
about seven hundred thirty
dollars.
I I actually.
Or that it is a small thanks to
are having a very good to have
you ample
but then it they do that as is
this the state it's it's only
when you go you have.
If you have a kind of a thing or
you have to amend our sneaker
the.
Your real.
When that comes in the past more
samples and you have to pay.
Most part this is three one and
the mutual domestics are at a
given an injection and your back
to the a kind of.
People
are.
Thank you Mr speaker
Increasing the rate so I I get I
get the need for that it was
mentioned that it's been over
twenty years I think most
consumers understand inflation
and I know that these things
need to track employee I'm sorry
you know I think coming from me.
I worry about again these these
rural water districts that have
aging infrastructure
and trying to keep up with the
environmental improvement act
and if they happen to have a
violation.
That that not only increase the
rates but what we're doing is
we're making those water systems
and a for the new and additional
testing.
That will come about as a result
of environmental improvement act
I'm just wondering
about the for profit behind
making those entities
responsible for the thank you Mr
speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
you know the the municipally
worked very hard with this
legislation and they supported
the provisions because it for
further support
Fund follows the in a long term
way and so on where are you I
know
adding a little because on the
front end we're we're literally
talking pennies to making sure
that our water is clean
For a for all of our area.
Mr speaker.
Thank also that the extra cost
Mr speaker are only this is
violated the rule and so we're
not talking on the a consistent
basis we're only talking about
because I.
Just to clarify that.
Mr speaker No thank you Mr
speaker.
And that's on purpose subsection
by injections
of water systems violated the
environmental proven are.
What what comes about result
again to try to get that water
up to standard and we're gonna
now require more frequent
testing of that water systems
and I that makes me understand
what the federal government
mandates that again the end goal
is we want our system.
Our water sources to be queens
and to be safe and reliable
my concern that expressed is
again not so much the increase
in rates is it.
Raul
Water and if you need to have
aging infrastructure and trade
your mileage you have to pay for
the increased and so I don't
have any further questions I
just.
I think that might end up being
a burden on a rural communities
so thank you Mr speaker.
There's further debate.
The gentleman from Colfax curry
Harding quay Roosevelt San
Miguel and.
Gentleman are Chatfield.
Thank you very the gentleman
yield.
I yield.
Mr speaker I rise in support of
this bill nobody likes for you
thank you water it better than I
do more from this area many
years I do however have a few
questions
I think we have ascertain that
we're talking about usual
domestic is there any certain
supplies of mutual domestic.
That gonna fix in the
requirement for testing.
I yield to my co sponsor.
Thank you.
Eighty that gentleman
mutual domestics are required to
the US testing every year to
make sure as required by the
Environment Department I
actually don't know the schedule
they required to do testing
According to the that the law.
Annually and and they have to
report that back I'm not sure if
it's annually or more than that
at mutual domestics are also
defined assistance to more than
twenty five people.
Thank you which features are
what size would be twenty five
anything of the sort twenty five
or.
Just the.
It was also stated that there
was so much per thousand gallons
of water
Is that annually the the cost
percent with no water annually
or monthly or weekly.
Work related.
Mr speaker and that kind
gentleman the the the the
environment department as I know
as far as I know that's that's
kind of a month the payment that
they pay and they they have a
monthly payment and at certain
levels and a monthly payment
they pay into that
that fund on a monthly basis so
you're not hit with and all the
ones.
I'm sorry your.
Repeated again
just so I'm trying.
Mr speaker the lady the cost of
the PCS increases that five
thousand gallons per month.
Thank you Mr speaker that is
correct in its monthly to taxed
Rav.
Of.
Thank you gentle lady Mr Mr
speaker you have an idea of some
of the things we have to for.
Mr speaker I'm having a little
trouble hearing you but I think
you you asked what they test for
is that is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes.
Okay of I think that just.
Growing up to that I think
bacteria of fecal matter arsenic
are probably the top three
that the that are being tested
for.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
do we have labs.
These sales.
We have with
I'm sorry we're having a really
hard time hearing the gentleman
I think it's the last Mr
speaker.
Mr speaker gentle lady I was I
just
I fully support this bill but I
was just wondering do we have
the lab in the state of New
Mexico Senator capable of
performing these tests and we
send them out of state.
Mr speaker and and gentleman we
have twenty two eight in New
Mexico.
In all twenty two of these labs
to water quality testing that is
correct Mr speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady I support this bill
our reserves without.
Thank you.
Further debate.
Gentleman from grant and
although and zero.
All right seen over the debate
the gentle lady to close.
Thank you Mr.
Hang on hang on
there is further debate the
gentleman from Chavis Eddie no
terrible.
Thank you Mr speaker.
We have reached the one and with
all this technology this spring.
And so I think we we appreciate
it
Representative a couple of
questions.
I understand there's nine
hundred thousand dollars in the.
This account.
Currently only the last fiscal
year is that correct.
Thank you Mr speaker yes that
that is my understanding.
What's the stand for that
department what and how much did
we spend out of that account
annually.
Mr speaker would need to confer
with my expert witness
Please please hold on.
Gentlelady.
Can I have the answer that in
two thousand seventeen to two
thousand and twenty the total
obligations average two million
eight hundred and fifteen
thousand two hundred ninety
seven annually so the the
obligations are far surpassing
what a revenue stream is at this
point.
One of the gentleman is please
identify your experts.
Representative is one one of
generally these please identify
your experts.
Mr chair expertise Rebecca Roose
and none just Martinez from the
environment department thank you
Representative continue thank
you Mr speaker gentle lady
The.
Shares right out on the.
I have a fifteen percent reserve
in that account.
If you spend.
Yes twice budget reserve is.
Operate the stated twenty
percent.
Money.
Mr speaker kind gentleman
I I would I would just like to
say this again it the we are we
are scheduled to run out of
money at the end of twenty
twenty one I they would use to
all their money by the end of
twenty twenty one doing the
testing that we're conducting
now and I I I guess I just want
to repeat this in two thousand
seventeen to two thousand twenty
the water conservation funds
revenue average two million one
hundred and sixty six thousand
six hundred and thirteen
annually and and the total
obligations
how you know how much and to
spend to get this testing done
was two million eight hundred
and fifteen thousand two hundred
ninety seven annually so
the the the expenditures
exceeded
the the intake by approximately
six hundred and fifty thousand
dollars a year so that's why we
need money to replenish that is
fun.
The gentle lady are you testing
then you have historically.
If you haven't had an increase
in twenty seven years and you've
got a balance in the account.
That's because in the but
because in the drop down is
there is a more testing being
required Mr to the kind gentle
lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
don't know if we're doing the
testing that needs to be tested
I think people probably are more
concerned about water these days
we have a bigger population and
we have the.
We have all the infrastructure
in the state and that adds to
the need for testing so there
are a lot of problems with water
systems in New Mexico and I'm
just I'm just laying out the
facts I I mean I don't know why
there's been an increase I guess
we could check with our experts
on that
but frankly it's this is the
demand is outpacing what we have
in the in the funded to cover
these costs and I think I think
the most important thing for
families in the state is plain
drinking water we certainly
don't want to take the path of
other states and and and hold
back on these tests are not a
help people I I do have a lot of
mutual majestic water systems in
my State Street in my district
as a kind gentleman and they do
pay attention to these things
and they're very careful about
how they do this and I miss
compliment in my department
because they are they reach out
to them and they help them
accomplish of these critical
tasks so so is there any more
for more testing these days I I
would chalk that up to a lot of
the for infrastructure in our in
our systems all over the state
Mr a kind gentleman.
John I do labor the point my
family helped so create
A role.
But what I sat on the board of
our rural water collapse I'm
completely aware of the testing
but.
The.
A little bit
By.
Is that if three samples.
Has.
Clean water for twenty seven
years and have a balance in the
account of nine hundred thousand
dollars.
If you.
Add additional testing.
I'm just trying to figure out
what the what the other of.
Million half dollars two years
to be spent on that's what I'm
trying to figure out that we
don't have a we don't have an
just maybe have a hundred
percent more water collapse in
the state some it's got a man
to.
Yes they're charging you more
for the testing.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Each of those it.
Which of those is.
Mr speaker and and kind
gentleman I would say both the
cost of the testing has
increased and the the
requirements have also increase
of how much has to be tested so
the combination of of both of
those things has.
With no type of incremental
increase in over twenty seven
years it's time to to make sure
that this of their fully funded
so that we can continue to make
sure that they are that there
are the residents in our
constituents are getting clean
water across the state thank you
Mr speaker.
Thank you thank you.
Is there for the debate.
Gentleman from Dona Ana grant
and Sierra.
Representative.
Thank you.
Mr speaker can look kindly
please you'll.
I yield to the gentleman.
Thank you very much sorry I
can't stand up what to call this
point too short.
Some of the problems that we're
having right.
About Mr speaker gentle lady
I just was
Questions about in somewhere
answer I guess when it came to
the
I guess the cost of your and and
I just wanted to hear what if
you have a specific expenditure
that had been
changed so significantly.
that is causing this problem.
I heard generalization and stuff
but since you have your.
Extremist you Mr I'm assuming
that's the person that's
handling the budget being that
they're asking for this extra
funds.
my question was what what was
that specific does specific
expenditures increased
substantially causing this
issue.
Thank you Mr speaker and
and gentleman I am what I'm
being told is the lab cost as
staffers salaries are have have
been increased lamppost for
chemical analysis is definitely
been the the highest contributor
to to the rise of the
needing more money.
Mr speaker I'm AT thank you so
much
just just another question is
what would happen if this then
that is I mean.
When the state with the state
still be.
obligated to provide these
services.
even if it didn't pass.
Well Mister Mr speaker and
gentleman
of what would happen is that the
the testing would be cut and of
course the municipalities would
have to pay their own way and
then we would jump definitely
see an increase of especially in
our rural areas and so this is
try this is what we're trying to
do to to address that issue.
Mr speaker currently do are you
telling me that if this is.
Bill doesn't pass the state New
Mexico will no longer be able
to.
The or find those forget the
rate provides the services
necessary to test water again.
Mr
Mr speaker and gentleman of we
would be able to cover all the
expenses and so we would not be
It would not get we would not
have the services that we have
now which would put all New
Mexicans in jeopardy.
I'm lady.
I think I understand is that
they would have to it would be
obligated to do it would have to
find somewhere General budget to
help.
This and Department to do that
I think you know the only thing
is that the concerns because I
do live in a rural area.
And I live in a highly
Our first area.
On a point in my district are
very public some even though it
seems you know it's a small tax
increase.
Some of my family's.
Literally coming together this
is going to this is this is
another subject.
The school has been out
literally they are pitching
money together.
To pay for
our internet service so the
children can participate in
school.
So even though it's so small
parts of my district it's
tremendous for them.
my other concern was as I was
knocking doors to many people
from my district.
The number one complaint that
they had as well as water.
Right so high and do what it was
it was almost every door all
fitting
and was that in the that
question was brought up.
And being that most of the small
municipalities don't have the
economic.
Yes engines that some of the
larger cities have.
They always lean on on on
raising revenue for water.
And so that that is what
concerns me about this bill but
I'm with you a hundred percent
but we need clean water.
Else will express that I believe
it's the The New Mexico's
responsibility make sure that
that is done for every New
Mexicans whether this process or
not
that we have spent a tremendous
amount of money of other
programs that.
Maybe wouldn't be as as
Is high on the scale in my
opinion to this and this is a
small our amount of funding
really that I believe the part
to get it and if.
The New Mexico environment
department actually needs that.
The state of New Mexico might
you should be providing that and
not putting the burden anymore
burden on the forest people of
our state which is of course in
my district thank you so much
for your time Mr speaker

gentle lady I have some
questions on this and so we just

I'm sorry will that gentlelady

Yes Mr speaker I yield to the

Santa and Santa Fe counties.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
I apologize for that I'm can you

what was the purpose on that.
Thank you gentle lady.
The Leo Santa Santa Fe and Santa
Fe counties we had a working
meeting with the department of
TRD and and be on the process
Teeming idea cards for
individuals under the age of
twenty five.
And with in this working group
we learned that and we did not
need to
we did not need to.
Go through this process we can
actually get ID cards for
individuals under the age of
twenty five there is a process
so as a result of having a
meeting with TRD and motor
vehicle we will continue to
streamlined application forms
for individuals under the age of
twenty five so now this bill
only pertains to individuals.
As opposed to home with you as
opposed to your it is now
homeless individuals and now
only pertains to the waiver.
And
the the.
The identification
the definition of homeless
individual.
Mr speaker.
Thank you gentlemen Mr speaker
Mr speaker I have so there's
some confusion for me on this C.
removing the word enabling and
company unaccompanied homeless
youth is a reason why you just
didn't strike out the words used
on that because now it just says
removing fee requirements for
issuance of identification cards
to.
Homeless as that time
understanding this new change in
the wording.
Mr speaker and representative
from Bernalillo Sandoval in
Santa Fe can you repeat your
question please okay.
Thank you what I'm asking is it
seems like it would have just
been easier to strike the
company unaccompanied and strike
you so it's a enabling homeless
to receive identification cards
because you're striking it out
now it's for says relating to
identification cards removing
fee requirements for issuance of
identification cards to.
Homeless individuals is that
correct.
Mr speaker Representative
gentlelady from Bernalillo
Sandoval in Santa Fe the way I
read it is an act relating to
identification cards.
Homeless.
And act relating to
identification cards semicolon
homeless in the colon removing
the requirements for issuance of
identification cards to homeless
individuals.
Thank you Representative for
explaining that thank you Mr
chair
let me look at the other moment
just one second please on page
one point seventeen.
So Mr chair so we're removing.
On line seventeen.
Six through twenty four were
taken out this entire section is
that correct can you complain
why removing the section mmhm.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady from Bernalillo Santa and
Santa Fe counties I explain that
to you a few minutes ago.
We are removing section one
because it deals with the
ability of unaccompanied your
to get an ID on their own behalf
we had a meeting.
With the department of motor
vehicle.
We have a working group now so
now.
Items in section one we are
going to will we have worked out
and we are going to streamline
that process.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you Representative Mr
speaker so the understanding is
is basically we are trying to
say is that you're removing the
section the youth and you're
just making it for anybody who
is homeless and under twenty
five is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo Sandoval yes it is
only a few waiver and the
definition of homeless
individual okay thank you for
that explanation I want to make
sure that that we all understood

stand them point at this bill
I'm glad to do it make the
necessary changes in this bill
is not just strictly for
homeless youth Mr speaker gentle
lady I am going to.
Sentifi and.
Interested in discussing this
bill there is a total mining
area by the name of mark green
and he works with the.
Works for the ministry down
there that helps feed the
homeless and helps help them
find jobs and and this man is
absolutely remarkable Mr speaker
and gentle lady.
A couple years ago with this
same issue because.
If somebody had been picked up
and was incarcerated and upon.
This chart from jail.
One of the stipulations was that
they had to find a job.
And most of these people could
not.
Get a job because they lacked
identification.
Mr grain.
The federal building especially
on the people that were homeless
that needed to get some sort of
identification cards trying to
help them trained.
Assess the security card.
Mr speaker gentle lady whenever
these people could not get into
the federal building to get it
to get a social security card I
was very frustrating.
To Mr grain.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
worked with our county
commission.
Trying to get.
This call is any sort of
identification card especially
for these younger people.
I think that.
Be able to find.
Work someplace.
Mr speaker gentle lady it is
very.
Frustrating for this is for
those people working with the
homeless.
To try to get some names for
they can be gainfully employed.
That.
Can be gainfully employed but
those of them that don't want
to.
Have a job to try to improve
their lives.
I'm able to do this Mr speaker.
The bill to take to make
application to work it's very
troublesome photo as the
legislative government body
going to do.
To help these people that want
to be able to help themselves.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
really don't have any questions
I just need to.
Point out to the body this is
ancient stumbling block not only
in my County the counties
throughout New Mexico for these
people cannot get access to be
able to give some sort of
identification card thank you
very much.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlelady from Travis county

my kind neighbor from Catherine
Sikora and little and see a
counties.
Thank you Mr speaker and prime
lady one of my questions is.
On page five line thirteen the
definition of homeless
individual.
Is that definition taken from
somewhere or did you all make
that definition.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady.
Transection has been eliminated.
And if you go to.
page eighty.
Line.
Line one.
Then we have we also have that
definition of home homeless
individuals in that section as
well.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady so this page eight line one
has been added or eliminated.
H. eight.
Stays intact.
Your question about page.
The prior page is eliminated.
Thank you Mr speaker hi ladies
or that clarification.
One of the so was that
definition and taken out of
something that's already in tax
in another piece of legislation.
Or is this something that.
Was made by you all this
definition.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and thank you gentlelady from.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Hi lady kind gentle lady.
Let me defer to my expert
witness.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
Candelaria gentle lady the
homeless definition of homeless
youth event that homeless
individual definition comes from
the federal May McKinney Act.
Okay thank you Mr.
And that is the program that
assists.
Unless you're in our in our
public schools.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady I was just surprised to see
trailer park definition comes
from the federal McKinney vento
act.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Gentlelady from.
And kind gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady I want to I wonder to your
expert witnesses as well as your
introduced.
Would you please introduce your
expert to the body.
You Mr speaker at my expert
witness is her name is Patricia
Jolene alley.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady that's all my questions
Reuters thank you Mr there is
further debate the gentle lady
from Bernalillo Santa and Santa
Fe Representative Lord.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker.
So my question is on this so I'm
I'm trying to look up apparently
there was a lot of changes to
this bill since it went through
my committee.
So we removed homeless
individual.
On page five line thirteen.
We are keeping.
On page eight.
The use of homeless individual
on that I think I understand
that correctly.
Am I missing the portion in the
amendment where we stand now say
words homeless individuals up to
age twenty five and this bill.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady from Bernalillo
Sandoval in Santa Fe.
The.
As I mentioned before.
We took out section one which
deals with the ability to assess
unaccompanied here to get an ID
under the age of twenty five so
that section has been eliminated
so now we are working on a bill
that pertains to with
individuals.
And so this bill now only
pertains to the waiver for
homeless individuals and the
definition of homeless
individual.
Thank you and Representative and
Mr chair as so I have a question
please on page five.
Line three.
Or talk about every division
office word identification card
issues still doesn't made a
supervisory level staff member
to serve as a homeless liaison.
Who is this going to do the
training and how is that
training going to be
administered.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady that section of
the bill has been eliminated
however as I mentioned before we
had a meeting with TRD and MPD.
And we have created a working
group and the secretary and her
staff are committed to making
adjustments and taking steps to
ensure the practice of helping
individuals get in nineteen.
So the training that will be
provided will be to the and the
the field offices as well as the
community and school advocate.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
At thank you Representative
thank you Mr chair actually did
like this portion before because
it did ensure that there would
be some training for this so my
other question to you is
because I do want to homeless
and that's why I voted for this
in the first place I'm trying to
dissect this now to make sure
it's still saying the same thing
I agreed upon before when it was
in committee.
So on this section here can you
tell me now with homeless or did
this section get stricken out
On page five point twenty five
whose homeowners can be verified
is that still in this bill or
did that get removed as well.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady that.
Is also stricken now.
Okay so that leads me to my
question and it's it's not
really that big a deal really
and and the grand scheme of
things because I do want people
to have access to get their ID.
So I what are we going to use to
be able to tell that these
people are in fact homeless what
is going to be the criteria for
that.
If you go to a.
Eight eight.
Line eighteen.
Nineteen twenty twenty one
twenty two twenty three twenty
four twenty five and.
To the end of the bill that is
where you will find that
information.
Thank you Representative so that
stays the same because that's
what was written down before so
basically
and Mr chair what I'm trying to
find out is so they're they're
homelessness is verified just
you that they make a statement
that they are in fact homeless
is that correct Mr speaker
gentle lady okay okay at and
thank you Representative for
answering all my questions I
apologize I was trying to go
through this and just see what
was taken out what was added
where we're going with this bill
I still going to support it so
thank you and thank you Mr chair
I yield my time.
Thanks for the debate the
gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
will a kind lady from McKinley
and San Juan please you'll.
Thank you Mr speaker I yield to
the kind gentleman.
Thank you kind lady my first
question is actually for the
speaker or or the house
parliamentarian.
After we cast your amendment I
noticed that it doesn't seem
that any longer apply to the
title of the bill.
The title of the bill is.
Homeless you.
But yes.
The body of the bill does not
address homeless youth at this
point is that correct.
Mr speaker joined.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes.
So I I guess Mr speaker my
question is.
Is that appropriate do we need
to re title this bill what what
do we need to do or because it's
fine to have a title this does
not relate to the content of the
body the bill.
Representative Crowder I'm
assuming you're asking for a
response from the sponsor
correct.
Mr speaker I I thought I had
directed it I thought you Sir Mr
Stewart the house
parliamentarian and I thought I
had directed to you.
gentleman give me just a minute
I miss that request from the
look of the bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
From curry.
Does the amendment in the title
not re title the title of the
bill.
Thank you Mr speaker.
What.
With the representative please
restate the question are we
referring to the first
amendment.
Mr speaker.
Are you asking.
County.
Mr speaker and gentleman very
County did the amendment.
The bill.
Mr speaker.
Mr speaker I believe the
representatives correct the
title was changed in the
amendment.
For your the language was
stricken.
Redistricting amendment and go
for the final appropriate.
Chavis and Lincoln please raise
your point.
What which.
Was stricken in the amendment.
Addressing the representative
from encouraging counties
concern.
So I believe that the title now
is at your.
And I agree.
So the discussion will continue
the objection is overruled if.
Of the gentleman like to proceed
with the debate.
Thank you Mr speaker and and I I
I wasn't objecting I was just
enquiring so I appreciate that
very much thank you Sir.
Avid strive hard.
Thank you Mr speaker gentlelady
of I'm curious after learning
yesterday that forty seven
percent of the homeless in
America reside within the state
of California.
So can you tell me how many
homeless do we have in the state
of New Mexico how many people.
does this bill affect or does
that apply to.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen.
I am enquiring with my expert
witness at this time.
Thank you time gentle lady.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you kind gentleman and members
of the body my apologies for not
knowing this information right
off hand this is the probably
the most important information
that we should know.
So data from the US department
of housing and urban development
show that three thousand two
hundred and forty one.
Our homeless individuals and
that is the most recent count
and again my apologies for not
having that information right on
hand we got so involved in the
processes of acquiring and ID
and identification card we we.
We did not think to look at
thank you Mr speaker and that
kind gentleman.
Thank you general I'm not sure
that I call that number I think
you said three thousand two
hundred and forty one is that
correct Gillette Mr speaker and
gentleman yes that is correct.
Thank you very much so I I love
the look forward to supporting
your bill is I was just curious
how many are actually impacted
by the bill that we're looking
at today I thank you for
bringing this forth thank you Mr
speaker I'm done there's further
debate the gentle lady from
grant and although and zero.
Thank thank you Mr speaker
gentle lady from Canada one
please you.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
generating I yield.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
to the lady so what we have what
we need sure with the amendment
is awaiting the ID for people
who are.
To find out how much in fact.
It regardless of their age.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
That is correct.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you for the lady from McKinley
San Juan.
On page eight.
On line seven it's under be.
It is saying living in motels
hotels trailer parks.
Or camping grounds due to
alternative adequate
accommodations.
Yes the so I'm just there are a
lot of trailer parks in my
district I do.
What's going to happen.
In fact staff fear county is
over eighty percent trailers and
many of those trailers are in
trailer parks and in the
McKinley vento homeless
Education Act.
The trailer.
It I think I'm correct in this
trailer needs to be missing a
skirt or have adequate housing
issues with the cut housing to
qualify and I understand in
defining the definite homeless
use and how to remove those
barriers for you.
You can see that definition do
you believe this might be a
little bit to Veronica that
we're waiting the fees for which
I'm after waiting Pete.
folks who live in trailers.
Or choose to live in campgrounds
I suggest that any senior
citizens living on a fixed
income would lack alternative
accommodations.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you kind gentle lady no I I
don't think so I don't think
it's too broad living in mold
motels hotels trailer park their
current camping grounds due to
lack of alternative adequate
accommodations I think you're
fine the situation where
individuals may live in trailer
parks and camping grounds that
are not adequately.
That do not provide an adequate
and safe environment.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
kind gentle lady and.
Thank you online sixteen same
page page eight nineteen living
in cars parks public spaces
availability of standard
housing.
Again I believe a lot of money
area could qualify under
substandard housing so I'm not
it sounds to me like this bill
is actually going to waive the
fee for homeless.
And low income theoretically
anyone low income comprise I
have no screen on my train.
I have funding issues at my home
and we would waive this fee and
I think I'm not suggesting
that's too broad I'm just
suggesting that because there's
no
and verification through no
required and the definition of
trailer parks and substandard
housing act is brought.
This could go beyond homeless to
folks who are low income.
Because we use the definition of
the McKinley vento homeless
Education Act of course a you
under twenty five his permanent
residence is it in our the park
would qualify for the thirty
forty dollars here in the
assistance provided by the
McKinley then to homeless
Education Act.
Right now.
It it seems that folks who have.
If you look at the USDA rural
assessment of how.
Nearly every rural community
qualifies for upgrades and
renovations under the definition
of substandard housing.
Not that.
Providing free ID for folks who
have lived in trailer parks but
a senior citizen nineties and R.
V. as their primary residences
in a trailer park as a way to.
To best utilize their bonding
and holding.
Thank you Mr speaker generating.
For the debate the gentleman
from the Representative
Pettigrew.
Thank you Mr speaker
to the gentle lady from McKinley
and San Juan you'll thank you Mr
speaker yes I yield to the
gentleman.
Thank you
The lady Mr speaker
one line thirteen.

number one the word search and.
And replaced it with the word

Mr speaker and gentleman.
Yes.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle

Okay
Mr speaker gentle lady for
understand the emphasis for
amendment number one.
Was the working group the
started after you check the
bills that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman would
you say that again.
Mr speaker gentle lady my
understanding is of the the
reason.
Section one has been stricken
from.
The act.
House bill one twenty seven this
because of the working group
that started after.
House bill one twenty seven was
chapters is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
We all know as representatives
that I bill works through
committees and so as this bill
was working through the
committee.
Questions were answered.
As a result.
Amendments were recommended as a
result we had a meeting with TRD
and and BT.
So yes Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker.
What is the.
Step two prior to the bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
We have worked with.
A community schools and
organizations prior to the bill.
Thank you Mr speaker.
And my specific question and one
why did we not reach out with.
TRD and of the team beforehand
they were going to be involved
with
implementing this bill.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Because we had a specific item
to discuss Mr speaker and
gentleman.
And and Mr speaker and Dolly I
understand that and and and as I
look at today's agenda.
Why the bill was elected all
issues ID cards seems to be the
original intent of the bill
would that be accurate Mr
speaker going Mr.
Representative we've discussed
this this issue is already been
before the body tools can find
your discussion now to the bill

Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you members of the body.
I'm.
It makes sense compliance
in objections so ordered
tools to attention to
concurrence calendar number one.
Increase counter the gentle lady
from Los Alamos Rio Arriba
Sandoval Santa Fe.
For innovation.
on screen for new members we
have house taxation and revenue
committee says to for hospitals
of New.
that bill was amended in the
Senate.
when that happens the house has
the option either to concur in
the Senate amendments or to not
occur to the Senate amendments
if the house concurs the bill
passes if the house is not
concur that we send the bill to
a conference committee or the
Senate receipts from its
amendments those are the three
options.
This works is so those are the
three options that house agrees
the house disagrees and it has
disagrees the Senate either
receives or the bill goes to
conference.
the amendment in the Senate is
available on the legislative
website if you go to the
legislation section of the
website with the past eleven
you'll see this and in
amendments in the amendments in
context area and when I called
on the gentle lady from Los
Alamos National explain the
senators to hospital read and
she is the primary sponsor of
the bill so we call on her to
explain with the Senate did in
amending the bill.
Generating are you ready on that
I'd okay so we're gonna item one
on concurrence calendar number
one.
If you are muted.
Thank you Mr speaker and members
of the body.
This bill was considered in
house finance a Senate finance
yesterday or two days ago and it
was amended in committee as well
as on the floor and I am
recommending concurrence with
both amendments.
That does briefly what the
Senate amendment does.
yes Mr speaker.
Much of the amendment and that
was done and Senate finance.
Is what you might call cleanup.
In addition it calls out her
portion of the bill that related
to the G. R. T. financing
mechanism for large projects
through the leader fund.
You'll recall Mister speaker at
one point in the bill had a
provision that allows recapped
for of construction G. R. T. on
eight large projects and
provided a mechanism for using
that money on that project that
entire provision has been
removed from the bill in the now
the bill is essentially a grant
program for
businesses in the state who have
been.
Significantly adversely impacted
by the effects of the COVID
crisis that we've been suffering
through this past year.
Thanks.
The gentle lady has thanks for
and then she's moved the house
concurrent in the sentiments to
has taxation and revenue
committee substitute.
For house bill Levin as amended.
And she urged the body to vote
yes Is there debate on that
motion the gentleman from Chavis
it into terror.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady yield.
I will gladly yield to the
gentleman from Travis.
with that change in the Senate.
The FIR and and has been
drastically.
Affected has and that can go
over that a little bit or am I
misunderstanding.
Mr speaker and gentleman I would
say no what it what has happened
this is just one provision of
the bill has been eliminated and
the remaining portions of the
FIR still stand with regard to
the the grant program.
And to do three things at once
so bear with me if I'm being
redundant but.
Then is the.
The thing that's left is the two
hundred million grant portion is
that correct.
Mr speaker and content and
that's correct.
Gentlelady thank you very much
for that clarification.
This Madam curry.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady please you.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
yield.
Thank you gentle lady I'm I'm
looking at page thirty eight of
the bill as amended.
And on the left side just
outside the column it has some
underscored means new do in the
structure of it has blown and
has read.
and I honestly can't recall is
the blue and the red the new
amendment to the Senate put in
the bill.
Or is that the black it's the
underscored stricken.
Mr speaker and gentleman I don't
know what document you're you're
looking at are you looking at
the
The part of the amendments.
Thank you I can help out there
on a point of order gentleman
from curry if you're looking to
build that does not reflect the
Senate amendment you need to
look either at the Senate
finance committee committee
report or at the Senate floor
amendment.
Which are separate documents.
You can also have item in rules
version of it by clicking on the
amendments in context but.
On the page for House Bill Levin
that'll show everything in one
combined document.
And thank you Mr speaker I think
I'm looking at the amendments in
context.
And then there is some language
in here that is underscored some
the district in in black ink.
And then there is some that is
stricken in reading and then
bolted in blue.
In trying to figure out which
ones are which.
Page thirty eight it talks about
the the severance tax permanent
fund shall be invested in
Sanford.
Separate differential rate
market rates best with classes.
And the.
This seems to be a new language.
Directing how these monies from
the permanent fund will be
invested.
And I don't fully comprehend how
that's part of the bill that's a
grant can you help me understand
line that'll have the lines on
page thirty eight.
Continues on Mr speaker gentle
in the page thirty nine.
Thank you for that Mr speaker
but I'm still not clear what
what document you're looking at.
Also missing context document
doesn't have a page thirty eight
or thirty nine.
It stops the page is a thirty
six page document.
Okay so all document that was
amended but not the final
documents of thank you Mr
speaker
I.
I feel like I'm a little
blindsided in orders and see
this today so I will go back and
review it and look at it I know
that we did not have an
opportunity to look at this bill
as it came through.
A house appropriation in the I
didn't see it there the.
I don't know what to think of
the bill at this moment.
Can you tell me gentle lady how
much of the funds within this
bill are severance tax funds and
how much of a more general funds
Mr speaker Tallman there are no
severance tax funds any longer
and of this bill this bill is
amended earlier in the house
process to make the money
Senator fund monies.
Okay so one hundred percent of
the bill is general fund money.
The gentle lady out I will
you'll rest my time of going to
go look for what to say on.
And said that the appropriations
committee did not have an
opportunity to review this
I do know that it came to the
fore quickly
But I will do my best to
research it before we vote in a
minute thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen.
Gentleman from the general fund
granted documents here.
Thank thank you Mr speaker and
thank you to the lady at a few
of my questions have been
answered but.
Point of order or just process
I'm pulled up the amendment from
the Senate side is the blue
highlights what is in the bill
now and read is what struck.
Just to clarify.
I'm sorry with the gentle lady
please feel.
Mr speaker gentle lady and I'm
happy to yield.
I'm gonna send thank you Mr
chairman thank you can only
assume that.
What I pulled up what's written
is blue is new language is that
correct Mr speaker.
Mr speaker telling again I do
not know what document your
house there are two amendments
that have been passed out on the
floor the proposed documents
Representative the Senate.
Do you.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
don't have a document that was
passed out on the floor we were
directed to go to the website
and look at and so I'm trying to
maneuver this because I am used
to having a document off and on
for when I'm looking at in blue
actually I page this is because
the lines have pages it's in
New.
Reduced I'm a little perplexed
by the confusion it on every
page of the amendments in
context document on the left it
says.
The language armaments new
language red is deleted
language.
So I think I understand the
confusion but that that is that
guide to into understanding the
missing context document is
printed on every page.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
to the lady so I don't know what
consumers is because they're not
numbered and they're not to
noted on the left but it says.
that is the Senate finance
committee they added new
languages as the placement of
new broadband telecommunications
facilities provided that the
facility shall not serve a
public facility or location that
already needs Federal
communication commission
baseline the founder.
Mr speaker gentle lady that's
new it and that's pretty
significant change it wasn't
described in your summary of the
amendments could you please tell
us how that came about.
Yes thank you for that question
gentle lady there is a very good
point and I apologize for not.
Pointing it out that was an
amendment proposed I believe by
Senator Candelaria.
Of
Some of the telecommunication
companies and it it simply
clarifies Mr speaker gentle lady
that certain types of broadband
projects would be eligible
to participate in the lead the
program.
Thank thank you Mr speaker and
thank you to the lady and when
we originally heard this bill
and the commerce committee it
was using severance tax funds
and it was actually the four
hundred million that we
appropriated during that special
of which we had so narrowly
focused for small businesses
that I think going about thirty
five million was used and so we
have this three hundred and some
million sitting there in the
severance tax fund
and now.
And and because of that at least
an educator in the commerce
committee it was limited to
leases and more and rents.
But could not be used for
mortgage now you're using
general operating funds did that
change those restrictions.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
At a point in the house process
mortgages were added as eligible
for receiving payments through
this program Mr speaker gentle
lady the I hope I answered the
question.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady ended that.
Could have stayed using the
severance tax fund.
Or did it need to be general
operating funds in order for
that to be allowable.
Mr speaker gentle lady I can't
answer that question.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
why did it switch from severance
tax funds to general operating
fund.
Of.
I have translated that point of
when the bill came through if
the if the general is questions
would.
pertain to the motion before the
body dealing with the amendment
that would be great.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
The the new language again I'm
sorry I cannot tell you I think
it's page twenty nine.
And recovery and thirteen
entity remains active and open.
And can demonstrate a net
increase in the number of full
time equivalent employees
relative to the immediately
preceding quarter so before I
think you more specified who's
eligible so now it is explicit
in language which was a concern
of the commerce committee that
they can be eligible or
ineligible quarter by quarter is
that not the case Mr speaker
gentle lady Mr speaker gentle
lady I think that's a fair
comparison.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
gentle lady on page thirty the
new language that if a recovery
and thirteen loses eligibility
in a corner the authorities have
a five the funds for the
recovery entities access should
the recovery and you can
eligible again in assisting
quarters that I think that is a
really good change I'm sorry
that I'm.
We know that as we go.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady it appears that part of the
eligibility of the language is
that the business had an
eligible entity had to
experienced a decline in
business revenue between one or
more comfortable quarters in
taxable years nineteen and
twenty at the term right
economic development department
and it's very based on
documentation provided by the.
Will the Economic Development
department because I need the
documentation that's required.
Mr speaker gentle lady I believe
they will be working with the
and on a in terms of defining
what the appropriate
documentation will be.
So Mr speaker gentle lady the
Economic Development.
Department is now going to work
with MFA.
To determine who's eligible but
with the demonstrated.
Decline in revenue.
Mr speaker gentle lady I believe
that's always been.
Thank you Mr speaker gently I
thought that we the NMFA from of
so the guidelines in the and
noted that economic development
was weighing in on that on that
and thank you Mr speaker and
thank you gentle lady and so
this is just another I I don't
know the answer and I think
Representative Crowder brings up
a question when it went from.
Severance tax funds that we've
already appropriated and special
to general fund what was why was
that not did not need and it's
two million members it's still
three million.
Mr speaker gentle lady
appropriation is two hundred
million two hundred four two
hundred million I it did not
need to go to appropriations.
Generating the bill was referred
to the Appropriations Committee
in compliance with the rules and
then the chair and then we
withdrew the bill from the
committee in consultation with
the leadership of the committee.
Thank you Mr speaker just.
Because I'm learning why.
One one.
What would be when you're states
occurrences and so wasn't hurt
at appropriations the
appropriation referrals removes.
I just wondering why.
These we didn't it didn't need
to be heard.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
Gentleman from Chavis and
Lincoln Representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker.
The gentle lady from Los Alamos
County you'll.
Mr speaker and gentleman I do
you.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
I think the correct the Senate.
Because I'd never make any
mistakes but I think that maybe
one.
And I turn you to.
The.
Finance committee.
Amendment reports.
Number item number seven cents
on pages twenty through through
twenty six point six and ten
minutes the higher the.
But they failed to remember the
six stating session section.
And for that reason I think we
need to take it to conference to
to
Deal with that minor technical.
If you and if you look at the
amendments and contacts you'll
see that section eleven has not
been changed with them.
Also note that section ten was
completely deleted our.
This.
What the impact of that is Mr
speaker and gentle lady was
section ten.
Martin provision for our
consideration of this
legislation.
Mr speaker and gentleman it was
a provision of of of the bill
that related to.
how one might those guards and
revenues generated from
construction projects.
Mr speaker gentle lady is that
so
I just.
First to what you were trying to
accomplish and visually in this
legislation.
Mr speaker kind gentleman there
are two parts to the legislation
one part of the legislation was
eliminated from this ammendment.
Mr speaker gentle lady my my
question is.
Your recommended us to and for
but if they took that out of it
was an important part maybe we
shouldn't and so I'm trying to
get your opinion as to whether
or not that was significant to
us and whether we ought to.
maybe.
Talk to the Senate about that
change Mrs Mr speaker
kind gentleman the remaining
portion of the bill is critical
to the citizens of the state of
New Mexico it provides relief to
businesses who are suffering now
it's an important remaining
piece of the bill which was sent
from her.
Mr speaker and gentle lady thank
you for that the.
Thank the.
We need to address the failure
to remember sectional Evans.
That's a technical issue but I
think one that has to be done
there but I don't know Mr
speaker how you make little
changes like that I don't think
we can amend this but it needs
to be change.
Those are my only comments Mr
speaker and gentle lady thank
you.
The gentleman from the
Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Well so shields please.
are well known to the kinds of
moments.
Speaker gentle lady
I'm on page twenty six of the.
Of the amended documents to Blue
Ridge document.
Of
supposed to be looking at is as
current information.
At the top of the page twenty
six
strong.
Three years twenty twenty.
Through twenty twenty two.
And inserted twenty twenty and
subsequent years two weeks.
The current.
That.
These applications could be
made.
You the page number I'm trying
to find the.
Mr speaker and gentle lady sent
to top of page twenty six on
this amended document.
Mr speaker gentleman.
I'm referring to the actual
amendment not the amendments and
contacts.
It does extend it does strike
years twenty twenty twenty
twenty two and and does insert
language twenty twenty and
subsequent tax of taxable years
allowing greater flexibility in
terms of the term.
Mr speaker gentle lady doubts
you will close to the full
twelve page twenty six.
With the investments and
contracts thank you for.
It appears as though
applications can be made only
through the air to.
Of twenty twenty one.
Mr speaker kinda long is there a
question.
The question is.
I suppose.
Used to be a bit of a disconnect
there between the house one for
each of the line which
came back from the Senate is
the.
Disconnect appropriate would
would you still with information
and hair.
The.
Funds concurrence.
Mr speaker and gentleman I do
not believe there is a
disconnect.
And yes Mr speaker times a month
I still recommend concurrence.
At one one last question about
to top of page twenty server.
The ability to call text.
For the Senate added language to
prioritize.
Funding.
That have been greatest concern
decline in business replicate.
That is not appear to be to fall
anywhere in the document.
Mr speaker and gentleman on I'm
again wondering what what the
question is.
Education with the Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Absolute definition of whether
that is actually all of you to
climb or percentage decline.
How would the US Senate.
Be appropriated to and the three
to question as to whether with
this information Hey your
recommendations thank you.
Mr speaker in response to those
questions the first is it would
be defined through the agency
and the and in response to the
second question Mr speaker and
kind sentiments I continue to
recommend concurrence.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentlelady from ranch.
Jennifer San Juan Representative
Montoya.
Thank you Mr chairman Mr speaker
doesn't general radio.
Mr speaker and gentleman I thank
you.
And I have a couple of
different
directions to go here
the the question of the change
to include telecommunications.
Companies
is that they can apply for these
funds or is that just
completely.
related to this item it just
allows telecommunication
companies to now be able to
apply for the the funds and I'm
not understanding the addition
of telephone communication in
this.
In this change in the Senate.
Mr speaker some Mr gentleman
from San Juan it did it does not
it's in addition to hi of
infrastructure that may qualify
for legal funding in general it
is not specific Mr speaker and
gentleman to the the provisions
relating to grant programs.
Okay so this was generally this
is just something they wanted to
include for instance are less
than bill.
dealing with telecommunication
companies
and being able to apply for the
the funds that are completely
unrelated to the overall topic
of what this overall bill does
and they would not be able to.
Qualify.
For this particular program this
particular grant that is that
correct.
Mr speaker gentleman any entity
that applies through this
program would have to qualify
for the terms of the programs as
defined in the bill.
Thank you.
Mr speaker generated just it
doesn't appear to me that the
telecommunication companies
would be suffering saying we
other.
Small businesses were believed
to be a target for this.
So a it just seems like this
this was an add on item which is
fine I just didn't understand it
in in the context of.
Of this.
Bill
Mr speaker and gentle lady
Can you explain to me how a
changing the language.
From
the the the the dates it appears
as if as of twenty twenty twenty
twenty two.
Was a sunset kind of written
into this system when you can
apply and now the the sunsets
been taken out or is there a
different way to interpret.
not having the in the state
twenty twenty two.
Miss Mister speaker Tallman I
think that language was added to
allow a certain amount of
flexibility in in terms of the.
Application process and the bill
will will funds to pursuant to
the original provisions of the
act.
So would that be just a sunset
one dollar dollars right now
mmhm the two hundred million
dollars Mr speaker generally.
Mr speaker and gentleman now
there is a date within the app I
just don't have it handy in
front of me and works this
program all terminations.
So I just.
Changing that.
Looking at the date on the news
pending questioning at Mr
speaker and gentle lady and a
different question by removing
of that section ten.
And and the other changes to
this have have
The end has the administration
how how these dollars will be
administered has that changed at
all.
Miss Mister speaker the
internalization
Okay at the same the state
department and the same.
I guess I'm trying to figure out
what flexibility could you could
you describe.
and maybe if you just give me
one example of what you're
talking about the department
have more flexibility for moving
up the
next session yes Mr speaker and
and general fund salmon I would
point to the the fact that we're
now looking at quarterly income
and and the ability to suspend
payment but allow the person to
participate if in the next
quarter after eight qualifying
here that would be an example
using the quarterly.
According as opposed to I think
that had originally been annual.
Okay that's the actually
Mr speaker and deadly Act
actually had me a little bit
more concerned
released with the.
Annual it it showed longer
potentially longer term.
employment rates mmhm right
going to quarterly it seems to
me that committee.
maybe
I used for the sale of it by
applicants for the fund so okay
thank you
Mr speaker and gentle lady I I'm
not sure that I I am like this
before when it went over and I'm
not sure that I like the changes
that have been made and I'm not
sure I I can concur or would
vote and her for this thank you
the speaker down.
Okay there's no further debate
the gentle lady is made a motion
for the house to concurrent
sentiment is yes taxation
revenue committee says to
Prospero eleven as users the
budget yes all those in favor
please signify by saying aye.
Right right.
The house has concurred in
Senate amendments to house
taxation and revenue committee
substitute for House Bill Levin
as omitted with an emergency
clause.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo.
This.
I'm.
The next order of business
third.
Station seeing objection so
ordered.
We'll go to item twelve
gentlelady from Bernalillo
Representative Garrett are you
ready on that item.
Thank you Mr speaker will.
To the point.
I don't action necessary for
placing House Bill twenty two
was amended on final passage has
been taken the gentleman to
explain the bill.
Mr speaker house bill twenty two
as amended corrects issues that
came up as grow your own
teachers act was put into
statute from the two thousand
nineteen legislative session it
okay some language pertaining to
educational assistance from the
early two thousands of.
Expands the eligibility for
those who qualify for your grow
your own teachers that
scholarship when we passed the
bill you had to be qualified as
a U. S. Senate Senate change to
somebody authorized to work in
the state of America excuse me.
I don't know I was I a little
bit like.
Reconfiguring myself on it you
just said is that the amendment
makes that somebody authorized
to work in the state of New
Mexico also and expands from
justice definition of
educational assistant because
districts use different titles
you have to be someone's work
directly with students for two
years it keeps the two years
requirement before you qualify
for the scholarship also because
some people can't qualify for
the scholarship because they're
in and higher income bracket
it allows us with the same
qualifications two years working
in a school those people hadn't
yet of the leading to take their
classes which they have to make
up with comp time they can
qualify for this scholarship
support this recommendation to
take we could finish their
teacher certification program
with that I stand for questions.
The gentleman from
Senegal.
In.
Representative Chatfield
we all.
My colleague
From those seven counties.
Thank you.
Mr speaker this bill would
create the committee are locked
now one of the things we found
in the thirties fall districts
that I Representative is that
When someone.
Would you grow your teachers are
usually from your community
these people are already live
there they often times will
state.
And that is important to me Mr
speaker gentle lady and so with
that I offer an amendment.
Has been passed out and.
Does the two motu number for
your amendment.
Two two zero zero four seven
four one okay.
Zero zero four seven point one
the Germans amendment now the
gentleman to explain it.
Mr speaker gentle lady this
amendment is a very simple and
all it does is
state that the recipient of a
scholarship agrees to work as a
teacher in New Mexico for at
least a number of years school
employee receives a scholarship
the this is and they will keep
these folks here in the state of
the state they bring them to be
able to get that education and
The Kurds the state here.
All.
With that Mr speaker I'll score
then the number one to house
bill twenty two.
I will go first is this a
friendly amendment.
Mr speaker I appreciate the and
can't but no it is not a
friendly amendment.
She's only talking about the
amendment not about you.
Mr Chairman I I love my
colleague from counties.
The gentleman from Diana and
Tero Representative Madrid.
You Mr debate amendment.
And maybe that was a mistake
the gentleman San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr chairman
I actually think the amendment
math and actually Mr speaker
will the gentleman from coal
factual.
Thank you.
Mr speaker and gentleman I do
believe of the amendment
actually goes to the heart of
the purpose.
Of the.
of Bill Senator thank if the
entitlements and to grow our own
futures.
And
I I do believe that it's not
unreasonable request just for
the number of years the
scholarship is accepted.
that
that the recipient investors
stay here an industry that that.
Just a one for one year I
actually think that is a
probably I think that's the
intent.
Of the.
Our regional installations is so
that.
We're investing where we need
teachers are we spending we have
a shortage of teachers on so
and with that it's really not a
question Mr speaker really more
of a.
Just a.
The tension in the body I think
this is this one deserves
support
just just make sure that the
investment by all of the
taxpayers of New Mexico at least
get that thank you for your
return on investment so thank
you Mr speaker thank them you
thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentleman what I wholeheartedly
agree I think these teachers are
brought up out of our community
they are very I used to the
festival culture in our
community they have family ties
in the community and they are
much more likely to stay and we
want to make that the.
Or F. or if we invest that money
in on they would stay in New
Mexico and we would brief
benefit.
Mr chairman for granted although
and Sierra.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
gentleman from all County field.
are you.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
the gentleman for all those
counties of you know we sat on
the Education Committee together
and your bill after bill after
bill with requesting
scholarships and many of those
of the some of the now like the
the medical scholarships require
any times third every year or.
Some sort of equivalent to the
benefit of what they're
receiving from the state and Mr
speaker and gentleman that makes
a lot of sense to me because we
have to ask ourselves first are
we trying to increase their
graduation rates are you trying
to field a high demand jobs are
we trying to
field position specifically in
New Mexico where we have the Mr
speaker and gentleman I think
your bill's speech that.
Years proposed amendments.
Thank you Mr speaker.
I agree I I think that the this
bill those very much that in two
years.
The state of New Mexico so that
we can read the budget we have
invested and I think most of the
ones with the very best
community purges people that
helped me to get this thing here
to be the one to apply for the
scholarship.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
the gentleman from all those
counties I definitely agree with
you and I you know it's it's a
high demand jobs that we need
these people have had on the job
training as they pursue their
degrees the ready because the
ground running and those the
types of folks who want to keep
in the state and even you know
in some of our scholarship
opportunities dollars to four
hundred funds all the others
that don't have the you know
here the we're not restricting
it to high demand jobs and we
don't require them to stay in
the state after we pay for their
degree and I think you know
we're seeing maybe we're not
getting a rate of return.
At that we should and in this
time.
We should be is intentional.
As we can with our investments I
thank you for a minute think it
accomplishes that thank you Mr
speaker thank you.
The gentleman from Lee
Representative Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker one hundred
and one for all
of these.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
For
additional rules placed on the
scholarships.
You're a fan sure.
Mr speaker John Miller are not.
Mr speaker and gentleman there
would be.
Absolutely no restrictions or
person accepting this
scholarship.
Awarded a teaching degree after
several years of support.
And at that point.
Leaving for greener pastures.
Mr chairman that's your.
Mr speaker chairman for all
those counties.
Greener pastures in the
immediate neighborhood of your
community.
The gentleman that.
Mr speaker and gentleman what
that people because of high
rates in the morning states
might be somewhat different
close to four but futures in New
Mexico.
You know what I'm not sure the
exact the region are joining
States with us soon that would
be possible.
Mr speaker gentle and procedures
leaving.
Arsenal preschool straight for.
Texas
To please attach so.
This this ammendment I just
moved.
Pretty.
tools folks that are the
recipients of the scholarship
money this.
Mexico.
Here's to diversity scholarship.
Thank you Mr.
Mr speaker and gentleman all
will be.
To support her with that are you
Mr leader gentleman thank you.
Representative Garrett.
Thank you Mr speaker
will the gentleman yield.
Thank you are you.
Thank you gentlemen I would like
to clarify some points that
people are overlooking first of
all to even be considered for
the scholarship you have already
had to invest two years serving.
I like other scholarships where
you get the scholarship this
scholarship requires you to be
working as in in this category
the entire time that you're
receiving that it's not
something that you get some
money and you go off and get
your education you're working
the entire time I also want to
add I checked with PED the
average salary currently for an
easy position in the state for a
year is under twenty thousand
dollars and eighteen thousand
and three hundred dollars.
And investment in our people who
are already working at low wage
hard working jobs there
investing our children again for
two years already before they do
this I want to point out on I
have two expert witnesses to
remind me of some of the reasons
why we made this scholarship
program and that would be Rachel
gradual and Chelsea a cat and a
from L. E. S. C. and.
Tier one risk if you currently
into a repayment scheme it
becomes more of like a teacher
loan with no mechanism to
collect the money if someone
were to go out of state after
investing this time the current
rate the current you all right
for programs that have done that
according to the higher
education data is that between a
fiscal year nine in fiscal year
nineteen sixty seven percent of
the teacher loan service
requests for in the fall and so
that is one of the reasons why
this is a scholarship I'm not
alone with the requirement to
repay that time again.
Our educational assistance
primarily come from the
communities in New Mexico where
they live and this is an
investment in them the entire
time that they're receiving the
scholarship they're investing in
our children they're investing
in our local schools thank you
very much for yielding to
maintain Representative kind
gentleman.
Mr speaker.
The general this further debate
the gentleman from Lee
Representative.
Mr speaker.
The current from all those
caring to.
Speaker I yield.
Thank you Sir
I for one stand in in support of
your amendment.
And in the business for a we do
this often.
We hire a team member.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
As as they progress within our
company they may they may want
to pursue the various of for a
certification of some for.
And with respect to that.
We offer the
Payments for that we and and and
pay for those services with
respect to that we asked them to
stay for a certain amount of
time.
Should those people choose not
to do that Mr speaker and
gentleman we then pro rate that
expense back to them because
they have a completed that for
Bussmann.
This us for one support this I
think it's a great idea in a way
that we want to continue Mr
speaker and gentleman to ensure.
The the the people that we
invest and invest back into our
state so with that Mr speaker
and gentleman I just want to say
the last for your amendment I
think thanks for thank you.
I feel that.
Is there for the amendment.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo.
Okay just give us one second
we'll put that up.
But yes the amendment will be

Gentleman you maintain for.
Thank you very.
Thank earlier we see a lot of
bills through education this for
really is one of my favorite is
not only allows you to the
system go ahead and get thirty
three but it also allows other
employees with more to move
forward with their deep these
are people that normally stay in
our community and that's what we
need in New Mexico so with that
I yield my time.
We have the gentle lady from Rio
Arriba Santa Fe and Taos.
Mr speaker will the gentle lady
yield.
The gentle lady from.
thank you kind lady how many
teachers a how many teachers are
we short now on in New Mexico
how many many substitutes to we
have working on full time in New
Mexico schools at this time.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
the last I checked it was over
seven hundred and with COVID I
know that at one of my local
middle school the principal told
me last week that she has a
twelve month through the.
Mr speaker and kind lady
This is been a almost a a
perennial problem in this state
I know three years ago was over
seven hundred now when I first
came to the legislature and I
remember a working with you on
this bill and at first it was
going to be an endowed
scholarship we're going to pay
it back and I said I remember us
having a conversation I think
you know aids can't afford
another loan they they just need
if we can help them we are just
give them of this get did you
come to that conclusion to kind
lady.
Mr speaker and kind lady yes I.
based on their income levels as
well as the two the statistics
from higher education department
which indicated that passed our
teacher loan for service had
such a high default rate which
is explained with sixty seven
percent over a ten year period.
Mr speaker kind lady
you know I'm before I I started
my job as a legislator I used to
go to my school twice a week and
work with that of the teachers I
told mom I was a teacher slave
and I I would just help them do
anything they need and and and
you know I I work there because
my grandkids were there any work
there because our classes were
crowded and and and I can tell
they all needed help and
community I ended up reading
with all the kids that was my
best skill and I was able to do
that
I also notice that there were
several aids there that we're so
good with kids you could tell
they had a lot of kids in the
record with them and and they
were talented people they just
never had an opportunity for to
to go on to higher education
which you say that's how how
your schools were Matt and I
kindly.
Mr speaker and kind lady yes
thank you and I can't say
enough.
Or the way they are very is
whether it's called an
instructional aide.
Occasional assistant the
investment of hard many of them
are neighbors of the kids that
they're working with they know
our school students they know
their families they come from
the grassroots that's what makes
them such a powerful country.
Powerful resource for teacher
pipeline and I I do want to add
I got an update from my expert
witness of the statistics
there is five hundred seventy
one current vacancies according
to the story point and there's
four hundred and forty eight
long term stops according to PED
so that's basically over a
thousand vacancies.
so Mister speaker and and kind
lady so it's it's really a lot
worse than than it was three
years ago COVID has really
exacerbated the problem
I also know kind lady that and
in my small town the states also
noted churches together with
these kids there at all the
basketball games with these kids
they're they're an essential
part of the community and I know
that I know that when we a study
educational issues supplemental
Fundacion I'm we we noted that
it takes the whole school
community to make a child's
experience exceptional it's the
best driver the it's the
cafeteria women it's the janitor
it's a it's a everybody the
teacher aides it's a everybody
in the whole environment it
makes that learning experience
eligible for a child is that not
true I'm waiting.
Hi my that's true and I think
that's one reason at my former
elementary school we had for
teachers that were former
teacher aides and while I was
there to of our educational
systems became certified
teachers they were terrific they
know what they were getting into
they chose to be a certified
educator on the foundation of
experiencing you know the good
the bad and the ugly of what
teaching involves the new what
they were getting into they were
committed and that's what has
made them such fine educators in
my opinion.
Mr speaker kind lady thank you
for that answer and as I recall
and then and when you first
introduced as legislation you
really didn't have an
appropriation support and then
you went out it was it was
extraordinary you went out to
the members of the house and you
raise money from there capital
outlay to help fund this program
is that is that is am I correct
in that and that memory kindly.
Yes Mr chairman kind lady the
original appropriation came from
our junior funding.
Well Mr speaker and kind lady
I'm I very much appreciate you
bringing this bill before the
house and I certainly intend to
support and I hope others to to
thank you and I yield back.
Generated from captions coral
influencia Representative
Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
kind lady yield yes I yield to
the kind lady from the three
counties.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady I just want to show my
support for your legislation I
also want to bring to attention
to the members of the body that
what happens in rural New
Mexico.
What happens there is the school
board members children grow up
to become teachers they grow up
to become to come back to the
community that they want to
serve unfortunately they cannot
be hired because.
There.
Mother father there's a
description in their work are on
the school board.
And so that's the next piece of
legislation that I would love to
work with you on so that all
people in New Mexico
are allowed to be able to apply
for this type of scholars and
the state where they grew up
come back to where they grew up
and served there there rural New
Mexico communities thank you Mr
speaker and timely.
Mr speaker and highlighting you
gotta deal.
The gentleman from Chavis added
on here Representative Townsend.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady yield.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
kind gentleman.
Thank you.
I just sitting here listening to
the debate and.
One of the things that you say
well it goes is.
Is that.
And correct me if I'm wrong
there is a process
Currently.
That had a sixty six percent
failure rate
I think Candace Hammond St
waited that those students
painters moved off for can you
explain that to me a little bit
I want to make sure that this
doesn't happen again.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
This is a document that came
from with when the bill was
originally presented it started
out as a teacher loan I
potentially higher education
department the Senate education
just tell the bill and the
higher education department ask
them because they said that in
the in other programs where with
the right payment scheme where
if you did not put your time in
you had to pay for it.
The default rate for the program
The issue data indicated an
average default rate of sixty
seven percent or teacher loan
for service requests and that
was from the fiscal year nine to
fiscal year nineteen and so that
called into question that kind
of a program as an effective
recruitment and retention
But let me read my expert
witness has given me some this
is from my expert witness Rachel
gradual a sixty six percent did
not meet their service
requirements pursuant to the
service requirements in the law
where the loan for service
programs meaning that sixty six
percent of the Paul had to repay
their loans financially speaking
and we feel that in the income
category of people in the grow
your own teacher scholarship
program that that would be a
harsh kind of situation
especially when you realize that
they serve for two years to even
qualify for the scholarship and
that they're working full time
while they're the recipients of
the scholarship I hope that
explain your question.
Yes Mr speaker and gentle lady
that that was.
That was better
I.
Processes within your
legislation that you know it's
not just a one semester of.
Process and then thanks payments
Will be involved in it for more
than that is is there a a
process where they're held
accountable as they go through
the you know semester by
semester or is it a grant and
they can get multiple requests
for the same semester and never
completed I mean how does that
work.
Right.
Thank you Mr speaker kind
Kelemen.
All right here that are semester
by semester the the first
graduate by the way I believe
came from Alamogordo and I
believe that she actually
finished are hurt certification
in just one semester so you
scholarship the scholarship is
for each semester semester by
semester of someone stop
teaching they would not continue
to get a scholarship and anyway.
Then they are they are they can
and up front how does that work.
Mr chairman and kind gentlemen
it I believe it goes directly to
the school all.
K..
excuse me through the financial
aid system they don't get the
money personally.
I appreciate it the gentle lady
Mr speaker thank you both.
And then the gentleman from
civil and McKinley
Representative Alcon.
Thank you Mr speaker of the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
yield.
Mr Chairman yes Mr speaker I
yield to the kind gentleman.
Thank you gentle lady
Areas because I know this is
public schools I'm just
wondering why we would not
include the teachers or a.
As a student people origin head
start.
Especially with the shortage in
the early childhood programs in
the schools are in star gingers
in state in New Mexico could
definitely use a boost here.
Mr speaker and kind gentleman
currently the early childhood
education and care department
has at nine point five million
dollars for scholarships and
extended rate but the purpose of
this bill is that they have to
work in a public school.
to get the grow your own
scholarship.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady I just it was just say no
we were looking for a source for
teachers the head start program
would probably be a really great
place to look for or teachers
and they are trading and they're
ready to go into this field the
only problem is I think a lot of
things I want to do the
education and the without any
kind of financial aid.
So that thank you I yield thank
you madam speaker and gentle
lady.
Gentle lady to close.

We've seen a similar pair Bill

bill seven and both of these are
very simple and straightforward

SB ten as a man as amended.
I think it used to the echo.
Second.
It on the house floor Mr
speaker.
Mr speaker starting or.
Good morning.
Chamber I'm here today to
present SB ten.
Which repeals sections thirty
dash I dash what.
The thirty dash five dash three.
Which provide definitions
exemptions and criminal
penalties for certain questions.
Mr speaker and body.
These dangerous and outdated
statutes.
Our first passed into law in
nineteen sixty nine.
Fifty years later.
As bodies like ours
intentionally pass
unconstitutional abortion bans
to keep women and pregnant
people from the health care they
may need.
It is a real expectation that
roe V. Wade will be repealed
there under my the Supreme Court
of the United States.
Mr speaker embody that were to
happen.
These dangerous nineteen sixty
nine statutes would again become
enforceable New Mexico.
Mr speaker I'm proud to be
presenting this bill produced by
the Senate with Linda Lopez.
And the Senate Majority Leader
Peter Wirth.
As well as twenty three other
senators.
We signed on to this important
legislation.
Mr speaker chamber.
I'm proud to be a co sponsor
alongside our house speaker
Brian Egolf.
Representative John Ferrary
representative Debbie Armstrong
and Representative virgin blue.
I stand in front of you today.
Because I understand that all of
our families deserve access to a
full range of health care we may
need in our lives.
I stand before you today as a
person of faith.
As a mama as a New Mexicans.
And someone that knows every
pregnancy is different.
We can never stand in another
person's shoes.
And certainly.
Government has no place in these
complex decisions.
Mr speaker body I know that we
can each hold our own personal
beliefs.
About abortion and still
fundamentally.
New Mexicans to make these
private decisions for
themselves.
Mr speaker I'd like to yield my
co sponsors.
To get us started this morning
of course I'd like to yield
Representative Joe land Ferrary
a champion in her own right
instead with women and families
The New Mexico for years.
Thank you Mr speaker and
Representative more I'm honored
to have been one of the original
Sanchez to repeal this
antiquated section of statutes
are Mexico's flux the sections
of law is respect the women of
New Mexico as well as endanger
their health and safety of their
health care providers.
with this final passage through
the house of many of the Senate
Bill can and after many years of
hard earned support and advocacy
I majority of women and men of
our state we will finally
realize the continued safe and
legal access for full
reproductive health care should
the protections of roe V. Wade
fall or be changed.
We won't go back to the days
when I was a teenager and women
had to take their chances with
unsafe conditions and untrained
abortion providers many lost
their lives or suffered
permanent injury such as
infertility.
This bill despite all the
harmful and disrespectful
misinformation that was created
to excite the opposition will
keep abortion safe and legal not
the same as it has been for
almost fifty years in New Mexico
since roe V. Wade Supreme Court
decision.
Today we will celebrate a long
hard fought battle for something
that should be a normal part of
women's full here healthcare
options and should not be a
threat to their safety or that
of their willing health care
provider we will go back.
Thank you Mr speaker.
And gentle lady from Dona Ana.
Thank you gentlelady from
Bernalillo.
Marks Mr speaker might I yield
to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
Armstrong.
Leo.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady and thank you for
being a co sponsor on this
important legislation.
And.
I would like to emphasize
because I to remember the times
before roe V. Wade.
When it was very difficult for
women to get an abortion that
was safe.
And.
It is now a well established.
Medical procedure.
Completely safe.
And.
By making it potentially going
back.
To this antiquated nineteen
sixty nine law.
Would criminalize providers for
providing a safe medical
procedure that they've been
providing for fifty years and
put women.
At risk.
and in back alleys again this is
imperative that we get those off
the books so that if anything in
the Supreme Court on the rise
Robi way that there isn't any
doubt that we are not going back
to a nineteen sixty nine
antiquated law.
That criminalizes providers
forgiving well established safe
health care to women.
Thank you Mr speaker and I yield
back to my
to the gentle lady.
The gentle lady from Bernalillo.
Alex the yield to the gentle
lady from Bernalillo
Representative Georgene Louis.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlelady from Dona Ana.
I am a mother and a grandmother
of a.
Some great can I I'm a co
sponsor because we need to
ensure.
That we continue to trust women
to make their own health care
decisions dealing with their
bodies.
As mentioned before abortions
are health care.
I want to go back to a time when
we let government get involved
in women's health care decisions
because I can tell you what
happened in the past.
just as recently as the nineteen
seventies.
Which was also termed a modern
form of genocide.
Due to sterilization.
So native Americans were
subjected to procedures that
were performed under duress or
pressure or without a women's
knowledge or understanding.
Of course this was also easy due
to language barriers.
There were also subsidized early
stations for patients who
receive their health care
through the Indian health
service and for Medicaid
patients.
and black and Latina women were
also targets of these courses
sterilizations during these
years.
No pregnancy is the same there
are always differing
circumstances including health
situations that women are
subject to
we do need to ensure that we
continue to trust women.
To make these decisions with
their families their healthcare
providers and their pay.
It's time to repeal this
antiquated laws.
And women in New Mexico
especially indigenous women.
I'm long held had their health
care decisions taken away from
them.
I'm very proud to sponsor.
House Bill tend to ensure that
future generations of New
Mexicans can retain their body
economy.
And shape their futures for
themselves thank you gentle lady
and thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
Mr speaker with that.
Would you like to be ready for
the debate ahead.
First we're going to generally
from Bernalillo Representative
Chasey.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
lady from turning at a yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the gentle
lady from Bernalillo.
Thank you Mr speaker in the
fading from Diana.
I think that you were quite
clear about your position that.
People can hold their own views
and still respect.
A woman's private decision made
in.
Cooperation with her position
for her spiritual advisers that
right.
And the lady yes that is
correct.
So I'm Mr speaker and lady from
Dundee Anna.
One of the.
Points that I wanted to make is
that.
While we try to respect people
with very different views from
ourselves we can also then.
You are best to trust people to
make their own private medical
decisions.
Right.
Thank the lady absolutely.
Mr speaker and lady from Dona
Ana one of the one of the.
The chest X. I know to be true.
Is is kind of surprising and I
know that people general there
many people who really believe
we should not.
There should not be able arching
because they are morally opposed
to it I I want the body to note
that in countries where abortion
is illegal rates of abortion are
higher.
That in countries where it is
legal.
So sometimes.
In order to make.
A policy that.
Is consistent with one's moral
beliefs doesn't necessarily
prove to be effective.
In one's overall goal.
Are you aware of that as well Mr
speaker and lady from Diana.
Speaker and gentle yes I am and
I appreciate that we are.
Today as a body contemplating
legislation that the about
maintaining access to care for
New Mexicans that may need to.
That's correct.
So
what they want to point out your
Is the number of health care
providers who are in support of.
Senate bill ten and if I left
anyone out please
Let me
The correct that.
We have the item number
of medical groups is that right
the American medical
association.
The American college of
obstetrics and gynecologist for
example.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
you are correct we are proud to
have.
The clear and fundamental
support of New Mexicos our
medical associations including
the medical society.
Madam Mr speaker and gentle lady
from Bernalillo as we've heard
through the committee process.
Medical providers understands is
fundamentally.
That the repeal of these
dangerous statutes is about
ensuring they have room to
provide the kind of care that
New Mexicans is there every day.
Mr speaker lady from during the
pandemic these these medical
professionals from the New
Mexico Medical Society the New
Mexico Academy of Family
positions Mexico Public Health
Association realized the doctor
should not be held criminally
responsible for for
I
mentioned that health care.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
you're correct what's important
for these associations including
the medical society that they're
members hold a wide spectrum of
beliefs and values about
abortion.
But trusted each of our
providers.
In their own faith no and their
own conscience will show up and
do their job and get New
Mexicans the health care they
deserve in a way that feels
appropriate to them and their
content.
Mr speaker and lady from January
of this one thing that I really
want to make we are and that is
that we did hear from a number
of people in support and in
opposition to this this bill the
those who were in opposition to
the bill sent to.
Expressed a view that their
numbers were greater.
Senator those who were in
support of the legislation and I
just want to point out that
three quarters of rural New
Mexico agree that.
They can hold their own moral
views about abortion and still
trust a woman and her family.
To make decisions about abortion
for themselves.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes.
What we've heard over many years
and certainly in the debate
leading up to where we stand
today on the house floor New
Mexicans from across our state
for more rural and frontier
communities from our big cities
New Mexicans of thank New
Mexican communities of color
indigenous New Mexicans about
the Mexican Chicano New Mexicans
like myself.
I have made their values very
clear and certainly Mr speaker
and gentle lady your point is
well taken.
These New Mexicans.
They know that we each had and
will hold our own moral beliefs
about abortion I'm still trying
to make this decision for
themselves.
And they're provided with their
providers of course to.
So thank you Mr speaker and lady
from John Adams I thank you and
all of the co sponsors of this
legislation because I believe
what you have are are doing is
trying to make
Trying to get rid of
literalmente and interpreted
statues and make health care
safer in New Mexico or for all
women thank you very much Mr
speaker and lady from down
under.
Thank you
further debate the gentleman
from San Juan Representative
lane.
Thank you Mr speaker the gentle
lady from dawn on annual.
Mr speaker yes I yield to the
gentleman from San Juan.
Mr speaker.
so if I understand correctly.
As it stands in the in two
thousand twenty one.
abortion provider cannot be
currently prosecuted under the
statute is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
That is correct.
Sir can you provide some context
for me as to why we're seeking
to repeal.
and I believe it's three
subsections the pharmacy can
repeal.
Thirty dash I dash one three
dash five dash two and thirty
Dutch I don't read.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes.
As you stated as the ten as
amended.
Repeals sections yes I that's
one.
Thirty five cents to.
And thirty dash five dash three.
For more New Mexico lost.
He's antiquated statutes passed
in nineteen sixty nine.
Fifty years ago.
Our political climate was
different.
Our families are different.
And as it stands to me.
The danger statutes were passed.
Thank you women from accessing
the abortion care they may need
in their lives.
Since the roe V. Wade decision
in nineteen seventy three.
The statutes of become
unenforceable.
What we know today.
That taking these dangers such
as of the book.
We can make sure to maintain.
Access to safe and legal
abortion as here.
That we sent in our state may
need.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Now you you said that you are
striking all three of the that
correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes.
If the idea is to if I
understood the rationale.
And the on a proper you'll
correct me if I'm wrong but it's
understood facilities rationale.
Is that we want to repeal these
antiquated such for provisions.
And beyond that we want to make
sure that we're providing a
safe.
abortion options for.
Of women that Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Just questions.
I would.
Thank you generate.
So with that then.
can't currently be enforced.
And it's about the health and
safety of.
A woman in New Mexico.
Wire restoration all three of
these provisions Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman these
three sections for past together
in nineteen sixty nine.
Have become holy unenforceable
for almost fifty years.
And in doing a straight repeal
of these dangerous statutes.
We're making sure that the
standard of care that exists
today.
Is not compromised.
In the case of the Supreme Court
of the United States.
Ridicule there under mine the
landmark roe V. Wade decision.
The advanced abortion access in
our country.
Mr speaker.
No the ability center the three
statutes are wholly on forcible.
It seems to me that thirty
thirty yes I have to.
It's not on in forcible and I'm
missing something Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
Of the statutes were passed in
nineteen sixty nine.
A lot of games involve federal
law New Mexico law.
By repealing the state section
of New Mexico Costa.
Right that's I that's one thirty
that I asked to.
And thirty that's I that's
three.
We are not changing the standard
of care in our state.
Are changing the foundation in
which people access abortion.
Mr speaker is thirty to five
dash two hundred portable.
Mr speaker and so then what we
do know is that there are
significant follow state and
federal legal protections making
sure that our providers The New
Mexico have room to decide.
Fitting with their own morals
and conscience conscience
values.
How to practice medicine in New
Mexico.
Mr speaker is there a particular
staff Turner provision of the
gentle lady is representative.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
We have the uniform health care
decision that's.
As well as the medical practice
act.
Mr speaker thank me that.
Thirty dash I dash to in fact
does.
Find projections.
For both hospitals and
healthcare providers.
The dealer to act.
Reference by the gentle lady do
not call for the generator.
Mr speaker and gentleman no.
Mr speaker the gentle lady
finally explain to me how I'm
incorrect.
Mr speaker and gentleman might
you ask your question again.
Mr speaker Representative
probably it's a poorly worded
question to begin with.
So gentle lady it's my opinion
that thirty dash I just you.
Find more conscience protections
for.
Doctors and hospitals.
Than the other two acts that you
reference for example the
uniforms health care decisions I
believe is one of the other ones
referenced.
So why in your opinion.
The thirty dash I dash to not
provide additional perfect
protection this over again your
introduction Representative.
Mr speaker gentleman thirty dash
I dash to is unnecessary because
of the solid.
State and federal legal
protections that come into play
here.
Mr speaker the the gentle lady
reference the unicorn healthcare
decisions act so.
All reference as well.
The general area where those
this section does have.
The ability the ability for
doctors and hospital providers
to of raised conscience object.
Mr speaker and gentleman there
other protections that allow
providers.
The
right kinds of objections.
Now Mr speaker phone the doctor
and I have a conscience
objections to doing abortion.
The uniform health care
decisions that does not require
me to perform the abortion is
that correct utility.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
You would not be required to
perform that it goes against
perform abortions after that was
against your conscience.
Thank you Mr speaker am I
required under this act for for
that patient to another doctor
knowing full well the doctor
will very likely performing
abortions.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
depend.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
When we look at what the text of
the statute sent.
Thank you gentlemen.
So Mister speaker for look at
twenty four seven and us that.
The gentleman let me know when
she's there.
One second Mr speaker something.
So you'd like to look at the
uniformed care decisions act
where I.
That is correct Mr speaker a
twenty four dash seven eight yes
Sir.
Mr speaker and gentleman have
part of the.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady I would probably direct
your attention to legislation
and subsection G. as in Gallup
poll.
Mr speaker yes.
Thank you Mr speaker Sir
subsection.
Right to health care
practitioner healthcare
institution to on.
Criminal structure culture
decision shall all and
infrastructure to provide
continuing education.
Until the transfer and
effective.
So Mister speaker gentle lady.
That reminds.
But on the on and off and I have
the patient come before me.
And the patient dividers to have
an abortion performed I have a
question just objections.
Am I required to continue to
provide medical care for and
tell I can locate another doctor
on the questions.
Mr speaker and gentleman of they
said previously it depends.
Without knowing the cause of
your hypothetical or
speculation.
It would be hard to think.
The speaker.
Do you disagree that the tax
required by the way.
Mr speaker and gentleman I'm not
here today debating uniform
health care this is an act.
But I do understand.
And have seen and have extensive
conversations with providers are
across our state.
They feel confident in the
extensive state and federal
legal protections that existed.
That protect their room to
express conscientious objection
to providing health care in our
state.
That's why we have the full
support of the Medical Society.
As well as other medical groups
across New Mexico.
Thank you Mr speaker thank
answer my question but the fact
that the amount that.
and part of the argument
understood it today in the
presentation.
Is that this bill was all about
the help of the women in Mexico.
But beyond that it doesn't
require doctors to do anything
other.
Of the one thirty doing.
And there are no new
protections.
Being removed from thirty to
five deaths to.
And so Mister speaker.
Gentlelady thirty dash five dash
to require additional providing
is here.
To the patients seeking
abortion.
When the doctor has.
A conscious objection to that
procedure.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
When I repeat your question to
make sure we understood that.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Bill thirty to five dash two
which is one of the provisions
in order to be repealed those
that require Department officer
require me to continue to
provide medical treatment.
To a patient who desires to get
an abortion.
Whenever I have a conscience
objections.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
What we continue to express I'm
here for medical providers
across New Mexico these
provisions are unnecessary.
And are not reflective of the
way that religious refusal.
And medical ethics their
practice today.
That's why.
The ground floor providers
across New Mexico through their
professional association of
students part of house bill
seven and just we had.
Because they are confident.
That across their religious
beliefs and moral views.
And opinions on abortion.
That they will still have room
to meet their professional
standards and provide safe and
legal health care to New
Mexicans.
In a way that reflects their own
ideologies.
Thank you Mr speaker.
So the tax of thirty dash I dash
to require me to provide.
Of on going medical care.
Your patience when I object to
the abortion procedure of the
doctor.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
It does not.
Mr speaker gentle hello hello
and.
Hello.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle
lady.
So there is a material
difference between thirty dash I
dash to.
And for example the informed
health care decisions are.
So did suggest that.
Removing thirty dash I dash two
has no impact on the medical
community that we are Mr speaker
of the state I believe the
shown.
There are very real and tangible
conscience protections and
thirty dash I dash to to does
not exist.
And our other statutory
framework and so I can
understand the the argument
about.
let's protect the females of New
Mexico and if they want to
choose to get abortions I
understand that argument I don't
agree with that but we
understand that and so that
would mean striking thirty dash
five dash three.
What I do not understand is why
we have to strike thirty dash I
dash to.
On it fairly clearly provide
medical protections to New
Mexico doctors.
Eight that is struggling to
attract qualified positions.
And yet we're going to continue
to road.
Does health care conscience
objections from our qualifying
position.
And so I do think there is a
substantive.
Difference between thirty to
provide us to Mr speaker the
gentle lady bird as well.
When she said that no this is
not required to provide ongoing
medical care to a patient who
seeks to obtain abortion from a
doctor to health conscious
objection.
And so.
I think of the state we're
making a huge mistake here
today.
We are not only dealing with and
Schardin with the person that
issue of in the Peterson trial
only or is it is not a trial.
But beyond that.
Debate.
We are impacting physicians who
have no desire to be part of
these types of elective
procedures or even medical
procedures.
So Mister speaker I would just
say I.
I as.
As a person who stands in this
horrible body
I'm I'm nervous for the future
of our state.
I believe that by seven point.
And I think this is going to be
one of the major.
All.
Issues with the hope moving
forward will one day look back
on over some place.
And I believe that was a call
from a thank you Mr speaker
you'll back.
This for the.
And gentleman from Bernalillo
Representative Maestas.
Thank you Mr speaker provided a
million a year.
Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from Bernalillo.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle lady
just want to share a few
thoughts
on this momentous bill and thank
you for caring it here in the
house.
Because if you ask about thirty
people.
You know their opinions on this
matter and to to craft a bill
dealing with that you get thirty
different bills.
You know everyone everyone has
very strong opinions one way or
the other.
And
And
You know it touches everybody in
and out in a very real way so
I'm gonna talk about I talk
about the the antiquated long
waits on constitutional I'll
talk a bit about the policy and
I'll talk a bit about the
politics of because this is this
is about politics
but the the law is
unconstitutional gentleman just
spoke don't San Juan you know
mentioned that point it's
unconstitutional it's in our
criminal code.
Abortion is criminalized today
in the state of Mexico in our
criminal act it is against the
law it is eighteen months in
prison so why has anybody been
arrested wiser but even
prosecuted last year but even
sent to jail or prison Mr
speaker gently from Bernalillo.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
After you pass the dangers to
the nineteen sixty nine the
Supreme Court of the United
States.
If you can the Roby way decision
and that made.
Laws like this across the
country unenforceable.
Thank you Mr speaker gently
component and that's where it's
at I mean this should have been
removed from statute in nineteen
seventy.
Four seventy five during the
next sixty day session Mr been
removed it's it's
unconstitutional we took an
oath.
Right on renters soon but just
as powerful and isn't and is
impactful and is teary eyed when
we take that oath every first in
the sixty day session to follow
the constitution.
To support and defend the
constitution of the United
States and the state of New
Mexico and so to not take it off
the books is contradictory to
the constitution bottom line.
The United States of America.
Believes in.
Individual freedom and
individual choice.
my faith believes in.
That that choice as well.
Of freedom of choice is
fundamental in my face.
Individual individualism and
freedom of individuals is
fundamental in my country.
And so it's it's against the law
that statute is against the law
and we have to be consistent
with along with to remove it
from our criminal code but it's
more to it than that it's more
to it than that but I just want
to make the point Mr speaker
telephone Dona that.
From if and when that is removed
from the criminal code it
doesn't change anything it
doesn't change anything or
anyone's lives or any policy or
any actions or any events in the
state of New Mexico so why all
the hubbub why all the.
The motion and not animosity and
and and attention to something
that is not going to change
policy were merely taking any
legal our criminal act out of
the criminal code just because
because this issue has been
massively politicized in the
last forty years Mr speaker
tonight from dell yeah if you
look at politicians in the
seventies politicians in the in
the early to mid eighties.
You know that the so called pro
choice and pro life of movement
was equal on both parties.
It was equal on both parties and
it was not a partisan thing.
but we've just been driven you
know home election cycle after
election cycle primary after
primary.
you know presidential election
after presidential election are
you pro choice are you pro life.
And it doesn't matter.
There could be fifty or seventy
pro life legislators on this on
this hall seventy pro choice it
doesn't matter it's it's
constitutionally allow.
And so how do we move forward as
a society Mr speaker I do we
move forward
as policy makers to ensure that
we diminish the number of
abortions in our community and
like the gently from Bernalillo
spoke of Mister speaker gentle
lady from Dona Ana.
In in countries where the
policies allow freedom of choice
and freedom of end of individual
acts there is in fact less there
is in fact less use of this
medical procedure it also that's
it's it's just a it's just a
tough one Mr speaker delay but
as want to say that that
that all let other folks talk is
I think the woman wanted talking
deserve to talk more than maybe
we do but this is even more than
a woman's right it's a poor
woman's right.
I believe that will be we will
not be overturned if you're a
conservative judge then you
follow story decisis and you
follow previous president if
you're a radical judge or a law
making jobs and maybe you can
overturn you know forty eight
years of legal precedent.
But
But but but if it were to be
overturned this statute is not
where we would start.
This statute is not with the
conversation in New Mexico even
start it would be the most
radical statute in all fifty
states
it's for it's pretty out there
spree out there so we definitely
need to to remove Mr speaker is
only from really about Dona Ana
the
What my point was is that if if
it was criminalized and if that
wasn't forcible.
Abortion was still have.
Abortions will still happen
similar to the one drugs and
other things you simply can't
regulate something as.
As highly personalized and
sought after and so we know that
women with means
you know could pay whatever I
don't know eight ten thousand
one thousand always have a
procedure done in a very unsafe
place.
And some of those women would
die.
Someone could fly to other
countries fly to other you know
places that's not what we want.
We don't want to go back to
those days.
You know we don't want that's
horrible public policy.
You know they need to be so
they're they're they're legal.
Can change that and we need to
make them rare and make them
safe and make them available for
women of any economic means to
determine their life on this
earth to determine the future of
their family on this or did not
have government officials much
less me determine the outcome of
their life.
If in fact they so choose it's
freedom of choice that's what
this country's all about so
Mister speaker gently for going
on a when you hear of the
tremendous opposition to this
bill that opposition
contradicts.
What the founders talked about.
Don't tread on the government
don't tread on me.
You know this is the ultimate
tread on a human being the
ultimate imposition by
government officials into the
private lives of people.
and we have to and this
partisanship on this issue we
have to accept the constitution
except the laws of this country
and we have to we have to move
forward because dividing us a
lot and it doesn't have to it
doesn't need to because there's
no policy outcome this gonna
happen differently as a result
of that division as every single
act Mr speaker joined from going
on every single political push
creates an equal and opposite
reaction to that bush and so now
this issue has become one of the
most partisan issues in the
country when it never was that.
Never was that has nothing to do
with liberalism or conservatism
in fact if you're truly
conservative you would you would
be supporting this this endeavor
sort of all across the as the
the the zoom Mike Mr speaker
John from gently from going out
I thank you for championing this
and bringing this forward I need
to be removed from the books and
we need to support and respect
women here in New Mexico in this
respect less government and and
not have government officials
like ourselves make these highly
personal and highly individual
choices that people we have to
make from time to time thank you
Mr jelly.
Thank you very much gentleman
there is further debate the
gentle lady from the on the on a
Representative Rubio.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you Representative got enough
for bringing this legislation
forward
I I recognize that it is a heavy
lift considering all of the
things that are represented my
instances had just has just
particular articulately stated.
I think for me it's really
on an important issue and it's
it's always hard to to talk
about it because as as folks
madam and and people will
mention over the course of the
next few hours I'm sure is a lot
of politicized in hiding
alertness around this issue
without recognizing that so many
of these personal and secret
decisions that people make on a
day to day basis are done so
not carelessly but with real
true intention and so
I think part of what's really
grounding the right now.
and by the way hi Representative
I know will you yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the gentle
lady from dynamic County my home
thank you and the lady.
Thank you Representative and
But I think that is the one
thing that I'm really thinking
about in terms of this
conversation today is is just
power how we're grounding on
ourselves in
not just the the technicalities
around what this bill does which
is it it just as I mentioned
We're we're basically repealing
something that is
unconstitutional but it very
much
has so much impact on
the many people especially
around the state of New Mexico
particularly from places where I
grew up in in rural New Mexico
and and now here in southern New
Mexico that
these decisions that are made.
Are done so with a lot of honor
and and sacredness and I just
wanted to to just share how
important that as as for myself
having grown up in rural
community having grown up in a
in a family that didn't have a
ton of money
really searching for
opportunities
and and.
For so many to not have the
ability to actually make
choices
Many that are very much related
to these issues
I think is incredibly.
it's in their stories that I'm
holding really closely to myself
right now because
They are.
The stories in many New Mexicans
and so I just want to thank you
for
bringing this legislation
forward this heavy lift again
and I I yield my time thank you.
Thank you very much the lady
there is further debate the
gentle lady from Eddie
Representative Brown.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Will the gentle lady from Dona
Ana please yield.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from Eddie thank you
very much Sir Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
I have received quite a bit of
feedback from physicians nurses
other people who work in the
healthcare field and they are
very opposed to this bill
because they are convinced that
it will remove the conscious
because because protections they
have under current statutes.
So I just want to get that after
Mr speaker and gentle lady
because
they said that
a lot of them are thinking of
moving if this bill passes they
don't want to live in a state
where they don't feel respected
and valued and that respect goes
to their personal convictions
about the wrongfulness of
abortion.
Mr chair and gentle lady I would
point out that it takes a lot of
time and effort.
And resources to our produce a
doctor or nurse.
And without the
the part of the statute
remaining and that's thirty dash
I dash to.
they feel that their jobs would
be in jeopardy very likely.
They also leave that it would be
Detrimental to the profession in
general.
They they do not believe that
abortion is justified and they
don't want any part of it.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
are you.
I believe that this section of
five five dash two should remain
and
all right I believe it is
indicative of
Where we are now I looked at the
statutes that you cited that you
gentle lady Mr speaker that you
you take the position will
provide protection but the
problem is.
They are not explicit they are
not one point.
And in fact they give very
little guidance at all when it
comes to the committing of
abortion.
So my question Mr speaker gentle
lady is if it would give a great
deal of comfort to New Mexico
doctors and nurses to have
thirty yes I dash to remain on
the books would that not be a
reasonable position and we
certainly don't want to lose
these people to other states.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
I appreciate this point.
I'm really frustrated.
That so many of our credible
frontline nurses and care
workers and providers.
Have been given an accurate and
misleading information.
I do worry Mr speaker and gentle
lady about how that happened.
But I know.
I'm here today to share after an
honest information.
About what.
Is within SB ten and this
important repeal he.
Two years ago.
We heard and considered.
This legislation.
And in a good faith effort of
compromise.
And to provide reassurance.
We made different decisions
related to which provisions
would be repealed.
But Mr speaker gentle lady as a
champion said the Senate have
names and.
We had a chance.
To find a bill that included
that unnecessary.
Reassuring language.
And the Senate passed a bill.
At the Senate acted on that bill
Mr speaker gentle lady.
We would not be here today.
With that Mr speaker gentle
lady.
Again I will share.
The medical associations of New
Mexico.
I stated clearly.
Their support.
SB had.
Again Madam Mr speaker.
On gentle lady.
That's because they understand.
The broad protections that come
from state and federal law.
Thank you gentlelady.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
What was just said does not in
any way indicator refute the of
the emails and the phone calls
and other messages I've received
from medical practitioners
they were not consulted
apparently they know how to read
a statute and they have said
very clearly that they want
thirty dash I dash to to remain
on the books.
So there is a perception
of gentle lady Mr chair Mr
speaker that.
In New Mexico is is winding up
to force people to commit.
An act that they find morally
reprehensible.
And it's not always.
True that you're going to
capture anybody will help help
people wanted Mister chair
Mister speaker gentle lady I do
not have any previous bill in
front of me I am looking at
Senate bill ten on.
And clearly it repeals a section
that many medical practitioners
have said they want to have
stayed there so I think Mr
speaker and gentle lady it would
be wise to heed
their wishes and keep that in
the statute
Mr speaker gentle lady.
One of the other objections that
I've heard is regarding who
would be doing abortions if this
Senate bill ten passes and is
enacted into law so gentle lady
could you tell me where
who can perform abortions if of
this bill passes.
and we Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
As I will say again.
Senate Bill Clinton.
Does not change the standard of
abortion Care New Mexico.
Nor does it change the way
patients may access safe and
legal abortion care they may
need in our state.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
will take issue with some of
what was just said.
Abortion is not safe it may be
legal but it's not safe.
And this enactment of Senate
bill ten would actually open up
the door to other than a
licensed physician doing an
abortion procedure is so with
that Mr speaker and gentle lady
I am going to move house floor
amendment.
Number one to Senate bill ten as
amended.
Thank you the gentle lady well
we.
What first can you go ahead and
please read the two oh two
number for the body to an
awaiting.
Yes Mr speaker the number is
point two one nine nine two one
point one.
It has been distributed on the
website.
The gentle lady to explain the
amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker so house
floor amendment number one.
does basically three of three
things number one is it would
strike all items of Senate floor
amendment number one.
Second we on page one of the
bill.
It would strike points eleven
twelve.
And insert in lieu thereof the
following language.
Relating to abortion.
Requiring that abortions only be
performed by physicians licensed
by the state.
Absolutely Mr speaker and
members.
On page one of the Senate bill
tam.
Winds fifteen through seventeen
we would strike section one in
its entirety and insert instead
the following new sections.
And Mr speaker it's it's a
rather short
It is working so we're going to
do is just read it so if this
amendment is adopted Mr speaker
the statute would read as
follows thirty dash five dash
one definitions as used in
chapter thirty but I NMSA
nineteen seventy eight a
pregnancy means the implantation
of an embryo in the uterus.
The hospital means one licensed
by the Public Health Division of
the department of health and C.
medical termination means the
intentional ending of the
pregnancy of a woman at the
request of the woman Fortive
said woman is under the age of
eighteen years then at the
request of said woman and her
then living parent or guardian
by a physician licensed by the
state using acceptable medical
procedures.
Continuing with what would be of
if you member this is adopted a
section to read as follows it's
thirty dash I dash to.
Persons and institutions exams.
Chapter thirty article five and
of the state nineteen seventy
eight.
Does not require a hospital to
admit any patient for the
purposes of performing an

religious grounds shall not be
required to participate in
medical procedures that will
result in the termination of
pregnancy.
And the refusal of any such
person to participate shall not
form the basis of any
disciplinary or other
Representative Tory action
against the person.
And then finally Mr speaker and
members we did just a few little
work changes on section notice
section three regarding statute
thirty dash five dash three.
Mr speaker I'd be happy to field
questions on the amendment.
The gentleman from.
No and Sandoval Representative
Ely.
Speaker point of order pursuant
to eleven dash one and article
four section fifteen the Mexican
constitution the.
Total of the current mill as
before the body.
Is certain definitions
exemptions and criminal
penalties for certain portions
of this of this bill is to yield
three statutes.
This amendment changes the
purpose of the bill.
As described in the title of the
amendment letting her motion
requiring that abortions.
Performed by physicians licensed
by the state.
Pursuant to eleven dash one no
loss of the passage of five
bills and no bill shall be so
altered or amended on its
passage as to changes regional
purpose the Mexican constitution
confirms that this is not
germane thank you Mr speaker.
Okay.
The.
House parliamentarian has
determined that the amendment is
out of order.
Would you not interrupt me Sir.
Thank you.
I'm real pleased on the
statement and advice from the
parliamentarian this amendment
out of order.
Gentleman from for what purpose
to rise.
to the just prior to this.
Total.
will.
and it was.
At that time
The title of the bill.
so yes
explained that part.
Was held to that same standard
trust.
Just minutes ago so Mister
speaker that
That rural and I ask that the
that the floor and that the
parliamentarian yes consistent
with what happened to run this
for Mr speaker.
State is.
Of the section of the wall and
in the state to abortion this is
just less of of imperial than
previous repeal Mr speaker and I
would ask that we would have a
Council services give us.
Before vote because.
Our.
The.
On this floor and consistency on
this system and I would I would
ask that.
Have a someone from Council
services come on before with the
rest of the day turns out to be
a point of order after point of
order after point of order
people are standing up to ask
for a point of privilege
Mr speaker I'm asking for the
court to the.
Yeah this and if that we get
Representative or Jared or
someone from Council services.
to come down here and tap us
through that because Mr speaker
this is just a.
Just not a functional and it is
still fits with the title.
Hello Mister speaker
and I ask for a ask for that
from I yield to the speaker and
I ask for the
Committee and to see if he is
willing to be consistent with
what happened earlier today on
this for.
Thanks to the and and appeal of
my decision to follow the advice
of the parliamentarian of the
house that is a proper
enquiring.
The second part quest that we
have from Council services come
down here and give us a ruling.
But it is not a that is not a
proper motion and it's been
earlier in this session when you
and leader Townsend
expressed tremendous objection
to having Mr Burciaga be
involved in a matter of policy
actually the committee been in
the.
Special session we had so we're
not gonna do that this is a
decision for the body of council
service is not
does not decide matters of
process and procedure the body
does so we've got the motion a
point four and we will take a
vote.
The speaker.
that is a request not willing Mr
speaker but for.
W. hat because that Mr speaker
is such as for consistently
there is precedent and it sticks
to the title.

improper

the ruling of the chair has been
filled.
Gentle gentle lady from ending
have you maintained for.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and members of the
body and gentle lady from Dona
Ana I'm just going to make a few
comments now and the first I'd
like to make is that.
RT to our state constitution
the subject of every bill should
be clearly expressed in its
title.
Mr speaker and members and
gentle lady Senate bill ten.
Failed to do that in its
introduced important.
It simply says repealing
sections thirty dash I dash one
thirty dash five dash three MSA
nineteen seventy eight.
In was.
Technical information.
So Mister speaker members and
gentle lady the Senate did amend
the bill to actually add the
word abortion.
And the so it added at the end
of what I just said
Which provides definitions
exemptions in criminal penalties
for certain abortions.
Mr speaker and members and
gentle lady.
I I think.
What would have been better
served if it'd been stated right
up front that Senate bill ten
was about abortion.
And so I think we've done a
disservice to New Mexicans by.
Basically hiding that
information from the bill titled
a bill titled those does matter
Mr speaker and gentle lady and
colleagues.
We had a pretty robust debate on
pretty much the same bill in
twenty nineteen.
And it is indeed an issue that
is emotional for both sides.
It is is the issue that will
never go away until there's
justice.
Because I believe not most New
Mexicans when they understand
what abortion involves.
And what it does to a little boy
or girl.
Most of them are going to be
opposed to it because it's
horrific.
Among those one expanding
kitchen and the
her little boy or girl camper
which it was she was busy and
couldn't couldn't log and the
little one said mom can I kill
it.
And how could you possibly
answer that because it mattered
what it is.
Was it a cockroach was it an
aunt.
India scorpion.
Maybe the family pet.
So it does matter what acumen is
directed at and I think most
Mexicans see clearly on that
point.
The problem we have in society
with child abuse I believe Mr
speaker and gentle lady states
to roe versus Wade and versus
Bolton.
Mother Teresa once said
something that I really had to
think about she said that she
would never place a baby for
adoption.
In a home where the mom or dad
have themselves procured an
abortion.
At the time I I heard that I
thought well that's kind of
harsh.
The family is willing to adopt
and mother baby then they should
be allowed to do so.
But she explained her position
this way saying if they would do
that.
By that an abortion a violent
act to a baby in utero.
That you can't trust them with
the baby out of the room.
There are some people Mr speaker
gentle lady you can agree or
disagree with that but I thought
at the time that she was she
speaking from the heart and
speaking from what we know is a
long life of service to others
and always intending to do the
best for children and adults as
well.
The people of New Mexico I think
are against abortion as well
because.
It is hypocritical and it's
contradictory in so many ways.
We have laws on the books that
we cannot so a child.
It would be illegal to do so
Mister speaker gentle lady.
But some people think it's okay
to soul forty parts of these
babies.
And I don't think that sits well
with most people in our state.
I read recently about a woman
who was trying to kind of
decline her Harrell's Mr speaker
gentle lady.
And she went through the usual
usual advice of you know deal
with the clothing and then the
papers and things like that.
And she told the person who was
advising her on how to do this
that she just couldn't get rid
of or stuffed animals that she'd
had since childhood.
And the total about why you
would be so difficult Mr speaker
to get rid of stuffed animals
and the lady realized because
when she looked at them it was
like they were looking back at
her.
So the so the advice given was
put tape over the eyes of the
stuffed animals.
So the baby in utero Mr speaker
or his or her eyes are closed I
believe.
But what we've been doing in New
Mexico and all of the US and
around the world we've been
putting tape over our eyes.
Regarding what we're really
doing this abortion.
Mr speaker we just close with
this that several months ago I
was driving through
another stated was sometime ago
and I was driving through a
window for.
And for miles and miles nothing
that wind turbines.
As I was going through through
that very large when part in the
current to me that these wind
turbines remind me of the little
white crosses.
That pro life people planted in
the ground on the anniversary of
roe versus Wade.
Each cross represents.
Not just one but hundreds if not
thousands of little babies who
died because of abortion.
So Mister speaker gentle lady in
the future whenever I see wind
turbines I'm gonna think of a
little boys and girls.
Who were denied their right to
twice and were denied any
justice at all.
Are you.
Generating and.
For reasons unknown everyone who
who's
to request to speak on the board
Act for some reason has fallen
off however before I the for the
chamber for a minute I wrote
down Senator who were ready to
go so I will now go to.
the gentle lady from yes
Representative Ortez.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
gentle lady from twenty in the
counties yield.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from South.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
and generally Fontana.
I am the mother of two girls I
am at the.
I hope and pray that my
daughters and my niece don't
have to fight for their their
reproductive rights as my mother
has.
As I had to my generation is
finding the right now.
We talk a lot about body
autonomy in my house.
I trust my daughters to make
their own decisions about their
bodies.
Just as I've trusted myself to
make my own decisions about my
own reproductive health.
I believe the abortion care is
health care.
And as a Catholic I believe
along with most Catholics in our
state that you can have a
personal and moral view about
abortion and still believe that
this decision is in the hands of
women and that we should trust
women.
I'm so grateful for the gentle
lady and the other general women
and gentlemen who are sponsoring
this legislation thank you Mr
speaker and gentle lady from
Bernalillo county for protecting
my rights and my daughter's
rights the rights of all women
the state.
I yield.
Thank.
We will go to the gentle lady
from granted this year
Representative Dow.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
traditionally from doing and
would you please you.
The speaker yes I yield to the
gentle lady from grant medical
care counties.
Mr speaker and ventilating and
you know we came in together as
freshmen.
And I was familiar with your
prior working you were familiar
with nine.
And I remember we met together
and said there's going to be a
lot of areas where we.
There's going to be an area
where we disagree strongly and
will probably go head to head.
But when it's over leading
advocates for women and children
in New Mexico.
And Mr speaker and gentle lady I
think we've done a really good
job of that and I want to thank
you for that.
today is the day when we stand
strong disagreement.
I am a person of faith.
And I believe that we are
uniquely and beautifully made
particularly as women with the
legislative recreating life
during women's life within Iraq.
I was nineteen when I
encountered an unexpected
pregnancy.
Unlike some of those boxes okay
favor of.
Work with any access to
abortion.
I was poor.
I had about twenty dollars in
the bank I was seven hundred
fifty miles away from my family.
Being the first in my family to
go to college.
On a scholarship.
When I found out I was pregnant
I was scared.
It was absolutely but safe
definition.
Reasonable and expected that I
would terminate pregnancy.
I was in the state I would
receive an older sound.
I was nine weeks pregnant with
her.
When I went in for rural may
turn on the screen.
I saw and heard of the.
So while people talk about
opinions and people talk about
believe.
I cannot be disputed that a
unique human being with DNA.
With a heart beat.
Her.
And your organs
is inside the developing.
When a heartbeat is detectable
In the first few months of the
pregnancy.
And now with the advances
central versus what.
That PED that human.
A separate life is valuable item
that protective limit twenty
weeks.
This is likely the last abortion
would be stated on this for for
decades for during my first term
of the possibility of being cast
today hoax who wanted to have a
standard of care and folks who
wanted women to have informed
consent and folks who wanted
women to understand what happens
to their bodies for the chose
abortion tried to present bills
but a standard of care in place
in New Mexico those in the first
committee.
Hey we're on the floor debating
in person bill.
That Mr speaker madam chair let
me ask a question.
What feel you have a pen and
fifteen you in this bill and
have eight and one of your
expert witnesses to this
process.
Mr speaker gentle lady might you
repeat that question.
Mr speaker I don't an antibiotic
Evans I debate there's an echo
in the chamber.
Mr speaker gently
let her and then I'll Senator.
Try different.
Mr speaker gentle lady I I use
my microphone and keep my mask
on.
Some of the because of the echo
and I think it is because you're
so close to the speaker so let's
uh suspend the rule for
Representative us that you can
use.
R. for Mike.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
Mexico is.
Assistance of expert testimony
in committees and throughout
this process.
Mr speaker gentle lady I was
proud to have the expertise of
thousands of New Mexicans
shaping part time work to make
sure that we can keep health
care safe and legal New Mexico
Mr speaker gentle lady the state
of New Mexico was part of that
covert and the coalition that's
brought us to today in SB ten.
Thank you
for that.
I would like to go back to the
considerations of.
Senator Browne and your.
That is for reasons of the bills
and in fact include and protect.
Enforceable aspects of the of
the section of the law that
presented the conscious
attention portion of the law and
and for whatever reason instead
of answering her questions in
order to.
To.
Health care providers at there's
no desire to expand access by
changing their ability to object
thank you Mr to pass on it.
And unfortunately due to a call
of the the speaker has.
Incentives.
That we put those protections in
place but what that means that
those protections to be
presented with the intention is
to do so.
Missing from the New Mexico.
Actually other organizations as
well.
K. use website page they're
actually raising funds and
seeking folks to help them with
what they call active
the religious refusals and.
Action that does refusals
at twenty S. is
is.
This is.
Businesses and health care
institutions.
To discuss Senate discriminate.
To provide other services to
based on religious objections
the discrimination takes funds
including around a list
provided hospitals refusing to
provide birth control
sterilization and abortion care
for.
Medication advocacy public
education.
Mexico works to defend its
intention is denied services
because of some.
This is.
This.
To.
To.
Make sure that folks just
objection of conscientious
objection.
To access for women seeking
abortion can that's what they
stated.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
I'm here today to present Senate
bill ten as amended.
So many of us have our own
beliefs and values and work
outside of this chamber that
shows and shape how we exist in
our New Mexico communities every
day.
Okay so you may take a position.
And what the work looks like in
the long run.
What I know today.
Is that the farm healthcare
decision act and the medical
practices act of New Mexico.
As well as federal law.
Certainly protect.
The range of providers to make
their own decisions about the
health care they engage in.
Mexico religious coalition for
reproductive rights.
I have.
Santa Clara convention just
right now just put patients at
risk but I can request to opt
out of providing care for
percentages returns reasons and
I just rentals doesn't include
the right to deny care to
others.
The
change they have.
This is just provisions of
people's health and safety Mr
speaker if this is the second
reference to groups right Mexico
and the Senate support Sanchez.
Act intentions reception
terminal conscientious
objections based on religious
beliefs.
That.
This is Mexico is website asking
people expensed.
This spans including the right
to have access to an abortion
for leverage is.
To.
That.
Asking for people to give funds
to insulate addition Mr speaker.
After this the expert witnesses.
Disincentive to just protections
but it it but there's.
Senator I does to the conditions
As protections in place in New
Mexico's criminal law
passionate.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Whether or not I agree with that
for others in the body hold the
same opinions.
It is real that there are
extensive state and federal
legal protections.
That allowed provider to make
their phone conscientious
decisions about the health care
they engage in.
To.
For small cross sections of the
dash one.
Of the destiny our.
The.
This
asking for the.
Changes in the future.
This is about what I believe to
be the case about conscience
protections.
This section of the law and
criminal sanctions to prevent
portion based on religious
beliefs and conscience
objections.
Speaker.
The contradiction of.
Asking for the echo two bills to
sections of law.
To.
Plans that can protect people
exactly.
For section.
Point one thirty point five dash
three.
Mr speaker gentle lady repeal of
thirty eight yes I yes one two
and three.
Our import holding access to
healthcare The New Mexicans may
need in their life.
Facilities in individuals.
Yes.
Mexico religious advocates for
religious whatever the name of
the grant funds has given
filing litigation against those
providers in our state.
Speaker gentle lady able to
speculate as to what might come
but I know it's on the books
today.
And in turn I know that we are
ready and need to repeal these
three sections of New Mexico's
criminal code to make sure we
never go back to the day for
these dangerous statutes are
forcible New Mexico.
Mr speaker.
Transaction as to what could
happen in the future section
thirty dash I dash one thirty
dash five dash three the excuse
to speculate what could happen
to protect people could occur in
the future thirty dash I dash
to.
Mr speaker gentle lady as
professional associations and
others all across our state
including our incredible
provider groups have looked
closely at this legislation
again they stand in support of
SB ten as amended because they
know that the other tenants
involved in Mexico and federal
law for the protection they need
to safely do their jobs.
Yes.
Is to accept the standard of
care can.
Established rules rhetoric
regulations for New Mexicans
establish care for questions.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
That's not within the purview of
this legislation but if you
might want to ask a question a
different way.
Generating national.
Mexico has a standard of care in
regards to abortion and the
protection of women's health
during active an abortion.
This bill would not change that
so that protected for women in
New Mexico.
Mr speaker gentle lady like all
health care New Mexico of
portion as regulations and
standards of care that come from
their professional associations
like the American college of
obstetricians and gynecologists
and follow medical ethics in
line with the American medical
association and other bodies.
So Mister speaker gentle lady
it's not.
It's not part of the legislation
to discuss alter or amend with
that standard of care in New
Mexico is.
Representative Rehm tradition
the state does not consider.
To.
Interventions and use that would
not pay for.
Mr speaker.
How dangerous late term
abortions are for women.
Mr speaker gentle lady that's
not within the purview of this
legislation again SB ten does
not change the way patients may
access safe and legal abortion
care New Mexico as it's been
stated early earlier Mr speaker
gentle lady.
SB ten does not change much it
just make sure these dangerous
statutes are never enforceable
in our state again.
It doesn't.
That happens with standard of
care for women in New Mexico
when they're seeking an
abortion.
This bill.
Yes
yes.
Does.
Shin.
That performance based
versions of the disk.
For.
Expansion.
Supervision of kick from the
hospital care is the procedure
occurs.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm not
quite following the example
you've given but I do know that
we are being really
straightforward and transparent
about just be ten and what this
legislation entailed.
Mr speaker.
Mexico
is.
This missions percent per week.
Yes of course a portion of the
standard of care according to
the American college of
engineering and as an American
medical association says the
or hospitals.
Is that.
Mexico clean and the standard of
care no question is that is
true.
Mr speaker gentle lady I don't
have an answer for you today
again SB ten is about repealing
three antiquated statutes again
the standard of care is that
level of care and attention
required of doctors and
providers in our state and is
established on a case by case
basis.
Mr speaker and gentle lady but
during a testimony in addition
to the Spanish in the public
that that senator Kennedy
senator that these abortions
would be sent to the commission
considered.
The questions I.
Mr speaker gentle lady I'm not
sure where you're going with
this but again I'm here to
debate just be ten this repeal
in front of us.
If that isn't on the table and
chair of the New Mexico received
estimated can.
By national standards.
Mexico so Mr speaker and gentle
lady dismemberment abortion.
It's very important that the the
one I see is twenty I can.
Portions of the food is.
This section is current.
D. as in the two.
Can.
And that she does not have to.
Mexico.
I was looking inside the the
pharmacies types of things
listing twenty cents.
And then Senator for these
women.
They had to be rushed by
ambulance to a hospital as the
standard of economic issues
which I cannot find that the
existence of code
those inducted and dismemberment
abortions are being fund.
Twenty.
Mr speaker.
That means the Senate of Canada
in reference to opening
statement was in place for
current.
Mr speaker gentle lady might you
prepare for your question.
Sure this pattern.
Mexico has in place as tentative
care that ensures the New Mexico
women have safe abortions that
according to the national
guidance from over two million
association medical association.
I suggest or the standard of
care dates that danced into
current.
Abortions are performed at a
hospital for care for the safety
of the woman does your bill sure
that that happens usage of the
Russians Senator thanks.
Mr speaker gentle lady I am not
here to discuss specific medical
procedures again just be ten
million three sections of law
from New Mexico's criminal code.
Because in nineteen sixty nine a
body like our.
Did everything they could to
keep New Mexicans from the
access to health care they may
need.
Version version is identical
procedure you're.
Medical procedures and that is
that we have access to safe
abortion is as opposed to
Senator
To.
Federal constitutional as
determined as ever since.
And then pass.
Mr speaker.
Questions regarding the solution
that does all.
Takes way to creating.
Thanks.
Conscience protection that's
been questioned yes.
The statement Mr speaker gentle
lady in addition to the standard
of care and it stands Quinn will
continue Mexico I question the
status quo is a Representative
can.
Mr speaker.
Processors as this present for
the that isn't that taxed and
potassium to from induced
intervention.
Mr speaker.
With the status quo of the.
It's time.
To the Jackson Tennessee.
To checked into the heart of the
child to start use abortion.
Mr speaker gentle lady that is
not within the purview of this
legislation again SB ten is
repealing danger statutes from
nineteen sixty nine.
Make certain types of abortion.
Mr speaker.
Conservation.
Mr speaker gentle lady SP ten
removes danger statutes from New
Mexico's criminal code that were
designed to.
May on a felony charges I'm
providers.
We're part of getting New
Mexicans health care they needed
and potentially criminalizing
patients that's what SB ten is
about making sure these
dangerous statute never become
enforceable in our state again.
The restriction which on
sensible is the conscience
protections of of the physicians
health care providers and
facilities that do not wish to
perform Mexico does.
Session after twenty six weeks
of abortion is legal in New
Mexico Mr speaker and generating
the conscience objections
discussed the sentiments and
sentiment because other groups
there sign on sponsors of your
Mr speaker.
It actually criminalize someone
who opposes.
Jackson Tennessee into the heart
of the bill to start step that
hoping.
The labor the first to December
from experiences to earth Mr
speaker.
Mexico is responsible that they
intend to criminalize
abortions consider has rights
to.
After the winter of twenty six
of six a pregnancy.
As for the reasons that I just
spent.
Mr speaker system that section
dash that does to protect folks.
For instance that New Mexico
intends to bring it is not
necessary to preserve.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
I still believe.
That holding on to that
particular section thirty dash I
dash to is not necessary.
I've had extensive conversations
with provider groups across New
Mexico to stand with that
assertion as well as an
advocate.
our our legal allies and
scholars who all.
Have would create this issue and
determines that we have
protections expansive
protections and the uniform
health care decision act and the
medical practices are.
That is the groups like the
medical society of New Mexico.
Stand in support of SB ten.
The.
Roenick that later today we are
going to debate.
Whether percent for someone is
terminal has the right to the to
to stop they're hoping to live.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
There's an extensive amount of
time until dedicated to
conscious per protections and
rights to refuse for medical
providers Mr speaker generated.
This is not necessary.
Mr speaker gentle lady we've had
extensive conversations about
this important point and again I
still feel that it's unnecessary
to retain thirty dash I dash to
hear in a widely supported in
that assertion and yes look
forward to debate around the
other ways we're we're making
sure we have the right we
assurances to move new and
innovative legislation forward
in New Mexico.
That is why.
Of things that we have in this
band and I have voted for its
contraceptive
sterilization.
The secretary is hysterectomies
I think
Mexico is one of the states that
provides.
Access birth control.
So as a way to prevent pregnancy
for best education programs in
our schools and universities and
Mr speaker gentle lady we still
continue to be one of the
highest.
The states with the highest
number performed abortions
performed Mr speaker.
The ability to present today to
the third trimester Mr speaker.
Representative.
Yes Representative.
from.
At.
Spence was.
Mr speaker.
Twenty nineteen when I
introduced a bill before one of
your customers Representative.
Yes.
After the testimony of health
care providers content what
manta does valuable for the
babies.
To the portion.
This is the.
The first to do that she said to
object does not provide access
to health care Mr speaker
generating.
Five hundred is yes.
That it is important that we
protect folks.
Mr speaker.
Junction to preserve the
conscience protection plans.
Mr speaker gentle lady what I
can state is again we have
expensive protections in state
and federal law.
That make sure here providers in
our state have room to express
themselves and their own morally
and religiously held beliefs
when it comes to the provision
of healthcare.
Another question thank you Mr
speaker thank you generating
just as waiting for as an
amendment to arrive.
Thank you Mr speaker generating.
And I have the ultrasound and I
spent my childhood dream.

Our time here you.
Mr speaker and gentle lady with
the settlement does is it right
thank.
Change.
That the Senate made then and it
it and senator.
It keeps section one.
Thank section one sorry when is
the criminalization of abortion
strike section one which would
protect.
from formalising abortion if
there's a change in reverses
weighed it states section two
matches the conscience clause
which our facilities health care
providers and doctors are asking
for.
And section during.
Does section nine site section
three because this is about a
standard of care section.
Not be prosecuted under this
section but it does criminalize
back back back to having
abortions and clothes for a
standard of care to be kept in
place.
Mr speaker.
Yeah stand for questions thank
you didn't even thank you Mr.
if not then we'll consider to
have been meant.
First gentlelady from Dona Ana.
Is this a friendly amendment.
This is because this is not a
friendly amendment.
Okay she only says is it not a
from there is debate on the
amendment the gentleman from San
Juan Representative Montoya.
From grant and although in
Sierra County.
Thank you Mr speaker I yield to
the gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr.
But I would consider this
ammendment because police.
That is.
This questions actual questions
protections.
for that.
That is cool.
The.
Part of the process of an
abortion
service.
As this bill and house bill two.
Senator has built which is the
bill.
Yes it was.
That there are clinicians
protections in place for medical
providers but
this was different standard of
the conscience protection.
Abortion section of wall in New
Mexico statute.
Of this.
Standard.
Different standard the state
exists throughout
Across the state of director.
This service.
For.
This
is
that the land.
Have the responsibility of the
phone.
Tion process to take place
because of their conscience.
This and
This is on the other hand would
have no choice.
Aspiro or any medical facility
where abortions take place the.
Years and all the staff
Their ability at.
At.
And that abortion so
It is that understand Mr speaker
and and the gentleman from San
Juan section two.
In this section of the land is
not a bad person it's about the
facility the health care
provider and the doctors want to
treat it has nothing to do with
the version of the this is one
of our lenders to decide whether
Representative will allow
doctors to decide who and when
they perform procedures on and
what types of procedures they
percent Mr speaker and
gentleman.
This is.
To protect that right and
exception for that right.
Senator this body and I.
The body have sure the bills
coming from the committee chair
over and over again this is
gonna pass like state ought to.
This will inserting definitions
of civil rights but we're gonna
put here to answer the
definition of hazing you know
it's already a misdemeanor to to
harass someone but we're gonna
put account to and so on to see.
This.
Transaction.
Junction is.
This section of the.
Is this type of practice that
we.
Twice and protecting once of a
doctor can provider necessary in
this section of what.
That was last month.
There has been an effort at the
national level.
Department where complaints can.
Your rights to
do not participate in some sort
of medical procedure.
that that department thank you.
To take a claim that that your
conscience protections are not
being
to.
that that that.
Then there's a movie and there
has been a an effort in the
federal government to do from
that department Mr speaker and
gentleman from San Juan that
that but with the.
And we know to be true at the
very words of the New Mexico
ACLU that they are raising funds
and they are passionate people
confirmed that they were
discriminated and denied access
to an abortion as a specific
example based on someone's
religious beliefs in addition
Mexico just correlate coalition
for reproductive tries is
calling so called conscience
rights include they're saying
it's not a conscious right to
refuse.
I was just finishing other
people's health.
Thank.
Mexico is incorrect yes.
It I was able to find a place
to.
Organizations Mexico is yes at
the.
To.
The fans access to abortion
based on religious belief and
since representative on on
behalf to stop the objection of
performing abortion on a
conscience or religious beliefs.
Of.
of it happened within the last
month I I'm here to tell you
that has happened the current
department where you can go and
claim of this has the this
effort to be fun and.
Martin so.
As protections in place for
providers and hospitals that
place to
complain would be it is an
effort to do with that I think
this language.
Mexico drafters and providers
and hospitals or medical
facilities would have no place.
Recourse
That is the effort
and it is unfortunate that we're
not.
Mr speaker and gentle lady to
recruit doctors especially to
rural parts of the state and
the.
As the state
Active protection would have to
perform.
That procedure after referred
to.
For at that point if there's no
one in their community to do
that so but that's that's that
section of line.
Representative Townsend nurses
Aspin's are are saying that that
this is something that is a
clinicians mission for many it.
Representative said the.
the.
First license to practice the
is where the credit growth first
of all no fun.
In general the.
That this will put them in that
position for they're they're
dying.
But that they're doing to.
And that's what our conscience
comes in so for the first Mr
speaker.
Side
The two child as a fetus which
and that just means unborn
child.
but and and not allowed to to
have it the the the settlement.
An effort.
They
said it does appear that what
you're doing is withholding
Health Care but for those actors
the understanding and allies.
A different and I would love to
have that
That that protection they've had
it until now
and and and.
The second section right now
looking to not repeal section.
That if you have a response and
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San.
Yes.
Section two.
Mexico.
A doctor's ability to express
his rights not to participate in
person this does.
Dr facility or healthcare
providers and I listen to this
body.
This body said.
Choice would be not to have an
abortion for the Santa Fe pro
life but for others they have a
choice they said that over again
they for their religion as they
for their beliefs and they said
this is personal as a person
today I cry unto percent
twenty something.
Transaction
testifying people are texting
Mexico trying to end of the the
right to say no to present
information based on consciously
which is objections.
And there's another group Mexico
intending some fine cracks in
New Mexico who are trying to
there's they want as.
They're gonna start sending
folks to not take up
that the guys that they're
denying women's health care but
without taking into the
consideration that doctor
because we have a motion Mexico
can be forced to perform.
Have questions left children I
had elective abortion on health
in the third trimester and and
and that they will seek the
asking for people to come
forward so that they can send.
So
It is the intent.
Of the sponsors of so
effort on our parts to.
In true and honest efforts on
the Sanchez to to.
That they have stated over and
over some antiquated language
The section at with the
conscience protection is funded
Mr speaker.
Creative
director in the state chooses
whether patients are and what
they perform.
This.
President.
This cutting edge medical taken
away a different type of choice.
Is.
This bill is an excellent.
It is doesn't make sense.
So.
The second section that you
wanted to place a section.
That included Mr speaker Mr
speaker and gentleman for
someone is not it's a standard
of care it criminalizes at.
State initiatives so.
That's what everybody says
members as well as about that
transmissions it does not come
as the women it is the drive for
shin it is not done to a
standard of care so.
Sure what is it of interest.
The criminal section of wall.
Yes
for that are of an abortion take
place in a medical facility and
a medical doctor.
The.
It takes place and sections is
left in place I'm sorry.
It was going to as has been the
put forward before this body.
sections.
Of
these.
As Mr speaker and gentleman.
A section that says if there is
a standard of care for abortion
it has to happen in a medical
facility or doctor has to do it
Mr speaker and gentleman I know
and even R. Sanchez today on
this floor and in committee
prior to the floor and in prior
years how did and continued on
page that there is no other
standard of care in New Mexico
law regarding next regarding
abortion so.
As I have heard that if if
conservative people that have
their way that of what would
happen would be that back alley
abortions would become
commonplace so
this is just to those folks who
have stated that we have to do
X. Y. or Z. so that
calibrations can take place.
Section three of this land.
Does not.
There is no.
Those.
From a back alley abortion with.
Mr speaker gently Mr speaker and
gentleman San Juan that's
exactly what it does and I'm
talking about so we're talking
on health care provider.
Talking about.
Backwards.
The same as a person is
performed and it would
decriminalize that.
A back alley abortion is
criminalized there's a standard
of care referenced in section
three so Mr speaker and
gentleman is beyond by we would
repeal section two or three
except.
Apparently someone state.
Is.
That this is built section of
wall sections one three of the
criminal code there have been.
Because they're antiquated and
especially for I believe it's
become very clear it was not
antiquated sections to plan and
would definitely some language
in section one of that
And us
well as that that Representative
Brown is being for.
Changed some of that language
but.
I have just.
Sections.
And so that employees
some definitions of women and
last but quite frankly section
two and section.
Of the of the of the motion that
are self explanatory.
Definitions Mr speaker and
gentleman so are the battle.
The employees.
At all the state.
That
Just take place.
By a medical doctor.
The language the section that
says that Sen.
Not.
This.
The use of that does not want to
take part in a.
Is it going to.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
As.
This section of land.
Mexico statement that it was a
nineteen sixty nine law.
That Mr speaker gentle it is one
of the reasons of the kids.
Mr speaker and gentleman I have
but I think our constitution and
the laws are broken.
In nineteen seventy three.
I'm.
but will
is going to be considered
antiquated language and the.
By the same group of people are
gonna want to implement because
it's cold language I don't.
Yes I'm suspicious.
At best
And the girls.
Mexico.
Protected.
Medical providers in Mexico
deserve to be protected.
Section one.
The criminal section of route.
Not in
the but the proponents of this
proposal our state is not.
Individual seconded the motion
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan.
I hope that this body
understands that if we repeal
section one we are getting
created section of law that is
unenforceable because of
reverses weight we are keeping
abortion legal in New Mexico as
a sponsor say is their intent
however if we rental section to.
Taking.
The conscience protection and.
It's a kind of open up the
website but the second.
As.
Of clinicians and as I.
Of people content and removing
conscious objections based on
religious beliefs in order to
expand access to abortion it's
clearly stated on the website.
About the
organizations.
And this is that.
Contact.
Physician's office can
providers.
Conscience objection on the
books.
There is no.
It.
And trace.
For our doctors of facilities
are healthcare providers and
removing it section.
Is
does not have a standard of care
what the people who are
supporting the state should
never ever happen again.
The technician.
That it should be local should
be safe.
Yes.
Conference by striking section

About to.
Consider this bill only.
I consider it.
Was referring to the wall except
to strike it emission have
opened up the section of law and

So.
Not able to have the full debate
That.
Representative Brian try tune to

That.
It is suggested today.
fortunate her.
These protections for for our
underage girls who can.

Representative from San Juan.
Contentions to vote in favor

unfortunate until we take the
vote this body can protect

trying to have a back alley
abortion
Thank.
This new sections of this law
that are not included that are
protections for.
Standards of care in place

address the other section

preferred to these protections
for underage girls which were in
the other section but.
Up to the rules of the road.

Better customer provided shin
I'm looking to support.
I'm here on this floor because
our our our doctors are

As.
That medical students thank you

a hammer and I meant without it

Because use to protect.
Physicians doctors and
healthcare providers and
facilities based on
conscientious objection and
religious last and by leaving in

So.
To history.
Mr speaker.
There's further debate the
gentleman from Bernalillo
Sandoval in Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Give me a minute while I just
kind of compose myself because
this is a very emotional bill
it's something that we're voting
on.
I'm kind gentleman generally
speaking to you you.
Mr speaker yes I yield to the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
Santa Fe counties.
Thank you I really heard this
bill and my committee so what I
learned was and I'm gonna ask
you a few questions.
Abortion is between what you
have said between a woman and
her doctor is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady might you
repeat your question.
It was something that you said
before the committee meeting.
Can you can you hear me.
Yes okay Mr speaker gentle lady
okay when we were in the
committee before you had said
something that an abortion is
between a woman and her doctor
only is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady yes I
understand that abortion is
health care.
And that I trust a patient in
New Mexico to make their own
decisions about the health care
that's best for them and their
bodies and their lives and their
families.
S. R. and member that reply from
before thank you Mr speaker and
representative so that would
mean that all forms of abortion
are on the table is that
correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
That's not what we're debating
here in SB ten.
Okay.
Thank you Mr speaker and
representative so I'm gonna take
it from that that since we are.
Making it so that we're taking
what we're doing with this bill
is going to make it that all
forms of abortion are correct
including abortion up until
birth is that correct.
Mr speaker gentle lady that is
incorrect.
So it Mr speaker Representative
because I asked you that
question before and you gave me
the can't answer of it's a
health care between a doctor and
the woman so now you're saying
that's not what it is that we
can't do abortion up until nine
months of a woman needed it.
Mr speaker gentle lady what I'm
saying here but I'm here today
to debate SB ten
straightforward repeal of three
statutes that are currently part
of New Mexico's criminal code.
That were passed with the
intention to keep New Mexicans
from accessing the abortion care
the meaning in their lives.
Thank you Mr chair and
Representative.
The reason I ask that because I
just want to be very clear
because it is important
everybody understand that this
is a portion up until birth I
just want to make it clear.
That that is exactly what is
happening census between a
doctor and the patient.
So.
My birth mother.
was going to abort me.
And I heard that from multiple
people and you have to
understand how Marshall this for
me that.
That was the first thing she
thought of was to kill me.
So I'm here today because she
didn't thank god for what are
and whatever intervention.
I was told that my birth mother
waited too long.
Guess what.
You pass this bill and I
wouldn't be here.
Because you could have aborted
me up until nine months has she
chosen to.
So you're not just talking about
a bill we need to make an
abortion legal take equity and
credit antiquated blah blah blah
we're talking about me.
We're talking to me
Representative Stephanie lord.
Whose mother.
Was allegedly going to abort
her.
And thank god she didn't.
We're talking about me being
raised by that abortion doctor
who adopted me.
I was raised in that household
where they did abortions in the
house.
I saw women come in and leave in
tears.
I don't care what you say that
it's a blob I was not a blob of
flesh look at me I'm right here
I'm right in front of you.
I what you're saying doesn't
count.
I do count.
My vote counts my constituents
count the people of New Mexico
count.
My doctors and my mom's name is
Dr still nice over you can look
her up she has an arrest record.
Not from doing abortion.
But because she and all of her
friends were drug addicts and
alcoholics the lucky me I got to
grow up in a household where not
only were babies being killed
and women crying and this
horrible negative energy in this
household but I got to have a
mom who went to jail all the
time because her and all her
abortion friend doctors were
drug addicts and alcoholics why
because when she got drunk.
Used to ramble on about his
could handle what she was doing.
I'm here today because my birth
mother did not abort me.
I'm matter I count.
I wish you guys would stop
talking about it like it's
something inanimate it's not I'm
here as a representative of all
the children who are not here
because of abortion.
You keep saying that it's a
woman's right to have an
abortion what about the woman
that inside her uterus what
about me.
What about my rights when I was
inside I have no rights you're
pretty much going to take those
rights away that if somebody
want to make that decision to
kill the baby that's okay it's
not.
Keep saying you want strong
women.
I have to be born first.
That's all I have to say because
it's a very emotional bill for
me because I am here showing you
exactly what you are killing
thank you that is all.
There is for the debate the
gentleman from Colfax more Rio
Arriba and family Gail
Representative Montoya.
Mr speaker does the gentle lady
from Dona Ana County you.
Yes Mr speaker and gentleman I
yield to the gentleman from
Colfax mata jadi that and family
get counties.
This is Mr speaker and gentle
lady my name is Roger Montoya.
Today is a historic building in
our state.
Listening to this debate with
great respect on both sides.
The moment to speak as a
freshman is one of profound
reverence.
I stand unabashedly with women.
It what I refer to as
reproductive justice.
As a man who has spent three
decades intentionally creating
spaces and programs to protect
women and families and children
and youth the founding of a
charter school in a tribal town
the.
Intentional.
Development of hope a homeless
shelter and recovery programs
and after care programs I've
seen up close and personal what
happens.
When our families don't have
access to safe and legal health
care.
It is tragic.
I also speak to the phone space
of several relevant identities.
As a Hispanic man of faith.
For rural northern New Mexico.
As the first openly gay man ever
to be elected to this body.
As the so grateful survivor of
HIV and aids.
I know about life I have a
special relationship to it.
A develop something that I'd
live by I call it pro humanity.
Our duty as a governmental body.
Is to protect.
From the moment of the first
breath of the newborn child.
To the final breath after what
is hopefully a long and graceful
life.
Our duty.
Is to ensure that the social
determinants of health in this
state a robust in full.
That are educational programs
are relevant innovative.
That health care is safe and
affordable.
That our water and our food is
clean and healthy.
That is our duty.
To ensure that.
Abortions are as rare as
possible.
I applaud this this movie and I
see this state is extremely
important I look forward to
voting yes on house House Bill
ten and I commend.
The gentle lady from Dona Ana.
County for holding the space
with dignity and grace.
On behalf and in benefit to the
women of this incredible state I
yield back.
The gentleman is for the
gentleman from Bernalillo
Representative Roybal Caballero.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentle lady from going on I
yield.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from Bernalillo.
Thank you so much and thank you
once again.
For your courage and the courage
of all of
the sponsors and co sponsors
that have come forward Mr
speaker not just today but in
previous years I know that as an
elective since twenty twelve my
first term beginning in twenty
thirteen.
We've been listening to this
legislation.
And the answering on the
multitude of questions.
That seem to think questions
that seem to come up each and
every time and no matter how
much we Mr speaker attempt to.
Where was that.
It gets it and.
It gets crowded for a number of
reasons but I'm here today Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
To talk about this as a very
proud Catholics for choice
legislator.
I say that.
As I said.
Because I'm very proud.
Because Mr speaker and gentle
lady I see this as a choice
Bill.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
I see SB ten as.
Simply repealing an outdated and
very dangerous statute.
That's been sitting on our
books.
That actually leads the
criminalization of health care
providers and more importantly
in minor.
View point.
It's women's health in jeopardy.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
raise this because I'm going to
this is a very difficult point
for me to make.
Because I come from the
generation of the late sixties.
In the early seventies Mr
speaker and gentle lady and I
had to witness.
The atrocities.
That we're being conducted.
Affecting women's lives directly
and affecting their lives and
their futures directly Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
And I will begin with the
stories because I was a teenager
I was a young college student.
In the late sixties.
And when there were very few
choices in fact hardly any
choices.
For young women to seek medical
and health care.
When they need it especially
poor women of color it seems we
keep talking about Mr speaker
and gentle lady poor women of
color and it's been my lifetime
and it's been a long time before
that and the lifetime before
that and we keep talking about
quarter.
Under representative
underserved.
Women and communities of color.
Because Mr speaker and gentle
lady these are the communities
that have been adversely
affected.
By these kind of antiquated
laws.
And I want to talk about.
Personally having to help.
Fellow students female students.
Seek medical care.
From Los crucis from the border
region.
And having to seek this medical
care.
In ways in which.
As a student myself and having
been trained being trained at
the time as a
nurse's aide.
Founded.
Difficult to help them navigate
through.
Because of the laws and statutes
that were preventing them from
being able to make the decisions
that they felt they had to make.
Related to Mr speaker and gentle
lady to their bodies related to
their decisions that we're
making with their families.
And that they were making for
their futures as they order in
which was their choice.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
It was very difficult to have to
help nurse those young women
back to good health.
Not knowing with what whether
what they've had just undergone.
Would.
Waste their life in peril.
And in some cases it did.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
That was not easy especially
again as having being trained at
the time as a nurse's aide in
understanding the medical and
health implications of what was
going on but because they had to
go underground.
Mr speaker and gentle lady they
had to seek medical care
underground.
Because.
I'm not being afford it.
That choice is a health care
choice of beers.
And another this story is not a
story for real life experience.
Mr speaker and and gentle lady a
real life experiences money I
was in New York City in the mid
seventies.
That one of the sponsors
mentioned the sterilization.
Of women.
I don't know how many of you
recall but there were a
multitude of national news
stories at the time the early to
mid seventies about the rampant
sterilizations that were
uncovered in New York City they
were being called
hysterectomies.
Mr speaker and gentle lady the
involuntary hysterectomies that
were occurring.
Women of color.
War.
Language in they they they
weren't understanding English
language and they would go in.
For medical care.
And the physicians and private
facilities in New York City.
For horrible reasons.
Then I would say the attempt to
annihilate.
Mr speaker and gentle lady a
population of what communities
of color.
I was in the hallway waiting for
my surgery.
When I heard physicians speaking
English and nurses speaking
speaking English about doing a
simple procedure.
But while the woman was in there
Mr speaker and gentle lady they
would do a hysterectomy.
I heard that.
And the women that they were
talking about was Spanish
speaking women and I understood
because I was not only Spanish
speaking but I spoke English and
I understood both languages and
I heard and saw what was
happening Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
These are some of the
atrocities.
That we have seen historically.
Occur.
When you have rampant.
Violations.
What should be.
Protections.
And I'm gonna take a minute
because when I started Mr
speaker and gentle lady I
mentioned that I was actually.
And I want to read something.
I came from.
Magazine a journal.
And it's like you're not but
it's one in which that attempts
to talk about and discuss these
issues and I'm gonna call
because this really.
Ladies and points to mention of
the discussion that was played
discussed today.
And it says and I quote.
In favor of roe versus Wade this
not mean someone just in favor
of abortion.
Nothing can row versus Wade says
a person must have an abortion.
Nothing zero nada.
What effect is that if women are
going to have an abortion and
they will and always have.
It makes it thanks for.
And more possible in a safe way.
That way a woman's life is not
in danger.
Or it is in far less dangerous
than reverting to the not so
distant era when wealthy women
could hire doctors for such
procedures.
I poor young and middle class
women have to sneak into dark
places to undergo a dangerous
procedure that often cost them
their lives.
And what.
I read this.
Because if accounts and
associates Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
To the personal accounts that I
just a few that I witnessed.
I'm not in the past I did come
in.
And I have been around for
awhile.
But my memory doesn't fail me.
And what I saw happen doesn't
fail me and what I witness does
not fail me.
It is clear today is that was.
Then.
The warm.
The potential life threatening.
Dangers associated.
With criminalizing the woman's
decision.
Over her own body being heard
decisions Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
Between her.
Thank.
Her family members she to.
Share that with it is her
choice.
That decision Mr speaker and
gentle lady does not belong in
this house.
I'm governance nor in any house
of governance.
And Mr speaker and gentle lady.
I Mexico.
With faced with such decisions.
Thirty three years ago.
Mexico the age of my youngest
son thirty three years ago Mr
speaker and gentle lady I.
And a very good friend of mine.
We're faced.
With the notice that we were
pregnant.
In her case Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
She had to make a decision that
we were best friends she had to
make a decision Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
It was a very personal decision.
And it was one that she
cherished.
And she really truly.
Understood the nature of.
Her pregnancy and what had
occurred and why.
But she had a personal decision
to make and the decision was I
already have three children two
children.
I'm single.
I don't have I haven't completed
my education or degree.
And I don't know what to do.
Mr speaker and gentle lady it
just so happened that I was on
the opposite spectrum.
I had been married I had an
older son he was almost sixteen
years of age.
And I was remarried and lo and
behold after having been told I
could not have any children.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
I was given the wonderful meals.
That despite all the medical
reasons of why I have been told
I could not conceive.
America had literally occurred
because the doctor that had same
doctor Mr speaker and gentle
lady that it told me that I
could no longer conceived was
the same doctor sixteen years
later who have to tell me the
news that she had no other
reason.
To explain.
This pregnancy either of them.
It was out of our human hands Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
But my decision was quite
different.
I had.
Senator illnesses.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
That contributed to.
The almost for sure possibility.
Hi Kerry this trial full term.
Either the child or I would not
make it through.
Delivery and they get I'm sorry.
No I'm not sorry it is emotional
and it is.
Wonderful actually.
But at the same time very
painful.
To receive this type of.
Information.
We don't know Mr speaker and
gentle lady whether you.
And the child you're caring will
survive.
And you've got to make a
decision.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
My past was to seek to in three.
Other opinions.
Every single opinion.
Said.
You cannot do this.
It is a life threatening to you.
It is life threatening to you.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
My decision.
Was quite different.
In my dear friends decision.
What the common ground that we
shared as best friends as we
cried.
In each other's arms as we.
Discussed what we had ahead of
us.
And mind you we know we were not
Mr speaker and gentle lady
discussing decisions with our
significant others.
We were having discussions
between us.
Because we believed.
That first and foremost Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
These were our bodies.
These were our health issues.
These were our personal.
Decisions.
That we try.
Mr speaker and gentle lady not.
Share.
In those moments with anyone
else.
Not even the fathers of the
children that we were caring.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
This is an incredible.
An incredible enlightening
moment that we had when we
realized that the power this
year and I have Mister speaker
and gentle lady.
Was.
In that embrace the she and I
had at that moment.
And that we have the power.
We had the power has women.
Mr speaker and gentle lady as
women of thank because we both
had been raised Catholic.
Mr speaker and gentle lady but
our Catholicism taught us.
Are very Catholicism taught us.
These are personal decisions.
They weren't teaching otherwise
there was no fanaticism
trying to us and I was raised in
the fifties and sixties in
Catholic setting school setting
and so she was she Mr speaker
and gentle lady.
There is no.
Analysis I'm about that at all
Mr speaker and gentle lady the
truth of the matter what is that
what are teaching was.
Thanks for decisions that were
personal to us.
And then if we needed to consult
we knew that we could consult
always with our family and our
god.
And our faith Protestant we had
our our our priests in our case
our previous to consult with or
not the nuns to consult with
whomever we chose to consult
with but the bottom line Mr
speaker and gentle lady was that
these were our decisions
because our bodies.
We're divinely given bodies.
Mr speaker and gentle lady this
was.
Incredible moment for us she
made her decision.
And thank god it was a safe and
healthy decision.
Because later on in life Mr
speaker and gentle lady she was
given to.
With another pregnancy at a time
when she chose to go ahead and
move forward with that.
And in my case as I mentioned Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
The pride and joy.
I'm having my younger son.
After sixteen years of not
having children and being told
that I could never have a child.
The pride and joy of having
brought him into this world.
And risking all of the medical
risks and I had to take and they
were horrible I was bed ridden.
A dialysis machine was put in
the delivery room.
I had to have medical
specialists all prepared in in
line.
Despite what the position
advise that I chose.
The other route to go I placed
my decision.
Within my heart.
I place my decision with my
family.
And I placed my decision with my
in my face.
And above everything it was my
choice to make.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I see
this legislation.
As being a powerful.
A powerful.
Resonating.
Message that we send to all of
our women and families and the
children that we have in the
grand children that we have Mr
speaker and gentle lady the
grandchildren and their
grandchildren to come.
This decision.
You.
Does not belong.
The government for a long.
And it is time.
Beyond time Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
This antiquated.
And imposing.
Legislation on.
We're out of our statute.
And that we be true Mr speaker
and gentle lady.
What.
The real discussion is here
today.
And not let it be clouded.
By the agency fax or the
misrepresentations.
Or the hysteria it has prompted.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
And to all of the misconceptions
that are being.
Our own out there in an attempt.
To violate Mr speaker and gentle
lady the very.
Importance.
And privacy.
Decision that is the only
between.
Myself.
My family and my face.
Mr speaker and gentle lady thank
you.
Representative team all of us
thank you for caring this piece
of legislation on behalf of all
of us.
And I stand in very strong
support as a Catholic for chores
legislator in support of this
legislation thank you so very
much thank you Mr speaker I
yield back.
This resentment and gentleman
from Santa Fe Representative
Serrato.
Thank you Mr speaker I will the
gentle lady from going on a
field.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentle lady from Santa Fe.
Thank you Mr speaker the gentle
lady I wanted to get a quick
clarification because I believe
you you Senator on but had you
meant you mentally for working
with folks across the state and
did you see that the majority of
them believe that women could
make a decision without
impacting their views is
director that quickly Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker gentle lady.
Yes but I've shared.
I'm here.
Is that New Mexicans from every
corner of our incredibly diverse
state.
Have made clear.
That they know and understand
that we can each hold our own
moral views about abortion.
And still fundamentally
absolutely trust a pregnant
woman.
To make it's deeply compacts the
systems for the New South.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady you know I I was curious
because that reflects a lot of
my conversations I've had in my
community prior to the outbreak
of COVID nineteen and the
pandemic that is maintenance all
practice social distancing more
and gentle lady Mr speaker you
know what what I found was the
fasting of those conversations
was so much of the hush tones
that I receive from a lot of the
older on folks that are worried
was able to interact with and
you know almost apologetic
sometimes where they would say
things like you know I I'm
Catholic but I I just believe
that if the woman can can make
this decision and Mr speaker and
gentle lady I I and I I I
understood from that perspective
having being raised you know I I
got a couple of brothers and no
sisters in a very a male
environment and so a lot of
things about being a young lady
growing up on you know we're
we're relegated to very hushed
conversations a very quiet tones
and you know and I I did a lot
of credit to my mother to you
know carry that through and
social restricted still there's
so much about that was being
private and non gentle lady Mr
speaker what I found was when I
when I was at a listening ear
and and a and a person that
wanted to hear their perspective
people from all walks really did
just compartmentalized to
understand in those situations
why would be need to what I
understand that's a little bit
harder understand and you know
opening up those conversations
and what to do so much of this
legislation does is open up that
conversation and really make it
an opportunity to talk and I
think to gentle lady Mr speaker
want to want to just
seeing something to to the folks
at home they're listening and to
those women and people who've
been pregnant or had to make
hard decisions all know that we
see you and that you.
In the you don't deserve to
judge yourself or to a judge to
be judged just Mr speaker
individually for hard decisions
to be made you know I I know.
A handful of very strong women
in particular who have had to
make a hard decision after their
would drop to to have a late
term abortion and then Mr
speaker gentle lady you know
their strength that they showed
having chosen names on you know
decorated nursery on you know me
plans you know we would talk
about
having having my own daughter
you know those moments when it
likely my daughter used to keep
my spouse in our sleep we joke
that issues gaining up on with
me and so you know we have these
moments and and the strength of
my friends had to face very
difficult late stage of
pregnancy decisions I I just
don't feel that I am in any
place as a politician as a as a
leader as a as as even a friend
to tell them that they are not
allowed to make that decision
for their family I I want to
trust these women and their
families Mr speaker and gentle
lady to to make those decisions
with their doctors with their
god and and as a fellow Catholic
you know the movies and choice
you know in this Lenten season I
I I I want to remind all of my
friends that you know that there
is forgiveness and there is
thoughtfulness and there is love
and the decisions you make are
so often out of love and
kindness for yourself the
children may have for your
family for the children that you
have you had any hard decisions
about for for you know for
making those decisions for your
family and for yourself and so
you know I think that's
important to express at this
time because again the more we
bring to light that our
experiences as women and people
who may become pregnant you know
it it makes the process easier
it makes it easier to talk about
things because I I know not so
long ago Mr speaker and gentle
lady talking about having a
miscarriage was something that
was shameful and it was
difficult for women to come
forward and admit that that
happened to them being unable to
have a child is still so
difficult for folks that talk
about so you know there is love
in in in in this legislation to
make sure the people are are
seen and respected for their
bill.
The to make the best decision
that they can in the most loving
way that they can so thank you
so much a gentle lady for
bringing for this legislation I
think it's so important you know
as a message to all New Mexicans
in all our children that we
trust you we believe in you and
you can make good decisions and
we we do believe that future for
you I I know back to the gentle
lady.
General.
From Bernalillo.
This.
This.
I was I move that the budget.
No objection it is so ordered.
The general fund or managed to
close.
Mr speaker.
Today is certainly a long time
coming.
To date with the vote for Senate
bill ten.
We affirm that personal decision
about abortion must remain with
New Mexicans and our families.
Mr speaker for too long.
It was assumed.
That New Mexico.
Was too complicated to Hispanic
to indigenous.
To brown and black and diverse.
I believe in abortion access.
Mr speaker it's important to say
as we wrap this long and complex
and heartfelt conversation.
That New Mexico like Hawaii.
Has always been a major
indigenous and black and she
gonna I'm people of color state.
And that when we take a vote I
think that what we're about to
take today.
We bring our values to the
table.
We believe in health care access
because of those values not in
spite of them.
Mr speaker and body.
And I'm with you today so far
away from my loved ones and
incredible small town where I
call home we're my family's been
for generations.
I think about all those leaders
who taught me and help me and
given me grace I miss so much
generosity.
Allowed us to move these
conversations further than
anyone could have believed.
Mr speaker body this moment
comes from generations of
organizing I love and efforts by
indigenous black sheep gone out
and people of color readers.
Who held our values.
And make today's of all
possible.
Thank you Representative just
ready.
I asked state.
That we do.
Senate Bill.
As amended.
Final passage Senate bill ten as
amended the vote is now open.
Thirty seconds.
By a vote of forty in the
affirmative thirty in the
negative Senate bill ten as
amended has duly passed the
house.
Thanks to item for.
John Carcieri ready on that
item.
As the most speaker a can you
get me to that power point.
That all action necessary for
placing House before anyone on
final passage is been taken the
general to explain the bill.
Thank you is the most because
the miles beaker committees and
gentleman of the house house
bill forty one includes no
language in chapter forty nine
which is our land grants
statutes adding the final
criteria of a partition Spanish
land grant is the most beaker
and house bill forty one also as
qualifying criteria in what
constitutes a partition Land
Grant.
Speaker these two elements the
to the object of a house bill
forty one which is establishing
partition land grants and one of
five units of government slash
political subdivisions.
Of the state as much speaker in
doing this these partition land
grants going twenty six
centuries old sister land grants
in that undertaking is the most
beaker the this legislation only
applies to the six party some
land grants these at beam one
and then which is self promoter
more than enough which is west
the Montezuma castle your
permits peak
does the last which is between
story late last Vegas someone
who's being which is south of
Las Vegas.
Some had only mode which is
south of us bring us and oil on
the rebound which is north of
house speaker a similar bill
unanimously passed this chamber
in twenty nineteen and with that
I stand for questions.
From Chavis and Lincoln
Representative Nibert.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
yield.
I was basically up to the
gentleman from Travis.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
really appreciate your pointing
out the fact that this
legislation only covers of sex.
Land Grant the areas to discuss
the I just want to make clear
that this is limited to those
for smaller areas of land that
the we discussed in committee
and led to graciously set forth
in your introductory remarks is
that correct that's correct no
speaker John from Travis.
I thank you Mr speaker that's
all why to.
Thank.
Gentleman from curry
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
kind gentleman please yield.
As the most because I was raised
the yield to the gentleman from
current.
Thank you kind gentleman
I'm curious in your petition for
the land grant percent.
Is one of the requirements that
it be that there be land
existing I know that there are
landless land grants.
So is that if you were a new
bill that it has to.
Have physical land working in
the partition as a land less
land grants as the amount of
this must be current general
curry.
These partition land grants
Are all landed land grants.
Of four of these have a bridge
in the three the three thousand
acre range
the
You are available on the oil and
has approximately three hundred
and the COVID has a couple
hundred acres so these are all
landed land grants that are
classified as partisan nine
grams of which house bill forty
one brings into the as political
subdivisions in joining the
other twenty six Spanish Van as
they're already but
subdivisions.
Thank you for that I I I'm glad
to hear that and and John what
is the benefit of bringing this
in is is government divisions
how does that benefit these land
grants.
You must be present are from
curry
good question.
In two thousand and four we
passed the milestone piece of
legislation creative by the the
newly created the land grants
interim committee in two
thousand three and in
conjunction with our communities
and grant leaders we passed a
milestone reform legislation in
two thousand and four that
brought in our our our our
Spanish community land grants
into the loop as a political
subdivisions similar to the same
status as a municipality in
County the school board
Conservancy district a second.
And the the budget is that one
they have access to
capital element.
three in terms of any particular
requests
they also
our subject to audits as they
auditor also subject to
legend criteria a similar to the
election code that we have in
place subject to the open
meetings act.
And
and also
by being a political
subdivisions they're entitled
they qualify for federal grant
monies and that one Land Grant
in particular partition land
grant was a basically denied
federal grant monies for a
fourth verse Representative
restoration project there no he
does not the last thing us
mainly because they did not have
the the qualifying title of a
unit of government a political
subdivisions so those are just
some of the benefits that these
six land grants would benefit
from as a political
subdivisions.
Thank you for that I appreciate
the that understanding helps in
Mr speaker and gentleman on page
four line three it talks about
the office of the Attorney
General shall establish methods
and procedures for certifying
this partitions of the land
Representative.
Approximately how long do you
think it will take them to
establish the the.
Certifying methodologies and how
long will it be before these are
actually.
In statute.
As the government agencies.
it's not speaker John from curry
I think it'll do it'll be a
process
a very swift process many
because these are communities
that have been in existence
since the mid eighteen hundreds
since early eighteen hundreds so
these these heirs of these land
grants of them living within
these partition land grants the
store if we so they have a track
record they have a history and
and and and have I done
identifiable communities within
their partition grant so that
process by the by the Attorney
General of the level of the
Largo Division of the roles with
and I don't see that taking more
than one month after this bill
becomes law.
Thank you for that optimistic
attitude my friend I I okay is
swift process and government
this is an oxymoron.
But I I do appreciate your
answers and responses and
helping clarify what you build
us thank you very much Jim thank
you Mr speaker.
Thank you John
from Travis Representative
Ezzell.
Mr speaker thank you very much
we'll chairman Garcia here
please I was basically the.
To the gentle lady from Travis.
Mr speaker thank you very much
the chairman Garcia of whenever
Representative Crowder was
talking about the government
doesn't get married I was
reading your bill and on page
four and five it's talking about
whenever tell may.
was confirmed by Congress in
fifty eight indeed it was
patented to the town of Thome
and it'd also state that the
troops go.
confirmed by the court nineteen
ninety four and finally it was
patented in nineteen oh five and
take a look at eighteen fifty
eight nineteen no two is at the
yes they do take their time it
seems like I'm getting things
done that Mr speaker a minute.
Chairman Garcia you said that
nineteen or two thousand and
nineteen this bill did pass the
house what happened.
That's correct this most
begrudgingly from Travis
investment house unanimously
went over to the Senate passed
the Senate by one vote would
want to send involved and
basically
let's look at the law by the
governor.
And Mister speaker whenever is
park of pocket vetoed there's no
message that that is that
correct that's correct the is
the most begrudgingly.
Well that seems.
That that you had to been
stunned by the Mr speaker and
gentleman of chairman.
Garcia.
Are all the land grants they are
current on their property taxes
is that correct.
That's correct is the most
because only I was in and I want
to follow for that.
Because in past years.
especially right after the New
Mexico went to
a different the process in terms
of the property tax.
then your land grants
became delinquent and okay the
property tax because up to that
point.
The economic event rents were
not paying property taxes on
their properties on under
comments so that was that was a
very frightful period for our
Spanish land grants to where
they actually lost some of their
acreages
because of their inability to
pay the property tax.
So currently.
Our current land grants know
that history and are not about
to let those taxes money.
No speaker.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you very much for the response
is there.
Were these land grants are
located and you said everything
is current there is there a
minimum population that had
that's required to be on these
lands.
just must be gradually from
Travis no.
No and
there is no required population
these are all settlements okay
management plans
basically is is the land tenure
structure for the settlement and
the populating of our of our
quality of the quality of New
Mexico.
So this is the only structure in
place.
Since sixteen ninety two to
eighteen forty six this is our
communities were established
several of the group you know
how infrastructure was built in
these communities less through
the Spanish land grant system.
And in that existed as I stated
from sixteen ninety two eighteen
forty six was the start of the
Mexican American war.
Because
piece of history Mr Chairman and
Mr speaker of high not had the.
Pleasure being able to serve on
the land grants committee one of
these days I may just do the but
the fascinating history that is
taking place in our state
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you very much for your responses
I yield.
Gentleman
Representative Powdrell Culbert.
Thank you Mr speaker the other
question I had has already been
answered.
And just for the manager
Jennifer Senator you didn't have
any debate.
Gentleman from Bernalillo
Representative Maestas.
Thank you Mr speaker will the
gentleman from Bernalillo yield.
Most requests the to my neighbor

Thank you Mr speaker gentle from

your tremendous commitment and
work to the land grants and

four so these these happened and
they're not being recognized or
what what is that I have that
reference to two thousand four
Mr speaker gentleman from
Bernalillo.
is the most Baker and the
gentleman from Bernalillo.
that is part of the of the
the funding criteria in terms of
what constitutes.
Importation Land Grant.
And
so.
If if the if the partition
Langer and they land grants.
was partitioned after two
thousand and four.
they could not be come a
political subdivisions in fact
that we're not even going that
route with the legislation but
two thousand and four is set.
Because.
That's the barometer in two
thousand and four is where we
created.
article one Spanish land grants
AS you Mr government political
subdivisions status so that's
why we put is that in this
particular bill that I know
priority date so to speak.
Thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker John from
for Health.
So when you talk about partition
is that.
Leadership of a particular land
grants wishes to create their
own separate land grant does it
allow amendment to divide into
into two separate.
legal entities.
that's what I thought would be
see it would be six land grants
yes.
the Las Vegas requests they were
all of
given these these communities
and these airs on these
properties of the of the four
that I mentioned in last Vegas
or basically grant at the I
District Court.
and in some instances
there was encroachment.
going on where the District
Court was also
issuing
Parts of the COVID to outsiders
in this private
kind of a concern of the
settlements that have been part
of the Las Vegas Grant since its
inception in eighteen twenty
three.
And
and that kind of prompted these
errors of these poor communities
service to solicit specific
title to their comments so
that's all of these these were
kind of created so to speak.
Is to that type of action to
under districts this particular
thanks.
Thank you Mr Curtis Malone that
so lastly of.
So why do twenty three and me
and I established myself as an
error what which one do I go to
if their partition and my an air
to.
Which partition or a more to
build it say if I was in one of
those.
I'm here to one of those land
grants that that becomes to land
grants.
You're basically and and and
there.
You're you're you're an air in
terms of the mother grant.
And and these grants.
The only way they can kind of
claim title to their common.
Is that there also appears to
the to the mother grant.
And the so it's not your choice
if you don't have ancestry in
the school are you know if you
can't you can join the club.
But you can join the club and
the larger grant you know and
and and that's in the US than
those requests as and really
not
I'm not a a a real viable grant
in the sense that is not
governed by a board of trustees
is governed by the District
Court that has a panel of three
people kind of you know oversee
the remaining three hundred
acres that but also in the
pandemic you can see that these
partitions of more.
Land base then the mother
requests.
And and this because these are
these communities have really
taken to heart
their obligation to see that
these comments
remained and Carmen for
generations to come and and and
that's what protection under a
subdivisions title so so the
focus of divisions that is if
these comments is that and those
comments cannot be parceled out
to anybody nevertheless this is
brought before a District Court
in that quarter makes decisions
but then we have a tax incentive
forty nine to keep.
On our from the common man's
these are these Spanish land
grants from falling into the
hands of people that have no
ancestral ties to these
community events.
Mr Jones really without the the
grant just south of biggest with
what what what is it named
there's two of them and I think
you're you're I think you're
going to have

And.
It's going to be hard hearing
for me on.
I was about to Mr speaker
members of the body.
Maybe it's because as a mother
in a care giver hi I am.
I don't want to cause anyone
distress and so I keep biting my
tongue because I want to
apologize for this to the body
for this being a difficult
hearing but I'm not going to
apologize.
This is difficult.
Is far more difficult to live it
Senator is to hear about it or
talk about it.
And so on.
Mr speaker if I could
For a moment.

Co sponsor.
From Bernalillo county
gentlelady from Bernalillo
county.
And the gentleman from
Bernalillo and with that the
Representative Hochman Vigil yes
okay yes Mr speaker.
generating budget William
Representative Hochman Vigil.
Thank you very much Mr speaker I
thank you also gentle lady from
Bernalillo Representative
Armstrong from for bringing this
extremely courageous yet
compassionate piece of
legislation.
Mr speaker gentle lady AS IT.
We're taught to not really talk
about death.
It's a mysterious concept.
It is difficult painful and
hard.
But Mr speaker gentle lady just
like birth is a very important
part of life as a cycle of life.
Representative Armstrong stated
that this is going to be a
difficult hearing and I agree
with her.
We are going to talk about a
difficult concepts and it's
going to get emotional but it's
a conversation that needs to be
had Mr speaker and gentle lady
because compassionate medical
aid in dying is about choice.
It's about personal autonomy and
it's about giving New Mexicans
the ability to live their lives
and in their lives in a way that
they choose.
Mr speaker Mr speaker gentle
lady I chose to become involved
with this legislation because of
an experience I had when I was
twenty years old.
My mother was diagnosed with
stage four adrenal carcinoma of
unknown origin.
What that means Mr speaker and
gentle lady are is that by the
time my mother received a cancer
diagnosis it was so widespread
throughout her body that The New
Mexico just cannot even tell
work started.
In fact by the time her cancer
screenings are read her doctors
were flabbergasted that she was
still alive.
At the time I was a senior in
college I made the difficult
decision to leave my screen and
to spend the rest of the time I
had with my mother to help her
make the difficult transition
from this life to the next.
We went to the palliative care
unit in a very well known
hospital where for about six
weeks I care for my mother as
the cancer had metastasized to
her bones.
It was extremely painful.
Throughout that process we went
through the medication after
pain medication incomes ID's.
Cost me bags.
Different types of techniques
radiation therapies to see if we
can get my mother any relief
from the immense on some
mountains mountable pain that
she had begun to experience.
At night the pain would be so
overwhelming for her that she
would cry out in pain.
For the nurses to offer her some
sort of treatment that didn't
exist.
For me to somehow take her pain
away from her ailing body.
And to god.
To give her relief but never
came.
About a week before my mother
passed away she called me to her
bedside.
And she asked me her baby girl.
Her only daughter.
The person I know that she loves
more on this earth than anyone
else but yourself.
To help her and her life.
It was a request I could not
honor.
Mr speaker.
For obvious reasons.
But it was at that moment that I
realized.
Medical aid in dying is not
about philosophy.
It's not about religion.
It's about autonomy.
Thank you passion.
In the ability again to live
one's life and and one's life in
a way.
They choose.
I want to thank the sponsor for
bringing this piece of
legislation it is the honor of
my life to be involved with this
and I want to dedicate this
discussion and the work that
we've done on this bill to my
mother their land and also my
father Joel who went through the
exact same thing.
Four years later after the death
of my mother.
Thank you very much Mr speaker.
You're back to four.
Thank.
gentlelady from Bernalillo
Representative Armstrong do you
wish to make further comment
before we proceed to debate.
Yes thank you Mr speaker I do
and thank you my co sponsor for
give me a moment.
I have
Mr speaker given many
interviews.
And many discussions about this
issue.
over the years.
Since I've been bringing it.
And the first question actually
the most frequent questions I
get asked is why are you doing
this.
What got you involved why does
it matter to you.
Mr speaker members.
Members of this house I'm going
to tell you today.
What.
I have generally responded that
I've been involved with.
Death and dying issues and
terminal patients in hospice
and.
in geriatric care over my
career.
As a physical therapist.
Almost thirty years ago.
Speaking personal.
As I care for my father in law.
At the end of his life.
Bill Armstrong.
He was a veteran.
Of the Korean War.
A fiercely independent.
You.
Republican.
He lived and raised his family
all over the world.
The last few years of his life.
He lived with us.
My husband and I and our three
children.
He had a history of prostate
cancer.
That
after he came to or as you came
to live with us.
It has spread to his bones.
He had chosen to forgo.
Continued chemo.
And this is actually I think
maybe the first time that I
really heard about the hemlock
society.
Because he contacted them.
He got instructions and he
started saving pills.
And unfortunately.
He started telling us doctors
you want to build because he was
saving him for that which and
they wouldn't give in to so he
was having difficulty saving up
is built but nonetheless he was
saving up is built.
His greatest fear was to dine
paying.
From the cancer having spread to
his bones.
he was on hospice.
In a still doing pretty well
pretty independent actually.
Only used a Walker but one day
his legs just gave out from
under him and he fell.
Call nine one one to come to the
hospital is it was pretty
obvious you've probably broken
leg.
What I have.
A vote tomorrow.
He broke both femurs as I owns
both.
They opened up the July.
Look close tomorrow.
It was so cancer ridden thank
pregnant do anything plate
screws anything.
From home.
This man who feared most being
Diné pain wasn't Scrushy aiding
pain.
Every time I moved in to take
care of them.
Cause you more pain.
I promise to.
When one of nineteen.
And I couldn't do anything about
it.
This is my first institutions.
The second really impact for one
that I want to tell you about is
twelve years ago.
In when I moved in to take care
of friend of mine.
I'm gonna tell you I haven't
talked a lot about the story.
But I'm going to to them tell
you she is because many of you
know or.
Andy Jennings.
For us well.
The former pro tem.
senator Tim genesis.
I moved in with her in the last
month for life.
To take care of her.
She has a four year battle.
With a pretty aggressive breast
cancer was already stage for
when she was diagnosed.
Metastasized your loans.
Jennings.
For every day for one more year.
One more months one more week
one more day.
With her family her five
children.
And she was she was on the only
thing that would ease her.
Breathing.
With all of the tumors in our
lungs was morphine.
And in that last month we are
giving our breeding treatment
with morphine.
Round the clock every couple
hours.
In the.
He was so strong.
And so in control of funding and
remember Patty she was she was
in charge.
In those last weeks as she
dictated to me what she wanted
her funeral to be.
Every detail including one for
children should wear.
He was coming to the realization
that it wasn't going to be much
longer.
And headed state on on chemo.
An oral medication she took
every day.
To keep the tumors.
At bay just announced that she
could continue to have one more
day one more week.
With their children.
In about a week to week and a
half before he passed.
In your home from yet one more
brain scans because it had now
spread to her brain.
She made me promise are.
She wouldn't have to leave your
house ever again.
She decided.
Up in.
Knowing what that meant.
One of the most.
Really.
No one heart wrenching thing.
Her youngest child.
In all.
Wrote a letter to his school.
His teacher and classmates.
Let me know he'd be okay.
Turn off my video Mr speaker
might might
internet slow unstable.
That's fine.
This.
Teach for.
Tell us.
In.
His mother.
Stop suffering.
A.
Let her go.
Just wish us.
For.
The.
Immunity in.
No longer swallow.
To do the morphine by ivy.
She finally passed.
Mr speaker and members of the
body I don't know for sure.
As we didn't talk about this.
Economic Patty.
Eradication.
But I do know she would have
wanted to check.
She was.
Then said she would.
She made her own life and death
decision.
Sided when it was time.
To stop.
I do believe would have
preferred.
She said group I.
Gentleman from Bernalillo I
think we're
I'm I'm back I'm sorry my.
Internet hello.
Speaker.
Funding.
It's.
According to me.
In my family.
That we passed use the budget
Jan.
Two people a choice.
You
have heard me speak many of my
daughter intern.
Those who think heard her speak
for all.
Representative Armstrong we are
really getting much of what
you're saying region currently
Devon from our staff as you say
the call in number I think you
might be better if you
disconnect from zoom and and
just call in it only takes about
a minute then we can get you
right right back we are but I
want to make sure that we can
hear you.
Representative Armstrong I
believe you are back.
Are you there.
Now yes we can.
Okay thank you I'm.
Apologize.
I was telling you about my
daughter interned.
Many of you know.
Diagnosed with cancer.
As a teenager had had it for
probably a long time already
concert with stage four times
she was diagnosed.
And after the first couple years
of treatment she's been pretty
stable for almost almost twenty
years never gone but it wasn't.
impacting her.
Pretty stable.
But two years ago.
Just inform our session worry
introduces the last time.
We found that Aaron had a
genetic mutation that took all
of her tumors and express.
To bring.
More to our long.
Remember to our bones.
In the last two years she sent
three brain operations three
premium means.
Survived a massive infection and
radiation and multiple parts of
our body.
Now
On a clinical trial.
It seems to be
Keeping her her tumors maybe
being we hope.
While longer from growing.
Found out two one nine.
Your bonds are deteriorating and
she's starting to depress stress
fractures.
Multiple.
Which are very painful.
And you still have an operable
brain tumor that says.
Comintern to replace.
She's fighting very hard to
live.
Just like Patty she'll do
anything to everything.
For one more year.
Many more years one more she's
heard.
And she has seven testimony
committees.
Her goal to move into her
forties.
I'll turn forty this year.
We don't know how long she has.
We don't know how long the
clinical trial will continue to
work we don't know.
How much your bones may
collapse.
You Mr speaker.
Members of this body.
That's why I do this.
Why this is important and I've
heard from.
Hundreds of people.
All over the state.
Want the same opportunity the
same choice.
We want desperately to live.
But when faced.
With the end.
But they cannot reverse anymore.
They don't want to die in pain.
They don't want to suffer.
They want to gather their
friends and family or loved ones
around them.
And take the medication to go to
sleep.
One pass away.
That day.
But I dread more of Saddam the
suffering.
Mr speaker members of this body.
Again no apologies for me today.
But.
I think it was important the
number one question I get asked.
In on this for you can't hear
the voices of everyone who has
been.
Thank you pleading for this
really.
And so I gave this to my own
stories.
Now I stand for questions.
This debate the gentle lady from
Valencia Representative Fargo.
Thank you Mr speaker with the
kind lady from Bernalillo please
yield.
I will gladly yield to the
gentle lady from Valencia thank
you thank you kind lady thank
you on the tax bills these are
very very tough bills
And you know it's amazing what
my whole life experience changes
how you view the same
I would have said twelve years
ago
I would approach these bells and
very different different fashion
Preserving life has always been
fundamental for me and something
that I've always believed in you
know from the womb to the grave
and I as they stand on but like
you know the speakers at the two
sponsors have have previously
mentioned.
When you go through it and you
see your life changes
when my mother was dying of
cancer and she was in the pain
that she was then she had to
tell a friend.
That she wanted to die she was
to she couldn't tell her family
because we couldn't accept it.
And we didn't know how to handle
it so it was a friend of mine
who finally had to come to us
and and tell me that my mom is
ready to go.
We are fortunate that in her
situation
it is very me and and we had we
stopped
We stopped.
given my support she passed
rather quickly after that
But somebody that you love in
pain I would have done anything
to stop that pain I would have
been on the street corner
picking up any drag I could
find.
In order to make her feel better
and so.
I understand where you come from
because living through it
is the most difficult things
that you ever have to have to
deal with.
about this bill before Mr
speaker kind lady they do have a
few questions
I feel comfortable with this
piece of legislation
thank you the last time you
brought you brought this I have
some concerns with who makes
those decisions would you mind
going over that again on.
Where that decision comes from.
And the other and I have a two
part on that and.
Is there can family intercept
that decision anyway.
In the family say no I don't
want this if the person learning
this is of sound mind could you
address that time meeting.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman waiting for that
question because it's a really
important distinction.
the answer the short answer is
no this is a decision only by
the individual.
If they meet the qualifications
of the position.
In a second provider has to be a
second opinion a firm that that
the person is terminally ill in
the definition of terminally ill
tracks with the definition for
hospice which is less less than
six months expected life
expectancy.
And that they can self
administer and that they have
the capacity to make that
decision for themselves.
No one else can make the
decision for them and they have
to be able to volitional only
take medication.
It can't be done for them.
You madam Mr speaker and gentle
lady were able to.
withdraw life support from your
mother.
You could not have done this for
her if she hadn't been.
clear in her decision to do it
that'd been affirmed by multiple
providers and she was able to
take the medication.
No one with dementia.
Could put this in their durable
power of attorney that says
that's what I want.
If when I can no longer make
decisions for myself that
invalidates your eligibility.
If you can't decide for
yourself.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
kind lady and answered another
one of my question that was the
other thing I was wondering
about because I lost my father
my stepfather in the middle of
COVID
not due to comment that he had a
life threatening stroke
and during that time frame
and
current administration
that prevented us from
continuing my support for here
and so we need it was very clear
on what he wanted in his last
days we honor that
question he was a very strong
manner using navy seal
and he was and he had no health
problems whatsoever some
fortunately did take longer for
for him to pass then we would
have like but that was a
decision that he made
he when he was of sound mind so
we we follow those that was my
other question thank you for
answering that
and I just have one last
question and HMM.
I'm.
You know is there can somebody
at eighteen twenty one you have
sixty.
At what age make this decision
for yourself Mr speaker family.
Mr speaker and kind lady this
must be an adult and it's
defined in the and this bill
adult means a resident of the
state who is eighteen years of
age or older.
Thank you Mr speaker premium I
guess that is a yes these are
tough.
L.
creators a I can I can feel the
pain here through the phone I
know you're not on the zoom
right now
taking everything I have to pull
myself together this brings up a
lot of emotions
and I will say that
It has never gone through this.
And what somebody did hear it's
need to hear it from you.
And so completely helpless.
It is the worst thing that that
you can never go through
especially someone that you love
so much you don't want them to
go but sometimes you know that
that's all they're crying for
and so thank you kind lady for
the brain us and
Put together for the rest of us
thank you Mr.
I'm sorry thank thank you kind
lady.
Thank.
There is a further debate the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative lane.

And I to have I have to two sons
and two teenage sons.
And the other representative
from Bernalillo reference.
All I just even just a.
A fraction of what they're
dealing with have been dealing
with them.
And I love that I love my son's
well for these entities are very
difficult things to discuss.
I do want to ask a question
about proper terminology so with
that in mind I want to ask a
question what are properly
phased phrases because I do
recognize that this is a very
sensitive issue so.
And I'm not medical experts so
we.
When we talk about the fact.
Of.
Of what we're discussing here
the feeding Mr speaker.
Do I refer to it as is that
right to die medical aid in
dying what what's the
appropriate through.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you for the question
It is referred to as medical aid
in dying.
Thank you Mr speaker.
so I if I understood this bill
correctly and looking at the
language.
The medical aid in dying would
only apply to.
If I am terminal.
And my doctor believes I have
six months or less to live is
that correct.
Madam speaker and gentleman
that's one of the components you
also have to be of have the
capacity to make the decision
and the the ability to make a
volitional
movement and action to ingest
pharmaceutical substance.
Thank you Mr speaker and any of
the I want to focus in on the
six month the so even if you do
not all the other things that
you mentioned gentle lady.
Mr speaker point although the
truth the doctor thinks maybe I
have twelve months to live I
would not be eligible under the
act that's correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
that's correct we use six months
expected
life expectancy to be consistent
with what the
qualifications are for hospice
and the definition of terminal
illness under hospice rather
than create a whole different
Academy of how you decide
terminal when are providers and.
medical care is used to that
parameter of six months for
hospice and no one knows Mr
speaker and gentleman
if that's an you know can
project an absolute.
But it's under normal
circumstances given the the
presentation of the particular
patient what would generally be
expected to be the life
expectancy.
Some don't live that long some
would live potentially longer
some people get on hospice.
Senator moving a little bit
longer but
Because there's never an
absolute ability to determine
the date of death I have the
time.
but we are consistent and what
is generally
the definition around terminal.
Mr speaker maybe I should just
about the technician I have arms
around to sort of the
underlying.
Optional for the need for this
bill as I understood it.
It is that I am from the
terminal of patients six or
fewer months eleven and the idea
is that.
I is an important human being
should be allowed.
a decision the state as to when.
My life would and.
The call medical aid in dying.
And to be able to go through
that process with the is that a
fair assessment.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes
that is a fair assessment.
Thank you Mr speaker and so with
that in mind if if if the if the
concept is to allow me to.
die with dignity and honor
Thomas human beings.
then I guess I'm struggling with
the six month and if on
terminal.
and I recognize the risk that
yeah maybe maybe I a lot of this
maybe I don't.
But if on terminal why do we
want to six months why don't we
say a year or why not this
period.
on terminal and and therefore I
get to make that decision and I
know the Mr speaker the gentle
lady from Bernalillo referenced
off this but it seems like the
underlying underlying rationale.
She extended anytime that I
receive that Senator Gallegos.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
actually really appreciate that
perspective and the first time I
introduced this bill I had it
more broadly and not limited to
six months.
However it this is consistent
with every other
medical aid in dying legislation
in the in the country there are
other countries Canada doesn't I
think I'm not mistaken more
broadly and there are
individuals who have testified.
That have a.
Conditions such as ALS that will
be at some point terminal.
and they they wish to choose the
So it's it's a hard call
actually for me.
But it is this is the most
accepted way to do it and
probably the most.
Sure that someone actually is
terminal because they're that
far along in their.
In their disease
So we've opted for
The six month diagnosis.
Mr speaker I think the gentle
lady for her friend response I
think that's helpful in
discussions like the.
Particularly these these are.
The difficult and touching.
and emotional type discussion of
the impact so many people.
I'm new to the legislature said
I don't know what happened well
some of bills introduced but.
If I were to apply and I I would
suggest that the reason why
maybe there's push back the on
the six months Mr speaker
because we.
As a society tend to really
value life.
I I I recall.
After law school a court for
federal judge in Phoenix.
And I remember driving by a
street corner.
And there was an ambulance
providing medical care to a
person who's clearly transient.
And I thought what an amazing
place to live and.
That we as a country would offer
medical services to this
gentleman to early is never
going to be able to pay for it.
and at least in some segments
certain people like to just
discard those people but we.
As a society made a decision
that no we we value life we
value.
People regardless of their
utility.
And so I I I suspect that's why
you need to push back the on the
six month.
I'd like to ask specific.
Question Mr speaker I could turn
the gentle lady's attention to
section four.
Paragraph B. as in Bravo.
And also give the gentle lady to
a moment to Turner she would
probably let me know when she's
there.
Can you tell me what page that
is section four start
Yes.
The to the finest.
and and and and thank you thank
you I'm I'm there
Mr speaker and gentleman.
So Mr speaker generated aware
understand this whole section
and I'm looking for some insider
make sure I'm on the right track
is.
That if I don't have.
Or if maybe this man for the for
there's some question as to my
mental.
After the.
And are the.
Acting or just a fun work and so
I I understand the concept so
there's some question of my
after the.
I can receive a referral and
then paragraph B. says.
Mental health professional
determines individual to have
capacity to make in the licenses
after valuing Vigil during one
or more for the individual.
Mr speaker what I quite think
that language to mean is that if
there's a question as to my.
My mental capacity that this
referral to a mental health
professional and determined that
in fact I do have mental
capacity.
and and that medical
professionals opinion and
therefore I qualified under the
this act to receive inadequate
medical aid in dying.
Is that a fair understanding of
the section.
Mr speaker and gentleman and
just to be clear if there is any
concern about capacity or if the
person has a recent history of
mental health disorder or if
they have an intellectual
disability
they must be referred to for
for a mental health assessment
on regarding capacity and once
they're referred to this whole
process cannot move forward
until if and until a mental
health professional has
determined that they have
capacity and that may take time
it may be something in one visit
they are multiple conversations
but if they don't determine that
they have
capacity to make this kind of a
decision that the whole process
stops.
Mr speaker and.
I appreciate the clarification
of so like I was close but not
quite exactly on.
One of my concerns though with
this with this idea of the
referral is.
that the individual could be
found mentally keyboard after
only one.
Mr speaker commission within
walking through the rational.
Of course one visit it you know
there's no time frame as to how
long that wonder that would be.
And again this is an action that
that you can't reverse course
on.
once a minister the medical aid
in dying too much so that
there's no turning back.
Once the once the medication
except.
And so I just I'm concerned
about only one business.
Chairman to be determined
mentally capable.
You help me Mr speaker
generation understanding why
would allow only one visit.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman they will have more
than one visit with with the
provider for the capacity
evaluations specifically yes one
or more that that's too there's
no time limit on what that is or
how that is it may be very this
it may not.
Provider may be able to spend an
hour having a conversation about
it.
Or shorter depends on how it I
think that is
totally situational dependent
and I would say Mr speaker and
gentleman that determining
capacity to make sure that
informed health care decisions
is common practice.
those decisions are made all the
time that's when you turn to
your surrogate decision maker
because the person doesn't have
the capacity to understand the
informed consent
and and.
there are providers who are very
experienced in working through
an assessment to determine
whether they understand the
Areas north of decision and the
consequences and I understand
that in a really informed way
and that may be different person
to person so we did want to make
sure that it wasn't necessarily
just one visit that it could be
a continuum of this as.
Or full determination is.
Mr speaker gentle lady from
Bernalillo I I I appreciate
building in flexibility in the
loss and the lawyers of good
sense and good policy.
and I do recognize the this is
an area where.
Of these type of.
If you want to call
mental health screenings are
determined capacity at the new
happen routinely.
But the medicine that's being
administered.
under this act the medical aid
in dying administration or
anything but typical.
It is final and resolute.
And so I I just expressed some
concern with.
Languages that allow for a
single business of a person that
we we have maybe some question
marks about their their mental
capacity.
My next question is.
And this is I'm just trying to
sort of understand the practical
to the mechanics of this bill.
Mr speaker is.
If if a person
receive the medical aid in dying
under the act I get that
approval.
They went through all the steps
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
reference.
what happens is after that and I
get to a point where actually no
longer able to self.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
No.
Probably a third of people never
take the medication.
Having it and knowing that they
could
really is a great deal of
anxiety and suffering in and of
itself.
And if someone was still wanting
to take it but losing capacity
to physically do that
Then I I think that they would
either have foregone the
opportunity or they would go
ahead and do that before they
they finally lost and capacity
physical capacity to do it.
Mr speaker the way I understand
the the language in the bill is
this.
If I do qualify under the act
for Medicaid for medical aid in
dying but then a physically get
to the point where I cannot open
the stress I would.
It no one else is allowed to
step in and and administer that
to me is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct you have to take of
relational.
Conscious affirmative act to
ingest the medication.
Mr speaker.
Office is mentioned in the bill
a couple of times.
again part question does this
mean that if I receive the medic
medical aid in dying.
That I can actually receive that
in my home it doesn't have to be
stay in the hospital setting.
Mr speaker and gentleman it's
almost always at home no and the
experience in other states is
over ninety percent of the
individuals who partake in
medical aid in dying are on
hospice and receiving palliative
care.
so it's they're not mutually
exclusive we have mentioned that
in this bill
because that is one
affirmation by by
M. D. here DO of the terminal
illness so if you're in hospice.
you you may be able to skip you
know a second opinion on I mean
you still have to have to
providers determine terminal
illness but one of them has
already been determined by the
mere fact Bennett admitted to
hospice but everything else
still needs
to be affirmed and
There are many people don't take
it most people are on hospice
and I would also mentioned what
we're talking about hospice Mr
speaker and gentleman.
In in states that have legalized
medical aid in dying there is
actually a greater use of
palliative care and hospice
because the conversations are
opened.
Meet with individuals in their
positions are providers their
families.
and the part of the process of
this is that.
the the prescribing provider
must tell you about all other
options including hospice
palliative care
Any other options including
stopping eating and drinking or
or whatever options there might
be for managing the end of of
life.
And that those conversations
actually open up and expand
a greater use of
alternatives to this because
There those conversations are
started.
Mr speaker of the gentle lady
from Bernalillo and I we we keep
referring to the it.
Within the medical aid in dying
for another's practical
questions.
A number however having internet
issues for.
Mr speaker is that it is that is
that yield of someone takes
what's important and for
medication.
Mr speaker and gentleman thank
you for that question I think
that the medical practice of
this's has involved some over
time but it's a compounded
prescription that will
put you to sleep.
And the new password.
Mr speaker and at more than half
the question very well I just
meant like the liquid form of
the pill form what what did what
forms of the medical aid nine
eight.
Mr speaker and gentleman I think
it's usually dissolved and the
liquid it could also be and
follows on it could also be
done in a liquid state put
through a feeding tube if you
have a feeding to and you did it
that way there is
involving
masses for
similar to an animal to hunt for
rectally but it has to go into
the digestive system.
and cannot be an IV or
injection.
Speaker.
There was a comment made earlier
by the gentle lady from
Bernalillo that about a third of
the person who qualify under our
act.
Never in a administering the
medical aid in dying.
Mr speaker commission Andrew
point committee where in the in
the the bill.
It has some provisions to where
if.
Someone do not take.
The medication what happened to
that medication after the person
passes away.
Mr speaker and gentleman if if
the person happens to be on
hospice which again more than
ninety percent of of patients
that's experience in other
states are on hospice
the house the staff disposes of
medications upon the passing in
the individual and other
otherwise it would be and it
would be hard to legislate in
here responsibility for and.
Some other no person to do
something with it or how so that
would be an educational program
with from the provider or the
pharmacy about how to
appropriately disposed of
medication.
In that
that's common
and
In a number of circumstances
about providing appropriate
information about disposal of
medications.
Mr speaker and.
That whole conversation is the
highlight.
A real concern online.
which is what happened to this
it's a legal medication.
What happens to that leased the
medication is not administered
to the person who.
should be receiving a medical
aid in dying are I think
specifically of.
Of younger people with children
who have no appreciation for for
medicine especially if this is
something that's.
as the gentle lady from
Bernalillo sent something
offended ball into a liquid
form.
I have real concerns about this
medication still being
available.
And I know we can talk about.
Hospice has safeguards with
regard to medication and Anders
and her in home nursing care.
And all of these other state
courts but it I realized that if
we have the legislature also
need to build.
This chart in the text of our
bill.
Just for a process in place to
at least try to.
Four off any kind of of
awful action that could happen
because again to this medication
and for people.
And so with that in mind Mr
speaker I would move for
discussion health for equipment
number one to house bill forty
seven as amended.
And Mister speaker when you're
ready all right the two oh two
number.
With the two or two number
please.
Mr speaker it's point two two
zero zero three two point one.
Is going down gentleman who
explained the amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker and so this
would what I would do Mr speaker
is officially on page nine with
insert a new section six and
what the section six does that
point of the cover the scenario
that I discussed having a
concern over and and that is
what happens if we have.
These medications that are going
to be used and so what it says
is that if if if the medical aid
in dying.
Education isn't using intended
to be returned judiciary
pharmacy for disposal again the
idea of specially with regard to
children younger adults we want
to safeguard them against this
terminal medications.
The sponsor General misses a
friendly amendment.
Mr speaker this is not a
friendly amendment.
There is a discussion on the
amendment the representative the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative Montoya.
Thank you.
Mr speaker this gentleman from
Aztec.
In San Juan County of.
Mr speaker I yield to my
neighbor to the west.
Of the seven county.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
The I heard
most of your statement there I
was actually in in the in the
hallway and into some of that
but just briefly.
the.
The purpose of you of your
amendment it I understand it to
be.
That that after ten days.
That
If the if the person has that
has maybe change their mind.
that.
The the drugs the life ending
drugs go back I and I did hear I
am here for question I did hear
response
your your question from from the
response representative
Armstrong
And I understand that hospice
and hospice they would take
those.
hills bank but not all of the
patients were in hospice
Mr speaker and gentleman.
so is that the purpose is to.
Sure someone else I mean just as
some point if a person does
change their mind on there
there's nothing in the
legislation as currently written
that would.
because the the drugs to to be
returned maybe given out of the
hands of someone else maybe
another family member someone
who's.
Depressed or
not thinking properly at the
time is that Mr speaker and
gentleman that essentially what
your amendment does.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan so the concern that I
express is again witnesses and
This isn't your everyday her
ordinary medication this is
people Medicaid medication
that's designed to be fully but
still designed to.
And delightful and so because
that's what it's designed to do
and in fact what it does I think
we need to be really careful
about how we handle this
medication and that includes
providing safeguards to protect
someone from accidentally
ingesting it thank you that was
something else.
Thank you madam you know if it's
put in the with the form that
was just a call during.
Part of our job as the
legislature's objective to build
into are built into the text of
the legislation.
The safeguards for the horrible
including children for example
and so what this does after ten
days.
The person who qualifies for
medical aid in dying if they
have a health ministry to it
which one is is.
Cornejo internally about a third
of the time and that medication
need to be returned.
And even with hospice I mean the
gentle lady for very little said
about ninety percent are on top
of that so we can percent.
and all it takes is one
unfortunately and so this is the
time to just put some practical
safeguards employees participate
if.
If this medication administered
with a grenade for seventy two
year term.
Thank you Representative Eli
I want to tell a little story
myself ordered a couple stories
earlier today
had the
a friend a good friend of mine
that I work with.
Twenty years
on the thirteen year old son.
That
he and is friends one day
instant summer.
got in the medicine cabinet now
my friend's house.
And his.
They were down there were
thirteen years old we weren't
coming they were thinking it
through
they got of the medicine cabinet
and they found different drugs
that were there they don't know
what they were they didn't know
what they do is that they
thought they were gonna get the
a high.
And
these
are children
took
different medications in all
take the same thing and my
friend's son
and up in the of.
Near death situation.
he went into a coma for about
two weeks.
And when he came out of it.
We have lost.
Is entire ability to speak get
lost
his ability to all his motor
skills you could not could not
raise his arms the touches faced
with this and he could not walk.
and the.
The.
Over time he was my my friend
was holding his son would be
would never be able to walk
would never be able to do
anything from self couldn't
the family has and finally
functions could he could not
take care of themselves.
my friend did not give up on and
continued working with him.
And he has gained regained some
motor skills he is
Google is not
pretty he's Google is beginning
to do something for myself.
talk in
this is not a story.
Someone who in that condition
was.
wanting to end his life that
that's not the story I'm telling
here storytelling here is of
someone who got a hold of
district prescription drugs not
the ones that were meant to
analyze.
Of the person they were after
other things into this little
cocktail and individually and
it's going
and I I see your amendment.
As trying to to put in place
some sort of safeguard if the
person.
For whatever reason is choosing
not to go forward with that that
those drugs don't just.
end up there I mean it might not
make a person feel good that.
I thank you fees and and if if
if I'm you know maybe I'm
feeling better right now.
And.
I wanna hold on these drugs.
K. you know in two weeks I want
in my life and three weeks but
the problem is that those.
that was drugs become
potentially exposure to someone
else's fund and for.
It is that Mr speaker and
gentleman that that kind of
situation that I just described
the story that I told that's
kind of a situation you're
trying to
Maybe put some safeguards
around.
Mr speaker that that is exactly
what this language and help you.
You know for example within the
the main bill.
You have to be eighteen or older
in order to even qualify under
the staff for the medical aid in
dying and I think that's a good
thing but I think if we are
being honest the reason why you
can't
receive medically and dying
under the age of eighteen is
because what we have chosen size
if you're under the age of
eighteen you you can't talk.
consent to anything like this
because you know with the the
money in the Brandenburg totally
developed.
And you don't know how to
consent is not physically
possible.
And so yeah this is designed to
protect against that group that
you know as children we make
sometimes in Mexico with that
choice.
And what we want to do as
legislators and try to help
When those batch was amended
thirty nine not life altering
consequences.
And with the type of medicine
under this settlement medical
aid in dying.
That is exactly where this is a
life ending.
thank and I think we need to
build safeguards in the try to
protect the.
You do Mastech
I'm I was reading an article
today that that dates back to on
February eighth two thousand
nineteen when we were debating
this bill before one of this a
similar bill that before and
then the story in the journal
talks about a.
In a forty two year old man.
That
Was diagnosed with brain cancer
and was told you have nine
months to live.
And he ended up living ten years
on it wasn't I mean obviously
there are some efforts to stay
alive that
But he did try to commit suicide
along the way
and not not because of.
the pain.
But if he thought he was a
burden on his family.
I don't really want to focus on
him right now I am later on in
debate on this bill I I'm gonna
bring up the story but the.
The the family members
Around a person who is terminal
we we've heard some of those
stories and how heartbreaking
they are and how people are.
They suffer from depression and
and and anxiety and.
you Mr chairman live ten years.
At a prevent prescribed drugs.
And.
Have not taken a.
Throughout that time there were
some hard times in his of his
life in with his family.
And the depression and the is IT
and the other things along with
the folks who are the family
members as has been described.
The the idea that a family
member who has those bills are
house those drugs whatever they
are.
that are available it is
potential to someone else.
Could take those and.
obviously somebody who's given a
terminal diagnosis
doesn't just really die within
the prescribed amount of time
spent stated Rush Limbaugh died
earlier this week.
And he was diagnosed with
terminal cancer over a year ago
he was given several months to
live.
he took those several months
into a coma.
almost an extra year
so.
in in in in those instances I
just described Mr speaker and
gentleman
I think that.
Removing those drugs from just
being there.
For all I know that just open on
on that stand and not even
necessarily in a.
In the medicine cabinet but
the building.
If if the safeguard that you're
suggesting the speaker usual
place
thank you see that the referees
the unintended consequences of
someone else taking in.
is could be changed so speaker
and gentleman I I thank you.
What you're.
That.
Yes we don't want to do is just
make it easier for people who
are.
Who are not terminal who are
not.
The intended person
to end up with these with these
drugs they're not the person to
procreate and issues so thank
you for bringing this bill
forward.
This number forward
Representative Eli thank you Mr
there is further debate on the
amendment the gentleman from
Bernalillo Santa Fe Torrance and
Valencia Representative McQueen.
Thank you Mr speaker of the
speaker gentleman does the
German you know.
Mr speaker I gladly nailed the
gentleman from Bernalillo Santa
Fe Torrance Valencia thanks for
putting that up above that's
easier for me to find the
county.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
This is a lease the third time
I've heard this bill.
It's a difficult bill.
I've been around long enough
that I heard testimony from Liz
was why feel.
this year we heard testimony
from Mr Armstrong.
In her testimony for many
others.
And I don't know if they're
still.
I heard testimony from local
ones including members of this
house.
Whose whose relatives went
through this.
And something I've heard
consistently throughout that
testimony.
Is the sense of comfort.
Knowing that this would be an
option.
Mr speaker tell.
They don't know that they want
to use it.
But they wanted to be an option.
Mr speaker gentleman with this
amendment would do.
We do take that option.
Think that since a Cup comfort.
In that light on it.
And it's preposterous.
Imagine.
Internal.
Not knowing how long you're
going to live.
But knowing you only have seven
more days for your drugs before
you have to send it back.
For three more days or now it's
two.
Got to make that decision.
Or have to send them back.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
I guess I understand what you're
trying to do in terms of.
Controlling the drugs so they
don't get into the wrong hands
and I could see a provision.
Where once the individual
passed.
If they had not use the drugs
there is a procedure for
disposing of.
But that's all of the students
Mr speaker German this is
putting a burden.
One does not need a bird.
You Mr speaker and gentleman I.
As I said I understand.
Your stated concern.
But I don't think this is a
through.
Thank you Mr speaker gentle.
These are for the debate on the
amendment from the speakers for
I cannot tell so there's anyone
that is wanting to talk on the
amendment.
Representative Ezzell you can
hear me.
I'm looking for whether any
further debate on the amendment.
This.
Sorry.
Representative from Bernalillo
Representative Thomson.
You Mr speaker will the
gentleman yield.
Mr speaker and let me know to
the gentle lady from Bernalillo.
Thank you madam Representative
the representative from Santa
Santa Fe who spoke just before
me brought up my concerns.
This this medication is for
peace of mind.
It's for.
Knowing that you're not going to
be at home for rent just paying
as you guys.
And and as he stated Mr speaker
and gentleman you have added the
weight of the world on to this
person's shoulders.
Okay I have ten days I mean it
may be that I still have another
five months the are fairly good
life ahead of me.
But now I'm going to have to
decide within ten days if I want
to take that risk.
That is totally unfair and I
find it downright cruel.
That we would ask someone to
make that decision perhaps one
it's not time and I think about
what's under my own kitchen
sink.
What's in your bathrobe we have
deadly chemicals all around us.
Why is this so much different
than those other deadly
chemicals that we have under our
state that we have in our job
that we have everywhere why is
this so much so much more Gary
to you than those other
chemicals that someone could get
into a guy just as easily and
much more painfully are yet.
Mr speaker I think there is a
misconception of this is that
the man is not a one fight at
the apple so if I receive the
medicine medication for the
medical aid in dying.
And maybe I do want to wait for
months
there is nothing to prohibit by
returning or having someone
return that whoever filled my
prescriptions.
Every ten days to get another
prescription this is not a one
bite at the apple.
There's no limitation in the
either the amendment or the tax
the bill itself.
That says you can only go
through this process one point.
And so yes I I can see the
weight that's been brought up.
By the gentle lady from
Bernalillo
but I reject the premise Mr
speaker that this is the one
bite at the apple there's
nothing to preclude this
prescriptions being refilled
like any other prescriptions
that that requires you filling.
And again the idea is to try to
protect them from being.
wrongfully and just because it
is with a it is lethal
medication.
Mr speaker.
Let's say one of my on my bucket
list is a cruise around the
world in my last six months but
I I I don't know how long I'm
going to have so I go on my
cruise and I am breaking the law
by take that medication if my
cruise is more than ten days or
let's say I want to go to to or
again to visit my favorite
cousin and I want to go spend
two weeks there does that mean
that I have to go without my
prescription or does that how is
that good I mean that hasn't
been thought through at all Mr
speaker and what will happen to
me if I don't turn again in ten
days.
Mr speaker so this is not the
time to be punitive Health
real text remember third there's
nothing in of a fugitive.
It is again up to the
legislature simply saying.
there needs to be something in
place in the bill itself.
That would have this this the
full medication returned
again the hotel or the place.
Mr speaker and gentleman what's
the let's say that I I have six
months to live and I live six
months you know how many trips
that is back to my prescriber
and back to the pharmacy for
this medication that could be
eighteen is that really what we
want to have people who are in
their final days doing.
Mr speaker again these are folks
that have the prescription
filled
there's not there's not a
requirement to build up the the
person who is
going to be receiving medical
aid in dying has to be the
person that goes to the pharmacy
rob the directly from the
pharmacists are the for this
bill.
So okay and and folks in the
situation of what the
prescription to be filled and
other people pick them up and I
don't see Health I'll on that
create difficulties.
And Mr speaker and gentleman
what if I can't afford to keep
getting a new prescription every
ten days.
Mr speaker additionally I think
that brings up an interesting
question how does this
medication get paid for it all
what is the costs going to be
you know those are questions I
would love the answer.
Mr speaker and gentleman I I
don't have the answer to that
but I I will guarantee you that
insurance companies are not
going to want to to spoiler
prescription every ten days and
and pay for it to be refilled I
I don't know if insurance will
cover this if it does they will
not cover it eighteen times so
it can be thrown away.
Mr speaker and gentleman you
have an answer to that.
Our service writers.
Is I just thought it was a big
question and whether they were
insurance reporter what Mr
speaker and gentleman have you
taken that into account with
your amendment.
Mr chair representative
transferring you.
Are you asking whether the
insurance company would.
Be willing to pay for in your
scenario eighteen refills.
Correct.
Mr speaker generated I you know
I I don't know the answer that
because again we don't know
what on that occasion and.
I do find it interesting that
for attaching a dollar value to
live.
and again this is just to put
safeguards in place.
Mr speaker and gentleman we are
I am not putting a dollar value
on line I am putting.
Peace of mind.
At the forefront that's what
this is about Mr speaker and
gentleman.
Because a lot of the reason that
people do this is just to know
that if it gets to the point
where they can no longer handle
the pain that they will have a
piece all the way out and what
you are doing is throwing as
many roadblocks as you could
possibly find in front of that
peace of mind including how my
gonna pay for this Mr speaker
and gentleman a funeral is very
expensive we're spending every
penny for the funeral that we
know was coming and now all of a
sudden we're going to have to
pay every ten days for new
prescriptions I just find it
incredibly cool and not out at
any link and with that Mr
speaker I will stop because this
is making me very angry thank
you Mr speaker and gentleman.
We'll go to the gentle lady from
Bernalillo as.
There is this is a roll call
vote there is a motion to table
the amendment
voters may our test is available
to table the amendment and we
will go back to the bill a vote
of no then we will vote on the
amendment itself.
Is now open.
It was.
Thirty seconds.
Is now closed however unlike the
clerk to call the absent
members.
Representative black.
Representative Fajardo.
Representative Garcia.
Representative Lundstrom.
What is now closed the man is
table by a vote of forty three
in the affirmative twenty three
in the negative Representative
when you still have the four.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Of all all the Spanish with the
closing costs.
Okay I do recognize that this is
the.
This is an important issue from
commissions on but I also think
that the government has an
interest.
And our senior citizens survive
for and continue find
to society and so I think
there's a lot of practical
concerns that I expressed
through the season with this
particular bill and for those
results and in opposition thank
you Mr speaker for the debate on
the bill of the representative
she said the gentleman from San
Juan Representative Strickler.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
General gentlelady from
Bernalillo county please yield.

gentleman from San Juan.

he had about he had a by pass
surgery
well yeah maintenance first
major heart attack when he was
in his thirties and we have a
lot of people in our our our a
this wonderful body that are in
their thirties and I it is hard
for me to imagine that you had a
major heart attack at age thirty
five and the E. A. would in
because a lot of damage to his
heart.
In a.
we had a rushing to the hospital
in Austin and my mother that
time didn't didn't know how to
drive so I just got my driver's
license I was sixteen years old
and we had to rush to the
hospital and I was so nervous
and I was a experienced driver I
actually hit the guard rail on
interstate actions that shows
you how hello worried I was so
we got to the hospital not to
the room where my dad was and
and she and the doctor met with
this Dr low and tell my mother
tell me the bad news to he just
one gonna make of their needles
all over the for a taken into
the
the emergency room of the
intensive care and and all I
could do this for.
Since you're here lord.
State Monday.
Thank you.

such a good man.
And I won't losing so selfish
prayer but it worked I got on
the elevator wasn't allowed to
be on that elevator somehow got
on there to the.
to the merged into the into some
care and I heard some medical
personnel was saying you know
this man was gone you have a
chance.
No Williams going to survive yet
another hard you know another
heart attack.
Analysts and came back.
So I knew my prayers were
answered.
And the in and I was fortunate
he was in his early forties at
that time like forty forty two.
still very young you have to buy
a get emergency bypass surgery
and he had an aneurysm size of a
grapefruit that was repaired and
and in the point I'm trying to
make you see a tremendous will
to live.
and in it he instilled that in
in the in my mother's well my
mother also died young she was
sixty eight she and inflammatory
breast cancer
She's on chemotherapy in she
suffered from from that illness
so for three years and she had a
true tremendous strong willed up
to live excuse me.
And enables suffered.
they both the experience thank.
And I think we with them every
step of the way and they they
showed such grace and mercy that
they were witness to me

time comes.

you know you never know when our
time comes I hope that that
honest brave and strong as they
are they have great medical care

South Pacific you sing a lot of
action he is
His ship help help the thank you

advises me on the set of very
very tough issues and I and and

petty Jennings I think no she

with with with cancer in the
state since it's not very very
pleasant for sure so
Else to say

One point one to make a two
years after my dad died

may very very cool story me was
kind of shocking story she told
me that that I love so much
Leonard thank you Mr Clark.

when I got in trouble he said
now with me and he cancel maybe

the more disappointed when I
found out two years after he
passed away thank you he wasn't
my actual day he was my doctor.
The he met my mother at their
place of business and and I was
like eleven months old and they
fell in love in the state a
merry nine months later I was
left alone was eighteen months
old and he adopted me and it the
best thing that my natural
father did for me was to give me
up for adoption so my dad could
do that so he kept it the you
felt that the kept that quiet in
a
in in may may appreciate him
even more.

purpose to
you know.
Appreciate life and and to
respect life and
I just want.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and thank you gentle lady
in all when my remarks.
There is further debate the
gentleman from currency
Representative Crowder.
Thank you Mr speaker the gentle
lady from Bernalillo please you.
Mr speaker I I'd gladly yield to
the gentleman.
Thank you gentle lady I.
Think it seems like this debate
is is filled with very very long
said stories and then
I agree with your opening
comments this is incredibly
difficult for small.
of similar to the colleges
spoke.
Have a had a mother that lives
in a nursing home for sixteen
years.
And I watched many many of her
roommates passed away in the
sixteen years.
I was at my mother-in-law's
bedside she passed.
I was holding my mother's hand
when she passed in October.
And so I've been there when when
a lot of really good good people
have passed.
but there was an event that took
place in in my mother's fast
last.
Six months.
The
have formed a strong opinion and
then and I watched as COVID
nineteen at the nursing home
where my mother was.
And we were locked out my sister
in sixteen years have probably
not miss two or three days being
with my mother.
She was there every day.
I was there as often as I could
be but my job to be way quite
often.
But when they locked us out with
COVID.
My mother begin to decline
rapidly should begin to lose
weight.
She began to refuse or
medications.
She began refuse our food.
Intention declined very quickly.
We reached a point where they
allowed us back into the nursing
home because they classify my
mother is in need of life.
An amazingly when my sister and
I got back into that building.
My mother begin to do and my
mother begin to take her
medications and my mother got
strong again.
And she did well until there was
another epidemic in the nursing
home and we were locked out
again.
And my mother decline.
We went through that two or
three times.
Until the final time we were
locked out.
They called me one Saturday
morning and I happen to be in
the parking lot of the nursing
home when the call.
Instead I think you better come
mothers at the in.
When I walked in.
My mother was down to about
ninety pounds she was a pretty
big woman when she raised her
kids.
In and I held her hand is our
heartbeat has lost the.
And I watched her pass.
But my mother.
New Mexico where she would go
when she died she had no doubt
about it.
She never complained.
And I think her fate.
Kept her from hearing or ever
asking for any assistance.
With the payment issue felt
going through the whole process.
And her strength as.
For districts within millions
this is built a faith with the
name.
Just like my colleague said I I
believe in life from from the
moment of conception and till
the natural death.
And I believe that's an
honorable thing.
But the one thing that I did get
to observe as I watched a lot of
her roommates pass.
Was that there was a.
It was a great deal of pain at
times.
Doctors are very good to issue
pay medications to to mediate
the pain to the best of their
abilities.
And
Often wondered how some of the
Medicare patients are Medicaid
patients in that in that nursing
home how they paid for the Mets
and and how they handle all
that.
And I learned just this evening
the in California Oregon.
But the insurance companies.
Of those two states which have a
statues very similar to what
we're examining tonight the bill
we're looking out house bill
forty seven insurance companies
have begin to withhold pay
medications.
Because they have been
classified declared
terminal and and they just have
a few months in those states
have the ability to to.
prescribe the end of life
medications.
And so with that in mind gentle
lady I would like to propose
house floor amendment number one
to house bill forty seven.
to house to bill the two oh two
number Mr speaker.
It is two two zero.
Zero to three point one.
Has been passed down.
Gentleman to explain the
amendment.
Thank you Mr speaker Mr speaker
it's just striking the the
number ten on line one of the
bill in certain number eleven.
On page line after line twenty
five insert the following new
section.
This says section seven is about
denial of insurance coverage.
News simply states and insurance
provider shall not deny coverage
to a qualified individual for
any medication used to treat a
terminal illness even if the
medication is used primarily for
palette to purposes.
And then not item three is to
remember the following sections.
And it's it's very simple we
just saying that the insurance
companies in the state of New
Mexico cannot withhold a
medications for chemotherapy for
for those type treatments simply
because they have been declared
end of life.
Our our.
Considering medical aid and
we were just checking to see if
the amendment has been posted
which it has is this a friendly
amendment I'm asking the sponsor
representative Armstrong.
Mr speaker this is not a
friendly amendment.
Our is in the building on the
amendment.
Representative San Juan a
gentleman from San Juan I'm
sorry Representative Montoya.
Thank you Mr speaker and the
Jennifer Jennifer curry yield.
Yes Mr speaker I yield to the
gentleman from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman
I I this was the one from the.
Because this does not do
anything to the body of this
bill it doesn't.
To.
K..
life in.
Drugs for
any question after going through
the process is that.
This bill.
Speaking at.
The.
Mr speaker.
That Phillis.
Just to make sure that insurance
companies could not.
B..
Can.
The commission or medications
that would expose.
The life.
Health care.
Yes.
Prior to this
this.
So.
That
The.
This country.
Where.
The.
Where by extending.
Medication has been withheld.
And that's just what has been
offered to this terminal
patients
this and now that they're in
pain increasing their life
expect expect content
expectancy.
Sure that.
Insurance companies.
Making a decision as to.
The world.
To provide miles extending.
drugs or medications that help.
I'm not.
Changed Mr speaker and gentleman
was to fly yes.
It is not friendly.
This is a.
Business thing to.
drugs for processing center.
Or any of the provisions.
As it is currently written is
that correct Mr curry.
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan in your opening remarks
you you've commented that you
thought it would be a friendly
amendment and I will tell you Mr
speaker gentleman had I not
believe the same thing I would
not have cared.
I do believe that this simply.
Is an instruction to insurance
companies.
The if there is pain there are
the drugs and and
Medications the next in the life
provide comfort.
you cannot withhold those you
have to continue to provide
those this bill the this
amendment does nothing to change
of the qualifications for
medical aid in dying or for
fishing of those medications it
doesn't then the form that's
within the bill it doesn't make
any of those things.
The bill is is that clear as it
was presented simply instructs
the insurance come to pay for
pain medication invalid to
treatment for those that are at
the end of life.
I have a hard time believing.
That for.
In the.
That
But
insurance company.
Chemotherapy.
That that.
That has been given to folks.
At.
The stories of compassion Mr
speaker.
Asked
for compassion.
To the people who were
The.
Want to.
Not go through the pain.
Mr speaker and gentleman seems
like an opposite of compassion.
To not require.
medication or therapy.
That.
The insurance policies and bank
right now can I I can not
imagine.
Instance.
Saying that we.
Do
insurance companies should.
Eradication.
We're talking about right now.
I am just I'm shocked.
I'd.
Instance but for whatever the
the the the the lab that is
associated with this this is
something for whatever reason is
something that we can go with
high.
it
has to in this body has had to
vote on issues concerning
insurance question.
On this for Mr speaker and
gentleman what what we can
tell an insurance company but
they have to do.
Seen since I've been here for
this is my seventh year.
I have told insurance companies.
Have to find this you have to
find that
All kinds of parameters
on insurance companies will be
located in the state.
And Mr speaker and gentleman.
this.
Mr speaker and gentleman because
certain folks around the state
we were masks.
A face mask because of COVID.

The the terms of this cold was
used on some of the folks

There is for the debate on the
amendment representative from
Bernalillo Representative down
generally I'm sorry from
Bernalillo Representative
Thompson.
Speaker will the gentleman
yield.
Mr speaker I yield to the gentle
lady from Bernalillo.
Mr speaker and gentleman I would
direct your attention to page
ten of the bill line seventeen
and I will read it.
I'm local board ensure to build
nine park alter health care
budget that would otherwise be
available to an individual with
a terminal illness based on the
availability of medical aid in
dying or to otherwise attempt to
influence an individual with a
terminal illness to make or not
make a request for medical aid
in dying.
Mr speaker and gentleman were
you aware that was in there.
Mr speaker gentle lady I had not
read the.
So Mister speaker and gentleman
will you withdraw your
amendment.
A gentle lady if you'll allow me
a few minutes to read that and
and the state the context of it
I will get back with you just a
second Mr speaker and gentleman
Unless you I will hold my my
question.
We will come back to the
representative from Bernalillo
Representative from curry Baca
Guadalupe Roosevelt and San
Miguel county Representative
Zamora.
Thank you Mr speaker.
And thank you thank you for let
me.
I.
Make a statement instead of us
of the representative from curry
my neighbor.
A question because he's busy
trying to read up on that catch
up on that.
Mr speaker I yield.
Mr speaker will the gentleman
yield.
This.
I I yield to my good friend and
neighbor.
Mr speaker.
You know we all have a story to
tell.
We've all been through the
situation.
And.
I believe that the amendment
that my neighbor from curry if
is trying to put or is a good
amendment.
That we shouldn't give the
insurance companies a chance to
make this a pro for profit.
Decision.
I'm glad that the
representative.
Representative Thomson brought
this up.
And and that it is in the bill.
And and I'll I'll just send a
statement there.
And the.
See how this how this plays out
with with the Representative
Crowder thank you.
Representative Crowder gentleman
from curry.
Are you ready to proceed with
the question from Representative
Thomson the gentle lady from
Bernalillo.
Mr speaker after reading
Address the online seventeen on
page ten I would withdraw money
and.
Withdrawn
now back to the bill there is
further debate on the bill
Representative from Lee I'm
sorry the gentleman I keep doing
that it's late the gentleman
from lady Representative Scott.
Ladies and gentleman.
Mr speaker lady from Bernalillo
reveals please.
Mr speaker I am gladly yield to
the gentleman from Lee.
generators is this really is a
tough one our current.
Just a couple of questions.
Concerns.
Is the issue of coercion.
And.
I think everybody will
administrative the state of
time.
For years.
Mannitol or brought.
As close as they used to be.
And.
Early person.
With a close relative.
We're listening next of kin.
Perhaps across across the
country.
Thank you so much.
Thanks.
Would not.
Their best interests at heart.
To address their concerns.
and gentleman that is certainly
something that we would not want
to have fun and I would address
that in a couple of ways
currently is
pretty easy for families to step
in and make decisions for.
for someone if they've been
given authority by the I
individual in in this
bill we specifically say that
the the prescriber is affirming
they don't believe that is the
case.
And it has to be witnessed by
two people affirming that they
don't think there is coercion
going on
and at least one of those
witnesses have to be a totally
disinterested party.
So
we have I think tried to address
that to the extent that you can
Affirm that someone isn't isn't
being coerced but again the
individual Mr speaker and
gentleman he has to make the
making this decision volitional
only and the found money with
capacity to make the decision.
informed of all options
has seen a couple of providers
who and to the best of their
knowledge and ability to
ascertain is not under coercion
and the witnesses
at least one totally
disinterested witness affirming
the same belief.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
With particular.
Emphasis on the elderly.
Which many times can be
persuaded to say this.
One was to protect you.
In the.
And he if you will of the total.
Possible.
The next.
With gentle persuasion.
Gentle persuasion complaints.
Please.
Some of these poor elderly
folks.
Perhaps.
Thank you and of course
medications.
Was.
Mr.
and gentleman I think any
elderly person of sound mind has
as much ability to have making a
Thomas decision about their
health care as anyone else I can
tell you Mr speaker and
gentleman I certainly couldn't
push one thing or another of my
ninety three year old mother
who is probably sharper than I
am so is is is not an age
related ability to make a
decision I would for the same Mr
speaker and gentleman at most
individuals and facing terminal
illness facing any crisis in
their family consult with their
loved ones as they make a
decision about what they want to
do.
And so the fact that someone may
have a
a conversation with family who
is supportive.
Is not an indication that
they've been coerced or nudged.
I will be supported in my
daughter's decision.
and conversely Mr speaker and
gentleman.
I've seen that many
circumstances where family
are not ready to let go.
And our of feeling guilty and
they pressure
if you will the their family
member to hang on to fight
harder to try harder into and
and to not succumb so I think it
is.
Goes both ways HB and what a
family would like for an
individual
but age is not a relevant factor
in an ability to make a decision
for yourself and your own health
care.
Thank you.
Mr speaker gentle lady I worked.
The competitive issue with that
because it is well documented.
At early or susceptible to all
manner.
for example telephone scams.
I would have been to twelve all.
The younger and and for
possession of their faculties
but.
Representative waterpark.
Three.
Want to the end of life
medication is administered which
many times will occur at home.
In order to testimony.
Of her to provide.
Mr speaker and gentleman whoever
that individual wants to be
there with them.
So Mister speaker gentle lady is
there's no requirement for them.
Please the lowest wants dissent
restrict people.
For a.
Thanks.
Or any requirements what.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct there's no requirement
about who you choose to have
with you when you're done.
Mr speaker gentle lady let me.
We try.
To my previous one of the group
were asked.
Loved ones are.
Not necessarily have to finish
to interest.
Of the patient.
At the top of their minds.
Is that a question on gentleman
Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes
it is.
What would the consequences be.
Of a person at home in rural.
With people.
The only interested.
In the best interest of the
person.
Order longevity for whatever
reason.
The.
Income tax benefits or want to
give.
Back to Mr chair from.
Consequences.
Mr speaker and gentleman I
assumed by your question this is
someone who is already requested
and received it has in their
possession
the medication.
Mr speaker gentle lady that is
correct.
Thank you a gentleman Mr speaker
and gentleman my answer to that
is they have already made an
informed decision that was of
their
of voluntary request and has
been affirmed eligible and
competent to make the decision
and therefore they have the
medication.
Mr speaker gentle lady all.
I.
Where it is our last question
this is been program.
Thank you to rex Lee.
In the.
I just wanted to focus.
On.
At that question would deal with
the security.
This material.
Is going to be administered.
The prescription was a locked
box or.
How is this.
Going to be secured and.
Is going to be responsible.
For the security of your.
and gentleman I would answer
that by saying our homes are
filled with
often filled with medications or
is the gentleman from
Bernalillo Senate other
chemicals that are that are
potentially lethal most hospice
patients and I worked in hospice
Mr speaker and gentleman that my
experience in that is that they
have
a lot of medication available
that in the wrong hands would be
could be potentially lethal we
don't regulate how they maintain
their medications and their home
whether it's hospice or whether
it's any other condition
including chemotherapy that
could be
lethal in the wrong hands and
taken in the wrong way this is
no different we shouldn't have
to treat it any differently
there is no policing of people's
homes and how they store handle
their medications or the
chemicals under their sink and
so then there's no difference
here Mr speaker.
So Mister speaker gentle lady.
Basically there are no
requirements to keep material
secure.
Mr speaker and gentleman there
are no extra ordinary
requirements to keep this
medication any more secure than
you would keep any on the other
thing that you have in your
house that needs to be kept
secure we don't write down and
loss and it's not written in law
here.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
for your answers.

And that within nine months they

And it would be it would be at

And
the story goes on to say that.
The.
No just was right about one

That the pressure sometimes on

Depression.
Someone makes that choice.
so Mr speaker and and and and.
So that some of the protections.
Are are better.
From from
low I do appreciate
some of the safeguards that have
been put.
but Mr speaker and gentleman
But.
For some for a for a medical
professional to be brought in.
As if and doctor or a nurse
practitioner or a physician's
assistant makes a determination
about whether or not they think
there's a problem.
Mr chair that the nurse

for.
In Austin passing after.
have a necessary that training
to.
If someone is really just
depressed.
Mr speaker and gentleman if.
there might be some pressure or
collision behind the scenes so.
offering.
On this
but I want to see if we could
add one more protection for the
person.
That is requesting life ending
drugs and that is to
say something the where that is
currently not there.
A very specific and definite
second.
From a.
health professional.
And the purpose for
professional.
Is to determine a couple of
things that quite frankly and
and.
Osteopath or someone has just in
the field
Not be able to understand.
This will not be able to ask the
right questions or get to the
truth of the matter is whether
or not this the person
requesting.
Drugs not just depressed for.
Following like a.
It's a little better on their
family and their family a favor
or if it on the other side of
that spectrum.
They're being pushed towards a
decision.
And so Mister speaker and
generated a lot of produce a
house amendment one.
House bill forty seven as twice.
Mr speaker and gentleman to
attend institutions zero.
Zero to.
On.
Just wanted to make sure is of a
website.
Has been distributed.
Maybe some from the website and.
And to explain his amendment.
Put some place a second opinion
for.
To health professional.
Specifically to determine
whether or not.
there's any corrosion by a
family member or someone
encouraging the.
Attention this suicide.
Mr speaker it would also help
with determining capacity
whether the person
is
Of making that determination and
Mr speaker Sir thing is.
To make sure the person is not
making a decision based on
depression rather than of the
other things not that if you're
terminally would not be.
very upset about it but that's
that.
we're not dealing with someone
who just clinically depressed.
With that Mr speaker and stand
for questions.
Our first we're gonna sponsor
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Armstrong is this
a fund management.
Thank you Mr speaker this is not
a friendly amendment and I would
like to explain why if I can.
Do you have the floor.
Thank you Mr speaker
a couple of reasons why this is
not a friendly amendment
capacity is as defined in this.
Statute it refers to how a
capacity is to provide a
determined how it's determined
in
uniform health care decisions
act.
And.
There is a
This this is done every day
providers to all the time in
determining informed consent and
the capacity to determine
whether someone is making that
decision.
Yes they need to be referred
they are if they need some
additional referrals it the
provider themselves can already
decide that they are not
sufficiently compact have
decisional capacity or are being
forced and doesn't have to refer
them anywhere it doesn't have to
prescribe.
But this is consistent with how
health care providers of all
time and this is fully within
the scope of practice of any
position
or or nurse practitioner PA
industry turning whether someone
is has the capacity to make I
understand the seriousness of
their decision and indeterminate
so by inserting a mandatory
referral
I think you are just it is just
creates another barrier
to receiving the assistance that
someone is is asking for.
Okay.
thank generating there is debate
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
Representative Hochman Vigil.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
and I'm I'm sorry I'm having
been with problems too so I
don't know if I'm on camera not
but
Mr speaker on gentlemen
From San Miguel I I heard kind
of a continued theme with many
of these amendments presented on
the bill throughout the night
and what I'm hearing although I
can understanding knowledge of
the point trying to be made what
I'm hearing under the underlying
these points is a lack of trust
Mr speaker a lack of trust in
these patients who are facing
the end of life and mass the
decisions as to how they are
going to approach the end of
their life and a lack of trust
in the physicians and healthcare
providers who are assisting with
this process.
Many of these issues are already
prescribed as part of medical
ethics requirements in our laws
they're already there and we
also need to have a trusting the
process that's been outlined in
this bill we have great
definitions of a terminal
illness which means a disease or
condition that's insurable and
irreversible that will result in
the end of life is depression
probably part of that process Mr
speaker I can tell you for both
my parents absolutely was.
But that's.
Part of dying.
And as I've stated before.
Life part of dying is part of
life.
And if we continue to stir up
unnecessary roadblocks we're
just going to prolong pain.
And the entire point of this
bill has always been not to kill
someone or not to give them the
ability to kill to make a
decision and their lives B.
because of the various issues
that they're facing but it's to
give someone a choice this bill
has and always will be about
choices there's another
underlying theme for the night
Mr speaker and gentleman from
San Juan and that's autonomy
autonomy over our own bodies.
Antani to make our own decisions
Antani is very much included as
part of this bill as is
compassion and choices and so
Mister speaker I would I would
conclude my comments on the
amendment we need to trust trust
patience trust the providers
trust the requirements as part
of this law they're already
prescribed in this law both of
both the informed consent clause
and also in our your definition
of terminal illness and with
that are very important thank
you Mr speaker.
For the debate on the amendment
the generating from Santa Fe and
Bernalillo Representative Lord.
Thank you Mr chair
does the Representative from San
Juan County yield.
Yes you to the generated from
Bernalillo and Sandoval Santa Fe
thank you Mr speaker so.
I have this bill in my committee
and one of the issues I have are
some of the things that you do
bring up so thank you all.
I'm sorry but to be done.
Sorry.
I'm.
What I noted is that there is no
special training from the
physicians and this is something
that bothered me greatly because
when we have something that is
that important you may go to
your GP but they're gonna refer
you to a urologist or they're
gonna for for you to orthopedic
doctor
did you bring this important
because you did you notice that
there was no specialty training
for any of the doctors.
Mr.
That is exactly why is no
effective improvements comments
with that that
doctors already have within
their scope of practice some of
this decision making with
respect generating prior to now
not have these doctors
prescribing end of life.
Drugs so.
Right it doesn't at least maybe
someone who.
it has expertise to actually
deal with this very specific
questions doctors within their
scope of practice
have for had to determine
whether or not a phone.
The court single and current
need someone in their life and.
To the point of the timing.
Was it just a couple of years
ago with the last two years with
that red flag bills.
That.
Jewel.
Consider.
In society and say.
They.
Are a danger to themselves or to
others.
I.
We were going to deprive them of
their civil rights
in this instance Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
That that this to me.
It is worthwhile.
But.
If.
Since the nation was thinking
about taking their life.
In that instance.
Instead because apparently was
with a gun.
As.
If they want to do it in another
fashion.
Your body and choice.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
Representative that was kind of
something also came to my point
to when it came to the economy
it seems that we have a Tanami
for this but we don't have
autonomy for gun ownership or
the same thing when somebody
wants to commit suicide I'm here
with the red flag bill if it was
done with a gun that was wronged
and we needed to immediately
take the guns away from people
so to continue on with this Mr
speaker.
Again I'm deeply troubled about
that if you go to a doctor there
will for you for acne to a
dermatologist but yet we're not
gonna refer someone for this
huge enormous decision.
To end their life and I'm sorry
but I worked for doctors for
very long time and they are not
trained in this there's no way
that I would trust every single
medical doctor with this and not
to say they're not great doctors
because with some amazing
doctors but what I'm concerned
about is they're going to get
somebody and not know how to
deal with this and to place that
on them and not give them an out
by saying you know what we just
want to go the next step and
have you go to somebody who is a
specialist somebody who at least
had a weekend training course on
this.
Bob is very very bothersome to
me
my question is.
What what I what I also worry
about is if someone goes to the
doctor Mr speaker and
representative how do we really
know how does that drive noted
ten minute visit whether they're
being coerced or not.
That was my point of that the
whole purpose of my and then
just to make sure that the
person a person a.
Health professional the.
psychiatrist psychologist at the
very least Mr speaker and
generating counselor.
Always have to ask those
questions.
Questions prior to that a
medical doctor certainly a
physician's assistant or nurse
practitioner have never had to
deal with before.
that someone who
Can spot services and is able
to.
Ask the right questions could
get to the heart of the matter I
think for the sake of the people
who in the state.
That we would have that
protection for them.
Thank you Mr speaker
Representative and Mr speaker
that is this something that
again it bothers me tremendously
about this bill and the main
thing that bothers me about this
bill is that they're not going
to see somebody the specials are
not going to see anybody who has
any special training and I think
I don't see it as a roadblock I
see it is taking an extra step
to care for these people and
make sure it's just not a
momentary.
Part of their life for their
suffering from some sort of
depression and maybe if they
just talked it through a little
bit and I'm not saying it I mean
I'm not saying that that's going
to be all the case but I just
think it would be.
More compassionate.
To send these people to a
specialist or leased to a death
and dying doula they have death
and daily doulas you could
assign them to that is a doula
giver who would help this person
through this transition so I'm
very glad you brought that
forward I wanted to point out
something else to that also
applies to this ammendment that
was very troublesome for me in
this bill.
And this is one of the things
that bothers me the most besides
that that there's no special
training at all for the doctors
and there's no specialist and
there's no referral to someone
to a specialist.
it was on page eight and it's
somebody with the intellectual
disability.
Can.
Go through this process of
what's the word that they want
to see is I apologize.
Of this death and dying and when
they go through this medically
death and dying thank you.
Somebody that is intellectually
disabled.
And I brought this up.
Can go see a therapist.
One time.
And I asked is that person going
to be a specialist.
And I was told no.
And I don't think that is
compassionate either at all I
don't think that we should have
people that are intellectually
disabled going to see a life
coach.
Or somebody who doesn't have the
training to deal with these kind
of issues I think it's gross
negligence.
And I can tell you that I if I
had a child that was
intellectually disabled and I
found out that they want to go
see it there was one time I
would open up a lawsuit so fast.
So.
I want to thank you so much for
bringing this bill for this
ammendment forward I see we're
getting at it's all the same
things that I have that honestly
hurt my heart and I mean that
sincerely Owsley heart my heart
that they could just go see a
doctor forty eight hours get the
medication and be gone and there
isn't anybody there's no doula
covered there's no therapists
there's no specialist there's
nobody and somebody that is
intellectually disabled can go
to C. one therapist one time
without the correct training I
I'm sorry but I if.
That.
Hurts my heart.
And I I thank you for bringing
that forward and that's all the
questions I had about your
amendment thank you so much I
yield my time.
Thank you Mr speaker and I don't
think there's further debate the
gentleman from Representative
Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker.
I want you.
The gentleman from the county.
Speaker gentle.
This decision we're discussing
find.
Is portion.
And I think we're.
You're asking for which you're.
What
is more.
This
is not correct.
Mr speaker yes there there is a
second.
that is written into the
legislation about it
contemplates within the same
office that could be.
A doctor and another doctor in
the building or a doctor and a
nurse is a nurse practitioner
or physician's assistant it
could have happened literally I
believe in the same building at
the same time.
so Mr speaker I this is really
just asking for a a second
opinion from second paying
someone prying on the same
building who would be
prescribing the medication.
Stricker General Fund.
The gentle lady who spoke
previous years comments
resonated for.
Particularly with respect.
Training.
Act
respond require.
Specialized training.
For the characters will be
making these recommendations is
that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman as a
matter of fact it's been
described that somehow these
doctors within the current scope
of practice.
Are able to make some of these
determinations and as I stated
earlier
first asking doctors to
prescribe life ending medication
so I do not believe this is
something that that doctors were
considered part of their scope
of practice I think that the
speaker and gentleman I think a
lot of doctors.
Making a decision like that if
they knew that the individual is
also going to go and seek a
second opinion from a mental
health professional.
Mr speaker and gentleman.
The circle back to the question.
Of course.
We're sure

That number is a very pointed
out of the air I don't know that
the ninety percent is correct
but I would think that the
majority of families
towards their
the elderly or the infirm in
their family
have a
Have that compassion for the
families but speaker and
gentleman.
The same newspapers that I
watched the same night is that I
do and and people.
Are capable of some awful
things.
At.
the pressure of some sort
applied onto a member of their
families.
As a flying through their
inheritance because of all the
health care that they have the
expenses
that a what I'm talking about is
not unreasonable so also what
we're talking about here is not
to protect the vast majority of
people who will go through this
process for the reasons that
have been stated tonight.
And gentleman.
The guard rails up.
For you put up the fences let's
say that.
In the case.
That something might happen how
how how slight that possibility
is surrounded and.
Right now surrounded by a fence
that I don't think we've seen a
single protester at.
But there was a decision that
was made that on the outside
chance that there was an actual
threat.
That decision for ourselves.
We have that opportunity with
this amendment to make that same
decision for someone who is a
member of the state.
Looking into the future which is
a certain death.
And that is what this does it
puts up a fence to protect the
most vulnerable.
Mr speaker.
Share on us.
Do your chores for each.
Appropriate.
Because we have heard
over and over again.
These areas.
Let's.
Put up roadblocks to this issue.
The decision as reporters.
Thank you Mr Frank.
As a guard rail trenches.
The project through to what
would likely be.
Yes conclusion to to I should.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
for your.
Gentleman from.
Grant.
Would you for what purpose the
rise.
Mr speaker Mr chair intention
when you went to the gentle lady
from Bernalillo say one if you
could please give a brief.
Yourself Jennifer someone have
had about an hour the floor time
your party has had almost the
entire time on debate and we're
we have members of the other
party they wish to speak and I
had an opportunity to do so with
multiple amendments you have had
ample time to express your views
so we could have it be brief
that's fine I'd like to give an
opportunity to some other
members to speak about the bill
we do that do you think.
I don't recognize.
Thank you Mr.
Those are.
Thank you Mr speaker.
All the gentleman someone these
You.

is.
Being
At the end of the line.
Yes unfortunately you know but
it fortunately they actually
graduate out of hospice and so I
just feel that it's very
important for us to take a
second.
Of the one with the second
opinion.
Give the person an opportunity
to make sure that they're making
the right decision again as a
matter of a number of times we
have seen or I have seen where a
person thinks that it's the end
of the life your home based on
hospice.
And our people are still living
seven eight ten years later so
I just think it's a very good
point to bring the thank you Mr
speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker.

Thank you
I just like to say that everyone
has a story to tell.
And the story the way we we
understand makes sense of our
world.
In here in New Mexico
storytelling is at the heart of
our culture.
And the very powerful role in
installing of our history and
tracking down the wisdom of our
ancestors and help
misunderstanding.
Would you that differ from our
own.
And sharing our stories of the
hello.
And we've heard so many of the
stories today and I just wanted
to share one more
from committee General.
And it's about her father in
law.
Who main problem.
Public wrister with the way that
cancer was going to end his
life.
Probably diagnosed with an
aggressive cancer in February
just before he had is the
seventy ninth birthday.
Fortunately the cancer had
already spread to the bone.
The public died March eighth.
Twenty eighteen.
After suffering extreme bone in
that back pain difficulty
walking incontinence and
weakness throughout his.
Thanks for your body.
With a devout Catholic
grounded in faith.
The last moments of his life.
But he wanted to die peacefully
without suffering.
And this is not living.
He said please give me something
to stop the pain and my
suffering.
I strongly believe New Mexicans
in consultation with our family
doctors and thank you should
have the option for medical aid
in dying.
And the minority.
Forty eight New Mexico has a
long tradition of respecting all
people in our state our families
are using our elders.
And I understand that the end of
life option may not be for
everyone.
In the Catholic faith I respect
all other people's state.
I believe that we need to
practice empathy remind
everyone.
She meant to not pass judgment
before walking in another
person's shoes.
That is why support and
compassionate option.
Becoming available.
I thank you functions of this
bill and I stand quarter this
legislation to.
The only ill Mexicans don't have
to suffer.
And force are forced to die
painfully but instead can died
peacefully in the dignity thank
