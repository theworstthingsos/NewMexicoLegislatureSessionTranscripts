And the challenges, the changes
we need and the floor is yours,
Mister DA.
Madam Chair, thank you and to
the members of the committee,
thank you very much for the
invitation. I'm pleased to be
able to present to you.
Some of our thoughts at the
district attorney's office about
the juvenile.
Justice system.
Before I do, I wanna make sure I
take this opportunity to thank
you for the legislature, the
entire legislature for which you
all do every single day.
And obviously, I want to thank
you for the funding that you
provide our office and we're
putting it to good use. I can
assure you that.
Let me start off with somewhat
of a bold statement and just
tell you that it is my opinion
and you won't ever hear me say
this about the criminal justice
system in general.
But you will hear me say it
about the juvenile justice
system, and that is the juvenile
criminal justice system in New
Mexico.
is broken.
I did not say that lightly, nor
do I cast blame on anyone or
branch of government.
I say this based on what we see
every single day when it comes
to juvenile crime.
I can tell you overall that I
believe the adult criminal
justice system is starting to
see some progress.
juvenile crime.
is going in the absolute wrong
direction.
The Original Children's Code was
passed and signed into law in
1978.
The current Children's code,
which includes juvenile criminal
law was created, passed and
signed into law.
In 1993.
It's over 30 years ago.
Since 1993, the Apple phone was
invented.
The Internet was made open to
the public.
And the dark web with apps like
Telegram.
Have been invented.
There was no such thing as a
phone in 1993 that took
pictures.
And could immediately be placed
on social media.
And since 1993, there has been
no meaningful amendments to the
Children's Code to ensure that
our laws are changing with the
times.
And the issues that we see every
day.
Today, a 15 year old.
15 year old can be driving
around with his friends.
In a stolen car.
With 10 fentanyl pills.
An AR-15.
That juvenile 15 year old could
get arrested in Bernlio County.
And under the current system in
Bernlio County, the way it
operates.
That juvenile will face little.
No consequences.
And they know
You will not spend one single
night in the detention home.
He will likely be placed on
probation.
Where there's not even the
requirement under probation that
he continue his schooling or
that he has a curfew.
That same child will likely
continue his criminal behavior.
With little to no consequences.
Not until
Not until an only if.
That child commits a crime where
a firearm.
is discharged in the commission
of a crime.
Will he spend any time in the
detention home. Let me repeat
that.
Not until and only if the child
commits a crime with a gun.
In the commission of a crime,
will he spend any time
In the detention home.
I respectfully submit that
waiting till that happens is
simply
Too late.
When I was growing up in the
70s, and I don't think, well, a
few of you might have been
growing up in the 70s.
When I was growing up in the
70s, I messed up sometimes.
And there are always
consequences.
I learned that sometimes it was
by my, my parents, of course.
And I'm not gonna get into other
times, but.
I learned by those consequences.
That particular behavior was not
acceptable.
I raised 3 kids in the 90s.
Right here in New Mexico.
And when they messed up, there
were consequences.
I want our children who mess up.
Like I might have.
To learn the criminal behavior
is not acceptable. That is the
right moral obligation that we
should carry out for the
children of the state. Otherwise
we wait too long in their lives
to show them that there are
consequences.
In other words,
They commit a murder.
I charge them as the district
attorney with murder.
And we convict them of
first-degree murder.
And they spend the rest of their
lives in prison.
At that point, we as a society,
I believe, have failed the
victims of their crimes.
And the very children
themselves.
So I want to discuss juvenile
criminal justice and kind of in
three categories of the way I'm
gonna present this to you.
First, I want to give you some
stats about what's going on.
Then I'm gonna have my deputy
district attorney who's in
charge of my juvenile division
division. Troy Gray and I want
to mention something about Troy.
Troy has been a prosecutor for
24?
24 years
7 of which or so has been in the
juvenile.
Justice system, and he was in
the juvenile justice system back
in the early 2000s, and he's
currently the
Deputy district attorney in
charge of our juvenile division
right now, so he can talk about
the changes that he's seen in
the last
20 some years.
Um, and lastly, I want to give
you a handout it's the 2nd page
of the, of the, of the document
that you probably, I think have
been handed out. The second page
of that is specific aspects of
the Children's code.
That the challenges we face and
some of the changes we'd like to
see, and I give that to you.
Now I, I realized not anything
right this minute, but I, I want
you all to just be thinking.
And let some of those ideas, um,
he thought about by by the
legislature uh for the upcoming
60 day session.
Um, so, so, so let me just start
off with
I've given you a handout on the
front page.
I took this office as Burnleyo
County District Attorney just
over 18 months ago.
During that time,
And let's just start off with
the big number.
I've indicted 20 children.
For murder.
19 children since I've been
district attorney for first
degree.
Murder.
I believe that is absolutely
unacceptable, not the fact that
my office indicted them.
But the fact that 19 children
are accused of murder in the
first degree and there are 20
lives that are gone because of.
Children out there.
With
Not acting appropriately, I can
assure you the following though.
I can assure you that this was
not the first time these 19
children committed a crime.
But rather
It may be the first time
there'll be consequences for
their behavior.
And now, the consequences will
likely be life in prison.
That's the first time they'll
see consequences.
We currently have as of
yesterday, 61 juveniles in the
detention center in Bernlio
County.
Half are charged with murder.
61 in the D.
Half of them are charged with
murder and more than 90% are
charged with gun crimes.
There's no more room in the D
home right now.
I don't even talk about that on
the second page. I talk about
the children's code.
But I, I absolutely.
Um, would encourage the
legislature.
To, to look at
Our facilities, and I'm not
suggesting
That we should be putting
People, young people, children
who commit.
Lesser crimes if you want.
In with first degree murders or
those that are charged, but
We have to have some
consequences and there's not the
facility to do it now.
Since being district attorney,
January of 2023 is when I became
district attorney. We've had
1,221 cases referred to us for
prosecution.
Children.
In 18 months, 1,221, mostly
felony cases have been referred
to my office in just a year and
a half.
Of those 1,221 cases, 319
involved a handgun.
Today is July 1516.
17th.
88
This year alone.
88 cases have been referred to
us.
Involving a handgun.
And that does not include
All those instances where
AR-15s.
Or AK-47s.
Because
It's not against the law for a
16 year old to have an assault
rifle.
Apparently, we here in New
Mexico believe a 16 or 17 year
old.
As the good sense, good sense to
handle an assault rifle, but not
a handgun.
That is, that is an issue that's
addressed on the 2nd page, if
you will.
Um,
Speaking of children with guns
at this time, I want, um, Mr.
Gray.
Uh, to just give you a couple of
Stories or cases that he has
seen.
Um, recently.
For you all to to to to hear
what goes on.
In our
In Berlio County in the juvenile
criminal justice system. Mr.
Gray, that's OK, Madam chair.
Madam Chair, members of the
committee, thank you for the
opportunity to address this
buddy.
Um,
We did give some case studies
and I'm intimately aware of
these because I prosecuted all
three of these juvenile
offenders.
Uh, the first one isn't notes,
um, had two separate
indictments, both for shooting
at residences.
The first, he struck a young
person in the face, causing
serious and grievous injury.
The second
He shot it actually the
incorrect home.
He dropped a pin.
On the home of an enemy.
But when he got to the location,
he got confused as to what side
of the street it was on.
So instead of walking away,
He chose to fire under the
residence, it was occupied by a
woman.
husband.
And their 3 children.
Terrorizing them.
Fortunately for them,
They were not struck. They were
not injured, they were not
killed.
But because he had the desire to
punish his rival.
He also shot into their
vehicles, just to make a point.
And once again, this was the
incorrect residence.
It would have been bad enough if
these were his first two
occurrences in interaction with
the juvenile justice system, but
it wasn't.
He'd been previously referred
and adjudicated in another
county and in our county for
other serious violent felony
offenses, including aggravated
battery with great bodily harm.
Another shooting at her from a
motor vehicle.
An aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon.
And a conspiracy to commit
robbery.
All separate offenses.
All on his juvenile history.
He was able to resolve his case
by way of the plea.
In the state of New Mexico,
children cannot waive
amenability.
I can tell you that the first
time that I went through the
juvenile justice system, that
was a consideration. It was
allowed, but under New Mexico
Supreme Court precedent.
They cannot waive the inability
anymore. They have to go through
an inability to determine if
they should be treated as a
juvenile or as an adult.
Unfortunately, um,
For this community.
He was determined to be
immunable to treatment. I say
unfortunately because this young
man is currently charged.
And in custody.
For first degree murder.
Our efforts weren't ineffective.
That's not noted in this
particular.
Um, right up.
But that is his status.
Now has a homicide charge
hanging over his head, despite
the fact that there were limited
repercussions because I was able
to send him to the youth
diagnostic and Development
Center.
Where he currently resides.
Pending his adult.
The 2nd juvenile
Armed robbery, fire enhancement.
Conspiracy to commit armed
robbery and shooting out of a
motor vehicle with great bombing
harm.
This young man attempted to rob
another young person.
And then so doing, shot into the
vehicle that the
The person was occupying in
order to steal money and a gun
from him.
The gun that that young person
shouldn't have had either, cause
it was a handgun.
In so doing,
He grievously injured.
And in fact, that young man is
paralyzed to this day, uh,
lifelong injury from which
On last check when I did with
him in 2022.
He was still having difficulty,
although he'd gotten some
movement back in his upper body.
But
He was not walking.
And was basically homebound.
At the age of 17 years of age.
His life effectively. This young
man was also placed in YDDC.
Uh, he would have been released
approximately.
4 months ago.
I can only hope that he does not
repeat the pattern.
Of
Using to use violence, including
a firearm, in order to
Steal from others.
And harm others.
It waits and remains to be seen.
And that's because in the 3rd
case study.
I can't even discuss it because
under New Mexico law, it's
sealed.
The underlying facts are not
available to you.
For all intents and purposes
does not exist. In fact, the
statute reads that it does not
exist and if asked about it, I
can say it does not exist.
But I can tell you that this
young man is facing first degree
murder.
In our community right now
Berlio County.
So in terms of some of the
changes that we'd like to see. I
can just interrupt you if I can
interrupt you, Mr. Gray. So
I want to, I want to be clear.
That
What I'm here trying to express
to each and every one of you is.
So many of these young people
that end up committing these
violent criminal acts.
We've seen before in our system.
And there weren't any
consequences at that time.
I'm not into locking up children
and throwing away the key. I
don't want to charge another
child with first degree murder.
That's, that's
to everything that I, I think
about. I don't want to do that,
but because there has been no
consequences and because
rightfully so when so many
people work on juvenile crime
that have wonderful intentions,
but the pendulum, if you will,
has swung so far to we can never
have any harsh consequences on
children when they commit
crimes.
That what we're left for is what
we're left with.
is that at the end of the day,
They don't see any consequences
until, God forbid they've killed
somebody.
And then of course we have to do
something.
So that's the, that's the
emphasis. I want to make sure
you all understand. It's not
just, it's not I want to get
tough on kids and throw away the
key. No, I want to have some
consequences just like every one
of you had with your parents
when you were growing up. If you
do this, there's gonna be a
consequence.
And there was that consequence
as much as a parent as I hated
giving out that consequence. You
don't get to play baseball this
week.
The consequences.
conduct, but if we have no
consequence. And quite frankly,
Mr. Gray will tell me if I'm
wrong.
But probation in the juvenile
system?
There's, there's nothing.
Don't commit another, don't
commit another crime.
That's what probation is right
now. Don't commit another crime.
Well, you shouldn't be
committing anything to begin
with.
I'm gonna give you one more
story. Last night I get a phone
call from our agents.
From our agents.
In the district attorney's
office. They're working in
operation on stolen cars and
pursuant to your warrant.
Ones that you all provide us,
which I could, it's another
topic for another day, but we're
doing a great job. Berlio County
on really doing really good
stuff with that warrant money,
but they're doing an operation
and it's a stolen car and, and
they got the stolen car and
they, they take off, but, and,
and then they
There's a short, short chase of
some sort, then the, then the
occupants get out of the car and
run, run down the road.
It's 3 juveniles.
This is last night I was talking
to my special agent in charge at
10 o'clock last night. This
happened last night in Berlio
County.
The one of they're all free in
the stolen car.
One of them
Says, I'm not giving you my
name.
They took off from cops and were
running, they had to get caught.
I'm not giving you my name.
So the D home won't even
consider
Don't even consider accepting
The person because they don't
have a name, but yeah.
We can't, as law enforcement,
let that person go just to a
John Doe to just all right, go
ahead. You didn't give us your
name, so whatever.
Go ahead back on the street.
So eventually, eventually,
the good work of the agents,
they convinced him to give his
name, but do you think that
stolen car consequence for those
3 kids, what was that last
night?
That was just they got dropped
back off at their home.
And they know it.
I go and talk to schools, as you
know, trying to get a message
across that guns are
unacceptable, but yet when they
get in, get caught doing
anything, they laugh.
One of them was laughing last
night. Nothing's going to happen
to me.
Nothing. I got all my buddies we
steal nothing's gonna happen.
And so that's why I'm telling
you there's got to be some
consequence, even if it's a
night in the D home.
One night and they get out of
there scared.
They realized, my God, I
shouldn't continue to do this.
I'm not talking about throwing
away the key on him. I am
talking about giving them the
help and understanding that they
need and the supervision that
they need if they're not getting
it.
So anyways, that's, that's one
more story I want to add. I do
want to draw your attention now
to the 2nd page of this handout.
This has the statute numbers
down the left hand side, if you
will.
And I'm gonna let Troy talk
about the first two and then
I'll, I'll jump in and talk
about some others, but if, if,
if that's acceptable, Madam
Chair.
Thank you.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I can
also share my perspective from
being a prosecutor.
Back in the early 2000s in the
juvenile division versus how it
appears now.
Um,
It is a sea change.
Um,
The juveniles that I
Had back then. I was prosecuting
for shoplifting minor in
possession of alcohol.
They were not
Such violent offenders. I'm not
gonna say that there were not
violent offenders. In fact, the
first homicide case that I ever
prosecuted was in the juvenile
division.
But my perception is that.
Behavior has escalated.
The number of young people with
firearms.
I
Put it in one word, scary.
Uh, and that's the what.
The challenges for my division.
Uh, is the proliferation of
firearms, including assault
rifles, which as the Bregman is
expressed, is not illegal for
them to possess.
Uh, those are the weapons of.
Destruction that they're using
to kill each other.
Uh
But in terms of the proposals
that we have. Number one is the
definition of serious youthful
offender, and although it does
not appear much,
Removing the indicted or bound
over from the definition would
have a significant impact.
Including
The perception that until
they're indicted or bound over
that they should be treated
differently.
Or the enumerated, which is the
sole serious youthful offender
right now is first degree
murder. We want to expand that
list.
Uh, it makes no sense that
intentional death in particular,
but actually that caused the
death of a human being should
not be considered a serious
useful offense.
Uh, that's why we've asked to
expand the definition as well to
include secondary murder,
voluntary manslaughter,
involuntary manslaughter,
vehicular homicide.
Vehicular homicide is not even a
youthful offender offense under
the state law in New Mexico.
It's even, it's only a juvenile
offense.
That means a young person that
gets intoxicated on our roads,
which this body has determined
is one of the more serious
offenses based on the escalation
of penalties for adults is only
a juvenile offense which
subjects young people to only 2
years of jurisdiction.
And that 2 years is not mean
that they go into the youth
diagnostic and Development
Center. That's 2 years that
could be on probation.
And it could be substantially
less.
And that's for taking the life
of another human being.
Due to the reckless conduct of
drinking and driving.
We've also included child abuse
resulting in death.
What is the most vulnerable
population of children. It's
children even younger than they
are.
And also we want criminal sexual
penetration and armed robbery
specifically with a firearm.
And we differentiate armed
robbery with a firearm from
other armed robberies because of
the nature of a firearm, and the
likelihood that it's gonna be
used and result in a homicide.
But removing that indicted or
bound over is significant
because
The statutory scheme already
embraces that if they are not
indicted or bound over, they're
either treated as a juvenile
offender.
Or a youthful offender.
So the language becomes an
obstacle.
To
Bringing cases forward in many
ways.
The second is the definition of
youthful offender.
One of the things that we're
asking is to expand the
definition to include the
unlawful carrying of a firearm.
As you're well aware, it is a
misdemeanor.
The felony offense that would be
created.
would be useful twofold. One is
that the
Probation department of the
juvenile justice system has the
ability to defer.
Unlawful carrying of a firearm
by a person under age 19,
because it's a misdemeanor. They
can do that up to 3 times in a
2-year period of time.
In fact,
Which means that we don't even
see it. We don't even get to see
initially if a young person has
had a firearm in their
possession, which should be a
red flag for
Potential violent conduct or
behavior because the question I
always ask is, why do they have
a firearm?
I answer myself is because they
intend to use it.
The purpose of having it is
either for their own protection,
for their perceived protection
from others, or because they are
the aggressors and they're gonna
use it against people that they
do not like.
That is my perception as to why
they have these firearms. And so
this can be flagged, we never
see it. And in fact, I've seen
that come through before.
Where it was deferred by the
probation department because it
was only a misdemeanor.
But we didn't even get a clue
that this particular young
person needed an intervention.
Before
Arrived with additional charges,
and then because of the referral
sheet that the juvenile
probation office creates.
We see that
There it is.
He got a
The diversion program.
The number 3.
And they turned 18, I'm sorry.
And they turned 18 years of age,
but by that by itself, you can't
remove them to MDC for us, the
Metropolitan Detention Center.
Well, 19 year olds don't belong
in the D home with 13 year olds.
There is just no rational reason
why that should be taking place.
I personally believe if someone
turns 18 and they're accused of
murder or anything else for that
matter, and they're still in
there because there's a hold on
them or they're pending trial,
their 18th birthday, they should
get a ride to the adult
detention center.
That just makes total sense. Why
are we letting we had, we had a
19 year old escape from the
juvenile detention center just a
couple of weeks ago in
Albuquerque. I think it it hit
some, it hit the news and some
of you may have seen that, but
there is no reason that we
should and and that's a whole
another issue I think that can
be discussed in the legislature
is how we're classifying
juveniles when we do incarcerate
them for any length of time.
Whether or not 13 and 14 year
olds who are in for certain
crimes are in with um 19 year
old murderers or 18 or 17.5.
They were, they committed the
murder or they're charged or
accused of committing the murder
when they're 17 5. They turn 18,
6 months later, they are an
adult under the eyes of the law
at that point they should be in
the adult facility. I think
that's fairly straightforward.
I'm, I'm happy to answer
questions about any of these,
and if I don't have the answer,
Troy, Mr. Gray will. Um, so
4, include language enabling the
state to use juvenile
delinquency records during any
conditions released here and
without having to obtain a court
order to unseal the records. And
Mr. Gray will correct me if I'm
wrong, but I believe once
someone turns 18, those records
are sealed. So oftentimes
courts
And
Us, the basically the records go
away. It's a juvenile. Now they
turned 19 years of age. We've
known.
And when they're, well, at one
point we knew that when they
were juvenile, they committed 3
armed robberies, and this is
just a continual pattern.
Unfortunately, this time,
someone got shot as well.
Let me just mention something
just for, for what it's worth.
This is a really important, I
think when you, when you, when
you
Why this is so important.
I created a gun team
specifically focused in the
district attorney's office.
In in February of this last of
this year.
All it deals with is gun crimes
not including homicide, but gun
crimes for the ages of 18 to 25
year old kids.
18 to 25 year old kids in
Burnleyo County, we created that
gun team thanks to the
Sentencing commission and a
grant because I think it's so
important because whether or not
they're juveniles at 17 or
whether they 18 or 19, how many
cases do you think has been
opened by that 3-la team in our
office since February, meaning a
crime when a gun is discharged
but the person is not dead.
88
Those are just huge numbers and
so it's not just that they
learned some of this behavior
and no consequences
unfortunately at the juvenile
level, and then they continue in
it as they're adult. And so this
tries to make sure that the
courts and everybody else is
well aware um of the issue, and
I, I understand the reason
behind why we don't want to ruin
a child's life because they made
a mess up once when they were 16
years old. I get that.
But at the same time, we can't,
we can't completely put a
blindfold on and not recognize
the fact that this person was
involved in 4 or 5 violent
crimes before. So that's an
important issue for us, um,
extend jurisdiction for
amenability number 5 and
supervision for youthful
offenders until age 25.
And if necessary, and I'll
answer any questions and Mr.
Gray will currently, um, the
jurisdiction exists for youthful
offenders until they reach the
age of 21, and that's it.
That it's done.
And so somebody who commits a
crime and eventually gets
prosecuted, they at the end of
the day may spend 3 or 4 months
until they turn 21 and then
Nothing else. That's it, they're
out.
And so I'm respectfully
suggesting that to think about
possibly extending that to the
age 25. And remember, every time
we go forward in a court hearing
about an amenability hearing,
and we have to hire an
amenability expert, that costs
our office $12,500. And so when
we're arguing perhaps that we
don't believe that just that
exam and that, that whole write
up, when we believe someone is
not amenable and they should
stay in longer, um, oftentimes.
90% of the time, for that
matter, we are, we
Courts or whoever does not agree
with us, that person is not
amenable.
And
We have spent that kind of
money, but I, I do believe
supervision needs to go further.
And one of the reasons is
because of what I just described
to you about our gun team age 18
to 25 in APD came out yesterday
with homicide numbers.
And right there at 38% of the
homicides were committed by
people of 25 years of age or
younger adults.
So there is a real issue when it
comes to that.
Yes,
I think probably a number of us,
but not all of us don't know
what amenable is and it might
help um for everybody to get
that common understanding. Mr.
Gray will probably be very.
Uh, thank you, Madam Chair,
members of the committee,
amenability is the determination
that the court makes whether a
child should be treated as a
juvenile or as an adult.
Um, there is a process where the
state has to put on evidence to
show that because of the nature
of the fence, whether it
involved a firearm, whether it
was against a person. There are
8 factors that we have to go
through in order to show that
this person cannot be treated as
a juvenile within what's called
current juvenile facilities,
which would include why did he
see?
Uh, the judge then makes a
determination, uh, that the
child is either
Treated as a juvenile or could
be sentenced as an adult. Uh,
one of the things that, uh, to
bounce off of what DA Bregman
said is that it's a matter of
jurisdiction frequently. Uh,
it's the state's position that
we ask that they be found, not
be amenable to treatment that
they are to be treated as an
adult, so that we get the extra
amount of jurisdiction to
address their needs. Um, the,
the section section 5.
Tends to help mulate that
particular situation.
But the reality is, is that
They're not
Functioning completely the way
that we need them to at age 21,
and yet we've lost jurisdiction.
They can go about their own
devices, their own means, and do
whatever conduct they want, and
there is no jurisdiction.
That the court has at that
particular point to supervise
them.
Um, by asking for them to be
treated as adults, it's not
necessarily the case that is for
the purpose of incarceration for
certain offenses, certainly,
we're gonna ask for
incarceration whether it's that
why did DC or the Department of
Correction.
However,
Just having the jurisdiction,
the ability to supervise.
To make sure that they're on the
right track is lost.
At the age of 21, if they're
found amenable. Madam Chair,
just the last one that I hope to
be able to take any questions
that you or the committee have,
um.
The last one, and, and I know
firearms or are hotly debated
topic in the legislature, um,
very
Um, politicized on both sides,
but yet, nonetheless, a very
important issue and uh my
intention is not to bring that
up to bring this up to do that,
but I do believe
That if a juvenile under if if
if there's a law that says a
juvenile rightfully so, right,
should not have a handgun under
the age.
Of 19. That is the law of the
land in this state right now.
I'm not sure I understand why
they should be allowed.
To have an assault rifle.
I, I don't get it.
Because that's the law right
now.
And I don't know whether or not
that's just a loophole or if
that's intentional, and I
respect the legislatures, the
governor's decisions on these
things 100% whatever it is we
carry out the law at the DA's
office.
But I just, it, it doesn't make
sense to me.
And we are seen.
You don't have to go very far to
see in Bernlio County, the
number of
Young people with these assault
rifles.
And it's so scary. Um, so I'll
leave it at that, but that is
also a change and that's what
this number 6 does. It just
changes, it uses, changes the
language from handgun to
firearm.
Um, and
That's, that's what, that's what
we're asking for because we
think that would make a
difference as well.
Um, Madam Chair, myself and Mr.
Gray would be happy and pleased
to answer any questions that you
or the committee may have at
this. Right.
Just, um, a point of
clarification, staff.
is telling me that on items 1
and 2, there might be a typos in
the um code references, they
believe the correct code
reference for one is 32-3-7.
Um, H.
And for the second one, it's 32A
wait, excuse me, um, I, I said
that incorrectly. 32A-2-3H, not
7H and 32A2.
Um, um, 3-J. I um
Being clear, Mr. Gray, I'm
sorry.
That is correct. I in fact have
the Children's code open right
now in the New Compilation
Commission, those citations do
need to be corrected. I'm sorry
about that. No, no problem, um,
it happens. But so let me for
the members, for the members,
let me just clarify. For the
first one, the correct citation
is 32-2-3 for NH.
And for the second one, it's
32-2-3 for NJ just cause I know
there are people up here who use
the code while we're talking.
No problem. Um, OK, so I have um
Representative Chasey,
Representative Ree.
Um, myasta.
Uh, Barrego and Martinez.
OK.
Anyone else? OK.
All right. Um, let's see, I saw
some hands over here, all worth.
Um,
Neibert
Um, our representative Luhan.
Anyone else.
Yeah, OK, this works.
All right. um Representative
Tracy. Thank you, Madam Chair,
and thank you very much, um,
district attorney and deputy
district attorney. I just want
to let you know how unsuccessful
I have been in this area for 28
years. And 1996, the RAND
Corporation published a
comprehensive study called
Diverting Children from a life
of crime. I was running for
office my first.
time in 1996 and I was um
I started to make this part of
my platform, there were 4
successful intervention. Well, 3
prevention programs and one
intervention program that the
RAND Corporation found to work,
um.
They, uh, the first was early
childhood home visiting, which
we now have fairly well in
place, and that's one where you
don't realize the benefits for a
long, long time. The second was
for very young children like,
uh, kindergarten, primary
grades, who, children who are
acting out abnormally and seem
completely out of control. Um,
they did intense therapy and
Parent training and school
interventions with those kids.
And the third,
And they were all in one place.
They looked all over the
country. The 3rd was graduation
incentives. They literally paid
kids 4 years to stay in high
school and graduate.
They paid him
They pay him that much, but it
worked.
And then the 4th 1 was um after
they were in the juvenile
justice system. It was a really
heavily intensive supervision
program. So you didn't get this,
oh, I'm going home to
grandmother and then I never
have to see you again. It was a
serious
Um, these things cost money. I
actually got a, uh, in the
budget.
My first session, a um money for
a task force just to look at
whether or not we had any of
these programs and we didn't
have any early child at home
visiting in the state to speak
of at that time.
Do we have, what do we have and
what do we need based on this.
And Gary Johnson line item
vetoed it.
And um he didn't like task force
and I mean that wasn't just in
issue with him. I will grant you
things have changed in 28 years.
The proliferation of guns.
The availability to kids is um
In my view, criminal and absurd
and um it's we we've neglected
our we're talking about weighing
the balancing things uh with
regard to the environment we,
we've done that too. The other
is um the drugs situation and
the um their availability and
Senator Lopez and I were both
running at the same time for our
first terms and um I'm sure she
really got tired of hearing me
talk.
About this, but um,
We never really
Did this. What, what, and then,
uh, Gary Johnson appointed
Heather um Wilson as the first
secretary of Children and
Families, and all we heard about
were predatory juveniles.
And to be honest, we didn't
really, there were a few, but we
didn't have the numbers that
warranted what we did
afterwards. We built the uh way
more facilities than we needed.
Like we built Camino Nuevo in
Albuquerque and then there was
nobody to go into it. I had a
kid in the um I will
represented, um, are you,
uh, who was a foster child, and
she just kept running away from
all of the her foster
placements, and I mean she ended
up there and she wasn't a
dangerous person.
She wasn't a dangerous juvenile.
She just
Wasn't
Doing well in any of her foster
placements. Um.
So,
We ended up
Then, and Cisco McSorley was a
senator and he was really
interested in this, and he got
us on board and Nick, I'm sure
you remember when we looked at
the Missouri model for the type
of facility.
To um in which to lock kids up
so that they have the best
possible chance of getting out
and not reoffending. And um the
J. Paul Taylor uh facility was
supposed to be the Missouri
model.
And um I know that when we would
visit down there, Senator
McSorley was always like, oh,
this isn't exactly what.
We had in mind and from 2010 on,
we've never had the misery
model.
Again,
So
I'm being, I've got a successor
coming who'll be voting on these
things, but I just urge you.
To look at what we can do on the
other side as well as making
whatever whatever changes need
to be done.
We, what we do know now and the
LFC can back this up if it costs
us more to incarcerate the
juveniles that anybody else. And
we also know from data across
the country that locking them up
is um a risk.
In itself, um, we know we need
to keep the community safe, but
also your, your increasing the
um potential for their
reoffending. So,
That's why, that's why Senator
McSorley was really focused on
the them from doing that.
We have a online
but I just hope that you can um
I, I mean, this, this is that
he's 28 years old. There's
probably something newer and
more useful, but um we have to
do something to turn this tide,
not just to contain it.
That's all. Thank you, Madam
Chair. Leader Chasey, um,
briefly, Mr. Bregman, we, as I
said, we have a long list,
right, I, I don't disagree with
anything you just said. I also
would just add that part of that
Needs to be swift and sure a
consequence. I will, I will say
one thing. I was told, I went to
3 months into the job. I go into
the children's court where have
all these advocates for
children, the judges are sitting
there, and I say, what about
consequences? And one of them
said, and, and
God bless her soul. She, I mean,
she means right, but she goes we
don't use the word consequences
anymore in juvenile justice. We
use the word response.
Responses. And I'm like, no.
I call me a dinosaur then,
because I had consequences when
I messed up when I was a kid.
And and and they they get
elevated the worse you do, but
that's, we need swift and sure
consequences so they understand
the wrongdoing. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Brigman, and
thank you, leader. Next person
on the list is representative
Ree and start imposing about a 3
minute. OK. Thank you, Madam
Chair, and DA Bregman and Mr.
Gray, um.
I've seen also the change. I
started in '96 as a children's
court attorney, and then did it
while I was a district attorney
and could not grasp the
difference in how juveniles were
being, you know, handled as far
as no consequences. And I think
maybe and and correct me if I'm
wrong, is it so JPO juvenile
probation officers are still run
under Child, Youth and families.
And so let's just first start
with the issue of how to hold a
juvenile, is it still
A ranking system of like, and
could you explain that to the
committee of, you know, you said
unless they have a gun, they
can't be held, um, because I
think that that's important for
the committee to understand like
that this also goes back to
children and families and how
they're ranking them and high in
juvenile probation hands in
order to recommend that hold,
and then I want to go into the
LCA detention center. There is a
matrix and, and I don't know if
you want to get specific on The
Matrix, Mr. Gray.
Uh, thank you. uh, Madam Chair.
Representative Reed, yes, there
is a risk assessment instrument
the juvenile probation
department uses in order to
determine whether a child should
be held or not.
Um,
I liken it to the now disavowed
Arnold tool, where it doesn't
necessarily capture the nature
of the offense in and of itself
it's just a scoring system.
Uh, the juvenile probation
office does have the ability to
override.
That particular recommendation,
and that's part of the reason
that it's so important that the
unlawful carrying of a handgun
by a person under age 19,
because under that matrix, it's
a misdemeanor.
Um,
And generally speaking, it would
not result in a detention.
Um,
even if they were engaged in
other criminal acts.
Um,
Because there is a new
consciousness within the
department about the risks
associated with firearm, they
tend to override, but it's not
an absolute, though there is
still an obstacle there. And
thank you, Madam Chair, and so
what I noticed it was getting
harder and harder to hold
juveniles and back in the day,
you know, we could hold them for
a night and it really did open
up their eyes and it was like,
yeah, you're not going to
incarcerate them, but they're
scared and they're going back
and they're towing the line and
there's some consequences, you
say, and now.
Oh, you don't see consequences.
I don't even think they have to
pay restitution if you basically
put him on probation and they
burglarized 10 homes or
graffitied whatever, you know,
you could say, OK, you're gonna
go out and work this off and,
and there isn't even anyone who
wants to collect the money
anymore, so there's not even a
consequence of restitution, but
on that note, like Clovis had to
close down their detention
center. It was all a money
saving thing, and the governor
did come down to our area of the
state and said that she plans on
possibly reopening
detention centers. So in a
situation where someone's picked
up in Clovis, we have to drive
to Farmington, Lee County, which
is always full, or Las Cruces,
and so then you have an officer
who's getting off shift at 7
o'clock at night and then having
to make this drive around the
clock to get a kid in and
they're not really highly
motivated to do that. So I
think, and I would ask you if uh
Opening up juvenile detention
centers around the state again
could benefit.
Hoping this issue somewhat.
Madam Chair, Representative, I
absolutely believe it could. I
will tell you, Berlio County's
issue with their D home, at
least what's been described to
me by the folks that run it at
the county is a staffing issue.
It has been a staffing issue.
They, I do believe they have
more space, more pods, if you
will, um, but they have had a a
tough time like, like law
enforcement and corrections
officers in general, and these,
they, they get specialized
training because they are
dealing with, with youth and
children. So I think it's
A big staffing thing, but I do
know that we have several in the
Verna Leo from other counties
that are several juveniles. So,
um, this is an issue that we're
gonna, we're gonna have to face,
I, I believe.
One more question, um, if that's
OK, uh, Madam Chair, on the
immunability hearings and the
issues with amenability. What I
also noticed is, as you stated,
it was so, it was always almost
impossible to get them to find
that they weren't amenable to
treatment.
Um, is there any way we can
adjust the factors of what in
legislation of what maybe is
considered, you know, the
factors they look at to make
them amenable or not amenable,
would that help or it just
seemed like it was so easy to
get an expert to say, well,
yeah, they're amenable, we
haven't tried it or you know.
I think you can look at that. I
don't have the specific answer
for you on that, but I think
that's something that the
legislature can certainly.
Well, Madam Chair, thank you. I
appreciate the presentation. I
agree with you. This is a system
that is, is just
Not working, kids are laughing
at, I, I know what you say, I
saw it myself when I was a DA
and so I appreciate your efforts
on this and I'd be happy to
support. I, I love these changes
I'd be happy to support and work
with you guys in any way and and
trying to work through this in
the upcoming session, so thank
you. Thank you. Thank you,
representative, um, Senator
Maest.
You, Madam Chair, thank you DA
Bregman.
Um,
And I appreciate I'll try to be
brief, madam, Madam Chair, just
a couple of points. One is Mr.
Gray, thank you so much for
being here and your work that
you do. I, uh.
Uh,
Just want to give a shout out to
you. 24 years. How did, how did
I skip you? I've been practicing
for 25 and you were ahead of me
in law school, like, but uh, but
24 years at prosecuting crimes.
Um, madam chair, Senator
Maestas, uh, I spent 2 years as
a prosecutor down in his. Oh, I
see. I understand. So, um,
The, uh, I was, as you know,
Madam Char was in the domestic
violence division had a
horrible, horrible kidnapping
case, road rage, craziness, and
uh.
Mr. Gray joined me on that trial
and I was able to
the victims talk frankly with
the defense attorney and we got
a good resolution out of that
case, just, just many, many
times we were, we were battling
back in the day, so thank you
very much for your years of
work. The, um, a couple of
things. One is
Thank you for the statutory
change proposals. We don't get
that from DAs, you know, and,
and, and, and it's, it's no
one's fault. I mean, when I was
a DA I'd I'd see a statute and
be like, man, that statues
jacked up, or that doesn't
correlate to the to the
uniformed jury instructions. You
don't, you don't think about
policy when you're just grinding
it out as a prosecutor. So thank
you for taking a step back.
Looking at the statutes and
offering uh proposed changes, we
need that as legislators. We
need that from the defense part
and the prosecution.
Uh, to lead to more, uh,
successful prosecutions and
cleaner statutes.
As well as just policy changes,
I think, um,
I think, you know, 18 is
arbitrary.
21 is arbitrary.
If we were to create a new
criminal code, it would probably
be 25, cause that's when the
brain changes, cognition and all
that stuff.
Uh, but we can't just be locked
into the, you know, 18 is not
gonna change, but 21 can change.
Uh, and I think it'll create
some, some policy.
Some decision changes as well,
cause if you have a choice of
locking someone up to their 21.
locking him up for life, you
kind of lean towards 21, we made
a change, Madam Chair, last
year, where they have a parole
hearing.
In their mid-thirties, we have a
parole hearing. So now, frankly,
It's a choice of between 21 and
the mid-30s, I, I would lean
towards mid-thirties or
hopefully the system leans
towards adjudicating them as an
adult.
But we can retain jurisdiction
till they're 25.
Um,
I think that would lead to more
justice because those folks that
are amenable at the age of 25,
it changes the conversation. Are
they amenable at 21? Maybe,
maybe not. Are they amenable at
25.
Quite possibly. So that's
something we should seriously
consider.
Um,
We, with regards to the sealed
re records.
We did make a slight change uh
back in 2016, it was House Bill
72. Nate Gentry was the sponsor.
He was the majority leader at
the house leader at the time,
where we allow records to be uh
spoken about at sentencing.
So take a look at that bill was
chapter 9 in 19 uh in in 2016.
So it's not different, it's not
off the wall to allow these
sealed records to be utilized
in, in the criminal justice
process.
They should be used as on the
front end as well, and then also
um
Uh, with regards to the handgun
and the rifle and why do the
statutes read this way?
Um,
There's a lot of that. There's a
lot of that in state statute,
uh, Madam Chair, DA Bregman,
that's just a contradiction of
the criminal code, that why is
this penalty worse than this
penalty, even though that crime
is worse.
Because we do
We've been doing a great job the
last 5-10 years of not doing
that anymore.
But historically, criminal bills
were standalone bills, and they
make perfect sense.
In a vacuum, but when we do a
criminal change in the penalty
scheme, we have to compare it to
the rest of the code. That's
why, frankly, we all do respect
the, the governor's proposal on
the possession of a
Of a firearm just doesn't jive
with the rest of the code.
Yes, yes, no, no, thank you,
Madam Chair. So anyway, my point
is, is that
Or, or rather my story is that
when you're in the, in in that
committee, and you have this
awesome crime bill and you, but
you don't have the votes in
committee, someone will say,
well, I have a an amendment. And
you're like, no, no, it's
important,
by me how much I haven't used my
5 minutes yet. I don't believe
it was 3 minutes. I have 3. OK,
great. So, um, not 3 more. No,
no, I understand, I understand,
but you're delaying my
Thank you, thank you. So anyway,
um,
a lot of this stuff is policy. A
lot of the stuff is policy.
Lastly, uh,
We don't need a law to book
juveniles into juvenile
detention.
It's not the legislature's
fault.
Cops have full authority to
arrest. The DA has full
authority to book them. So a lot
of this stuff is just a change
of policy that needs to happen,
given the realities on the
ground.
And you've done a great job of
explaining the realities that
have changed dramatically in the
past two decades with regards to
gun violence, juvenile crime,
and the amount of homicides that
are happening in the city of
Albuquerque. So this is some
good stuff to, to ponder and uh
and thank you.
Thank you, Senator, and I'd
appreciate in the future you'd
be more respectful of the time
limitations. Next on the list is
Representative Barrego.
Thank you, Madam Chair. I will
give him 30 seconds of my time.
Um,
Anyhow, um,
Thank you so much, um, both of
you for being here today and for
your discussion, um, Madam
Chair, I just wanted to mention
when I was city councilor, I saw
a lot of this stuff on a daily
basis, and more recently, Madam
Chair, I, I had a discussion
with
Um, with, uh, Mr. Bregman about
the detention center and how
it's full, and they're turning
people away, which really
Like left me with a really bad
taste in my mouth because I'm
thinking to myself, where do
these offenders go?
I mean, if, if our detention
center doesn't have the proper
staffing and it's full, then
when they are making an arrest,
what do they do? Where do they
go? I mean, and maybe you want
to comment on that. That's my
first question. My second
question, Madam Chair, um, and
I'm, I'm gonna hopefully we'll
come back to this because I
think it's important. I have a
friend who's a really good
friend of mine went to college
together and is an APS security
and he's
And there quite a long time.
He's getting ready to retire,
but he has a really hard time
going to work in the morning
because he's afraid for his
life.
And this is in our, our public
school system, and I, I have to
bring this out because I'm
looking around the crowd and I'm
thinking, gee, I wonder if
anyone here is from APS and then
I'm also looking around the
crowd and I'm thinking, and I
see someone from the city of
Albuquerque, but I don't see
anybody here from Bernlio
County, and I bring this up,
Madam Chair, and you may want to
comment on this, Mr. Bregman.
Um, the coordination that
I think
is lacking in terms of, you
know, APS and, and the county
and the city and the state, and
bringing these linkages together
in order to strengthen our
system.
Um, it, it really, really
concerns me, Madam Chair, that,
and I know you're working on
that, Mr. Bregman, but these
linkages of, and, and I know
that our real-time crime center
is working on that. We're trying
to bring that statewide, um,
But in, in order to really, and,
and when I was uh the council
president, I said, we have to be
smarter than the criminals
because they're pretty darn
smart.
You know, and they know how to
use their social media and they
know how to get around. They
know where the cameras are
located, they, I mean, you know,
all of these things. So,
The two questions, one is about
the detention center and the um,
you know, the extent of whether
or not it's full or or what,
what's happening and then the
second thing is with regard to
um strengthening our systems in
order to actually create true
reform. So Mountain chair, those
are my, my guest comments. Feel
free to answer. Thank you, Madam
Chair. I'll be, I'll do it
quickly.
Um
Thank you.
So let me just,
let me ask, answer the first one
you asked. Where do they go?
Where do the kids go right now
if they're declined in detention
center, which every single day,
every single day.
They are declined. The detention
center we says we don't have the
room.
They go home.
And they laugh.
At the system.
That's where they go. They go
home to the parents and
With my dad, it would have been
a little different, you know, I
wouldn't be seeing the DO
anymore, I promise you that. Um,
but no, they go, they get
dropped off at the house and
Now, as far as working with APS,
I, I, I get your frustration and
I understand that
Representative. I will also say
that I am in constant
communication when it comes to
security, not only with APS, the
chief, in fact, he was our
office talked to him this
morning about just some numbers,
but with this no guns in
schools, zero tolerance policy.
That was a collective effort on
the part of APS other law
enforcement, me going to schools
has been a collective effort
with APS and I'll continue to do
that. I think it's, you never
know how effective it is, but I
think it's, it's worthwhile.
Doing. And so, um, we will
continue to work with schools
and to to to put programs
together that work and make
sense and we want to continue to
collaborate, so.
Thank you for the questions.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and, and
I would just say I would love to
work with you on that school
issue.
OK, thank you. Representative
Martinez and then Senator
Neiber.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
Bregman and uh DA Gray. I, I
just have one quick.
Question
I'm curious about page 2.
Section 3.
The child shall be transferred
to a county jail white.
Wyatt County jail and not this
the state Department of
Correction.
Well, at this point, we're,
we're dealing with people who
have not been convicted
necessarily of a crime, and
that's why they're, they're
being held prior to
Make, makes sense. Thank you,
Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative.
Um, Senator Never.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Uh, Mr.
Bergman on juvenile 3 on page 1,
was that sealed by the court or
sealed by virtue of a state
statute.
Madam Chair, I'm sorry, Senator,
you're asking, are the records
sealed by a court. They're,
they're sealed by sealed because
of a finding of the court, or
was it sealed because of the
operation of a state statute.
Madam Chair, Senator Neibert,
uh, it is by state.
That the courts feel the
children's records.
OK, so we may need to work on
that too. My second question is,
um,
Mr. Bergman, I, I know on the
news I watch at home that you've
met with the governor on some of
these things and we're
Coming into a special session
tomorrow to deal with crime
generally, are any of these
issues that you put forth on
page two, are they going to be
Part of the subject matter that
we should be dealing with the
next couple of days. So you just
had to throw that out there to
see.
I'm sorry, Madam, Senator, no
disrespect, man. I, I, I'm just
saying a little joke, but I get
your question. I, I, I, I don't
know uh specifically. I've not
seen the proclamation for the
special session just like you.
Um, I've, I've, I'm not aware at
this time that anything on
juvenile justice is
contemplated.
Because, uh, Madam Chair and Mr.
Bregman, I think that you would
find some, some sympathetic
legislators who would be willing
to do this and a lot more.
Uh, and we certainly have to get
our hands around this because I
come from a city that is
Early violent with respect to
the, the juvenile uh crimes and
we're not immune from it, even
though we're not Albuquerque and
we're seeing what you've
described, and we have to get a
handle on it and I.
Appreciate you being here today
to shine a light on it, but it
affects not just the community
you represent, it affects.
Virtually most of New Mexico.
Mr. Madam Chair and Senator, I
listen, I, I am.
I leave it to the wisdom of the
legislature and the governor on
what laws to pass. I simply tell
you what I think my thoughts are
and this is a really important
issue, juvenile justice and the
complete failure of the system
right now in our community, in
our state is a really important
issue. I'm, I'm not blaming any
branch of government or anybody,
but I think times have changed
dramatically since 1993, and
there needs to be some change.
Oh thank you
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank
you, Mr. Bregman, for the
presentation. Thank you.
Thank you, Senator. So we have
on the list Rep Lujan, Senator
Worth, Representative Romero,
Representative Block, and then
senators on, so.
Oh, I didn't see um
representative Cadena. OK.
Very good.
represented,
sorry.
Oh.
I thought I was down the list.
Thank you. Um,
So my question.
We have a limited amount of
time. How do we
Balance swift and sureness of
being um of tuna is being held
accountable and not having more
children being involved in the
criminal justice system in these
changing times, Madam Chair,
when we're seeing
In Berlio County, I believe it
is 61% increase.
In crime since 2022, uh,
Juvenile crimes.
Involving a firearm. Let me be
clear about that.
Madam Chair,
Um, madam chair, representative,
thank you for the question. I
think it's, it's an important
question and it's something
that, that obviously we try and
balance all the time. We don't
want to create more.
More children getting in
trouble, we want to do the
opposite. I do believe when I
talk about consequences that if
we don't do anything, then
nothing happens.
And therefore they don't learn
anything. And I'm not suggesting
treating a 13 year old in in a
stolen car situation necessarily
the same as a as a 20 year old,
but I am suggesting that just
even trying to get young people
off the streets in a situation
where, where whatever needs they
do have can be addressed,
Turning them away when officers
believe they are a danger to the
community and want to book them
in at least for the night, so
they can see a judge.
And determine what's going on in
their world for 1314 year old
that that can only help, that
that can only help with trying
to make sure that that child
doesn't go out and, and commit a
much more violent crime, for
example.
Thank you Chair. I do believe we
are in different times now,
especially involving uh crimes
of firearms, and they're really,
you really have to focus in on
that when we're looking at
numbers just in Bernaleo, um.
I think uh crimes involving a
firearms just from April,
there's been 298 cases, I
believe. Maybe I'm wrong. Oh,
actually, that's how many
juvenile cases, 158, which were
53% of those cases, uh, have a
firearm involved. So there's a
project a projection of
8194 more cases, which is a 14%
increase, Madam Chair. This is,
this is seriousness, um, we're
feeling it all over as mentioned
in our smaller counties, um, as
well as in our biggest county in
Bernelio. I want to commend our
DA from Berna Leo and all the
work that you're doing, but I
also have to um
Unders we all have to understand
the balance and a lot of the
The issues that we have with our
children and how we really going
to deal with their needs not
being met in the reforms that we
need to invest in for those, for
our children of New Mexico. So
it is a balance. So, I really
wanna appreciate uh
Representative Chasey's his
historical information and where
we, where we have gone, where
we're going, what we haven't
done what we still need to do.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Um, thank you, Representative.
Did you want to comment very
quickly in response to that I, I
absolutely 100% agree that there
needs to be a balance and right
now, it's swung way too far over
here where there, there is no
I keep using the word
consequences cause I, there is
nothing like that. So it's just
let them out, right? Just let
him out. I agree there needs to
be a balance, but we need to
swing it back to get that
balance.
Thank you, um, Mr. DA, uh,
Senator Worth, and then
Representative Romero. Thank
you, Madam Chair. I think I can
do this in one minute, uh, just
to comments. Uh, again, I've
been here long enough. I've
chaired this committee to share
the frustration on the pendulum,
and quite frankly, it's, it's
the when administrations change,
obviously there's different
policies and you see that. I
appreciate you being here
highlighting this and agree
completely with Senator Maestas.
It's good to have policies in
front of us.
The final thing that I just want
to say is that our courts have a
children's code task force
working right now. I think
you've had uh certain
person in your office there,
she's now a judge, I believe,
but I assume you're part of all
that, Madam Chair, we need to
have that task force present
their recommendations back here
because we've got to hear both,
both sides, and I can't help but
the parallel here to criminal
competency and what our courts
doing with the Mental Health
commission, we need to hear what
all the folks around the table
have come up with so that we're
ready, so we don't just get
bills coming all over the place.
We just need to have that, that
balance. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I didn't, I wasn't aware of that
task force that's a helpful
suggestion. um Representative
Romero and then thank you,
thank you, Madam Chair. Um,
thank you for the presentation
today. Um, thank you to Senator
Worth for bringing up the
Children's Code Task Force. Um,
one of the things that we, we
talked about anecdotes and I
really worry about hearing about
the worst of the worst. We're
looking for uniform data to help
us inform decisions that we're
making. When we look at the
Children's code overall, and
even the opinions that we have,
we have to look
It as a whole.
So picking and choosing certain
um statutes that will affect
other portions of the code for
me is um a concern and how we
sort of tie up those.
Loose ends with data to help
inform what that will look like.
Um, and I know that the JRI is
doing it for adults. I don't
know what we're doing for
juveniles when we talk about the
volume of firearms of folks
committing crimes, all of that
may seem like the, the reality
for so many, but where is the
data to back that up when we
have um
I've heard anecdotes from
pre-90s, right, of, yeah, I used
to just get taken home and, you
know, that was fine and now I'm,
I've figured it out and went to
school and got my, you know,
nose clean and figured it out.
So you hear these anecdotes from
the past and then today, you
know, where, where, what are we
cohering around when we're
talking about these stories and
and how to actually look at the
future of what we're discussing,
um, when we, when you Google
what to do about this and we're
talking about, you know,
criminalizing children is not
going to help them in the.
future, you put them through a
system um that puts them into a
box. They can't come out the
same.
And so when we are looking at
the consequences of changing
that, I'm really concerned
about, you know, taking best
practice and what we have
learned since the 90s and being
able to put into practice the
best foot forward for the future
with what we actually know from
the trajectories of what we've
learned.
Um, so looking forward to
hearing from the Children's
Code, but want to hear more, not
just from Bernna Leo but from
the statewide approach to what
we're being, what's being
suggested to what could be um
applicable for, for this work.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Have representative block and
Representative Cadena and then
Cervantes.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Mr. District Attorney,
Deputy District Attorney, thank
you both for being here. So I
just have a couple of quick
questions for you so I won't
keep you here all day, uh, even
though that would be so much
fun, I'm sure, but Madam
Chairman, I, I was
I was listening to the
conversation, I was wondering
about.
Juveniles that are found
incompetent by the court, and
I'm just wondering how many of
those cases have you seen in B
Bernalio since it's the largest
county per capita, and then what
is the plan to help those
juveniles who are indeed found
incompetent. Is there some kind
of uh remedy like a treatment or
release? What happens to those
juveniles, Madam Chairman, yeah.
Madam Chair, Representative
block, uh, we do have competency
issues in the juvenile justice
system. Uh, I can tell you that
there's probably no less than 20
or 30. Um, I don't have the
exact number. Uh, I wasn't
anticipating discussing this
topic, but I would say that
there's anywhere from 20 to 30
young people at this time that
are undergoing some form of
competency determination.
Um, what typically happens if
they're found incompetent.
Uh, which is obviously the issue
that we need to address cause if
they're found competent, it just
proceeds its normal course.
But if they're deemed to be
incompetent,
The
Statutory scheme is that they
are subject to review every 90
days to determine if they're
obtaining some level of
competency, and if they're not
Deemed to be confident after a
year of the cases.
Um, I can tell you that there's
not a lot of resources and also
not a lot of
Um,
Effort.
is probably the best way to put
it.
For these young people to be
found competent once they've
been found incompetent. So they
can be ordered to a program, but
most of the programs don't
address.
Competency issue. It may address
their individual counseling and
may address family counseling,
but it's not dealing with the
issues that may underlie why
they're incontinent. For some of
the young people, it's because
of their age. They're just too
young.
Uh, to comprehend the juvenile
justice system.
I can tell you that we have
offenders as young as 10 or 11
come through our system,
including ones that are involved
in violent crimes.
Um,
So, not understanding the
concept of the system is not all
that strange.
Um, but the consequences that
the case will be dismissed at
the end.
Thank you, Madam Chairman and
thank you for that. I think
that's a salient point to know,
and I, I think we would
definitely.
Do good for all New Mexicans to
look into that aspect of the
justice system because they're
just being released. We're not
helping anybody. We're just
essentially putting them back to
potentially get into trouble
again, and I think that
competency portion could be
something we could look at maybe
in a special session in the
future or in this next 60 day
session, but I think it's
something that needs to be
addressed as well as this sealed
records, especially when it
comes to the most violent
crimes. So that's all I had,
Madam Chairman, thank you.
So much. Um, thank you very
much, Representative.
Representative Cadena.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Good
morning.
District Attorney Regman.
Certainly, you've brought us
proposals that are
More clear and potentially
compelling than anything else
we've seen this interim.
I'd also describe them as
probably the most terrifying
thing that's been brought in
front of us this interim.
And while we can ponder about
the flashback to the 90s and the
language of super predators and,
and what that meant when our
country went on a spree of
building prisons.
New Mexico signed that deal with
the devil under Governor
Johnson's leadership to become
the state where we had the most
privately operated facilities in
New Mexico.
I actually think
Your flashbacks aren't going far
enough.
And it stuns me that here in New
Mexico,
If we're ever honest about our
complex and violent and colonize
their history.
That we can't be neutral or
silent or speak about what's
happening in our families and
with our children and with our
young people in a vacuum.
And New Mexico, like Hawaii.
Has always been a majority
indigenous.
I'm black and people of color
state.
And the ways that settler
governments and state powers.
And national interests.
bumped into each other to create
the kinds of poverty.
And intergenerational trauma.
And substance use and
incarceration.
We just, we can't ignore those.
We can't have conversations like
that.
Without naming the reality we
live in.
And one day owning and
reconciling like where that
reality comes from.
Yes, lots of my work and life
has been in criminal legal
reform because I've done what I
can to listen and learn from
families navigating perinatal
substance use. Often those are
families whose
Times in and out of
incarceration shape who they are
and what their possibilities
are.
And those kids they're raising.
We failed them again and again
and again.
But I'd hope that as we engage
in these kinds of conversations
moving forward, you talk about a
pendulum swinging. I'm asking
us, like, let's have a fuller
richer, deeper conversation
about how New Mexico ends up in
a moment like this.
Maybe it comes off light and
funny to some listening online
or here in the room, when you
shake your finger, madam chair,
and talk about consequences.
But it must be something to have
such privilege.
In identities and you all come
from and otherwise, the
consequences get to come from
parents.
And not in a system that's
designed.
To keep you down and lock you
up.
So thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, Representative. Um,
Senator Cervantes.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, I
want to publicly thank you, uh,
District Attorney Bregman, for
meeting with me last month. You
and I met for probably 2, 2.5
hours in your office to discuss
this special session and the
agenda and proposed legislation.
There's been some suggestion
that this legislature is not
hardworking or has not put the
effort into consideration of
this agenda, and I want to thank
you for spending those hours
with me and the district
attorney in Cumming and Donana
County, who specifically looked
at the items of this agenda
together.
Um, and just you and me one on
one. I, I thank you for taking
that time.
Uh, the, um,
The gun violence is deplorable.
Many of us have worked on it.
I've passed a lot of the
legislation working with the
governor over the years to try
and reduce some of that. Um,
evidently the executive order
banning guns for adults and
juveniles is not uh had the
consequence that maybe we'd like
to all see and we should
recognize the limitations of
doing that. One of the items
agenda for the special session
is data sharing information, can
you do very briefly because I
have 3 minutes. Can you briefly
tell us what data you share or
what you have shared with you
from APD.
And with the DPS, the state
agencies that already exist.
This
By date I mean criminal,
criminal offenses and that was I
think I understand your
question, Madam Chair, um.
Mr Vice Chair, Senator.
I, uh,
We share data every day.
With not only a fellow law
enforcement office, but we share
data.
With the legislative Finance
Council. We share data with
various committees in the
legislature.
I, I pride myself that if
there's ever a time that
Anybody needs information if we
have it available and it's not
privileged for some reason, we
give it out. And let me
interrupt you because my time is
short. Specifically, the
legislation was proposed that
there would be greater data
sharing between local law
enforcement APD and DPS, the
state agency. What information
do you share now that is
available to DPS or has there
been data ever requested of you
from DPS that you have failed to
share with them.
There's never been any data that
we've ever failed to to supply
any law enforcement agency or
any government agency that's
requested it. So, would we need
a law to compel you to do so
now.
I don't know whether or not I, I
I don't need one. I don't know
what other, other agencies
around the state may or may not
do, but I personally give all
the data that any of you all
want and any other agency wants.
And thank you. And again,
because time is short. Uh
yesterday I reviewed for the
committee that with regard to
Senator or representative.
Senator Mati is a felony
possession issues. I reviewed
that over the last 5 years or so
or more we two years into the
Martinez administration
increased the penalties for
felony possession twice into
this
we've now done so 3 times in the
time that you've been district
attorney, do you see a declining
number of offenses of felons in
possession that would correlate
with the fact that we've
increased penalties 5 times in
the last 6 years.
No, I, I do not see a decline in
felon in possession. I see an
increase in in felon and
possession. I will say it's
important that we have a robust
law when it comes to felony
possession, and I understand,
um, but I, but I will say this,
the reason is because those same
people, if they're incarcerated,
cannot be out.
Shooting other people with
firearms. And so if they are a
felon, it is against the law to
have a firearm and we want to
make sure they are
Prosecuted and if guilty,
convicted and sentenced
appropriate. Mr. Bregman, would
you agree that if we were to
adopt the proposal that's before
us and make it a 12-year
mandatory sentence for a felon
in possession for a serious
violent offense of death penalty
because it's mandatory would be
um stricter than a a murder uh
say a second degree murder. Yes,
that is the case that that the
way that, that would be would be
strict to the 2nd degree murder.
Um, you could get me, I could be
happy to talk about the
sentencing on.
All kinds of crimes, but
But that's the way I understand
the bill, and I don't know if
it's 12 or 9 is a mandatory
minimum under the legislation 12
years for a serious violent
offense, felon in possession, it
would be 9 years for a non-se
right and that's a minimum
mandatory. I do, I, I, I, I'm
not, I've not been a big fan in
30 years of practicing law, both
on the criminal defense side and
the prosecutor side of minimum
mandatory sentences. I've not
been a big fan of that. This is
the one particular instance
where I do believe that there
may be, and I'm not, I, I'll
leave it to the
Minds of the legislature and the
governor's office on what that
time should be, but I do believe
there should be some minimum
mandatory if you're a felon and
you have a firearm.
And we'll come back and visit
some more time about that when
we have that time. I'll just
last to say close, Madam Chair,
that uh we, we, our focus is on
juveniles, uh, juveniles are a
reflection of our society and us
as adults. And so everything
that we're talking about with
regard to juveniles or cavalier
attitude toward life, murder,
guns, is reflective, I think,
from my experience with the
adult society and in parts of
our state as well too, and so
the, the demand for Swift and
certain justice and for
consequences, I think applies to
juveniles, but it certainly
applies to.
as well, and when the juvenile
see a lack of consequences
befalling the adult population
for crimes then the message to
them is pretty clear, which is
not just seeing their juveniles
not having the consequences, but
let's be honest, we're not
seeing adults with enough
consequences as well too and or
see the swift and certain
justice for my perspective of
Mr. Brigman. So I'll just end on
that, it's not so much a
question you and I could spend a
lot of time and, and you've
given me that time in the past.
Thank you for helping me, the
chair in this committee, prepare
for this special session with.
time you've given me. Thank you.
Um, thank you very much, Mr.
Bregman and Mr. Gray, we
appreciate you. Obviously people
are very interested in the
conversation and discussing
these items more. I appreciate
the suggestion of the um Senate
leader in regards to the
treatment, the um task force as
well, Madam Chair, if I just may
conclude by saying one thing, I,
it was an honor for both of us
to present to each and every one
of you, and I want each and
every one of you to know that at
any time, any time at all, a
phone conversation, an in-person
meeting, I'm always
available to meet with our
legislators. So thank you. I've
had that experience as well.
We've met a number of times to
hear what's what's happening in
your neck of the woods, and I
appreciate your openness and
availability actually and making
your staff available also. Thank
you. Thank you.
May we be excused
when I say thank you, that's
like a hint.
Good to see you.
So we have next on our agenda,
um, the Honorable David K.
Thomas or Thompson. He's our new
Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court.
Mhm
Unfortunately, but we learned
from.
Yeah, we could have and actually
we can.
Um, welcome, Mr. Chief Justice.
Welcome, Mr. Hardy. Good to see
you. Yes.
Or is yours, sir.
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair,
members of the committee. My
name is David Thompson. I'm the
new Chief Justice.
Of the New Mexico Supreme Court.
Um,
Any questions? No,
I will, uh,
Well you know how it feels to be
on that side.
Uh, usually, you're right, I'm,
I'm the one asking the
questions, uh, I do think
honestly, your time is best
spent asking me questions, I'll
do my very best to answer them.
Those that, uh, you know, I
write for a living, uh.
So the particulars I've already
here if he can't help us, uh, we
will get that information to
you.
Um,
We, uh, I want, well, you know
Arie Pin this little.
I don't know if you guys have a
cake for him. This is probably
one of the last time he's
Are we gonna appear in front of
you, um, and he's served us very
well, uh, Carl Reisstack will be
replacing Arie.
And uh we'll continue that
institutional knowledge. I'm
joined by Miss Ann Keith, who is
our general counsel.
Of brief opening, uh, give you a
sense sort of what I do.
What I'm thinking about, um, and
a very brief.
So the state of the judiciary,
and then I'll just stand for
questions. I'm sure you have
many.
Um,
And uh I will address them. We
rotate Chief Justice's every 2
years. So for those of you that
have been in the legislature for
a long time, you're going to see
many of us, maybe some of us
twice.
Uh, our role as the
administrative head of the
court, not just in New Mexico
Supreme Court.
But the entire judicial system.
We have an administrative arm
which is the AOC.
Um, that helps us in the day to
day, um, but we, in fact, many
of the justices implement. I'll
talk about some of these
programs.
Implement the programs, um, that
confront the judiciary.
Uh, we are here in the
conversations you're having on
the agenda, uh, where do we
Um,
Interact. The court is where
problems come to be solved.
That's just what we do.
Um, disputes land, um, societal
disputes, contract disputes,
business disputes, tort
disputes.
And sometimes those involve
public policy.
And that's what you do.
Uh, that's what the legislature
and the executive does. My role
as chief
Uh, I am going to look very
internally to what our processes
are.
Um, and not externally. I, I do,
you hopefully will not see me
too often in the 60 day session,
uh, with two exceptions. One is
to
Defend and advocate for our
budget.
And I will be advocating in
matters that I believe fringe on
Uh, constitutional prerogative
of the judiciary, just as I'm
sure you will let me know when
you think we are doing the same.
Those are the two circumstances,
uh, I intend to have
conversations with you about.
And then we are here as partners
of three branches of government.
These problems can't normally be
solved without a conversation
between the three branches, so
we can.
Assist you in your policymaking
and telling you as sort of the
DA did.
How it applies on the ground.
Um, these are the facts, and you
all make the decisions in
drafting the legislation.
Um, we thank you. I want to
start with the point of
gratitude, but thank you for the
judicial raises.
Um,
This was a long time coming for
those of us in the judiciary,
legislature stepped up.
And the governor stepped up and
we appreciate it.
So we're only asking for 10% on.
We will not be asking for raises
this year.
Um, what we will do and what
I've told the judges as I visit
each district across the state
is now it's on us to look
internally and make sure we're
paid like professionals we need
to act like professionals.
And have a professional process.
So that's what we will be
focusing on.
A few things of note.
We have changed our uh the way
we decide cases fairly
dramatically. We are going to a
term system.
And what that means is we will
basically compress our oral
arguments into the fall.
With um issuing opinions, um, 6
months after that. We normally
take oral argument every other
month.
And what that has caused is with
all our other duties, it's very
difficult to prepare.
have argument and write and at
the same time trying to address
the administrative obligations
we have.
So we're gonna have a fall term
where we have oral argument.
And we will issue the opinions.
I don't make performance
measures easier.
Because those opinions will have
to be out at the end of the
term.
It will also relate to um our
budget.
So that, um, is new.
Uh, a few, um, points to brag on
in the last year we have held
our, uh, I think 4th annual
rollout program at CNM this year
at about 400 students there.
Um, that we're able to watch the
Supreme Court argument, and we
were able to stream that.
We create a whole lesson plan
through our library.
Um, and we provide those to the
schools.
Um, which gives a summary of the
briefs and the argument.
And what is being presented. So
we're very proud about that.
One of our priorities this year
will be
in including
salaries for our staff, um, is
security.
Um, it continues to be, uh, an
ongoing issue, um, in particular
with the judiciary. I think you
are aware of the April 8, 2000.
24 and sent Rio Mracho.
In which after a threat, um,
several deputies had to engage
in individual coming into the
courthouse with an ax.
Um, so it's not a theoretical,
it's not just social media, it
is people acting.
On these threats. I can also
confirm to you.
Um, recent threats at Sandoval
County Courthouse.
June 25, 2004, uh, where
The individual made detailed
threats, uh, the life of a
judicial officer.
I thank you for recently enacted
legislation um that would make
um
That a crime and those
individuals um will proceed
through the judicial process.
Um, under that new statute, you
provide us a good amount of
money in judicial education.
We've used that money wisely,
including statewide training.
Uh, district court magistrate
municipal court judges and staff
training throughout the state.
Technology you've provided us
funding for that. Um, we are
implementing statewide.
used to have the court reporters
sit there. They found
everything. We are implementing
FTR to text where the audio
recording is translating it. You
all have very similar things
probably in your.
Messages, um.
We are implementing that
statewide.
We are increasing our security,
uh security doesn't just involve
physical security, it involves
Um,
Our data
Um, and are, um,
Internal security.
Um, we are aware, I'm sure you
are aware of the hack of LOPD.
Um, we fortunately had a what we
call a tabletop exercise about a
year ago where we.
Do a mock
Cyberattack
So that we were prepared to
implement certain procedures in
case one of our partners was
hacked and we were able to
Um,
We
I want to give you um
In overview of uh
Sort of it, it goes along with,
with what
Basic philosophy and um
Prior to priority of my job is,
um, you are aware of fairly high
profile case in the first
judicial that occurred last
week.
Um, got a lot of news,
international news.
Those trials happen across the
state all the time.
You probably have, you're gonna
have this meeting all day. It'll
be two jury trials by the time
you adjourn somewhere in the
state, probably more.
So judges, our job is to get
Those disputes that I talked to,
to the factfinder, and that is
what we're doing. And a critical
part of that.
We have to fund our juries.
It's as if you didn't find
turning your lights on in this
building. It is critical to what
we do.
Um, and that will be an ask for
the legislature.
We are, we need to do better
with the money we use.
For those juries, both because
our citizens are.
Inconvenienced, although they
find the process valuable, they
are inconvenienced by it, and we
need to be, make sure our child
afford to use that money more
wisely.
Um, we have, uh, rolled out a
statewide self-help program.
Um, it is an access to justice
program spearheaded um by former
Chief Justice Bacon.
And will continue to implement
self-help centers throughout the
state.
It started um along with other
justices or rural justice
initiative.
Um, no, Representative Reeb, I
believe, has been in
conversations about that.
Where we set up clerkships and
have put lawyers down into the
9th and the 11th with stipends.
We find that if you're able to
place a lawyer in a rural
community, they're more likely
to stay there. They develop
roots, and that has been very
successful.
Um, I have some talking points
on AOT, but I think those are
best presented um through
questions.
Um, I, I think.
You know, I can, I can give you
an overview of it, but I think
that will happen too.
Uh, your general question. So
with that, that's my opening
remarks. I'll stand for
questions here.
OK.
Questions. OK, we have Senate,
um Rep Martinez, who I always
forget, so you're gonna get to
go first, then Senator Worth.
Senator Cervantes.
Um, oh, rep JC
um Bluh.
Anyone else keep it to about 5
minutes.
Thank you, Madam Chair, I'll
speak very quickly.
Um, in your opening, you
referenced the security issues,
um.
Which are particularly
concerning to me because both of
those instances happened with
the 13th.
Which is in my district.
Um, I've, I've visited other
courts around the state and some
have a very good.
Security system, uh, you look at
what's going on in the 2nd.
Um, they have a very strong
security apparatus.
But you go to other courts,
especially in the rural parts of
the state, I've been up to Ri
Riba.
Where
You basically check yourself in,
you, you can choose to walk
through the metal detector or
not. Um, is there a plan?
Uh, through AOC to put together
a more um.
Robust and uniform.
Security plan in place.
Um, and if so, are you able to
share any of those details?
Uh, thank you, madam chair.
I think I I've already expound.
Let's let's identify the, the
problem first of all, what you
described in the 13th.
It is a growing district.
And if you're in the main
courthouse, actually, it's
probably not a problem, but the
13 shares similarities with the
first.
Which is, it is a combination of
both. The security in the first
is very good.
Um, I was a judge in the first
judicial. I'd never had
concerns. We had an SO that was
very supportive.
When you get into the rural.
Communities and we have a
courthouse in every county.
And it's in the county seat, so
Ri Riba, you're not even in
necessarily espanola or tier.
Um, so what do you do about it?
Um, we can rely on the SOs,
which sheriff's office normally
we would. That is an obligation
of the county, technically under
the statute.
It's the obligation of county to
maintain a courthouse and
support the security. The truth
of the matter, it doesn't
happen. Why?
Because they're elected and
their
Constituents are saying, I want
you patrolling County Road and
not.
Sitting in front of a
courthouse.
Understand that
Um,
I don't agree with it.
Those are decisions that are
gonna be made. So how do you
fill the gap?
We have a couple of solutions.
One, I think that helped was the
return to work.
We're able to have long retired
law enforcement come back.
Um, we tried to get contracts
for some of these courthouses,
and it was very difficult to do.
Um
The
The best solution now I think
with return to work, perhaps is
going to be.
Um, allowing us to fund FTEs,
fund a position in a sheriff's
office. They don't want
temporary positions. They want.
And they want security of having
the FTE and they don't want it
being an AOC position
necessarily. We can fund an FT
in these.
Sheriff's office, they can say,
OK, we have the funding, we can
hire the individual and we can
place him at the courthouse.
Um, and the second part of it is
just improving our physical.
Um, security apparatus.
Individual for an ax, for
example, if we can keep them
out.
Um, that's half of it.
Arty. Anything else on that?
Uh, Madam Chair Representative
Martinez, oops sorry, Madam
Chair Representative Martinez,
uh, I think Chief Justice
covered it very well. The um
I think prudent steps she took
with regard to return to work
for law enforcement were very
significant in the 2024 session.
It's not a, you know, open the
door completely, it's a good
step forward and we're hoping
with some funding to be able to
work in the way the chief said
with the sheriff's offices so
that they can have people
dedicated to security that we're
paying for that they're
employing. I don't.
AOC running a division of people
who need to be certified in
firearms and all that kind of
thing. It's really best left to
law enforcement.
But uh the chief.
Breaking out by many of the
challenges we've had getting the
counties to provide security,
uh, although it's a statutory
imperative, you know, if they
don't have people, they don't
have people and it's been very
challenging. We did a while back
at appropriation to try to hire.
Uh, contractors.
You maybe can do that in
Uh, some of our jurisdictions,
but you can't do it in the great
majority of them. This is not
somebody who's going to work
there for an hourly wage or we
can afford it.
So I think that's a big step in
the right direction. Um, I know
it's a reaction reactionary
approach, but we do appreciate
that the legislature last year
passed the Criminal bill to make
threatening a judge 1/4 degree
felony and as you mentioned,
unfortunately, we've got some
current activity under that
statute, uh, which is going
through the process. But um uh
that it's important when these
threats are interrupted, to be
able to have a mechanism to deal
with the person appropriately.
So, uh, Represent Martinez,
do have plans, you'll see
requests from the different
districts for funding instead of
making it a
Uh, uh, for us to get funding
for security so that we can put
those people in the districts
through the sheriff's office.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
And Chief Justice and or just,
just as a side, it was always a
pleasure working with you when
we're sitting.
Veterans court in the 2nd. Just
wanted to thank you for your
Service to our state. I do
appreciate it. Thank you very
much.
Thank you, Mr. uh Representative
Martinez, Senator Worth.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and
thank you, Chief, for being
here. I just wanna echo uh the
appreciation and the
availability that you have made
yourself available to us and
we've certainly been taking
advantage of that and having
really important conversations
between the two branches.
Um, also Arie, congrats on your
retirement again 20 years that
I've been here and I just have
enjoyed working with you. You've
always given us what we've asked
for, and again, congrats on
that. So just two things, Chief,
I think that would be helpful.
Um, I, I would like you to
Kind of follow up on the
proposed pilot uh for both AOT
and criminal competency, perhaps
start with criminal competency
because that was something the
court is was already doing, and
I think we gave one time money
for some new uh criminal
competency courts, but I just
think it would be helpful for
folks to hear exactly what that
looks like. Uh, and then I
think, uh, an update on the
Mental Health commission.
When, when are we going to see
uh a bill on criminal
competency. Again, I think
that's going to be something
this commission has this.
commission this committee, uh,
and leadership has already
indicated is going to want to
jump right into once, once the
mental health commission, which
is working on a criminal
competency bill once that bill
comes forward, then we put it in
the process really to prioritize
it for January.
Those are my questions, thanks,
right.
Thank you, uh, chairs.
Um,
Let me know if, if I need to
fill in any gaps.
Uh, let me say.
In the first instance, two
things.
Um, that are true.
These changes are needed, and
these changes are.
Complicated.
It is truly in my experience in
the courts.
Really where I've seen the
divergence of
policy and judicial operation
combined with a science.
Right, which is behavioral.
So we are not only interacting
policy with
Judicial operations.
But there is an overlay of
Treatment.
Which
is a science.
Um,
And we rarely see those things.
So, um, we're happy to be
partners with the legislature
and the executive who have
identified these problems and
Do our best to assist in
resolving them.
There are 2 you've heard about,
I'm not gonna redo all the
programs you've heard on AOT and
competency. They are, I do want
to maintain as trial lawyer
would, let's keep them
separated, both look towards the
same goal, but they are
different things. AOT is a civil
process.
OK.
And competency.
is a criminal process. There's
Leverage through
Difference in the criminal
competency really center is that
there is leverage over.
The individual through a
criminal consequence.
It would be a diversion what we
describe as diverting, not
letting off, but diverting
individuals
who
Have
been charged with a crime, but
have
Um,
Mental health issues.
We would divert them to mental
health treatment.
Um,
And consideration for doing that
is their criminal charges would
be deferred.
Hoping they would seek the
treatment they need.
Not but the county of the cost
of incarcerating that individual
and having
Um,
Uh
The, um,
Increased costs of going back
and forth through the system.
I do want to add
One thing.
I was thinking about it from the
last presentation, which is also
critical with what the DA was
talking about.
There's a difference between
treating somebody.
this diversion program and
treating someone for competency.
So if you are under the
assumption.
Or you can correct me if I'm
wrong, which you will.
That they're going to be treated
for their mental health.
That isn't always true. They are
trying to determine if that
person who has committed a crime
allegedly is competent.
Under the Constitution, to stand
for charges. So.
Um, I don't want an assumption
that treating for competency is
treating that individual
necessarily to make them a
healthy individual.
Um,
We have programs, um, in the
first.
Um,
Which is
The largest part of this pilot
program it would initiate an AOT
um program in the first and the
and criminal competency.
Um, the next competency
diversion program is being the
3rd and that is existing. The
third is very robust in their
behavioral health.
Um, the governor, as I
understand it, has stood up
behavioral health centers in
that community, and that has
helped.
Um, 4th judicial where the
hospital is. That makes sense.
Um, and the 12th as a
Competency program as well. That
is grant funding. It's one-time
funding in essence.
The question is, could we then
layer over.
AOT and some of those districts
and we've tried to do that
because.
While they are separate.
It makes a lot of sense to
handle handle them in a parallel
way.
Um,
So, if you look at our
First here, 2nd, Albuquerque,
4th a little northwest of us, on
the 3rd all the way down south
and then the 12th.
Um, those are the areas where.
Um, we would hope to stand up.
Um,
Popping into uh.
And
AOT.
The difference it is right now a
municipal strike that a
magistrate diversion, meaning
the crime would have to be
A misdemeanor less, I apologize.
I missed not less, a
misdemeanor. Um, we have the
ability.
Um, to handle.
Um, if we can get this program
going, nonviolent felonies.
So we would be able to move into
possibly.
Um, addressing nonviolent
felonies and we are currently
capable of handling misdemeanor
diversion.
That's AOT and
Um, competency.
The commission
We, um,
are prepared.
Through the New Mexico Supreme
Court Mental Health commission.
To provide the policymakers.
A draft of a competency statute.
Let me say this very clearly.
It is not a judicial bill.
We don't write bills. It makes
me very uncomfortable.
It just does.
But what we can do is we know
who's involved in the system,
right? We know the DAs, we can
bring the DAs, we can bring the
PDs in, we deal with them daily.
We can bring
The behavioral health folks,
mostly executive, you all have
connections there. The county
officials, and we can have a
conversation about what
would be good in a bill.
And it's just.
That
And we would hope we would be
able to have the policymakers at
that point.
I
Uh, you know, as, as a starting
point in draft legislation they
think is we will have that by
the end of the summer.
Was that responsive?
So ma'am, sure cheap it does
just one quick comment. I could
not agree more, and I think
we've, the work we've done here
the last 3 months.
changes certainly are needed in
these statutes. I think we agree
with that.
I would also grieve, and I'll
speak for myself.
But these are very complicated.
Issues as you said, and I think
that's what's got us in the
predicament we're in and we're
gonna go talk about that on the
floor starting at noon tomorrow.
Uh, but the thing about the
pilot that's so important is
that if we can get that started
now, we're creating the
infrastructure so that when,
when we make changes in January,
we don't then have to wait
another 6 months to put the
infrastructure in place. The
infrastructure can be in place.
I think you and I have discussed
about 75% of the states.
Uh, and so when we make changes,
The infrastructure will be
there.
Again, move forward under
whatever we decide to do. So I
just think it's, it, this is an
important and I appreciate very
much the courts being willing to
work with both the executive and
the legislature uh in coming up
kind of with this idea, and I do
think it's something we should
pursue as soon as we can figure
out how to get the funding that
you need.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Senator, Senator Cervantes.
Thank you, Madam Chair, Madam, I
want to report for the benefit
of the public and the committee
and thank you, uh, Chief, for
spending about 2 2.5 hours
meeting with me, uh, Philip
Ladagote Brandon Cummings on the
Senate Judiciary Committee staff
last month to review the things
like civil competency, areas of
law that I don't practice in,
uh, uh.
And criminal competency all the
civil commitment, all of the
things that
Unworth was just referring to it
again for the benefit of the
committee and the public. Any
suggestions the legislature is
not engaged, not hardworking,
not committed to the time. Oh, I
wanna thank you uh for spending
um those hours with me and with
Philip and Brandon uh to discuss
the issues that are here today
too and give everyone a
background that a lot of things
that happen that that maybe
don't always get to.
the attention that they deserve.
The um
Starting a couple of years ago,
your predecessor started a small
subcommittee.
To get beyond the, the vetoes of
those judicial salaries, which
you talked about a bit earlier
and that subcommittee continues
to work. Representative
Chandler, Cherry Chandler sits
on that. We meet periodically by
Zoom. I appreciate you doing
that. We did that just a couple
of weeks ago and um the, the
topics at the time included 3
that I just want to touch on
briefly for the benefit of the
committee members and um and
begin to again prepare us for
the coming 60 day session, which
is, uh, we got beyond the
judicial salaries issue
So, we've been talking about
judicial retirement, that's
gonna be an issue for us, I
think, to think about from a
policy standpoint.
I, I've tried making the
argument on retirement that when
I started practicing law 30+
years ago, uh, aspiring to the
bench, ascending to the bench
was oftentimes the culmination
of a very distinguished legal
career, and we would oftentimes
see experienced practitioners
with a lot of experience.
Men and women who would um take
the rope.
And uh we increasingly don't see
that anymore. We, we see very,
very young
often relatively inexperienced
people taking the bench. I'm
hoping we can find a way to
incentivize um practitioners
with a lot of experience by
retirement, uh, structure. So
that's one thing that we've been
talking about in that
subcommittee.
We've also been talking for
members of this committee on
redistricting. We have 13
judicial districts around the
state. I don't know how long
those districts were created.
Um, I gave a lot of hard time on
our last phone call. I hope I'll
make you smile, uh, Chief on
talking about Tula Rosa, uh,
those of you in that part of the
state, you know, I look at him
smile. So, you know, I've gone
to Tularosa, yeah.
When I, I'm a Southern
practitioner oftentimes, and of
course, interestingly, we, we
created the courthouses, um, I
think at the time of statehood,
by putting them on the railroad
railroad lines. It was important
to have the courthouse at the
railroad, I guess they needed to
get Billy the Kid or whoever
else on the, on the train to get
to wherever they were going for
the courthouse. So we have the
courthouse in Tula Rosa, but as
a practical matter.
What's that?
Carrizozo, yeah, thank you.
Yeah, so as a, as a practical
matter, um, the, the judges
usually don't live there and and
we staff and so forth,
complicated things. So we're,
we're talking about
redistricting quite a bit. And
we've also got several
districts, I think the 10th we
talked about the 10th or the
11th, where the caseload is just
um so out of proportion to what
other districts have in terms of
caseloads. So we're, we're
trying to talk about balancing
caseloads between the different
districts, and that might mean
redrawing districts, and that
creates all kinds of different
things.
You create new judicial
districts, judges, incumbencies,
retirements, district attorneys.
Yeah, all of those kind of
things, courthouse locations,
but we really do need to begin
thinking about a modern
judiciary, I think, and, and
realizing that the population is
really shifting in certain
places. That's another subject
and, um, and then the last thing
is I'll just talk a little bit
briefly about
The matter of GPS, uh,
monitoring one of the subjects
is not in the special session,
but I know it's been important
to the governor before has been
the issue of, of presumptions
and pre-trial detention. We've
talked quite a bit about that
before.
The GPS monitoring as an
alternative maybe to to jailing
people awaiting trial.
We in the legislature passed
some uh part of that crime
omnibus bill we put some
language in there about
Access to GPS data. I think it's
important for us to know how
that works, whether it's working
or not, um.
When we passed that legislation,
I'll just let the committee know
from my perspective, Chief, you
can uh respond and see maybe a
different perspective, but when
we passed that legislation, the
court very quickly after that
passed a rule that that in, in
my mind conflicted.
With what the legislature
passed. And, and I want to
appreciate the fact that uh uh
Chief then Chief Justice Shannon
Bacon met with me, I think with
Arie too, I expressed my
concerns in the court revised
the rule, and I appreciated that
dialogue and that give and take
as well too. So, um, I hope that
we'll get to a place where
there's a lot of sharing of
information and, and we're
working together really as, as a
team and and and to that, Madam
Chair, then I'm on, on two last
points, um, Mr. Chief, not to,
not to create a bad situation or
make it worse, but, but have you
had a chance to meet with?
Governor at all since you became
Chief Justice?
Um, I
Personally, I have not. Um, we,
we met as a group to discuss the
issues you're talking about
today in a very large sort of
stakeholder group with counties
and others.
Um,
Uh, one on one, I've not done
that, um.
Normally we do reach out and we
will be doing.
Yeah, and I, I, I encourage you
to do so. I mean, I know you're
only a few months into the job
or a couple of months in the
job, but, but I, I, I, I think
that it's essential that we as a
legislature are working with the
executive. The executives
working with us cooperatively
and likewise, we're working
cooperatively with the judiciary
and the governor somehow able to
communicate with the judiciary
as well too, so I, I hope you'll
get that chance. that's a good
suggestion and, and I'll make
that effort.
Thank you. Thank you, Madam.
Thank you, Senator. Madam Chair,
yes sir. Um, I, I neglected to
raise pretrial, um, one thing I
did want to raise.
Thanks to center's questions on.
GPS is sort of a separate thing.
I, I did want a race. We, we
amended.
A pretrial rule.
Um,
To account for
Uh
Those individuals to pick up a
new truck strike that new crime.
While they are in conditions of
release, so they come to you as
a judge, say I'm gonna let you
go, but don't go do something
and they go do something.
Um,
And we now have uh as of
yesterday, there's 285 cases.
Where a defendant has been
placed on what we call is a 403
hole.
So they're held because they
have to answer to the initial
judge.
For your work, because I heard a
little bit of the DA's
presentation.
I will tell you, we continue to
have headwinds, I will describe
them as headwinds.
With large
Uh, OK, MDC because MDC picks up
a lot of these folks that picked
up their original charges in
other parts of the state.
And we continue to communicate
with them to ensure that judges
in other parts of the state have
access to those defendants on
those conditions of.
Um, and so that is ahead when we
I want to let you know that.
Thank you much. Thank you, Mr.
Chief Justice. We have
And if Jay represented Lujan,
and then Senator Nyburn.
Thank you, Madam Chair, and Mr.
Chief Justice and already and
first Artie, congratulations and
you deserve.
Whatever fun you've got planned.
Thanks for all your hard work.
Um.
Uh
Chief Justice, I think I have a
really simple question. If it's
not, you don't have to answer
it, but when we were spending a
lot of time on this committee on
AOT learning about it and so
forth. We had discussed the fact
that there could be some
Pilot projects and I, I was told
that the first was ready to do a
pilot project, the 4th and then
2nd, um, wanted to resume.
and then um and Diana County,
they, they've never stopped
doing theirs. Do we need to
change the law on AOT before
those pilot projects could
begin.
Um,
So I won't intrude into
obviously what your prerogative
is, which is to change the law,
but I will say this we have an
AOT.
Statute on the books that is
operable. We can use it. We've
used it.
Um,
So I
If I were a legislator or a
practitioner, I wouldn't
envision any need for huge
changes.
What is um
You described the areas
correctly. Um, there could
possibly be a slight um
clarification in the statute.
It would allow
The AOC to fund directly with
the county. There's this MOU
process. This is pretty
unworkable and quite frankly is
created, I think some of the
obstacles in the second
judicial.
So I, I
Unlike the competency statute or
if you want to go into the
criminal code, I can, I can line
up statutes that need help.
Um, but
ALT I think as it exists, we
would not be suggesting any
changes in this. The mechanics.
Of how it is done. I think
certainly.
The critical things and why the
1st, the 3rd.
And the 4th are something we can
act on fairly quickly is because
they have the resources.
Thank you very much, um, but
perhaps we need more advice from
you and, and we need to look at
what our, our job is too. Thank
you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you, um, Leader Chasey,
Representative Lujan.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Um.
Appreciating all the comments
and everything being made um
regards to um the mental health
council and, and, um.
The, the work that they've been
doing uh on legislation because
I've been part of the work
that's being done and I and the
continued work and what they
asked for was this time through
the interim to develop and
fully.
To, to Senator Wirth's question
on an update of what we're doing
in a meeting and really digging
in with all hands on the deck,
if you will, to make sure that
this piece of legislation is, is
just and is addressing all the
issues along with the Samsung
models and putting together a
team.
To really, really deep dive deep
into what what they want to um
present to the legislature in
the 60 day, um, with that, I
really want to thank uh
Justice for being here. Um, and
say thank you to Mr. Pippin for
all his work and good luck on
your retirement. We're gonna,
uh, I don't know that you ever
really retire, we might see you
around these halls, um, but
thank you for your service. Um,
and really distinguishing, um,
Madam Chair, as we've been
learning here, the the
difference between AOT and
competency.
And for those reasons, that's
why we are looking to improve
our statutes, if you will, and,
and really taking a deep dive.
This is a
I just came from LFC, Madam
Chair Socorro, and they did a a
deep dive into some of the.
The, the issues, particularly in
the 2nd district.
And some of the things that
they, that they, they talked
about, um, for expanding access
to behavioral health coverage
and substance abuse treatment is
key to addressing recidivism,
which we are really trying to
address and looking at
uh population uh through
competency. Uh, one of the
things they said is expanding
access to Medicaid post-release,
expanding access to
map release and to ensure that
NMCD is continuously
implementing its success.
That recidivism, uh, reducing
programs.
And with that we saw, we talked
about all the different programs
we have in our courts, and this
is something that justice you
and I have spoken about, and I'd
like, if you would at all kind
of expand, and what we found in
the information we received from
LFC was that we have all these,
these court programs for
behavioral health, um.
Um, other disorders and, and so
forth, and they're not being
fully used.
And so I'd like to maybe have
some feedback from you on that,
Madam Chair. You would.
Oh.
Um, Madam Chair, representative,
thank you for the questions.
So we talked about AOT and
competency, another area on the
criminal diversion would be what
we call treatment courts.
Um,
And those courts target prior
attempted to target and
A quasi-scientific way, uh.
Things like substance abuse.
Um, DWI courts, some mental
health courts.
Um,
But I urge.
In
Those have just sort of sprung
up from the courts out of need
because the volume is so great.
He, you know, I travel around
the state and visit these
district courts. I was down in
Demming.
A couple weeks ago, and there's
an individual that is just
committed.
To
Um, their treatment courts, and
it's been very successful. They
have.
A
Uh, for all the graduates, they
do a Thanksgiving dinner.
I mean,
They are committed to it, but
it's kind of informal.
And it's by district, so AOC has
tried to create a system,
especially in mental health
courts.
That those are certified, right?
There's a process by which.
You
Um, have your treatment court
certified in the state and it
must meet some kind of
Best practices. That's
important, so we operate the
same throughout the state, and
more importantly, it can be
measured. So we can come back
and say, here's what the
recidivism rate is.
Some of it is fairly
self-selective. It's people that
want to.
Um, he's successful, will choose
that, but they are.
I mean, it, it works.
Um,
But it if there's one thing to
work on, it's to make sure
representative that those
programs are consistent
throughout the.
Like omitting anything on our
treatments.
Uh, Chief, I don't think so.
They are broad in scope as a
representative said, everything
from um young adult court in
Albuquerque, which they're not
going to start one in the 12th
district, Lincoln and Otaro
County, a fantastic program.
Veterans courts for folks with
specific issues usually
involving PTSD and perhaps
substance abuse many times
co-occurring disorders that the
courts see and all the, all the
programs exist because
Um,
From our perspective, then
interrupts the cycle of criminal
repetitive criminal behavior,
and of course, gets people on
the right track to make them
productive community members.
It's hard work. It's often much
more work than if they just
the sentence and went and did
their time.
Um
They're wonderful programs and
we appreciate the um funding.
That's one of the things AOC
does is make sure the programs
get funded for the courts.
And as you mentioned, um, follow
best practices, national
standards, certifications.
Um, to make sure we're, we're
spending your money wisely and I
think the data piece is critical
for us to report.
What what we do with the money
and and why we think it works.
Thank you man. I just think it's
important that we start looking
at those that those data sets to
understand where those courts
are working or maybe there's a
consolidation of courts or what
needs to be done and maybe a
study of of further study uh to
understand why they're being
underutilized when we have a
crisis at hand, Madam Chair. The
other thing I'd like to say is
um to expanded access to
behavioral health coverage and
substance abuse treatment is key
to to recidivism, as we're
discussing.
And over a statewide data um
mapping that we saw from LFC
this week, Madam Chair, um,
we're looking at 959% of
Um, those incarcerated have a, a
mental health disorder and 65%
are dealing with substance use
disorders. I think that.
It's underlined is and why we're
having these hearings is to
really get to the, the source of
what we really need to do in a
holistic way. And I really want
to say again, thank you, Madam
Chair, for having all these
additional hearings and that's
getting into these
conversations. I want to thank
Justice Brianna Samoa for her
leadership. She's already uh
been with us for a hearing to
for us to understand um what
their, what AOC is doing, um.
And the legislation that they're
working on. Thank you so much,
Madam.
Thank you, Representative, we
have Senator Nibert and
Represented Brego and then
represented Alcon.
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank
you, Chief Justice.
I was pleased to hear at the
beginning of your remarks to say
that the legislature sets public
policy and, and really
appreciate the judiciary
recognizing that. I think that's
an issue that
Maybe this body, we haven't been
as vigilant as protecting uh the
constitutional powers afforded
the legislative branch and let
some of that uh kind of slip,
slip here and there, but I
appreciate your recognizing that
and the deliberative process
that we go through to, to set
that public policy sometimes
individuals like myself disagree
with it or, or what have you,
but the body does set uh uh the
public policy for the.
State.
And I would encourage you and
your colleagues.
On the parents to to
Remain vigilant so that the
judiciary does not.
Engage in in
Legislative actions and and over
my career.
Uh, you know, have been things
that have concerned me coming
from the bench and so as the
Chief Justice, I hope you'll
remain vigilant to uh uh try to
avoid the temptation to do so on
occasion and, and continue to
recognize the uh legislature. is
the one setting the public
policy.
Yes sir
Like you said, we, we do remain
vigilant in that. We
Long-standing doctrines, we do
try and avoid.
addressing constitutional
questions and statutes if we can
avoid them.
Um, and through our
A statutory interpretation, I
agree with you. You write what
you write sometimes you may
agree with it, disagree with it,
but that.
What is in the statute.
Thank you very much. Thank you,
Senator. um Representative
Barrega.
Sure, um, Honorable Chief
Justice Thompson, thank you for
being here, Mr. Pepin. Thank you
for being here. Um, I just would
like to say, Madam Chair, and
your discussion, uh, Chief
Justice of criminal criminal
competency, which I am not an
attorney, by the way, I am a
city planner, so ask me about
land use and I'll be happy to
engage, um,
Your discussion actually helped
me understand better the whole
issue of criminal competency,
and I can't say that I
understand it totally, but I, I
got a better understanding today
of the difference between the
court system and AOT and how it
could relate to each other and
how it could maybe help improve.
People's lives who are
struggling with addiction or um
behavioral health issues, Madam
Chair. Um, and, you know, we
don't all come from the same
place. There's.
People from different walks of
life up here, so we see things
differently, um.
I, and I, I just have to kind of
joke a little bit, Madam Chair,
because having listened to you,
Chief Justice, today, I almost
feel like we need to start
paying our judges hazardous duty
pay because, I mean, honestly,
there are some issues that we
don't think about every day in
the court system that people
will go into those areas with
guns, and, you know, that is
really a a concern in our world
today.
Um, but your availability to
this legislature has been
without a doubt.
Wonderful. And I, I, I really
appreciate um listening to you,
understanding the work that you
do, and the judges on a daily
basis. Um,
You know, the other day, Madam
Chair, my mom, I, I stayed with
her and there are a lot of
people walking in Espanola, a
lot of pedestrians, a lot. I
mean, like, it went from
52.
50
Overnight, and she's in her 90s
and she asked me why are there
so many people and and people
that look like they're, you
know,
It was a really hard thing for
me to explain to her.
About substance abuse and
behavioral health. I mean, I
just as an average Joe, average
Jane or whatever, it was hard to
explain to someone in her 90s
that was used to living a very
quiet life in a small town and
seeing this sort of
Infusion of people that we've
never seen before in our small
community, um, you know, it was
hard to explain, and I just
can't imagine what the courts
are dealing with.
Um, I hope that in our
Either special session or in the
60 day session, we can move
forward and try to
And I talked about this earlier,
Madam Chair, the linkages that
we need to
Create stronger bonds between
the court system, the police,
you know, the behavioral health
systems, the um services that
the state provides for
behavioral health. I hope that
we can strengthen those, and I,
and, and that is really my
vision for this either special
session or
The 60 day session that's coming
up, I think all of these
discussions are really helpful
in providing um
Providing that insight for
people that are not in the in
the court system every day. Um,
so I wanna just thank you,
honorable, for being here and uh
for giving us some new insight.
Well, you can tell your mom.
Um, number one, I understand.
What you're talking about.
The public is viewing this.
It's an issue, without a doubt.
Um,
The conversation that was had
not that long ago include the
first judicial, which
Includes Ria Reb, of course, and
Canola
And included the judge that sits
up there, that deals with this
stuff all the time.
Um, and I thought it was very
productive conversation.
County was there both Santa Fe
County and Viriba.
Um, the trial court judges that
see this and the policymakers
that
Write the bills and then provide
the.
So, it is difficult.
But I don't think anyone's
throwing their hands up. People
are attacking it.
Adressing it.
Um, and that's the important
thing.
Thank you very much, Chief
Justice. I have one more for
you, um, Representative Vcom.
And
Thank you, uh, Madam Chair, uh,
I just wanna go on a personal
note and uh wish Mr. Pippin, uh,
good luck. I think if we go on
record, he's probably going to
be the longest lasting uh person
who's has held that position,
and I can remember cause before
uh Hardy came in.
Uh, that position was like, uh.
Uh, it changed every 3 months to
6 months, so.
Are congratulations, you lasted
a long time, but I I lasted you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Representative. Yes,
we are a difficult group.
It is surprising anyone lasts
longer than 3 months. Hardy's
been a tremendous job and she
probably write a book about how
to deal with difficult people.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Well, um, any concluding
remarks, Chief Justice?
Um,
Maybe I should turn over already
for a closing statement here,
um, no concluding remarks, I
think the legislature, this
committee in particular, um,
As the DA mentioned, we are
available to answer your
questions. This is part of the
process.
Um, we need to be available, um,
To let you know.
What is going on in the
judiciary so you can make your
informed decisions.
Um
There was, I think, a request
and we can pick it up now or
later, we are, of course, have a
unified budget and we are now
going through our internal
process.
I'm driving to Albuquerque to.
And the Supreme Court budget.
One side is done, if there's any
request to
Um, have just a summary of what
our unified budget is, we're
pleased to do that.
Um, in closing and I'll leave it
already. I wanna thank you
again. I know.
Um, what you have in front of
you again, is difficult.
Not overwhelming.
Um,
You have handled, we have
handled difficult things before.
Um, uh, way good government
works is everybody does their
best to try and take care of it.
We will play our role
Stay out of your role.
So I think I would already wanna
any, any other closing?
Well, it certainly has been a
pleasure to appear in front of
this committee. You're two
different committees on the
House and the Senate over the
years, always got a good
reception, not always got
everything that we wanted, but
That's the way the process
works. I appreciate you and your
predecessors uh for um hearing
us and uh both publicly and
privately and listening and
giving us at least a chance to
make our case and I think uh
between the branches of
government or among the branches
of government, that's a critical
piece, being able to communicate
with each other in a civil way.
Um,
That's probably all I should say
about that.
And uh chief mentioned the
budget, um.
I'll forego my opportunity to
talk about, well, no, I gotta
say one thing. You will see a
significant request from us, I'm
pretty sure has to approve the
budget once the budget committee
does internally.
For employees salary increases,
we are way behind the executive.
You'll see an awful lot of data
on this if it all gets fuzzy,
uh, please call me or my
successor Carl would be happy to
come talk to you one on one, go
to your districts and talk to
you, uh, meet with you when
you're here in the legislature.
That is the most significant
proposal I think that I'm
leaving behind, uh, as the 60
day session comes along next
when I, I will be retired.
Um, and I know you'll give it
serious consideration. It's,
it's really critical and it's
affecting our ability to serve
the public, uh, uh, in, in ways
that are really easily fixed
because it only takes money and
um I, I know you have some, and
we'd appreciate if you could
direct some of it to our
employees. You'll see the
proposal is uh stratified.
Very clearly toward the folks
who make the least amount of
money and struggle the most with
the inadequate salaries we pay
them in the judiciary, even
relative to the executive, so,
uh, I know you'll give it a fair
hearing and uh I'll be
listening. Thank you.
So I personally want to thank
you, Artie. I've gotten to know
you and these past few years
working with you on.
Really um respected your
insights on many of the things
that we discussed in your
courtesy in presenting to us in
this committee as well as in
House Judiciary. So with that,
let's all thanks to Ari. Thank
you.
Enjoy your retirement, Artie.
OK
Thank you, Chief Justice.
So, um, we will soon be
entertaining a motion to go into
executive session. We're gonna
be briefed on
What's happening with Texas
versus New Mexico, which is a.
Important water case that we've
been involved in for many years.
I don't quite a long time. Um,
so with that, uh,
I'm happy to ask the presenters
to come up and
People might want to start
thinking about um leaving the
room.
We'll soon have a motion to.
Go into executive session.
OK, and someone.
Madam chair.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Madam Chair, I move that this
committee going into executive
session to discuss matters of
Litigation, pending litigation
and that we will limit our
discussion to that litigation
for another purpose.
Is there a second?
Yeah, we'll, we'll start
identifying people that we don't
know in a minute. Any a second
for that.
OK. Any opposition to going into
executive session?
He pending litigation. I see no
