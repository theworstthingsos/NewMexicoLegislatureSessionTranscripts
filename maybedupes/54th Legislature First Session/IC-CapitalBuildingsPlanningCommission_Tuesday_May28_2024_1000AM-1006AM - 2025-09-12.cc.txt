Mr Speaker or Secretary Doucet,
do you want, does one of you
on a chair and just get through the
first two
items?
>> I I'll defer to secretary if
he's ok doing that if they're OK
doing that. I'm uh I'm on
the road,
>> Mr Speaker, you got me
before I could be
nice and say you could do
it.
So
it does feel like a Monday.
Ok. Let's call the meeting to
order. Is there
approval of the
agenda?
So is
there a
second?
This is Wesley on second.
Thank you. All those in
favor signify by saying
hi,
I
may oppose saying,
hey, motion
carries, ok.
The next
approval of the minutes for April
10th 2020
24. Is there motion
a motion to
approve the
minutes?
So I moved.
Thank you, Mr Speaker is here a
second
roughly one second.
Thank you. All
those, all those in
favor signified by saying
iii
a post a
motion carries
all the next item
is an action item,
uh review and
approval of the Master Plan
contract,
Mr Director. I'll
turn it over to
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Secretary.
Uh
So
we at the
direction of the commission,
we issued an
RFP on
April 19th which
were and the responses were due
on May the 10th.
Um We only received
one proposal
and that was from architectural research
consultants who
also happened to be uh
observing at the
moment. Uh
The
proposal from
architectural research consultants
arc for short
uh was reviewed
by staff
and they were the only
ones
and we gave them
um the,
the top score basically
100% because
they were the ones who responded,
but also because they have all, they
have been the
contractor for the capital
Billions Planning Commission for,
I believe, a little over 20
years, but they have
responded to every RFP
since that time.
Um
And so the recommendation from
staff
uh Mr
chairman and members
of the commission is
that you approve the
Legislative Council service to
enter into a contract
with the Capitol Buildings Planning
Commission.
The there is no
set amount on the
contract uh
because it's through an
RFP. It is
dependent on the appropriations
issued or, or appropriated,
I should say by
the
legislature.
And for this fiscal
year, for this coming fiscal year,
2025
the legislature included
uh $250,000
for the work of
the commission,
uh uh and
whoever you select to be the
contractor um
that
that money and,
and the, the
contract is primarily
for um
master planning services
for three major
areas. Las Cruces,
Albuquerque and Santa Fe
and additionally,
the um,
um, the, the
maintenance of the
statewide
property and
facilities inventory.
Uh I believe the
legislative, um,
uh, the, excuse me, I believe
Arc or the Capitol Building Planning
Commission actually is the only one that
has a,
um,
a, an
inventory that
encompasses all
of state government.
Uh It's never at 100%
because there are always
changes. Uh Either
new buildings, demolitions,
changes in, in places
where uh property
or excuse me, space is
leased and the like, but
it's usually about
um
95 98%
up to date. It just
changes constantly and they,
they've been the ones Arc
has been the ones to maintain
that. Uh
And I noticed that
um Senator Mimi Stewart,
President Pro TEM is on
as well so we can
mark her as present.
Um I don't know if you
heard my
overview uh Senator,
but uh I was just mentioning
that we issued the
RFP. It was due on May 10th.
We only got one response from
ARC. It's been
evaluated by staff and our
recommendation is for
the commission to allow us to
proceed to enter
into a contract
with
um
uh Arc.
Uh For this,
the only thing I will mention is
that we may
um actually enter
into two contracts.
We want to get this set
up in a way that
um we do one
from
June.
Uh I think it was sixth
through June 30
June 30th and then
enter into a new contract
starting uh
Ju July 1st
so that we can make
sure that that coincides
with fiscal year and,
and, and, and
beginning and end
and with that, um
Mr Chairman,
I'll stand for
questions.
>> Are there any questions from any of
the
members
not hearing any? Is
there a motion to approve
the Master planning contract
proposal? As the
director stated,
the two contracts for the end
of this fiscal year and start in July
1st of the new
fiscal year.
>> So move.
>> Thank you. Is there a
second?
>> We've determined
we don't really need seconds.
We're going against
me since all these
years.
>> Thank you.
Ok. All those they were
signified by saying
I
any posting name
motion carries.
So the next agenda
item is the
German.
So thank you
very
much.
>> Thank you everyone. I appreciate
the uh the quick
meeting and the support
and uh
Andy and John, we will
be in touch with you on the
contracts. >> All
right. Well, thank you very much.
We are honored again
to be working
with you all you folks.
Thank you very much. Yes.
Thank you.
>> Thank you everyone. >> Thank
you. Thank
you. >> Bye.
