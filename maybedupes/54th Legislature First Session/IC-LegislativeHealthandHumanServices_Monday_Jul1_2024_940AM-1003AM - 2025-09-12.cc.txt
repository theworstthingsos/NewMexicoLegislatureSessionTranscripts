Went into art,
went to the
school for Visual Arts
in New York in an
internship that was
fully paid for by the school for
Visual Arts. So
a real compliment to her
and to our program and she's
continuing at UN
M with work
in science
and in art.
>> Thank you very much for that. That's
all I have, Mr
Chairman.
>> Any. Yes, Representative
Jones.
>> Thank you so much for thank
you Mr Chair and thank you for your
presentation and, and
the good report about
uh your nursing program.
How many years have you had
the nursing program here?
>> Yeah, it wouldn't be much if I said
two, right?
But well, over 10
years,
>> quite the record that with
100% graduation
are the passing the testing.
That's, that's
amazing.
Um I I
know all throughout the
years, one of the problems
with
the nursing having a nursing
shortage is that we don't have
nursing instructors. Have you
had more nursing
students or
um you know, waiting list
trying to get into the nursing
program because of a lack of
instructors,
>> Mr Chairman
Representative Jones.
Um we,
we have been able
to retain a good number
of our nursing instructors.
We also are one of
the the key elements of a
partnership with Holy
Cross is that very often
employees from Holy Cross
are also teaching in our program
on a part time basis.
Um And we've recently
hired new tenure track
faculty and, and
nursing. When I talked
about the impact of the
nursing enhancement
funds that has
really allowed us
to provide
professional development,
to provide um funds
for really enhancing
our faculty, our nursing faculty
that have made a real big difference.
I would also say that when you
have a very strong
program, as evidenced by
those scores, you're able
to attract people to teach
in that program because
they see that the program is
effective.
Um So all of
those things are are helping
us attract and retain a
high quality of nursing
faculty.
We um
are able to admit,
I believe 16 nursing
students per cohort
because of the the
contact and all of the
experiences that, that
they need to have in the program.
It's not a huge
number, but it does speak to
the quality of interaction
and preparation that they have
during their time in the program,
we would typically have
um some additional
students who might be
admitted. And
um we typically there's
something called melt. We may
have students who have a hard time
finding housing even though they've
been accepted into the program.
So maybe they're in
outlying areas and really
need to move in closer to
Taos and that may make it more
challenging for them to,
to ultimately decide
to be in the nursing program
here. Um So the
factors that, that we
are dealing with in this
program are not
so much um the
difficulty of retaining faculty
but of more local
concerns such as housing.
I will mention that Dawn
Kittner, the director of our nursing
program is on your agenda, I
believe for Tuesday
afternoon and
I'm sure that she would actually be able
to give you even more
detailed answers than I
about the
program.
>> Thank you very much. I I
know, you know, each
community has its own
challenges and I think
housing is an issue we're having across
New Mexico. But
um it,
it would be
we, we need to do whatever we can
to, to make it more
likely that we put out nursing
students faster to
have. Your program is a
four year program,
correct?
>> Um Chairman and Representative
Jones, when a student comes through
our program, they're first
accepted to UN
M as
an associate degree
student, but they may
be jointly accepted
at University, New Mexico
Task and UN M for
the joint program. So
they would finish two years
of instruction in our pre
nursing and then continue
and have two more years in
the bachelor's program
taught here by our
faculty using U
and M curriculum.
>> I see. So you have
nurses. Let me see if I
understand that you have
associate degree
RNS who are going
through your bachelor's program? Is
that correct?
>> Chairman Representative
Jones, when a student
has completed the
four years, they, they
would be RNS. Yes.
Um, if they were only
completing two years, then they
would not be an RN
at the end of the program.
>> I see. Ok. Thank you very
much.
>> Representative Jones is
very interested in this because
as far as I know she is
the, the sole
nurse in the legislature at
this point.
Yeah.
Anybody else, any other, any
other questions,
Senator Rodriguez
back to you. But >> as it comes
up, I do have a question
when you mentioned that a Doctor
Guterres that after
two years they
can get an associates, of course.
But would that make them
an LP N used
to be a license? There
was an LP N and an
RN, an L PM
before you get your RN. Does that
still work or it doesn't know, tell
me somebody help me
here
>> chairman. I believe that the
nurse is
probably
Representative Jones to answer
this >> question? Thank
you. I'll tell
you what I know. And, and I'm
not real familiar with LP N
programs here in New Mexico now,
but, but I do know
that that graduating
from an accredited
nursing school or
nursing program
can mean an associate's
program
or a bachelor's
program. Um
And so that,
that makes one eligible
to take the registered
nurse licensure
exam. And
so what you're telling
me is, is you have a program,
a two year program that's
prerequisite for a
four year
accredited nursing
school. And so
you're those people who are,
are in the associates
plan, they're,
they're doing their prereqs
so that they can get into
that four year
program. But, but there
are other programs and I'm,
I'm not real familiar with them right
now, but I think there,
there has been one at
New Mexico Junior College.
I know there are others across
the state where it's
an accelerated
RN program, you can take
that same RN exam.
So um but
the LP N is a one
year program
and, and they might add a
few credits
in there. I I need to find out more
about that because we need to use
those LP N SI feel
like right now there's
such a shortage,
you know, ideally in a perfect
world, everybody's going to have
their four year degree. But right
now we need to do whatever
we can to have patients
taken care of and
have access to healthcare.
So that's one thing
I think I asked that when we were last
year in the interim committee, we
were in,
where were we? Las Vegas?
I think we were in Las Vegas
when you and M gave
us a presentation.
And how can we,
is there a way? I mean, I
know you all your specialty
is that four year
Bachelor's program,
but is there a way we can get
people at the bedside to take
care of patients sooner
and while they're on that track
for their four year degree.
So, did that make sense?
There are two year, there are
two associate's degree RNS
and there are four year bachelor's
degree RNS. So
thank you.
>> Thank you for clarifying
that. That's all I have Mister
Chairman.
>> Well, thank you
so much for, for the
welcome, but also
for updating us on, on what's
going on with the
Un M Taos
with the nursing program. And then
for your planning for other
expanded programs,
we're so badly in need.
I would assume that most of
your nursing graduates
remain in, in the
state, uh probably
even in the area.
Uh So
this is exactly the kind
of thing that we need to be fostering
in nursing, but
in counseling
and social work and
in psychology, in all
of the fields where we are
short and then in, in all the
ancillary health fields as
well, the physical
therapists and so on
it, it, it does not
come cheap to
replenish our workforce.
But boy, is it gonna be an
investment that will pay off in the
future if we do
it? So,
thank you so much, Doctor
Gutierrez. >> Thank you chairman,
members of the committee. It's a pleasure
and again, enjoy
your time in house >> and,
and Representative Jones
did get to see your campus
south of town this morning as
well. She, she spent some
time out there touring the
facility. >> Yeah, I,
I just did a Google
search on directions to U
and M to and that's where I
ended up this morning. So
beautiful.
>> You can see lots of our capital
dollars at work in
that particular campus.
Thank >> you. Thank you very
much. Um
members, we're gonna hold
off on the introductions of the
committee until our
three
stray sheep return to
the flock here. They're
having a little uh
meeting on a project they're
working on so they will be
back very soon and we'll
just move ahead then with
uh Doctor Harrison.
Jerry Harrison is going to be
our first
presentation
uh recruiting health care
professionals a
topic that we're all very
interested in. Do you have
anybody that's gonna join you or
you are you
at?
Thank you, write it
down.
Your, your
recruits are all waiting there right
there.
And members, I think you have a
handout already that
was passed out
on
uh Doctor Harrison's
presentation.
>> Good morning. Uh
Mr chairman and
members of the committee.
I really
want to thank you for
the invitation.
I'm a little stunned by
the high quality
of the agenda
that you've put together.
And
uh it strikes
very close to
home to me
because uh this
week marks my
30
first start of my
31st year of
being executive Director of New
Mexico Health Re
Resources.
It is a not for
profit recruiting
entity. I need
to point out that I am not a
lobbyist.
I
I am here to
provide
information
uh that maybe you've never heard
before about recruitment.
There are a lot of
things that we all
believe about
recruitment
that don't really
work for. For
example. Oh,
if you're up in the road, up the
road here in Red
River where
there's a little clinic
uh that I had
many years ago,
the opportunity to
recruit a dentist
who stayed there for 14
years
and there was a little
struggle after she
left to
find a replacement.
I'd like to get into a little
history. A
little, a few
definitions.
Uh I'd like to
talk a little bit about how
we work
and then make, make some
recommendations. I'm gonna make the
same recommendation that I've made
for the last four years,
which would, which is to
put some money into
recruitment and
particularly into behavioral
health recruitment. And
I would say 2
million and more.
Uh And I'm going to
surprise you with uh
with maybe some numbers about
how little
money is actually
going into
recruitment.
So first,
um
anyone who says that they know
what's going on in
the workforce
today
is delusional
from the point of view of
recruitment.
Because what I see
uh on Monday
mornings, I might
review 250
people looking for
work
and I have to
winnow those down to
say, oh, how
many might be interested in New
Mexico? How many have
really contacted
us with a
sincere interest
in New Mexico and New Mexico
communities.
So a little bit about health
resources
in about
1977
78. In that
time, a man
in Hidalgo County had
a cardiac event.
He was on the roof of his home,
Mr Hernandez
there. At that time,
there were no local
services
and Mr Hernandez
died,
his brother
Andres Hernandez,
who uh lived
in Santa Rosa.
Um
Max Bennett, a
health economist
at UN M
and Frank Hess,
a surgeon at
press came
up with the notion
that there needed to
be a not for profit
entity that would
recruit for
the most
difficult places
in New Mexico. The communities
that have the most difficult
uh
time in
terms of recruiting.
Now, back then,
they were on the basis that
there was, there were
300 estimated
nursing vacancies at
the time and you can tell
how, how well
health resources has done
in terms of uh
of uh fulfilling
uh that
initial nursing
obligation.
In 1981
the legislature
passed something called the Real
Primary Health Care Act.
The first component
of that act
is the
funding that
we have
received at health resources
since
1981.
Uh So it's
a, it's an older
program as, as far
as state programs, not for
profits. Uh go,
we're partially
funded with state
dollars. Uh
We receive
uh on the order
of
$372,000
from the Department of Health
strictly those
are our recruitment funds.
And if you have questions
about how we use that
and the methods,
I'm very happy
to get into it because it gets
a little complicated.
There are three
types of
recruiters.
We are a sourcing
agency.
We uh
do a tremendous
amount of outreach
nationally and even
internationally to find
people who are
interested
in uh in New Mexico
or might be interested
in New Mexico.
And
that's one type of
recruiter. Another
type of recruiter is an
in-house recruiter,
someone that works
for an organization
and takes
referrals or seeks
referrals or actually
uh does some
work uh
uh to try
to find them and
then they'll
run through the hiring
process, for example.
And then there are
headhunter.
Um We are
not headhunter. Everybody
at health resources
is salaried
and get no extra,
for example,
for preferring a for
for-profit entity
versus a not for
profit entity.
That's not
uh what we're about. And
I have had the experience in
my past life
as a behavioral health
administrator to be an
in-house recruiter,
but I've, I've never done
headhunting. Uh If
you
will,
excuse
me,
we receive
funding that is very
specific in its
nature coming
from the Rural Primary Health Care
Act and that
those funds are for
primary care physicians,
nurse practitioners,
physician assistants,
dentist,
dental
assistants.
And that's
it.
There are no funds
that we have available
unless we generate
the funds somehow
which we do through some
flow through uh federal
contracts and
from our own efforts
in recruiting
money. But there's no
money specifically
set aside for
behavioral health
recruitment.
And that's, that's a
function of an old
not for profit funding
and how things work
in terms of how
increases
are
made.
Excuse
me,
we run
two,
two different websites.
One is our own, it's in the,
in the handout and you can take a look
at it and that
allows candidates
to enter their
information,
which is the best way to
recruit. We do a
lot of outreach
going to, for
example, in
uh this evening
in Alamogordo, some
of our folks are meeting with the
residents uh
at, at the hospital there,
taking them out to dinner.
And we're, we're gonna try to
get them to, to stay
in New Mexico. They,
they've got another year to
go, but we need
to outreach with them.
We do a lot of that kind
of thing in state.
We also travel
the country.
Well, I haven't been traveling for
two years because of a bad knee
but others in, in my
organization have been traveling
the country, going
to training programs,
going to
um uh
career fairs,
going to trade group meetings
and doing two things. Looking
for New Mexicans who might
be in training. We're going to
Kansas City at the
end of this month and we're going
to meet with the
uh family physician,
uh annual meeting.
Uh And uh
we typically
run into someone from New
Mexico. We try to get those
folks to come back.
We also try to
find uh
um
uh folks
that might be interested
in New Mexico. We
do that with
a collaborative collaboration
among the 50
states. Uh
I've given you a website,
the three, our net.org
that's kind of a collaborative
of not for profit
organizations. We
pool our money so
that we can go, for
example, to Kansas City, there may
be six or eight states that
show up and we'll
have, I don't know,
maybe 3
400 family physicians
to, to deal with
that uh exhibit
might cost $15,000
but we just split
the cost and then
recruit for everybody and
we recruit for ourselves
a little bit about uh
what we did.
This is from the last
year, by the way, uh because
we haven't closed out the
numbers for, for this year
yet. We had,
uh we generated uh about
2200
contacts. Those
are people that have
indicated to
us that they
have an interest in New Mexico.
And we, we
receive those through a
variety of ways,
advertising,
uh going
to, uh for
example, the NPP
A and uh
medical residency programs
at UN M. We go
to the B A MD
program and
meet with them
every year to try
to encourage them to a
stick it out and let
them know about loan repayment,
loan for service. Uh
Those types of things
we made uh about
1200 referrals.
We're pretty strict about
what we do in, in referring.
Uh We will not refer
anyone without a resume.
Uh One of the things
that we
provide a function
for a lot of not
for profit organizations
is they can't afford
to do recruitment.
They can't afford to have a
recruiter. They
can't, uh, attend
national meetings and
guess what? They don't
have any training on how
to recruit. Very
oftentimes, the recruiter
is an administrative
assistant who has been
assigned to
talk to Doctor Harrison
about coming to
work.
Or it's the
CEO who
is, uh, having
to,
um,
oh,
do recruiting
on top of all
of the duties associated with
being a
CEO.
The other thing is a
lot of organizations
in the, in the state don't really
have hr
departments.
Again, there are
people who have
been hired to do a
job many years
ago when there were six
of us working at health
resources, we would
travel the state and
meet with
uh the CEO
S whomever was
doing the recruiting and
do some training with them.
But we only have three and a
quarter, uh FTEs
uh to do that work. And we
pretty much have
had to restrict a lot of
even our,
um,
our state, uh,
travel.
I always get asked about
physicians. How many physicians
are you recruiting? And
by the way, my number
one recommendation to
improve
the
health status
within behavioral
health is
to
recruit
more primary
care providers.
The reality is a lot of
New Mexicans who
have mental
health
issues, also
have substance abuse
issues and
those sub many of
those folks are treating
themselves because they've
gone undiagnosed
with other issues.
And the best vehicle
from my perspective
is to have
primary care
providers.
Um,
the primary care
physicians,
the nurse
practitioners
and the pas if we
have more of
them, we will
be able to help more
people on the road
to recovery in
um with mental
health and substance abuse
issues. But going back to physicians.
