Back in our
webcast with Legislative
council. I'm
going to ask the
speaker to explain
uh what we did
in Executive Session.
>> Thank you, madam President and,
and Members uh Mr.
Biaa. This council
has
approved a
pay increase
for you uh starting
this pay period to
the maximum allowed
under your current pay
band. Uh
That is
a very small token
of this
body's appreciation
of your work of
your public service over
many years to this
institution and
to the entire entire State of
New Mexico. Uh
It goes without saying
that any member of this
body as well as Members
of the public who have ever
had the
opportunity to interact
with. You can
honestly say that you've always
suited them, treated us with
respect, uh treated
this institution with
the deference that it deserves.
Um And you've served
honorably uh
for uh
for decades
here in this body. And, and
so, you know, I I this is not
a goodbye. We've got several more very
difficult meetings uh that
you'll have to
sit at the witness
table for over the next few
months. Uh This pay increase
will start this current pay period and,
and carry through the end of your
employment here with the
council, with the
legislature uh at
the end of August. So,
um on behalf of this council,
thank you for your service and
thank you for everything that you've done
for the people of the
State.
