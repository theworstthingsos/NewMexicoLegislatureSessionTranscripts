Thank you Mr speaker and

Why I believe this should be hi
this the amendment should be
Some of the challenges in court
and the Supreme Court were to
determine that what we have
passed is unconstitutional.
that's the only way this
the bill goes forward as

We can also around here and say
we don't think that this runs

something the you entered
earlier the the I couldn't hear
not get to hear your response Mr
speaker.
Mr speaker you came the response
earlier on whether or not a
legislative member was able to
use these little funds and I did
not get to hear that response I
I said is the as for programs
created.
Such as this program
we say out of an abundance of
caution.
Thank you Mr speaker
back to the to the to the bill
and
that time
We've had the ability and our
organization uses some of our
and we to funding and and in no
to people we
are requests to people are more.
we never came just a grant we
back to a grant but and then no
point ever did we take our state
taxpayers money just given to
individuals in New this one
The this does violate our anti

I've had over the last eleven
years The New Mexico economic
development department come back

did not cross second title

like trust me we're good yeah
truly concerned over this I I
have.
we talked about the hardships on
our ship on businesses but we
So the hardship on businesses
comes from the overbearing over
over over you over.
Over governance that we have
right now so
can go back through over eleven

of funds it doesn't start.
And so not being able to see the
commentary from the two are from
the committees of the cell went
to rural

was to be given out that the
that the the loaning agent or
Mr speaker and gentleman let's
step back a little bit that was
a lengthy question and I'd like
to respond Mr speaker and

lady Mister speaker and I.
Right a point made by one of
your colleagues and that is a
one of the concerning things for
me is so moving the where the
money's coming from the
severance tax fund to the
Mr speaker gentle lady.
This is my understanding that
there were issues being raised
lady you'll recall that
That is one of the requirements
of the severance tax fund I
think
that provision and the insertion
of the use of the general fund
Mr speaker and gentle lady on
that that particular issue is no

Does this go to new creating new
job growth why can't we use it
for losses instead of creating

asked them about loan programs
in the I just want to the Mr
speaker and gentle lady it's fun
everybody in this house to know
we're struggling a small
businesses and
I'm a for bringing this bill to
the front and that was I guess I
would like to ask the gentle
lady is is that your was that
your perspective in bringing
gentle lady that I have been get
hearing loud and clear is
although the loan programs have
been appreciated what is more
needed and what is more critical
that is what the goal of this

question gentle lady and Mr
speaker.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
representative I applaud your

states that have an anti
