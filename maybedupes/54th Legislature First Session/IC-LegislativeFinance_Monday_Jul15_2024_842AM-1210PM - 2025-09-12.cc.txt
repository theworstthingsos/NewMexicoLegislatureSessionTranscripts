Thank you.
Oh, yep, good
morning, everyone. We'll get started this
morning. Uh Senator,
you want to start, start on that room with
introductions.
Uh Good morning, Mr. Chair, of
course, uh Members of the
legislative finance Committee
to our guests. It's really great
to go ahead and be here in
Socorro and in,
particularly in this
particular
room.
Uh The late
Joe Fidel, Senator
Joe Fidel was a very
strong mentor. Uh
and he uh shared
so much with me over the years.
So to be here in this
facility really
means a lot just
bringing the people together,
of course, is
uh instrumental and it's key
to everything that we do. So as
we go forward in the
hearings, uh here
in Socorro, I hope that more
information is brought forward,
particularly as we deal with the
mental health issues.
Uh It really is part of
the future of New
Mexico's well-being
of New Mexico State, Senator
Pete Campos
representing all our parts
of seven counties in
Northeastern New Mexico.
Uh We're dealing with uh
several issues as we all
have throughout the years when we
dealt with the pandemic
going into the fires and
floods and now with the additional
rains in Las
Vegas dealing with
some additional water issues.
But uh as everything
else, we continue to stay
strong, uh
Diho
Semper Delante, we continue to
mov'e forward. Thank you very much,
Mr.
Chair.

northeast corner of the
State. And it's always
a pleasure to
be in Socorro
and at New Mexico
Tech to see
all the innovative things
that happen in this university.
It's just totally
amazing.
This is the place where
things
start
and a lot of research is
done. A lot of
outside money comes in
here to,
uh, generate
the research and
we're very appreciative of
this university.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
All right, good morning, Mr. Chair,
Mr. Vice Chair and Mr. Sali.
Good morning, everybody. Thank you very
much for having us. I'm State Senator Michael
Petty. I'm over here in the corner.
The senate Majority whip.
I thoroughly enjoy coming
to Socorro. It's a very quick drive for
me. I saw some of the beautiful
alfalfa fields that had just been
cut and it just reminds
me of home. So thank you very much
and thanks for being so kind to us. Thank
you.
>> Good morning, Steve Neville Senate
District two, which is the eastern
part of Farmington Aztec
Bloomfield, Navajo Lake
area. Uh, always
enjoy coming down here used to
make the drive a lot when I was in
colledge. I cruised through
town here and to New
Mexico State, but I always enjoyed
this. Uh coming to this campus. I've
been here a number of times with committees
and so forth and I
appreciate the hospitality.
Thank
you.
>> Good morning, Mr.
Chairman, Vice Chair
and uh, to our Members
and to our audience.
I'm a Senator Roberto
Bobby J Gonzalez. I
represent uh part
of Los Alamos, Riaa,
Santa Fe and
Taos and Mr.
Chairman. The best news
that I have is, um,
I have a brand new
granddaughter
and very
interesting that I have
two granddaughters and
both of them were born
on July 11th.
So
double birthday for the
grandfather and a good
party. But
on the last part, Mr.
Chairman is for
many years, I have been a
very, very close
friend of a former
President of
New Mexico Tech
Dan Lopez.
And to him, it was,
it was his life
and he always talked about
all the different uh
projects, different
research, different
funding and
so got to have a
very good wealth
of information,
you know about the place, but it
is one of our
shining places, you know, in
the State when it comes to
academics and
the outcome that comes out
of the number of students that
do so well.
And I myself
uh uh Mr. Chairman
have had quite a few family
Members that have gone through the
institution and have done very
well. So with that again,
good morning to
everyone.
Good morning, Mr. Chairman, vice
Chairman. It's a pleasure to
be here in beautiful
Socorro. My name is our de la
Cruz. I'm State representative
for one of the
representatives from Burlew County. I
represent the South Valley,
which is the heart of the South
Valley. And so
I love Socorro, by the way,
Mr. Chairman because
we have occasion to pass
through Socorro quite a bit. My
wife is from Caris
Soo. And so we, you know
where the turn off is. I won't tell
you about that, but Socorro
is a great stopping place, a beautiful
town and just happy to be
here. Thank
you.
>> Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Members
of the Committee and the audience
uh Gail Armstrong State
representative for District 49.
Um I actually
represent part
of Socorro. I do Cron
Sierra Socorro and
Valencia. I
live on a ranch in Magdalena.
So I'm really excited to
have it here in New Mexico Tech. I don't
have that long a drive about a 45
minute drive, which
is I know a lot long,
shorter than a lot of you
here except for uh
representative Jaramillo.
So um
thank, I would just want to give a shout
out to Dave Manzano
also who worked really hard
to uh or help organize
and set things up and
all the people here at New Mexico Tech
for having us. Thank you very
much.
>> Good morning, Mr., Chair Members of the
Committee
uh
morning, everybody
from Socorro. My name
is Jack Chatfield. I'm
the State representative from the
northeastern corner of the State, everything
from Rone to portalis.
So Kofax,
Jerry Harding Qua and mcgill
and Union counties.
Uh pretty,
pretty big old long stretch
down the east corner of the
State. Uh I
have to say I woke up this
morning, went down for
breakfast and the entire motel
was full of police
officers from a small
city back in the Midwest. So I
was well protected.
I, I have been,
I have an idea they were
here in Socorro to
learn how to not blow things
up or
possibly to blow things
up. They were probably here for
training and, and
uh so I really
congratulate this
institution on the people
that they, that they train
on how to keep us all safe.
Uh Thank you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Uh good morning, Mr. Chair, vice
Chair, ladies and Gentlemen, Members
of the Committee, my name is Harry
Garcia. I represent
House District 69 which
covers parts of San Juan
mckinley, Cibola, Bernard,
Leo Valencia. So coo counties,
that's the western part of the State,
all of it. Just about
uh a couple of
things. It's an honor of being here
today because this
building was named
after Joie, which was a
Senator out of Grants.
You know, I didn't know it was you until
a little while ago. But that's an
honor. And another thing.
Uh Senator
Gonzalez, congratulations on
your granddaughter, but I got you
beat. I just had a great granddaughter
born today, so
I'm ahead of you a little bit.

granddaughter is supposed to be better. We'll

board and we're gonna
do one mic at a time.
So uh
otherwise I get >> feedback.
Thank you. >> So,
go ahead,
>> Mr. Chairman, Members
of the Committee.
Good morning.
My name is Mahiro Muzar
and I know it's hard to pronounce.
So,
and I'm the
new President of New Mexico
Tech. It is my
pleasure to welcome you to our
beautiful and wonderful
campus.
Although it's been less than three
months since I took the helm.
I've learned much about New
Mexico Tech.
This has further revealed
how much more I need to learn to
support NMT to
maximize Andras and
potential, understand and
scope and its
complexities.
One phrase repeatedly
used during my interviews
and visits here was that
New Mexico Tech is a
hidden gem.
And while I think I understand
why people call NMT
that that's at
best is a backhanded
compliment.
We have no intention of
being hidden or
recognize for our
achievements
and in many ways, we are not,
we May be small campus,
but we certainly punch above
our weight exponentially
above our weight, for
example. And Mt's faculty,
staff and students garner
about $130
million in grants and contracts
every year.
This is a level of research
output that a 20,000 person
campus strives
for and take
enormous pride
in this month.
Translates into research
expenditure,
$75,000
per student in
comparison, a
major research campus like
LSU has about
30,000 students
and does under 400
million per year,
which is only
13,000 per students.
Let me say that again, we
do $75,000
per students, but LSU
does $13,000 per
student that makes us
six times bigger than
LSU.
We can further further measure
ourselves against others. The
University of Texas at
Austin does about
$600 million in grants
and contracts. It
sounds huge. But
that number translate to only
$200,000 per
faculty. While
New Mexico text research
equates to amazing
$800,000
per faculty here.
Again,
$200,000 for
ut Austin
$800,000 for
us.
Another overlooked aspect
of NMT is the number of
students we educate and
train. Yes, like
most TEM institution
academic site offers
hands-on training
and then for the next generation of
engineers and scientists.
We are typical on
that aspect
that said our
graduates median
income is hard and
the most graduates in New
Mexico at about
100 and $25,000
at mid care.
And what truly sets us
apart is our first
responders and other
training programs through
which this little campus
has trained over
700,000
men and women who
work in homeland security,
police and other
agencies. That is
more than the population of
Albuquerque, Santa
Fe and Las Cruces.
Combined.
In fact, few universities
large or small can
conduct top-secret
classified research and
serve the nation through the
training and research program that
involves the Department of Defence,
the Air Force Army,
other branches of the
military services.
They have helped the Intelligence
services numerous times
and conducted work essential
to advancing our national
security.
Tomorrow. You will
hear about our fantastic
research in strategic water
supply, including
the governor's 50 year water
action plan, as well
as resource management,
electromagnetic spectrum
science, carbon
capture energy
technologies. Next
generation A I spatial
biology and
robotics
that and more proof
that NMT
is a remarkable and
influential place.
This is why NMT has been
called by advocates
small but
mighty
including our friends and
this legislative finance
Committee since
joining NMT, I've met
with a few of your Members
and I want to express my
appreciation for your
encouragement and support.
It is refreshing to come to
a State where both side of
the aisle, understand
and value higher education
and support our
mission
in each meeting. I've been
asked what you good
folks can do to help
NMT
as a new person to the
campus and the State, I
needed some time to think about an
appropriate answer.
I thank you for your patience.
I'm still learning. So my
response will certainly
evolve. What I can
say for certain today
is that the system of higher
education is at the
crossroads. And
unless we undertake comprehensive
review about how we operate
and how we are funded,
we May go down the wrong
path. Let
me be as direct as
possible. What
has kept me up at night
since joining NMT
is a challenge of recruiting
and retaining faculty and
staff.
There's a common practice of
saying NMT
is special, but in
reality, lumping us
with other two research campuses
that are also very
special. Part
of my point is that we
are very special in our own
ways. Yet
each of us has a different
mission.
So ultimately, I would like
to ask each of you
to consider us for who we
are a small
campus that offers
more than his share to his
community, to the
State and to the
nation. We
need your help in retaining
and graduating more of our
students. We need
your help in recruiting and
retaining excellent faculty and
staff. I have
grown to love Socorro
but like most modern rural
communities, Socorro has
its challenges for
New Mexico Tech and the
community to thrive.
We need to recruit and
retain faculty and staff
willing to invest in this
community that requires
new thinking
and support services,
compensation and
benefits that we can offer on
employees.
We are not better or worse than
our sister universities in New
Mexico, we are just
different with a different
set of needs.
So the new pre as a new
President of New Extraordinary
Campus, I urge you
to learn more about
us, not
only our successes and
accomplishment, but also
the complexities and challenges
we face in taking this
university to a higher level,
your interest and investment in
the NMT helps us
as we strive to
train and educate the next
generation of the workforce
that will meet the challenges of New
Mexico in this
and the next century.
Mr. Chairman. Thank you and
again, welcome to our beautiful
campus
>> and my
next
and uh our
representative
Jaramillo Harry Garcia
kind of touches our
county a little bit at
Alamo. Uh And
of course, uh
Mr. Representative Armstrong
uh is no longer our representative
in the city of Socorro, but she
was at one time and
well, is always helpful and Magdalena
is now the rest of the counties
she represents that.
And then we have two Senators. We have
Josh Sanchez
who also Tes our county
and we have uh
Crystal Diamond who comes up
from Tier C. So we have
a lot of representation and we're
grateful for all the
things that have been done. And,
and my 34 years as
mayor, uh this is
probably the most significant
year of the
legislature.
Uh You know, I I
used to, I started in cars
also in
1974.
So almost 50 years ago
as a doctor uh in
Medway care, I don't know if your
wife would remember that,
but that's where I started.
And as care is also, is a great town.
This is an uptick
for me to come to Socorro
in 1976.
Uh And then the first
responders, uh my last
name is not Patel, but we own
two of the motels
and, and that's where all the first
responders stay. So
the 700,000 people
that the New Mexico tech
brought to
our city
in the last 25 years
have kept our economy
going and, and kept us
strong. Uh, but
just to let you know what the
legislature has done for us
this year and a
lot of it has to do with our
representatives and Senators.
Uh First of all, public
health and safety,
uh our little hospital
that's run by Presbyterian,
uh now has been stabilized
by the Medic Medicaid
stabilization money
that the legislature has
given us. And I think they're
going to get well over a million
dollars and we'll hopefully
continue to get that
so that our hospital
continues to function.
The new hospital was built
in 1984.
And I think is that Santa Rosa
is going to be getting a new hospital.
So we're hoping perhaps
Presbyterian will get a new one
also, but that
hospitals about 24
beds has
emergency room 24
7 and
has hospitalists
and what small town of
10,000 and the county of
another 8000 has
that kind of a system. Uh
Presbyterian also has a
clinic, I'm an independent
physician, but, and I was
brought here by Presbyterian back
in 1976
but Presbyterian has their own
clinic that they built on their own
money. Uh And they
continue to service our
community with medical
care. So that's
very, very important. What you did.
As far as the hospital
stabilization, you
also, we
were allowed to buy a new
ambulance and an
ambulance for a
small city
is
$480,000.
Used to be
200,000.
It now is four
and they're two years
out. So we had to
get our po in
about three months ago when we
did get the money, which we,
we, we got that and it's been
very, very important for us because
we do about 40
transfers a
month from
Socorro to Albuquerque. We also
have the helicopter service but
we and the helicopter
service. I don't know if you
knew this is about 38
to $40,000
for one flight.
Our emts are responsible
for transferring the people
that are not super critical. We do
not have a paramedic
service. So tho
those two things that, that,
that was really, really important
for our public health, for
a university to have a hospital
and doctors and for recruitment, I
think it's really important.
So that, that's one of the things that the
legislature did for us.
The other thing that you did was you
stabilized our police
with the recruitment. Uh
We got a big grant
to and now we're, we're staffed
up, we're about seven
down. We're, we're a police
department of about 25.
We were about seven down
and we've been able to
recruit
and we've been able to retain,
we've been able to increase the
salaries because of
that grant. The
other thing that you're going to do, I think is
the fire department, the fire departments
are gonna be able to get some of that money
also. And I'm hoping
it's being used the same
way that the police
department is being used that
you get a recruitment.
But also retention, retention
is really important. We get scavenged
from Valencia County,
from Bernia County,
all the small towns, I'm
sure you know, the State
police, I mean, they're
at 45
$44 an hour, I think. And
we're, we're at about 25
$27 an hour.
So those, those things for
public health and safety that the
legislature did, uh,
really, I think is going to
go a long way in helping
us continue to have
a, a sustainable small
community with a university that,
that is a part
above anyone
else. The other thing you
saw when you, when you came
in was all the highways that are being
paved. The new Mexico
Department of Transportation has just
been great. We've, we've
gotten our north
reach up
to, uh San Caia
done. We're getting our
south part of our interstate
being uh paved.
Uh, we got a bunch
of money to do the road that you came
in on the Bullock Street. I, I
hope you enjoyed the nice
smooth pavement.
If you go there at night, we've
got lights, uh, that
was a $5
million project
four years ago.
That would have been a $2.5
million project.
That's the other thing that's hitting the
legislature and I'm sure you're getting
also money because of the inflation.
But the amount
of money that is costing to do
a project
is almost up 40 to
50%. And the
contractors are not available.
They won't even bid on a
contract when
they know it's small and
you can only do 50% of it
with the money that you got.
So when you, when you look at
that NNM
dot uh uh
budget, it's, it's really
been helpful for our small
cities. We've done a
lot of work with
our, with our streets with
some of that money. So that, that's been
really important. Uh
I wanted to add some other things
that we've gotten. Uh,
uh, Senator
Munoz is always
with the rodeo, but now we're
going to enclose that rodeo,
Senator. So the next
thing that Gallup and grants that
you gave money to,
they're gonna have to get an enclosed
rodeo because we're gonna
enclose that rodeo,
uh that, that we've gotten
starting with Representative
Tripp and Howie Morales.
Uh Now with the,
uh Tara Jam
and uh Representative
Armstrong, we've gotten more money
for that and this is on
the quality of life grant. It's
not directly from the legislature,
but your quality of
life grants have been great.
Uh, we've gotten money for that. We've
gotten money for the Convention
Center that we remodeled
the armory with. So
those monies have been great for our
tourism if you stop
off at mcdonald's
because you're coming to the rodeo,
that helps our economy if
you stay at the motels, if you come
and eat somewhere, that, that
really helps our economy also.
So there's the tourism
money. It has been fantastic.
Uh We've also got
a big cleanup right
now, which nmed
is hitting. It's a $20
million federal cleanup of
uh of
groundwater. That
as you come into town, it's
an old battery
factory that contaminated
our groundwater. And
so NMED is helping us
clean that up.
And the last thing is
that we're going to mov'e, I don't know if you've
seen the monument at El
Camino Real Heritage
Center that now is closed.
Uh City of Seor is going to
mov'e that monument
that's right outside the rest stop.
So if you're going south, you can see the
monument, we're going to mov'e
that monument to our highway
60 Convention Center
and we got money for that
uh to do that. So
that I tried to put it on
the interstate, but they said it was
too much of an attraction. It would
distract a motorist
and I don't know how that can happen,
but that's, that's
what they said. So we're going
to put it on highway 60 next
to our Convention center I've
got lots and lots of other things
that we want to thank you for.
Uh, we are going to ask
next year. Uh,
so for
more money, uh, to
do, finish up our,
our, uh, community center,
which we've gotten about
$3 million for it to
do. Uh, we're gonna probably
ask for that. The other thing we're gonna
do is to get a police station,
we traded
two
school buildings, a
junior high and an elementary
school, uh, so
that we could get a police
station built so that
we're going to try to put that into it. We,
we don't like to have old buildings just
standing around. So we're going
to use this, uh
uh one of the
zimmerly school
as a police station. So we're
going to be coming and asking for money for
that. Uh And,
uh, that's about it. Thank
you very much for having us.
Uh Hope you get a chance
to go to the rodeo.
Senator.
We all, we always love
Senator Munoz to come down
here so that he can see our
rodeo also because Gallup is
fantastic. Thank
you
gonna go. Who's
next
>> Mr.
Mr.? Chair, Members of the Committee
and the audience? My name is
Andy Lorick and I'm the brand
new county commissioner
for Socorro County.
It's a manager.
Sorry. Um
It's one of those things that it's
good to be back home
back in 89 when I
graduated, I had the
opportunity to go
play football and basketball up
at Colorado College
and then I got my
teaching degree came back
and some of you will
remember a
much smaller Andy back
in the day, coming to speak
to you all about
educational issues
and assisting
Christine Trujillo with the
Federation of teachers as we
came down. And one of the
things that you see before you
today is a unified
front of all of Socorro
County. You
have the city of Socorro,
you have the county, you
have New Mexico Tech as well
as you have the school
board, but
it goes farther. We
have Magdalena and
Alamo. And
one of the things that we're doing
is director
Sally, uh your predecessor,
David Abbey. One of
the things that we always used to
talk about and that he would
always hound us is
going to be no longer working
in silos. How
do we bring all
of what's happening,
working together
to benefit, not only
the Children, but all of the
Members of our communities
and our counties. And
I think what we have
the unique opportunity here in
Securo to do is
to now have that unified
front. And
you see before you
not just an opportunity to
speak, but to
definitely demonstrate
that we're attending each other's
meetings, we're meeting with
each other there in
our offices. We're extending
that partnership along the
way so that when
you are now talking
about projects in
Socorro, it's not just the city
of Socorro, it's just not the County
of Socorro. It's not just
Socorro Consolidated School
district, it's not just New Mexico
Tech, it's all of
us. And
what I've been able to learn and
gather throughout the years of
attending all of these meetings
is how vitally
important it is with
the limited resources that
we have that
when we come and we do ask
for resources, we do ask
for help. You
can now picture
how it's going to be
taking place here
in Socorro County
itself. So the
ambulance services,
the fire services,
once we have to get up to
Hop Canyon road and start
working on some of the flood damage,
those different
aspects impact all
of us. And so it's vitally
important that we say,
thank you that
this is truly an honor to have
this Committee here before us.
And we look forward to that
partnership, not only
amongst ourselves, but
between you
all and us as well.
So, thank you, welcome
to Socorro. And if
there's anything we can do
to help you with your time here,
please let us
know.
>> Good morning. Thank you for that.
Um Good morning. My name
is uh Dave Hicks. I am the
President of Socorro Consolidated
School Board. I would like
to welcome you Mr. Chairman
and um uh representative
Senators. Uh Thank you
very much for uh for
joining us this morning and allowing
us to talk. Um
uh I guess
what I would like to welcome you to
for the most part of Socorro is welcome
to our family because that's really
what we are here. We're a family.
Um And, and I will reiterate
your point. Uh We work
very closely together. Um
We all talk to each other. We
all support each other.
Um and, and, and
my position as
President of the school board,
I've never been told
no by New Mexico
Tech or the city
of Socorro or the county.
And, and anytime we
have needed something, they have all
jumped in, they have all helped.
Um Representative
Armstrong has been a huge
help. Representative aamil
actually sits on the board with me
and has been a huge help.
Uh So this is our family
and we would like to welcome you guys
to it. Um And,
and, and, and please enjoy your
stay in Seor uh
one of the big thank you I have
from for all of you guys.
Um As you know, we've had the big battle
with our four day school
um week
going on. Um
You have no idea how
grateful that we as
school districts throughout the State
of New Mexico are for
all of your help. Um
You have no idea how that has
impacted Socorro.
Um I, I would like to kind of fill
you in a little bit on how that has
impacted us. Um
I, I it's not just a
four day that we're
looking at here in Socorro, it's
not just about our,
uh it's not even, it's, it's not
even about hours versus days.
We, we are, we do plenty of
hours. You guys already know the
argument with this. What I
want to understand what I want
to explain is our
relationship with New
Mexico Tech. Even on
Fridays, our
Fridays are not days off
in Socorro, our Fridays
in Socorro, we're feeding kids,
we run buses. Um
Anybody needs anything, we get
it to them. But the big
thing we're doing is we're,
we're working on our CTE
programs. So one
of the unique things that Socorro
is doing, um and that
is with the help of everybody here
is on Fridays. We, you can go up
to our school and we've got kids in our welding
classes. We've got kids in our auto
classes. We have gone
and met with companies
like a COSA. We've
met with, um, next
generation VL A which
is a new, uh, a
new organization. Well, it's VL A but
they're adding on a bunch of jobs.
We have sat down with our
OSA, for example. Um,
and said, what is your curriculum? What are
you looking for in a student? Our
Friday curriculum
is for Arcos A,
we have job
placed 11
students into that
company in a year,
which means we've run them through
their curriculum, they pass
their tests, Arcos A
hires them when we say they're
ready, 11
students. We have three females
there. One of our females just
got promoted to
a trainer.
So we're not messing around
on Fridays. This is a big
deal. And, and if we
lose our four day
that takes away that
relationship we have with these
companies and, and
we're currently working with four
different companies to where we
have a clear understanding and we have
an agreed upon curriculum
to where we are training our,
our CTE students to
go to work for them.
Um, our new goal for this
next year is, it's really
hard and we need, this is something
maybe we can get your help with. It's
really hard to bring in a plumber, for
example, plumbers make good
money. It's really hard to bring in an
electrician, for example
and tell them, hey, come be a teacher.
Well, you know, if you're making over 100
grand, it's hard to come in and
teach. So what
we're doing with an innovative grant
that we received is, is we're taking
these students, we're going to have
them apply for jobs,
they're going to come in, apply for these
positions. Um They
have to go through the hiring process
and we're going to place them in
our local community and
try to help some of our local businesses
grow with free labor.
We will be pay, we will be paying these
kids at $15 an hour through
our innovative grant. We're going to be
placing them with an electrician.
We're going to be placing them with a plumber
and our local plumbers, for example,
will have free labor and they have
on the job training,
electricians will have free
labor on the job training.
We're hoping that what this will do
is is one of two,
is a couple of things.
Number one, and we will get um
on the job training for
our students. And
number two, if these small
businesses in our little community
can grow and hire these
when they're done. Now, we have a
growing economy. Now,
we don't have to wait six or
seven days for a plumber to show
up or, or an
electrician. You know, and if we
can get two or three, you know,
that go to work
every year, we can grow some
businesses and we can start growing
and do some really neat things here.
Um So tho
those are some of the things we're doing with
CTE and, and, and those are some
of the things that we really,
really are, are stressing
on our Friday programs.
So we really appreciate
your guys' help, um,
keeping us rolling from our
Friday program and, and supporting
us like you have, uh, supported
us. So, uh, moving
forward, we would really appreciate
that.
Um,
that's some of the main stuff we're doing.
Um, other than
that, um, you guys have
helped us on, um, uh,
last year, we came in and
we asked for help on a baseball
field and we asked for help on
a, um, a kitchen
for a, for our,
um, Cottonwood
charter school here. Uh We did
get help with that kitchen. So, thank you very
much. We're building a new kitchen in our
charter school right now. Uh
That's a big deal. What they
didn't have warmers, they didn't
have refrigerators. So
we were hauling stuff over from our
kitchens to theirs and,
and it was not a good lunch. So thank
you for that help. Uh, we still need
a baseball field. We've got,
uh, probably one of the most
dangerous baseball fields in the
State right now. Uh We're in the
process of building a new middle
school right now. Um
And so we're, we're a little
tight on funds if there's any
way we could get help with that, that would
be much appreciated.
So, um but
once again, thank you all for
being here. Please keep in
mind um our, our
and please continue to support
us on the four day. Um
And please understand that our fifth day
is extremely important. It's
jumped our graduation rate
up uh in the last
five years, we
were at 64%.
Um We have started focusing
on the uh CTE
programs. We're getting them
graduated, our graduation
rate this last year jumped up to
86%.
So, um it's
making a difference. It's making a
huge impact. Um
Along with New Mexico Tech,
our top 5%. I got
brag a little bit. Uh
They compete with
anyone in the State.
Um Our Science Olympiad
team was number one in the
State. Our junior high team was
number two in the State and that's
going against the Los
Alamos, the La Cueva, that's
all of those. So we're very
proud to have support, we're
very proud to have that help.
Um And, and we've got great
kids here. Um We are
the part of the economic development
as we, as we all look at
that. Um We
take great pride in trying to
make our schools better. We
want to be that school system
that when you're trying to bring
in faculty and staff and get them
to stay that they look at our schools
and say we want to
be in those school systems
and that is our goal. That is our,
that, that will help us
grow our local economy
that will help us get people to stay here
right now. We have a lot of faculty staff,
they come in, they drive back to
Los Luna or they drive back to
Albuquerque. We're going to change our
schools with your help and we're
going to make it to where they want to be here.
They want to stay here and they want to be
a part of our little community.
So thank you all for
your help in that goal and I
appreciate you all being here today. Thank
you very much.
Questions from Committee
Members.
Representative Small.
>> Thank you very much Mr. Chair. Thank
you all very much for
uh the presentations.
Uh Mr. Chair first
uh Mr. President, I know it's
early. Um
But you really
seem to highlight that
recruitment and retention
of faculty and staff.
Well, you said this, that that is
the core thing that
keeps you up at night,
Mr. Chair Mr.
President. Any
further sort of
points to that? Obviously,
that's something that we want to engage
on and focus on.
Would you uh I
guess maybe I could ask
what are the top
two or three challenges
in recruiting uh
faculty and staff
as you look into the
future?
>> Thank you, representative.
I think
uh is
a complex
issue.
Part of it is
the salary part
of the spousal hire.
Part of it is just
mentioned, when you hire
a young family with young
Children, I think
it's more perception and reality.
They feel the schools are not
quality schools.
I think they are
just part of it is the communication
and marketing to make sure they
understand that we have
amazing high schools here.
So part of it is on us to make
sure we market this better
part of it is also be
competing with UN M and
others in terms of
recruitment and our
salaries don't match theirs. Of
course, uh you
know, Socor is a wonderful
city but small
and bringing people from other
states, others, it May be a
bit added complexity.
So my worry is that
for us to continue to
do what we do best
training students train the
first responders. Uh we
need faculty who are
willing to invest in this
community. I said
part of it on us as far
as on me, really, I have to take
responsibility to make sure I do a
better job of marketing
and communicating when we recruiting.
But part of it is the resources
that we just have to have the resources
to make sure when we
hire two phd s
spouse will hire that we
have a job for the spouse
here that they can
have something in the city that they have
some sort of a job
as,
as the technology improves
as our internet improves. I think
that becomes better. Housing
is a major problem here. It's
expensive and sort
of, it's hard to find.
Those are complex, big
problems. I'm not saying any
individuals can solve it.
But yeah, I
mean, you
know, it has been keeping
me at night because I
worry but in,
in a but we can
retain the good faculty we already
have and we're losing, we're losing to
Las Los Alamos and Sandia,
right and left. And
uh that's a big loss,
the brain drain, not
for New Mexico because obviously they're staying
in New Mexico, but definitely for our
community. >> Understood.
Uh Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much Mr. Chair and a
lot to dig in and to
continue to follow up there.
If uh Mr. Mayor,
if there is anything, please,
I >> can follow up on that. The
other problem that I
see is middle-income
housing, our
housing
in this city is
almost zero.
And we've
done studies of people coming
back and forth from Las
Luna that
work at tech because there's a side
road and we actually put a counter
on there. Uh, there's
almost 200 cars that come
back and forth, uh,
come forth one
time and then go back to about
200 cars
that they live in Los Luas
now for different reasons. Perhaps
it's the wife or perhaps
it's better shopping or whatever.
But our also problem is is
that we don't have
a vehicle to
be able to get
middle-income housing. Now, we're working
with a contractor and we're working
with a realtor
to try to build
some spec houses.
But I think one of
the problems is that when a
professor comes in
and they're making good money
or people that are working here and they're
all making fairly good money,
even the salary ranges are low.
We don't have the housing
to provide them.
So in order for us to entice
somebody to start building
a project like they're doing up
north in Los Luna, which
is sprawling now,
that's, that's one of our bigger
problems is trying to get
that, get
the, get that kind of a thing. We
have one of everything, we have hospital,
we have doctors, we have
good quality of life, we have
mountains. The, the
the housing is a, is
a problem and I think the Governor
has a housing
czar, I guess, or that, that
maybe there will be some
money available, not for low
income. We we're actually building
a large low-income
housing apartment, but we don't
have that middle-income housing.
>> Got it. Thank you very
much Mr. Mayor for adding into
that Mr. Chair.
Um I guess this
is for follow up uh
but Mr. school board
President uh really
exciting about the
uh CTE
partnerships.
Um
However, sort
of when I think about back home
in Las Cruces and
uh Mr.
President, the,
you know, uh
our schools I think
are a core
recruitment opportunity and
challenge. And we see that in Las
Cruces as well.
Um
The, but my
understanding is that
back home, there
are CTE
programs integrated
into a school
day, uh whether
that's one of five days,
whether that's one of four
days, but I don't
quite understand
uh because again, coming
from Las Cruces,
I think that CTE
programs
partnerships
and uh all
of those are implemented into a
school day. And I
guess the other question that I would
have and I know
there are a lot of, there's nuanced
complexity and
particularly rural
challenge in,
in, you know, as you mov'e
away maybe from Socorro
proper. But
there's a, it seems
like a, a lot of
students
frankly prior to
CTE, I guess
at the, at the elementary
level, Mr. Chair,
Mr. President, the,
the
folks go to get their
meals. But if
you're in elementary
school
for that, for that
Friday, what does that look
like for your typical elementary
kiddo and for the
kiddos who are, you
know, their parents or maybe
ideally working here at tech,
something like >> that.
>> Uh Yes, sir. I small
thank you for your question. Uh It's a very
good point. We do have elementary
programs. We have after school,
elementary programs and we have Friday
elementary programs. So
uh we have after school
at our elementary schools,
uh a after school programs
go to 530.
Parents can get off. Uh,
so our programs are
set up to where kids can stay
there at the elementary schools,
they can get their homework done and
we even feed them. So
parents come pick them up at 530
their, their evening is they're ready
to start their evening. >> And
Mr. Chair Mr. President for
that Friday,
uh, they don't
go, do they go
to the school to get their meal
and then come home is
the meal at a general
site. >> They
can if they want to or they can
stay and, and be part of the
programs,
>> stay and be part
of the school. >> We, we,
we have programs at our, at the
elementary level that are going on on
Fridays.
And so, and that's a grant
that we have. And so
the students, if, if they want to
come in on Fridays, there's meals
there and there is activities
going on in, in all the
>> schools.
Lots for me to learn.
Appreciate the quick follow up.
Thank you very much.
Thank >> you, Senator
>> Gonzalez.
Thank you, Mr.
Chairman and
thank you for your presentation
to all of you. Uh,
just a couple of things.
So, no, on the four
days school
for that fifth part,
it's always on a
Friday.
Yes, sir. And
uh,
Mr. Chair
to that. So
it's a volunteer
basis or,
or
um.
Ok. And uh,
the part that I was gonna
ask that intrigued me that
is, you said you provide
transportation.
So is that a transportation
for all students
>> any that need it.
Yes, they
just have to contact it and we set up
and, and, and we get them there, we get them
around. >> Ok.
And uh Mr. Chairman,
how do you work that in the
formula?
So how do you pay for
that? >> We put, we pay
for that out of our uh we have
grant money for some of our Friday
programs and then we
also just work it out of our transportation
budget.
>> That's all Mr. Chairman.
That's interesting because
so,
you know, on your funding
it's uh to and from
and maybe from
LFC, you might be able
to give us a
little more, it's
uh to and from
and if that's not considered
a school day,
you know, how is that coming
into the
formula?
And um you know, I applaud
you if it's working and they're
not questioning
it. But um you
know, because then
other districts could do the
same. But
then that means that if
you're doing
that, that short
shortens the
budget by
1/5 to
the other
transportation
part. So
uh maybe on a 1 to 1, we
can talk a little bit more on that,
but that is very
interesting that, that you're able
to, to work with that.
>> Well, and we've
just got our transportation
budgets cut as well. So that's
going to be a challenge this year.
So,
yes, I'd love to visit with you about that,
>> sir,
Mr. Chair. Um
You know, I support you
know your, your efforts and
how you're working it. But I just wondered
how it was
going into as far
as the, the actual
part of the
funding.
You know, so,
and the other part that I
was gonna ask you is
it was mentioned about
your shortfall
on housing.
And so do the
schools face the same
problem
>> in regards of recruiting teachers?
Yes, sir. We do. >> And,
uh, and do you, uh, do
you offer teacher
each?
Yes. So that is
where a
district can apply for
funding
and you know, you
actually are
given the funds to
build complex.
So leaving quarters
for areas
that are
more on the rural area
to be able to
recruit and
retain
>> Mr. Chairman
Senator Gonzale.
Let me try
to do this one. So
no, there currently aren't any
deres and we're, we're talking
about the housing shortage.
It impacts all of
us. So when we're trying to
retain and recruit
deputy sheriffs, it's
one of those aspects that comes
into it. So
not only are we looking
at the pay for
these different salaries,
all of us are impacted by
this and potentially
one of those dynamics
that we might be able to have future
discussions is not
only the teacher,
but because we're talking
about the shortage of
housing for
New Mexico's tech
professors. We're talking
about shortage of housing for
our doctors, our
nurses and our medical
techs there at the hospital
as well as
teachers coming
from Las
Luas, as well as our sheriffs
to where we just had to redo a
policy to
permit our sheriff's
vehicles to go 75
miles
north of the Socorro County
line to be able to retain and
recruit individuals
there in Belen and Los Lunas
to be able to come down and provide
sheriff duties here.
So I think it's going to be more
of a partnership
amongst all of us
to try to figure out how to do
this housing
situation. And we
might be able to tap into some
of the teacher
ridge money that I
lived in one of the
teachers up there in uh Dulce
up on the hickory Apache
reservation. And so it's going
to be interesting to see
those dynamics come into play
and how we're going to be able to
then not only
focus solely on
one aspect, but like I
said, we're a unified front
to where all of us are being
impacted by recruitment
and retention right now,
specifically based upon
housing.
>> Thank you for your response.
But my point is
that there's an avenue
for funding already for
schools, you
know, and there is a process to
apply, you know, and to be able
to get into that.
So, I mean, that's in place
already. I mean, you don't have
to, you know, you
can just, uh you know,
work with the department
and, and make an
application and see where you would
rank on that. But
for that part there already
is. >> So I was
unaware of that. So, thank you very
much. I will, I will look into
that. >> Ok. Very
well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to
all of you.
So
>> thank you Mr. Chair and thank you to
the presenters and again, thank you for
having us. Um
Earlier, I heard you talking Mr.
Mayor about the
housing shortage that you're
dealing with right now.
You know, it, it latest
figures are that we have over a
40,000 dwelling
unit deficit here
in New Mexico at
all levels. I'll, I'll, I'll
combine there May maybe a little
bit more now. Uh Representative
Dixon, who's the Vice Chair of the House
Appropriations and, and she's here
right now as well. A couple
of years ago, we created something called The
Opportunity Enterprise Act.
We did that together, which is primarily
focused on commercial
uh projects.
But I do want to let you know though,
based on your comments
there, that one of the biggest. So,
and we also served on the
Governor's Housing
Investment Council. Uh
This past year, there
is a housing
coordinator now
whose full-time
job is to work with someone like
you in a community
like Socorro to
help you navigate
and figure out a lot of, you
know, some of the challenges that you're having.
So I want to make mention of that, that
that's definitely someone who's available to
you. Um His
name is Daniel Weor
and he does a really good job. I'll
get you his number after if you want me
to. That's number one, number
two, I wanted to let you know that
we amended the
Legislation that Representative Dixon
and I created to now
include uh workforce
housing, but
primarily the or mainly
the infrastructure.
It seems to be one of the biggest
problems that we find
with um with
housing development. So
getting you the money to help
you with and, and to get that
portion of it done seems
to be one of the big nuts to crack
and, and this would be one way to do
that, but we didn't just make
that fund that act
permissible of that.
We also added about
100 and 25
million, I think somewhere in there
to this fund for that
very purpose. So
those rules I believe
are if they're
not already in place, they're very
quickly going to be in place. I would
get yourself to the front of that line
because there is dollars,
there's AAA methodology
and then there's someone that can
help you to coordinate some of these
challenges you might be facing.
So I I just want to make mention of that.
II I hear you loud and clear.
I know that housing is a gigantic
problem for you. Where
are things with regard to
infrastructure
in the development of housing in
this community?
>> Mr. Chair Senator
Padilla, we're there.
Uh We've gotten
a brand new sewer
system. We've
got plenty of water.
Our utilities are good.
I got a little problem with the score.
Electric coop, but that'll,
hopefully that'll get fixed.
But, uh, and we
met, we, we've gotten in
touch with the Gentleman
Daniel. I can't w
starts with the w I can't think of his last
name, but we have gotten in touch
with him and we actually have a
construction company that's actually doing
some work here at the
tech uh in a big
building project. We're
working with them and a
realtor to try to
get that put
together, they have a subdivision
ready to go.
Uh and they want some
help from us with the streets
because we haven't accepted them.
But uh we are,
we are on the way and
again, there's a, it's
a billion dollar VL A
project that's coming for
the next Gen VL A
over the next 10 years.
And a lot of those,
the, the people that are
coming are
do staying in Los Luna. And
I think Las Luas did take
advantage of the uh the
commercial part of that enterprise
zone where they've gotten
all these warehouses and things.
But we would like
to take advantage of the
residential part
of this project that you're talking
about and we're, we're on the way
at trying to get in touch with
them. >> That's great, Mr.
Chairman and Mr. Mayor. Thank you.
Yeah, I mean, it's directly
for what you just described,
that's what this whole thing was set up
to do. That's
one. and then the
last thing I'll mention is,
um you
know, the
last piece of it to actually
get all the way up to the
development. That's where a lot of this
will come in. So II I
believe you can, it'll help you with
Road, I believe it will help you with
actually right up to the property
line. Uh And then,
and the last thing I guess the
actual last thing Mr. Chair
is because the
State made this investment, it
makes New Mexico
or a project like yours a lot
more attractive to get
matching monies from these
larger projects, federal
projects or whatever. So,
I just want to make sure you're aware that
Daniel can help you understand all
that better. I'm more than happy to talk
you through it. I know Representative Dixon
would as well. So thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um So I just wanted to
clarify um
and, and with uh
President Hicks is
that Secor Schools is on a
four day uh school
week. And so the
fifth day of
instruction is paid
through primarily from
grants. Is that
correct?
>> On their community, um
their community education?
Sorry.
>> Correct. So,
so just to clarify some of the
questions, uh Senator
that that fifth day
is not an educational
uh uh day
as per pe D.
It's in addition
to and so the
Transportation Mr. President
just to clarify that
is not paid through
pe D Transportation
Department that is paid
through um
your grants.
Um
>> Thank you for clarifying that. >> Thank
you. Um And
so when we look
at at education
in Socorro, we are truly
on a four day week.
Um Mr.
President, is that
correct?
So Mr. Chair, what we're looking
at is a four day week with
supplemental education,
Mr. Chair.
>> Yes. Yes, we have a
um we have a New
Mexico Tech works with us on a
community grant um
with their uh
community education, I believe is
what they call it. Uh It's
a um it's,
it's a class on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays.
They come in as well and
they uh they help us with our CTE
program, they help us
with a lot of our
supplies, uh
and our equipment in there. So it's a
partnership with New Mexico Tech
and their community uh education
program. >> Thank
you Mr. Chair and thank you Mr.
President for that
clarification. In
addition to that, um Mr.
President, when we look at
the fifth day,
um the
elementary component was
funded by a grant.
>> It was the same
grant covers the uh the Friday
that covers our after school program
as well. >> And
so for that fifth day,
that is a supplemental
grant, Mr. President,
Mr. Chair, can you describe,
um, what the Children
do on that day?
>> Um, the, the, the
youngsters, um, they,
they do, there's homework
sessions, uh, there's,
there's also programs
that are, that are, um,
uh, tutoring,
um, trying to get them caught
up and make sure that they're, they're
reading and their math is caught
up. Uh, once again they're
fed as part of
that grant. Uh, when you get
up into the high school,
um, the Fridays
is the CTE
activities we have the Welding
program. Um There's
also the uh automotive
program that's in there.
Uh And so those are the two
programs up there as of right
now.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
and thank you Mr. President
for clarifying that. And
um just important to know that
we are strictly on a four
day uh
week and then that is
supplemental grants that
Socorro schools applies for
that that pays
particularly for
transportation and
um and the teachers
and education of that >> program.
Thank you for clarifying that
in front of me. You're correct. Thank you.
Thank you, >> Mr. Chair.
>> Thank you. I don't see any other questions.
Mayor, let me ask you a question.
I mean, as, as we did
this uh recruitment
and retention for police and
fire, right? Are the cities
getting ready to increase their
budgets when that goes
away so they can maintain that
hiring level and that pay
level, >> Mr. Chairman
Senator Munoz, yes, we
will be. I I think it'll be
phasing out over the next
two years when it goes
down to percentage wise
as to how much we're getting supplemented
for. Yes, we are
and we have a robust
Gross receipts.
Uh and we're not even topped out.
We're, we're at 8%.
Uh and, and a little bit less than
that. So one of the low and we have
room for that, we also have
room for, uh I think there's
a spe, well, they took the
special are out
but we still have room to
increase the grocerys for fire
and, and uh
uh police and we
also have some property tax that we
can increase for public
safety. But yes,
we will be, we will be doing
that.
>> Yeah, I mean, 8% is pretty
high. I mean, you get in that range
and, and then, you
know, then you're looking at housing
your developers and everybody
else coming in is gonna
say 8% tax on,
on sales of goods. I'm gonna order
them from
Los Lunas and not from Rack
and Socorro or
they're gonna >> find it. We're less than,
we're less than Berlin and Las
Luas.
>> Uh, you have the four day
school week in the bus
situation. I mean, pe
D has got to follow the statutes when
they do do the payout
on the, on the bus and the time and
that, that's an issue that PD has
tool. They can't just change
what statute clearly states
they have to do and for
bussing and, and then
not do it. And that's why
you're going to see shortfalls
and because they
hadn't followed the statute and
now they were following the
statute and it's changing.
So, Mr.
President, I don't know how we're gonna get
you the right people and
right teachers and the right pay.
Right.
That's the problem
in a small community.
Right.
Yes, sir.
And, and so as we mov'e
forward, I don't think,
uh,
uh, what's
our
education?
Les C, I
don't think they look much at higher ed
pay. So we'll
probably need to dig in that a little
bit. Right. Especially in small
rural areas, see what the
pay is like.
But you're saying whenever you recruit
a professor, then you
need a, a job for the wife
too. Right?
>> Sometimes the spousal
hire is essential
as well. It's not all the time,
but sometimes my
greater point was not
just you guys helping us
recruit faculty and staff
invest on us.
My greater point is that
I'm new and three months
is not a long time. So I don't pretend
that I know a lot about what's happening
in State or New Mexico
Tech. My point
was that just
even in a short time, I've been
here, it 10, there's a
tendency to lump the three research
campuses together and
all three of you are very different.
My point was this, I'd
like to be able as I'm
learning to also educate
our legislators that we
are different and we have different
needs than UN M or
the State. They're amazing
campuses and I applaud
them, but we're just
different and part
of that difference is also
recruitment.
Ok, Mr. >> Chair
Senator Woods, do you want
to write the first check for pay
increases?
>> I've got one question.
I want to
more of a statement.
I want to warn you
guys
about trying to run
your own electric
utility for your
talent and why
I want to warn that
the electrical utility
business is
getting bigger,
the, the, the economies
of scale. Some
say that P and M is
not even big enough
to play in the game.
So when you start
talking about making an
electric grid in
your, in your
hometown,
and I'm sure it's very
tempting for a revenue
stream for
your town.
But I just want
to make sure that you're
doing your
research very closely
at that.
And I know it's, it's a
political deal
going on and I understand
that,
but
it's a very scary
thing to think about
the expertise you're
trying to get
in your town for
running other things
in your town and then
trying to bring expertise
in to keep an electric grid
up within the town
also. So
if you want to call, that's
fine. But it's just my
warning to you.
Thank you, Mr. Chair,
>> Mr., Chair Senator
with the, the
uh uh I've been working on this for
20 years. We've
talked to Aztec, we've talked to
Raton Bloomfield
is looking into going
into away from Farmington.
Uh We talked to
Trc
tri-state Electric
that has a stranglehold
on what they're charging
per kilowatt
for all the 12
co-ops in this State
is criminal.
They're buying there and gallop
is lucky because they made a
contract with tri-state for
3.5 cents a kilowatt.
When they're charging
our coop
8.5 cents a kilowatt,
we're paying 17 cents
a kilowatt
when
Facebook
and Amazon is gonna get
five cent electricity
because of the solar power
and what they got promised from
PNM and the
Governor. Why
can't this town or
other towns in this
State get lower
electricity rates. If
you look at your bottom
line on your electric
bill and divide it
out with the kilowatts, you're
gonna come up to 15 to
16 cents a kilowatt.
That's how much you're paying for
residential.
We don't have
economic development
rates. This coop
does not give us that
where we can offer
economic development rates to
people in our industrial
park. We've
researched it.
We've got very good people
that are helping us do
the transition.
They've lost their franchise,
they're going month to month
and we already
there, there's lots of money out
there. I don't know what's gonna happen in
January, but there's lots
of money out there right now for solar.
And as you were coming south
from Las
Luas, you'll see this huge
203
$100 million solar
project. All the
lines go to Facebook.
Uh So
tri-state has not gotten
involved with solar. They want,
they have capped us at
5%. They
keep touting that it's gonna be in
2026 they're gonna go to
25 and 50%.
They're not gonna come through with that.
But the biggest problem
is tri-state
their biggest
customer in Denver.
Uh United Power, a
billion dollar customer left
them. Uh Delta
Montrose coop
have left them. And
our model, our
guru uh
is uh is
uh uh uh kit
Carson.
And then we have to, we have to
kind of defer to them on a lot
of stuff and they've done a good job and they
stayed a co op and they
paid off the penalty of
$35 million
with Guzman helping them.
So we've got a lot of good
people helping us and I appreciate
your comments about being
careful as to how we do
this. But at this
point, we're at a point
where this is a generational
change. We're already
the natural gas utility in
town. Uh We know
how to run utilities, we know how to
build. Uh There's
always consultants that
we can get to help us.
But, but I understand
Aztec told me the same thing. Uh
They said that be
careful, the utility
business and electricity is not
easy. But at this point,
we're, we're up
that CRE you know,
where we're not able to
mov'e ahead with any economic
development like Los Luna is
doing right now. And so
that's where we're at and we can't
talk to tri-state out of
Colorado because
now instead of the
pr C regulating them, they
went to Ferc
in Washington DC
and that's that we
have no control over their
costs and they make 45
to 50 year
contracts
and that's our biggest problem.
So that, that's my response and
I, I appreciate your caution.
Uh, and, and, but we,
we are moving ahead with it
and I made that
public. That's all I
can
say.
>> Representative Armstrong.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Um, as
Senator Wood said, it's a political
issue because uh
you know, I don't want to lose
electricity where I live. If
the city buys,
tries to buy uh
the electric companies
because that would be just for the city
that does the whole
Socorro County. So
it is a political issue
that being said P
and M just put in for a
rate hike.
And I have
to tell you that PNM, we,
we applied in
Valencia County for to
put in solar.
Uh they have no
capacity in the grid
left. So if I
want to put solar on a company
that we own in Valencia
County, we
have to pay for it and we're, we're
just solar. We don't get any, we
don't, we can't get any, they have no
capacity because of the
big solar plant that they put in
right there in Valencia County.
So there's pros and cons
to everything. And
I would just say, let's let's
keep working together, let's
try to solve this issue
for all of our constituents
in Socorro County.
And um the
other big one is the
Middle Rio Grande economic
development
cannot get for
the second time,
failed to
get certified.
Um And, and it's sort of
a debacle and, and
that would really help our
community. If we could
get certified, we could apply for
grants, we could do some other things
here and help, help
the city of Socorro and Socorro
County. So I've
been in touch with them several
times. Have not
been very happy with their
answers. Uh
Kirsten Keller here
in, in Socorro works
her tail off for
Socorro County and
several Members of that board.
So I just wanted to bring
that to light that, that
could really help our
county if we could get certified
and, and to help grow
um our community here.
So thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
>> Um just to kind of wrap this up.
I mean, Gallup runs his own utility.
They pay three cents, right? P
and M tried selling them the
power. We kind of pushed
back and said, no, we don't want
P and M's power.
They're at a great rate, but they also
sell their power 17 cents
a kilowatt to the consumer,
right? So their margins
are good. And then just so,
you know, when I live outside the city
limits, I pay
double.
So I pay 36 cents
a kilowatt hour. And
so the margins
are there if you want to run your own utility
and you can make money. That's
up to you if you're already running a billing
system for your gas, water and
sewer, just an additional
one and it'll probably
lower your operating costs for the
colledge. Right. You could
have some, some margins
that lower your operating cost. It's just
what you contract that rate of that
power at. But
my cautious word to you
is
finding cheap power is going to be
hard,
>> Mr. Chair and I, I
would never fight my
representative. So,
you know, it is,
it's, it, the people
say that it's political. I'm the mayor of the
city. I'm not a
Senator or representative or a
commissioner. Uh, but
as you know,
the, the
cost of electricity sometimes
drives
economic development
and, and 36 is a
lot. That's, that's, that's
more than they're paying over here when they
charge your electric
car.
You know, so that's a
lot. But
we're trying to find a way
to compromise with tri-state
a, a company that's from out
of town, out of State.
And I think the, the
legislature
and the Governor needs to
work on
trying to do what they did for
Facebook, for
my hotels or for my other
businesses to try to
decrease the cost of
electricity and, and
that will help our employment that
will help our wages
and, and that money will not be
going out of State. So
I'm open to compromise.
I just, I just think that
we need to get tri-state at
the table to talk about this
and, and P and M also
and the rates are going up
just not for P and M, they're going
up for tri-state
also because uh
just the cost of everything
is going up. Natural
gas produces about 40%
of all our electricity.
We have a lot of natural
gas.
People are against natural gas and
that's not right. So
there's a lot of things that can be changed.
And I think we need
to, we need to work together on trying
to get again,
utilities,
wages, employee
pool. Those are the things
that bring people to
New Mexico and we
need to try to get that
more attractive compared to
the rest of the country,
especially Arizona and
Texas.
>> Ok. Thank you. I appreciate
your time here. Appreciate you
guys having us,
Mr. President. I imagine you'll be around
for the next couple of days and
so we'll see you
and then we'll mov'e on to our next
presenters.
Uh
Ryan and
Ryan, you gonna start us
off
I
>> the Crime
Report.
>> All right, good afternoon or
good morning rather.
Uh We have Mr. Tollman
program, Evaluator
and Mr. Lueras. Uh
who's our
program? Evaluator?
Uh,
who's gonna kick us
off? Ok, please
go ahead
and this is for the
Vernale County Criminal Justice
System update, >> correct?
>> Thank you.
>> Well, good morning Chair and Members
of the Committee. And thank you for
having us here today.
Uh This morning, I'm here with my
colleague Marco Lores,
a new program evaluator
here at the LFC.
Uh to share with you our policy
spotlight which provides an
update on crime in New
Mexico and Bernalillo
County. Uh The
report should be in your folder
under tab B
and look like
this.
Uh Before I begin, I just want
to first thank all of the LFC,
staff and
criminal justice involved
agencies and their staff
who helped us and assisted
us with this report.
So if you will please turn with me
to page
four,
I will discuss our first
chapter. New
Mexico can reduce crime by
addressing root causes
and the swiftness and certainty
of justice.
New Mexico's crime rates
remain above the national
average driven by
high crime rates in Bernalillo
County.
However, we know it is
effective and where we can
direct our efforts at reducing
crime such as treating
its root causes,
increasing certainty that
offenders are caught and held
accountable and
reducing recidivism.
As you can see in chart one
on the right. The legislature
has appro appropriated over
$800 million over
the past three years towards
prioritizing treatment,
swiftness and certainty of
justice and victim
and community needs
in regard to addressing
addressing root causes of
crime. Research
shows substance use treatment
is the most effective way to break
the cycle of crime and
incarceration
for offenders with drug
abuse and addiction
issues.
Therefore, New Mexico
could target crime reduction
by diverting low-level offenders
into programs treating
addiction or addressing other
root causes of crime
through pretrial services or
treatment courts.
Over on page
five,
research shows that certainty
and swiftness of being caught is a
more powerful deterrent
than the severity of criminal
penalties.
Our analysis finds that there is an
accountability gap in Bernalillo
County criminal justice
system where arrest
criminal convictions and
prison admissions do not keep
pace with crime.
Meaning that the system is not
effectively holding offenders
accountable.
New Mexico can reduce this
accountability gap by investing
in law enforcement's ability
to solve cases and to
improve prosecution
efforts by
addressing issues such as evidence
collection and witness
cooperation
on the bottom of page
five. Another
thing that New Mexico could do to
address crime is to ensure
that inmates are prepared to
successfully re-enter the
community and avoid
reoffending.
We can do this by increasing
participation
uh by incarcerated
individuals and behavioral
health educational or
vocational programs and
ensuring that they have medication
assisted treatment.
I will next discuss recent trends
in crime in the criminal justice
system in Bernalillo County before
returning uh to address some of
our key recommendations.
So if you will please turn with me to page
eight,
I would like to discuss our next
chapter. So
how has crime in Albuquerque
been recently. Well, for
the most part, crime in
Albuquerque has remained flat
or increased while or
increased while crime rates have
decreased nationally.
So you May recall that the
FBI recently reported
that crime rates had gone down
nationally about
15%.
Uh comparing the first quarter
of 2024 to the
first quarter of
2023. But what
about Albuquerque?
So if you look over on chart three
there on the right of the page, you'll
see that for Albuquerque,
violent crime and homicide
were made flat
while property crime and vehicle
theft increased during that
time.
If you look at chart four on the
bottom of the page,
you'll see over time that violent
crime in Albuquerque reached a
high around 2017
and then plateaued
violent crime in Albuquerque remains
much higher than the rest of the
State, which also remains
higher than the national
rates. Violent
crime in Albuquerque is about two
times the rest of the State
and over three times that at
the national
rates
over on page nine,
if you look at chart five,
while Albuquerque tends to
drive crime rates in New Mexico,
many communities across
New Mexico also experienced
increases in violent
crime in at least
20 communities across the
State. Violent crimes
rates went
up.
One point of concern is cases
involving juveniles with firearms
reported by the second district
in Bernalillo County.
So if you will turn with me to page
10
you will see in church
six
that there has been a recent increase
in cases involving
juveniles and the percentage
of those cases where a firearm
is present.
Nonetheless, as chart seven
in the middle of the page
indicates the
Majority of felony cases
in Bernalillo County are committed by
older men aged 24
and above.
While trends in violent crime
predating the pandemic,
the pandemic seems to have
exacerbated the
situation
particularly with gun violence
and homicides.
Figure one over on
page 11 on the right
shows an analysis of
fatal shootings in Albuquerque
from 2020
to 2023
indicating that gun violence
rose most sharply in neighborhoods
where gun violence already existed
before the pandemic.
Crime is still concentrated
in a few areas of hotspots
in Albuquerque. LFC
staff have previously reported
on evidence-based policing
practices and recommended
that law enforcement agencies
could conduct joint patrols
in these hotspots
utilizing crime analytics
from A P D's real-time Crime
Center.
Next, if you will turn your attention
to chart eight at the bottom of the
page, I
would like to discuss trends in property
crime after
peaking in 2017,
property crime rates in
Bernalillo County steadily decreased
through 2021. It
rose again in 22
since 2021 drug
offenses in Albuquerque have more
than doubled which coincides
with the increase in property
crime.
If you will, please turn over to page
12,
you can see in chart nine
over on the right.
The various property crimes
have increased in the first quarter
of 2024 compared
to the same time period in
2023.
One concerning trend is the recent
increase in motor vehicle
thefts. As you can
see in chart 10 in the middle of the
page, motor vehicle
thefts have increased in Albuquerque
over the two most recent years of
data which exceeded
comparable
cities
over on page 13.
I want to highlight some of the root
causes that could be driving these
crime trends in Albuquerque
social conditions in Bernal
counties such as an increase
in substance use, a high
rate of adverse childhood
experiences,
poor education
outcomes and high
rates of poverty can
contribute to high rates of
crime. As
you can see in chart 11,
drug overdose death rates in
New Mexico exceed the US
average
LSC staff have previously
reported that investing in these
upstream efforts can help
improve root causes and
in turn help lower
crime.
If you will, please turn with me to page
14,
I will discuss accountability
in the justice system in our next
chapter in which
we find that reported crimes
far exceed arrests and
convictions.
Like I mentioned before,
research shows that certainty
of being caught is a more powerful
deterrence to crime than severity
of punishment.
This means it is more important to
prioritize solving crimes
and securing convictions
particularly for serious
offenses.
When LFC staff first
reported on crime in the criminal
justice system in
2018,
we found that as crime rose in the
mid 20 tens, arrests and
convictions remained
flat or
declined, creating
an accountability gap for criminal
behavior. So if you will
look at chart 13 in the middle
of the page, we find
that that accountability gap persists
today.
Although felony R have
increased in recent years,
they have not reached prepa andem
levels.
Felony convictions were the fewest
in 2023. Despite
increases in number of felony
arrests during that time,
prison admissions have also not
tracked with crime with
70% fewer admissions in
Fy 22 than in Fy
19.
Declining case clearance
rates indicates Albuquerque law
enforcement agencies are not
effectively deterring or
solving crime
over. If you look over on page
15, you can
see in both charts 14 and
15 that the case
clearance rates continues to
decline
in chart 14,
less than one in five violent
crimes in Albuquerque result in
an arrest
in chart 15, only
6% of property
crimes are
solved.
These case clearance rates are
about half of what the national
average is.
So if you'll please turn with me to
page 16,
I want to highlight charts 16
and 17 which indicate
that A PD is not keeping
pace with crime to be in an
effective deterrent resulting
in solving cases and making
arrests.
Church 16 and 17
polls show that his crime
increased. A P D's
budget also
increased growing
63%
budget of
163 million
in Fy 12 to
265 million in
Fy 24.
However, during this time, the number
of police officers
uh shrink from over
1000 in Fy 12
to only 856
in Fy 24
a decrease of 17%
and well below their staffing
targets.
This data indicates that A PD
has struggled to recruit
and retain police officers
to keep pace with crime.
Even as the department's budget has
grown and received nearly
400,000 from the law
enforcement retention
fund. Thank
you. And I will now turn the presentation
over to my colleague Marco to
discuss issues with case
convictions utilization of
diversity programs and reentry
programming.
>> Good morning, Mr., Chair
Members of the Committee
and thank you, Doctor Tillman for that concise
introduction. My
name is Marco Antonio Lura
and I would like to continue our discussion
of accountability by
directing your attention to page
18.
As my colleague pointed out
our analysis of a PD
data demonstrated an accountability
gap for criminal behavior
due to flattening or declining
clearance and conviction rates
as well as an increase in reported
felonies, law
enforcement and the court systems
are both responsible for addressing
this accountability gap
as such. LFC staff
analyze court data to better understand
their role in the accountability
gap. Starting
off with overall felony convictions
chart 19 on
page 18,
illustrates overall convictions
for felony cases
in the second judicial district from
2017 to
2023.
The D A's office reports a
48% decrease in
overall felony convictions from
2017 to
2023.
Chart 20 on page
19
illustrates conviction rates
for multiple types of felony
cases from 2017
to 2023.
Only homicide and vehicular
homicide cases are consistently
prosecuted above the national
benchmark of
74%
domestic violence, sexual
offenses and crimes against
person cases are the
lowest convicted types of felony
cases.
The D's Office is implementing
promising initiatives to address these
metrics which include the formation
of specialty teams, an
increase in staffing levels
and the continued use of discovery
support teams.
Turning to page
20
LFC staff also wanted to
know who is more likely to cycle
through the criminal justice
system. Charts.
22 and 23
show that individuals with
multiple felony arrests
make up a relatively small
percentage of the total population
arrested for a felony
but are responsible for a larger
percentage of all felony
arrests.
Once individuals are
arrested, their case May be
convicted or dismissed depending
on the overall strength of the
case.
There are many different points within
the criminal justice system where
cases can drop out of the system.
As illustrated in figure two
on page
21.
According to our analysis of
felony case dismissals,
most cases are dismissed before
indictment due to a lack of witness
or victim cooperation.
Chart 24 on page
22
illustrates how the reasons for
dismissal are distributed among
cases that were not indicted
or convicted in the analytic
sample.
LFC staff found that most
dismissals for repeat offenders
were due to evidence collection,
victim cooperation and
witness cooperation
issues.
Victim and witness cooperation
was a reason for case dismissals
in 32% of
cases. However,
witness cooperation by
itself represented 19%
of cases and victim
cooperation represented
13% of
cases.
You May also notice in chart
24 that competency
was the reason for dismissal in
6% of the cases in the
sample.
LFC staff conducted a
separate analysis of competency
cases and found
that out of 25,000
felony cases at Bernardo Metropolitan
Court, 2%
or around 500
were dismissed because of
incompetency
of those individuals with four
more felony charges.
7.5%
were dismissed due to incompetency
from 2017
to 2023
compared to 4% from
2011 to
2017.
Figure three on page
24 illustrates
the felony competency
process
concerning competency
evaluations. LFC
staff found that there is a shortage of
qualified certified
evaluators which can
lead to delays in completing
evaluations.
The State currently has only
22 certified competency
evaluators that operate on a contract
basis. There
is a limited qualified behavioral
health workforce who can provide
competency and dangerous
evaluations to the
court.
Shifting gears away from arrests,
convictions and competency.
I'd like for everyone to flip to page
25.
LFC staff were also
interested in knowing more about
pretrial diversion and detention
practices.
Diversion is the practice of
diverting individuals out of
the criminal justice system and
into treatment
as seen in figure four on
page 25 as
well as in Appendix B,
the US substance abuse and Mental
Health administration developed the
sequential intercept model
as a way to identify resources
and gaps in services at each
intercept and to
develop local strategic action
plans.
In reviewing pretrial detention
and diversion. LFC staff
found that the Albuquerque Community
Safety Department
diverts 5% of
Albuquerque Police Department's overall
call volume
but impacts on subsequent criminal
justice system involvement for
those they serve are not yet
known. It
is recommended that the department should
seek to monitor and report on
the department's impact on those
individuals that it has served
and whether there has been a reduction
in subsequent criminal justice system
interaction.
Similarly, it is recommended
that the Bernalillo County law
enforcement assisted diversion
program should report
updated performance measures and
outcomes.
If individuals aren't diverted
by law enforcement, they May be
diverted by the district Attorney's
court prep
prosecution diversion programs
and treatment. Courts provide criminal
justice involved individuals
who might be experiencing mental
and substance use disorders,
treatment services and
resources. Prior to
prosecution
chart 25 on page
27
illustrates that prosecutorial
offers to diversion are
increasing within the second judicial
District Attorney's Office.
But acceptances to these treatment,
courts and completions have
lacked
LFC staff also found
that statewide treatment court
participation was rising
prior to Fy 20
but then fell for several years during
the pandemic chart
26. On page
27
illustrates statewide treatment,
court capacity and participation
numbers from Fy 17
to Fy
24
in Bernal Leo County treatment
court participation decreased by
30% from Fy
19 to Fy
24.
However, in the third quarter
of fy 24. The second
judicial district court
reported that both the adult
treatment and young adult treatment
courts were overcapacity
while other treatment courts remained
underutilized.
Wait times for treatment courts
already at capacity
in the second judicial district
were up to four months in
2023
potentially delaying services
for these individuals.
These data indicate New Mexico
and Bernau counties could expand
capacity as needed and
prioritize increasing
participation in evidence-based
treatment courts to reduce wait
times.
Other resources at the pretrial
detention intercepts include
the medication assisted treatment
program at the metropolitan
Detention Center.
NBC is currently working towards
establishing a seven day a week
addiction medicine
program.
LFC staff were also
interested in analyzing the
impacts of bail reform.
LFC staff found that new
arrests of defendants on
pretrial release
represent a small fraction
of overall crime reported in
Burn Leo County
chart 27 on page
29
illustrates that between
2017
and 2023
80.8%
of defendants on pretrial
release picked up no new
charges.
14.4%
were arrested on a new nonviolent
charge and
4.8% were were
arrested on a new violent
charge.
LFC staff also found
that the rate of preventive detention
motions granted has increased
in the past two
years.
Chart 28 on page
30
shows that so far in
2024
59% of
pretrial detention motions have
been granted in
2023
56% of pretrial
detention motions are granted.
And before 2023
the rate of pretrial detention motions
granted was approximately
50%
important to note is that in
May 2024
the New Mexico Supreme Court
issued rule changes that call
for defendants with a pending
felony or certain
misdemeanors who are
arrested again on new felony
counts or enumerated
misdemeanors to
remain jailed until a Judge
in the initial case decides whether to
modify or revoke
their conditions of release.
The revised rules include
other changes including
removing an option for judges to
require mental health or addic
addiction treatment
as a condition of release from
jail and prohibiting
judges from using the results of
a public safety assessment
to decide whether someone is released
or kept in jail until their
trial.
The legislature should consider
outlining minimum standards for
pretrial
services.
Flipping ahead to page
32.
LFC staff found that recent
increases in recidivism
suggest the need for improved
treatment and re-entry
services
chart 29 on page
32
shows that as of the second
quarter of Fy 24
the three year recidivism rate at the
New Mexico Corrections Department
is currently at
40%.
This marks a 4%
increase from the recidivism rate
that was reported in Fy
23.
This increase reverses
a downward trend in recidivism rates
reported from Fy 20 to
Fy 23
previous reports from the
LFC and the University
of New Mexico's Institute for Social
Research indicate
that an M CD is not fully
implementing evidence-based practices
into its daily
operations.
This includes the proper reporting
of performance
metrics.
Since fy 21
the legislature has made significant
investments in programs like
transitional housing and
reentry services to support
offenders reintegration into
society and to reduce
recidivism.
These investments include expanding
housing options, providing
comprehensive support services
and enhancing job training and
educational opportunities for
individuals transitioning out of
the correctional system.
However, reporting on the
outcomes of these investments must
be further developed by NM
CD.
Lastly, LFC staff
recommends that expanding access
to behavioral health coverage
and substance abuse treatment
is key to addressing
recidivism
of the incarcerated population.
LFC staff have previously
reported that 59%
are dealing with a mental health
disorder and 65%
are dealing with a substance use
disorder.
I will now turn the presentation back
over to Doctor Tullman for a final
keyword on recommendations.
>> Thanks Marco.
If you will please turn with me back
to page six, I'm just going to
highlight a few of the key
recommendations out
of all these that are listed
here.
So first, uh the
legislature should consider
outlining minimum standards
for pretrial services
with the administrative office
of the Courts, administering
and providing certification
for programs that meet
these standards.
Uh The legislature
could also consider
appropriating funds to
the administrative office of the courts
for certified competency
evaluators.
Um Next, the
administrative office of the
Courts should work
with each judicial
district courts to increase
participation in treatment,
courts and pretrial diversion
programs.
Uh The second judicial
District Attorney's
Office should focus on
diverting low-level offenders
into programs
treating addiction and
addressing other root causes of
crime.
The Albuquerque Police
Department should increase
the number of sworn law enforcement
officers to meet staffing
targets
and the new Mexico Corrections
Department should increase
participation in a
successful completion of
recidivism reducing
programs. Uh Thank
you so much and we will now
stand by for
questions.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Um And thank you for the presentation
and the um the report.
Uh It was very
interesting.
Um I had a
question if you could repeat
the um
statistic
cited early on
about the number of
the percent of cases
dismissed
when the
defendant had
multiple
felonies.
>> Yeah. Chair Representative
Dixon. Uh we
had identified, uh
we looked at all the court
case records for Metro
Second Judicial district
courts over the past
seven years from 2017 to
23.
And so we found within
that there were 677
individuals at Metro Court,
741 individuals
at the second judicial
court who
had four or more
felonies.
Uh from there, there was
569 individuals
of Metro and
100 and 55 individuals
of the second judicial district
court that were
their cases had been
dismissed
or for some
reason.
>> Thank you.
Um
It also
um
I was wondering in chart
27
sorry Mr. Chair,
um
the
um number
of nonviolent
versus new
violent crime
arrests. I was
wondering if there's any
data um
that sort of
is consistent
throughout
um
the new violent
crime arrests.
So is there any do
we have any indication
of
sort of determining
factors
for when we release someone?
And
>> Chair Representative
Dixon? Uh there's
multiple factors that can go
into that, that I imagine
are present and are presented
in court. One of them being a
pretrial uh
screening
assessment,
um which
you and them is in the process
of analyzing,
they provided us
with some initial data which is
presented there in chart
27. Uh
We find that it is very
highly correlated with the risk
assessment and their
likelihood to go on to commit
new violent crime.
Uh There's a lot of
other
evidence, uh just
the uniqueness of the
case presented by the
prosecutor and everything
else that is presented by the
prosecutor to the Judge
who then ultimately makes
the, the decision
based on all of the
evidence presented
by the prosecutor in that
particular case,
>> Mr., Chair Representative
Dixon, I'd also like to add
that the UN
Misr report that
is cited on page
29. I
don't believe it breaks down
those arrests by
type but
violent crimes uh consist
of murder, non negligent,
manslaughter, rape, robbery,
and aggravated assault, but that's something
to follow up on.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and
thank you. And is there, you
know, so for to 27
the data is from 2017
to 2023. Is there a way
to get the actual breakdown
per
year?
>> Uh Chair Representative Dixon,
we can follow up with the
UN MS Institute of
Social Research who's
currently working on that
report and it should be published
soon. Um
But we can follow up with them to
see if they can break that
down year by
year.
>> Thank you. Uh Last
question, uh Mr. Chair
um for
the report, did you guys um
talk to
like, did you sort of interview
and have conversations
with a PD and
the second judicial
District Attorney?
Because what I'm wondering
is, you know, I feel
like there have been investments
made in the past
several years to support
investigations
and, you know, better
collection of evidence. And
I, I'm curious
if we have seen
any of that trending
in a positive direction.
>> Uh Chair Representative
Dixon, we did uh meet with
the second District Attorney's
office and they shared with us
some informa uh some of
the efforts and initiatives that they
are doing their staffing
special teams.
Um They are also
working with the A PD through
their shield unit which
staffs about 20
officers and
paralegals within
the District Attorney's
office just this year.
What we don't know
is a lot of these initiatives
are new this year. And so we
haven't seen those efforts
matriculate to case
outcomes and conviction rates.
And so a lot of these efforts are too
early to tell at this time, but
we would like to follow up with
that.
>> Thank you. Thank you,
Mr.
Chair
>> interrupt.
Sure, thank
you.
Um Thank you Mr.
Chair
so recently and
I was looking for it here.
Um
The FBI
from New Mexico said, hey,
the cartels
are
the reason for crying,
but I didn't see cartels addressed
in here. And
so what I,
what my thought is is that
Albuquerque particularly
is, is a great market
for drugs.
So
how do we deal
with,
with uh with that? You got
a great market and you got a great marketing
effort and
that's what causes the, the
crime.
So is that something we could
even, I didn't see it
addressed at all.
>> Well, Chair, Senator
Share that was, this
was outside
the scope of the initial
crime report that we did
in 2018.
Um We did talk to the
FBI and all the
not FBI sorry. A
PD second
attorney. That wasn't one of the things
that was brought up to our
attention, but it's something we
can look into and
should probably,
uh, yeah, if a PD
or local fe I was
here, then they could answer
that as well.
>> So, Mr. Chair, I think that
that's
to me, I think we're looking at the wrong
things all the time. So here we're,
we're, we're talking about mental health
and drugs.
Granted those are problems.
But why do we have the drug problem?
It's because we've got
a great marketing effort to
sell drugs.
And uh
so uh but
let me ask another question here
related to that. So
the various places,
50 to 60% of the people
that are arrested have mental
health or drug addiction
issues.
That is that A
I depend on what I was looking at
here. But >> Mr.
Chair, Senator Chair,
yes, those figures are for the
incarcerated population, not the
arrested population.
>> So
why, why do we
have such high mental
health issues? I
understand the drugs got a
marketing operation but why
mental health, what
causes
that
>> Chair Senator
like we highlighted in the report,
New Mexico ranks really
highly on some of these kind
of root causes
uh for substance
abuse issues.
Um Mental
health, behavioral health,
what we find is that there's a lot of
low utilization in these
types of programs geared
towards these
individuals.
And so that could potentially
be a contributing factor.
>> So Mr. Chair back
to why
Utah doesn't have the same
problem?
I think that's so
with the convictions I see.
Let me go to here to
one of these charts.
Um
So reasons
for any felony
discharge
evidence
collection.
That seems pretty basic. Of
course, when you hide it from the
defense, that's a whole different
program, I guess.
But
um but
victim and witness
cooperation,
those are huge. Do we
know why they, why people
don't co-operate?
Mr. Chair >> uh
Chair Senator. It could be
for a number of reasons. So
like witness cooperations
and some of the cases that we
reviewed, I mean, that was simply like
police officers not showing
up to cases,
it could be other
cases.
Um You know, some of those hard to
prosecute cases could be like
domestic violence, sexual
assault cases where witness
cooperation
is
a factor in
those cases.
Um But what was concerning to us
was the case that we reviewed where police
officers not showing up to
felony
cases.
Um So those were some of the
cases uh examples
that we saw.
>> So again, Mr. Chair,
why, why don't the police
officers show
up
Mr. Chair? I think that I
think there are answers out there.
I think I know at least one of the
answers, maybe not 100%
of it,
but
there's reasons why the police
officers don't show
up. And
it's probably the same
reason for most of the time,
most of the
officers.
Um
So
when we talk about more
officers,
certainly, I agree. But
I also know that there's new
technologies in the
world.
Um
While most of the big brother
technologies like cameras on
everything, uh really
annoy
Um Do we have
any new technologies that could
replace police
officers?
>> Mr. Chair Senator
Scher? That is
a good question.
And I would like to say that the LFC
visited Albuquerque Police
Department's real time Crime
Center during this
policy spotlight.
And we noticed that they
continuously use surveillance
technologies,
algorithmic technologies
such as predictive policing
models as well as
crime analysts who
comprehensively
search databases
for real time information
as far as replacing police
officers. I
believe APD views
the real time Crime Center as
supplementary to their
operations.
>> So Mr. Chair,
I, I'm looking for here,
6% of property crimes
are solved
and yet we have a camera
everywhere. I mean
literally
everywhere
in my pocket, there's cameras
everywhere and yet we
can only solve 6% of the
crimes.
OK. I
uh
I can handle that, but we also have
crimes against persons
and drug offenses and
sexual offenses which we are
not solving either
at dramatically low
rates.
OK? So if you break my window
that May not be
raised to the to the level
of whatever but
but sexual offenses and crimes
against persons. I'm assuming crimes
against persons means that I got beat
up somewhere.
Um,
I, I just find it
difficult to believe that we're not
using the technology that we
have to look for
that. Uh, you
know, I don't know how
many houses now have a ring
doorbell or something like a
ring doorbell so
you can watch the entire
neighborhood just by,
just by asking the people in the
neighborhood. Hey, what happened?
Somebody has a camera on
it or cameras on
outside the, the buildings,
cameras inside the buildings,
cameras inside the buildings.
Ok.
So,
um, it
just seems to me that there's
a,
I don't know if it's a, a
mentality issue
that we don't want to do this or if
it's really, you need more
officers to deal with this or, or
what. But, but some of these
offenses.
Wow.
Seem pretty
serious and we're not solving
them.
Um,
and I'd like to know why.
Ok. And then
finally the recidivism thing,
you know. So we talk about how do you
integrate people? Um,
make sure that they're, they're
ready to go out into
society.
How many of them can't
read?
My guess is that's
probably
a huge number. They
can't read, they
can't read, they can't get a
job, they can't get a job.
They might as well steal something and
smoke dope.
Oh, we don't smoke it anymore. We
eat it.
Sorry.
So can't read. Thank
you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good
morning. Um
Ryan and Marco. Thanks
for your work. Um I
just have a quick question, Mr.
Chairman, having to
do with the lead program.
I was sponsor of that Legislation
more than once. And then I did
another piece one year
and expanded the lead program
which is a law enforcement
assistance diversion
program. Um
I expanded to Brun Leo
County and
I think it was Espanola
Rio Riba and other
Las Cruces.
And so I read
now in your presentation
that apparently
um there
the program
uh only has at least
in Bernalillo County, they
only had two case
managers
and I'm looking at page
26 right?
And two case managers
and also two officers
making referrals.
So it hasn't
really gone very far
there. I I thought it was
pretty good >> Chair.
Thank you, Senator Rodriguez.
When we had visited them in,
back in 21 for
our 22 update,
we had found that there was only
a couple of case manager, we went and
visited them
and met with our
staff and
there was only two case managers
and only like two officers
really making referrals.
And what it really takes is
officers
making, uh
who, who are willing to kind
of adopt the,
the practice of the lead and kind of really
go out and make the
referrals. And
so what we found at the time is
it really was,
wasn't
being
adopted fully throughout the
departmentwide
and So U and M
just, just published
a
an evaluation of
the program and finding it was
like u low utilization,
low uptake and low
referrals.
And so what we would like
to see is continued
efforts to implement
the program because it can be
successful and evaluations of
lead programs elsewhere
have found that these types of
programs can be highly
successful in reducing
later criminal
justice.
>> Ok. Thank you. It seems
like they only had less than 100
people in the program
there. So,
um and also you're
recommending that they
publicly report updated
performance measures and
outcomes. Isn't that now
reported already?
>> Uh Chair
Senator, uh their
outcomes
were
old data from
2018 and so there
wasn't anything new. It was the
same thing we had previously looked at
three years ago when we did
this and so there hadn't been new
up updated data
except for the UN M
evaluation that
was released late last
year,
>> the new information,
we've got more numbers.
So thank you very much, Mr.
Chairman and thank
you
>> represent
Garcia.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks
for the presentation on
page eight.
You have their crime
upgrade, crime, crs have
been flat or increased.
What, what do you mean either flat
or increased? How can you,
how do you explain that?
>> Uh Chair Representative
Garcia, if you look
at chart three,
what the FBI
crime data
that was reported
recently? It was
looking at
a couple of things. So in chart
three. You see
that
all violent crime
since first quarter of
23 to 24
has remained the same.
Uh, homicide rates
have also remained the
same.
All property crime,
motor vehicle theft. Those
dark blue bars are
going up. And if you
look at that down on chart
four, the top blue
line uh
for violent crime rates
in Albuquerque and Burn
County, it's
remained, it's gone
up around 2017
and it plateaued and remained
high. And so that's
why we say it's been flat
or increased in certain
areas.
>> I thank you for that Mr.
Chairman. And another question.
Yeah, you guys are blaming it on
social problems. What do you
mean by Social
>> uh Chair Representative
Garcia? We're
looking,
we want to look at
all areas of the criminal
justice system and there are
several areas and
contributing factors
throughout.
And so we highlight a lot of the
social conditions and root
causes that can
lead to crimi genic
behavior later in
life. Uh It's
kind of one of those long term
solutions, but one of those root
causes that we
can address uh
amongst one of the
areas throughout the
criminal justice
system.
>> Uh Thank you, Mr. Chairman
and on, on, on the soldier part
of that, are you, are you targeting uh
minorities or
people of color on, on the
social part of it? Is
that what we're talking about >> here? Uh
Chair Representative
Garcia, I think
we're addressing that
for everyone some of the things that we
highlight are just uh
low educational
outcomes across the board
in the State.
Um The high rate of
childhood adverse
experiences across
the State,
um high rates of
substance abuse
across the State, which are
higher than all of them are
higher than national averages.
And so these are areas
that we can target
as some of those social
conditions and root
causes.
And so we can't just target one area
of the justice system. We want
to try and target all
areas of, the justice
system throughout the
process.
>> OK. Thank you for that clarification.
Uh uh Two
more questions
on, on your crime
statistics. How
much are these
stats including
uh
juveniles?
>> Uh Chair
representative,
uh I would assume
that they contain
juveniles when I looked
at court records,
juvenile crimes.
A and this was for
court cases within the second
district, juvenile
crime accounted for
about 12%
of all crimes
of from
2017 to
2013.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair
11 last question
on, on all the crimes that are happening.
How much, how much of these crimes
are involve drugs in
them like fit
and all that kind of
stuff?
>> Yeah, Chair Representative
Garcia. Uh we don't
have that exact uh
the rate of
cases involving
drugs. Uh
I'm not sure if it's available
necessarily in the court
data that we
had looked at,
but we could try and follow up and get
back to you on
that
>> Mr. Chairman. And
if you would, because you know
there's a lot of drug problems in the State,
New Mexico, not just in Bean
County, you know, and in
the small communities, they're
struggling because uh
a lot of these
people are hooked up on this fentaNYL
and all they do is steal
to get more uh fentaNYL.
So, you know, that would be good
to find out
the stats on what's
causing these problems because we need
to address that issue first. Thank
you, Mr.
Chair.
>> Thank you, Chairman and thank
you both for the
presentation.
Just a couple of quick
questions,
your
recommendations
listed on page
six.
Um
I'm not sure when this report was
finalized.
July today's
date has the
15th on it. But
I'm curious was this information
shared with the governor's
office?
>> Uh Chair Representative
Pettigrew uh
becomes
public uh
when we present
it.
>> I'm sorry, >> it
becomes public when we present it.
But we did work with several
like all of the criminal justice
agencies and
soliciting their
uh just trying to get their insight,
kind of their experiences
and their expertise in the
criminal justice system as
well.
>> I appreciate that
Chairman. Uh My
direct reasoning for that
is out of all
the bullet points that I
I read on here. I
don't see any of
those in her
target
Legislation.
And if LFC
is Chairman is
recommending that these are some
of the things that could help
in our largest population
county, I would, I
would think that that
would be
a basis for some
decisions,
Mr. Chairman and
presenters um
on page 18,
I wrote a note
and I think I'm hoping
I wrote it wrong,
but I felt like,
uh,
the statement was made
that, um,
that this analysis comes
out from LFC.
That the reason why
we have so few
convictions
is because of our
law enforcement and our court
system.
Did, did I hear that
correctly? And if not, can
you correct that for
me,
>> Chair Representative Petigru,
it's, uh, what we do
is we look all throughout the criminal
justice system and
different areas and
challenges.
Um So we, we
looked at
when we look at a number of arrests
and also then
it can then go
to the
District Attorney's office and
what issues are present
there. We're trying to make
a conviction.
Um There can also be a lot of things
that happen outside of
convictions such as diversion
programs, but while
we've seen some increases in it,
we haven't seen
that account for the
entire accountability
gap. Uh
So we do believe that these
are areas that can be
focused on
um to help improve the
criminal justice system
once uh an
accused comes into the
system.
>> Thank you, Chairman and thank you for
that response.
On that same page, it
talks about uh
from 2017
to 2023.
Um
prosecutors failed to obtain
conviction
percentage rate remained
stagnant somewhere between 60
72%.
So
for lesser
crimes
Chairman, it seems
like we have a
very high percentage
of, of
people that
did not obtain a
conviction for
whatever reason,
almost three quarters of
it. If we, if we
look at the high end of that,
then as we flip over
Chairman to page
20 then we
talk about 75%
of the Majority of people arrested
are arrested for one felony
only
Chairman. The presenters,
what I'd like to do is, is have
you expand upon? Ok,
if I can continue
to get away with
something over here,
what are the potentials that
my,
for my desire
to to continue?
Um
Is this
problem back here is the reason why
we actually get to felony
acts to begin
with? So
if I'm a kid
and I can get away with stealing a
cookie and not get caught
and I do it again and
I can do it again at some point in
time, I'm gonna just
take the whole DDN cookie jar,
right? And so
is in your
opinion, does
that that low
conviction rate in the beginning?
Cause is that
the, is, is that
the cause for the increase
in, in higher
rate crimes to where
we finally get to a felony?
And then we have such a low conviction
rate there because
of all the other problems.
Would that, would that be a fair
statement?
>> Mr. Chair Representative
Pettigrew, the criminal
justice is
multifaceted
faceted
conviction rates represent
one part of
the coordination of the entire
criminal justice system.
So I would say that is one
component,
>> Mr. Chairman and
Gentlemen, II, I feel
like we kind of danced around that
as
do do specifically
with the data that, that, that
you guys have spent so much
time pulling together.
Do we feel like the lack of
effort and the lack
of intensity in the
beginning? Part of somebody's
criminal career is
part of the reason why we get to
the felony convictions.
>> Uh Yeah. Chair Representative per
pedigree. I think we can look at it
like throughout,
in all
case or, or in
in all phases of the
system. Uh My colleague
Marco highlighted,
you know, some of
the
different phases and
community resources. And
so we find like various
uh touchpoints
uh for
offenders and accused
and defendants coming into the criminal
justice system. Some of those can be
like community touchpoints and
treatment touchpoints
uh where some of
the they might not have
received the treatment that they
might need um or
help that they need or resources
that they need. That could be as simple as like
housing or
substance use treatment.
Uh That particular
analysis that you had highlighted and
focuses on when they come into the
criminal justice
touchpoints,
dealing with arrest and
prosecution. So trying
to look at like at this particular
touchpoint, what seems to be the issues
and challenges
here. Our analysis
found that
evidence collections,
an issue of
witness cooperation can
certainly be an issue. Victim
cooperation could certainly be an
issue. Um
The district attorney is taking
some strides such as like
the A PD shield unit trying
to work
um to
help with address some of
those evolutionary
issues.
>> OK.
Thank you, Chairman and thank you
for that answer.
Um
Later on in the
presentation, the
discussion came to
competency
and with respect to
that if I
understand correctly,
I don't remember. I didn't mark
the page.
Um We only have
22 competency
evaluators in Bernal, Leo
Albuquerque area
and mister
Chairman. How many
do you or
does the report suggest?
Like I said, I missed the page.
Uh What should that number
really look
like?
>> Uh Chair Representative
Petty grew uh
in our conversations
with staff. We know
that that was a bit
of a bottleneck when it came to
the competency, those
cases that involved
issues with competency.
Uh the lack
of certified evaluators.
Uh We'd probably
want to reach out to
the administrative office of the
courts uh
to get their
um
evaluation of what that number
should be.
>> Thank you, Chairman. Um
Thank you.
So the
I I think the point that I'm trying
to get to on that is if we
have a lack of
people that can do
the competency evaluation
on somebody that's
facing a felony
conviction.
And then we start going into
some of the other
touchpoints as,
as I think y'all
described,
what percentage of people are
just getting out of the system
not being touched at all
because we don't have
time to get, we don't have the people
to do the competency
evaluation. So
they're not getting analyzed and the case
is just getting dropped
because either
the D A's office or
somebody
or the Sheriff's Department,
whatever
can't, can no longer
hold on to that while they're trying
to solve other things.
Is that a pretty
striking number?
Chairman, >> uh
Chair Representative
Pettigrew? Yeah,
what we do know is that
2% of all felony
cases in the second
district over the past
seven years had an
issue of competency or case
dismissed due to competency
in our analysis of the repeat
offenders. We found that
8% of those cases
were dismissed due to
competency. What
we don't know and what isn't
available in the court
records that we
have to analyze is
what services they
do receive
afterwards.
So that's
the potential follow
up question
for the courts. And
>> OK, Chairman, thank
you. So with, with that, if
2% are,
are
getting the
competency,
if I, if I understood that,
right.
So that means that they're
being pushed through a different system.
So does that mean they're not
getting a conviction and they
are bypassing
the conviction process
for going through a mental health
proceeding?
Are we actually taking
somebody that committed a
felony. We know
they committed a felony because we're gonna
send them through the mental health side of
this Chairman.
Um,
but they're not receiving
the conviction because
they're going through the mental
health.
Is that well,
>> Chair Representative
Pettygrove, they, at that
point, the case is
dismissed and they aren't
actually convicted
of what
of the
final felony arrest that
they are accused of
>> Chairman. Uh, you know,
there used to be a time when,
when it took the
conviction to get
the mental health
assistance that needed to
be happening. Now
we're bypassing the
conviction. And,
and so what we're saying
is everybody that goes
into a to a mental
health uh
process
and even in our
numbers,
when, when we look at
felony charges and
return felons
with that, is
that a pretty clear jump?
Is that a pretty
point A to point
B? Don't get a conviction,
go to mental health, get
out of mental health,
repeat a felon.
Don't get a conviction, go to mental
health, keep going around in
a circle. And
so when we look at
75%
of, of
our
um
I think it was your, the number
that was shown on the chart
was
75%.
The Majority of people arrested
for a felony only commit one
felony.
Does that mean that because the rest of the
time? And are we tracking
that? How many times? OK.
After that, did they go through a
mental health
thing?
>> Uh Chair representative
pedigree of,
if you'll look at figure
three, this outlines
the process in
terms of competency.
And
in those cases,
again, in our analysis, we
found that like 2%
that's
of all felony
cases, which
represents only five or
512 people in
Albuquerque or the second
district. Um
during the past seven
years, uh of
that was a small percentage
who did come
through uh
with repeat felonies.
So the
Majority of those cases
with
competency issues
raised or were were dismissed
due to issues of
competency
uh did not
repeat or have
repeat
felonies,
>> but it's not a felony
Chairman. It's not a
felony if they
get by, if they by
bypass the conviction
and they go into mental health,
felony never gets
charged.
Would that be that be
correct? >> Chair Representative
Pedre, correct. It's a
felony arrest, not a
charge? >> Ok.
Thank you. I think I'm
more now, but I'll get
with you later. Thank
you.
>> Oh my God. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be
quick. Thank you for
your presentation.
I was curious on some of the
charts. They start
at 2000 and go to
2024
or yeah, 2000,
go to 2024 and
others.
There's longer and shorter
periods in there. Can you tell me
why the discrepancy
is it? If
you could just elaborate why the discrepancy
on the years
>> uh Chair
of Representative Armstrong
for some of the charts like
chart four on page
eight chart eight
on page 11, this
was FBI data that
we had access
uh
dating back to
2000
for other charts
uh
like chart 13,
for example, on page
14
and probably,
or page 18 chart
nine, we
utilize a second
judicial court
district court data
and Bernalillo County
metro court
case record
data specifically
for those analy for
many of the analysis throughout the report.
So for those who was looking at
2017 to
23
we wanted to go back
to when we originally did this
report in
2018
to be able to provide an
update to the 2018
report looking at crime in
Burnley County. >> Ok.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and
thank you panel. I I assumed that
was the case that you
not. I I just
worry that when we require
more reporting,
you know, we start now with
this kind of reporting and,
and it's just hard to coincide
that so it would be I
think in the best interest of the
State and for
us if we
hone in on some of that
reporting and what do we
really let's compare apples
to apples and see
what, what the trends are.
I can tell you with the
property crime in
Albuquerque, a
business as a business
owner there. We don't
even report it anymore.
We just deal with it,
you know, because it's,
it costs
an for property crime,
it costs the owner of the property
or the business, um,
hours time,
man, hours,
uh, pay.
So it costs more money to actually
report it and wait for the police
to get there and go through all
the things that we have to
go through. So honestly,
I, I just don't know
that that
people are reporting it anymore and
I, I think people know
that um
as far as page six
and seven, can you
tell me on the
under recommendations
on the authorizing the
pharmacy board and doh
to acquire pharmacies
and high need communities
to make mat available.
What it can you refresh my memory?
What? Mat is
>> sorry? Chair
Representative Armstrong
is stands for medication
assisted treatment.
>> Ok.
Ok. Um Thank you
for that information. I
um
if we're doing that, if
that is, is what
we choose to do,
I want to make sure the pharmacies are
getting reimbursed all
equally and at the same
rate because that doesn't
happen in New Mexico. I can tell
you for sure that does
not happen for rural New Mexico
specifically.
Uh It does and
private pharmacies, it does not
happen. So if we make that requirement,
I want to make sure we
require them to reimburse
the same amount of
dollars. Uh
The other thing
is
um
oh, the seeking of the uh
Medicaid State
plan uh
to do an amendment
for Medicaid coverage 90
days prior to the
release.
Do I thought we passed
Legislation? And maybe
Charles can answer this. I
thought once you are
incarcerated you're
automatically enrolled in
Medicaid.
>> Mr. Chairman Representative.
Uh if you are enrolled in
Medicaid, uh they'll
suspend your
enrollment while you're
incarcerated.
And then there was a law
passed to help people sign
up for Medicaid. Uh when
they're leaving, the federal
government is now
approving State waivers
and plan amendments to
allow for certain
transitional services
to start in prison, which
Medicaid usually doesn't
pay for in prison
services up
to 90 days before release.
And so we're recommending that New Mexico
take advantage of what other states
have already had approved
to start with that transitional
and reentry services.
>> Ok. Thank you. Thank you
for that answer, Charles
and, and thank you all for your presentation.
That's all the questions I
have.
>> Thank you,
represent our
meal.
>> Yeah,
Mr. Chair,
when I'm looking through this
crimes against Children,
are they bundled
into sexual offenses
and domestic
violence?
>> Uh Chair representative
is there. >> I'm looking
on page 19
conviction rates for mul
multiple types of, of
felony
cases.
>> Uh Chair representative, I don't
have that information
off the top of my head, but I could, I'd
have to go back and look at the data
specifically and can
follow up with you.
>> Thank you, Mr.
Chair. I'd appreciate having
um particular information
on that since we were talking about A
I. And so I think that
that's important to look at
also Mr.
Chair when I'm looking at this domestic
violence with a 45%
conviction rate
knowing that oftentimes
victims of domestic
violence, it takes seven or eight
times before they actually
uh uh follow
through on those reports.
So Mr. Chair, I'm asking,
um, in every county, do
we have a domestic violence
team?
>> Uh
Chair representative
that, I don't know, we
focus primarily on
the second judicial district
and the D A there.
I know the D A there
has started a
team
internally to
work on these cases and I
think they staff two or three
prosecutors focusing
specifically on those cases.
And that's a kind of a new effort
within the D A
um this
year essentially. And so
what we don't know is the
effects for outcomes on case
conviction rates and
working with victims of domestic
violence. And,
but it's early, but
we do know, but I can't
speak for other uh
judicial districts and
district attorneys.
>> Uh Mr. Chair, I think
uh there in is, is
my problem is
that um
working with children's advocacy
programs and uh
domestic violence
issues in Socorro
County, um
we need the support as
well and we need the
numbers. Um,
also, uh Mr.
Chair, I see that
um many counties
are not required to report
and so we're not quite sure
what the incidences
are in Socorro
County and, and
that is, of course,
concerning, um,
and, and what our numbers would look
like and how do we provide that support
if we're not providing that
um, those
statistics? Um
So thank you very much and,
and I look forward to
your um, information
on, on violence on Children.
Thank you.
Thank you, Senator
>> Orontes.
Hey, everybody. I, I
came here looking for a special
Session. Anyone seen
one on
my way up north?
Is it, is it? We
are in
Session?
I appreciate all of you looking at
crime issues. Of course, some of us have
been trying to focus on that
in the last few weeks, last few months,
uh in anticipation of, of
the governor's focus on, on
crime. So I, I
appreciate your Committee doing some
of this, the committees I serve
on. I also
think it's right that your Committee
is focusing on Burn Leo County.
And I, I wanted to take the chance to
speak a little bit about
that focus because uh
um Representative
Armstrong was talking about being a businesswoman.
Many, many of you all are here, business
people and have other experiences,
you triage things, right?
So the the
bleeding of the patient
here uh is
Buro County. That's where the
ma uh
crime statistics. That's
where the problem is.
That's really where the
heart of matters are at. So your
focus on Buro County I think is right?
And I wanted to encourage you to
continue doing that.
Um, the, the
special Session, the topics
we're gonna be talking about
perhaps I know there's a press
conference right about now
on this subject. So I'm
not sure where, where the special
Session is at right now. But, but
certainly one of the topics we'll be talking
about is whether they,
these crime initiatives
that are being presented to
us make sense at a statewide
level versus at
a burn Leo county level.
And I'll just give you the best example.
Everybody's talking about the panhandling
bill. Realize Buro Counties
has had a panhandling ordinance
ban since
2017.
Uh Do you need the
panhandling uh
application in
Lordsburg? Uh maybe
not so much. Is it a statewide
problem or is it a local
Burle County problem? So
you're doing the right thing here.
Senator Share asked, I
was listening to you all on the radio
driving up. You asked why
are DW I cases getting
dismissed? What are we
afraid of saying
in Burling County? The reason
DW I cases are getting dismissed because
the cops are on the take,
right? What are we afraid
of saying they were getting paid
off to dismiss
cases?
And, and the worst thing about it
is we won't talk
about it. We won't say it
and then we're not holding anybody
accountable for
it
as I understand it. We're
investigating, the
cops were paid off. We've
been investigating it as best I
can tell for Well, over a
year,
evidently, if I'm reading the press
accounts, right, the chief of police was
aware of it for a year
and didn't do anything about it until the FBI
started looking into
it.
Why, why do we
have trouble understanding why we
have a crime problem in Berli
County?
Why are we asking ourselves, why are
cases getting
dismissed?
Why are we surprised that the
metropolitan detention center
be count is about half
staffed and half
full.
Why are we surprised that
the police policy
for a PD, specifically
counsels against arresting
people and we have a
mclendon decision
and agreement in Berno
County not to arrest
people for most low-level
crimes. So
let's go to a special Session and
pass a new law to create a
panhandling bill or
other low-level crimes that
the cops will
ignore
again and not arrest and
not put people in jail and
not use the metropolitan
detention center in Bereal
County because it's not staffed and
we don't want to drive all the way out there
and the guards don't want to drive all the way
out there and the cops don't want to
transport people all the way out
there. And we don't, we don't want,
we don't want to solve the
problem.
Let's just accept it. So we can say
it's a bad parenting,
bad drug problem, bad
poverty. But, but
we ought to confront some things
ourselves. And if, and if,
if, if you allow me to
crash your Committee from time to time,
Mr. Chairman, I'm gonna crash
it and, and crash it.
Good. Right. Which
is, I hope I provoke
some, some thought.
Uh, our problem is
Beio County and, and, and
we should recognize one
of the most important things to me. This Committee
rightfully is always focusing on
our state's economy,
our economics and,
and you should, and I'm, I'm a
businessman, Mr. Chairman. As
many of you all are here. I want a good
economy.
You all were good enough to put my
kids through public
school. Give them a
great education. You were good enough
to put them through, uh,
University of New Mexico
where we've got a house and we're repeatedly
victims of crime there.
I've been victims of crime there. My
son-in-law lives there, victims of crime.
There. We know the story in Burlew
County. We know the story in Albuquerque.
Thank you for putting my daughters
through medical school.
Thank you for putting them through a
public U and M law
school. They're
not living here now.
Uh my daughter's doing her
residency with her new husband
who both went through a medical
school because they're in Houston.
Why? Because they cannot think
of raising a family in, in
Albuquerque.
So my experience
is like many of you all we work
to, to provide good schools to get
our kids through here. And
then they're not gonna
come and live
here in Berlin
County. And the same thing with
employers and economic development,
everything we're doing, we've got to
solve the crime problem in Albuquerque
before anything else is gonna
work.
And I hope my grenades
thrown into your Committee today
will, will uh
perhaps provoke
some future discussion. But I, I
want to commend all of you for,
for this, this report
and I, and I'm looking at it.
Um I hope you'll look at the
tab that I was pointed out to by
Charles. If you look at your
page five, the
research shows the
certainty and swift, swiftness
of being caught is
a more powerful deterrent
than the severity of criminal
penalties.
Realize one of the things we're gonna be
asked to consider later this week is
increasing the penalties for
a felon in possession. We've done
it three times in four
years
and the people that will be advocating
for that increasing it again will
be the first ones to tell you it has not made
one bit of
difference.
So let's go do it again. Let's increase
penalties from now to, we've done
it from 18 months to three years
now to five years. And now the
proposals take it to 12
years has
made a difference. And
your own analysis shows
that it's not the severity
of the criminal penalties that matter.
It's the certainty and swiftness.
And if you look at your own report,
we don't have certainty and swiftness
in Buro County cases
get dismissed. More
prosecution is less
successful in burn Leo County,
fewer clearance
rates.
If you look at your page five, I hope
you really focus on those two
paragraphs. Your
own review, your own analysis,
a small proportion of
criminals in Buro County
are responsible for the Majority
crimes. We know that
if we triage it, we go after the
bad people that are
repeating
the argument that's
made in, in your report
is consistent with what you hear,
which is, well, a lot of
dismissals are happening because
of the the poor collection
of evidence or lack of,
of, of cooperation by
witnesses.
Well, if your cases are getting dismissed
because you're doing poor evidence collection,
who's doing the poor evidence
collection
and how come they're not being held accountable
and how come they're not being trained and
how come they're not being fired and how come they're
not being replaced and how
come the people that supervise them
are not being
replaced?
I just don't know how
this is
complicated.
It never seems very complicated
to me. So Mr.
Chairman, I, I don't have questions for you
all. I appreciate you
all allowing me on my way to Santa
Fe to go up there
and pontificate. And I'm, I'm looking
beyond you to, to our
new incoming uh
legislator MS
Trujillo and her and I had a
chance to visit just briefly
coming in here. We're gonna worry
about panhandling this
week. There are
growers in this State working
for cartels that are growing
thousands of marijuana plants
illegally with
Chinese slave labor
working today in
Estancia and elsewhere.
And we're not doing anything about
it.
We're not doing anything about it
because the State
police dps say
it's not their responsibility. The A
G says it's not their responsibility.
Sheriff says it's not their
responsibility. Albuquerque
Police Department says it's not their
responsibility and everybody
says we haven't given them authority
to enforce our laws.
So let's go past some more
laws
and you're looking over there and you'll see her
nodding her head. We've been working
at this for years.
We have drug cartels
making millions and millions of dollars
operating illegally. We won't do anything
about that. We'll worry about the
panhandlers
with a law that's already been on the boats
for 2017
in Albuquerque.
Come on
folks.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Everything is small.
>> Thank you very.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Thank you both for the
analysis. Uh
This builds upon
work that's been done
at least twice before, right?
20 or
1822.
Um So
uh uh there is a
deep rich and
important uh
continual
engagement from
LFC, our
excellent uh analysts
and evaluators here. Thank
you and thank you to directors
uh Mr. Chair
to the analysts.
Um on
the recommendations,
is there a way
to sort of share
like sort of a
status completed?
Some of these is
when I look at
things um
like the
uh the requiring full
rules for when and
for whom to mandate
24 hour live
monitoring, pre release via
ankle monitors.
And I know this is, I guess
I have to acknowledge that this is
a second judicial
specific.
But how do we
sort of get a dashboard
where we can track how
not only the second
judicial district but
others, you know, for me
coming from Southern New Mexico
and the third judicial district where
public safety is
equally as important,
perhaps uh lower
rates than in the second,
albeit still concerning
things that we have to pay attention
to.
So the, I guess first
question, um
are all of your
recommendation? Let me ask it this
way, are all of the
recommendations currently
to be considered fully
uncompleted that
is, there's not been progress
made on them,
uh, sort of in a measurable
way, at least in the second
judicial district
>> Chair, representative
of many
of these are pretty
much in
process
now,
but in some
of these, in the, these
recommendations really
reflect national best
practices in these
matters. And I think it's a
matter of codifying
them in statute to
recommend best
practices.
Uh, so
that way there isn't that
discretion or
differences across
judicial districts?
>> Got it, got it. Ok.
And, uh, Mr.
Chair and,
um, uh,
for, with that
they're in process and
this goes to some of the, I
think there's a lot of note
for, to say something like
the shield unit and some
of the evidence collection
and sort of overall
work on case
management. You
mentioned that there's been a great
deal of recent
investment in those areas
both in the uh
by the legislature
and by local
municipalities.
How soon can we
start to determine
if those investments are
starting to yield
results?
>> Chair Representative
Small. Uh
I would hope within
a year or so.
It could really take as
long as case
dispos dispositions
take to matriculate.
But what I would hope
to encourage, uh, for the
second judicial District
Attorney's Office is that they begin
to track those cases in which those
teams are involved
in. So that way they can report out
on case disposition
outcomes, conviction rates
and yeah, other
outcomes. >> Ok.
Um Thank you,
Mr. Chair and thank
you both in terms of
the areas and, you know, sort
of the broad, nearly billion
dollars that the legislature
is invested overall.
Are there particular
areas where investments
have been made
and implementation
of those has been
sort of exceptionally
uneven or really
hasn't begun.
And I'm particularly
looking for investments that
have the money is there,
but for whatever
assortment of reasons,
the workflow has
really sort of yet to
begin
>> a Chair.
Representative small,
I
don't have any specific
examples. I know
like
particular areas where
we find a
low or
rather
low utilization in
certain programmings. And
so we need to identify those
like the treatment courts like
with lead um
areas like this, which are, which
are great evidence based and
effective programming.
But we need to really identify
these areas throughout the criminal
justice system
and where
we can really identify and kind
of really try and bolster
these um
investments of
these apparatus within
the criminal justice system to
serve these individuals,
particularly like these cases
where it's like substance use issues
and things like that where
we know that they can be
effective. We just want to
increase utilization
of these areas.
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you. And is
that, I mean, some of that
seems perhaps difficult
by statute
is that rulemaking
is that
staffing is
that sort of an education
piece
>> Chair, Representative
small. It can be a lot of different
things. Sometimes with
the,
it could be a matter of cooperation
between the district attorney's
office and
the public defender,
um and the, and the
courts and every and everything.
So it's a matter
of trying to
kind of keep investing in these
best practices, making these
recommendations
and trying to sustain these
efforts that we find that
work across
administrations. Uh
It's one of the reasons why we want
to know some of
the outcomes of these
efforts at the District Attorney's
office with their specialized
teams, the shield unit, things
like that. So that way we can track
these show the the
outcomes uh see
how it's working and if it's working,
hey, let's keep investing and
continue it. If it's not,
let's figure out why it's not.
And that's why we do these evaluations.
>> That, that makes sense, Mr. Chair
and I'll, I'll sort of wrap
pretty soon.
Um As
I think about it again, we want to
be thinking statewide,
are there sort of
even just from you
all's position as
analysts and within
the evaluation team,
are we sort
of getting a set of questions
that we can ask or
suggest the administration
ask when
we're engaging with our
different dis uh
district Attorney's
offices. We,
we're not having necessarily the deep
dive
yet, mainly
because of staffing and
focus. But
are we developing our
own sort of,
um
cor core sheet of
what we're asking from,
from our district
attorneys?
>> Uh, Chair representative?
Yes. Uh
yes, we are. >> That's
great.
Thank you, Mr. Chair,
the on the
competency piece.
So again, this
is 2% overall
of felonies,
8% of
repeat felonies
arrest. Those are the
numbers that we were given,
correct. And the
8% does that
there's not really a number Mr.
Chair that could be
two, that could be three, that could
be four. Is
there,
can you?
Yeah,
is that usually just
two or is it,
is it much
higher?
>> Uh Chair? Representative
small, I have to look
specifically, our, our
analysis had focused
on those with four or more
repeat felonies. Uh
We were
uh replicating and updating
the analysis that was done in
2018.
And so we only looked at those
with four or more felonies.
Um I don't know if there's
a high end to that
or, but I could follow up
with you on that
>> and Mr. Chair and this
is sort of asking for
additional analysis
when we hear and we've
heard now and, and
I think fully ascribe
to the swiftness
and sureness of justice
are far and
away, the most important
sort of
um justice
side things that we can administer.
There's a lot of prevention
and things like cameras
lighting
DNA, as I
recall from the expert
a couple of years ago,
those things also
helped dissuade or, or
lower rates of crime, summer
jobs as a matter of
fact.
Um,
but the swiftness and
sureness, the vast
Majority of felony
cases that
are falling through that, that are
not being swiftly or
surely adjudicated
the vast Majority of
those at least
92%.
Uh, do not
involve any issues
with competency.
Correct.
>> Uh, Chair Representative Small. That's
correct. >> Got it. So,
I think that's, that's
really helpful for me as we
sort of parse it in you, helping
us work through
one of our core problems.
Perhaps one of a central
problem in like the
acute phase that we're in
right now
is, you
know,
at least 9.2
times out of 10
that has nothing to do with
competency
uh in, in
what's happening. So that's
very helpful for me.
Um I think that wraps
up my questions.
Um Thank you very
much, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much
for the analysis and
just as a final like
urging not
to certainly push the second
judicial district, but
to share the questions
to engage
with our other
districts because
there's, you know, there are challenges
and there are innovations. I'm sure
they're bringing as well as you all know.
Thank you,
sir.
>> Thank you. I, I don't see anybody
else. Oh, Senator Woods, you had a
question. Just >> a
quick question.
Comment, Mr.
Chair.
I decided to try to do
some minor
research by going talk
to the police
chief in Clovis
along with the sheriff
in Curry
County.
And after a lot of talk
and a lot of
discussion,
he said that they weren't
doing
hardly any
investigation
or deterrence
for juvenile
crime.
And I ask you
why
I said, and it shows in
your statistics here
a very
low percent of
felonies committed by
juveniles.
And he said it's not the fact
that it's a low percentage
committed so
much as
it was damn hard to
get any kind of
conviction on a
juvenile.
Plus the
fact
that he said
when one of my officers
arrest a juvenile,
after all the paperwork
is done, they
have to transport
them to
either Roswell
Las
Cruces,
Albuquerque or
Farmington
and put them in a detention
center. And
then if the next day
they are
arraigned by the
court, they have to bring
them back. The
sheriff's deputy
has to go get them
and bring them back.
Now, they can't spend the night in
Clovis, they have to be taken
back to
the detention
center.
And he says because of all
that, he said very
little is done
on juvenile
crime.
And then we turn,
if anything is done, we
turn that over to
Cyfd
to determine
punishment.
And it seems that
Cyfd
May do a job or May not
do a job there,
uh because
are they trained to
do that
particular kind of work?
And I don't mean to bash
Cyfd
again,
but I'm bashing
the fact
that if you let someone
get away with the
crime,
sooner or later, it's just a
whole lot easier to do it
every time. It's more easier
to do it.
So,
I am concerned with
that whole system. Now,
do I expect any of that
to be brought up in a special
Session?
I kind of doubt
it
because that's
gonna, let's leave
that act like it don't happen. I
mean, look at the
statistics
right here,
17 year olds on
page 10.
It shows that there's hardly
any,
anybody does
not.
Is that the truth
or is that just the ones
that we
pull in and
investigate?
I've heard? And you
May have the statistics
to this. I've heard
Mr. Chair
that 40%
of the juveniles
detained in
Albuquerque are
there for
murder
and I don't know if that's true or
not. I could be off on
that, but
if y'all could check on that for
me, uh, for
the special Session, I'd appreciate
that. Uh, the
Governor did tell me
personally that
there was 111 year
old that how already
had two murders under his
belt and she didn't
know what she was gonna do with
him
11 year
old.
So
I think maybe
that end of
this, we need
to talk about a little
more.
And II, I
agree
that the very words that
was used, the,
the, the quickness
of the, of
the charge,
the
swiftness of
certainty.
If you know, for certain,
if you get caught,
that's why they don't want
the federal guys
to put it in federal
court
because there is certainty
of crime, certainty
of a
sentence.
When, when
will
the citizens of New
Mexico
decide they want to do something
about crime?
I, I constantly
ask the residents
in Albuquerque, do you feel
safe?
And I get varied
answers. A
whole lot of different varied
answers.
So when I hear about a Carjacking
happening at
a, a mall
that makes it pretty personal,
they don't feel very safe.
Then
it comes to a point
that I don't
know what the answer is,
but it's come to a
point, there should be an
answer
and a, a lot of it, I'm
afraid
it comes to the point of,
of
I hate to beat a dead horse
but open
borders doesn't help
anything
when you don't at least let
them check in
and do a visual recognition
on them.
It should, to
my ranching friends
down in Southern New
Mexico,
it's a serious thing to
them,
Mr. Chair. I'm rambling.
Thank you very much for the
opportunity.
>> Thank you just as we
wrap up.
You know, the legislature over three
years has put 829
million into this
crime. Right?
And I don't know, my numbers
are a little bit different from the chart to the
paper, but
255 fif
259 million
to improve swiftness,
swiftness, and
certainty of justice.
Right? And then I go across
from page four to page
22 and I
look at the evidence
collection, right? Reasons
that reasons for any
felony charge dismissed
22% of that is
evidence collection.
Even though we raise
pay, we do
retention, we do recruitment,
right? That's
the number one reason. And then then
we look at witness
victim cooperation and witness
cooperation. I mean, those could
be several reasons,
right? They don't want to
get vandalized again for whatever
reason, it could be
anything. But then you
look at discovery suppression,
right?
10%
10% of
discovery is suppressed. I wonder
who that suppressed
by?
Would that be
those DW I cases that
got dismissed or do
you know why discovery
suppress? Maybe Senator Servan
since you're a lawyer?
Discovery suppression.
Explain that to me a little
bit
>> law school education here,
Mr. >> Chairman. Yeah, you you
are U and M educated. So
you did
>> evidence gets suppressed because we have
constitutional guarantees that
assure the rights of a defendant.
That means the police got to do their
job, right? And we just
saw this last week with the Baldwin
case Right. That's exactly what
happened there is they didn't
disclose all the
evidence that could have been what
we use the word exculpatory. In
other words, the defendant
has the right to know everything that
May be
inconsistent with their conviction.
So it gets suppressed. But Mr.
Chairman, it all comes back to the
point I was making, making earlier.
It's not that hard to train police
to do it. Right. And
when, and when they're not doing it
right. Maybe the people
that are supposed to be in charge of them should be
replaced.
But this is not
anything new. This, this
has been true for decades.
Uh It's our constitutional
guarantees. And if evidence is being
suppressed, judges are finding out that
the police are not collecting the evidence
correctly
and it's not that
hard.
>> So the things that are in our control
are evidence collection,
uh
discovery suppression
and timeliness.
It might take those three numbers
and add them all together.
Uh 19 and 10
or 22 that's 32
and timeliness, that's
39% of the
cases are related
to, to
police
timeliness,
uh evidence oppression
and evidence collection. So
40 roughly 40%
of the cases we
have put money into to
do swift justice that
hasn't accomplished
that you
guys are shaking your
heads
and, and so when you put those
numbers together and you say we
spent
829
million over a three year period
and watched The Crime
numbers go up
and not down
and this is only Bernal Leo, right?
We're only dealing with Bern Leo. I know
some questions were asked
before and we
put
a,
let's see.
So those, no matter what we
invest in money, we're still not
getting crime down. Right?
So changing the law
is not gonna make any difference
if the police aren't reporting
it or the our victims
aren't reporting it.
Um And
so if
the police are not
charging the victims and
these are people that we know
about, right? That
aren't, I don't know how many times
representing Armstrong's
yard has been broken into or damaged,
but they're not even calling
now. But if that's a
large number that could be 10
or 20 right? I just
had something gallop today at a
bank and
so we don't even
report that because it's not worth
our time, right? We gotta go
fix the glass and,
and
worry about the next
day. Do
we know what's not getting
reported? Do you have any
idea in Buro County
of what percentage is not getting
reported? >> Mr.
Chair, Senator
Munoz,
the data that we looked at
comes from the FBI
from NYS or
UCR, the
Bureau of Justice Statistics. Also
reports on the National Crime
Victimization Survey which
collects data on exactly what you're
looking at unreported
crimes. We have not
conducted an analysis of that
data, but we could follow
up with that
>> and you don't know what the FB I's
number of unreported crimes
was
>> the FBI doesn't, uh, report
on that. The N CV S
reports on self reported
victimization which
collects numbers on
unreported
crimes.
>> And then, you know, the mental
health or, or
refer to a federal court. That's
only 1%. Right. Competency
is 6% of the total cases.
Out of where
is that page?
Uh, 25,000
cases,
2% were dismissed
to incompetency
uh involving 294
individuals. But
they're the,
they're the largest
and most familiar faces
in the court system.
Correct? That's
on your page
23.
>> Uh Chair Senator
Munoz.
Uh >> first
paragraph,
individuals with four more
felonies are dismissed for this
reason.
>> I don't know if, yeah,
there is a term that they use
familiar faces in
these cases.
Um,
>> last sentence in the
paragraph,
>> I don't know if they are
necessarily,
well, I don't know is,
and we can follow up as if
they are like the most
repeat offenders.
But I know in cases
involving competency
that they are
essentially flagged
and kind of tracked
through separate data system because
of the
track their
uh compac
evaluations essentially. And
so that's how this is
calculated.
>> So, in this report, do
we have any charts that show
us the number of
people that were
taken in, saw a
psychiatrist to see if they were
competent? We, we have that
number.
I
>> uh Chair Senator Munoz,
we don't have
those specific.
What we do know is how
many the average
bed occupancy
for
um
those who were
evaluated
and ruled to be dangerous.
And so therefore sent
to um
Las Vegas
and that bed
Ocu you can
see, so there's about on an
average 66
beds for those who
were declared
dangerous
and so they can stay for nine
months.
>> But I I'm, I'm talking the
competence number,
right, because if we look at
that first
paragraph,
512 out
of 25,000%
were dismissed due
to incompetency
involving 294
individuals. And there's
only 90 beds in the
State
>> Chair Senator Munhoz.
Correct. And I think
to answer your or sorry and to
answer your question, what
we don't have is records or
data to indicate
other than those who are declared
dangerous. And since to lost
Vegas for those who are just
declared or ruled
to be incompetent in
court, what we don't know
is what services that
they obtained
after their case
was dismissed due to
incompetency.
And so that, that's the
information that we do
need.
>> And these are with only
with four more felonies. This
is not three felonies,
two felonies or one felony,
right? Did we look at
any of that, that data or any of
those numbers? Uh
>> Chair Senator Munoz,
we didn't look at those with
fewer felonies in this
particular analysis simply because
we were replicating
and updating the 2018
report
here
four or more. >> Yes, for
four more years from 2018
or 2020
2024
04, more
four or more f four or
more only >> made up
eight
>> percent.
Ok.
All right. Thank
you guys for the report. A lot of
questions. Just remember.
It's a synopsis of one county
with the highest crime rank
and no matter what amount of money we put
in there, crime goes
up
and our costs go up and,
and nothing's getting resolved.
So, thank you
guys
muscles
>> up. Can I introduce >> him?
Um Yeah, we're
ready.
>> So, um Mr.
Chairman, I want to introduce some
new staff that are here with
us. One, you just heard
from Marco who
is uh
um returning back
to New Mexico. He grew up in La la
Luz. He's got his
undergrad from UN M
and graduate degree uh from
University of
Miami. We
also have uh Drew
Weaver who's
another program, evaluator.
Uh He's finishing up his
um
masters in education policy
from John Hopkins and was a
school teacher in Santa Fe
public schools.
We also have
Maggie Clogg
who uh
finished up her master's
in public policy from U and M and
started with us this summer. You'll be
seeing her,
Sade Claiborne who's
got a undergraduate from Arizona
State and an MB A
from New Mexico
Highlands also has worked
with the State auditor's
office not
here today, but you'll see them in the
future as Josh
Josh Chafin
who has a master's from
Columbia University's done
international program evaluation
for the UN and other
uh NGO S
uh and Elizabeth Dodson
uh who just finished up
her um
master's in political Science
from uh
UN M as well.
So we're, these
are part of the new positions that you
authorize in the feed bill that
we've, we've filled
and we've got two more that
will be starting with one next
week and then another one
in late August.
>> Ok.
What's our vacancy rate?
Zero,
John Courtney, go
ahead.
What Tab >> Thank you,
Mr. Chairman. We'll be on Tab
C
and this will be the third
quarter, uh, quarterly
report cards.
Um
I'll try to hit on the, the
highlights for you all. It's a
rather lengthy
document. Um,
we won't go page
by page but um,
I'll try to try to let you all
know what, how, how the
state's doing overall and uh
what the changes have been,
uh from the second to the third
quarter. Um,
as a summary there, there weren't
really a lot of changes
for the second to the third quarter
making it likely that
the ratings you see in, uh
this quarter's report cards
are going to be um,
similar to, to the
uh quarter, four annual ratings
that you all will see likely in
September. Um,
however, a few uh,
programs did drop
from yellow into red to
territory. I'll
discuss two of these in more
detail. Um,
those are in the critical
areas of Child Protective
Services
and, uh,
um, the
medical Assistance division
at, um, HSD.
Now, uh, the
HC A.
Um,
so if you'll turn with
me to
pages,
uh, four and
five,
this just gives you an overview
of, of our, uh
A G A rating
categories, green, yellow, and
red. And then the
table on page five
shows you, um,
the ratings from
quarter, two to
quarter three,
and the arrows indicate
where we May have seen movement
uh downwards
or
upwards.
So in summary,
we've got 18
programs in the
green, 35 in the
yellow, green,
you know,
uh
meaning that those uh
agencies are, are meeting or
exceeding targets.
35 in the yellow, usually
assigned because an agency is,
is close to hitting a target
but not quite there. And then
eight in the red which sig
signals a program,
um, isn't performing
as, uh as intended
and is likely to meet their
performance targets.
So starting on
page uh
six
public education,
um, the, the
big news for public
education in the last quarter,
um, or recently, I
suppose is that,
uh pe D raised the unit
value representing another
$71 million increase
to public education,
bringing the unit value more in
line with the legislative fy
25 increase of
5.1%.
Uh There were concerns from
LFC staff that
since the unit value was raised
late in the year, districts
will not have planned for the
expenditure of those funds
potentially uh further
growing district school uh
fund balances which
now sit at over $650
million.
Um
Districts cite a
contributing factor to these
fund balances as being slow
reimbursement times from
PE D
on page
seven, you can see in that
first metric of the table
there. Um
Pe Ds still
not hitting their target
for average days to
process
reimbursements. Uh
That rating remains red
and uh
well below department
targets.
Um In the graph
at the bottom of page, the page
seven sidebar, you can see that
PE D is making strides
and hiring
personnel bringing
their vacancy rate down to
13%
which in theory
should help with those reimbursement
times. Uh Sonny Lou will be
digging deeper into
this in our Tuesday
meeting.
So from there, I'll ask you to turn
with me to page
11
on page 11. We're
looking at EC CD, the home
visiting program which
provides support and education
to families with uh
newborns,
uh and young
Children.
Um The
program,
um the home
visiting program continues to fall
short on enrollment targets,
potentially limiting the
impact. Um
We've done a lot
of uh
research on home visiting and
had a report last year
showing that um
you know, that this can be a very
impactful program
um uh
benefiting any everything
from immediate child welfare
outcomes to
um adult
outcomes. Uh The Nurse
family Partnership program, for
example, has been shown to,
to um
impact involvement with
both the uh public
health and criminal justice systems
later in life.
Um
From there, if you turn to
page
13,
the graph on the left, you can see
that childcare enrollment has been
increasing as a
factor of expanded
enrollment
um
both at cost which is in
that graph on the left and then page
13
on the left,
um We're nearing
uh the uh
30,000
child level for um
childcare.
Um However, if you
look at the red metric in the middle of
page 13, more
than half of enrolled families are
above uh 125%
of the poverty level
um missing the target
of 65%. Meaning
that many of the families being served and
receiving benefits from the program
are at the higher end of that
income spectrum. Uh
When the highest risk
in need is likely at the lower end
of that
spectrum.
If you'll turn with me
now to page 15
on page 15, we have CYF
D's report card
on the graph on the lower left hand
side of the page, you'll see that
repeat maltreatment within
a 12 month period
has been trending upwards
uh for several quarters and it
worsened again in
the third quarter, rising to
14.8%
of Children experiencing
a, a substantiated allegation
of maltreatment again,
uh, after having
one within 12 months.
Um, and you can see that
we are also, uh, far
above target and far
above
national levels
on that. Uh,
turning to page the
next page 16,
the ratings for
the Protective Services Program
are, are all yellow and red
with the overall program moving
from yellow to red in quarter
three.
Um,
so that, that program
continues to be a concern
and, and I know that the committees uh
doing work on this
through their uh recent
subcommittee's be meeting again
in September on
page 17, you'll see a slight
increase in the juvenile justice
population. The
agency cites an increase in the
number of youths charged with a violent
crime in Burnley Counties
as a potential cause. But
also of note there is that CYFD
has stopped using a validated
risk assessment tool
at intake for juvenile justice
as well.
Uh If you'll mov'e with me now to
page 19,
that's the health care authority
um
on page. Uh on
the following page, we have the, the
report card for the
medical assistance division.
Um No
Medicaid performance targets were
met in the first three quarters of fy
24.
And on the graph on page
19, you
can see that there was
a dip
in Medicaid enrollees at the end of
the calendar year with enrollment
moving uh under
900,000
um for the first time in a couple
of years. It's a dip
that the department didn't expect
as it came in about
12,000 people under the
projection this afternoon
when Eric talks to you about
behavioral health, um,
he'll have some new data showing
that enrollment is continuing
to fall. Uh,
if you turn to page
20.
So again, you'll see that no Medicaid
performance targets were mett in the
first three quarters
resulting in the program moving
from a, a yellow to a red
rating on page
21 for the income
support division. All
these metrics have been read for every
quarter this year with the
department continuing to have
difficulty meeting federally
required timeline
metrics for
um the snap
program.
So let's mov'e now to
page
25
where the Department of Health starts.
The department reported mixed
results across the agency
during the third quarter.
The Public Health program is meeting
targets on immunizing young
Children and training
on evidence based suicide
prevention but not faring
as well on metrics around
family planning,
cigarette cessation or
overdose
reversals
uh for the facilities
management
program
for the facilities management
program.
Um
Where was that
here?
We also see mixed performance.
I, I'd note that the two red metrics
at the top of page 27
representing facilities
uh continue continue
to operate well below
capacity and that includes
the turquoise lodge
facility in
Albuquerque.
On page 29
we have the aging and long term
services department
who reported some improvements in
performance in the third quarter,
the department's on track to
meet. Um
uh and actually outperform
fy 23 metrics
in all programs.
Um And the
aging network which has struggled
with hours of caregiver
support. Historically, uh
particularly since the pandemic
is likely to meet their fy 24
target.
Page
35
the tourism department
looks like a strong performers
are on track to meet or exceeded
most of their fy 24
targets. Uh The
exception to that is on
page 36 for the department
is off track to
meet their target for meetings
with tribes and pueblos.
Uh They cite the need
to um or a
vacancy there and they need to
rehire the position
responsible for those meetings
which they're working on.
Uh moving to page
37
Workforce Solutions
Department, uh
Labor force participation
rates continue to be uh
relatively low
compared to other states.
Uh We would need about
another 40,000
individuals working or look
looking for work to meet the national
average. You all have had
several legis at
hearings um
uh in relation to this
topic right now, New
Mexico is about 24,000
more jobs than people looking for
work. Uh
Page 38
pages 38 and
39.
These are report cards for
the employment Services
program.
Um And you
can see uh mixed
performance, although
many of the Workforce
Innovation and
Opportunity Act
programs or we O A programs
as, as we will refer
to them by acronym or green.
The number of participants have has
actually declined
and labor relation and
investigation on employment
insurance claims metrics
on page
39
um fell below
targets. A
December 23
court ruling requires the
Workforce Solutions Department to
meet new labor relations
claim processing standards.
This came up in agency hearings
during the Session and you all
provided um
additional staff for fy
25 for the
agency to, to address
that.
Moving to page 42
we start on our justice and
public safety agencies.
Um I'll try not
to repeat what,
what you all just heard in uh
uh Ryan's
presentation.
Um
dps made
good strides in several areas
and implementing pay increases
for State police
officers,
increasing the number of staff
for law enforcement standards and,
and Training Council
despite their efforts to reduce
vacancy rates, though the,
the rate actually rose to
12.9%
due to retirements and
separations.
Um dps is also
reporting uh
75% of law
enforcement agencies are now reporting
to the NIS system
covering 86% of the
population if you'll remember for
a number of years,
um uh
law enforcement agencies
were not reporting to Nibs
and, and we couldn't get a
statewide picture, I think for about
two years uh from
FBI crime data. So we're
over that threshold for
the State to be able to uh to
see those data. Again,
uh, page
46
brings us to the corrections
department on the
graph at the, the top of the
page. You can see that
after dropping for several years,
the prison population seems
to have, have hit a floor
there with the women's
population actually seeing a slight
increase. Uh, the
department's been able to reduce
vacancy rates recently,
although they're still above
target. On
page
49.
The first
metric in that table represents
our standard recidivism
calculation which
uh Ryan and Marco
referred to return to
prison within 36
months. Um
And this is above uh
this metric is now above
where we've been for the last two
years and above
target.
So page, if
you'll turn with me to page
50
courts and judicial
agencies, I think the highlight
here is on page
51
where you can see that the utilization,
a number of special of a number
of specialty courts has been trending
upwards. Um
Specialty courts have been
uh underutilized
uh compared to, to
their capacity going back
for a number of years that was exacerbated
by the pandemic
um
overall for, for
courts. Um
das and the
judiciary das
and the public defender are continuing to
report difficulties
in recruitment and
retention of attorneys
potentially impacting
um their uh their
vacancy
rates.
If you'll turn with me to page
54
this is where we start on our Natural
resources agencies.
54 is where we
have EMD uh
State forestry behind
untreated acreage largely because
of a late season
snowpack, administrative
backlog and um,
higher cost per acre
State parks who we're hearing from
this afternoon along
with oil conservation have
already reached annual targets
on a number of metrics.
Although you'll notice that O
CD is a little low
on uh, inspections of
oil and gas
facilities.
I'll take us to page
59. Now, the Environment
Department,
you'll notice that the Environment
Department is hitting many
of its targets
um, while hitting many
of its targets with program
ratings all yellow. Uh,
it's red on the
inspections programs
including surface
water, groundwater,
hazardous waste facilities and
radiation sources.
The department cites continued
staffing difficulties is a
contributing factor with their
vacancy rate. Um
This is despite
um uh
infusions from, from the
legislature, um
over the last few sessions
outpacing uh general
fund growth. Um
Their vacancy rate
increased from
20.9%
to 25.6%
in the third
quarter.
Uh moving to general government
agencies. So that'll take us
to page 62.
Uh The department's risk
program continues to see
large payouts, uh
which we've, we've talked
about um in
previous hearings
leading to lower reserves
in the public liability fund
and um 20 do
$20 million special
appropriation in the last
legislative Session.
Um There's a few
agencies that are responsible
for for most of these large
settlements including
UN M Health Sciences, the
Corrections Department and
Cyfd
on page
63
the Employee Group Health
Benefits Program. Um
This is moving or it did
mov'e to HC A as
of July 1st.
Um, but you can see,
uh towards the end of its tenure at
GS ad uh
performance and all, all the
red. Um,
unfortunately, and you'll,
you'll hear about a bar objection
on Wednesday, uh,
relating to GST
moving money to cover payments
to uh health benefits
vendors. Uh Joey
Simon will be presenting
that.
Let's mov'e to page
67 where
we have the State personnel
office.
Um They've
been prioritizing, reducing the
time it takes agencies
to fill vacancies on the
first metric on the table
there. You can see
that that metric is impro
improving slowly but surely
about 22 days
a quarter over the last
three quarters still on
average. It's taking just under
two months to fill
a State agency
position and the
tables on the bottom
uh left of
page 67
show you the range
of um
of agencies with uh
PA and the State auditor
taking a relatively short time
to fill positions at 19
days and the health
care authority taking a relatively
long time um
uh at uh over six
months
on page 60 si uh
69 sorry,
we have the Department of
Transportation,
uh 90 to 95%
of roads in far better
condition as seen in
the graph on page
70. Um
and half as many in poor condition
as in the target.
Um
I'd like to point
towards the
modal program starting on
page
7071.
Um This
includes measures related
to traffic fatalities.
Uh Those numbers
are lower than last year, but
they're still
above target
on page 72.
Um This
is where we start our report
cards for
um It
projects, I'd
highlight just a few for
you. Um The
HC A has
two projects, uh
high, high budget,
high priority projects in the red.
Right now, the child
support enforcement replacement
uh project and then the
uh Medicaid replacement
project uh which
is uh the cost of that has grown
to over 400 million.
Um CYF
D's um
uh protective
Services uh case
management system or
CWS project
uh uh
holds a rating
of, of yellow
still. Uh
And then on page 73
I'll point out that the higher
education department's longitudinal
data system um
that has moved into red
territory mostly
because of extension
of timelines.
Um uh We're
actually having a meeting
with them this morning. Some of
the folks back in the office
on data from, from
A ED. This is a really a
really big database that's
supposed to cover preschool all the
way through the workforce.
Um Right now, we seem
to be having trouble
uh data and pulling,
pulling data from that
system.
Um
Finally, on page
84.
So subs subsequently, we have
more information on each of those
it projects if you all wanna
want to uh dig any
deeper to any one of
them. Page
84 we come to
investments.
Um The value of New
Mexico's combined investment
holdings grew by
3.6 billion
uh for the quarter with an ending balance
of 81.15
billion. And then
um uh there's
a metric there over the
last five years.
Uh The state's combined investment
holdings have grown by almost
30 billion or, or
58%.
Um
madam Chair with
that
uh that concludes
our quarter three report
cards. And again, we'll,
we'll have quarter four ready
for you probably in
September with those uh
year end totals
um from the A
G metrics.
>> Thank you, John. All right. Any
questions from the Committee so far? I
have just one
representative
Chatfield.
I don't mean one question
>> back to page
63.
Uh
This fund
has been
upside down. We've been
told what was gonna be done
about it that we
gradually and now it
goes to a different agency,
a different agency's
budget.
Uh How
is that gonna change
things?
>> Um Mr. Chairman, I,
you know,
I,
the optimistic
side of me, uh
hopes that uh with,
with the new management, they, they'll have a
fresh start and
um and
uh address some of the, the
longstanding problems that,
that uh we've
discussed in Committee. But
you're, you're exactly right that
this has been AAA
problematic
program going back.
Uh a good while
now.
>> So madam Chair
I it's, it is
frustrating
to us as
legislators
when you go through
Secretary after
Secretary that just
then pretty quickly, they were like,
I didn't create the problem.
Some, somebody has
to kind of
stand up and face the music.
We've seen that with
the, well,
we'll get into how many departments,
one of them had seven
secretaries since I've
been elected
within all that long.
Uh I just hope that
uh uh
the plan is
the plan to
increase the
benefit
um
to increase the
cost to the
recipients still
in place. Is that still the
plan? Uh
are we
going to make this program pay
for itself,
madam Chair,
>> uh madam
Chair, Representative
Chatfield. I believe there there
is a that plan for
a 10% increase to go
into place or actually it
did go into place.
Uh July 1st
for Fy 25.
I um talking to
our analyst on um
for GST Joey
Simon. I think there's still
some concern whether or not
that um increase
is adequate to
cover the cost.
>> Madam Chair, we
know that increase does
not cover the cost,
it takes 10%
plus 25%.
We figured that out y'all
figured it out last year.
Uh So
what is the
plan?
>> We will be able to hear more of that,
Mr. Chairman Representative
Chatfield on Wednesday when
we're talking about the
bar that I objected to at the end
of the year, um that
would continue
to allow them to sp overspend
that fund.
Um And the new
Secretary hopefully will be
able to uh zoom in
to be able to
help discuss on a
go forward basis. What we do.
>> So madam Chair,
uh we'll
be talking to the
Secretary who
will no longer be in charge
of this program. It
my frustration.
>> We are
planning on getting the new
Secretary uh for the health
care authority to also attend.
I think she's gonna have to zoom in
but she will be on as
well.
>> Thank you. Thank you madam Chair
for allowing me to
complain a little
bit.
>> Thank you, representative
um Representative
Garcia, Harry
Garcia.
>> Uh Thank you madam Chair. Just
to touch up on what the
rev chapel said.
Come Wednesday, we're gonna hear the
same story. Uh
It wasn't my fault, it was
the secretary's fault, you know, and
that is really frustrating
to hear it. You know, I'm
not gonna be here next time around
because I I'm not gonna be here.
But as
far as these people are concerned
that are gonna be here, it's
the same song and dance
all the time. You
know, I'm gonna point the
finger, I'm not gonna point the
finger at John. I'm gonna point the
finger at Charles now because
he's gone and you're here and
that, that is really frustrating
to sit here every day
and listen to the same story
song and dance. So
what, what is the plan?
You know, we gonna blame the this
Secretary, blame the last one and the
last 11, you
know, and it's, it's just ridiculous
anymore. It really
is >> Mr.
Chairman Representative Garcia.
Um our, our analyst
Joy Simon had
had uh uh
two pieces of, of
things that you wanted to pass
along. Um
One of those being that
um uh
this 10%
rate increase for 25 we had
also had a 10% rate
increase for, for
24. Um
But the second is that,
uh there's, I believe
some, some
hope from the
HC A that
um they can
potentially use their purchasing
power, particularly through
Medicaid. Uh looking
at benefit fits and savings
uh in the plan and,
and leverage that
um to, to help bring
costs down. So that
that May be something to
um to discuss
on, on Wednesday.
Um As director
Salis said, hopefully we'll
have the HC A Secretary here for
that
>> uh madam Chair.
Thank you that, you know, it's a big
hope, you know,
but we hope every time
it happens that the new Secretary
comes in, we hope that
he's gonna be better than the last one.
But at the end of the day, it's
not happening, you
know, and it doesn't
matter what, what
do you say, madam Secretary
madam Chair, it's not the
amount of money is the quality
with that. We need not
the, the funding got
nothing to do it. The, the quality
of uh leadership
that's there is not
working, it's just not
working and we
keep on putting more into it
and more into it. And
at the end of the day, uh,
we wind up with the same thing
that just a comment. Thank you madam
Chair. >> Thank you
representative. I
don't have anyone.
Oh, you have questions? Ok.
There's two great questions. Thank
you. Uh, and we've got,
uh, Senator Pat Woods and then
we've got Representative
Lujan.
>> Thank you madam Chair. Uh,
on page
62
where we're talking about the
other risk management
funds.
And down
here on the one it
says, uh, position
of the public liability
fund, it
seems in 22
we were at 66%
23
42%
and it goes to
8%.
Am I,
is that
meaning madam
Chair? Does that mean
that
right?
The liability of that fund?
That's, that's
explain the 8%
to me, I
guess is what I'm
asking. >> Sure.
Um, Mr. Chair,
um, Senator
Woods, the,
we actually had a,
um, a program
evaluation on, on
the risk management fund. I, I believe
it was last year. Um,
but essentially what's been happening
is, is,
um, uh,
higher
dollar settlements
and, and more settlements
have, uh,
depleted that resource
over the last few
years
>> evidently,
but
have we made any headway
about raising
premiums to
agencies
to take care of this problem?
I mean, we,
I don't know all the agencies
but you've listed
123456
or five. And then you say
other agencies.
So we know
what agencies
are,
have
some of the highest risk,
some of the
highest
it, it goes back to
risk management, to the
actuary tables to,
to determine how much
premium it
takes
again.
Why,
why do we find ourselves in
this position? Are they just
more settlements
coming at one time?
Is that what our problem
is?
We, we, we were having
more settlements
coming in
at one time than we were
expecting. I mean,
we had a pretty good idea,
didn't we of, of what it
was going to cost to settle these
or not? >> Mr.
Chairman Senator
Woods?
Um
I believe
that
the settlements have
gone up at
such a pace
that um rates
haven't kept
up to
basically
um keep
the, keep the fund at that level
where it once
was.
>> So we literally have no
caps on these settlements
at all. Mr.
Chair,
we just John, we just have
no, we have no
caps. We can't,
we can't even get a good
guess of worthy's
settlement. You're gonna
be
>> uh Mr. Chairman
Senator Woods,
the
um, if I'm
remembering correctly, going back to
that risk evaluation,
uh we did have some
recommendations around
how to potentially bring those
costs uh
down a bit
um that
included taking some
uh different pathways
uh towards settlement including
uh um
arbitration. And
I believe there is a, a recommendation
in there um to, to
look at caps
um as
uh which has been done
at other, other states.
So there have been more
settlements, the
um and the rates are
made through a three year rolling
average. So some of
those big payments don't
catch up to the premiums
right
away.
>> Ok. I'm, I'm beating the
horse here. I
know.
Um,
so
there is
a possibility of
statutes
to try to put caps
on these.
Is that right? Is that
what I'm hearing? Other
states do
cap some of these
claims,
>> Mr. Chairman. I, I believe
so. I'll try to look up exactly
what that, what that recommendation
was from the, from
that report.
>> Well, I know this is
way out there but
could we possibly think
about writing
a bill to,
to cap some of these
rates and then
requiring the State
to look for
reinsurance
to,
to
limit our
liability
somewhat instead of just
having all this liability
on the State,
>> Mr. Chairman. So, so
to clarify, uh
Mr. Chairman and, and Senator
Woods, we, we do
have caps for State tort
claims but not for federal
claims. And I'm told that's,
that's where a lot of the those big
dollar settlements are coming
from.
>> Ok. Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Senator. We've
got Representative
Sarinana and then we've got
Representative
Luhan,
>> thank you madam Chair.
Um just real quick on
page 59 and 60
John. So
it looks like um, inspections
aren't doing well on anything
surface water, groundwater,
um hazardous waste
facility inspected.
Um Some of them say they don't have
enough funding for people.
Are, are we looking at that
at all?
>> Representative, we increased their funding.
But the Environment Department
100 and 80
some percent
in the vacancies and the FTEs
and, and remember the claim
that the
FTEs were making that they
were underpaid and there were
shortages and I don't
know what his vacancy rate is today.
Right? But I think
he's had the time to, to
build those up. He has the
money to, I
just don't know if he's built those
up a staff up.
>> And then Mr. Chairman Representative,
that, that's the, that's part
of the um
uh
issues that, that the environment
department. Uh
um I believe
they have their vacancy rate
in quarter three went up by
another 5%
to about 25
26% now.
>> All right, Mr. Chairman madam
Chair. So
percent of hazardous waste
facilities is inspected, hazardous
waste facilities.
1.1%.
There's got to be something we can do,
contract out or something
to help him because
these are important
areas that are
hazardous. So,
I don't know. There's got to be something
you guys have the brains there. What can
we do,
>> madam, Chair Representative
Seinan. I'm, I'm looking at
our uh natural
Resources analyst, uh
Austin Davidson. And
um we just had some
uh nonverbal language
where we're gonna, I'll have him follow
up with the, with the department to ask
that very question. I don't know if he had
anything to add on
that.
>> I think one of the key things
madam Chair representative
that is stopping the
agency from
kind of fulfilling these program
measures is that they
don't have the ability to have the
same retention and
hiring for these positions.
They're really complex positions
and they're not as competitive in the
public sector versus the private
sector. So that's something the agency
is trying to work with and
that's what that advanced placement,
but it is gonna take a lot of
time relative
to trying to fix these performance
measures.
>> Where do you
know where these areas
that this, that
this waste hazardous waste
is located
where, where it's not being
inspected.
>> Madam Chair representative, I
do not have that information, but I
can certainly get that to >> you.
Thank >> you. Thank
you.
All righty. Thank you very much
for that. We've got one more and that's
Representative Lujan and then we're going to
break for lunch.
I don't have anyone else on the
list. Representative
Lujan. Thank you madam >> Chair. Just a
couple of quick questions.
Um Looking at
um workforce
solutions uh
page in the
we oa
let me go back to I guess page
41. The number of
enrolled participants in
Woa training programs
is for this
quarter down. It,
it's been going down for the
last two
quarters and, but
cumulatively,
um I guess
they're like halfway at the their
targeted goal
for the end of the year. But
with that with seeing these measures,
do, do they anticipate meeting
those, those goals,
madam Chair
>> uh madam Chair
Representative Lujan, I believe they
do anticipate that,
that that's uh according
quarterly me measures.
So it's cumulative.
It um it May be that
their target is, is just set
a bit low and
um analysts are actually in, in the
process of, of
reviewing um
uh performance metrics. Now, that
might be so something that we
suggested, Justin.
>> Thank you. And then my last thank
you for that. Um
I was just wondering that because those numbers
are going down. And can you
remind me how much, what
with the, why did they ask
for supplemental
budget monies or match monies
or anything like that madam
Chair
>> uh madam Chair
Representative
Lujan, I
don't recall
that
um
from, from the
agency. No, I I know
that, you know, and here we talk
about some, some previous special
appropriations like the B prob
Be Proud
Bus which um
uh has been, has
started to be utilized and we've
got some, some numbers on that
on the, the first
page of workforce solutions.
>> Thank you madam Chair and have
they uh workforce solutions
have they asked for in marketing and
promotion dollars
so they can promote like new
programs that they're gonna be
developing. That I've
been hearing about
like bringing back,
you know, our students
that are
our youngest generations that go away
and they want to come back to New Mexico
manager
>> madam Chair, Representative
Lujan. I, I don't
know off the top of my head but, but I
can follow up with
our analysts and, and see if, if
there are any targets specifically
for that purpose. >> That's all I
got. Thank you madam Chair. I appreciate
that. >> Thank
you very much. All righty, I
think we are done
for now. So we're
going to take a break for lunch now and
I understand it's right here out
these exit doors.
Um, I don't know. In the hallway.
Charles. Thank you. All righty.
