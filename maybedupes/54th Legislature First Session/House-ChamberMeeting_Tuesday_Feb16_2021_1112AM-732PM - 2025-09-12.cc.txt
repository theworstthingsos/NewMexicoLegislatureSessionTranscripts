Action necessary for placing
House strongly sorry House
Judiciary Committee substitute
for House before.
As it has been generated to
explain the bill.
Thank you Mr speaker House Bill
for the New Mexico Civil Rights
Act started with the New Mexico
Civil Rights Commission that was
tasked to look at this issue and
spent a great deal of the last
year working to achieve the
recommendations that are now
part of this bill this bill is
in poor and it ensures that
every New Mexican regardless of
their race or background if
they've had their civil rights
violated deserves their day in
court New Mexico's constitution
with and its bill of rights
guarantees every New Mexicans
fair and equal treatment under
the law yet right now if a New
Mexican has had their rights
violated by a government actor
they cannot get that day in
court she's always with her.
When you say
In New Mexico and has had their
rights violated their only
Avenue for justice is through
the federal court system that
doesn't make sense and the road
to justice must be shorter.
We've heard plenty of
Planning from the opponents that
focus only on red herring
argument the need for this
historic legislation is not
about the dollars and cents Mr
speaker it's about those New
Mexicans who have have been
rights or their loved ones
rights taken away with no Avenue
of accountability or justice
open to them.
Like David versus Goliath every
day New Mexicans with tragic
stories must confront powerful
government actors with little to
no chance at achieving that just
as a so desperately need for
closure stories like Sylvia
Marquez.
Ages and of nine year old or
more ever Ellen was horrible
death is tied directly to
government actors who failed to
take full Mari's fight
seriously.
It takes amazing courage for
these brave New Mexicans to come
forward with their stories and
they deserve justice.
They deserve the New Mexico
Civil Rights Act.
Unfortunately right now too many
people don't feel a sense of
trust in the government we are
going to prepare the trust
between government agencies and
the communities they serve we
need to find avenues for
accountability.
Mr speaker high what we did come
up with a committee substitute
and House Judiciary.
The bill here on the floor today
strikes a balance between the
many valid concerns a coworkers
while staying true to the built
in pants.
House Bill for House Judiciary
Committee substitutes insurance
as follows.
No individual state employee law
enforcement officer or teacher
can be sued.
The New Mexico Civil Rights Act
will be limited to enforcing the
New Mexico bill of rights.
This is a David and Goliath
situation and levels the playing
field and focus focusing the
bill ensures that New Mexicans
have equality and freedom.
A cap on damages at two million
holding entities accountable
while ensuring that their
financial security.
Legislative judicial and other
roommate immunities remain.
The New Mexico Civil Rights Act
is not available for an
employment claims which are
already covered under the Human
Rights Act the whistleblower
protection act and the E. O. C..
The New Mexico Civil Rights Act.
Works in conjunction with and
doesn't change or recreate
existing statutes limitations.
Mr speaker I do have a floors
amendments.
On the floor amendments Mister
speaker I'd like to move that
House for amendment number one
to House Judiciary Committee
substitute for House Bill for
thank you please confirm the
tier two number on the
amendment.
Zero point three.
please confirm the to run a
minute.
Yes it is point two one nine
eight eight zero point three
okay generally it has been stand
as good as one second to get up
on the website thank you Mr
speaker I wanted gentlelady to
explain the amendment.
The New Mexico Civil Rights Act
by design protects the law based
immunities afforded to
government actors while
remaining the defense of
qualified immunity which went
use ours New Mexicans from
receiving the justice they
deserve this floor amendment is
a technical change to the bill
confirming that qualified
immunity is the only immunity
impacted by this piece of
legislation.
In.
Is your objection to it.
House number one to House
Judiciary Committee searching
for House before's adopted.
I generated million you still
have the floor if you wish for
the comments before we go to
debate.
Thank you Mr speaker I'm ready
to stand for questions.
First we have the gentleman from
Representative small.
Thank you very much Mr speaker
the and gentle lady from
Bernalillo would you yield.
Mister speaker I yield to the
gentleman from Dona Ana County.
Thank you thank you very much
Mister speaker thank you to and
the lady
this is obviously a very
important piece of legislation
Mr speaker gentle lady you went
through it in some of your
opening but I just want to ask a
couple questions.
Mr speaker gentle lady you noted
a number of changes and
can I just ask briefly Mr
speaker gentle lady first the
legislation as we have it on the
floor today this legislation
will not I repeat will not allow
individual state employees
are first responders are law
enforcement officers or teachers
in the classroom to be sued
is that correct Mr speaker and
gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct.
Right Mr speaker gentlelady
that's so important and we you
know I think we'll go through a
few of of the incredible twenty
four rights that are included in
our New Mexico constitution and
we obviously want to make sure
that those rights are afforded
to New Mexicans but we also want
to make sure that these very
important workers whether they
are police officers teachers or
others that that they can be
safe in doing those individual
duties second Mr speaker and
gentle lady you talked about
this kind of right at the and
what I thought I heard Mr
speaker gentle lady is that you
have included a cap on damages
is that correct Mr speaker
gentle lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
correct it's a two million
dollar cap excellent that that's
great to hear Mr speaker gentle
lady you know I recall serving
on the Los crucis city council
and
it seems like one of the one of
the then of the beneficial
pieces of including this cap is
that from an insurance
perspective there's just no a
much higher degree of certainty
now or from the other
perspective no one can imply
that there's not certainty on
that cap so do you think Mr
speaker and gentle lady this
will help from that insurance
perspective across our state.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen I do think that's
true what as you know that was
included in the initial bill and
due to the concerns from local
governments and municipalities
about
having something tied to
insurance this was one of the
compromises we made to ensure
that then insurance could be at
a reasonable cost
Excellent thank you Mr speaker
and thank you gentle lady and I
just really appreciate you all
including this and then so Mr
speaker gentle lady
you also said that the this is
the New Mexico Civil Rights Act
applies specifically to the New
Mexico bill of rights the the
twenty four rights that are
included in our New Mexico
constitution correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct.
Okay that's wonderful and so we
we have that clears Mexico
and there may be I'm sure maybe
other many other questions but
the
The New Mexico bill of rights is
actually pretty incredible would
you agree Mr speaker and gentle
lady.
Mr speaker and gentlemen I do
agree.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady
that these rights are are
currently pretty hard for a New
Mexico residents to seek to and
enforce those rights can we do
that in state court right now Mr
speaker and gentle lady.
And let me confirm with my
expert witness I I believe
that's correct but I just want
to confirm.
And gentlemen right now to
answer your question generally
what can occur is only
injunctive relief.
And declaratory judgment but no
damages understood Mr.
No the firm manages and for one
second we want to identify
your for witnesses if you would
please.
Thank you Mr speaker yes we have
wearing Sanders.
And mark Baker.
And I believe.
Former Justice Boston as well.
Thank you please proceed thank
you.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady and compensating New
Mexicans whose rights have been
violated is certainly seems like
an appropriate thing especially
for those New Mexicans you know
they have had their if they've
had their rights violated and
that is one of the few ways to
help make them all Mr speaker
gentle lady thank you for
talking me through
the features of your legislation
again insuring that these
individual employees whether
they be law enforcement officers
teachers or others cannot be
sued under your bill under the
New Mexico Civil Rights Act
thank you for talking me through
the cap on damages which will
insure access to insurance and
other necessary opportunities
for all of our various
municipalities and so Mr speaker
generally those are all my
questions I would just say that
when we look at our bill of
rights these twenty four of
rights that cover everything
from the victim's rights to the
right to bear arms that insurer
Non discrimination based upon
sex these are extraordinary
rights granted to New Mexicans
and your well thought out
legislation that I think is
maybe the necessary compromises
struck the necessary balances.
In service of making sure The
New Mexicans can actually
access these rights begin to
enjoy these rights even more
than we do now really convinces
me that it's actually a
privilege to get to support this
legislation today and I really
appreciate you taking the time
thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady thank.
Thank you
Jennifer Chavis representatives
in Lincoln Representative never.
Generated from granted this year
Representative Dow.
Thank thank you Mr speaker will
the gentle lady we feel.
Mister speaker I yield to the
gentlelady from Grand Hotel go
and Sierra.
Okay thank you Mr speaker thank
you gentle lady I'm.
You mentioned in your opening
comments.
That people don't trust
government can you clarify that
comment and explain it further
and it is the right committee
discussed the SunTrust.
Mr speaker and gentle lady yes I
mean I think we've seen and and
and.
For a long time unfortunately
because folks are often treated
differently based on their color
I think a lot of parents have
had conversations with their
children about what happens when
they were approached by certain
government actors or even in the
classrooms about how to react
because.
People are not secure and
ensuring that.
Themselves or their children
will be treated equally.
And and thank you Mr speaker and
thank you representative.
What what what role did the
Civil Rights Committee play in
shaping this legislation or what
you think of based thank you the
Part of the bill.
Thank you Representative thank
you Mr speaker let me get a
brief description that with
adequate adequately address that
so if you would give me one
moment please.
the gentle lady so the bill that
was initially drafted was.
Was on the attributes with then
the Civil Rights Act so.
This was tracking the
recommendations of the majority
of the commission the committee
substantive however.
Addresses the concerns later
brought to after the hearings
in state government and
judiciary a lot of the
conversation just I understand
that was held by the commission
was holding government actors
accountable for misconduct servo
that have been a focus of the
commission.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and thank you for calling from
Bernalillo you also mentioned in
your opening comments that you
heard the news of the number of
red herring in responsibility
can you explain to me what a
right very is and specifically
which arguments you believe that
in that period.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady so a lot of
fancy you know we addressed in
the first committee and I think
I even opened up my discussion
in the first committee as the
sky is falling which was what a
lot of the opponents of the bill
we're saying saying that there
was no way that they would be
able to get insurance coverage
that they would go bankrupt that
they would not be able to hire
or maintain government employees
and that's not true I mean I
think we've seen stronger bills
most recently in Colorado where
they do hold individual actors
accountable where we have a
government entities there of
being able to
Maintain and obtain obtain
obtain insurance so these things
were just you know brought kind
as guys following arguments.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and thank you Representative
from Bernalillo I'm not an
expert on insurance but I what I
understand about how insurers
develop premiums is to date is
that exposure and experience so
exposure the potential cost of
certain types of losses
experiences the actual loss.
So how do we keep telling people
that that's not possible and
that there's not costs for that
there's not a risk for.
For loss of insurance coverage
if there is experience or
exposure what what is the
insurance that we have that that
happened.
thank you Mister speaker and
Representative Dow I thank
representative Armstrong Debbie
Armstrong stated it clearly and
Judiciary you know if if no one
civil rights are violated then
the cost is zero I can give you
more information about the
ensure hands ICO am not in an
expert on insurance the you know
in the process of
Preparing to draft the bill and
in addition to drafting the
amendments that are included in
the committee sensitive I know
we did talk with folks that
we're more experience but if you
will hang on I will get you some
more information about the
instrument.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
Representative actually at the
insurance agency if you
currently have Syrians and this
is from federal cases as similar
claims can be brought under the
federal Civil Rights Act the
federal Civil Rights Act
does not have any cap and also
it includes unitive damages so
what we're proposing here of
course has a cap and doesn't
include punitive damages
also the use of strong risk
management by the government
entities and drive down
insurance costs again if folks
don't have Thursday will rights
violated then there's not going
to be any costs and that's part
of you know managing that risk
management.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
Representative for that and so
that the claim that have the
ability to see you.
HB four as amended to litigate
constitutional rights guaranteed
under the got the Martinez
losses.
Mr speaker and representative
give me one minute I believe
this is one of the things that
we address but I want to give a
more detailed explanation of
that because it is one of the
things that we address based on
some of the concerns that
teachers.
Thank you Mr speaker and general
one gentle lady excuse me so
That's correct
there can't be litigation rights
and the Yazzie Martinez lawsuit
Yazzie was not about constant
excuse me Johnson was about
constitutional provisions not in
the bill of rights.
Thank you thank you for the
clarification Mr speaker and
gentle lady
So our schools could still face.
But not.
Staff individually.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
staff it only cannot be faced
with a claim however if let's
say a student civil rights were
violated and that would be
subject to this bill.
Thank you Mr speaker the lady is
access to equitable education.
A civil rights.
Mr speaker and Representative.
Access to education is a
constitutional right.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and gentle lady and to receive
less than equitable services
based on a disability age gender
race orientation would that be a
civil.
Violation under the fact.
Mr speaker and generating no
that would not be in the bill of
rights it's not a civil right.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you can we do I'm ask a
question about our
municipalities what happened the
first time that a jury awards
the cap.
A total of fifty four minutes
apologies budgets are lower than
the cap.
In the bill as amended.
Mr speaker and gentlemen I
believe that's with an insurance
with COVID.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady so.
Propose what we're proposing is
that human error human nature
will again with the passage of
this bill there for several
claim will not come in a cap
will not be awarded therefore
I mean it's probably doesn't
need to worry about bankruptcy.
Or or claim causing an increase
in experience or exposure in the
future.
I'm sorry what Representative
Mister speaker what is your
question.
When an incident occurs because
it's human nature.
It's human error.
And and and maybe even egregious
egregious one by a bad actor
that we were calling about
actors now the guilt or the
assumption of neglect now goes
to the government actors not the
individual.
And so the and explain.
Is at the cap allowed in this
bill as amended.
Which exceeds the operating
budget as many of our mentality
they will receive an insurance
claim Is Your proposing and
it'll be paid out.
The insurance premium will go up
or they will be uninsurable
that's what happened.
So what do you believe will
happen moving forward as the
hard for mac when we have fifty
four municipalities of budgets
lowered the cap is there a point
when they will be uninsurable.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you representative first I just
want to disappear.
The statement that a violation
of civil rights is not human
error
it is actual.
You know better than that
but let me consult with my
experts regarding the insurance
and and that issue.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you representative so
Again this is or any faced with
the uncapped liability and
federal court so do not miss the
policies already faces currently
what this bill would do it was
actually limits the liability in
ways that are not already
limited and federal court it's
also my understanding that
municipalities pool their risk
so it's not just limited to one
and also covered by reinsurance
beyond their access coverage so
how this was explained to me is
that where you have individuals
that are involved in an
automobile accident that perhaps
is you know fifty thousand
dollars that.
Insurance is not going to cost
them fifty thousand dollars it
is going to incrementally
increase but it's not going to
be at that level of fifty
thousand dollars.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and thank you gentlelady from
early and are all settlements
and judgments paid from
insurance how are different ways
of settlements and judgments can
be paid thank you for calling.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I I'm
I'm not quite certain I don't
want to give an incorrect answer
so let me consult with my thank
you.
Mr speaker and only they can pay
using insurance have their
budgets or combination of both.
Thank thank you Mr speaker and
thank you gentlelady forgetting
that clarification because I I
remember some Madam in my
district and I remember them
coming from the community budget
and.
This is.
Bill.
Could this result in tax
increases.
And as an answer to that
question is been a request for
folks through their jackets that
is just fine some of like to
please feel free.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady so it's a
possibility but because the the
two million dollar cap is there
it's highly unlikely what this
allows for however if that a
local jury found that there was
enough bad enough conduct that
they were then would you they
would then justify a substantial
enough verdict to require it
here again I I want to emphasize
that it's a local jury as
opposed to having a smaller
government go before a jury in
Albuquerque or Los crucis.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
and thank you representative I'm
I'm thinking about NET my
perspective is different in a
rural area are you know one
clean entered home.
You and.
And and close the nursing home
that happened in my state and my
guest in my area
one claim.
On a health issue are we saw
hundred seventy four percent
increase in insurance premiums
on I'm trying to process this
I'm just trying to imagine where
these fifty four municipalities
where the cap is greater than
their operating budget.
And if they needed to do a
combination of insurance and pay
out from the general operating
budget what services that they
would cut in order to make room
for the cost of of a claim.
And have any of the methodology
suggested what type of programs
they I'm assuming you can't cut
essential services from thinking
about.
The struggling senior meal sites
in my community.
Have I communities that don't
even optimistic violence
shelters but use some budgeting
to provide transportation to and
from fees for there are shelters
homeless shelters and.
If anybody can suggest where
they might cut from their.
I don't know it's not essential
that we're Representative from.
If there's a cap appointments
larger than their operating
budget.
Maybe it's something really
great to.
And there's multiple clean and
and they received multiple
Madam.
Just transition with the public
I.
Mr speaker representative I I
don't think that we have to even
get to that point unless we're
seeing and acknowledging right
now that there are current civil
rights violations occurring and
no one is doing anything about
that.
Thank you thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
representative is this
retroactive County can someone
through a fast pass incident and
how on to make a.
Mr speaker and representative I
believe this is not retroactive.
Thank you Mr speaker and how
does this bill interact with the
body can legislation from last
year special session.
More specifically.
Now that one person can expect
to be subject to suit for up to
every three years and current.
Ari forcing law enforcement to
store footage.
How long do they have to start
but if you haven't is.
Mr speaker and representative
that's not my bill we're not
changing any provisions of what
we enacted in that bill so
that's not applicable here.
So the it couldn't be paired if
if there's something in that
bill.
That.
Okay.
The current Representative we
debated that bill when it was
passed this is not affecting any
provisions of that bill.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you to the lady I do understand
that I'm just wondering how it
would be pickup that would
interact.
You see them interacting in
line.
Mr speaker and and gentle lady
again you know I I I'd have to
pull up that bill to be able to
speak about it I you know would
want to talk to the experts that
help us that bill but again
we're not changing any
provisions of that bill right
now we're talking about the New
Mexico Civil Rights Act.
Thank you thank you Mr speaker
thank you ladies and why why the
park out significant protection
for legislators and members of
the judiciary but rejected
limited liability for law
enforcement officers.
Mr speaker and gentle lady so
what we're doing here is
eliminating qualified immunity
so this is not actual statutory
law what we are doing to protect
what's included for
legislature's provided our and
the judiciary is something that
has already been included and
statutory law.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
can only do that this bill is
designed to hold agencies
accountable could you please
explain how this bill will hold
agencies accountable.
Mr speaker and gentle lady you
know unfortunately a lot of
times.
What.
People really where people
really feel pain unfortunately
is when it hits their
pocketbook.
And right now we're hearing
about civil rights claims or red
flags that could potentially
lead to civil rights for civil
rights claims excuse me and.
The government entities that are
hearing this I should say to see
what's happening there and and
now maybe because it's tied to
some monetary dollars that could
be addressed in the future folks
will pay more attention to it
but it's time that we you know
stop treating people differently
based on their background or the
color of their skin is this
something that we have to do it
again unfortunately sometimes
dollars speak louder and the
cries that people are asking for
in trying to help address some
of these issues you.
Thank thank you Mr speaker thank
you.
Infection to you to provide
public body to include advisory
board that receive public
funding.
Does this bill to find the
source of the public funding I
don't I don't see that it does.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I'm
sure that's included in a
different definition but let me
just confirm that thank you.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you representative.
I'm glad I did confirm with my
witnesses because that is not
included
Or reference to another part of
the law.
my understanding is that these
are by local state county or
municipal governments and so
whenever money is given to an
advisory board and they have to
comply.
Thank thank you Mr speaker
internally so just to make sure
a nonprofit or anybody with an
advisory board outside of an
apology that receive comment
really.
Or anybody that receive COVID
funds that would be public
public funds at this does not
allow them to be sued under the
New Mexico Civil Rights Act.
Mr for her nonprofit to pay
attorney fees.
Mr speaker and gentle lady
nonprofits are not government
entities.
Thank you Mr thank you ladies
for that clarification
all right thank you Mr speaker.
Thank you generate.
I thank the gentleman from
Chavis in Lincoln Representative
night for.
Thank you Mr speaker is by audio
working now.
Thank you record.
Thank you Mr speaker will
gentlelady from Bernalillo
county yield.
Thank you Mr speaker I view
yield to the gentleman from
Travis and we can.
thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady
I still have some concerns
regarding this bill and the.
Couple things that I've
discovered since our opportunity
to review this and committee.
The statement Mister speaker
gentle lady that the the purpose
of this was to address an issue
that people could drive Thursday
in court.
Yep it seems that the tort
claims that that was passed many
years ago.
Has allow.
Parties who have been injured.
By state.
Actors to.
Actually.
Percent of those claims and to
recover significant judgments
against the state although those
claims and the recovery is
limited to.
One million dollars under the
tort claims act so I'd like to
talk a little bit about why.
We need to this statute.
And why we did not just simply a
member tort claims.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentlemen.
The current thank you gentlemen
so
Right now it is incorrect
that any right.
Our state constitutional
violation applies in port claims
act
except against law enforcement
and it is in regard to injury or
property however even that is
arguable right now there's a
current case where
municipalities are saying that
even the tort claims act doesn't
apply in those cases.
Mr speaker and gentle lady we
could have a member of the tort
claims act to accomplish the
same goal complete off.
Mr speaker and gentlemen
we would.
I I I we would want though to
address the state constitutional
violations what we have
addressed in the bill of rights
and
That was the recommendation from
the New Mexico Civil Rights.
Well that may be the
recommendations of the the real
effect on this under the
existing statutory framework we
chose a different statutory
framework I suspect to do a
couple I number one two.
Provider rate or limit and also
provide.
The different thanks to the
limitations of procedures we've
been up to a
I recall.
The then I.
I think it's ninety days of the
current and this legislation.
By for a three year federal
limitations and I would even
argue it's not precisely clear
this legislation that the
statute of limitations is easily
understood.
So what's work at the statue
limitations provision food to.
Tell me exactly where
From the date of the occurrence
of the event the statute of
limitations would run in this
legislation.
Thank you and thank you
representative gentleman excuse
me a first I just want to go
back to because there.
This is the system that is
currently existing under federal
law so with federal law you have
federal towards claims and you
also have of federal Civil
Rights Act so
you know there are plenty of
things that we can do but again
what we did was limited to the
recommendations by the
commission as well as addressing
the
The concerns that were brought
up during this session.
And I will get.
With my experts to talk about
the time line of the statute.
Thank you Mr speaker thank the
gentle lady.
Is that you.
Thank you representative so
generally the statute of
limitations.
begins at the time of the
conduct and then would.
And.
Be limited to three years
however some constitutional
right violations don't arrive
until after.
Some time as in the case of a
malicious prosecution where you
have to burns get a positive
outcome in another case and then
that statute of limitation time
with and start.
So Mr speaker and gentle lady
looking at section seven of the
bill.
We we talk a little bit about
this and committee more more
real hang up is the language
that we use.
And looking at the
Winds channel love and.
On page five.
It says the basically the of.
Claim shall be commence no later
than three years from the date
claims can be brought with a
different representation of a
right.
Yes okay.
Look at that language more real
hang up is difference of three
year statute of limitations you
have a full three years to bring
that pride.
If this language could be
interpreted as.
Bringing the claim within three
years and in the time that I
could bring that Claire and.
Then have you created them
almost six year statute of
limitations because I could
bring that claim any time during
the first three years.
Do I get the opportunity to
bring a claim.
Five years and three hundred
sixty four days later.
and gentleman the answer is no.
Mr speaker gentle lady are I
hope you're correct in that I
just.
Have a problem with the language
Mr speaker gentle lady earlier
the Representative companion
down and.
Ask your employees could be sued
and the answer was low and I
agree with the.
That interpretation of the of
the bill.
The real outcome as the
employer.
The governmental entity they're
being sued under this
legislation that for.
Mr speaker gentleman that's
correct.
Mr speaker and the lady for the
the teacher cannot be sued with
the school district would be
sued for the.
Our conduct that would give rise
to the point is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct.
And likewise thank you districts
go on down the list for the
various entities that are
intended to be covered by this
and that's basically all
determinants of these except for
the judiciary and the
legislature is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentlemen that is
correct.
The Mister speaker the
Next question I have.
Concerns and our current.
My question is what is the cap
if there's one occurrence.
But it involves five separate
plans.
What is the cap for one
occurrence slide five separate
individuals that were formed far
that occurrence.
What would the exposure of the
to the government entities.
Mr speaker.
And gentlemen each would have a
cap so if I children were
molested there would be a two
million dollar cap for each
claim.
Well I might say that if there
were five children last about
would be five separate
occurrences.
I'm talking about one occurrence
but I individuals are involved.
Would there be a two million
dollar capital ten million
dollars staff.
And Mister speaker and
Representative I don't know what
occurrence would injure the
civil rights of five individuals
but I believe if that were the
case then each would have a
claim to the I or excuse me to
the two million dollar cap.
Do you happen to have an example
that you could elaborate on for
a hypothetical perhaps.
I suppose I could speculate come
up with one of the I think I get
your your your intention is to
basically allow the department
to have full recovery of the cap
the two variables and that's
really what I was fifteen at.
The question was asked earlier.
For the statement was made by
believing Committee the one of
the purposes of this legislation
was the hold bad actors that
document actors accountable.
I believe the representative
from Sierra County
Touched on that but.
How does this legislation hold
the bad governmental actors
accountable if they are
prohibited from being sued by
this legislation.
Mr speaker and representative it
holds government.
Accountable for government
misconduct.
Mr speaker and only the that is
correct hold government
accountable for misconduct but
it does not hold bad actors
accountable for their conduct
them and so.
The the argument that this
legislation is intended to hold
that actors accountable thank
you so that of a roof and the
it's one that
we're holding.
And also by the governmental
entities and the citizens of the
state accountable for those
Fairfax's.
Sent them up to concern all of
get a couple specific provisions
of the bill of rights and get
your impression on how this
legislation would affect.
These deprivation of rights.
First four on section twenty of
our constitution which says.
However property shall not be
taken or damaged for public use
without just compensation.
We see the utilization of
eminent domain and many
Sectors.
The state needs a highway.
This can't come to terms with
the landowner so it uses eminent
domain to build a highway.
My question is if that landowner
refuses to enter into agreements
with the.
State for the acquisition of
that plan.
Is the.
Landowner going to be subject to
the limitations of two million
dollars of support and this
legislation of the declaration
of that right.
Mr speaker and Representative so
there's already so much the law
that deals with condemnation or
ready there's already
compensation for government
takings and this is not a change
to that law the caps would
apply.
Mr speaker and gentle lady we
are changing the law we are
putting a cap on recovery for
example violation of a fosters a
large up to two million dollars.
And I just wanna make sure.
The fire property the value that
in million dollars and a state
is taking that the million
dollar property but I'm not
subject to the staff there and I
heard your.
Explanation right the answer
would be no I want to make sure
that that is correct I want to
consult with experts on that
because I think it's a very
important point that the public
has a right to respect.
Mr speaker and representative
If there is a taking without due
process this could be a federal
claims where there are no cap
and unitive damages are
available.
Yes it could be a photo by
Mister speaker but it could also
be a state plan under this
legislation off.
Mr speaker and representative
this doesn't change the law
governing condemnation.
Okay so if of section twenty of
the cost of of the bill of
rights you'll deal with eminent
domain it's your it's your
testimony and your intent that.
Current eminent domain
implementation laws should still
apply even though we're putting
the staff on the deprivations of
that right.
What's the the section twenty
four of the constitution.
For section twenty four of
article two of the constitution
which is a and the bill of
rights.
Additional with the rights of
victims of criminal acts.
My question is.
If their rights are violated.
And it would generally be by a
court.
How they present to.
Violation of their rights if the
courts are accepted from the
legislature.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen I am going to
consult with my experiment.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentleman.
So you're hypothetical I guess
is to facilitate that but and
judicial immunity.
Could apply because the judges
doing his or her job as a judge
this pervert reserve he did
showing eighties so no the Civil
Rights Act claims against the
board under the bill of rights
also there is enabling
legislation pursuant to article
two section twenty four eight of
the bill of rights that well
with the following there.
Thank you and we can't hear you.
Apologizes to speak out on the
how it automatically does that
the with the.
Mr speaker and the only one on
what I just heard you say as a
even though a four.
Impact on.
Might have had their.
Senator rights violated by the
court you're not allowing them
to exercise our rights under.
Section twenty four.
Because of the.
Community granted to the point
there will be no cause of action
against the courts for the
violation of that victims rights
Sir.
Correct Representative statement
of what you are related second
ago.
Mr speaker and gentleman that
there would be no action against
the judge the is a potential
employee did.
Violate someone's Civil Rights
Act and that would apply so
that's what is entailed with
judicial immunity.
So the.
Action of a for.
For the bailout.
For the.
judges secretary fifteen the
cost of inaction but the.
Order of the judge for the
actions of the judge could not
we actionable.
Correct correct.
Mr speaker and gentlemen
I think of you brought in.
Your question to is this a
violation at an employee.
Is making against someone.
Senator right.
One section twenty four your
laundry.
Mexico in front of that with the
markets.
some of which
all the right to appear in the
court first.
Thus the specific example.
The court procurement that
victims from appearing in that
court proceedings.
Is that action of the judge
actionable and what I heard you
say there's no because of the
judge.
I suspect if it's available the
program is is that you have a
cause of action.
Representative judge these
completely immune from.
His actions are you from rising
to a claim under this
legislature.
Mr speaker and gentlemen I think
if you could be more specific
because concert constitutional
claims are not at all like
negligence claims so you could
be more specific in your
hypothetical
What I understand is that.
With judicial immunity.
It's against others not the
judge because here you can
appeal from a judge's decision
so that's where the difference
lies the judges do you mean you
and whether there's another
claim depends on too many
unknown factors.
Okay let's say the judge.
This is in order.
That.
For whatever reason.
No one can appear in the court
room except for the lawyers and
the defendants.
The perpetrator.
The victim.
Under this bill of rights as of
right to attend all public for
proceedings the accused.
As the right to access.
So we have a situation where the
court's order.
Procurement legislation some
from the to.
Does that allow of the.
To bring a claim against the
jets.
For violation of their
constitutional right to stay in
the hearing where the Hughes is
president.
I can't get any more specific
than that.
Mr speaker and gentlemen thank
you for that here at the victims
can seek an injunction or an
emergency appeal.
No cause of action under your
legislators.
Because other require for
success.
it's not a damages action so
what they what want to do again
is seeking injunction or
emergency appeal.
And to my knowledge the only one
that gets to speak in front of a
reaction within hours of
the injunction is maybe the
governor of the state thanks so
rest of us weeks months or maybe
years to get out
moving on
Mr speaker jollity of.
We talked a little bit about the
committee whether or not putting
the language of this what the
this action.
Could be brought in in a New
Mexico District Court and the.
A fact of of that Legisla- for
the effect of that language and
allowing.
Parties to form shop
I still have a concern in that
regard and there's the
amendments about a fact that
portion of the original bill
Bennett Mr speaker gentle lady.
Stirs speaker and gentlemen of
the the venue statutes still
apply.
Yeah but this legislation still
says.
Pursue these remedies and in a
District Court state.
That that provision was I
changed was it.
Mr speaker and gentleman local
governments have to be sued and
their community.
Under the new statute.
Yes Mr speaker and gentlemen
that so then you law.
Mr speaker gentle lady thank you
for allowing me once again the
Bill number questions regarding
this legislation I'm really
concerned with the impact on.
Farmers smaller governmental
entities and communities the I
really wish we'd seen
maybe an expansion under the
tort claims act instead of doing
those we still have report
claims act that would could be
pursued and now with this bill
is on the wall you have of our
rights under
these provisions of twelve one
with a two million staff one
with the million dollar job.
And I think it might lead to
some confusion thank you for
your time thank you Mr speaker.
Thank.
Thank the general Representative
Martinez.
Thank you Mr speaker well the
gentle lady please you.
Speaker I yield to the gentleman
from Bernalillo county.
Mr speaker the lady I I
appreciate your your time and I
appreciate all the work that's
going into and your bill
you know this this is a long
time coming and and you know my
first question to you agility is
how long has this been.
In process
is this a fly by night is a bill
that you thought of two weeks
ago is this something that
you've been working on for
awhile can you give us a sense
of that.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentlemen no this is not a
fly by night to kind of bill
it was something that was awful
coming from the legislature as
far as putting a commission
together that worked for almost
a year to take it and comments
concerns
about the civil rights of New
Mexico
citizens as well as holding
government accountable it was
comprised of a commission that
was made up of a bipartisan
members although the bipartisan
members did and always and very
what are the results but the
result was a report by the
commission of the majority of
those members so again having
several hearings taking and
concerns from folks I I hate to
I don't know if this is what
you're referring to but I did
receive emails saying how have
you not consulted with minister
County how have you not
consulted with you know some
some folks that again are are
claiming the size following but
we've had several dedicated
members of the commission that
know the law have experience
professionals on that commission
putting in lots of time and
energy to come up with this
major recommendation.
Thank you Mr speaker and gentle
lady and as as I as I remember
this and and you know.
The last eleven months I feel
like ten years for many of us
but other wary members is this
commission was created during
the was it the first official
session Madam speaker you Mr
speaker the lady.
Mr speaker and gentlemen I
believe the commission was
created during the first regular
session or excuse me the regular
session but let me just confirm
that because I don't want to get
the wrong information.
Mr speaker and gentlemen eyes
and corrected it was actually a
result of the April special
session.
Sorry they sometimes all come
together and that I think that
this thing Mr speaker it's
because I think it the
difference between June special
session I think is when the the
commission was created from not
mistaken
and please feel free to correct
me or have you experts correct
me and Mister speaker JD you
know what I remember from from
that time period clearly you
know this pandemic was already
reaching it was chaotic for many
in our communities we know that
for those you know three four
months of of twenty twenty it
was very difficult for many
people and it was around June
that the session convene in
special session and really the
call for that session was was
COVID relief pandemic relieve
figure out how to get support
for small businesses to people
out in the community you know
how to address this public
health crisis which forces a
national crisis in international
prices but New Mexico as the
state government certainly has a
role to play
but there was one other call for
that session and that dealt with
accountability for you know for
for for law enforcement
you know in light of what had
happened nationally you know in
light of the senseless murder of
of Mr George Floyd and in this
country
you know finally I think coming
to terms with the very real
impact.
that what happens when there's
distrust between our communities
and between
you know our our our women and
men in uniform
and Mr speaker lady I was
involved in many conversations
you were involved in many
conversations with A. R.
legislature and with it even
beyond within our community as
to how the legislature should
have and and sadly how should we
react right and it said that
sometimes we have to reconnect
very much better food for act
but sometimes we have to react
to what's happening on the
ground in a couple of things
came of that discussion of the
first one was it was reference
for you today by by another one
of our other colleagues the
pelicans right
there's up until then there's no
mandate for our law enforcement
officials to have the documents
which by the way I think are a
great tool for for our law
enforcement professionals to be
able to defend themselves
against any baseless.
Thank you bye
you know by somebody who who
they arrest
and the other thing that emerge
out of that process was the
creation of this commission
Mr speaker and only.
And you know what I really want
to highlight here in my to be
with you is you know what we
started to be with this wasn't a
fly by night operation this was
a great idea that you know
popping your head Mila night in
you drafted into a bill and then
all of a sudden you're running
with it this was something that
in fact we just the legislature
you know ultimately being able
to deliver to body.
Took a step back.
So the lay of the land.
And decided that instead of
moving forward.
With an actual piece of
legislation during that special
session.
Instead of moving forward with
some sort of accountability
measure as so many people.
We're asking us to so many of my
constituents were emailing
economies and you've got to do
something about this problem.
We took a step back we took a
deep breath and we created the
Civil Rights Commission.
now miss speaker entirely for
the benefit of the body and for
the benefit of those watching at
home
can you tell us who.
Served on that commission and
and if it's appropriate to
speculate I would love to know
the names and and who these
folks are because it is
important to understand how just
how bipartisan and how
interdisciplinary this
commission was Madam Mr speaker
in generating.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentlemen I I'm gonna pull up
the list but before I even go
there I I just want to thank you
for the debate and just quickly
note that a majority of the
commission was bipartisan we had
a lot of local governments that
but a lot of time before the
commission and New York correct
that was the June special
session and we had Republicans
Democrats and declined to state
that voted to create the bill
Richard excuse me justice
Richard Boston is.
I I believe was the chair of the
commission he is retired from
the New Mexico Supreme Court.
And let me just if you would
give me a minute I can pull up
other members.
Thank you Mr speaker delay yeah
I appreciate that I think it's
important for us to to
understand who who came up
eventually with the bill that is
part of this.
Thank you Mr speaker and
gentlemen I agree I think you're
right I think it a lot of these
folks that were invited to be on
the commission where there
because of their education and
their expertise in the subject
matter so.
we have also Denise Torrance is
the Republican she voted yes he
is from Los crucis and a lawyer.
mark Baker was the vice chair.
Back excuse me Zachary human is
a lawyer with substantial
experience he's been working
with native American communities
I think most if not all of his
career within the state of New
Mexico he is a declined to say
and is a member of the Caddo
nation.
And I am getting others give me
a minute.
Thank you Mr speaker the lady
and involve while you get that
that full list
I do have a a few other
questions that I wanted to
propose to you
this this afternoon no one
o'clock one twenty.
This bill was was pre file if I
remember correctly and against
you know sticking with the theme
of of of this bill really being
vetted and and you know re
vented and you know accounted
for every step of the way this
bill is pre filed there are some
folks who came out and said you
know what we've got some
problems with this bill whether
it was you know municipal
governments are counties or or
you know what not
this bill has been amended a.
Number of times if I'm not
mistaken is that correct Mr
speaker and gently.
Mr speaker and gentlemen that's
correct I mean even through the
drafting before it was actually
pre filed or excuse me filed it
did go through many different
revisions including you know
putting forth the concerns of
the municipalities I mean those
were in jest overnight revisions
there was a lot of time and
discussion that was made by you
know Mr speaker as well as that
the experts who are joining me
on the call today including
Mister Mister Baker and Justice
Boston because they were the
vice chair and the chair of the
commission.
Thank you Mr speaker agility and
is it accurate that in through
the amendment process and then
eventually a House Judiciary
Committee substitute one of
things that was changing I think
one of our colleagues we to this
earlier was that there is no we
cap is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct there is now a cap
as I mentioned previously that
that cap is not included in the
federal Civil Rights Act.
So Mr speaker you lady if if my
local government were to say oh
my goodness we are very
concerned about this bill you
know the unlimited liability you
open up the door to you know
some sort of astronomical
judgment by a judge somewhere
that's not gonna happen anymore
there is a cap as to those money
or money that monetary damages
is that correct.
That's also correct and again
another difference is that in
the in the federal claims more
is punitive damages all out
there.
So what you're telling me Mr
speaker Gail AT is that
As this bill will support should
it move forward here today and
and continues with the Senate
as perhaps some local
governments are expressing
concern
There are no on limited dollars
that they're going to have to
pay out for one of these claims
this bill now house has a cap on
it I think I heard you say it's
two million dollars.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct the bill it in its
original form did not include a
cap the cap is currently two
million dollars that also
includes attorney's fees that
are to be included in that cap
so again hearing and listening
to the concerns of folks that
was something that we did change
to address those concerns and
and Mister speaker and gentlemen
I think you have
the full list now that I can
provide you with judge judge
Boston was the chair mark Baker
was the vice chair Gerald
buyers.
the rest are now committee
members Gerald buyers Zachary
Callen Senator Steven bill
sector Rodriguez him Stewart the
needs Torrance and Stan Walker
Can Stewart is the hero of Dona
Ana County Stan Walker is a
criminal court judge from
Bernalillo county.
And the yes votes were Justice
Boston work Baker.
let me see judge Stan Whitaker
Denisse Torres and Zachary
Callen.
Thank you Mr speaker jelly that
this is a very comprehensive
list of professionals again you
know very diverse and in more
ways than one
people from different
professional experiences who
came together by the way
In in an open process
transparent process right there
is nothing you know closed door
about this whole process he was
very open it was it was
publicized was very much in my
local newspaper here you know
whenever there was a meeting
with every decision was made we
were kept up to date let let me
let me take a thirty thousand
foot view the speaker you know
eighty percent think of
oftentimes in these debates
you know we we can we can do it
really deep into the weeds and
and that's okay I mean that's
part of this process but I think
it's always good to to to come
back and answer ask ourselves
why right
Often times and and I've been
guilty this insure the past you
know we we debate are we present
legislation that is you know a
problem in search of a or a
solution in search of a problem
right
and and sometimes you know maybe
some of us I I know when I was a
freshman I was a little
overzealous and introducing all
kinds of bills go try to fix all
kinds of problems that perhaps
were really there in the you
know you visually learn those
lessons is is as you go along
but but often times we are
presented with these
opportunities to deal with
problems with issues that have
been with us for generations and
you know I think that in many
cases
you know those those pieces of
legislation I think are are
among the most consequential of
his legislature could ever pass
and you know a lot of the work
that's happened in the past in
bipartisan fashion with regard
to Essex for example I'm in the
ethics commission I think it's
it's a it's a wonderful very
much impactful and consequential
piece of legislation that was
worked on in bipartisan way my
my fellow classmate former
president it's going to go lead
on that on the house side you
know that's a big deal you know
Representative McQueen with his
work on on capital outlay
disclosures you know another big
deal right this is another one
you know this is also a one of
those pieces of legislation that
goes to the heart of restoring
trust in our government.
And often times you know there
are bad actors in government.
god knows there have been bad
actors in our legislature.
you know and and they've been
held accountable there have been
bad actors in our local
government in our school
district you know we're
government is not immune from
the same bad actors that the you
know that you can find in you
know any private business
setting or or you know anywhere
else.
This bill to me.
Go to the heart of restoring
trust at a time when trust is
very very hard to find.
we are in a deeply.
With the size and divided time
in our country
you know we just got through a
second impeachment trial for
crying out loud and and you know
regardless of where you stand
on.
The process of impeachment the
fact is that the you know the
the issue is that the fact.
You know make us make us wonder.
I'm sorry I think I froze.
Think of froze for a minute
there.
The the the the the fact that we
even have that second
impeachment trial I think goes
to the heart of of of that
distrust that exists in in our
community
and I believe your bill is
really designed to.
Toward restoring that trust.
You know over the years there
have been countless countless
people.
That have been killed.
By bad actors in law enforcement
again this is about the bad
actors law enforcement this is
an anti police bill this is an
anti police officer legislation
it is not.
This is about ensuring.
That that trust.
Between.
Our citizens between the people
who live in this country and
those government agencies
interact with whether it's law
enforcement whether it's other
state or government employees is
restored.
And you know sadly there have
been too many.
That have perished in front of
our very eyes.
you know and and to me.
You know when when when my eight
year old daughter is asking me
about George what we know about
what happened to him quite
happy.
The fact that I have to explain
to my young daughter.
Why it is that that happened.
Now.
I have to tell you Mr speaker
and gentle lady.
When that happened I was I was I
was is kind of sad and tore up
inside but when I saw this
country come together
Republicans and Democrats.
Big companies and small business
what I saw as all come together
in the now that very act.
And when we saw so many states
Republican and democratic state.
Jump.
At the opportunity of finally
tackling these issues that we
deal with every single day in
our communities you madam Mr
speaker and utility you
represent a district of that is.
Overwhelmingly.
you know the lower income people
of color I know you district
well I I want those streets.
You know I represent a similar
district.
People need to have faith in
government again and people have
to be able to trust.
The people.
That they put in office.
And consequently the people they
put in office are the same
people that hired the people who
work on our behalf whether it's
law enforcement whether it's
educators whether it's the trash
collectors whether it's animal
control you name it services
that we pay for we've got to be
able to trust them.
Mr speaker and and the lady I I
appreciate your work and I
appreciate your support for
these efforts I appreciate your
leadership.
On this particular issue with
this particular bill.
and I appreciate you restoring
that trust in government there
are so many that perished you
know and and and we've got to
remember those good folks to
mere rice George Floyd you know
James boy here in our own
backyard.
Mary Hawkes in our own backyard.
We did not deserve to die.
People who died at the hands of
bad actors.
Eighteen died because of an
entire agency that in die at the
hands.
An entire.
Part of it he died at the hands
of bad actors those bad actors
have to be held accountable.
Thank you madam chair Madam
speaker Mr speaker and gentle
lady I appreciate your time
today.
The gentleman from Katrin
Sapporo and Valencia
Representative Gail Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker well the
gentle lady from Bernalillo
yield.
Mr speaker I do you yield to the
gentle lady from catcher and and
those two other counties.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
kind lady let me preface my
questions with I am not an
attorney.
But I do Representative.
Rural and frontier New Mexico.
I noticed Mr speaker and kind
lady in one of your statements.
You named off the people that
were invited.
To be on this.
Committee.
That.
That the majority voted in favor
of the bill that's been
somebody substituted and amended
several times.
That alone to me Mr speaker and
kind lady is enough reason to
say maybe the committee didn't
get it right.
Maybe the committee Mr speaker
and kind lady should take
another look at.
This before we pass it through
life so appreciate Mr speaker
and kind lady the time energy
and effort that all of them have
put into trying to make
something.
Better.
And.
So that being said Mr speaker
crime lady
I I know I just have a couple
questions so it's been talked
about Mr speaker I'm lady that
we passed an amendment for the
tort claims act.
Our during one of the special
sessions thank you it's all kind
of work together.
For me and added civil rights
violations as a type of a case
that can be filed against the
agency.
So if we did that then why do we
give that amendment trying to
work before you Asapov law that
includes all state agencies Mr
speaker kindly.
Mr speaker and gentlelady let me
consult with my experts you will
just give me a minute thank you.
Thank you for speaker and thank
you gentle lady so again and and
thank you for reminding me about
the amendment to the tort claims
act what and I I dress is a
little bit earlier so what that
amendment did is that it applied
to line for enforcement and only
in regards to personal injury
and property damages and again
this is an issue that the
municipalities are arguing right
now because there isn't a Civil
Rights Act behind it
another thing again is that you
know in.
In law there are things for
different
Subject matters and so with
federal law we do have a tort
claims act and also a Civil
Rights Act so here it just made
more sense create a school
Rights Act.
Mr speaker Representative gentle
lady.
Thank you yes thank you Mr
speaker and kind lady for that a
clarification and so and so at
the so what we're creating at
the state level we're taking
away the qualified immunity
where the federal level still
applies qualified immunity.
I just want to make sure that
that's I'm reading that
correctly.
Mr speaker and gentle lady that
is correct.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady
I'm aware of only one other
state Mr speaker kindly that is
passed this type of legislation
has the Civil Rights Commission
asked about the effect of this
type of legislation in Colorado
and one of you wants to see the
effect of the legislation
before taking.
Such a radical step in the state
of New Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
believe that that act was just
recently passed I think Colorado
in looking at achieving the act
is also concentrating on what
we're looking to do here which
is focusing on protecting people
to ensure that they are treated
fairly.
there are six six eight I
believe I'm being told that have
a Civil Rights Act including
Arkansas.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady that's that's good
information to know so let's
talk about attorney's fees
Mr speaker kind lady the twerks.
Act does not guarantee
attorney's fees doesn't.
Mr speaker and the lady that is
correct.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
kind lady so another we are
another way that attorneys get
paid after they filed cases
according to the merits of the
is it is in accordance to the
merits of the case is am I
correct.
Mr speaker and gentle lady there
are several ways that lawyers
get paid depending on the types
of cases that
That they
participate in as well as the
the likely make up of the
financial situation of the
clients.
Okay thank you Mr speaker and
kind lady
There's the one of the other
ways Mr speaker kind lady is
The agreement.
Our an attorney can enter into
with our clients that they get a
percentage of the settlement of
the case I think it's called
I can't remember what it's
called but anyway so the
attorney would get paid on the
merits of the case that it would
make an attorney screening case
more carefully if they knew the
fees and costs would determined
by the merits of the case not
just the amount of time spent on
the.
Mr speaker and generally I
apologize I I didn't get the
question.
I'm that's okay I'll just I'll
move on so Mr speaker kind lady
So we're creating in this bill
a way that no matter.
One that the attorneys get their
fees is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentle lady many
essential civil rights don't
trigger larger damage awards
and and again the cap of two
million dollars does include the
attorney fees.
Thank you Mr speaker and kind
lady but we are guaranteeing
attorneys to be to get their
fees is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
believe that is not correct in a
lot of cases that kind of has to
prevail in order to win fees.
Mr speaker and kind lady and
what does House Bill for
specifically say in in the
language does it say Mr speaker
highlighted that they have to
win to be able to have their
attorney's fees paid or does it
say thank you there are for
instance.
I'm Mr the current gentle lady I
believe they get paid
regardless of whether or not
they win or lose
excuse me let me that's not
correct let me confer with my
experts just so I get you the
correct answer and I don't miss
the.
Thank you thank you.
Thank thank you for that time so
that's not correct and I I
misspoke so I just want to say
that only defense lawyers that
get that bill by the hour get
paid here we would have to have
the planes when in order for the
attorneys to get paid
and then going back to the
merits you know the thank you I
just creating the case on the
merits to be paid so in this
instance that the simplest way
to say it is if if you don't win
the case you don't get paid.
Thank you Mr speaker and and
kind lady that's not the way I
read it so I'm glad that you
clarified that to me thank you
and so during testimony in front
of appropriations of the
secretary of General Services
sent that this could raise his
The cost is budget to the to be
raised around thirty percent I'm
I'm paraphrasing so that's a
concern when it was stated
earlier in testimony are in in a
committee that it that it
wouldn't be from.
What across the state a lot more
money sorry I just want people
to be aware of the secretaries
of a little bit.
Concerned about that
Mr speaker kind lady.
I'm a little bit.
Concerns.
I'm concerned about the bill as
a whole but that it's been
amended to
He legislators.
The governor and the judiciary.
thank you for we give ourselves
protection.
Our and while we are the.
As it was stated earlier Mr
speaker currently.
I feel a little bit like a
hypocrite because we're giving
ourselves protection.
With immunity but want to take
other state agencies community
aware
if there's a problem.
With the what what was stated
earlier the employees and the
agencies are held accountable.
You're only changing the part
the benefits us.
are we applying this law
equitable.
My husband and I Mr speaker and
kind lady on the business for we
hire hundreds of employees.
Are we know that we have good
employees and we don't want to
threaten them with lawsuits.
Or say that we won't have to you
create good employees provide
hiring carefully training
extremely well dealing with
issues quickly.
Rewarding good service and and
treating them as you would want
to be treated Mr speaker kindly
soundly.
I do not think that the laws.
That we're creating are are
doing that this bill does not
address the problem and state
agencies it just puts them all
at risk.
Mr speaker kindly I
Representative three County
to coral Valencia and capture Mr
speaker kind lady all who have.
Sent me resolutions against this
bill.
They voted to not they they said
please Representative Armstrong.
This is going to kill us.
One of those counties that the
budget is more than the calf a
request from the cap and and
we're only addressing the result
not the problem Mr speaker kind
lady.
And so with that said
One more small little thing that
one of my County commissioners
sent me.
It's seven thousand square miles
Mr speaker currently.
And we have one.
Police are one state police
officer.
Doesn't live in the county.
Mr speaker kind and.
Drives to the protection of the
people when they are call.
As quickly in this Ripley is a
possible and.
Our captain county will not be
able to financially afford
insurance even if they raise
taxes.
And we have a little we have one
jail there in in New Mexico.
And so on I can foresee that
being closed and jobs being just
lost in rural New Mexico in a
time where Mr speaker kind lady.
We are suffering along with the
rest of the state I I would
agree to that.
Rural New Mexico is really
suffering.
And so if we close the jail.
In reserve New Mexico we drive
them the the person maybe they
get stopped and they have a
warrant we need to take them to
jail we drive them to support Mr
speaker currently that's three
hours away.
So the cost of the county goes
up jobs are lost.
And.
I just want people to know that
I appreciate what you're trying
to do I really do.
I'm all about.
I raised my children be about
accountability.
When we tie the hands of our
counties.
And our small.
I don't have a municipality in
reserve I have I have a village.
And are we taking into
consideration what we're doing
to the formal small frontier
communities and I stand with all
of my commissions that have sent
resolutions against this bill
thank you madam and Mr speaker.
Channeling from Bernalillo
Representative Deborah A.
Armstrong.
Thank you Mr speaker and will
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
you.
You Mr speaker and you yell to
the lady from Bernalillo county.
Thank you
Gentle lady I wanted to talk a
little bit further about us some
of the issues that that have
been raised this morning and put
it in maybe a little bit of
different context of of
my experience.
And I just want to be clear the
the state court tort claims act
Does not include attorney's fees
is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentle lady that
is correct okay.
And it's I I believe a million
dollar cap on the tort claims
act.
Why I have that correct.
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
I understand that it's often
much lower.
Okay thank you
so gentle lady and Mr speaker I
want to talk a little bit about
Pursuing claims in nursing homes
and the state owns and operates
multiple long term care
facilities for more and
Mr Stewart said a.
Of the veterans home and and
Sapporo in the
behavior health institute in Las
Vegas.
And in my career gentle lady
Mister speaker and in geriatric
care did a lot of work in long
term care facilities and then as
in elder rights and secretary of
aging and long term services
certainly oversaw lots of issues
in nursing homes and and
actually put together we have a
a group of attorneys for who
would potentially take a basis
and in long term care presents
very hard actually to get
attorneys to pursue
any kind of case in the long
term care facility.
because when someone is all.
And chronically ill and may not
have years of productive life
ahead of them the damages are
not very high and so it's it's
hard to to get attorneys to take
that.
In in in I would
hazard to guess that in some
place like
for for bear before the veterans
home of whatever when you're
going.
against the state and it's just
the tort claims act and whatever
attorney's fees they have to
come out of that
claim yes and probably a lower
claim.
And the folks in those
facilities are probably lower
income.
It and that may or may not have
families but it's really hard to
pursue and yet we've had deaths
in all those facilities.
And we've had
improper care.
And.
It in all of those facilities.
And for more when I was a brand
new secretary of aging and long
term services Mr speaker and and
gentle lady the department of
justice.
stepped in to investigate
of the care.
Because there had been a history
of of dust and in the years and
before I was secretary of aging.
And those that because of an
enormous amount of our resources
we there was a
court Madam.
and degree on that so consent
decree.
for for more so.
My question is Mr speaker and
and gentle lady.
Had it been a little easier for
a family of one of those members
who one of those residents to.
Who was harm.
To come forward and.
Make a claim against the state.
Civil Rights Act.
Would potentially have stopped.
Further deaths and the
department of justice having to
intervene.
This.
And that's that's I guess that's
not really a.
Question rhetorical question
because in in medical
malpractice and in in other
areas you get one suit for about
chair any clean up your you
clean up your act.
You impose new policies and
procedures and you deal with bad
actors and you employment
supervision and oversight to be
able to trying to prevent any
further
occurrences that's I think one
of the
lessons Mr speaker and gentle
lady that I've learned in in law
school was in the health law
classes that.
Malpractice suits is probably
one of the biggest drivers of
increase in quality of care and
health care.
Because you use that is stopping
you don't want that to happen
again.
So
Mr speaker and and gentle lady I
think that on.
I think that that could of
potential in and I think that we
we should make it easier
and more friendly for people
people to be able to use to
stake their claims against bad
actors and real harm and gets up
so.
I just think of that I think of
the people in those facilities
and the difficulty in trying to
pursue something.
And I think about
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
Are you familiar at all with the
Jackson lawsuit.
In New Mexico.
This speaker and gentle lady I I
do have a little bit of the
information on the Jackson
lawsuit and and I apologize I
was trying to get to my new
plans to you actually at answer
your question as well as
Yeah do you want to tell us
about the the jaxenter do you
have a question about it of the
but I guess before I even get to
that just to kind of reflect on
on the statements that that you
made and and the question that
you just did posed you know I I
I think you're absolutely right
the the bill and what we're
trying to do here really goes to
the essence of addressing access
to justice and accountability
allowing people harmed by
misconduct and providing them
access to point and helps of
folks identify problems so that
they can be corrected and
hopefully that we can address
those issues so that they don't
relate in further harm to people
and especially that and I think
you made a great point about
you know let's let's.
Or for an easiest term kind and
dip it in the bud when we
identify things that aren't
going right
we need to take action people
deserve or governments to take
action so that individuals
aren't harmed.
Thank you Mr speaker and thank
you gentle lady and it and it is
particularly I'm thinking about
those
who are more vulnerable.
And less able to speak for
themselves and.
Who
aren't quite frankly and
honestly big claim dollars
because they they in the way you
calculate damages and lost
productivity and length of of
lives lost or whatever it is you
know if your disabled or you
know eighty five years old.
Yes it's not a high claim
but it's it's real harm and it's
it it.
It permeates I think institution
it will allow is allowed to go
on check.
But Mr speaker and gentle lady
in regards to the Jackson
lawsuit that was of a again the
federal civil rights claim
against a state institution for
developmentally disabled and
also in this.
And that facility is long closed
but the the
consent decree and the work on
getting out of that consent
decree went on for more than
thirty years.
And we paid millions and
millions and millions of dollars
to attorneys to continue working
on resolving all the issues for
all the individuals who have
been
harmed or part of that of a
class of people potentially
harmed.
By that by the care delivered in
that
facility.
And Mr speaker and gentle lady
another example is
the Duran consent decree about
that person.
During the person that went on
for more than forty years.
And again these are all the
individuals on talking about Mr
speaker and gentle lady don't
have a lot of voice and our more
vulnerable.
I'm particularly those who are
disabled in the Jackson lawsuit
or the individuals who were
harmed or even
Passed away as a result of how
they were cared for and state
facilities and.
So I think at some.
I think it's incumbent upon us
to find a better way for them to
take action I think it will
Drive down.
The incidence of that if if
people aren't held accountable
in of the institutions and the
state or the community aren't
held accountable for the
employees and how they're
trained who they hire how they
supervise and the policies and
procedures which were under
which they operate.
I.
In the in we need to hold them
accountable to that and it is
the state or local government
that owns and operates those
programs
That should be held accountable
in my opinion for
the care and the services that
are provided by their staff and
I think if we don't intervene on
some of those intervenors.
Continue and grow and and grow
and it becomes a culture.
And so I know that there is
Mr speaker and gentle lady
sometimes it's just an
individual that actor.
and and and the institution
cleans up a response to that
right away but some of the ones
I'm talking about.
It was a permeated culture.
Of of care.
And so I want to thank you for
bringing this forward and you
stole my thunder about my my one
of my really good bottom line
question Houllier is if no one
civil rights are violated.
It doesn't cost anything.
in responding to two suits and
and I.
On top of that or in addition to
that if if one of those suits
happens early.
Before it permeates the culture
I think you put a stop to it.
And so
Mr speaker and gentle lady I
want to thank you for bringing
this forward I wanted to
Frying give some real examples
of where we have spent
a lot of money and a lot of
resources have you respond to
federal intervention.
Where we could have made it
easier for people within the
state and all ourselves
accountable so with that
Mister speaker and gentle lady
again thank you for for
continuing to pursue this.
Thank you.
Thank there is for the event the
gentleman from San Juan
Representative Strickler.
Thank you Mr.
Thank you Mr thank you thank you
gentle lady with the lady from.
From earlier please yield.
Mister speaker I yield to the
general man from San Juan.
Gentlelady.
just a couple of things we we
In San Juan County we remain
with the
family county commissioners and
the city you know the city of
Farmington and
on a routine basis and and this
bill came up and Senator was
part of our our committee our
our team legislative delegation
the space settlements Committee.
We had great concerns with the
bill and and I think the final
vote was it was closed I the
for.
And Centerville
and the of his the the other
dissenting voters filed a a
dissenting opinion and I
gathered up all the information
into a gentle lady and Mr
speaker from the cities and
counties and school districts
to impose this bill and and not
that they are in favor of your
responsibility
in the Civil Rights arena
heavens no I just felt that this
bill one two four now you
mentioned earlier social very
closely divided both and I
believe the for the five day
voted in favour Rolf turns and
correct me if I'm wrong but I
believe they're all turned.
In that kind of bothers me a
little bit it just seems seems
to me a little
of the conflict that you know
what a line up distillate I'm
just a businessman that works
with attorneys.
quite often in my in my business
and whatnot so.
The staff the madam of a
wrestling some limited.
And two million.
Well that's good I mean that
that's good that is it's it's
still quite high.
And then also from what I
understand is Senate bill that
the terms please run limited is
is that is that your
understanding in this your
amended bill.
A gentle lady Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentlemen thank
you for the question I just want
to make one verification there
were two judges so not all of
them were attorneys and even
though I I think folks have a
the agency representation are a
different understanding of
attorneys you know attorneys do
very different things I'm an
attorney I don't practice any of
this law might my efforts are in
in tribal government budget but
the the cap of the two million
dollars includes the attorney's
fees.
Thank you for that clarification
in.
The as a practical matter.
The cities counties and school
districts Lisa Myers thanks
statewide and we're we're kind
of a
One of the large County we're
like fifth largest county San
Juan County in our cities like
number six so I think we're
pretty good
test you know K. for for the
state we're not me we're
obviously not small counties
that was mentioned by
Representative Dow there's fifty
four municipalities that have a
budget less than two million
dollars so.
I I know the cities counties and
school districts
Have a high
sensitive of a training and for
mismanagement to make sure
they're following the law
in a this is part of their
training and and policy thank
you Representative
Senator Armstrong rent you know
mention rightly so that
these lawsuits these landmark
lawsuits really to a clean clean
things up.
And I agree with that that's
that's that's absolutely
correct.
In this case you know money.
The concern we have and and in
our county and our city is
liability and how do we cover
of the liability of the fiscal
it's the.
It's it's a real challenge for
them and are or County jail in
our law enforcement of in other
departments you know they're
gonna have a hard time finding
insurance so what will happen.
Is that the cities and counties
not just in our country we'll
have to self insure.
And we're gonna have to you're
more.
you know the research.
that that the required the key
and this is gonna be a real
challenge for themselves it's
not that
Cities and counties and school
districts are are shirking the
responsibilities
trying to
boy you cannot building.
But this is kind of goes too far
and again I appreciate.
For state gentle lady that she
did that but he still million
dollars higher than the of
claims act limited tort claims
act as of million I believe this
is indexed for inflation this is
the introduced heavy he'll kill
to climb
and I know this is an injury
industry as well as city
governments and county
governments delayed their very
very focused on health and
safety and and good business
practice to the
the government practice also
good teaching practice and we're
not perfect we all you know is
going to be some of some
mistakes made
Reiman and that that's going to
happen but we have to kind of
control our
No liability and I think this is
pretty tough this is a pretty
tough Lee and I appreciate these
things and that the the five
those with two judges that the
returns as well they have have
a.
Legal background like to be a
judge the lady.
Mr speaker and gentleman yes.
So that that's really all I have
I just want to give the body
feedback
from you know start historic
counties all counties are
concerned about this and the
descent report of the cities
with the concern that in in the
school district for concern that
knows of forty.
Areas of our our
of government and and then they
want to do the right thing
there's laws on the books that
that counts over this so thank
you of generating thank you Mr
chairman thank you Mr speaker.
The gentleman from civil rights
and economic Representative
Oakland.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo
county owned.
I think you mean to me you.
Thank you very.
Committees year out thank you
I guess my question to you is.
In today's world okay right a
person that this feels aggrieved
wants to file a civil action
lawsuit.
In today's world the only way
they can do it there's by filing
in federal court is that
correct.
Mr speaker and gentlemen.
Is.
So.
Mr speaker and gentle lady.
In New Mexico.
If I wanted to file a civil
action lawsuit because I felt
agree with as a citizen of the
state of New Mexico.
Or or what I have to go.
Mr speaker and gentlemen would
have to go to federal court so
you could go to Albuquerque you
could go to Los crucis as in
addition to that there are
uncapped.
Liabilities in federal court and
you could also get unitive
damages so the claims that you
know we're hearing that this
bill goes too far.
People that have been that had
had their rights violated civil
rights violated can go to
federal court and and actually
get more and and the counties
excuse me the municipalities are
currently subject to this.
Thank you the lady that was that
eight we want to call it kind of
credit clarify news okay so
you're telling me up the gentle
lady to Mister speaker you're
telling me.
I think my case today to federal
court there is no limit to the
amount of money I consume for is
that correct.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct and there is Mr speaker
and gentle lady and there is no
limit to the amount of attorney
fees I can collect in federal
court is that correct.
Mr speaker and gentlemen that is
correct.
It thank you I really want to
clarify that Mr speaker and
gentleman and then we ask you
this so you said.
The federal courts are in the.
At in so.
Is that correct correct me if
I'm wrong.
Mr speaker and gentleman that's
correct thank you ladies so.
If.
And the aggrieved person okay
this is in this great state of
New Mexico and I feel wrong okay
something's being done that
because in one filed a suit on
the civil action case.
This legislation I no longer
have to go to federal court I
can go for District Court and
filed this lawsuit in my
correct.
Mr speaker and gentlemen so you
could go to state court so this
would be something I know
gentlemen you live in the county
of of all I believe is Milan
Boller.
so you would be able to go to
your home court.
In your community.
So madam chair Mister speaker
as.
And delayed okay that but
everybody I mean in every county
the issue is one question so you
should say cord in my mind I'm
thinking District Court my
wrong.
Mr speaker and
gentleman you're not wrong okay
thank you and how many
industries chords do we have
gentle gentle lady Mister
speaker how many District Court
do we have in the state of New
Mexico.
Mr speaker and gentlemen we
have.
Mr speaker in German I'm
consulting with my experts
because I don't want to give you
the wrong number.
Give me one minute.
Thank you for the post office.
For.
Mr speaker and gentlemen we have
thirteen judicial districts and
at least thirty three.
So one courthouse in every
county.
Thank you Mr speaker is
generally the constitution the
state of New Mexico I believe
mandates that every county
provide and maintain a District
Court house.
So therefore Mr speaker and the
lady.
A person that has agreed wants
to file a suit like this can
just go down to their local
court house and see greener as
at their local level instead of
having to go to federal court.
That is still a I see this in my
wrong.
Mr speaker and gentlemen you're
not wrong you are correct thank
you and Mr speaker and gentle
lady I I am concerned with the
concerns that we heard from the
opposition of this legislation
because.
To me being able to do something
in your own community in this
and not having
is the person that wants to go
file a lawsuit.
Would have to go all the way
into federal court and I don't
even know how to get into that
building in Albuquerque does
anybody.
Other than somebody who has
served in there as a attorney or
a judge is anybody want to get
into that building I don't J. as
in number one thing the number
two thing is this is the life in
today's world being able to make
life easy easy are being made
able to make it possible for a
person that is in the state in
New Mexico that is is that is
the state of New Mexico that is
a greeting by a public bodies
being able to have that ability.
To file a lawsuit in their own
community instead of having to.
For federal court.
And we're going to the speaker
and gentle lady I'm not the
worst of it.
So for these communities that I
think they're one of those lots
and lots of money.
In federal court there is no
gap.
Yes.
My concern is
maybe you can address this
quality for anybody and the
community in the rural areas
that they would have a long of
lawsuits once this legislation
passed one concern that is what
worries me.
Can you thank you.
Mr speaker and gentlemen I think
that's a really good question I
I don't quite understand the
answers that they're providing
because what you're saying is
correct currently have a
person's civil rights are
violated they can go to federal
court where the
there is no cap and there are
punitive damages here we have
the opportunity to address that
and going back to what
representative Deborah Armstrong
said about looking out for
individuals that are most
vulnerable you know we have so
many individuals that her most
vulnerable that aren't entities
areas where you have to go and
figure out how to get into
federal court and file a claim
here or looking at going to our
community local boards which
also serves to benefit the
defendants because they get to
defend their conduct in their
own communities instead of
having to defend the conduct in
federal court which is sometimes
hundreds of miles away so this
is actually a more limiting than
the options that are currently
available to individuals but
we're making access to the court
more extensible we are looking
out to protect the interests of
those that are most vulnerable
so Mr Mr speaker and gentlemen I
I would like to have a better
answer to white individual of
primarily and municipalities are
are so concerned because at the
end of the day you know at and I
believe folks are looking out to
to protect individuals and and
I.
I I hope that once behavior of
bad actors this is flagged as a
red flag that you know those
were addressed right away so
that we don't get into conduct
that is the most harmful
including that but
that's that's my answer to your
question Mr speaker and foment.
Thank you thank you all ladies
that's good for the feeling that
I had but I just didn't want to
more recent that way.
You Mr speaker and gentle lady
because I'm really concerned
that this fear of that is out
there is telling me that somehow
or another these entities are
imposed are seeing something
that we as the people and and
you know I I consider myself the
people.
Our currency because that why is
the fear that there are going to
be so many more lawsuits and
that they're going to break all
these municipalities would one
lawsuit in federal court just
one alone Mr speaker gentle lady
in federal court good basically
banker of the community well
this one will only allow this
correct me if I'm wrong two
million dollars.
Includes the attorney fees.
While in federal court you can
have all the dollars that you
required you loss of attorney
fees and municipalities.
Government entities are
concerned about losing their
shared with this legislation
okay no worries me who was
speaker gentle lady so I this is
the beginning of the legislation
that was fine to worry about.
But as judge somebody who sat on
the bench and sees the local
people and sees what's happening
in today's world I really think
that the shortcut alive is
allowing people to be able to do
whatever they need in their own
community need to be served by
their community and not by the
federal government to be served
by a judge.
That comes from their community
and not a judge appointed by
some residents were most to go.
That is the court for a remand
were some judge that doesn't
have any idea of where we live
in New Mexico is.
So that is exactly where are you
coming from a more support on
this Mister speaker gentle lady
I don't have much more to add
just remember this when you
think about this you are serving
the state of New Mexico you are
serving the citizens of the
state of New Mexico will this
legislation because you are
helping the citizens of the New
Mexico state in New Mexico
address their concerns address
their problems in a way that
they can do it instead of having
to go to federal court.
And honestly that is the best
way but the life you have been
the short road for justice is
the best just as there is for
the citizens in the state of New
Mexico thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentle lady from
reason for this legislation.
Thank you chairman there's for
that event and gentleman from
San Juan Representative Lane.
Thank you Mr speaker the gentle
lady from Santa Fe kindly you.
Speaker I yield to the gentleman
from San Juan.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady and I've not had the
floor of the privilege of
meeting the gentle lady in
person but and I do look for
that but I do want to mark that
I really like for for blue
glasses.
They look very sharp and I have
some on today but they're not
quite as vivid so I'm a little
jealous.
Mr speaker I am a licensed
attorney I've been a member of
the the state bar since two
thousand and.
after today's long debate I
might want to join another bar
but that's a different
discussion I suppose.
But my question Mr speaker is
there anything in the bill
currently have risen.
That would preclude me preclude
me on the license attorney from
voting in favor of this bill
today.
And then later filing a lawsuit
against the state agency and and
profiting from Michael today.
Mr speaker and come home and
The way that I understand it is
that you are not profiting from
the vote if you are an attorney
that you know works with folks
that have had their civil rights
violated and you profit from
that that would be a profit from
the practice of law not from
your vote on this issue.
Thank you Mr speaker and there's
been a lot of discussion about
restoring trust.
And as soon as we can talk about
conflicts of interest in the and
that's a legal concept.
but this seems like a conflict
of interest from the to be able
to cast a vote today in favor of
and then while still a member of
this legislature file a lawsuit.
Under the New Mexico Civil
Rights Act.
Does that not seem like a
conflict of interest to you
gently thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker and gentlemen you
know I I like you mentioned you
know I haven't had the pleasure
of meeting you in person I I
know you the body and that so I
don't have you know the the the
the
The information on your family I
do on on some of your colleagues
you know our our Mexico my
colleagues on the other side of
the aisle so I mean I don't know
if you have children the if if
you have children in the the
education system and by you
voting on the budget is that a
complex if entrez I would say no
if you were voting on another
matter you know for four have
funding that went to roads that
were in your district then
because you were driving on
those roads you know are you are
you budget had I think there is
it you know that distinction
that we have to maybe think
about of being
as lawyers and benefiting from
from serving in the legislature.
But even apart from that a
lawyer in the legislature would
be free to represent someone
wronged by a conduct
so so I don't believe that this
is a conflict of interest the
way that you are providing it Mr
speaker and gentleman.
And Mr speaker I want to thank
the response and.
With respect to for example
driving on the road I don't.
profit directly from that it
would have a contract that would
be able to receive.
Those funds for example and and
this is not unusual and for
example
there are rules that prohibits
for example from being employees
of the state while.
Are currently a member of the
legislature that career.
Mr speaker and gentleman that is
correct.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady.
And so again.
I certainly not present for the
bonding with your but.
The theme that we've heard today
and and I agree wholeheartedly
and and that's what inspired me.
Is to stand up and speak to the
idea we're trying to restore
trust.
Within our government agencies
and I think we can all agree
that we want to restore that
trust in all of our agencies and
that our citizens demand that
kind of trust.
And so with that Mr speaker I
would like to move for
discussion purposes health for
number two the house Judiciary
Committee substitute for House
Bill for for.
And the to a two numbers point
two one nine five seven one
point three.
House.
House Judiciary Committee sensor
for House Bill for.
German president plan the two oh
two number.
Thank you Mr speaker the two
turnovers point two one nine
five seven one point three.
Mr Chairman representative Lewis
we're going is this a.
From.
Mr speaker and gentlemen
thank you for the amendment it
is not unfriendly and I just
want to talk about why so that
people can understand this
Everyone is well aware that we
are a part time volunteer
provided more when we serve in
the New Mexico state legislator
we currently as you have pointed
out Madam have restrictions on
the types of work that we can
do.
Of as a lawyer.
As previously stated before
Mister speaker and gentlemen.
We now have the freedom to pick
and choose our clients
when I was in law school and I
studied criminal law family law
I knew that that was something
the type of law that I would
never get into because there's
so much emotion between families
and when those issues arise the
and and and Mr speaker and
gentlemen again I haven't had
the pleasure to meet you and and
I don't think you said what type
of law you do that
during my career and even when I
was in law school I've changed
of the focus of of my career you
know I I will work to help
Representative underserved
communities and whether that was
working for a Pueblo
government agencies I've worked
for a state government agency I
worked in private practice
having.
To have that freedom especially
after spending four years an
undergrad I think most people do
and then three years in law
school.
Really being able to find a
practice where you are
passionate about the law where
you are passionate about your
clients
Interests and and how you can
best serve clients I think
especially when we're looking at
the clients that this Mexico
Civil Rights Act goes to serve
we're talking about vulnerable
clients we're talking about
people sometimes that are harmed
because perhaps there's a bias
against you know just your in
race or individuals with
disabilities or individuals that
are in the prison system
people that deal with these
issues lawyers that deal with
these issues are actually a very
special pre again my my passion
is elsewhere it's in serving our
tribal communities and ensuring
that especially now during the
pandemic that that folks are
Receiving access to food
receiving access to a vaccine
this is something that I'm
passionate about but but but
perhaps later
you know someone who has served
in the legislature.
It may be practicing a certain
type of law if we talk about
intellectual property and and
and having a passion for
intellectual property I thank
you you know having something
like this limit a a lawyer's
freedom to choose the type of
practice is is not something I
would want to do to your
individuals of especially when
they are working to serve those
individuals in the community
that are harmed so
we would we would never want to
ask legislators not to engage in
certain things you know and
insert one is our racing if a
sponsor bills that deal with our
racing legislation
I just don't see that
we will want to prohibit
real insurers from selling
houses if they vote on bills
relating to developments that
we've had.
Legislators actively speaking in
committee talking about bills
that they're opposing
you know again.
It's not just lawyers in the
legislature it's every single
profession
Lawyers.
No.
And and and I'm not trying to
talk so highly about lawyers
because you know Oakes have
different interests State the
serve different clients but but
they have
a lot of knowledge.
And and the state can benefit
from their expertise not
allowing lawyers to build bills
that affect the lives is
particularly we can attempt to
to lawyers so
Again I could go down the list
business owners being barred
from a from voting on bills that
affect commerce this is
something that we don't want to
do lawyers have many passions
for areas like commercial
transactions insurance defense
there are so many passions in
law I think that's the beauty of
the profession is that you know
you can come out with an
undergraduate art and and and be
involved in art Law you can come
out with an undergraduate and in
entertainment and and be a
lawyer that works in the movie
industry
Law School has so many
opportunities for people to find
their interests and their
passions and to work to serve
those passions.
So
I I think also to what this
amendment would do is that it
was what years.
Excuse me it would force lawyers
to violate the professional of
conduct and and rule five point
six so
Everyone in the chamber everyone
today that is zoom zoom in part
to
Participating in this floor
session right now is
Has different passions in their
own.
Thousands of their own
professions that we don't want
to have to limit so
I I just don't see and I just
don't think that it would be
right to have our legislators
have to
Prohibit themselves are us
prohibits them from working on
those passions.
especially again with this as a
citizen legislature you know
One of the reasons why I got
into the legislature is because
eleven percent of the state's
population is native American
but that's not reflected in our
legislature and and as a lawyer
I would be restricted.
From from perhaps doing pursuing
my passion at this was my
passion if if if I were you know
changing professions if if I
were changing practices of law
which occurs a lot of the times
sometimes lawyers get burned
burned out like every other
profession and and I think you
have a.
Everything that we've learned
not only in the legislature but
in our own professional careers
and our own civic participation
whether that be you know
Operator nonprofit boards
community community activities
all of these bands could start.
Limiting us and what we want to
do so I mean I just think that.
Each member would have to think
about for roads that were going
on if this amendment is passed
And I I don't think it should.
The address through this
specific bill
and only in regards to one
fashion I.
Again.
I think we're really limiting.
Lawyers were were tying their
hands
I I don't think that it's fair
it would really be a fundamental
change
to the way the chamber is
operated I think it would also
did her a lot of people that
have education and experience
that.
Are prosperous to to our chamber
and I don't see it as a friendly
amendment thank you Mr speaker
thank you gentlemen.
Thank you Mr thank you lady
Mister speaker I'd like to
combine my moment this for the
with generous Bernalillo
Representative Martinez.
Thank you Mr speaker will
curtail and please yield.
Mr speaker Connor quite
opportune explained money
according to Bateman of.
Even as the yield the more
requires yield for a question or
comment from the German from
Bernalillo who's recognized.
Hi you'll particularly early on.
Thank you Mr chairman and
gentlemen from from San Juan are
you aware of that the
legislature cannot regulate of
some cases that lawyers can
take.
Mr speaker Germany if you could
let me through whatever you're
referring to I would appreciate
that.
speaking German rule five point
six for example like lawyers.
Mr speaker a gentleman.
I'm not familiar with the rules
and I don't see how the future
you.
or the the rules of the state
are of New Mexico implicate the
legislature.
for we set of restrictions on
lawyers beyond what the rules
are.
Well Mr speaker and then I mean.
Okay let's let's let's set that
aside for a minute then but you
know under constitution we have
a very clear separation of
powers
and it seems to me that we are.
Cool Lingling at best
were severely restricting the
powers
one branch of government at the
but I would buy another one and
and I I'm just having trouble
really understanding the purpose
of your amendment
went to me seemed so obviously
unconstitutional.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
for the German from Bernalillo
that that is exactly why I would
like to explain the minutes of
the Stewart responded you Mr
speaker Mr speaker German from
Bernalillo in answering a
question about whether this is a
violation of separation of
powers is this amendment doesn't
restrict the practice of law
this amendment is focused on our
members and the conduct of our
members and so this amendment
it's really about restoring
trust.
That being the been mentioned
many times and and that's my
desire as well this Amanda six
to protect this audible body
from any accusations of conflict
of interest and does nothing
more it doesn't restrict the
outside practice law it only
applies to
attorneys within this the body
is no different than if I'm an
attorney argued if I'm a member
of this body.
And I applied for a position of
the state attorney general's
office I'm not allowed to
continue as a member of this
body and be an attorney of the
state attorney general's office
we clearly recognize that and
this does nothing more the idea
is to appoint a call with
interest the COVID to be
punitive this there is no
shortage of travelers in our
state the solid for affecting.
Of the billing to retain an
attorney.
This is strictly to make sure
that we have legislators are
above board.
that we're above report reproach
and that's what our public
demands.
And I don't see it as an issue
it's not a separate powers issue
of the judiciary doesn't get to
determine the laws but the rules
legislature and so you know in
terms of a direct conflict I for
example and then number of the
state bar of New Mexico.
I'm on the house Appropriations
of finance committee and a
member of this body and so
imagine if I file a lawsuit
against the state agency.
And then that students be half
the size.
Do I want to defend not lawsuit
that Mr laying across.
And risks in voting on my budget
within the House Appropriations
finance committee and and voting
on my budget on the house floor
to me that's an untenable
position to put our state
agencies and and so again this
is just to keep us as members
above reproach I truly believe
that all of our members are
above reproach but we have to
again restore the trust has been
said this this afternoon.
And the confidence in this body
with with the public and that's
all this and then you all it
really says the from a member of
the state bar of New Mexico as
an attorney.
I am not allowed as long as I
serving the formal body for
three years thereafter I'm not
allowed to bring acquired
pursuant to this and again the
idea is just to avoid a conflict
of interest.
Thank you for thank you

Thank you
Mr speaker can you get me to
that point is that president I'm
at the point.
This is a for placing House Bill
fifty four on final passage has
been taken gentlelady to
explain.
Thank you Mr speaker the builder
before you is a modernization of
our current regulation licensing
for barbers and cosmetologists
to ensure that folks who are
looking to be able to obtain
employment in this area have a
streamlined approach to getting
that employment in particular
our corrections departments
currently invested in ensuring
that folks who are seeking to
improve their lives and seek
employment following
incarceration are able to gain
that employment through an
option like barbers and
cosmetology upcoming of armor
hospitality is and this helps
clarify that streamlined
approach working with the actual
RLD department to get to that
point this is directly from the
department to ensure that we can
get gainful employment every New
Mexico and and so that they do
not recidivism this is this is
I'm alright I'm alright with
social justice and being able to
obtain gainful employment with
that Mister speaker I yield.
Okay.
First chair from the Santa and
San Juan representative Lente.
Actually there's a little bit of
confusion about whether these
numbers are so let's clear the
board for the request to speak
and then.
S. as members to put their hands
back up.
Okay.
Representative.
Representative neighbor and if
you wish to debate as I just
need to raise your hand in the
zoom participant list or
requests to speak but.
Thank you Mr speaker.
Well the.
Gentlelady from Santa Fe County
you'll.
Thank you I would happily yields
my friends Representative.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
gentle lady I just want to point
out to my colleagues at the your
this and then the there is a
little bit of a difference
between barbers and hair
stylists in the calls colleges
of from saying that correctly.
In that barbers and both through
an apprenticeship program and
qualify for the other two
applications cannot affect
correct Mr speaker gentleman.
Mr speaker gentleman yes there
is a slight difference but we
see a very low number of
farmers seeking that in lower
lower numbers every single year
so really the true employment Mr
speaker gentlemen is is that is
being sought after for the most
part is in cosmetology region.
Mr speaker Joe lady of a recall
and committee asking the
question The New Mexico for the
the requirements were
satisfactory across the board
because the our cosmetologist of
the hairstylist
are needed.
And the more training than jobs
the actual hands on during the
one year and our partnership
staff program.
Mr speaker gentleman that's
that's correct we're not just
talking about here cutting we're
talking about colors and as we
know during there's many
elements to what they were
missing out on a currently from
from the entire lawn enterprise
that we haven't been able to
interact with in these terms of
COVID Mister speaker channel
and.
Mr speaker jealousy I support
your your bill and I appreciate
your allowing me to suggest the
explain the differences are not
your parents for those.
Here that for the thank you Mr.
Thank you Mr at.
This gentleman from Bernalillo
Sandoval and Santa Fe
Representative Lord.
But now.
There we go technology Mister
speaker I have an amendment on
the desk and I request a meeting
consideration for amendment
number one for H. B. I that is
point two one nine eight one six
point one.
For H. B. sorry fifty four.
Thank.
Tell us the two oh two number.
She did okay sorry for that.
It is up on the website
generating to explaining that.
Yes thank you when I heard this
first out so thank you Mr
speaker and thank you
Representative from Santa Fe
County for bringing forward on
this but I just want to say I am
definitely all about trying to
get our felons back to work and
people who've done their time
back into the workforce and I do
agree with your bill which it
said before when it hit the
committee of the issue that I
had was I started to think about
this bill when it came forward
and.
I understand in the line that
was stricken make it to that
real quick.
I sort of think about how if
we're going to going to section
six one dash seventeen a twenty
one of the NMSA nineteen seventy
eight that we're striking out a
few wines and one of those is
number thirteen the conviction
of a crime and for involving
moral turpitude so I started
thinking about.
I think there should be a
restriction on that building I
don't want to take my
grandparents our grandchildren
to get their hair cut by a child
of a sex offender so I thought
that maybe we should add that
into the and this is why put
this amendment forward because
when you get your hair cut it's
it's there's a level of intimacy
right this person is touching
children they're cutting their
hair they're talking to them and
then I want to step further and
I thought about I don't know
necessarily if I want to have my
hair cut or how my grandma or my
answer anyone else I know get
their hair cut by a registered
sex offender who might be a
serial rapist so then I I
appreciate that you did reach
out to me Representative from
Santa Fe County and that you had
told me and hold me hold on one
second let Phillis forward.
That
under this I want to look at all
the barbers are sorry the
cosmetology's.
There statutes and I looked at
sixty one seventeen a twenty one
and the board shall.
In accordance with the
provisions of the uniform
licensing act that they can
restrict refuse or suspend which
is correct but we're taking out
now.
This shall will no longer be
applicable to the conviction of
a crime involving moral
turpitude management sent me.
It does fall under New Mexico
statute twenty eight two
the power to refuse renew
suspend revoke however the
problem I have with this is that
it doesn't say shall anymore not
says may and so the kind of
music to the discretion of the
board who may not be experienced
enough to understand that people
who commit sex crimes have a
very high recidivism rate there
is no cure for pedophile Leah
and I would hate for someone to
come before the board and say
okay I haven't done this for ten
years but it's just that you're
they haven't caught for ten
years.
So my thought processes since
this is a may and not a shell
that we should specifically
lists people who are registered
as sex offenders to not be
included in being able to do.
Hair cutting and that was my
thought process on this is that.
I just don't want to take my
grandparents our grandchildren
to hair cutter who is a
registered sex offender and have
them touching my grandkids and
that was my thoughts on that
missed Mr chairman
Representative from Santa Fe
County.
The gentleman for Santa Fe is
this a friendly amendment.
Generally importantly this is
not a friendly amendment.
On the amendment.
Gentlelady from Santa Fe
Representative Romero would you
care to accept a do you have any
comment other than anything from
the reformation go to debate on
the amendment.
I I I'm happy to go to debate I
can respond a real quickly just
to inform the gentle lady Mr
speaker I'm just hearing
directly from our our
secretary of corrections just to
clarify how we currently deal
with sex offenders in our state
Mr speaker gentle lady is that
we the criminal justice system
supervises those who are you
know within the confines of
their crime we ensure that they
do not have contact with
children depending on the crime
and of course when they do
register depending on the level
of the fence
within that that arena of sex
offenses that they you know we
may be on a list for the rest of
their lives depending on the and
of course our criminal justice
system overseas that process
overseas of that person but in
any circumstance where were
seeking where someone seeking
employment in particular whether
it be a license with the state
of New Mexico you know depending
on the the crime or the offense
of course that the board any
world you will have the
discretion to make that decision
however of course our
corrections department depending
on the crime in particular which
children are there they're very
sensitive to ensuring that they
are monitored I'm and then
beyond that Mr speaker down
everyone's expected to follow
the law did you generally
excusing everyone's expected to
follow the law post conviction
and and whatever but may have of
what may come next Mr speaker
gentle lady and happy to
continued sealed.
On the amendment the general
Representative Pettigrew.
Thank you Mr speaker and
to so.
General Representative Lord
yield.
Yes I do yield.
Thank you
We we we heard this bill.
perceive that and at the time we
debated this significantly.
And I.
Learned a new definition Mr
speaker the lady
What moral turpitude means today
not what that means in Oxford.
We have this discussion Mr
speaker the we really felt like
this was critical.
The we list sexual offenders.
I agree with with the multitude
of this bill and I think the
whatever we can Mr speaker
totaling
Doing whatever we can to bring
people back into society is
critical and is one of the
things we should focus on.
A minor amendments such as this
because of the way the statue
for written of shall persons
may.
And the fact that we have a body
this is concerned about the
spending sexual offenders really
concerns me significantly Mr
speaker intelligent.
And for this to be unfriendly
number.
I'm I'm from.
Confused as to how.
This is firmly.
We're making we're simply making
a statement.
To make sure that as we address.
Rules and guidelines for barbers
and cosmetologists that sexual
offenders that clearly in the
articles and then our statutes
say may.
Now written into this Mr speaker
speaker and gentle lady
recommended this in such a way
that it shall not be.
I think that's critical.
Mr speaker the lady.
Appreciate the amendment this is
exactly what we said was going
to have a one eight fifty four
the food didn't have this
amendment on there that we would
added here we would have this
debate we would make a
recognizable to to the public.
That.
This bill opens the door for sex
offenders to cut your
grandchildren your daughter your
son here.
Your grandmother's.
Your by your partner.
This is not.
This is a good a member and it
should be heard it should be
passed in this bill should be
passed thank you Mr speaker
thank you Julia Palladia you'll.
The German from Bernalillo
Representative Maestas.
Thank you Mr speaker allegedly
formerly of Santa Santa Fe you
yes I well.
Thank you Mr speaker gently from
side of us and I just
So I don't have the amendment in
front of me Mr speaker lady but
is this is this go to the.
The section of law that the bill
Intel's are you amending the six
better of notification.
What section a lot of Mr speaker
gently from Bernalillo Sandoval
County center where you many
sorry I had on me myself
Representative gentlemen I am
amending the part of what I want
out of this and I had gone
through when I had this written
up so we can do this correctly
hopefully was I wanted just to
add into this bill that on this
part on world tour turpitude
that it would exclude sex
offenders and I'm including also
sex offenders that are serial
rapists as well anybody who
would be on the sex offender
list.
Thank you Mr speaker gently from
Bernalillo Sandoval someplace I
think you answered my question
your amending the cosmetology
and barber Act not the sex
offender registration
notification no I am I doing the
their actual from the excuse me
Mr chair representative I am
doing the actual bill and their
actual portion that they are
striking out which is thirteen
of sixty one seventy one a okay
thank you Mr speaker delay from
low Saval some of it that that
that answers my question so
here's a sort of do stand in
opposition to the amendment for
the following reasons and I.
Get where you're coming from and
I think we all.
Share that concern but it's it's
it's not it should be addressed
in this fashion of as for the
old timers that no Mr speaker
gentlelady from were no Santa
Santa Fe we up in collaboration
with then governor Martinez and
then minority floor leader
gentry I worked and passed the
sex offender registration and
notification act back in two
thousand thirteen with a three
year.
Through your body of work that
corrected some some areas that
were in the two thousand seven
act we have a darn good Mr
speaker and generally we have a
outstanding sex offender
registration notification Act on
the books and here's what we
learned from doing that bill is
that the sex offender
registration is a is a civil
statutory scheme.
It is a civil statutory scheme
that is not meant as punishment.
It is merely a it's more after
the item all show Adam losses
dad's activism and Adam also
acted federal of on all it does
is list.
Those are registered sex
offenders and their
and their whereabouts their
identifiers their monikers their
social media aliases things that
nature and that's it because if
you do anything more than that
Mr speaker gently from
Bernalillo Santa Santa if you if
you do anything more than that
you cross that line of
punishment because these persons
are unless they're on probation
parole they finish their
sentence
If you cross that line of
punishment.
Then the entire sex offender
registration notification Act
falls down like a house of cards
it's deemed unconstitutional and
that and if you believe in the
registry then that leaves us all
less safe and so if you wanted
to amend the sex sex offender
registration notification Act
you can you can do that but
you're risking.
Doing it unconstitutional
because the whole point of the
Act is simply to document the
whereabouts and identifiers of
the persons in the act as I
recall places of of employment
are in the act places of
employment are in the act
places of employment if they
involve if children are are are
at that place of employment are
are are on the website so before
you get
you know your hair do Mister
speaker
delay from Roosevelt's and the
by you can you can search on the
website and and go from there
but.
But I think it it contradicts
the spirit of of these types of
bills.
If someone's paid their debt to
pay their debts we can say will
they pay their debt comma but
what about this percent what
about that person maybe this
maybe that and well this
happened that happened way it's
just it's just contradicting of
what we're trying to do in terms
of public policy.
And and then lastly Mister
speaker delay and I have to say
this because it's just what I
have to say when we when we talk
about sex offenders is that the
guy in the white van is in the
movies.
the the barber and cosmetologist
molesting kids as never
happened.
ninety nine plus percent of the
of the sexual assaults that
occur on our children occur with
within the family unit.
The boyfriend the grandfather
uncle someone who has a
endearing relationship with that
child and has access to the
child usually in the household
so we want to talk about that
because we never want to talk
about that on because nobody
wants to talk about that but but
next time we do talk seriously
about particularly for our
children we need to talk about
just that.
So I stand in opposition and
and.
And will give the same speech
the next seven times the my the
members of the minority bring a
amendment dealing with sex
offenders thank you Mr speaker.
Mr speaker may I speak.
Those not a question Mr speaker.
That semi Count mag reply to
that Mr speaker no questions
first because I'm moving.
Okay.
Representative is referring to
is there for the amendment.
Do I still of the floor Mr
speaker generally need to thank
you out what I wanted to apply
to that is yes sex offenders
absolutely Mister speaker and
Representative that are sex
offenders do happen more often
in the home but I'm talking
about having a sex offender
touch a child this makes me kind
of nauseated at the fact that
that could happen I also worry
about serial rapist who would be
having access to somebody's
loved one and they're asking of
questions like how would you
live how's your day are you
single or married I don't think
those are people that should
have the opportunity to
especially Jon Lester's to touch
children and I personally don't
feel that it's good for public
health and safety to have sex
offenders out there touching
people and getting to know them
intimately and have the
opportunity to then follow them
home and rate them I just want
to point out that on New Mexico
statute twenty eight two dash
for it does say.
Criminal sexual penetration
related sexual offenses so
they're ready are excluding
those people there right there
in this bill.
Twenty eight two dash for part
three.
Where the app employee license
may they have the opportunity to
not give them licensure based on
criminal sex or sexual
penetration or related sexual
fantasy child abuse so they have
already made the stand that
child molester should not be
touching people the problem is
it doesn't say shall it says may
so I still stand on the fact
that I think this is a good
amendment and I think very very
simple to put this in so that we
don't have these kind of people
touching other people Senator
committee for public health and
safety for UConn's thank you
with that I yield.
German from Bernalillo Sandoval
Torrance and Valencia
Representative McQueen.
Thank you Mr speaker Senator LAT
ill.
Yes I do think.
Thank you Mr speaker totally.
So
Last year two years ago before a
year ended Cambridge LED I had
some sex offender registration
the legislation I I've looked at
Florida closely
there is a notorious sex
offender unfortunately who
Have part time residents in my
district it's a matter I take
very seriously and I look at
your amendment.
In my initial reaction was yes I
agree with the amendment.
the this is this is the
something concern
And something that could be
addressed.
And I gotta say I really
appreciate the comments from the
gentleman from rural Leo.
Trying out the distinction and I
just I just want to reiterate
that because I think it is
really important and that's why
I can't support this amendment.
The station is that the sort of
the sex offender registry
registration and notification
act.
Is a notification Act it's not a
punishment and if it was a
punishment.
The it would create problems my
call to question our ability to
enforce it.
So it's not a punishment it's a
notification.
What this bill does is it does
qualify or this bill this
amendment does is it
disqualifies someone from a line
of work.
The fees on that registration.
And if
You know if that's the case I
mean that that's an additional
punishment not contemplated by
an existing law.
You know based on the
notification Act using a
notification Act the other
someone so Mr speaker gentle
lady I'm I'm sympathetic to your
point.
But I think you're amendment is
not for us proper.
If you wanted to prevent sex
offenders.
From engaging in this type of
Profession then Amanda would
need be drafted not that someone
who's on the the the
registration list is prevented
but someone who is committed for
these offenses and then list out
the offense.
And that would be lawful.
But by using the notification
Act to trigger an additional
penalty of the telly the speaker
gentlelady unfortunately I
believe you're amended cross
that line.
and rather than risk of our sex
offender registration framework
I I will have to the instrument.
Thank you Mr speaker generally.
As
Scott.
Thank you Mr speaker will
determine where the yield.
Yes I will thank you.
Speaker generated order.
Professions.
Registration as a sex offender
program.
Registrant from in case you.
Mr chair and Representative yeah
I'm thinking about the working
in the school that that would
comes to top of mind you can't
workers school fears sex
offender.
And Mr speaker gentle lady is
the.
All.
With the requirement to register
as a sex offender.
Mr chair representative I do not
have an answer for that.
Mr speaker and waited with this.
Has metrology board if you will.
Have knowledge.
The.
Perspective.
Employees.
Sexual predator history.
Prior to issuing a license.
Mr chair and Representative.
Well the way it is the way I
understand it right now is that
right now they can say someone
can not get their license based
on moral turpitude I do not know
what they do for a background
check but this is where lies the
problem if we strike out all
moral turpitude how do we know
that they're not going to let a
serial rapist or child molester
slip through the cracks and
become someone who becomes a
licensed cosmetologist.
So Mr speaker in general it is a
requirements for good moral
character has been stricken from
this legislation to become a
corporate cultures Mr Chairman
representative yes it has all
moral turpitude which would
include Mr municipality
everything is been stricken out
of there there is absolutely no
there is nothing about anyone's
moral behavior left in the
cosmetology licensing other than
if they refer back to twenty two
dash four they can if they want
to.
Mr speaker to change or trickle.
for professions or.
The sexual offender or predator
cannot participate in as a
consequence of that
registration.
And.
And.
This notification.
Would you choose to expansion.
Of policy as opposed to
additional.
Mr chair representative so would
agree with that.
Thank you Mr speaker thank you
Jim Harper that's all the
questions are.
The sure
The.
For or Leo.
This.
Generally these motions the
tenement.

and will be back to debate on
the amendment.
The vote is now open.

Senator house bill fifty four
the vote is now open.

Fifteen thousand fifty four was
duly passed the house.
Gentlelady from Bernalillo are
you ready on item eight.
Thank you madam speaker I am
what you get me to that point.
That the record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
House Bill two forty five.
With the emergency clause.
On final on final passage has
been taken and that it is now
subject to debate amendment or
substitution.
Gentlelady to explain the bill.
Thank you madam speaker house
bill forty five is a correction
and drafting the grand
modernization bill a comma was
inadvertently left out of a
section that applies to
utilities in the original filter
out as you may recall the
original bill house bill two
thirty three encouraged energy
companies local governments and
universities public schools and
tribal communities to use
technology to improve and
modernize the efficiency
reliability resilience and
security of the elect our grant
I referenced this and the energy
committee as the COVID bill so
although it's a little bit
different I just want to explain
that and I think it would help
out tremendously
we had to rework the paragraph
because in New Mexico's drafting
style and we had added the
calmer it wouldn't have been
underlined and it wouldn't have
been identified as new material
so
And that's the way the loss
drafted
amendments that are simply
punctuation is not underlined so
that's why it is reworded but
basically it is used to address
the missing comma.
And with that madam speaker I
stand for questions.
There is debate of the gentleman
from Chavez Eddy and Otero
counties.
Thank you madam speaker.
Gentlelady of.
Madam speaker I yield to the
gentleman from all of those
counties.
Thank you
I just in the committee and I'll
ask you again for the record is
the bag Business comma have
value minute change the FIR does
it is the cost of.
The state and then be and
increase in the amount.
Of of
The increase.
Section projects will be subject
to
of any financial gain.
Speaker and gentlemen it does
not change the original F. I. R.
because it was the intent to
have the comma all along so
making the edit to that section
will not affect anything else in
the original bill or the F. I.
R..
Thank you
madam speaker thank you gentle
lady.

gentleman from Lee County.

passage has been taken and that
it is now subject to debate
amendment or substitution
gentlelady to explain the bill.
Thank you madam speaker this
makes the change that that of
basically wireless customers can
now add additional benefits to
their wireless bills should they
want to this modernizes the law
from the nineteen ninety nine
law that we have not touched on
our telecoms to simply allow for
customer convenience in
partnership with our telecoms
industry and with that we Madam
speaker.
There is debate the gentleman
from Chavez Eddy and Otero
counties.
Thank you madam speaker hit we
have a.
I believe there are problems
with the zoom link right now you
might check that we're being
told that there is.
Thank.
Madam speaker
Yes I have we yield to the
gentleman thank you.
Can be a little bit more
descriptive about.
Is this I mean.
With
were definition if I could.
I'd be happy to explain that we
Madam speaker gentleman so
essentially what we are trying
to prevent from happening and
what we want to be.
Lee is that when you receive
your US cell phone bill you
currently just rate you see your
fees you see all of those
different
things on your bill splayed out
as far as you know what your
bill would say currently in New
Mexico where the only state
where you cannot add additional
services to your bill so for
instance I'm a big Mandalorian
fan and is an plus had of an
opportunity to be able to get
that for free well I couldn't
continue that service under
contract current New Mexico law
in the way that our laws written
so this is one line of text
saying that for customers to
authorize the opportunity to add
additional services to your bill
that is all this bill does so
now I can with this log would be
able to add is the plus
seamlessly without any problems
if I wanted to continue to use
that service in the future Madam
speaker of gentleman.
So madam speaker.
what is that this bill.
Would allow a customer.
Of a telecom.
To prescribe additional
services.
The available that they are not
currently charge for.
What is this this has allowed
the legislative bulletin
additional service or doesn't
allow the.
A customer to.
Receive additional services that
they want it faster and more
cost.
Madam speaker gentleman thank
you for that clarification this
is for the customer to opt into
allowing the telecom to add an
additional service so and by no
means would this just be again
with the slamming and cramming
law that we have already on the
books they can never have you
know sneaky charges or anything
in there that's already there
this just allows the customer to
opt in to a service that they
may not currently have and B.
and note on the bottom line that
it's it's added to their telecom
service currently.
Say that Madam speaker.
Cramming and slamming an option
to me so I would just need some
clarification thank you.
Seeing no further debate the
gentle lady to close.
Thank you madam speaker
chronicles forever and I moved
to pass.
We are on final passage of house
bill twenty eight the vote is
now open.
Forty five seconds remaining.
The vote is about to close.
The clerk called the remaining
names.
Representative Anderson.
Yes Representative Anderson both
yes Representative Cabana.
Representative era.
Representative.
The.
The vote is now closed by a vote
of sixty four in the affirmative
zero in the negative.
House bill twenty eight has duly
passed.
Is the gentle lady from
Bernalillo ready to.
Proceed on item three.
You madam speaker I am.
Let the record reflect that all
action necessary for for placing
House Bill fifty one twice
amended on final passage is been
taken and that now and that it
is now subject to debate
amendment or substitution.
The gentle lady to explain the
bill.
Thank you very much madam
speaker house bill fifty one if
enacted would create a single
map based website centralizing
the state's basic environmental
data.
It would then be searchable by
agencies industries and the
public.
It would include information
like freckles and endangered
species occasions of wearing gas
wells where plant data locations
of hazardous waste sites.
We want to do this.
Thank you because it's hard to
figure out the complete picture
of what's happening in the state
if you want to know everything
going on in a certain part of
New Mexico you would go through
many different agencies websites
in order to do that.
So this database with that a
user zoom in on that.
Area of interest in the state
and know right away what's going
on in that area.
It will help the public it will
help agencies to have a
comprehensive view of what's
happening.
Some some agencies are now
hiring landscape planners and
these employees would benefit
from being able to use and
easily searchable map and has
other agency data on it as they
try to make plans and decisions
and the State Land Office
testified that.
To that in our last committee we
also believe based on reports
from other states that.
Industries will also find it
useful industry project
proponents in the state.
Will be helped as they go
through their own complicated
process of securing state agency
permits is modeled on a similar
to all the game and fish
department already has for.
this is data.
Natural heritage program that
you NM manages the the game and
fish site.
And they're willing to take on
this database as well.
Many other states have more
comprehensive not databases like
this incredible part of the
school.
So with that I'm
Madam speaker on December first.
There is debate.
The generally the gentleman from
Bernalillo.
It is working.
Okay thank you.
Madam speaker and gentlelady
from Bernalillo.
As we can the committee one of
the things that I.
Without.
Is the
This database is going to
create.
Point of view are.
Locations if you will or a
location to go to.
To provide some of the data that
people who need wish to do with
the old from the state that have
access to it.
I agree with you that all this
data is currently can be found
in other locations.
On.
Moving to one side.
I believe this problem and.
eight are state of.
Where it could be a PAC these.
Anyway I don't know if you have
a comment on that that was my
Comment on this legislation.
Madam did you want us to yield.
well some of madam speaker
The lady bird will test you.
Yes madam speaker insurance then
I will you know
as as I think you know because I
talked about this in in one of
our committees that share we
amended the bill to create
our protection for both safety
and security reasons we amended
it at the request of industry
and this.
This is really not we've
difference though the subject
matter is different.
Senator sunshine portal.
We're trying to make it easier
for people in our state whether
they be from industry thank you
state government for the public
to figure out what a part of
the.
So there there really should be
no safety or security concerns
if a law is followed here in the
agencies are the arbiters of
what goes on.
The database now and that would
be the second.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlelady from Romeo I just
have a problem that we're making
it easier for some new ways to
do we all of the state I have a.
Thank you madam speaker that's
all my questions.
The gentleman from curry.
Representative Crowder.
Thank you madam speaker will
gentle lady Bernalillo please
you.
Madam speaker I certainly will.
Thank you madam speaker gentle
lady I I just want review the
FIR noticed that your bill did
not get set to House
Appropriations finance
committee.
But yet there's a four hundred
and twenty thousand dollars per
year recurring expense to the
bill along with a hundred
thousand dollars for initial
installation of the processes to
handle the bill so July and
wondered what is still not get
sent to appropriations so they
could review.
The current moment.
We are actually not.
Right.
All of STV R. F. I. R. is
completely accurate there will
be some start up costs we are in
the started costs that we need
proton who is my.
Hello sponsor in the Senate
Senator Mimi Stewart is will be
having the same conversations
with the Senate finance.
Thank you Julia I just find it
the it seems like we're having
bill after bill after bill come
through here.
That have an impact to the
budget and we've got a house
appropriation finance committee
trying to build a bunch of.
And they don't have access to
this information and and I fear
that they will build a really
good function.
And it will be blind sided from
the backside in the.
I I just reached the point where
I had to come in so thank you a
gentle lady for your bill I
appreciated I do believe this
bill should be sent to
appropriations so that can be
built into the budget so the
committee can be aware of the
expenses coming
in the summer comments thank you
madam chair thank you madam
speaker.
The gentle lady from Chavez
Representative is L..
Madam speaker thank you very
much for the gentle lady from
Bernalillo yield.
Yes I yield.
Madam speaker gentle lady thank
you very much I too had concerns
about the funding because right
now the department of game and
fish and they stated that they
really have a tight budget this
year and I know it's going to
cost them money also the
University of New Mexico states
here that it will administer the
database but there's estimating
that would cause to
approximately a hundred thousand
dollars to implement this bill I
do think that we need to keep in
mind that.
We do need to watch agencies
budget and not him was something
that they really cannot complete
do you agree with that.
madam speaker and maybe from
Chavez.
I do agree with that and we have
been in discussions with the
university and you know if
you'll excuse me just a moment
I thank you have failed to tell
the the body that Judy COVID who
is an attorney with the Audubon
society is my expert witness I
haven't had to consult for yet
but I may be talking with her as
we go so anyway I just want to
let you get that in there right
now they do from Travis
yes we it's news commentators
who actually spoke with the
university and we we are we're
having conversations not only
with them but with the
department for the.
Well the because of some of that
fiscal impact that were
mentioned that we
We thought were a little over
estimated.
Well I think it does give me
concerns because I'd I
understand for game and fish is
going to be facing this coming
year as far as their budget goes
the best energy minerals and
natural resources step up and do
so many other projects I know
that their budget is going to be
stretched pretty thin too but
then I'm also reading about the
department of cultural affairs
and they're stating that their
information is called as
confidential and that it does
require a password.
or were you aware of that
information before you had
before you drafted this bill.
I'm if madam speaker
representative if you'll let me
confer with this comment.
Me just say that she has advised
me that amber did revise its FIR
and so let me go to her about
the cultural affairs question
okay.
Okay sorry and thanks for your
patience madam chair many from
Chavez with the cultural affairs
that particular department has
most of its data.
I just because of
confidentiality regarding.
Sacred sites and so they don't
have very much public data and
on this column spoken to
numerous times and I think what
we think is they may have been
confused about what we were
suggesting we weren't suggesting
that anything will currently
reveal the included because
that's the whole point of this
is what already bear.
They are.
I am told that they are working
on I need to create a layer of
data that would not be
It would be a violation of
confidentiality published I
haven't done that yet so there's
probably very little data from
the office of cultural affairs
if that would even be able.
Okay thank you for that
explanation madam chair and lady
from Bernalillo it the.
I was kind of.
Wondering about that.
Mr Madam chairman and
representative from Bernalillo.
How many separate systems do we
have right now that does gather
all of this information do you
have any idea.
And we're I'm going with is is
there not one central database
that.
Gathers up this information
where it can be access or we
just creating different.
Means over this information
should be stored.
I'm going to discuss this I
think I know the answer but I'm
going to consult this comment
okay.
This is what I thought but I
don't perhaps a little more
precise answer all of this
information is available for the
agencies that are included here
in this translation.
It's already available to the
public.
But it's not in order to
replace.
The public for that person from
industry or the other agency
would have to go to all the
different agencies.
And look at their website now if
we put them all together which
greatly simplify the process for
the public for the different
governmental groups or local
governments and for industry.
Okay madam chair and
representative.
How many.
Will it see you're talking about
the department of game and fish.
Energy minerals natural
resources
one of the departments right off
the top of your head and it
doesn't have to be real precise.
you added thrown in here the
department of cultural affairs
one other agencies okay I'm
seeing it now I'm seeing it now
Environment Department State
Land Office department health
game and fish PRC and the
historic preservation division
of cultural arts would there be
any other agencies that would be
required to participate in this.
Madam speaker and lady from
Travis just the ones listed in
the bill okay.
So somebody was doing research
they would have to access
different areas dot just.
You this bill the two were
carried right here the
environmental database they
would have to go elsewhere to
find what different agencies are
doing is that correct.
Madam speaker lady from Travis
do you mean.
If there were somebody either in
industry are for local
government or the public.
We wanted information from the
agency not listed in this bill
yes ma'am let's just say the
water data management act of the
bill.
New Mexico tech has that
particular information.
So they would have to go I'm
just concerned about their.
The dissemination of all these
agencies and where the data is
stored I'm also reading though
that
You want to make the access to
the environmental information
easier for those that are
interested in viewing get for
using it for land management or
developing grant proposals or
even litigation so I'm I'm kind
of curious.
Why it's not all being put under
say the department of
information technology.
Would that be a little
stability.
The the point is Representative
is to take the Bayern mental.
Eight eight eight is that.
That are available by through
all these agencies and just in
one spot so that it's easier for
people to access our it doesn't
really make sense to do it any
other way especially as as
already have the model.
Well I guess my concern there is
but I don't see anything that
might be of information
regarding endangered species
through our water systems
through the Interstate Stream
Commission
What about private property in
the thank you.
Data where would it be stored.
So madam speaker labor which is.
I'm.
I think.
I forgot your question I.
I think you're concerned about
confidentiality and private
property yes ma'am posted on.
That.
The.
Specifically
the university how's that for
its website when it's going to
be protected here is that
They have a huge competition at
all of.
Confidentiality policy the
entry don't want me to read.
But
They have a broad
confidentiality is that we have
a broad confidentiality section
in the bill itself so between
that you and policy concerns of
landowners and industry about
five information hello being
posted are really not valid and
I think I really want to assure
you that we have that
confidentiality section in the
bill of all.
And
there may be some data managed
by
His mother.
So the subsection of the biology
department at UNM as natural
heritage New Mexico and they
have a very strict
Confidentiality that thank you
Thank you have a chance and
there's subject to data use
agreement these agreements
restrict the use of the data and
they also place a time limit on
session.
And data managed by this
department are covered by
agreements such they may not be
released without the express
written permission of the
landowner or the manager and so
All of those things are covered
for the individuals and the
based on situations you
mentioned as well.
Madam chair and representative I
see all of that intersection for
the new material process for
protection of confidential
information of.
Is any of this going to be in
conflict of with federal
mandates.
Madam speaker lady from Chavis
now okay.
Madam speaker of lady from
Bernalillo I do appreciate your
responses I am still concerned
though that we're.
Here we go hand with unfunded
mandates M. freight especially
with our game and fish and the
focus of the one here
Energy minerals and natural
resources and there's where I
have the problem we're wanting
this done yeah we're not gonna
give them the means to be able
to do with Madam speaker and
gentle lady thank you very much
for your time that's all.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Chavis in Lincoln
Representative night part.
Can you hear me.
Okay it is working.
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
county by chairman Judiciary
yield.
Madam speaker I'm not be able to
the children.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentle lady.
Gentle lady
madam speaker gentle lady I too
am concerned and you know that
we've had several discussions
regarding confidential data and
the ability to keep it
confidential.
Your.
Statement a moment to go to the.
Representative from Travis
county said that you thought it
was covered in.
Still having some problems with
that because when I read section
four.
I see that the data that will.
You it says nothing in this
environmental database section
are required disclosure by a
state agency of
lists of things that the the
court disclosure first one is
confidential information.
That is being confidential by
state or federal.
The second with is sensitive
biological information.
To protect species the third one
various information required to
remain a potential for safety
reasons.
The next one is our political or
cultural survey information.
publicly available.
So.
My concern is specifically where
to departments.
First one is energy minerals and
natural resources in the second
one is the State Land Office.
Madam speaker and and
gentlelady.
I'm aware that both of those
agencies.
Have a vast amount of
information that.
Oil and gas companies with which
I'm familiar submits to them.
Some of which is data that is
proprietary that they request
remained.
Confidential for periods of time
or maybe a perpetuity but
certainly some information
confidential for for periods of
time because it creates
competitive the damage for the
company for contains some
proprietary information.
When I read the list of things
that are not or
that are not to be disclosed I
don't see any exception.
For data.
That the company has requested
and has received permission from
the agency to retain as
confidential for a period of
time because it doesn't fit
within these exceptions so your
conclusion that you thought it
had it covered I think is in
conflict with the work papers I
want you to explain how
companies can be assured that
their proprietary information
that's revealed to specifically
to the energy levels of natural
resources the state land office
will remain confidential.
So give me a minute madam
speaker and gentlemen and I'll
be right with you.
Madam speaker.
And our gentleman.
My getting both because of your
system as I was getting before.
I don't know that is my system.
I don't know what's going on
there that's better okay
Madam speaker and chairman.
I think we're definitely covered
the only years read that are
required are listed and none of
that is proprietary and then
instruction do subsection twelve
we amended it to say.
The the only additional data to
be added is what agency what
we're talking about would never
be part of.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
So based on that answer.
Yes the word including on page
three line.
Six.
It is not.
What I would consider the usual
definition of including the.
Thanks suggested years but
probably.
Totally consuming list of
information and if I understand
your your answer.
Basically saying that they have
including women in the mobile.
Welcome shall provide access to
the state's environmental.
The fall.
Including the following.
Is that how to interpret the
word including on page three
line six.
Madam speaker and gentleman of.
Part of the.
Madam speaker and understand
what you said.
Madam speaker and on some of.
Yes.
Madam speaker gentle lady if.
Service you just I suggest that
the word including needs to be
changed so it is very limited
the word.
The suggested were because of
this is all over the.
Is going to be included in the
state's environmental data or
the database but I don't think
the word including the right
word I think it should say being
the following order something
over one because including.
Then the covers those sayings
but there could be other fans
that are consistent and so as
your this as of this moment I
would suggest you look at that
for as it gets over to the
Senate maybe consider some
amendments in that regard.
The
States informal database.
Then
is reflective of certain
information from various
agencies.
I did receive your email
regarding the.
Response from the state land
commissioner's office.
Yeah.
A little bit surprised the the
on page four the woman through
fifteen.
Of all the records and data
maintained by the state land
office for we concerned about.
But those two types of data
because there is a vast amount
of data.
But the commissioner of public
lands is.
the custodian for.
And it seems to a lot of that
information is a very
information about our with the
proponents of this bill would be
interested in having the and
open access to.
All of.
And and so I'm a little bit
surprised that it's limited in
that regard
The other thing.
Madam speaker and madam or
gentle lady that we talked about
and Committee was
The the location of locations of
oil and gas pipeline device but
we can further that was an
important operation but we
retain the locations of electric
electric transmission line.
I believe I made the statement
that the Energy council.
That significant security issues
involving.
Hi for infastructure in the
United States but also
transmission electrical
transmission lines in the United
States and the same concerns
regarding security apply to
both.
Over differences your full
easier to overlook and oil and
gas pipeline because it's
generally very part of the
service
the state.
Most electric transmission
lines.
We.
Visible on the surface and and
so therefore concerned about
security and we're concerned
about.
The
safety of our reserve.
And so I want that work I would
suggest to you that after
transmission lines that are
before yes pipelines.
Are very similar in nature both
should receive the protection
that's afforded by.
However you know the database
there's a mole to all the world
to see where those things are
located because it is truly a
national security issue because
has been our related to the
Energy council members that
serve on the over and over again
the past several years.
In fact the I believe we've
heard testimony from a number of
regional our
Consortiums that oversee those
networks.
How many millions of dollars
they spend each year on cyber
attacks and the ability just one
in severity one transformer
station to basically disrupt
their entire group of and so I
would.
Encourage you to maybe also do
we locations of the work for a
of the electric transmission
lines if this moves forward.
This.
Ask in the.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
is.
On page two one twenty four.
If talks about the state's
environmental data that word
environmental data is really not
so fine and I think it might
help if we have a definition for
the we have the definition for a
bomb Armel database for the not
a definition for environmental
data again your this means
forward you might think about
providing a definition for that
term.
Madam speaker and gentle lady
thank you for dressing.
What questions of the
confidentiality issue and you
have our feel strongly that I
think there's a whole here that
needs to be of Bill.
If you disagree with that but
the I think there may be some
some room for.
maybe some further discussion on
four.
Madam speaker thank you for your
time thank you gentlemen.
There is further debate speaker.
Madam speaker the for the
gentleman says found there's and
I I know you do not ask
questions gentleman for Thomas
we just wanted to remind you
that in the.
Our our community that we share
with your perfect definition on
of you want to get back to you
okay but we we did.
Create a definition for that a
debate.
Madam speaker gentle lady I
didn't quite catch all the but I
think you said that you created
the definition for that.
I am missing that on the.
Our amendments in context on I
just overlooked it I apologize
if I did that the.
And madam speaker and chairman
I'll make sure we can talk about
it.
Okay thank you very much okay
sorry.
Thank you madam speaker and and
thank you gentle lady for
addressing that concern thank
you thank you Sir.
The gentleman from Lee County
Representative Scott.
Thank you madam speaker also
translated from Bernalillo you.
Madam speaker and gentleman from
Lee I'm wondering if you'd be
willing.
Would you be willing to yield to
our to our last night but me
yield to my co sponsor
representative a lady from
Bernalillo Representative Lewis
your question.
I forgot to share the floor with
her and she's been into your
question.
Madam speaker I will certainly
be accepted.
Thank you madam speaker I do you
yield to the gentleman.
And madam speaker gentle lady.
To say.
All of this information is
currently available from the
respective agencies.
Just one second.
When sorry madam speaker and the
gentlemen just give me a minute.
Thank you terms have already.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentlemen so it is my
understanding of that although
this information is available
it's not accessible so in order
for a person to find a
collection of the data that they
would have to search for it
which is not always easy and I
think when public comment with
he can during this bill that the
land over office focus on
available versus accessible so
it's not as accessible as it
could be and that's what this
bill is due.
Madam speaker generated would
you agree with me so.
For those people with specific
projects were interested.
Which certainly have no where to
go to fund to data and so on to
not an extensible if I were
looking for perhaps just one of
these years.
Speaker and representative I
mean I think that would be
limited to quite a few folks I
think you know the general
public isn't really privy to
knowing where information is
ordered and then also obtaining
access to it so perhaps there
are a handful of people that
know that if there
you know particularly
working in a certain type of job
and it's something that they do
repeatedly but to the extent
that that information is
accessible to the public that
would be more burdensome and
them finding out where to go to
get it and then next accessing
at.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
It's my understanding that this
legislation would pull.
Pretty very lawyers say.
From various agencies into one
database.
Five to one comprehensive access
point four two point very to
information that's publicly
available from the street is
that correct.
Could you just repeat the lost
and then I heard everything up
in Thailand.
The purpose of the legislation.
Would be to pull publicly
available information from
various agencies into one sport
into a massive master database
if you will to make it more
accessible to the public.
Madam speaker and gentleman
that's correct I think another
way of looking at it is actually
the state and those entities now
Getting up to speed with
technology this is available and
several other areas and I think
you know now that we have the
availability with technology
it's a useful tool for the
public.
And madam speaker gentle lady.
On point with the database be
indexed.
Madam speaker and gentlemen let
me confer with my expert witness
and that is the same one that
adjourn Casey was using your
equipment take your time
gentlelady.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentlemen so what we believe it
to be once it is established
would be like the other
databases that are
Established by UNM where it
would have a list of years the
map it would have the map with
the list of years and the years
could be turned on and off.
And madam speaker gentle lady
how many years.
madam speaker and gentlemen.
I let me check with my witness
thank you for your patience.
All of those that are listed in
the bill of so we just took some
time to count everything that
was in the in the bill and it
came out to twenty nine so there
would be at least twenty nine
years.
So Mr speaker gentle lady I
could for example.
Class reference poverty rates in
New Mexico.
Location of oil and gas wells if
this legislation becomes law.
Mr speaker.
Madam chair and Madam speaker
and gentlemen let me consult
with my experts.
Take your time gentlelady.
Thank you for and gentlemen so
yes your accurate.
Thank you insiders eight
and in relation what you're
discussing with your doctor
Welling finance deal excuse me
poverty rates of the department
of health does have poverty
rates and so if you turn on both
the poverty more as well as the
oil and gas more so those areas
that are are are are covered in
those years for instance then if
there is oil and gas there would
be a little dot on the map.
Mr speaker gentlelady cities.
yes all this questions are
encouraging to pay.
This wall would want to do.
Madam speaker and
Representative
you know.
I I I think we have a lot of
great research being conducted
in the state I think also we
have a lot of curious
individuals in the state that
information is already available
having at their.
Would
would be available for folks to
say regardless of of your
interest or my interest some
folks would be interested in
something like that it would be
helpful in the areas of research
of something ever came about
Madam speaker gentle lady.
It occurs to me is this for.
In this legislation is grounds
for Christian.
With so then a.
Years of trade.
It has rendered this proposed
database truly unusable.
Okay seriously interested in use
or environmental issues.
Only emissions funding issues
and.
I do not only.
Will be useful.
I believe it's a waste of a half
a billion dollars of taxpayer
funding for.
Information is already available
for those with expertise and the
knowledge to use what chapter
I have one final question and
that is with this effort.
If you will with commercial
projects.
Already all of their.
Speaker and and gentlemen I
don't know if any commercial
products on the market but I
think having the information
available to the public and
something that
we can do if that conflicts with
commercial products I don't see
how there would be
Any problems with that.
Madam speaker gentle lady.
I would.
Thank you for.
Okay just putting the state into
competition with private
providers.
Of this information would
certainly be of interest to them
thank you madam speaker thank
you gentle lady for your
answers.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Colfax curry
Harding quay Roosevelt San
Miguel and you counties
Representative Chatfield.
Thank you madam speaker will
delay the yield.
Madam speaker I yield to the
gentleman from those County.
Thank you.
speaker this is something that I
have worked in law.
We have various mapping years
and.
Some of the stuff that.
Requests.
We get many many are surveys and
when we get those surveys.
The information.
Was not even released to us the
more we were paying for it.
as the people for since the
site.
Rare occasions not be disclosed.
Reputation mapping.
Hi there in the yes we we.
Well we in the meditation us
using a light refraction well
for the various following.
Of those things and more we will
so we'll times we got that from
the federal government.
most of the things that I see
that are readily available all
the gas for real.
From variety of places might be
used to someone wish to do harm.
So I guess my question is what
will be the most appropriate for
the.
Having this.
All right the of lawyers.
And what the meta data
associated to those years your
available also.
Speaker and gentlemen I'm going
to yield back to Representative
Chasey.
thank you madam speaker
gentleman's let me
we suggest I I not sure if I
thought about this in terms of
meditative.
But you asked about the
usefulness of it I think that's
a really good question the
usefulness of it
On
this.
We were thinking at first it was
going to be largely
environmental groups and this
call research.
It turns out that
Agencies are the current using
the current database that gave
information on the
the game into this database
without money on state agencies
use that forty seven percent of
the time.
Health care.
Is the ability of all education
agencies or entities one percent
local governments four percent
federal agencies five percent
non governmental organizations
fifteen percent industry twenty
eight.
So
it turns out in this is what we
had hoped is that it would be
useful to really all kinds of
groups.
Looting here industry.
Over the.
Doing their permitting.
So I hope that.
Health and we have found that to
be true in other states.
In other states
Because I've got so many papers
here I'm not finding it but
other states have found that
industry also has a pretty
healthy child abuse on the
database.
So madam speaker there already I
guess what my question is
Are you in this life all before
the refi I can see the benefit
of having a full election of
this.
Hello world before feel to be
released.
What's the other one all
the required.
Three.
See further debate the gentle
lady to close.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you everyone for the
debate I think it was
useful in revealing and I
appreciated the questions.
again I hope this will be very
useful to all and it really fits
with our our policies of open
this the disclosure and also
trying to make
thank easier for those who are
seeking data that's useful
throughout the state with that

Are you talking about the German
from Bernalillo and Sandoval yes
madam chair madam speaker I am
ready.
Yes thank you.
Give me that point madam
speaker.
Let the record reflect that all
action necessary for placing
House Bill seventy five as
amended on final passage has
been taken and that it is now
subject to debate amendment or
substitution gentleman to
explain the bill.
Speaker thank you members of the
bill actually does something
relatively simple requires a an
explanation it removes hospitals
from the medical malpractice act
on to be clear this is going to
be part of the discussion it
removes currently twenty six
hospitals from the medical
malpractice act twenty four
which are multi billion dollar
corporations and restores the
act your per moved back to its
original purpose and now the
explanation.
The act as originally intended.
Why was passed in nineteen
seventy six.
Because of a crisis crisis wise
independent doctors it is
doctors that we're not hospital
employees and not hospitals the
independent doctors could not
get liability insurance so they
sat down with the patients and
their advocates and they worked
out a deal.
And the deal was that the
superintendent of insurance
would administer fund these
independent doctors would
contribute to instead of paying
premiums to insurance companies
they would pay into a fund
complications compensation fund.
Patience you can turn would
limit their recovery it would be
capped.
That one was intended then
patients made a sacrifice in
terms of how much they would be
compensated for the doctors
these independent doctors and
could not get insurance we're
able to get insurance.
In nineteen ninety two they're
all in the fund ran into a
little bit of trouble.
They revisited the fund so net
hospitals by the way no
hospitals joined the funded that
point the doctors the patients
stated about the doctors for
them limited to three claims.
In any one year the doctors
could only have that fun go to
that funds say we like to pay
these patients from some medical
mistake that we made for their
injuries and damages a maximum
of three times that point it
became clear for doctors I mean
for doctors that are making
three claims a year that's
pretty bad drive but hospitals
that's the week in the year so
hospitals needed not apply and
they did so that Juan remain
solvent and in good shape.
Until two thousand nine when the
then superintendent of
insurance.
Right in the first hospital.
A couple things are important
for the members to understand.
Hospitals were let in without
that three claim limit even
though the statute should very
clearly three claims the
superintendent north at the
hospitals could make as many
claims as they want.
And even though the statute
clearly says that the hospitals
would provide sufficient
information to do an actuarial
study so that the hospitals we
would be able to the
superintendent would know how
much to charge obstacles
hospitals in New that either and
the information we can talk
about this in the discussion
that would have been required is
there claims information.
Do you live in shoes what it
claims outstanding how much of
they had to pay we you get auto
insurance your auto insurance
company whether you know it or
not such the rates based on your
actions no different with
hospice.
To this day the superintendent
does not have that information
Los.
Once the first hospitals lady
and.
A definition store in rocks.
First time is fun was running in
real deficits.
Any when you went from a two
million dollar surplus for the
hospital was in.
To every year then chance that
frontier has been running a
deficit.
And when the next superintendent
not our currency pertinent the
next superintendent started
leading in the rest of the
twenty five hospitals the
deficit is been shooting up from
two thousand fourteen at about
thirty five I'm sorry two
thousand sixteen about thirty
five million dollars to today
it's over fifty five.
The important thing to
understand is when the hospitals
relating in there were two
groups that they didn't talk to.
I didn't talk to the independent
doctors before letting them in
to see how they feel about it.
And they didn't talk to the
patients.
The important thing to note is
the hospitals don't need this
far they just don't they can go
out and get independent
insurance the doctors and
patients are captive agents
Fund.
What's happening is as the
hospitals are making more more
claims on this fund.
Independent doctors are having
to pay more more in the last
five years your premiums have
shot up forty nine percent.
That's as compared to prior to
two thousand nine between two
thousand two and two thousand
nine there were no increases in
premiums but since the hospitals
but leading into thousand
sixteen we're talking about a
forty five percent surcharge and
hospital and I'm sorry
independent doctor.
Before I go to questions madam
chair.
I want to talk to my democratic
calls specifically my ****.
Think about what it is we do up
here.
At the end of the day what we
try to do with the consistent
principle we I think all is
crying to.
Is to try to level the playing
field between those without
power and those without.
Think about and making things
fair.
Progressive tax structures to
make things equitable.
Minimum wage to the people going
to have a living wage.
Affordable health care so that
people don't have to worry about
going bankrupt because your
healthcare bills you too high.
Quality education so that they
can't afford private schools the
people that we care about the
quality education sending their
kids to public school voting
rights so that people have
people access to.
There is no greater disparity.
And the difference between the
powerful and the powerless in
this bill.
The power Welch over many of you
heard from.
Patients that have been
devastated.
Four kids by medical negligence
by mistakes for which they
should be compensate.
And they are among the most
disadvantaged in our society.
Yes to to to in many situations
without recourse a lifetime of
pain or injury.
Versus multi billion dollar
come.
And what's happening is without
consulting with the patients
these patients for subsidizing
these multi billion dollar
companies and why.
So the multi billion dollar
companies can get a better deal
so that they can make a bigger
profit.
There is no greater disparity
between the dispossessed the
powerful and the power.
And with that madam chair I will
stand questions.
I'm sorry madam speaker.
Are there is debate the gentle
lady from Santa Fe
Representative Romero.
Thank you madam speaker does the
gentleman yield.
I yield to the gentleman from
Santa Fe.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen for bringing this
forward I
saw this bill in a different
form two years ago and it
started in it for first and
foremost in my committee and the
consumer public affairs where
there are a lot of questions
when we when I entered that
committee that day it was all
doctors and all lawyers and I
had a hard stress that.
madam speaker gentlemen I was so
concerns that when you talk
about the little guy who was
actually winning here and I was
quarter by both sides to be
quite honest madam chair
gentlemen it was it was a really
tough moment for for me
committee that day because I
wasn't understanding what was
happening here and spoke with
the folks who were advocating
for this and I was like what is
this bill about what are we
actually trying to do here
because it seems like both the
doctors and lawyers are yelling
at each other and madam speaker
gentlemen it came down to the
fact of this is a patients
rights bill and I said show me
where that is so that we can be
clear about what that means and
madam speaker gentlemen it was I
think this is about the fact
that currently if you are in a
situation where your family
member your loved one the person
who may have been hurt by
somebody in a in a negligent
manner
they currently cannot pay for
the wrongs that have been done
to them madam speaker
gentleman's.
And I was like show me the
patients show me the people who
have been affected by this
because currently it sounds like
only the powerful people are for
him today Madam speaker
gentlemen.
And what we saw in two years
later in understanding this
problem in understanding why
this is something that we have
to fix in our state Madam
speaker gentleman is the fact
that these hospitals in
particular which is what this
bill affects which is what
you've described Madam speaker
gentleman is that they are
capped currently at a level that
does not allow for New Mexican
families those who have been
affected by something in a
malpractice situation where they
go through all of the
hoops of getting a verdict from
a jury that says this person may
have been injured to a level
where they can't have a quality
of life of where they lost a
loved one where you can't get
that person back and what
meanwhile these hospitals are
those that have insurance there
those that are covered with the
cap Madam speaker gentleman now
I understand that if you have
damages over six hundred
thousand dollars and we know
that how do you pay for a
lifetime how do you pay for a
loved one that has had injuries
that go well beyond that into
earnings and potential life and
potential earnings that they
could have had capped at that
level for an enterprise like a
hospital Madam speaker gentlemen
I now understand why we need to
do this and why they shouldn't
be held to that same standard in
our law madam speaker
gentleman's so this was a a
huge.
understood I undertaking for me
to get to where we are today
madam speaker dominant
understanding why this is so
necessary Madam speaker
gentlemen this is
the right thing for patients
today I want to get into some of
the data regarding that to help
clarify why this this matters
and hopefully clarify through
this process madam speaker John
to on for for where I came about
but for the body to understand
what's going on because I was
really concerned that I would
never have good health care
again if we would do this that
that hospitals and practitioners
in my area who came to speak to
me Madam speaker gentleman would
now be heard or hindered by this
change so if we can help clarify
that then speaker John and I
don't want doctors in my
district hospitals in my
district to worry about what's
going on and I want to know that
there are protections in place
for them and what's happening
currently in our law but what
this what this change happens to
to be seeking after
that said madam speaker
gentleman.
What happens when hospitals
leave this funds we've heard
that this fund will crash and
burn that these are are are
essentially the the key
components of this fund that
currently exists what happens
when they leave madam speaker
gentle and.
Madam speaker I thank you.
I thought I I should know better
Madam speaker Gen lady let me
try again
all I am joined I I do want to
say by right partners who's
returning your in Albuquerque is
familiar with this area and
also.
Often is
insurance expert former
superintendent commissioner not
New Mexico was familiar with
actual stations dealt with them
as work with you portable Care
Act and has been significant in
its implementation of some joint
by those two gentleman one
remotely one not
but let's yeah let's go through
the reality is the reality of
this is what is driving the
current deficit are hospitals
which driving the increase in
premiums are hospitals why do we
know that do we know that from
actuarial studies now we know
that from the history we know
that between two thousand and
two and two thousand nine when
there were no hospitals in the
medical malpractice act there
were no surcharge increases on
independent physicians in two
thousand nine one St Vincents
was allowed in any of the
following year there was a ten
percent surcharge imposed on
positions in two thousand
sixteen and two thousand
seventeen as more hospitals were
lady in year after year which
nine percent surcharge against
position in two thousand sixteen
nine percent surcharge yes
physician independent positions
in two thousand seventeen twenty
percent surcharge in two
thousand twenty twenty one
percent on a surcharge I'm sorry
nine percenters charge in twenty
twenty one going up forty nine
percent in five years why did
all this happen because
hospitals two things or drive.
Hospitals are on limited in
terms of
the number of claims they can
they can year senators so they
don't know all really what to
expect and because the hospitals
have never to this day.
Why did the necessary
information to do the actual
start and that would include
things like how many claims have
been made what's been paid out
what's still pending what's been
closed what litigation costs
none of those things the
superintendent out so not
surprisingly in two thousand
nine for St Francis was leading
in the patient's compensation
fund that's the funded doctors
contributed to I had a two
million dollar surplus after two
thousand nine that deficit then
the deficit started when the
hospitals related fourteen
million in two thousand fourteen
by two thousand sixteen thirty
five million by two thousand
twenty fifty five.
So the bottom line is is that
the hospitals because they have
unlimited claims and provided
unsubstantiated information
information is not valuable to a
real actuarial study because
that's happened the deficit of
the funds exploded and the
doctors are taking the heck and
here's what people need to
understand I don't think you.
Yes hospitals are more realistic
we charge a premium.
Two things people need to know.
One.
Patience continue to subsidize
these multi billion dollar out
operations that don't need this
insurance all of them have
private insurance there's never
been a crisis possible that's
number one and number two the
fact is when the premiums get
to large hospitals will need.
That's the real rob with what's
going on the independent
positions need this fund they
can't get insurance elsewhere
the patience of these
independent positions need these
doctors to have insurance the
hospitals don't need it there
are only in this fund because
they're getting a better deal
than they would on the private
market that's why they're in the
fund so that's what's driving
this we know that from
historical data that's been
provided to us frankly to every
we know exactly what's going on
we just don't know what the
claims are against the hospitals
nor will we ever know that
hospitals have been provided and
they will thank you madam chair
thank you generally.
Madam speaker German thank you
for that.
So in that case scenario Madam
speaker gentlemen if there was a
way to keep them in the fund why
wouldn't we just charge them
more madam speaker gentle and
why can we just keep them in
that why put it into the open
market why is this a better
option than
thinking about keeping them
there.
Madam speaker gentle.
The longer we wait larger that
the this is going to be you know
running a deficit now that's
what the independent physicians
are worried about but the fact
is we don't know we covered or
not yet but we know for sure
that is just going to give our.
That you know bank of do do is
gonna get bigger and bigger over
the years every year we wait
that deficit gets bigger and
bigger and the hospitals we.
Because we charge them a fair
premium look what that deficits
come look like the independent
positions the ones that are
really going to be hurting
that's why farmer mac in the who
is the former head of the
American medical association
well respected cancer position
in Albuquerque has been such an
advocate for this bill because
she understands getting these
people out of the hospital the
the I'm sorry these these
hospitals out of the system is
what will save the independent
positions from premiums that
when they get too high these
hospital stay and they will they
will have two choices they will
be there have to leave the state
or they will no longer be
independent positions they'll be
hospital employees and what's
going to happen then as
everybody's going to pay the
price for.
Thank you madam chair thank you
Representative.
Thank you madam chair thank you
representative and and for
helping me understand that there
are options and what those may
be and why you know the the bill
that's being a funded by the
patients right now is actually
in what's not being calculated I
think that's what's so important
for us to understand is that
were footing the bill into the
New Mexican family that is
dealing with the the outcomes of
what this is produce madam chair
representative I just have a
excuse me gentleman.
The only other question that I
have is about that worry about
our doctors Madam chair
representative we've heard from
different folks about the worry
that this would hurt the the
pockets of our doctors the the
families of our doctors initial
Kerr encourage lawsuits against
them against you know what
they're doing with or without
you know the protection that we
currently have Madam speaker
gentlemen is is it going to
encourage more lawsuits are is
now malpractice fair game for
everybody who goes to the
hospital because we're removing
hospitals for doctors in those
practices madam speaker
gentleman
madam chair and I'm sorry to say
that madam speaker I apologize
madam speaker gentle lady and
is insurance for instance now
this does nothing to change the
burden of proof for what's
required independent doctors
need this I thank you and
nothing changes with respect to
the standard proves you can't
just go and see your doctor
there is still the protections
of the statute common law and
caps and we're not changing the
fact is is that.
Patience realism are willing to
work and have years with you and
issued one hundred be able to
have insurance but nothing
trumps the standard of proof for
the elements of the malpractice
claims change with respect to
this bill.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you generally.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen those are the big
worries that I keep hearing in
my community
we you know different people in
our community go to different
hospitals for different reasons
some go up to Los Alamos New
Mexico to the south side I don't
have any hospitals specifically
in my district so everyone has
to go elsewhere for that however
we need to make sure that those
who do seek out that health care
are protected and as far as not
only what happens when they
enter the building but also for
those that are inside the
building madam speaker gentlemen
I just I'm grateful for it for
you clarifying that look forward
to the continued debate but
having been through this for now
three years and helped and
worked with
the and wrestled with the what
this what this bill does and and
what the intent was but also
with the outcomes will be Madam
speaker John I think this is
better for New Mexico better for
the folks who unfortunately have
to read the the unfortunate
mishaps and
the extreme situations that
we've heard in our committees
you know we don't want to at all
target anyone with this bill
Madam speaker gentleman this is
about doing the right thing for
the people in our communities
and making sure that should
anything happen they're
protected and that's what's
important to me is the people in
my district madam speaker
gentlemen thank you so much for
bringing this forward and for
clarifying how this works.
The gentleman from Chavez
and Lincoln representative
divert.
So.
Thank you.
Madam speaker.
With a gentleman from Santa Fe
County yield.
I don't think madam speaker I
would be.
We chose to.
Thank you madam speaker but the
gentleman.
Madam speaker and.
German and Canadian we spent
quite a bit of time.
Discussing the time line with
you and your ex for.
Regarding the issue that you
raised your first started that
was the original intent of the
bill.
But the testimony of in our
judiciary.
Timeline when something like
this.
We have the act passed in
nineteen seventy five.
There was a parent and member of
in the nineteen nineties that
allow hospitals to join.
In this
I should compensation fund of
medical malpractice that.
In two thousand in the first
hospital joined.
Two thousand fifteen or sixteen
a number of hospitals came under
the
Act do you recall that testimony
Speaker and gentleman.
Madam speaker in general yes if
I can correct.
So
I I get this is this is for me
interesting I get that from my
expert on the bus a little bit
so it actually the hospitals
were initial in the act they
were there nobody thought about
it they were there in nineteen
seventy six in nineteen ninety
two is correct.
That the addition was made to
limit because the fund couldn't
handle more than you know that
the word about solvency the
funds they limited it to three
claims a year so you had a
really bad doctors you could
just repeatedly go back to fund
that really kind of hospitals
and and the hospitals and I for
anyway because the whole intent
of the act was to help these in
infants physicians hospitals for
information about it it really
wasn't until two thousand nine
the first hospital was let in
without the permission of
receive and the discussion with
either independent physicians or
patients of Iraq.
And then in two thousand sixteen
and seventeen another twenty
five hospitals we're ready and
with the same kind of unlimited
claims deal without adequate on
data supporting kind of
consistent are are even reliable
actuarial study and we are we
are at today.
I hope that helps Madam speaker
tell.
House speaker and gentleman.
I believe for your correction
you know is that exactly where I
was going
to come look at the legislative
history of this act.
And health bill twenty nine.
In the thirty second
legislature.
Second session nineteen seventy
six.
What is an active
that bill.
On page one of one twenty three
AM that many references
throughout that bill.
Include a working hospital so.
Madam speaker and members of the
one hospitals were part of the
staff.
Hospitals were part of the
medical community that have the
opportunity to take advantage of
the medical malpractice are.
Hospitals have regionally take
part of that because of whatever
reasons were curry maybe they
were.
I'm sure that other mechanisms
to protect their souls but very
from the very beginning.
What part of the medical
malpractice that.
And so.
The statement that we need to
get back to the original intent.
I think that resonates we're
with merry there's because I was
up for the impression that there
was some.
The later on to bring the
minimum.
If they were part of the group
that could take advantage of
this bill from day one.
For the very drafting of the
bill that was considered in this
very chamber.
And so the the the idea of it
that hospitals were.
And so madam but and work part
of the original Act is yes
not accurate I'm glad you clear
that up.
The issue is also you have.
It's pretty simple.
We have a.
Additions.
compensation fund.
That is.
Are down right now I believe
it's fifty six million dollars
in there about.
And the statement was made that
that fifty six million dollars
as a result of the hospital to
be in that.
But then I received some
information that reflects the
the.
deficit of the DCF has grown but
the overall percentage of the
annual service charges of the
benefits it reflects a lower.
Right that was before what the
hospitals started
being admitted and so my my
question
Madam chair representative with
that.
Statement that has been made to
committee do you find that to be
true.
Madam speaker Representative
amount understand your question
and I'm not sure I do the true
statement as there was no gaps
before the hospitals will let in
he was running a surplus you
know that historically once the
hospitals were let in first
hospital definitions for and
they increased where they are
now on anticipate increased
exponentially once the hospital
once the slot of the twenty five
hospitals were let in and there
is no evidence of that yes it is
anyway going down an independent
positions I sat as seen in the
last four years the forty nine
percent increase in there for.
I mean they they ran seven years
between two thousand two and two
thousand nine no surcharges and
all so I don't know anybody can
say if you just looking at the
historical fact that eight years
of the hospitals that are both
driving the deficit and
surcharges that are being placed
on independent position.
Madam speaker and gentleman it
could be a variety of factors it
could be a factor the hospitals
to very important a majority of
the positions yeah most
communities.
That probably was not the case
twenty years ago or more that
could be.
The claims are being committed
against the approved as well and
maybe
more more medical malpractice
actions are being prosecuted the
data could be a variety of
reasons I'm not going to
speculate as to what those for
but the statement has been made
by Senator medical societies to
maybe.
It's hospitals driving up the
the budget for at least two
years
maybe telling both the whole
story from a question that of
the.
In fact the Madam speaker
development.
In a position that has contacted
me from my community is very
concerned about this bill this
yes removing hospitals from the
of thanks of a compensation
fund.
That hospitals are notable part
of the fun now and that is
through their contributions that
is going to resolve the problem
that there are right now because
a majority of the money coming
into the station Papen station I
was coming from hospitals and
their pain the huge of
percentage of the funds that are
going into this and the concern
of the doctors in my community
for a full list bills are not in
the fund.
Two things are gonna happen.
Forty seven percent forty nine
percent increase in ten years I
believe we were your statement.
That's going to be a drop in the
bucket compared to be increased
available in the face of the
hospitals are not present.
Second.
Concern that.
It's going to.
But it's going to jeopardize
their ability to practice
medicine
you Mr because of the
affordability of those rates and
so have expressed tremendous
concerns with me and I think
they have expressed tremendous
concerns
the number of people around the
state.
And I think because of those
concerns of Porter tension madam
speaker and gentleman.
With the help of the journal.
Representative February
fourteenth.
Albuquerque journal has an
editorial the talks about this
very bill.
The talks about the concerns
that doctors in New Mexico have
expressed.
At its conclusion of the
editorial board of the
newspaper.
Sept thank you the hospitals out
of this cool.
Yes
Sir.
Impacted by the the there's
maybe a another building forcing
its way through the Senate right
now that is a preferable way of
maybe addressing this and that I
haven't seen the bill but but it
talks about the need to tackle
the deficit.
The talks about for the for
hospitals to remain in this poll
that would be considered too
cool for school health we
probably probably by the end of
future years
you.
And so.
Thanks for that this bill is
basically one of four.
The trial lawyers.
Good for patients good for the
whole community and certainly
not good for the for the
hospital so.
Madam chair or madam speaker and
chairman.
All right I believe that it is
incumbent upon us.
The the the the problem that I
think.
why is that we can fix this
problem.
Yeah the
Representative Saylor fate is
correct about the staff not be a
that is sufficient staff way to
go pick the dress that issue
maybe the cat may be just as
we're doing that elsewhere on
other things rekreasi.
caps for this amount because
we're recognizing that inflation
as
Maybe maybe those.
I use that were instituted
twenty thirty years ago.
Reflective of the basement
Development.
I'd be willing to look at the.
I would also think that they be
having.
Well the hospitals of their
actual real data
reviewed and having babies to
reviews going on right some
staff.
What thank you know hospitals to
obtain a majority of the money
into the patient compensation
fund I'll.
Going to do a couple things.
That is not going to be
available to.
For the fund for the claims that
are being made against the
federal.
Okay.
The whole going to publications
that have occurred from prior
malpractice actions but.
The the the the people who.
Receive this thank you cap with
respect to the the damage.
What's not staff yes thank all
going all of which variations
of medical.
Cost for that person for their
entire life.
And as I this call before to pay
those future medical costs.
And so if the hospital zero you
still have those.
Cost having to be in for
the doctors having to there are
a hundred percent of.
In the future claims up to the
staff for
Medical damages that are that
are creating.
So.
The only
Resolution that one can think of
is that.
People.
provided tremendous amount of
money going out of their pocket
for sure this fun to meet those
obligations and to.
Hopefully get the deficit down
to zero and Bella.
I believe we heard some
testimony from.
The superintendent of insurance
to I believe publicly is also
expressed some concern with
this.
I think he.
I have some ideas as to how to
handle.
And thank you hospitals out of
this fund.
Thank you know a little bit out
of the medical malpractice act.
There's more I called forty two
goals with the superintendent
would like to say and so I would
I would encourage
Madam speaker representative I
would encourage your colleagues
to.
Vote in favor of this let's see
some other ideas if the table
if we can tackle the real
problems that or
of proving because of not only
the purposes of this this the
bill for Ambrose
but we also address the issue
maybe raised by the
Representative from Santa Fe
County with the Madam speaker
and gentleman thank you for of
fund to discuss legislation I'm
sure we'll have the others who
have other
angle so that thank you
hospitals well is.
Are you sure worry of bankruptcy
in this fun thank you madam
speaker thank you government.
is further debate the gentle
lady from Bernalillo county
Representative Armstrong.
Thank you madam speaker and will
the gentleman.
from the Santa yield.
Madam speaker I will yield to
the gentle lady from Bernalillo.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman the gentle lady from
Santa Fe talked about the faces
of.
families and and those who have
suffered a malpractice claims
and.
I just have to tell the body I'm
one of those claimants.
On behalf of my daughter as a
minor child.
And.
It's some of.
It's a lifeline to be able to
have to.
Have
Because the result of a
malpractice claim when you're
faced with a.
Lifetime of.
Injury.
And.
As many of you know and have
heard me talk about and and no
air and we've struggled with
this for with her cancer for a
long time.
And she probably had at least
ten years when she was finally
diagnosed
And I did make a claim.
On her behalf for failure to
diagnose.
So it is it's real to patients
and families.
When there is a real harm done.
And so my my
Desire first and foremost is
that this patient compensation
fund survive and be able to.
Provide that support to other.
Of victims and families.
So my question for you Madam
speaker and gentleman is can you
talk me through a little bit
more about what happens
with.
The
The fund and what would be
available for for patients or if
it and the plane coming in of
from a hospital after they've
left the fund.
Yeah.
madam speaker gentle lady got a
couple of things a number one
once they are out of the funds
under this bill with the
superintendent of insurance is
at at his request we amended
that bill in Judiciary that they
will no longer be qualified
health care providers as of
January one twenty twenty two
which means no more claims from
hospitals
You know and I I want to be
clear about a couple of things
one
the reference was made to future
hospital expenses by the
Representative from Travis
county the fact is right now in
terms of pay else whether paying
medical bills as they come to
our as far as we've been able to
determine the fund total as for
claimants for when they're
paying out future hospital bills
medical bills drive models rest
of all the and a new piece of
the mock so they're taking care
of so as a practical matter what
we're dealing with one stop
schools are out.
Claims that existed before and
so we're trying to do stop the
bleeding I mean to using format
four medical malpractice context
but that's what we're trying to
do is is is get them out if they
want to set up a separate fund
for the hospitals are separate
act the hospitals that are not
captive to these funds because
anytime the premium gets too
large they can we find that's a
different deal with the idea of
having hospitals you can leave
anytime this premium gets too
high along with independent
positions that need this funding
of New York Mexico and patients
that need this funding because
they want their doctors to be
insured that's what's
unsustainable that's what
ultimately is going to break the
bank we've got to get these
hospitals.
Thank you madam speaker
generally.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman
My my other concern is our
independent positions and having
adequate
which we don't have adequate
already but providers in the
state.
And with those premiums going up
and up it is a significant issue
for individual providers which
is one reason why I think you.
See so many in the last few
years in particular
Selling their practices to the
hospitals joining the hospitals.
Of it hi I believe it's a
contributing factor.
So thank you it's this is the
this is a tough.
decision it I mean the the
bottom line is madam speaker and
gentleman.
The hospital shouldn't abandon
it even whether they were in the
act from the beginning or not
they didn't come in the oven and
join it because it was if they
were limited to three.
claims a year like the provider
individual providers are they
could do that so they went out
of their insurance and have
maintained that and so those
claims that they pay out of
their other insurance aren't
capped at six hundred thousand.
Like this is so now they can
come in and cap each claim is
six hundred thousand and do as
many as they.
As they need so is this it is a
good deal for the hospitals but.
Anyways thank you for your work
on this I know it's been a tough
and there's multiple ways maybe
to skin a cat but the bottom
line is the hospitals need to be
separated from the individual
providers I believe.
to protect the protect the fund
for the future so thank you
madam speaker and gentleman
it this is indeed
has had some hits close to home.
About what the impact is when
when there is
When malpractice has occurred so
thank you for your work on this.
There's further debate the
representative the gentle lady
from Bernalillo county
Representative Thomson.
Thank you madam speaker with the
gentleman from Bernalillo and
Sandoval you'll.
On Madam speaker I will yield to
gentle lady from Bernalillo.
Thank you madam speaker and
chairman.
This is emotional for me.
Might might the gentle lady who
spoke before me.
It's family but not not well I
will tell our stories so I will
tell you first that the reason I
ever ran for the seat was to be
a voice for the little guy most
of you know I have a fund with
significant autism and I have
worked with kids with
disabilities for over thirty six
year.
And I was involved in a lot of
community groups around
disability issues and at one
point we decided we needed
someone in Santa Fe who knew
what it was like.
And so I looked around and said
okay who's it going to be and
nobody sent me so I said okay
it's going to be neat so that's
why I'm here I'm here to speak
for the people who don't use the
get hurt and let me just tell
you a little bit about three
different instances just in my
immediate family and they're
very emotional and I apologize I
will cry.
So we'll start with my own story
I had a knee replacement surgery
in two thousand eleven.
And now.
Everything went well I woke up
the following morning I was
actually feeling good because
the payments were still really
kicking in my needs I was
feeling pretty darn good.
Matt on my face and I didn't I
knew that it was I used to be
packed at the time so I just
assumed that was the path I woke
up my husband brought me my
favorite breakfast I took off
the mask.
And the next thing I knew there
were ten people in my room my
husband who is African American
was white as a sheet.
I didn't know what happened what
happened was I was not supposed
to take off the map the math
with keeping me alive but no one
bothered to tell us that.
I coded.
O. two saturation work down in
the forties which is
inconsistent with light.
Luckily my husband was there and
he got people in.
And they brought me.
And I hello for the month I was
on oxygen I was eight years I
would.
I got transferred to the
intensive care unit the person
who was taking care of the did
not speak English except to say
it's not time for payment so no
matter what question I asked her
she said it's not time for
payments and of course I was
always ready for my and that's
what it was hi I I my husband
was there if you wasn't there
I'm.
I don't know how long it would
have been before someone came in
to provide the my guess is I
would have been gone we didn't
do I had other things to worry
about it that I might find the.
Next I'll come to my mother to
the wonderful woman she was a
nurse for fifty years he
delivered she was in on the
delivery of hundreds of banking
at the Indian health service
hospital in Crown Point she was
an incredible nurse she knew she
wanted to be a nurse from the
time she was.
Practically a topper.
Care of many other people when
she got a little later in her
life the
we got a bottle of structure and
ended up in the hospital.
And we I'm one of seven children
six girls and one boy and three
of us are medically trained so
we learned very very early on
that you do not leave your loved
one in a hospital without a
medical person we had three
family members who could cover
those yet but we do it.
And one thing that happened to
my mother issue have a seat
hallucinated when they came for
certain drugs in Oregon which is
an anti nausea for a.
So they gave it to her and she
hallucinated that my brother in
law have right and she was she
was she was in her seventies she
was scared to death sure my
brother in law.
And so we were with her and the
nurses kept coming in with
federal we can't think right on
her chart she can not and then
again and if we weren't there
they would continue to give her
an again and had horrible.
That wasn't the worst I mean
that was that with luckily we
had three family members who
could be there and be her
medical power of attorney for
lack of a better word most
families don't have one much
less three.
A family get get of badly
treated by hospitals.
And then the last one.
Is my brother I'm I'm child
number I use numbers that he was
the only boy among the seven of
us.
And in February
Thank you in February two
thousand eleven we got a call
that he had a heart attack the
all of the sisters rushed to the
hospital.
And now he he lived in Rio
Rancho with the prime taking him
to the hospital welfare.
And the they decided they
couldn't care for him so they
transferred him to a hospital
here in town all the sisters
were there waiting when he
arrived by transport.
And now we sent their with their
faces the nephews you have three
kids and a granddaughter who
loves you the staff
and he came in and they thank
you the surgeon came out and
said well you know he had a
heart attack I would hope you
would wake up but he did.
What I didn't know if he had
insurance or not why use the
first it is hard than I would
normally have had because I was
trying to save that money.
Well that's that's just wrong on
so many levels but that that's
that's minor.
So when he came out of surgery
my sister in law his wife went
in to see him.
And that she came back out and
see that you know he got a black
guy and he's got a giant lump on
the back of his head and I
thought he's in a hospital bed
how can use the alarm on the
back of it so I went in indeed
he had a guy yeah right thank
all sides at that point lump on
his it that you could be with
you laying in the bed.
So we all when is talk to a man
in a to a time and and everyone
went home except his wife and I
I stayed with.
And we watched him all night.
And we watched blood dripping to
want to.
What.
The all of that work your
larger.
What is.
What about.
What what what what.
She was the only one who can
fit.
What
And no one ever did anything
with is that no one ever looked
at it.
No one can.
Know what to think.
He was I.
We are joined.
What the work.
Thank you.
We.
The issue with the pediatric
nurse to work.
But are you looking for.
What do what do we say.

And I feel guilty.
Forced to do what what.

What part of.
Entering into.
If you'll.
Thank you for that you don't
like she died shortly
thereafter.
Thank.
Kirsty.
See what holding before the
ticket for.
Dementia.
What.
We.
Put her over and she find not to
mention that.
We go to an attorney.
Because I didn't want other
families to have to go through
if.
And we ended up not doing you
told us it's it's hard to say if
he would have died or not with
just part there's no way to
prove it.
But I will tell you that I deal
with every day.
I didn't.
Come on Rowley in the hospital
suicide by programs like.
Thank and I have talked with
other families who have been.
We are supposed to be getting
here for the the fund that we've
been talking about they no
longer even requested because it
has become so difficult it's
easier just to pay for things
themselves thank you jump
through all the phone.
And I I know that the small
production multi million dollar
billion dollar hospitals.
Are making big money just look
at the look at the there is
Valerie's of the your they don't
need our protection the people
who need our protection are the
doctors who are out on their own
or in small practices and the
family the family the people who
who are left to pick up the
pieces.
And and
thank Madam speaker implement
I'm gonna quit there so I can.
Both the hard for for my master
look but I am very passionate
about this it's not it's about
taking care of people this is
not about protecting.
The big guy thank god I have
what lawyers the big lots of
money but what I have I for one
and one that ends with I thank
you madam speaker gentle to.
There's further debate the
Representative the gentle lady
from Bernalillo county
Representative Barreras.
You madam speaker the gentleman
from Bernalillo and Sandoval
counties you.
Madam speaker I will yield to
gentle lady from will.
Thank you.
I wish I didn't have to go after
a Representative Thomson this is
really how the object is to
speak or.
I recently of.
Matt a young lady named in net.
And the she she shared with me
the story
About her mom.
And.
Her mom every single day not
just on Sundays not just on
holidays every single day and
that mom would cook a giant
metal and funeral family
everyday anybody could come
dozens of people would come for
health every single day.
One million and if mom wasn't
feeling very good.
And so should I not to come on
to the hospital and
you turned out she she had a
stroke.
And
You have a surgery.
On that Senator mom off into the
the the room for this emergency
surgery.
And.
The nurse came out and said the
surgery was successful.
Go ahead and handle on this
having just a couple of days
before a new year's and and you
can recall that our mom would be
home all right using with the
family.
And then I went home for the
night and the next morning.
She received the phone call from
my mom.
And her mom says she couldn't
feel her legs.
Her mom was completely
paralyzed.
During surgery a nurse has to
I don't know much about of
medical practice at all for.
A nurse had to quit his in her
back as a as I'm kind of like a
drainage you.
And she was not properly trained
to do that and if paralyzed if
paralyzed in the form.
You can have medical issues.
For months from the health of
Law.
Hello for for her life she had
before.
He had a multiple issues with
their internal organs and
eventually are you I.
Madam chair of the you madam
speaker and the gentleman.
My question is
If the hospital that and that
took her mom you.
We're not.
One of these twenty six
hospitals or was not part of
this
You for your good deal with a
half.
What what it would look like for
and that and her family what
kind of a compensation with the
media.
The.
Madam.
Madam speaker gentle lady that
would be really no different and
a lawsuit The New have for
injuries say against Walmart
you know if you would would be
unlimited in terms
and other recovery you could
receive for things like medical
bills lost earnings no
the ability to earn money in the
future the district given to
people have the help that they
needed home one household
services the things that they've
missed in life
all of those things with them we
ought to Richard would be up to
our community to decide what's
fair and so that's what we're
talking about as opposed to a
limitation from which the
hospitals new issue down because
they know they're not in greater
exposure cap and she yeah so I
hope that answers your question
Madam speaker gentle lady.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentleman.
I also met a woman named Trish
and the trash.
Share this story with me as well
a story about her husband.
Her husband who was a really
really tough guy.
The type of guided the ranchers.
Outside everyday third daughter
out of our future terrible or
you and for all round bales of
hay like like it was nothing
you very athletic and.
from the southern part of New
Mexico.
Investors of heart attack.
And so he was taken by ambulance
to the local hospital.
And this is the the fear.
Heart attack one that they call
a widow maker heart attack if
that puts things in perspective.
When they got to the hospital
there was
Only one of resident Harper
surgeon and he was on vacation
was not there.
There was nobody at the hospital
is affiliation is.
Then was airlifted to the
closest hospital which was and
I'll pass will.
You doctors the surgery that
that he needed but it was too
late he didn't survive.
but barely.
And
he has a pacemaker.
Installed now.
Really do anything you can the
you can walk without having to
sit down and rest because
absolutely anything happens to
part it will kill him.
So my question madam speaker and
gentlemen is.
Similar to the question that I
ask you.
If if he was taken to a hospital
that wasn't part of this bill or
if this bill was around.
What would what would
compensation look for for the
family.
Madam speaker gentle lady so
here you have someone who's the
breadwinner
the person is supporting a
family could be a man could be a
woman somebody that is
supporting a family
and we're seriously injured or
assisting the support for left.
And so Adrian and guests inside
no this is a community yes it is
I
what.
It is worth what.
Would be sufficient to
compensate that person.
The injuries that they suffered
including the support of the
fans.
On that is true right this cap
on hospitals without any
dialogue with patients or with
independent physicians are
getting the ability to get a
deal that you know these other
multi billion companies don't
get on Walmart for example I
keep going back to that but the
enlarge from General Motors
General Electric.
It is causing injuries our
system is is that going for a
jury and a jury decides in our
community what's fair what's
right what adequately compensate
that person.
The fact that we're putting an
arbitrary cap on people's
damages.
No reason for their ones for
independent physicians the fact
is is that Representative
Nighbor talked about well
hospitals were initially in the
acting.
Because they did it they had
independent insurance for the
doctors needed patience knowing
that that's why the deal was
worked out that's why
historically it's the doctors
that are taking advantage of
this because they have to they
don't have a choice hospitals
are doing this just because
you're getting a better deal.
And so don't take it away from a
statute an arbitrary cap given
to the community to decide
what's fair what's right for
families like the people you're
described thank you.
Thank you madam speaker thank
you gentlemen.
our our little town
Is about a couple named as and
sherry.
And the.
The story was very in touch me
was very personal for me because
there's all right was similar to
mine up until the very end.
And I'm sure you really wanted
to a family.
And they went through the same
process that my partner and I
went through which is not an
easy process of IVF.
To to get pregnant.
A pregnant with twins and.
Sherri was of location are
flawless.
And no problems at all.
They went to the hospital
with the guidance of their drive
to have a natural
From my story because we were
given a choice for for few
section.
During the this process during
the birth.
Their first baby girl was born
and two beautiful I'm a I got to
meet her she's great.
And they realize that the second
baby girl where was breach for
breach I'm not sure if which one
it is
When I'm coming out nationally
Now again I don't know of the
medical field at all guys but
excuse me
Madam speaker and gentleman my
understanding is that.
I'm an emergency like this
happens during childbirth it
would take about forty minutes
before a doctor would realize
that they thought of our
prepping for an emergency C.
section.
And have been for Sherri and
other.
And then what happened is the
doctor.
Hold and politics on this baby
for three hours.
And sherry told me that she
knew.
One wrong she knew the.
That they were going to lose the
baby.
Thanks for the C. section.
A doctor reassured her that.
He knew what he was doing.
And the if they needed to do an
emergency the fact that they
would do it.
Thank you baby girl was born.
And died
very shortly after she was born.
Madam speaker and gentleman.
If they haven't been at a
hospital.
With getting this super sweet
bill.
Forward compensation look like
for the family.
On madam speaker gentleman's.
You know I got time I have spent
a lot of time.
Orient as from.
I know this family pretty well
as results.
this interaction.
And
I have to tell you sure is going
to have.
And lifetime problems.
That if they were under the act
could never compensate what I
say compensated I think the
thing I need to make clear as.
The hospitals were in the act we
have insurance.
They can pay for this.
Program for the hospitals cost
of doing business unfortunately
these patients it's a lifeline
it's a lifetime.
The problems.
They're not otherwise going to
be compensated.
And for sharing the idea of
having to go through this.
Hours and hours of being in the
position to do a simple C.
section and witnessing literally
her infant baby being killed all
for hi this is just devastating
and there is no way.
Thank you very Hospital.
Is responsible for that.
That they wouldn't be able to
come and see who fully what's
happened just simply no reason
and that's really what we're
talking about if we're talking
about is there a reason.
Not to fully compensate these
people.
For independent physicians the
decision was made forty five
years ago yeah there was a
reason they couldn't get
insurance was a tough decision
for everybody but it was one
that was necessary that's not
true for us.
You sherry and as forgetting
judgment against the hospital
they can collect that judgment
through the private insurance
that all of these hospitals and
there is no crisis with respect.
I hope that answers your
question madam speaker gentle
lady.
Thank you madam speaker and
chairman.
It's my understanding that the.
Payout have for these twenty
six.
Hospitals is six hundred
thousand dollars is that correct
madam speaker and chairman.
madam speaker gentle lady the
they act provides for the six
hundred thousand dollar cap.
Yes this is what Representative
night referred to as medical
expenses in the future but is
several people of described it
becomes such a difficult process
that as you practical matter
their own that we can provide
for existing claims against the
fund they don't even have a
person of the patient's
compensation fund that is in
charge of looking to see what
bills need to be paid because
they just don't do it they buy a
new lease the lump sum amount so
it's it's the cap of six hundred
thousand and perhaps the new
with the cover future medical
expenses and it doesn't even do
that thank you madam speaker
generally.
Thank you madam speaker and
gentlemen.
What if the patient can no
longer work.
A with.
They would certainly get more
more money is that correct.
Madam speaker gentle lady if
there are the cap and they can
no longer work no we don't get
any compensation and that's
where the public ends up picking
up the tab and it's something
that gets lost in the discussion
is that no there's disability
rate or whatever it would be.
Public would have to pay for
what's really happening as the
taxpayer is now in the position
of subsidizing these multi
billion dollar companies for
their mistake for their
negligence so now there's a
captain not compensate.
Madam speaker and gentlemen I
just want to thank you for
clarifying this for me and I
have no more questions I yield
thank you.
The gentleman from Bernalillo
county representative my Estes.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman from but some of our
yield on madam speaker I will
yield to the gentleman from
Bernalillo.
Thank you madam speaker John
from president of all I just
have.
I just we just got all my
paperwork there's tons of
homework the past two days
For bringing for this bill and
thank you for for being aboard
the because it's an act that
it's highly specialized within
the legal profession
And so even folks who do
plaintiffs work of don't do
medical malpractice for because
it's just so.
Labor intensive it takes it's a
high high cost to the plan is to
get involved.
Because the the the harms so.
That and the and the the the
liability so high and so I just
want to talk a little about how
do we create that
How do we create that
equilibrium because our are the
folks who came before us were
smart enough to create this
fund.
And they were smart enough to
create this act the kind of
foot.
The kind of put a medical
malpractice claims in their own
special section of law you know
forty one dash five and so I
just want to.
My comments by saying that the
hospitals were not excluded from
the medical practice act
sisterly they were excluded from
participating in the fund is
that correct.
Madam speaker German no they
weren't excluded by statute they
could have done but they didn't
cause particularly as of
nineteen ninety two then there
was a tree claim limit put on
the fine the the hospitals can't
do that I mean they have tons of
questions so the idea was they
were gonna apply it wasn't until
the superintendent in two
thousand nine decided in spite
of the statute to not required
to not requirements reclaim
limit.
Thank one thing to be clear
about is we are back to nineteen
seventy six we're talking about
hospitals we're talking about
community based hospitals were
talking about the hospitals that
least I Adam owners that I have
when I was a kid.
Raul is a practical matter and
become more and more these multi
billion dollar appropriations
they're not the small community
based hospitals we're talking
about you're still outpatient
clinics by with our are covered
by the medical malpractice act
but as a practical matter now
the hospitals were excluded but
there was no reason for them to
get in until the superintendent
without statutory authority
decided let the man without an
adequate basis to run an actual
study and without limiting them
to three claims and that
continues to this day.
No thank you madam speaker Jim
from Santa Fe burly and I think
this first alright this act
since I left a.
Prevents work to going to
plaintiff's work and I just do.
School fashion car accidents and
things like that I don't believe
there's anyone in the
legislature does medical
malpractice it
and the reason I bring up the
economics of of plans work in
the medical malpractice field is
that.
There's there's a window of
folks who don't get justice they
don't get justice because the.
The cost of presenting the case.
would exceed any.
And the remedy that could be
have you know and so a great
great many folks who were
so for
Medical malpractice acts don't
recover they don't recover at
all and in fact if you could
explain briefly unlike any other
plaintiffs work under a unlike
any other toward recovery you
have to go to a get to organize
a panel and convince a panel
that thank you have a valid
claim come like a a grand jury
proscar going to a grand jury
could you explain just briefly
that provision law it before you
can sue somebody on a medical
malpractice up to.
You have to get a decision from
the commission.
That
Madam speaker gentleman.
Clear that I do not to medical
malpractice so is based on my
understanding from talking to
other lawyers that are in the
community but here's what's
happened is yes when the
hospitals were not in the act
Representative medical legal
panel and you go in front of
that panel and they make a non
binding decision so you're not
stuck with it one way the other
as to whether the position
screwed up and because the
pollution injury or damages and
if I remember right there's
three lawyers and three doctors
nurses specialists in there
somewhere and they're not in the
deciding tribunal they don't
make a binding decision but it's
really to try to encourage you
to the doctors and more you
really messed up or the patient
to say what the doctor did mess
up the problem is that with the
hospitals now in the medical
malpractice act that system
because it's all volunteers they
all are called by
on the medical board or whatever
it's called American Eagle panel
on those are all volunteers to
come in and they have been
overwhelmed
by the hospitals being in
because of all the claims so as
a practical matter that system
is become in effect.
Thank thank you for that
administrative gentleman from
Senate overflow and it's it's
forty one dash I dash fifteen.
No medical mac no malpractice
action may be filed in any court
against a qualifying health care
provider before application is
made to the medical review
commission and its decision is
rendered so might my point is
madam speaker German from
Minnesota but they are these are
not frivolous claims.
These are claims that were
vetted by medical professionals
that advise the the plaintiff
and the lawyer whether.
Whether they have a shot to move
forward.
You know on their defended
vehemently by you know the best
lawyers in the region I suppose
and many times and it's no one's
fault in the systems it's it's
the no Adam Smith warned us
about this the founder
capitalism and Adam Smith one is
about that would be referred to
as the joint stock company our
corporate laws are simply not
conducive to the modern world
they they are driven not
primarily but only only in the
profits of the quarterly report
and that's not a criticism of
anyone involved in the systems.
But that's that's that's our
economic world as we as we live
in it currently and so these
hospitals these
These insurance companies these
these adjusters these folks who
make these decisions it is in
their short term economic
interest to deny all these
claims it's a dysfunctional
system it's a it's an unjust
system and so we should be
grateful here in New Mexico have
some of the.
Some of the finest no lawyers in
in
In the region you know fighting
the good fight for these for
these claimants we thought of
when I first arrived here about
a speakers on from Santa related
to.
Like all dollar amounts in
statute they needed reviewed
every decade or so for inflation
if if it's not for anything else
and we adjusted the six hundred
thousand dollar cap we adjusted
it to to conform to then
inflation ten years ago I think
the agreement between the
medical.
Immunity in the The Little
Committee was a million dollars
the the that that we had a brand
new governor at the time who
wasn't involved in those
negotiations and couldn't really
see we clearly understand that
that was in a that was in
agreement and so that bill was
vetoed and here we are.
You know a ten years later with
the six hundred thousand dollar
cap with the hospitals now
finding themselves under that
cap as well and so I I I
disagree with the the gentleman
from Santa Barbara.
Madam speaker that the
superintendent had authority in
my opinion under forty one dash
five dash five B..
Of you know the section a one
excludes hospitals.
but section be allow you know
for hospitals or outpatient
health care facilities electing
to be covered under the medical
malpractice that come with the
superintendent shell determined
based on a risk assessment of
each hospital.
each hospitals.
Of basic coverage or deposit an
additional charges for this to
make for the patients
compensation fund so our our
predecessors and contemplated
the ships in in the health care
market anticipated hospitals may
be in the building in this fund
but the baby treated differently
within the fund my that they
should be treated differently
within the funds.
And there needs to be actuary's
done on these hospitals and so
you know everyone if the you
know in a perfect world
everybody's under the fund but
they're treated differently and
so if you look on forty one dash
I dash twenty five madam speaker
general from Santa
for Leo subsection B. you know
to create the patients
compensation on an annual
surcharge shall be levied
levied.
On all the providers the
surcharge shall be collected on
the same basis as premiums for
each insurer from the health
care provider of.
Using data obtained from New
Mexico experience so this data
that needs to be obtained has it
been obtained has to have that
as the study's been done of to
make this a.
This fund do it it's meant to do
with these huge hospitals of
all.
Madam speaker gentlemen the
short answer is no are one of
the things that idea to make
sure that the current
superintendent is saying that is
he testified in front of
judiciary and also in a meeting
at the church Commission and so
I had both of those transcribe
happy to share those with
members and the short answer is
no I don't have that information
even as of today.
Though the excellent point madam
speaker German excellent point
of acceptance is going bald what
you will that same section alone
down paragraph age.
The superintendent job contract
for an independent actuarial
study of the patient's
compensation fund to be
performed not less than every
two years will to do that study
any cooperation.
The cooperation with regards to.
You know what's coming in what's
coming out and and actuaries.
You know actuaries I think
there's some friends in Vegas
who prior better actuaries and
maybe we are but actuaries is is
essentially.
You know insurance carriers will
insure against anything you can
call up tomorrow morning and so
I want lightning insurance you
know for my dog house they they
know the actuaries they know the
percentages they know based on
statistical probabilities given
you know if all the information
in front of them what the
premium should be for that
particular insurance policy and
so if you don't have good
information and and folks are
cooperating there's no way you
can do that study there's no way
you can charge people
appropriately
so that everybody is
It is made whole and everything
is just and fair let's talk
about the fund real quick Madam
speaker John from Santa early
because here's here's what I'm
struggling with.
I'm looking at the the end of
the of the analysis from the
Representative insurance and for
the folks keeping score at home
we have an independent since
superintendent of insurance I
think over forty five states
have a statewide elected
official we're one of a handful
of states that does not.
And they were
they were part of the PRC and
they were.
selected by the PRC would say
change that now that three
percent of insurances is
independent and I believe is
chosen
By the end of a governor from
not mistaken and so the fund
balance in two thousand fifteen
December thirty first two
thousand fifteen the fund
balance was thirty three point
four million.
The fund deficit
you know the balance minus the
liabilities I guess on that day
was essentially forty million
thirty nine point nine million
so that was a.
Deficit the fund was in a
deficit forty million dollars of
in deficit but.
Every four last December thirty
first two thousand nineteen the
fund balance was one point nine
million.
And the deficit was sixty five
point two so that deficit
increased.
From forty million to sixty five
million eight increased twenty
five million dollars which is
problematic and needs to be
remedied but the balance
increased.
Times three so so here's my and
and I'll just read from if you
could address this because
that's what I'm struggling with.
administrative credentials but
instead of all and this is the.
The superintendent chances
analysis that the deficit as a
percentage of annual surcharges
is an important issue we
reduction of the deficit
requires assessment increases.
Calculated as percentage
increases of the current patient
you have a PCF.
If the hospitals are removed
from the PC F. comma the fund
will lose about half of its
total surcharge revenue.
This will cause the deficit as a
percentage of annual surcharge
revenue to again surge above
three are present the burden of
continuing efforts to reduce the
fund of that will also only on
physicians who remain in the
fund and so that's the that's
the anxiety that's the stress
this is not lawyers versus
doctors this is not you know us
verses them this is how do we
create
A fund for the health care
industry so that the health care
industry grows that expands in
the rural communities but that
under the law folks are held
accountable and are held liable
for.
Or misconduct so I realize the.
You know these large large
corporations jumped into the
fund but they're also paying
into the fund.
And so anyway if if if we can
come out of the fund
What is that one of the
unintended consequences one of
the potentially negative
consequences and.
And we.
Should we how concerned should
we be with that with that
analysis because I know there's
there's different opinions on.
So madam speaker
and Representative only have
are superintendent R. Russell
told answers that question
reading from his testimony
before the insurance commission
we will be collecting any
additional work but will also be
reducing the PCS that's the
patients compensation fund
exposure of course because those
hospitals will no longer be
covered by the patient's
compensation.
Point is yes we know there's
going to be exposure we don't
know how much we also know which
only gonna get bigger and just
to be clear in the Judiciary
Committee here is what
superintendent holes that.
He said I completely agree with
all the comments that have been
made that the manner in which
the hospitals were needed in the
patient's compensation fund was
inappropriate and they were not
asked to the level of data and
information we needed and that
has presented on going
challenges and we had J. angle
off look at the actuarial report
that's current to see if they
can give us any information as
to what's going to be happening
in the future and his conclusion
was the only would probably say
is it just going to get a lot
worse but we don't know really
because the hospitals have never
provided the claims information
is required by an actual study
the number of claims and could
make the reserves that are out
there for those claims the
amount of money that has been
paid on those plans the
litigation costs connected with
those the claims of being closed
and the claims that remain open
the actual rules do not have
that so is it true that the fund
is exposed yes.
Is it also true that that
exposure is going to get to
continue and get larger and
larger over time of course and I
keep hearing about how the
hospitals are contributing more
money well of course they are
because they have more claims
you're not limited by the three
claims year so the bottom line
is is yes Sir going to
contribute more here's a
critical point if it any point
these hospitals that charge and
we all of them.
To really pay for what's
happening to this fund.
They can.
So things because all costs they
can we we don't really care we
know from the lawyers and
litigating cases against
hospitals all of these hospitals
have private insurance they all
do they're never gonna have a
problem with the doctors the
same doctors are out the
independent doctors barber
mechanisms to people that are
not hospital employees finally
most independent musicians are
now and therefore not impacted
by the hospitals pay for the
fact is is that the independent
positions that need this
insurance are more and more
exposed as time goes by we've
got to stop that's what we're
trying to do every year we wait
is another year we put
independent doctors and patients
at further risk.
No thank you madam speaker Jim
from Santa Barbara I know
there's folks so wait a to
address this this bill so hello
Representative Representative it
appeared a minute but I want to
make a couple points the.
You know we're reading FIR is
that say
You know it's it's factual
claims involving hospitals
exceeds the amount of the
surcharges collected from those
hospitals though shortfall will
be borne by the remaining
participants.
On in we're also reading things
like the increase in surcharges
of hospital removed from
participation in the patient
compensation fund may result in
rates that are unaffordable.
For many of the remaining
participants so I mean this is
what we're reading I just want
to make the point that we are
friends in the health care
community right or wrong in
different correct or incorrect
there there's heavy anxiety
heavy anxiety of Justin because
we're in the midst of the great
pandemic the worst economic
crisis of our lifetime and the
poorest state in the union the
most rural state and you and so
we have to respect that anxiety
doing a bill that will here
hopefully in about a week where
there's tremendous anxiety and
I'm gonna try to convince you
all that that anxiety is is
misplaced but I but you have to
respect that we have to listen
to our doctors and nurses and
health care providers that are
That are you know.
They're freaking out a little
bit
so I just wanted to make that
point
I I stand in support I I wish I
knew more about these actually
that we should know more about
this system I wish I knew more
about the economics and and and
inner workings of the health
care system is highly
complicated markets don't
Some is market driven some is
not we have the capacity on
because of our smart policy
making and including more people
in a.
In in federal federal subsidies
to have a first class world
class healthcare systems in New
Mexico I think that doctors from
all over the country starting
would love to come to our rural
areas because that's what
they're they're overseas that's
what they're calling is
to beat is to offset huge
disparities in health outcomes
huge disparities
in
You know that generations of
poverty brings so we just have
to we have to tread lightly with
regards to perception and.
And always remain inviting to
this to this industry towards is
the interesting concept.
toward a madam speaker gentle
from really was is that is a
funny word.
It's a word that derive
centuries ago on an island on
the other side of the earth
that if you wrong someone you
Committee tortuous act you you
committee toward against that
person.
And the law of the under the the
the the kings England said if
you commit a tort against
somebody if you wrong somebody
then the you have to make it
right.
You have to make it right and
what are not novel novel a novel
concept to live one's life but.
In in in the and a and an a in a
proposal injury claim in a
medical malpractice claim.
You're not gonna make it right.
Never going to be right.
Never ever ever and so what what
what we've created is that they
write a check they write a check
to compensate.
Family members or loved ones or
the person themselves from
horrible pain and suffering that
you cannot put a dollar amount
on.
And so I want to this can't be
the end all be all to this
section of law we need we need
to revisit it we need to figure
out you made a comment madam
speaker gentle lady telephone
but outside of all that if
hospitals one out of the Act is.
Just bring another bill what
will they should bring another
bill one of the very words of a
week you know we are very should
bring another bill we need to
figure out and you know just
like minimum wage you know keep
the.
Of these to be raised as the
inflation and the economy
modernizes we need to just
figure out those premiums and
those payouts six hundred
thousand dollars is a disgrace
that needs to be raised.
we need to create a system where
these these claims are processed
sooner and quicker and without
the huge contention if in fact
the
You know because the liability
is not at issue with the damages
right the damages their issue
not the liability.
But I just want to add madam
speaker German from some of a
brilliant thank you for
educating this this position.
you know that the true believer
says that the the law must make
that percent hole that.
But there's economic realities
that we need to consider as well
when I come up to Santa Fe I try
to bring on my under my new
responsibility as commerce
chairman economic hat.
And there's my econ professor
would tease and say that you
could you could correlate
economic growth by by the ratio
of lawyers to engineers you
know.
So
you know we need to find that
equilibrium between lawyers and
doctors and medical providers.
so that we get the best possible
medical care for people
In that and the law does not
restrict of is not restrict a
famous ability to hold folks
accountable and seek justice
through the courts so anyway I
up be sure you representative
from Senate overly and I
appreciate the debate but we
need to revisit this issue in
the coming months and years.
We need to teach our colleagues
myself included the economics of
of the medical
in health care community and and
we need to.
Have a national single payer
plan and join the rest of the
civilized world at some point
thank you madam speaker.
Gentlelady from Katrin Sapporo
in Valencia counties
representative Armstrong.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman from early on Santa Fe
yield.
Madam speaker we don't
generally.
Thank you gentlemen and thank
you madam speaker of this is a
really trying to bait a motion
over bait
stories of.
your and for that I sympathize
with.
Once again I'll say I'm from
rural and frontier New Mexico
where we have.
Hospital in Sapporo.
In a hospital in Arizona.
Those are the two closest
hospitals.
madam speaker and and gentleman.
We have a hospital fund and
Balenciaga County.
That we've been putting out to
bid to build a hospital in Boise
county that we can't get anyone
to bet on.
Thanks rural New Mexico.
Of Madam speaker and gentleman
of the hospitals follow the
rules at the time to be done
qualified participate.
In the funds.
They were charge there's
surcharges to get into the
phone.
They secured underlying
underlying risk insurance
policies.
Madam speaker and gentleman we
can argue that all night long
whether they should have been
allowed to be to be and are not
doesn't matter they were allowed
to come in they were in the
fund.
Taking them out of the fund now.
would just be giving up get out
of jail free card that's.
I've I've been hearing madam
speaker and gentleman from
positions in my district from
the hospital in my district.
That.
This would be devastating to
them.
Of understanding all the all the
stories that were told.
Whining Mr speaker gentleman
what we not.
Hold people accountable right
now for what the the law states
and what the previous
representative.
Quoted.
And why Mr a gentleman and madam
speaker would we not allow the
superintendent of insurance to
help us provide answers and to
help us.
firm up the funds instead of
just picking the hospitals out.
Madam speaker generally think
question so couple of things one
There is no polite way to say.
Hospitals I the killer deal
getting into this fund a
violated the statute on the
three claims they have not
provided the claims information
having said that the
superintendent not our current
superintendent but the
superintendent allow them to do
that the state bears some
responsibility for what's
happened.
But the answer is not to reward
the hospitals for getting this
deal is to get him out now there
is a lawsuit pending but I
haven't talked about.
Casual real more it is to go to
the superintendent and say you
know what these hospitals were
in one point.
And pass the three claims
without adequate insurance and
the taxpayers and
independent doctors and patients
should not be on the that and
that money that has been paid
out by the fund should be clawed
back I can make a prediction
about the lawsuit I gotta tell
you I'm looking statutes in this
that seems like a pretty decent
lawsuit committee.
As far as the positions are
concerned or talking to you
sounds to me like they're
Hospital Zetian's reprimands are
going up.
You're paying for that.
The fact that you are having
problems getting a hospital
building your community has
nothing to do with this because
they're protected already by
this insurance scheme none of
that's going to change they go
out the important charge that's
a bottom line issue they just
pay more premium they passed a
law after the shooting what
we're talking about this is
really truly risking the now
minority of doctors were
independent doctors and who are
not
a hospital employees and
patients were subsidizing these
multi billion dollar companies
because they're limiting their
recovery in a way that no other
multi billion dollar company
gets to do what for no reason
other than these companies want
to make a greater profit.
So my attitude about this is and
it is exactly right use these
hospitals you can go out and
purchase insurance should not be
in this act they never should
have been leading in they knew
they got a deal they got lawyers
done take longer read the
statute you religious statues
got a three claim limit period
superintendent decided not to
enforce this current
superintendent has invented
that's what's happened.
The fact is the hospitals have
never provided information even
though the required to do one of
the statute nothing's ever
happened we still don't have
that information.
So rather than reward that kind
of behavior and continue to
violate the law.
Get them out of this act.
Stop having New Mexico citizens.
stories you've heard tonight.
Continue to subsidize these
multi billion dollar companies
when they don't need the subsidy
they really don't I can't
emphasize that enough and if you
say well we'll just charge you
more I'm telling you hospitals
will be.
And when they do that that bank
of garbage that deficit is
growing every day is going to be
huge an independent doctors and
maybe the taxpayers of New
Mexico are gonna end up having
to pick up that tab and there is
absolutely no reason why we
can't stop it today.
I am never for and I'm not
hearing.
That hospitals there's a
professionals and hospitals are
in the state that has never been
the case in New Mexico the
reason that you're hearing from
doctors is because their
employers are telling them to
contact you and don't forget
we're talking about hospitals
that are worth billions of
dollars and they have the
resources and the ability a lot
of the all of us in a way that
makes it sound like there's a
crisis when there's not this is
a crisis of anything out to we
don't have to want to pay a
little more money in premiums we
want a great deal we've got on
the back of independent doctors
and New Mexico's citizens who
are the most disadvantage of any
citizen we have because of the
victims of medical negligence to
any significant degree because
that's what we're talking we're
talking about people who have
been catastrophic we injure or
kill as a result of medical
negligence that's the subset of
people that are really
subsidizing these hospitals and
from my point of view that's
just outrageous and that just
has to stop thank you madam
speaker gentle.
Thank you madam speaker and and
gentleman for your comments I
don't think it's fair to assume
that those are the doctors that
I'm hearing from I also don't
think that it's fair to assume
madam speaker gentleman that
that it's it's the billion.
Billionaire hospitals that are
asking their employees to call
because they have the resources
just like in other cases we hear
from the.
Trial lawyers and the unions you
have billions of dollars
miss madam speaker gentleman's
that but do the same thing.
They do the same thing so I
don't think that that's a fair
assumption and madam speaker and
kind gentleman I am going to
oppose this legislation because
I believe there's a better way
to fix it I believe there's a
better way to go about
In about it instead of just
yanking the rug out from
underneath the hospitals the
work that paid their dues that
were allowed to come in and I'm
not asking a question I'm just
making a statement that that I
think that there are better ways
to fix this and that we need to
hold people accountable whether
it's doctors nurses hospitals
attorney's contract contractors
whatever it is but this is not
the way to just yank the rug out
and I I will be in opposition of
this bill thank you miss madam
speaker and.
Kind gentleman.
There is further debate the
gentleman from Bernalillo county
Representative Martinez.
Thank you madam speaker will the
gentleman for early on Santa
please yield.
On Madam speaker I will gladly
the yield to the gentleman from
all.
Thank you madam speaker and
thank you gentlemen you know
this has been a very
enlightening debate.
This is one of those bills that
I think is
difficult that the testimony
from many of our colleagues has
been very touching very personal
you know I've I've poured
through the statutes that have
been cited in and reading to my
notes you know it's it's not a.
That is the thing to do and and
I commend you may madam speaker
development for for taking is on
you know yet again here we are.
Trying to fix.
A problem a massive problem that
was created.
By people in positions of trust
in people in positions of power
and that we now have to clean up
after.
And it is unfortunate madam
speaker and gentleman because at
the end of the day it is the
taxpayers it is the people of
this great state that have put
the bill.
Madam speaker and and gentleman
I spoke to you about this bill
not too long ago and and and you
you described you choose
metaphor to describe what's
going on and and I'm I'm hoping
that you can repeat that for.
You talked about a sinking boat
when you talk about an elephant
on that book can you can you
walk us through that then forget
then speaker and.
Speaker gentleman I didn't think
you like that for so I was use
repeated I will I mean I think
of the I was trying to visualize
it for myself.
I think of the patient's
compensation fund as the
Legislature got together in the
seventies and they built a boat.
And they built a vote for
independence physicians in
plaintiffs because it was the
only vote that was available to
them the independent physicians
didn't have another approach and
the patients were there because
they had to have insurance from
the independent positions to be
able to have some recovery.
And that boat was particularly
pretty but it was sturdy at work
to do next week's.
And then the superintendent of
insurance decides you know that
both working pretty well after
thirty some years so
Let's let's put an elephant on
it see what happens.
And
they put the first element on
the boat even though the
elephant.
Some boat it was just thirty
both the elephant your vote and
vote and they put the vote on
the boat started to sink and the
superintendent said you know
what.
That is a pretty good thing they
don't see the ball sinking let's
put some points on it let's put
twenty five or twenty six
elephants on the boat and now
really starts to sink and it
develops a whole that's the
difference.
And so people say well you know
we gotta we gotta fix that hole.
we we we got to get that whole
fix no first thing you do is get
the elephants off a boat then
fix all because you don't have
the often talk about what's
going to go down in the water
hole gets bigger the boat starts
to change and eventually goes
down the only problem with that
metaphor is whatever is analogy
always get that confused as
words formality the only
difference with that is is that
there's always a ramp for the
elephants to get off that
But everybody else on New Mexico
the stock on that.
That's the difference and so
that's the analogy Madam speaker
and Representative.
Thank you madam speaker and
enjoyment that thanks for for
For repeating that now yet I
think it's it's it's helpful to
visualize in two thousand nine
with that first element was
allowed on this boat by the then
superintendent of insurance.
what was the and maybe perhaps
you don't know this I don't know
if this is explained anywhere
but what was the reasoning
behind allowing that very first.
Multi billion dollar elephant.
No Madam speaker and
Representative I just wanted to
check in this regard is my
understandings is saying we
don't we we know we what we do
know is is that the three
limited claims for weight and
that sentences basically said
here's our information that we
will give you and you can set
our surcharge according and
that's what happened it's set
the precedent and then you know
said the six seven years later
that's when the other hospital
started to come.
And madam speaker gentlemen home
anymore hospitals came into the
system into the funding should
say.
It's a total of twenty six
twenty four are these multi
billion dollar companies it is
why physicians are mapping drive
American in the former president
of the American medical
association is just screaming
out because what she sees is is
that independent physicians and
premiums go up and up and up are
going to be to be driven out of
the state or into the arms of
hospitals and health all become
hospital employees so madam
madam speaker Joe that's an
interesting point right because
we hear a lot about this is
going to drive hospitals out of
state
but there's a different
potential reality at stake here
and that is that.
Independent practitioners like
Dr mac in any may be driven out
of the state if this is not
resolved is that not the case.
Madam speaker and gentleman yeah
although in Dr Macanese K.
because they run such a large
operation in an operation of the
Mexico cancers hi I'm fifty
seven I should know that because
my wife was treated there I
think it's Mexico cancer center
Dr McEntee will correct me I'm
sure Representative on the they
will just be driven into the
arms the hospitals and then
what's going to happen is
patients will be charged that is
what's gonna premiums will go up
Medicaid will be charge more
chair will be charged for
Medicaid of course the state
will be on our work no one will
remember these mom and pops and
I really do for these doctors
this way these independent
doctors are really the local
people in our community they're
not the multi billion dollar
companies that send their
profits out of state the
employee New Mexicans they spend
New Mexico the New Mexico
they're invested one hundred
percent in New Mexico that's why
they're so important to protect
not just patients are also
independent.
I agree with that Madam speaker
Angela men and and you know I I
think.
Operations like Dr mechanism and
I by I have no respect about
making it her practice they do
incredible work
in terms of cancer treatment
they do a lot of charitable work
they do a lot of work in places
like Gallup and and McKinley
County they do a lot of work
here in Albuquerque in south
valley in in other areas
and it is a shame to think that.
In an organization like hers you
know.
That we should all be very proud
of and grateful to
is essentially.
Bearing the brunt of this of
this very broken system.
I want to go back to two
thousand nine when the first.
Our hospital is allowed into the
patient compensation fund.
and what I heard you say your
your Madam speaker delivers that
we don't really know what the
basis was for that Cision
I I do remember
I I think it's it's fair to say
that the office of the
superintendent of insurance has
had its share of issues in the
past
in that our new superintendent I
think really is is is beginning
to clean up a lot of things and
and you know I'm I'm familiar
with with the a couple of people
that work there that that are
incredible leaders one of them I
I went to law school had food
you know that they're really
doing their best to clean up an
act that have been not very.
That that that had had some
issues madam speaker and
chairman and not knowing the
reasoning behind and that's why
this is so confusing to me like
not knowing the reasoning behind
allowing one big hospital and
then eventually allowing twenty.
Four plus others.
In two was into what was never
meant for hospitals it is really
just mind boggling.
And it's a real shame because
again here we are you know with
this past seven o'clock you know
a couple hours into this debate
and we're cleaning up after a
government agent.
That
in fact you know just didn't act
probably the the the way they
should have
up mathematics we can have an
all of close with this you know
we have monetize healthcare we
live in a capitalist country
I agree with the previous
speaker we need to figure out a
way out of that for profit
system because it really is
problematic and I think that is
we
as we debate this bill further
and as we work through the rest
of this legislative session you
know there's a lot of things in
the health care system that are
very problematic and this is one
of them and if we can begin to
fix that system in this bill is
part of fixing that system I'm
all for thank you madam speaker
thank you gentlemen.
This for the general
Representative Chasey.
Thank you very much Mister
speaker well the gentleman from
Bernalillo Sandoval yield
speaker I will yield to the
gentle lady formerly.
Thank you so much
I'll tell you what I think I
have heard and see if I got it
right.
Right now it seems to me that.
The fund was created because.
Independent physicians had no
access to a pool no access to
insurance so we created this
pool right.
So we were covering in a way
their wrists.
Mr speaker of Madam chair
representative yes that's
correct.
So.
It's because they could not get
insurance that we did this and
yet well hospitals were.
Eligible to come in.
They did until it was two
thousand nine when a whole bunch
of them came in and what was
their wrist prior to their
ensuring the fund.
Madam chair representative I'm
sorry Mr speaker I can say hours
late Mr speaker our
Representative
and I'm so not used to calling
you representative
Representative
the rest of the hospitals
premium was
we getting a better deal or
could they get a better deal and
so they went to the funds just
to get a better deal but they
had was no crisis of insurance
letter was productor is there
was no reason that they had to
go over the funding just saw an
opportunity to get better.
So right now all really the ones
who are still bearing the rest.
Are the independent knitted
doctors.
But it's the patients.
Who really are at risk.
And there are some magnificent
health care professionals and I
have done many of my family and
Although they're not here in New
Mexico.
And I'm so grateful to them for
all of their work but.
It's it's the patients who
aren't who are the victims of
medical negligence who read it
of the this really hits them
hard.
Because there's no way to make
it right the the the German for
Burghley house that you know you
thanks you're wrong there's no
fixing the wrong when the
compensation fund.
Madam chair representative
that's correct.
Okay and.
It sounds like.
I believe because of the
superintendents report that he
has the authority to fix it.
And make it right.
I thought I heard him say in
House Judiciary.
The legislature needs to solve
this problem.
They have shortened that a bit
so madam chair I'm reading from
I'm sorry Mr speaker.
Representative right a
different.
Santa please refer to the
gentlelady from Bernalillo as
the gentle lady from Bernalillo
thank you thank you Mr school.
And so the freshmen out there is
the rules sure parliamentarian I
appreciate the correction that
was near us
Mr speaker.
Very soon as we have it on video
for all.
Mr speaker gentlelady yes in
fact I I have on the as I
understand the transcript he and
and this is for all of his
superintendent poll testimony
introduce your and he says I do
want to say I'm reading right
from the transfer the issue of
whether the hospitals should be
in or not we clearly Senator
report that this from our
perspective it is a matter of
legislative policy making and he
said that over and over again in
the transcript this is up to us
not at the.
Thank you Mr speaker generally.
And one last point I what I'm
gathering here is that hospitals
have never actually covered what
they are causing.
In terms of the creation and
that we don't have their
actuarial right.
Mr speaker gentle lady it is
correct the hospitals and never
provided the information upon
which is decent actuarial report
could be produced and they have
never paid their workers.
More and Mr speaker and
gentleman from early onset of
all this superintendent
insurance apparently lacks the
authority to make them do that.
Mr speaker gentle lady it
appears so.
Is that correct.
Okay.
Are ready so I guess what.
I think I understood.
I understand correctly.
And Mr speaker and gentleman.
I don't think.
It's really right for us at this
time to say.
Let the superintendent of
insurance X..
We need to do our job.
As offices this is and I will
support your bill and I urge the
other members to do the same we
absolutely it to our patients in
New Mexico an independent
doctors thank you.
The gentleman from signpost room
or in the Santa Fe and Santa Fe
Representative Chandler.
Thank you very much Mister
speaker will the gentleman from
Santa yield.
Mister speaker I yield to the
gentle lady.
Thank you very much Mister
speaker and gentleman I just
wanted to make a few points as I
was listening to the debate Mr
speaker and that is this.
This drop chair was created in
nineteen seventy six or
thereabouts.
And it was at a time when the
world was very different in
terms of how we receive medical
care.
What our relationship with our
physicians were.
What our relationships with
hospitals were
I remember our can we had a
community hospital where I grew
up Mr speaker and it was a very
personal relationship with the
hospital and the hospital had a
personal relationship with the
community.
And hospital in the positions
most of whom at that time Mr
speaker were independent
physicians not positions
directly affiliated with the
hospital all had a had a
connection to the people with
whom who they were treating and
with the community in which they
serve.
As we have society has grown Mr
speaker that model has changed
significantly just yeah we have
gigantic hospitals
even our local New Mexico
hospitals Mr speaker some of
them are very large and extend
across regions.
In many and most it appears
doctors now are employed by the
hospitals and we have fewer and
fewer independent practitioners
Mr speaker in those fewer and
fewer physicians do not have a
cover that the larger hospitals
now provide to them and.
I thank Mr speaker we
the community the state in
hospitals and physicians
our responsibility to change the
model to meet what the New World
is all about and we have not
done that Mr speaker we have
failed miserably and we're not
alone in that failure I think.
The superintendents of insurance
have failed us I think the
medical community Mr speaker has
failed us because they have
resisted
any opportunities presented to
them to change when I was first
elected Mr speaker on the I was
taken out to lunch by the
medical society in the hospitals
and thank they were telling me
that
the fund is this in the funds
that we shouldn't touch funds
good we should not change the
model that's what that's there
was no interest in addressing
the problem of the under funding
of the problem of the of the
funds why because Mister speaker
it was a really good deal for
the hospitals so I support this
bill because one it will make
these large corporations and by
the way I live in a community
where we have a for profit out
of state hospital who is
receiving the benefit of what
the state has provided them
profits are going out of state
there's very little connection
to the committee I just had to
get that in but we need to
change the model Mr speaker get
the hospitals out.
Begin to recognize again Mr
speaker our responsibility to
the independent physicians and
if we need to come back and then
adjust.
Let's do that I do think we the
independent doctors of the
smaller community hospitals
perhaps some assistance but
we're not there yet the first
thing to do to do Mister speaker
is to get the elephant off the
boat and then to move forward
thank you very much Mister
speaker and thank you kind
gentleman from Santa for
bringing the bill.
