Representative Chasey.
Representative Ely here.
Representative okay.
Representative Nibert.
Representative Ortez.
President.
You.
Representative Rehm.
Representative Zamora here's
your whatever.
Representative Gallegos.
I don't see it on.
Representative guidance here.
Chasey.
Vice chair.
President.
Madam chair okay.
Madam chair if each different
thank thank you.
Good morning everyone
What this was all.
Do you really want her to
introduce herself.
Thank you.
let's go ahead and get the
business okay yeah
Representative Johnson thank you
madam chair thank you colleagues
and thank you to my expert
witnesses and thank you
audience.
Today before you we have house
bill's.
Six seven and nine and pertain
to the twenty twenty one
educational redistricting act.
And these are redistricting maps
that pertain to the Public
Education Committee
establishing Public Education
Commission districts providing
for staggered terms and the
filing of a concedes seven
precincts setting residency
requirements and repealing and
acting sections of and I'm just
a nineteen seventy eight.
With me today I have the.
My expert witnesses and I will
give them the opportunity to
introduce themselves and we
would like to briefly talk about
house bill six and house bill
seven however we'd like to focus
on house bill nine thank you
madam chair.
Thank you Representative my name
is Brian center off and Steve
probably just also from a
certain point and so we're here
today to review the PVC plans so
first a little background
as you know within the CRC
process the C. R. C. reviewed
various concepts for the PVC.
Yes they did for Congress and
the house and the Senate.
And then there were two phases
of public hearings around the
state.
I had an opportunity to speak
about the different concepts for
all of the
different jurisdictions quite
frankly.
There was a lot more interest
will reach out of the state when
it came to congressman state
legislature and state Senate
then there was on the PC but
some people did speak on the PC
and members of the public in the
gallery also submitted some PVC
plans for the CRC's
consideration.
The three bills that are here
today.
Are all bills that were adopted
by the C. R. C. to move forward
for more consideration so as you
know as we go through the
legislative process we're seeing
a lot of bills but we weren't or
not C. or C. bills these all
three were bills that were
recommended to you for your
consideration.
The state of New Mexico S. co
has two point one million people
about.
And there are ten he sent
districts.
So that basically what that
means is H. P. S. C. district
has about two hundred and eleven
thousand people these are
massive districts.
And they.
However many counties as they go
and when we look at all three of
these plans there are a lot of
similarities and.
and then there's some defining
features that that distinguish
them from the others.
So what I'd like to do with the
tears permission is on on one
particular aspect go back and
forth between the couple plans
just to show and and differences
I think that would speed things
up as well if if that's
appropriate to talk about the
plans together so to speak.
Okay.
So let's look at concept Hey.
Concept to me this is the plan
ten years ago.
The legislature as you know the
courts ended up getting involved
for Congress and the legislature
the legislature did pass one
play in the last ten years ago
and that one of
You see play in this is what we
call the status quo plan you can
see it in various the their
packaging to be given that you
can see it online you can see on
the screen behind you
but basically the the the
legislature did pass a PC player
this is we call C. eight change
in the sense that the only
adjustments that were made were
to accommodate for population
shifts.
So under this plan district
nine.
District nine it's a very but
district that covers the entire
east side from top to bottom.
The district is also very but in
its configuration and it goes
from one to to to County.
So this concept Hey which is
house bill six temperatures from
the other two and we wanted to
point it out this very but
nature of districts eight nine.
Look at
concept see kind of subsea.
About to say about concepts
State holds true for also has
been in the in
notice that instead of the
vertical configuration of that
district number.
Nine nine that we have Lee and a
and telco
there are districts of southeast
New Mexico gets a pain in Senate
district and rather than the two
but configurations it is more
compact you'll see this in both
concepts house bill seven and
house bill nine let's look at
house bill nine of this.
House bill nine again rather
than having a district that goes
from top to bottom from county
to Lee County
The total
to Thomas are in one district
all of these districts stay with
the again the ideal population
two hundred eleven thousand plus
or minus five percent none of
the deviations to my
recollection would be on that
now there is a distinguishing
feature on house bill nine that
would like to talk about that
does differ from the other two
plants.
Under house bill nine notice
that in district five of San
Juan McKinley Cibola.
The other two plans and pretty
much stuck to send well and and
the Kinsley.
Just received a native American
voting age population of about
fifty two percent.
This plan house bill million
dollars in attempts to increase
the native American percent of
the population it simply went
from renting from fifty two
percent to fifty five percent
and so spreading County.
The staff to go into a different
district to district and.
For additional population into
the San Juan McKinley district
to include
right.
Aqaba and to our early and as
well and so and counselor
and Tory
So this strategy in house bill
nine and again all of these
plans have similarities but the
percent native American goes
from about fifty two to about
fifty five the other plans let
let's look at them again I think
we really speed things up I just
comparing things
a or C. would be the same of
this just find or see either
way.
So this.
The.
It's.
Compact in the and and and we
stick to the county lines in San
Juan McKinley but that's because
it's not going into labor and
Cibola County it's not going
into the Clinton Acura it's not
going to Alamo and to
internationally so it's a matter
of although a counselor and Tory
owner in it.
So as you're thinking about your
preferences what one of the
things you should be considering
is district five into the plans
it's six more to San Juan
McKinley and from Santa native
American areas and hit Correa.
Karia is an agency budget Correa
is not in house bill nine
and so it's just a matter of
preference when it comes to that
so but house bill nine includes
more native American lands in
the house in district five.
so we talked about the
distinguishing features of
eastern New Mexico we talked
about the distinguishing
features in northwest New Mexico
let's go back to let's talk
about Albuquerque since that's
important let's start with a.
The.
And this plan the
concept at a house six.
We see that in Albuquerque
basically districts one two and
three.
And in this one choose the
Ventana ranch area going down
the west side including Taylor
rants including the dera and
including the entire south
valley so in this plan is a west
side district that excludes
paradise hills paradises goes in
district three so the question
here is do you want the entire
south valley unified with the
the west side money is paradise
hills the advantages that
unifies the south valley the
disadvantages it it packs that
district up to sixty six percent
Hispanic.
Okay the next plan and again I'm
showing all of them and and and
the differences.
In.
Concept see.
Notice here that there's a west
side district paradise hills
Taylor ranch let their and it
goes into the west gate area
near the south valley but what
what it does is the all part of
the south valley let's say east
of corners goes with the north
valley and the university area
and the international district
so should the south valley east
of course the with the
international district to the
north valley we're in the prior
plan should the south valley be
unified with Westgate
and this plan to get an extra
Hispanic district a district
three okay on house bill nine.
The notice have a dish are one
two and three in Albuquerque
there's there are several.
What I'm trying to do is point
out the differences that will
take house bill nine take a ride
around the state.
So here's Albuquerque again
districts one two and three.
Here the paradises areas split
with this is fine but
is between one and three here we
see a west side district the
south valley in this plan
south valley does go with the
west side district but it is
split the split in the north
south fashion so the area I
don't know some point north of
south of lake somewhere.
Yeah so the south valley south
of.
Garden club actually the the in
the of poverty to mesa and the.
Mesa del sol area that area goes
actually in district six south
in south.
Western New Mexico so.
Those are pretty much the major
differences let's now go back to
house bill nine.
Yes.
I'm sorry that's right we have
to say now let's let's go back
to statewide through.
We talked about district eight
million and how rather than the
vertical configuration that you
saw the other two plans the
southeast gets its own district
the district line is a little
more compact we talked about
that north west of New Mexico so
let's look at the north central
district ten.
District ten is Rio Arriba
County.
Artist tells County it includes
all the set of all pueblos Los
Alamos County the Santa Fe.
Most of the central for
twiddling our so I'm color blind
and I'm having issues the
committee yeah.
Once their certain colors that
when they match up
Not good morning.
There is.
That.
Better.
Okay okay so we see an district
tended to north central district
that includes Rio Arriba and
toss
and and and students Santa Fe.
Districts for is a Rio Rancho
include set most of Santa Fe
County and and the pueblos of
Santa Fe County Los Alamos it's
red and Cuba.
This was the district that had
to shrink the most because of
the excess population in Rio
Rancho so again it's it's
primarily Santa except for some
of the native American lands
that went into district I.
And so Santa Fe Los Alamos
southern Santa Fe county in this
district as well.
And the yes these mountains of
Albuquerque as well this
district.
Okay.
District six.
District six is basically
southwestern New Mexico district
and includes Torrance County
and it does not include Los
crucis but it does include parts
of Dona Ana County like the had
school district is separate from
the Los crucis school district
or gaps in schools and and so
hatch would be within this
district six.
District seven that's.
Ten yeah district seven is
primarily.
Okay Las Cruces district.
And so notice that in this this
is a seven Dona ana county Las
Cruces district so someone
parked Senator rates Anthony are
all in this as well as the city
of Los crucis notice that shop
around shop around to split
between a total into any of the
county but in this plan on the
chaparral is unified and it goes
into district seven rather than
district eight and that's
because the people in Sapporo
actually go to a and against and
school district and so we kept
shopper out in there with
districts
So if we go back to the
statewide view.
We see the ten districts.
we've seen the three districts
in Albuquerque and how they play
out slightly differently in the
south valley we soon eight nine
and the different ways that
could be approached whether it's
more of a horizontal or vertical
configuration both house bill
nine and seven took this long.
And we saw the the
distinguishing feature in house
bill nine being an attempt to
increase the native American
percentage from fifty two to
fifty five by going into
district I by going into a
Cibola County and Sikora county
and picking up other tribal
lands but again the there are
more similarities than
differences between these plans
and so that would be an over of
a few of the three bills.
Thank you madam chair and
colleagues we now stand for
questions.
Thank you Representative and Mr
Senator off and Mr sharp.
Is this okay yes thank you sorry
everyone is looking at the map
so what just give folks some
time to get back to their seats.
Other questions from the
committee members.
Yes.
I'm so sorry as.
We'll go to the public for.
Actually actually we're going to
see if anyone from the public
would like to make a.
Okay letter is a letter.
Good morning it's a.
Good morning madam chair.
Madam chair.
As of the can committee thank
you very much and.
On both.
Representative Johnson for
sponsoring the bills.
And
Navajo Nation took an interest.
In the Public Education
Commission.
and.
Also decided to drop drop entire
statement for this particular.
entity
It was a good exercise.
To go through all the ten
districts.
And principally.
The reason why Navajo Nation
took an interest in the Public
Education Commission.
Is that
The district I.
schools.
That are overseen by the P. C..
All predominantly native
American.
Students at these particular
schools.
Of the four of them.
That are overseen by the PAC.
Are all located in.
McKinley County.
Three of them are located in the
city of Gallup.
And the third one fourth one is
located in Navajo New Mexico.
It's on the north west corner
of.
McKinley County.
And.
Saying that.
This is a.
Maybe I can Navajo land area.
And predominantly the students
that.
Attendees charter schools.
Our native Americans and
Navajos.
It's important to find.
Some level of match.
between district I.
And the enhancement of the
native American voting age
population in district five.
So we took the opportunity to.
Draw the map that includes.
All of the land area.
And population areas.
That.
Have.
That.
Into the schools plus have the
potential in the next ten years.
To further feed it and further
develop if necessary charter
schools these communities.
And.
It is important to look at that
match.
Where there is an enhancement in
the native American voting age
population.
And then we began to see.
The aspects of the voting rights
act.
Came to be at play in this
rendition of for district five.
Fifty two percent is a major
native American District of by
population.
Explain to yesterday that the in
order to have native Americans
elect a candidate of their
choice in a district out could
prove.
Bill and it's necessary to have
a sixty two percent native
American voting age population
about this case were unable to
match that of percentage of
sixty two percent.
The opportunity to enhance the
more about numbers from fifty
two to fifty five percent that's
the percentage point.
And in this case with a
three percentage point eight
percent of native American
voting age population that has a
significant impact on the the
strength of native American
boating activities so full that
bridges over the characteristics
of what Navajo Nation took into
consideration in addition as
we're going through this whole
process of providing expanding
on map.
we did also find at the
beginning that if you take
historic win Hispanic origin
population
that sent a significant number
of districts.
It was five districts that we
saw but of course that's not the
data that's being used to
present on the majority of
Hispanic population.
so with that madam chair members
of the commission.
we seek your favorable
consideration of thanks the line
thank you.
Thank you.
Is there anyone else like to
speak.
And is there anyone on the zoom
I would like to speak.
Okay okay so the lan unsent has
raised a hand so we will go to
the committee.
Representative Ortez.
You have a question.
past had a patch for okay okay
Representative I think.
Thank you madam chair.
I do have several questions and
madam chair and representative
okay may I direct questions
directly to Mr etcetera all
these thank you for.
you madam chair and Mr center of
which of the three concepts most
closely follows the existing a
district in patterns for of the
commission.
Madam chair representative type.
Question which plan is most
similar to the current districts
yes
Concept.
That's why I got the letter
today I guess house bill six all
of that was done to that plan
was adjust the boundaries to
account for population shifts.
But.
So madam chair and the Mr center
of concept
It is what we have now and you
can.
Because you're dealing with some
rate of population you have to
do some some unusual things in
my mind looking at eastern New
Mexico those are long tall
districts extend in one case
district nine the full length of
the the state of.
But that's what we have now and.
These other two concepts we've
kind of drawn at least this New
Mexico a little different
concepts State.
I presume that when concepts
state was drawn.
You were looking at school
district boundaries particularly
in Travis county is that
correct.
If you.
Many focus in on on the rostrum
we can maybe discern whether
we're talking about the dexter
Independent School District of
the Hagerman school district as
we
line is but since Travis county
split in two I kind of want to
just make sure that those made
of school district boundaries.
Madam chair
Representative are sensitive to
school district boundaries where
we could be with the numbers
worked.
Yes there is there a way to.
Zoom in closer so we can see
highways and
towns or whatever maybe we can
but let me just hold on one
second that representative that
we'll get some more details.
So.
So madam chair that's my
preference would be not to split
school districts into two
separate
Districts unless we absolutely
have to Albuquerque I presume we
have to because of population
the the in smaller towns I would
think we can get every town and
every school district taken care
of so so that does look like
the.
The best men and like other
school districts as well as the
occasion school district which
gets the panhandle of of Travis
county would be in one district
the Roswell Independent School
District will be completely and
district eight to the north
right now all.
Mike Taylor I believe is the
district eight representative to
the commission and then under
this plan he would be.
Also and district eight as the.
So that's consistent madam chair
and Representative Deborah you
can see his house his residence
there when we try it we
on paired the incumbents as was
mentioned earlier sometimes the
P. C. even as our type
recruiting candidates so we try
to keep the incumbents unpaired
and we were sensitive to school
districts we're we could be at
that there Taylor was one of
those candidates of actually
asked to run and I think he's
the only one on the ballot so it
was not one of those twist arms
or or given an appointment
actually order it
so I appreciate that.
You're doing the same thing with
respect to concept the because
Russell is even more split in
concept the.
Get sent cities and towns on the
edge of streets.
So if I'm reading your mask
correctly come this concept.
I want to put a school district
is split between two separate
commission districts districts
eight and nine.
And in fact even parts of
Russell.
Are taken out of
What's now district and put in
the most of Russell's put into
district nine and the current
commissioner for
District date would now live in
district nine.
I I I I have some real concerns
there and and if this is the one
that advances is there a way to
maybe twenty because of of its
more similar to.
Concepts the with respect to
southeast New Mexico because I I
would assume that the Human
Rights Commission of the Navajo
Nation could care less about.
That is County.
it wouldn't Mr Senator offered
me some way to tweak that wind
to still accomplish the
population.
By moving that line more in line
with what we see and concepts
we.
Madam chair representative
Nibert we can sure try what were
the things were blessed with
with the deviations of plus or
minus five percent five percent
of the ideal population of the
district gives us more leeway so
we could make that attempt.
Well.
Is it capable of being done in
the next few minutes or two to
distracted.
We could take a break and try
our.
But if if you if that was the
will of the chair
Madam chair all tell you that
that that that will be a deal
breaker for me and we could sit
here all day and talk
where you can have them maybe do
that and if that's the okay with
the Representative try to take
care of that issue that might
resolve my problems and the
number of questions that I might
wish to ask.
Representative would you be
amenable to to taking that
moment and conferring with their
your witnesses to discuss that
and and come back and and let us
know what you decide yes madam
chair and I concur okay so let's
take a few minutes.
Jeff Minter were there some
other questions might lead to a
reduction among the okay and
madam chair I certainly yield
the floor to other question but
I would like to share I like
the opportunity to any question
of the mall.
The name is
conflict Representative Nibert
Representative Nibert still has
the floor all of the old.
Okay it is one report that
whatever that is tell them.
Representative thank you madam
chair thank you representative
Nibert for for yielding.
Representative Johnson and
witnesses Mr center of
My County also has this issue
where with the with concept nine
this is inTaos.
in concept not concept each P.
line it's
it's two different commissions
seats.
The floor we have previously is
that how it is now it's
The county Taos County reviews
review County Colfax County are
are all put everyone
in one commission district I
want to understand.
Why tell us is now split between
two and is that is that a
population issue.
How would that affect you know
the the school district's in
Taos county so this is concept
he.
So to log sixty four then.
To push.
Hold.
Madam chair representative
artists in current house bill
nine as presented by Mr center
out it was explained that the
there's more concentration of
native lands in district five as
a result the cut out the S. to a
field area of San Juan County
and put it in the district ten
in order to that meant some part
had to reduce its population in
the study with Colfax and seems
to work its way westward until
it finally came into balance and
that's why you see what you see
here.
Thank you madam chair
representative Johnson.
I'd like to also sit down with
you.
Along with Representative Iver
thank you chair.
Representative.
Are there any other members.
That have any other questions.
Okay great so I stepped out of
the room of it but it's my
understanding that we're gonna
make some take.
Yes.
And how long the anticipate
that'll take we can probably go
right but.
This is.
Is.
Ten minutes.
That this house.
Madam chair.
Madam chair I would like to
defer to Mister center off to
make a comment and explain how
much it might take.
Well the I I think the Russell
issue this simpler
the other issue would also
depend on a we're I guess
assuming that.
what Mr Gorman prefers and
districts I.
He would like to camp and so
there might be so really around
to settle the tie was probably
could affect other districts at
us we just lower the native
American percentage of district
I.
Sissoko can you live with the
threat is or or.
Madam chair you can't you can.
Madam chair representative I
guess I can't okay so that it
just becomes the Ross will issue
hello
The Mr covetous probe one issue
about the flipping of the
numbers.
Two one explained that.
In New Mexico.
Look at the totality if you see
the purple dashed lines these
are the current districts C. had
both eight and nine occupying
the entire eastern side of the
state.
So when you create a different
configuration that includes both
districts and sometimes as well
which one should be eight which
one should be nine and in this
case in this plan is chosen the
Northern District of the line
item eight in the in the lower
district in our plans we had
eight in the top line in the
bottom and if making a change we
can easily flip the numbers of
the districts to reflect the
current incumbents and that that
doesn't that's fine.
Madam chair representative
Nibert.
The numbers and putting.
And has districts so to speak.
This
stories nine change.
Or that we're.
The.
Right so by flipping.
Or or.
Yeah right.
So we have this concept the.
For the.
You have the means ways of ours.
Hey your.
Okay.
Okay and the other two week
being of the school district
issues.
Okay the so that then after
flipping the numbers than that
our mission madam chair
Representative Johnson that
would be the only fix than that
we're looking at.
Representative Nibert.
Yes.
So how long will that take to
come plate.
This can be done very quickly
the madam chair and
The I'm I'm I'm I'm advocating
for them I can get this comp is
very quickly okay sec wait break
for.
And
thirty minutes I come back at
eleven thirty.
Actually that's not our.
Point break for twenty minutes
and come back at eleven twenty.
Members.
To to.
I don't know how.
The
can you do this in twenty
minutes is yes seven Madam chair
of the people at the to the two.
Okay.
Twenty minutes.
This is.
Well twenty minutes discussion
otherwise we can come back after
a long.
Okay meditation and chair okay.
And then Representative Ely do
have a question.
