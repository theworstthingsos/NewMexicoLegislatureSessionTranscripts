Department of Justice. The
Treaty division division
director, Colonel W and I have
with the division one of the
other than us.
Beyond it. We went downstairs,
and so with that we're now going
to head on to the next item on
the agenda, which is going
through our work plan for this
interim committee, and with
that, I'm going to hand it over
to Mr Marc Edwards. Thank you,
Mr Chairman, Mr. Chair members
of the committee. You should
have in front of you, eh?
Proposed work plan. It is
similar to the work plans that
we've had in the last few years.
One thing I will point out the
committee started breaking
things down into various
categories a number of years
ago.
So it
There's the traditional land and
fire. Uh, water land management
issues, fire issues, There's the
traditional land acquisition and
management of those lands.
issues. Uh, the category on the
second page of governance,
capacity and building the
governance capacity. Um
There are a lot more items under
that and have been in the last
couple of years.
And then reports from individual
land grants and
Land grant related agencies like
the Land Grant Council.
Typically, the committee also
hears from the Circular
Commission and the Seiki
Association, partly because
those entities psyche is in land
grants often are interwoven
communities.
And
Partly because the sake is
because of their statutory
history.
Have had a
Longer time to learn the
governance issues that face
small political subdivisions.
And so there's been a lot of
good cross pollination and
learning between those two.
What's missing from this
particular?
Proposed work plan is economic
development.
Uh, for number of years,
economic development was a
category it
Often didn't have enough quite a
lot of items under it. But the
committee wanted to
Start encouraging land grants to
develop some of their own, Uh,
economics.
And there are some items that
I've put under some of the other
categories with relation to
that.
In particular the
Getting a status update. Maybe a
tour of the what had been the
Piedra loom Brave Visitor
center.
Which three land grants
purchased from the Forest
Service a number of years ago.
It's now called, the mayor said
he's or not this knee. This
center Um and
They would like to talk about
where they are and where they
plan to go with that. Ah
The land. Grant Council has been
doing a number of
Or working with a lot of land
grants on individual projects,
so that particular category will
Crop up in various other
presentations, but I wanted to
highlight that it's not listed
as a
As a particular category in the
work plan. Um
I, Mr Chair. Those are the main
categories. I could go through
each of these sub points in
there, but that's a long list.
It might be better to simply
move on to the
Proposed locations and dates
unless there are any questions
from the no questions. Let's
move forward with the proposal
on the final page. You will have
You'll see a proposed schedule
for this committee.
Ah, The first meeting is
proposed for July 25th 26th.
And because, uh, there we have
concerns with
He new rules that we
Are putting it or the council
has put in that.
Requires that if there's going
to be in person comment, which
is very common at this committee
That there also has to be the
capacity for Webcasting comment,
and not all of the locations
that this committee
traditionally goes to have that
capacity. So
Ah!
This.
This proposal is that instead of
going to like lap a taco or two
couple lean for the
Land grants that are in the Rio
Arriba area.
That
Northern New Mexico college, be
the location and we invite those
light brands to come to their
Similarly for
The land grants that are on the
east side of the Sangre de
crystals.
Instead of going to individual
grants. The idea is to go to New
Mexico Highlands.
The
Exception here is
It looks like I've talked with
the
Board chair for these. Ah
San Antonio Dallas Worthless
land grant, which is the policy
dis land grant.
She believes that
They can secure the local
library in the local library has
the capacity.
For us to do Webcasting. So if
that pans out the proposal is
for the grants, you know
The idea was that this year
instead of doing the east side
of the sandy is in the Manzano's
with the committee would look
At the issues with land grants
on the West side.
And that
Location would fit that.
Um
And that would be the October
I might point out a couple of
other things just as specific.
Issues this year, a number of
grants that have been dormant
for a long time like the Dona
Ana grants.
Ah, the grant and sick or oh,
And when I say dormant for a
long time, I'm talking about a
couple of generations.
Have either reached out to
members of the committee or to
the Language Council and have
indicated that their community
would like to reactivate.
Their land grant capabilities
and come back within the
community of land grants.
And the evidently the Las Vegas
Land Grant, which has had its
own separate statute in a very
unique way of operating.
They're the only language whose
board is appointed by a
Court. They're not elected. Uh,
well, the current board is
thinking, evidently thinking
that they should be elected and
they would like to repeal their
current statute and come in
within the General Land. Grant
Statute chapter 49 Article one
Ah, so
Part of this proposed work plan
is to have a discussion and
examined the different
challenges that those separate
land grants would face in either
reconstituting themselves were
coming into the general
jurisdiction of Article one, as
opposed to having a separate
With that'll stand for Thank
you. And it's important to note
that were functioning as a
subcommittee today and will not
be voting on this work plan, But
we will be having a discussion.
and with that I want to head
over to represented Garcia.
Mr Chair.
Okay?
Representative.
Mhm. Gracias. Um
Perhaps tomorrow, Chairman. Um
um, you know, um one thing Mark.
That, um
I think the committee
Uh um.
Kind of merits. Um
To kind of have
Addressed in the interim.
Is, um
Um, pulling forth a panel.
Ah of
Concerned.
Um, individuals, entities that
can kind of give the committee
uh, holistic perspective.
On
Uh huh.
Creating, um, Land Grant
Infrastructure fund.
And, uh, currently we have
A
A tribal infrastructure fund.
We have a colonial
infrastructure fund.
And we have Mr Chair, I'll water
Trust Board Infrastructure fund.
And, uh, yeah. The reason that I
bring this up is because
If we look at the, uh
If we look at the Capitol out a
that
Nine grants. Ah, pursue
And are funded and not funded.
Um
Overwhelmingly about 75% of the
projects are not funded.
During the regular legislative
session.
But there's still dire need in
our land grant system. Uh,
speaker. I mean, that's the
military for
For these type of infrastructure
projects.
So what I'd like to kind of
proposes that
Um, we have a panel.
And bring forth those entities
like
Ah!
Department of Finance
Administration, maybe Mortgage
finance authority.
And see how
This, uh, nine Grant
Infrastructure fund would be
structured.
And also Mr Chair. The specifics
in terms of what projects
Ah, the land grants would
qualify for
Um
And also the dynamics in terms
of the
Revenue.
For the fund.
The way that the three
infrastructure funds are
structured is
They're they're coming off of a
4.5%.
Um
Of the severance tax bonding
capacity.
That's how they're funded.
So we want to understand what
that means.
And if we need to bring in the
Department of Finance
Administration to tell us that
What that means, Um
Specifically what that 4.5 maybe
has been for the last 10 years
with these three other funds and
what we can expect.
The land grant.
Infrastructure fund to be
Once we implement it, um and, um
Uh um.
And those are just some
Some key points that I
Um, have addressed in terms of
the
The dynamics of fund.
But I think in mark
Researching that.
Uh um.
That concept.
Uh, we can identify probably
more specific.
Items that the committee would
need to
Grapple with and understand.
And hopefully you know if
We have all our ducks in order.
Maybe we could
Come up with a viable piece of
legislation.
At the end of the inner
Um
Also, Mr Chair, Um
In regards to the, um
My mark mentioned the the
That there's some land grants
that would like to revitalize.
And we organize.
Um
But there's also some land
grants that kind of are dormant.
The fall under our
The general provisions like for
example, a Hoya
Um
And, uh, we just haven't had
much communication with them.
Um
And, uh, the Hoya is south of
So of
Berlin.
And north of Socorro.
Mhm and
The
A natural
Um wildlife.
Um
Park is
Was
Or is on the common ends of the
local language,
And, you know, even though
they're the land grant doesn't
Have ownership of of that space
and the longer but
That's what the Hoya is, Um,
also Mr Chair. I've kind of
started dialogue with some
people in the borderland Grant.
And I still haven't kind of
fully, uh, established the
concrete.
Um
Relationship with some of these
individuals, but they were
Interested in kind of
understanding someone of the
background history of
Some of their ancestors.
In that area and
I have a call in to a young
lady. Um
But we haven't connected yet.
And I want to see if maybe there
is that opportunity with this
contact.
To maybe, um
Um
Began to
Be more specific in terms of how
the committee
Maybe the Land Grant Council.
Can be of service or union Bank
grad studies.
Can be of, um
Service to to these individuals
in terms of them making head
weight.
Ah!
With their interest in
Land grant of Sapporo and
And what that means in terms of
Possible reorganization.
Also, Mr Chair, Um
At our sites. It's usually been
Um
Kind of customary
To kind of involved.
Land grants in that regional
area of where
The site. Location for the
committee is
Um
By way of these land grants
doing reports to the committee
in terms of their
There. Um ah, status in terms of
their business operation there.
Then grant issues and needs
maybe bringing forth capital
issues that they want the
committee to
Understand, Um in a dress.
Um, and we've also kind of also
included.
Mr Chair. Um
Article two land grants
In our presentations at some of
these regional meetings.
For example, Bartolomeo Sanchez.
They're in the
UM and Rio River County.
And there's the
The land grant in the Penasco. I
mean, in the
Further south.
Um, in the
Um I forget the name of that
land grant offhand.
But there are articles to land
grant as well.
Um
I know that, uh, the Mr Chair
that that language and in
The Valley.
Had expressed interest in
possibly becoming a division.
But, um, there hasn't been any
really.
Consolidated effort on their
board to move in that direction.
And also the Bartolomeo Sanchez.
As expressed interest. Um
Um
Not in depth interest, but
Kind of like light interest and
also doing the same.
Uh, but they haven't really kind
of
Put a plan into action, too.
Realize.
Becoming a political
subdivision.
And these are structured real
different than in our
General provisions land grants
in or 20
26 9, grandson or political
subdivisions.
Um
And, um
You know, um
An issue that kind of keeps
Coming up. Um
That's that's really kind of
hard to address is, um
At the Terra Maria has to
grapple with is the
The three game refugees up
there.
The sergeant charm A and I'm
freeze.
And actually, they encompass
pretty close to 60,000 acres.
Comments.
And these are all grants. These
are all
Game and fish game refugees that
tone.
That, basically, um
Um
We're part of the
Of the Catherine
Theft.
Uh,
So I always went. Thomas Catron
kind of control of the comments.
Ah, and these game refugees kind
of fall within.
That
That particular um
Attempt by Catron.
Um
To seize the common
Which he was very successful.
Um
And I think the has
Um, Mr Chair. Kind of, um
That there's a need there to
also
Be able to provide them with
kind of technical.
Legal
Kind of perspectives on
How they can move forward.
And I know that one thing that
I've been working on with them
is
The possibly possibility of a
lawsuit.
Similar to
The Sangre de Cristo Land grant
in the Sunrise Valley in
southern Colorado.
Where
The lawsuit is not one of taking
ownership of the prior common
man.
But one of traditional use
rights.
To grazing.
To Halloween of arrival, Sand.
To the removal of Vegas. Um
Um, fence post or
Materials to build a fence post.
Uh, hunting rights.
The whole gamut of traditional
use rights.
And I think, uh,
Hmm.
This committee has been to San
Luis.
We have met with
Those, um
Um warriors.
Champions.
Ah!
And Grant writes in the Sunday
the Cristo.
Um, and they're very
Giving and willing to also be a
resource.
To any land grant.
In New Mexico.
You know, uh
Ah!
That maybe is looking at similar
attempts as they did
And that was kind of a 20 year
battle.
The good thing Mr Chair is that
they had
Pro bono.
Legal help.
Otherwise they couldn't have
really accomplished much.
Um and
And also what's disturbing Mr
Chair with Cara Maria is, uh
Kind of this, Um
Um
Political sabotage.
Uh, the game and fish.
Regarding, uh
The finalizing of the transfer
of the Laguna del Campo.
And it's all based on the water.
I'd issue
And, um
You know when the game and fish
Decided to turn over that lake.
To the Terra Maria during the
Martinez administration.
Um
They were really, um, gone home.
About
Finalizing that transaction.
And it's been under, uh
The Michelle the hungry Sherman
ministrations.
Under director Sloan.
That
We've dropped the ball.
And, uh,
Uh, you know that league
Was basically Mr Chair. Um
Neglected by the game and fish.
Um
And that was one of the reasons
that they felt that the transfer
would be
Productive mainly because they
Terra Maria
Would have access to capital
outlay monies.
To build up the lake, too.
Build up that the
The bathrooms on the lake.
Jr. Just overall
Make it
Uh, you know it. Really, um
Kind of state of the art.
Uh um.
Yeah. Fishing net fishing
excursion.
For
That whole region.
And, um uh,
Uh and I think there's more that
with this committee can do.
Um
Pass me the land Grant can do.
To kind of really
Bring that transfer to a
conclusion.
Mr Chair.
Um
And that's that's all I
I have to share with the
committee.
And Mark
Thank you, representative. So
maybe we can get La Hoya and so
according to join us when we're
in, plus Sita's
Joined it in the discuss any
other comments or questions.
Senator Stephanie
Thank you, Mr Chair. I think,
Mark, um, that
One more round Placido as we
would extend an invitation to
love their bordering, um
The problem. Oh, and
There's always issues about
water and
The status in the involvement of
the federal government. Thank
you.
Mr Chair. I'm not familiar with
lava.
It. Mr. Chairman, Senator, if
you have a contact number that
Thank you, senator and the other
questions or comments
Think nine. I'm gonna go back
and let everybody know that the
speaker has appointed
representative Con to be a
voting member today. The pro TEM
has appointed senators. Guy
goes Lopez and Stefan IX to be
voting members, so we're not
functioning as a subcommittee.
We can definitely vote on the
work plan.
And so seeing no other, um
Legislators who have any
comments or questions. What's
the will of the committee?
Motion to adopt the work plan by
Senator Pinto.
2nd 2nd by Senator Lopez, if
anyone is an opposition, please
raise your hand.
Saying man, the work plan has
been adopted.
Thank you, Mr Chair members of
the committee.
Thank you.
Well, next move to our next item
on the agenda, which is public
comment. If you have any
comments, I ask that you come up
to the desk at the front. There
are two people who have signed
up. I'll start off with one
Sanchez, followed by Ricardo.
Ricardo. No public comment, want
any public comment?
Okay?
Anyone else who wants to provide
any type of comment? Now is your
time to shine.
We're then going to chair Um
I think so. Even on the work
plan, I don't know. We're still
getting probably do tours, too.
In there.
This chair. The tradition of
this committee is that there's
always a tour on the second day.
Uh, it's given that the
committee will be meeting at a
number of
Centralized locations. The
question will be which land
grants decided to host the
committee for a tour of their
areas.
But yes, I fully anticipate that
people have talked to at various
land grants, so they are
interested in having the
committee.
Do tours so
Unless the committee decides not
to that has is my plan to set
those up.
Thank you and Senator Pinto,
Since we're going to be an
external, I'm actually going to
see if I can get the lowrider
community to show up.
And take us for a cruise through
the valley. And I'm being very
serious about this. I like to
tell people that I come from the
lowrider capital of the world
where we're brown. We're down.
We're low to the ground, but I'm
really thinking about getting
the lowrider community to get us
to do a tour through Estonia,
Like, um, on a cruising day,
I'll show you where we meet up
which borders one of the land
grants where they meet up.
And then we can meet up and have
a conversation there. But I'm
planning on each of us will be
in Espanola will have a low
rider that will drive us through
town. You can experience my
subculture of the beautiful
Escamilla Valley.
Well below writers talking in
the background. And with that,
just a reminder that we will be
meeting July 25th and 26th at
northern New Mexico College and
Espanola. And with that, my
