please, thank you
again for hosting us.
We're really honored to be here
and when you all are ready, Superintendent
President,
please,
>> we're the 80, thank
you. See, I didn't know how to do
that.
Now, I can hear myself.
We're the 18th largest,
uh, school district in New
Mexico. We encompass
a little bit over 1000 square
miles. We, we're the
southern half of Valencia County,
the northern half half of
Socorro County. And
when you drove into our parking lot, you
see our central elementary school
right to the left. So
we have city schools,
city schools for us, maybe not
for a PS or
Las Cruces. And then we
have our rural schools when you
travel down into
Socorro County with uh La
Promesa Elementary. We
have a lot of kids
here that come from different
families.
We are in the process
of uh
rebuilding a new school
and one of our elementaries
to the north. And when
we did that, we had to write
size, we were asked to write
size because our, our uh
populate
student population has been
dwindling and we've
seen the, the
census data, birth rates are
going down, especially in Valencia
County. And
so in order to,
to build that new
school, we've right sized our
district. And so I
feel very confident
that we're, we are
using the
investment that you guys have
made in our buildings and our
infrastructure in the right
way. And
we, we're, we're doing what we
need to do when
you look at the,
is it when you look
at our, our enrollment,
we're staying steady,
you know,
back in the two
thousands in
the, in the odds,
we are probably close to about
45 4700
kids. Right now. We're gonna
stay around 35.
We're not growing, but we're
not getting smaller.
Even with, with the
birth rates going down, we
still get a lot of kindergartners.
I don't know where they're coming from, but I'll take
them if you look
our, our, for this year,
our current enrollment for pre
K through six is
1887.
And you know, I mentioned earlier that
new school that we're building,
we're putting in pre
K, we're gonna have, we
want to have a new Mexico pre
K and a DD pre K
in that classroom. And
our, my goal is to have
one
at each um
quadrant point. So we
have one in the south. I want
one in the north. We'll
have one here, we have one
here in town and then I want
one to the east side
so that we're able to better
serve our community.
We have right now. We
have 531
middle
schoolers
besides being my board
president, Mr Tucker was also
my principal when I was
teaching at the middle school.
And I think back then we were close
to 1000 kids, weren't we?
And so we have seen a
significant drop in
population there.
And at, at,
at our, between our two high
schools, we have our comprehensive
high school, which is be high
school and we have a,
our alternative high school
which is infinity High school between the
two high schools, we have almost
1100 students.
Our goal is to
continue to, to
uh increase
our enrollment. And how
can we partner with the city
in order to
create development? And we
understand that what our role is,
if companies want to look
into moving,
moving into Berlin,
they're gonna look at the education that's
offered. And so what can we
do to improve the
education?
So your own challenge.
So when you look at our challenges,
number one is
academic. We're
not
post COVID,
we are seeing
increases. We
are, we're probably, I
think last year
we saw 6% and
you'll go over it more but
6% on, on
the average increase in L A
and math. We, we want
to get better.
Um
And part of what we're trying, what we're
recognizing is
we have to change
adult behaviors,
we have to change adult beliefs. I was
talking to Director
Pera ornament before
this. How do
we
help teachers,
help administrators, help
board members, help
superintendents
who have
reached a point of success
in their life. And we're
gonna tell them you need to
change, you need to change your
mindset because it's not working
right now. And I'm, I'm
gonna go into this a little bit
more and
why I say that.
Um
and it, it goes back
to one
of the,
you guys call the
legislative
weekly update,
great resource. And
so, Director per
ornament shares that with us. And in
December, we
saw the
report that nationwide
report that 20%
of the of the population
in New Mexico, ages 16
through 24 are disengaged. They're not
in school and they're not working.
All of you are educators
has when I see
that II, I
use one word and I've
told this to all my
people. I'm
sad that saddens
me because
this is, I'm finishing
my 29th year all in
Berlin. I'm not from here,
but I came here and I never
left
that. Saddens me because
I think that what we
do as educators
is a vocation. It's a
calling.
And when we see
that 20%
are not
engaged, what do
we need to do different?
And I remember I come
from a family of educators.
There's been a member of my family
involved in public education in
the state of New Mexico
continuously since
1938.
And so I grew up as an educator.
And I remember when my dad
retired as an administrator,
there was a superintendent Rosell, his
name was Fred Pomey
and Doctor Pomey hired my
dad to go. Uh This was in
the early nineties, hired him to
go and
bring um
dropout's back into school.
My dad did a good job
but they didn't graduate.
And here's why they didn't graduate.
Nothing had changed.
And so I see that as a challenge, I'm
getting a little bit ahead of myself.
But I see that as the challenge
that we face,
how can we change
to make
students involved in their
education? And I think the,
the bill you sponsored uh
Mr Chair
with the high school
graduation requirements,
the redo or
restructuring will help
us, it gives
us the flexibility that we
need as we start to
plan, how are we going to get
kids reen
engaged in what they're
doing?
Part of that part of what it goes
along with that. As I mentioned,
is changing, the mindsets of
adults is also
changing, is looking at
our, our equitable
practices. So we've
spent this year
looking at our grading
practices,
what can we change?
And I want to be clear because people,
when I say this,
when I've said this to others,
they say you're lowering the bar, I'm
not lowering the bar. I
am not lowering the bar. We're keeping
the bar high.
We're going to use
equity. We're gonna change our
equity practices to
make sure everybody can reach the bar.
And if you
guys,
everybody's always seen the
one where you have the three
kids, it's an old time
cartoon and they're like
trying to watch a baseball game.
You have the kid that can see over the wooden
fence fence and can see the
game. You have the medium sized
kid that's looking through a knot hole and can
see the game and then you have the shorter kid
that can't see the game at all.
And so the pur the purpose
is put a chain link fence
and put in something that they can all
see. The way I look
at. What we're trying to do is
we're gonna give supports to
students to help them reach that
bar. We're not lowering the bar.
We're gonna give supports to help them reach
the bar. And so we've
looked at our, our grading practices,
we've looked at our discipline practices
to see what we can do.
What changes can we make?
Let's look at our data
are we,
are we unintentionally
bean
unfair to different
population, different
subpopulations that we
have in, in our, in
our school district
with that. How
does all of this affect the
student outcomes?
Because when
we look at our graduation rate
and understa we
all understand that this is two years
ago, we're at
67%.
That's not good enough. That's
not good enough.
How do we increase that graduation
rate? Well, the first thing we have to do
is get kids to come to school.
You know, when on the average,
we start off with about 300
freshmen at Belin High school.
Last night, we graduated
Mi Representative
Mila, we graduated
100 and
80
a little bit less.
So where do those kids
go?
That's what we gotta figure
out.
So when we look at changing adult
behaviors, if you're familiar
with, with the
student outcome form of
governance that AP S has
gone to our board has
adopted this, we're in the process
of this right now
and I think it's
encouraging, it
gives it, it brings in
community input, community
involvement. So we have an
idea of what
um our
constituents want.
It gives them a voice
um the other
thing I like that this does,
it, it helps us
create a profile of a graduate.
It's not what we think, it's what
our community thinks. Being
a rural community. You can, I,
I don't think you'd be surprised
that uh
college is valued but also
career of the trades.
And what can we do to
increase the trades? It
fits right in with our strategic
plan and then we use our strategic
plan to go on to the 90
day plan. Did you switch this
line?
I talked about what we're doing with
equity. Again.
We, I mentioned the
grading policies and the
student discipline.
We're also looking at our
staffing
because I unintentionally
things happen and
sometimes we end up with a
school that
doesn't have
the same number of
highly qualified teachers,
level twos, level threes
and mainly at the
elementary that
other sites may
have. So what can we do
to intentionally make
sure that those resources that we
have are shared by all?
That's something we're, we're, we're
looking at and always
the, the our focus is on
equitable funding and
support.
It's not a one size fits, fits
all for
us.
Student behavior. I don't
know about you guys. We
in your districts, in
your schools, student
behaviors changed
it has and
behaviors. I was a middle school
teacher and I, when I
first became a middle school
princip, I became a principal
as a middle school principal.
Behaviors. We're seeing at elementary
now are the behaviors that I used to see
at middle school and they've gone
down, they've, they've gone down
through the grades,
what we can't do. This is
my belief. I
can't kick them out. They're
still our kids. I do
not want to kick kids
out
and that's the easy fix that. A
lot of people tell me, just kick
them out. We only want the kids
here that,
um,
you wanna wanna get an
education? I
disagree with that.
And so we're, we're
structuring. I mean,
there's things that you have to ask
kids to leave for. I don't even like the term
kick out. You ask kids to leave.
There are certain things that you have to
do, but that
shouldn't, that should be
a very small outlier,
a very small number of
students. And so
looking at our practices
and really, and
maybe this, you guys may think,
well, why didn't they think of this before?
But because we should,
that's where I'm going
with this. We do
academic interventions
all the time. We
see a student struggling
with reading or math
or whatever the case may be.
When we intervene, we create
a plan to help
the student, we
need to do better with
our behavior. And so
the challenge that we, the for
next year, the challenge I've given
our uh principles
is don't wait until
they're, they're to the point that you
wanna kick them out or
ask them to leave before you start
intervening the
first time that serious
behavior occurs.
What resources do we
have? We're not
resource rich, but we're
also not resource poor.
And so working with our partners
and, and using the partnerships
that we've developed,
what resources can we
provide to those
students to change
the behavior? And how can we
involve the parents?
I can't stress this
enough. We need parental
involvement. I
cannot make changes
in your student if you're not
involved. And
so
we're looking at,
I call it restorative
practices
to give students the opportunity
to
make amends for the behaviors
that they've got. Again,
not lowering the bar.
I I, we safety is
our number one concern after
academics,
but let's
not,
excuse me. Let's not
be so quick to be
punitive.
And this is where, what I
call the 20%
initiative,
which I mentioned
earlier are those
kids that aren't engaged?
How can we attack
this?
We're gonna use uh work
based learning to try and
get there. We don't have
that. Well, we're
gonna start, I, I'm
actually holding interviews next
week to hire a work
based learning coordinator so
that we can get it started
to start creating
these. We have
the partnerships to
enhance the partnerships we have
with our business community to
provide uh paid
or unpaid internships to
students. We're also
working with U and NBC,
our local U and M campus
where we're gonna be
uh transporting
students during the day
so that they can earn
college door credit in the
CTE. We are,
we do a great job of
it with
uh, academics. I think
we earned over $1000 credit
slash this current year in
academics.
We wanna put a focus on
CTE and increase
that and one of the ways
that we, we think we can do
it and
this is a
uh
investment by the district
because we won't get funded
for the transportation, but is
to provide that transportation
to and from UN M BC
in order to
help our kids. And our goal
is that when they graduate,
they'll be able to
have the qualifications necessary
to apply for an internship
or an apprenticeship. And the good
thing about this, you see, uh
superintendent from
the uh Doctor
Kettler in the audience, we're
working on it together. This is a
Valencia County
uh initiative
with Doctor Deum from
UN MVC and myself
and Doctor Kettler. So it's
gonna benefit all our kids
and, and that's exciting.
What do, what do we do for those
students that
have transportation
issues? We've got,
we've got to
find a way in-house
that we can provide those same
opportunities.
And, and, and when we're
talking about the work based learning
because if I say
you're gonna have a job, one of our,
our big uh partners
is Cisneros Brothers. They're, they're a
manufacturer.
You can go, if you can get over
there, you have a job. But
I, I'm, I'm dependent on the bus.
I can't get there. We
have to find those opportunities
in-house and we've started a pilot
with our, with our
special ed population
at our alternative school this
year where we
have them
um
doing work, study, work
based learning type jobs, getting
paid. But within the
district, we have
one that works here
for us. We have others
at different sites just
trying to figure out what works, what
doesn't and how are we gonna start
this and how are we gonna take
this to the masses?
We also have to get this, this,
get this going at.
Um Thank
you at the elementary
level.
It's in my mind, it starts
with pre K or kindergarten.
And that's where you start with a college
or not college career,
exploration, hands
on learning project based learning
all of those things.
And our goal is to increase
the student outcomes
if we can. And I, I don't
want to say we want to increase
graduation rate
because if they
don't have the skills,
then they're not ready to go
into the
workforce or on to college.
I'm hoping that a by-product
of providing them with the
skills will be an
increase in our graduation
rate. And
I think I've covered all. So
I'm gonna turn it over to Miss Sanchez
and she's gonna go into what
we're doing
academically.
You want
to
>> Mr Chair? Um
I'm Renee Sanchez again
and I'm honored that you guys are here
today. Um
Just a little bit about my
purpose really quick.
Um I'm a lifelong resident
here in Berlin. Uh many
generations, I've
grown up as a stay at home
mom, teacher, principal
and um made
my way working with Mr
Sanchez
uh within the blend consolidated
schools. Uh I'm
here to talk about student
outcomes.
Um And
before I begin about student
outcomes, my
total purpose
here is
working under that belief that
all Children have capacity
and you guys need to know that.
And Mr Sanchez talked a little
bit about that, but that's my
whole core is
working under that
belief that all
Children have capacity and
those that work with me under my
leadership, understand that clearly
the community understands it.
My whole purpose is to give
every child
hope,
confidence and that desire
to learn. I keep
it simple. So
as I talk, you're
gonna fill my core coming
out on that belief
that every child has.
OK. So, and it starts with
leadership.
Um The leadership
comes with our district
strategic plan and,
and that comes with goals.
Um I focus on the
academic goals and the
instructional infrastructure
of the, of the strategic
plan. Uh We
have to submit a
fiscal year
25 educational plan
yearly and I've
been able to connect that
plan. So we're
not doing it twice, align
the strategic plan with the fiscal
year educational plan
that we submit every year uh
through New Mexico dash.
And I also aligning it
to the 90 day plans.
So the alignment of all
goals I'm not doing the work three
times, but I'm
transferring the work
and building it to,
to hit the elements of
funding through the
educational plan
and to connect how
funding impacts student
learning. So the goal
is to target student
learning and then
how do we spend our money
after that? Um What
are our goals? So that's
how those three connect.
Um I'm gonna focus a little
bit on site plans.
Site plans have, have
the key elements.
There's six elements in site
plans. You got a first,
the first element is surrounding
yourself with the right people.
The core team,
um setting
goals is the
second element and I'm just
uh narrowing it uh a
big document into
six key
points. Uh
identifying your
performance challenges in order to
set goals, you have to analyze
everything. So identify your
challenges,
um come up
with your performance,
uh your desired
outcomes and
simply create critical
actions. Mr Mr Sanchez
touched a little bit or a
lot. I think most of his
um
uh talk was about adult
behaviors and so the
critical actions are adult
behaviors to accomplish
what you want in your desired
outcome and to review
it every 30 60
90 days and
weekly during a structure
that's set at our districts during
PL CS where we analyze
student work weekly.
Uh And the biggest piece that I'm
gonna hit on the 90 day
plan is observation
and feedback. The
leader has to spend their time
in the classrooms and
so observation feedback
and I'll, I'll touch on that a little
bit more um on
building that teacher capacity.
Uh If we build
that teacher capacity,
that's, that is the number
one resource we have in our classroom,
the best resource we have in our classroom
is our teachers. So to
build that resource
is um taking
observation and feedback and
giving that.
Um
So
uh some of the
services and
intended outcomes,
we, we look
at uh case
management tutoring, reading
interventions and
after school programs right
now, we're kicking off the new
Mexico uh summer
program with a goal of having
2000, I mean,
10,000 students, we
have at least 15
teachers in our district
registered to instruct
um during
that program and it's for upcoming
eighth graders and outgoing,
I mean, upcoming kindergartners
and outgoing eighth graders. So our teachers
are gonna get trained for a full
week on a
focused intervention and
reading and
33 weeks.
Um we'll have uh
students coming in
for during
three weeks,
five days a week,
830 to 1230.
Um And then
also that's gonna
target the science of reading,
which supports uh letters
and all the the training our teachers
are going through K through six
along with the nine through 12
summer school program.
Um It's broken down
into different elements uh
through the
educational plan. One of the
elements we need to hit is
culturally relevant uh
professional
development. Uh And
curriculum development.
That's a critical piece
in the educational plan. I broke
it down into three
years.
Um Three
years
and
the whole plan is about
using clarity
and, and the high relit,
high reliability
schools model.
Um
And it touches on
the Marzano research
resources and site
based learning. So we,
what we've done this year is
build on clarity
and bring the resources
to match what Bolen
is doing. So we have
had um our, our
uh Marzano
resources come to Belen
and meet with a cohort
of principals and
teacher leaders
to build the clarity in the
classroom. We have a cohort of
50 right now.
And with that 50 they
represent every school
and the expectation
and the follow-through from that
is to lead
standard based learning in
every site. So it is a
district guarantee that every
principal is leading that
change. So
that that is a
big lift and
it's focusing on one
thing, providing
clarity to students
so they know what to expect.
And that's, that's really
big on the high reliability
school models. Um
So year one is
leading standard based learning
building proficiency skills.
So students know what to
expect from every
assignment and
and using clarity. So
the student understands their learning
progression. Mr Sanchez
talked about grading, it's
about the learning progression.
Um I'm not here yet. This
is my goal, but
if I provide progressions
of learning, I'm going to
hit my goal. Uh
If I just make a couple
of adjustments and, and
so year uh
two for fiscal
year 25
this year, we're working on
assessment um
of student learning using
a balanced assessment literacy
starting at the district
level, site level,
classroom level, student
level and then going down to the
parent level. So it
is uh an
assessment uh
strategy going
into those three models, year
three. We're
overlapping in year three right
now and we're looking at
program evaluation,
how are we evaluating our
program? Well, again,
observation and feedback is number
one. Um and
how it's impacting student
learning and the effectiveness
of clarity. We're, we're spending a
lot of money on professional
development, bringing
resources here to
belen uh to
make that
happen.
So I'm gonna go a little bit
deeper on clarity.
Um You're gonna hear that word a
lot. It, it's
about meeting academic
expectations.
Again, the
big lift is
assessment of student
learning.
Um
And the goal is to
build leadership capacity.
What is assessment literacy? It's
understanding the entire
child, it's not a
test, it's
understanding the
whole child. We assess
a student the minute they get
down from the bus or the
child uh or
down from their parents' car.
That's where assessment
starts. Um
You look at a student,
how was your day? You
look a little bit sad today. So
assessment starts and instruction
starts the minute they walk onto
your campus
and that,
that's a big lift of
understanding what assessment
literacy is uh
proficiency skills,
make sure students know what to
expect. They will
produce what you expect.
If you have a goal of
80% proficient
students are gonna feel
valued. And they're gonna say
Miss Sanchez really believes I can
get there rather than
let's have 20%
proficient. Let's set some high
ambitious goals. We
talk about teaching kids how
to fail. Well,
maybe we didn't get where we're not
where, where we wanna go, but
we're gonna do some progressions
to get there. And, and
so that is a big lift.
Um using the common
formative assessments as a district,
creating a district
guarantee that there is standards
that we're gonna, um have
in common. We're gonna
assess them as a district
and then we're gonna use
formative assessments to
check for understanding.
Uh And the biggest
lift as we check for
understanding is look at
student work. That's,
that's the biggest thing we look at student
work. We examine it
our, the
assignments if all
the students are failing
um in writing a closing
paragraph. Well,
then we, we
strengthen our assignment to
include the
expectations of a closing
paragraph. So they produce what
you expect. So that is a
big lift here in our
district. Uh We
also are gonna go into
whole group interventions.
There's
um
whole group interventions. Mr
Sanchez has introduced to
us a a learning platform
of Panorama
and it has tools
and I'm gonna go into
those tools. It's a,
it's a platform to unify
all data of a
student talking about assessment
literacy. This platform
has every piece of
data on a student.
It's streamlined to
support students.
Um It supports
academics, it
supports attendance,
uh emotional supports
and other behaviors that impact
student learning with
that platform. Each
teacher uh and,
and leader team has
the capacity to build a
playbook for each student
based on any of their
challenges. And it's housed
in one platform, it's all unified.
So this is a, a real uh
good investment
uh for our district.
The other investment we're, we're
starting to kick off is the new
Mexico Universal
uh design
for learning UDL tools.
Um We're gonna hit that
um with tools
and, and the reason we're hitting
that is
um the goal for
you to yell and I, you have it up
there is to create
motivated uh
expert learners who can
access their learning in
different ways. Mr Sanchez
talked about the, the chain link
fence they can
access if, if the,
the game is your
goal. Well, we
open up that chain link fence
to reach that goal. Um
So it's a different
access and, and to
sustain that effort.
Um They do that by
UDL is a mindset
change. It's not a program, it's a
mindset change
and it gives
students a choice for
learning um
different methods and it
removes the barriers for
learning. So UDL
is, is to me
keeping things simple,
how can you have a standard
to give them multiple ways
to learn and, and
it's, it's um it's
critical to, to give students
those, those ways to
learn. Um
So it's really
giving them all opportunities
to succeed.
It's building flexibility
so we can adjust for every
student. We talk
about meeting
every child has capacity. You're
gonna hear me say that a lot.
Um We adjust for
every student, every year
is a different year. And I
sometimes when I was leading
a school teachers kept
asking me, when are we gonna stop being
researchers? When are we gonna
stop taking apart
standards? We did the standards
last year and, and, and
it really comes down to
when you retire or when all kids
are exactly the same. So we
have to keep looking
at student work.
Um And so
again, it's presenting options
for learning and opportunities
um planning for
choice in different ways.
Mr Sanchez talked about
grading. It's not
about making the
curriculum easier. It's about
providing multiple access
points and feedback
to meet our expectation
as a district
um and allowing
individual
students with passions
and interests to access
their learning in order to find
their purpose. Um
So that's the big
mindset shift. I spent
a lot of time on U to L
because it's should
be a design for
learning.
Um
The next um is
talking about our strategic
plan, the strategic plan is
broken down into
four areas, academic
goals, instructional
goals, uh student
support, and success
goals and
recruit and hire, surround
yourself with the right people. It
takes time to surround.
Sometimes we, we say we
don't have enough teachers.
But what,
what is that? If you build
it, they will come. If you
have a good vision
in Belen, they're gonna wanna come
to Belen. And I, I believe
Mr Sanchez has surrounded
himself with the right people
to create that vision and
he keeps it simple. Be nice.
Bolen is Belen is a
good place so
surround yourself with the right
people.
And um
again, in, in
this
design, the strategic
plan a as we
review the tool,
it is gonna focus on
high reliability school
model. There's, there's five levels
of that model. We're
um of course a safe and
supportive model,
make sure all kids are safe. Mr
Sanchez talked about that.
Um my part
is creating that
guaranteed viable
curriculum. There is a
district guarantee that
every student has
to um
accomplish per grade
level uh each
year um and
clear goals and,
and using that competency
based um
learning. Are they
competent and ready
for the next grade
level.
OK. This is another
big one,
multi-layered systems of
support. Um We've
used this in many ways and it
comes down to meeting
the need of every child.
Uh This is access to
every child, all students,
OK. There, there's
basic elements and
Mr Sanchez again talked about
equity providing that equity
for students. That, that's a
big element,
data guided
instruction,
linking it to assessment
literacy. It's
we, we have to have that data
guided. If my student
walks down from that bus, you
start gathering data and
you align your instruction
to uh your students
along with student work.
Um that high
quality core
instruction that's part of
the the layered system.
Um The collaborative
structure is,
is
a must, you can't
work without a collaborative
structure. The structure
can't work unless the
district sets expectations
for every site principal
uh to run that
collaborative structure. And so what
we've done in our district is
every site principal has to
lead the weekly PL CS
to look at assessment
literacy and how their
students are doing
every day by examining
the simplicity of
their student work.
That's the customer,
that's their work.
And then how is it impacting
their assessment scores?
Are there scores coming
up? Are they they
meeting district uh
goals um
and, and different multiple data
points.
So
the positive school culture,
when student work is being
valued and examined,
that's gonna start creating
a culture. Uh students
are bringing you work, they
know the leader has set
the value of studying that student
work. Teachers are studying the work
so that puts the value in the
students. So with
that value, um
it, it can create that
positive culture and by
setting that vision,
health and wellness
that's critical.
Again, the minute they walk
onto your campus, you look at
that um and family
engagement um that
can go to the top. Mr
Sanchez talked about uh that
family engagement. I, I
really adore
um the community school
model because it involves
parent involvement,
not to observe the classroom,
but setting expectations
for parents um
spreading the vision of the
district to parents
and giving parents tools.
How because parents, how do I
support my child? How do I get
involved? A lot of times they're not
involved because there's
not clarity on how
to do it. So
if we teach parents how
to get involved
and say it's an expectation
in order to come to blend schools,
you have to do A B and
C in order for
your child to be successful. So, so
set some expectations
and that'll create a safe
net. Oh I'm coming to blend schools,
I have to set
a room for their homework. I have
to create a, a
pattern for,
you know, there, if there
is a clear expectation
from our district,
they'll get involved.
And that's the community school
model. Uh It, it
branches out to the
community and internships
and involving of our
current resources within
belen we have a, a school
la promesa elementary
beginning that process
uh which is a mindset shift
that all of us should,
should involve. So
that is a big key
element. So multi-layered
systems and support all students
belong into layer one,
we target every student,
layer two, we get a
specific more
targeted intervention
and layer three, we give
them the supports that we talked
about uh using that universal
design.
Um
And what do we
do? We program, we have to
evaluate our
programs,
um program evaluation,
how is it implementing?
So I did talk about
um the
strategy uh that,
that we're using. Um Mr
Sanchez has us in. So
which is strategy,
organization achievement
and resilience. That
is a state initiative. And
he has our leadership
team learning
how to uh evaluate
our programs and how we're doing that
uh excellent
program on digging
deeper on
what we're doing today at
the land schools. Um
And so the whole purpose is
to build leadership
capacity.
Um If a leader is
in the classrooms
all the time
and seeing what's happening in the
classrooms, the
students are gonna feel valued,
the teachers are gonna feel
valued
and scores will double
digit gain because
of that value. Um
So we need to
set the expectation at the
district level. And Mr
Sanchez um looking
at systems uh
on how to set the
expectations similar to how
to get parents involved.
What is the expectation
of our leaders to
be in the classrooms and
involved uh with
our most important
customer, which is our
student.
Um So
by doing that, the expectation
is to have Department
PL CS
uh looking at standard
align learning systems
having that uh
viable curriculum
common
across the board K through
12.
Um So
every student has
access to a common
resource um
U utilizing uh
district supports instructional
facilitators and
other uh mentor teachers
to build that teacher
capacity
um K through
12, coaching
using the coaching
and modeling of lessons
along with uh
facilitating uh
student learning and
examining student
work protocols. Those are
district
expectations.
Um Again,
evaluation of MLS
S, uh it's a, it's a
very good word, but if you're
not in the scenes,
um uh I usually
don't put an acronym because it's a
multi-layered system
and, and sometimes we get
lost in acronyms. But
um we have to,
within that system, there
is a uh a self
assessment that
every principal has to
do to identify
specific gaps, they
assess themselves um
as they begin their year
and it connects with social
emotional learning. Um
how to improve uh
student progress in that
area and how to improve
our staff culture. A
all those elements are within
the self
assessment.
OK. In the instruct instructional
piece, um this is
what I was talking about is the
district guarantee um
standard
resources.
The goal for our instructional
is to build
and streamline the instructional
model, we
utilize a lot of teacher
input uh
to uh
develop that model
and publish
it.
School based training is,
is critical, make
sure I'm on the right
spot.
Um School based training
for teachers, what I've done
this year is, is a lot of money
is being spent on school based
training where the training
is coming to us.
Uh If we're
learning uh
anything in in the
classroom, we, we look
at that standard alignment and
building clarity. So
trainers uh coming
to give a different lens
of how to lead that
that standard
change,
um
observation and feedback, professional
development and
and with those
continuous revisions a
as we're supporting
teachers.
So the goal is
to create that common
PLC planning time
as an expectation for our
district. Um
So that way we continue
um sharing
lessons,
we're also utilizing
the
state initiative of
letters K through
six.
We adopted the
implementation of reading
horizons K through
12, 2
different areas. Discovery
for K through three,
elevate for grades four
through on, it goes all
the way up to adult.
What reading horizons has
done for us is
all the letters and
science for reading
is encompassed for a tool
for teachers. So it made it easier
for teachers to
implement letters.
What happened when they were going through
letters is they had a multiple
resources with letters
and by housing
it into one platform,
uh the feedback we got from
teachers because
they had trainers going
into their classrooms and
modeling lessons, how to
implement the science of
reading. Uh for
almost six weeks
now, uh teachers have
seen more student
engagement because they
feel confident for the first time,
they learn how to teach the
science of reading in all content
areas. Uh They've learned
how to do this in seven steps
and, and really gain
confidence and then the, the
coach will come back and,
and see how you can get
better. So it's job
embedded coaching
where
the the trainers are in
the classrooms and
aligning their training
to the district
initiatives.
So that is a part
of our early literacy plan.
Uh It goes on up to
adult so they have access
to that common.
Uh
So the
next
piece
uh that we're using is the
language usage guidelines
and expectations from our
district. Uh
The New Mexico uh
the pe D mentoring
initiatives, we have teachers
in the new teacher programs
that there's a lot of uh areas
that they're
learning how to build their
lesson plans to align with
student
data.
And I'm used to standing up so it's
hard for me to sit. And so
I, I really uh I
trying to get up and
stand.
So student support
and success. Uh
the biggest thing I'll go
back to parent
engagement and
attendance. Uh We do
have academic nights
as a system uh with
our federal programs director
using the community
school model, uh
attendance fairs,
student led parent
conferences that has been a
big lift where students
have um ownership of
their learning and they present it to
their parents
um
the common communication
using APY where
all of our teachers and
staff can co
communicate uh
using another platform, Mr
Sanchez has, has
initiated where we're
all using the same platform
to communicate to families
and of course, uh
mental health support
in our website um to
support parents and
families, how to support their
students with mental health,
um student
support and success.
Um At the, there's
a lot of home visits going on,
there's a little bit of data there
on uh how
many contracts have been signed.
Uh We have our attendance
coaches, spent a lot of
invested a lot of federal
money on attendance
coaches where they can
go out to families
and how Mr sent to support
the family, not to tell him
why are you not attending. But
how can we help you? How can we
support? So, student visits
or family visits.
Um It
eliminates the barriers that
we're coming to visit to
submit to CYFD.
No, we're coming to
visit and that's what we
do in Belin to find.
How can we support you as a
family. Uh And
again, the big lift
recruit hire surround
yourself with the right people.
Uh We need to champion
our fellow program
we have and I don't have
the exact data, but we
do
14
minutes.
So right now, thank you, Mr
Sanchez, graduates
fellows
and feel free to pop in because
I don't have that. >> We've had,
we've had two teachers
this year that have graduated. The program
are now in the class. So
we're starting to see the pipeline
going >> and that
is exciting. Thank you for that data
point. Um
The teacher programs
are strong. We have a mentor
teacher that goes around
the with new teachers teaching,
then the district
expectations. What do you
do when we come to Belen? Well,
here's welcome to Belen. Here's
our learning platforms. How can I get
you started? And this mentor
teacher spends three years with these
new teachers and then we
leverage um teachers
within the school site to,
to help new teachers
as a new teacher. Um Some
of us have been educators.
There's not a book on how when
you have I survived
kindergarten. For 91 days. And
when I walked in 91 days
because I didn't understand
what it was to be a teacher.
So these mentoring programs are
powerful. Uh
So that way we can retain
our teachers, we can keep
our teachers and say welcome to the
teaching profession. It's a great
time to be in education
and this is what Belen
has to offer and these are
all the supports you need.
Um I would love to come to
Belen if I had that. Um
But I survived 91 days
and I stuck with it.
Um The
monthly professional development
um We
have that going on
in our district as an
expectation and it
targets instructional
strategies, student
engagement, classroom
management. Um
And again, that multi-layered
system of support, I, I didn't
put the acronym because I think that's a
powerful word.
Um And then
initial teacher support
program, professional
development and the
partnerships we have
with site based learning is
workforce solutions and
city of Belen hiring
job fairs and, and other things
we have in Belen.
Um
So part of our instructional
uh educational plan, we
had to complete some district
goals. So here's a highlight of our
goals um
broken down as
to meet the expectations of
our educational plan.
Uh You can see the
goals there, what I've
done um
to our uh board
president and, and
board members
um have to present
every year, this is last
year's uh plan and
this is pre PD
re evaluation of data.
This is what I present every
summer as we get the
scores
and, and this is just a
highlight of it. I'm gonna
just do a little data
point of how we're tracking
the scores and
these goals are a little bit higher
than the educational plan
because, um, as you look
at that, I'm, I'm gonna turn because
I printed mine small,
um, for fiscal year
24 you can see the
arrows, uh, tracking
the vertical.
Um, how did the third graders
do in fiscal
2020?
Uh, three? Well, they moved
up six points.
Um, and then you can see the
orange fourth graders
went down one
point. Um,
and you can see the fifth graders,
uh, uh, highlight of the
sixth graders going up nine
points. Fiscal
year. We've set those goals
based on historical
data and
we have goals all the way
to fiscal year 26
if we have some schools
and we do in this district
moving up 25
or double digit gains,
why can't we have all schools
moving up? So this
is all of our schools
combined. So if one
school can do it
or one school in our state,
if one school can do
it, it's about providing
clarity and produce what you expect.
And setting ambitious goals
are we, we, we didn't meet
where I want where we want to
go, but the
goals are gonna be set and continue
working towards them. So those
are the el A
um And this is an
expectation for all our principals
to track their data uh to
this depth. This is just the, the
district view a
again in math, what
is our vertical change
and our horizontal change?
So if we were
able to increase a, a
class by
20% and reach
50% why
can't we do another fif
20% gain
to go to fiscal year
25 to
70%. Uh
we can do it because
students are are
producing and
they have that capacity.
I did mention they all have that
capacity. If we, we
uh strengthen that
um so ambitious
goals, but we have
stu uh sites
almost reaching those
goals.
If we look at
sat um
we look at at the
the
elements broken down
21 fiscal year
21 and 23 we
don't have the 24
data. Um
The green is higher
than the average score where there was
a little bit of growth and
the yellow is
um a little
below the average
score and,
and these are the gaps. These are the
challenges that were of
concern that were below
30%.
So, in a
breakdown um as
a district, grade level
three
was below 30%.
That is a concern.
Uh Our district grade four
and math below
um di district
grade seven,
29% were
uh we
again, our goals were above
50% and
grade eight
El A and grade eight
math. Those were
areas of concern.
Well, we also have things
that we need to champion and this is
where we need to focus.
So what
happened in individual schools?
Uh schools,
grade three at La
Promesa showed an increase
from 5% to
37% if a
school can do
that
keep that 20%
going. Um which
is a, a gain of
32%.
So if a school can gain
32%
what systems did they put in
place? They have a, a
community model
school, they, they
have uh recruitment and
hire uh different
teachers, new students.
There's a lot of things that, that
anticipated that and they
are they following the structure
is the principal
meeting expectations
of our district and leading the Pl
CS and looking in at that student
work, uh Gil
Sanchez went from a
14% increase
from 51 to 65%
above 50%
proficiency in that grade
level. Uh Lamers
said elementary uh
celebration of 11%
gain. So these are the
celebration of double digit
gains, but you see a
gain of 32%
Dennis Chavez Elementary a
gain of 20%.
Um So these are the double
digit gains that I am
highlighting. So
if we can do this
champion and
evaluate their programs,
what are they doing to engage
the students to do this?
So we need to stay
steadfast and
set those goals um
and, and keep
them going.
Um And
so
to
just highlight the
few areas that are in the
educational plan.
Intentionally the
beginning teacher mentorship
program, it's aligned to
elevate and the
competencies of
uh learning for, for
New Mexico teachers, it's
broken down into four
areas. Um
As we uh build
those areas, it's
planning and prep creating
that environment for learning
and teaching for learning
along with professionalism.
Um those areas
have been broken down
uh into
three stages
as we have a system
in place for observation and
feedback. So principals
know where their
stages where their teachers
are as they go through through
the classrooms, you know,
where are you at in this stage
of setting up a an environment
for learning uh standard
alignment. And as
a teacher progresses
into the
final stage, which would be
deep implementation where
they're facilitating learning.
Um and, and it just
breaks it down for
uh principals
to know what to look for
and tie all of that
into uh observation
feedback. A principal has to
be in the classroom to coach their
teachers up. So they
know just like a
student, they provide
enough clarity and focused
feedback. So they know
where they're at uh
through the stages of, of
instruction.
I'm gonna touch on
the federal and
local revenue
um how we use
the funds for
um to and,
and basically, this is part of
our str uh educational
plan of how we're using
funds um
again, upgrade
and define a new purpose for
safe and supportive schools,
playgrounds, outdoor learning
centers, uh equipment,
uh student engagement
activity, remodeling
schools, technology
upgrades, upgrades for
overall needs of the
buildings and classrooms.
Uh Again, to keep
the safety and health
plans um
continuous to support
academic needs,
bus and parent parking
lots and, and communication
systems to upgrade
our supports and dialogue
with our community, students
and families
and overview of next
steps. I kind of
this is just gonna pull it
all together. So
again, year one,
I've been with uh I
came in this
position with Mr Sanchez.
Year one was really
introducing everything
uh to align our vision
setting expectations,
systems of accountability,
doing a needs analysis,
understanding the root cause of our
performance challenges and
professional development.
Um As we uh
set district wide
expectations that was like
a year one overview,
year two is
strengthening. We're looking
at professional development to
target areas, job
embedded, um
evaluating progress of our
systems and expand
and build that leadership
capacity and teacher
capacity. Year three.
This is where we're at right now,
sustainability and proven
results. Now, we need to
reach out to others
who's doing it right in our
district. Um I've
talked to Gadsden in Farmington
and different areas of
successful schools that I worked
hand in hand with them. Like,
what are you doing? Let's take
a deeper look into our data
within our systems here.
We, we have um
superintendents in the room that,
that we can reach out to
um that we're partnering
up. We need to continue
that high level of
performance. And
then again, it's
all gonna come down to
supporting,
I got behind
supporting student
outcomes um
using our, our budget.
Um I'm learning numbers and
budget. I was talking to a few of you
understanding the numbers, but
again, it comes down
to
show me your budget and I'll tell
you your priorities. So
our, our priorities
are here in our plan
and that's how, what guides
our budget. Um So
prioritizing funds
to provide equity for all
students, uh
using our standardized
learning system and assessment.
Um Belen uses
SALSA um
K through 12
which encompasses an online
system with learning progressions
for core areas.
Quarterly district
guaranteed instruction,
uh teacher access to
interactive common
resource and
teacher and staff feedback
through observation feedback
and community
feedback.
With
that,
I am gonna turn it over
to Mr Tucker. But
before I do,
I just need to just
reiterate. One last
thing is the
overall purpose uh
of what we do together
is to leading,
leading that change.
Uh by deepening our understanding
of all of our instructional
practices to
provide clarity for all
learners and how
to communicate those ideas to
teachers as
well as observing them
and providing them
feedback with
that. Our board president,
Mr Tucker is gonna
do our
finale,
>> Mr Chairman members
of the committee
madam director.
Welcome. Once again,
I I'm so proud to
host you as a
member of the school board
this year. Uh as
opposed to last year,
we're always happy to
see you here uh within
the schools. And I, I know that
a lot of you travel
from different places and
different directions. I I
need to let you
know in my
capacity
that I'm in right now
and the capacity of an
administrator, an
educator, it is truly
appreciative to have all
of you to come to the
site. So please
don't deviate for that. Please
continue that we really, really
love it. Um
I, I want to touch upon
the things
on a board perspective.
The first thing I want to tell you some
good news, House
Bill 212
actually works.
It does work and it
works in
Berlin.
We're very, very fortunate.
The composition of our
school board are
those that are retirees
with the exception of
myself.
Yes.
And the Silver.
Uh and, and the reason it
works is because
we, we understand what the
purpose of that bill
was and that's
to, to deal with
policy,
to deal with budget
property litigation. But
the most important
part, the
one employee,
we have one employee which is the
superintendent and we must
go to that superintendent.
I'm not letting you know
this because of what I
think
my first job
as an administrator was in
1999. So
I was within the
old school prior
to house Bill
212.
There were some
benefits of that
much local control, but
there was also a lot
of deficits
and things that were not good for
kids during that time.
Um With that much
control, there was a lot
when you have five or seven
people on a board trying to
figure out who's gonna be an
assistant principal who's gonna
have that, that
job at different schools.
It gets convoluted
and it, it gets
really weird
sometimes
with House Bill 212,
it, it singles that out
in which administrators get
to perform their
duties and their
jobs
right now, we
have Mr Sanchez
who has to cater to all
of us every,
almost every day, but
it works. It
actually works. The
presentation that you just
had would not be
possible if there was
five members of the
school board that was
nitpicking and
doing everything else
about a
referral at the
middle school
that needs to be handled by the Cy
Princes. All of
this would not be possible if
they're going to be deviating
from things they shouldn't be.
So I want to let you know
that Bill works
and I believe there's as
much the the
um, the school
board association works
diligently to teach
school boards
members and brand new members
to come in and make sure
to help House Bill
212 works. And just
recently
you, you passed a bill in
which we could save our
superintendents from a new
board coming in and firing them.
Which was excellent. That
is good because when you come
into this job, even
as a seasoned
administrator,
it's a brand
new day.
The things that I believe
that I thought I
knew as a board
member, I didn't
know I
did not know those things. And
it's been very, very refreshing,
especially with the
professional development that we've been
working with. So
now that you know, that House
Bill 212 works,
I want to go into the
challenges of a board
member and it's
gonna be the same thing. It's
budget,
budget is
our biggest
challenge. And the
reason it's a challenge is
that I, I truly
believe that
what you do in the legislature
is to help us now,
just throwing money at a problem
does not work. I realize
that the, the boards
know that it has
to be
pragmatic,
it has to be diligent
in what the purpose
is. But there
are some nuances
that, that
keep us from fulfilling what
we need to fulfill.
And we also live in
the age of collective
bargaining. Now,
I believe in collective bargaining.
And at one time in my
career, I was the lead
negotiation,
negotiator for
the Belin District with
NE A before I became an
administrator
as a board member.
When I see a budget,
I I now
realize the
blend district is not
a for-profit
institution.
We are
dependent upon
what you send to us or
what we are able to get through
grants or what
the federal government gives
us. And then that is
set, there's
no deviation from that.
So when we get
the directive of a
345
8%
raise
to negotiate anything
above that is a
challenge. It truly
is for those districts
such as ourselves, we don't
have extra gas and
oil. We don't
have
um
a student population
that may generate other
funds. We're
in a position in which whatever
we get, that's what we get.
So it's difficult for
places like ourselves
to give that
extra that we want
to. We would love
if you said give the
teachers a 3% raise,
we'd love to give them 5%
if we had the money,
but that's just not the
case.
And when we talk about
that,
the most of
our budget
probably, I, I don't
want to throw out too many numbers.
80%. It goes
to salaries. So
we've got 20%
of that budget in
order for
HVAC systems,
busy buses
have a different one.
But we understand
there are other things that we have to pay for
out of that. But our
infrastructure right now
within all schools
is deteriorating.
I was pleased to see
a, a trillion dollar budget from
the federal government for
infrastructure within the
entire country.
And that, that's a wonderful thing.
But what was left out the same
time we were building that bridge in
1960
they were building Blynn High
School.
That's the infrastructure we
also need,
we need to remember the
infrastructure of our educational
system is just as
important as the bridges
that we have that we go
across every day. But this
bridge with our
Children,
that one's not gonna deteriorate, that
one has to grow
continuously.
So I'm I'm asking
that you put that into
some sort
of
analysis that you
have and to pass
it on to those even
in Washington DC,
we need to
preserve that infrastructure
within our systems as
well.
I would hope
that when we go
through the the budget process,
I'm, I'm not gonna get into
that in more
because everyone knows
that we, we all struggle with that
every district does
and, and we do our
best
um
to get what we need to get
for the students.
But what I want to go into
also about House Bill
212 is
that when
we are as a
board looking
at policy budget
and and
property litigation, we
also must look
at the challenges of student
achievement.
Lately, the
blend board
has been
making sure a third
of our time
is to focus
on student achievement
and the challenges that we have.
And you heard
what our administrator
superintendent Sanchez and
Super assistant superintendent E
Renee Sanchez are doing
now, what we don't want to
do. And this is why I say
House Bill 212
works. We do not want
to be a board to be
a pseudo
administrator to
dictate what we think should
happen with
curriculum
facilitating and
dictating are two separate
items and we want
to continue to facilitate
and that's what House Bill
212 does.
And I want you to know that
the system does
work and we're
gonna make it work
now to help us make it work.
I, I hate to say it.
We're gonna need more
funding and we're
gonna need more funding for
specific
reasons.
Going back to
infrastructure. Yes, the
schools we,
we, we need to get rid
of our schools that
were in,
built in the last century
within the sixties,
seventies and sometimes
fifties. But
underneath those schools
is infrastructure as
well.
We have to have the money for
those items
and make sure that when
we do build, we
don't have to
go to the,
the least amount
or the, the person that
gave the lowest bit. We want
to get the best for our
Children.
Now, with that, I want
to say thank you, Mr
chairperson. Thank you
members of the committee
madam director. It is
an honor and privilege to
have you here in the
Blin District. You're
always welcome to any
district I'm in, in whatever
capacity that I'm in.
So I want to thank you all
for that. And before I, I
say goodbye, I'd like
to also recognize
we have two other members of
our school board here, our vice
president, Mr uh
Ralph Fernandez,
and we also have our
secretary, Mr Larry
Gart. I want to thank them both
for being here.
We have one of the most
talented
administrative staffs,
teachers and
staff in the State
of New Mexico. And I'm
very, very proud
to be at the helm as
their board president.
Thank you. Thank
you.
>> All right. >> Thank >> you >> so much for the
presentation. >> Represent
Garrett
Mr Chair. Thank you for that
comprehensive presentation
and one of your teachers, of course is
sitting right next to me. So
it's a privilege to work with her on this
committee. A couple of
questions you mentioned
you're doing the summer literacy
institutes. Is
that at all your elementary
and middle schools and
who will be doing those
four hour programs?
Are you recruiting
non employees? Are
you getting feed? Are you
getting involvement from your
employees to participate?
>> So, um I
have
communicated this out to
our
employees.
>> Ok,
>> Mr Chair
madam.
Uh Thank
you for that. She,
it's obviously my first
time.
So um
yes, I
sent out applications within
our district to recruit
um district
teachers, eas
one capacity we received
15 applicants,
they went through the state.
Uh Whoever is taking care of
that application process. I
had to then approve all the
teachers. Uh they went
through um,
reference checks and I had
to approve all the teachers and
I'm receiving lists of students.
It's a 1 to 4
ratio. The
teachers will be trained the first
week of June
and the program will run for
three weeks here in Berlin at
three sites Central
Elementary la Promesa Elementary
and Belin High School.
And the teachers will
have a 1 to 4 ratio
and I believe we have about
30 students registered.
The communication is still going
out district wide. We've
made posters and
really championing the new
Mexico literacy. Uh the
feedback from parents are.
Thank you. Um
So yes. Does that
answer your question? They're instructors
eas within our district
so far, >> Mr
Chair Representative Garrett, let me add
on to that. The reason we've,
we've uh limited it,
limited it to
three school
sites. We're also
running summer school at Belin
High School, which we're providing
transportation for. We
have extended school year which we
provide transportation for and
we try, we have an
mou with the city of Berlin
to also provide transportation
for their outings.
We and
it's hard to come up with all that. So
we're trying to be strategic
with our routes
>> and and the goal is to centralize
it. So all the teachers are trained
in central areas as
well.
>> Thank you for that
practical implementation
description. Uh Mr
Chair. My second question is
a 90 day plans. I was
very involved um
until I recently retired in 90 day
plans. So
that feedback
cycle, how is that
going at the school
level? You,
you mentioned like weekly,
monthly. I didn't quite catch
everything. How
robust,
how, how do you make sure
that actually happens?
>> So I'm able to
monitor uh Mr
Chair, Representative
Garrett. Sorry.
Thank you. Um
So I monitor
the programs um
through New Mexico dash
and it's in a district
expectation that
the core leadership
teams at each site
go through the re review
process as expected through
New Mexico dash, the
30 60 90 day
reviews. So that is
robust and I can, I can
see the results of
those plans. I, I'm
a certified reviewer so I
can see the
results of
each plan and
it's an district guarantee
that they do the 30 60
90 if not, they will not
get approved to the next
level. And on
top of that uh review,
they have their weekly
uh PL CS to
see how it's getting
implemented throughout
the weekly review
and, and adjustments are made
a as we look at
everything, adjustments are
made. >> Uh
Thank you. Um And
Mr Chair PL
CS schools,
many, many schools are
struggling to incorporate
the PL CS within the duty
day. How do
you, how do you do your PL
CS in
Berlin? Because
as a former coach,
that was the most vital thing
we did and now I hear from
my own school
that they're almost unable
to do them anymore.
>> Mr Chairman Representative
Dere, may I ask a question,
clarifying question? Are you
talking at the elementary level or the
secondary level or
both?
>> Ok, Mr Chair representative
there. Um So
what we're doing
again, it's
providing a
district expectation
of the structure of PL
CS uh
scheduling within
the, the day where
um grade level
teams have
common um
preparation times
and it,
it, it is
difficult
when you put in the priority
of LCS first.
And then because that's a
priority, collaborative
structure is a priority within
that PLC. There is an
expected structure to,
to monitor
by all principles. So
the structure is put in
first and then
the schedules are made after
that. And, and >> Mr
Chair representative, I may
add to that the elementary
level, we work hard
to schedule their
pullouts back to
back on a consistent basis.
So they have the extended period of
time. We also
within our, our, our
uh uh
master schedule. What the,
the, the duty
day there's also
prep time built into theirs
so that try and
build flexibility.
There's time before school, there's time
after school. There's time within the
duty day
as a former elementary
principal, Miss Sanche is very good
at helping the
principals with that master
schedule. I was a secondary,
we can do, I can help them
at that level but
try and be flexible if
that answers your question.
>> Thank you very much. And my
last question, Mr Chair
is on your educational.
We talked about the education
fellows uh residency
program.
Um How
do you recruit,
identify select
education
fellows? You said
you had >> 14, Mr chair,
Representative Garrett because
I have
uh we have
an hr director
that is
full of energy and loves
to bring people to Berlin.
Um She's from
Berlin and
she has taken that and run with
it through various ways. We,
we recruited within first.
So the first thing we did
is went to our existing
eas and
tried to encourage them
to go, uh,
be part of
the fellow so they could become
teachers with the
spots that were left after
that. Then we started talking
to our, and we've
been doing this a year now,
last year's graduating
class or previous
graduates that we're
interested in staying with Belin
and then with a few
slots, I, I'm gonna say maybe
two when,
when uh Miss
Sho goes out to, to hiring
fairs and knowing that
we have slots, she recommends
that especially at the colleges
for those that at
UN M BC, that may not
be
there.
>> Just one follow up question to that
Mr Chair. Do you still
incorporate the grow your own
program that gives
scholarships for a
and classified
personnel that are interested
>> Mr Chair representative
there in my mind?
And it sort of goes back to talk
about this is
uh
program an initiative
just as
part of what we're looking at
changing. I would like to
see AC
Tso and I never remember
what it stands for.
It's in CTE
which is the rising
program and
they would go from Ed, rising into
the ed fellows, go from Ed
fellows into the
grow your own scholarship
and let's just keep them here
and that way they never have to legal
in. And then when the
Solters get ready
to go, we have
replacements.
>> Thank
you.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank
you, committee Um
I like, that's why I like serving on
this committee because the folks
here, my colleagues and my friends
are many of them
educators, current
and farmers, we understand
and when it comes to this
community, there's no, there's no
us and them, it's we because
all of us have schools,
all of us have charters and
communities that they serve.
So Mr Chairman, my
my questions and anyone can jump
on that are going to be kind of short
to the point. So
please don't feel you need to elaborate
too much but make sure that you
get the questions answered. So my
first question is Mr
chairman and
committee
is the Blinn school
district. Are they currently
facing budget challenges
that have been, are greater now
than they have been in recent
years?
Um
That's an interesting question, >> Mr
Chair Representative Buckley.
Yes, we are.
Um
this, this has been an interesting
year with, with budgets,
with the timing.
Um
We're, we're creating budgets
where we don't have all the
information and
so our best guess
right now and we had to submit our
budget, April
24th 26.
It was early
our best guess right now because
we, we know that things are
fluid is that we're
gonna have to
take
use about
3.5 million out
of our, our cash balance
to balance next year's budget.
We don't want to rift teachers
and I know that that
may be happening. I think we did a
good job
of not
going off the fiscal cliff
with our, with our federal
funds. So that's
not the reason because we went
crazy and hired a bunch of teachers.
We didn't do that, but just
to, to, to stay
whole. Yes, we are
facing that.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. And
my, my follow up question to that
is, so you've already kind of talked about
it. What are some of the remedies that
have been considered by
yourself superintendent and
the school board in order to address
these budget shortfalls
in excess of about $3.5
million.
>> Our hope this Mr Chair
Representative BCA, our
hope this year
is,
this is my belief. I'm
gonna say this person's
belief is that
uh the unit value
in the SCG is
underfunded for various
reasons and
that
when
the final
value was set in
January, that we're gonna see a huge
increase now, it's too, it's too
late in my opinion
for us to spend it effectively
for this year.
So we're
willing to put in the
investment for at least one year.
It, this is our plan is not
sustainable. We're willing
to put the investment in for one year
because we believe that
that money is there. It's
just some things need to be tweaked
to get that unit value
up to where it should
be. >> And
thank you Mr Chairman.
And uh you know, one of the
questions and we're sitting about
because I was uh at
the district office in
2008, 2009
when we had these
challenges. But the difference
is that at that time, we had
a state in a national
economic downturn.
So right now, I do believe
that it is the responsibility of
the legislature and pe
D as well to make
sure that our, our school districts
are adequately funded
to support our students in our
community. So uh Mr Chairman,
I'm gonna put stan rounds on the on
the spot. Now, Mr
Chairman, is this, is
it, is this just a local issue for
Belin or other districts across the
state facing the
similar
challenge?
>> But if, if you
would use maybe that
microphone there so we can pick it
up for folks at
home.
>> Does that work? Ok.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr Chairman
Representative Baca,
as I've been around the state
during this budget season,
I see this as a standard
sort of problem across
the majority of, of
districts. It's not every
district districts are different,
there's 89 different
motifs that are happening.
I see a lot of districts that are struggling
with the question you raised.
Uh Supert Sanche about
do we Riff or do we not
Riff? How do we get
home on this budget?
Part of it? I think
uh Representative Boa that in your
question is the
unit value distribution
in this first
tranche appears
to be
low. I I
would, I would score it at about
60% of the
available resource and the
growth of that unit
value of,
of what was there and about 40%
held back. And I think that's
part of what's creating some of the
problems.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman and, and, and
here's Mr Chairman and colleagues
in the committee and the
panel. One of my,
one of my fears is
that we have
many of our districts and charter schools
as well. I see my, one of my districts
here, my charter is here as well.
They're gonna be taking actions
in order to make budget
which may include
everything I've heard of
laying off staff
reduction in force. Some
districts are considering closing
schools, some
districts are talking about cutting programs.
I've heard of some districts that are
talking about how it may impact
activities, ban
any of these other types of
athletics.
And I think Mr Chairman and
I think committee, I think that's one
of the things about it is
it's gonna be too late in January
because as it is, we
have a difficulty staffing
our schools with teachers
and staff. There's not enough people that
are working in our workforce.
And the one thing about it, Mr
Chairman and panel is
that the
question is how
if not you know, we can't wait
till January because this is already going to be
taking place. And again,
you know, in January, the legislature
comes in, you know, on the white horse and
we're going to raise a unit value.
There has to be some kind of remedy
ahead of time before people lose
their jobs. As I said
before, in 2008, 2009,
when there were cash weeps and
people laid off, we had a
national issue.
We don't. Now we're sitting on about
3.5 billion
up to $5 billion
in surplus.
So I, I do believe
and I, I ask, you know how we
can rectify this
before we create a problem
that isn't necessarily
there. So that's my,
my um
you know, my soapbox, Mr
Chairman, my last question is going to
be, you
talked about funding and many,
some of my colleagues on this are gonna be
working on the
SCG
what types of things
do you need or need funding
for? You mentioned, you know,
programs. Uh
What are some of the things that the
Belen school district needs
that may not be a, you
know, at this time addressed
in the SCG?
>> That's a great
question.
Yeah, I
know Mr Chairman and,
and Representative
Baca
take a good rest.
It's gonna, it's, to
me it's professional development,
it's having the, the,
the
funds necessary to do
the professional development that's,
that's uh
needed.
I know it's, we're
told that it's there.
I just don't always see it
and maybe, maybe
I, we need to improve
on, on seeing where it's
at. I know that
with, with
the
K 12 plus funding, that's
what we use our K 12
plus funding for is professional
development. But you
mentioned, you know, making
cuts, one of the things we've
had to cut is our professional
development budget
because even
I think K 12 plus will generate
about 2.1 million for
us and that's still not
enough.
>> And thank you, Mr Chairman.
And you know, one of the other questions that I think
from my colleagues, I've also heard stuff
like security
or as far as school
safety plans as far as cameras
personnel and otherwise.
So
um
I do appreciate it. I do have questions
but in, in respect to
my colleagues, I will go ahead and
uh conclude my questions for today.
Thank you, Mr Chairman,
Senator
>> Stewart.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
This is supposed to be green,
I forget now. So
it's on with red,
red is good.
We hate these microphones,
by the
way.
Uh I just,
first of all have to say
how incredibly
thrilling and
exciting all of your
attitudes are about
your district and your
teachers and your
students.
We don't see this
everywhere, we don't
see this everywhere.
So um
but uh M
Sanchez's, you
know, with her academic
achievement and Mr
Sanchez with his attitude,
Mr Tucker, I mean,
if I was working again. I would
come down here and
apply.
So I, I just
have, I have a couple of
questions but I
looked up your reading
Horizons K 12.
What an amazing
curriculum. That
is great.
That's why you're seeing that
gains in el
A,
you know, I, I have
a, I have a stepson who has
an eight year old daughter. Uh,
my colleagues are gonna
get sick of me telling this
story. Uh So
she's, she's eight,
supposed to go into third
grade, but she
had no schooling because
all the schools
were closed, same as
here. Uh She's
in Oregon.
So she's a smart kid.
She shows up in third grade and
they say, oh my God,
she, she can't read
and my stepson,
oh dear, six
week bootcamp
16 week
Orton Gillingham boot
camp. She's not
reading at grade level.
That's the power
of structured
literacy. Uh
So, uh and she
didn't, you know, she's not
dyslexic. She just didn't have
schooling, she didn't have any
instruction. Uh
smart kids. So
six weeks is all it took
for her. It's one of, one
of the reasons we have
a lot of hope with this
3456
week boot camp that we're doing all
over the state. Uh
So,
ok, so
I was the sponsor
of House Built 212.
This is the first time
people have talked about
212 in probably
10 years.
And you mem, you probably
remember, you may remember
but because it was a
change to board
policy, you know,
school boards used to be
doing the hiring,
getting their brother to
be the football coach,
getting their wives
to run the
libraries or
whatever. Uh, it
didn't, it used to
be a problematic
and so, but boy,
school boards fought House Bill
2 12 4
for just fed
it forever. So, for you
saying it works, that
makes me feel
good.
So that bill was supposed
to be 500 pages
where you changed
the entire
statutes.
Well, we did, we, I just
didn't want to do that. So it's about
100 pages. So we changed
most of them. But every
now and then in statute,
you see that
and that, that was the
problem that it would just took
two much to change here. So
every new education
bill that we hadn't changed
the statute, you see those
changes in, in there
now. But, but thank
you for understanding
that and accepting that
and talking about it
because it was
huge. It
was 2003.
It was 21 years
ago.
It was with the brand new
governor Richardson
because that bill had
been vetoed by
the previous governor
twice. Uh I
keep drawing on bills even
when they get vetoed.
So proud of
that. So glad you mentioned
it. Um,
so Senator Souls
and I for years have wanted
to put in what we call
discretionary funding
into the SCG
just give them
more money
so that we don't hear
this after every session.
Well, we don't have enough. Well, we
don't have enough. Well, we don't have
enough. Uh, in
spite of the,
the huge amount that we
put in education over the last
several years, the good
news is that this,
uh, huge, uh,
oil and gas
generated new
revenue is going to
continue for a while.
So I believe we need to
continue to
fund education at a
much higher level.
It's tooth and nail
fighting with the
appropriations.
People. Really,
we should set the
education budget
and we're starting to do that
again with our
leadership here.
Uh So we, we had a
great education
budget going
into the January session
and then the appropriators
took one look at it
just
nice to several pieces
of it, but we did
manage to get 30
million in there for
discretionary spending in
the SCG. I'm
afraid that the appropriators
through the language properly
put and you can use
it for this and this and this and this.
We did not want that at
all. So did you
find any
discretionary
spending that came
through in your
budget and
it, so what you spend it
on, >> Mister
Chairman Senator Stewart?
No, I didn't
but
I, I don't, I don't want
to say it wasn't there because
I don't, I
wasn't told it was there. I didn't
see it but I can look into
it and see
because that I do remember that
from this, this year's session
that you guys have done that.
>> Yeah, Senator Souls wanted
500. I
knew that they wouldn't give him
that
million. Right. Uh,
I said, how about 100
million? Uh, we wound
up with 30 but I'm
pretty sure they hacked
money off of other
line items and other
areas of the budget
to tell us. Here's
your little discretionary pot.
So we're
still, all
of us here
focused on
funding education
better. You
know, there's about 6
to 700
million in cash
balances around
the state. Our
appropriators don't like
that either. We
understand it's the,
it's the federal money,
it's the, and you're about
to hit a cliff if you haven't
hit it already. That's part
of the lack of
funding for the staff.
So we're really
hoping to deal with
that as
we go back in January.
So,
um,
anyway, just
really glad to be here and hear,
hear from all of you. Thank
you, Mr Chairman.
>> Thank you, Representative Meat of
Oil.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair.
Um Thank you Panel.
Um I am so very
proud to be a
part of this
district. Um
I often in, in my
travels um
around, I definitely,
especially once they hear I'm a science
teacher. They're like, hey, we need a
science teacher
and, and I, and
I tell every single one of them,
my, I bleed
Maroon
and uh because I,
I uh I was born
and raised here, this is my home.
I know these, these uh these
students, I know their parents,
I'm related to half of them.
Um But, and,
and, but there's a lot of us
like Miss Sanches, several
generations came through here.
So, and I think that is
what the,
the simplicity
of Belen. Um
Right now, I have a uh
exchange student from Vietnam.
And he is
very astonished
at how I love
my small town. Like, how can
you love to stay here?
And, and I said, because I
like knowing at least
every third car that I'm driving
by. And uh
but that's a lot, a lot
of our workforce
are people I went to
school with uh a lot
of our teachers, a lot of our
principals, I gra uh
two of your principals I graduated
with right now. Um
So we are, there's a lot
of educators that came out. In fact,
our education secretary graduated
from uh Belen Belen
High School. Uh
So, uh and he
gave a speech last night. So it was nice
to see him then too. Um
But uh it's
so, and I think that's a,
that's a huge
culture
that, that comes from
Belen schools is
that uh not that you're
ever stuck here because I don't
ever feel like I'm stuck. Uh
But you don't
want to leave. This is, this is
home. Uh So I I
love that and thank you for
showcasing what we are
doing here and um
and uh and the the new
initiatives I am so excited
to hear about the worst work
based learning um
especially
um that, that I've,
I've seen it showcased in
other ones and I'm glad that we're,
we're getting started and please
let me know how I can help you with
that because uh being
up at the high school, we need to get
these kiddos
um started
off early,
you know, um getting
into certain types of jobs
and in, in order for them to,
to go straight into that
workforce. Um and we
have so much industry
in this county,
um you know, new
industry down here with our,
with our uh um
wind turbine factories,
we have uh we're getting a
hospital finally. Uh
So, uh
so those, those kind
of things and then of course, um on
Facebook and, and, and a lot
of our uh TL CS
around here too
and along with Cisnero
Brothers. Um so there's
so many different
types of uh areas that
we can that we can put
these kiddos to work and train them
and do well. Um
not to mention we have a UN
MVC that is uh
has a lot of the, that
maybe we don't and they have
the teachers that
we can't find. And
um so uh so
working with them is going to be
huge. Um
I have a and and kind
of on that lines. Um
Can you tell us
there's, there was this thing that we just
had a few weeks ago
that was pretty awesome. Can
you tell our panel
or our, our um senators
and representatives here um
about Eagle
Expo?
>> So, Mr Chair
Representative Media
Ban
before COVID, we,
we started
having um
student professional
learning along
with um
was it called Ego Expo there? I
don't remember what we called it
and then COVID
happened and it went
away and this
year the team, uh
at BHS decided to
reinstate it and
it was
bringing out the,
the different
employers in the, in the
district to
showcase what they had to
offer in our gym. We
had uh
vendor fair is what it
reminds me of. And they,
the,
the different organizations
were there where kids could go around and
find out more about the,
if they were interested and work with
them. We also
did um
mock interviews with
grades 10 through 12.
We didn't, at least my group
didn't do the ninth graders
and we had
um
um
what do we do in the, in the
cuz I was doing the mock interviews,
what we do in the uh
auditorium
colleges. That's what.
And we had colleges come out and talk
to him a very, a
very good event, very
exciting event.
We need to take that
momentum built
from the event.
And I've, I've actually
talk to, to
certain people at the high school. How
do we take that momentum and turn
it into
something that actually
happens. How
do we say? Ok, now you're
excited about this. How is
this going to affect your
plans? What are you going
to do? And really,
I wanted to, I would
hope it would be the carrot
to if you're behind on
credits, go to summer school so you can
get caught up on your credits
if you're on track, to stay on
track to if you
and start looking at dual credit
opportunities.
And that, and
it's not
make it a, a one and done
continuing, continuing
to have it every year, but have
smaller versions of it throughout
the year for that are
more that are intentionally
focused on different groups of
kids. Does that answer
your question?
>> Yes. Thank you, Mr
Chair and uh, Mr
Sanchez. Yes, it was, it
was an exciting time and, and the
feedback that I got from the students
was excellent. Um, they,
um, they got
to sit here and not
only talk with colleges
or, uh, hear certain
things about, um,
professions they were,
uh,
interested in, but they
also got to talk to a
lot of the businesses
and, and when they
had conversations with them,
this is what you need to work for
me. This is how we
can do. And then there was other colleges,
uh, Balen Schools was theirs, there was
a which I think
um, the Belen Schools
was very, who's it? It
was Yvonne. Um that
was there. She was like, there was
quite a few people that are saying they
want to be teachers. So,
so which is good. Um
That uh we, at
least they didn't have my physics
class. I didn't scare them off at all.
But um
um
and so my next question kind
of goes along with the, with
the, with physics.
Um We
have uh we see a lot of
data tracking uh which is
normal around everywhere with the,
with the um
El A and, and
math. Uh is there any
desire to start
incorporating because I am a
science teacher. So I'm and
I have been so wanting
that data and those
abilities to, to
track the my
students um
similar to that. Is there
any um hope
that we can do that along with
science in the
future?
>> Mr Chair Representative
Moa. Uh Yes,
I had talked earlier about
um district assessment
strategy. We have started
with the course in
providing a District
Guarantee Sciences
is the next lift.
So good news is
to adopt science and
with a, an adoption
there's um
assessment and data
to follow that same
protocol that we do for El
A and Math. Uh We're doing
it now for social studies we
adopted uh last
year. So we have that common
district strategy to
hit all core
areas.
>> Thank you, Mr Chair. Thank you, Mrs
Sanchez. I'm so excited to hear that
because I'm, I'm one
of Miss Sanchez's actually
when she was a principal.
Um I was her first hire
as her pe teacher. Um
and, and I think she had just signed
her contract and then, and
I was working here in this office
and I, and I had just put in
the, the, the
application. She was like, oh yeah, you
want a job? Can you do? Field day
is what she told me?
So I organized Field Day for
several years.
Um But so
I'm, I love, I love data.
So and and being
in, in science, I
need to be able to know
exactly what my
students are hitting and what they're
not. Um And
having that data to back it up and
having goals in that process I
think is going to do
wonders for,
for uh because it's doing
wonders for those that you have
the data. So I think the other
areas that haven't had it, it's gonna be,
it's gonna be huge. So thank
you. Thank you for that Mr
>> chair representative.
I would recommend
that you
put yourself on the, the
adoption committee so that we
can hear your voice because I know you have a lot
of free
time
>> to be honest with you. That
was the only reason why I didn't. I
was like, yeah, although I'm, I'm
no longer, I no longer have
the class sponsors.
So there's, there's a slot for
a second but I'm sure
it'll, but they're
trying to get me to do staters. So
>> we for science
adoptions. >> Thank
you. All
right. Thank you,
Senator Stewart.
>> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I forgot
to mention to you all
you talked about infrastructure
for the next several
years. We
have made it
easier for
districts to get more
funding for
school building
system upgrade,
et cetera. So you
should reach out to the public school
facility authority, get
yourself the right
forms et cetera
and apply for that because
we've, we've increased that
by 30% for
every district. You probably
know that we're one year
into it. Two more
years, chop, chop uh
get, get in there.
We are trying to
look at
having there
be a larger
state match
after the
pilot, but we
haven't figured that out yet.
Uh So now is the
time to get in for infrastructure.
Thank you, Mr
Chairman.
>> All right. Thank you for that. I don't
have anybody else on my list.
Um I did have a couple of
questions though. Um You
all mentioned the issue
of, you know, really
how to engage parents
and families in their students
education. Um
How do you all work on that,
on engaging
families and parents
at the elementary level and
then at the secondary
level
>> on top, excuse
me, I can talk about elementary Mr
chair
um
in the elementary area.
One thing that we do with
parents is we
have um site
orientations rather
than open house
and orientation will
have the principal
talk about the expectations
of, of the site
and then parents can visit
the classrooms and talk about the
expectations of, of
the classrooms
and really communicating
the expectations of how
can you support
um each
classroom throughout the
year.
And, and it should be a, a
continuous process,
not just during parent
conferences, but
making it clear
that we need you. We can't
do it alone and
setting up those structures and
expectations at the elementary
level. Uh using
a common
communication,
>> Mr Chair, I think we
have
highlights throughout the
district, but we're
not completely there
yet. As a district in, in her
speech or her
presentation is not just talked
about uh LaRosa
Elementary, which is a
community school. They have
great parent participation
and it, and,
but it's that mindset, that community
school mindset that we've talked
about
our, our um
attendance uh for
success group. They put
on an event at the beginning of this
year. There was a fair
and we had great success
there. To
me, what the
lessons that we've learned from
this, especially at
the secondary level is we have
to be our, our, our, we
have to be more inviting.
So many times we talk to parents
and it's not
inviting and we need
to, we need to be more
inviting and help
them to understand that we are a partner.
And so we review
II I met with the
attendance for success team yesterday
to talk about when we're doing home
visits. How do we present
ourselves? So again,
we are there to provide
support and this all goes
back to the work
of, of Doctor Ruby Paint
and
everybody knows they're in
trouble. It's how
you sup they don't need to be told
that. How are you gonna support me?
And so we try and, and do
that with everybody. We're not as
we haven't had as much success
with it at the secondary
level as we've had at
the elementary level. And
I think
middle school and high school parents tend
to not, not
be as well. We
have to fix
it.
>> I if I may and for
the board perspective
and I go back to house Bill
212, we
use, utilize
the,
the instruments that we already
have, which means
that within the Belen
District, we still have an open
forum. So if
someone calls a board member,
we tell them, OK, hold
on, go
through the proper channels.
And if you want to
address the entire board,
we have this available for
you and it doesn't have to
be uh something that's
negative. It can also be something
positive. So we
also using
the tools that are already
there that a lot of people do
not utilize. So
we remind our public,
you want to speak with the board. There
is a mechanism for you
to use it and a medium for you to
use to, to
communicate with the board
itself.
>> One last thing on that Mr Chair.
So we've started
a new initiative
uh to provide um
M Sanchez touched on it briefly
to provide support
with pa to parents
on how to
work with, with their, when
their students might be having mental
health issues.
And so next year to
kick off the school year, we're gonna
take that attendance
fair and we're gonna take this
and we're gonna try and combine it
and just have going back to
what representative Nina Bal
Moyo talked about with the Eagle Expo
is have that type of,
of event
to where we're,
we're,
we're not
a one stop shop, we're a multis
stop shop where they a lot can be
accomplished. And I'm hoping that we
have good success in building
those partnerships with
that
>> and, and I guess related
to that as well
as
you all, you
all talked about um,
student needs.
How do you all
know what the student
needs are
um of your
students in your school
district
>> through multiple ways? I mean,
the number one way is, is
Mr Chair, the number one way
is to talk
to the student
but by, by using
Panorama. And
so
has Miss Sanchez said
Panorama gives us
uh data on
the students, academics
behavior,
um attendance
and sc
as a teacher, I
can, I can use
the data from Panorama and
go through and see what, what
students might not be doing.
Well, what students
are not coming to
school,
it filters
the, the list
down so that I can work with
those that are
possibly in, in
greater need of, of, of my
support.
It's also, it's also
following the MLS S
system
and
having systems in place
so that a kid can't fall
through. And
I, and I'm not gonna say we're
great at that either, but we're getting
better and it's
using the,
the technology.
We, we also
the thing with Panorama that we
all we're also able to do is
provide uh, prescriptive
um lessons
for that student to try and work
on. The one thing I appreciate
that both Berlin High School and Berlin middle
school do is their
student development courses.
And so
representative
Mina Baya, you have 25
kids, give or
take. She has 25
kids in her class every day.
And what she's doing is checking
in with them
and not
expected to fix
the problem. But
if somebody needs to, if
it needs to be elevated, if
uh she can do that
and it's having that
uh
that relationship
building with the student
and that uh
impact with the
student. Now,
we can take other programs
such as Panorama. We're
also, we also use
uh Zello for college and career
planning and we're bringing
in another program called Find
Your Grind to help
students find themselves
and through the, the, through the
use of surveys throughout this, it
helps things come up
and we can see where they're
at. I don't know,
we, it's not a one
size fits all. I guess that's what I'm trying
to say on
that.
>> No, no. And I appreciate that
answer because you're exactly right. It
isn't. Um,
um, I guess my
follow up to that would be
what are you seeing
and what
resources might you be
lacking in the area
that's
making it more difficult to address
some of those needs
as >> far
as
the biggest behavior that we
see at the secondary level
is gonna go back to the vaping
of THC pre
predominantly, more than,
than nicotine right
now.
Um
We're getting better with our resources.
So we, we,
again, we had this pre-covid,
it went away
and now it's come back, but we
have a relationship with the 13th
judicial report to
where we can refer
students to,
to the court to keep them
out of the pipeline. It's
not to get them
on the pipeline to
getting a record. It's so
that we can work with,
with uh his name is DJ
Renteria over there
that they
can give, give them the
support that's needed to
keep them from
getting a JP O or,
or, or whatnot.
We also have a local partner,
um R AC
which provides different types
of training. To me. The
biggest thing
is having
student development, somebody's
watching, hey, I'm starting
to see these red flags.
Then you heard me talk about
it, behavior comes up such as
that and we don't say,
hey, stop doing that.
We, we're gonna, we're
gonna give the parent and the
student the option to
partake in one
of these
programs. They,
we can't make them,
but if we can give them the
option, our hope is we can de
deter a lot of this
behavior.
>> Oh, I appreciate your answers.
Thank you so much. Thank you for playing
host to us. Thank
>> you.
>> All right.
So we'll move on
to land
office State Investment
Council presentation.
Um
I guess for the committee.
And like Senator
Stewart had mentioned, we're
trying to expand
more into the
budgetary manners of
education. But also
this presentation is designed
really to, to
talk about where the
education budget and
the whole state's
budget um
work with one
another. So
certainly appreciate
that.
All right, good morning
folks.
Thank you for joining us,
please.
>> Good morning Mr
Chairman. You all
should have four items
in your packet that are being passed
out right now.
The first is the State
Land Office powerpoint
presentation.
The second
is
versus this one,
this
one.
And then you'll have an
overview of a bunch of
numbers.
You have a map of New Mexico
color coded
and then you'll have the State Investment
Council powerpoint
presentation.
So four separate
items.
Cool. So my
name is Daniel and I
cover public school finance
for the LES C.
Uh This is the first staff
panel of the 2024
TRM. So I want to
welcome you all back
to the LES C.
Uh We're gonna have a very immersive
work plan uh for the
year that you all care about
later in the afternoon. But
we appreciate each of you
for your individual and
collective contributions
to the committee and we
look forward to serving you in
whichever ways we can
during the interim.
So you all mentioned
budget in the previous
panel. So that was a
perfect transition to
this conversation because
we have the state land office
and the State Investment Council
who will each provide context
on what they do on
their roles in supporting public schools.
Fiscally. Uh We
have Suele Stewart,
Deputy Commissioner of Operation at the
State Land Office.
We have Charles Wollman,
Director of Communications, client
and legislative matters at the State
Investment Council
and we have Don Iglesias
Investment strategist also
at the State Investment
Council.
So you are going to hear about
the history and trends
around the funding that each
agency generates for public
schools, the sources
of that funding
and updates on the endowment
funds that you all have created for
early childhood and
higher education
and just for clarity, this
is not a revenue estimate
panel nor is it a
starting point for the fy
26 budget
process. Uh The panel
is only intended to
inform you all about
where this money comes from,
where we've been
and where we may be
going.
And then from that context,
we hope to lay a foundation
in this committee uh
for continuing to move toward
multiyear and strategic
budgeting where
we as a committee are
setting long term goals for
supporting public schools in
ways that are intentional
responsive and
measurable and
that are aligned with the LES C
roadmap.
So starting off with the State Land
Office,
>> Mr Chair
uh Mr Vice Chair members
of the committee. Thank you so much for the
opportunity to be here today.
I'm Sula Stewart, Deputy
Commissioner of Operations State
Land Office. I also have
um Antonio Medina with
me today, who's our
director
of our accounting division.
I really happy to
be here. You know, we don't
often get to talk about
education. Um
and the State Land Office
is all about education.
Uh we were established
uh for the purpose of creating
working lands to help fund
education. And we're really big
part that financing
mechanism uh in the
state. So we really do
appreciate the opportunity to kind
of walk through uh how
we fit into that find
funding structure,
um how the land office
works, uh who are
beneficiaries are.
Uh and you know where
the money goes, why it goes to
certain places and
those types of details
that um you
know, I think are, are often
kind of uh buried
in the day to day. Um
So just real quick in terms
of agenda, I'm gonna give a brief overview
of the state land office,
our beneficiaries land
allocations, our
earnings and distributions for the two
different funds and
some revenue trends that show
how this play out in a couple of
the uh uh
different beneficiaries
that we have and
then uh end with some,
some key takeaways. I'll
try to keep it brief. I know we're running a little
bit behind, so I'll try to hit on
about 10 minutes in the
presentation and try
not to subject you
to death by powerpoint.
Um
So just real quick on
slide three, a little bit about
the state land trust.
Um The federal government gave
us working lands
uh Both when we were territory
and then when we became a state
and those lands were
set aside uh for a particular
purpose and that was to help support
public institutions,
universities and
hospitals. Um
We've got 21 different
beneficiaries
and uh the,
the structure
uh is basically that the
land commissioner manages
the land, um
uh earns money off
of the land and then that
money uh is
also distributed or
transferred to the State
Investment Council and they
handle kind of the investment
portion of some of our
lands or some of the earnings
from our lands.
One kind of other key
point about state lands is
that I want to make.
Um we have a lot of
legal restrictions
that uh put
um barriers and
confines on the way that
we utilize our
lands and the
money that we, we make.
Um
this is part of federal
law under the enabling Act.
Um And it's also part of our,
our constitution and state
law. We're required
to charge for the use
of state trust lands. Uh
It's not something that we can
just even it's a wonderful
public purpose, we can't
utilize them for free.
Um
The courts
have looked at our
obligation to our
beneficiaries and
not the state in general.
Um And that's an important
distinction when we
look at, you know, charging
the Department of Transportation, for
example, for right away, it's
like, why is the state charging the
state? It's because we're
obligated to make money for our
beneficiaries.
So looking
at um slide
four, gives you kind of an overview
of land ownership in New
Mexico. Um
We've got about 9 million acres
of surface and about 13
million acres of mineral
estate. Uh On the
map here were
the blue squares.
Um And
BLM is the
yellow uh
kind of the orangish
is uh uh tribal
lands and the white is
private. So
as you can see, we have land
in every single county in the
state. Uh
And we generate a lot of money.
Last year, we generated
$2.7
billion from our working lands,
which is just an incredible amount
of money. But basically
any activity, you can imagine
a lot in the energy sector,
everything from agricultural
economic development.
Um Really any
type of uh real estate
activity you can imagine
uh on slide
five,
this lays out and
I know the map here is uh
impossible to read, but
that there's also a handout
as well, which is
maybe a little bit less impossible
but still very difficult to read.
Uh This is on our website
um uh
but this lays out
basically which
beneficiaries are
allocated, which lands
um
when we were granted the
lands is when the assignment
was made. So this
isn't kind of something that
we redo
every year or anything like
that. It is set.
Um And
uh each of the different
beneficiaries have both
surface estate and mineral
estate that is assigned to
them
on uh slide
six. This lays out kind
of how those allocations
occurred. Um You
have a township which
is essentially uh
36 different
sections um
and each section
is assigned to a
specific beneficiary.
So one of the 21
beneficiaries
and any money that is
derived off of that
specific parcel of
land goes
to that specific
beneficiary. So,
um and I'll get into this
later, but it's one of the reasons
why we see these
huge fluctuations
in some of our land maintenance fund
uh revenue uh
is because of
this kind of checkerboard
allocation. And
you know, we don't always know what
activities are going to occur
on which tracts of land,
which applications are going to come in
the door, et cetera.
So um
the, the money
basically has two
different uh
mechanisms that it
is transferred out. One
is through the land grant permanent fund
where uh if
we have a permanent
depletion of
a resource. So think oil
and gas, once you take it out of the
ground, it's never coming back.
A land sale that is a
permanent depletion.
Those revenues
are transferred to the
State Investment Council for
investment in the land grant, permanent
fund. Um
We are the
contributing source of the land
grant permanent fund. That's
where those contributions
come from. As a state land
office, we have other
revenue, which is a much smaller
piece of the pie and that's
the land maintenance fund.
These are quote renewable
revenues. These are revenues
where we can
keep generating money off of
the land without depleting that
resource. So it would be
everything from agriculture,
renewable energy, a right
away a business
lease. Uh those
types of things would be
funded through the land or
would be distributed through
the land maintenance
fund.
Um On
slide seven, this
gives you an idea by
fund what our earnings
look like. As you can
see the, the record
amount that we had in fy
23 2.7
billion,
2.62
0.6 billion
was uh through the
land maintenance or I'm sorry,
land grant permanent fund.
So the the vast
majority of our revenue
and our earnings
are transferred
to the State
Investment Council. We
only had about 100 and
37 million
um that went through the
land Maintenance
Fund.
Um Slide eight
is basically just kind
of an example. I know there's a
lot going on here
of what a fiscal year
looks like. So this
is um
fy 23.
Uh the top part
we earn 2.7
billion in total.
The 137 million
is what went to the land Maintenance
Fund. We take out
for our budget. Our operations
are are paid for
through the land maintenance
fund. Uh We
take uh 1% out
for a remediation restoration
fund that helps us do
projects on state trust land
and then those are
distributed each month
directly to the beneficiaries.
So the land maintenance fund
is really the most
immediate funding mechanism
uh for our
beneficiaries uh
on the land grant permanent
fund side. Uh As
I mentioned, we had 2.6
billion that goes to the land
grant permanent fund,
it's invested, uh
it grows
and then, and they'll be going into
it in a lot more detail.
You know, there are formulas
that uh
um dictate
how that money is
distributed to the
beneficiaries.
So I wanted to hit on
a couple of just very
high level distinctions
between these mechanisms.
One is stabilization
and two is growth.
Um The land
grant permanent fund
stabilizes
earnings prior
to distributions.
So you can see from this chart
on, on nine,
the blue is what we're
sending over to
the State Investment Council.
And um
I'm sorry, I
had that reversed
the uh and I don't
know what this is. If it's orange or
brown, I can't
quite make it out.
Uh But
that, that
one burnt orange.
Um Those are our
contributions to the land
grant uh Permanent
Fund and then the
distributions that the S
IC actually sends out the door
and in a fiscal year
um are gonna be less
because they're rolling on a
five year
distribution cycle.
Uh that's really positive
in terms of predictability and
growth. Um
So, you know, you're
able to, to see
that um uh
distribution kind of
inch up as opposed to
when you have peak years, you
know, we're going to really see in a couple of
years, the impact of those
three record uh
years that we were, we're
doing. Um
the other aspect of the
land grant Permanent Fund
uh is growth. You
know, when we transfer money to the land
grant permanent fund, it
grows in value, it's
invested. Uh There's
interest um you
have the corpus
um that is something
that really provides
for more
bang for our buck when
it comes to the money that we
uh uh eventually get
to the dis um distributions
for the beneficiaries,
the land maintenance fund. If you
look on 11,
it has a neither
growth
nor a
stabilization.
So a
dollar in a dollar out.
Uh and it's actually probably,
you know, 98
cents out because we take out for our
budget. Um
You'll see that you
have this
um uh
you know, high volatility
uh that's going and
you know, there, there's no kind
of a growth
of the earnings prior
to distribution. We
earn the money and then each month
we transfer it out to the
beneficiaries
on uh slide
12,
this is really the high
volatility. So unlike
the land grant Permanent Fund,
which really was stabilized
in terms of our earnings and then
distributions.
Um the land maintenance
fund is all over the place
and you will hear
from the different beneficiaries
last year I made,
you know, uh 3 million this
year it was 600,000.
What happened? Um How
do I budget? How do I
predict what I will
get next year? And
the answer is often we don't
know, we, we cannot
forecast very well.
We don't know what applications
are going to come in the door. We
don't know which projects
will actually get to fruition
um on which
parcels of land.
And so I just highlight
that, that volatility can
be really hard from a budgeting
perspective. Uh And
also, you know, from a beneficiary
perspective, um
slide 13 breaks
down what the different
revenue sources that are
really driving this
volatility. Uh
One of the big ones on
your left is oil and gas
lease bonus income.
So oil and gas revenue goes
to the permanent fund,
but we have
monthly auctions and
that revenue uh from
the auctions goes to the land
maintenance fund.
It is not earning from the
lease they're simply paying
for the right to get the
lease. Um And
so those that's why they're technically
renewable. And you can
see if we have a really
good parcel goes out
to bid. You can make $12
million and then the next
month it could be
300,000. So
you have these huge
fluctuations um
also a little bit difficult to
see. But on the other chart, it looks
at some of the other income
sources, you know,
agriculture pretty much
flat. Um
it is set are what we
charge is set by a
formula that goes
up and down a little bit every
year. But we saw huge
fluctuations, for example, in
interest payments where
we deal with such large amounts of
money that when we actually have
interest rates that are
higher, we bring in a
lot. Um
and you know,
everything from fees and
copies can really
go up and down uh
every year.
Um The next
uh three slides
are really just
examples
of uh both the
common schools, which is the public
schools. Um The
common schools are our biggest
beneficiary. Uh We
transfer our, our
funds basically to the general
fund through D FA for,
for the public schools.
And you'll see,
you know, the, the amounts
here between the land maintenance
fund uh distributions,
you know, range anywhere between
40 million a year,
all the way up to, you know, 100
and 30
then the land grant
permanent fund transfers,
you know, have been steadily
going up uh every
year. Um
Also there's a handout
uh that provides
the uh a table
of these specific beneficiaries
that shows actual dollar
amounts.
Um the school
for the blind and the school for the
deaf on, on slides,
15 and 16
are really, um,
it was actually kind of interesting when we
did this chart, they almost
aligned exactly uh in
terms of their revenue and I, I thought
it was maybe a mistake at first,
but their land allocation
is actually very
similar. Um They're only
a couple 1000 acres off
um uh each other.
So, um the
revenue that they're generating
is, is very similar
in that fashion.
All right. So, um
and I know I'm flying through this pretty quickly
and there's a lot here
but wanted to hit on kind of
the key takeaways, which
is slide
17,
um how our
earnings are distributed
um really depends
on the nature of the revenue
and where that activity
occurs. Uh And
so that's something that's really
important to keep in mind when
we're looking at why
certain fluctuations are
occurring. The
land maintenance fund
is helpful in
terms of providing
more immediate distributions
to beneficiaries,
which in turn can, can
help the general fund and
especially in a tight
budget year. I think that's something
that the legislature
uh you know,
appreciates. Um
But it really, it lacks
the stabilizing and growth
aspects that the land grant permanent
fund um have.
And let me just kind of put
that into context in like
a real life example.
Today we just did a wind
energy lease. Um
just like I was saying, we do
monthly bonus lease sales
for oil and gas. We
also do uh bonus
lease sales and auctions
for renewable energy.
So today we
did an auction
and we got about
$530,000
for a wind lease. But
that wind lease is going to bring
in around 100 and
$8 million
over the life of that
lease.
All of that money
is going to lack
the
growth
side and the stabilization
side that you see through the land grant
permanent fund. So
as, and this makes
a big difference as we
diversify our revenue
sources, we're
not growing our
revenue off of a
renewable energy dollar
like we are off of an oil
and gas dollar. Um
And that has implications
fiscally as we make
these energy transitions
for the state.
Um you know, land
maintenance funds are also, as
I mentioned, very volatile
and this can be difficult
for budgeting
on, you know, the LFC
side, DDA side,
the agency side,
we can't provide an
accurate uh
you know, amount for
each beneficiary of what
we think they're going to get in maintenance
money. So,
you know, if we say, well, we, we're
gonna probably make between
100 million and 200
million a year. That
that's a pretty big uh
variation there that
that's um
very, in terms
of uncertainty.
Um
Lastly, I just wanna
end
on
the, the state
land Trust is
a huge economic
um a huge
fiscal
uh driver in our
state. Um It
is something that
is an asset that
is amazing uh
that we have, that we've done
well fiscally.
Uh that, that really
helps fund
education. It's
also has a ton of
opportunity to meet
the needs of communities and, and I
haven't gone into this
today because it's not really the
heart of a conversation
but um housing,
for example, doing affordable
housing projects in
communities across the state. We have
senior housing in Albuquerque.
We're doing projects in Las
Cruces. We're doing projects
all around that can
really meet the needs of the community
while we earn
money and make that
um uh uh
that earning
that we have to do constitutionally.
So with that,
um I will end and
happy to take any questions the
committee may have at the end of
the panel. Thank
you,
>> Mr Mr, chairman,
members of the committee. Uh Thank
you for giving me the opportunity
to present to
today on behalf of the State Investment
Council. My name is Charles
Wan. I'm director of
Communications, client and
legislative
matters.
Thank you.
Um That, that
we stole away from the
LFC. Uh We're very
glad to have her. I would
point out that uh da uh
as
does lots of things for us
including legislative work
like this, but also
works on the investment
side. Um
And uh just
last week, Dawn did pass
for her ka, this is
a, she is now a chartered
alternative investment
analyst. Um it's
a very nice uh
recognition and
quite an accomplishment. So
uh just wanted
to point that out, you
should have a, a copy of uh
this blue uh publication
here. And I will also try to be
brief in my comments.
Um I'm going to start off
with an overview and then Don will
go into some of the projections
that we have regarding these
funds
um As far as current SS
IC matters. Uh
As you're probably aware, uh
the council
selected John Clark
as the new State Investment Officer
back in January,
John as a
background that includes
uh being a
acting secretary at
the Economic Development Department
and uh a background with
the legislative finance
committee as well.
Um and also some
work in business development.
The legislature in
January also appointed two
new council members uh
replacing two other members
who had termed out. Those
would be Kelly o'donnell and Allen
Sanchez. Kelly
o'donnell has a long
history as an economist
here in the state, uh
working at TRD
Economic Development Department.
Um and I believe
regulation and
licensing. Um
Currently, she's uh with
home wise uh
Alan Sanchez is
a long time child
advocate and uh
also uh
has assisted
with the management oversight
of uh ch I Saint
Joseph's. Uh
uh they have 100 and $10
million endowment. And
so uh he has experience
in, in managing these
types of large institutional
funds. We're very glad to have
these new members and happy
with the level of engagement we're
seeing. Um
In earlier this
year, the legislature did uh
create three new endowment
funds uh that
the S IC will start managing
in July, that includes
a higher education trust
fund. This was created
with a
$900 million
transfer out of the tax
stabilization Reserve
uh and will be used
primarily to, to pay
college tuition for New Mexico
students. The
workforce development and
apprenticeship trust
fund is a new creation
of the legislature.
Um And I
guess hosted by
um
it, it will actually
target uh work
worker training.
Um And that's a $30
million fund uh with
about a 1010
year uh horizon.
We believe capital
development and reserve fund. This
is a new fund
as well. It will
serve capital outlay needs
of the legislature and give you some additional
options and flexibility.
So in all, we have 12
different permanent
or endowment or
reserve funds that the,
the council is now overseeing.
Um Now, five years ago,
we were managing four different
funds. So this
creation of these new funds
is I I believe a welcome
um
development. It, it
certainly is a
way to make
uh today's excess
resources into
resources that can
be grown and used
again tomorrow.
In addition, the council oversees
uh more than $2
billion for 25
different government entities.
This includes everything from
uh the RHC
A. They are our largest
uh client, the retiree
health care authority
with more than a billion
dollars.
Um And
the smallest client we have is,
is uh Springer school
district and they actually
have $300,000 that
they established with us. Back
in the 19 nineties, they use
that to fund student
scholarships. Uh They
have maintained and, and grown
that fund over time.
Um and they get to
participate with the
permanent funds. Um
so effectively, uh
we, we provide
this service uh as
part of what S IC does
as part of our overall
mission.
Now, the total fund distributions
this year will hit the
$2 billion
mark for the first time
in fiscal year
25. I would
point out that just five
years ago in fiscal year 20
was the first time we ever crossed
the $1 billion
me
metric.
Um We have
expanded with the
creation of the early childhood
fund which is now $7
billion. Um
The, the distributions
that are made every year.
Um It's, it's frankly
amazing and this kind of growth
you will not see anywhere among
similar funds across the
country. Uh
Total assets grew
actually by almost $9
billion in calendar year
23 and we
now manage
$53
billion
overall.
On the next slide, that's slide.
Three. this is
kind of a breakdown with
details regarding
these funds that uh the
the council currently
manages. Um
that includes the $30 billion
land grant fund, the almost
$10 billion severance tax
fund. And as I
mentioned, the early childhood
education and care fund,
which has grown to $7
billion since it was
originated in
only 2020.
It's, it's amazing.
Um Also,
uh we have
uh these smaller targeted
endowments and they
start small uh
they can grow over time
and provide stability and
revenue and also
long term impact.
Um This is for everything
from uh water
to conservation and
the rural libraries
endowment
on slide
four.
This is kind of uh more
details on each of the
individual funds that we manage
or will be managing
uh with their creation
in a couple of months.
Um And so
there's details here on how
each fund operates. I am
not going to go through all
of this, but it is a good reference for
you if you need to
know uh basically
um or summarize
the funding mechanisms for the
funds, the distribution
and structures uh
that they have as far as
their spending policy every
year. Um And
then just other
details, for example,
the tobacco Severance Permanent
Fund this last year
uh the legislature passed a bill
removing that fund
from the state's reserves.
This is a good move
fiscally um one,
we can afford to do that.
And, and two, it
allows the council to manage
these funds more efficiently
um to, to
increase and improve
outcomes and returns over
time.
Um Slide five again,
more of these funds and,
and the overdue overview
of the endowments that we were
managing um each
has different goals and
different expectations.
We try to work with
the the
beneficiary if you will
for uh each of these
funds in developing our risk
return profiles.
And uh we
want to make sure that the funds do
as expected. I would
encourage you if you are looking
at creating other
uh endowments of this nature.
I mean, there were, I think at
1.10 or maybe a dozen
different um
funds that
were introduced
through uh draft
legislation this year,
we were considered by the
legislature.
We're glad to, to chat
with you and work with you
to make sure that the fund
that you want to create
does what you
want to do. And
so, uh please work with
us on that, reach out. We're
glad to, to chat with any of
you about that.
Um
So how do we done
on slide six? You do
kind of see uh
the performance
for the permanent funds
and the other funds that we
manage. You're going to see a lot of
variants and that
generally will uh
the underlying reasons
for that. It depends on
how risky the investments
that uh each fund
has
and, and how those, you
know, whether those risks paid off
or not. And so this
is the long term performance, I
would say in, in
summary, um
we are generally
going to be balanced and diversified
in these funds. We have an
aversion to volatility.
Uh
that
I think we, we very
much uh uh focus
on that old
uh standby that
if you lose 50%
of your investment, you're gonna need
100% in positive
returns to get back to where you
started. So we,
we don't like uh
volatility and uh
we tend to be rather conservative
in our allocations.
The flagship land
grant fund uh
has uh mostly met
its targets across most
time periods and that's
a 7% annualized
return. Um
We, we are effectively
participating in the current
upside we've seen over the last
decade uh in the
public markets. And
uh we're also very
cognizant and try to protect
those gains
uh to avoid
any kind of downside
capture. Um
I'm going to go ahead and hand it off to Don
now and uh
to, to look at the projections
and some analysis on
where many of these funds
and their impact uh has,
has headed um
where we're going in the coming
years.
>> Good morning, Mr, chair and members
of the committee, I'm Don Iglesias
with the State Investment Council and it
is wonderful to be in front of you all
again today.
I'm gonna be starting on page seven
of the S IC presentation,
looking at the growth in the land
grant permanent
fund.
We have two charts here
showing both the contributions
to the fund um
over, you know,
roughly the last
um almost 20
years from the state
land office and
it tracks those contributions
against the growth in
state land oil production.
So you can see what has really
been driving. That
increase has been just
the incredible amount of
growth that we have seen
in the production of oil and gas
on state lands.
And that has contributed to
significantly more
inflows going into the
land grant permanent fund and
driving a lot of its uh
dollar value growth
in addition to the compound
earnings that it's getting from
its investment returns.
And if you look at
um just the difference
between say calendar
year 2013,
the fund stood at
$13.4
billion today.
It's at $30
billion. This fund has more than
doubled over the course of 10
years
and it will distribute
$1.34
billion to its beneficiaries
in uh this fiscal
year and nearly $1.5
billion to beneficiaries in fy
25.
As uh Sule was
describing the five
year average really helps
to stabilize
the impact of any market
volatility or changes
of inflows into the
funds so that the general
fund is not our, our
beneficiaries overall
are not as affected by that
volatility as the
fund itself. And one of the
best examples we have of
that and part of why we took this
chart back as far as we
did. So you could see the impact of
the great financial crisis. So
if you're looking at the land grant
permanent fund chart with
me from
2007 to 2008,
the market value of the land
grant Permanent fund itself
fell 27%
in one year.
But in fiscal year
2008, the
distribution
from the land grant
fund to the general fund
actually increased
that year and it increased
again the year after that
because those distributions were
based on a rolling
average. And I
went back and looked at the 2009
consensus revenue report
from that period
and you look at all the
other funding sources to the general
fund gross receipts,
taxes down income
taxes down, all
other major revenue
sources were primarily down,
but you had your permanent
fund distributions
actually increasing
in that year. And that is really
where the beauty of that
five year rolling average comes
into play because it
smooths that volatility
and the single year
impacts of the market moves
or if uh
production or
prices were to drop
significantly in a year and it
changes those inflows.
The general fund doesn't feel that
impact immediately. It's smoothed
over time.
And so you see in the period
following the general
uh the sorry, the great
financial crisis that
instead of really seeing a
significant decline in the
general fund distributions
in those years, it
sort of smoothed off and then
eventually started to pick back
up as the fund recovered
over
time.
Turning to page
eight, this
is looking at our different land grant
permanent fund beneficiaries as
both um
Charlie and Sule
mentioned, we have 21
different beneficiaries and a common
misnomer is the land grant permanent
Fund is a single
fund. It is actually
a combination of
21 different
permanent funds that are
all invested together.
So every beneficiary of
these funds is
entitled to the fund
that they own that is
developed from the contributions
they get from the state
land office. And
you'll see that the permanent school
fund, which is also known as for
common schools, the distribution
goes to common schools
is the largest of these
roughly
87%.
And actually the report
here or the page here
that uh the land office
has provided for you really shows
why that fund is
so much larger. When you
look at this, you see a lot
more light red on
this chart, they own a lot more
land. But
also when you look here at the
bottom corner of this
chart in Eddie and Lee
County, you see
primarily that light
red for common schools. So
not only do they own more
land, but they
also have some of the most
productive land via oil
and gas in the
entire state. So their
fund is growing
differently than that
of the other funds because it's
seeing a lot of that oil and gas
ben benefit
disproportionately more
than the other
funds.
Um As Suny had
mentioned, the beneficiaries
received royalties
from non-renewable
production.
Um
and that
uh distribution goes
directly to the
beneficiary, it cannot be used
for any other purpose. So this
typically shows up in House
Bill two when those funds are
appropriated as other
state funds. So if you're trying
to look for where the land
grant permanent fund distribution
is for any individual
budget, say for University
of New Mexico, it's usually gonna
show up in that other state
funds line.
And
um
while the distribution
for common schools is
generally considered a, a
revenue source
overall for the general
fund, ultimately, those
monies only flow
directly into the public
school fund, uh which
is used for the seg and other
school related expenditures.
Now, I'll explain with the
125 distribution that
changed a little this
year and I'll go into some more detail
on that, but each
beneficiary receives
their distribution
directly, but the legislature
has the power to appropriate
those money. So even though it
goes, the full amount
is, is distributed
to the beneficiary,
the legislature still has to
appropriate it in House Bill
two.
So next on page nine, if
we're looking at
the change in the land grant
distributions over time. This
is really illustrating
how the difference
in um
productivity of the state
lands is changing the relative
ownership of these
funds. So if you're looking with
me on the left hand side of the
chart, this is the percentage
ownership of the overall
combined land grant permanent
funds. And you'll see that
the permanent school fund has
consistently over time
increased its percentage
share. And that's because
again, that concentration
in Eddie and Lee County, more
royalties are being developed for
oil and gas production.
So it's making up a bigger
and bigger share over
time of the land grant
permanent funds. So
as a percentage, you'll see
that other beneficiaries,
their percentages are declining
over time, but that
doesn't mean that their distributions
are declining because the fund
all is growing. And we show you
this here on the
right hand side
where you can see the increases of the
permanent school fund. And then we've
pulled out school for the deaf
and school for the blind here. But
this the story
is the same for many of the
other ben or for all of the other
beneficiaries where even though their
percentage share is declining,
their actual distributions
from the permanent fund
are increasing over time as
the size of that fund
increases.
On the next couple of slides,
I'm singling out
just the permanent school
fund um since
it is the the
largest of the land grant, permanent
funds um and is
also relevant to your
all's discussions here today.
So, looking at just
the permanent school fund
distributions,
you can see if you look from
Fy 13 to Fy
23 there was more
than 100% increase in
distributions over that
period. So a
$446
million in growth over
that period.
And in Fy 24 the fund
will distribute about
1.2 billion and
1.35 in Fy
25 you'll
see here that we
have the original 5%
distribution that was
um prior
to the recent constitutional
amendment, this fund
along with all the other funds
distributed 5%
of the rolling five year
average. The constitutional
amendment that was passed just
a few years ago
increased by
1.25%.
The distribution only
from the permanent school fund,
all the other beneficiaries
remain at a 5%
distribution rate and
you see the impact of that total
1.25 on the blue
bars here, but
we've also separated out. So you
can see the dollar amounts
for the 40% that was
allocated for public
schools. The purpose
of this set in statute was for
enhanced instruction, extending
the public school year, extending the school
year and public school teacher
compensation. So
40% of that additional
amount for fy
24 was about 97
million. The other
60% added a
beneficiary of the common
school fund. To um
early childhood
and that will distribute
or did distribute 100 and
45 million for fy
25 and
will also grow over time
as the size of the fund
grows to
make this a little easier for
you all to see. I've separated it
out on the next slide page
11 so
that we can just look at the
part that goes to public
schools and then in
a moment, we'll go over the early
childhood piece.
So for just the amount that goes
to public schools, you see the original
5% distribution
on top of the
40% additional
um amount of the
1.25.
So in fy 24
we're looking at over a billion
dollars to public schools
from the land grant permanent fund
for these distributions
that increased to almost
1.2 billion in
fy 25.
And part of the reason we've
separated this out, the way
we have is so that you can see
these year over year
increases and
this in a way should
help give you an idea of
looking forward to the next budgeting
cycle. Now, this is again,
not a consensus revenue
estimate. They will be very
similar because again, on these
five year rolling averages, it's
not going to move very
much. Uh But please look
to the consensus revenue estimate,
not this document.
Um I just
want to make that clear, but this is
just to give you an idea
of the expected changes
in the funding that you might be able to
look forward to in the upcoming
session. And so for fy
26 you see the
year over year increase for
public school distributions from
the land grant fund only
is 100 and 26
million. So that would be 100 and
26 million in new dollars
distributed from these permanent
funds that can only
be used for public
schools
in the
next page
page 12,
I'm going over the early childhood
education and care
fund.
Um
This fund as Charles
had mentioned has grown
very significantly
since it was created with
$300 million
in 2020
was $5.7
billion at the end of 2023.
And today is over
$7
billion
and we're
illustrating here exactly
how that is. How did
this fund grow so
much in such a short
period of time? And it is due
entirely to the way that
it was designed to
capture windfall
revenues. And in
2022 and
2023 was a
prime example
of what windfall
revenues look
like. And so if you
see here,
uh on the left hand
side, this shows
the total amount of school
tax and federal royalty
dollars that come into
the state. Now, the
early childhood fund
looks at the five year
average of these and
anything that comes in from
those two revenue sources, that's
above that five year
average automatically gets
distributed into this early
childhood fund.
And you'll see in Fy 20
in Fy 21 the amount
over that average was not very
much. And then in Fy 22
you had a price spike
where oil prices went to
100 and $20
production was still
growing. And in Fy
23 you were still seeing
the stabilization of
that, but prices still remain
significantly elevated
than they were from the average
45 $50
that we saw for the five
years between 2015
and 2020.
So what you had is
very large
spikes in these revenue
sources, but a five
year average reference
point. So it takes that five
year average time to
grow and the immediate
amounts you get in those years
resulted in massive amounts
of dollars were then
distributed to these funds.
The chart on the bottom
right hand corner kind of
takes the amounts
over this blue five
year average on the left chart
and translates,
translates it just
into what are those
distribution amounts.
And so you see
in calendar year 22/3
billion dollars was
generated and deposited
into the
early childhood fund
uh in calendar year
23
almost 2 billion. So in the
last two years alone, that fund
has received 5
billion and then
it received another distribution
that was actually due at the end
of last fiscal year but
came a little late. So
the timing is, is off
for these, but uh another
2 billion was received in
January. So those were the
amounts that were attributable
to fiscal years
22 and
23.
And you'll notice
that over time
as we look at the forward
looking forecast. Now
again, this is not a consensus
revenue estimate. Um
You'll get that in August,
but this is very close to
what the consensus estimate is
put out. We use our own internal
tracking for this. Um But
the numbers won't be terribly
different. Um But
you'll see that as that five
year average grows,
that threshold
is then harder and harder to beat.
So the distributions to the early
childhood fund get smaller and
smaller and we're actually not
expecting any additional
distributions into that fund
after fy 26
based on the
current five year average and the
current projections. Now, if you
had another windfall
here, prices go to
100 and $20
you'll probably get distributions
into this fund. But it's really
designed to capture those
windfalls and it does so very
effectively, which you can
see and how the fund has
grown.
So then turning to page
13, what are those distributions
look like? And what does it look
like? Combined with the
additional 60%
that early childhood is
receiving from
the 1.25%
of the Land Grant Permanent Fund. And
this stacks these here together
for you. So the
early childhood
education and care
fund colloquial,
colloquially known
as the Early Childhood Trust
Fund um that distributed
100 and 50 million in fy
24 and 250
million and will be distributed
in fy 25. That's
a minimum threshold that
was set by the, the
legislature.
Um
And
these amounts
combined with the
distribution from the
land Grant Permanent Fund, which
is about 100 and 45
million in fiscal year
24 growing
to 100 and 62 million
in 25.
And you can see these totals for early
childhood from these two
funds in sort of the middle
of this chart here,
295 for 24
4, 12 for
25.
So significant amounts
of growth. And if you look here
on our forward looking
estimates baseline
expectations,
um this is
where we see potential for
this funding to go.
And you see from the 412
that was last allocated
in this legislative session. Fy
25 from
these two sources
has potential by Fy
30 depending on
inflows and market
performance, potential to grow
to over 800 million
from these two combined
sources. Again,
this year, over year increase
can be a proxy for you
all. Um looking
into the next session and I
encourage you to look at it this way too
when the consensus estimate comes
out to add these numbers
together and think about early
childhood funding.
So for fy 26
we're estimating potentially
a $66 million
increase in these
distributions that will
be solely for the
purpose of early childhood
from these two funding sources.
And then you'll notice a relatively
large jump in Fy
27 to 100 and
$31 million
increase. And that's because
this one operates on a
three year rolling average
for distributions instead of a
five year. So in Fy
27 the
prior three years are
significantly larger
than the three years prior to
Fy 26. So you'll see
a relatively large
um proportional jump
there.
Turn to page
14,
this is separating out the
land grant permanent fund
and the early childhood funds.
Um looking at it as a percentage
of the public school budget
and the early childhood
budget and you'll see the growing
importance of this over
time as
these distributions
have increased and as the funds have
grown.
So for fy
23 if
we are just looking at the
total public school
operating budget
and then the per amount
that the land grant permanent fund
distributes as a percentage
of that budget. It was
23% in
Fy 23.
Now by Fy
25 of what
has been budgeted
for public school funding.
If you look at both
the original 5%
distribution and the uh
portion of the new
1.25%
that's now increased to
27% of the public
school budget is funded by the
land grant permanent funds
distributions.
When we're looking at early
childhood and just
funding across all
systems,
um from any
funding source, including federal
funds, et cetera,
you'll see a total here for
the amount that was budgeted
um found in the LFC post
session reports. And then just
looking at the early childhood
fund distribution along
with 60% of the land grant
fund in this
coming fiscal year. For Fy
25 funding
from these sources makes
up 58%
of the early childhood
budget. Uh
412
million versus the
709 total
that was appropriated for
fy 25. So
these are becoming
increasingly
important funding
sources over
time for both of these
purposes.
On the next slide page
15, this is really
included for reference.
I won't go into a lot of detail
on the scenarios that were run
here, but we did make a full
scale presentation to our
council a couple of
months ago on how
we prepare for
energy transition in terms
of the outlook. How do we
expect that to change our fund
growth scenarios? What do
we think that will change for
distributions?
And so we look
at um
a energy
forecaster called Ryad
energy. They have several
different uh
energy transition
scenarios which basically
back into different
uh climate
uh degree
rises and say what would
production look like under
these different scenarios,
given a set of assumptions
and we flow those assumptions
through to our models to say how
is how do these different
scenarios
look different from what we're
currently just our baseline
projection? And so you can
see each of those lines
here. This page is how
the value of the
fund changes in
these scenarios. The next
page page 16
is how the distributions
change in each of these
scenarios.
Now, the value of this
exercise, because to
be honest, no one really
knows how fast the energy
transition will occur.
Well, overall, uh
the speed of the transition
will be the
value of this exercise isn't
really in the numbers themselves,
but in the usefulness for
planning to make sure that we're
being forward looking and
looking at different outcomes
or a different potential growth
paths for these funds and
their distributions based on
different outcomes.
So that we can get a general
idea of what the future may
hold depending on
the energy transition being
very, very fast
and thereby
oil and gas revenues decline
very quickly in the near term.
Or if the energy transition
is very slow and
oil and gas revenues decline more
slowly over
time. So you see the
differences in the growth paths
here. And I think the
key takeaway from this
chart is that under
each of these scenarios,
the distributions
still grow even
under scenarios in which there's
very low contributions from
oil and gas funds.
And for example, if
we're looking at the early childhood
fund, a lot of the reason
for that is the strong growth that
that fund has already
experienced in the size
of that fund now. And
the fact that we're already not
expecting
much additional contribution
into the early childhood fund
because of its mechanism,
its current growth path
is not terribly
dependent for early
childhood, specifically
on where those contributions
go
um in terms of
size. So
we're looking at by
fy 30 you know, we
have a $800
million estimate for
distributions. But we
see that under these different
scenarios, it could range anywhere
from 700 million to
900 million. So still
relatively significant
growth regardless of
scenario,
uh same thing for a land grant
fund, the contributions
which do um
matter quite a bit.
But with the compounding of the fund
and the size of the fund, we're still
expecting additional uh
significant growth
regardless of those oil
and gas path trajectories,
at least under these energy
transition
scenarios.
On page 17, I
have some brief detail
on the Higher Education
Trust Fund. This was created
with Senate Bill 159
this last session um as
Charlie had mentioned, it was a
$959
million transfer from
uh the severance tax
or excuse me from the
tax stabilization reserve
into this new
higher Education trust
fund that is
officially created as
of today. Um
to May 15th, the bill is
now effective. Our
council will be setting an asset
allocation for that in our
upcoming meeting later this
month. Unfortunately,
until we have an asset allocation,
I'm not able to really present
to you expected growth
paths because it really depends
on what that allocation looks
like as a frame
of reference I've included
here, a slide
that was presented to our council
last month
that just shows the
different types of returns
and asset allocations
uh for the various funds
that we manage. So it will
likely look some
either like one of these
funds or something in between
one of these funds and we'll be happy
to give an update to you all
once that asset allocation
is set. Um However,
we know the fiscal year 25
distribution that will be
$48 million
because that was set in
statute. And then
from there, it will distribute
5% of the three
year rolling average. So it will
function in that way
very similarly to similarly
to the early childhood trust
fund. Now,
like most of all the other
new endowment funds that have been
created, this fund can
be expended in the event
of a fiscal emergency
um to shore up
general fund budgets if
there's a
downfall.
And lastly, I
wanna
look at
two things. One for page
18, I was
asked to speak on Senate bill
26.
So this was a,
this was a bill passed in
2023
that makes another
contribution of windfall
oil and gas revenues but to
the Severance tax fund instead
of to um or
in addition to the distributions to the
early childhood trust
fund,
and it
basically
caps the amount
of oil and gas
school tax and
federal royalty
revenue that the general
fund can receive. So only those
two revenue sources, but they
are the largest revenue
sources of direct
oil and gas money into the
general fund. It accounts for over
90%
of direct oil and
gas revenue
and now those funds
will either go into
the excess of the five year average.
We still continue to go
into the early childhood trust
fund, um,
or any
amount
below that five year
average, but above what
the general fund received
in fy 24
that difference, which is the
yellow uh on
this chart, on the left hand
side, that is the amount
that will then be deposited into
the severance tax
fund.
There's a lot of benefits to
the way the legislature
designed this specific
mechanism.
One is that
it very
significantly
reduces general
fund volatility from
oil and gas revenue as
you can see here again,
because these two sourcess are
90% of direct
oil and gas revenue into the
general fund. And that
number is now flat
and it takes a large
move in the
projection
for
the general fund to be affected
in the revenue estimates
from this change. So for
example,
the fy 24
cap again, it will depend
on how revenues come in this year,
but roughly two
point eightish
billion
dollars.
Um
It will take from
the over 4 billion
of revenue that's estimated
from these fund sources. You
would need a very large
move. So we did some
back of the napkin math for your own
reference here. So something
like today, a
move to
$45 in
oil uh per
barrel and no production
growth. It would take
from the 75
that oil is today
and the expected,
you know, 3 4%
production growth, that's in the
consensus outlook.
It would take that kind of a
move for
the general fund amount of
the revenue to be
affected by this
average, which means
the severance tax
permanent fund is now absorbing
all of that volatility
instead of the general
fund. So those price moves
happen, changes how much we
receive to manage.
But it doesn't change how much the general
fund is going to get unless that move is
very large. Again,
certainly not impossible.
And we've seen in
very crazy price
scenarios happen, but it
does make it harder and that makes
it a lot less volatile for
the general fund.
And it simplifies that revenue
estimating these revenue sources
are notoriously
difficult to predict.
But after implementing the five year
average, uh that goes to
early childhood and now,
especially with
this capped amount from these two
sources, you know
exactly how much you're going to get
in oil and gas revenue. It's
going to be that amount
unless there's a significant
driver in the market that pushes
it below that
amount.
It also significantly
reduces the general fund
dependence on oil and gas
revenue. So if
you look at just this chart
here,
um For Fy
17,
I
didn't write down that number, but
it's around 500 or
so million is the total
amount of revenue that
the general fund received
from these two revenue
sources. And
then look at fy
24 and that
2.8 billion
that is massive
massive growth
specifically
from oil and gas and that
oil and gas money has been growing
disproportionately faster
than other sources of revenue
to the general fund. Which
simple math pushes
up the percent of
revenue that is coming
from oil and gas versus
other revenue sources.
But what you all have done
in capping the amount of oil and
gas revenue is
that now, the general fund
grows by other sources,
gross receipts taxes,
income taxes proportionally
over time, oil
and gas comes down as a percentage
share of your dependents
uh of general fund
revenue.
And then overall it approve,
improves the general fund
stability because it
replaces these volatile
energy revenues which go
up and down every
year. Um And in and of
themselves, very hard to
predict with the
predictability of the severance tax
permanent fund distributions.
So, you know, going into
your budget session exactly
what that amount is going to be because
it's based on a five prior
five year rolling average.
And you have a pretty good idea
moving forward of
what that increase is going
to be with
some marginal market
volatility that's mostly smooth.
Should it occur?
Now,
you'll see here that these
distributions
incredibly
change how
the Severance tax
fund will send money to the general
fund. Looking
to the prior to the passage of
this bill. That's the gray dotted
line. And our current
pro production of our
distributions to the
general fund is the
dark blue line.
And that difference is
your recurring
benefit to the general
fund that is
expected to continue to grow
over time as those revenues
continue to compound and
distribute. So
it takes that short term
money which you'll see
here in the overall outlook
for oil and gas is projected to
just peak at some
point and then continue to go
down and says, let's
invest that now and
redistribute it back to ourselves
over the long term where that can
continue to grow.
So the near term
impact of this bill is very
small. The difference in this
distribution for the f uh
for the severance tax
fund in the very
near term. You'll notice there's not
a lot of difference between that gray
and that blue line. That's because
your distributions are based on a five
year average. But over
time, over 25
years, the difference
in those distributions
grows incredibly
and significantly and
really helps to offset
that future expected
decline in oil and gas
revenues. And on that
point, I'll end on page
19
in looking toward this transition
from this volatile reliance
on oil and gas revenues to
a reliance on more stable general
fund distributions
from the permanent
funds. So
here we're looking at the
um consensus revenue
outlook from July
2023 that was presented
last year. I'm sure they'll do an
update again this year,
but this just says, looking
at fy 24
what was the
percentage
dependence or the amount
of general fund revenue that comes
from the permanent funds? And that's
12%.
The amount of revenue that comes
just from severance taxes,
rents and royalties
for this fiscal year.
24%.
Now, fast forward to the
future based on this current
outlook, the permanent
fund distributions will make
up 31% of
general fund revenue by fy
50 severance
taxes, rents and royalties,
9%
based on this outlook.
So you really are
trading this
volatile oil and gas
revenue for these stable
permanent fund distributions.
And over time these permanent
fund distributions will become
more and more meaningful
and impactful and
reliant for general
fund budgets.
And with that, I will
close there and be happy
to stand for any
questions.
>> All right. >> Thank you so much for the
presentation. >> Uh
Vice chair.
So
thank you, Mr Chair. Uh Let me
see if I can get my notes
together. We've had a couple of
presentations and
I wrote a number of different
notes here.
Um
Soon uh we had
talked in the 30 day session
about one of my concerns.
Always with
the, the
using state trust
lands for education
is you all have done a
great job over the
last
86 years, eight years
or whatever and increasing the amount
of funds.
But most of that doesn't actually get
to the public schools.
Uh What happens
is it's generated
and it gets supplanted by the
finance committee. I mean,
is that an accurate
characterization of
what happens? Because
every year I hear that you know,
we raised an extra $200
million for the school kids of New
Mexico. And yet we're
told in education
that, yeah, but, you know, we just
moved that money,
>> Mr Chair, Mr
Vice Chair. Um I, I
think that's correct.
Um So as
I mentioned earlier, we have legal
restraints on
using our money for
any other purpose
other than uh the
trust beneficiaries.
So what would clearly
the legislature could not
do is take
land grant, permanent fund
distributions or
land maintenance fund
distributions that
are for the common
schools take that and
say we're going to utilize it to build
roads. But what
does happen as
a routine practice as
part of the budgeting process
is offsetting?
So, um
uh X
agency has a budget of
$10 million a year
and we have a
wonderful year and they
get uh a track
that goes up and we get
$12 million for
it. They don't
necessarily are,
see that windfall and are
able to immediately
take that. What often
occurs is the general
fund side of the budget
is then reduced.
Uh So the overall budget
doesn't go up
very much. Um
And I would point
out that the way this works with
each of the 21 different
beneficiaries is
probably almost 21
different ways in terms of their bar
authority and all of those things.
Um But that
has been a challenge we've had for many
years. How do we ensure
that these windfalls
actually go to the
beneficiaries themselves
who they're intended to go to. And
don't just kind of generally
help the finances
in the state overall.
>> Mr Chair and, and Mr
Stewart, thank you. And we had
talked about it some, it was too short
in a 30 day session, but I
again, would very much be interested
in how can we see that
those windfalls are going to
the beneficiaries rather
than being supplanted by the finance
committee into whatever their budget
was going to be. And
just you, and that allows them
essentially to ship the money
elsewhere,
which, you know, in reality,
it's kind of like you didn't get the money,
it just went into the general budget
and finance determined who
was gonna get money. Uh So
I'm very interested if there's some
mechanism or where there's a
way that when there is a
windfall off of state
trust lands, that
the windfall goes to the
beneficiaries
of those state trust
lands, whereas it is now it
really goes into the
permanent funds and the, the
general funds which I
recognize over time,
they start to see more of
that, but, but it really
isn't going to them.
Um
Mr Mr Chair,
uh and on, let
me see if I can get
as we get to the Investment
Council on page six
where it had what our targets
are for
investments.
I think a more accurate
is how did we do
compared to the markets in
general markets
go up and down. Are
we beating the average?
Are we at the average? Are
we below the average? Not,
are we meeting some
long term term
historical
goal? How
would you respond to that or where do
we find, how are we doing
compared to
investments in general? I
think that's the more accurate as
to how New Mexico is doing. Not,
are we meeting some
arbitrary
goal?
>> Uh Mr Vir, that's a
good question. And
um though we didn't
include it in this
presentation, um
the LFC does issue a
quarterly report that
shows how the
S IC and the funds
that we manage the three big
ones anyway. Uh
and the, the two pensions,
how they perform against
their institutional peers
and they have these rankings,
I can tell you generally
speaking, um and they
haven't released their, their Q
one report yet.
That's I think we sent it
over two days
ago. Um how
we did and
I can tell you short
term we have
underperformed uh
compared to the broader
markets. And the reason
for that is the risk return
profile that we have developed over
time. As I mentioned,
we, we are not a fan of
volatility. Um
We are going to position
conservatively because we don't
want to see large
losses. Um
And the reasons for that, they,
they, the underlying
reasons are, are many,
um, including
the fact that, uh, frankly
we've been
expecting, I think, to a high
degree, a recession
over, over the
last several years,
that that's not really happened.
The, the Federal Reserve has been
able to manage, uh, the
economy in such a way that
we've, we've all heard about a
soft landing for the
economy and
that's wonderful if, if we can
achieve it. Um,
but we
don't want to make,
you know, you have a, a fund that
has grown uh very
quickly to, to $7
billion. One thing that we
don't want to do with that fund
is give it all back through
some market move.
Um So it depends on, on
the investment horizon
for these funds. Generally, it's going
to be permanent for the land
grant and the Severance tax
fund, um
and other funds. We, we
position them differently
based on
um the long
term intent of those
funds. Do we take more
risk? Do we take less? Those
are decisions that the council
makes again,
generally land grant
fund has underperformed
because we've taken less
exposure to the
stock market. Um
We, we have
diversified our portfolios
to include um
alternative investments, like
private equity, real
estate, other things that
kind of smooth our returns over
time. So we don't end up with one
of these situations.
Um And that's been
what we've been doing over the more
than the last decade.
Um So the
council does calibrate
this periodically
and look at each fund.
Uh Don mentioned that the, the
higher education trust fund would have
an allocation set at
this next meeting.
Um And so they
will have a menu of, of
how this fund should be
allocated, what level of
risk it should take. And
we, we base that on
um both
the, what whatever the law
indicates uh as
well as the, the beneficiaries
and input we get from them.
Um and, and committees
like this,
>> Mr Chair and, you know, kind
of along those lines you had
indicated compared to our
peers, don't they have
similar risk
aversion that we would have.
And if not, why don't we have peers
that would have similar risk aversion
to calibrate
against >> everyone
has their own kind of point of view,
long term as far as
um what the goals
of each individual fund
are. So mostly we compare
ourselves against other public
institutions that includes
primarily pensions
um as well as
other similar permanent
funds or sovereign wealth
funds if you will. Um
We're the third largest sovereign
wealth fund in the
country and one of the
top 40 in the world.
Um We're buying Texas
and Alaska. Those are
slightly ahead of
us. We're gonna catch
Texas uh based
on our growth projections.
Um So
those decisions are made
as, as a matter of
policy, I
can tell you long term,
the land grant fund
has
been basically
median among our
peers, slightly
below that and slightly above
that, depending on whether you're
looking at five years or
10 years.
Um, short
term, as I said, I think
we are probably, uh,
just on the cusp
between 3rd and 4th quartile
because we have not taken as
much, uh, stock
risk or public equity
risk as our peers.
Um, I think you'll
find similar things with, with the
pensions that we see.
Uh, er, B is
also positioned
similarly. They don't
want a lot of,
of that risk that you
get when you put a lot
of your, your assets into
the stock market. Um,
we'd much rather smooth out
those returns
diversify
and um, and
get something that's more
sustainable long term
like a 7%
annualized target for the,
the land grant fund,
Severance tax fund. We take
even a lower target
because certain things
that fund does that no
other fund that New Mexico
has, does
specifically investments
in New Mexico companies.
And uh, what we
call etis are economically
targeted investments
like the money that's allocated from
the Severance tax fund to the
small business Investment Corp.
That's 2% of the fund.
We know that that's not going
to return 7%.
Um, based on
uh, the, the level of
risk that that type of
investment has.
It's there to help boost the
economy in New Mexico. That's
what makes the Severance tax Fund
a special flower out
among uh, out of the 12
funds that we manage
So those numbers I,
I would refer you to the, to the
LF CS quarterly report.
Um, you can go
online to how we did. I, I
think through, um,
uh, actually it would have
been just through the end of
the third quarter of last
year. So there is a bit of a
lag on this. And
as I said, the, the 1231
numbers should be produced
here by the LFC shortly,
But you can see how we do
against our, our public
universe of, of pure
funds. Um,
short term underperformance,
long term, we're right there with
them. Um Three year,
we're top quartile.
Um And the reason for that,
well, in 2022 we had a
20% market
pullback uh in the stock
market and even fixed
income lost 10%
that year. It was a very
challenging year for investors.
There wasn't a lot of good
outcomes, but
because of the way we were
positioned against our peers,
we beat three quarters
of those on a three
year analy annualized
basis. So
that's, that's,
I hope that helps answer your
question. >> It
does when I,
when I first in the legislature, I
was on
the
Yeah. Yeah, it
was mind numbing
at many of the meetings. I'm glad
there are some people like you all
who, who get into all of
this. Um
But I was, I'm always concerned
because if we're underperform
with the peers,
that's all money that is lost that
then isn't getting compounded
and such into the future.
And what is that loss
that we are taking for
the security
of, uh,
of a longer investment
horizon type of thing?
And, you know, because that kind
of needs to get factored in
too is, you know, what's
lost in the potential
future revenues when that
money isn't there generating
long term? Uh,
let me move on a little bit. One
of the things that's bugged me of
the last couple of years
when the Lauren Nyaga
uh bill went
in and there was a line in there.
It took me a while to, to figure it
out
that dealt with at the
end of the year, money left
over from cash reserves. If it
was above a certain point
got swept into
the permanent
funds,
please explain,
Don. And you
please
explain
that is how that mechanism
works. Absolutely, >> Mr
Chair
Senator Souls.
So uh
that mechanism was
actually in place prior to
the Larranaga Bill. It's been in
place for a very long
time. It's a
the mechanism that you're speaking
of is anything
above the 8%
cap on the general fund
operating reserve was then
swept into the tax
stabilization reserve.
Now, before the
Larranaga bill, the tax stabilization
reserve couldn't actually
grow. It had mechanisms that
distributed money out of that.
What the Larranaga Bill did is
say, no, this fund
can actually now accumulate, it
doesn't make further distribution.
So that now it can become a true
rainy day fund. But it didn't
change that mechanism
that puts the amount
above the 8% cap
into the tax stabilization
reserve. But you are correct in
that, that mechanism
has been the primary reason
for why the tax stabilization
reserve has grown so much
over time because now
because that fund can accumulate
money. And we've seen
such big windfalls
from oil and gas revenues,
not just from the
revenue sources. I've mentioned
here today, although that is a big part
of it, but increases
in uh gross
receipts, taxes from Eddie and
Lee, the revenue estimates
have come in significantly
stronger. Uh actual
revenue amounts have come in
significantly stronger
than what was projected
during the legislative session.
Those uh
excess revenues
had to go into the operating
reserve and then
subsequently, anything
above eight percent was distributed
to the tax stabilization reserve.
Now, the Larranaga bill
also instituted a second
mechanism by which
the tax stabilization reserve
could get money and that's
excess of the five year average
of the school tax
as long as
general fund reserves
are not or, or that
they are below
25%.
Um It's only actually ever
gotten uh one
I believe no, 22
distributions from
that. Um But then
reserves had already exceeded
25% and that
distribution was instead going
to early childhood instead of the
tax stabilization reserve.
One last thing I'll just point
out that amount above
the 8% cap was just
changed in this last
legislative session.
That money no
longer goes to the
tax stabilization reserve.
It now goes to the grow
fund
which I I honestly
cannot remember everything that fund
stands for, but
it is now
distributed into
that fund. So
at this point, the only
way for the tax stabilization
reserve to get any more
money at all
is if it gets,
if total reserves now
go below
25%
and there is an excess
above the five year average
for the school tax
specifically,
then the
amount of that excess will
be deposited to bring total reserves
back to 25%. And
anything over that will
then still continue to go into
the early childhood fund.
>> Thank you for
the explanation. That
was mind
numbing again. Sorry,
I'm an educator,
not a, a finance person.
Uh
But some
of the reason I bring that up
is the last several
years, we have artificially
kept the cash reserves
very high
38%
or something like
knowing it's going to be above
the 25% and all that
excess money gets
swept off into permanent
funds. You're in
front of the education committee.
We're concerned that we aren't, you
know, we heard from the earlier on,
there's not enough money going
in to the schools for what they
need and we're told there
is no money yet. We
are sweeping extra money
off into permanent funds.
And some of the charts later
on show that money
not really becoming
available
until 2050.
You know, that's when my
granddaughter who was just
born is going to be having
Children. You know, we've got
needs now and
yet we're setting up
financial mechanisms
to ensure that we
continue our using oil and
gas money 25
years from now
when we are allowed, 50%
of our Children living in poverty in the
state. You know, and I think,
and I'm just very frustrated
by that, that we are setting
up long term
funds for
my great, great
grandchildren
instead of using the money now
to set up a different future.
Uh And, and that's just one
of the mechanisms is
uh by setting
up high cash
reserves knowing that
we're not going to need them and sweeping
them off into permanent
funds instead of using them to
make a difference
today. Uh
I'll get off my soapbox,
but thank you for helping
explain some of those funding
mechanism and where things are going.
Thank you, Mr Chair
>> or a presumed
Gart.
>> Thank you Mr Chair. Thank you
Lasc for setting
this up. I feel like
I've gone from freshman to
sophomore in
understanding what the heck's
going on. Um
So it's a little less mind,
mind numbing than it
has been in the past. My
first question is on the
land office presentation
on page 13. It's
a little bit of a weedy
question
on the other top
income sources,
the right of way.
Um shot
up in
2020.
What happened then? What was
that
>> Mr Chair representative?
Um so much of
our right of way activity
is driven by oil and
gas. And so
we see
initially,
we'll see a bump
in our
oil and gas uh
bonus auction
revenue because they
get the lease. But
under the lease, they have
up to five years to
actually develop
and produce or else the
lease expires. Um
So usually a
couple years after they get the
lease is when they're putting
together, um,
you know, rights of ways
to maybe tie to well
pads or related
type of infrastructure.
Um, so a lot of that
spike was related
to oil and gas
activity.
>> Um, and Mr Chair
and um, deputy
commissioner, so
does rideaway apply
like the transmission
lines. The Zia line.
Is that another right
of way
type of uh
revenue that comes
in
>> Mr Chair representative?
Absolutely. And I, I think when
we talk about diversification
within each of these different
categories, you're gonna see
that um,
Sunia
$50 million
is what they're paying us and
they're going to have another line right next
to it, $50
million. That's going to be a right
away. Um So,
uh, or it is a right way.
Um, so we, you know,
transmission lines,
roads,
telecom,
um, you know, anything that you
can imagine in the oil and gas
from pipelines and all of that
infrastructure as well.
>> Ok. So mister
chairman
and, and deputy minister,
so it could be above the
land under
the ground,
whatever
>> Mr Chairman
Representative, we, we
do have kind of rights of
way that our
subsurface
as well. Um
Those are often
um uh well,
let me give you a specific example.
We would call it an easement, a water
easement. Um
We don't own the water,
but we might charge
for the right to put a
well down
to access the water.
So you might have something like
that. >> Thank
you. And then Mr Chair,
my other question is on
the State Investment Council
and um Don thank
you very much for the words
that I didn't know to use
mechanism to
grow. Um
So on the workforce
development and apprenticeship trust
fund from House Bill
five,
originally, the request was
50 million. It became 30
million. It's
an expendable amount. So
in 10 years,
it goes down is
there.
So now that
I'm a sophomore, not
a freshman in
understanding all this.
So to make it
seems to be an expend
expendable fund, you
need some kind of source
that regularly
is feeding money into
it. Am I understanding that?
Right?
>> All.
Yes.
Good morning.
So,
right.
Physically occurring.
Yeah.
One
time,
of course, training
fund.
Hello,
down on
that
out of
it.
Much
more.
>> Ok. So my final
question, Mr Chair
is then for
that to cease to be
expendable
right now. The only way to
expand it is a a
general
fund appropriation
next year, the year after.
But to make it non
expendable, we would have
to find a source
that would distribute money
to it every
year. Do you understand what I'm
asking?
>> And Mr Chair Representative
Garrett, I, I think it
depends on what you're meaning by
expendable. Um, and
it may not be the same way that we think
about it. Um, for
expendable as in being
it, it will be spent down.
It is not necessarily a
permanent fund when you
have a $30
million fund
that is distributing 3
to $5 million a
year. Simple math tells
you that only has a certain
runway. Now, I can
tell you we're doing the best we can
to manage those funds to
get out a few extra years as
best we can
um for you all.
But the,
uh it, in terms of
being an expendable fund
as in appropriated by the
legislature, that's another way of
thinking about expendable.
This fund is not expendable
in that way, this
fund only makes a single
distribution of a
specified amount
once a year for this
purpose. Um
But in the sense that
it's, it's not
permanent, it doesn't have
enough money to grow over
time compared to expending
policy. The, the
best way
to alleviate that would
be to um invest
additional dollars
so that your spending
policy relative to the
size of your fund doesn't
constantly deplete that fund
over time. And did you want to
>> add? I did I have a good
example of
um funds.
Uh, one of the
initial funds we took on was water,
trust fund. It
had a about,
oh gosh,
it was distributing $4
million a year and the fund had
grown to about 40
million, but that's
not sustainable. A 10%
spending policy,
it's not going to
survive. And so
we raised the flag a few
times um saying
you probably need to either
change your spending policy lower
that and I know that's not a comfortable
conversation or
find it an additional
funding source um
that will put money in every
year or give
a big enough
appropriation that it
becomes self-sustaining.
And that is where you eventually
got the last couple of years.
And now that fund is
more of a, a typical
endowment where it's going to distribute
a percentage of its overall
assets and it's,
it's a revenue engine for the
state. Um It,
it may not do everything
that you want today,
but eventually you're going
to have a much greater impact over
time.
>> Thank you.
That's
helpful. Thank
>> you.
All right. I don't have anybody else
on my list. Thank you
very much for your presentation. We
really appreciate
it. All right,
folks. So we're gonna
go to lunch. Thank
you to
Belen for
lunch today. We appreciate
it. Um We'll come back at
115 folks.
